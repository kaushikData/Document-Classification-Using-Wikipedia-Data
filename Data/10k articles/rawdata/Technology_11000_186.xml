ADDIE is an [[instructional systems design]] (ISD) framework that many [[instructional design]]ers and [[training and development|training developers]] use to develop courses.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Gary R. Designing Effective Instruction, 6th Edition. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The name is an [[acronym]] for the five phases it defines for building training and performance support tools:
* Analysis
* Design
* Development
* Implementation
* Evaluation
Most current ISD models are variations of the ADDIE process.&lt;ref name="Piskurich, G.M. 2006"&gt;Piskurich, G.M. (2006). Rapid Instructional Design: Learning ID fast and right.&lt;/ref&gt; Other models include the [[Instructional design#Dick and Carey|Dick and Carey]] and Kemp ISD models. [[Rapid prototyping]] is another common alternative.

Instructional theories are important in instructional materials design. These include [[behaviorism]], [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]], [[Social learning theory|social learning]], and [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]].

==History==
Florida State University initially developed the ADDIE framework{{When|date=October 2018}} to explain, “...the processes involved in the formulation of an instructional systems development (ISD) program for military interservice training that will adequately train individuals to do a particular job and which can also be applied to any interservice curriculum development activity.”&lt;ref name="ADDIE"&gt;Branson, R. K., Rayner, G. T., Cox, J. L., Furman, J. P., King, F. J., Hannum, W. H. (1975). Interservice procedures for instructional systems development. (5 vols.) (TRADOC Pam 350-30 NAVEDTRA 106A). Ft. Monroe, VA: U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, August 1975. (NTIS No. ADA 019 486 through ADA 019 490).&lt;/ref&gt;  The model originally contained several steps under its five original phases (analyze, design, develop, implement, and evaluate).&lt;ref name="ADDIE" /&gt; The idea was to complete each phase before moving to the next. Subsequent practitioners revised the steps, and eventually the model became more dynamic and interactive than the original hierarchical version. By the mid-1980s, the version familiar today appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Forest: [http://educationaltechnology.net/the-addie-model-instructional-design/ The ADDIE Model: Instructional Design], Educational Technology&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:ADDIE Model of Design.jpg|right|thumb|300px|ADDIE Model]]

The origin of the label itself is obscure, but the underlying ISD concepts come from a model developed for the U.S. armed forces in the mid 1970s. As Branson (1978) recounts, the Center for Educational Technology at Florida State University worked with a branch of the U.S. Army to develop a model, which evolved into the Interservice Procedures for Instructional Systems Development (IPISD), intended for the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. Branson provides a graphic overview of the IPISD, which shows five top-level headings: analyze, design, develop, implement, and control. Virtually all subsequent historical reviews of ID reference this model but, notably, users do not refer to it by the ADDIC acronym. The authors and users refer only to IPISD. Hence, it is clearly not the source of the ADDIE acronym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Molenda|first=Michael|title=In Search of the Elusive ADDIE Model|date=May–June 2003|journal=Performance Improvement|volume=42|issue=5|pages=34–37|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~molpage/In%20Search%20of%20Elusive%20ADDIE.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020101221/http://www.indiana.edu/~molpage/In%20Search%20of%20Elusive%20ADDIE.pdf|archivedate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phases of ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation)==

===Analysis phase===
The analysis phase clarifies the instructional problems and objectives, and identifies the learning environment and learner's existing knowledge and skills. Questions the analysis phase addresses include:
* Who are the learners and what are their characteristics?
* What is the desired new behavior?
* What types of learning constraints exist?
* What are the delivery options?
* What are the [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] considerations?
* What [[Andragogy|adult learning theory]] considerations apply?
* What is the timeline for project completion?

The process of asking these questions is often part of a [[needs analysis]].&lt;ref name="streamlined"&gt;{{cite book|title=Streamlined ID: A Practical Guide to Instructional Design|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|page=21|url=http://routledgetextbooks.com/textbooks/_author/larson-9780415505185/|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the needs analysis instructional designers (IDs) will determine constraints and resources in order to fine tune their plan of action. &lt;ref name="streamlined" /&gt;

===Design phase===
The design phase deals with learning objectives, assessment instruments, exercises, content, subject matter analysis, lesson planning, and media selection. The design phase should be systematic and specific. ''Systematic'' means a logical, orderly method that identifies, develops, and evaluates a set of planned strategies for attaining project goals. ''Specific'' means the team must execute each element of the instructional design plan with attention to detail. The design phase may involve writing a ''design document/design proposal'' or ''concept and structure note'' to aid final development.

===Development phase===
In the development phase, instructional designers and developers create and assemble content assets described in the design phase. If e-learning is involved, programmers develop or integrate technologies. Designers create storyboards. Testers [[debug]] materials and procedures. The team reviews and revises the project according to feedback.

===Implementation phase===
The implementation phase develops procedures for training facilitators and learners. Training facilitators cover the course curriculum, learning outcomes, method of delivery, and testing procedures. Preparation for learners includes training them on new tools (software or hardware) and student registration. Implementation includes evaluation of the design.

===Evaluation phase===
The evaluation phase consists of two aspects: formative and summative. [[Formative assessment|Formative evaluation]] is present in each stage of the ADDIE process, while summative evaluation is conducted on finished instructional programs or products. [[Donald_Kirkpatrick|Donald Kirkpatrick's Four Levels of Learning Evaluation]] are often utilized during this phase of the ADDIE process.

==Other versions==
Some institutions have modified the ADDIE model to meet specific needs. For example, the United States Navy created a version they call PADDIE+M. The P phase is the planning phase, which develops project goals, project objectives, budget, and schedules. The M phase is the maintenance phase, which implements life cycle maintenance with continuous improvement methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=NAVAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING COMMAND INTEGRATED LEARNING ENVIRONMENT COURSE DEVELOPMENT AND LIFE-CYCLE MAINTENANCE|date=November 2010|publisher=Naval Education and Training Command}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model is gaining acceptance in the United States government as a more complete model of ADDIE. Some organizations have adopted the PADDIE model without the M phase. Pavlis Korres (2010), in her instructional model (ESG Framework),&lt;ref&gt;Pavlis Korres, Maria (2010). Ph.D. thesis. Development of a framework for the e-education of educators of special groups aiming to improve their compatibility with their Learners. University of Alcala, Spain.&lt;/ref&gt; has proposed an expanded version of ADDIE, named ADDIE+M, where Μ=Maintenance of the Learning Community Network after the end of a course. The Maintenance of the Learning Community Network is a modern educational process that supports the continuous educational development of its members with social media and web tools.

==Plot==

A [[generation ship]] is launched from [[Saturn]] in 2545. It includes twenty-four self-contained [[biomes]] and an average population of two thousand people. One hundred sixty years and approximately seven generations later, it is beginning its approach to the [[Tau Ceti]] system to begin colonization of a planet's moon, an [[Earth analog]], which has been named Aurora.

Devi, the ship's ''[[de facto]]'' chief engineer and leader, is concerned about the decaying infrastructure and biology of the ship: systems are breaking down, each generation has lower intelligence test scores than the last, and bacteria are mutating and evolving at a faster rate than humans. She tells the ship's AI, referred to simply as Ship, to keep a [[narrative]] of the voyage. After having some trouble with understanding the human concept of narrative, Ship eventually elects to follow the life of Devi's daughter Freya as a [[protagonist]].

As a teenager, Freya travels around the ship on her ''[[wanderjahr]]'' and learns that many of the ship's inhabitants are dissatisfied with their enclosed existence and what they perceive as a [[dictatorship]]. Movement is strictly limited for most people, reproduction is tightly controlled, and education in science and mathematics is mandatory. Freya's ''wanderjahr'' comes to an end when she is called home as Devi grows sick from cancer and dies.

The ship arrives in the Tau Ceti system and begins to settle Aurora, a moon of [[Tau Ceti e]]. It soon becomes apparent that [[extraterrestrial life]] is present in the form of primitive [[prions]], which infect and kill most of the landing party. The surviving settlers attempt to return to the ship, and some of those remaining onboard kill them in the airlock to maintain [[quarantine]], leading to a violent political schism throughout the ship. The ship itself, which has been moving towards [[self-awareness]], takes physical control of the situation by lowering oxygen levels and separating warring factions, referring to itself as "the [[rule of law]]". It then reveals to the crew that there were in fact two ships originally launched for the Tau Ceti expedition, but the other was destroyed during a period of severe civil unrest, and the collective memory of that event was erased from the history records. Under Ship's moderation, a more peaceful debate takes place between the inhabitants about what to do now that Aurora is known to be inhospitable. Unable to reach consensus, the factions agree to part ways, with those who wish to stay retaining as many resources as can be spared to pursue an unlikely attempt at [[terraforming]] the Mars-like planet Iris, while the other group, led by Freya, opt to try and return to [[Earth]]. Freya and the others who return do not receive any communication from those who remained in the Tau Ceti system.

On the voyage back to Earth, the ship's biomes continue to deteriorate as bacteria flourish and crops fail. The humans soon face [[famine]] and experiment with an untested form of [[cryogenic freezing]], which is largely successful. Upon returning to the [[Solar system]], Ship is forced to decelerate by means of [[gravity assist]] between various planets, a process which takes twelve years. During this time, with the full communications data of humanity available to it, it learns more about why it was launched in the first place—simply for [[expansionism]]—and denounces its builders as "criminally negligent narcissists". Ship manages to safely drop its humans off on a pass of Earth but fails to make a final gravity slowdown past the Sun. Ship is destroyed along with the last survivor of the landing on Aurora.

Freya and the other "starfarers" have trouble adjusting to life on Earth, especially with many Terrans hostile to them for a perceived sense of ingratitude and cowardice. At a [[space colonization]] conference, a speaker says humanity will continue to send ships into interstellar space no matter how many fail and die, and Freya assaults him. Eventually she joins a group of [[terraformers]] who are attempting to restore the Earth's beaches after their loss during previous centuries' [[sea level rise]]. While swimming and surfing, she begins to come to terms with life on Earth.

==Major themes==
Major themes in ''Aurora'' include complexities of life aboard a multi-generational starship, interpersonal psychology, artificial intelligence, human migration, and the feasibility of star travel.&lt;ref name=lewin/&gt;

==Development history==
Robinson says that in researching the novel he met with his friend [[Christopher McKay]] who has helped him since the ''[[Mars Trilogy]]''. McKay arranged lunches at the NASA [[Ames Research Center]] where Robinson asked questions of NASA employees.&lt;ref name=lewin/&gt;

'''Biodegradation''' is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as [[bacteria]], [[fungi]].{{efn| The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] defines biodegradation as "degradation caused by enzymatic process resulting from the action of cells" and notes that the definition is "modified to exclude abiotic enzymatic processes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vert M, Doi Y, Hellwich KH, Hess M, Hodge P, Kubisa P, Rinaudo M, Schué F | title=Terminology for biorelated polymers and applications (IUPAC Recommendations 2012) |journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]] |year=2012 |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=377–410 |doi=10.1351/PAC-REC-10-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Biodegradation| vauthors = Focht DD | work = AccessScience |doi=10.1036/1097-8542.422025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms ==
The process of biodegradation can be divided into three stages: biodeterioration, biofragmentation, and assimilation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Biodeterioration is a surface-level degradation that modifies the mechanical, physical, and chemical properties of the material. This stage occurs when the material is exposed to abiotic factors in the outdoor environment and allows for further degradation by weakening the material's structure. Some abiotic factors that influence these initial changes are compression (mechanical), light, temperature, and chemicals in the environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lucas N, Bienaime C, Belloy C, Queneudec M, Silvestre F, Nava-Saucedo JE | title = Polymer biodegradation: mechanisms and estimation techniques | journal = Chemosphere | volume = 73 | issue = 4 | pages = 429–42 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18723204 | doi = 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2008.06.064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;While biodeterioration typically occurs as the first stage of biodegradation, it can in some cases be parallel to biofragmentation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Muller|first=Rolf-Joachim | editor-first =  Alexander | editor-last = Steinbüchel | name-list-format = vanc | chapter = Biodegradability of Polymers: Regulations and Methods for Testing |title=Biopolymers |publisher=Wiley-VCH |isbn=978-3-527-30290-1 | chapter-url = https://application.wiley-vch.de/books/biopoly/pdf_v10/vol10_19.pdf | doi = 10.1002/3527600035.bpola012 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biofragmentation of a polymer is the lytic process in which bonds within a polymer are cleaved, generating oligomers and monomers in its place.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The steps taken to fragment these materials also differ based on the presence of oxygen in the system. The breakdown of materials by microorganisms when oxygen is present is aerobic digestion, and the breakdown of materials when is oxygen is not present is anaerobic digestion.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polimernet.com/Docs/Aerobic%20-%20Anaerobic%20Biodegredation%20en.pdf|title=Aerobic and Anaerobic Biodegradation| work = Fundementals of Aerobic &amp; Anaerobic Biodegradation Process | publisher = Polimernet Plastik San. Tic. Ltd. Şti. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main difference between these processes is that anaerobic reactions produce methane, while aerobic reactions do not (however, both reactions produce carbon dioxide, water, some type of residue, and a new biomass).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ezproxy.library.wur.nl/193543|title=Analytical Methods for Monitoring Biodegradation Techniques|last=Van der Zee|first=Maarten | name-list-format = vanc |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, aerobic digestion typically occurs more rapidly than anaerobic digestion, while anaerobic digestion does a better job reducing the volume and mass of the material.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Due to anaerobic digestion's ability to reduce the volume and mass of waste materials and produce a natural gas, anaerobic digestion technology is widely used for  waste management systems and as a source of local, renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Klinkner | first = Blake Anthony | name-list-format = vanc | title = Anaerobic Digestion as a Renewable Energy Source and Waste Management Technology: What Must be Done for this Technology to Realize Success in the United States? | url = https://scholarship.law.umassd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&amp;context=umlr | journal = University of Massachusetts Law Review | volume = 9 | pages = 68–96 | year = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting products from biofragmentation are then integrated into microbial cells, this is the assimilation stage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some of the products from fragmentation are easily transported within the cell by membrane carriers. However, others still have to undergo biotransformation reactions to yield products that can then be transported inside the cell. Once inside the cell, the products enter catabolic pathways that either lead to the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or elements of the cells structure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Factors affecting biodegradation rate ==
In practice, almost all chemical compounds and materials are subject to biodegradation processes. The significance, however, is in the relative rates of such processes, such as days, weeks, years or centuries. A number of factors determine the rate at which this degradation of organic compounds occurs.

[[Respirometry]] tests can be used for [[aerobic microbes]]. First one places a solid waste sample in a container with microorganisms and soil, and then aerates the mixture. Over the course of several days, microorganisms digest the sample bit by bit and produce carbon dioxide – the resulting amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; serves as an indicator of degradation. Biodegradability can also be measured by anaerobic microbes and the amount of methane or alloy that they are able to produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Andy | last = Jessop | name-list-format = vanc |url=https://commercialwaste.trade/how-is-biodegradability-measured/ |title=How is biodegradability measured? |date=2015-09-16 |work=Commercial Waste |access-date=2018-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It’s important to note factors that effect biodegradation rates during product testing to ensure that the results produced are accurate and reliable.

{{Main|Biodegradable plastic#Examples of biodegradable plastics}}

The term Biodegradable Plastics refers to a material that maintains its mechanical strength during practical use but break down into low-weight compounds and non-toxic byproducts after their use.&lt;ref name = "Ikada_2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ikada |first=Yoshito |last2=Tsuji |first2=Hideto | name-list-format = vanc |date= February 2000 | title = Biodegradable polyesters for medical and ecological applications |journal=Macromolecular Rapid Communications |volume=21|issue=3|pages=117–132 |doi=10.1002/(sici)1521-3927(20000201)21:3&lt;117::aid-marc117&gt;3.0.co;2-x  | url = http://web.mit.edu/course/10/10.569/www/ikadaPEreview.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This breakdown is made possible through an attack of microorganisms on the material, which is typically a non-water soluble polymer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Such materials can be obtained through chemical synthesis, fermentation by microorganisms, and from chemically modified natural products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flieger M, Kantorová M, Prell A, Rezanka T, Votruba J | title = Biodegradable plastics from renewable sources | journal = Folia Microbiologica | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–44 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12744074 | doi = 10.1007/bf02931273 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plastics]] biodegrade at highly variable rates.  [[Polyvinylchloride|PVC]]-based plumbing is selected for handling [[sewage]] because PVC resists biodegradation.  Some packaging materials on the other hand are being developed that would degrade readily upon exposure to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kyrikou |first=Ioanna |last2=Briassoulis |first2=Demetres | name-list-format = vanc |date=12 Apr 2007 |title=Biodegradation of Agricultural Plastic Films: A Critical Review  |journal=Journal of Polymers and the Environment |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=125–150 |doi= 10.1007/s10924-007-0053-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of [[synthetic polymer]]s that biodegrade quickly include [[polycaprolactone]], other [[polyesters]] and aromatic-aliphatic esters, due to their ester bonds being susceptible to attack by water. A prominent example is [[poly-3-hydroxybutyrate]], the renewably derived [[polylactic acid]], and the synthetic polycaprolactone. Others are the cellulose-based cellulose acetate and celluloid (cellulose nitrate).

:[[File:Polylactid sceletal.svg|thumb|150px|[[Polylactic acid]] is an example of a plastic that biodegrades quickly.]]
Under [[anaerobic decomposition|low oxygen]] conditions plastics break down more slowly. The breakdown process can be accelerated in specially designed [[compost heap]]. Starch-based plastics will degrade within two to four months in a home compost bin, while polylactic acid is largely undecomposed, requiring higher temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/pls/portallive/docs/1/33773706.PDF |title= Section 6: Biodegradability of Packaging Waste |publisher=Www3.imperial.ac.uk |date= |access-date=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polycaprolactone and polycaprolactone-starch composites decompose slower, but the starch content accelerates decomposition by leaving behind a porous, high surface area polycaprolactone. Nevertheless, it takes many months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wu |first1=Chin-San | name-list-format = vanc |title=Physical properties and biodegradability of maleated-polycaprolactone/starch composite |journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability |date=January 2003 |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=127–134 |doi=10.1016/S0141-3910(02)00393-2 | url = http://www.kyu.edu.tw/93/epaperv6/93-129.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.453.4220 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2016, a bacterium named ''[[Ideonella sakaiensis]]'' was found to biodegrade [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]].

Many [[plastic producer]]s have gone so far even to say that their plastics are compostable, typically listing [[corn starch]] as an ingredient. However, these claims are questionable because the [[plastics industry]] operates under its own definition of compostable:
:"that which is capable of undergoing biological decomposition in a compost site such that the material is not visually distinguishable and breaks down into carbon dioxide, water, inorganic compounds and biomass at a rate consistent with known compostable materials." (Ref: [[ASTM]] D 6002)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compostable.info/compostable.htm | title = Compostable |publisher=Compostable.info |date= |access-date=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "composting" is often used informally to describe the biodegradation of packaging materials. Legal definitions exist for compostability, the process that leads to compost.  Four criteria are offered by the European Union:&lt;ref name="EN 13432"&gt;{{cite web|title=Requirements of the EN 13432 standard |url= https://docs.european-bioplastics.org/publications/bp/EUBP_BP_En_13432.pdf | date = April 2015| work =  European Bioplastics  |access-date=July 22, 2017|location=Brussels, Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Breulmann M, Künkel A, Philipp S, Reimer V, Siegenthaler KO, Skupin G, Yamamoto M | chapter = Polymers, Biodegradable | title = Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | year = 2012 | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | doi = 10.1002/14356007.n21_n01 | isbn = 978-3527306732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Chemical composition''': volatile matter and heavy metals as well as fluorine should be limited.
#'''Biodegradability''': the conversion of &gt;90% of the original material into CO2, water and minerals by biological processes within 6 months.
#'''Disintegrability''': at least 90% of the original mass should be decomposed into particles that are able to pass through a 2x2 mm sieve.
#'''Quality''': absence of toxic substances and other substances that impede composting.

== Biodegradable technology ==
Now biodegradable technology has become a highly developed market with applications in product [[packaging]], production, and medicine.  The biodegradation of biomass offers some guidances.&lt;ref name="pmid1736301"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luzier WD | title = Materials derived from biomass/biodegradable materials | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 839–42 | date = February 1992 | pmid = 1736301 | pmc = 48337 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyesters are known to biodegrade.&lt;ref name="pmid12161646"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gross RA, Kalra B | title = Biodegradable polymers for the environment | journal = Science | volume = 297 | issue = 5582 | pages = 803–7 | date = August 2002 | pmid = 12161646 | doi = 10.1126/science.297.5582.803  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxo-biodegradation is defined by [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] (the European Standards Organisation) as "degradation resulting from [[oxidative]] and cell-mediated phenomena, either simultaneously or successively." Whilst sometimes described as "oxo-fragmentable," and "oxo-degradable" these terms describe only the first or oxidative phase and should not be used for material which degrades by the process of oxo-biodegradation defined by CEN: the correct description is "oxo-biodegradable."

By combining plastic products with very large polymer molecules, which contain only [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]], with [[oxygen]] in the air, the product is rendered capable of [[decomposing]] in anywhere from a week to one to two years. This reaction occurs even without prodegradant additives but at a very slow rate. That is why conventional plastics, when discarded, [[plastic waste|persist for a long time in the environment]]. Oxo-biodegradable formulations catalyze and accelerate the biodegradation process but it takes considerable skill and experience to balance the ingredients within the formulations so as to provide the product with a useful life for a set period, followed by degradation and biodegradation.&lt;ref name="pmid15864950"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agamuthu P, Faizura PN | title = Biodegradability of degradable plastic waste | journal = Waste Management &amp; Research : The Journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 95–100 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15864950 | doi = 10.1177/0734242X05051045 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodegradable technology is especially utilized by the [[bio-medical]] community. Biodegradable polymers are classified into three groups:
medical, ecological, and dual application, while in terms of origin they are divided into two groups: natural and synthetic.&lt;ref name = "Ikada_2000" /&gt; The Clean Technology Group is exploiting the use of [[supercritical carbon dioxide]], which under high pressure at room temperature is a solvent that can use biodegradable plastics to make polymer drug coatings. The polymer (meaning a material composed of molecules with repeating structural units that form a long chain) is used to encapsulate a drug prior to injection in the body and is based on [[lactic acid]], a compound normally produced in the body, and is thus able to be excreted naturally. The coating is designed for controlled release over a period of time, reducing the number of injections required and maximizing the therapeutic benefit.  Professor Steve Howdle states that biodegradable polymers are particularly attractive for use in [[drug delivery]], as once introduced into the body they require no retrieval or further manipulation and are degraded into soluble, non-toxic by-products. Different polymers degrade at different rates within the body and therefore polymer selection can be tailored to achieve desired release rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Using Green Chemistry to Deliver Cutting Edge Drugs | author = The University of Nottingham | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070913132945.htm | work = Science Daily | date = September 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other biomedical applications include the use of biodegradable, elastic shape-memory polymers. Biodegradable implant materials can now be used for minimally invasive surgical procedures through degradable thermoplastic polymers. These polymers are now able to change their shape with increase of temperature, causing shape memory capabilities as well as easily degradable sutures. As a result, implants can now fit through small incisions, doctors can easily perform complex deformations, and sutures and other material aides can naturally biodegrade after a completed surgery.&lt;ref name="pmid11976407"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lendlein A, Langer R | title = Biodegradable, elastic shape-memory polymers for potential biomedical applications | journal = Science | volume = 296 | issue = 5573 | pages = 1673–6 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 11976407 | doi = 10.1126/science.1066102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biodegradation vs. composting ==
There is no universal definition for biodegradation and there are various definitions of composting, which has led to much confusion between the terms. They are often lumped together; however, they do not have the same meaning. Biodegradation is the naturally-occurring breakdown of materials by microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi or other biological activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gómez |first1=Eddie F. |last2=Michel |first2=Frederick C. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Biodegradability of conventional and bio-based plastics and natural fiber composites during composting, anaerobic digestion and long-term soil incubation |journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability |date=December 2013 |volume=98 |issue=12 |pages=2583–2591 |doi=10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2013.09.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composting is a human-driven process in which biodegradation occurs under a specific set of circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bpiworld.org/Composting|title=Biodegradable Products Institute - Composting|website=bpiworld.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant difference between the two is that one process is naturally-occurring and one is human-driven.

Biodegradable material is capable of decomposing without an oxygen source (anaerobically) into carbon dioxide, water, and biomass, but the timeline is not very specifically defined. Similarly, compostable material breaks down into carbon dioxide, water, and biomass; however, compostable material also breaks down into inorganic compounds. The process for composting is more specifically defined, as it controlled by humans. Essentially, composting is an accelerated biodegradation process due to optimized circumstances.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Magdoff|first=Fred | name-list-format = vanc |date= November 1993 |title=Building Soils for Better Crops |journal=Soil Science |volume=156 |issue=5 |pages=371 |doi=10.1097/00010694-199311000-00014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the end product of composting not only returns to its previous state, but also generates and adds beneficial microorganisms to the soil called humus. This organic matter can be used in gardens and on farms to help grow healthier plants in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.accessscience.com/content/325510|title=Humus|last=Morris|first=Schnitzer|last2= Martin |first2 = James P. | name-list-format = vanc | work =AccessScience |doi=10.1036/1097-8542.325510|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composting more consistently occurs within a shorter time frame since it is a more defined process and is expedited by human intervention. Biodegradation can occur in different time frames under different circumstances, but is meant to occur naturally without human intervention.
[[File:Organic Waste Disposal Streams.pdf|thumb|This figure represents the different paths of disposal for organic waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Kranert M, Behnsen A, Schultheis A, Steinbach D | chapter =Composting in the Framework of the EU Landfill Directive |date=2002 | title = Microbiology of Composting |pages=473–486 |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |doi=10.1007/978-3-662-08724-4_39 |isbn=9783642087059 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Even within composting, there are different circumstances under which this can occur. The two main types of composting are at-home versus commercial. Both produce healthy soil to be reused - the main difference lies in what materials are able to go into the process.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; At-home composting is mostly used for food scraps and excess garden materials, such as weeds. Commercial composting is capable of breaking down more complex plant-based products, such as corn-based plastics and larger pieces of material, like tree branches. Commercial composting begins with a manual breakdown of the materials using a grinder or other machine to initiate the process. Because at-home composting usually occurs on a smaller scale and does not involve large machinery, these materials would not fully decompose in at-home composting. Furthermore, one study has compared and contrasted home and industrial composting, concluding that there are advantages and disadvantages to both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martínez-Blanco J, Colón J, Gabarrell X, Font X, Sánchez A, Artola A, Rieradevall J | title = The use of life cycle assessment for the comparison of biowaste composting at home and full scale | journal = Waste Management | volume = 30 | issue = 6 | pages = 983–94 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20211555 | doi = 10.1016/j.wasman.2010.02.023 | url = http://ddd.uab.cat/record/163720 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following studies provide examples in which composting has been defined as a subset of biodegradation in a scientific context. The first study, "Assessment of Biodegradability of Plastics Under Simulated Composting Conditions in a Laboratory Test Setting," clearly examines composting as a set of circumstances that falls under the category of degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Starnecker A, Menner M  |date=1996-01-01|title=Assessment of biodegradability of plastics under simulated composting conditions in a laboratory test system |journal=International Biodeterioration &amp; Biodegradation|language=en|volume=37|issue=1–2|pages=85–92|doi=10.1016/0964-8305(95)00089-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, this next study looked at the biodegradation and composting effects of chemically and physically crosslinked polylactic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-02-01|title=Some composting and biodegradation effects of physically or chemically crosslinked poly(lactic acid) |journal=Polymer Testing |volume=31|issue=1|pages=83–92|doi=10.1016/j.polymertesting.2011.09.012 |last1=Żenkiewicz |first1=Marian |last2=Malinowski |first2=Rafał |last3=Rytlewski |first3=Piotr |last4=Richert |first4=Agnieszka |last5=Sikorska |first5=Wanda |last6=Krasowska |first6=Katarzyna | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably discussing composting and biodegrading as two distinct terms. The third and final study reviews European standardization of biodegradable and compostable material in the packaging industry, again using the terms separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Avella M, Bonadies E, Martuscelli E, Rimedio R |date=2001-01-01|title=European current standardization for plastic packaging recoverable through composting and biodegradation |journal=Polymer Testing|language=en|volume=20|issue=5|pages=517–521|doi=10.1016/S0142-9418(00)00068-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between these terms is crucial because waste management confusion leads to improper disposal of materials by people on a daily basis. Biodegradation technology has led to massive improvements in how we dispose of waste; there now exist trash, recycling, and compost bins in order to optimize the disposal process. However, if these waste streams are commonly and frequently confused, then the disposal process is not at all optimized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Akullian A, Karp C, Austin K, Durbin D | title =  Plastic Bag Externalities and Policy in Rhode Island | url = http://seattlebagtax.org/referencedpdfs/en-akullianetal.pdf | journal = Brown Policy Review | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biodegradable and compostable materials have been developed to ensure more of human waste is able to breakdown and return to its previous state, or in the case of composting even add nutrients to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Song JH, Murphy RJ, Narayan R, Davies GB | title = Biodegradable and compostable alternatives to conventional plastics | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences | volume = 364 | issue = 1526 | pages = 2127–39 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19528060 | pmc = 2873018 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2008.0289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a compostable product is thrown out as opposed to composted and sent to a landfill, these inventions and efforts are wasted. Therefore, it is important for average citizens to understand the difference between these terms so that materials can be disposed of properly and efficiently.

== Environmental and social effects ==
Plastic pollution from illegal dumping poses health risks to wildlife. Animals often mistake plastics for food, resulting in intestinal entanglement. Slow-degrading chemicals, like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), nonylphenol (NP), and pesticides also found in plastics, can release into environments and subsequently also be ingested by wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Webb |first=Hayden |last2=Arnott |first2=Jaimys |last3=Crawford |first3=Russell |last4=Ivanova |first4=Elena |last5=Webb |first5=Hayden K. |last6=Arnott |first6=Jaimys |last7=Crawford |first7=Russell J. |last8=Ivanova|first8=Elena P. | name-list-format = vanc |date=2012-12-28|title=Plastic Degradation and Its Environmental Implications with Special Reference to Poly(ethylene terephthalate) |journal=Polymers |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.3390/polym5010001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rachel Carson, a notable environmentalist in the 1960s, provided one of the first key studies on the consequences associated with chemical ingestion in wildlife, specifically birds. In her work ''Silent Spring'', she wrote on [[DDT]], a pesticide commonly used in human agricultural activities. Birds that ate the tainted bugs, Carson found, were more likely to produce eggs with thin and weak shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosner D, Markowitz G | title = Persistent pollutants: a brief history of the discovery of the widespread toxicity of chlorinated hydrocarbons | journal = Environmental Research | volume = 120 | pages = 126–33 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 22999707 | doi = 10.1016/j.envres.2012.08.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These chemicals also play a role in human health, as consumption of tainted food (in processes called biomagnification and bioaccumulation) has been linked to issues such as cancers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kelly BC, Ikonomou MG, Blair JD, Morin AE, Gobas FA | title = Food web-specific biomagnification of persistent organic pollutants | journal = Science | volume = 317 | issue = 5835 | pages = 236–9 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17626882 | doi = 10.1126/science.1138275 }}&lt;/ref&gt; neurological dysfunction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Passos CJ, Mergler D | title = Human mercury exposure and adverse health effects in the Amazon: a review | journal = Cadernos de Saude Publica | volume = 24 Suppl 4 | pages = s503–20 | date = 2008 | pmid = 18797727 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and hormonal changes. A well-known example of biomagnification impacting health in recent times is the increased exposure to dangerously high levels of mercury in fish, which can affect sex hormones in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rana SV | title = Perspectives in endocrine toxicity of heavy metals--a review | journal = Biological Trace Element Research | volume = 160 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–14 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24898714 | doi = 10.1007/s12011-014-0023-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In efforts to remediate the damages done by slow-degrading plastics, detergents, metals, and other pollutants created by humans, economic costs have become a concern. Marine litter in particular is notably difficult to quanitfy and review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Newman |first=Stephanie |last2=Watkins |first2=Emma |last3=Farmer |first3=Andrew |last4=Brink |first4=Patrick ten |last5=Schweitzer |first5=Jean-Pierre | name-list-format = vanc | chapter = The Economics of Marine Litter|date=2015 | title =Marine Anthropogenic Litter |pages=367–394 |publisher=Springer International Publishing |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-16510-3_14 |isbn=978-3-319-16509-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at the World Trade Institute estimate that cleanup initiatives' cost (specifically in ocean ecosystems) has hit close to thirteen billion dollars a year.&lt;ref name= "Matsangou_2018"&gt;{{cite news | first = Elizabeth | last = Matsangou | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2 July 2018 | url= https://www.worldfinance.com/markets/counting-the-cost-of-plastic-pollution | title=Counting the cost of plastic pollution |access-date=17 September 2018 | work = World Finance }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main concern stems from marine environments, with the biggest cleanup efforts centering around garbage patches in the ocean. In 2017, a [[Great Pacific garbage patch|garbage patch the size of Mexico]] was found in the Pacific Ocean. It is estimated to be upwards of a million square miles in size. While the patch contains more obvious examples of litter (plastic bottles, cans, and bags), tiny microplastics are nearly impossible to clean up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rochman CM, Cook AM, Koelmans AA | title = Plastic debris and policy: Using current scientific understanding to invoke positive change | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | volume = 35 | issue = 7 | pages = 1617–26 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27331654 | doi = 10.1002/etc.3408 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''National Geographic'' reports that even more non-biodegradable materials are finding their way into vulnerable environments - nearly thirty-eight million pieces a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Shaena | last = Montanari | name-list-format = vanc |url= https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/07/ocean-plastic-patch-south-pacific-spd/ |title=Plastic Garbage Patch Bigger Than Mexico Found in Pacific |date=2017-07-25 |access-date=2018-09-17 | work = National Geographic }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Materials that have not degraded can also serve as shelter for invasive species, such as tube worms and barnacles. When the ecosystem changes in response to the invasive species, resident species and the natural balance of resources, genetic diversity, and species richness is altered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gregory MR | title = Environmental implications of plastic debris in marine settings--entanglement, ingestion, smothering, hangers-on, hitch-hiking and alien invasions | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

The World Trade Institute also notes that the communities who often feel most of the effects of poor biodegradation are poorer countries without the means to pay for their cleanup.&lt;ref name= "Matsangou_2018" /&gt; In a positive feedback loop effect, they in turn have trouble controlling their own pollution sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hajat A, Hsia C, O'Neill MS | title = Socioeconomic Disparities and Air Pollution Exposure: a Global Review | journal = Current Environmental Health Reports | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 440–50 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26381684 | pmc = 4626327 | doi = 10.1007/s40572-015-0069-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology of "biodegradable" ==
The first known use of ''biodegradable'' in a biological context was in 1959 when it was  employed to describe the breakdown of material into innocuous components by [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/biodegradable|title=Definition of BIODEGRADABLE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now ''biodegradable'' is commonly associated with environmentally friendly products that are part of the earth's innate cycles and capable of decomposing back into natural elements.

[[File:Cleaning brushes.jpg|thumb|Cleaning brushes]] 
A '''brush''' is a common tool with [[bristle]]s, wire or other filaments. It generally consists of a handle or block to which filaments are affixed in either a parallel or perpendicular orientation, depending on the way the brush is to be gripped during use. The material of both the block and bristles or filaments is chosen to withstand hazards of its intended use, such as corrosive chemicals, heat or abrasion. It is used for [[cleaning tool|cleaning]], [[Personal grooming|grooming]] [[hair]], [[cosmetics|make up]],   [[painting]],  surface finishing and for many other purposes.   It is one of the most basic and versatile tools in use today, and the average household may contain several dozen varieties.

==Manufacture==

A common way of setting the bristles, brush filaments, in the brush is the staple or anchor set brush in which the filament is forced with a staple by the middle into a hole with a special driver and held there by the pressure against all of the walls of the hole and the portions of the staple nailed to the bottom of the hole.  The staple can be replaced with a kind of anchor, which is a piece of rectangular profile wire that is anchored to the wall of the hole, like in most toothbrushes. Another way to attach the bristles to the surface can be found in a fused brush, in which instead of being inserted into a hole, a plastic fibre is welded to another plastic surface, giving the option to use different diameters of bristles in the same brush.

Configurations include twisted-in wire (e.g. bottle brushes), cylinders and disks (with bristles spread in one face or radially).

==By function==

===Removal of material (cleaning and polishing)===

*[[Stippling]] brush (neither applies or removes material, but merely adds pattern)
*[[Medical sampling brush]]

==Cleaning==
[[File:bog_brush.JPG|thumb|right|100px|A toilet brush]]
Brushes used for cleaning come in various sizes, ranging from that of a toothbrush, to the standard household version accompanied by a dustpan, to 36" deck brushes. There are brushes for cleaning tiny cracks and crevices and brushes for cleaning enormous warehouse floors. Brushes perform a multitude of cleaning tasks. For example, brushes lightly dust the tiniest figurine, they help scrub stains out of clothing and shoes, they remove grime from tires, and they remove the dirt and debris found on floors with the help of a dust pan. Specific brushes are used for diverse activities from  cleaning vegetables, as a [[toilet brush]], washing glass, cleaning tiles, and as a mild abrasive for [[sanding]].

In [[telecommunications]], a '''channel bank''' is a device that performs [[multiplexing]] or demultiplexing ("demux") of a group of communications channels, such as analog or digital [[telephone line]]s, into one channel of higher [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] or higher digital [[bit rate]], such as a [[Digital Signal 1|DS-1]] (T1) circuit, so that all the channels can be sent simultaneously over a single cable called a [[Telecommunications link|trunkline]].

A channel bank may be located in a [[telephone exchange]], or in an enterprise's telephone closet or enclosure where it "breaks out" individual telephone lines from a high-capacity telephone trunk line connected to the central telephone office, or the enterprise's [[private branch exchange|PBX]] system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9542">'''Custom-fit''' means [[personalization|personalized]] with regard to shape and size. A customized product would imply the modification of some of its characteristics according to the customers requirements such as with a [[custom car]]. However, when fit is added to the term, customization could give the idea of both the geometric characteristics of the body and the individual customer requirements,&lt;ref&gt;Tuck et al., 2006&lt;/ref&gt; ''e.g.'', the steering wheel of the Formula 1 driver [[Fernando Alonso]].

The custom-fit concept can be understood as the idea of offering one-of-a-kind products that, due to their intrinsic characteristics and use, can be totally adapted to geometric characteristics in order to meet the user requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Anton et al., 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

With this new concept, industry moves from a resource based manufacturing system to a knowledge based manufacturing system and from [[mass production]] to individual production. This encourages the [[Lean manufacturing|Lean Production]] trend as established by Toyota, or in other words, an efficiency-based production.

==Research==
There are some studies referring to the positive impacts this concept would have on society:
* Customised Motorcycle Seats&lt;ref&gt;Ong et al., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* Orthopaedic Profession&lt;ref&gt;Wagner et al., 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The research studies found in February 2008 on the subject are the following:
* Customised Motorcycle and Helmet&lt;ref&gt;Tuck et al., 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* Knee and Manxilo-facial Implants and Prosthetics Sockets&lt;ref&gt;Dolinsek, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical Tools==

===Data Capturing===
The process starts with the capturing of data directly from the user by [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] techniques with the ultimate aim of manufacturing products using [[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]] techniques.

===Process Design and Validation===
* Converting scanned data directly and automatically into final models ready for printing: [[Digital Cad Approach]] and [[Hybrid Approach]].
* Representing Structure for Functionally Graded Material:
# [[Interface Innerspace]] developed by TNO which integrates the RDT Centers in The Netherlands.
# [[Multi Phase Topology Optimisation]], designed by [[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer]] (comparable to TNO in Germany).
# Finite Element Representation [[Finite element analysis]] used by Materialise in Belgium.
* A [[rapid manufacturing]] interface called [[Slice Raster Inteface]], also designed by Materialise.

Although all these developments have been of great interest, the RM-processes have not fallen behind, due to improvement of new Rapid Prototyping [[Direct digital manufacturing]] techniques.

===Rapid Manufacturing Systems, Tools and Materials===
* The Metal Printing Process developed by SINTEF in Norway, produces 3D products with metal powder with different graduation, sintered layer-by-layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rm-platform.com/index.php?option%3Dcom_docman%26task%3Ddoc_download%26gid%3D287 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715191045/http://www.rm-platform.com/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=287 |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MPP aims to become the equivalent of a high speed 3D-printer that produces three-dimensional objects directly from powder materials. This technique is based on the process principles of [[xerographic]] printers, (for example, laser or [[LED printer]]s) that combine electrostatic printing with photography. The MPP process approach uses the same fundamental principles to build solid objects on a layer-by-layer basis. Layers of powder materials are generated by attracting different metal- and/or ceramic powders to their respective position on a charged pattern on a photoreceptor by means of an electrostatic field. The attracted layer is transferred to a punch and transported to the consolidation unit where each layer of part material is sintered onto the previous by pressure and heat. The procedure is repeated layer-by-layer until the three-dimensional object is fully formed and consolidated.

MPP has the ability to print different powders within the same layer and progressively change from one material to another, i.e., producing a functionally graded material. In addition to this, MPP uses external pressure to speed the densification process (sintering), which allows manufacturing with a wide range of materials and opens the possibility to produce unique material combinations and microstructures.

* The High Viscosity [[Inkjet printing]] developed by TNO has the capability of printing with one or more materials with graded structures in a single process using additive technology.

It has several print heads that produce continuous streams of material droplets at high frequency. The High Viscosity Inkjet Printing machine is also capable of printing multi-materials simultaneously and also enables the mixing and grading of materials in any combination that is desired. This will enable the manufacturing of products with two or more materials that are graded and there will be no distinct boundary between the materials. This will result in products with unique mechanical properties.

Dr. Michiel Willemse who is leading the project says, "The process is unique in its capability to print highly viscous, UV curable, resins. Material formulations with viscosities up to 500 mPa•s (at ambient temperature) have been printed successfully. This offers the opportunity to print products with unequaled mechanical properties when compared to any other printing systems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innovations-report.com/html/reports/materials_science/report-100199.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725192316/http://www.innovations-report.com/html/reports/materials_science/report-100199.html |archivedate=2008-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Plastic Powder Printing Process developed by The Monfort University in the United Kingdom is based on the concept of fusing layers of a wide range of plastic powders in the desired combination by laser [[printing]]. PPP aims to develop the equivalent of a high speed [[laser printer]] that produces three-dimensional 3D objects from plastic powder where powder is first deposited by means of laser printing /electrophotography technique and subsequently fused under infrared heating units to make solid layers. Layers are consolidated further to make 3D plastic objects. Various [[thermoplastics|thermoplastic]] toners from standard engineering polymers like [[polyethylene]] (high and low density), [[polypropylene]], and [[polystyrene]] have already been deposited using this technique and later fused with infrared rays to form the layers.

==Career==
In 1982, McCourt founded his first company, McCourt Cable Systems, operating as a designer and builder of cable wires. The company grew to be the largest privately owned designer and builder of cable systems in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘I love doing battle’: The tough guy who made $750m - BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40353198|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, McCourt purchased the first independent TV station within the Caribbean Island of Grenada, Discovery TV.&lt;ref name="irishtimes" /&gt; In 1987, McCourt founded the first competitive phone company in the US, Corporate Communications Network. This was merged with Metropolitan Fibre Systems (MFS) before being sold for $14.3bn to [[MCI Inc.|MCI]] before its eventual bankruptcy as park of Worldcom in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I keep my hands on my money|url=http://www.valueinstitute.org/imgdir/docs/70754_STJan25.pdf|website=Sunday Times|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCourt’s next venture collaborated with engineering and construction firm Peter Kiewit Sons, Inc. From this partnership emerged McCourt/Kiewit International, based in London, which became the largest designer and builder of residential cable television and telephone networks in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.granahanmccourt.com/david-c-mccourt/|title=David C. McCourt: Founder and CEO of Granahan McCourt Capital|website=Granahan McCourt Capital|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCourt was responsible for bringing the first competitive telephone and TV landscape to Mexico. McCourt also brought traditional waiting times for land line phones down from one year to less than thirty days and at a fraction of the cost compared to incumbent suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David C.

In 1993, he acquired control of C-TEC Corporation, a diversified telecommunications company that was recapitalised and split into four publicly traded entities: RCN Corporation; Cable Michigan, Inc.; Mercom, Inc.; and Commonwealth Telephone Enterprises, Inc. The annualized returns of these companies would reach three times the returns of the S&amp;P 500 over the same time period.&lt;ref name="David McCourt net worth"&gt;[http://www.therichest.com/celebnetworth/celebrity-business/entrepreneurs/david-mccourt-net-worth "David McCourt net worth"], TheRichest (website), 2013.

'''Diazomethane''' is the chemical compound CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, discovered by German chemist [[Hans von Pechmann]] in 1894. It is the simplest [[diazo compound]].  In the pure form at room temperature, it is an extremely sensitive explosive yellow [[gas]]; thus, it is almost universally used as a solution in [[diethyl ether]].  The compound is a popular [[methylating agent]] in the laboratory, but it is too hazardous to be employed on an industrial scale without special precautions.&lt;ref name=proctor&gt;{{cite journal|last=Proctor|first=Lee D.|author2=Warr, Antony J.|title=Development of a Continuous Process for the Industrial Generation of Diazomethane|journal=Organic Process Research &amp; Development|date=November 2002|volume=6|issue=6|pages=884–892|doi=10.1021/op020049k}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Use of diazomethane has been significantly reduced by the introduction of the safer and equivalent reagent [[trimethylsilyldiazomethane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Trimethylsilyldiazomethane|authors=Shioiri, Takayuki; Aoyama, Toyohiko; Snowden, Timothy|encyclopedia=e-EROS Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis|year=2001|doi=10.1002/047084289X.rt298.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
For safety and convenience diazomethane is always prepared as needed as a solution in [[diethyl ether|ether]] and used as such. It converts [[carboxylic acid]]s into their [[methyl]] [[ester]]s or into their [[homologous series|homologues]] (see [[Arndt-Eistert synthesis]]). In the [[Büchner–Curtius–Schlotterbeck]] reaction diazomethane reacts with an [[aldehyde]] to form [[ketone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Synthese von Ketonsäureäthern aus Aldehyden und Diazoessigäther | last = Buchner | first = E. | last2 = Curtius | first2 = Th. |journal=Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft| year=1885| volume=18|pages=2371–2377 | doi=10.1002/cber.188501802118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The conversion of aldehydes and ketones through diazomethane| author=Schlotterbeck, F. |journal=Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft| year=1907| volume=40|pages=479–483| doi=10.1002/cber.19070400179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buchner-Curtius-Schlotterbeck Reaction.svg|thumb|center|600px|Büchner-Curtius-Schlotterbeck Reaction.]]

When diazomethane reacts with [[alcohol]]s or [[phenol]]s in presence of [[boron trifluoride]] (BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[methyl]] [[ether]]s are obtained.

Diazomethane is also frequently used as a [[carbene]] source. It readily takes part in [[1,3-dipolar cycloaddition]]s.

==Preparation==
[[Image:Diazomethane preparation - Macro Diazald Kit.jpg|thumb|right|Diazomethane laboratory preparation]]
Diazomethane is prepared by hydrolysis of an ethereal solution of an ''N''-methyl nitrosamide with aqueous base. The traditional precursor is [[N-Nitroso-N-methylurea|''N''-nitroso-''N''-methylurea]], but this compound is itself somewhat unstable, and nowadays compounds such as [[Methylnitronitrosoguanidine|''N''-methyl-''N'''-nitro-''N''-nitrosoguanidine]] (MNNG) and [[Diazald|''N''-methyl-''N''-nitroso-''p''-toluenesulfonamide]] (Diazald) are preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reed|first=Donald E.|author2=James A. Moore|title=DIAZOMETHANE|journal=Organic Syntheses|date=1961|volume=41|page=16|doi=10.15227/orgsyn.041.0016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[File:Diazomethane Synthesis V.1.png|500px|center|thumb|Preparation of Diazomethane.]]

CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with basic solutions of D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to give the deuterated derivative CD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = P. G. Gassman and W. J. Greenlee | title = Dideuterodiazomethane | collvol = 6 | collvolpages = 432 | prep = cv6p0432 | year = 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concentration of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be determined in either of two convenient ways.  It can be treated with an  excess of [[benzoic acid]] in cold Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Unreacted [[benzoic acid]] is then [[back titration|back-titrated]] with standard NaOH.  Alternatively, the concentration of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O can be determined [[Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy|spectrophotometrically]] at 410&amp;nbsp;nm where its [[Molar absorptivity|extinction coefficient]], ε, is 7.2.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}
The gas-phase concentration of diazomethane can be determined using [[photoacoustic spectroscopy]].&lt;ref name=proctor /&gt;

==Related compounds==
Diazomethane is both isomeric and [[isoelectronic]] with the more stable [[cyanamide]], but they cannot interconvert.
Many substituted derivatives of diazomethane have been prepared:
*The very stable (CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (2-diazo-1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoropropane; b.p.&amp;nbsp;12–13&amp;nbsp;°C),&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = W. J. Middleton; D. M. Gale  | title = Bis(Trifluoromethyl)diazomethane | collvol = 6 | collvolpages = 161 | prep = cv6p0161 | year = 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[diazodiphenylmethane]]; m.p.&amp;nbsp;29–30&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = L. I. Smith, K. L. Howard  | title = Diphenyldiazomethane" | collvol = 3 | collvolpages = 351 | prep = cv3p0351 | year = 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shioiri, T. Aoyama, S. Mori  | title = Trimethylsilyldiazomethane | collvol = 8 | collvolpages = 612 | prep = cv8p0612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creary  | title = Tosylhydrazone Salt Pyrolyses: Phenydiazomethanes | collvol = 7 | collvolpages = 438 | year = 1990 | prep = cv7p0438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
Diazomethane is toxic by inhalation or by contact with the skin or eyes (TLV 0.2ppm). Symptoms include chest discomfort, headache, weakness and, in severe cases, collapse.&lt;ref name="HitCL"&gt;Muir, GD (ed.) 1971, ''Hazards in the Chemical Laboratory'', The Royal Institute of Chemistry, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms may be delayed. Deaths from diazomethane poisoning have been reported.  In one instance a laboratory worker consumed a hamburger near a fumehood where he was generating a large quantity of diazomethane, and died four days later from fulminating pneumonia.&lt;ref name="HitC1"&gt;LeWinn, E.B. "Diazomethane Poisoning: Report of a fatal case with autopsy", ''The American Journal of the Medical Sciences'', 1949, 218, 556-562.&lt;/ref&gt; Like any other [[alkylating agent]] it is expected to be carcinogenic, but such concerns are overshadowed by its serious acute toxicity.

CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may explode in contact with sharp edges, such as ground-glass joints, even scratches in glassware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Boer|first1=Th. J.|last2=Backer|first2=H. J.|title=DIAZOMETHANE|journal=Organic Syntheses|date=1956|volume=36|pages=16|doi=10.15227/orgsyn.036.0016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glassware should be inspected before use and preparation should take place behind a blast shield. Specialized kits to prepare diazomethane with flame-polished joints are commercially available.

The compound explodes when heated beyond 100&amp;nbsp;°C, exposed to intense light, alkali metals, or calcium sulfate. Use of a blast shield is highly recommended while using this compound.

Proof-of-concept work has been done with [[microfluidics]], in which continuous point-of-use synthesis from [[N-Nitroso-N-methylurea|N-methyl-N-nitrosourea]] and 0.93M potassium hydroxide in water was followed by point-of-use conversion with [[benzoic acid]], resulting in a 65% yield of the methyl benzoate ester within seconds at temperatures ranging from 0-50 C.  The yield was better than under capillary conditions; the microfluidics were credited with "suppression of hot spots, low holdup, isothermal conditions, and intensive mixing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yUrdAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=SA6-PA15|title=Microreactors in Preparative Chemistry: Practical Aspects in Bioprocessing, Nanotechnology, Catalysis and more|publisher=Wiley|date=2013-09-13|author=Wladimir Reschetilowski|page=6-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Die Neue Sammlung'''  is one of the leading design museums in the world, with the largest collection of industrial and product design.
Established around 100 years ago, Die Neue Sammlung is considered the world’s oldest design museum – regarded as such long before the word ''design'' acquired this meaning. 
Since then, Die Neue Sammlung has been making design history with its international acquisitions and stimulating exhibitions.

With over 100,000 catalogued items, Die Neue Sammlung is among the world’s largest design collections. It is very wide-ranging, with the collection covering over 20 different areas, embracing Product and Industrial Design or Furniture and Graphic Design as well as topics such as Mobility and IT Design. Ceramics and glass are focal areas, as are Jewelry and Appliances, not to mention selected objects in the field of crafted design. 


{{coord|48|08|49|N|11|34|20|E|region:DE-BY_type:landmark_source:dewiki|display=title}}

==History==
Founded in 1907 in line with the ideas of the [[German Werkbund]], it was inaugurated as an official state museum in 1925. From the very beginning it distinguished itself from the museums of arts and crafts of the day by committing firmly to espousing the Modernism of the times and thus contemporary design. To this day, the Neue Sammlung’s agenda pursue those initial objectives.


==Exhibitions (Selection) ==
A typical year will see more than a dozen different exhibitions being staged, covering all areas of the collection. Notable exhibitions of recent years have been:

* 2015: ''Munich | Konstantin Grcic: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly''  &lt;ref&gt;[http://dnstdm.de/en/konstantin-grcic/ Konstantin Grcic: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4502">A '''digital lollipop''' is an electronic device that synthesizes [[virtual taste]]s by stimulating the human tongue with electric currents. The device is capable of producing four of the primary tastes: sweet, sour, salty and bitter. Digital lollipops were developed through research led by Nimesha Ranasinghe at the [[National University of Singapore]].&lt;ref name=Jivanda /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mohney /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ranasinghe /&gt;

== Design ==

According to Ranasinghe, "The system is capable of manipulating the properties of electric currents (magnitude, frequency, and polarity: inverse current) to formulate different stimuli. Currently, we are conducting experiments to analyze regional differences of the human tongue for electrical stimulation."&lt;ref name=Jivanda /&gt;&lt;ref name=Marks /&gt;

The devices generate [[alternating current]] signals through a sliver electrode, stimulating the tongue's taste receptors to emulate the major taste components. It also produces small, varying amounts of heat to simulate food.&lt;ref name=Marks /&gt;

Eventually, the digital lollipop could aid [[Alzheimer's]] patients by helping them "either enhance or suppress certain senses" and may also allow people with [[diabetes]] to experience sweetness without increasing their blood sugar levels.&lt;ref name=Mohney /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chanel /&gt; The National University of Singapore research team is developing Taste Over Internet Protocol (TOIP) that would allow taste information to be communicated between locations.&lt;ref name=Anthony /&gt;

A '''digital signal processor''' ('''DSP''') is a specialized [[microprocessor]] (or a [[System in package|SIP block]]), with its architecture optimized for the operational needs of [[digital signal processing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | editor = Yovits, M.

The goal of DSP is usually to measure, filter or compress continuous real-world [[analog signals]].  Most general-purpose microprocessors can also execute digital signal processing algorithms successfully, but may not be able to keep up with such processing continuously in real-time.  Also, dedicated DSPs usually have better power efficiency, thus they are more suitable in portable devices such as [[mobile phone]]s because of power consumption constraints.&lt;ref name="schaum-2004"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DSPs often use special [[memory architecture]]s that are able to fetch multiple data or instructions at the same time.

==Overview==
[[Image:DSP block diagram.svg|thumb|410px|A typical digital processing system]]

Digital signal processing [[algorithm]]s typically require a large number of mathematical operations to be performed quickly and repeatedly on a series of data samples.  Signals (perhaps from audio or video sensors) are constantly converted from analog to digital, manipulated digitally, and then converted back to analog form. Many DSP applications have constraints on [[latency (engineering)|latency]]; that is, for the system to work, the DSP operation must be completed within some fixed time, and deferred (or batch) processing is not viable.

Most general-purpose microprocessors and operating systems can execute DSP algorithms successfully, but are not suitable for use in portable devices such as mobile phones and PDAs because of power efficiency constraints.&lt;ref name="schaum-2004" /&gt; A specialized digital signal processor, however, will tend to provide a lower-cost solution, with better performance, lower latency, and no requirements for specialised cooling or large batteries.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Such performance improvements have led to the introduction of digital signal processing in commercial [[communications satellite]]s where hundreds or even thousands of analog filters, switches, frequency converters and so on are required to receive and process the [[uplink]]ed signals and ready them for [[downlink]]ing, and can be replaced with specialised DSPs with a significant benefits to the satellites' weight, power consumption, complexity/cost of construction, reliability and flexibility of operation. For example, the SES-12 and SES-14 satellites from operator  [[SES S.A.|SES]], both intended for launch in 2017, are being built by [[Airbus Defence and Space]] with 25% of capacity using DSP.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Beyond Frontiers]]'' Broadgate Publications (September 2016) pp22&lt;/ref&gt; 

The architecture of a digital signal processor is optimized specifically for digital signal processing. Most also support some of the features as an applications processor or microcontroller, since signal processing is rarely the only task of a system. Some useful features for optimizing DSP algorithms are outlined below.

==Architecture==

===Software architecture===

By the standards of general-purpose processors, DSP instruction sets are often highly irregular; while traditional instruction sets are made up of more general instructions that allow them to perform a wider variety of operations, instruction sets optimized for digital signal processing contain instructions for common mathematical operations that occur frequently in DSP calculations. Both traditional and DSP-optimized instruction sets are able to compute any arbitrary operation but an operation that might require multiple ARM or x86 instructions to compute might require only one instruction in a DSP optimized instruction set.

One implication for software architecture is that hand-optimized [[assembly language|assembly-code]] routines are commonly packaged into libraries for re-use, instead of relying on advanced compiler technologies to handle essential algorithms.{{clarify|date=November 2015}} Even with modern compiler optimizations hand-optimized assembly code is more efficient and many common algorithms involved in DSP calculations are hand-written in order to take full advantage of the architectural optimizations.

====Instruction sets====
*[[Multiply–accumulate operation|multiply–accumulates]] (MACs, including [[fused multiply–add]], FMA) operations
**used extensively in all kinds of [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] operations
***[[convolution]] for filtering
***[[dot product]]
***[[Horner scheme|polynomial evaluation]]
**Fundamental DSP algorithms depend heavily on multiply–accumulate performance
***[[Finite impulse response|FIR filters]]
***[[Fast Fourier transform]] (FFT)
*Instructions to increase parallelism:
**[[SIMD]]
**[[VLIW]]
**[[superscalar architecture]]
*Specialized instructions for [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] addressing in [[circular buffer|ring buffers]] and bit-reversed addressing mode for [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]] cross-referencing
*Digital signal processors sometimes use [[time-stationary encoding]] to simplify hardware and increase coding efficiency.
*Multiple arithmetic units may require memory architectures to support several accesses per instruction cycle
*Special loop controls, such as architectural support for executing a few instruction words in a very tight loop without overhead for instruction fetches or exit testing{{clarify|date=November 2015}}

====Data instructions====
*[[Saturation arithmetic]], in which operations that produce overflows will accumulate at the maximum (or minimum) values that the register can hold rather than wrapping around (maximum+1 doesn't overflow to minimum as in many general-purpose CPUs, instead it stays at maximum). Sometimes various sticky bits operation modes are available.
*[[Fixed-point arithmetic]] is often used to speed up arithmetic processing
*Single-cycle operations to increase the benefits of [[pipelining]]

====Program flow====
*[[Floating-point]] unit integrated directly into the [[datapath]]
*[[Pipeline (computing)|Pipelined]] architecture
*Highly parallel [[multiplier–accumulator]]s (MAC units)
*Hardware-controlled [[Control flow#Loops|looping]], to reduce or eliminate the overhead required for looping operations

===Hardware architecture===
In engineering, hardware architecture refers to the identification of a system's physical components and their interrelationships. This description, often called a hardware design model, allows hardware designers to understand how their components fit into a system architecture and provides to software component designers important information needed for software development and integration. Clear definition of a hardware architecture allows the various traditional engineering disciplines (e.g., electrical and mechanical engineering) to work more effectively together to develop and manufacture new machines, devices and components.

Hardware is also an expression used within the computer engineering industry to explicitly distinguish the (electronic computer) hardware from the software that runs on it. But hardware, within the automation and software engineering disciplines, need not simply be a computer of some sort. A modern automobile runs vastly more software than the Apollo spacecraft. Also, modern aircraft cannot function without running tens of millions of computer instructions embedded and distributed throughout the aircraft and resident in both standard computer hardware and in specialized hardware components such as IC wired logic gates, analog and hybrid devices, and other digital components. The need to effectively model how separate physical components combine to form complex systems is important over a wide range of applications, including computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), cell phones, surgical instrumentation, satellites, and submarines.

====Memory architecture====

DSPs are usually optimized for streaming data and use special memory architectures that are able to fetch multiple data or instructions at the same time, such as the [[Harvard architecture]] or Modified [[von Neumann architecture]], which use separate program and data memories (sometimes even concurrent access on multiple data buses).

DSPs can sometimes rely on supporting code to know about cache hierarchies and the associated delays.  This is a tradeoff that allows for better performance{{clarify|date=November 2015}}.  In addition, extensive use of [[Direct memory access|DMA]] is employed.

=====Addressing and virtual memory=====

DSPs frequently use multi-tasking operating systems, but have no support for [[virtual memory]] or memory protection.  Operating systems that use virtual memory require more time for [[context switching]] among [[process (computing)|processes]], which increases latency.

*[[Hardware modulo addressing]]
**Allows [[circular buffer]]s to be implemented without having to test for wrapping
*[[Bit-reversed addressing]], a special [[addressing mode]]
**useful for calculating FFTs
*Exclusion of a [[memory management unit]]
*[[Address generation unit]]

==History==

Prior to the advent of stand-alone DSP chips discussed below, most DSP applications were implemented using [[bit slicing|bit-slice]] processors.  The [[AMD Am2900|AMD 2901]] bit-slice chip with its family of components was a very popular choice. There were reference designs from AMD, but very often the specifics of a particular design were application specific. These bit slice architectures would sometimes include a peripheral multiplier chip. Examples of these multipliers were a series from [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] including the TDC1008 and TDC1010, some of which included an accumulator, providing the requisite [[multiply–accumulate]] (MAC) function.

In 1976, Richard Wiggins proposed the [[Speak &amp; Spell (toy)|Speak &amp; Spell]] concept to Paul Breedlove, Larry Brantingham, and Gene Frantz at Texas Instrument's Dallas research facility.  Two years later in 1978 they produced the first Speak &amp; Spell, with the technological centerpiece being the [[TMS5100]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = IEEE | work = IEEE Milestones | title = Speak &amp; Spell, the First Use of a Digital Signal Processing IC for Speech Generation, 1978 | url = http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Speak_%26_Spell,_the_First_Use_of_a_Digital_Signal_Processing_IC_for_Speech_Generation,_1978 | accessdate = 2012-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the industry's first digital signal processor.  It also set other milestones, being the first chip to use [[Linear predictive coding]] to perform speech synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | author = Bogdanowicz, A. | title = IEEE Milestones Honor Three | url = http://theinstitute.ieee.org/technology-focus/technology-history/ieee-milestones-honor-four476 | work = The Institute | publisher = IEEE | date = 2009-10-06 | accessdate = 2012-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Intel released the 2920 as an "analog signal processor". It had an on-chip ADC/DAC with an internal signal processor, but it didn't have a hardware multiplier and was not successful in the market. In 1979, AMI released the [[AMI S2811|S2811]]. It was designed as a microprocessor peripheral, and it had to be initialized by the host. The S2811 was likewise not successful in the market.

In 1980 the first stand-alone, complete DSPs – the [[Nippon Electric Corporation|NEC]] [[NEC µPD7720|µPD7720]] and [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] [[AT&amp;T DSP1|DSP1]] – were presented at the [[International Solid-State Circuits Conference]] '80. Both processors were inspired by the research in [[Public Switched Telephone Network|PSTN]] [[telecommunication]]s.

The Altamira DX-1 was another early DSP, utilizing quad integer pipelines with delayed branches and branch prediction.{{citation needed|reason=no mention on the web, except of WP text copies and translations|date=December 2014}}

Another DSP produced by [[Texas Instruments]] (TI), the [[Texas Instruments TMS320|TMS32010]] presented in 1983, proved to be an even bigger success. It was based on the Harvard architecture, and so had separate instruction and data memory. It already had a special instruction set, with instructions like load-and-accumulate or multiply-and-accumulate. It could work on 16-bit numbers and needed 390&amp;nbsp;ns for a multiply–add operation. TI is now the market leader in general-purpose DSPs.

About five years later, the second generation of DSPs began to spread. They had 3 memories for storing two operands simultaneously and included hardware to accelerate [[tight loop]]s; they also had an addressing unit capable of [[loop-addressing]]. Some of them operated on 24-bit variables and a typical model only required about 21&amp;nbsp;ns for a MAC. Members of this generation were for example the AT&amp;T DSP16A or the [[Motorola 56000]].

The main improvement in the third generation was the appearance of application-specific units and instructions in the data path, or sometimes as coprocessors. These units allowed direct hardware acceleration of very specific but complex mathematical problems, like the Fourier-transform or matrix operations. Some chips, like the Motorola MC68356, even included more than one processor core to work in parallel. Other DSPs from 1995 are the TI TMS320C541 or the TMS 320C80.

The fourth generation is best characterized by the changes in the instruction set and the instruction encoding/decoding. SIMD extensions were added, and VLIW and the superscalar architecture appeared. As always, the clock-speeds have increased; a 3&amp;nbsp;ns MAC now became possible.

==Modern DSPs==

Modern signal processors yield greater performance; this is due in part to both technological and architectural advancements like lower design rules, fast-access two-level cache, (E)[[Direct memory access|DMA]] circuitry and a wider bus system. Not all DSPs provide the same speed and many kinds of signal processors exist, each one of them being better suited for a specific task, ranging in price from about US$1.50 to US$300.

[[Texas Instruments]] produces the [[TMS320C6000|C6000]] series DSPs, which have clock speeds of 1.2&amp;nbsp;GHz and implement separate instruction and data caches. They also have an 8 MiB 2nd level cache and 64 EDMA channels. The top models are capable of as many as 8000 MIPS ([[instructions per second]]), use VLIW ([[very long instruction word]]), perform eight operations per clock-cycle and are compatible with a broad range of external peripherals and various buses (PCI/serial/etc). TMS320C6474 chips each have three such DSPs, and the newest generation C6000 chips support floating point as well as fixed point processing.

[[Freescale]] produces a multi-core DSP family, the MSC81xx. The MSC81xx is based on StarCore Architecture processors and the latest MSC8144 DSP combines four programmable SC3400 StarCore DSP cores. Each SC3400 StarCore DSP core has a clock speed of 1&amp;nbsp;GHz.

[[XMOS]] produces a multi-core multi-threaded line of processor well suited to DSP operations, They come in various speeds ranging from 400 to 1600 MIPS. The processors have a multi-threaded architecture that allows up to 8 real-time threads per core, meaning that a 4 core device would support up to 32 real time threads. Threads communicate between each other with buffered channels that are capable of up to 80 Mbit/s. The devices are easily programmable in C and aim at bridging the gap between conventional micro-controllers and FPGAs

[[CEVA, Inc.]] produces and licenses three distinct families of DSPs. Perhaps the best known and most widely deployed is the CEVA-TeakLite DSP family, a classic memory-based architecture, with 16-bit or 32-bit word-widths and single or dual [[Multiply–accumulate operation|MACs]]. The CEVA-X DSP family offers a combination of VLIW and SIMD architectures, with different members of the family offering dual or quad 16-bit MACs. The CEVA-XC DSP family targets [[Software-defined radio|Software-defined Radio (SDR)]] modem designs and leverages a unique combination of VLIW and Vector architectures with 32 16-bit MACs.

[[Analog Devices]] produce the [[Super Harvard Architecture Single-Chip Computer|SHARC]]-based DSP and range in performance from 66&amp;nbsp;MHz/198 [[MFLOPS]] (million floating-point operations per second) to 400&amp;nbsp;MHz/2400 MFLOPS. Some models support multiple [[binary multiplier|multiplier]]s and [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]]s, [[SIMD]] instructions and audio processing-specific components and peripherals. The [[Blackfin]] family of embedded digital signal processors combine the features of a DSP with those of a general use processor. As a result, these processors can run simple [[operating system]]s like [[μCLinux]], velOSity and [[Nucleus RTOS]] while operating on real-time data.

[[NXP Semiconductors]] produce DSPs based on [[TriMedia (mediaprocessor)|TriMedia]] [[VLIW]] technology, optimized for audio and video processing. In some products the DSP core is hidden as a fixed-function block into a [[System-on-a-chip|SoC]], but NXP also provides a range of flexible single core media processors. The TriMedia media processors support both [[fixed-point arithmetic]] as well as [[floating-point arithmetic]], and have specific instructions to deal with complex filters and entropy coding.

[[CSR plc|CSR]] produces the Quatro family of SoCs that contain one or more custom Imaging DSPs optimized for processing document image data for scanner and copier applications.

[[Microchip Technology]] produces the PIC24 based dsPIC line of DSPs. Introduced in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-02-04|title=PIC microcontroller|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PIC_microcontroller&amp;oldid=823995404|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the dsPIC is designed for applications needing a true DSP as well as a true [[microcontroller]], such as motor control and in power supplies. The dsPIC runs at up to 40MIPS, and has support for 16 bit fixed point MAC, bit reverse and modulo addressing, as well as DMA.

Most DSPs use fixed-point arithmetic, because in real world signal processing the additional range provided by floating point is not needed, and there is a large speed benefit and cost benefit due to reduced hardware complexity. Floating point DSPs may be invaluable in applications where a wide dynamic range is required. Product developers might also use floating point DSPs to reduce the cost and complexity of software development in exchange for more expensive hardware, since it is generally easier to implement algorithms in floating point.

Generally, DSPs are dedicated integrated circuits; however DSP functionality can also be produced by using [[field-programmable gate array]] chips (FPGAs).

Embedded general-purpose RISC processors are becoming increasingly DSP like in functionality. For example, the [[Texas Instruments OMAP|OMAP3]] processors include a [[ARM Cortex-A8]] and C6000 DSP.

In Communications a new breed of DSPs offering the fusion of both DSP functions and H/W acceleration function is making its way into the mainstream. Such Modem processors include [[ASOCS]] ModemX and CEVA's XC4000.

In May 2018, [[Huarui-2]] designed by [[Nanjing Research Institute of Electronics Technology]] passed acceptance. With a processing speed of 0.4 TFLOPS, the chip can achieve better performance than current mainstream DSP chips&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stdaily.com/index/kejixinwen/2018-06/15/content_681419.shtml|title=国产新型雷达芯片华睿2号与组网中心同时亮相-科技新闻-中国科技网首页|work=[[科技日报]]|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific (DNAP) supplies the [[mining industry]] in Australia, Europe, China, Africa, Turkey, Albania, Romania, Finland, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. In particular, DNAP supplies surface and underground mining in the thermal coal, metallurgical coal, [[iron ore]] and other metals sectors.&lt;ref name="2nd largest in world"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dyno Nobel Shareholders ok 2.5 billion deal|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2008/05/22/dyno-nobel-shareholders-ok-25-billion-deal/|accessdate=22 April 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=22 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainability==
In 2010, Dyno Nobel’s owners, Incitec Pivot Limited, approved a sustainability strategy that extends to workplace health and safety, environmental impacts, resource efficiency, community impact and engagement, as well as labor practices and products and services. In the 2012 Sustainability Report IPL states, ''“Sustainable growth requires us to balance our economic performance with our environmental and social responsibilities which include being a good corporate citizen and operating ethically.”''&lt;ref name="sustainability report" /&gt;

===Health and safety===

In 2012, IPL reported that the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate was 1.45, an increase of 17% from the previous year. In response to this, the IPL Board and Executive Team implemented new positions and structures in the company’s leadership. This was done to support a new [[Health, Safety and Environment]] (HSE) strategy put in place to eliminate [[workplace injuries]], illnesses and environmental incidents.''&lt;ref name="sustainability report" /&gt;

===Environment===
In 2012, IPL established reduction targets for its Australian manufacturing operations for [[greenhouse gas emissions]], [[water use]], [[natural gas]] use for energy, and waste to landfill.  They claim they are working to establish a baseline for future efficiency targets through gathering data from the global operations for [[energy use]], water use and [[waste]]. They investigated the possibility of replacing the current materials used to manufacture [[bulking agents]] with recycled or renewable ones such as [[bio-fuels]] and [[green waste]]. The company carried out trials where [[waste oil]] was used in their fuel phase emulsion explosive product. They also researched ways to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from explosive blasting by using different products or blasting techniques.&lt;ref name="sustainability report" /&gt;

===Recruitment and training===
During 2012, the number of females employed by the company increased from 17% to 21%. The number of female graduates employed through the graduate recruitment programme increased from none in 2012 to five in 2013.&lt;ref name="sustainability report" /&gt; In comparison, the national average for women in the workplace in the United States was 47%(2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in the Labor Force in 2010|url=http://www.dol.gov/wb/factsheets/Qf-laborforce-10.htm|publisher=United States Department of Labor|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 46% in Australia (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in the  Australian Workplace|url=http://parliamentflagpost.blogspot.com/2013/03/women-in-australian-workforce-2013.html|publisher=Parliament Flag Post|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electrodermal activity''' ('''EDA''') is the property of the human body that causes continuous variation in the electrical characteristics of the [[Human skin|skin]]. Historically, EDA has also been known as '''skin conductance''', '''galvanic skin response''' ('''GSR'''), '''electrodermal response''' ('''EDR'''), '''psychogalvanic reflex''' ('''PGR'''), '''skin conductance response''' ('''SCR'''), '''sympathetic skin response''' ('''SSR''') and '''skin conductance level''' ('''SCL'''). The long history of research into the active and passive electrical properties of the skin by a variety of disciplines has resulted in an excess of names, now standardized to '''electrodermal activity''' ('''EDA''').&lt;ref name=Boucsein2012P02&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last1=Boucsein |first1=Wolfram |title=Electrodermal Activity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6N6rnOEZEEoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date=2012 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-1-461-41126-0 |page=2 |accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://nro.sagepub.com/content/8/2/132.abstract|title = Book Review: Electrodermal Responses: What Happens in the Brain|last = Critchley|first = Hugo D.|date = April 2002|journal = The Neuroscientist|doi = 10.1177/107385840200800209|pmid = 11954558|access-date = 15 April 2015|pages = 132–142|quote = Electrodermal activity (EDA) is now the preferred term for changes in electrical conductance of the skin, including phasic changes that have been referred to as galvanic skin responses (GSR)|volume = 8|issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Electrodermal Activity|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0hXrBwAAQBAJ|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date = 2013-04-17|isbn = 9781475750935|first = Wolfram|last = Boucsein|page = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional theory of EDA holds that skin resistance varies with the state of [[sweat gland]]s in the skin. Sweating is controlled by the [[sympathetic nervous system]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Martini | first1 = Frederic | last2 = Bartholomew | first2 = Edwin | title = Essentials of Anatomy &amp; Physiology | publisher = [[Benjamin Cummings]] | location = San Francisco | year = 2001 | page = 263 | isbn = 0-13-061567-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and skin conductance is an indication of psychological or physiological [[arousal]]. If the sympathetic branch of the [[autonomic nervous system]] is highly aroused, then sweat gland activity also increases, which in turn increases skin conductance. In this way, skin conductance can be a measure of emotional and sympathetic responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil|title=Physiology of Behavior|year=2013|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|location=New Jersey|isbn=978-0-205-23939-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research and additional phenomena ([[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]], [[Electric potential|potential]], [[electrical impedance|impedance]], and [[admittance]], sometimes responsive and sometimes apparently spontaneous) suggest that EDA is more complex than it seems, and research continues into the source and significance of EDA.

The study of EDA has led to such important and vital tools as the [[electrocardiograph]] (ECG or EKG) and the [[electroencephalograph]] (EEG).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper |url = https://www.cs.purdue.edu/cgvlab/papers/xmt/flowbio.pdf|title = Flow Visualization for Bioelectric Activity in Human Body|last = Tricoche|first = Xavier|date = 2006|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = 20 April 2015|publisher = The College of Information Sciences and Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1849, [[Emil du Bois-Reymond|Dubois-Reymond]] in [[Germany]] first observed that human skin was electrically active. He immersed the limbs of his subjects in a zinc sulfate solution and found that electric current flowed between a limb with muscles contracted and one that was relaxed. He therefore attributed his EDA observations to muscular phenomena.&lt;ref name=Boucsein2012P03&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boucsein|first1=Wolfram|title=Electrodermal Activity|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781461411260|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6N6rnOEZEEoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty years later, in 1878 in Switzerland, Hermann and Luchsinger demonstrated a connection between EDA and sweat glands.  Hermann later demonstrated that the electrical effect was strongest in the palms of the hands, suggesting that sweat was an important factor.&lt;ref name=Boucsein2012P04&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boucsein|first1=Wolfram|title=Electrodermal Activity|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781461411260|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6N6rnOEZEEoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vigouroux (France, 1879), working with emotionally distressed patients, was the first researcher to relate EDA to psychological activity. In 1888, the French neurologist [[Charles Féré|Féré]] demonstrated that skin resistance activity could be changed by emotional stimulation and that activity could be inhibited by drugs.&lt;ref name="Boucsein2012P04"/&gt;

In 1889 in Russia, [[Ivane Tarkhnishvili]] observed variations in skin electrical potentials in the absence of any external stimuli, and he developed a meter to observe the variations as they happened in real time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Society for Neuroscience |author-link=Society for Neuroscience |title=SfN 2010 - Nano, Theme H, Featured Lectures, Special Lectures, Symposia/Minisymposia, Workshops, Satellites, and Socials |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JvDNN9z3PWgC&amp;pg=PT25 |date=2011 |publisher=Coe-Truman Technologies |isbn=978-161-330001-5 |access-date=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology (eds. Gianfranco Denes, Luigi Pizzamiglio). Psychology Press, 1999. {{ISBN|9780863775420}}. Page 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific study of EDA began in the early 1900s. One of the first references to the use of EDA instruments in [[psychoanalysis]] is the book by [[C. G. Jung]] entitled ''Studies in Word Analysis'', published in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sonoma.edu/users/d/daniels/junglect.html|title = Notes on Carl Gustav Jung|date = |accessdate = 4 April 2015|website = Sonoma State University|publisher = Sonoma State University|last = Daniels|first = Victor|quote=By 1906 [Jung] was using GSR and breath measurement to note changes in respiration and skin resistance to emotionally charged worlds.

The controversial Austrian psychoanalyst [[Wilhelm Reich]] also studied EDA in his experiments at the Psychological Institute at the University of Oslo, in 1935 and 1936, to confirm the existence of a bio-electrical charge behind his concept of vegetative, pleasurable "streamings".&lt;ref&gt;Reich, W. "Experimentelle Ergebnisse ueber die electrische Funktion von Sexualitat und Angst" (Sexpolverlag, Copenhagen, 1937). Translated as "Experimental investigation of the electrical function of sexuality and anxiety" in Journal of Orgonomy, Vol. 3, No. 1-2, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1972, more than 1500 articles on electrodermal activity had been published in professional publications, and today EDA is regarded as the most popular method for investigating human [[psychophysiological]] phenomena.&lt;ref name="Boucsein2012P07"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boucsein|first1=Wolfram|title=Electrodermal Activity|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781461411260|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6N6rnOEZEEoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, EDA monitoring was still on the increase in clinical applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ogorevc|first1=Jaka|last2=Geršak|first2=Gregor|last3=Novak|first3=Domen|last4=Drnovšek|first4=Janko|title=Metrological evaluation of skin conductance measurements|journal=Measurement|date=November 2013|volume=46|issue=9|pages=2993–3001|doi=10.1016/j.measurement.2013.06.024|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263224113002571|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Skin conductance is not under conscious control. Instead, it is modulated autonomously by sympathetic activity which drives human behavior, cognitive and emotional states on a subconscious level. Skin conductance, therefore, offers direct insights into autonomous emotional regulation.&lt;ref name="What is GSR"&gt;{{Cite article|title = What is GSR|url = https://imotions.com/blog/gsr/|publisher=iMotions A/S|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human extremities, including fingers, palms, and soles of feet display different bio-electrical phenomena.They can be detected with an EDA meter, a device that displays the change [[electrical conductance]] between two points over time. The two current paths are along the surface of the skin and through the body. Active measuring involves sending a small amount of current through the body.{{Citation needed|date = April 2015}}

Some studies include the human skin's response to alternating current, including recently deceased bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Electrodermal activity by DC potential and AC conductance measured simultaneously at the same skin site|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0846.2010.00459.x/abstract|journal = Skin Research and Technology|date = 2011-02-01|issn = 1600-0846|pages = 26–34|volume = 17|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0846.2010.00459.x|first = Sverre|last = Grimnes|first2 = Azar|last2 = Jabbari|first3 = Ørjan G.|last3 = Martinsen|first4 = Christian|last4 = Tronstad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physiological basis===
There is a relationship between emotional arousal and [[parasympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] activity, although the electrical change alone does not identify which specific emotion is being elicited. These autonomic sympathetic changes alter sweat and blood flow, which in turn affects GSR and GSP. The amount of sweat glands varies across the human body, being highest in hand and foot regions (200–600 sweat glands per cm2).&lt;ref name="What is GSR"/&gt; The response of the skin and muscle tissue to external and internal [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] can cause the conductance to vary by several [[siemens (unit)|microsiemens]]. A correctly calibrated device can record and display the subtle changes.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pflanzer|first=Richard|title=Galvanic Skin Response and the Polygraph|url=http://www.vhlab.umn.edu/~bmen3701/Documents/Biopac9.pdf|publisher=BIOPAC Systems, Inc.|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combined changes between electrodermal resistance and electrodermal potential make up electrodermal activity. '''Galvanic skin resistance''' (GSR) is an older term that refers to the recorded electrical resistance between two electrodes when a very weak current is steadily passed between them. The electrodes are normally placed about an inch apart, and the resistance recorded varies according to the emotional state of the subject. '''Galvanic skin potential''' (GSP) refers to the voltage measured between two electrodes without any externally applied current. It is measured by connecting the electrodes to a voltage amplifier. This voltage also varies with the emotional state of the subject.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;

====Examples====
A painful stimulus such as a pinprick elicits a [[parasympathetic nervous system|sympathetic response]] by the sweat glands, increasing secretion. Although this increase is generally very small, sweat contains water and electrolytes, which increase electrical conductivity, thus lowering the electrical resistance of the skin. These changes in turn affect GSR. Another common manifestation is the vasodilation (dilation) of blood vessels in the face, referred to as blushing, as well as increased sweating that occurs when one is embarrassed.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;

EDA is highly responsive to emotions in some people. Fear, anger, startled response, orienting response, and sexual feelings are among the reactions that may be reflected in EDA. These responses are utilized as part of the [[polygraph]] or lie detector test.

EDA in regular subjects differs according to feelings of being treated fairly or unfairly, but [[psychopaths]] have been shown to manifest no such differences.&lt;ref&gt;Oshumi, T., Ohira, H. "The positive side of psychopathy: Emotional detachment in psychopathy and rational decision-making in the ultimatum game". Personality and Individual Differences 49, 2010, pp. 451-456&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that the EDA record of a polygraph may be deceptive in a criminal investigation.

==Uses==
EDA is a common measure of autonomic nervous system activity, with a long history of being used in psychological research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mendes |first=Wendy Berry |authorlink=Wendy Berry Mendes |editor1-last=Harmon-Jones |editor1-first=E. |editor1-link=Eddie Harmon-Jones |editor2-last=Beer |editor2-first=J. |title=Methods in Social Neuroscience |chapter=Assessing Autonomic Nervous System Activity |url=http://wendyberrymendes.com/cms/uploads/Mendes%20-%20Autonomic%20nervous%20sys.pdf |date=2009 |location=New York |publisher=[[Guilford Press]] |isbn=978-1-606-23040-4 |access-date=October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hugo D. Critchley, Chair of Psychiatry at the [[Brighton and Sussex Medical School]] states, "EDA is a sensitive [[psychophysiological]] index of changes in autonomic sympathetic arousal that are integrated with emotional and cognitive states."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Critchley|first1=Hugo D.|title=Book Review: Electrodermal Responses: What Happens in the Brain|journal=Neuroscientist|date=April 2002|volume=8|issue=2|pages=132–142|doi=10.1177/107385840200800209|url=http://nro.sagepub.com/content/8/2/132.abstract|accessdate=27 April 2015|pmid=11954558}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[biofeedback]] therapy devices utilize EDA as an indicator of the user's stress response with the goal of helping the user to control anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Alterman |first=Ben |title=Services Provided |url=http://www.neurobehavioralservices.com/services.php?id=8 |date= |accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; EDA is used to assess an individual's neurological status without using traditional, but uncomfortable and expensive, EEG-based monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Birjandtalab|first=J.|last2=Cogan|first2=D.|last3=Pouyan|first3=M. B.|last4=Nourani|first4=M.|date=2016-10-01|title=A Non-EEG Biosignals Dataset for Assessment and Visualization of Neurological Status|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7780081/|journal=2016 IEEE International Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)|pages=110–114|doi=10.1109/SiPS.2016.27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oftentimes, EDA monitoring is combined with the recording of heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure, because they are all autonomically dependent variables. EDA measurement is one component of modern polygraph devices, which are often used as lie detectors.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;

The [[E-meter]] used by the [[Church of Scientology]] as part of its practice of "[[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]]" and "[[List of Scientology security checks|security checking]]", is a custom EDA measurement device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Possible problems==
External factors such as temperature and humidity affect EDA measurements, which can lead to inconsistent results. Internal factors such as medications and hydration can also change EDA measurements, demonstrating inconsistency with the same stimulus level. Also, the classic understanding has treated EDA as if it represented one homogeneous change in arousal across the body, but in fact different locations of its measurement can lead to different responses; for example, the responses on the left and right wrists are driven by different regions of the brain, providing multiple sources of arousal; thus, the EDA measured in different places on the body varies not only with different sweat gland density but also with different underlying sources of arousal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Multiple Arousal Theory|url = http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1754073914565517 |journal = Emotion Review |date = 2016|first = Rosalind|last = Picard|first2=Szymon|last2=Fedor|first3=Yadid|last3=Ayzenberg|volume = 8|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electronic Case Filing System (ECFS)''' is an automated system developed in [[Tarrant County]], [[Texas]] that enables law enforcement agencies, criminal district attorney, county criminal courts, criminal district courts, and the defense bar to process and exchange information about criminal offenses.  ECFS software does not work on the Apple Mac platform.

== History ==

ECFS was conceived in November 2002 in [[Tarrant County]], [[Texas]]. Initially, the purpose of the system was to enable law enforcement agencies to submit offense reports to the criminal district attorney's office for possible prosecution. In July 2003, the Criminal District Attorney's accepted the first electronic case filing via ECFS.  Since that time, more than 100,000 cases have been filed in ECFS by the 47 Law Enforcement Agencies located in Tarrant County, Texas. ECFS was expanded in June 2004 to incorporate the Grand Jury function which is able to return Indictments to the Criminal District Courts on the same day that a True Bill is decided.

In January 2005, ECFS was extended to enable the Judges and their Court Staff to effectively manage the docket (case load) for each of the nine (9) Criminal District Courts. Since the implementation of ECFS, Tarrant County has been able to control the Jail population, despite a significant increase in the number of cases being filed. In August 2005, ECFS was extended to enable members of the Tarrant County Criminal Defense Lawyers Association to browse and view defendant, offense, and evidence via ECFS. Through this process, defense attorneys are no longer required to visit the Criminal District Attorney's Office to view and copy file.

Since January 2006, the Criminal District Attorney's Office has been completely paperless and all Offense Reports are submitted via ECFS and made available to Law Enforcement Agencies, County and District Courts, and Defense Attorneys. In July 2006, ECFS was extended to allow criminal defendants to be masgistrated electronically.  This process also allows the Office of Attorney appointments to be notified that the defendant has requested that defense counsel be appointed which triggers a business process that captures financial information, facilitates a determination of indigency, and when appropriate appoints defense counsel.

In 2005, the Tarrant County Criminal Defense Lawyer's Association, a non-profit charitable association, implemented its own software design to enable all attorney's, whether members of TCCDLA or not, to access the ECFS system.  The software only works on PCs and will not work on Apple's Mac platform. The process enables an attorney to access his or her case files from any computer on the World Wide Web, and is secure and reliable. TCCDLA has continuously revised its software process to enable access 24-7, with little down time. TCCDLA also installed computers in the Tarrant County Justice Center that allow subscribers to access files while in the courthouse. Storm's Edge Technologies is the computer software company that exclusively provides support and design of the TCCDLA ECFS access system.

'''Eurosignal''' was a European [[paging system]] in operation between 1974 and 1997. Transmissions were broadcast between 87.3 and 87.5 [[megahertz|MHz]] in [[FM broadcasting|FM]], so that their characteristic [[modulation]]s could be heard on mainstream FM radio receivers.

== History ==
Eurosignal was introduced in Germany in 1974, France in 1975, and Switzerland in 1985. In France and Switzerland, transmissions were stopped on 31 December 1997 and 1 April 1998, respectively.

== Operation ==

=== Utilization ===
A receiver could handle up to four phone numbers. It included an acoustic signal and four optical signals that indicated which of the four numbers called. Eurosignal did not allow other transmissions; the actual four telephone numbers had to be established previously, and use of the signal was limited to telephones. Eurosignal numbers were [[unlisted number|not listed in a directory]] in order to limit abuse. Eurosignal had a major advantage over other [[radiotelephone]] networks due to its costs, which were about 10% of ordinary phone lines. It also enjoyed a larger coverage area compared to [[FM radio]].

=== Broadcast network ===
Data was transmitted by radio [[VHF]]. The following four channels were used.

* Channel A: 87.340&amp;nbsp;MHz
* Channel B: 87.365&amp;nbsp;MHz
* Channel C: 87.390&amp;nbsp;MHz
* Channel D: 87.415&amp;nbsp;MHz

Germany used channels A and B, France used all four, and Switzerland used only channel D. The distribution network was composed of terrestrial transmitters with power of up to 2 kilowatts.

=== Modulation ===
Eurosignal was based on audio transmissions, at first using [[amplitude modulation]], and later using frequency modulation. In general, each digit of the phone number produced a particular frequency. Thus, the number 123456 resulted in the issuance of the frequencies f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6. If a number was repeated, its second occurrence was replaced by a particular frequency indicating repetition, fr. For example, the number 111111 was encoded by f1, fr, f1, fr, f1, fr. Two phone numbers were separated by the frequency fi for at least 0.22 seconds, with a time per called number of 0.82 seconds.

The frequencies used were as follows:
{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! Meaning !! Notation !! Frequency
|-
| Number 0|| f &lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|| 979.8&amp;nbsp;Hz
|-
| Number 1|| f &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|| 903.1&amp;nbsp;Hz
|-
| Number 2|| f &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|| 832.5&amp;nbsp;Hz
|-
| Number 3|| f &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;|| 767.4&amp;nbsp;Hz
|-
| Number 4|| f &lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;|| 707.4&amp;nbsp;Hz
|-
| Number 5|| f &lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;|| 652.0&amp;nbsp;Hz
|-
| Number 6|| f &lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; || 601.0&amp;nbsp;Hz
|-
| Number 7|| f &lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; || 554.0&amp;nbsp;Hz
|-
| Number 8|| f &lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; || 510.7&amp;nbsp;Hz
|-
| Number 9|| f &lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; || 470.8&amp;nbsp;Hz
|-
| Free|| f &lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; || 1,153.1&amp;nbsp;Hz
|-
| Repeat || f &lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; || 1,062.9&amp;nbsp;Hz
|-
|}

===In Popular Culture===

The distinctive audio tones of Eurosignal were sampled by the French [[electronica]] duo [[Air (band)|Air]] on their 1996 single b-side ''Les Professionnels'', now available on their compilation album ''[[Premiers Symptômes]]'' (1997).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6171">A '''flash ADC''' (also known as a '''direct-conversion ADC''') is a type of [[analog-to-digital converter]] that uses a linear [[voltage ladder]] with a [[comparator]] at each "rung" of the ladder to compare the input voltage to successive reference voltages. Often these reference ladders are constructed of many [[resistor]]s; however, modern implementations show that capacitive voltage division is also possible. The output of these comparators is generally fed into a digital encoder, which converts the inputs into a binary value (the collected outputs from the comparators can be thought of as a [[Unary numeral system|unary]] value).

==Benefits and drawbacks==
Flash converters are extremely fast compared to many other types of ADCs, which usually narrow in on the "correct" answer over a series of stages. Compared to these, a flash converter is also quite simple and, apart from the analog comparators, only requires [[Digital electronics|logic]] for the final conversion to [[binary numeral system|binary]].

For best accuracy, often a [[Sample and hold|track-and-hold]] circuit is inserted in front of the ADC input. This is needed for many ADC types (like [[successive approximation ADC]]), but for flash ADCs there is no real need for this, because the comparators are the sampling devices.

A flash converter requires a huge number of [[comparator]]s compared to other ADCs, especially as the precision increases. A flash converter requires &lt;math&gt;2^n-1&lt;/math&gt; comparators for an ''n''-bit conversion. The size, power consumption and cost of all those comparators makes flash converters generally impractical for precisions much greater than 8 bits (255 comparators). In place of these comparators, most other ADCs substitute more complex [[digital circuit|logic]] and/or analog circuitry that can be scaled more easily for increased [[Accuracy and precision|precision]].

==Implementation==
[[File:Flash ADC.png|thumb|right|350px|A 2-bit flash ADC example implementation with bubble error correction and digital encoding]]

Flash ADCs have been implemented in many technologies, varying from silicon-based [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]] (BJT) and complementary metal–oxide [[field-effect transistor|FETs]] ([[CMOS]]) technologies to rarely used [[List of semiconductor materials|III-V]] technologies. Often this type of ADC is used as a first medium-sized analog circuit verification.

The earliest implementations consisted of a reference ladder of well matched resistors connected to a reference voltage. Each tap at the [[resistor ladder]] is used for one comparator, possibly preceded by an [[Amplifier|amplification]] stage, and thus generates a logical 0 or 1 depending on whether the measured voltage is above or below the [[reference voltage]] of the [[resistor tap]]. The reason to add an amplifier is twofold: it amplifies the voltage difference and therefore suppresses the comparator offset, and the kick-back noise of the comparator towards the reference ladder is also strongly suppressed. Typically designs from 4-bit up to 6-bit and sometimes 7-bit are produced.

Designs with power-saving capacitive reference ladders have been demonstrated. In addition to clocking the comparator(s), these systems also sample the reference value on the input stage. As the sampling is done at a very high rate, the leakage of the capacitors is negligible.

Recently, offset calibration has been introduced into flash ADC designs. Instead of high-precision analog circuits (which increase component size to suppress variation) comparators with relatively large offset errors are measured and adjusted. A test signal is applied, and the offset of each comparator is calibrated to below the [[Least significant bit|LSB]] value of the ADC.

Another improvement to many flash ADCs is the inclusion of digital error correction.  When the ADC is used in harsh environments or constructed from very small integrated circuit processes, there is a heightened risk that a single comparator will randomly change state resulting in a wrong code.  Bubble error correction is a digital correction mechanism that prevents a comparator that has, for example, tripped high from reporting logic high if it is surrounded by comparators that are reporting logic low.

==Folding ADC==
The number of comparators can be reduced somewhat by adding a folding circuit in front, making a so-called ''folding ADC''.  Instead of using the comparators in a flash ADC only once, during a ramp input signal, the folding ADC re-uses the comparators multiple times. If a ''m''-times folding circuit is used in an ''n''-bit ADC, the actual number of comparator can be reduced from &lt;math&gt;2^n-1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\frac{2^n}{m}&lt;/math&gt; (there is always one needed to detect the range crossover). Typical folding circuits are the [[Gilbert Cell|Gilbert multiplier]] and analog [[OR gate#Wired-OR|wired-OR]] circuits.

==Application==
The very high [[sample rate]] of this type of ADC enables high-frequency applications (typically in a few GHz range) like [[radar]] detection, [[Ultra-wideband|wideband radio]] receivers, [[electronic test equipment]], and [[optical communication]] links. More often the flash ADC is embedded in a large [[Integrated circuit|IC]] containing many digital decoding functions.

Also a small flash ADC circuit may be present inside a [[delta-sigma modulation]] loop.

Flash ADCs are also used in [[NAND flash]] memory, where up to 3 bits are stored per [[Memory cell (computing)|cell]] as 8 voltages level on floating gates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1256">'''Floating raft''' is type of land-based [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]] that protects against settlement and [[soil liquefaction|liquefaction]] of soft soil from seismic activity. It was a necessary innovation in the development of [[skyscrapers|tall buildings]] in the wet soil of [[Chicago]] in the 19th century, when it was developed by [[John Wellborn Root]] who came up with the idea of interlacing the concrete slab with steel beams. The earliest precursor to the modern version may be the concrete rafts developed for the building of [[Millbank Prison]] in 1815 by [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]].

For a floating raft foundation – or simply "floating foundation" – the foundation has a volume such that, if that volume filled with soil, it would be equal in weight to the total weight of the structure.

When the soil is so soft that not even [[friction pile]]s will support the [[building load]], these types of foundation are the final option and makes the building behave like a boat: obeying [[Archimedes' principle]], buoyed up by the weight of the earth displaced in creating the foundation.

A '''gas meter prover''' is a device which verifies the accuracy of a [[gas meter]].  Provers are typically used in gas meter repair facilities, municipal gas meter shops, and public works shops.  Provers work by passing a known volume of air through a meter while monitoring the gas meters register, index, or internal displacement. The prover then displays a proof, a value expressed as a percent which compares the volume of air passed with the volume of air measured to determine the meters [[accuracy]].

== Types ==

=== Manual bell prover ===
Since the early 1900s, bell provers have been the most common [[reference standard]] used in gas meter proving, and has provided standards for the gas industry that is unfortunately susceptible to a myriad of immeasurable uncertainties.

A bell prover (commonly referred to in the industry as a "bell") consists of a vertical inner tank surrounded by an outer shell. A space between the inner tank and outer shell is filled with a sealing liquid, usually oil.  An inverted tank, called the bell, is placed over the inner tank.  The liquid provides an [[air-tight]] seal.  Bell provers are typically [[counterweight]]ed to provide [[positive pressure]] through a hose and valve connected to a meter. Sometimes rollers or guides are installed on the moving part of the bell which allows for smooth linear movement without the potential for immeasurable pressure differentials caused by the bell rocking back or forth.

Bells provide a volume of air that may be predetermined by calculated temperature, pressure and the effective diameter of the bell.  Bell scales are unique to each bell and are usually attached vertically with a needle-like pointer.  When proving a meter using a manually controlled bell, an operator must first fill the bell with a controlled air supply or raise it manually by opening a valve and pulling a chained mechanism, seal the bell and meter and check the sealed system for leaks, determine the flow rate needed for the meter, install a special flow-rate cap on the meter outlet, note the starting points of both the bell scale and meter index, release the bell valve to pass air through the meter, observe the meter index and calculate the time it takes to pass the predetermined amount of air, then manually calculate the meter's proof accounting for bell air and meter [[temperature]] and in some cases other environmental factors.

Uncertainties commonly experienced, and possibly unaccounted for within a test when using bell provers can lead to incorrect proofs, by which an operator may adjust a gas meter incorrectly.  Temperature inconsistencies between the bell air, meter and connecting hoses can account for most meter proof inaccuracies.  Other factors may be mechanical such as stuck or sticky bell rollers or guides, loose piping connections or valves, a dent in the test area of the bell, incorrect counterweights, and human errors in the operation or calculations.

=== Automated bell prover ===
The invention of [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLC) allowed gas meter repair facilities to automate most of the manual bell prover's process and calculations.  Instead of manually raising and lowering the bell prover, [[solenoid valve]]s connected to a PLC control air flows through the meter.  Temperature, [[pressure]], and [[humidity]] sensors can be used to feed data into an automated bell PLC, and calculations for meter proofs can be handled by a computer or electronic device programmed for such a purpose.  In the early 1990s, the PLC was replaced by PACs (Programmable Automated Controls) and modern computer systems. Sensors to read the index of a meter were added to further automate the process, removing much of the human error associated with manual bell provers.

=== Sonic nozzle prover ===
The natural evolution of the automated bell and PAC controls led itself to the use of [[vacuum]] driven provers with arrays of sonic nozzles (utilizing [[choked flow]] to provide precise flow rates. Such a use eliminated the need for a bell, as the flow rate is provided through the nozzles. When sufficient vacuum is applied to a sonic nozzle it creates a constant flow rate.  [[Bernoulli's principle]] is applied to calculate the chosen flow rates chosen by the user or automated by a computer.  Computers and PAC systems automate the process, and most sonic nozzle provers are capable of displaying not only meter proofs to a user, but are also capable of transmitting proofs as well as other important data to database systems across a computer network.

The '''harmonic mixer''' and '''subharmonic mixer''' are a type of [[frequency mixer]], which is a circuit that changes one signal frequency to another. The ordinary mixer has two input signals and one output signal. If the two input signals are sinewaves at frequencies ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then the output signal consists of frequency components at the sum ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and difference ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;minus;''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; frequencies. In contrast, the harmonic and subharmonic mixers form sum and difference frequencies at a harmonic multiple of one of the inputs. The output signal then contains frequencies such as ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+''kf''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;minus;''kf''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; where ''k'' is an integer.

==Background==
The classic frequency mixer is a multiplier.  Multiplying two sinewaves produces just the sum and difference frequencies; the input frequencies are suppressed, and, in theory, there are no other heterodyne products.  In practice, the multiplier is not perfect, and the input frequencies and other heterodyne products will be present.

An actual multiplier is not needed. The significant requirement is a nonlinearity, and at microwave frequencies it is easier to use a nonlinearity rather than an ideal multiplier. A Taylor series expansion of a nonlinearity will show multiplications that give rise to the desired higher order products.

Design goals for mixers seek to select the desired heterodyne products and suppress the undesired ones.

Diode mixers.

Overdriven diode bridge mixers. Drive signal looks like odd harmonic waveform (essentially a square wave).

==Harmonic mixer==
One classic design for a harmonic mixer uses a [[step recovery diode]] (SRD).&lt;ref name="8411A"&gt;{{Citation |title=8410B Network Analyzer; 8411A Harmonic Frequency Converter |year=1968 |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |id=08410-90521 |doi= }}. RF input is 0.11 to 18.0&amp;nbsp;GHz; LO 62 to 154&amp;nbsp;MHz; output 20.278&amp;nbsp;MHz. See page 8-39. For step recovery circuit and power spectra, see page 8-35.&lt;/ref&gt; The mixer's subharmonic input is first amplified to a power level that might be around 1&amp;nbsp;watt. That signal then drives a step recovery diode impulse generator circuit that turns the sine wave into something approximating an impulse train. The resulting impulse train has the harmonics of the input sine wave present to a high frequency (such as 18&amp;nbsp;GHz). The impulse train can then be used with a diode mixer (also called a sampler).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Grove |first=Wayne M. |title=A DC TO 12.4 GHz Feedthrough Sampler for Oscilloscopes and Other RF Systems |date=October 1966 |journal=Hewlett-Packard Journal |volume=18 |issue=2 |url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1966-10.pdf |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The SRD usually has a very high frequency multiplication ratio, and can be used as the basis of a comb receiver, monitoring several harmonically related frequencies at once. This forms the basis of many simple 'bug detectors' where the intention is to detect transmission on any frequency, even if not known in advance. (This is not the same as a [[Rake receiver|'rake' receiver]] which is a correlation device.)

When the required frequency multiple is lower, such as doubling, tripling or quadrupling, then Schottky diode circuits are more common. The conduction angle can be adjusted by changing drive level or temperature, and determines which part of the I/V curve is used and therefore the relative strengths of the different harmonically related outputs. If an even multiple is desired then an anti-parallel pair of diodes will suppress the odd local oscillator contribution, to the level that the diodes can be made identical and experience the same source impedance. Unlike a normal mixer, there is a fairly clear optimum drive level, above which the conversion loss increases.

A harmonic mixer can be used to avoid the complexity of generating a microwave local oscillator, and is common as a simple and reliable frequency extender to a low frequency design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lea.hamradio.si/~s53mv/spectana/hc.html An example home made spectrum analyzer using harmonic mixer techniques]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=harmonic converters|url=https://www.hittite.com/content/documents/subharmonic_mixers_for_high_capacity_millimeterwave_radios.pdf|publisher=hittite}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Subharmonic mixers (a particular form of harmonic mixer where the LO is provided at a sub multiple of the frequency to be mixed with the incoming signal) are often used in direct-digital, or [[zero IF receiver|zero IF]], communications system in order to eliminate the unwanted effects of LO self-mixing which occurs in many fundamental frequency mixers.

Used in [[frequency synthesizer]]s and [[network analyzer (electrical)|network analyzer]]s.

A variation on the subharmonic mixer exists that has two switching stages is used to improved mixer gain in a direct downconversion receiver. The first switching stage mixes a received RF signal to an intermediate frequency that is one-half the received RF signal frequency. The second switching stage mixes the intermediate frequency to baseband. By connecting the two switching stages in series, current is reused and harmonic content from the first stage is fed into the second stage thereby improving the mixer gain.

The '''History of construction''' overlaps many other fields like [[structural engineering]] and relies on other branches of science like [[archaeology]], [[history]] and [[architecture]] to investigate how the builders lived and recorded their accomplishments. Those fields allow us to analyse [[Construction|constructed]] [[building]]s and other [[non-building structure|structures]] built since [[prehistory]], the tools used and the different uses of building materials.

History of building is evolving by different trends in time, marked by few key principles : durability of the materials used, the increasing of height and span, the degree of control exercised over the interior environment and finally the energy available to the construction process.&lt;ref name="Swenson" &gt;[https://jmir3.no.sapo.pt/Ebook2/History.of.Building_Britannica.Parte_1de%202.pdf Alfred Swenson and Pao-Chi Chang, "History of Building"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronological development==

===Neolithic construction===
{{commons category|Neolithic reconstructions}}[[File:Dwelling made with mammoth bones.jpg|thumb|A reconstruction of a pit-house type dwelling made with mammoth bones|left]]
''Neolithic'', also known as the ''New Stone Age'', was a time period roughly from 9000 BC to 5000 BC named because it was the last period of the age before wood working began. The tools available were made from natural materials including [[Bone tool|bone]], antler, hide, [[Stone tool|stone]], wood, grasses, animal fibers, and the use of water. These tools were used by people to cut such as with the [[hand axe]], [[Chopper (archaeology)|chopper]], [[adze]], and [[Celt (tool)|celt]]. Also to [[Scraper (archaeology)|scrape]], chop such as with a [[flake tool]], pound, pierce, roll, pull, leaver, and carry.

Building materials included bones such as [[mammoth]] ribs, [[Hide (skin)|hide]], stone, metal, bark, bamboo, clay, [[lime plaster]], and more. For example, the first [[bridge]]s made by humans were probably just wooden logs placed across a stream and later [[timber trackway]]s. In addition to [[Cave dweller|living in caves]] and [[rock shelter]]s, the first buildings were simple shelters, [[tent]]s like the Inuit's [[tupiq]], and [[hut (dwelling)|huts]] sometimes built as [[pit-house]]s meant to suit the basic needs of protection from the elements and sometimes as fortifications for safety such as the [[crannog]]. Built [[self-sufficiency|self-sufficiently]] by their inhabitants rather than by specialist builders, using locally available materials and traditional designs and methods which together are called [[vernacular architecture]].

The very simplest shelters, tents, leave no traces. Because of this, what little we can say about very early construction is mostly conjecture and based on what we know about the way nomadic hunter-gatherers and herdsmen in remote areas build shelters today. The absence of metal tools placed limitations on the materials that could be worked, but it was still possible to build quite elaborate stone structures with ingenuity using [[dry stone]] walling techniques such as at [[Skara Brae]] in Scotland, Europe's most complete Neolithic village. The first [[Mudbrick|mud bricks]], formed with the hands rather than wooden moulds, belong to the late Neolithic period and were found in [[Jericho]]. One of the largest structures of this period was the [[Neolithic long house]]. In all cases of [[Timber framing|timber framed]] and [[Log building|log]] structures in these very early cultures, only the very lowest parts of the walls and [[post hole]]s are unearthed in archaeological excavations, making [[Experimental archaeology|reconstruction]] of the upper parts of these buildings largely conjectural.

[[File:Pfahlbaumuseum Unteruhldingen Steinzeitdorf Sipplingen Ringpalisade mit Wehrgang 2010 04 10.jpg|thumb|A reconstruction of a neolithic fortified village showing a [[palisade]] wall and [[stilt house]]s at the [[Pfahlbau Museum Unteruhldingen]], Germany.]][[Neolithic architecture]] ranges from the tent to the [[megalith]] (an arrangement of large stones) and [[rock-cut architecture]] which are frequently temples, tombs, and dwellings. The most remarkable Neolithic structure in Western Europe is the iconic megalith known as [[Stonehenge]], regarded by some archaeologists as displaying methods of timber construction such as at [[woodhenge]] translated into stone,&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, Richard, ''Stonehenge'' Penguin Books 1956&lt;/ref&gt; a process known as [[Classical architecture#Petrification|petrification]]. The now ruinous remains are of [[post and lintel]] construction and include massive sandstone lintels which were located on supporting uprights by means of [[mortise and tenon]] joints; the lintels themselves being end-jointed by the use of [[tongue and groove]] joints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sussingstonehenge.wordpress.com/2012/06/02/why-was-stonehenge-constructed-with-those-woodwork-joints-mortise-and-tenon-tongue-in-groove/ A paper showing the joints used at Stonehenge]&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence of prefabrication of the stonework; the symmetrical geometric arrays of stone clearly indicate that the builders of Stonehenge had mastered sophisticated [[surveying]] methods.&lt;ref name="Johnson, Anthony 2008"&gt;Johnson, Anthony, ''Solving Stonehenge: The New Key to an Ancient Enigma''. (Thames &amp; Hudson, 2008) {{ISBN|978-0-500-05155-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neolithic villages large enough to have rural and urban features are called [[proto-city|proto-cities]] to distinguish them from cities beginning with [[Eridu]].

==Copper Age and Bronze Age construction==
[[File:Archaeological site of Akrotiri - Museum of prehistoric Thera - Santorini - bronze saw - 01.jpg|thumb|A bronze saw from the archaeological site of Akrotiri - Museum of prehistoric Thera - Santorini, Greece. Image: Norbert Nagel / Wikimedia Commons]]
The [[Copper Age]] is the early part of the [[Bronze Age]]. Bronze is made when tin is added to copper and brass is copper with zinc. Copper came into use before 5,000 BC and bronze around 3,100 BC, although the times vary by region. Copper and bronze were used for the same types of tools as stone such as axes and chisels, but the new, less brittle, more durable material cut better. Bronze was cast into desired shapes and if damaged could be recast. A new tool developed in the copper age is the [[saw]]. Other uses of copper and bronze were to "harden" the cutting edge of tools such as the Egyptians using copper and bronze points for working soft stone including quarrying blocks and making rock-cut architecture.

During the Bronze Age the [[corbelled arch]] came into use such as for [[beehive tomb]]s. The wheel came into use but was not common until much later. Heavy loads were moved on boats, sledges (a primitive sled) or on rollers. The Egyptians began building stone temples with the [[post and lintel]] construction method and the Greeks and Romans followed this style.

==Iron Age construction==
{{expand section|date=April 2014}}
The Iron Age is a cultural period from roughly 1200 BC to 50 BC with the widespread use of iron for tools and weapons. Iron is not much harder than bronze but by adding carbon iron becomes [[steel]] which was being produced after about 300 BC. Steel can be hardened and [[Tempering (metallurgy)|tempered]] producing a sharp, durable cutting edge. A new woodworking tool allowed by the use of steel is the [[Plane (tool)|hand-plane]].

=== Ancient Mesopotamia===
The earliest large-scale buildings for which evidence survives have been found in ancient [[Mesopotamia]]. The smaller dwellings only survive in traces of foundations, but the later civilizations built very sizeable structures in the forms of palaces, temples and [[ziggurat]]s and took particular care to build them out of materials that last, which has ensured that very considerable parts have remained intact. Major technical achievement is evidenced by the construction of great cities such as [[Uruk]] and [[Ur]]. The [[Ziggurat of Ur]] is an outstanding building of the period, despite major reconstruction work. Another fine example is the ziggurat at [[Chogha Zanbil]] in modern Iran. Cities created demands for new technologies such as drains for animal and human sewage and paved streets.

Archaeological evidence has shown the existence of pitched-brick [[vault (architecture)|vault]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jtsa.edu/Documents/pagedocs/JANES/1982%2014/Kawami14.pdf Trudy S. Kawami, "Parthian Brick Vaults in Mesopotamia, Their Antecedents and Descendants" Columbia University]&lt;/ref&gt; s such as at [[Tell al-Rimah]] in what is now Iraq.

====Materials====
The chief building material was the [[mud-brick]], formed in wooden moulds similar to those used to make [[adobe]] bricks. Bricks varied widely in size and format from small bricks that could be lifted in one hand to ones as big as large paving slabs. Rectangular and square bricks were both common. They were laid in virtually every bonding pattern imaginable and used with considerable sophistication. Drawings survive on clay tablets from later periods showing that buildings were set out on brick modules. By 3500&amp;nbsp;BC, fired [[brick]]s came into use and surviving records show a very complex division of labour into separate tasks and trades.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Fired bricks and stone were used for [[Pavement (architecture)|pavement]].

Life in general was governed by complex ritual and this extended to rituals for setting-out buildings and moulding the first bricks. Contrary to popular belief the [[arch]] was not invented by the Romans, but was used in these civilizations.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} The later Mesopotamian civilizations, particularly [[Babylon]] and thence [[Susa]], developed glazed brickwork to a very high degree, decorating the interiors and exteriors of their buildings with glazed brick reliefs, examples of which survive in the Tehran archaeological museum, the [[Louvre]] Museum in Paris and the [[Pergamon Museum]] in Berlin.

===Ancient Egypt===

[[File:Rekhmire-tomb-drawing-furniture.jpg|thumb|A copy of a wall painting in the tomb of [[Rekhmire]] between 1550 and 1292 BC.]]
As opposed to the cultures of ancient Mesopotamia which built in brick, the pharaohs of Egypt built huge structures in stone. The arid climate has preserved much of the ancient buildings.

====Materials====
[[Adobe]] (sun-baked [[mud brick]]) construction was used for ancillary buildings and normal houses in ancient times and is still commonly used in rural Egypt. The hot, dry climate was ideal for mud-brick, which tends to wash away in the rain. The [[Ramesseum]] in [[Thebes, Egypt]] (Luxor) provides one of the finest examples of [[mud brick]] construction. Extensive storehouses with mud-brick vaults also survive, all constructed with sloping courses to avoid the need for formwork.

The grandest buildings were constructed in stone, often from massive masonry blocks. The techniques used to move massive blocks used in pyramids and temples have been subject to extensive debate. Some authors have suggested that the larger may not be cut stone but fabricated with concrete.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

====Technology====
{{main|Ancient Egyptian technology}}
Although the Egyptians achieved extraordinary feats of engineering, they appear to have done so with relatively primitive technology. As far as is known they did not use wheels or pulleys. They transported massive stones over great distances using rollers, ropes and sledges hauled by large numbers of workers. The ancient Egyptians are credited with inventing the [[Inclined plane|ramp]], [[lever]], [[lathe]], [[oven]], [[ship]], [[paper]], irrigation system, window [[awning]], [[door]], [[glass]], a form of plaster of Paris, the bath, lock, [[shadoof]], [[weaving]], a standardized measurement system, geometry, silo, a method of drilling stone, saw, steam power, proportional scale drawings, enameling, veneer, plywood, rope [[truss]], and more. There are no surviving Egyptian manuals so there has been considerable speculation on how stones were lifted to great heights and obelisks erected. Most theories centre on the use of ramps.

[[Imhotep]], who lived circa 2650–2600 BC, is credited with being the first recorded architect and engineer.

====Achievements====
The [[pyramid]]s are chiefly impressive for their enormous size and the staggering manpower that must have been employed in their construction. The largest is the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] which remained the tallest structure in the world for 3800 years (see [[List of tallest freestanding structures in the world]]). The engineering problems involved were chiefly to do with the transport of blocks, sometimes over long distances, their movement into location and exact alignment. It is now generally agreed that the skilled building workers were respected and well treated, but undoubtedly very large numbers of labourers were necessary to provide the brute force.

The methods used in the construction of the pyramids have been the subject of considerable research and discussion (see: [[Egyptian pyramid construction techniques]]).

{{Further|Architecture of ancient Greece|List of ancient architectural records|List of ancient Greek and Roman roofs}}
The [[ancient Greeks]], like the Egyptians and the Mesopotamians, tended to build most of their common buildings out of mud brick, leaving no record behind them. However many structures do survive, some of which are in a very good state of repair, although some have been partly reconstructed or re-erected in the modern era. The most dramatic are the [[Greek Temple]]s. The Greeks made many advances in [[Ancient Greek technology|technology]] including plumbing, the spiral staircase, central heating, urban planning, the water wheel, the crane, and more.

The oldest "construction drawing" is in the Temple of Apollo at [[Didyma]]. An unfinished stone wall was etched with the profiles of columns and moldings, and the wall was never finished so the drawing was not erased: a rare glimpse into the history of working construction drawings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://jmir3.no.sapo.pt/Ebook2/History.of.Building_Britannica.Parte_1de%202.pdf Alfred Swenson and Pao-Chi Chang (Britannica), "The History of Building Construction]&lt;/ref&gt;

No timber structures survive (roofs, floors etc.), so our knowledge of how these were put together is limited. The spans are, in the main, limited and suggest very simple beam and post structures spanning stone walls. For the longer spans it is uncertain if the Greeks or Romans invented the [[truss]] but the Romans certainly used [[timber roof truss]]es. Before 650 B.C.E. the now famous [[ancient Greek temple]]s were built of wood, but after this date began to be built of stone.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Norman. Living in ancient Greece. New York, N.Y.: Chelsea House Publishers, 2009. 24. {{ISBN|0816063397}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of a timber structure being repeated in stone is called [[Classical architecture#Petrification|petrification]]&lt;ref&gt;Strickland, Carol, and Amy Handy. ''The Annotated Arch: A Crash Course in the History of Architecture''. Kansas City, MO: Andrews McMeel Pub., 2001. 12. {{ISBN|0740710249}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "petrified carpentry".

Fired clay was mainly restricted to [[Tile#Roof tiles|roofing tiles]] and associated decorations, but these were quite elaborate. The roof tiles allow a low [[roof pitch]] characteristic of ancient Greek architecture. Fired bricks began to be employed with [[lime mortar]]. Very prominent buildings were roofed in stone tiles, which mimicked the form of their [[terracotta]] counterparts. While later cultures tended to construct their stone buildings with thin skins of finished stones over rubble cores, the Greeks tended to build out of large cut blocks, joined with metal cramps. This was a slow, expensive and laborious process which limited the number of buildings that could be constructed. The metal cramps often failed through corrosion.

Building structures mostly used a simple beam and column system without vaults or arches, which based strict limits on the spans that could achieved. However, the Greeks did construct some [[groin vault]]s, [[arch bridge]]s and, with the Egyptians, the first "high rise", the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].

Greek mathematics was technically advanced and we know for certain that they employed and understood the principles of [[pulley]]s, which would have enabled them to build [[Derrick|jibs]] and cranes to lift heavy stonework to the upper parts of buildings. Their surveying skills were exceptional, enabling them to set out the incredibly exact optical corrections of buildings like the [[Parthenon]], although the methods used remain a mystery. Simpler decoration, such as fluting on columns, was simply left until the drums of the columns were cut in place.

The ancient Greeks never developed the strong mortars which became an important feature of Roman construction.

===Roman Empire===
{{Further|Roman engineering|Concrete Revolution|Roman technology}}
[[File:Roemerkran.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[treadwheel crane]] at [[Bonn]], Germany]]
[[File:Planes tools roman.jpg|thumb|The hand plane developed in the Iron Age and was known to be used by the Romans. These Roman planes were found in Germany and date to the 1st to 3rd century AD]]In striking contrast to previous cultures, an enormous amount is known about Roman building construction. A very large amount survives, including complete intact buildings like the [[Pantheon, Rome]] and very well preserved ruins at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. We also have the first surviving treatise on architecture by [[Vitruvius]] which includes extensive passages on construction techniques.

====Materials====
The great Roman development in building materials was the use of [[hydraulic lime]] mortar called [[Roman cement]]. Previous cultures had used lime mortars but by adding volcanic ash called a [[pozzolana]] the mortar would harden under water. This provided them with a strong material for bulk walling. They used brick or stone to build the outer skins of the wall and then filled the cavity with massive amounts of [[concrete]], effectively using the brickwork as permanent shuttering (formwork). Later they used wooden shuttering that was removed for the concrete to cure.

An example of a temple made of Roman concrete in the 1st century BC is the [[Temple of Vesta, Tivoli|Temple of Vesta]] in Tivoli, Italy. The concrete was made of nothing more than rubble and mortar. It was cheap and very easy to produce and required relatively unskilled labour to use, enabling the Romans to build on an unprecedented scale. They not only used it for walls but also to form [[arch]]es, [[barrel vaults]] and [[dome]]s, which they built over huge spans. The Romans developed systems of hollow pots for making their domes and sophisticated heating and ventilation systems for their thermal baths. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}.

The Romans substituted bronze for wood in the roof truss(s) of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon's portico]] which was commissioned between 27 BC and 14 AD. The bronze trusses were unique but in 1625 [[Pope Urban VIII]] had the trusses replaced with wood and melted the bronze down for other uses. The Romans also made bronze roof tiles

Lead was used for roof covering material and water supply and waste pipes. The Latin name for lead is ''plumbum'' thus ''plumbing''. Romans also made use of glass in construction with colored glass in mosaics and clear glass for windows. Glass came to be fairly commonly used in windows of public buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://jmir3.no.sapo.pt/Ebook2/History.of.Building_Britannica.Parte_1de%202.pdf "The History of Building"]&lt;/ref&gt; Central heating in the form of a [[hypocaust]], a raised floor heated by the exhaust of a wood or coal fire.

====Organisation of labour====
The Romans had trade guilds. Most construction was done by [[slave]]s or free men. The use of slave labour undoubtedly cut costs and was one of the reasons for the scale of some of the structures. The Romans placed a considerable emphasis in building their buildings extremely fast, usually within two years. For very large structures the only way this could be achieved was by the application of vast numbers of workers to the task.

====Technology====
The invention of the waterwheel, [[sawmill]], arch, and were by the Romans. The Romans also began using [[History of glass|glass]] for architectural purposes after about 100 CE and used double glazing as [[insulated glazing]]. [[Roman roads]] included [[corduroy road]]s and paved roads, sometimes supported on raft or pile foundations and bridges. 
Vitruvius gives details of many Roman machines. The Romans developed sophisticated timber cranes allowing them to lift considerable weights to great heights. The upper limit of lifting appears to have been about 100 tonnes. Trajan's column in Rome contains some of the largest stones ever lifted in a Roman building, and engineers are still uncertain exactly how it was achieved.

A list of the longest, highest and deepest Roman structures can be found in the [[List of ancient architectural records]].
Roman building ingenuity extended over [[bridge]]s, [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]]s, and covered [[amphitheatre]]s. Their sewerage and water-supply works were remarkable and some systems are still in operation today. The only aspect of Roman construction for which very little evidence survives is the form of timber roof structures, none of which seem to have survived intact. Possibly, triangulated roof trusses were built, this being the only conceivable way of constructing the immense spans achieved, the longest exceeding 30 metres (see [[List of Ancient Greek and Roman roofs]]).

===China===
{{expand section|date=April 2014}}
[[File:CHINESE SAWYERS.jpg|thumb|The Far East used a different method of sawing logs than the West's method of [[Whipsaw|pit-sawing]] with a [[saw pit]]: The concept is the same but as shown here the log is angled and no pit is used.]]
China is a cultural hearth area of eastern Asia, many [[Far East]] building methods and styles evolved from China. A famous example of Chinese construction is the [[Great Wall of China]] built between the 7th and 2nd centuries BC. The Great Wall was built with [[rammed earth]], stones, and wood and later bricks and tiles with lime mortar. Wooden gates blocked passageways. The oldest archaeological examples of mortise and tenon type woodworking joints were found in China dating to about 5000 BC.

The [[Yingzao Fashi]] is the oldest complete technical manual on Chinese architecture. The Chinese followed the state rules for thousands of years so many of the ancient, surviving buildings were built with the methods and materials still used in the 11th century. Chinese temples are typically wooden timber frames on an earth and stone base. The oldest wooden building is the [[Nanchan Temple (Wutai)]] dating from 782 CE. However, Chinese temple builders regularly rebuild the wooden temples so some parts of these ancient buildings are of different ages. Traditional Chinese timber frames do not use trusses but rely only on [[post and lintel]] construction. An important [[architectural element]] are the [[dougong]] bracket sets. The [[Songyue Pagoda]] is the oldest brick pagoda dating to 523 AD. It was built with yellow fired bricks laid in clay mortar, with twelve sides and fifteen levels of roofs. The [[Anji Bridge]] is the worlds oldest "open-spandrel stone segmental arch bridge" built in 595-605 AD. The bridge is built with sandstone joined with dovetail, iron joints.

Most of the (restored) Great Wall sections we see today were built with bricks, and cut stone blocks/slabs. Where bricks and blocks weren't available, tamped earth, uncut stones, wood, and even reeds were used as local materials.
Wood was used for forts and as an auxiliary material. Where local timber wasn't enough, they had it delivered in.
====Stone Great Wall Sections====
In mountain areas, workers quarried stone to build the Great Wall. Using the mountains themselves as footings, the outer layer of the Great Wall was built with stone blocks (and bricks), and filled with uncut stone and anything else available (like earth and dead workers).
====Soil Great Wall Sections====
On the plains Great Wall workers made use of local soil (sand, loess, etc.) and rammed it into compact layers. Jiayuguan's Great Wall section in west China was mainly built with dusty loess soil — "the most erodible soil on the planet". It's amazing that sections 2,000 years old still remain mostly intact!
====Sand (and Reed/Willow) Great Wall Sections====
Sand doesn't stick together, so how could a wall be built with sand? Sand was used as a fill material between reed and willow layers.

West China around Dunhuang is desert. Innovative builders there made use of reeds and willow brought in from rivers and oases to build a strong wall. Jade Gate Pass (Yumenguan) Great Wall Fort was built with 20-cm layers of sand and reed, an impressive 9 meters high.

====Brick Great Wall Sections====

The Ming Dynasty Great Wall was mostly built with bricks. To build a strong wall with bricks, they used lime mortar. Workers built brick and cement factories with local materials near the wall.

==Middle ages==
{{Further|Medieval technology|Vault (architecture)}}
The [[Middle Ages]] of Europe span from the 5th to 15th centuries AD from the fall of the Western Roman Empire to the [[Renaissance]] and is divided into [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque]] and Romanesque periods.

[[Fortification]]s, [[castle]]s and [[Architecture of cathedrals, basilicas and abbey churches|cathedrals]] were the greatest construction projects. The Middle Ages began with the end of the Roman era and many Roman building techniques were lost. But some Roman techniques, including the use of iron ring-beams, appear to have been used in the Palatine Chapel at Aachen, c. 800 AD, where it is believed builders from the Langobard Kingdom in northern Italy contributed to the work.&lt;ref&gt;Stephany, Erich ''Der Dom zu Aachen (Aachen Cathedral)'' Arend und Ortmann, Aachen, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; A revival of stone buildings in the 9th century and the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style of architecture began in the late 11th century. Also notable are the stave churches in Scandinavia.[[File:VillardButtressReims.jpg|thumb|right|[[Villard de Honnecourt]]'s drawing of a flying buttress at [[Notre-Dame de Reims|Reims]], ca. AD 1320–1335 ([[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque nationale]])]]

===Materials===
Most buildings in Northern Europe were constructed of timber until c. 1000 AD. In Southern Europe adobe remained predominant. Brick continued to be manufactured in Italy throughout the period 600–1000 AD but elsewhere the craft of brick-making had largely disappeared and with it the methods for [[Encaustic tile|burning tiles]]. Roofs were largely thatched. Houses were small and gathered around a large communal [[hall]]. Monasticism spread more sophisticated building techniques. The [[Cistercians]] may have been responsible for reintroducing brick-making to the area{{clarify|date=April 2014}} from the Netherlands, through Denmark and Northern Germany to Poland leading to [[Backsteingotik]]. Brick remained the most popular prestige material in these areas throughout the period.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Elsewhere buildings were typically in timber or where it could be afforded, stone. Medieval stone walls were constructed using cut blocks on the outside of the walls and rubble infill, with weak [[lime mortar]]s. The poor hardening properties of these mortars were a continual problem, and the settlement of the rubble filling of Romanesque and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] walls and piers is still a major cause for concern.

===Design===
There were no standard textbooks on building in the Middle Ages. Master craftsmen transferred their knowledge through apprenticeships and from father to son. Trade secrets were closely guarded, as they were the source of a craftsman's livelihood. Drawings only survive from the later period. Parchment was too expensive to be commonly used and paper did not appear until the end of the period. Models were used for designing structures and could be built to large scales. Details were mostly designed at full size on tracing floors, some of which survive.

===Labour===
In general, medieval buildings were built by paid workers. Unskilled work was done by labourers paid by the day. Skilled craftsmen served apprenticeships or learned their trade from their parents. It is not clear how many women were members of a guild holding a monopoly on a  particular trade in a defined area (usually within the town walls). Towns were in general very small by modern standards and dominated by the dwellings of a small number of rich nobles or merchants, and by cathedrals and churches.

===Techniques===
[[File:Kizhi church 1.jpg|thumb|right|Church in [[Kizhi]], Russia is listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[world heritage site]] as a building constructed entirely out of wood, in the [[log building]] technique]]
Romanesque buildings of the period 600–1100 AD{{clarify|date=April 2014}} were entirely roofed in timber or had stone barrel vaults covered by timber roofs. The Gothic style of architecture with its [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]], [[flying buttresses]] and pointed [[Lancet arch|gothic arches]] developed in the twelfth century, and in the centuries that followed ever more incredible feats of constructional daring were achieved in stone. Thin stone vaults and towering buildings were constructed using rules derived by trial and error. Failures were frequent, particularly in difficult areas such as [[crossing tower]]s.

The [[pile driver]] was invented around 1500.

===Achievements===
The scale of fortifications and [[castle]] building in the Middle Ages was remarkable, but the outstanding buildings of the period were the Gothic cathedrals with thin masonry vaults and walls of glass. Outstanding examples are: [[Beauvais Cathedral]], [[Chartres Cathedral]], [[King's College Chapel]] and [[Notre Dame, Paris]].

==Renaissance==
{{Further|Renaissance Architecture}}
The [[Renaissance]] in Italy, the invention of [[moveable type]] and the [[Reformation]] changed the character of building. The rediscovery of Vitruvius had a strong influence. During the Middle Ages buildings were designed by the people that built them. The master mason and master carpenters learnt their trades by word of mouth and relied on experience, models and rules of thumb to determine the sizes of building elements. Vitruvius however describes in detail the education of the perfect architect who, he said, must be skilled in all the arts and sciences. [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] was one of the first of the new style of architects. He started life as a goldsmith and educated himself in Roman architecture by studying ruins. He went on to engineer the dome of [[Santa Maria del Fiore]] in Florence.

===Materials===
The major breakthroughs in this period were to do with the technology of conversion. Water mills in most of western Europe were used to saw timber and convert trees into planks. Bricks were used in ever increasing quantities. In Italy the brickmakers were organised into guilds although the kilns were mostly in rural areas because of the risk of fire and easy availability of firewood and brickearth. Brickmakers were typically paid by the brick, which gave them an incentive to make them too small. As a result, legislation was laid down regulating the minimum sizes and each town kept measures against which bricks had to be compared. An increasing amount of ironwork was used in roof carpentry for straps and tension members. The iron was fixed using forelock bolts. The screw-threaded bolt (and nut) could be made and are found in clockmaking in this period, but they were labour-intensive and thus not used on large structures. Roofing was typically of terracotta roof tiles. In Italy they followed Roman precedents. In northern Europe plain tiles were used. Stone, where available, remained the material of choice for prestige buildings.

===Design===
{{Original research|section|date=July 2013}}The rebirth of the idea of an architect in the Renaissance radically changed the nature of building design. The Renaissance reintroduced the classical style of architecture. Leon Battista Alberti's treatise on architecture raised the subject to a new level, defining architecture as something worthy of study by the aristocracy. Previously it was viewed merely as a technical art, suited only to the artisan. The resulting change in status of architecture and more importantly the architect is key to understanding the changes in the process of design. The Renaissance architect was often an artist (a painter or sculptor) who had little knowledge of building technology but a keen grasp of the rules of classical design. The architect thus had to provide detailed drawings for the craftsmen setting out the disposition of the various parts. This was what is called the process of design, from the Italian word for drawing. Occasionally the architect would get involved in particularly difficult technical problems but the technical side of architecture was mainly left up to the craftsmen. This change in the way buildings were designed had a fundamental difference on the way problems were approached. Where the Medieval craftsmen tended to approach a problem with a technical solution in mind, the Renaissance architects started with an idea of what the end product needed to look like and then searched around for a way of making it work. This led to extraordinary leaps forward in engineering.

===Labour===
[[File:Brunelleshi-and-Duomo-of-Florence.png|thumb|right|'''The structure of the dome of Florence cathedral ''', showing the double skin structure]]
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Tower of Babel (Vienna) - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]'s ''Tower of Babel'', illustrating construction techniques of the 16th century]]
Labour in the Renaissance was much the same as in the Middle Ages: buildings were built by paid workers. Unskilled work was done by labourers paid by the day. Skilled craftsmen served apprenticeships or learned their trade from their parents. Craftsmen were organized in [[guild]]s which provided a limited form of building regulation in return for members of the guild holding a monopoly on a  particular trade in a defined area (usually within the town walls). Towns were in general very small by modern standards and dominated by the dwellings of a small number of rich nobles or merchants and cathedrals and churches.

===Technical advances===
The wish to return to classical architecture created problems for the Renaissance buildings. The builders did not use concrete and thus comparable vaults and domes had to be replicated in brick or stone. The greatest technical feats were undoubtedly in these areas. The first major breakthrough was Brunelleschi's project for the [[dome]] of [[Santa Maria del Fiore]]. Brunelleschi managed to devise a way of building a huge dome without formwork, relying instead on the weight of the bricks and the way they were laid to keep them in position and the shape of the dome to keep it standing. The exact way the dome was built is still subject to debate today as it is not possible to take the dome apart to study its construction without destroying it. The dome is a double skin, linked by ribs, with a series of wooden and stone chains around it at intervals to attempt to deal with hoop stresses.

Brunelleschi's dome was completed (up to the base of the lantern) in 1446. Its size was soon surpassed by the dome of St Peter's, built using flying scaffolding supported on the cornices and constructed using two stone shells.

==The seventeenth century==
The seventeenth century saw the birth of modern science which would have profound effects on building construction in the centuries to come. The major breakthroughs were towards the end of the century when architect-engineers began to use experimental science to inform the form of their buildings. However it was not until the eighteenth century that engineering theory developed sufficiently to allow sizes of members to be calculated. Seventeenth-century structures relied strongly on experience, rules of thumb and the use of scale models.

===Materials and tools===
The major breakthrough in this period was in the manufacture of [[glass]], with the first cast plate glass being developed in France. Iron was increasingly employed in structures. [[Christopher Wren]] used iron hangers to suspend floor beams at [[Hampton Court Palace]], and iron rods to repair [[Salisbury Cathedral]] and strengthen the dome of [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Most buildings had stone [[ashlar]] surfaces covering [[Core-and-veneer|rubble cores]], held together with lime mortar. Experiments were made mixing lime with other materials to provide a hydraulic mortar, but there was still no equivalent of the Roman concrete. In England, France and the Dutch Republic, cut and gauged brickwork was used to provide detailed and ornate facades. The triangulated roof truss was introduced to England and used by [[Inigo Jones]] and [[Christopher Wren]].

Many tools have been made obsolete by modern technology, but the [[Ruler|line gauge]], [[plumb-line]], the [[Steel square|carpenter's square]], the [[spirit level]], and the [[Compass (drafting)|drafting compass]] are still in regular use.

===Methods===
Despite the birth of experimental science, the methods of construction in this period remained largely medieval. The same types of crane that had been used in previous centuries were still being employed. Flying scaffolds were employed at St Paul's Cathedral, England and in the dome of St Peters, Rome, but otherwise the same types of timber scaffolding that had been in use centuries before were retained. Cranes and scaffolding depended on timber. Complex systems of pulleys allowed comparatively large loads to be lifted, and long ramps were used to haul loads up to the upper parts of buildings.

==The eighteenth century==
The eighteenth century saw the development of many the ideas that had been born in the late seventeenth century. The architects and engineers became increasingly professionalised. Experimental science and mathematical methods became increasingly sophisticated and employed in buildings. At the same time the birth of the industrial revolution saw an increase in the size of cities and increase in the pace and quantity of construction.

===Materials===
The major breakthroughs in this period were in the use of iron (both cast and wrought). Iron columns had been used in Wren's designs for the House of Commons and were used in several early eighteenth-century churches in London, but these supported only galleries.  In the second half of the eighteenth century the decreasing costs of iron production allowed the construction of major pieces of iron engineering. The Iron Bridge at Coalbrookdale (1779) is a particularly notable example. Large-scale mill construction required fire-proof buildings and cast iron became increasingly used for columns and beams to carry brick vaults for floors. The Louvre in Paris boasted an early example of a wrought-iron roof. Steel was used in the manufacture of tools but could not be made in sufficient quantities to be used for building.

Brick production increased markedly during this period. Many buildings throughout Europe were built of brick, but they were often coated in lime render, sometimes patterned to look like stone. Brick production itself changed little. Bricks were moulded by hand and fired in kilns no different to those used for centuries before. Terracotta in the form of [[Coade stone]] was used as an artificial stone in the UK.

==The nineteenth century: Industrial Revolution==
The [[industrial revolution]] was manifested in new kinds of [[transportation]] installations, such as [[railway]]s, [[canal]]s and [[macadam]] roads. These required large amounts of [[investment]]. New construction devices included [[steam engine]]s, [[machine tools]], [[explosives]] and optical [[surveying]]. The steam engine combined with two other technologies which blossomed in the nineteenth century, the circular saw and machine cut nails, lead to the use of [[Framing (construction)#Balloon|balloon framing]] and the decline of traditional [[timber framing]].&lt;ref&gt;Upton, Dell. ''Architecture in the United States''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998. 153. {{ISBN|019284217X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[steel]] was mass-produced from the mid-19th century, it was used, in form of [[I-beam]]s and [[reinforced concrete]]. [[Glass]] panes also went into mass production, and changed from luxury to every man's property.

[[Plumbing]] appeared, and gave common access to [[drinking water]] and [[Sanitary sewer|sewage collection]].

[[Building code]]s have been applied since the 19th century, with special respect to [[fire safety]].

==The twentieth century==
[[File:Woolworth Building 2 Feb. 1912 LC-USZ62-105567.jpg|thumb|[[Woolworth Building]] under construction in 1912]]
[[File:Old timer structural worker2.jpg|thumb|A structural worker on the [[Empire State Building]]. Workers such as this man were often referred to as "old timers" because in that time era, most men working on building structures were middle-aged.]]
[[File:Burj dubai aerial closeup.jpg|thumb|[[Burj Khalifa]], the world's tallest building, was finished in 2010.]]
With the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] in the early 20th century, [[elevator]]s and [[crane (machine)|cranes]] made [[high rise]] buildings and [[skyscraper]]s possible, while [[Heavy equipment (construction)|heavy equipment]] and [[power tools]] decreased the workforce needed. Other new technologies were [[prefabrication]] and [[computer-aided design]].

[[Trade union]]s were formed to protect construction workers' interests and [[occupational safety and health]]. [[Personal protective equipment]] such as [[hard hats]] and [[earmuffs]] also came into use, and have become mandatory at most sites.

From the 20th century, governmental construction projects were used as a part of [[macroeconomic]] stimulation policies, especially during the [[Great depression]] (see [[New Deal]]). For [[economy of scale]], whole suburbs, towns and cities, including infrastructure, are often planned and constructed within the same project (called [[megaproject]] if the cost exceeds US$1 billion), such as [[Brasília]] in Brazil, and the [[Million Programme]] in Sweden.

In the end of the 20th century, [[ecology]], [[energy conservation]] and [[sustainable development]] have become more important issues of construction.

==Academic discipline==
There is no established [[academic discipline]]  of construction history but a growing number of researchers and academics are working in this field, including structural engineers, archaeologists, architects, historians of technology and [[architectural historian]]s. Although the subject has been studied since the Renaissance and there were a number of important studies in the nineteenth century, it largely went out of fashion in the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Addis. ''Building: 3000 years of Design Engineering and Construction''. Phaidon. 2007. p. 632&lt;/ref&gt; In the last thirty years there has been an enormous increase in interest in this field, which is vital to the growing practice of building conservation.&lt;ref&gt;A.Becchi, M.Corradi, F.Foce &amp; O. Pedemonte (eds.). ''Construction History: Research Perspectives in Europe''. Associazione Eduardo Benvenuto. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early writers===
The earliest surviving book detailing historical building techniques is the treatise of the Roman author, [[Vitruvius]], but his approach was neither scholarly nor systematic. Much later, in the [[Renaissance]], [[Vasari]] mentions [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s interest in researching Roman building techniques, although if he wrote anything on the subject it does not survive. In the seventeenth century, Rusconi's illustrations for his version of [[Leon Battista Alberti]]'s treatise explicitly show Roman wall construction but most of the interest in antiquity was in understanding its proportions and detail and the architects of the time were content to build using current techniques. While early archaeological studies and topographic works such as the engravings of [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]] show [[Roman architecture|Roman]] construction they were not explicitly analytical and much of what they do show is made up.

===Nineteenth-century studies===
In the nineteenth century, lecturers increasingly illustrated their lectures with images of building techniques used in the past and these type of images increasingly appeared in construction text books, such as Rondelet's. The greatest advances however were made by English and French (and later German) architects attempting to understand, record and analyse Gothic buildings. Typical of this type of writing are the works of [[Robert Willis (engineer)|Robert Willis]] in England, Viollet-le-Duc in France and Ungewitter in Germany. None of these however were seeking to suggest that the history of construction represented a new approach to the subject of architectural history. August Choisy was perhaps the first author to seriously attempt to undertake such a study.

===The early twentieth century studies===
Santiago Heurta has suggested that it was modernism, with its emphasis on the employment of new materials, that abruptly ended the interest in construction history that appeared to have been growing in the last few decades of the nineteenth century and the early years of the twentieth.  With the advent of concrete and steel frame construction, architects, who had been the chief audience for such studies, were no longer as interested as they had been in understanding traditional construction, which suddenly appeared redundant. Very little was thus published between 1920 and 1950. The revival of interest started in archaeology with the studies of Roman construction in the 1950s, but it was not until the 1980s that construction history began to emerge as an independent field.

===The late twentieth century===
By the end of the twentieth century, steel and concrete construction were themselves becoming the subject of historical investigation.The [[Construction History Society]] was formed in the UK in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.constructionhistory.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; It produces the only academic international journal devoted to the subject annually.  The First International Congress on Construction History was held in Madrid in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aq.upm.es/Instituciones/jherrera/construction-history First International Congress on Construction History] Madrid 2003&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the Second International Congress in 2006 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arct.cam.ac.uk/Arct/Page.aspx?ix=349&amp;p=23&amp;pid=101&amp;prcid=8&amp;ppid=1294 Second International Congress on Construction History]'at University of Cambridge, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; in Queens College, Cambridge, England and the Third International Congress held in Cottbus in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ch2009.de/home/index.html Third International Congress on Construction History] May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and the Fourth International Congress held in Paris in July 2012 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icch-paris2012.fr/ Fourth International Congress on Construction History] Paris, July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5386">'''IEC 61162''' is a collection of [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standards for "Digital interfaces for navigational equipment within a ship".

The 61162 standards are developed in Working Group 6 (WG6) of Technical Committee 80 (TC80) of the IEC.

==Sections of IEC 61162==
Standard ''IEC 61162'' is divided into four parts:
* Part 1: Single talker and multiple listeners (Also known as [[NMEA 0183]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Design challenges and decisions for a new ship data network|url=http://www.mits-forum.org/resources/lwe-paper-isis-v9.pdf|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Part 2: Single talker and multiple listeners, high-speed transmission
* Part 3: Serial data instrument network (Also known as [[NMEA 2000]])
* Part 450:  Multiple talkers and multiple listeners–Ethernet interconnection (Also known as Lightweight Ethernet)
* Part 460:  Multiple talkers and multiple listeners - Ethernet interconnection - Safety and security
 
The 61162 standards are all concerning the transport of [[National Marine Electronics Association|NMEA]] sentences, but the IEC
does not define any of these. This is left to the [http://www.nmea.org/ NMEA Organization].

==IEC 61162-1==
Single talker and multiple listeners
is an international standard

==IEC 61162-2==
Single talker and multiple listeners, high-speed transmission

==IEC 61162-3==
Serial data instrument network

==IEC 61162-450==
Multiple talkers Multiple listeners

This subgroup of TC80/WG6 has specified the use of Ethernet for shipboard navigational networks. The
specification describes the transport of NMEA sentences as defined in 61162-1 over IPv4. Due to
the low amount of protocol complexity it has been nicknamed Lightweight Ethernet or LWE in short.

The historical background and justification for LWE was presented at the ISIS2011 symposium.&lt;ref&gt;Ø.J. Rødseth, et al. "Overview of the IEC 61162-450 “Light Weight Ethernet” Ship Bridge Data Network", ISIS2011&lt;/ref&gt; An overview article of LWE was
given in the December issue of "Digital Ship"&lt;ref&gt;M.J. Christensen, et al. ''Lightweight Ethernet - a new standard for shipbord networks" [http://issuu.com/mortenjc/docs/digital_ship_december_2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard was published in the first edition 06/2011 . The second edition is in progress(state 05/2016). 

==IEC 61162-460==
IEC 61162-460:2015(E) is an add-on to the IEC 61162-450 standard where higher safety and security standards are needed, e.g. due to higher exposure to external threats or to improve network integrity. This standard provides requirements and test methods for equipment to be used in an IEC 61162-460 compliant network as well as requirements for the network itself and requirements for interconnection from the network to other networks. This standard also contains requirements for a redundant IEC 61162-460 compliant network. This standard extends the informative guidance given in Annex D of IEC 61162-450:2011. It does not introduce new application level protocol requirements to those that are defined in IEC 61162-450. 

The first edition was published in 08/2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3987">An '''IVMS''' ''(In Vehicle Monitoring System)'' combines the installation of an [[electronic device]] in a vehicle, or fleet of vehicles, with purpose-designed [[computer software]] at least at one operational base to enable the owner or a third party to track the vehicle's location, collecting data in the process from the field and deliver it to the base of operation. Modern [[vehicle tracking system]]s commonly use [[GPS]] technology for locating the vehicle, but other types of [[automatic vehicle location]] technology can also be used. Vehicle information can be viewed on electronic maps via the [[Internet]] or specialized software.

Urban [[public transit]] authorities, [[Mining]] companies and Transport/Freight companies are an increasingly common user of vehicle tracking systems.

Several types of vehicle tracking devices exist. Typically they are classified as "passive" and "active".

"Passive" devices store GPS location, speed, heading and sometimes a trigger event such as key on/off, door open/closed. Once the vehicle returns to a predetermined point, the device is removed and the data downloaded to a [[computer]] for [[evaluation]]. One such example of a passive device would be a GPS Log Book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usb.gpslogbook.com.au|title=GPS Log Book - Home|website=usb.gpslogbook.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; that gathers the data and stores it for later upload

"Active" devices also collect the same information but usually transmit the data in real-time via cellular or satellite networks to a computer or [[data center]] for evaluation. The information is typically analysed and presented using [[World Wide Web|web based technologies]].

Many modern IVMS devices combine both active and semi-passive tracking abilities: when a [[cellular network]] is available and a tracking device is connected it transmits data to a server; when a network is not available the device stores data in [[internal memory]] and will transmit stored data to the server later when the network becomes available again. So, although the actual upload is Active, there is a time delay between the time the position is recorded and the time it is sent back-to-base, making the units semi-passive. Where IVMS is used to drive driver safety and improve on general driver behaviour, this makes no difference in reality: data gets uploaded (delayed) but is still available for post-processing purposes, so overnight safety reports are not affected by this provided the vehicle comes back into coverage later during that day.

Historically IVMS has been accomplished by installing a box into the vehicle, either self-powered with a battery or wired into the vehicle's power system. For detailed vehicle locating and tracking this is still the predominant method; however, many companies are increasingly interested in the emerging [[cell phone]] technologies that provide tracking of multiple entities, such as both a salesperson and their vehicle. These systems also offer tracking of calls, texts, Web use and generally provide a wider safety net for the staff member and the vehicle.

IVMS Units track many different types of activity within a vehicle such as GPS Position, Various inputs such as seatbelt and 4x4 engagement, Speed, Impact/Rollover, Harsh events (acceleration and deceleration, usually performed by a Triaxial [[Accelerometer]]) over revving, excess idle time just to mention a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IVMS Components and Functions|url=https://digicore-australia.com.au/resources/ivms-components-and-functions/|website=DigiCore Australia|publisher=DigiCore Australia|accessdate=17 Jun 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation of IVMS often has significant cost savings: by getting drivers to slow down and drive more carefully, stress is also taken off vehicles. This in the end has savings not only in terms of fuel, but also in terms of general vehicle wear-and-tear like brake pads and disks and engine wear.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1969">'''Integrated Geo Systems (IGS)''' is a [[Computer architecture|computational architecture system]] developed for managing [[geoscientific]] data through [[Systems design|systems]] and [[data integration]].

Geosciences often involve large volumes of diverse data which have to be processed by [[Application software|computer]] and [[Graphics software|graphics intensive applications]]. The processes involved in processing these large datasets are often so complex that no single applications software can perform all the required tasks. Specialized applications have emerged for specific tasks. To get the required results, it is necessary that all applications software involved in various stages of data processing, analysis and interpretation effectively communicate with each other by sharing data.

IGS provides a framework for maintaining an electronic workflow between various geoscience software applications through data connectivity.

The main components of IGS are:

* [[Geographic Information Systems]] as a front end. 
* Format Engine for data connectivity link between various geoscience software applications. The format engine uses [http://www.ktronworld.net/techcenters/oil/oil.asp Output Input Language (OIL)], an interpreted language to define various data formats.
* An array of geoscience relational databases for data integration.
* Data Highways as internal data formats for each data type.
* Specialized Geoscience Applications Software as processing modules.
* Geoscientific Processing Libraries

'''Integrated Computational Materials Engineering''' (ICME) is an approach to design products, the materials that comprise them, and their associated materials processing methods by linking materials models at multiple length scales.  Key words are "Integrated", involving integrating models at multiple length scales, and "[[Engineering]]", signifying industrial utility.  The focus is on the materials, i.e. understanding how processes produce material [[microstructure|structures]], how those structures give rise to [[list of materials properties|material properties]], and how to [[material selection|select materials]] for a given application. The key links are process-structures-properties-performance.&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olson|first=Gregory B.|journal=Science|date=May 2000|volume=288|pages=993–998|url=http://srg.northwestern.edu/Publications%20Library/Journals/2000_DesigningNewMaterialWorld_Science_small.pdf|doi=10.1126/science.288.5468.993 |title= Designing a New Material World }}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Academies report&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesReport&gt;{{cite book|last=Committee on Integrated Computational Materials Engineering, National Materials Advisory Board, Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences, National Research Council|title=Integrated Computational Materials Engineering: A Transformational Discipline for Improved Competitiveness and National Security|year=2008|publisher=National Academies Press|pages=132|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JlfSnH8jI4UC&amp;dq=Standardized+information+exchange+in+Integrated+Computational+Materials+Engineering+-wikipedia|isbn=9780309178211}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the need for using multiscale materials modeling&lt;ref name=Horstemeyer&gt;{{cite book|title=Practical Aspects of Computational Chemistry|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-481-2686-6|author=M.F.

== Standardization in ICME ==
A fundamental requirement to meet the ambitious ICME objective of designing materials for specific products resp. components is an integrative and interdisciplinary computational description of the history of the component starting from the sound initial condition of a homogeneous, isotropic and stress free melt resp. gas phase and continuing via subsequent processing steps and eventually ending in the description of failure onset under operational load.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesReport /&gt;&lt;ref name=Panchal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Panchal|first=Jitesh H.|author2=Surya R.

Integrated Computational Materials Engineering is an approach to design products, the materials that comprise them, and their associated materials processing methods by linking materials models at multiple length scales. ICME thus naturally requires the combination of a variety of models and software tools. It is thus a common objective to build up a scientific network of stakeholders concentrating on boosting ICME into industrial application by defining a common communication standard for ICME relevant tools.&lt;ref name=Schmitz&gt;{{cite book|title=Integrative Computational Materials Engineering- Concepts and applications of a modular simulation platform|year=2012|publisher=Wiley VCH Verlag|location=Weinheim|isbn=978-3-527-33081-2|editor=Schmitz, G.

== Standardization of information exchange ==

[[File:ICMEg concept.jpg|right|thumb|284x284px]]
Efforts to generate a common language by standardizing and generalizing data formats for the exchange of simulation results represent a major mandatory step towards successful future applications of ICME. A future, structural framework for ICME comprising a variety of academic and/or commercial simulation tools operating on different scales and being modular interconnected by a common language in form of standardized data exchange will allow integrating different disciplines along the production chain, which by now have only scarcely interacted. This will substantially improve the understanding of individual processes by integrating the component history originating from preceding steps as the initial condition for the actual process. Eventually this will lead to optimized process and production scenarios and will allow effective tailoring of specific materials and component properties.&lt;ref name=Schmitz_2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmitz|first=G.J.|author2=Prahl, U.|title=Toward a virtual platform for materials processing|journal=JOM|year=2009|volume=61|issue=5|doi=10.1007/s11837-009-0064-0|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11837-009-0064-0|pages=19–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The ICMEg project and its mission ===

The ICMEg&lt;ref name=icmeg.eu&gt;{{cite web|title=ICMEg project|url=http://icmeg.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; project aims to build up a scientific network of stakeholders concentrating on boosting ICME into industrial application by defining a common communication standard for ICME relevant tools. Eventually this will allow stakeholders from electronic, atomistic, mesoscopic and continuum communities to benefit from sharing knowledge and best practice and thus to promote a deeper understanding between the different communities of materials scientists, IT engineers and industrial users.

ICMEg will create an international network of simulation providers and users.&lt;ref name=icmeg.workshop&gt;{{cite web|title=ICMEg workshops|url=http://www.icmeg.euproject.info/icmeg-workshop.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will promote a deeper understanding between the different communities (academia and industry) each of them by now using very different tools/methods and data formats. The harmonization and standardization of information exchange along the life-cycle of a component and across the different scales (electronic, atomistic, mesoscopic, continuum) are the key activity of ICMEg.

The mission of ICMEg is
* to establish and to maintain a network of contacts to simulation software providers, governmental and international standardization authorities, ICME users, associations in the area of materials and processing, and academia
* to define and communicate an ICME language in form of an open and standardized communication protocol
* to stimulate knowledge sharing in the field of multiscale materials design
* to identify missing tools, models and functionalities and propose a roadmap for their development
* to discuss and to decide about future amendments to the initial standard

The activities of ICMEg include
* Organization of International Workshops on Software Solutions for Integrated Computational Materials Engineering&lt;ref name=icmeg.workshop /&gt;
* Conducting market study and surwey on available simulation software for ICME&lt;ref name=icmeg.eu /&gt;
* Create and maintain forum for knowledge sharing in ICME &lt;ref name=icmeg.eu /&gt;

The ICMEg project ended in October 2016. Its major outcomes are

Most of the activities being launched in the ICMEg project are continued by the [http://www.emmc.info European Materials Modelling Council] and in the [http://the-marketplace-project.eu MarketPlace project]

== Multiscale modeling in material processing ==
[[Multiscale modeling]] aims to evaluate material properties or behavior on one level using information or models from different levels and properties of elementary processes.
Usually, the following levels, addressing a phenomenon over a specific window of length and time, are recognized:

* Structural scale: [[Finite element method|Finite element]], [[finite volume method|finite volume]] and [[finite difference method|finite difference]] [[partial differential equation]] are solvers used to simulate structural responses such as [[solid mechanics]] and [[transport phenomena]] at large (meters) scales.
** process modeling/simulations: extrusion, rolling, sheet forming, stamping, casting, welding, etc.
** product modeling/simulations: performance, impact, fatigue, corrosion, etc.
* Macroscale: constitutive (rheology) equations are used at the continuum level in [[solid mechanics]] and [[transport phenomena]] at millimeter scales.
* Mesoscale: continuum level formulations are used with discrete quantities at multiple micrometre scale. "Meso" is an ambiguous term that means "intermediate" so it has been used as representing different intermediate scales. In this context it can represent modeling from crystal plasticity for metals, Eshelby solutions for any materials, homogenization methods, and unit cell methods.  
* Microscale: modeling techniques that represent the micrometre scale such as dislocation dynamics codes for metals and phase field models for multiphase materials. [[Phase field models]] of [[phase transition]]s and [[microstructure]] formation and evolution on nanometer to millimeter scales.
* Nanoscale: semi-empirical atomistic methods are used such as Lennard-Jones, Brenner potentials, embedded atom method (EAM) potentials, and modified embedded atom potentials (MEAM) in [[molecular dynamics]] (MD), molecular statics (MS), [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] (MC), and [[kinetic Monte Carlo]] (KMC) formulations.
* Electronic scale: Schroedinger equations are used in computational framework as [[density functional theory]] (DFT) models of electron orbitals and bonding on angstrom to nanometer scales.

There are some software codes that operate on different length scales such as:

*[[CALPHAD]] computational [[thermodynamics]] for prediction of equilibrium [[phase diagram]]s and even non-equilibrium phases.
*[[Phase field models#Software|''Phase field codes'']] for simulation of microstructure evolution 
*[[Database]]s of processing parameters, [[microstructure]] features, and [[list of materials properties|properties]] from which one can draw correlations at various length scales
*[https://www.geodict.com GeoDict] - The Digital Material Laboratory by [https://www.math2market.de Math2Market]
*[http://vextec.com/demos/ VPS-MICRO] is a multiscale probabilistic fracture mechanics software.
*[http://analyswift.com/swiftcomp-vamuch-micromechanics-modeling-of-heterogeneous-materials/ SwiftComp] is a multiscale constitutive modeling software based on mechanics of structure genome.

A comprehensive compilation of software tools with relevance for ICME is documented in the Handbook of Software Solutions for ICME&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

*Small scale models calculate [[list of materials properties|material properties]], or relationships between properties and parameters, e.g. [[yield (engineering)|yield strength]] vs. [[temperature]], for use in continuum models
*[[CALPHAD]] computational thermodynamics software predicts free energy as a function of composition; a phase field model then uses this to predict structure formation and development, which one may then correlate with properties.
*An essential ingredient to model microstructure evolution by [[phase field models]] and other microstructre evolution codes are the initial and boundary conditions. While boundary conditions may be taken e.g. from the  simulation of the actual process, the initial conditions (i.e. the initial microstructure entering into the actual process step) involve the entire integrated process history starting from the homogeneous, isotropic and stress free melt. Thus - for a successful ICME - an efficient exchange of information along the entire process chain and across all relevant length scales is mandatory. The models to be combined for this purpose comprise both academic and/or commercial modelling tools and simulation software packages. To streamline the information flow within this heterogeneous variety of modelling tools, the concept of a modular, standardized simulation platform has recently been proposed.&lt;ref name=Schmitz /&gt; A first realisation of this concept is the [http://www.aixvipmap.de '' AixViPMaP® '']- the Aachen Virtual Platform for Materials Processing.
*Process models calculate spatial distribution of structure features, e.g. fiber density and orientation in a [[composite material]]; small-scale models then calculate relationships between structure and properties, for use in a continuum models of overall part or system behavior
*Large scale models explicitly fully couple with small scale models, e.g. a [[fracture]] simulation might integrate a continuum solid mechanics model of macroscopic deformation with an FD model of atomic motions at the crack tip
*Suites of models (large-scale, small-scale, atomic-scale, process-structure, structure-properties, etc.) can be hierarchically integrated into a systems design framework to enable the computational design of entirely new materials.  A commercial leader in the use of ICME in computational materials design is [http://www.questek.com QuesTek Innovations LLC], a small business in Evanston, IL co-founded by [http://www.matsci.northwestern.edu/faculty/gbo.html Prof. Greg Olson of Northwestern University].

Katsuyo Thorton announced at the 2010 MS&amp;T ICME Technical Committee meeting that NSF would be funding a "[http://www.umich.edu/~mctp/SciPrgPgs/events/2012/SS12/sponsors.html Summer School]" on ICME at the [[University of Michigan]] starting in 2011. Northwestern began offering a [http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/materials-science/documents/graduate/icme-brochure.pdf Masters of Science Certificate] in ICME in the fall of 2011.  The first Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) course based upon Horstemeyer 2012&lt;ref name="Horstemeyer 2012" /&gt; was delivered at Mississippi State University (MSU) in 2012 as a graduate course with distance learning students included [c.f., Sukhija et al., 2013].  It was later was taught in 2013 and 2014 at MSU also with distance learning students. In 2015, the [https://icme.hpc.msstate.edu/mediawiki/index.php/Mississippi_State_University ICME Course] was taught by Dr. Mark Horstemeyer (MSU) and Dr. William (Bill) Shelton (Louisiana State University, LSU) with students from each institution via distance learning. The goal of the methodology embraced in this course was to provide students with the basic skills to take advantage of the computational tools and experimental data provided by EVOCD in conducting simulations and bridging procedures for quantifying the structure-property relationships of materials at multiple length scales. On successful completion of the assigned projects, students published their multiscale modeling learning outcomes on the [http://icme.hpc.msstate.edu/ ICME Wiki], facilitating easy assessment of student achievements and embracing qualities set by the ABET engineering accreditation board.

The '''InterNational Committee for Information Technology Standards''' ('''INCITS'''), (pronounced "insights"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incits.org|title=About INCITS}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[ANSI]]-accredited standards development organization composed of [[Information technology]] developers. It was formerly known as the '''X3''' and '''NCITS'''.

INCITS is the central U.S. forum dedicated to creating technology standards.  INCITS is accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and is affiliated with the Information Technology Industry Council, a global policy advocacy organization that represents U.S. and global innovation companies.

INCITS coordinates technical standards activity between ANSI in the USA and joint [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] committees worldwide.  This provides a mechanism to create standards that will be implemented in many nations. As such, INCITS' executive board also serves as ANSI's Technical Advisory Group for ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1. JTC 1 is responsible for International standardization in the field of information technology.
INCITS operates through consensus.  Many times, the U.S. standard that INCITS members develop then will become the baseline standard for the international community.

==Governance==
INCITS is guided by its executive board. 
The INCITS executive board  established more than 50 Technical Committees, Task Groups and Study Groups that are constantly developing standards for new technologies and updating standards for older products.

==Standards development==
More than 750  standards  have been created and approved through the INCITS process, with another 800 in development.  American National Standards are voluntary and serve U.S. interests well because all materially affected stakeholders have the opportunity to work together to create them.  INCITS-approved standards only become mandatory when, and if, they are adopted or referenced by the government or when market forces make them imperative.

Given the responsibilities and the expenditures associated with U.S. participation in international standards activities, INCITS considers participation as a "P" member of ISO/IEC JTC 1, as a declaration of support for the international committee’s technical work. INCITS policy is to adopt as "Identical" American National Standards all ISO/IEC or ISO standards that fall within its program of work, with exceptions as outlined in our procedures.  Accordingly, INCITS will adopt as "Identical" American National Standards all ISO/IEC or ISO standards that fall within its program of work. Similarly, INCITS will withdraw any such adopted American National Standard that has been withdrawn as an ISO/IEC or ISO International Standards.

==History==
INCITS was established in 1961 as the Accredited Standards Committee X3, Information Technology'and is sponsored by [[Information Technology Industry Council]] (ITI),  a trade association representing providers of information technology products and services then known as the Business Equipment Manufacturers Association (BEMA) and later renamed the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers' Association (CBEMA). The first organizational meeting was in February 1961 with ITI (CBEMA then) taking Secretariat responsibility. X3 was established under [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) procedures. The forum was renamed Accredited Standards Committee NCITS, National Committee for Information Technology Standards in 1997, and the current name was approved in 2001.

The KENTORT II retort consists of four fluidized bed vessels, configured in cascade. The raw oil shale is fed to the [[pyrolysis]] vessel the pyrolysis section, where it is fluidized by a mixture of steam and product [[oil shale gas]] from the gasification section below. Heat is transferred to the raw oil shale by a combination of fluidizing gas and recirculating hot [[spent shale]] from the gasification section. The pyrolysis takes place at {{convert|500|°C|°F|-1}} to {{convert|550|°C|°F|-1}}.&lt;ref name=vego/&gt;&lt;ref name=carter&gt;

The pyrolyzed oil shale moves by gravity downward to the gasification section. Gasification, which takes place at {{convert|750|°C|°F|-1}} to {{convert|850|°C|°F|-1}}, converts remained [[carbon]] in the spent shale ([[char]]) to product oil shale gas. Steam from the cooling zone is used for fluidizing the sent shale while heat transferred by hot solids (oil shale ash) from the combustion section. The spent shale moves to the combustion section where it is burnt to heat the process, while oil shale ash moves to the cooling section before its removal from the retort.&lt;ref name=vego/&gt;

This '''list of missiles by country''' displays the names of [[missile]]s in order of the country where they originate (were developed), with the countries listed alphabetically and annotated with their continent (and defence alliance, if applicable). In cases where multiple nations have developed or produced a missile, it is listed under each significantly participating nation. Within the lists of each country, missiles are ordered by designation and/or calling name (the latter being especially relevant for Russian/Soviet missiles). In some cases multiple listings are used, in order to provide cross-references for easier navigation. 
 
This is not a list of missiles in operational service by a particular country; nor a list of [[Rocket (weapon)|military rockets]]. [[Anti-tank missiles]] are [[List of anti-tank missiles|listed elsewhere]]

== Iran ==
{{main|Iranian missile tests}}
{{asof|2009}}, Iran has an active interest in developing, acquiring, and deploying a broad range of ballistic missiles, as well as developing a space launch capability. In mid-July 2008, Iran launched a number of ballistic missiles during military exercises, reportedly including the medium-range Shahab-3. Iran announced other missile and space launch tests in August and November 2008. In February 2009, Iran announced it launched a satellite into orbit and "officially achieved a presence in space."&lt;ref name="CRS1"&gt;{{CRS|article = Iran's Ballistic Missile Programs: An Overview|url = https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/RS22758.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the portfolio was merged with that of the [[Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs (Canada)|Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs]] to create the post of [[Minister of Industry (Canada)|Minister of Industry]]. In the appointments to the [[Cabinet of Canada]] of October 30, 2008 under [[Stephen Harper]], the portfolio was reintroduced as a [[Minister of State (Canada)|Minister of State]] and given to [[Gary Goodyear]].

The '''Ministry of Energy of the Kingdom of Thailand''' ({{lang-th|กระทรวงพลังงาน}}; RTGS: Krasuang Phalang Ngan) is a cabinet ministry in the [[Government of Thailand]]. 

== History ==
Disparate energy departments were consolidated by the government with the establishment of the National Energy Policy Committee in 1992 (B.E.2535) under the National Energy Policy Council Act (1992). It is responsible for managing the energy sector in Thailand, including granting energy operating licenses and issuing energy pricing regulations. [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], then prime minister in 2002, established the Bureau of Energy on 2 November 2001, B.E.2544, which was later upgraded to the Ministry of Energy in 2002 pursuant to the Restructuring of Government Organization Act (2002).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/012/i1285e/i1285e08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energy.go.th/?q=en/profile&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization==
=== Administration ===
* Office of the Minister
* Office of the Permanent Secretary

=== Dependent departments ===
* Department of Mineral Fuels
* Department of Energy Business
* Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency (DEDE)
* Energy Policy and Planning Office

=== State enterprises ===
* [[Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand]] (EGAT)
* [[PTT Public Company Limited]]
* Bangchak Petroleum Public Company Limited

==Thailand Power Development Plan 2015-2036 (PDP2025)==
Thailand's Power Development Plan (PDP).&lt;ref name="PDP2015"&gt;{{cite book|title=Thailand Power Development Plan 2015-2036 (PDP2015)|date=2015-06-30|publisher=Ministry of Energy (MOE), Energy Policy and Planning Office (EPPO)|location=Bangkok|url=http://www.egat.co.th/en/images/about-egat/PDP2015_Eng.pdf|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the nation's roadmap for electric power generation, distribution, and consumption. The plan, prepared by the Ministry of Energy (MOE) and EGAT, is issued iteratively. The previous edition, PDP2010 Revision 3, covered the years 2012-2030.

Along with the PDP, the MOE produces several subsidiary plans that roll up into the PDP:&lt;ref name="PDP2015" /&gt;{{RP|1-1}}
* Energy Efficiency Development Plan (EEDP)
* Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP)
* Natural Gas Supply Plan 
* Petroleum Management Plan

PDP2015 begins with the assumptions that:&lt;ref name="PDP2015" /&gt;{{RP|2-3}}
* Thailand's average [[GDP]] growth over the period 2014-2036 will be 3.94 percent annually
* Thailand's population growth over the same period will average 0.03 percent annually
* Energy savings over the period as forecasted in the EEDP will total 89,672 GWh
* Renewables, including domestic hydro, will supply 19,634.4 MW of power over the period
* Thailand's new power demands will grow 2.67 percent annually, 2014-2036
* In 2036 Thailand's peak electricity demand will be 49,655 MW and that total electricity demand will be 326,119 GWh 

PDP2015 projects the following changes in Thailand electrical power generation fuel mix over the period 2014-2036:&lt;ref name="PDP2015" /&gt;{{RP|2-1}}
* Imported hydro-power: Rising from 7 percent in 2014 to 15-20 percent in 2036
* Coal/lignite: Flat to rising from 20 percent to 20-25 percent
* Renewables, including domestic hydro: Rising from 8 percent to 15-20 percent
* Natural gas: Declining from 64 percent to 30-40 percent
* Nuclear: Rising from 0 percent to 0-5 percent
* Diesel/fuel oil: Declining from 1 percent to zero

PDP2015 projects that Thailand's CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from power generation will rise from 86,998,000 tons in 2015 to 104,075,000 tons in 2036.&lt;ref name="PDP2015" /&gt;{{RP|7-1}}

The '''Pattern Oriented Rule Implementation''' ('''PORI''') table is a [[data structure]] invented by [[Amdocs]] for representation of algorithms for determining a price or set of prices in a financial transaction. The PORI table is used to describe the pricing logic associated with the input event. The PORI table enables business analysts to build a language to describe the business logic associated with financial pricing. The pricing logic is composed without the need for [[Computer programming|programming]], and transformed into [[executable]] code using the PORI Core Processor execution engine. The unique PORI representation, and the [[inference engine]] for executing the PORI rules, is used to compute a variety of pricing problems on the input event in [[Real-time computing|real-time]] fashion.

'''Potted shrimps''' are a traditional [[ British cuisine|British]] dish made with [[Crangon crangon|brown shrimp]] flavored with [[nutmeg]].

'''Prefrontal cortex basal ganglia working memory''' ('''PBWM''') is an [[algorithm]] that [[Computer simulation|models]] [[working memory]] in the [[prefrontal cortex]] and the [[basal ganglia]].&lt;ref name="paper"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://psych.colorado.edu/~oreilly/pubs-abstr.html#OReillyFrank06|title=Making Working Memory Work: A Computational Model of Learning in the Frontal Cortex and Basal Ganglia|author1=O'Reilly, R.C|author2=Frank, M.J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2006|journal=Neural Computation|volume=18|issue=2|pages=283–328|pmid=16378516|doi=10.1162/089976606775093909}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be compared to [[long short-term memory]] (LSTM) in functionality, but is more biologically explainable.&lt;ref name="paper"/&gt;{{third party inline|date=April 2015}}

It uses the [[PVLV|primary value learned value]] model to train prefrontal cortex working-memory updating system, based on the biology of the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia.&lt;ref name="emergent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grey.colorado.edu/emergent/index.php/Leabra_PBWM|title=Leabra PBWM|publisher=CCNLab}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used as part of the [[Leabra]] framework and was implemented in [[Emergent (software)|Emergent]].{{when?|date=September 2015}}

==Abstract==

The prefrontal cortex has long been thought to subserve both working memory (the holding of information online for processing) and "executive" functions (deciding how to manipulate working memory and perform processing). Although many [[computational models of working memory]] have been developed, the mechanistic basis of executive function remains elusive.

PBWM is a computational model of the prefrontal cortex to control both itself and other brain areas in a strategic, task-appropriate manner. These learning mechanisms are based on subcortical structures in the midbrain, basal ganglia and amygdala, which together form an actor/critic architecture. The critic system learns which prefrontal representations are task-relevant and trains the actor, which in turn provides a dynamic gating mechanism for controlling working memory updating. Computationally, the learning mechanism is designed to simultaneously solve the temporal and structural credit assignment problems.

The model's performance compares favorably with standard [[backpropagation]]-based temporal learning mechanisms on the challenging [[1-2-AX working memory task]], and other benchmark working memory tasks.&lt;ref name="paper"/&gt;{{third party inline|date=April 2015}}

==Model==

First, there are multiple separate '''stripes''' (groups of units) in the prefrontal cortex and [[striatum]] layers. Each stripe can be independently updated, such that this system can remember several different things at the same time, each with a different "updating policy" of when memories are updated and maintained. The active maintenance of the memory is in prefrontal cortex (PFC), and the updating signals (and updating policy more generally) come from the [[striatum]] units (a subset of [[basal ganglia]] units).&lt;ref name="emergent"/&gt;

[[PVLV]] provides [[reinforcement learning]] signals to train up the dynamic gating system in the basal ganglia.

===Sensory input and motor output===

The sensory input is connected to the posterior cortex which is connected to the motor output. The sensory input is also linked to the [[PVLV]] system.

===Posterior cortex===

The posterior cortex form the hidden layers of the input/output mapping. The PFC is connected with the posterior cortex to contextualize this input/output mapping.

===PFC===

The PFC (for output gating) has a localist one-to-one representation of the input units for every stripe. Thus, you can look at these PFC representations and see directly what the network is maintaining. The PFC maintains the working memory needed to perform the task.

===Striatum===

This is the dynamic gating system representing the [[striatum]] units of the [[basal ganglia]]. Every even-index unit within a stripe represents "Go", while the odd-index units represent "NoGo." The Go units cause updating of the PFC, while the NoGo units cause the PFC to maintain its existing memory representation.

There are groups of units for every stripe.

In the PBWM model in [[Emergent (software)|Emergent]], the matrices represent the striatum.

===PVLV===

All of these layers are part of [[PVLV]] system. The PVLV system controls the dopaminergic modulation of the basal ganglia (BG). Thus, BG/PVLV form an actor-critic architecture where the PVLV system learns when to update.{{fact|date=September 2015}}

====SNrThal====


SNrThal represents the [[substantia nigra]] [[pars reticulata]] (SNr) and the associated area of the [[thalamus]], which produce a competition among the Go/NoGo units within a given stripe and mediates competition using [[Winner-take-all (computing)|k-winners-take-all]] dynamics. If there is more overall Go activity in a given stripe, then the associated SNrThal unit gets activated, and it drives updating in PFC. For every stripe, there is one unit in SNrThal.{{fact|date=September 2015}}

====VTA and SNc====


[[Ventral tegmental area]] (VTA) and [[substantia nigra pars compacta]] (SNc) are part of the [[dopamine]] layer. This layer models midbrain dopamine neurons. They control the [[dopaminergic]] modulation of the basal ganglia.{{fact|date=September 2015}}

A '''rainwater tank''' (sometimes called a '''rain barrel''' in North America in reference to smaller tanks, or a '''water butt''' in the UK) is a [[water tank]] used to collect and store rain water [[surface runoff|runoff]], typically from [[rooftop]]s via [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]]s. Rainwater tanks are devices for collecting and maintaining [[Rainwater harvesting|harvested rain]]. A rainwater catchment or collection (also known as "[[rainwater harvesting]]") system can yield {{convert|2358|litres|gal}} of water from {{convert|2.54|cm|in|abbr=on}} of rain on a {{convert|92.9|sqm|sqft|abbr=on}} roof.&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Rainfall Catchment Equation:''' Catchment Area (''often roofs, in square feet, ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'') x Event Rainfall Depth (i''n'') x 0.623 Conversion Factor ''='' '''Gallons''' '''of Potential Rainwater Collected'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntotank.com/blog/rainwater-harvesting-for-livestock/|title=Rainwater Harvesting for Livestock|website=www.ntotank.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;*Note this equation is for U.S., imperial measurements; i.e. calculations and conversion factor is for distance in feet and inches, and volume in gallons. (''We need a metric system equation''.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Rainwater tanks are installed to make use of rain water for later use, reduce [[Public utility|mains]] water use for economic or environmental reasons, and aid [[self-sufficiency]]. Stored water may be used for watering [[garden]]s, agriculture, [[Flush toilet|flushing toilets]], in [[washing machine]]s, washing cars, and also for [[Drinking water|drinking]], especially when other water supplies are unavailable, expensive, or of poor quality, and when adequate care is taken that the water is not [[Water pollution#Contaminants|contaminated]] and is adequately filtered.

Underground rainwater tanks can also be used for retention of [[stormwater]] for release at a later time and offer a variety of benefits described in more detail below. In [[arid]] climates, rain barrels are often used to store water during the rainy season for use during dryer periods.

Rainwater tanks may have a high (perceived) initial cost. However, many homes use small scale rain barrels to harvest minute quantities of water for landscaping/gardening applications rather than as a potable water surrogate. These small rain barrels, often recycled from food storage and transport barrels or, in some cases, whiskey and wine [[aging barrels]], are often inexpensive.  There are also many low cost designs that use locally available materials and village level technologies for applications in developing countries where there are limited alternatives for potable drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;Camilli, Luis (2000), [https://www.scribd.com/doc/11630903/Maji-Safi-Rainwater-Harvesting-Manual-Kiswahili-English Rainwater Harvesting: constructing a cistern and gutter system using village technologies and materials], Maji Safi Rainwater Harvesting Manual&lt;/ref&gt;  While most are properly engineered to screen out [[mosquito]]es, the lack of proper filtering or closed loop systems may create breeding grounds for larvae. With tanks used for drinking water, the user runs a health risk if maintenance is not carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenhouse.gov.au/yourhome/technical/fs22.htm  |title=Rainwater, Fact Sheet |accessdate=2007-02-17 |work=greenhouse.gov.au: Your Home Technical Manual |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070216210324/http://www.greenhouse.gov.au/yourhome/technical/fs22.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contamination and maintenance ==

If rainwater is used for drinking, it is often filtered first. Filtration (such as [[reverse osmosis]], ultraviolet sterilization, or [[ultrafiltration]]) may remove pathogens. While rain water is pure it may become contaminated during collection or by collection of particulate matter in the air as it falls.&lt;ref Name="twdb"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While rain water does not contain [[water chlorination|chlorine]], contamination from [[Air pollution|airborne pollutants]], which settles onto rooftops, may be a risk in urban or industrial areas. Many water suppliers and health authorities, such as the [[New South Wales Department of Health]], do not advise using rainwater for drinking when there is an alternative mains water supply available. However, reports of illness associated with rainwater tanks are relatively infrequent, and public health studies in [[South Australia]] (the Australian state with the highest rainwater usage rate) have not identified a correlation. Rainwater is generally considered fit to drink if it smells, tastes and looks fine;&lt;ref name="choice"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.choice.com.au/viewArticle.aspx?id=104499 |title=Buying guide: Rainwater tanks |accessdate=2007-02-10 |work=CHOICE magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; However some pathogens, chemical contamination and sub-micrometre suspended metal may produce neither smell nor taste and may not be visible.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

Australian standards may differ greatly from other places in the world where rainwater is commonly used for drinking water.  In the United States, rainwater is being increasingly used throughout the country for various purposes.  In the semi-arid western state of New Mexico, for instance, many residents in the Taos and Santa Fe areas in particular use rainwater either for landscaping purposes or even all household uses (including potable indoor water).  The "smells, tastes, and looks fine" standard used in the above paragraph is not an absolute indicator of rainwater safety.  Most people who are rainwater users for potable purposes in the USA make certain that their water is safe through filtration, ultraviolet sterilization, and testing.

Certain paints and roofing materials may cause contamination. In particular, a [[Melbourne Water]] publication advises that [[lead-based paint]]s never be used. [[Tar]]-based coatings are also not recommended, as they affect the taste of the water. Zinc can also be a source of contamination in some paints, as well as [[galvanized iron]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=M.I. Magyar |author2=V.G. Mitchell |author3=A.R. Ladson |author4=C. Diaper |title=Lead and other heavy metals: common contaminants of rainwater tanks in Melbourne | journal = Water Down Under 2008| version= |pages=415 |publisher=CSIRO |year=2008 |url=http://www.csiro.au/files/files/pk7r.pdf |format=pdf }} "Aluminium and cadmium can be an impurity in zinc galvanised iron roofs (Gromaire et al., 2001, Van Metre and Mahler, 2003) and therefore found in collected tank rainwater. Indeed, in Study 2, the tank with high concentration of Cd collected water from a galvanised iron roof."&lt;/ref&gt; or [[zincalume]] roofs, particularly when new, should not collect water for potable use. Roofs painted with [[acrylic paint]]s may have detergents and other chemicals dissolve in the runoff. Runoff from [[Fibrous Cement|fibrous cement]] roofs should be discarded for an entire winter, due to leaching of lime. Chemically treated timbers and [[lead flashing]] should not be used in roof catchments. Likewise, rainwater should not be collected from parts of the roof incorporating flues from wood burners without a high degree of filtration. Overflows or discharge pipes from roof-mounted appliances such as air-conditioners or hot-water systems should not have their discharge feed into a rainwater tank.

"Copper Poisoning," a 2010 news article, linked copper poisoning to plastic tanks. The article indicated that rainwater was collected and stored in plastic tanks and that the tank did nothing to mitigate the low pH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2010/11/24/3075218.htm |title=Copper poisoning linked to plastic water tanks |accessdate=2010-11-28 |work=ABC South East NSW}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water was then brought into homes by copper piping. The copper was released by the high acid rainwater and caused poisoning in humans. It is important to note that, while the plastic tank is an inert container, the collected acid rain could and should be analysed and pH adjusted before being brought into a domestic water supply system. The solution is to monitor stored rainwater with ''swimming pool strips,'' cheap and available at swimming pool supply outlets.

If the water is too acidic, the state, county or local health officials may be contacted to obtain advice, precise solutions and pH limits, and guidelines as to what should be used to treat rainwater to be used as domestic drinking water.

Maintenance includes checking roofs and [[rain gutter]]s for [[vegetation]] and [[debris]], maintaining [[Sieve|screens]] around the tank, and occasionally [[wikt:desludging|desludging]] (removing [[sediment]] by draining and cleaning the tank of algae and other contaminants).

Rainwater tanks which are not properly sealed (secured at the top) may act as breeding grounds for [[mosquito]]es.&lt;ref&gt;The Sunday Age. November 25, 2007. "These flies! Will mozzies be next?". Stephen Cauchi quoting Luke Simpkin, Museum Victoria.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several options for dealing with the mosquito issue are:
1. Flushing ALL water once a week
2. Using a small amount of cooking oil to suffocate the larvae (the water is still ok for landscape use after this)
3. Adding the bacillus Bt to the water. This bacteria will not harm animals.
4. Adding mosquito eating fish

Another way to store rainwater without worry of contamination by mosquitoes is to use underground storage tanks.  Underground tanks keep the water too cool ({{convert|12.8|C|F}}) for mosquito larvae and also are dark, preventing both mosquito, bacterial, and algae growth. An article by Richard Hill goes into depth about the benefits of underground rainwater storage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whitewaterlimited.com/BacterialActivityinHarvestedRainWater.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tanks ==
[[File:Rain-IBC-Example.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Example of caged IBC totes being used for rainwater harvesting]]
Rainwater tanks may be constructed from materials such as plastic ([[polyethylene]]), [[concrete]], [[galvanized steel]], as well as [[fiberglass]] and [[stainless steel]] which are rust and chemical-resistant. Those most safely used are typically [[Upcycling|upcycled]] from previous food-grade purposes. Intermediate bulk containers (IBCs), caged IBC totes in particular, are very commonly used in rainwater applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibctanks.com/rainwater|title=Rainwater IBC Tanks|last=|first=|date=|website=IBCTanks.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full tanks are usually installed above ground, and are usually [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] to prevent the exposure of stored water to sunlight, to decrease [[algal bloom]].&lt;ref name="twdb"/&gt;

Tanks may be [[seal (mechanical)|covered]] and have screen inlets to exclude [[insect]]s, [[debris]], animals and [[bird droppings]]. Almost all steel tanks currently produced for household rainwater collection come with a plastic inner lining to increase the life of the tank, prevent leaks and protect the [[water quality]].

Apart from [[rooftop]]s, tanks may also be set up to collect rainwater from concrete [[patio]]s, [[driveway]]s and other [[impervious surface]]s.

Initial sizes typically ranged in capacity from around {{convert|400 to 100,000|litres|gal}}, today modern technology has allowed modular and scalable applications to go into sizes of millions of litres or hundreds of thousands of US [[gallon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.atlantiscorp.com.au/case_studies/Case_Study_Rainwater_Harvesting_Amberley_QLD_AUSTRALIA.pdf|title= Water management for life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller tanks, such as the plastic ([[44 gallon drum|{{convert|208|litre|gal}}-barrel]]) are also used in some cases. Modern modular systems which are scalable, like the {{convert|193|litre|gal}} [[Rainwater Hog|Rainwater HOG]] module&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/12/how_design_can.php|title=How Design Can Save Us: Waterhog and Groundhog|author=|date=|website=treehugger.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 500 litre (133 gallon) Stratco Aquabarrel&lt;ref&gt;[http://stratco.com.au/products/rainwater_tanks/rainwater_tanks.asp Stratco Rainwater Tanks - square tanks, metal rainwater tank, aqua tanks, stratco tank, modular rain water tank&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to decentralize the rainwater catchment by storing smaller volumes at each downspout.  Larger tanks are commonly used where there is no access to a [[centralised water supply]]. Companies such as [[Solar Survival Architecture]] recommend  a {{convert|1135|litre|gal}} tank for a house supporting two people (if [[compost toilet]]s are placed) and if the region receives at least {{convert|762|mm|in|abbr=on}} of precipitation a year. If it receives less (between {{convert|254-762|mm|in|abbr=on}}, 2 or 3 of these 300-gallon tanks can be placed so that more rain can be gathered at times when it does rain. Also affecting tank size is predicted rainfall and rainfall variability; the higher prices for larger tanks; intended use of rainwater and typical consumption for these uses; the area of roof draining into the tank; security of supply desired.[[Image:Rainwater tanks 01 pengo.jpg|thumb|right|250x250px|Large polyethylene rainwater tanks being installed.]]Most rainwater catchment tanks used throughout the world are composed of virgin polyethylene, a substance which in the USA is both FDA and NSF approved for potable water storage.  Other types of tanks used for rainwater storage include fiberglass, galvanized metal, stainless steel, and concrete.  Each type of tank has positive and negative aspects.  Polyethylene tanks, when placed above ground, can be subject to algae growth as well as the possibility of a short life (@20 years) due to normal UV exposure in sunlight. The very strong fiberglass tanks must undergo a specific coating process to be brought up to potable grade.  Galvanized tanks must either be lined or coated both for potability as well as to prevent the inevitable rusting at any welded seams. Uncoated galvanized tanks will leach zinc into the stored water and are not recommended in most instances - certainly not for water stored for human consumption. Concrete tanks leach a more benign substance - lime - into stored water and many are used around the world for rainwater storage.

One method of harvesting rain water has been is modular, scalable systems which are installable underground. These came as an evolution of a [[geosynthetic]] applications called [[Geosynthetic#Drainage / Infiltration Cells|Infiltration Tanks]], which when stacked provide a void space volume which allows for the storing of water. Improved and more cost effective industrial design now allow for theoretically limitless storage of water underground. Examples of these modular structures are Atlantis Matrix Tanks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlantiscorp.com.au/case_studies/Case_Study_Rainwater_Harvesting_Manly_NSW_Australia.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226070951/http://www.atlantiscorp.com.au/case_studies/Case_Study_Rainwater_Harvesting_Manly_NSW_Australia.pdf |archivedate=2011-02-26 |df= }} Case study of use of Matrix Tanks for stormwater harvesting&lt;/ref&gt; used in the Manly Stormwater Treatment and Re-use project of [[Manly Council]] in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.northernbeaches.nsw.gov.au/|title=Council|author=|date=13 July 2017|website=Northern Beaches Council|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water supply augmentation==
In some cities, installation of rainwater tanks may be mandatory, or may help a new building be approved. For example, in [[Victoria, Australia]] new houses which have rainwater tank connected to all flush toilets are given an additional 1-star of the required 5-star [[House Energy Rating]]. Some governments subsidise purchases of rainwater tanks or provide rebates in areas where they are considered an important means of water supply augmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sustainability.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/Energy_Effeciency.pdf |title=Energy efficiency for Victoria, action plan |accessdate=2007-05-22 |format=pdf |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, Santa Fe County, New Mexico requires a rainwater collection system on all new construction with greater than 2,500 square feet, mostly for landscaping purposes and to prevent over-reliance on wells but in some instances because ground water is prohibitively expensive to obtain, if even available.

Rainwater to supplement drinking water supplies may be seen as an alternative to other water supply options such as [[reclaimed water|recycling]] or seawater [[desalination]]. Tanks are often perceived to have environmental costs that are comparatively lower than other water supply augmentation options.

Rainwater collection can be made compatible with centralised water supply by tapping it using an [[electropump]].

Widespread use of rain barrels also changes the amount of rainwater reaching the ground in a particular area and draining into streams.  Depending on the climate, this either helps prevent erosion, sedimentation, and/or pollution, and can reduce the strain on stormwater drainage systems; or it could cause rivers to dry up and ponds to stagnate if the water is diverted to a different watershed.  If collected water is used in the same watershed in which it is collected, rainwater collection actually can stabilize flow in rivers and provide more regular and filtered groundwater transfer into ponds.

===Colorado law===
In the State of [[Colorado]], United States, the installation of rainwater collection barrels is subject to the Constitution of the State of Colorado, state statutes and case law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.state.co.us/pubs/policies/waterharvesting.pdf |title=Water harvesting in Colorado |accessdate=2007-08-30|format=pdf |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070816004100/http://water.state.co.us/pubs/policies/waterharvesting.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a consequence of the system of water rights in the state; the movement and holding of rainwater is inextricably linked with ownership of water rights and is enshrined in the [[constitution]] of the State of Colorado.  The use of water in Colorado and other [[Western United States|western states]] is governed by what is known as the [[prior appropriation doctrine]]. This system of water allocation controls who uses how much water, the types of uses allowed, and when those waters can be used. This is often referred to as the priority system or "first in time, first in right." Since all water arriving in Colorado has been allocated to "senior water right holders" since the 1850s, rainwater prevented from running downstream may not be available to its rightful owner. In 2009, legislation in Colorado was enacted that permits capture of rain water for residential use subject to strong limitations and conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.state.co.us/DWRIPub/Documents/DWR_RainwaterFlyer.pdf|title=New information on rainwater collection legislation|last=Colorado Division of Water Resources|date=2009-07-01|accessdate=2009-07-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429133815/http://water.state.co.us/DWRIPub/Documents/DWR_RainwaterFlyer.pdf|archivedate=2012-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be permitted, a residence may not be connected to a domestic water supply system serving more than 3 single-family dwellings. The permit must be purchased from the State Engineer's office and is subject to water usage restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.co.us/clics/clics2009a/csl.nsf/billcontainers/49D4349AC4A73794872575370071F5D4/$FILE/080_enr.pdf|title=Colorado Senate Bill 09-080|last=Colorado General Assembly|date=2009-07-01|accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal rainwater tank==
Rainwater tanks or drums may be used inside a house to provide thermal mass for a [[trombe wall]] (or '''water wall''').  [[Rainwater Hog]] modular tanks invented by [[Sally Dominguez]] to fit within building structure were used in the Modabode House of the Future floor and on the foyer wall of the Department of Sustainability building in Anglesea, Victoria, harnessing the higher value of the stored rainwater to add effective thermal mass to the enclosed spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecoolhunter.net/eco-world/ECO-HOME/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013022527/http://www.thecoolhunter.net/eco-world/ECO-HOME/ |archivedate=2008-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specially designed rainwater tanks can also be embedded in or under the [[concrete slab]] of a building (''stab tank'').

A house in Cape Schanck [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], Australia uses an internal rainwater tank to provide cooling to the living room in summer. During winter the tank is drained and wrapped in an insulating jacket. The tank also provides structural support to the roof, and excess water is used for domestic use including drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://materialicio.us/2008/02/07/cape-schank-house-paul-morgan-architects/|title=materialicio.us is registered with pair Domains|author=|date=|website=materialicio.us|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalconstruct.net/awards_search?option=showaward&amp;entryno=2007030374|title=architecture.com.au - The Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA), architecture, architects, design, australia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=globalconstruct.net|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stephen Molyneux''' (born [[Walton, Liverpool|Walton]], [[Liverpool]], 24 February 1955) is a British [[educational technologist]] whose work as [[Microsoft]] Professor of Advanced Learning Technology and is an Apple Distinguished Educator has led to him influencing the use of technologies across the British School system. His use of technology across public life led to his resigning as a [[Justice of the Peace]] on 25 April 2009 due to his refusal to stop reporting on Twitter the outcome of public criminal hearings.

After spending 16 years in the multimedia and education industry working for ATARI, AriolaSoft and the German Ministry of Education and Science, Molyneux returned to the UK in 1991 when he founded, together with John Rodgers of TIME, the European Multimedia Awards{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}. During the 1990s the EMMAs became one of the most prestigious awards in the Multimedia Industry, attracting as sponsors and judges pioneers of multimedia such as [[Douglas Adams]]{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}.

For his pioneering work he was appointed, as one of only 25 people world-wide, a visiting [[ICL Fellows|Fellow]] of the British Computer giant [[International Computers Limited|ICL]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of ICL Fellows]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, whilst holding the Microsoft Chair of Advanced Learning Technologies at the [[University of Wolverhampton]], he developed one of the first Virtual Learning Environments.&lt;ref&gt;[[History of virtual learning environments|History of Virtual Learning Environments]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, as a [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]] media fellow{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}, he developed with Ed Briffa, Editor of the BBC Science programme [[Tomorrow's World]], one of the first real-time online science magazines.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The magazine was set up to report live from the Annual Festival of Science held at [[University of Birmingham]].

In 2002 he was appointed by [[Estelle Morris]], the then Secretary of Education as a member of the Post-16 eLearning Strategy Taskforce. The taskforce was chaired by Steve Morrison, CEO of [[ITV Network|ITV]]. The report was published in July 2002 under the title "Getting on with IT".
In 2003 he proposed and attracted funding for an [http://www.e-innovationcentre.co.uk/ "e-Innovation Centre"] at the university which could combine the research and development skills of the higher education sector with that of industry to promote Internet-based start-up companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/new-role-beckons-for-net-expert/176261.article/|title=New role beckons for net expert|publisher=Times Higher Education|date=2003-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, UK Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] announced £200 million to develop such technology centres as part of the government strategy to enhance UK growth.&lt;ref name="cam"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/public-sector/3245733/government-allocates-200m-to-hi-tech-development-centres/|title=Government allocates £200m to hi-tech development centres|publisher=ComputerWorld UK|date=2010-10-25|accessdate=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 he was appointed advisor to the UK Deputy Chief of Defence Staff to monitor the evaluation of a [[Defence Training Review]] initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmwelaf/1129/112906.htm UK Parliament Select Committee on Welsh Affairs] Fourth Report - 13 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Molyneux worked closely with [[Cambridge University Press]] and [[Abilene Christian University]] in [[Texas]] on redefining the 'textbooks' and the use of technologies to support mobile learning.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}


In 2012 he founded the Tablet Academy {{cite web |url=http://www.tablet-academy.com/ |title=Tablet Academy Website}} as an education consultancy and teacher training organisation focusing on the use of tablet technology in the classroom and in 2014 took up a visiting post as International Professor of Global Education Leadership working alongside Dr. George Saltsman in the College of Education and Human Development at [[Lamar University]]. (As a visiting academic based in the UK, Molyneux is not listed as a full faculty member &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.lamar.edu/educational-leadership/center-for-doctoral-studies/faculty/index.html|title=Faculty of the Center for Doctoral Studies, Lamar University in Texas|access-date=2016-02-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216092054/http://education.lamar.edu/educational-leadership/center-for-doctoral-studies/faculty/index.html|archive-date=2016-02-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

He is a former patron of [[Shropshire]] [[Young Enterprise]]{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} and from 2003-2007 was Mayor of [[Oakengates]], in [[Telford]] where he currently resides. He broadcasts occasionally on [[BBC Radio Shropshire]] Morning Show on issues relating to technology and in October 2009  was elected to the West Midlands regional committee of the [[British Science Association]]. As a former serving member of the Royal Air Force he is an active member of the [[Royal Air Force Association]] and works closely with the RAF STEM Ambassadors Education outreach programme at [[RAF Cosford]] and [[RAF Waddington]]. 

In 2018 he relocated to Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands looking to support Schools and Young Learners on the Island in association with the Fuerteventura Technology Park.

A '''suitability model''' is a model that weights locations relative to each other based on given criteria. Suitability models might aid in finding a favorable location for a new facility, road, or habitat for a species of bird.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Wade, T. and Sommer, S. eds. A to Z GIS&lt;/ref&gt; Overlay analysis is a common method for creating a suitability model which involves using [[GIS]] techniques and software.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;“Understanding overlay analysis”. Esri. http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.2/index.html#//009z000000rs000000&lt;/ref&gt; Overlay techniques were originally advanced by [[Ian McHarg]] who used a manual overlay [[cartographic]] process which he describes in his 1969 book Design with Nature.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Malczewski, J. 2004. “GIS-based land-use suitability analysis: a critical overview”. Progress in Planning, 62(1), 3-65. {{cite web |url=http://ced.berkeley.edu/courses/fa11/ldarch254/www11/readings/Malczewski_2004.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218173915/http://ced.berkeley.edu/courses/fa11/ldarch254/www11/readings/Malczewski_2004.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advancement of computer mapping software, suitability modeling has become much easier and faster to implement, and today it is used for many varying tasks.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

== Overview ==
There are seven general steps required to create an acceptable suitability model: 
# Define the problem
# Break the problem into submodels
# Determine significant layers
# Reclassify or transform the data within a layer
# Weight the input layers
# Add or combine the layers
# Analyze &lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Mitchell, A. 2012. The Esri Guide to GIS Analysis, Volume 3: Modeling Suitability, Movement, and Interaction. Esri Press. http://esripress.esri.com/display/index.cfm?fuseaction=display&amp;websiteid=215&amp;moduleid=0&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Define the Problem===
Without a clear understanding of the problem that needs to be solved a suitability model cannot be successful. All other steps in the process will contribute to the objective of solving this problem. The components of this objective should also be defined, as well as a way of knowing when the problem has been solved. Consider the issue of deforestation, to lower deforestation rates a suitability model could be created to model areas most likely to be deforested in the immediate future; laws and regulating entities could then be focused on those areas most susceptible to deforestation. The overall goal of the deforestation suitability model would be to slow the rate of deforestation.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

=== Break the Problem into Submodels ===
The complexity of most suitability modeling problems can be overwhelming and confusing; for this reason, it is advisable to break the model into [[Submodel|submodels]]. For deforestation there are many different drivers, therefore a variety of submodels would be needed. Population, population density, movement of people, elevation, slope, land cover type, hydrology, location of protected areas, soil type, laws, roads and infrastructure, the list could go on, all of these things affect where deforestation happens and the intensity. Combining these factors could lead to a submodel for physical environment (elevation, slope, land cover, land use, soil type, and hydrology), for built environment (roads, infrastructure, and other relevant transportation networks), and for demographic characteristics (population, population density, population growth rate, and poverty rate) &lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Geist, H. J., and Lambin, E. F. 2002. “Proximate Causes and Underlying Driving Forces of Tropical Deforestation”. BioScience, 52(2), 143-150. http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/2/143.short&lt;/ref&gt;
.

=== Determine Significant Layers ===
Each submodel should be defining an aspect of the overall model, and only submodel factors which contribute to solving the original problem should be included in a submodel. It is in this step that data must be gathered and layers created; for example, it may be known that deforestation usually happens a certain distance from city/road/agricultural areas, therefore a [[Euclidean distance]] tool (within a GIS software package) could be used to create a distance raster around these areas.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

=== Reclassification/Transformation ===
There are many different datasets going into the model, all with varying number systems; this means that attempting to combine these datasets would give meaningless results. Therefore, a common number scale should be chosen (usually 1 to 9 for a weighted overlay and 0 to 1 for a fuzzy overlay; with larger values signifying more favorable areas) and each dataset reclassified to the new scale (there should be a tool for this in most GIS applications).&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;“Overlay analysis approaches”. Esri. http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.2/index.html#//009z000000rt000000&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weight ===
If there is strong evidence that some factors contribute more to the main goal these factors should be weighted based on their level of contribution.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; For instance, focusing specifically on [[deforestation by region|deforestation in Africa]], previous research shows that one of the main causes of deforestation is fuel wood extraction; therefore, variables associated with fuel wood extraction should be weighted more heavily than other variables.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Matsika, R., Erasmus, B. F. N., and Twine, W. C. 2013. “Double jeopardy: The dichotomy of fuelwood use in rural South Africa”. Energy Policy, 52, 716-725. http://conferences.ufs.ac.za/dl/Userfiles/Documents/00001/583_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that weighting should not be done if a fuzzy overlay is used.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt;

=== Add/Combine ===
To complete the model, all factors must be combined, usually through a weighted overlay or fuzzy overlay technique. For a weighted overlay all the factors would be added together and reclassified to form a new data layer where high values signify more favorable locations and low values less favorable locations. A fuzzy overlay analysis produces the same type of results but through more complex methods.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt;

=== Analyze ===
Once the suitability model is complete the results should be analyzed. It is always a good idea to examine the results closely to verify that they make sense and no mistakes were made. Before the model is used the results should also be verified and validated. Ideally, the value of predictive methods based in habitat suitability to estimate for instance the population size of common species should be tested before conducting large-scale monitoring, rather than a posteriori. Although logistically challenging, this can be achieved by designing monitoring programs including an intensive sampling of abundance in ad hoc reference areas of variable size.&lt;ref name="Frías 2018"&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Frías | first1= O  | last2= Bautista | first2= L.

{{about|transparency foil|other types of foil|Foil (disambiguation)}}
[[Image:OHP-sch.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Overhead projector in operation, with a transparency being flashed]]
A '''transparency''', also known variously as a '''viewfoil''', '''foil''', or '''viewgraph''', is a thin sheet of [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] flexible material, typically [[cellulose acetate]], onto which figures can be drawn. These are then placed on an [[overhead projector]] for display to an audience. Many companies and small organizations use a system of projectors and transparencies in meetings and other groupings of people, though this system is being largely replaced by [[video projector]]s and [[interactive whiteboards]].

== Printing ==
Transparencies can be printed on [[laser printer]]s or [[copiers]].  Specialist transparencies are available for use with laser printers that are better able to handle the high temperatures present in the fuser unit. For inkjet printers, coated transparencies are available that can absorb and hold the liquid ink – although care must be taken to avoid excessive exposure to moisture, which can cause the transparency to become cloudy; they must also be loaded correctly into the printer as they are only usually coated on one side.

== Uses ==
Uses for transparencies are as varied as the organizations that use them.

Certain classes, such as those associated with [[mathematics]] or [[history]], use transparencies to illustrate a point or problem. Math classes in particular use a roll of acetate to illustrate sufficiently long problems and to create illustrations a computer cannot, due to a lack of math symbols on a standard computer keyboard. This problem is typically limited to [[high school]] and [[college]]-level mathematics, because of the inclusion of [[algebra]] and [[calculus]] courses, respectively. In recent years,{{When|date=May 2016}} more and more colleges are switching to [[digital projectors]] and [[PowerPoint]] presentations.

Aerospace companies, like [[Boeing]] and [[Beechcraft]], used transparencies for years in management meetings in order to brief engineers and relevant personnel about new aircraft designs and changes to existing designs, as well as bring up illustrated problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Serling|first=Robert J.|title=Legend and Legacy: The Story of Boeing and Its People|year=1992|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=0-312-05890-X|pages=449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some churches and other religious organizations used them to show sermon outlines and illustrate certain topics such as [[Old Testament]] battles and [[Jewish]] artifacts during worship services, as well as outline business meetings.

== Spatial light modulators (SLMs) ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}

Many [[overhead projector]]s are used with a flat-panel [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] which, when used this way, is referred to as a [[spatial light modulator]] or SLM. Data projectors are often based on some form of SLM in a projection path. An LCD is a transmissive SLM, whereas other technologies such as Texas Instrument's [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]] are reflective SLMs. Not all projectors use SLMs (e.g., some use devices that produce their own light rather than function as transparencies).  An example of non-SLM system are [[organic light-emitting diode]]s (OLEDs).

[[File:Trekking poles.jpg|thumb|right|150x350px|alt==A pair of retractable poles with black handles and three fully extended retractable sections, yellow at the top and metallic silver at the bottom, resting against a birch tree|A pair of trekking poles]]
'''Trekking poles''' (also known as '''hiking poles''', '''hiking sticks''' or '''walking poles''') are a common [[hiking]] accessory used to assist walkers with their rhythm and provide stability on rough terrain.

==Description==
[[File:Alice Manfield - Guide Alice, Mt Buffalo, c1900-30, SLV.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Mountain guide]] [[Alice Manfield]] with a long wooden walking pole in the early 1900s]]
When in use, trekking poles resemble [[ski pole]]s as they have many features in common, such as baskets at the bottom, [[rubber]]-padded handles and wrist straps. Their maximum length is usually 135&amp;nbsp;cm (54 inches), however, unlike ski poles, they are often made in two or three sections and can be extended and retracted as necessary for use and collapsed for storage or transport. When fully retracted it may be possible to attach them to a [[backpack]]. Some poles come with [[spring (device)|spring]]-loaded sections to aid walking under normal conditions and to reduce wrist strain, but such devices may only add unwanted weight and noise to the poles. They are usually made from lightweight [[aluminum]] or [[carbon]] fiber.

==Uses==
[[File:Europe a Prophecy copy K plate 04.jpg|thumb|A man bearing a hiking staff in an etching from [[William Blake]]'s ''[[Europe a Prophecy]]'' first printed in 1794. This copy of the etching is currently held by the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]]]]
Descendants of the common [[walking stick]], trekking poles are usually used by hikers for the same reasons — to provide some rhythm to their walking pace and for added support. On flat, smooth terrain they really aren't necessary although using them can increase the exercise a hiker gets from the trip, as well as increase the speed. But on less certain terrain, or steep slopes, they provide useful lateral stability, and many turn to them for help with [[knee pain]]. They can also be used as aids when climbing rocks or boulders, to probe the depth of mud or water and facilitate a crossing. When traversing steep slopes for long distances, some hikers make one pole shorter than the other to make those trips feel more as if they were taking place on level ground.

Some [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]] tents are designed to use trekking poles as [[tent]] poles. Along the same lines, trekking poles can be used to set up a [[Bivouac shelter]]. Hikers who take to [[snowshoe]]s in winter find trekking poles especially useful.

They can also be used in [[Nordic walking]] in a rural or urban environment.

==Usage==
The [[Appalachian Trail Conservancy]] (ATC) estimates that pole usage rates on the [[Appalachian Trail]] vary from 90% among [[Thru-hiking|thru-hikers]] to 10–15% among day hikers.

==Environmental impact concerns==
[[Image:Trekking pole scratches.jpg|thumb|right|An impact of trekking poles, scratches left by poles on a rock in a [[wilderness area]]]]
Some hikers have complained that pole use can leave a visible impact on the surrounding trail, for instance poking visible holes in the ground and damaging adjacent vegetation. In particular the most common complaint is that the [[Tungsten carbide|carbide]] tips leave visible white scratches on rock, and make scraping sounds. All these can detract from the [[wilderness]] experience.&lt;ref name="Appl. Trail Conf."&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jeffrey L. Marion|author2=Teresa A. Martinez|author3=Robert D. Proudman|title=Trekking Poles: Can You Save Your Knees—and the Environment?|url=http://www.kintera.org/atf/cf/{D25B4747-42A3-4302-8D48-EF35C0B0D9F1}/RGsprg01.pdf|accessdate=18 December 2016|work=The Register|agency=[[Appalachian Trail Conference]]|issue=Vol 24, No. 5|date=Spring 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221181524/http://www.kintera.org/atf/cf/%7BD25B4747-42A3-4302-8D48-EF35C0B0D9F1%7D/RGsprg01.pdf|archivedate=21 February 2014|pages=1, 10-11|language=English|format=Newsletter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Appalachian Trail Conservancy]] (ATC) recommends several measures to mitigate the [[Environmental degradation|environmental impact]] of trekking poles in accordance with [[Leave No Trace]] principles of low-impact backcountry recreation. Hikers, it says, should not only be aware of what they put their poles into, they should remove the pole baskets unless hiking in snow and use rubber tips to avoid scratch marks on rocks. On level sections, or in areas where the potential for adverse impact is high, the ATC suggests putting the poles away entirely.&lt;ref name="Appl. Trail Conf." /&gt;

==Health benefits==
"[[Nordic walking]]", a type of walking with poles, has been found to have beneficial effects on resting heart rate, blood pressure, exercise capacity, maximal oxygen consumption, and quality of life in patients with various diseases, and to be superior to brisk walking without poles and in some endpoints to jogging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tschentscher M, Niederseer D, Niebauer J |title=Health benefits of Nordic walking: a systematic review |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=76–84 | date=January  2013 |pmid=23253654 |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2012.09.043}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nordicacademy.com.au/Health%20Benefits%20of%20NW%20January%202013.pdf{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Werner E. Reichardt''' (30 January 1924 – 18 September 1992) was a German physicist and biologist who helped to establish the field of [[biological cybernetics]]. He co-founded the [[Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics]], and the ''Journal of Biological Cybernetics''.

==Life==
As a young student, Werner Reichardt was a pupil in the laboratory of [[Hans Erich Hollmann]], a pioneer of ultra-shortwave communication. Because of his knowledge he was drafted in 1941 to the German air force as a radio technician. There he came into contact with resistance elements, and built a secret radio link with the Western Allies. In 1944 Reichardt was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] and sentenced to death, but escaped, and hid in Berlin until the end of the war.

From 1946 to 1950 he studied physics at the [[Berlin Institute of Technology|Technical University of Berlin]]. From 1950 he was a doctoral student of [[Ernst Ruska]], studying solid state semiconductors at the [[Fritz-Haber-Institut]] of the [[Max-Planck-Gesellschaft]], and received his doctorate in 1952. From 1952 to 1954 he was an assistant at the Institute where his teacher [[Max von Laue]] was a large influence to his later research. During the war, Reichardt had known [[Bernhard Hassenstein]], who had studied otptomotor turning behaviour after the war. Realising these experiments could be formalised in a similar way to electronics experiments, he developed interdisciplinary theories of [[motion perception]]. In 1954, Reichardt became a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [[California Institute of Technology]] at the invitation of [[Max Delbrück]]. From 1955 he was assistant at the [[Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry]] in Göttingen under [[Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer]]. In 1958 he founded together with [[Bernhard Hassenstein]] and [[Hans Wenking]] the cybernetics research group at the [[Max-Planck-Institute of Biology]] in Tübingen. In 1968 the department was transformed into the independent [[Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics]].

Reichardt died at the age of 68 years after collapsing at the end of a symposium organised in his honour.

== Work ==
Reichardt's findings have contributed to understanding of information processing in nervous systems. From joint work (with Bernhard Hassenstein and Hans Wenking) on the visual system of insects and its effect on the flight orientation, the [[correlation model]] developed the idea that the visual system of man could be similarly investigated, and led to a general theory of motion perception

=== Reichardt detectors ===
''See [[Motion perception#First-order motion perception]]''&lt;br&gt;
In the 1950s, Reichardt, along with Hassenstein proposed a model of how a neuron receiving input from photoreceptors, which only respond to changes in luminance, could be used to compute motion. Each photoreceptor, responded to a change in luminance at a given location in visual space. Comparison of the phase shift of activity in adjacent cells indicated the direction of movement from one neuron's receptive field to the other. This model of micro-circuitry became known as a Reichardt detector. Whilst there is experimental evidence consistent with the hypothetical behaviour of a Reichardt detector, the corresponding circuitry has not yet been found.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neuro.mpg.de/30089/modelfly&lt;/ref&gt;

In honor of Reichardt's pioneering work, the Tübingen cluster of excellence [[Werner Reichardt Centre for Integrative Neuroscience]] (CIN; founded 2007/2008) was named after him.
