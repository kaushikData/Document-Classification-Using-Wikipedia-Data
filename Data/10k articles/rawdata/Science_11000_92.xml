      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7960">'''CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer''' (CLAS) is a nuclear and particle physics detector located in the experimental Hall B at [[Jefferson Lab]]oratory in [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]], [[Virginia]], United States. It is used to study the properties of the nuclear matter by the collaboration of over 200 physicists (CLAS Collaboration) from many countries all around the world.

The 0.5 to 12.0 GeV electron beam from the accelerator of [[Jefferson Lab]]oratory is brought into "Hall B", the experimental hall that houses the CLAS system. Electrons or photons in the incoming beam collide with the nuclei of atoms in the physics "target" located at the center of CLAS. These collisions generally produce new particles, often after the target nucleons (protons and neutrons) are briefly excited to heavier-mass versions of the familiar protons and neutrons. A whole variety of intermediate-mass short-lived particles called "mesons" can be created. Scattered electron as well as the longer-lived produced particles travel through the CLAS detector, where they are measured. Particle physicists use these measurements to deduce the underlying structure of protons and neutrons and to better understand the interactions that create these new particles.

The CLAS detector system was operational from 1998 until May 2012.  From that time onward, analysis of archived data continued for some years, as can be traced in the publications.  Since 2012, a similar but new system called CLAS12 was constructed, which began operations with particle beams in 2017.

== Overview of Detector Function ==

The CLAS detector was notable among devices in the area of hadronic particle physics in that it had a very large acceptance; in other words, it measured the momentum and angles of almost all of the particles produced in the electron-proton collisions. Roughly spherical, the detector measured 30 feet across. It surrounded the physics target, which was typically a small cylinder of liquid hydrogen (hydrogen's nucleus is composed of a single proton) or deuterium (with a nucleus consisting of a neutron and a proton).

Each particle-target collision is called an "event". An elaborate data acquisition system records each event measured by the particle detectors, up to several thousand events per second on average. This data is then transferred to a "farm" of computing processors. Teams of physicists analyze the events, looking for new kinds of particles or information related to the underlying structure of the proton.

== Detector Description ==

A diagram of the CLAS detector is shown in the Figure, as well as a photograph of the detector when it was partially pulled open for maintenance.  The physics target is at the center.  Charged particles are detected in almost all directions, excluding the very forward (beam) and backward (beam) directions, and also excluding azimuthal directions occupied by six toroidal magnetic field coils.
The detector was designed in a nested form, with successive layers of particle detectors to either track particle paths or record particle flight-times.  The toroidal magnet field causes charged particle from the target to bend in arcs either toward or away from the beam line.  Particles leaving the target first pass through a timing counter to register the beginning of their trajectories.  The particles then traverse three packages of drift chambers which are used to track their paths though the magnetic field, and thereby allow determination of their momentum.

Outside the magnetic field, a layer of timing detectors measure the time of passage of the particles at a distance of about four meters from the target. Dividing the path length of a particle track by the time of travel gives the speed. Knowing the momentum and speed of a particle leads to its identification via its mass. The CLAS detector also contains additional detectors in the forward direction ([[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov]] counters and [[Calorimeter (particle physics)|Electromagnetic Calorimeters]]) whose purpose is to distinguish electrons from other types of particles such as pions.

== Physics Program ==

Two categories of experiments were carried out with CLAS:  using electrons in the beam and using so-called real photons created using the electron beam.  Experiments using electron scattering primarily probe the structure of protons and their excitations at various sub-nuclear "length scales".  Experiments using real photon beams primarily probe the production and decay of mesons and excited baryons.

A list of the scientific and technical papers resulting from the CLAS program is linked at the bottom of this article. The range of questions addressed is broad, as seen in the following list of topics given in no particular order:
* Inelastic electron scattering on the nucleon to study the creation and decay of nucleon excited states
* Hyperon photo- and electro-production, exploring the spectrum of ground state and excited strange baryons
* Meson photoproduction off the nucleon, searching for mesonic states not accounted for in the quark model
* Electro-disintegration of nuclear targets to study the correlations among nucleons within the nucleus
* Deep-inelastic electron scattering with meson production using polarized beam and/or target to study the full 3D distribution of quarks inside the nucleon

A '''catkin''' or '''ament''' is a slim, cylindrical [[flower]] cluster (a [[spike (botany)|spike]]), with inconspicuous or no [[petal]]s, usually [[wind]]-[[pollination|pollinated]] ([[anemophily|anemophilous]]) but sometimes insect-pollinated (as in ''[[Salix]]'').  They contain many, usually [[plant sexuality|unisexual]] flowers, arranged closely along a central stem which is often drooping.  They are found in many [[plant]] families, including [[Betulaceae]], [[Fagaceae]], [[Moraceae]], and [[Salicaceae]]. For some time, they were believed to be a key [[synapomorphy]] among the proposed [[Hamamelididae]], also known as Amentiferae (''i.e.'', literally plants ''bearing aments''). Based on [[molecular phylogeny]] work, it is now believed that Hamamelididae is a [[polyphyletic]] group.&lt;ref name="Salvolainen et al. 2000"&gt;Savolainen, V., M. W. Chase, S. B. Hoot, C. M. Morton, D. E. Soltis, C. Bayer, M. F. Fay, A. Y. De Bruijn, S. Sullivan, and Y.-L. Qiu. 2000. Phylogenetics of flowering plants based on combined analysis of plastid ''atpB'' and ''rbcL'' gene sequences. Systematic Biology 49:306-362.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="soltis2011"&gt;Soltis, D. E. et alii. (28 authors). 2011. "Angiosperm phylogeny: 17 genes, 640 taxa". ''American Journal of Botany'' '''98'''(4):704-730. {{doi|10.3732/ajb.1000404}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the catkin flower arrangement has arisen at least twice independently by [[convergent evolution]], in [[Fagales]] and in [[Salicaceae]].&lt;ref name="Cronk et al. 2015"&gt;Cronk Q. C. B., Needham I., and Rudall P. J. 2015. Evolution of catkins: inflorescence morphology of selected Salicaceae in an evolutionary and developmental context. ''Frontiers in Plant Science''. 2015; 6: 1030. {{doi|10.3389/fpls.2015.01030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a convergent evolution raises questions about what the [[ancestral]] inflorescence characters might be and how catkins did evolve in these two lineages.

In many of these plants, only the male flowers form catkins, and the female flowers are single ([[hazel]], [[oak]]), a cone ([[alder]]) or other types ([[mulberry]]).  In other plants (such as [[Populus|poplar]]) both male and female flowers are borne in catkins.

Catkin-bearing plants include many other [[trees]] or [[shrub]]s such as [[birch]], [[willow]], [[hickory]], [[chestnut|sweet chestnut]] and  [[sweetfern]] (''Comptonia'').

The word ''catkin'' is a [[loanword]] from the old [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''katteken'', meaning "kitten", on account of the resemblance to a [[kitten]]'s tail.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Catkin|journal=Oxford English Dictionary|edition=Second|date=1989|accessdate=30 November 2009|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50034696}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ament'' is from the [[Latin]] ''amentum'', meaning "thong" or "strap".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ament|journal=Oxford English Dictionary|edition=Second|date=1989|accessdate=30 November 2009|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50007124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occurrence ==
In Britain, they can be seen in January or February, when many trees are bare for winter.  They can even occur in December.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/earth/story/20150127-an-early-hazel-catkin-year An early catkin year]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lieutenant-Colonel]] C A Henn-Collins, [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|CEng]], [[Institution of Engineering and Technology#Categories of membership|FIEE]], FIERE served in the Second World War, notably, in the Polish Campaign under General Carton de Wiart.  After the war Henn-Collins was a prolific inventor, including the first transistorised quartz clock.

==Early life==

Born in 1915, Christopher Henn-Collins was the third son of Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. [[Richard Henn Collins]], [[Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], and grandson of [[Lord Collins]], [[Master of the Rolls]] from 1901 to 1907. He was educated at [[Shrewsbury]], and destined for a military career in his father's regiment, but pleaded to be allowed to pursue his boyhood ambition to be a telecommunications engineer. In 1934 he enlisted as a Gentleman Cadet at the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich|Royal Military Academy]] at [[Woolwich]] for signals training and was commissioned in 1935.

==Polish Campaign==

''Main article [[Invasion of Poland (1939)]]''

&lt;ref&gt;Warner, P, ''The Vital Link: Post-War History of the Royal Signals, 1945–1987''&lt;/ref&gt;
After service in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] he earned the dubious distinction of being possibly the first serving officer to come under enemy fire in the first few hours of the [[second World War]]. In August 1939, when he was Brigade Signals Officer to the 1st [[Brigade of Guards]], he had been ordered to lead a detachment of signallers and their equipment into [[Poland]], as part of a British Military Mission under the command of the battle-scarred veteran [[Adrian Carton de Wiart|General Carton de Wiart]], [[Victoria Cross|VC]], blinded in one eye and with an artificial hand. Their objective was to set up radio communications between Mission HQ in [[Warsaw]], the UK and units of the Polish army. They were to travel in plain clothes, but with battle-dress in their kit, and six tons of equipment, through France to [[Marseilles]], where [[HMS Shropshire (73)|HMS Shropshire]] would take them to [[Alexandria]].  There they were issued with passports and fictitious occupations, before trans-shipping to a ferry en route to [[Turkey]], by which time Britain and France were at war with Germany. From there they travelled by rail through [[Romania]], setting up radio communications along the way.

By the time they crossed the Polish frontier southeast of Warsaw, German armoured divisions were driving east towards the capital, and their reconnaissance planes were taking an interest in this strange convoy, which was now in a war zone. The detachment was ordered to change into uniform. In [[Lvov]] they were under heavy fire from low-flying aircraft: they could not move forward, nor could they stay put, risking further attentions from the [[Luftwaffe]]. For several nights they shuttled to and fro a few miles west to east and back again, awaiting instructions, and it was not until 8 September when they rendezvoused with General de Wiart, who had moved his headquarters from Warsaw to [[Tarnopol]], that their mission was abandoned. They were ordered to destroy their equipment, and make their way home in twos and threes as best they could. Back in Alexandria Henn-Collins's instructions were to return to London where he was posted to [[Staff College, Camberley|Staff College at Camberley]], and wrote a critical report on the lessons to be learned from this expedition.

Although the mission was aborted, the outcome would have been quite different if the [[Russians]] had not invaded. The Poles had plans to conduct a [[guerrilla war]] in the east, and a British Signals unit behind the lines would have been of considerable use to [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]].

==Later wartime postings==

For Henn-Collins various postings during the next three years included a period in the Directorate of Military Training, and promotion to [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]]. And then, with the rank of [[Lieutenant-Colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]], to Allied Forces Headquarters in [[Algiers]] as Officer in Charge of Radio Section, to set up links throughout the [[North African Campaign|North African Theatre]].

==Post-war engineering career and retirement==

He was a resourceful, inventive and practical engineer. He patented an enciphering and deciphering machine,&lt;ref&gt;GB patent 1605232, 30-5-85 ''Encyphering and Decyphering Machines''
&lt;/ref&gt; assigned to the [[Ministry of Supply]] with no financial benefit to himself; and he had so many ideas for civilian projects which could not be exploited within the service that he resigned his commission in 1947 in order to set up as a consulting engineer.

Partly as a result of his wartime contacts, his company, [[Henn-Collins Associates]], undertook a wide range of projects for government agencies and commercial organisations worldwide, mostly in the field of telecommunications,&lt;ref&gt;GB patent GB846895, 29-6-65 ''Electronic indicator system more particularly for use in mines''&lt;/ref&gt; but he had other interests as well, and in the 1950s and 60s he patented a number of devices of an electro-mechanical nature.&lt;ref&gt;US patent 2900848, 25-8-59 ''Mechanical selective positioning mechanism''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GB Patent GB807672, 25-8-59 ''Selective positioning mechanisms''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GB patent 778408, 10-7-57 ''Improvements in and relating to mechanical selective positioning mechanisms''&lt;/ref&gt; In his workshop he developed his idea for a quartz crystal clock which by using [[transistor]]s in place of [[thermionic valve]]s, made possible a much smaller [[quartz clock]] than was previously feasible. He described his "mantelpiece" clock in the ''British Horological Journal'' in 1957 and showed it at an exhibition in [[Goldsmiths' Hall]] in 1958, "The Pendulum to the Atom", which was opened by the [[Duke of Edinburgh]]. Christopher Henn-Collins and Dr [[Louis Essen]], inventor of the [[Atomic clock|caesium clock]] were presented to him.

Before he retired to [[Guernsey]] in 1970 he represented the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]] and the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|Institution of Electrical and Radio Engineers]] on a [[British Standards Institution]] committee which produced a Code of Practice&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsi-global.com/en/Shop/Publication-Detail/?pid=000000000000098486] 
BS 6330:1983 ''Code of practice for reception of sound and television broadcasting''&lt;/ref&gt; for the reception of sound and television broadcasting. He returned to England three years before his death.

==Personal life==

He married first Patricia Hooper, who died in 1974, and in 1976 he married Andora de Quehen who survives him.

'''Denise L. Herzing''' is the founder and Research Director of the Wild Dolphin Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wilddolphinproject.org/|title=Wild Dolphin Project|last=|first=|date=|website=Wild Dolphin Project|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a non-profit which funds the study of the natural behaviors and communication of [[Atlantic spotted dolphin]]s in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dolphin Diaries: My 25 Years with Spotted Dolphins in the Bahamas|last=Herzing|first=Denise|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0312-60896-5|location=New York, NY|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herzing has earned her Ph. D. in Behavioral Biology/Environmental Studies, her M. A. in Behavioral Biology, and her B. S. in Marine Zoology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wilddolphinproject.org/about-us/our-team/|title=Our Team|last=|first=|date=|website=The Wild Dolphin Project|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her ultimate aim is to achieve two-way communication with dolphins. She hopes to use a [[Wearable computer|wearable]] underwater computer to record and make dolphin sounds. The computer aims to create synthesized dolphin sounds that can be established between sound and object, so the hope is for dolphins to imitate the sound in order to make requests from people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/science/20dolphin.html|title=A Dolphin Study Seeks to Start a Two-Way Conversation|last=Olsen|first=Erik|date=2011-09-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herzing has contributed extensively to the field of dolphin intelligence and communication.  Among these contributions, she has recorded observations of dolphins expressing teaching behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Bender, C. E., Hersing, D. L., Bjorklund, D. F. 2008. Evidence of teaching in atlantic spotted dolphins (''Stenella frontalis)'' by mother dolphins foraging in the presence of their calves. ''Anim Cogn.''&lt;/ref&gt; She also worked as part of a team that developed a new camera/hydrophone system which allows researchers to identify which dolphin on a recording made which sound.  This device pairs a video camera with three hydrophones, recordings from the device can be used to assess the directionality of a sound moving through water.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann-Kuhnt, M., Herzing, D., Ho, A., Chitre, M. A. 2016. Whose sound is it anyway? Identifying the vocalizer on underwater video by localizing with a hydrophone array. ''Animal Behavior and Cognition.'' 3(4): 288-298.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to her expertise in studying dolphin intelligence, Herzing has described a method for unbiased quantification of nonhuman intelligence which can be applied to other animals as well as dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herzing|first=Denise|date=2014|title=Profiling nonhuman intelligence: An exercise in developing unbiased tools for describing other "types" of intelligence on earth|url=|journal=Acta Astronautica|volume=94|pages=676–680|via=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Diploma in Engineering''' or '''Diploma in Technical Education''' are programs focused on practical and skills-oriented training. It is a technical degree that only covers the essentials when ranked with an undergraduate engineering degree. It aims to provide students with industry or job related engineering knowledge, scientific skills, computing &amp; analysis, mathematical techniques, a sound knowledge of English to communicate in the field and ability to apply problem solving techniques.

Its duration is 2–3 years. Many countries in the world recognize it as equivalent to Pre-Engineering or Bridging course when considered for continuing studies in engineering related bachelors or associate degree programs. After successful completion of Diploma in Engineering course, students can either continue further Engineering studies in undergraduate level or get employment as technicians, technologists, supervisors, superintendents, foremen, machinist, workshop technicians, draughtsman, station technicians (energy, thermal, aeronautical), automobile technicians, maintenance &amp; service technicians, equipment mechanics and technicians, [[CAD/CAM]] programmer, agricultural overseers, instrument technicians, junior instructors, manufacturing, tool and die designers, electricians...etc.

In most of the countries one can apply for studying diploma in engineering degree after completion of [[10th grade]] ([[Secondary School Certificate]]).

The '''Director of the Royal Greenwich Observatory''' was the senior scientist responsible for the administration of the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]] from 1972 until the institution's closure in 1998.

==History==
Executive responsibility for the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]], [[London]], 
had rested with the [[Astronomer Royal]] from the institution's foundation 
in 1675. This practice continued when the observatory moved to 
[[Herstmonceux Castle]] in 1948 and was renamed the Royal Greenwich 
Observatory.&lt;ref name="mccrea_rgo_1975"&gt;{{cite book

 | publisher = [[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]] 
 | date = 1975 
 | location = London 
 | bibcode = 1975rgo..book.....M
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the title Astronomer Royal was separated from directorship of 
the observatory after the retirement of [[Richard Woolley]] in 1971.
Following this, [[Margaret Burbidge]] was appointed Director, and [[Sir Martin Ryle]] 
(1918&amp;ndash;1984) was appointed Astronomer Royal in an honorary 
capacity. The Astronomer Royal no longer had any association with the 
observatory after this time.&lt;ref name="wilkins_rgo_v1"&gt;{{

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directors took action to modernise the institution and to establish a 
[[Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes|new observatory]] on the island of [[La Palma]] 
in the [[Canary Islands]]. 
The Director oversaw the move of the Royal Greenwich Observatory from Herstmonceux 
to [[Cambridge]] in 1990, and continued in charge until the observatory was closed by the 
[[Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council]] in 1998. The post expired with

An '''extrinsic information transfer chart''', commonly called an '''EXIT chart''', is a technique to aid the construction of good iteratively-decoded [[error-correcting codes]] (in particular [[low-density parity-check code|low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes]] and [[Turbo code]]s).

EXIT charts were developed by [[Stephan ten Brink]], building on the concept of [[extrinsic information]] developed in the Turbo coding community.&lt;ref name=brink99&gt;Stephan ten Brink, Convergence of Iterative Decoding, Electronics Letters, 35(10), May 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  An EXIT chart includes the response of elements of decoder (for example a convolutional decoder of a Turbo code, the LDPC parity-check nodes or the LDPC variable nodes).   The response can either be seen as extrinsic information or a representation of the messages in [[belief propagation]]. 

If there are two components which exchange messages, the behaviour of the decoder can be plotted on a two-dimensional chart.  One component is plotted with its input on the horizontal axis and its output on the vertical axis.  The other component is plotted with its input on the vertical axis and its output on the horizontal axis.  The decoding path followed is found by stepping between the two curves.  For a successful decoding, there must be a clear swath between the curves so that iterative decoding can proceed from 0 bits of extrinsic information to 1 bit of extrinsic information.

A key assumption is that the messages to and from an element of the decoder can be described by a single number, the extrinsic information.  This is true when decoding codes from a [[binary erasure channel]] but otherwise the messages are often samples from a Gaussian distribution with the correct extrinsic information.  The other key assumption is that the messages are independent (equivalent to an infinite block-size code without local structure between the components)

To make an optimal code, the two transfer curves need to lie close to each other.  This observation is supported by the theoretical result that for capacity to be reached for a code over a binary-erasure channel there must be no area between the curves and also by the insight that a large number of iterations are required for information to be spread throughout all bits of a code.

The '''Einstein force''' is an [[apparent force]] which acts in an [[Acceleration|accelerated]] reference system.

Suppose that there are two [[Frame of reference|reference frames]] ''S'' and ''S''&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;, where ''S''&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; is moving relative to ''S''.  The origin of ''S''&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; moves along some curve in ''S'', which can be traced out by some [[Vector space|vector]] '''C''' which is a function of ''t''.  The Einstein force is the apparent force acting on a [[particle]] of [[mass]] ''m'' in the ''S''&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; frame, and is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\textbf{F}=-m{d^2\textbf{C}\over dt^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

{{Flavour quantum numbers}}

In [[particle physics]], '''flavour''' or '''flavor''' refers to the ''species'' of an [[elementary particle]]. The [[Standard Model]] counts six flavours of [[quark]]s and six flavours of [[lepton]]s. They are conventionally parameterized with ''flavour [[quantum number]]s'' that are assigned to all [[subatomic particle]]s. They can also be described by some of the [[family symmetries]] proposed for the quark-lepton generations.

==Quantum numbers==

In classical mechanics, a [[force]] acting on a [[point particle|point-like particle]] can only alter the [[particle]]'s dynamical state, i.e., its [[momentum]], angular momentum, etc.   [[Quantum field theory]], however, allows interactions that can alter other facets of a particle's nature described by non dynamical, discrete quantum numbers.  In particular, the action of the [[weak interaction|weak force]] is such that it allows the conversion of quantum numbers describing [[invariant mass| mass]] and [[electric charge]] of both quarks and leptons from one discrete type to another. This is known as a flavour change, or flavour transmutation. Due to their quantum description, flavour [[quantum state|states]] may also undergo [[quantum superposition]].

In [[atomic physics]] the principal quantum number of an [[electron]] specifies the [[electron shell]] in which it resides, which determines the [[energy level]] of the whole atom.  Analogously, the five flavour quantum numbers (isospin, strangeness, charm, bottomness or topness) can characterize the quantum state of quarks, by the degree to which it exhibits six distinct flavours (u, d, s, c, b, t).

Composite particles can be created from multiple quarks, forming [[hadron]]s, such as [[meson]]s and [[baryon]]s, each possessing unique aggregate characteristics, such as different masses, electric charges, and decay modes. A [[hadron]]'s overall flavour quantum numbers depend on the numbers of [[constituent quark]]s of each particular flavour.

===Conservation laws===
All of the various charges discussed above are conserved by the fact that the corresponding [[charge (physics)|charge operators]] can be understood as ''generators of symmetries'' that commute with the Hamiltonian. Thus, the eigenvalues of the various charge operators are conserved.

Absolutely conserved flavour quantum numbers are:
*[[electric charge]] ({{mvar|Q}})
*[[weak isospin]] ({{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}})
*[[baryon number]] ({{mvar|B}})&lt;!--including the baryon number for completeness--&gt;
*[[lepton number]] ({{mvar|L}})

In some theories, the individual baryon and lepton number conservation can be violated, if the difference between them ([[B − L|{{math|''B'' − ''L''}}]]) is conserved (see [[chiral anomaly]]). All other flavour quantum numbers are violated by the [[electroweak interaction]]s. [[Strong interaction]]s conserve all flavours.

==Flavour symmetry==&lt;!--'Flavour symmetry' redirects here--&gt;
If there are two or more particles which have identical interactions, then they may be interchanged without affecting the physics. Any (complex) linear combination of these two particles give the same physics, as long as the combinations are [[orthogonal]], or perpendicular, to each other.

In other words, the theory possesses symmetry transformations such as &lt;math&gt;M\left({u\atop d}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|d}} are the two fields (representing the various ''[[generation (particle physics)|generations]]'' of leptons and quarks, see below), and {{mvar|M}} is any {{gaps|2|×|2}} [[unitary matrix]] with a unit [[determinant]]. Such matrices form a [[Lie group]] called [[SU(2)]] (see [[special unitary group]]). This is an example of flavour symmetry.

In [[quantum chromodynamics]], flavour is a conserved [[global symmetry]]. In the [[electroweak theory]], on the other hand, this symmetry is broken, and flavour changing processes exist, such as [[quark|quark decay]] or [[neutrino oscillation]]s.

==Flavour quantum numbers==

===Leptons===
All [[lepton]]s carry a [[lepton number]] {{math|1=''L'' = 1}}. In addition, leptons carry [[weak isospin]], {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which is −{{sfrac|1|2}} for the three charged leptons (i.e. [[electron]], [[muon]] and [[tau (particle)|tau]]) and +{{sfrac|1|2}} for the three associated [[neutrino]]s. Each doublet of a charged lepton and a neutrino consisting of opposite {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} are said to constitute one [[generation (particle physics)|generation]] of leptons. In addition, one defines a quantum number called [[weak hypercharge]], {{math|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which is −1 for all [[Chirality (physics)|left-handed]] leptons.&lt;ref&gt;See table in

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weak isospin and weak hypercharge are [[Gauge Theory|gauged]] in the [[Standard Model]].

Leptons may be assigned the six flavour quantum numbers: electron number, muon number, tau number, and corresponding numbers for the neutrinos. These are conserved in strong and electromagnetic interactions, but violated by weak interactions. Therefore, such flavour quantum numbers are not of great use. A separate quantum number for each [[generation (particle physics)|generation]] is more useful: electronic lepton number (+1 for electrons and electron neutrinos), muonic lepton number (+1 for muons and muon neutrinos), and tauonic lepton number (+1 for tau leptons and tau neutrinos). However, even these numbers are not absolutely conserved, as neutrinos of different generations can [[quantum superposition|mix]]; that is, a neutrino of one flavour can [[neutrino oscillation|transform into another flavour]]. The strength of such mixings is specified by a matrix called the [[Pontecorvo–Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata matrix]] (PMNS matrix).

===Quarks===
All [[quark]]s carry a [[baryon number]] {{math|1=''B'' = {{sfrac|1|3}}}}. They also all carry [[weak isospin]], {{math|1=''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = ±{{sfrac|1|2}}}}. The positive-{{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} quarks (up, charm, and top quarks) are called ''up-type quarks'' and negative-{{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} quarks (down, strange, and bottom quarks) are called ''down-type quarks''. Each doublet of up and down type quarks constitutes one [[generation (particle physics)|generation]] of quarks.

For all the quark flavour quantum numbers listed below, the convention is that the flavour charge and the electric charge of a quark have the same [[sign (mathematics)|sign]]. Thus any flavour carried by a charged [[meson]] has the same sign as its charge. Quarks have the following flavour quantum numbers:{{clarify|the list below would be much more readable in a table|date=March 2017}}
*The third component of [[isospin]] (sometimes simply ''isospin'') ({{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}), which has value {{math|1=''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = {{sfrac|1|2}}}} for the up quark and {{math|1=''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = −{{sfrac|1|2}}}} for the down quark.
*[[Strangeness]] ({{mvar|S}}): Defined as {{math|1=''S'' = −(''n''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; − ''n''&lt;sub&gt;s&amp;#773;&lt;/sub&gt;}}), where {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} represents the number of [[strange quark]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|Strange quark}}) and {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;s&amp;#773;&lt;/sub&gt;}} represents the number of strange antiquarks ({{SubatomicParticle|Strange antiquark}}). This quantum number was introduced by [[Murray Gell-Mann]]. This definition gives the strange quark a strangeness of −1 for the above-mentioned reason.
*[[Charm (quantum number)|Charm]] ({{mvar|C}}): Defined as {{math|1=''C'' = (''n''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; − ''n''&lt;sub&gt;c&amp;#773;&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, where {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} represents the number of [[charm quark]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|charm quark}}) and {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;c&amp;#773;&lt;/sub&gt;}} represents the number of charm antiquarks. The charm quark's value is +1.
*[[Bottomness]] (or ''beauty'') ({{mvar|B&amp;prime;}}): Defined as {{math|1=''B&amp;prime;'' = −(''n''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; − ''n''&lt;sub&gt;b&amp;#773;&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, where {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;}} represents the number of [[bottom quark]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|bottom quark}}) and {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;b&amp;#773;&lt;/sub&gt;}} represents the number of bottom antiquarks.
*[[Topness]] (or ''truth'') ({{mvar|T}}): Defined as {{math|1=''T'' = (''n''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; − ''n''&lt;sub&gt;t&amp;#773;&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, where {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;}} represents the number of [[top quark]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|top quark}}) and {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;t&amp;#773;&lt;/sub&gt;}} represents the number of top antiquarks. However, because of the extremely short half-life of the top quark (predicted lifetime of only {{val |5|e=-25|u=s}}), by the time it can interact strongly it has already decayed to another flavour of quark (usually to a [[bottom quark]]). For that reason the top quark doesn't [[hadronization|hadronize]], that is it never forms any [[meson]] or [[baryon]].

These five quantum numbers, together with baryon number (which is not a flavour quantum number), completely specify numbers of all 6 quark flavours separately (as {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; − ''n''&lt;sub&gt;q&amp;#773;&lt;/sub&gt;}}, i.e. an antiquark is counted with the minus sign). They are conserved by both the electromagnetic and strong interactions (but not the weak interaction). From them can be built the derived quantum numbers:
*[[Hypercharge]] ({{mvar|Y}}): {{math|1=''Y'' = ''B'' + ''S'' + ''C'' + ''B&amp;prime;'' + ''T''}}
*[[Electric charge]]: {{math|1=''Q'' = ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + {{sfrac|1|2}}''Y''}} (see [[Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula]])

The terms "strange" and "strangeness" predate the discovery of the quark, but continued to be used after its discovery for the sake of continuity (i.e. the strangeness of each type of hadron remained the same); strangeness of anti-particles being referred to as +1, and particles as −1 as per the original definition. Strangeness was introduced to explain the rate of decay of newly discovered particles, such as the kaon, and was used in the [[Eightfold Way (physics)|Eightfold Way]] classification of hadrons and in subsequent [[quark model]]s. These quantum numbers are preserved under [[strong interaction|strong]] and [[electromagnetic interaction]]s, but not under [[weak interaction]]s.

For first-order weak decays, that is processes involving only one quark decay, these quantum numbers (e.g. charm) can only vary by 1, that is, for a decay involving a charmed quark or antiquark either as the incident particle or as a decay byproduct, {{math|Δ''C'' {{=}} ±1}}; likewise, for a decay involving a bottom quark or antiquark {{math|Δ''B&amp;prime;'' {{=}} ±1}}. Since first-order processes are more common than second-order processes (involving two quark decays), this can be used as an approximate "[[selection rule]]" for weak decays.

A special mixture of quark flavours is an [[eigenstate]] of the [[weak interaction]] part of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]],  so will interact in a particularly simple way with the [[W  and Z bosons|W bosons]]. (Charged  weak interactions violate flavor). On the other hand, a [[fermion]] of a fixed mass (an eigenstate of the kinetic and strong interaction parts of the Hamiltonian) is  an eigenstate of  flavour.   The transformation from the former basis to the flavor-eigenstate/mass-eigenstate basis for quarks underlies the [[Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix]] (CKM matrix). This matrix is analogous to the PMNS matrix for neutrinos, and quantifies flavour changes under charged weak interactions of quarks.

The CKM matrix allows for [[CP violation]] if there are at least three generations.

===Antiparticles and hadrons===
Flavour quantum numbers are additive. Hence [[antiparticle]]s have flavour equal in magnitude to the particle but opposite in sign. [[Hadron]]s inherit their flavour quantum number from their [[valence quark]]s: this is the basis of the classification in the [[quark model]]. The relations between the hypercharge, electric charge and other flavour quantum numbers hold for hadrons as well as quarks.

==Quantum chromodynamics==
:''Flavour symmetry is closely related to [[chirality (physics)|chiral symmetry]]. This part of the article is best read along with the one on [[chirality (physics)|chirality]].''

[[Quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD) contains six flavours of [[quark]]s. However, their masses differ and as a result they are not strictly interchangeable with each other. The up and down flavours are close to having equal masses, and the theory of these two quarks possesses an approximate SU(2) symmetry ([[isospin]] symmetry).

===Chiral symmetry description===

Under some circumstances{{clarify|which? would modeling a quark-gluon plasma be a good example?|date=March 2017}}, the masses of quarks do not meaningfully contribute to the system's behavior, and can be ignored. The simplified behavior of flavour transformations can then be successfully modeled as acting independently on the left- and right-handed parts of each quark field. This approximate description of the flavour symmetry is described by a chiral group {{math|SU&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;(''N''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) × SU&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;(''N''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.

===Vector symmetry description===

If all quarks had non-zero but equal masses, then this chiral symmetry is broken to the ''vector symmetry'' of the "diagonal flavour group" {{math|SU(''N''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, which applies the same transformation to both [[helicity (particle physics)|helicities]] of the quarks. This reduction of symmetry is a form of ''[[explicit symmetry breaking]]''. The amount{{clarify|previous sentence gives no indication of how an amount comes into play|date=March 2017}} of explicit symmetry breaking is controlled by the [[current quark mass]]es in QCD.

Even if quarks are massless, chiral flavour symmetry can be [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]] if the vacuum of the theory contains a [[chiral condensate]] (as it does in low-energy QCD). This gives rise to an effective mass for the quarks, often identified with the [[valence quark mass]] in QCD.

===Symmetries of QCD===
Analysis of experiments indicate that the current quark masses of the lighter flavours of quarks are much smaller than the [[QCD scale]], Λ&lt;sub&gt;QCD&lt;/sub&gt;, hence [[chiral flavour symmetry]] is a good approximation to [[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] for the up, down and strange quarks. The success of [[chiral perturbation theory]] and the even more naive [[chiral model]]s spring from this fact. The valence quark masses extracted from the [[quark model]] are much larger than the current quark mass. This indicates that QCD has spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking with the formation of a [[chiral condensate]]. [[Quark matter|Other phases of QCD]] may break the chiral flavour symmetries in other ways.

==History==
Some of the historical events that led to the development of flavour symmetry are discussed in the article on [[isospin]].

{{About|the physical concept|philosophical concepts|Fluxon (philosophy)}}

In [[physics]], a '''fluxon''' is a [[quantum]] of [[flux|electromagnetic flux]].  The term may have any of several related meanings.

==Superconductivity==
In the context of [[superconductivity]], in [[type II superconductors]] fluxons (also known as [[Abrikosov vortices]]) can form when the applied field lies between &lt;math&gt;B_{c_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_{c_2}&lt;/math&gt;. The fluxon is a small whisker of normal phase surrounded by superconducting phase, and [[Supercurrent]]s circulate around the normal core. The magnetic field through such a whisker and its neighborhood, which has size of the order of London penetration depth &lt;math&gt;\lambda_L&lt;/math&gt; (~100 nm), is quantized because of the phase properties of the [[magnetic potential|magnetic]] [[vector potential]] in [[quantum electrodynamics]], see [[magnetic flux quantum]] for details.

In the context of [[long Josephson junction|long Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor Josephson tunnel junction]]s, a '''fluxon''' (aka [[Josephson vortex]]) is made of circulating [[supercurrent]]s and has ''no'' normal core in the tunneling barrier. Supercurrents circulate just around the mathematical center of a fluxon, which is situated with the (insulating) Josephson barrier. Again, the magnetic flux created by circulating [[supercurrent]]s is equal to a [[magnetic flux quantum]] &lt;math&gt;\Phi_0&lt;/math&gt; (or less, if the superconducting electrodes of the Josephson junction are thinner than &lt;math&gt;\lambda_L&lt;/math&gt;).

==Magnetohydrodynamics modeling==
In the context of numerical [[magnetohydrodynamics|MHD]] modeling, a fluxon is a discretized magnetic field line, representing a finite amount of magnetic flux in a localized bundle in the model.  Fluxon models are explicitly designed to preserve the [[topology]] of the magnetic field, overcoming [[numerical resistivity]] effects in [[Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates|Eulerian models]].

[[Image:Orchard3.jpg|thumb|333px|right|A community apple orchard originally planted for productive use during the 1920s, in [[Westcliff on Sea]] ([[Essex]], England), illustrating long neglected trees that have recently been pruned to renew their health and cropping potential]]

'''Fruit tree pruning''' is the [[pruning|cutting and removing of selected parts]] of a [[fruit tree]]. It spans a number of [[horticulture|horticultural]] techniques. Pruning often means cutting [[branch]]es back, sometimes removing smaller limbs entirely. It may also mean removal of young [[shoot]]s, buds, and [[leaf|leaves]]. 

Established [[orchard]] practice of both [[organic farming|organic]] and nonorganic types typically includes pruning. Pruning can control growth, remove dead or diseased [[wood]], and stimulate the formation of [[flowers]] and [[bud|fruit buds]]. It is widely stated that careful attention to pruning and training young trees improves their later productivity and longevity, and that good pruning and training can also prevent later injury from weak [[tree fork|crotches or forks]] (where a tree trunk splits into two or more branches) that break from the weight of fruit, snow, or ice on the branches.

Some [[sustainable agriculture]] or [[permaculture]] personalities, such as [[Sepp Holzer]] and [[Masanobu Fukuoka]], advocate and practice no-pruning methods, which runs counter to the widespread confidence in the idea that pruning produces superior results compared with not pruning. Many books about fruit-growing assert advantages and disadvantages of pruning or not pruning, although without [[randomized controlled trial]]s, it is hard to separate [[theory|theorizing]] and [[traditional knowledge]] from [[evidence]]-based recommendations.

==Overview==
[[Image:Apple spur M D Vaden.jpg|thumb|250px|right|An apple tree sprout is being converted to a branched, fruit-bearing [[fruiting spur|spur]] by an arborist. Numbers show the sequence of cuts, which occurred during two years.]]

Plants form new tissue in an area called the [[meristem]], located near the tips of roots and shoots, where active cell division takes place. Meristem growth is aimed at ensuring that leaves are quickly elevated into sunlight, and that roots are able to penetrate deeply into the [[soil]]. Once adequate height and length is achieved by the stems and roots, they begin to thicken to support the plant. On the shoots, these growing tips of the plant are called ''apical'' buds. The ''[[apical meristem]]'' (or tip) produces the growth hormone [[auxin]], which not only promotes cell division, but also diffuses downwards and inhibits the development of lateral bud growth that otherwise competes with the apical tip for light and nutrients. Removing the apical tip and its suppressive hormone lets lower, dormant lateral buds develop, and the buds between the leaf stalk and stem produce new shoots that compete to become lead growth.

Manipulating this natural response to damage (known as the principle of [[apical dominance]]) by processes such as pruning (as well as [[coppicing]] and [[pollarding]]) allows the arborist to determine the shape, size, and productivity of many fruiting trees and bushes. The main aim when pruning fruit trees is usually to maximize fruit yield. Unpruned trees tend to produce large numbers of small fruits that may be difficult to reach when harvesting by hand. Branches can become broken by the weight of the crop, and the cropping may become [[biennial plant|biennial]] (that is, bearing fruit only every other year). Overpruned trees on the other hand tend to produce light crops of large, flavourless fruit that does not store well. Careful pruning balances shoot growth and fruit production.

One of the simplest instructions given in nearly every article or book chapter on the subject is that no branches should cross each other, that is, rub against each other, and that one of them should be selected and removed.

==Formative pruning of bush trees==
In the early years of the tree's life, it is important to develop a framework sufficiently strong to bear the weight of crops. This requires formative pruning to reinforce the tree. Formative pruning of [[apple]] (''Malus pumila'') and [[pear]] (''Pyrus communis'') trees should be carried out in the dormant winter months. For the [[Northern hemisphere]], this should occur between November and March; For the [[Southern hemisphere]], June and September. [[Prunus|Stone fruits]]—such as [[cherry|cherries]], [[plum]]s, and [[greengage|gages]]—have different requirements, and should not be pruned in dormant months.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Maiden tree===
A maiden whip (a one-year-old tree with no side shoots) should be pruned to a bud with two buds below it at about 80&amp;nbsp;cm from the ground immediately after planting to produce primary branches during the first growing season. A feathered maiden (that is, a one-year-old tree with several side branches) should have its main stem pruned back to three or four strong shoots at 80&amp;nbsp;cm from the ground. Side shoots should be shortened by two thirds of their length to an upward or outward facing bud. Lower shoots should be removed flush with the stem.

===Two year===
Remove lower shoots and prune between three and five of the best-placed shoots by half to an upwards or outwards facing bud to form what becomes the tree's main structural branches. Remove any inward-facing shoots.

===Three year===
Prune leading shoots of branches selected to extend the framework by half, to a bud facing in the desired direction. Select four good laterals to fill the framework and shorten these by a half. Prune any remaining laterals to four buds to form [[fruiting spur]]s.

===Four year===
The tree has begun to fruit and requires only limited formative pruning. Shorten leaders by one third and prune laterals not required to extend the framework to four buds.

===Five year and onwards===
The tree is established, and should be pruned annually as described in the following section.

==Pruning the cropping tree==
[[Image:Spurpruning.png|left|300px|thumb|Spur pruning]]
Before pruning, distinguish between spur-bearing varieties, tip-bearing varieties, and an intermediate between the two that bears both on spurs and at the tips. Spur-bearing trees occur more frequently than tip-bearing trees, and they bear most of their fruit yearly at the end of short lateral pieces of wood (spurs) up to about 4&amp;nbsp;inches long.

Spur-bearing types include apples of the varieties '[[Cox's Orange Pippin]]', '[[James Grieve apple|James Grieve]]' and 'Sunset', and pears such as 'Conference', 'Doyenne du Commice', and 'Williams Bon Chretien'. Tip-bearers on the other hand produce most of their fruit buds at the tips of slender shoots grown the previous summer, and include the apples '[[Worcester Pearmain]]' and 'Irish Peach', and the pears such as 'Jargonelle' and 'Josephine de Malines'. There are basically three types of pruning that are applied once the main shape of the tree has been established. These are:

[[Image:Renewalpruning.png|right|300px|thumb|Renewal pruning]]
*'''Spur pruning''': Spur bearing varieties form spurs naturally, but spur growth can also be induced.
*'''Renewal pruning''': This also depends on the tendency of many apple and pear trees to form flower buds on unpruned two-year-old laterals. It is a technique best used for the strong laterals on the outer part of the tree where there is room for such growth. Pruning long-neglected fruit trees is a task that should be undertaken over a lengthy period, with not more than one third of the branches that require removal being taken each year.
*'''Regulatory pruning''': This is carried out on the tree as a whole, and is aimed at keeping the tree and its environment healthy, e.g., by keeping the centre open so that air can circulate; removing dead or diseased wood; preventing branches from becoming overcrowded (branches should be roughly 50&amp;nbsp;cm apart and spurs not less than 25&amp;nbsp;cm apart along the branch framework); and preventing any branches from crossing.

==Pruning of tip bearers==
Tip-bearers should be pruned lightly in winter using the regulatory system (see above). Any maiden shoots less than 25&amp;nbsp;cm in length should be left untouched as they have fruit buds at their tips. Longer shoots are spur pruned to prevent overcrowding and to stimulate the production of more short-tip-bearing shoots the following year. Branch leaders are 'tipped', removing the top three or four buds to a bud facing in the desired direction to make them branch out and so produce more tip-bearing shoots.

It is fibrous, black and opaque, and often preserves details of cell wall architecture. Wood-derived fusain usually takes the form of cubic blocks, whereas fusain from other plant material may take the form of thin films which are only visible under a microscope where the surrounding rock is dissolved by [[acid maceration]].&lt;ref name=Scott2000/&gt; The material is silky and crumbles on the touch.&lt;ref name=Scott2000/&gt;
The loss of volatile elements during combustion means that fusain fossils are usually smaller than the original organism, but this same factor makes them unlikely to be eaten by any animals (for they have no nutritional value), enhancing their preservation potential.&lt;ref name=Scott2000/&gt;

Fusain shows characteristics diagnostic of [[pyrolysis]] in modern material: the cell walls of xylem are homogenized, and subsequently crack along their middles.&lt;ref name="Jones1991"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0031-0182(91)90180-Y | last1 = Jones | first1 = T. | last2 = Chaloner | first2 = W. | title = Fossil charcoal, its recognition and palaeoatmospheric significance | journal = Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology | volume = 97 | pages = 39–50 | year = 1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Information theory''' studies the [[Quantification (science)|quantification]], [[Computer data storage|storage]], and [[Telecommunication|communication]] of [[information]].  It was originally proposed by [[Claude E. Shannon]] in 1948 to find fundamental limits on [[signal processing]] and communication operations such as [[data compression]], in a landmark paper entitled "[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]". Applications of fundamental topics of information theory include [[lossless data compression]] (e.g. [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP files]]), [[lossy data compression]] (e.g. [[MP3]]s and [[JPEG]]s), and [[channel capacity|channel coding]] (e.g. for [[DSL|digital subscriber line (DSL)]]). Its impact has been crucial to the success of the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] missions to deep space, the invention of the [[compact disc]], the feasibility of [[mobile phone]]s, the development of the [[Internet]], the study of [[linguistics]] and of human perception, the understanding of [[black hole]]s, and numerous other fields.

A key measure in information theory is "[[information entropy|entropy]]". Entropy quantifies the amount of uncertainty involved in the value of a [[random variable]] or the outcome of a [[random process]]. For example, identifying the outcome of a fair [[coin flip]] (with two equally likely outcomes) provides less information (lower entropy) than specifying the outcome from a roll of a {{dice}} (with six equally likely outcomes). Some other important measures in information theory are [[mutual information]], [[channel capacity]], [[error exponent]]s, and [[relative entropy]].

The field is at the intersection of [[mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[computer science]], [[physics]], [[neurobiology]], [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]], and [[electrical engineering]]. The theory has also found applications in other areas, including [[statistical inference]], [[natural language processing]], [[cryptography]], [[neurobiology]],&lt;ref name="Spikes"&gt;{{cite book|title=Spikes: Exploring the Neural Code|publisher=The MIT press|year=1997|isbn=978-0262681087|author1=F.

&lt;/ref&gt; Important sub-fields of information theory include [[source coding]], [[channel coding]], [[algorithmic complexity theory]], [[algorithmic information theory]], [[information-theoretic security]], and measures of information.

==Overview==

Information theory studies the transmission, processing, extraction, and utilization of information. Abstractly, information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty. In the case of communication of information over a noisy channel, this abstract concept was made concrete in 1948 by [[Claude Shannon]] in his paper "[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]", in which "information" is thought of as a set of possible messages, where the goal is to send these messages over a noisy channel, and then to have the receiver reconstruct the message with low probability of error, in spite of the channel noise. Shannon's main result, the [[noisy-channel coding theorem]] showed that, in the limit of many channel uses, the rate of information that is asymptotically achievable is equal to the [[channel capacity]], a quantity dependent merely on the statistics of the channel over which the messages are sent.&lt;ref name="Spikes" /&gt;

Information theory is closely associated with a collection of pure and applied disciplines that have been investigated and reduced to engineering practice under a variety of [[Rubric (academic)|rubrics]] throughout the world over the past half century or more: [[adaptive system]]s, [[anticipatory system]]s, [[artificial intelligence]], [[complex system]]s, [[complexity science]], [[cybernetics]], [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]], [[machine learning]], along with [[systems science]]s of many descriptions. Information theory is a broad and deep mathematical theory, with equally broad and deep applications, amongst which is the vital field of [[coding theory]].

Coding theory is concerned with finding explicit methods, called ''codes'', for increasing the efficiency and reducing the error rate of data communication over noisy channels to near the [[channel capacity]]. These codes can be roughly subdivided into [[data compression]] (source coding) and [[error-correction]] (channel coding) techniques. In the latter case, it took many years to find the methods Shannon's work proved were possible. A third class of information theory codes are cryptographic algorithms (both [[code (cryptography)|code]]s and [[cipher]]s). Concepts, methods and results from coding theory and information theory are widely used in [[cryptography]] and [[cryptanalysis]]. ''See the article [[ban (unit)]] for a historical application.''

Information theory is also used in [[information retrieval]], [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence gathering]], [[gambling]], [[statistics]], and even in [[musical composition]].

==Historical background==
{{Main|History of information theory}}

The landmark event that ''established'' the discipline of information theory and brought it to immediate worldwide attention was the publication of [[Claude E. Shannon]]'s classic paper "[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]" in the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]'' in July and October 1948.

Prior to this paper, limited information-theoretic ideas had been developed at [[Bell Labs]], all implicitly assuming events of equal probability.  [[Harry Nyquist]]'s 1924 paper, ''Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed'', contains a theoretical section quantifying "intelligence" and the "line speed" at which it can be transmitted by a communication system, giving the relation {{math|1=''W'' = ''K'' log ''m''}} (recalling [[Boltzmann's constant]]), where ''W'' is the speed of transmission of intelligence, ''m'' is the number of different voltage levels to choose from at each time step, and ''K'' is a constant.  [[Ralph Hartley]]'s 1928 paper, ''Transmission of Information'', uses the word ''information'' as a measurable quantity, reflecting the receiver's ability to distinguish one [[sequence of symbols]] from any other, thus quantifying information as {{math|1=''H'' = log ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''n'' log ''S''}}, where ''S'' was the number of possible symbols, and ''n'' the number of symbols in a transmission. The unit of information was therefore the [[decimal digit]], which has since sometimes been called the [[Hartley (unit)|hartley]] in his honor as a unit or scale or measure of information. [[Alan Turing]] in 1940 used similar ideas as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the German second world war [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Enigma]] ciphers.

Much of the mathematics behind information theory with events of different probabilities were developed for the field of [[thermodynamics]] by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] and [[J. Willard Gibbs]].  Connections between information-theoretic entropy and thermodynamic entropy, including the important contributions by [[Rolf Landauer]] in the 1960s, are explored in ''[[Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory]]''.

In Shannon's revolutionary and groundbreaking paper, the work for which had been substantially completed at Bell Labs by the end of 1944, Shannon for the first time introduced the qualitative and quantitative model of communication as a statistical process underlying information theory, opening with the assertion that
:"The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point, either exactly or approximately, a message selected at another point."

With it came the ideas of
* the [[information entropy]] and [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] of a source, and its relevance through the [[source coding theorem]];
* the [[mutual information]], and the [[channel capacity]] of a noisy channel, including the promise of perfect loss-free communication given by the [[noisy-channel coding theorem]];
* the practical result of the [[Shannon–Hartley law]] for the channel capacity of a [[Gaussian channel]]; as well as
* the [[bit]]—a new way of seeing the most fundamental unit of information.

==Quantities of information==
{{Main|Quantities of information}}

Information theory is based on [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]].  Information theory often concerns itself with measures of information of the distributions associated with random variables. Important quantities of information are [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]], a measure of information in a single [[random variable]], and [[mutual information]], a measure of information in common between two random variables.  The former quantity is a property of the probability distribution of a random variable and gives a limit on the rate at which data generated by independent samples with the given distribution can be reliably [[data compression|compressed]]. The latter is a property of the joint distribution of two random variables, and is the maximum rate of reliable communication across a noisy [[Communication channel|channel]] in the limit of long block lengths, when the channel statistics are determined by the joint distribution.

The choice of logarithmic base in the following formulae determines the [[units of measurement|unit]] of [[information entropy]] that is used.  A common unit of information is the [[bit]], based on the [[binary logarithm]]. Other units include the [[nat (unit)|nat]], which is based on the [[natural logarithm]], and the [[deciban|decimal digit]], which is based on the [[common logarithm]].

In what follows, an expression of the form {{math|''p'' log ''p''}} is considered by convention to be equal to zero whenever {{math|1=''p'' = 0}}.  This is justified because &lt;math&gt;\lim_{p \rightarrow 0+} p \log p = 0&lt;/math&gt; for any logarithmic base.

===Entropy of an information source===
Based on the [[probability mass function]] of each source symbol to be communicated, the Shannon [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] {{math|''H''}}, in units of bits (per symbol), is given by
:&lt;math&gt;H = - \sum_{i} p_i \log_2 (p_i)&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the probability of occurrence of the {{math|''i''}}-th possible value of the source symbol. This equation gives the entropy in the units of "bits" (per symbol) because it uses a logarithm of base 2, and this base-2 measure of entropy has sometimes been called the "[[Shannon (unit)|shannon]]" in his honor. Entropy is also commonly computed using the [[natural logarithm]] (base [[E (mathematical constant)|{{mvar|e}}]], where {{mvar|e}} is [[Euler's number]]), which produces a measurement of entropy in "[[nat (unit)|nats]]" per symbol and sometimes simplifies the analysis by avoiding the need to include extra constants in the formulas. Other bases are also possible, but less commonly used. For example, a logarithm of base {{nowrap|1=2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; = 256}} will produce a measurement in [[byte]]s per symbol, and a logarithm of base 10 will produce a measurement in decimal digits (or hartleys) per symbol.

Intuitively, the entropy {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of a discrete random variable {{math|''X''}} is a measure of the amount of ''uncertainty'' associated with the value of {{math|''X''}} when only its distribution is known.

The entropy of a source that emits a sequence of {{math|''N''}} symbols that are [[independent and identically distributed]] (iid) is {{math|''N&amp;middot;H''}} bits (per message of {{math|''N''}} symbols). If the source data symbols are identically distributed but not independent, the entropy of a message of length {{math|''N''}} will be less than {{math|''N''·''H''}}.

[[File:Binary entropy plot.svg|thumbnail|right|200px|The entropy of a [[Bernoulli trial]] as a function of success probability, often called the ''[[binary entropy function]]'', {{math|''H''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'')}}.  The entropy is maximized at 1 bit per trial when the two possible outcomes are equally probable, as in an unbiased coin toss.]]

If one transmits 1000 bits (0s and 1s), and the value of each of these bits is known to the receiver (has a specific value with certainty) ahead of transmission, it is clear that no information is transmitted.  If, however, each bit is independently equally likely to be 0 or 1, 1000 shannons of information (more often called bits) have been transmitted.  Between these two extremes, information can be quantified as follows. If  	𝕏 is the set of all messages {{math|{{mset|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} that {{math|''X''}} could be, and {{math|''p''(''x'')}} is the probability of some &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb X&lt;/math&gt;, then the entropy, {{math|''H''}}, of {{math|''X''}} is defined:&lt;ref name = Reza&gt;{{cite book | title = An Introduction to Information Theory | author = Fazlollah M. Reza | publisher = Dover Publications, Inc., New York | origyear = 1961| year = 1994 | isbn = 0-486-68210-2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RtzpRAiX6OgC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=intitle:%22An+Introduction+to+Information+Theory%22++%22entropy+of+a+simple+source%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; H(X) = \mathbb{E}_{X} [I(x)] = -\sum_{x \in \mathbb{X}} p(x) \log p(x).&lt;/math&gt;

(Here, {{math|''I''(''x'')}} is the [[self-information]], which is the entropy contribution of an individual message, and {{math|𝔼&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[expected value]].) A property of entropy is that it is maximized when all the messages in the message space are equiprobable {{math|1=''p''(''x'') = 1/''n''}}; i.e., most unpredictable, in which case {{math|1=''H''(''X'') = log ''n''}}.

The special case of information entropy for a random variable with two outcomes is the ''[[binary entropy function]]'', usually taken to the logarithmic base 2, thus having the shannon (Sh) as unit:

:&lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{b}}(p) = - p \log_2 p - (1-p)\log_2 (1-p).&lt;/math&gt;

===Joint entropy===
The ''[[joint entropy]]'' of two discrete random variables {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}} is merely the entropy of their pairing: {{math|(''X'', ''Y'')}}.  This implies that if {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}} are [[statistical independence|independent]], then their joint entropy is the sum of their individual entropies.

For example, if {{math|(''X'', ''Y'')}} represents the position of a [[chess]] piece — {{math|''X''}} the row and {{math|''Y''}} the column, then the joint entropy of the row of the piece and the column of the piece will be the entropy of the position of the piece.

:&lt;math&gt;H(X, Y) = \mathbb{E}_{X,Y} [-\log p(x,y)] = - \sum_{x, y} p(x, y) \log p(x, y) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Despite similar notation, joint entropy should not be confused with ''[[cross entropy]]''.

===Conditional entropy (equivocation)===
The ''[[conditional entropy]]'' or ''conditional uncertainty'' of {{math|''X''}} given random variable {{math|''Y''}} (also called the ''equivocation'' of {{math|''X''}} about {{math|''Y''}}) is the average conditional entropy over {{math|''Y''}}:&lt;ref name=Ash&gt;{{cite book | title = Information Theory | author = Robert B. Ash | publisher = Dover Publications, Inc. | origyear = 1965| year = 1990 | isbn = 0-486-66521-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ngZhvUfF0UIC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=intitle:information+intitle:theory+inauthor:ash+conditional+uncertainty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; H(X|Y) = \mathbb E_Y [H(X|y)] = -\sum_{y \in Y} p(y) \sum_{x \in X} p(x|y) \log p(x|y) = -\sum_{x,y} p(x,y) \log p(x|y).&lt;/math&gt;

Because entropy can be conditioned on a random variable or on that random variable being a certain value, care should be taken not to confuse these two definitions of conditional entropy, the former of which is in more common use.  A basic property of this form of conditional entropy is that:

: &lt;math&gt; H(X|Y) = H(X,Y) - H(Y) .\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Mutual information (transinformation)===
''[[Mutual information]]'' measures the amount of information that can be obtained about one random variable by observing another.  It is important in communication where it can be used to maximize the amount of information shared between sent and received signals.  The mutual information of {{math|''X''}} relative to {{math|''Y''}} is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;I(X;Y) = \mathbb{E}_{X,Y} [SI(x,y)] = \sum_{x,y} p(x,y) \log \frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)\, p(y)}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|SI}} (''S''pecific mutual ''I''nformation) is the [[pointwise mutual information]].

A basic property of the mutual information is that
: &lt;math&gt;I(X;Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y).\,&lt;/math&gt;
That is, knowing ''Y'', we can save an average of {{math|''I''(''X''; ''Y'')}} bits in encoding ''X'' compared to not knowing ''Y''.

Mutual information is [[symmetric function|symmetric]]:
: &lt;math&gt;I(X;Y) = I(Y;X) = H(X) + H(Y) - H(X,Y).\,&lt;/math&gt;

Mutual information can be expressed as the average [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] (information gain) between the [[posterior probability|posterior probability distribution]] of ''X'' given the value of ''Y'' and the [[prior probability|prior distribution]] on ''X'':
: &lt;math&gt;I(X;Y) = \mathbb E_{p(y)} [D_{\mathrm{KL}}( p(X|Y=y) \| p(X) )].&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, this is a measure of how much, on the average, the probability distribution on ''X'' will change if we are given the value of ''Y''.  This is often recalculated as the divergence from the product of the marginal distributions to the actual joint distribution:
: &lt;math&gt;I(X; Y) = D_{\mathrm{KL}}(p(X,Y) \| p(X)p(Y)).&lt;/math&gt;

Mutual information is closely related to the [[likelihood-ratio test|log-likelihood ratio test]] in the context of contingency tables and the [[multinomial distribution]] and to [[Pearson's chi-squared test|Pearson's χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; test]]: mutual information can be considered a statistic for assessing independence between a pair of variables, and has a well-specified asymptotic distribution.

===Kullback–Leibler divergence (information gain)===
The ''[[Kullback–Leibler divergence]]'' (or ''information divergence'', ''information gain'', or ''relative entropy'') is a way of comparing two distributions: a "true" [[probability distribution]] ''p(X)'', and an arbitrary probability distribution ''q(X)''. If we compress data in a manner that assumes ''q(X)'' is the distribution underlying some data, when, in reality, ''p(X)'' is the correct distribution, the Kullback–Leibler divergence is the number of average additional bits per datum necessary for compression.  It is thus defined

:&lt;math&gt;D_{\mathrm{KL}}(p(X) \| q(X)) = \sum_{x \in X} -p(x) \log {q(x)} \, - \, \sum_{x \in X} -p(x) \log {p(x)} = \sum_{x \in X} p(x) \log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Although it is sometimes used as a 'distance metric', KL divergence is not a true [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] since it is not symmetric and does not satisfy the [[triangle inequality]] (making it a semi-quasimetric).

Another interpretation of the KL divergence is the "unnecessary surprise" introduced by a prior from the truth: suppose a number ''X'' is about to be drawn randomly from a discrete set with probability distribution ''p(x)''.  If Alice knows the true distribution ''p(x)'', while Bob believes (has a [[prior probability|prior]]) that the distribution is ''q(x)'', then Bob will be more [[Self-information|surprised]] than Alice, on average, upon seeing the value of ''X''.  The KL divergence is the (objective) expected value of Bob's (subjective) [[surprisal]] minus Alice's surprisal, measured in bits if the ''log'' is in base 2.  In this way, the extent to which Bob's prior is "wrong" can be quantified in terms of how "unnecessarily surprised" it is expected to make him.

===Other quantities===
Other important information theoretic quantities include [[Rényi entropy]] (a generalization of entropy), [[differential entropy]] (a generalization of quantities of information to continuous distributions), and the [[conditional mutual information]].

==Coding theory==
{{Main|Coding theory}}

[[File:CDSCRATCHES.jpg|thumb|right|A picture showing scratches on the readable surface of a CD-R.  Music and data CDs are coded using error correcting codes and thus can still be read even if they have minor scratches using [[error detection and correction]].]]

[[Coding theory]] is one of the most important and direct applications of information theory. It can be subdivided into [[data compression|source coding]] theory and [[error correction|channel coding]] theory. Using a statistical description for data, information theory quantifies the number of bits needed to describe the data, which is the information entropy of the source.

* Data compression (source coding): There are two formulations for the compression problem:
*[[lossless data compression]]: the data must be reconstructed exactly;
*[[lossy data compression]]: allocates bits needed to reconstruct the data, within a specified fidelity level measured by a distortion function. This subset of information theory is called ''[[rate–distortion theory]]''.
* Error-correcting codes (channel coding): While data compression removes as much [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] as possible, an error correcting code adds just the right kind of redundancy (i.e., [[error correction]]) needed to transmit the data efficiently and faithfully across a noisy channel.

This division of coding theory into compression and transmission is justified by the information transmission theorems, or source–channel separation theorems that justify the use of bits as the universal currency for information in many contexts. However, these theorems only hold in the situation where one transmitting user wishes to communicate to one receiving user. In scenarios with more than one transmitter (the multiple-access channel), more than one receiver (the [[broadcast channel]]) or intermediary "helpers" (the [[relay channel]]), or more general [[computer network|networks]], compression followed by transmission may no longer be optimal. [[Network information theory]] refers to these multi-agent communication models.

===Source theory===
Any process that generates successive messages can be considered a ''[[Communication source|source]]'' of information.  A memoryless source is one in which each message is an [[Independent identically distributed random variables|independent identically distributed random variable]], whereas the properties of [[ergodic theory|ergodicity]] and [[stationary process|stationarity]] impose less restrictive constraints.  All such sources are [[stochastic process|stochastic]].  These terms are well studied in their own right outside information theory.

====Rate====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Channel capacity]] --&gt;
Information ''[[Entropy rate|rate]]'' is the average entropy per symbol.  For memoryless sources, this is merely the entropy of each symbol, while, in the case of a stationary stochastic process, it is

:&lt;math&gt;r = \lim_{n \to \infty} H(X_n|X_{n-1},X_{n-2},X_{n-3}, \ldots);&lt;/math&gt;

that is, the conditional entropy of a symbol given all the previous symbols generated.  For the more general case of a process that is not necessarily stationary, the ''average rate'' is

:&lt;math&gt;r = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} H(X_1, X_2, \dots X_n);&lt;/math&gt;

that is, the limit of the joint entropy per symbol.  For stationary sources, these two expressions give the same result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Digital Compression for Multimedia: Principles and Standards | author = Jerry D. Gibson | publisher = Morgan Kaufmann | year = 1998 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aqQ2Ry6spu0C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=entropy-rate+conditional#PPA57,M1 | isbn = 1-55860-369-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common in information theory to speak of the "rate" or "entropy" of a language.  This is appropriate, for example, when the source of information is English prose.  The rate of a source of information is related to its [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] and how well it can be [[data compression|compressed]], the subject of ''source coding''.

===Channel capacity===
{{Main|Channel capacity}}

Communications over a channel—such as an [[ethernet]] [[Electrical cable|cable]]—is the primary motivation of information theory.  As anyone who's ever used a telephone (mobile or landline) knows, however, such channels often fail to produce exact reconstruction of a signal; noise, periods of silence, and other forms of signal corruption often degrade quality.

Consider the communications process over a discrete channel. A simple model of the process is shown below:


[[File:Channel model.svg|center|800px|Channel model]]


Here ''X'' represents the space of messages transmitted, and ''Y'' the space of messages received during a unit time over our channel. Let {{math|''p''(''y''{{pipe}}''x'')}} be the [[conditional probability]] distribution function of ''Y'' given ''X''. We will consider {{math|''p''(''y''{{pipe}}''x'')}} to be an inherent fixed property of our communications channel (representing the nature of the ''[[Signal noise|noise]]'' of our channel). Then the joint distribution of ''X'' and ''Y'' is completely determined by our channel and by our choice of {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, the marginal distribution of messages we choose to send over the channel. Under these constraints, we would like to maximize the rate of information, or the ''[[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]]'', we can communicate over the channel. The appropriate measure for this is the [[mutual information]], and this maximum mutual information is called the ''[[channel capacity]]'' and is given by:
:&lt;math&gt; C = \max_{f} I(X;Y).\! &lt;/math&gt;
This capacity has the following property related to communicating at information rate ''R'' (where ''R'' is usually bits per symbol).  For any information rate ''R &lt; C'' and coding error ε &gt; 0, for large enough ''N'', there exists a code of length ''N'' and rate ≥ R and a decoding algorithm, such that the maximal probability of block error is ≤ ε; that is, it is always possible to transmit with arbitrarily small block error.  In addition, for any rate ''R &amp;gt; C'', it is impossible to transmit with arbitrarily small block error.

''[[Channel code|Channel coding]]'' is concerned with finding such nearly optimal [[error detection and correction|codes]] that can be used to transmit data over a noisy channel with a small coding error at a rate near the channel capacity.

====Capacity of particular channel models====
* A continuous-time analog communications channel subject to [[Gaussian noise]] — see [[Shannon–Hartley theorem]].
* A [[binary symmetric channel]] (BSC) with crossover probability ''p'' is a binary input, binary output channel that flips the input bit with probability ''p''. The BSC has a capacity of {{math|1 &amp;minus; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'')}} bits per channel use, where {{math|''H''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[binary entropy function]] to the base-2 logarithm:

::[[File:Binary symmetric channel.svg]]

* A [[binary erasure channel]] (BEC) with erasure probability ''p'' is a binary input, ternary output channel. The possible channel outputs are 0, 1, and a third symbol 'e' called an erasure. The erasure represents complete loss of information about an input bit. The capacity of the BEC is {{nowrap|1 &amp;minus; ''p''}} bits per channel use.

==Applications to other fields==

===Intelligence uses and secrecy applications===
Information theoretic concepts apply to [[cryptography]] and [[cryptanalysis]].  [[Turing]]'s information unit, the [[Ban (unit)|ban]], was used in the [[Ultra]] project, breaking the German [[Enigma machine]] code and hastening the [[Victory in Europe Day|end of World War II in Europe]].  Shannon himself defined an important concept now called the [[unicity distance]]. Based on the [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] of the [[plaintext]], it attempts to give a minimum amount of [[ciphertext]] necessary to ensure unique decipherability.

Information theory leads us to believe it is much more difficult to keep secrets than it might first appear.  A [[brute force attack]] can break systems based on [[public-key cryptography|asymmetric key algorithms]] or on most commonly used methods of [[symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric key algorithms]] (sometimes called secret key algorithms), such as [[block cipher]]s.  The security of all such methods currently comes from the assumption that no known attack can break them in a practical amount of time.

[[Information theoretic security]] refers to methods such as the [[one-time pad]] that are not vulnerable to such brute force attacks.  In such cases, the positive conditional [[mutual information]] between the [[plaintext]] and [[ciphertext]] (conditioned on the [[key (cryptography)|key]]) can ensure proper transmission, while the unconditional mutual information between the plaintext and ciphertext remains zero, resulting in absolutely secure communications.  In other words, an eavesdropper would not be able to improve his or her guess of the plaintext by gaining knowledge of the ciphertext but not of the key. However, as in any other cryptographic system, care must be used to correctly apply even information-theoretically secure methods; the [[Venona project]] was able to crack the one-time pads of the Soviet Union due to their improper reuse of key material.

===Pseudorandom number generation===
[[Pseudorandom number generator]]s are widely available in computer language libraries and application programs. They are, almost universally, unsuited to cryptographic use as they do not evade the deterministic nature of modern computer equipment and software. A class of improved random number generators is termed [[cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator]]s, but even they require [[random seed]]s external to the software to work as intended. These can be obtained via [[Extractor (mathematics)|extractors]], if done carefully. The measure of  sufficient randomness in extractors is [[min-entropy]], a value related to Shannon entropy through [[Rényi entropy]]; Rényi entropy is also used in evaluating randomness in cryptographic systems.  Although related, the distinctions among these measures mean that a [[random variable]] with high Shannon entropy is not necessarily satisfactory for use in an extractor and so for cryptography uses.

===Seismic exploration===
One early commercial application of information theory was in the field of seismic oil exploration. Work in this field made it possible to strip off and separate the unwanted noise from the desired seismic signal. Information theory and [[digital signal processing]] offer a major improvement of resolution and image clarity over previous analog methods.&lt;ref&gt;The Corporation and Innovation, Haggerty, Patrick, Strategic Management Journal, Vol. 2, 97-118 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

Concepts from information theory such as redundancy and code control have been used by semioticians such as [[Umberto Eco]] and [[:it:Ferruccio Rossi-Landi|Ferruccio Rossi-Landi]] to explain ideology as a form of message transmission whereby a dominant social class emits its message by using signs that exhibit a high degree of redundancy such that only one message is decoded among a selection of competing ones.&lt;ref&gt;Nöth, Winfried (1981). "Semiotics of ideology". ''Semiotica'', Issue 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miscellaneous applications===
Information theory also has applications in [[Gambling and information theory|gambling and investing]], [[black hole information paradox|black holes]], and [[bioinformatics]].

'''''Langgan''''' 琅玕 is the ancient [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name of a [[gemstone]] which remains an enigma in the [[history of mineralogy]]; it has been identified, variously, as blue-green [[malachite]], [[blue coral]], [[white coral]], whitish [[chalcedony]], red [[spinel]], and red [[jade]]. It is also the name of a mythological ''langgan'' [[tree of life|tree of immortality]] found in the western paradise of [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Kunlun Mountain]], and the name of the classic ''[[waidan]]'' alchemical [[elixir of immortality]] ''langgan huadan'' 琅玕華丹 "Elixir Efflorescence of Langgan".

==Word==
The [[Chinese characters]] 琅 and 玕 used to write the gemstone name ''lánggān'' are classified as [[Chinese character classification#Phono-semantic compound characters|radical-phonetic characters]] that combine the semantically significant "[[radical 96|jade radical]]" 玉 or 王 (commonly used to write names of jades or gemstones) and phonetic elements hinting at pronunciation. ''Láng'' 琅 combines the "jade radical" with ''liáng'' 良 "good; fine" (interpreted to denote "fine jade") and ''gān'' 玕 combines it with the phonetic ''gān'' 干 "stem; trunk". The Chinese word ''yù'' [[wikt:玉|玉]] is usually translated as "jade" but in some contexts translates as "fine ornamental stone; gemstone; precious stone", and can refer to a variety of rocks that carve and polish well, including [[jadeite]], [[nephrite]], [[agalmatolite]], [[bowenite]], and [[serpentine subgroup|serpentine]] (Desautels 1977: 81).

Modern [[written Chinese]] ''láng'' 琅 and ''gān'' 玕 have [[variant Chinese character]]s. ''Láng'' 琅 is occasionally transcribed as ''láng'' 瑯 (with ''láng'' 郞 "gentleman") or ''lán'' 瓓 (''lán'' 闌 "railing"); and ''gān'' 玕 is rarely written as ''gān'' 玵 (with a ''gān'' 甘 "sweet" phonetic). ''[[Chinese characters|Guwen]]''{{dn|date=August 2017}} "ancient script" variants were ''láng'' 𤨜 or 𤦴 and ''gān'' 𤥚.

[[Berthold Laufer]] proposed that ''langgan'' was an [[onomatopoetic]] word "descriptive of the sound yielded by the sonorous stone when struck" (1915: 206). ''Lang'' occurs in several imitative words meaning "tinkling of jade pendants/ornaments": ''lángláng'' 琅琅 "tinkling/jingling sound", ''língláng'' 玲琅 "tinkling/jangling of jade", ''línláng'' 琳琅 "beautiful jade; sound of jade", and ''lángdāng'' 琅璫 "tinkling sound". Laufer further suggests this etymology would explain the transference of the name ''langgan'' from a stone to a coral; Du Wan's 杜綰 c. 1125 ''Yunlin shipu'' 雲林石譜 "Stone Catalogue of the Cloudy Forest" (below) expressly states that the coral ''langgan'' "when struck develops resonant properties".

==Classical descriptions==
The name ''langgan'' has undergone remarkable [[semantic change]]. The first references to ''langgan'' are found in [[Chinese classics]] from the [[Warring States period]] (475-221 BCE) and [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE-220 CE), which describe it as a valuable gemstone and mineral drug, as well as the mythological fruit of the ''langgan'' tree of immortality on Kunlun Mountain. Texts from the turbulent [[Six Dynasties]] period (220-589) and [[Sui dynasty]] (581-618) used ''langgan'' gemstone as a literary metaphor, and an ingredient in alchemical elixirs of immortality, many of which were [[Chinese alchemical elixir poisoning|poisonous]]. During the [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907), ''langgan'' was reinterpreted as a type of coral.

Several early texts (including the ''Shujing'', ''Guanzi'', and ''Erya'' below) recorded ''langgan'' in context with the obscure gemstone(s) ''qiúlín'' 璆琳. In [[Classical Chinese]] syntax, 璆琳 can be parsed as two ''qiu'' and ''lin'' types of jade or as one ''qiulin'' type. A recent dictionary of Classical Chinese says ''qiú'' 璆 "fine jade, jade lithophone" is cognate with ''qiú'' 球 "precious gem, fine jade; jade chime or [[lithophone]]" (which later came to mean "ball; sphere"), and ''lín'' 琳 "blue-gem; sapphire" (Kroll 2017: 374, 272).

In what may be the earliest record (Schafer 1978: 29), the c. 5th-3rd centuries BCE ''[[Yu Gong]]'' "Tribute of [[Yu the Great]]" chapter of the ''[[Shujing]]'' "Classic of Documents" says the [[Imperial Chinese tributary system|tributary]] products from [[Yong Province]] (located in the [[Wei River]] plain, one of the ancient [[Nine Provinces (China)|Nine Provinces]]) included ''qiulin'' and ''langgan'' jade-like gemstones: "Its articles of tribute were the k'ew and lin ''gem-stones'', and the lang-kan ''precious stones''" (tr. Legge 1865 3: 127). Legge quotes [[Kong Anguo]]'s commentary that ''langgan'' is "a stone, but like a pearl", and suggests it was possibly [[lazulite]] or [[lapis lazuli]], which Laufer calls "purely conjectural" (1915: 205).

The c. 4th-3rd centuries BCE ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'' encyclopedic text, named for and attributed to the 7th century BCE philosopher [[Guan Zhong]], who served as Prime Minister to [[Duke Huan of Qi]] (r. 685-643 BCE), uses ''[[Bi (jade)|bi]]'' 璧 "a flat jade disc with a hole in the center", ''qiulin'' 璆琳 "lapis lazuli", and ''langgan'' 琅玕 as examples of how establishing diverse local commodities as [[fiat currencies]] will encourage foreign economic cooperation. When Duke Huan asks Guanzi about how to politically control the "[[Four Barbarians|Four ''Yi'']]" (meaning "all foreigners" on China's borders), he replies: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the Yuzhi [i.e., Yuezhi/Kushans in Central Asia] have not paid court, I request our use of white jade discs [白璧] as money. Since those in the Kunlun desert (modern-day Xinjiang and Tibet) have not paid court, I request our use of lapis lazuli and ''langgan'' gems as money. … Since a white jade held tight unseen against one's chest or under one's armpit will be used as a thousand pieces of gold, we can obtain the Yuezhi eight thousand ''li'' away and make them pay court. Since a lapis lazuli and ''langgan'' gem (fashioned in) a hair clasp and earring will be used as a thousand gold pieces, we can obtain [i.e., defeat] [the inhabitants] of the Kunlun deserts eight thousand ''li'' away and make them pay court. Therefore if resources are not commandeered, economies will not connect, those distant from each other will have nothing to use for their common interest and the four ''yi'' will not be obtained and come to court. (tr. (Lavan et al. 2016: 149; one ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' was approximately one-third mile) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Xun Kuang]]'s 3rd century BCE Confucian classic ''[[Xunzi (book)|Xunzi]]'' has a context criticizing elaborate burials that uses ''dan'gan'' 丹矸 (with ''dān'' 丹 "cinnabar" and ''gān'' 矸 "waste rock", with the "[[radical 112|stone radical]]" and same ''gān'' 干 phonetic) and ''langgan'' 琅玕. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;In these ancient times, the body was covered with pearls and jades, the inner coffin was filled with beautifully ornamented embroideries, and he outer coffin was filled with yellow gold and decorated with cinnabar [丹矸] with added layers of laminar verdite. [In the outer tomb chamber were] rhinoceros and elephant ivory fashioned into trees, with precious rubies [琅玕], magnetite lodestones, and flowering aconite for their fruit." (18.7, tr. Knoblock 1994: 44) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
John Knoblock translates ''langgan'' as "rubies", noting perhaps the genuine ruby or balas [[spinel]], were connected with the cult of immortality, and cites the ''Shanhaijing'' saying they grow on Mount Kunlun's Fuchang trees, and the ''Zhen'gao'' saying that adepts swallow "ruby blossoms" to feign death and become transcendents (1994: 30).

Early Chinese dictionaries define ''langgan''. The c. 4th-3rd century BCE ''[[Erya]]'' geography section (9 ''Shidi'' 釋地) lists valuable products from the various regions of ancient China: "The beautiful things of the northwest are the ''qiulin'' [璆琳] and ''langgan'' gemstones from the wastelands [虛] of Kunlun Mountain". The 121 CE ''[[Shuowen jiezi]]'' (Jade Radical section 玉部) has two consecutive definitions for ''lang'' 琅 and ''gan'' 玕. ''Lang'' is [used in] ''langgan'', which "resembles a pearl [似珠者]", ''Gan'' is [used in] ''langgan'', paraphrasing the ''Yu Gong'', "Yong Province [using the ancient ''yōng'' 雝 character for ''yōng'' 雍] [produces] ''qiulin'' and ''langgan'' [gems] [球琳琅玕]". 

Three sections about [[Western China|western Chinese]] mountains in the c. 4th-2nd centuries BCE ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' "Classic of Mountains and Seas" record early geographic legends associating ''langgan'' with [[Xi Wang Mu]] "Queen Mother of the West" who lives on [[Jade Mountain (mythology)|Jade Mountain]] in the mythological [[axis mundi]] [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Kunlun Mountain]] paradise. Two mention ''langgan'' gems and one mentions ''langganshu'' 琅玕樹 trees. The ''Shanhaijing'' translator Anne Birrell exemplifies the difficulties of translating the word ''langgan'' in three ways: "pearl-like gems", "red jade", and "precious gem [tree]".

First, the "Classic of the Mountains: West" section says Huaijiang 槐江 (lit. "[[Styphnolobium japonicum|pagoda-tree]] river") Mountain, located 400 ''li'' northeast of Kunlun Mountain, has abundant ''langgan'' and other valuable minerals. "On the summit of Mount Carobriver are quantities of green male-yellow [多青雄黃]], precious pearl-like gems [藏琅玕], and yellow gold and jade. Granular cinnabar is abundant on its south face and there are quantities of speckled yellow gold and silver on its north face." (2, tr. Birrell 2000: 22). "Male-yellow" overliterally translates ''xiónghuáng'' 雄黃 "[[realgar]]; red [[orpiment]]"—Compare Richard Strassberg's translation, "On the mountain’s heights is much green realgar, the finest quality of Langgan-Stone, yellow gold, and jade. On its southern slope are many grains of cinnabar, while on its northern slope are much glittering yellow gold and silver." (2002: 106). [[Guo Pu]]'s 4th century CE ''Shanhaijing'' commentary says ''langgan'' ''shi'' 石 "stone/gem" (cf. ''zi'' 子 "seeds" in the third section) resembles a pearl, and ''cáng'' 藏 "store; conceal, hide" means ''yǐn'' 隱 "conceal; hide". However, Hao Yixing's 郝懿行 1822 commentary says ''cáng'' 藏 was originally written ''zāng'' 臧 "good", that is, Huaijiang Mountain has the "best" quality ''langgan''.

Second, the "Classic of the Great Wilderness: West" section records that on [Xi] Wang Mu 王母 "Queen Mother [of the West]" Mountain: "Here are the sweet-bloom tree, sweet quince, white weeping willow, the look-flesh creature, the triply-grey horse, precious jade [琁瑰], dark green jade gemstone [瑤碧], the white tree, red jade [琅玕], white cinnabar, green cinnabar, and quantities of silver and iron." (16, tr. Birrell 2000: 174)

Third, the "Classic of Regions Within the Seas: West" section refers to a mythical [[tricephalic]] creature dwelling in a ''fuchangshu'' 服常樹 (lit. "serve constant tree") who guards a ''langganshu'' tree south of Kunlun: "The wears-ever fruit tree—on its crown there is a three-headed person who is in charge of the precious gem tree [琅玕樹]." (11, tr. Birrell 2000: 141). Interpreters disagree whether the ''langgan'' tree grows alongside the ''fuchang'' tree or grows on it  (Knoblock 1994: 30). Guo Pu's commentary admits unfamiliarity with the ''fuchang'' 服常 tree; [[Wu Renchen]]'s 17th-century commentary notes the similarity with the ''shachang'' 沙棠 "sand-plum tree" that the ''Huainanzi'' lists with ''langgan'', but doubts they are the same. Guo's commentary says ''langgan'' ''zi'' 子 "seeds" (Birrell 2000: 249) or "fruits" (Knoblock 1994: 30) resemble pearls (cf. the ''Shuowen'' definition) and quotes the ''Erya'' that it is found on Kunlun Mountain.

The c. 120 BCE ''[[Huainanzi]]'' "Terrestrial Forms" chapter (4 墬形) describes ''langgan'' trees and ''langgan'' jade both found on Mt. Kunlun. The first context describes how [[Yu the Great]] controlled the [[Great Flood (China)#Great Yu controls the flood|Great Flood]] and "excavated the wastelands of Kunlun [昆侖之球] to make level ground". "Atop the heights of Kunlun are treelike cereal plants [木禾] thirty-five feet tall. Growing to the west of these are pearl trees [珠樹], jade trees [玉樹], carnelian trees [琁樹], and no-death trees [不死樹]. To the east are found sand-plum trees [沙棠] and malachite trees [琅玕]. To the south are crimson trees [絳樹]. To the north are ''bi'' jade trees [碧樹] and ''yao'' jade trees [瑤樹]." (4.3, tr. Major et al. 2010: 159; translating with Schafer's "malachite" instead of "coral"). The second context paraphrases the ''Erya'' definition (above) of ''langgan'': "The beautiful things of the northwest are the ''qiu'', ''lin'', and ''langgan'' jades [球琳琅玕] of the Kunlun Mountains [昆侖]" (4.7, tr. Major et al. 2010: 159; noting that ''qiu'', ''lin'', and ''langgan'' are "types of jade, mostly not identifiable with certainty").

==Medicine==
[[File:Malachite bead necklace.jpg|thumb|Malachite bead necklace]]
Several early classics of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] mention ''langgan''.

The c. 1st century BCE ''[[Huangdi Neijing]]'''s ''Suwen'' 素問 "Basic Questions" section uses ''langgan'' beads to describe a healthy pulse. "When man is serene and healthy the pulse of the heart flows and connects, just as pearls are joined together or like a string of red jade [如循琅玕]—then one can speak of a healthy heart" (tr. Veith 1949: 173).

The c. 2nd century CE ''[[Nan Jing (Chinese medicine)|Nan Jing]]'' explains this ''langgan'' bead simile: "[If the ''qi'' in] the vessels comes tied together like rings, or as if they were following [in their movement a chain of] ''lang gan'' stones [如循琅玕], that implies a normal state." Commentaries elaborate that ''langgan'' stones "resemble pearls" and their movement is like a "string of jade- or pearl-like beads" (tr. Unschuld 2016: 179). 

The c. 3rd century CE ''[[Shennong Bencaojing]]'' lists ''qīng lánggān'' 青琅玕 "blue-green ''langgan''" or ''shízhū'' 石珠 (lit. "rock pearl") as a mineral drug used to treat ailments such as itchy skin, carbuncle, and [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]]. This is one of the rare early references to ''langgan'' that treats it as a real substance, while many others make it a feature of the divine world (Schafer 1978: 27).

==Alchemy==
The ''langgan huadan'' 琅玕華丹 "Elixir Efflorescence of Langgan" name of the ''[[waidan]]'' "external alchemy" [[elixir of immortality]] is the best-known usage of the word ''langgan'' (Pregadio 2008: 605). Some other translations are "Elixir of Langgan Efflorescence" (Strickmann 1979: 135, Bokenkamp 1997: 190),"Lang-Kan (Gem) Radiant Elixir" (Needham et al. 1980: 217), and "Elixir Flower of Langgan" (Pregadio 2006: 7). 

The earliest method of compounding the elixir is found in the ''Taiwei lingshu ziwen langgan huadan shenzhen shangjing'' 太微靈書紫文琅玕華丹神真上經 "Supreme Scripture on the Elixir of Langgan Efflorescence, from the Purple Texts Inscribed by the Spirits of Grand Tenuity" (translated by Bokenkamp 1997: 331-339). This text was originally part of the Daoist [[Shangqing School]] scriptural corpus supposedly revealed to [[Yang Xi]] (330-c. 386 CE) between 364 and 370 (Komjathy 2004: 23-24).

The Purple Texts alchemical recipe for preparing Elixir of ''Langgan'' Efflorescence involves nine steps in four stages carried out over thirteen years. The first stage produces the ''Langgan'' Efflorescence proper, which when ingested is said to make "one's complexion similar to gold and jade and enables one to summon divine beings". The next three stages further refine and transform the ''Langgan'' Elixir, repeatedly plant it in the earth, and eventually generate a tree whose fruits confer immortality when eaten, just like those of the legendary ''langgan'' tree on Mount Kunlun (Pregadio 2008: 605). Upon completing any of the nine successive steps in producing the elixir, the alchemist (or adept in the ''[[neidan]]'' interpretation) can choose to either ingest the products and obtain immortality by ascending into the realm of Shangqing heavens or may continue on to the next step with the promise of ever-increasing rewards (Bokenkamp 1997: 290).

The first stage has one complex ''waidan'' step of compounding the primary ''Langgan'' Efflorescence. After performing ritual ''zhāi'' 齋 "purification practices" for 40 days, the adept spends 60 days to acquire and prepared the elixir's fourteen ingredients, place them in a crucible, add mercury on top of them, [[Lute (material)|lute]] the crucible with several layers of mud, and after sacrificing wine to the divinities, heating the crucible for 100 days. The elixir's fourteen [[reagents]], given in exalted [[code names]] such as "White-Silk Flying Dragon" for quartz, are: [[cinnabar]], [[realgar]], [[milky quartz]], [[azurite]], [[amethyst]], [[graphite]], [[saltpeter]], [[sulfur]], [[asbestos]], [[mica]], [[iron pyrite]], [[lead carbonate]], Turkestan salt (desert lake precipitates containing [[gypsum]], [[anhydrite]], and [[halite]]), and [[orpiment]] (Bokenkamp 1997: 334). Based upon these ingredients, Schafer says the end product was probably bluish [[flint glass]] with a high lead content (1978: 37). The alchemist can either leave the crucible closed and proceed to the next stage or break it open and consume the ''langan'' elixir that is said to yield marvelous results. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The efflorescence should have thirty-seven hues. It is a volatile liquid both brilliant and mottled, a purple aurora darkly flashing. This is called the Elixir of ''Langgan'' Efflorescence. If, just at dawn on the first day of the eleventh, fourth, or eighth month, you bow repeatedly and ingest one ounce of this elixir with the water from an east-flowing stream, seven-colored pneumas will rise from your head and your face will have the jadelike glow of metallic efflorescence. If you hold your breath, immediately a chariot from the eight shrouded extents of the universe will arrive. When you spit on the ground, your saliva will transform into a flying dragon. When you whistle to your left, divine Transcendents will pay court to you; when you point to the right, the vapors of Three Elementals will join with the wind. Then, in thousands of conveyances, with myriad outriders, you will fly up to Upper Clarity. (tr. Bokenkamp 1997: 336) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second stage comprises two iterative 100-day ''waidan'' alchemical steps transforming the elixir. Firing the unopened stage one crucible of ''Langgan'' Efflorescence for another 100 days will produce the Lunar Efflorescence of the Yellow Solution [黄水月華], which when consumed will make you "change forms ten thousand times, your eyes will become luminous moons, and you will float above in the Grand Void to fly off to the Palace of Purple Tenuity". The next step of firing the closed crucible for an additional one 100 days will produce three giant pearls called the Jade Essence of the Swirling Solution [徊水玉精]. Ingesting one alchemical pearl supposedly causes you to immediately give off liquid and fire, form gems with your breath, and your body "will become a sun, and the Thearchs of Heaven will descend to greet you. You will rise as a glowing orb to Upper Clarity." (tr. Bokenkamp 1997: 336-337).

The third stage involves four 3-year steps utilizing the elixirs produced in the first two stages to create fantastic seeds that are replanted and grow into increasingly perfected "spirit trees" with fruits of immortality. This stage falls between conventional ''waidan'' alchemy and the horticultural art of growing marvelous ''zhi'' 芝 "plants of longevity; fungi" such as the [[lingzhi mushroom]] (Needham et al. 1980: 217). Initially, the adept mixes the Elixir of ''Langgan'' Efflorescence with Jade Essence of the Swirling Solution, transforming the ''jīng'' 精 "essence; sperm; seed" in the latter name into an actual seed that is planted in an irrigated field. After three years it grows into the Tree of Ringed Adamant [環剛樹子] or Hidden Polypore of the Grand Bourne [太極隱芝], which has a ring-shaped fruit like a red jujube. Next, the adept plants one of the ringed fruits and waters it with the Yellow Solution, and after three years a plant called the called the Phoenix-Brain Polypore [''fengnao zhi'' 鳳腦芝] will grow like a calabash, with pits like five-colored peaches. Then, a phoenix-brain fruit is planted and watered with Yellow Solution, which after three years will grow into a red tree, like a pine, five or six feet in height, with a jade-white fruit like a pear [赤樹白子]. Lastly, the adept plants the seed of the red tree, waters it with Swirling Solution, waits another three years for the growth of a vermilion tree like a plum, six or seven feet in height, with a halycon-blue fruit like the jujube [絳樹青實]. Upon eating this fruit, the adept will ascend to the heaven of Purple Tenuity. (tr. Bokenkamp 1997: 337-338).

The fourth stage involves two comparatively quicker ''waidan'' steps. The adept repeatedly boils equal parts of the Yellow Solution and the Swirling Solution, and transforms them into the Blue Florets of Aqueous Yang [水陽青映]. If you drink this at dawn, your body will issue a blue and gemmy light, your mouth will spew forth purple vapors, and you will rise above to Upper Clarity [''Shangqing'']. But before departing earth, the adept's last step is to mix the remaining Elixir of Langan Efflorescence with liquified lead and mercury to produce 50-pound ingots of alchemical silver and purple gold, make incantations to the water spirits, and throw both oblatory ingots into a stream (tr. Bokenkamp 1997: 338-339).

Despite the carefully detailed Purple Texts' ''waidan'' recipe for preparing ''langgan'' elixirs, scholars have doubted that the authors actually meant for it to be produced and consumed. Some interpret the impractical 13-year elixir recipe as symbolic instructions for what later came to be known as ''neidan'' meditative visualization, and is more a "product of religious imagination", drawing on the respected metaphors of alchemical language, than a laboratory manual drawing on the metaphors of meditation (Bokenkamp 1997: 295). Others believe this "extravagantly impractical recipe" is an attempt to assimilate into conventional ''waidan'' alchemy the ancient legends about ''langgan'' gems that grow on trees in the paradise of KunIun (Needham et al. 1980: 217).

The Shangqing Daoist patriarch [[Tao Hongjing]] compiled and edited both the c. 370 ''Taiwei lingshu ziwen langgan huadan shenzhen shangjing'' and the c. 499 ''[[Zhen'gao]]'' 真誥 "Declarations of the Perfected" that also mentions ''langan'' elixirs in some of the same terminology. One context records that the early Daoist masters Yan Menzi 衍門子, Gao Qiuzi 高丘子, and Master Hongyai 洪涯先生 swallowed ''langgan hua'' 琅玕華 "langgan blossoms" to feign death and become ''[[xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' transcendents and enter the "dark region" beyond the world. Needham and Lu proposed this ''langgan hua'' probably refers to a red or green poisonous mushroom (1974: 296), and Knoblock surmised that these "ruby blossoms" were a species of hallucinogenic mushroom connected with the elixir of immortality (1994: 30). Another ''Zhen'gao'' context describes how in the Shangqing [[end time|latter days]] before the apocalypse (predicted to be in 507) people will practice alchemy to create immortality drugs, including the ''Langgan'' Elixir that "will flow and flower in thick billows" and Cloud ''Langgan''. If the adept takes one spatula full of elixir, "their spiritual feathers will spread forth like pinions. Then will they (be able to) peruse the pattern figured on the Vault of Space, and glow forth in the Chamber of Primal Commencement" (tr. Needham et al. 1980: 216).

Several ingredients in the Elixir of ''Langgan'' Efflorescence are [[toxic heavy metal]]s including mercury, lead, and arsenic, and [[Chinese alchemical elixir poisoning|alchemical elixir poisoning]] was common knowledge in China. Academics have puzzled over why Daoist adepts would knowingly consume a compound of mineral poisons, and Michel Strickmann, a scholar of Daoist and Buddhist studies, proposes that ''langgan'' elixir was believed to be an agent of self-[[Enlightenment (spiritual)|liberation]] that guaranteed immortality to the faithful through a kind of [[ritual suicide]]. Since early Daoist literature thoroughly, "even rapturously", described the deadly toxic qualities of many elixirs, Strickmann concluded that scholars need to reexamine the Western stereotype of "accidental elixir poisoning" that supposedly applied to "misguided alchemists and their unwitting imperial patrons" (1979:191).

==Literature==
Chinese authors extended the classical descriptions of ''langgan'' meaning "a highly valued gem from western China; a mythical tree of immortality on Kunlun Mountain" into a [[Chinese literature|literary]] and [[Chinese poetry|poetic]] metaphor for the exotic beauties of an idealized natural world. 

[[File:Phyllostachys bambusoides f castillonis3.jpg|thumb|[[Spotted bamboo]] ''Phyllostachys bambusoides'']]
Several early writers described ''langgan'' jewelry, both real and fictional. The 2nd-century scholar and scientist [[Zhang Heng]] described a party for the Han nobility at which guests were delighted with the presentation of bowls overflowing with ''zhēnxiū'' 珍羞 "delicacies; exotic foods" including ''langgan'' fruits of paradise. The 3rd-century poet [[Cao Zhi]] described hanging "halcyon blue" (''cuì'' 翠) ''langgan'' from the waist of his "beautiful person", and the 5th-century poet [[Jiang Yan]] adorned a goddess with gems of ''langgan''. Some other authors reinforced use of its name to refer to divine fruits on heavenly trees. [[Ruan Ji]], one of the [[Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove]], wrote a 3rd-century poem titled "Dining at Sunrise on Langgan Fruit". The 8th-century poet [[Li Bai]] wrote about a famished but proud ''[[fenghuang]]'' that would not deign to peck at bird food, but like a Daoist adept, would scorn all but a diet of ''langgan''. This represents a literary transition from glittering fruit of distant Kunlun, to aristocratic fare in golden bowls, eventually to an elixir of immortality (Schafer 1978: 30).

A further extension of the ''langgan'' metaphor was to describe natural images of beautiful crystals and lush vegetation. For example, [[Ban Zhao]]'s poem on "The Arrival of Winter" says, "The long [Yellow River] forms (crystalline) ''langgan'' [written ''langan'' 瓓玕] / Layered ice is like banked-up jade". Two of [[Du Fu]]'s poems figuratively used the word ''langgan'' in reference to the vegetation around the forest home of a Daoist recluse, and to the splendid grass that provided seating for guests at a royal picnic near a mysterious grotto (Schafer 1978: 31). Bamboo was the most typical representative of blue-green ''langgan'' in the plant world, compare ''láng'' 筤 ("[[bamboo radical]]" and the ''liáng'' phonetic in ''láng'' 琅) "young bamboo; blue'" (Schafer 1978: 32). [[Liu Yuxi]] wrote that the famous [[spotted bamboo]] of South China was "''langgan'' colored" (Schafer 1965: 545).

==Geographic sources==
Chinese texts list many diverse locations from where ''langgan'' occurred. 

Several classical works associate mythical ''langan'' trees with Kunlun Mountain (far west or northwest China), and two gives sources of actual ''langgan'' gemstones, the ''Shujing'' says it was tribute from [[Yong Province]] (present day [[Gansu]] and [[Shaanxi]]) and the ''Guanzi'' says the Kunlun desert ([[Xinjiang]] and [[Tibet]]).

Official [[Twenty-Four Histories|Chinese histories]] record ''langgan'' coming from different sources. The 3rd-century ''[[Weilüe]]'', 5th-century ''[[Hou Hanshu]]'', 6th-century ''[[Wei shu]]'', and 7th-century ''[[Liang shu]]'' list ''langgan'' among the products of [[Daqin]], which depending on context meant the [[Near East]] or the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], especially [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]]. The ''Liang shu'' also says it was found in [[Kucha]] (modern [[Aksu Prefecture]], [[Xinjiang]]), the 7th-century ''[[Book of Jin|Jinshu]]'' says in [[Shaanxi]], and the 10th-century ''[[Tangshu]]'' says in [[India]]. The ''[[Jiangnan Bielu]]'' history of the [[Southern Tang]] (937–976) says ''langgan'' was mined at Pingze 平澤 in [[Shu (state)|Shu]] ([[Sichuan Province]]) (Laufer 1915: 205). 

The Daoist scholar and alchemist [[Tao Hongjing]] (456-536) notes ''langgan'' gemstone was traditionally associated with [[Sichuan]]. The Tang pharmacologist Su Jing 蘇敬 (d. 674) reports that it came from the distant [[Nanman|Man]] tribes of the [[Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau]] and [[Hotan]]/Khotan (Schafer 1978: 29-30). Accurately identifying geographic sources may be complicated by ''langgan'' referring to more than one mineral, as discussed next.

The precise [[referent]] of the Chinese name ''langgan'' 琅玕 is uncertain in the present day. Scholars have described it as an "enigmatic archaism of politely pleasant or poetic usage" (Schafer 1961: 41), and "one of the most elusive terms in Chinese mineralogy" (Needham and Lu 1974: 296). Identifications of ''langgan'' comprise at least three categories: Blue-green ''langgan'' was first recorded circa 4th century BCE, Coral ''langgan'' from the 8th century, and Red ''langgan'' is from an uncertain date.

[[Edward H. Schafer]], an eminent scholar of Tang dynasty literature and history, discussed ''langgan'' in several books and articles. His proposed identifications gradually changed from Mediterranean red coral (1961), to coral or a glass-like gem (1963), to chrysoprase or demantoid (1965), to coral or red spinel (1967), and ultimately to malachite (1978).

===Blue-green ''langgan''===
''Langgan'' was a ''qīng'' 青 "green; blue; greenish black" (see [[blue–green distinction in language#Chinese|Blue–green distinction in language]]) gemstone of lustrous appearance mentioned in numerous classical texts. They listed it among historical imperial tribute products presented from the far western regions of China, and as the mineral-fruit of the legendary ''langgan'' trees of immortality on Mount Kunlun (Bokenkamp 1997: 289). 

Schafer's 1978 monograph on ''langgan'' sought to identify the treasured blue-green gemstone, if it ever had a unique identity, and concluded the most plausible identification is [[malachite]], a bright green mineral that was anciently used as a [[copper ore]] and an ornamental stone. Two early Chinese mineralogical authorities (Chang 1921: 24, Read and Pak 1928: 21) identified ''langgan'' as malachite, commonly called ''kǒngquèshí'' 孔雀石 (lit. "peacock stone") or ''shílǜ'' 石綠 (lit. "stone green").

Comparing blue-green stones that were known in early East Asia, Schafer disqualified several conceivable identities; [[demantoid]] garnet and green [[tourmaline]] are rarely of gem quality, while neither apple-green [[chrysoprase]] nor light greenish-blue [[turquoise]] typically have dark hues. This leaves malachite,
&lt;blockquote&gt;This handsome green carbonate of copper has important credentials. It is often found in copper mines, and is therefore regularly at the disposal of copper- and bronze-producing peoples. It has, in certain varieties, a lovely silky luster, caused by its fibrous structure. It is soft and easily cut. It takes a good polish. It was commonly made into beads both in the western and eastern worlds. Above all, even uncut malachite often has a nodular or botryoidal structure, like little clumps of bright green beads, one of the classical forms attributed to ''lang-kan''. Sometimes, too, it is stalactitic, like little stone trees. (1978: 33) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Furthermore, archeology confirms that malachite was an important gemstone of pre-Han China. Inlays of malachite and turquoise decorated many early Chinese bronze weapons and ritual vessels (MOMA 1980: 38, 188).

Tang sources continued to record blue-green ''langgan''. Su Jing's 652 ''Xinxiu bencao'' 新修本草 said it was a glassy substance similar to ''liúli'' 琉璃 "colored glaze; glass; glossy gem" that was imported from the [[Nanman|Man]] tribes in the Southwest and from [[Hotan|Khotan]] (Schafer 1963: 246). In 762, [[Emperor Daizong of Tang]] proclaimed a new [[era name]] of Baoying 寶應 "Treasure Response" in honor of the discovery of thirteen auspicious treasures in [[Jiangsu]], one of which was glassy ''langgan'' beads (1965: 545-546).

===Coral ''langgan''===
Tang dynasty herbalists and pharmacists changed the denotation of ''langgan'' from the traditional blue-green gemstone to a kind of coral. Chen Cangqi's c. 720 ''Bencao shiyi'' 本草拾遺 "Collected Addenda to the Pharmacopoeia" described it a pale red coral, growing like a branched tree on the bottom of the sea, fished by means of nets, and after coming out of the water gradually darkens and turns blue (Schafer 1963: 246; 1967: 159).

''Langan'' already had an established connection with coral. Chinese mythology matches two antipodean paradises of Mount Kunlun in the far west and [[Mount Penglai]] located on an island in the far eastern [[Bohai Sea]]. Both mountains had mythic plants and trees of immortality that attracted Daoist ''[[xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' transcendents; Kunlun's red ''langgan'' trees with blue-green fruits were paralleled by Penglai's ''shanhu shu'' 珊瑚樹 "red coral trees" (Schafer 1963: 246).

Regarding what variety of blue or green branching coral was identified as this "mineralized subaqueous shrub" ''langgan''. Since it must have been a coral attractive enough to be comparable with the extravagant myths of Kunlun, Schafer suggests considering the [[blue coral]] ''Heliopora coerula''. It is the only living species in the family Helioporidae, the only [[octocoral]] known to produce a massive skeleton, and was found throughout Pacific and Indian Oceans, although the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] currently considers it a [[vulnerable species]] (1978: 32).

Du Wan's c. 1124 ''Yunlin shipu'' mineralogy book has a section (100) on ''langgan shi'' 琅玕石 that mentions ''shanhu'' "coral". 
&lt;blockquote&gt;A coral-like stone found in shallow water along the coast of [[Ningbo]] [[Zhejiang]]. Some specimens are two or three feet high. They must be pulled up by ropes let down from rafts. Though white when first taken from the water, they turn a dull purple after a while. They are patterned everywhere with circles, like ginger branches, and are rather brittle. Though the natives hold …&lt;!--Please help provide the rest of this translation--&gt; (tr. Schafer 1961: 94-95). &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Li Shizhen]]'s 1578 ''[[Bencao Gangmu]]'' classic pharmacopeia objects to applying the term ''langgan'' to these [[marine invertebrates]], which should properly be called ''shanhu'' while ''langgan'' should only be applied to the stone occurring in the mountains. Li's commentary suggests that the terminological confusion arose from the ''Shuowen jiezi'' definition of ''shanhu'' 珊瑚: 色赤生於海或生於山 "coral is red colored and grows in the ocean or in the mountains". This puzzling description of mountain corals was more likely a textual misunderstanding than a reference to [[Coral#Evolutionary history|coral fossils]] (Laufer 1915: 205).

===Red ''langgan''===
The most recent, and least historically documented, identification of ''langgan'' is a red gemstone. The Chinese geologist Chang Hung-Chao (Zhang Hongzhao) propagated this explanation when his book about geological terms in Chinese literature identified ''langgan'' as malachite, and noted an alternative construal of reddish [[spinel]] or [[balas ruby]] from the famous mines at [[Badakhshan]] (1921: 26-27, 24). Some authors have cited Chang's balas ruby identification of ''langgan'' (e.g., Needham and Lu 1974: 180); others have used, or even confused, it with [[ruby]], in translations (e.g., "precious rubies" Knoblock 1994: 44).

However, Schafer demonstrates that Chang's "supposed" textual evidence for red ''langgan'' is tenuous and suggests that Guo Pu's ''Shanhai jing'' commentary created this mineralogical confusion. Guo glosses the ''langgan'' tree as red, but is unclear whether this refers to the tree itself or its gem-like fruit. Compare Birrell's and Bokencamp's ''Shanhai jing'' translations of "red jade" and "green kernels from scarlet gem trees" (2000: 174; 1997: 312). Chang misquotes ''dan'gan'' 丹矸 "cinnabar rock" from the ''Xunzi'' as ''dan'gan'' 丹玕 "cinnabar ''gan''", and cites one textual occurrence of the term. The Shangqing Daoist ''Dadong zhenjing'' 大洞真經 Authentic Scripture of the Great Cavern records a heavenly palace named Dan'gan dian 丹玕殿 Basilica of the Cinnabar ''Gan''. Admitting the possibility of interpreting ''gan'' 玕 as a monosyllabic truncation for ''langgan'' 琅玕, comparable with reading ''hongpo'' 红珀 for ''honghupo'' 红琥珀 "red amber", Schafer concludes there is insufficient ''dan'gan'' evidence for an explicit red variety of ''langgan'' (1978: 28). 

The lyrical term ''langgan'' occurs 87 times in the huge ''[[Quan Tangshi]]'' collection of [[Tang poetry]], with only two ''hong langgen'' 紅琅玕 "red ''langgan''" usages by the Buddhist monk-poets [[Guanxiu]] (831-912) and Ji Qi 齊己 (863-937). Both poems use ''langgan'' to describe "red coral", the latter (贈念法華經) uses ''shanhu'' in the same line: 珊瑚捶打紅琅玕 "coral beating on red ''langgan''" in cold waters.

Most of these bilingual Chinese dictionaries cross-reference ''lang'' and ''gan'' to ''langgan'', but a few translate ''lang'' and ''gan'' independently. In terms of Chinese word [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], ''láng'' 琅 is a [[free morpheme]] that can appear alone (for instance, a surname) or in other compound words (such as ''fàláng'' 琺琅 "enamel" and ''Lángyá shān'' 琅琊山 "[[Mount Langya (Anhui)]]") while ''gān'' 玕 is a [[bound morpheme]] that only occurs in the [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] ''lánggān'' and does not have independent meaning.

The origin of Giles' ''lang'' translation "a kind of white carnelian" is unknown, unless it derives from Williams' "a whitish stone". It was copied in Mathews' and various other Chinese dictionaries up to the online standard [https://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetUnihanData.pl?codepoint=U%2B7405 Unihan Database] "a variety of white carnelian; pure". "White carnelian" is a marketing name for "white or whitish chalcedony of faint carnelian color" (Manutchehr-Danai 2000: 507). Carnelian is usually reddish-brown while common chalcedony colors are white, grey, brown, and blue.

[[File:IBM 526 Printing Summary Punch.JPG|thumb|IBM 526 Printing Summary Punch, ca. 1948, with French keyboard layout]]

The following is a partial list of products, services, and subsidiaries of [[International Business Machines|International Business Machines (IBM)]] Corporation and its predecessor corporations, beginning in the 1890s. 

This list is [[wikt:eclectic|eclectic]]; it includes, for example, the ''[[AN/FSQ-7]]'', which was not a product in the sense of ''offered for sale'', but was a product in the sense of ''manufactured—produced by the labor of IBM''. Several machines manufactured for the Astronomical Computing Bureau at Columbia University are included, as are some machines built only as demonstrations of IBM technology. Missing are [[RPQ]]s, [[Original Equipment Manufacturer|OEM]] products (semiconductors, for example), and supplies (punched cards, for example). These products and others are missing simply because no one has added them.

IBM sometimes uses the same number for a system and for the principal component of that system. For example, the [[IBM 604]] Calculating Unit is a component of the [[IBM 604]] Calculating Punch. And different IBM divisions used the same model numbers; for example ''IBM 01'' without context clues could be a reference to a keypunch or to IBM's first electric typewriter.

Number sequence may not correspond to product development sequence. For example, the 402 tabulator was an improved, modernized, 405.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bashe | first = Charles J. | title = IBM's Early Computers | publisher = MIT |page=70 | year = 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

IBM uses two naming structures for its modern hardware products. Products are normally given a three- or four-digit machine type and a model number (can be a mix of letters and numbers). A product may also have a marketing or brand name. For instance, 2107 is the machine type for the IBM System Storage DS8000. While the majority of products are listed here by machine type, there are instances where only a marketing or brand name is used. Care should be taken when searching for a particular product as sometimes the type and model numbers overlap. For instance the IBM storage product known as the [[IBM Enterprise Storage Server|Enterprise Storage Server]] is machine type 2105, and the IBM printing product known as the IBM Infoprint 2105 is machine type 2705, so searching for an [[IBM 2105]] could result in two different products—or the wrong product—being found.

IBM introduced the 80-column rectangular hole punched card in 1928. Pre-1928 machine models that continued in production with the new 80-column card format had the same model number as before. Machines manufactured prior to 1928 were, in some cases, [[Keypunch#Hollerith and IBM keypunches, 1890 through 1930s|retrofitted with 80-column card readers and/or punches]] thus there existed machines with pre-1928 dates of manufacture that contain 1928 technology.

This list is organized by classifications of both machines and applications, rather than by product name. Thus some (few) entries will be duplicated. The 1420, for example, is listed both as a member of the 1401 family and as a machine for Bank and finance.

IBM product names have varied over the years; for example these two texts both reference the same product.
* Mechanical Key Punch, Type 1 (in Machine Methods of Accounting, IBM, 1936)
* Mechanical Punch, Type 001 (in IBM Electric Punched Card Accounting Machines: Principles of Operation, IBM, 1946)
This article uses the name, or combination of names, most descriptive of the product. Thus the entry for the above is  
* IBM 001: Mechanical Key Punch

Products of [[Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company|The Tabulating Machine Company]] can be identified by date, before 1933 when the subsidiaries were merged into IBM.

===Keypunches and verifiers===

* [[Keypunch|Hollerith Keyboard (pantograph) punch]]: Manual card punch, 1890&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Truesdell | first = Leon E. | title = The Development of Punch Card Tabulation in the Bureau of the Census 1890-1940 | publisher = US GPO | year = 1965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comrie]] articles from [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] 1928 and 1932, [http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/mnras.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!---- * [[IBM 002]]: Port-a-punch *** The Poulsen list (in references below) is the only known source identifying the IBM Port-A-Punch as "IBM 002".  While not disputing that claim, it seems odd for 002 to not have been assigned in the same time period as 001 (1910) and 003 (1920).  It is likely the case that Port-A-Punch was a supplies division product and thus, even if numbered, even if the number was 002—that number is not part of the data processing division numbering and is best omitted from this list.  Port-A-Punch is listed by name as the last entry in this section. -----&gt;

Some software listings are for software families, not products (''Fortran'' was not a product; ''Fortran H'' was a product).

Some IBM software products were distributed free (no charge for the software itself, a common practice early in the industry). The term "Program Product" was used by IBM to denote that it's freely available&lt;ref&gt;Unlike a [[Request price quotation |PRPQ]].&lt;/ref&gt; but not for free.&lt;ref name="unbundling-announcement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2014/06/102712825/102712825-05-01-acc.pdf|title=IBM Announcement of Program Products/SHARE 1969|date=June 23, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to June 1969, the majority of software packages written by IBM were available at no charge to IBM customers; with the June 1969 announcement, new software not designated as "System Control Programming" became Program Products, although existing non-system software remained available for free.&lt;ref name="unbundling-announcement"/&gt;

This is a list of &lt;u&gt;'''commercial'''&lt;/u&gt; [[LTE (telecommunication)|Long-Term Evolution]] (LTE) networks in [[Africa]], grouped by their frequency bands.

Some operators use multiple bands and are therefore listed multiple times in respective sections.

== General information ==
* For technical details on LTE and a list of its designated operating frequencies, bands, and roaming possibilities, see [[LTE frequency bands]].
* Bands 33 to 44 are assigned to [[Time-Division Long-Term Evolution|TDD-LTE]].

'''&lt;u&gt;Note&lt;/u&gt;: This list of network deployments does not imply any widespread deployment or national coverage.'''

&lt;ref name=CIAHIVprevalence&gt;{{ cite web | title=CIA world factbook - HIV/AIDS adult prevalence rate| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2155rank.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CIAHIVquantity&gt;{{ cite web | title=CIA world factbook - HIV/AIDS people living with| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2156rank.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CIAHIVdeaths&gt;{{ cite web | title=CIA world factbook - HIV/AIDS deaths| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2157rank.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2015, it is estimated that there are 36.7 million people worldwide infected with [[HIV]].&lt;ref name=avert&gt;{{cite web|title=GLOBAL HIV AND AIDS STATISTICS |url=http://www.avert.org/worldstats.htm |work=[[AVERT]] |accessdate=3 August 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HIV pandemic is most severe in [[South Africa]]. Over 10% of all people living with HIV/AIDS reside within the region. Adult HIV prevalence exceeds 20% in [[Eswatini|Eswatini (Swaziland)]], [[Botswana]], and [[Lesotho]], while an additional six countries report adult HIV prevalence of at least 10%. Outside Africa, the highest prevalence rate is found in the [[Bahamas]] (3.3%).&lt;ref&gt;http://factbook.lincon.com/geos/print/country/countrypdf_bf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In absolute numbers, [[South Africa]] (7.1 million), followed by [[Nigeria]] (3.2 million), and [[India]] (2.1 million) had the highest HIV/AIDS number of cases by the end of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/nigeria|title = UNAIDS.org - HIV and AIDS estimates (2013)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/india-has-3rdhighest-number-of-hivinfected-people-un/article6220483.ece|title = The Hindu - India has 3rd-highest number of HIV-infected people: UN}}&lt;/ref&gt; While South Africa's large population of HIV-positive people is attributable to its high disease prevalence (18.9%, one of the highest in the world), Nigeria's is lower at 2.9%, with India's prevalence rate at 0.3%.&lt;ref name=CIAHIVprevalence/&gt;. However, countries such as Nigeria with high HIV rates above 1% are classified as having Generalized HIV Epidemics (GHEs) by UNAIDS, while India's prevalence is well below this threshold, with a prevalence lower than America's and about the same as France &lt;ref&gt;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956462414526575#_i2&lt;/ref&gt;.

On the other end of the spectrum, [[Svalbard]] is reported as having no cases of HIV/AIDS, while Bhutan has a much larger population but still only an estimated 246 cases through 2011.&lt;ref name=BO1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/ministry-health-detected/ |title=The Ministry of Health has Detected… |publisher=[[Bhutan Observer]] online |date=2011-08-01 |accessdate=2011-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028154713/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/ministry-health-detected/ |archivedate=2011-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Magdeburg hemispheres''' are a pair of large copper hemispheres, with mating rims. They were used to demonstrate the power of [[atmospheric pressure]].  When the rims were sealed with grease and the air was pumped out, the sphere contained a [[vacuum]] and could not be pulled apart by teams of horses.  The Magdeburg hemispheres were designed by a German scientist and mayor of [[Magdeburg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Guericke, Otto von|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica, 11th Ed.|volume=12|pages=670|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|year=1910|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GFAEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA670}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otto von Guericke]], to demonstrate the air pump that he had invented, and the concept of atmospheric pressure.  The first artificial vacuum had been produced a few years earlier by [[Evangelista Torricelli]], and had inspired Guericke to design the world's first [[vacuum pump]], which consisted of a piston and cylinder with one-way flap valves.  The hemispheres became popular in physics lectures as an illustration of the strength of air pressure, and are still used in education.  A pair of the original hemispheres are preserved in the [[Deutsches Museum]] in [[Munich]].

One of them had a tube connection to attach the pump, with a valve to close it off.  When the air was sucked out from inside the hemispheres, and the valve was closed, the hose from the pump could be detached, and they were held firmly together by the [[air pressure]] of the surrounding [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].

The force holding the hemispheres together was equal to the area bounded by the joint between the hemispheres, a [[circle]] with a diameter of 50&amp;nbsp;cm, multiplied by the difference in air pressure between the inside and the outside.  It is unclear how strong a vacuum Guericke's pump was able to achieve, but if it was able to evacuate all of the air from the inside, the hemispheres would have been held together with a force of around 20&amp;thinsp;000&amp;nbsp;[[Newton (unit)|N]] (4400&amp;nbsp;[[lbf]], or 2.2 [[short ton]]s),&lt;ref name="Hyperphysics"&gt;{{cite web

{{math| ''P''₀ * &amp;pi; * ''r''²}}, where ''P''₀=air pressure and ''r''=cross-sectional radius of the hemisphere. Due to the inefficiencies of the vacuum pump, the artificial vacuum was likely much weaker.&lt;/ref&gt; equivalent to lifting a car or small [[elephant]]; a dramatic demonstration of the [[atmospheric pressure|pressure of the atmosphere]].

== Demonstrations ==
[[Image:Magdeburg hemispheres small.png|thumb|upright=0.75|Small 4 in. hemispheres, 1870s]]

Guericke's demonstration was performed on 8 May 1654&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Horizon: A History of Our Infinite Longing |first1=Didier |last1=Maleuvre |publisher=University of California Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-520-94711-5 |page=181 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pUldN1FCGmwC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=pUldN1FCGmwC&amp;pg=PA181 Extract of page 181]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Twenty-Two Turbulent Years 1639 - 1661 |first1=David C. |last1=Wallace |publisher=Fast-Print Publishing |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-78035-660-0 |page=156 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mkpl2cBZn3gC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=Mkpl2cBZn3gC&amp;pg=PA156 Extract of page 156]&lt;/ref&gt; in front of the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]], and the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] in [[Regensburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Guericke, Otto von|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica, 11th Edition|volume=9|page=670|publisher=The Encyclopædia Britannica Co.|year=1910|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GFAEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA670&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thirty horses, in two teams of fifteen, could not separate the hemispheres until the valve was opened to equalize the air pressure. In 1656 he repeated the demonstration with sixteen horses (two teams of eight) in his hometown of [[Magdeburg]], where he was mayor. He also took the two spheres, hung the two hemispheres with a support, and removed the air from within. He then strapped weights to the spheres, but the spheres would not budge. [[Gaspar Schott]] was the first to describe the experiment in print in his ''Mechanica Hydraulico-Pneumatica'' (1657). In 1663 (or, according to some sources, in 1661) the same demonstration was given in [[Berlin]]  before [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]] with twenty-four horses.

The experiment became a popular way to illustrate the principles of [[air pressure]], and many smaller copies of the hemispheres were made, and are used to this day in science classes.  Reenactments of von Guericke's experiment of 1654 are performed in locations around the world by the Otto von Guericke Society. On 18 March 2000, a demonstration using sixteen horses was conducted in [[Great Torrington]] by [[Barometer World]].

The experiment has been commemorated on at least two German stamps.

After learning about Guericke's pump through Schott's book, [[Robert Boyle]] worked with [[Robert Hooke]] to design and build an improved air pump. From this, through various experiments, they formulated what is called [[Boyle's law]], which states that the volume of a body of an ideal gas is inversely proportional to its pressure.  Much later the [[ideal gas law]] was formulated in 1834.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4635">'''Marconi's law''' is the relation between length of [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]] and maximum signaling distance of [[radio transmission]]s. [[Guglielmo Marconi]] enunciated at one time an [[empirical law]] that, for [[radio transmitter|simple vertical sending]] and [[radio receiver|receiving antennas]] of equal height, the maximum working [[radio telegraphy|telegraphic]] distance varied as the square of the height of the antenna. It has been stated that the rule was tested in experiments made on [[Salisbury Plain]] in 1897, and also by experiments made by Italian [[naval officer]]s on behalf of the [[Royal Italian Navy]] in 1900 and 1901. [[Captain (nautical)|Captain]] [[Quintino Bonomo]] gave a report of these experiments in an official report.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Description==
{{expand section|date=December 2010}}
&lt;!-- Need the equation put in here --&gt;

If ''H'' is the height (i.e. the length) of the antenna and ''D'' the maximum signalling distance, then we have, according to ''Marconi's law''
: &lt;math&gt;H = c \sqrt{D}&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''c'' is some constant.

''Marconi's law'' can be deduced theoretically as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, J. A. (1906). The principles of electric wave telegraphy. London: Longmans, Green, and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Heinrich Hertz|Hertz]] has shown that distances large compared with its length the magnetic force of a linear oscillator varies inversely as the distance. The maximum value of the current set up in any given receiving antenna varies as its length, also as the magnetic force of the waves incident on it, and as the maximum value of the current in the transmitting antenna. Hence, if &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic force of the waves incident on a receiving antenna of height H, and if &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the sending and receiving antenna, and if &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_2&lt;/math&gt; are the maximum values of the currents in the sending and receiving antennæ, we have—

&lt;math&gt;M \propto \frac{I_1}{D}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_2 \propto MH&lt;/math&gt;

Hence &lt;math&gt;I_2 \propto \frac{I_2H}{D}&lt;/math&gt;

Also, since for a given charging voltage the current &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt; in the sending antenna varies very nearly as its capacity—that is, as its height—and if the sending antenna has the same height, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, as the receiving aerial, we have—

&lt;math&gt;I_1 \propto H&lt;/math&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;I_2 \propto \frac{I_1H}{D}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore &lt;math&gt;I_2 \propto \frac{H^2}{D} \propto&lt;/math&gt; some constant

For any given receiving apparatus a certain constant minimum value of the maximum current in the receiving antenna is necessary to cause a signal. Therefore it follows that, with given receiving and sending apparatus, we must have &lt;math&gt;\frac{H^2}{D}&lt;/math&gt; a constant, or—

&lt;math&gt;H = c \sqrt{D}&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the maximum signalling distance with given apparatus will vary as the square of the height of the antenna.

The above law is, however, much interfered with by the nature of the surface over which the propagation takes place.

'''Nano spray dryers''' refer to using [[spray drying]] to create particles in the nanometer range.  Spray drying is a gentle method for producing [[Powder (substance)|powder]]s with a defined particle size out of solutions, dispersions, and emulsions which is widely used for pharmaceuticals, food, biotechnology, and other industrial materials synthesis. 

In the past, the limitations of spray drying were the particle size (minimum 2 [[micrometre]]s), the yield (maximum around 70%), and the sample volume (minimum 50 ml for devices in lab scale).  Recently, minimum particle sizes have been reduced to 300 [[nanometer|nm]], yields up to 90% are possible, and the sample amount can be as small as 1 ml. These expanded limits are possible due to new technological developments to the spray head, the heating system, and the electrostatic particle collector. To emphasize the small particle sizes possible with this new technology, it has been described as "nano" spray drying.  However, the smallest particles produced are in the sub-micrometre range common to [[Particulate|fine particle]]s rather than the nanometer scale of [[ultrafine particles]].
[[File:functional principle nano 01.jpg|thumb|200px|Functional principle of a nano spray dryer]]

== Functional principle ==
The functional principle is basically the same as with normal spray dryers. There are just different technologies that are used to do similar things.

The drying gas enters the system via the heater. A new kind of heater system allows for [[Laminar flow|laminar air flow]]. The spray head sprays the fine droplets with a narrow size distribution into the drying chamber. The droplets dry and become solid particles. The solid particles are separated in the electrostatic particle collector. The [[exhaust gas]] is filtered and sent to a fume hood or the environment. The inlet temperature is controlled by a temperature sensor.

== Applications ==

[[File:Gelatine Particles 01.jpg|thumb|Scanning electron micrograph of gelatine particles spray dried with a nano spray dryer]]
[[File:Grisofulvin particles.jpg|thumb|Scanning electron micrograph of grisofulvin particles spray dried with a nano spray dryer]]

'''Pharmaceuticals''':
This technique is widely used in the [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharma]] market. Because of the small sample amounts and the high yields it is ideal for spray drying expensive substances in basic research. The following list shows examples of what is possible:

*[[Inhalation|Inhalable]] drugs for dry powder [[inhaler]]s (DPI‘s)
*Nano- and [[microencapsulation]] of [[liposome]]s
*Stabilization of heat-sensitive [[vaccine]]s, [[insulin]], growth hormones
*[[Micro-encapsulation|Encapsulation]] of [[nanoparticle]] [[drug]]s for high [[bioavailability]]
*Nanocapsules of [[biodegradable polymers]] ([[lactides]], [[glycolide]]s)
*Porous drug carriers for nanoparticle suspensions
*[[Excipients]] for controlled drug release studies: [[trehalose]], [[mannitol]], [[lactose]], [[HPMC]], [[Polyvinyl alcohol|PVA]], [[chitosan]], [[dextrine]], [[PLGA]], [[starch]], [[gelatin]]

'''Materials science''':
This new technique offers new prospects in [[materials science]], specially in the [[nanomaterial]] field. Now it is possible to spray dry fine particles. The following list shows examples of what is possible:
*Fine metal particles for novel [[catalyst]]s
*Fine [[magnetic]] powders
*[[Carbon nanotube]]s as additives
*High performance [[ceramic]]s with novel structures and high specific surface area
*[[Titanium oxide]] particles
*Nanoparticle suspensions for [[Flocculation|agglomeration]]
*[[Silicon oxide]] nanoparticle agglomerates
*Finest [[pigment]]s for [[paint]]s and [[coating]]s

'''Food''':
Also in the field of [[food science]] this technology offers new possibilities. Especially in the currently vibrant field of [[functional food]], the following list shows examples of what is possible:
*Nano food – Functional [[Food additive|additives]]
*Encapsulation of fruit [[aroma]]s, [[flavour]]s, or [[perfume]]s
*Spray drying of fine powder aromas for pet food
*Encapsulation of fish oil for smell protection
*[[Vitamins]], other food additives, etc.

== Spray head ==
One of the three new technologies that makes "nano" spray drying possible is the spray head. 
A piezoelectric system precisely vibrates a fine [[mesh]]. Vibration produces fine droplets with a narrow [[Particle size distribution|size distribution]].

[[File:Mesh vibration.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Vibrating mesh of a nano spray dryer spray head]]
[[File:Droplet size distribution 01.jpg|left|thumb|335px|Size distribution of the droplets produced by the spray head]]
{{clear}}

== Heating system ==
In the field of "nano" spray drying a new heating system is used to provide the drying gas to produce the particles. The gas flow in the system is laminar and not turbulent as in common spray drying. The advantage of a laminar flow is that the particles fall straight down from the spray head and do not stick to the glass wall.

The laminar flow is produced by pressing the air through a porous [[metal foam]].

== Electrostatic particle collector ==
To collect the very fine particles a new technology is used in the field of "nano" spray drying. The reason is that common cyclone technology depends on the particle mass; particles smaller than 2 μm can’t be separated and instead exit the system along with the exhaust gas.

The electrostatic particle collector charges the dry particles' surface and deflects them with an electrical field. To produce the electrical field, a high voltage (16 kV) is applied to a round collector tube. The electrical field builds up between the inner wall of the collector tube and the tips of a grounded star electrode. To have a low level of energy in the system the current is very low.

After getting deflected the particles stay at the inner wall of the particle collector tube and are completely uncharged. This separation method works fine for all kinds of materials.

The efficiency of the electrostatic particle collector is very high: 99% of all particles that enter the system are collected.

{{GeoGroup|article=Operation Tinderbox}}

'''Operation Tinderbox'''&lt;ref name=LT_1 /&gt; was a series of 14 [[nuclear test]]s conducted by the United States in 1979-1980 at the [[Nevada Test Site]]. These tests followed the ''[[Operation Quicksilver (1978)|Operation Quicksilver]]'' series and preceded the ''[[Operation Guardian]]'' series.

 |-
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | Name &lt;ref group=note&gt;The US, France and Great Britain have code-named their test events, while the USSR and China did not, and therefore have only test numbers (with some exceptions &amp;ndash; Soviet peaceful explosions were named). Word translations into English in parentheses unless the name is a proper noun. A dash followed by a number indicates a member of a salvo event.  The US also sometimes named the individual explosions in such a salvo test, which results in "name1 &amp;ndash; 1(with name2)". If test is canceled or aborted, then the row data like date and location discloses the intended plans, where known.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | Date time ([[Universal Time|UT]])
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | Local [[Time Zone|time zone]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;To convert the UT time into standard local, add the number of hours in parentheses to the UT time; for local daylight saving time, add one additional hour. If the result is earlier than 00:00, add 24 hours and subtract 1 from the day; if it is 24:00 or later, subtract 24 hours and add 1 to the day. All historical timezone data are derived from here:&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Timezone Historical Database| publisher=iana.com| url=http://www.ietf.org/timezones/| accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | [[List of nuclear test sites|Location]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Rough place name and a latitude/longitude reference; for rocket-carried tests, the launch location is specified before the detonation location, if known. Some locations are extremely accurate; others (like airdrops and space blasts) may be quite inaccurate. "~" indicates a likely pro-forma rough location, shared with other tests in that same area.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | [[Elevation]] + height &lt;ref group=note&gt;Elevation is the ground level at the point directly below the explosion relative to sea level; height is the additional distance added or subtracted by tower, balloon, shaft, tunnel, air drop or other contrivance. For rocket bursts the ground level is "N/A". In some cases it is not clear if the height is absolute or relative to ground, for example, ''Plumbbob/John''.  No number or units indicates the value is unknown, while "0" means zero. Sorting on this column is by elevation and height added together.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | Delivery &lt;ref group=note&gt;Atmospheric, airdrop, balloon, gun, cruise missile, rocket, surface, tower, and barge are all disallowed by the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]]. Sealed shaft and tunnel are underground, and remained useful under the PTBT. Intentional cratering tests are borderline; they occurred under the treaty, were sometimes protested, and generally overlooked if the test was declared to be a peaceful use.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purpose &lt;ref group=note&gt;Include weapons development, weapon effects, safety test, transport safety test, war, science, joint verification and industrial/peaceful, which may be further broken down.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | [[List of nuclear weapons|Device]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Designations for test items where known, "?" indicates some uncertainty about the preceding value, nicknames for particular devices in quotes. This category of information is often not officially disclosed.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | [[Nuclear weapon yield|Yield]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Estimated energy yield in [[TNT equivalent|tons, kilotons, and megatons]]. A ton of TNT equivalent is defined as 4.184&amp;nbsp;gigajoules (1&amp;nbsp;gigacalorie).&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" class="unsortable" | [[Nuclear fallout|Fallout]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Radioactive emission to the atmosphere aside from prompt neutrons, where known.  The measured species is only iodine-131 if mentioned, otherwise it is all species. No entry means unknown, probably none if underground and "all" if not; otherwise notation for whether measured on the site only or off the site, where known, and the measured amount of radioactivity released.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4589">'''Osmotic shock''' or '''osmotic stress''' is [[physiology|physiologic]] dysfunction caused by a sudden change in the [[Solution|solute]] concentration around a [[Cell (biology)|cell]], which causes a rapid change in the movement of [[water]] across its [[cell membrane]]. Under conditions of high concentrations of either [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s, [[substrate (biology)|substrates]] or any solute in the [[supernatant]], water is drawn out of the cells through [[osmosis]]. This also inhibits the transport of substrates and cofactors into the cell thus “shocking” the cell. Alternatively, at low concentrations of solutes, water enters the cell in large amounts, causing it to swell and either burst or undergo [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lang KS |title=Mechanisms of suicidal erythrocyte death |journal=Cell.

'''Photosynthesis''' is a process used by plants and other organisms to [[Energy transformation|convert]] [[Light|light energy]] into [[chemical energy]] that can later be [[cellular respiration|released]] to fuel the organisms' activities. This chemical energy is stored in [[carbohydrates|carbohydrate molecules]], such as [[sugar]]s, which are synthesized from [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]] – hence the name ''photosynthesis'', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wiktionary:φῶς|φῶς]], ''phōs'', "light", and [[wiktionary:σύνθεσις|σύνθεσις]], ''synthesis'', "putting together".&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web |title=photosynthesis |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=photosynthesis&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LSJ1&gt;{{LSJ|fw{{=}}s2|φῶς|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LSJ2&gt;{{LSJ|su/nqesis|σύνθεσις|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, [[oxygen]] is also released as a waste product. Most [[plant]]s, most [[algae]], and [[cyanobacteria]] perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called [[photoautotroph]]s. Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the [[atmospheric oxygen|oxygen content]] of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies all of the organic compounds and most of the energy necessary for [[life|life on Earth]].&lt;ref name=bryantfrigaard&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bryant DA, Frigaard NU |title=Prokaryotic photosynthesis and phototrophy illuminated |journal=[[Trends in Microbiology]] |volume=14 |issue=11 |pages=488–96 |date=Nov 2006 |pmid=16997562 |doi=10.1016/j.tim.2006.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although photosynthesis is performed differently by different species, the process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by [[protein]]s called [[photosynthetic reaction centre|reaction centres]] that contain green [[chlorophyll]] pigments. In plants, these proteins are held inside [[organelle]]s called [[chloroplast]]s, which are most abundant in leaf cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in the [[plasma membrane]]. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip [[electron]]s from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two further compounds that serve as short-term stores of energy, enabling its transfer to drive other reactions: these compounds are reduced [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate]] (NADPH) and [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), the "energy currency" of cells.

In plants, algae and cyanobacteria, long-term energy storage in the form of sugars is produced by a subsequent sequence of {{nobreak|light-independent}} reactions called the [[Calvin cycle]]; some bacteria use different mechanisms, such as the [[reverse Krebs cycle]], to achieve the same end. In the Calvin cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide is [[carbon fixation|incorporated]] into already existing organic carbon compounds, such as [[ribulose bisphosphate]] (RuBP).&lt;ref name="isbn0-321-73975-2"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Reece J, Urry L, Cain M, Wasserman S, Minorsky P, Jackson R |title=Biology |edition=International |publisher=[[Pearson Education]] |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |isbn=978-0-321-73975-9 |pages=235, 244 |quote=This initial incorporation of carbon into organic compounds is known as carbon fixation.|year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions, the resulting compounds are then [[biological reductant|reduced]] and removed to form further carbohydrates, such as [[glucose]].

==Overview==
[[File:Simple photosynthesis overview.svg|thumb|Photosynthesis changes sunlight into chemical energy, splits water to liberate O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and fixes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into sugar.]]
Photosynthetic organisms are [[photoautotroph]]s, which means that they are able to [[Chemical synthesis|synthesize]] food directly from carbon dioxide and water using energy from light. However, not all organisms use carbon dioxide as a source of carbon atoms to carry out photosynthesis; [[photoheterotroph]]s use organic compounds, rather than carbon dioxide, as a source of carbon.&lt;ref name=bryantfrigaard/&gt; In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosynthesis releases oxygen. This is called ''oxygenic photosynthesis'' and is by far the most common type of photosynthesis used by living organisms. Although there are some differences between oxygenic photosynthesis in [[plants]], [[algae]], and [[cyanobacteria]], the overall process is quite similar in these organisms. There are also many varieties of [[anoxygenic photosynthesis]], used mostly by certain types of bacteria, which consume carbon dioxide but do not release oxygen.

Carbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called [[carbon fixation]]; photosynthesis captures energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into [[carbohydrate]]. Carbon fixation is an [[endothermic]] [[redox]] reaction. In general outline, photosynthesis is the opposite of [[cellular respiration]]: while photosyntesis is a process of reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrate, cellular respiration is the oxidation of carbohydrate or other [[nutrient]]s to carbon dioxide. Nutrients used in cellular respiration include carbohydrates, amino acids and fatty acids. These nutrients are oxidized to produce carbon dioxide and water, and to release chemical energy to drive the organism's [[metabolism]]. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are distinct processes, as they take place through different sequences of chemical reactions and in different [[cellular compartment]]s.

The general [[chemical equation|equation]] for photosynthesis as first proposed by [[C. B. van Niel|Cornelis van Niel]] is therefore:&lt;ref name = "Whitmarsh_1999"&gt;{{cite book | veditors = Singhal GS, Renger G, Sopory SK, Irrgang KD, Govindjee | title = Concepts in Photobiology: Photosynthesis and Photomorphogenesis | chapter = Chapter 2: The Basic Photosynthetic Process | vauthors = Whitmarsh J, Govindjee | year = 1999 | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | location = Boston | isbn = 978-0-7923-5519-9 | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=dqSuoOtDM1cC&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=photosynthesis%20reaction%20equation%20generalized&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q=photosynthesis%20reaction%20equation%20generalized&amp;f=false | page = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{underset|carbon&lt;br/&gt;dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} + {{underset|electron donor|2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A}} + {{underset|light energy|[[photons]]}} → {{underset|[[carbohydrate]]|[&amp;#8203;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&amp;#8203;]}} + {{underset|oxidized&lt;br/&gt;electron&lt;br/&gt;donor|2A}} + {{underset|water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}}

Since water is used as the electron donor in oxygenic photosynthesis, the equation for this process is:
: {{underset|carbon&lt;br/&gt;dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} + {{underset|water|2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}} + {{underset|light energy|photons}} → {{underset|carbohydrate|[CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]}} + {{underset|oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} + {{underset|water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}}

This equation emphasizes that water is both a reactant in the [[#Light-dependent reactions|light-dependent reaction]] and a product of the [[#Light-independent reactions|light-independent reaction]], but canceling ''n'' water molecules from each side gives the net equation:

: {{underset|carbon&lt;br/&gt;dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} + {{underset| water |H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}} + {{underset|light energy|photons}} → {{underset|carbohydrate|[CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]}} + {{underset| oxygen |O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}

Other processes substitute other compounds (such as [[arsenite]]) for water in the electron-supply role; for example some microbes use sunlight to oxidize arsenite to [[arsenate]]:&lt;ref&gt;''Anaerobic Photosynthesis'', [[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]], '''86''', 33, August 18, 2008, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The equation for this reaction is:

Photosynthesis occurs in two stages. In the first stage, ''light-dependent reactions'' or ''light reactions'' capture the energy of light and use it to make the energy-storage molecules [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[NADPH]]. During the second stage, the ''light-independent reactions'' use these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide.

Most organisms that utilize oxygenic photosynthesis use [[Visible spectrum|visible light]] for the light-dependent reactions, although at least three use shortwave [[infrared]] or, more specifically, far-red radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Scientists discover unique microbe in California's largest lake | url = http://www.bio-medicine.org/biology-news/Scientists-discover-unique-microbe-in-Californias-largest-lake-203-1/ | accessdate = 2009-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organisms employ even more radical variants of photosynthesis. Some [[archaea]] use a simpler method that employs a pigment similar to those used for vision in animals. The [[bacteriorhodopsin]] changes its configuration in response to sunlight, acting as a proton pump. This produces a proton gradient more directly, which is then converted to chemical energy. The process does not involve carbon dioxide fixation and does not release oxygen, and seems to have evolved separately from the more common types of photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=L8DHHSO2RFsC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=bacteriorhodopsin+photosynthesis+evolved+separately Plants: Diversity and Evolution], page 14, Martin Ingrouille, Bill Eddie&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://evolutionarynovelty.blogspot.co.uk/2008/12/opsins-amazing-evolutionary-convergence.html Evolution of Photosynthesis]&lt;/ref&gt;

In photosynthetic bacteria, the proteins that gather light for photosynthesis are embedded in [[cell membrane]]s. In its simplest form, this involves the membrane surrounding the cell itself.&lt;ref name="pmid17055774"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tavano CL, Donohue TJ |title=Development of the bacterial photosynthetic apparatus |journal=[[Current Opinion in Microbiology]] |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=625–31 |date=Dec 2006 |pmid=17055774 |pmc=2765710 |doi=10.1016/j.mib.2006.10.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the membrane may be tightly folded into cylindrical sheets called [[thylakoid]]s,&lt;ref name=Mullineaux1999/&gt; or bunched up into round [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] called ''intracytoplasmic membranes''.&lt;ref name="pmid17895378"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sener MK, Olsen JD, Hunter CN, Schulten K |title=Atomic-level structural and functional model of a bacterial photosynthetic membrane vesicle |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume=104 |issue=40 |pages=15723–8 |date=Oct 2007 |pmid=17895378 |pmc=2000399 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0706861104 |bibcode=2007PNAS..10415723S }}&lt;/ref&gt; These structures can fill most of the interior of a cell, giving the membrane a very large surface area and therefore increasing the amount of light that the bacteria can absorb.&lt;ref name=Mullineaux1999&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mullineaux CW |year=1999 |title=The thylakoid membranes of cyanobacteria: structure, dynamics and function |journal=[[Australian Journal of Plant Physiology]] |volume=26 |issue=7 |pages=671–677 |doi=10.1071/PP99027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In plants and algae, photosynthesis takes place in [[organelle]]s called [[chloroplast]]s. A typical [[plant cell]] contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts. The chloroplast is enclosed by a membrane. This membrane is composed of a phospholipid inner membrane, a phospholipid outer membrane, and an intermembrane space. Enclosed by the membrane is an aqueous fluid called the stroma. Embedded within the stroma are stacks of thylakoids (grana), which are the site of photosynthesis. The thylakoids appear as flattened disks. The thylakoid itself is enclosed by the thylakoid membrane, and within the enclosed volume is a lumen or thylakoid space. Embedded in the thylakoid membrane are integral and [[peripheral membrane protein]] complexes of the photosynthetic system.

Plants absorb light primarily using the [[pigment]] [[chlorophyll]]. The green part of the light spectrum is not absorbed but is reflected which is the reason that most plants have a green color. Besides chlorophyll, plants also use pigments such as [[carotene]]s and [[xanthophyll]]s.&lt;ref name="isbn0-13-250882-6"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Campbell NA, Williamson B, Heyden RJ |title=Biology Exploring Life |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=978-0-13-250882-7 |url=http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Algae also use chlorophyll, but various other pigments are present, such as [[phycocyanin]], [[carotene]]s, and [[xanthophyll]]s in [[green algae]], [[phycoerythrin]] in [[red algae]] (rhodophytes) and [[fucoxanthin]] in [[brown algae]] and [[diatoms]] resulting in a wide variety of colors.

These pigments are embedded in plants and algae in complexes called antenna proteins. In such proteins, the pigments are arranged to work together. Such a combination of proteins is also called a [[light-harvesting complex]].

Although all cells in the green parts of a plant have chloroplasts, the majority of those are found in specially adapted structures called [[leaf|leaves]]. Certain species adapted to conditions of strong sunlight and [[arid]]ity, such as many [[Euphorbia]] and [[cactus]] species, have their main photosynthetic organs in their stems. The cells in the interior tissues of a leaf, called the [[mesophyll tissue|mesophyll]], can contain between 450,000 and 800,000 chloroplasts for every square millimeter of leaf. The surface of the leaf is coated with a water-resistant [[wax]]y [[Plant cuticle|cuticle]] that protects the leaf from excessive [[evaporation]] of water and decreases the absorption of [[ultraviolet]] or [[blue]] [[light]] to reduce [[heat]]ing. The transparent [[Leaf#Epidermis|epidermis]] layer allows light to pass through to the [[Mesophyll tissue|palisade]] mesophyll cells where most of the photosynthesis takes place.

==Light-dependent reactions==
[[File:Thylakoid membrane 3.svg|thumb|450px|right|Light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis at the thylakoid membrane]]
{{Main|Light-dependent reactions}}
In the [[light-dependent reactions]], one molecule of the [[pigment]] [[chlorophyll]] absorbs one [[photon]] and loses one [[electron]]. This electron is passed to a modified form of chlorophyll called [[pheophytin]], which passes the electron to a [[quinone]] molecule, starting the flow of electrons down an [[electron transport chain]] that leads to the ultimate reduction of [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADP]] to [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADPH]]. In addition, this creates a [[Electrochemical gradient|proton gradient]] (energy gradient) across the [[chloroplast membrane]], which is used by [[ATP synthase]] in the synthesis of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. The chlorophyll molecule ultimately regains the electron it lost when a water molecule is split in a process called [[Photodissociation|photolysis]], which releases a [[dioxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) molecule as a waste product.

The overall equation for the light-dependent reactions under the conditions of non-cyclic electron flow in green plants is:&lt;ref name="Raven"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Raven PH, Evert RF, Eichhorn SE |title=Biology of Plants |edition=7th |publisher=[[W. H. Freeman and Company]] |year=2005 |location=New York |pages=124–127 |isbn=978-0-7167-1007-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 3 ADP + 3 P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + light → 2 NADPH + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 3 ATP + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Not all [[wavelength]]s of light can support photosynthesis. The photosynthetic action spectrum depends on the type of [[accessory pigment]]s present. For example, in green plants, the [[action spectrum]] resembles the [[absorption spectrum]] for [[chlorophyll]]s and [[carotenoid]]s with absorption peaks in violet-blue and red light. In red algae, the action spectrum  is blue-green light, which allows these algae to use the blue end of the spectrum to grow in the deeper waters that filter out the longer wavelengths (red light) used by above ground green plants. The non-absorbed part of the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|light spectrum]] is what gives photosynthetic organisms their color (e.g., green plants, red algae, purple bacteria) and is the least effective for photosynthesis in the respective organisms.

===Z scheme===
[[File:Z-scheme.png|thumb|675px|center|The "Z scheme"]]
In plants, [[light-dependent reaction]]s occur in the [[thylakoid membrane]]s of the [[chloroplast]]s where they drive the synthesis of ATP and NADPH. The light-dependent reactions are of two forms: cyclic and non-cyclic.

In the non-cyclic reaction, the [[photon]]s are captured in the light-harvesting [[antenna complex]]es of [[Photosystem|photosystem II]] by [[chlorophyll]] and other [[accessory pigments]] (see diagram at right). The absorption of a photon by the antenna complex frees an electron by a process called [[photoinduced charge separation]]. The antenna system is at the core of the chlorophyll molecule of the photosystem II reaction center. That freed electron is transferred to the primary electron-acceptor molecule, pheophytin. As the electrons are shuttled through an [[Electron transfer chain|electron transport chain]] (the so-called '''''Z-scheme''''' shown in the diagram), it initially functions to generate a [[chemiosmotic potential]] by pumping proton cations (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) across the membrane and into the thylakoid space. An [[ATP synthase]] enzyme uses that chemiosmotic potential to make ATP during [[photophosphorylation]], whereas [[NADPH]] is a product of the terminal [[redox]] reaction in the ''Z-scheme''. The electron enters a chlorophyll molecule in [[Photosystem I]]. There it is further excited by the light absorbed by that [[photosystem]]. The electron is then passed along a chain of [[electron acceptor]]s to which it transfers some of its energy. The energy delivered to the electron acceptors is used to move hydrogen ions across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen. The electron is eventually used to reduce the co-enzyme NADP with a H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to NADPH (which has functions in the light-independent reaction); at that point, the path of that electron ends.

The cyclic reaction is similar to that of the non-cyclic, but differs in that it generates only ATP, and no reduced NADP (NADPH) is created. The cyclic reaction takes place only at photosystem I. Once the electron is displaced from the photosystem, the electron is passed down the electron acceptor molecules and returns to photosystem I, from where it was emitted, hence the name ''cyclic reaction''.

===Water photolysis===
{{Main|Photodissociation|Oxygen evolution}}
The NADPH is the main [[reducing agent]] produced by chloroplasts, which then goes on to provide a source of energetic electrons in other cellular reactions. Its production leaves chlorophyll in photosystem I with a deficit of electrons (chlorophyll has been oxidized), which must be balanced by some other reducing agent that will supply the missing electron. The excited electrons lost from chlorophyll from [[photosystem I]] are supplied from the electron transport chain by [[plastocyanin]]. However, since [[photosystem II]] is the first step of the ''Z-scheme'', an external source of electrons is required to reduce its oxidized '''chlorophyll ''a''''' molecules. The source of electrons in green-plant and cyanobacterial photosynthesis is water. Two water molecules are oxidized by four successive charge-separation reactions by photosystem II to yield a molecule of diatomic [[oxygen]] and four [[hydrogen]] ions; the electrons yielded are transferred to a redox-active [[tyrosine]] residue that then reduces the oxidized chlorophyll ''a'' (called P680) that serves as the primary light-driven electron donor in the photosystem II reaction center. That photo receptor is in effect reset and is then able to repeat the absorption of another photon and the release of another photo-dissociated electron. The oxidation of water is [[catalysis|catalyzed]] in photosystem II by a redox-active structure that contains four [[manganese]] ions and a calcium ion; this [[oxygen-evolving complex]] binds two water molecules and contains the four oxidizing equivalents that are used to drive the water-oxidizing reaction (Dolai's S-state diagrams).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Umasankar | last = Dolai | name-list-format = vanc | title = Chemical Scheme of Water-Splitting Process during Photosynthesis by the Way of Experimental Analysis | journal = IOSR Journal of Pharmacy and Biological Sciences | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | year = 2017 | pages = 65–67 | doi = 10.9790/3008-1206026567 | doi-broken-date = 2018-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Photosystem II is the only known biological [[enzyme]] that carries out this oxidation of water. The hydrogen ions released contribute to the transmembrane chemiosmotic potential that leads to ATP synthesis. Oxygen is a waste product of light-dependent reactions, but the majority of organisms on Earth use oxygen for [[cellular respiration]], including photosynthetic organisms.&lt;ref name="VK Yachandra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbl.gov/~vkyachan/index.html |title=Yachandra Group Home page}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18250316"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pushkar Y, Yano J, Sauer K, Boussac A, Yachandra VK |title=Structural changes in the Mn4Ca cluster and the mechanism of photosynthetic water splitting |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume=105 |issue=6 |pages=1879–84 |date=Feb 2008 |pmid=18250316 |pmc=2542863 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0707092105 |bibcode=2008PNAS..105.1879P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Light-independent reactions==

===Calvin cycle===
{{Main|Light-independent reactions|Carbon fixation}}
In the [[light-independent reactions|light-independent]] (or "dark") reactions, the [[enzyme]] [[RuBisCO]] captures [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] from the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and, in a process called the [[Calvin cycle]], it uses the newly formed NADPH and releases three-carbon sugars, which are later combined to form sucrose and starch. The overall equation for the light-independent reactions in green plants is&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt;{{rp|128}}

:3 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 9 ATP + 6 NADPH + 6 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-phosphate + 9 ADP + 8 P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

[[File:Calvin-cycle4.svg|thumb|right|400px|Overview of the Calvin cycle and carbon fixation]]
[[Carbon fixation]] produces the intermediate three-carbon sugar product, which is then converted into the final carbohydrate products. The simple carbon sugars produced by photosynthesis are then used in the forming of other organic compounds, such as the building material [[cellulose]], the precursors for [[lipid]] and [[amino acid]] biosynthesis, or as a fuel in [[cellular respiration]]. The latter occurs not only in plants but also in [[animal]]s when the energy from plants is passed through a [[food chain]].

The fixation or reduction of carbon dioxide is a process in which [[carbon dioxide]] combines with a five-carbon sugar, [[ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate]], to yield two molecules of a three-carbon compound, [[glycerate 3-phosphate]], also known as 3-phosphoglycerate. Glycerate 3-phosphate, in the presence of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[NADPH]] produced during the light-dependent stages, is reduced to [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]]. This product is also referred to as 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde ([[PGAL]]) or, more generically, as [[triose]] phosphate. Most (5 out of 6 molecules) of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced is used to regenerate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate so the process can continue. The triose phosphates not thus "recycled" often condense to form [[hexose]] phosphates, which ultimately yield [[sucrose]], [[starch]] and [[cellulose]]. The sugars produced during carbon [[metabolism]] yield carbon skeletons that can be used for other metabolic reactions like the production of [[amino acids]] and [[lipids]].

===Carbon concentrating mechanisms===

====On land====
[[File:HatchSlackpathway2.svg|thumb|right|400px|Overview of [[C4 carbon fixation]]]]
In hot and dry conditions, plants close their [[stomata]] to prevent water loss. Under these conditions, {{co2}} will decrease and oxygen gas, produced by the light reactions of photosynthesis, will increase, causing an increase of [[photorespiration]] by the [[oxygenase]] activity of [[Rubisco|ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase]] and decrease in carbon fixation. Some plants have [[evolution|evolved]] mechanisms to increase the {{co2}} concentration in the leaves under these conditions.&lt;ref name="williamsjohnston"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Williams BP, Johnston IG, Covshoff S, Hibberd JM |title=Phenotypic landscape inference reveals multiple evolutionary paths to C4 photosynthesis |journal=[[eLife]] |volume=2 |pages=e00961 |date=September 2013 |pmid=24082995 |doi=10.7554/eLife.00961 |pmc=3786385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|C4 carbon fixation}}

Plants that use the [[C4 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] carbon fixation process chemically fix carbon dioxide in the cells of the mesophyll by adding it to the three-carbon molecule [[Phosphoenolpyruvate|phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)]], a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme called [[Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase|PEP carboxylase]], creating the four-carbon organic acid [[oxaloacetic acid]]. Oxaloacetic acid or [[malate]] synthesized by this process is then translocated to specialized [[bundle sheath]] cells where the enzyme [[RuBisCO]] and other Calvin cycle enzymes are located, and where {{co2}} released by [[decarboxylation]] of the four-carbon acids is then fixed by RuBisCO activity to the three-carbon [[3-phosphoglyceric acid]]s. The physical separation of RuBisCO from the oxygen-generating light reactions reduces photorespiration and increases {{co2}} fixation and, thus, the [[photosynthetic capacity]] of the leaf.&lt;ref name="Taiz"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Taiz L, Geiger E |title=Plant Physiology |publisher=[[Sinauer Associates]] |year=2006 |edition=4th |isbn=978-0-87893-856-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{c4}} plants can produce more sugar than {{c3}} plants in conditions of high light and temperature. Many important crop plants are {{c4}} plants, including maize, sorghum, sugarcane, and millet. Plants that do not use PEP-carboxylase in carbon fixation are called [[C3 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants]] because the primary carboxylation reaction, catalyzed by RuBisCO, produces the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acids directly in the Calvin-Benson cycle. Over 90% of plants use {{c3}} carbon fixation, compared to 3% that use {{c4}} carbon fixation;&lt;ref name="sage"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Monson RK, Sage RF |title=C₄ plant biology |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |location=Boston |year=1999 |pages=551–580 |chapter=The Taxonomic Distribution of C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; Photosynthesis |isbn=978-0-12-614440-6 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=H7Wv9ZImW-QC&amp;pg=PA551 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the evolution of {{c4}} in over 60 plant lineages makes it a striking example of [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref name="williamsjohnston"/&gt;

{{Main|CAM photosynthesis}}

[[Xerophytes]], such as [[cacti]] and most [[succulents]], also use PEP carboxylase to capture carbon dioxide in a process called [[CAM photosynthesis|Crassulacean acid metabolism]] (CAM). In contrast to {{c4}} metabolism, which ''spatially'' separates the {{co2}} fixation to PEP from the Calvin cycle, CAM ''temporally'' separates these two processes. CAM plants have a different leaf anatomy from {{c3}} plants, and fix the {{co2}} at night, when their stomata are open. CAM plants store the {{co2}} mostly in the form of [[malic acid]] via carboxylation of [[phosphoenolpyruvate]] to oxaloacetate, which is then reduced to malate. Decarboxylation of malate during the day releases {{co2}} inside the leaves, thus allowing carbon fixation to 3-phosphoglycerate by RuBisCO. Sixteen thousand species of plants use CAM.&lt;ref name="pmid11886877"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dodd AN, Borland AM, Haslam RP, Griffiths H, Maxwell K |title=Crassulacean acid metabolism: plastic, fantastic |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Botany]] |volume=53 |issue=369 |pages=569–80 |date=Apr 2002 |pmid=11886877 |doi=10.1093/jexbot/53.369.569 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In water====
[[Cyanobacteria]] possess [[carboxysome]]s, which increase the concentration of {{co2}} around RuBisCO to increase the rate of photosynthesis. An enzyme, [[carbonic anhydrase]], located within the carboxysome releases CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the dissolved hydrocarbonate ions (HCO{{su|b=3|p=−}}). Before the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; diffuses out it is quickly sponged up by RuBisCO, which is concentrated within the carboxysomes. HCO{{su|b=3|p=−}} ions are made from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; outside the cell by another carbonic anhydrase and are actively pumped into the cell by a membrane protein. They cannot cross the membrane as they are charged, and within the cytosol they turn back into CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; very slowly without the help of carbonic anhydrase. This causes the HCO{{su|b=3|p=−}} ions to accumulate within the cell from where they diffuse into the carboxysomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Badger MR, Price GD |title=CO2 concentrating mechanisms in cyanobacteria: molecular components, their diversity and evolution |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Botany]] |volume=54 |issue=383 |pages=609–22 |date=Feb 2003 |pmid=12554704 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erg076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pyrenoid]]s in [[algae]] and [[hornwort]]s also act to concentrate {{co2}} around rubisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1139/b98-074 |volume=76|issue=6|pages=1052–1071|vauthors=Badger MR, Andrews JT, Whitney SM, Ludwig M, Yellowlees DC, Leggat W, Price GD |title=The diversity and coevolution of Rubisco, plastids, pyrenoids, and chloroplast-based CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-concentrating mechanisms in algae |journal=[[Canadian Journal of Botany]] |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actual plants' photosynthetic efficiency varies with the frequency of the light being converted, light intensity, temperature and proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and can vary from 0.1% to 8%.&lt;ref name="urlWhat is Photosynthesis"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.life.illinois.edu/govindjee/whatisit.htm | title = What is Photosynthesis | vauthors = Govindjee R | website = | publisher = Biology at Illinois }}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, [[photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s convert light into [[electric energy]] at an efficiency of approximately 6–20% for mass-produced panels, and above 40% in laboratory devices.

But analysis of chlorophyll-fluorescence, P700- and P515-absorbance and gas exchange measurements reveal detailed information about e.g. the photosystems, quantum efficiency and the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; assimilation rates.

A phenomenon known as [[quantum walk]] increases the efficiency of the energy transport of light significantly. In the photosynthetic cell of an algae, bacterium, or plant, there are light-sensitive molecules called [[chromophore]]s arranged in an antenna-shaped structure named a photocomplex. When a photon is absorbed by a chromophore, it is converted into a [[quasiparticle]] referred to as an [[exciton]], which jumps from chromophore to chromophore towards the reaction center of the photocomplex, a collection of molecules that traps its energy in a chemical form that makes it accessible for the cell's metabolism. The exciton's wave properties enable it to cover a wider area and try out several possible paths simultaneously, allowing it to instantaneously "choose" the most efficient route, where it will have the highest probability of arriving at its destination in the minimum possible time. Because that quantum walking takes place at temperatures far higher than quantum phenomena usually occur, it is only possible over very short distances, due to obstacles in the form of destructive interference that come into play. These obstacles cause the particle to lose its wave properties for an instant before it regains them once again after it is freed from its locked position through a classic "hop". The movement of the electron towards the photo center is therefore covered in a series of conventional hops and quantum walks.&lt;ref name="urlBBC News - Plants seen doing quantum physics"&gt;{{Cite newspaper | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-22996054 | title = Plants 'seen doing quantum physics' | journal = BBC News | vauthors = Palmer J | date = 21 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlQuantum Biology: Better Living Through Quantum Mechanics - The Nature of Reality"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/physics/2014/03/quantum-life/ | title = Quantum Biology: Better Living Through Quantum Mechanics - The Nature of Reality | vauthors = Lloyd S | date = 10 March 2014 | publisher = Nova: PBS Online, WGBH Boston }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23788794"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hildner R, Brinks D, Nieder JB, Cogdell RJ, van Hulst NF | title = Quantum coherent energy transfer over varying pathways in single light-harvesting complexes | journal = Science | volume = 340 | issue = 6139 | pages = 1448–51 | date = Jun 2013 | pmid = 23788794 | doi = 10.1126/science.1235820 | bibcode = 2013Sci...340.1448H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main source of [[oxygen]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] derives from [[Oxygen evolution|oxygenic photosynthesis]], and its first appearance is sometimes referred to as the [[oxygen catastrophe]]. Geological evidence suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis, such as that in [[cyanobacteria]], became important during the [[Paleoproterozoic]] era around 2 billion years ago. Modern photosynthesis in plants and most photosynthetic prokaryotes is oxygenic. Oxygenic photosynthesis uses water as an electron donor, which is [[Redox|oxidized]] to molecular oxygen ({{chem|O|2}}) in the [[photosynthetic reaction center]].

===Symbiosis and the origin of chloroplasts===
[[File:Plagiomnium affine laminazellen.jpeg|thumb|150px|left|Plant cells with visible chloroplasts (from a moss, ''[[Plagiomnium affine]]'')]]
Several groups of animals have formed [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationships with photosynthetic algae. These are most common in [[coral]]s, [[sponge]]s and [[sea anemone]]s. It is presumed that this is due to the particularly simple [[body plan]]s and large surface areas of these animals compared to their volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Venn AA, Loram JE, Douglas AE | title = Photosynthetic symbioses in animals | journal = Journal of Experimental Botany | volume = 59 | issue = 5 | pages = 1069–80 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18267943 | doi = 10.1093/jxb/erm328 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a few marine [[Mollusca|mollusk]]s ''[[Elysia viridis]]'' and ''[[Elysia chlorotica]]'' also maintain a symbiotic relationship with chloroplasts they capture from the algae in their diet and then store in their bodies. This allows the mollusks to survive solely by photosynthesis for several months at a time.&lt;ref name="pmid10806222"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rumpho ME, Summer EJ, Manhart JR | title = Solar-powered sea slugs.

An even closer form of symbiosis may explain the origin of chloroplasts. Chloroplasts have many similarities with [[cyanobacteria|photosynthetic bacteria]], including a circular [[chromosome]], prokaryotic-type [[ribosome]], and similar proteins in the photosynthetic reaction center.&lt;ref name="pmid9914199"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Douglas SE | title = Plastid evolution: origins, diversity, trends | journal = Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 655–61 | date = Dec 1998 | pmid = 9914199 | doi = 10.1016/S0959-437X(98)80033-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17600460"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reyes-Prieto A, Weber AP, Bhattacharya D | title = The origin and establishment of the plastid in algae and plants | journal = Annual Review of Genetics | volume = 41 | issue =  | pages = 147–68 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17600460 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.41.110306.130134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[endosymbiotic theory]] suggests that photosynthetic bacteria were acquired (by [[endocytosis]]) by early [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells to form the first [[plant]] cells. Therefore, chloroplasts may be photosynthetic bacteria that adapted to life inside plant cells. Like [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]], chloroplasts possess their own DNA, separate from the [[nuclear DNA]] of their plant host cells and the genes in this chloroplast DNA resemble those found in [[cyanobacteria]].&lt;ref name="pmid12620099"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raven JA, Allen JF | title = Genomics and chloroplast evolution: what did cyanobacteria do for plants? | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | page = 209 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12620099 | pmc = 153454 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2003-4-3-209 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA in chloroplasts codes for [[redox]] proteins such as those found in the photosynthetic reaction centers.

===Cyanobacteria and the evolution of photosynthesis===
The biochemical capacity to use water as the source for electrons in photosynthesis evolved once, in a [[Common descent|common ancestor]] of extant [[cyanobacteria]]. The geological record indicates that this transforming event took place early in Earth's history, at least 2450–2320 million years ago (Ma), and, it is speculated, much earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomitani A, Knoll AH, Cavanaugh CM, Ohno T | title = The evolutionary diversification of cyanobacteria: molecular-phylogenetic and paleontological perspectives | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 103 | issue = 14 | pages = 5442–7 | date = Apr 2006 | pmid = 16569695 | pmc = 1459374 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0600999103 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/103/14/5442.abstract | bibcode = 2006PNAS..103.5442T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/bacteria/cyanofr.html |title=Cyanobacteria: Fossil Record |publisher=Ucmp.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Earth's atmosphere contained almost no oxygen during the estimated development of photosynthesis, it is believed that the first photosynthetic cyanobacteria did not generate oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Alison | name-list-format = vanc | title = Plant biology | publisher = Garland Science | location = New York, NY | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0815340256 | page = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Available evidence from geobiological studies of [[Archean]] (&gt;2500 Ma) [[sedimentary rock]]s indicates that life existed 3500 Ma, but the question of when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved is still unanswered.

[[Cyanobacteria]] remained the principal [[primary producers]] of oxygen throughout the [[Proterozoic Eon]] (2500–543 Ma), in part because the redox structure of the oceans favored photoautotrophs capable of [[nitrogen fixation]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} [[Green algae]] joined blue-green algae as the major primary producers of oxygen on [[Continental shelf|continental shelves]] near the end of the [[Proterozoic]], but it was only with the [[Mesozoic]] (251–66 Ma) radiations of dinoflagellates, coccolithophorids, and diatoms did the [[primary production]] of oxygen in marine shelf waters take modern form.

==Discovery==
Although some of the steps in photosynthesis are still not completely understood, the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the 19th century.

[[Jan Baptist van Helmont|Jan van Helmont]] began the research of the process in the mid-17th century when he carefully measured the [[mass]] of the soil used by a plant and the mass of the plant as it grew. After noticing that the soil mass changed very little, he hypothesized that the mass of the growing plant must come from the water, the only substance he added to the potted plant. His hypothesis was partially accurate — much of the gained mass also comes from carbon dioxide as well as water. However, this was a signaling point to the idea that the bulk of a plant's [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] comes from the inputs of photosynthesis, not the soil itself.

[[Joseph Priestley]], a chemist and minister, discovered that, when he isolated a volume of air under an inverted jar, and burned a candle in it (which gave off CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the candle would burn out very quickly, much before it ran out of wax. He further discovered that a mouse could similarly [[Breathing|"injure"]] air. He then showed that the air that had been "injured" by the candle and the mouse could be restored by a plant.

In 1778, [[Jan Ingenhousz]], repeated Priestley's experiments. He discovered that it was the influence of sunlight on the plant that could cause it to revive a mouse in a matter of hours.

In 1796, [[Jean Senebier]], a Swiss pastor, botanist, and naturalist, demonstrated that green plants consume carbon dioxide and release oxygen under the influence of light. Soon afterward, [[Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure]] showed that the increase in mass of the plant as it grows could not be due only to uptake of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but also to the incorporation of water. Thus, the basic reaction by which photosynthesis is used to produce food (such as glucose) was outlined.

[[Cornelis Van Niel]] made key discoveries explaining the chemistry of photosynthesis. By studying [[purple sulfur bacteria]] and green bacteria he was the first to demonstrate that photosynthesis is a light-dependent [[redox]] reaction, in which hydrogen [[Reducing agent|reduces]] (donates its &lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; electron to) carbon dioxide.

[[Robert Emerson (scientist)|Robert Emerson]] discovered two light reactions by testing plant productivity using different wavelengths of light. With the red alone, the light reactions were suppressed. When blue and red were combined, the output was much more substantial. Thus, there were two photosystems, one absorbing up to 600&amp;nbsp;nm wavelengths, the other up to 700&amp;nbsp;nm. The former is known as PSII, the latter is PSI. PSI contains only chlorophyll "a", PSII contains primarily chlorophyll "a" with most of the available chlorophyll "b", among other pigment. These include phycobilins, which are the red and blue pigments of red and blue algae respectively, and fucoxanthol for brown algae and diatoms. The process is most productive when the absorption of quanta are equal in both the PSII and PSI, assuring that input energy from the antenna complex is divided between the PSI and PSII system, which in turn powers the photochemistry.&lt;ref name="ps"/&gt;
[[File:Melvin Calvin.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Melvin Calvin]] works in his photosynthesis laboratory.]]

[[Robin Hill (biochemist)|Robert Hill]] thought that a complex of reactions consisting of an intermediate to cytochrome b&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (now a plastoquinone), another is from cytochrome f to a step in the carbohydrate-generating mechanisms. These are linked by plastoquinone, which does require energy to reduce cytochrome f for it is a sufficient reductant. Further experiments to prove that the oxygen developed during the photosynthesis of green plants came from water, were performed by Hill in 1937 and 1939. He showed that isolated [[chloroplast]]s give off oxygen in the presence of unnatural reducing agents like [[iron]] [[oxalate]], [[ferricyanide]] or [[benzoquinone]] after exposure to light. The Hill reaction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walker DA | title = 'And whose bright presence' - an appreciation of Robert Hill and his reaction | journal = Photosynthesis Research | volume = 73 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 51–4 | year = 2002 | pmid = 16245102 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1023/A:1020479620680 | url = http://www.life.uiuc.edu/govindjee/Part1/Part1_Walker.pdf | authorlink1 = David Alan Walker }}&lt;/ref&gt; is as follows:

:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 A + (light, chloroplasts) → 2 AH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

where A is the electron acceptor. Therefore, in light, the electron acceptor is reduced and oxygen is evolved.

[[Sam Ruben|Samuel Ruben]] and [[Martin Kamen]] used [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotopes]] to determine that the oxygen liberated in photosynthesis came from the water.

[[Melvin Calvin]] and [[Andrew Benson]], along with [[James Bassham]], elucidated the path of carbon assimilation (the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle) in plants. The carbon reduction cycle is known as the [[Calvin cycle]], which ignores the contribution of Bassham and Benson. Many scientists refer to the cycle as the Calvin-Benson Cycle, Benson-Calvin, and some even call it the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (or CBB) Cycle.

[[Nobel Prize]]-winning scientist [[Rudolph A. Marcus]] was able to discover the function and significance of the electron transport chain.

[[Otto Heinrich Warburg]] and [[Dean Burk]] discovered the I-quantum photosynthesis reaction that splits the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, activated by the respiration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1931/warburg.html Otto Warburg – Biography].

In 1950, first experimental evidence for the existence of [[photophosphorylation]] ''in vivo'' was presented by [[Otto Kandler]] using intact ''[[Chlorella]]'' cells and interpreting his findings as light-dependent [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] formation.&lt;ref name="Kandler_1950"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kandler|first=Otto|author-link=Otto Kandler|year=1950|title=Über die Beziehungen zwischen Phosphathaushalt und Photosynthese.

[[Louis N.M. Duysens]] and [[Jan Amesz]] discovered that chlorophyll a will absorb one light, oxidize cytochrome f, chlorophyll a (and other pigments) will absorb another light, but will reduce this same oxidized cytochrome, stating the two light reactions are in series.

===Development of the concept===
In 1893, [[Charles Reid Barnes]] proposed two terms, ''photosyntax'' and ''photosynthesis'', for the biological process of ''synthesis of complex carbon compounds out of carbonic acid, in the presence of chlorophyll, under the influence of light''. Over time, the term ''photosynthesis'' came into common usage as the term of choice. Later discovery of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria and photophosphorylation necessitated redefinition of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gest | first1 = Howard | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2002 | title = History of the word photosynthesis and evolution of its definition | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1020419417954#| journal = Photosynthesis Research | volume = 73 | issue = 1–3| pages = 7–10 | doi=10.1023/A:1020419417954| pmid = 16245098 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===C3 : C4 photosynthesis research===
After   WWII at late 1940 at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the details of photosynthetic carbon metabolism were sorted out by the chemists [[Melvin Calvin]], Andrew Benson, James Bassham and a score of students and researchers utilizing the carbon-14 isotope and paper chromatography techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calvin|first=Melvin| name-list-format = vanc |date=July 1989|title=Forty years of photosynthesis and related activities|url=|journal=Photosynthesis Research|volume=21|issue=1|pages=3–16|doi=10.1007/BF00047170|pmid=24424488|access-date=|doi-broken-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pathway of CO2 fixation by the algae ''Chlorella'' in a fraction of a second in light resulted in a 3 carbon molecule called phosphoglyceric acid (PGA). For that original and ground-breaking work, a [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] was awarded to Melvin Calvin in 1961. In parallel, plant physiologists studied leaf gas exchanges using the new method of infrared gas analysis and a leaf chamber where the net photosynthetic rates ranged from 10 to 13 u mole CO2/square metere.sec., with the conclusion that all terrestrial plants having the same photosynthetic capacities that were light saturated at less than 50% of sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Verduin J | year = 1953 | title = A table of photosynthesis rates under optimal, near natural conditions. | journal = Am.

Later in 1958-1963 at [[Cornell University]], field grown [[maize]] was reported to have much greater leaf photosynthetic rates of 40 u mol CO2/square meter.sec and was not saturated at near full sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hesketh JD, Musgrave R | year = 1962 | title = Photosynthesis under field conditions.

==Factors==

[[File:Leaf 1 web.jpg|thumb|The [[leaf]] is the primary site of photosynthesis in plants.]]
There are three main factors affecting photosynthesis{{Clarify|date=September 2018}} and several corollary factors. The three main are:{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}
*Light [[irradiance]] and [[wavelength]]
*[[Carbon dioxide]] [[concentration]]
*[[Temperature]].

Total photosynthesis is limited by a range of environmental factors. These include the amount of light available, the amount of [[leaf]] area a plant has to capture light (shading by other plants is a major limitation of photosynthesis), rate at which carbon dioxide can be supplied to the [[chloroplast]]s to support photosynthesis, the availability of water, and the availability of suitable temperatures for carrying out photosynthesis.&lt;ref name="Chapin159"&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology | first1 = F.

The '''action spectra''' of chlorophyll molecules are slightly modified ''in vivo'' depending on specific pigment-protein interactions.]]
The process of photosynthesis provides the main input of free energy into the biosphere, and is one of four main ways in which radiation is important for plant life.&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Jones | first1 = Hamlyn G. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Plants and Microclimate: a Quantitative Approach to Environmental Plant Physiology | date = 2014 |publisher=Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | isbn = 978-0-521-27959-8 | edition = Third }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The radiation climate within plant communities is extremely variable, with both time and space.

In the early 20th century, [[Frederick Blackman]] and [[Gabrielle Matthaei]] investigated the effects of light intensity ([[irradiance]]) and temperature on the rate of carbon assimilation.
*At constant temperature, the rate of carbon assimilation varies with irradiance, increasing as the irradiance increases, but reaching a plateau at higher irradiance.
*At low irradiance, increasing the temperature has little influence on the rate of carbon assimilation. At constant high irradiance, the rate of carbon assimilation increases as the temperature is increased.

&lt;!--[[File:carbon a t.jpg|thumb|Carbon assimilation at a constant temperature.]] unsourced graph with swapped axis titles --&gt;
These two experiments illustrate several important points: First, it is known that, in general, [[photochemical]] reactions are not affected by [[temperature]]. However, these experiments clearly show that temperature affects the rate of carbon assimilation, so there must be two sets of reactions in the full process of carbon assimilation. These are the [[Light-dependent reaction|light-dependent 'photochemical']] temperature-independent stage, and the [[Light-independent reaction|light-independent, temperature-dependent]] stage. Second, Blackman's experiments illustrate the concept of [[limiting factor]]s. Another limiting factor is the wavelength of light. Cyanobacteria, which reside several meters underwater, cannot receive the correct wavelengths required to cause photoinduced charge separation in conventional photosynthetic pigments. To combat this problem, a series of proteins with different pigments surround the reaction center. This unit is called a [[phycobilisome]].{{clarify|date=November 2015}}

===Carbon dioxide levels and photorespiration===
[[File:Photorespiration.svg|thumb|350px|Photorespiration]]
As carbon dioxide concentrations rise, the rate at which sugars are made by the [[light-independent reaction]]s increases until limited by other factors. [[RuBisCO]], the enzyme that captures carbon dioxide in the light-independent reactions, has a binding affinity for both carbon dioxide and oxygen. When the concentration of carbon dioxide is high, RuBisCO will [[Carbon fixation|fix carbon dioxide]]. However, if the carbon dioxide concentration is low, RuBisCO will bind oxygen instead of carbon dioxide. This process, called [[photorespiration]], uses energy, but does not produce sugars.

RuBisCO oxygenase activity is disadvantageous to plants for several reasons:
#One product of oxygenase activity is phosphoglycolate (2 carbon) instead of [[3-phosphoglycerate]] (3 carbon). Phosphoglycolate cannot be metabolized by the Calvin-Benson cycle and represents carbon lost from the cycle. A high oxygenase activity, therefore, drains the sugars that are required to recycle ribulose 5-bisphosphate and for the continuation of the [[Calvin-Benson cycle]].
#Phosphoglycolate is quickly metabolized to glycolate that is toxic to a plant at a high concentration; it inhibits photosynthesis.
#Salvaging glycolate is an energetically expensive process that uses the glycolate pathway, and only 75% of the carbon is returned to the Calvin-Benson cycle as 3-phosphoglycerate. The reactions also produce [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which is able to [[Molecular diffusion|diffuse]] out of the plant, leading to a loss of nitrogen.

::A highly simplified summary is:

:::2 glycolate + ATP → 3-phosphoglycerate + carbon dioxide + ADP + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

The salvaging pathway for the products of RuBisCO oxygenase activity is more commonly known as [[photorespiration]], since it is characterized by light-dependent oxygen consumption and the release of carbon dioxide.

A '''religious symbol''' is an iconic representation intended to represent a specific [[religion]], or a specific concept within a given religion.
 
Religious symbols have been used in the military in many different countries, such as the [[United States military chaplain symbols]]. Similarly, the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs emblems for headstones and markers]] recognize 57 symbols (including a number of symbols expressing non-religiosity).

==Symbols representing a specific religion==
&lt;!--symbols representing religions (entire traditions), not specific religious concepts. The references cited must make this clear. E.g. [[Ankh]] is historically not a symbol *of* Egyptian religion, it is a symbol of "life" *within* Egyptian religion; [[Aum]] is not a symbol *of* Hinduism (or wasn't, until the 2000s or so), it is a symbol of the Vedas (or Vedanta, mystic union, etc.).
Make sure to pay attention to this distinction, and make sure that the references cited are unambiguous.
--&gt;
{{synthesis|date=September 2016}}
Symbolic representation of a specific religious tradition is useful in a society with [[religious pluralism]], as was the case in the [[Roman Empire]], and again in modern [[multiculturalism]].

The Christian cross was in use from the time of [[early Christianity]], but it remained less prominent than competing symbols ([[Ichthys]], [[Staurogram]], [[Alpha and Omega]], [[Christogram]], [[Labarum]], etc.) until the medieval [[Crusades]]. Early Christianity had use for such symbols due to the [[persecution of Christians]] in the Roman Empire, as the symbol allowed inconspicuous identification of one Christian to another.

| The syllable "om" or "aum" is first described as all-encompassing mystical entity in the [[Upanishads]]. Hindus believe that as creation began, the divine, all-encompassing consciousness took the form of the first and original vibration manifesting as sound "OM".&lt;ref name=Mahesh&gt;[[Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda]], ''The hidden power in humans'', Ibera Verlag, page 15., {{ISBN|3-85052-197-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before creation began it was "Shunyākāsha", the emptiness or the void. The vibration of "OM" symbolises the manifestation of God in form ("sāguna brahman"). "OM" is the reflection of the absolute reality, it is said to be "Adi Anadi", without beginning or the end and embracing all that exists.&lt;ref name=Mahesh/&gt; The mantra "OM" is the [[name of God]], the vibration of the Supreme. When taken letter by letter, A-U-M represents the divine energy (Shakti) united in its three elementary aspects: Bhrahma Shakti (creation), Vishnu Shakti (preservation) and Shiva Shakti (liberation, and/or destruction).&lt;ref name=Mahesh/&gt;

| The [[star and crescent]] symbol was used as the [[flag of the Ottoman Empire]] from 1844. It was only gradually associated with Islam, in particular due to its ubiquitous use in the decorations of Ottoman mosques in the late 19th century. It was only occasionally adopted as an emblem of Islamic organisations, such as the [[All-India Muslim League]] in 1940 (later becoming the [[Flag of Pakistan]]), and the US American [[Nation of Islam]] in the 1970s.

|The strong tradition of [[aniconism in Islam]] prevented the development of symbols for the religion until recently (other than single-coloured flags, see [[Green in Islam]], [[Black Standard]]). The lack of a symbol representing Islam as a religion paired with the desire to come up with [[national flag]]s for the newly formed [[Islamism|Islamist]] states of the 1970s led to the adoption of written text expressing core concepts in such flags: the [[shahada]] in the [[flag of Saudi Arabia]] (1973). The [[Flag of Iraq]] (2008) and the [[Flag of Iran]] (1979) has the [[takbir]].

===Traditional African religions===
{{main|Traditional African religions}}
{{See also|Afro-American religion}}
In many Traditional African religions, there are no graphical or pictorial symbols representing the actual religion or faith. Each tradition however, has symbolisms which are religious or spiritual in nature. Some of these may be graphical, numerological (as in Serer numerology - see [[Serer creation myth]]) or a  combination of both. However, these graphical images do not represent the actual faith, but elements within the faith. 
The very nature of [[African art]] stem from "their themes of symbolism, functionalism and utilitarianism" hence why African art is multi-functional. In the traditional African belief system, Africans draw from their various artistic traditions as sources of inspiration. "These images have religio-metaphysical themes, which serve as the focal point of power, which links the African’s physical world to his beliefs on his essence and existence. Indeed the African art reflect images of ancestral spirits, and pantheons of indigenous gods and goddesses."&lt;ref&gt;Omatseye, B. O. J; Emeriewen, Kingsley Osevwiyo, ''An Appraisal of Religious Art and Symbolic Beliefs in the Traditional African Context (p. 529-544)'' [in] African Research Review, p. 529-30  [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d56c/e656c8bf5e5d418d40aa7dc17dc589fe2806.pdf] (International Association of African Researchers and Reviewers (IAARR)  [http://afrrevjo.net/])&lt;/ref&gt;

| Yoonir is a religious symbolism in the traditional faith of the [[Serer people]]. It symbolizes the universe as well as the Serer people. In the Serer worldview, it represents good fortune and destiny and was used by Serer illiterates to sign their names. The peak of the star represents the Deity [[Roog]]. The other four points represent the cardinal points of the Universe. The crossing of the lines pinpoints the axis of the Universe, that all energies pass. The top point is "the point of departure and conclusion, the origin and the end".&lt;ref&gt;Madiya, Clémentine Faïk-Nzuji, ''Canadian Museum of Civilization'', Canadian Centre for Folk Culture Studies, ''International Centre for African Language, Literature and Tradition'', (Louvain, Belgium), p. 27, 155, {{ISBN|0-660-15965-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]], ''La civilisation sereer,'' vol.

The '''Remote Automatic Weather Stations''' ('''RAWS''') system is a network of [[Automatic weather station|automated]] [[weather station]]s run by the [[U.S. Forest Service]] (USFS) and [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) and monitored by the [[National Interagency Fire Center]] (NIFC), mainly to observe potential [[wildfire]] conditions.  

Unlike the [[automated airport weather station]]s which are located at significant [[airport]]s, RAWS stations are often located in remote areas, particularly in [[United States National Forest|national forest]]s. Because of this, they usually are not connected to the [[electrical grid]], but rather have their own [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s, and a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] to store power for overnight reporting. Some instead run on a [[Electrical generator|generator]]. In both cases, data important to operating the station itself, such as battery [[voltage]] or [[fuel]] level, is often included in the hourly reports.

Also because of the remote locations, most communicate with a [[modem]] via [[telephone]], or via a [[Very-small-aperture terminal|VSAT]] connection to a [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite|GOES]] [[satellite]].

In this regard, they are similar to [[mesonet]]s and may be mesonets if the distance between stations (spatial resolution) is sufficiently dense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Zachariassen |first = John |author2 = K.

==Portable RAWS==
There are times when a portable weather station is required, such as planned ignitions, wildfires, and other projects where there is a need to collect and share weather information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Henry|first=Bryan|title=FIRE WEATHER STATION STANDARDS &amp; GUIDELINES|url=http://raws.fam.nwcg.gov/nfdrs.html|work=National Interagency Fire Center|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[FTS_-_Forest_Technology_Systems_LTD#Portable_RAWS|Portable]] stations may also be referred to as "quick deploy" or QD, and this should be indicated within the name of the station to allow proper interpretation of the collected data.

He graduated from the [[ETH Zürich]] in the late 1940s with a thesis titled: “Der Lias der Glarner Alpen”. From 1947 to 1953 he spent his post-doctoral years in [[Lausanne]] before being appointed professor at ETH Zürich in 1953. He would remain there until 1986.

His research mainly concentrated on [[alpine geology]]. However, he also published papers on extra-alpine regions like [[Greenland]], the [[Montagne Noire]] and the [[Sahara]].  He was the author of the reference book ''Geology of Switzerland''.

Trümpy is the recipient of numerous awards and prizes including the [[Wollaston Medal]]&lt;ref name="Wollaston"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/gsl/info/collections/archives/page750.html|title=Wollaston Medal|publisher=[[Geological Society of London]]|accessdate=2009-02-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124005509/http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/gsl/info/collections/archives/page750.html|archivedate=2009-01-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Penrose Medal]].&lt;ref name="Penrose"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geosociety.org/awards/past.htm#penrose|title=Past Award &amp; Medal Recipients - Penrose Medal|publisher=[[Geological Society of America]]|accessdate=2009-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 he was elected a Foreign Associate of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name="NAS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/site/Dir/1589208854?pg=vprof&amp;mbr=1005562&amp;returl=http://www.nasonline.org/site/Dir/1589208854%3Fpg%3Dsrch%26view%3Dbasic&amp;retmk=search_again_link|title=Trumpy, D.

Many stratigraphic formations in the western Alps were first described by Trümpy. For example, the [[Couches de l’Aroley Formation|Couches de l’Aroley]], the [[Couches des Marmontains Formation|Couches des Marmontains]] and the [[Couches de St-Cristoph Formation|Couches de St Cristoph]].&lt;ref name=stratigraphie.ch&gt;{{cite web|title=Lithostratigraphisches Lexikon der Schweiz|url=http://www.stratigraphie.ch/?page=strat&amp;strat=Penninikum_W|work=Penninikum|publisher=stratigraphie.ch|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SPHEREx''' ('''Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer''') is a proposed [[Infrared astronomy|near-infrared]] [[space observatory]] that would perform an all-sky survey to measure the [[near-infrared]] spectra of approximately 450 million galaxies.  SPHEREx is competing for selection by NASA for its next [[Explorers program#Medium-Class Explorers|Medium-Class Explorers]] mission, which will take place in 2019. The other two competing mission concepts are ''[[Arcus (satellite)|Arcus]]'', and  [[FINESSE]].&lt;ref name='Proposals 2017'&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-proposals-to-study-galaxies-stars-planets NASA Selects Proposals to Study Galaxies, Stars, Planets]. Katherine Brown, NASA News. 9 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; If selected and built, the launch date would be no earlier than 2022. The Principal Investigator is James Bock at [[Caltech]] in Pasadena, California.

==Overview==

SPHEREx would use a [[spectrophotometer]] to perform an all-sky survey that would measure [[near-infrared]] spectra from 0.75 to 5.0 micrometers. It employs a simple instrument with a single observing mode to map the entire sky four times during its nominal 25-month mission. &lt;ref name='SPHEREx science'&gt; [http://spherex.caltech.edu/Science.html SPHEREx Science].

'''Tier One''' was a [[Scaled Composites]]' 1990s–2004 program of [[suborbital]] [[human spaceflight]] using the [[Reusable launch system|reusable spacecraft]] [[Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne|SpaceShipOne]] and its launcher [[Scaled Composites White Knight|White Knight]]. The craft was designed by [[Burt Rutan]], and the project was funded 20 million US Dollars by [[Paul Allen]].  In 2004 it made the [[SpaceShipOne flight 15P|first privately funded human spaceflight]] and won the 10 million US Dollars [[Ansari X Prize]] for the first non-governmental reusable manned spacecraft.

The objective of the project was to develop technology for low-cost routine access to space.  SpaceShipOne was not itself intended to carry paying passengers, but was envisioned that there would be commercial spinoffs, initially in [[space tourism]].  The company [[Mojave Aerospace Ventures]] was formed{{when|date=August 2015}} to manage commercial exploitation of the technology.  A deal{{clarify|date=August 2015}} with [[Virgin Galactic]] could see routine space tourism in the late 2010s using a spacecraft based on Tier One technology.{{update after|2015|8|17}}&lt;!-- perhaps the SS2/WK2, Virgin/Scaled/MAV project deserves a summary high-level mention here?, as clearly Tier One, as a program by Scaled, did have post-project aspirations. --&gt;

==Design==

===Program Components===
The design concept of Tier One was to [[air launch]] a three-person piloted spacecraft which climbs to slightly above {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} altitude using a [[hybrid rocket]] motor and then glides to the ground and lands horizontally.  Scaled Composites lists the following components of the program:
*launch aircraft ([[Scaled Composites White Knight|White Knight]])
*three-seater human-rated spacecraft ([[SpaceShipOne]])
*[[hybrid rocket]] propulsion system
*mobile propulsion test facility
*[[flight simulator]]
*inertial-nav flight director
*mobile [[mission control]] center
*spacecraft systems
*[[pilot (spaceflight)|pilot]] training program
*flight test program

===Vehicle===
Details on the SpaceShipOne vehicle itself can be found in the [[SpaceShipOne]] article, and details on the White Knight carrier aircraft can be found on the [[Scaled Composites White Knight]] article.

===Mission control===
In addition to an office-based mission control, Tier One has a mobile [[mission control]] center.  This is relatively small, built into a large road-going truck.  It bears the Scaled Composites logo, but no other overt indication of its link to Tier One.  The vehicle performs a combination of support functions:
*[[telemetry]] monitoring and recording
*telecommunications
*auxiliary environment control for White Knight and SpaceShipOne

This control center is used to support both rocket motor ground tests and all flight tests of White Knight and SpaceShipOne.  Its primary function is to monitor and record test data, and to this end it is equipped with computers and radio communication gear.  SpaceShipOne's [[avionics]] displays are duplicated in mission control.  Telemetry data is received on a '''Data Reduction System''' ('''DRS'''), which automatically directs [[antenna (radio)|radio antennas]] to point at the craft being monitored.  The telemetry system has a range of about {{convert|280|km|abbr=on}}.

The control center is equipped to communicate with Scaled Composites' offices, as well as the aircraft and spacecraft.

The control center maintains a temperature-controlled atmosphere for its staff, and can be hooked up to provide temperature control for the White Knight and SpaceShipOne cabins.  The physical structure of mission control also provides easier access to the White Knight cabin.

===Nitrous oxide delivery===
Unlike the solid fuel, the [[nitrous oxide]] [[oxidiser]] is handled as a bulk commodity and pumped into the spacecraft's oxidiser tank in the field.  Tier One therefore has a mobile delivery system for nitrous oxide, which they call '''MONODS''' ('''mo'''bile '''n'''itrous '''o'''xide '''d'''elivery '''s'''ystem).

MONODS is built on an open trailer, which can be carried by road in conventional manner.  It consists principally of a {{convert|6.5|m3|abbr=on}} tank, a temperature control unit, and a generator to power the temperature control unit.  The nitrous oxide is stored at room temperature, at a pressure of {{convert|4.8|MPa|abbr=on}}.

MONODS is refilled from a commercial supplier, which uses {{convert|50|m3|abbr=on|adj=on|sp=us}} tankers and delivers the nitrous oxide at about {{convert|-17|°C|abbr=on|lk=in}} and {{convert|2|MPa|abbr=on}}.  MONODS heats the nitrous oxide to room temperature, increasing its pressure.

===Propulsion testing===
Tier One has a mobile thrust test stand, known as the '''Test Stand Trailer''' ('''TST''').  The advantage of making it mobile is that all the mounting and instrumentation work can be done in the hangar, so that at the test site all that needs to be done is to fill the oxidiser tank (from MONODS) and conduct the firing.

The test stand replicates the essential structural components of the spacecraft.  It has an oxidiser tank and associated fittings identical to the one used in flight.  This means that the motor test also automatically performs appropriate [[oscillation|vibration]], [[stress (physics)|stress]], and [[heat]] tests of the spacecraft structure.  The crew cabin, however, is not replicated.

For ground-based thrust tests, a rocket [[nozzle]] with an expansion ratio of 10:1 is used, differing from the 25:1 nozzle used at altitude during actual flight.

The test stand is instrumented to record not only thrust but also side force and temperature and strain experienced by components.  Data is recorded on a computer in a bunker at the test site.  The data acquisition computer is remotely controlled from mission control.

===Flight simulator===
The SpaceShipOne [[flight simulator]] consists of a simulator program and a cockpit.

The flight simulator program aims to accurately simulate SpaceShipOne's behaviour under any circumstances and in all phases of flight.  Rather than having a model of SpaceShipOne's overall flight behaviour, it uses [[computational fluid dynamics]] to model the air around the craft.  It calculates the [[aerodynamic]] and other forces operating on the craft, taking into account the positions of its control surfaces.  This simulation is based on the computer modelling that was used during the design process and refined using data from flight tests.  This yields a highly accurate image of craft behaviour, even in unanticipated modes of flight.  (This is one of the first modern aircraft to be designed without [[wind tunnel]] testing.)

The [[simpit|cockpit replica]] is on a static base, and so cannot accurately reproduce the [[equilibrioceptive]] and [[accelerative]] aspects of flight.  However, White Knight is equipped to operate as a high-fidelity moving-base simulator; see White Knight's section above.  The simulator cockpit is an accurate copy of the SpaceShipOne cabin, including its [[avionics]].  It is the system of pilot plus avionics, not just the pilot, that is being simulated to.  The flight simulator program drives the sensor inputs that are used by the avionics, and also drives twelve display computers which use commercial graphics software to generate high-resolution images of the outside view for the pilot.  These views appear on eleven monitors and one projector screen.  Stick force feedback is not simulated in real time.

Ground-based flight simulation is not only used for pilot training.  It is also used to train ground crew, develop procedures, and test the [[avionics software]] and hardware.

==History and status==
According to Scaled Composites, the concept for the program originated in April 1996, preliminary development began in 1999, and full development began in April 2001.  It was initially kept secret, even after [[Scaled Composites White Knight|White Knight]] first flew on August 1, 2002.  The program was announced to the public on April 18, 2003, when the program was ready to flight-test [[SpaceShipOne]].  Its first flight test, [[SpaceShipOne flight 01C]], took place on May 20, 2003.

After months of glide tests, the first powered flight, [[SpaceShipOne flight 11P]], was made on December 17, 2003.  Further powered tests followed, reaching increasing altitudes, culminating on June 21, 2004 with the first privately funded human spaceflight, [[SpaceShipOne flight 15P]].  [[Ansari X Prize]] competitive flights followed.  [[SpaceShipOne flight 16P]] on September 29, 2004 and [[SpaceShipOne flight 17P]] on October 4, 2004 were successful competitive flights, winning the X Prize.
&lt;!-- The program will continue making test flights, to develop the technology further, in support of the development of successor spacecraft such as the [[Virgin SpaceShip]]. The program has ruled out carrying scientific payloads, despite several requests. [NO, THE TIER ONE PROGRAM, RAN BY SCALED COMPOSITES ENDED after the retirement of SS1.  SCALED DID HAVE, AT ONE TIME, A TIER TWO PROGRAM, BUT EVEN THAT SEEMS TO NO LONGER EXIST SINCE ALL SPACESHIPTWO/WHITEKNIGHTTWO DEVELOPMENT HAS TRANSITIONED TO VIRGIN GALACTIC, A DIFFERENT COMPANY, FORMERLY THE "LAUNCH CUSTOMER" FOR SS2. (by early 2015)--&gt;

The Tier One program run by Scaled Composites concluded after the retirement of SpaceShipOne, transitioning to a successor program for customer [[Virgin Galactic]].

==Funding==

The costs of development, construction, and operation of Tier One, although not publicly released, are estimated to be in the range of 20 million to 30 million [[US dollar]]s, roughly two to three times the value of the [[Ansari X Prize]] award.  The sole sponsor, initially secret, was revealed to be [[Paul Allen]], a co-founder of [[Microsoft]] and the 48th richest person in the world.  The revelation, on December 17, 2003, the same day as the program's first powered flight test, followed speculation that Allen was involved.

Some commentators have drawn comparisons between the relative inexpense of the Tier One program and the high cost of the [[Space Shuttle]] program, though the technological difficulties of the two programs are completely different.  SpaceShipOne, because it flies suborbitally, does not need to reach the high speeds of the Space Shuttle ([[Mach number|Mach]] 3 vs. Mach 25), nor the same altitude ({{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} suborbital vs. {{convert|400|km|abbr=on|adj=on|sp=us}} orbit).  SpaceShipOne also does not carry the same crew (3 members vs. 7) or payload (negligible vs. 25 tons), and makes much shorter flights (a few minutes vs. several days).  The SpaceShipOne program is a technical achievement more on a par with the [[North American X-15|X-15]] than the Shuttle.

Inflation adjusted comparisons of the SpaceShipOne program with that of the X-15 budget, indicate that the Tier One program cost 1/100th that of the X-15 program, although the three X-15 aircraft made almost 200 test flights in their entire test program, typically exploring hypersonic flight between mach 4-7. Only a few dozen X-15 flights specifically sought to reach peak altitudes rather than achieve top speeds, though only two flights ever reached altitudes near those achieved by SpaceShipOne. On the other hand, the Tier One project also paid for construction of the White Knight mothership within its budget, while NASA had nearly free use of a pre-existing USAF [[B-52]] bomber modified to perform drop tests of experimental aircraft of many kinds (currently in use for PegasusXL launches).

==Publicity==
Tier One was initially developed secretly, as is Scaled Composites' policy with new programs.  On April 18, 2003 the program was publicly announced, and SpaceShipOne and White Knight were demonstrated to the media at a rollout attended by between 550 and 600 people.  Media interest was so intense that what had been intended as a Family and Friends Day on April 24, 2003 was turned into a second media day.

Scaled Composites again courted publicity by announcing in advance the final test flight, [[SpaceShipOne flight 15P]], intended to be the program's first spaceflight.  About 11,000 people went to [[Mojave Spaceport]] to watch the flight, which was also [[television|televised]].  The flight was run as an [[airshow]], with both the principal craft and the [[chase plane]]s making takeoffs and landings in front of the crowd, and celebratory flybys when the test succeeded.  The flight was not only a technical success but also a popular success, stimulating intense public interest in spaceflight.

==Future==
During an interview in the documentary [[Black Sky: The Race For Space]], Rutan stated that Tier One will cover suborbital flights, [[Scaled Composites Tier Two|Tier Two]] will cover orbital flights, and Tier Three will cover flights beyond Earth's orbit (including flights to the moon and other planets). In the same documentary he displayed designs for an orbital craft based on SpaceShipOne, which had a rocket roughly twice SpaceShipOne's length mounted to the ship's rear.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Commercial aspects==
{{Main|Mojave Aerospace Ventures}}
The stated objective of the Tier One program is to demonstrate suborbital human spaceflight operations at low cost.  Before Burt Rutan began considering this project, there were three major barriers to the goal of affordable suborbital spaceflight:
#the dangers and costs of liquid propulsion fuels (they explode);
#the uncontrollable nature of solid fuel rocket motors (you can't turn them off);
#the difficulties in getting back without burning up in the atmosphere.

Tier One itself is not intended to carry paying passengers, and US Government permits would be required if it did intend to do so.  It is a technology testbed, and it is expressly intended that the technology developed in the program will later be used in commercial spaceflights.  To that end, Paul Allen and Burt Rutan created a company, [[Mojave Aerospace Ventures]], which owns the project's [[intellectual property]] and will manage all commercial exploitation of it.

Scaled Composites initially expressed a hope that by about 2013 it would be possible for members of the public to experience a suborbital flight for about the price of a luxury cruise.  On September 25, 2004 a deal was struck with [[Virgin Galactic]] to develop the [[Virgin SpaceShip]] based on a scaled-up version of SpaceShipOne. These spacecraft will be built by [[The Spaceship Company]].

A '''shark tunnel''' (or '''aquarium tunnel''' or '''acrylic tunnel''' or '''exhibit tunnel''') is an underwater [[tunnel]] that passes through an [[aquarium]], typically with [[shark]]s and related aquatic life.
They are usually made of thick [[acrylic glass]].

Most aquarium tunnels are cylindrical in shape, though tunnels can be made elliptical (to make them wider and still keep the top of the tunnel closer to the visitors), or even square.&lt;ref name="shapes"/&gt;

'''Siegfried Samuel Marcus''' (18 September 1831&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1 July 1898) was a German inventor. Marcus was born of [[Jewish]] descent in [[Malchin]], in the [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]].  He made several petrol-powered vehicles, the first one in 1864, while living in Vienna, Austria.&lt;ref name="ASME"/&gt;

==Life==
[[Image:Wiener Zünder.jpg|thumb|left|Blasting machine, "Wiener Zünder" ''(Viennese Igniter)'', 1864]]
Marcus was born in [[Malchin]], in the [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] into a Jewish family. Today Malchin is part of Germany. He began work at age 12 as an apprentice mechanic. At 17 he joined Siemens and Halske, an engineering company that built telegraph lines. He moved to [[Vienna]], the capital of the [[Austrian Empire]], in 1852, working first as a technician in the Physical Institute of the Medical School. He then worked as an assistant to Professor [[Carl Ludwig]], a physiologist. In 1860 Marcus opened his own workshop which made mechanical and electrical equipment.&lt;ref name="ASME"/&gt; The first was located at Mariahilferstrasse 107 and the second at Mondscheingasse 4.

His chief improvements include [[telegraph]] relay system and ignition devices such as the "Wiener Zünder", a [[blasting machine]]. Marcus was buried at the [[Protestant]] Cemetery at [[Hütteldorf]], Vienna. Later, his remains were transferred to an "Honorary Tomb" of Vienna's [[Zentralfriedhof|Central Cemetery]].

==Nazi rewrite==
[[File:GuentherZ 2007-04-27 2771 Wien04 Karlsplatz Siegfried Marcus.jpg|upright=0.6|thumb|Monument at Vienna Technical Museum]]
Because of Marcus' Jewish ancestry, his name and all memorabilia, particularly in Austria, vanished under the [[Nazism|Nazis]]. In 1937 the Austrian Harand Movement Against Racial Hatred had issued a series of stamps featuring prominent Jews, including Marcus, who had contributed to mankind in response to the ''Ewige Jew'' (eternal Jew) exhibition by [[Julius Streicher]] in Munich. Marcus was credited as having invented the petrol driven motor car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Philosemitic Aryans |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=30 November 1937 |issue=25742 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Anschluss|German occupation of Austria]] in March 1938, the [[memorial]] in front of the [[TU Wien|Vienna Technical University]] was removed. After World War II, the monument was rebuilt and his car, which had been hidden, was returned to display.

Marcus was removed from German encyclopedias as the inventor of the modern car, under a directive from the [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|German Ministry for Propaganda]] during [[World War II]]. His name was replaced with the names of [[Gottlieb Daimler|Daimler]] and [[Karl Benz|Benz]]. The directive (in German) read as follows:

Current Austrian thinking is that Marcus' first car ran in the late 1880s.&lt;ref name=TMV&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technischesmuseum.at/object/marcus-wagen-1888-1889 |title=Marcus-Wagen, 1888/1889 |first=Anne-Katrin |last=Ebert |publisher=Vienna Technical Museum |access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, early publications suggest that he may have had a petrol powered vehicle running earlier than 1870.&lt;ref name=Progress&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/periodicals/P19070301.2.15?query=motor |title=Motor Notes.

==Marcus' cars==
[[File:MW1 signiert klein.jpg|thumb|upright|Marcus cart of 1870]]
[[Image:MW2 05 02 24 klein.jpg|thumb|Marcus Car of 1888&lt;ref name=TMV/&gt;]]

Based on the information from existing sources, Marcus' first machine was built on a simple handcart in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;handritten notes of Marcus himself on the photo&lt;/ref&gt; but had to be started by lifting the drive wheels off the ground and spinning them. The [[internal combustion engine]] was designed for liquid combustibles and made him the first to propel a vehicle by means of petrol. Marcus was not satisfied with this cart and dismantled it.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;

In 1883 a patent for a low-voltage [[ignition magneto]] was given to Marcus in Germany and a new petrol engine built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/156028394/?terms=%22siegfried%2Bmarcus%22%2Bvienna |title=Ignition |newspaper=The Record-Union
|location=Sacramento, California |date=13 December 1884 |page=7 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This design was used for all further engines, including that of the only existing Marcus car from 1888–1889. It was this ignition, in conjunction with the "rotating brush [[carburettor]]", that made the engine's design very innovative. By 1886 the German navy was using the engine in its torpedo boats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/search/#query=%22Siegfried+Marcus%22&amp;dr_year=1860-1895 |title=Austro-Hungary |newspaper=[[The Times]]
|location=London |date=16 November 1886 |page=5 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, Marcus started a co-operation with the [[Moravia]]n company Märky, Bromovsky &amp; Schulz. They offered two stroke and — after the fall of the [[Nikolaus Otto|Otto]]-Patent in 1886 — four stroke engines of the Marcus type.

In 1888-1889 Märky, Bromovsky &amp; Schulz built the car which can still be seen in [[Technisches Museum Wien|Vienna's Technical Museum]]. This car made Marcus well-known all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |trans-title=Austria Lexicon |volume=2 |location=Vienna |year=2004 |title=Österreich Lexikon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car was named a [[List of historic mechanical engineering landmarks|Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark]] by the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]].&lt;ref name="ASME"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.asme.org/about-asme/who-we-are/engineering-history/landmarks/203-siegfried-marcus-car |title=Siegfried Marcus Car (ca. 1875) |accessdate=2016-09-22 |work=Landmarks |publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers}} Note: ASME gives an incorrect construction date of 1875.{{What?|reason=If two sources disagree, the article should just tell us what they disagree about. |date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Nixon of the London Times in 1938 considered Marcus' development of the motor car to have been experimental, as opposed to Benz who took the concept from experimental to production. Nixon described Marcus' cars as impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The First Motor Car |first=John C. |last=Nixon |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=29 March 1938 |issue=47955 |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; 12 years later, in 1950, the Times described the car at the Vienna Technical Museum as being built in 1875 and the first petrol-powered road vehicle. A description of its first journey of 7.5 miles from Vienna to [[Klosterneuburg|Klosterneuberg]] was included in the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=1875 Motor-Car Driven Again |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=17 April 1950 |issue=51667 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patents==
Marcus was the holder of 131 [[patent]]s in 16 countries. He never applied for a patent for the motorcar and, of course, he never held one. Nevertheless, he was the first to use [[petrol]] to propel a [[vehicle]], in the simple handcart of 1864, but it is uncertain whether the extant Marcus car ran before 1890.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016|reason=statement about 1890 contradicts most sources}}

Some examples of his patents:

In conjunction with Captain E von Wohlgemuth of the Imperial German Navy, Marcus invented an electrical ignition of ships cannons. The advantages of the system were that it allowed for the simultaneous firing of the cannons, or selection of a particular firing pattern, and the ability to fire them from the ship's bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Electrical discharge of artillery on board men-of-war |journal=Telegraphic Journal and Electrical Review |volume=16 |date=16 May 1885 |pages=442–443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms '''signified and signifier''' are most commonly related to [[semiotics]], which is defined by [[Oxford Dictionaries Online]] as "the study of signs and symbols and their use or interpretation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Oxforddictionaries.com]]|title=definition of semiotics|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/semiotics?q=semiotic#semiotics__8 |accessdate= 18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], a Swiss linguist, was one of the two founders of semiotics. His book, ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'' "is considered to be one of the most influential books published in the twentieth century".&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 2013, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Saussure explained that a sign was not only a sound-image but also a concept. Thus he divided the sign into two components: the signifier (or "sound-image") and the signified (or "concept").&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 2012, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; For Saussure, the signified and signifier were purely psychological; they were form rather than substance. Today, following [[Louis_Hjelmslev|Hjelmslev]], the signifier is interpreted as the material form (something which can be seen, heard, touched, smelled or tasted) and the signified as the mental concept.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, 2017, pp.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of signs has been around for a long time, having been studied by many philosophers who include [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Augustine]], and others from the medieval period such as [[William of Ockham]]. The term "semiotics" "comes from the Greek root, seme, as in semeiotikos, an interpreter of signs".&lt;ref&gt;Cobley &amp; Jansz, 1997, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until the 20th century, however, that Saussure and American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] brought the term into awareness. While both Saussure and Peirce contributed greatly to the concept of signs, it is important to note that each differed in their approach to the study, and it was Saussure who created the terms signifier and signified in order to break down what a sign was.

Succeeding these founders were numerous philosophers and linguists who defined themselves as semioticians. These semioticians have each brought their own concerns to the study of signs. [[Umberto Eco]] (1976), a distinguished Italian semiotician, came to the conclusion that "if signs can be used to tell the truth, they can also be used to lie".&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 2012, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodernist social theorist [[Jean Baudrillard]] spoke of hyperreality, which referred to a copy becoming more real than reality. In other words, how the signified becomes more important than the signifier . Then French semiotician [[Roland Barthes]] used signs to explain the concept of connotation – cultural meanings attached to words – and denotation – literal or explicit meanings of words.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Without Saussure's breakdown of signs into signified and signifier, however, these semioticians would not have had anything to base their concepts on.

==About==
Today, "contemporary commentators tend to describe the signifier as the form that the sign takes and the signified as the concept to which it refers".&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, 2002, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between the signifier and signified is an arbitrary relationship. In other words, "there is no logical connection" between them.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 2012, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from a symbol, which is "never wholly arbitrary".&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 2012, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that both the signifier and the signified are inseparable is explained by Saussure's diagram, which shows how both components coincide to create the sign.

So the question is, how do signifiers create meaning and how do we know what that meaning is? In order to understand how the signifier and signified relate to each other, one must be able to interpret signs. "The only reason that the signifier does entail the signified is because there is a conventional relationship at play".&lt;ref&gt;Cobley &amp; Jansz, 1997, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, a sign can only be understood when the relationship between the two components that make up the sign are agreed upon. Saussure argued that a sign's "meaning depends on its relation to other words within the system" (for example, to understand an individual word such as "tree", one must also understand the word "bush" and how the two relate to each other).&lt;ref&gt; Chandler, 2002, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; It is this difference from other signs that allows the possibility of a speech community.&lt;ref&gt; Cobley &amp; Jansz, 1997, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; However we need to remember that signifiers and their significance change all the time, becoming "dated". It is in this way that we are all "practicing semioticians who pay a great deal of attention to signs… even though we may never have heard them before"&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 2012, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; And while words are the most familiar form signs take, they stand for many things within life, such as advertisement, objects, body language, music, and so on. Therefore the use of signs, and the two components that make up a sign, can be and are – whether consciously or not – applied to everyday life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3778">A '''spring scale''' or '''spring balance''' or '''newton meter''' is a type of [[weighing scale]]. It consists of [[Spring (device)|spring]] fixed at one end with a hook to attach an object at the other.  It works by [[Hooke's Law]], which states that the force needed to extend a spring is proportional to the distance that spring is extended from its rest position. Therefore, the scale markings on the spring balance are equally spaced. A spring scale cannot measure [[mass]], only [[weight]].

A spring balance can be calibrated for the accurate measurement of mass in the location in which they are used, but many spring balances are marked right on their face "Not Legal for Trade" or words of similar import due to the approximate nature of the theory used to mark the scale.  Also, the spring in the scale can permanently stretch with repeated use.

A spring scale will only read correctly in a frame of reference where the acceleration in the spring axis is constant (such as on earth, where the acceleration is due to gravity).  This can be shown by taking a spring scale into an [[elevator]], where the weight measured will change as the elevator moves up and down changing velocities.

If two or more spring balances are hung one below the other in series, each of the scales will read approximately the same, the full weight of the body hung on the lower scale. The scale on top would read slightly heavier due to also supporting the weight of the lower scale itself.

Spring balances come in different sizes. Generally, small scales that measure newtons will have a less firm spring (one with a smaller [[spring constant]]) than larger ones that measure tens, hundreds or thousands of newtons or even more depending on the scale of newtons used. The largest spring scale ranged in measurement from 5000–8000 newtons.

A spring balance may be labeled in both units of force (pounds, liters) and mass (grams, kilograms). Strictly speaking, only the force values are correctly labeled. In order to infer that the labeled mass values are correct, an object must be hung from the spring balance at rest in an inertial reference frame, interacting with no other objects but the scale itself

==Uses==
[[File:Spiral Balancer 001.JPG|thumb|Example of [[spiral balancer]] for [[Sash window]]]]
Main uses of spring balances are to weigh heavy loads such as [[truck]]s, [[storage silo]]s, and material carried on a [[conveyor belt]]. They are also common in science education as basic accelerators. They are used when the accuracy afforded by other types of [[Weighing scale|scales]] can be sacrificed for simplicity, cheapness, and robustness.

A spring balance measures the weight of an object by opposing the force of gravity acting with the force of an extended spring.

==History==
The first spring balance in Britain was made around 1770 by [[Richard Salter (inventor)|Richard Salter]] of [[Bilston]], near [[Wolverhampton]].&lt;ref name="Hewison, p18" &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his nephews John &amp; George founded the firm of ''George Salter &amp; Co.'', still notable makers of scales and balances, who in 1838 patented the spring balance. They also applied the same spring balance principle to steam locomotive [[safety valve]]s, replacing the earlier deadweight valves.&lt;ref name="Hewison, p18" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6433">In [[mathematical physics]], a '''super Virasoro algebra''' is an [[Lie algebra extension|extension]] of the [[Virasoro algebra]] to a [[Lie superalgebra]]. There are two extensions with particular importance in [[superstring theory]]: the '''Ramond algebra'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (named after [[Pierre Ramond]])&lt;ref&gt;P. Ramond (1971), "Dual Theory for Free Fermions," ''Phys. Rev.'', '''D3''', 2415.&lt;/ref&gt;  and the '''Neveu–Schwarz algebra'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (named after [[André Neveu]] and [[John Henry Schwarz]]).&lt;ref&gt;Neveu, A., Schwarz, J. (1971). "Tachyon-free dual model with a positive-intercept trajectory." ''Physics Letters'', '''34B''', 517–518.&lt;/ref&gt; Both algebras have [[supersymmetry algebra|''N''=1 supersymmetry]] and an even part given by the Virasoro algebra. They describe the symmetries of a superstring in two different sectors, called the '''Ramond sector'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; and the '''Neveu–Schwarz sector'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.

==The ''N'' = 1 super Virasoro algebras==

There are two minimal extensions of the Virasoro algebra with ''N'' = 1 supersymmetry: the Ramond algebra and the Neveu–Schwarz algebra. They are both Lie superalgebras whose even part is the Virasoro algebra: this Lie algebra has a basis consisting of a [[Center (algebra)|central element]] ''C'' and [[Lie algebra#Generators and dimension|generators]] ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; (for integer ''m'') satisfying

&lt;math&gt;[ L_m , L_n ] = ( m - n ) L_{m+n} + \frac{c}{12} m ( m^2 - 1 ) \delta_{m+n,0} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]]. 

The odd part of the algebra has basis &lt;math&gt;G_r&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is either an integer (the Ramond case), or half an odd integer (the Neveu–Schwarz case). In both cases, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is central in the superalgebra, and the additional graded brackets are given by

&lt;math&gt;[ L_m , G_r ] = \left( \frac{m}{2} - r \right) G_{m+r} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\{ G_r , G_s \} = 2 L_{r+s} + \frac{c}{3} \left( r^2 - \frac{1}{4} \right) \delta_{r+s,0} &lt;/math&gt;

Note that this last bracket is an [[anticommutator]], not a commutator, because both generators are odd.

The unitary [[highest weight representation]]s of these algebras have a classification analogous to that for the Virasoro algebra, with a continuum of representations together with an infinite discrete series.   The existence of these discrete series was conjectured by [[Daniel Friedan]], Zongan Qiu, and [[Stephen Shenker]] (1984).  It was proven by [[Peter Goddard (physicist)|Peter Goddard]], Adrian Kent and [[David Olive]] (1986), using a supersymmetric generalisation of the [[coset construction]] or GKO construction.

==Application to superstring theory&lt;!--[[Ramond boundary condition]], [[Ramond boundary conditions]], [[Neveu–Schwarz boundary condition]], [[Neveu–Schwarz boundary conditions]], [[Neveu-Schwarz boundary condition]], and [[Neveu-Schwarz boundary conditions]] redirect here--&gt;==

In superstring theory, the [[fermionic field]]s on the [[closed string]] may be either periodic or anti-periodic on the circle around the string. States in the "Ramond sector" admit one option (periodic conditions are referred to as '''Ramond [[Boundary value problem#Boundary value conditions|boundary conditions]]'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;), described by the Ramond algebra, while those in the "Neveu–Schwarz sector" admit the other (anti-periodic conditions are referred to as '''Neveu–Schwarz boundary conditions'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;), described by the Neveu–Schwarz algebra.

For a [[fermionic field]], the periodicity depends on the choice of coordinates on the [[worldsheet]]. In the ''w-frame'', in which the worldsheet of a single string state is described as a long cylinder, states in the Neveu–Schwarz sector are anti-periodic and states in the Ramond sector are periodic. In the ''z-frame'', in which the worldsheet of a single string state is described as an infinite punctured plane, the opposite is true.

The Neveu–Schwarz sector and Ramond sector are also defined in the open string and depend on the boundary conditions of the [[fermionic field]] at the edges of the open string.

'''Technical Illustration''' is the use of [[illustration]] to visually communicate information of a [[technology|technical nature]]. Technical illustrations can be components of [[technical drawing]]s or [[diagram]]s. Technical illustrations in general aim "to generate expressive [[image]]s that effectively convey certain [[information]] via the visual channel to the human observer".&lt;ref name="ViGr05"&gt;Ivan Viola and Meister E. Gröller (2005). "[http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/2005/Viola-05-Smart/Viola-05-Smart-Paper.pdf Smart Visibility in Visualization]". In: ''Computational Aesthetics in Graphics, Visualization and Imaging''. L. Neumann et al. (Ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Technical illustrations generally have to describe and explain the subjects to a nontechnical [[audience]]. Therefore, the visual image should be accurate in terms of dimensions and proportions, and should provide "an overall impression of what an object is or does, to enhance the viewer’s interest and understanding".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Devis|first1=Mae|title=משרביות|url=http://www.laser-group.co.il/משרביות/|website=www.laser-group.co.il|accessdate=14 June 2016|date=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of communication===
Today, technical illustration can be broken down into three categories{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} based on the type of [[communication]]:

* Communication with the [[general public]]: informs the general public, for example illustrated instructions found in the manuals for automobiles and consumer electronics. This type of technical illustration contains simple terminology and symbols that can be understood by the lay person and is sometimes called creative technical illustration/graphics.
* Specialized [[engineering]] or [[scientific]] communication: used by engineers/scientists to communicate with their peers and in [[specification]]s. This use of technical illustration has its own complex terminology and specialized symbols; examples are the fields of atomic energy, aerospace and military/defense. These areas can be further broken down into disciplines of mechanical, electrical, architectural engineering and many more.
* Communication between highly skilled [[expert]]s: used by engineers to communicate with people who are highly skilled in a field, but who are not engineers. Examples of this type of technical illustration are illustrations found in user/operator documentation. These illustrations can be very complex and have jargon and symbols not understood by the general public, such as illustrations that are part of instructional materials for operating [[CNC]] machinery.

===Types of drawings===
Main types of drawings in technical communication are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oliu|first1=Gerald J. Alred, Charles T. Brusaw, Walter E.|title=The business writer's handbook|date=2012|publisher=Bedford/St. Martins|location=Boston|isbn=0312679432|page=172|edition=10th|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0312679432|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* conventional [[Line art|line drawing]]s,
* [[exploded view drawing]]s,
* [[cutaway drawing]]s, and
* [[clip art]] images

==Techniques==
Technical illustration uses several basic mechanical drawing configurations called axonometric projection. These are: 
* [[Parallel projection]]s (oblique, planometric, isometric, dimetric, and trimetric), and
* many types of [[perspective projection]]s (with one, two, or three [[vanishing point]]s).
Technical illustration and [[computer-aided design]] can also use 3D and solidbody projections, such as [[rapid prototyping]].
*In the natural sciences, "scientific illustration" refers to a style of drawing using stippling and simple line techniques to convey information with a minimum of artistic interpretation.

'''Tillamook Head''' is a high [[promontory]] on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast of northwest [[Oregon]] in the [[United States]]. It is located in west-central [[Clatsop County, Oregon|Clatsop County]], approximately 5&amp;nbsp;mi (8&amp;nbsp;km) southwest of [[Seaside, Oregon|Seaside]]. The promontory forms a steep rocky bluff on the ocean, approximately 1,200&amp;nbsp;ft (366 m) high, forested with [[Sitka Spruce]]. It is located in [[Ecola State Park]].

The promontory is named after the [[Tillamook (tribe)|Tillamook]], a [[Salishan]]-speaking tribe of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] that inhabited the coast south of the promontory in the 19th century. In 1806, Captain [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] and 12 members of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Corps of Discovery]] journeyed south from [[Fort Clatsop]], hiking over the promontory where they encountered a beached [[whale]].

==Geology==

Also see [[Astoria Formation]]. Tillamook Head is a tilted remnant of a flow of 15-million-year-old [[Columbia River basalt]].

'''''Wonder en is gheen Wonder''''' (''Mystery is no Mystery'') is a [[popular science]] [[magazine]] of the [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[scientific skepticism|skeptical]] association [[SKEPP]]. The paper was founded in 2000 by Tom Schoepen, who also served as its editor for its first ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://skepp.be/nl/wie-wie-bios |title=Wie is wie (bio's) |author= |publisher=Website SKEPP |date= |accessdate=4 June 2014|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine is published four times a year and addresses [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] as well as [[Philosophy of science|science philosophical]] topics. The title is a reference to the 16th century Flemish mathematician and engineer [[Simon Stevin]]'s commentary to his famous thought experiment: even if something looks strange, it can still have a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.detijdschriften.be/main/andere/maina32.html |title=Culturele en literaire tijdschriften: 'Wonder en is gheen Wonder |author= |publisher=De Tijdschriften |date= |accessdate=4 June 2014|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subtitle ''Tijdschrift voor wetenschap en rede'' ("Magazine for science and reason") was taken from ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', the most world-renowned skeptical magazine that is published by the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]].
