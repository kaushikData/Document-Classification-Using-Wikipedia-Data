[[File:Analysis of the Laws of England.jpg|thumb|right]]
'''''An Analysis of the Laws of England''''' is a legal treatise by British legal professor [[William Blackstone]]. It was first published by the [[Clarendon Press]] in 1756. A [[Fellow_of_All_Souls|Fellow]] of [[All Souls, Oxford]], and a lecturer there, on 3 July 1753 Blackstone announced his intentions to give a set of lectures on the common law — the first lectures of that sort in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Holdsworth (1932) p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; A prospectus was issued on 23 June 1753, and with a class of approximately 20 students, the first lecture series was completed by July 1754. Despite Blackstone's limited oratory skills and a speaking style described by [[Jeremy Bentham]] as "formal, precise and affected", Blackstone's lectures were warmly appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;Prest (2008) p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; The second and third series were far more popular, partially due to his then unusual use of printed handouts and lists of suggested reading. These show Blackstone's attempts to reduce English law to a logical system, with the division of subjects later being the basis for his ''Commentaries''.&lt;ref&gt;Prest (2008) pp. 115-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simpson (1981) p. 652&lt;/ref&gt; The lecture series brought him £116, £226 and £111 a year respectively from 1753 to 1755 — a total of £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|453|1755|r=-3}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms.&lt;ref&gt;Prest (2008) p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing the success of this publication, Blackstone was induced to write ''An Analysis of the Laws of England'', a 200-page introduction to English law, which was first published in 1756 by the [[Clarendon Press]].&lt;ref&gt;Prest (2008) p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

''Analysis'' begins with a summary of the ways that English law had been subdivided until that time. Blackstone examined the methods of [[Ranulf de Glanvill]], [[Henry de Bracton]] and [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Matthew Hale]], concluding that Hale's method was superior to the others. As such, Hale's distribution "hath therefore been principally followed" [by Blackstone in ''An Analysis . . ''], albeit with some amendments.&lt;ref&gt;Finnis (1967) p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; The treatise is "a marked advance on any previous introduction to English law . . including constitutional, civil and criminal law, public and private law, substantive law and procedure, as well as some introductory jurisprudential content".&lt;ref name=pres143&gt;Prest (2008) p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; The initial print run of 1,000 copies almost immediately sold out, leading to the printing of three additional 1,000-book lots over the next three years, which also sold out. A fifth edition was published in 1762,&lt;ref name=pres144&gt;Prest (2008) p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; and a sixth, edited to take into account Blackstone's ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', in 1771.&lt;ref&gt;Cairns (1984) p. 340&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the later editions were prefaced with copies of Blackstone's ''[[A Discourse on the Study of the Law]]'', first published in 1758.&lt;ref&gt;Prest (2008) p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the success of the ''Commentaries'', Prest remarks that "relatively little scholarly attention has been paid to this work";&lt;ref name=pres143/&gt; at the time, however, it was hailed as "an elegant performance...calculated to facilitate this branch of knowledge".&lt;ref name=pres144/&gt;

'''Asian immigration to the United States''' refers to immigration to the United States from throughout the continent of Asia, including [[East Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[Central Asia]], and [[Middle East|the Middle East]]. Asian-origin populations have historically been in the territory that would become the [[United States]] since the 16th century. A first major wave of Asian immigration occurred in the late 19th century, primarily in [[Hawaii]] and the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. [[Asian American]]s experienced exclusion by law from the United States between 1880 and 1965, and were largely prohibited from naturalization until the 1940s. Since the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]], a new wave of new immigrants to the United States in 2010 were from Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Rise of Asian Americans|url = http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2012/06/19/the-rise-of-asian-americans/|website = Pew Research Center’s Social &amp; Demographic Trends Project|accessdate = 2015-10-26|first = |last = Pew Research Center|first3 = |last3 = |first4 = |last4 = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Asian-origin people known to arrive in [[North America]] after the beginning of the [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] were a group of Filipinos known as "Luzonians" or [[Luzon]] Indians who were part of the crew and landing party of the Spanish galleon ''Nuestra Señora de Buena Esperanza''. The ship set sail from [[Manila]] and landed in [[Morro Bay, California|Morro Bay]] in what is now the [[California]] coast on 17 October 1587, as part of the Galleon Trade between the [[Spanish East Indies]] (the colonial name for what would become the Philippines) and [[New Spain]] (Spain's colonies in North America).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Filipinos in Unamuno's California Expedition of 1587|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.17953/amer.21.3.q050756h25525n72|journal = Amerasia Journal|date = 2008-02-05|pages = 175–183|volume = 21|issue = 3|doi = 10.17953/amer.21.3.q050756h25525n72|first = Eloisa Gomez|last = Borah}}&lt;/ref&gt; More Filipino sailors arrived along the California coast when both places were part of the Spanish Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 400th Anniversary Of Spanish Shipwreck / Rough first landing in Bay Area|url = http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/400th-Anniversary-Of-Spanish-Shipwreck-Rough-3019121.php|website = SFGate|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1763, "Manila men" or "Tagalas" had established a settlement called [[Saint Malo, Louisiana|St. Malo]] on the outskirts of [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Filipinos in Louisiana|url = http://www.worldcat.org/title/filipinos-in-louisiana/oclc/19330151|publisher = A.F.

=== First major wave of Asian immigration (1850s-1917) ===
[[File:Early Japanese immigrants to Hawaii.jpg|thumb|Early Japanese immigrants to Hawaii.]]
{{See also|Asian immigration to Hawaii}}

By the 1830s, East Asian groups had begun immigrating to Hawaii, where American capitalists and missionaries had established plantations and settlements. Originating primarily from [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], and [[Philippines|the Philippines]], these early migrants were predominantly contract workers who labored on plantations.{{Sfn|Takaki|1998|p=23-31}} With the [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|annexation of Hawaii by the United States]] in 1893, a large population of Asians lived in a US territory and more would continue to immigrate. As American capitalists established sugar cane plantations in Hawaii in the 19th century, they turned, through organizations such as the [[Royal Hawaiian Agricultural Society]], to the Chinese as a source of cheap labor as early as the 1830s, with the first formal contract laborers arriving in 1852.{{Sfn|Takaki|1998|p=21-24}} Resistance from plantation laborers protesting low wages and tensions between various native and immigrant groups encouraged plantation owners to import more labor from different Asian countries to keep wages low.{{Sfn|Takaki|1998|p=Chapter 4}} Between 1885 and 1924, "some 30,000 Japanese had gone to [Hawaii] as ''kan'yaku imin'', or government-sponsored contract laborers."{{Sfn|Takaki|1998|p=45}} Between 1894 and 1924, roughly 170,000 Japanese immigrants went to Hawaii as private contract laborers, family members of existing immigrants, and merchants.{{Sfn|Takaki|1998|p=45}} Taking refuge from Japanese imperialism and growing poverty and famine in Korea, and encouraged by Christian missionaries, thousands of Koreans migrated to Hawaii in the early 1900s.{{Sfn|Takaki|1998|p=53-56}} Filipinos, who were American colonial subjects after 1898, migrated by the "tens of thousands" to Hawaii in the early 1900s.{{Sfn|Takaki|1998|p=57}}

The first major wave of Asian immigration to the continental United States occurred primarily on the West Coast during the [[California Gold Rush]], starting in the 1850s. Whereas Chinese immigrants numbered less than 400 in 1848, there were 25,000 by 1852.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Geoffrey (1997). The West: An Illustrated History. Little, Brown &amp; Co. p. 147. {{ISBN|0-316-92236-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Chinese immigrants in California, which they called ''Gam Saan'' ("Gold Mountain"), were also from [[Guangdong]] province; they sought sanctuary from conflicts such as the [[Opium Wars]] and ensuing economic instability, and hoped to earn wealth to send back to their families.{{Sfn|Takaki|1998|p=33}} As in Hawaii, many capitalists in California and elsewhere (including as far as [[North Adams, Massachusetts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chinese Workers Arrive in North Adams, June 13, 1870|url = http://www.massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=191|website = www.massmoments.org|accessdate = 2015-10-27|language = |publisher = Mass Humanities}}&lt;/ref&gt;) sought Asian immigrants to fill an increasing demand for labor in gold mines, factories, and on the [[Transcontinental railroad|Transcontinental Railroad]]. Some plantation owners in the South sought Chinese labor as a cheap means to replace the free labor of slavery.{{Sfn|Takaki|1998|p=94}} Chinese laborers generally arrived in California with the help of brokers in Hong Kong and other ports under the credit-ticket system, where they would pay back money loaned from brokers with their wages upon arrival.{{Sfn|Takaki|1998|p=35-36}} In addition to laborers, merchants also migrated from China, opening businesses and stores, including those that would form the beginnings of Chinatowns.{{Sfn|Takaki|1998|p=36-37}}
[[File:Makeshift shelter for Indian farm laborers in California.jpg|thumb|Makeshift shelter for Indian farm laborers (referred to as a "Hindu bed") in California.]]
Japanese, Korean, and South Asian immigrants also arrived in the continental United States starting from late 1800s and onwards to fill demands for labor.{{Sfn|Takaki|1998|p=Chapter 1}} Japanese immigrants were primarily farmers facing economic upheaval during the [[Meiji Restoration]]; they began to migrate in large numbers to the continental United States (having already been migrating to Hawaii since 1885) in the 1890s, after Chinese exclusion (see below).{{Sfn|Takaki|1998|p=44-45}} By 1924, 180,000 Japanese immigrants had gone to the mainland. Filipino migration to North America continued in this period, with reports of "Manila men" in early gold camps in [[Mariposa County, California]] in the late 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Manila Men in the New World: Filipino Migration to Mexico and the Americas from the Sixteenth Century|url = |publisher = University of Hawaii Press|date = 2007|location = Diliman, Quezon City|isbn = 9789715425292|last = Mercene|first = Floro L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1880 census counted 105,465 Chinese and 145 Japanese, indicating that Asian immigration to the continent by this point consisted primarily of Chinese immigrants, overwhelmingly present in California.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Asian immigrants|url = http://immigrationtounitedstates.org/359-asian-immigrants.html|website = Immigration to the United States|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Not a Chinaman's Chance by Charles M Russell 1894.jpeg|thumb|A 1894 painting entitled "Not a [[Chinaman's chance|Chinaman's Chance]]" by white American artist [[Charles Marion Russell]], which depicted violence in [[American frontier|the American West]] against Chinese immigrants.]]
In the 1860s and 1870s, nativist hostility to the presence of Asian laborers in the continental United States grew and intensified, with the formation of organizations such as the [[Asiatic Exclusion League]]. East Asian immigrants, particularly Chinese Americans who composed the majority of the population on the mainland, were seen as the "[[Yellow Peril|yellow peril]]" and suffered violence and discrimination. [[Chinaman's chance|Lynchings of Chinese]] were common, and large-scale attacks also occurred, most prominently the [[Rock Springs massacre]] in which a mob of white miners killed nearly 30 Chinese immigrants. In 1875, Congress passed the [[Page Act of 1875|Page Act]], the first restrictive immigration law. This law identified forced laborers from Asia as well as Asian women who would potentially engage in prostitution as "undesirable" persons, who would henceforth be barred from entering the United States. In practice, the law was enforced to institute a near-complete exclusion of Chinese women from the United States, preventing male laborers from bringing their families with or after them.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882 prohibited virtually all immigration from China, the first immigration law to do so on the basis of race or national origin. Minor exceptions were made for select merchants, diplomats, and students. The law also prevented Chinese immigrants from naturalizing as U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chinese - Growth and Inclusion - Immigration...- Classroom Presentation {{!}} Teacher Resources - Library of Congress|url = https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/immigration/chinese9.html|website = www.loc.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Geary Act]] of 1892 further "required Chinese to register and secure a certificate as proof of their right to be in the United States" if they sought to leave and reenter the United States, with imprisonment or deportation as potential penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chinese Immigration and the Chinese in the United States|url = https://www.archives.gov/research/chinese-americans/guide.html|website = www.archives.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although racial discrimination intensified in the exclusion era, Chinese immigrants fought to defend their existing rights and continued to pursue voting rights and citizenship.{{Sfn|Wong|1998}} The children of these immigrants began to develop "a sense of themselves as having a distinct identity as Chinese Americans."{{Sfn|Wong|1998}}

Initially, Japanese and South Asian laborers filled the demand that could not be met by new Chinese immigrants. The 1900 census counted 24,326 Japanese residents, a sharp increase, and 89,863 Chinese residents. The first South Asian immigrants landed in the United States in 1907, and were predominantly [[Punjabis|Punjabi]] [[Sikh]] farmers. As immigration restrictions specific to South Asians would begin two years later and against Asians generally eight years after that, "[a]ltogether only sixty-four hundred came to America" during this period.{{Sfn|Takaki|1998|p=62}} Like the Chinese and Japanese immigrants of the time, these South Asians were predominantly men.{{Sfn|Takaki|1998|p=62}} South Asian migrants also arrived on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], although to a lesser extent in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, predominantly [[Bengali Muslims]] who worked as craftsmen and merchants, selling 'exotic' goods such as embroidered silks and rugs.{{Sfn|Bald|2013}}{{Sfn|Mishra|2016|p=22-23}} The 1910 census, the first to count South Asians, recorded that there were 2,545 "Hindus" in the United States.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Anti-Asian hostility against these both older and newer Asian immigrant groups continued, becoming explosive in events such as the [[Pacific Coast race riots of 1907]] in [[San Francisco, California]]; [[Bellingham, Washington]]; and [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada. The San Francisco riot was led by anti-Japanese activist, rebelling with violence in order to receive segregated schools for Caucasian and Japanese students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The "Yellow Peril" and Asian Exclusion in the Americas|jstor = 10.1525/phr.2007.76.4.537|journal = Pacific Historical Review|date = 2007|pages = 537–562|volume = 76|issue = 4|doi = 10.1525/phr.2007.76.4.537|first = Erika|last = Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Bellingham riots]], a mob of 400-500 white men attacked the homes of hundreds of South Asian immigrants, beating them and driving them out of town, with over 400 South Asians held in "[[protective custody]]" by local authorities. Along with geopolitical factors, these events encourage the United States to pursue the [[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907|1907 Gentleman's Agreement]] with Japan, wherein the Japanese government agreed to prohibit emigration to the United States and the latter's government agreed to impose less restrictions on Japanese immigrants. In practice, this meant that Japanese immigrants were barred unless they had previously acquired property or were immediate relatives of existing immigrants. While overall Japanese immigration was sharply curtailed, the family reunification provision allowed for the gender gap among Japanese Americans to be reduced significantly (including through "[[Picture Brides|picture brides]]").&lt;ref&gt;Waldo R. Browne (ed.), "Japanese-American Passport Agreement," in ''What's What in the Labor Movement: A Dictionary of Labor Affairs and Labor Terminology.'' New York: B.W. Huebsch, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; As Koreans were Japanese colonial subjects at the time and could be issued Japanese passports, many Korean women also immigrated as family members and "picture brides".{{Sfn|Takaki|1998|p=56}}

After the [[Spanish–American War]] ended with the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1898, the United States replaced Spain as the colonial ruler of the Philippines. As Filipinos become colonial subjects of the United States, they also became US nationals. As American colonial subjects, Filipinos were considered US nationals and thus were not initially subject to exclusion laws. Many Filipinos came as agricultural laborers to fill demands once answered by Chinese and Japanese immigration, with migration patterns to Hawaii extending to the mainland starting from the 1920s.{{Sfn|Takaki|1998|p=57}}&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Filipino Immigrants in the United States|url = http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/filipino-immigrants-united-states|website = migrationpolicy.org|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US government also initially sponsored select Filipino students, known as ''[[pensionados]]'', to attend US colleges and universities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, in 1934, the [[Tydings–McDuffie Act]], which promised independence to the Philippines by 1945, also sharply curtailed Filipino immigration with a quota of 50 immigrants per year.

=== Exclusion era ===
[[File:Angel Island Immigration Station Dormitory b.jpg|thumb|A dormitory at the [[Angel Island Immigration Station]] in [[San Francisco Bay, California]], where immigrants coming from China, Japan, Korea, Russia, and South Asia were monitored, interrogated, and detained.]]
The prohibitions of Chinese and Japanese immigration were consolidated and the exclusion was expanded to Asia as a whole in the [[Asiatic Barred Zone Act]] of 1917, which prohibited all immigration from a zone that encompassed the [[Middle East]], [[Central Asia]], [[South Asia]] (then-[[British India]]), and [[Southeast Asia]]. The [[Immigration Act of 1924]] introduced national origin quotas for the entire Eastern Hemisphere, and barred the immigration of "aliens ineligible for citizenship."{{Sfn|Ngai|2004|p=37}} This introduced a period of near complete exclusion of Asian immigration to the United States. There were some key exceptions to this broad exclusion: in addition to continuing Filipino immigration due to their status as US nationals [[Tydings–McDuffie Act|until 1934]], Asian immigrants continued to immigrate to Hawaii, which was a US territory and therefore not subject to the same immigration laws until it [[Hawaii statehood|achieved statehood]] in 1959. Many [[Chinese immigration to Puerto Rico|Chinese had also immigrated to Puerto Rico]] after 1882, which would [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|become a US territory in 1898]] and remains one today.

After exclusion, existing Chinese immigrants were further excluded from agricultural labor by racial hostility, and as jobs in railroad construction declined, they increasingly moved into self-employment as laundry workers, store and restaurant owners, traders, merchants, and wage laborers; and they congregated in [[Chinatowns in the United States|Chinatowns]] established in California and across the country.{{Sfn|Takaki|1998|p=91-93 &amp; 118-119}}

Of the various Asian immigrant groups present in the United States after broad exclusion was introduced in 1917 and 1924, the South Asian population had the most severe gender gap. This led to many of the Punjabi Sikhs in California at the time to marry women of Mexican descent, avoiding anti-miscegenation laws and racial prejudice that prevented them from marrying into white communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Making Ethnic Choices: California’s Punjabi Mexican Americans|url = http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/841_reg.html|publisher = Temple University Press|date = 1994|location = Philadelphia|isbn = 9781566392020|first = Karen|last = Leonard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two important Supreme Court cases in the exclusion era determined the citizenship status of Asian Americans. In 1922, the Court ruled in ''[[Takao Ozawa v. United States]]'' that ethnic Japanese were not [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]], and therefore did not meet the "free white persons" requirement to naturalize according to the Naturalization Act of 1790. A few months later in 1923, the Court ruled in ''[[United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind]]'' that while Indians were considered Caucasian by [[Racial anthropology|contemporary racial anthropology]], they were not seen as "white" in the common understanding, and were therefore ineligible for naturalization. Whereas ''[[United States v. Wong Kim Ark|United States vs. Wong Kim Ark]]'' had determined that all persons born in the United States, including Asian Americans, were citizens, these cases confirmed that foreign-born Asian immigrants were legally excluded from naturalized citizenship on the basis of race.

During this period, Asian immigrants continued to face racial discrimination. In addition to first-generation immigrants whose permanent ineligibility for citizenship curtailed their civil and political rights, second-generation Asian Americans (who formally had birthright citizenship) continued to face [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] in schools, [[employment discrimination]], and prohibitions on property and business ownership.{{Sfn|Wong|1998}} The most severe discrimination against Asian Americans occurred during the height of the [[World War II]], when 110,000 to 120,000 Japanese Americans (primarily on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]) were [[Internment of Japanese Americans|incarcerated in internment camps]] between 1942–1946. While roughly a third of those interned were ''issei'' (first-generation immigrants) who were ineligible for citizenship, the vast majority were ''nisei'' or ''sansei'' (second- and third-generation) who were citizens by birth.

=== Phasing out of exclusionary policies (1943-1965) ===
[[File:TRUMANLUCECELLER.jpg|thumb|President [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]] signs the [[Luce–Celler Act of 1946|Luce–Celler Act]] of 1946, permitting Filipinos and Indians to naturalize and allowing a quota of 100 persons of each to immigrate annually.]]
After the Second World War, immigration policy in the United States began to undergo significant changes. In 1943, the [[Magnuson Act]] ended 62 years of Chinese exclusion, providing for a quota of 105 persons to immigrate each year, and permitting the Chinese present in the United States to become naturalized citizens. Despite these provisions, the Act consolidated the prohibition of property or business ownership by Chinese Americans. In 1946, the [[Luce–Celler Act of 1946|Luce–Celler Act]] allowed Filipino and Indian nationals to naturalize and provided for a quota of 100 persons to immigrate from each country. Many Asian Americans (including future congressman [[Dalip Singh Saund]]) had been campaigning for such a law for decades.{{Sfn|Mishra|2016|25-26}} Under the act, upon attaining citizenship, immigrants would be able to own property (a right not afforded to Chinese immigrants in the Magnuson Act) and petition for family from their nation of origin.

This wave of reform eventually led to the [[McCarran–Walter Act]] of 1952, which repealed the remnants of the "free white persons" restriction of the [[Naturalization Act of 1790]], permitting Asian and other non-white immigrants to become naturalized citizens. However, this Act retained the quota system that effectively banned nearly all immigration from Asia, except for small annual quotas. Its primary exception to the quota system was family reunification provisions for US citizens, which allowed both relatives of longstanding Asian American families and those who had married American soldiers during World War II and the Korean War (also known as "war brides") to immigrate. The McCarran–Walter Act also introduced some labor qualifications for the first time, and allowed the government to bar the entry of or deport immigrants suspected of engaging in "subversive activities", such as membership in a Communist Party.

=== New waves of Asian immigration (1965-present) ===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}

After the enactment of the 1965 Immigration Act, Asian American demographics changed rapidly. This act replaced exclusionary immigration rules of the [[1924 Immigration Act]] and its predecessors, which effectively excluded "undesirable" immigrants, including most Asians. The 1965 rules set across-the-board immigration quotas for each country. It opened US borders to immigration from Asia for the first time in nearly half a century.

Senator [[Hiram Fong]] (R-HI) answered questions concerning the possible change in our cultural pattern by an influx of Asians: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Asians represent six-tenths of 1 percent of the population of the United States ... with respect to Japan, we estimate that there will be a total for the first 5 years of some 5,391 ... the people from that part of the world will never reach 1 percent of the population .. .Our cultural pattern will never be changed as far as America is concerned." (U.S. Senate, Subcommittee on Immigration and Naturalization of the Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, D.C., Feb. 10, 1965, pp.71, 119.)&lt;ref&gt;https://cis.org/Report/Legacy-1965-Immigration-Act&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: From 1966 to 1970, 19,399 immigrants came from Japan, more than three times Sen. Fong's estimate. Immigration from Asia as a whole has totaled 5,627,576 from 1966 to 1993. 6.8% of the American population is currently of Asian birth or heritage.]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Immigration of Asian Americans were also affected by U.S. war involvement from the 1940s to the 1970s. In the wake of World War II, immigration preferences favored family reunification. This may have helped attract highly skilled workers to meet American workforce deficiencies. Another instance related to World War II was the [[Luce–Celler Act of 1946]], which helped immigrants from [[India]] and the [[Philippines]].

The end of the [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]] and the "[[Laotian Civil War|Secret Wars]]" in Southeast Asia brought a new wave of Asian American immigration, as people from [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], and [[Cambodia]] arrived. Some of the new immigrants were war brides, who were soon joined by their families. Others, like the Southeast Asians, were either highly skilled and educated, or part of subsequent waves of refugees seeking asylum. Some factors contributing to the growth of sub-groups such as South Asians and mainland Chinese were higher family sizes, higher use of family-reunification visas, and higher numbers of technically skilled workers entering on H-1 and [[H-1B visa]]s.

Ethnic Chinese immigration to the United States since 1965 has been aided by the fact that the United States maintains separate quotas for [[Mainland China]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Hong Kong]]. During the late 1960s and early and mid-1970s, Chinese immigration into the United States came almost exclusively from Taiwan creating the [[Taiwanese American]] subgroup.  A smaller number of immigrants from [[Hong Kong]] arrived as college and graduate students.  Immigration from Mainland China was almost non-existent until 1977, when the PRC removed restrictions on emigration leading to immigration of college students and professionals. These recent groups of Chinese tended to cluster in suburban areas and to avoid urban Chinatowns.

One notable suburban Chinatown was Monterey Park. While it was a predominantly White middle-class community in the 1970s, the demographics quickly changed with the incoming Chinese population. The emergence of Chinese-Americans in Monterey Park could be credited to the efforts of the Chinese realtor Frederic Hsieh. He began investing in abandoned properties in Monterey Park in order to gain the interest of wealthy Chinese in Taiwan. He broadcast his plans back in Taiwan and Hong Kong. He aggressively marketed his project as the new mecca of Chinese Americans: in his own words, "Chinese Beverly Hills". Due to political unrest in Asia, there was a lot of interest in overseas investment for Monterey Park from wealthy Chinese in Taiwan. 

The contrasts between Japanese Americans and South Asian Americans are emblematic of the dramatic changes since the immigration reforms. Japanese Americans are among the most widely recognized of Asian American sub-groups during the 20th century. At its peak in 1970, there were nearly 600,000 Japanese Americans, making it the largest sub-group, but historically the greatest period of immigration was generations past. Today, given relatively low rates of births and immigration, Japanese Americans are only the sixth-largest Asian American group. In 2000, there were between 800,000 and 1.2 million Japanese Americans (depending on whether multi-ethnic responses are included). The Japanese Americans have the highest rates of native-born, citizenship, and assimilation into American values and customs.

Before 1990, there were slightly fewer South Asians in the U.S. than Japanese Americans. By 2000, [[Indian American]]s nearly doubled in population to become the third largest group of Asian Americans, with increasing visibility in high-tech communities such as the Silicon Valley and the Seattle area. Indian Americans have some of the highest rates of academic achievement among [[United States|American]] ethnic groups. Most immigrants speak English and are highly educated. South Asians are increasingly accepted by most Asian organizations as another significant Asian group. Currently, Chinese, Indians, and Filipinos are the three largest Asian ethnic groups immigrating to the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23943">The '''Atlantic Charter''' was a pivotal policy statement issued during [[World War II]] on 14 August 1941 which defined the Allied goals for the post-war world. The leaders of the United Kingdom and the United States drafted the work and all the [[Allies of World War II]] later confirmed it. The Charter stated the ideal goals of the war: no territorial aggrandizement; no territorial changes made against the wishes of the people (self-determination); restoration of self-government to those deprived of it; reduction of trade restrictions; global cooperation to secure better economic and social conditions for all; freedom from fear and want; freedom of the seas; and abandonment of the use of force, as well as disarmament of aggressor nations. Adherents of the Atlantic Charter signed the ''[[Declaration by United Nations]]'' on 1 January 1942, which became the basis for the modern [[United Nations]].

The Atlantic Charter set goals for the postwar world and inspired many of the international agreements that followed the war. The [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), the postwar independence of European colonies, and much more are derived from the Atlantic Charter.

==Origin==
[[File:Prince of Wales-5.jpg|thumb|left|[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill]] aboard HMS ''Prince of Wales'' in 1941]]
[[President of the United States|US President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] drafted the Atlantic Charter at the Atlantic Conference (codenamed ''Riviera'') in [[Placentia Bay]], [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]].&lt;ref&gt;Langer and Gleason, chapter 21&lt;/ref&gt; They issued it as a joint declaration on 14 August 1941 at [[Naval Station Argentia]] although the United States would not officially enter the War until four months later. The policy was issued as a ''statement''; as such there was no formal, legal document entitled "The Atlantic Charter". It detailed the goals and aims of the Allied powers concerning the war and the postwar world.

Many of the ideas of the Charter came from an ideology of Anglo-American internationalism that sought British and American cooperation for the cause of international security.&lt;ref&gt;Cull, pp. 4, 6&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt's attempts to tie Britain to concrete war aims and Churchill's desperation to bind the US to the war effort helped provide motivations for the meeting which produced the Atlantic Charter.  It was assumed at the time that Britain and America would have an equal role to play in any postwar international organization that would be based on the principles of the Atlantic Charter.&lt;ref&gt;Cull, pp 15, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Churchill and Roosevelt began communicating in 1939; this was the first of their 11 wartime meetings.&lt;ref name="gunther1950"&gt;Gunther, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; Both men traveled in secret; Roosevelt was on a ten-day fishing trip.&lt;ref&gt;Weigold, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 August 1941, the British battleship [[HMS Prince of Wales (53)|HMS ''Prince of Wales'']] steamed into [[Placentia Bay]], with Churchill on board, and met the American heavy cruiser [[USS Augusta (CA-31)|USS ''Augusta'']], where Roosevelt and members of his staff were waiting. On first meeting, Churchill and Roosevelt were silent for a moment until Churchill said "At long last, Mr. President", to which Roosevelt replied "Glad to have you aboard, Mr. Churchill". Churchill then delivered to the president a letter from King [[George VI]] and made an official statement which, despite two attempts, the movie sound crew present failed to record.&lt;ref&gt;Gratwick, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

The Atlantic Charter made clear that the United States was supporting the United Kingdom in the war. Both the US and UK wanted to present their unity, regarding their mutual principles and hopes for a peaceful postwar world and the policies they agreed to follow once the Nazis had been defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamental aim was to focus on the peace that would follow, and not specific American involvement and war strategy, although American involvement appeared increasingly likely.&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan and Welles&lt;/ref&gt;

The eight principal points of the Charter were:
#no territorial gains were to be sought by the United States or the United Kingdom;
#territorial adjustments must be in accord with the wishes of the peoples concerned;
#all people had a right to [[self-determination]];
#[[trade barriers]] were to be lowered;
#there was to be global economic cooperation and advancement of social welfare;
#the participants would work for a world free of want and fear;
#the participants would work for [[freedom of the seas]];
#there was to be disarmament of aggressor nations, and a common disarmament after the war.

Although Clause Three clearly states that all peoples have the right to decide their form of government, it fails to say what changes are necessary in both social and economic terms, so as to achieve freedom and peace.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Clause Four, with respect to international trade, consciously emphasized that both "victor [and] vanquished" would be given market access "on equal terms." This was a repudiation of the punitive trade relations that were established within Europe after World War I, as exemplified by the [[Paris Economy Pact]].

Only two clauses expressly discuss national, social, and economic conditions necessary after the war, despite this significance.

==Origin of the name==
When it was released to the public, the Charter was titled "Joint Declaration by the President and the Prime Minister" and was generally known as the "Joint Declaration".  The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] newspaper ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'' coined the name ''Atlantic Charter'', but Churchill used it in Parliament on 24 August 1941, and it has since been generally adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Wrigley, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

No signed version ever existed. The document was threshed out through several drafts and the final agreed text was telegraphed to London and Washington. President Roosevelt gave Congress the Charter's content on 21 August 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=President Roosevelt's message to Congress on the Atlantic Charter| url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/atcmess.asp | date=21 August 1941| work=The Avalon Project| publisher=Lillian Goldman Law Library| accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said later, "There isn't any copy of the Atlantic Charter, so far as I know. I haven't got one. The British haven't got one. The nearest thing you will get is the [message of the] radio operator on ''Augusta'' and ''Prince of Wales''. That's the nearest thing you will come to it ... There was no formal document."{{r|gunther1950}}

The British War Cabinet replied with its approval and a similar acceptance was telegraphed from Washington. During this process, an error crept into the London text, but this was subsequently corrected. The account in Churchill's ''[[The Second World War (book series)|The Second World War]]'' concludes "A number of verbal alterations were agreed, and the document was then in its final shape", and makes no mention of any signing or ceremony. In Churchill's account of the [[Yalta Conference]] he quotes Roosevelt saying of the unwritten British constitution that "it was like the Atlantic Charter – the document did not exist, yet all the world knew about it. Among his papers he had found one copy signed by himself and me, but strange to say both signatures were in his own handwriting."&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acceptance by Inter-Allied Council and by United Nations==
The Allied nations and leading organisations quickly and widely endorsed the Charter.&lt;ref&gt;Lauren|, pp. 140–41&lt;/ref&gt; At the subsequent meeting of the Inter-Allied Council in London on 24 September 1941, the governments in exile of Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Yugoslavia, as well as the Soviet Union, and representatives of the [[Free French Forces]], unanimously adopted adherence to the common principles of policy set forth in the Atlantic Charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Inter-Allied Council Statement on the Principles of the Atlantic Charter| url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/interall.asp| date=24 September 1941| work=The Avalon Project| publisher=Lillian Goldman Law Library| accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 January 1942, a larger group of nations, who adhered to the principles of the Atlantic Charter, issued a joint [[Declaration by United Nations]] stressing their solidarity in the defense against Hitlerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Joint Declaration by the United Nations |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/decade03.asp| date=1 January 1942| work=The Avalon Project| publisher=Lillian Goldman Law Library| accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on the Axis powers==
[[File:Colonization 1945.png|thumb|upright=2|World map of colonization at the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1945]]
The [[Axis powers]] interpreted these diplomatic agreements as a potential alliance against them. In Tokyo, the Atlantic Charter rallied support for the militarists in the Japanese government, who pushed for a more aggressive approach against the US and Britain.

The British dropped millions of flysheets over Germany to allay fears of a punitive peace that would destroy the German state. The text cited the Charter as the authoritative statement of the joint commitment of Great Britain and the US "not to admit any economical discrimination of those defeated" and promised that "Germany and the other states can again achieve enduring peace and prosperity."&lt;ref&gt;Sauer, p. 407&lt;/ref&gt;

The most striking feature of the discussion was that an agreement had been made between a range of countries that held diverse opinions, who were accepting that internal policies were relevant to the international problem.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement proved to be one of the first steps towards the formation of the [[United Nations]].

==Impact on imperial powers and imperial ambitions==
The problems came not from [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], but from those of the allies that had empires and which resisted self-determination—especially the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Netherlands]]. Initially it appears that Roosevelt and Churchill had agreed that the third point of Charter was not going to apply to [[Africa]] and [[Asia]].  However Roosevelt's speechwriter [[Robert E. Sherwood]] noted that "it was not long before the people of [[India]], [[Burma]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], and [[Indonesia]] were beginning to ask if the Atlantic Charter extended also to the Pacific and to Asia in general."  With a war that could only be won with the help of these allies, Roosevelt's solution was to put some pressure on Britain but to postpone until after the war the issue of self-determination of the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Borgwardt, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Empire===
Public opinion in Britain and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] was delighted with the principles of the meetings but disappointed that the US was not entering the war. Churchill admitted that he had hoped the US would decide to commit itself.

The acknowledgement that all people had a right to self-determination gave hope to independence leaders in [[British Empire|British colonies]].&lt;ref&gt;Bayly and Harper&lt;/ref&gt;

The Americans were insistent that the charter was to acknowledge that the war was being fought to ensure self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;Louis (1985) pp. 395–420&lt;/ref&gt; The British were forced to agree to these aims but in a September 1941 speech, Churchill stated that the Charter was only meant to apply to states under German occupation, and certainly not to the countries who formed part of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;

Churchill rejected its universal applicability when it came to the self-determination of subject nations such as [[British Raj|British India]]. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in 1942 wrote to President Roosevelt: "I venture to think that the Allied declaration that the Allies are fighting to make the world safe for the freedom of the individual and for democracy sounds hollow so long as India and for that matter Africa are exploited by Great Britain..."&lt;ref name=Sathasivam&gt;Sathasivam, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;  While self-determination was Roosevelt's guiding principle, he was reluctant to place pressure on the British in regard to India and other colonial possessions as they were fighting for their lives in a war in which the United States was not a participant.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph P. Lash, ''Roosevelt and Churchill, 1939-1941'', W. W. Norton &amp; Company, New York, 1976, pp. 447–448.&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi refused to help either the British or the American war effort against Germany and Japan in any way, and Roosevelt chose to back Churchill.&lt;ref&gt;Louis, (2006), p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; India was already contributing significantly to the war effort, sending over 2.5 million men (the largest volunteer force in the world at the time) to fight for the Allies, mostly in West Asia and North Africa.&lt;ref name="CWrepdirect"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/foreverindia/memorials/2nd-world-war.php |title=Second World War Memorials |accessdate=14 August 2013 |publisher=[[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102124717/http://www.cwgc.org/foreverindia/memorials/2nd-world-war.php |archivedate=2 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
Churchill was unhappy with the inclusion of references to peoples' right to "self-determination" and stated that he considered the Charter an "interim and partial statement of war aims designed to reassure all countries of our righteous purpose and not the complete structure which we should build after the victory."  An office of the [[Polish Government in Exile]] wrote to warn [[Władysław Sikorski]] that if the Charter was implemented with regard to national self-determination, it would make the desired Polish annexation of [[Danzig]], [[East Prussia]] and parts of German [[Silesia]] impossible, which led the Poles to approach Britain asking for a flexible interpretation of the Charter.&lt;ref name="Google books"&gt;Prażmowska, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baltic states===
During the war Churchill argued for an interpretation of the charter in order to allow the Soviet Union to continue to control the [[Baltic states]], an interpretation rejected by the US until March 1944.&lt;ref name=whitcomb&gt;Whitcomb, p. 18;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] warned that the Atlantic Charter "would be a menace to our [Britain's] own safety as well as to that of the Soviet Union." The US refused to recognise the Soviet takeover of the Baltics, but did not press the issue against Stalin when he was fighting the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Louis (1998), p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt planned to raise the Baltic issue after the war, but he died in April 1945, before fighting had ended in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Hoopes and Brinkley, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

Some posit that the reason why the people of Morocco took up the madhhab of Imam Malik, is that the people of Morocco and [[al-Andalus]] were originally upon the madhhab of al-Awza’i. However since the Umayyad conquest of the region and the [[Berber revolt]], Morocco and western Algeria were following [[Kharijites]] schools which were adopted by the ruling dynasties such as the [[Maghrawa]], the emirate of Toudgha and the [[Ibadhi]] [[Rustamid dynasty]]. And, with the exception of [[Tunisia]] and al-Andalus, the Maliki school only became established in the region after the rise of the [[Almoravid dynasty]].

Then during the rule of [[Al-Hakam I]], the official fatwas were changed and given according to the opinion of Malik ibn Anas and the people of [[Medina|al-Madina]]. This was due to the opinion and preference of al-Hakam due to some political benefits he saw and they differ about the actual reason, which still remains unclear. Most hold that it was due to the scholars of al-Andalus travelling to Medina, then when they returned they spoke of the excellence of Malik, his wide knowledge and great station, so they honoured him and preferred his Madhhab. Others say that Imam Malik asked some of the people of al-Andalus about the rule in their region and they described it to him and Malik was very pleased by it since the [[Abbasids]] in that time did not rule in a manner that was agreeable. So, Imam Malik said to the person who told him, ‘We ask Allaah to enlighten our sacred precincts with your rule.’ This was transmitted to the ruler of al-Andalus, who already knew of the knowledge, excellence and piety of Malik; so he led the people to accept his Madhhab and ordered that the madhhab of al-Awza’i be abandoned. Later, the kings of Morocco and the west agreed that the rulings and actions should be according to the preferences of Ibn al-Qaasim al-`Utaqi (a famous student of Malik) only.{{when|date=July 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;“Nafh ut-Teeb min Ghasn il-Andalus ir-rateeb,” by Ahmad al-Muqree al-Maghribee (3/158)&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Syria===
In Syria, the Madhhab of al-Awza’i remained the main school of thought until the 10th century, when Abu Zar’ah Muhammed ibn Uthman of the Shafi’ee Madhhab was appointed judge of Damascus. Abu Zar’ah began the practice of giving a prize of 100 dinars to any student who memorized the book, Mukhtasr al-Muzanee (the basics of Shafi’ee fiqh). Naturally, the practice caused the Shafi’ee Madhhab to spread rapidly in Syria, until none of al-Awza’i’s followers remained until the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;”al-Madkhal,” pg.205-206, and “Fiqh al-Imaam al-Awza’i,” by ‘Abdullah Muhammed al-Jabooree,&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bermuda II''' was a [[bilateral air transport agreement]] between the governments of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] signed on 23 July 1977 as a renegotiation of the original 1946 [[Bermuda Agreement|Bermuda air services agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1977/1977%20-%201999.html ''Bermuda 2 initialled'', Air Transport, Flight International, 2 July 1977, p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1977/1977%20-%202000.html ''Bermuda 2 initialled'', Air Transport, Flight International, 2 July 1977, p. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1977/1977%20-%202260.html ''Bermuda 2: signed and sealed ...'', Air Transport, Flight International, 23 July 1977, p. 254]&lt;/ref&gt; A new "[[EU-US Open Skies Agreement|open skies]]" agreement was signed by the United States and the [[European Union]] (EU) (of which the United Kingdom is part) on 30 April 2007 and came into effect on 30 March 2008, thus replacing Bermuda II.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6607757.stm US and EU agree 'single market' (BBC News &gt; World &gt; Europe), 30 April 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original 1946 Bermuda agreement took its name from [[Bermuda|the island]] where [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[United States|US]] transport officials met to negotiate a new, [[bilateral air transport agreement|inter-governmental air services agreement]] between [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the United States. That agreement, which was (relative to modern agreements) highly restrictive at the insistence of the [[United Kingdom|British]] negotiators who feared that "giving in" to US demands for a "free-for-all" would lead to the then financially superior US airlines' total domination of the global air transport industry, was the world's first [[bilateral air transport agreement|bilateral air services agreement]]. It became a [[blueprint]] for all subsequent air services agreements.

Bermuda II was revised several times since its signing, most recently in 1995.&lt;ref name="revision"&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1980/1980%20-%200863.html ''Bermuda 2 revisions create 12 new US gateways and agreement on Gatwick'', Air Transport, Flight International, 15 March 1980, p. 825]&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bermuda II was much less restrictive than the original Bermuda agreement it replaced, it was widely regarded as a highly restrictive agreement that contrasted with the principle of "[[EU-US Open Skies Agreement|open skies]]" against the background of continuing liberalization of the legal framework governing the air transport industry in various parts of the world.

==Historical background==
In July 1976, [[Edmund Dell]], the then new UK [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills|Secretary of State for Trade]], renounced the original Bermuda Agreement of 1946 and initiated bilateral negotiations with his US counterparts on a new air services agreement, which resulted in the Bermuda II treaty of 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1976/1976%20-%201128.html ''Britain to end Bermuda Agreement'', Air Transport, Flight International, 3 July 1976, p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for this was that there was no provision in the original 1946 Bermuda agreement that would have allowed [[British Caledonian]] (BCal), then the UK's foremost wholly privately owned, independent international scheduled airline, to use the licences the UK [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|Civil Aviation Authority]] (CAA) had awarded it in 1972 to begin daily scheduled services from its [[Gatwick Airport|London Gatwick]] base to [[William P. Hobby Airport|Houston]] and [[Hartsfield-Jackson|Atlanta]]. (These cities were not nominated as "gateway cities" in the original Bermuda agreement.) In addition, there was no provision in the original Bermuda agreement that would have allowed [[Laker Airways]] to use the licence the UK's Air Transport Licensing Board (ATLB), the CAA's predecessor, had awarded it the same year to commence a daily "Skytrain" operation between [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]] and New York.

==Original agreement (1977)==

Under the original 1977 version of Bermuda II, [[British Airways]], [[Pan American World Airways]] and [[Trans World Airlines]] were the only carriers allowed to operate flights between [[London Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]] and the United States.

[[Air India]], [[El Al]], [[Iran Air]] and [[Kuwait Airways]] were permitted to continue exercising their so-called "[[freedoms of the air#Fifth freedom|fifth freedom]]" traffic rights from Heathrow to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|John F. Kennedy Airport]] (JFK), which they had already enjoyed under the original Bermuda agreement. (Both [[El Al]] and Iran Air stopped exercising these rights. The former decided that it made better economic sense to fly non-stop between [[Tel Aviv]] and [[New York City|New York]]. The latter's US traffic rights were withdrawn in the aftermath of the 1979 [[Iranian hostage crisis]].) Similarly, [[Air New Zealand]] was allowed to continue using its fifth freedom rights between [[London]] and [[Los Angeles]].

The extensive fifth freedom rights US carriers used to enjoy from the UK to other [[Europe]]an countries were restricted to a few routes from London Heathrow to what used to be [[West Germany]] (including [[West Berlin]]) in the days prior to [[German reunification]]. In the early '90s, United Airlines used to fly between Heathrow, [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Munich]] (United had acquired these traffic rights along with [[Pan Am]]'s [[transatlantic flight|transatlantic]] rights to/from Heathrow for [[United States dollar|US$]]1[[1000000000 (number)|billion]] in 1990). A few years earlier, [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]] flew between London and [[Brussels]] but, unlike United, did not have traffic rights to carry local traffic between the two cities.

[[United States|American]] and British regulatory authorities needed to approve every airline's capacity and pricing ahead of each operating season. Each country could refuse traffic rights to a carrier it was not satisfied with, particularly with regard to ownership and/or control. Only a specified number of US "gateway cities" could be served by both UK and US carriers from London Heathrow as well as [[London Gatwick Airport|London Gatwick]].

Only the following US gateway cities could be served non-stop from Heathrow: [[Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport|Baltimore]], [[Logan International Airport|Boston]], [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago O'Hare]], [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport|Detroit]], [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]], [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], New York JFK, [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark]], [[Anchorage International Airport|Anchorage]], [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport|Minneapolis/St. Paul]], [[Philadelphia International Airport|Philadelphia]], [[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco]], [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport|Seattle]], and [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Washington-Dulles]]. [[Anchorage]] and [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport|Minneapolis/St. Paul]], held dormant authorities to use Heathrow as their [[London]] terminal, [[Grandfather clause|grandfather]]ed from use during the original Bermuda Agreement; but could only be operated non-stop by a British carrier. As such, Anchorage remained dormant during the latter years of Bermuda II, and Minneapolis featured service only to London Gatwick, as its operating carrier ([[Northwest Airlines]]) did not have the authority to operate into Heathrow.

Other airports in the United States had to be served from [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] rather than Heathrow: these eventually included [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]], [[Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport|Cincinnati]], [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport|Cleveland]], [[New Orleans International Airport|New Orleans]], [[Pittsburgh International Airport|Pittsburgh]], [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth]], [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport|Houston]], [[McCarran International Airport|Las Vegas]], [[Orlando International Airport|Orlando]], [[Tampa International Airport|Tampa]], [[Raleigh-Durham International Airport|Raleigh/Durham]], [[Lambert-St. Louis International Airport|St. Louis]] and [[Charlotte/Douglas International Airport|Charlotte]].

A provision existed that allowed any Heathrow-authorised British carrier operating as the sole carrier between London Gatwick and any US city to switch that service to Heathrow as long as the incumbent airline had demonstrated its ability to carry a minimum of 300,000 non-stop passengers (both transfer and point-to-point) between that city and London, and vice versa, over a period of two consecutive calendar years. Using this method, BA was able to transfer [[Denver International Airport|Denver]], [[San Diego International Airport|San Diego]] and [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport|Phoenix]] services from Gatwick to Heathrow.

Bermuda II continued and expanded the principle of "dual designation", i.e. the right to designate two UK airlines as well as two US carriers as "[[flag carrier]]s" on the same routes, which already existed on the London–New York and London–Los Angeles routes under the original Bermuda treaty.

Under the new agreement, BCal had its licences to commence scheduled services from its Gatwick base to both Houston and Atlanta confirmed and was designated as the UK's exclusive flag carrier on both routes. It also obtained a licence and sole UK flag carrier status to commence scheduled services from Gatwick to Dallas/Fort Worth. In addition, BCal obtained a licence and sole UK flag carrier status to commence scheduled all cargo flights between Gatwick and Houston – including an optional stop-over at Manchester or [[Glasgow Prestwick Airport|Prestwick]] in either direction.

The UK [[Her Majesty's Government|Government]] chose to designate Laker Airways rather than BCal as the second UK flag carrier to New York to enable that airline to inaugurate its long-planned "Skytrain" operation on that route.

Moreover, both sides agreed to continue dual designation, i.e. designating two UK flag carriers as well as two US flag carriers, on the London–New York and London–Los Angeles routes. The principle of dual designation was extended to another two high-volume routes. The UK side chose to designate a second carrier on London–[[Miami]], while the US side chose London–[[Boston]] for the same purpose. This meant that a second British airline was permitted to commence scheduled services on the former route, whereas another American carrier could do the same on the latter route. The UK government chose to designate Laker Airways as the second UK flag carrier on the Los Angeles and Miami routes, whilst the US government decided to designate [[Northwest Airlines|Northwest]] as the second US flag carrier on London–Boston. (Pan Am and TWA continued in their role as the two designated US flag carriers between London and New York as well as London and Los Angeles respectively.)
[[File:Braniff International Boeing 747-100 Rees.jpg|thumb|A [[Braniff International Airways|Braniff]] [[Boeing 747]] at [[London Gatwick Airport|London Gatwick]] in 1981. Braniff was among the [[United States|US]] carriers using Gatwick instead of [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]] for their [[London]] services under the terms of the Bermuda II [[bilateral air transport agreement|air agreement]]. Between 1978 and 1982, it operated daily into Gatwick&lt;br&gt;from [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth]].]]

During the Bermuda II negotiations, the UK side succeeded in having inserted into the new air services agreement a clause stating that Gatwick – rather than Heathrow – was to be nominated as the designated US flag carrier's London gateway airport whenever BCal was going to be the sole designated UK flag carrier on the same route. This clause was meant to support the growth of BCal's scheduled operation at Gatwick as well as to redress the competitive imbalance between it and its much bigger, more powerful rivals.

The UK side furthermore succeeded in negotiating a three-year "exclusivity" period for the incumbent operator on any new route with their US counterparts.

For Gatwick-based BCal this meant that it did not have to face any competitor that was using Heathrow, a more accessible airport with a bigger catchment area and a far greater number of passengers connecting between flights, on any of the new routes it was planning to launch to the US. It also meant that it had any new route to the US completely to itself for the first three years of operation, which most airline industry analysts reckon is sufficiently long for a brand-new scheduled air service to become profitable.

At British insistence Bermuda II furthermore contained clauses that made it illegal for any airline operating scheduled flights between the UK and the US to resort to [[predatory pricing]] or capacity dumping. Air fares were only approved if they reflected the actual cost of providing these services. Similarly, capacity increases were sanctioned on a reciprocal basis only. The reason for insisting on the inclusion of these provisions in the Bermuda II agreement was to prevent the much bigger, better financed and commercially far more aggressive US carriers from undercutting BCal with "loss-leading" fares cross-subsidised with profits those carriers' vast domestic networks generated as well as to stop them from "marginalising" the UK carrier by adding capacity far in excess of what the market could sustain.

Bermuda II also provided routing restrictions for flights between the United States and various British overseas colonies including [[Bermuda]], various Caribbean islands and [[Hong Kong]].

==1981 revision==

Both sides agreed to automatically nominate Gatwick as the gateway airport for London for any London–US route that did not already exist under the original 1946 Bermuda agreement.&lt;ref name="revision"/&gt; When all available routes between London Heathrow/Gatwick and the US were taken, any carrier wishing to start a new route to a US gateway city not served from either of London's two main airports at the time of application for route authority needed to drop another route. In addition, any such change could only become effective when there was unanimous agreement between both the UK and [[Federal government of the United States|US government]]s. Failure of both nations' governments to agree to such changes prevented the introduction of additional non-stop flights, including between London and [[Honolulu]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland (OR)]], and [[Salt Lake City]]. British Airways did successfully gain approval in 1982 to operate nonstop to [[New Orleans]] from Gatwick, as an intermediate stop on its [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar|L-1011]] service to [[Mexico City]].  This gateway was later omitted as the performance capability of newer [[Boeing 747|747]]s allowed the airline to operate the round trip route nonstop, despite the Mexican city's high altitude.

==1991 revision==

In the wake of the bankruptcies of TWA and Pan Am, the carriers authorized to operate Heathrow routes were replaced by [[British Airways]] and [[Virgin Atlantic Airways|Virgin Atlantic]] on the UK side and [[American Airlines]] and [[United Airlines]] on the US side.

Pan Am had previously sold its Heathrow traffic rights to United Airlines, but British negotiators initially stated that they would not allow United to receive the transferred route authority citing Bermuda II's specific designation of Pan Am; they furthermore stated that United was not a successor airline because it was not assuming ownership of Pan Am. 

Virgin Atlantic's access rights to Heathrow under Bermuda II derived from the fact that the UK was not using its entitlement to nominate a second carrier to match the two US carriers' presence at London's premier airport. The UK Government therefore took advantage of the abolition of the London [Air] Traffic Distribution Rules, which had confined Virgin's London operations to Gatwick, as well as of the US Government's intention to have American and United replace TWA and Pan Am as the designated US flag carriers at Heathrow to help Virgin establish a presence at that airport as well. 

These access restrictions were also the reason BA (as BCal's legal heir between London and Houston, Dallas, and Atlanta) and American (as [[Braniff Airways|Braniff]]'s legal heir between Dallas and London) were compelled to continue using Gatwick as their UK gateway for all non-stop scheduled operations between London and Houston, Dallas, and Atlanta as long as Bermuda II remained in force.

[[Code sharing]] also became possible under the 1991 agreement. The US later approved [[Continental Airlines]] to fly to London Heathrow, but British refusal to endorse the US position prevented Continental from exercising this route authority. However, Continental succeeded in obtaining UK permission to enter into a [[codeshare agreement]] with Virgin Atlantic, which placed Continental's flight numbers in addition to Virgin's on some of the latter's Heathrow and [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] flights. 

==1995 revision==

Fare and route restrictions governing all scheduled air services serving airports other than London Heathrow or London Gatwick were lifted. (This partial liberalisation came about as a UK concession to the US to help BA gain approval for its code-share alliance with [[US Airways|US Air]]. As a result, access restrictions that originally covered all London airports were lifted at [[London Luton Airport|Luton]] and [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]]. This, in turn, enabled the now defunct "new generation", all-[[business class]] carriers such as [[Eos Airlines|Eos]], [[Maxjet]] and [[Silverjet]] to enter the lucrative London–New York business travel market by choosing Stansted and Luton rather than Heathrow or Gatwick as their UK departure/arrival airports). Continental Airlines also took advantage of this liberalisation by starting service to a number of important regional UK airports, including [[Bristol International Airport|Bristol]], [[Birmingham International Airport (United Kingdom)|Birmingham]], [[Manchester Airport|Manchester]], [[Edinburgh Airport|Edinburgh]], [[Glasgow International Airport|Glasgow]] and [[Belfast International Airport|Belfast]]. Continental furthermore introduced non-stop service to Stansted from Newark in 2001, but this was withdrawn in the industry downturn after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]].

==1997 revision==

Flights between the United States and [[Hong Kong]] were removed from the scope of Bermuda II in 1997, when sovereignty over Hong Kong was transferred to the [[People's Republic of China]].

==Aftermath==
Liberalisation of the Bermuda II agreement was the declared intention of both countries since 1995. However, bilateral negotiations between the UK and the US were unsuccessful.

Subsequently, matters were complicated by the [[European Court of Justice]]'s judgment to declare all bilateral agreements between individual EU member states and the US illegal. Such agreements were deemed to violate the EU's Common Aviation Market. 

The main sticking point that had prevented the conclusion of a new, transatlantic "Common Aviation Area" agreement between the EU and the US was that the UK and most other European countries viewed the US version of "open skies" as too restrictive. The US "open skies" template denied foreign airlines "[[cabotage]]" rights, i.e. the right to operate wholly within the US domestic market without entering into a code-share agreement with a US carrier. It also denied foreign airlines the right to acquire stakes in their US counterparts with the intention of exercising boardroom control.

On March 2, 2007 a draft agreement&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52006PC0169(02):EN:HTML EUR Lex - 52006PC0169(02)]&lt;/ref&gt; was reached by negotiators from the [[European Commission]] and the US that proposed to drop Bermuda II's restrictions preventing US flag carriers, other than American and United, from flying to Heathrow.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=aSYhQy6KP1mw&amp;refer=news Bloomberg.com: U.S&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This new Air Transport Agreement between the EU and the US was approved unanimously by the [[Council of the European Union|EU Transport Council]] on 22 March 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air_portal/international/pillars/global_partners/doc/us/council_conclusions_22_03_2007.pdf European Commission - Transport: Air Portal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912161555/http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air_portal/international/pillars/global_partners/doc/us/council_conclusions_22_03_2007.pdf |date=12 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced Bermuda II with effect from 30 March 2008. It also paved the way for either country to allow airlines headquartered in other EU countries to enter the UK-US air transport market. On 3 October 2007, Britain concluded its first fully liberal [[open skies]] agreement with Singapore, allowing [[Singapore Airlines]] to fly completely unrestricted from any point in the United Kingdom, including Heathrow, to any other destination, including the United States and domestic destinations, effective 30 March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporebusinessnews/view/303608/1/.html Channelnewsasia.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Populism sidebar}}
{{African American topics sidebar|right}}

Following the collapse of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], [[African American]]s created a broad-based independent political movement in the South: '''Black Populism'''.&lt;ref&gt;Ali 2008, pp. 74–100&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==

Between 1886 and 1898 Black farmers, [[sharecropper]]s, and agrarian laborers organized their communities to combat the rising tide of [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] laws. As Black Populism asserted itself and grew into a regional force, it met fierce resistance from the white planter and business elite that, through the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and its affiliated network of courts, militias, sheriffs, and newspapers, maintained tight control of the region. Violence against Black Populism was organized through the [[Ku Klux Klan]], among other white terrorist organizations designed to halt or reverse the advance of black civil and political rights.&lt;ref&gt;Ali 2010, pp. 113–167.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==

Despite opposition, Black Populists carried out a wide range of activities:

*Establishing farming exchanges
*Raising money for schools
*Publishing newspapers
*Lobbying for better legislation
*Mounting boycotts against agricultural trusts
*Carrying out strikes for better wages
*Protesting the convict-lease system and lynching
*Demanding Black jurors in cases involving black defendants
*Promoting local political reforms and federal supervision of elections
*Running independent and fusion campaigns.

Black Populism found early expression in various agrarian organizations, including the [[Colored Agricultural Wheels]], the southern [[Knights of Labor]], the [[Cooperative Workers of America]], and the [[Colored Farmers' National Alliance and Cooperative Union|Colored Farmers' Alliance]]. However, facing the limitations in attempting to implement their reforms absent of engaging the electoral process, Black Populists helped to launch the [[People's Party (United States)|People’s Party]] and used the then left-of-centre [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in fusion campaigns. (Today though, after the Republican Party moved to the right, and the Democratic Party in the South was abandoned by the White Populist [[Dixiecrats]] who had opposed integration in the 1960s, most African Americans who vote cast ballots for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidates).&lt;ref&gt;Ali 2010, pp. 13–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resistance and failure==

By the late 1890s, under relentless attack – propaganda campaigns warning of a “second Reconstruction” and “Negro rule,” physical intimidation, violence, and assassinations of leaders and foot soldiers – the movement was crushed. A key figure in the attack on Black Populism was [[Ben Tillman]], the leader of [[South Carolina]]'s white farmers' movement. As realistic politicians, the Southern Populist knew that they had only two possible alternatives in the fight against the ruling [[Bourbon Democrat]]s. They must choose between trying to win the Negro votes or working to eliminate it entirely. The Tillman group in South Carolina sought the latter method. They were completely reactionary on the Negro question and stood with the Bourbons in disregarding the principles of the Fifteenth Amendment. Elsewhere the populists sought to win Negro votes, either through fusion with the Republican minority or through the raising of issues with a broad appeal to the Negro farmers. It was no accident that in the South the third-party movement was strongest in those states where it sought not only black votes but active black support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Rochester |first=Anna |year=1943 |title=The Populist Movement in the United States |location=New York |publisher=International Publishers |page=59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion that African Americans had somehow betrayed populism would haunt the Georgia People's Party from the very beginning. Populists had realized the political importance of blacks. Of the state's forty thousand Republicans voters, a considerable majority were former bondsmen. If the white votes were to split, they might decide the outcome of any state election. But therein lay a predicament. How were Populists to court the black votes without losing the whites? How were they to keep whites from supporting the "negro party"? An attempt had to be made to win over blacks. It was a risky scheme, but it contained a degree of precedent in state politics. In the 1870s and 1880s, democrats and independents had sometimes used the same device when the white votes splits. In those days many whites were willing to allow African American men the ballot, especially when it could be sometimes bought for so little.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Barton |first=C. Shaw |year=1947 |title=The Wool-Hat Boys – Georgia's Populist Party |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |page=78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Black populism was destroyed, marking the end of organized political resistance to the return of [[white supremacy]] in the South in the late 19th century. Nevertheless, black populism stood as the largest independent political uprising in the South until the modern [[Civil Rights]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Ali 2005, pp. 6–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the federal Government's primary [[litigation]] tool in combating fraud against the Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States ex rel. Steury v. Cardinal Health, Inc. |vol=625 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=262 |pinpoint=267 |court=[[5th Cir.]] |date=2010 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20101101082 |accessdate=2018-11-08 |quote=The FCA is the Government's primary litigation tool for recovering losses resulting from fraud.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The law includes a ''[[qui tam]]'' provision that allows people who are not affiliated with the government, called "relators" under the law, to file [[Lawsuit|actions]] on behalf of the government (informally called "[[whistleblower|whistleblowing]]" especially when the relator is employed by the organization accused in the suit).  Persons filing under the Act stand to receive a portion (usually about 15–25 percent) of any recovered [[damages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://constantinecannon.com/whistleblower/false-claims-act-2/|title=False Claims Act » Constantine Cannon|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2012, over 70 percent of all federal Government FCA actions were initiated by whistleblowers. Claims under the law have typically involved health care, military, or other government spending programs, and dominate the [[List of Largest Pharmaceutical Settlements|list of largest pharmaceutical settlements]].  The government recovered $38.9 billion under the False Claims Act between 1987 and 2013 and of this amount, $27.2 billion or 70% was from [[qui tam]] cases brought by relators.

==History==
''[[Qui tam]]'' laws have history dating back to the [[Middle Ages]] in [[England]].  In 1318, King [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] offered one third of the penalty to the relator when the relator successfully sued government officials who moonlighted as wine merchants.&lt;ref name=cdoyle&gt;[http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40785.pdf C. Doyle, writing for the Congressional Research Service (2009): "Qui Tam: The False Claims Act and Related Federal Statutes"]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Maintenance and Embracery Act 1540]] of [[Henry VIII]] provided that [[common informer]]s could sue for certain forms of interference with the course of justice in legal proceedings that were concerned with the title to land.&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission. Proposals to Abolish Certain Ancient Criminal Offences. HMSO. 1966. Paragraph 6(a) at page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This act is still in force today in the [[Republic of Ireland]], although in 1967 it was extinguished in England. The idea of a common informer bringing suit for damages to the Commonwealth was later brought to [[Massachusetts]], where "penalties for fraud in the sale of bread [are] to be distributed one third to inspector who discovered the fraud and the remainder for the benefit of the town where the offense occurred."&lt;ref name=cdoyle/&gt;  Other statutes can be found on the colonial law books of [[Connecticut]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Virginia]] and [[South Carolina]].&lt;ref name=cdoyle/&gt;

The [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865) was marked by fraud on all levels, both in the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] north and the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] south. During the war, unscrupulous contractors sold the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union Army]] decrepit horses and mules in ill health, faulty rifles and ammunition, and rancid rations and provisions, among other unscrupulous actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Larry D. |last=Lahman|title= "Bad Mules: A Primer on the Federal False Claims Act", 76 Okla. B. J. 901, 901 (2005) |url=https://www.michbar.org/journal/pdf/pdf4article1590.pdf|format=PDF|work=michbar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Congress passed the False Claims Act on March 2, 1863, {{USStat|12|696}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Hubbard v. United States|volume=514|page=695|pin=704|year=1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because it was passed under the administration of President [[Abraham Lincoln]], the False Claims Act is often referred to as the "Lincoln Law".&lt;ref name=whistleblowingprotection&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whistleblowingprotection.org/?q=node/69 | title=Qui Tam A History | publisher=Whistleblower Info | accessdate=2012-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Importantly, a reward was offered in what is called the ''[[qui tam]]'' provision, which permits citizens to sue on behalf of the government and be paid a percentage of the recovery. ''Qui tam'' is an abbreviated form of the Latin legal phrase ''qui tam pro domino rege quam pro se ipso in hac parte sequitur'' ("he who brings a case on behalf of our lord the King, as well as for himself")&lt;ref name=Vermont&gt;{{ussc|name=Vt. Agency of Natural Res. v. United States ex rel. Stevens|volume=529|page=765}}, 769 n.1 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''qui tam'' action, the citizen filing suit is called a "relator".&lt;ref&gt;("A ‘relator’ is ‘[a] party in interest who is permitted to institute a proceeding in the name of the People or the Attorney General when the right to sue resides solely in that official.’ Black's Law Dictionary 1289 (6th ed. 1990).")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A relator is one who relates the fraud action on behalf of the Government. See {{cite court |litigants=United States ex rel. Karvelas v. Melrose-Wakefield Hosp. |vol=360 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=220 |pinpoint=226 n.7 |court=[[1st Cir.]] |date=2004 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/360/220/484199/ |accessdate=2018-11-08 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As an exception to the general legal rule of [[standing (law)|standing]], courts have held that ''qui tam'' relators are "partially assigned" a portion of the government's legal injury, thereby allowing relators to proceed with their suits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1537749 See Nathan D. Sturycz, ''The King and I?: An Examination of the Interest Qui Tam Relators Represent and the Implications for Future False Claims Act Litigation'', 28 St. Louis Pub. L. Rev. 459 (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Jacob M. Howard]], who sponsored the legislation, justified giving rewards to whistle blowers, many of whom had engaged in unethical activities themselves. He said, "I have based the [''qui tam'' provision] upon the old-fashioned idea of holding out a temptation, and ‘setting a rogue to catch a rogue,’ which is the safest and most expeditious way I have ever discovered of bringing rogues to justice."&lt;ref&gt;''Vt. Agency of Natural Res. v. United States ex rel. Stevens'', 529 U.S. at 769 n.1; see also {{cite web|title=When Bad Things Happen to Good Rogues|url=https://psmag.com/news/when-bad-things-happen-to-good-rogues-11512|publisher=Pacific Standard|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the massive military spending leading up to and during [[World War II]], the [[United States Attorney General|US Attorney General]] relied on criminal provisions of the law to deal with fraud, rather than using the FCA.  As a result, attorneys would wait for the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] to file criminal cases and then immediately file civil suits under the FCA, a practice decried as "parasitic" at the time.  Congress moved to abolish the FCA but at the last minute decided instead to reduce the relator's share of the recovered proceeds.&lt;ref name=Helmer/&gt;{{rp|1267–1271}}&lt;ref name=CongResServ&gt;Charles Doyle, Senior Specialist in American Public Law, for the Congressional Research Service. August 6, 2009 [http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40785.pdf Qui Tam: The False Claims Act and Related Federal Statutes]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}

The law was again amended in 1986, again due to issues with military spending. Under President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s military buildup, reports of massive fraud among military contractors had become major news, and Congress acted to strengthen the FCA.&lt;ref name=Helmer&gt;James B. Helmer Jr., [http://scholarship.law.uc.edu/uclr/vol81/iss4/3 False Claims Act: Incentivizing Integrity for 150 Years for Rogues, Privateers, Parasites and Patriots] 81 U. Cin. L. Rev.(2013)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1271–77}}

The law has always primarily been used against [[defense contractor]]s but by the late 1990s, [[health care fraud]] began to receive more focus, accounting for approximately 40% of recoveries by 2008&lt;ref name=Helmer/&gt;{{rp|1271}}   ''[[Franklin v. Parke-Davis]]'', filed in 1996, was the first case to apply the FCA to fraud committed against the government, due to bills submitted for payment by [[Medicaid]]/[[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] for treatments that those programs do not pay for as they are not FDA-approved or otherwise listed on a government formulary.  FCA cases in the field of health care are often related to [[off-label]] marketing of [[pharmaceutical drug|drugs]] by drug companies, which is illegal under a different law, the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]]; the intersection occurs when off-label marketing leads to prescriptions being filled and bills for those prescriptions being submitted to Medicare/Medicaid.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph JN, et al. [http://www.postschell.com/site/files/415.pdf Enforcement Related to Off-Label Marketing and Use of Drugs and Devices: Where Have We Been and Where Are We Going?] Journal of Health &amp; Life Sciences Law 2(2):73-108.  January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, over 70 percent of all federal FCA actions were initiated by whistleblowers.&lt;ref name=Hesch&gt;Joel D Hesch. [http://www.cooley.edu/lawreview/_docs/2012/vol29/2/Hesch.pdf Breaking the Siege: Restoring Equity and Statutory Intent to the Process of Determining Qui Tam Relator Awards Under the False Claims Act], Thomas M.

==Provisions==
The Act establishes liability when any person or entity improperly receives from or avoids payment to the Federal government ([[tax fraud]] is excepted). The Act prohibits: 
# Knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented a false claim for payment or approval;
# Knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim;
# [[Conspiracy (civil)|Conspiring]] to commit any violation of the False Claims Act;
# Falsely certifying the type or amount of property to be used by the Government;
# Certifying receipt of property on a document without completely knowing that the information is true;
# Knowingly buying Government property from an unauthorized officer of the Government, and;
# Knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record to avoid, or decrease an obligation to pay or transmit property to the Government.

Certain claims are not actionable, including:
# certain actions against armed forces members, members of the [[United States Congress]], members of the [[judiciary]], or senior [[executive branch]] officials;&lt;ref name="taflaws3730"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://quitamguide.org/federal-false-claims-act-title-31#3730 | title=Federal False Claims Act – 31 U.S.C. § 3730(e)(1) and (2) | publisher=Qui Tam Guide | accessdate=2008-05-04 }} ({{usc|31|3730}})&lt;/ref&gt;
# claims, records, or statements made under the [[Internal Revenue Code of 1986]] which would include tax fraud;&lt;ref name="taflaws3729"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://quitamguide.org/federal-false-claims-act-title-31#3729e | title=Federal False Claims Act – 31 U.S.C. § 3729(e) | publisher=Qui Tam Guide | accessdate=2008-05-04 }} ({{usc|31|3729}})&lt;/ref&gt;

There are unique procedural requirements in False Claims Act cases.  For example:
# a complaint under the False Claims Act must be filed under seal;&lt;ref name="31 U.S.C. § 3730b2"&gt;31 U.S.C. § 3730(b)(2).&lt;/ref&gt;
# the complaint must be served on the government but must not be served on the defendant;&lt;ref name="31 U.S.C. § 3730b2"/&gt;
# the complaint must be buttressed by a comprehensive memorandum, not filed in court, but served on the government detailing the factual underpinnings of the complaint.&lt;ref&gt;The FCA requires each relator to supply the Government with a statement of material evidence ("SME") containing all information and documents they possess that support the FCA allegations. 31 U.S.C. § 3730(b)(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the FCA contains an anti-retaliation provision, which allows a relator to recover, in addition to his award for reporting fraud, double damages plus attorney fees for any acts of retaliation for reporting fraud against the Government.&lt;ref&gt;31 U.S.C. § 3730(h). To prevail on a § 3730(h) retaliation claim, the relator must establish these three elements: (1) the employee was engaging in conduct protected by the FCA, (2) the employer knew the employee was engaging in protected conduct, and (3) the employer discriminated against the employee because of his or her protected conduct. Id.&lt;/ref&gt; This provision specifically provides relators with a personal claim of double damages for harm suffered and reinstatement.&lt;ref&gt;31 U.S.C. § 3730(h).&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the False Claims Act, the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] is authorized to pay rewards to those who report fraud against the federal government and are not convicted of a crime related to the fraud, in an amount of between 15 and 25 (but up to 30 percent in some cases) of what it recovers based upon the whistleblower's report.&lt;ref name=Hesch/&gt;{{rp|219}}  The relator's share is determined based on the FCA itself, legislative history, Department of Justice guidelines released in 1997, and court decisions.&lt;ref&gt;John C.

== 2009 changes ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of United States federal legislation]] --&gt;
{{main article|Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009}}

On May 20, 2009, the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (FERA) was signed into law.  It includes the most significant amendments to the FCA since the 1986 amendments.  FERA enacted the following changes:

# Expanded the scope of potential FCA liability by eliminating the "presentment" requirement (effectively overruling the Supreme Court's opinion in ''[[Allison Engine Co. v. United States ex rel. Sanders]]'', 128 S. Ct. 2123 (2008));
# Redefined "claim" under the FCA to mean "any request or demand, whether under a contract or otherwise for money or property and whether or not the United States has title to the money or property" that is (1) presented directly to the United States, or (2) "to a contractor, grantee, or other recipient, if the money or property is to be spent or used on the Government's behalf or to advance a Government program or interest" and the government provides or reimburses any portion of the requested funds;
# Amended the FCA's intent requirement, and now requiring only that a false statement be "material to" a false claim;
# Expanded conspiracy liability for any violation of the provisions of the FCA;
# Amended the "reverse false claims" provisions to expand liability to "knowingly and improperly avoid[ing] or decreas[ing] an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the Government;"
# Increased protection for qui tam plaintiffs/relators beyond employees, to include contractors and agents;
# Procedurally, the government's complaint will now relate back to the qui tam plaintiff/relator's filing;
# Provided that whenever a state or local government is named as a co-plaintiff in an action, the government or the relator "shall not [be] preclude[d]... from serving the complaint, any other pleadings, or the written disclosure of substantially all material evidence;"
# Increased the [[Attorney General]]'s power to delegate authority to conduct Civil Investigative Demands prior to intervening in an FCA action.

With this revision, the FCA now prohibits knowingly (changes are in bold):

# Submitting for payment or reimbursement a claim known to be false or fraudulent.
# Making or using a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or to an ‘obligation’ to pay money to the government.
# Engaging in a conspiracy to defraud by the improper submission of a false claim.
# Concealing, improperly avoiding or decreasing an ‘obligation’ to pay money to the government.

== 2010 changes under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ==

On March 23, 2010, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (also referred to as the health reform bill or PPACA) was signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]].  The Affordable Care Act made further amendments to the False Claims Act, including:

# '''Changes to the Public Disclosure Bar.''' Under the previous version of the FCA, cases filed by private individuals or "relators" could be barred if it was determined that such cases were based on a public disclosure of information arising from certain proceedings, such as civil, criminal or administrative hearings, or news media reports.  As a result, defendants frequently used the public disclosure bar as a defense to a plaintiff's claims and grounds for dismissal of the same. PPACA amended the language of the FCA to allow the federal government to have the final word on whether a court may dismiss a case based on a public disclosure.  The language now provides that "the court shall dismiss an action unless opposed by the Government, if substantially the same allegations or transaction alleged in the action or claim were publicly disclosed."  ''See'' 31 U.S.C. 3730(e)(4)(A).
# '''Original Source Requirement'''. A plaintiff may overcome the public disclosure bar outlined above if they qualify as an "original source," the definition of which has also been revised by PPACA.  Previously, an original source must have had "direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based."  Under PPACA, an original source is now someone who has "knowledge that is independent of and materially adds to the publicly disclosed allegations or transactions." See 31 U.S.C. 3730(e)(4)(B).
# '''Overpayments'''. FERA redefined "obligation" under the FCA to include "retention of any overpayments."  Accordingly, such language imposed FCA liability on any provider who received Medicare/Medicaid overpayments (accidentally or otherwise) and fails to return the money to the government.  However, FERA also raised questions as to what exactly is involved in the "retention of overpayments" – for example, how long a provider had to return monies after discovering an overpayment.  PPACA clarified the changes to the FCA made by FERA.  Under PPACA, overpayments under Medicare and Medicaid must be reported and returned within 60 days of discovery, or the date a corresponding hospital report is due.  Failure to timely report and return an overpayment exposes a provider to liability under the FCA.
# '''Statutory Anti-Kickback Liability'''. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b) (AKS) is a criminal statute which makes it improper for anyone to solicit, receive, offer or pay remuneration (monetary or otherwise) in exchange for referring patients to receive certain services that are paid for by the government.  Previously, many courts had interpreted the FCA to mean that claims submitted as a result of AKS violations were false claims and therefore gave rise to FCA liability (in addition to AKS penalties).  However, although this was the "majority rule" among courts, there were always opportunities for courts to hold otherwise. Importantly, PPACA changed the language of the AKS to provide that claims submitted in violation of the AKS automatically constitute false claims for purposes of the FCA.  Further, the new language of the AKS provides that "a person need not have actual knowledge … or specific intent to commit a violation" of the AKS.  Accordingly, providers will not be able to successfully argue that they did not know they were violating the FCA because they were not aware the AKS existed.

==Practical application of the law==
The False Claims Act has a detailed process for making a claim under the Act. Mere complaints to the government agency are insufficient to bring claims under the Act.  A complaint (lawsuit)
must be filed in [[U.S. District Court]] (federal court) in camera (under seal). After an investigation by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] within 60 days, or frequently several months after an extension is granted, the Department of Justice decides whether it will pursue the case.

If the case is pursued, the amount of the reward is less than if the Department of Justice decides not to pursue the case and the plaintiff/relator continues the lawsuit himself.  However, the success rate is higher in cases that the Department of Justice decides to pursue.

Technically, the government has several options in handing cases.  These include: 
# intervene in one or more counts of the pending qui tam action. This intervention expresses the Government's intention to participate as a plaintiff in prosecuting that count of the complaint. Fewer than 25% of filed qui tam actions result in an intervention on any count by the Department of Justice.
# decline to intervene in one or all counts of the pending qui tam action. If the United States declines to intervene, the relator may prosecute the action on behalf of the United States, but the United States is not a party to the proceedings apart from its right to any recovery. This option is frequently used by relators and their attorneys.
# move to dismiss the relator's complaint, either because there is no case, or the case conflicts with significant statutory or policy interests of the United States.

In practice, there are two other options for the Department of Justice:
# settle the pending qui tam action with the defendant prior to the intervention decision. This usually, but not always, results in a simultaneous intervention and settlement with the Department of Justice (and is included in the 25% intervention rate).
# advise the relator that the Department of Justice intends to decline intervention.  &lt;!-- Comment out newline to have article match the citation). --&gt;This usually, but not always, results in dismissal of the qui tam action, according to the U.S. Attorneys' Office of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/pae/Documents/fcaprocess2.pdf False Claims Act Cases: Government intervention in Qui Tam (whistleblower) suits – Memo of the U.S. Attorneys' Office of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania &lt;!-- Note: much of the above is copied verbatim from the (PD-USGov) source. --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
There is case law where claims may be prejudiced if disclosure of the alleged unlawful act has been reported in the press, if complaints were filed to an agency instead of filing a lawsuit, or if the person filing a claim under the act is not the first person to do so.  Individual states in the U.S. have different laws regarding whistleblowing involving state governments.

===Federal income taxation of awards under FCA in the United States===
The U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) takes the position that, for Federal income tax purposes, ''qui tam'' payments to a relator under FCA are [[ordinary income]] and not [[capital gain]]s. The IRS position was challenged by a relator in the case of ''Alderson v. United States''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Alderson v. United States |vol=686 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=791 |pinpoint= |court=[[9th Cir.]] |date=2012 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20120718127 |accessdate=2018-11-08 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the IRS' stance. As of 2013, this remained the only circuit court decision on tax treatment of these payments.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Wood and Dashiell C. Shapiro [http://www.woodllp.com/Publications/Articles/pdf/Blowing_the_Whistle.pdf Blowing the Whistle on Taxing Whistleblower Recoveries] Tax Notes, December 2, 2013. pp. 983-988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevant decisions by the United States Supreme Court==

In a 2000 case, ''[[Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens]]'', 529 U.S. 765 (2000),&lt;ref name=Vermont/&gt; the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] held that a private individual may not bring suit in federal court on behalf of the United States against a State (or state agency) under the FCA.  In ''Stevens'', the Supreme Court also endorsed the "partial assignment" approach to ''qui tam'' relator [[standing (law)|standing]] to sue, which had previously been articulated by the Ninth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals and is an exception to the general legal rule for standing.&lt;ref name=Vermont/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1537749 Nathan D. Sturycz, ''The King and I?: An Examination of the Interest Qui Tam Relators Represent and the Implications for Future False Claims Act Litigation'' 28 St. Louis Pub. L. Rev. 459 (2009).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the general standing rule, ''see'' [[Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife]], 504 U.S. 555 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 case, ''[[Rockwell International Corp. v. United States]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] considered several issues relating to the "original source" exception to the FCA's public-disclosure bar.  The Court held that (1) the original source requirement of the FCA provision setting for the original-source exception to the public-disclosure bar on federal-court jurisdiction is jurisdictional; (2) the statutory phrase "information on which the allegations are based" refers to the relator's allegations and not the publicly disclosed allegations; the terms "allegations" is not limited to the allegations in the original complaint, but includes, at a minimum, the allegations in the original complaint as amended; (3) relator's knowledge with respect to the pondcrete fell short of the direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based required for him to qualify as an original source; and (4) the government's intervention did not provide an independent basis of jurisdiction with respect to the relator.

In a 2008 case, ''[[Allison Engine Co. v. United States ex rel. Sanders]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] considered whether a false claim had to be presented directly to the Federal government, or if it merely needed to be paid with government money, such as a false claim by a [[subcontractor]] to a prime contractor.  The Court found that the claim need not be presented directly to the government, but that the false statement must be made with the intention that it will be relied upon by the government in paying, or approving payment of, a claim.&lt;ref&gt;Opinion of the Court, [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-214.pdf Allison Engine Co. v. United States ex rel. Sanders], 553 U. S. __ (2008), part II(C).&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009]] reversed the Court's decision and made the types of fraud to which the False Claims Act applies more explicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Senate Report 111-10, part III | quote = This section amends the FCA to clarify and correct erroneous interpretations of the law that were decided in ''Allison Engine Co. v.

In a 2009 case, ''[[United States ex rel. Eisenstein v. City of New York]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court Of The United States.  United States Ex Rel. Eisenstein v. City of New York, New York, et al.  Certiorari To The United States Court Of Appeals for the Second Circuit No. 08–660. Argued April 21, 2009. Decided June 8, 2009. [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/08pdf/08-660.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] considered whether, when the government declines to intervene or otherwise actively participate in a ''qui tam'' action under the False Claims Act, the United States is a "party" to the suit for purposes of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(A) (which requires that a notice of appeal in a federal civil action generally be filed within 30 days after entry of a judgment or order from which the appeal is taken).  The Court held that when the United States has declined to intervene in a privately initiated FCA action, it is not a "party" for FRAP 4 purposes, and therefore, petitioner's appeal filed after 30 days was untimely.

In a 2016 case, ''[[Universal Health Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court Of The United States.  Universal Health Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar.  Certiorari To The United States Court Of Appeals for the First Circuit No. 15–7. Argued April 19, 2016. Decided June 16, 2016 [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-7_a074.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] sought to clarify the standard for materiality under the FCA.  The court unanimously upheld the implied certification theory of FCA liability and strengthened the FCA’s materiality requirement.

==State False Claims Acts and application in other jurisdictions==
As of 2014, thirty states and the District of Columbia have also created false-claims statutes to protect their publicly funded programs from fraud by including [[qui tam]] provisions, which enables them to recover money at state level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://constantinecannon.com/whistleblower/state-local-false-claims-acts/|title=State and Local False Claims Acts » Constantine Cannon|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TAFstate&gt;Taxpayers Against Fraud Education Fund [http://www.taf.org/success-at-state-level Success At The State Level]  Page accessed August 9, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James F.

The [[California False Claims Act]] was enacted in 1987, but lay relatively dormant until the early 1990s, when public entities, frustrated by what they viewed as a barrage of unjustified and unmeritorious claims, began to employ the False Claims Act as a defensive measure.&lt;ref&gt;James W.

The paper asserts that serious and organised crime costs the UK more than £24 billion a year. In the context of anti-corruption, the paper acknowledges that there is a need to not only target serious and organised criminals but also support those who seek to help identify and disrupt serious and organised criminality. Three UK agencies, the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills, the Ministry of Justice and the Home Office have been tasked with considering the case for a US-style False Claims Act in the UK.&lt;ref name=SeriousPlan/&gt;

Specifically, the suit alleged that OMJPI "illegally marketed [[Topamax]] by, among other things, promoting the sale and use of Topamax for a variety of psychiatric conditions other than those for which its use was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, (i.e., "[[off-label]]" uses)."  It also states that "certain of these uses were not medically accepted indications for which State Medicaid programs provided coverage" and that as a result "OMJPI knowingly caused false or fraudulent claims for Topamax to be submitted to, or caused purchase by, certain federally funded healthcare programs.&lt;ref name=TopamaxPR/&gt;

In response to a complaint from whistleblower Jerry H. Brown II, the US Government filed suit against [[Maersk]] for overcharging for shipments to US forces fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.  In a settlement announced on 3 January 2012, the company agreed to pay $31.9 million in fines and interest, but made no admission of wrongdoing.  Brown was entitled to $3.6 million of the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Bob, Egelko for the San Francisco Chronicle January 4, 2012  [http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Maersk-Line-to-pay-US-31-9-million-in-settlement-2439693.php "$31.9 Million Settlement In Shipping Suit]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Justice Press Release.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6152">[[Image:Frankfurt Palais Thurn und Taxis Portal.jpg|thumb|Palais ''Thurn und Taxis'' in [[Free City of Frankfurt|Frankfurt]] was the seat of the Federal Convention of the German Confederation]]
The '''Federal Convention''' (or ''Confederate Diet'' {{lang-de|Bundesversammlung or Bundestag}}) was the only central institution of the [[German Confederation]] from 1815 until 1848, and from 1850 until 1866. The Federal Assembly had its seat in the ''[[Palais Thurn und Taxis]]'' in [[Free City of Frankfurt|Frankfurt]]. It was organized as a permanent congress of envoys.

The German Confederation and its Federal Assembly came into existence as a result of the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 after the defeat of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]. The original task was to create a new constitutional structure for Germany after the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] eight years before. The princes of the German states wanted to keep their sovereignty, therefore the German Confederation was created as a loose confederation of independent monarchist states, but included four free cities as well. The founding act was the ''[[Constitution of the German Confederation|German Federal Act]]'' of June 8, 1815 ([[German language|German]]: ''Deutsche Bundesakte''&lt;ref name="Bundesakte1815"&gt;[http://www.documentarchiv.de/nzjh/dtba.html Deutsche Bundesakte 1815] - ''German Federal Act'', 1815&lt;/ref&gt;), which was part of the treaty of the Congress of Vienna.

The Federal Assembly was created as a permanent congress of envoys of all member states, which replaced the former imperial central power of the Holy Roman Empire. The Federal Assembly took its seat at the ''Palais Thurn und Taxis'' in [[Free City of Frankfurt|Frankfurt]], where it met once a week after November 5, 1816.

The Federal Assembly was presided over by the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] delegate and consisted of two executive bodies: the inner council and the plenary session. Its members were not elected, neither by popular vote nor by state parliaments (which even didn't exist in some member states), but had been appointed by the state governments or by the state's prince.

The inner council consisted of 17 envoys (one seat each for the 11 larger states, 5 seats for the 23 smaller states and one seat for the four free cities). The inner council determined the legislative agenda and decided which issues should be discussed by the plenary session. Decisions of the inner circle initially required an absolute majority, but in 1822 unanimous consent was required for all decisions to have force.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Sybel, ''The Founding of the German Empire by William I.'', 1880, Vol. 1, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plenary session had 69 seats, according roughly to the state's sizes. The plenary session was involved especially in decisions regarding constitutional changes, which initially required a majority of 2/3 of the plenary session but was also changed to unanimous consent.

The decisions of the Federal Assembly had been mandatory for the member states, but the execution of those decisions remained under the control of each member state. As well, the member states remained fully sovereign regarding customs, police, and military.

Until the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]] of 1848 and again since 1851 the Federal Assembly of the German Confederation was the main instrument of the reactionary forces of Germany to suppress democracy, liberalism and nationalism. For example, during 1835/36, the Federal Assembly decreed rules for censorship, which banned the works of [[Heinrich Heine]] and other authors in all states of the German Confederation.

After the March Revolution of 1848, the Federal Assembly of the German Confederation was challenged by the newly formed [[Frankfurt Parliament|National Assembly]], which began its sittings in Frankfurt on 18 May 1848. On 28 June, the National Assembly decided to created a provisional government for all of Germany prior to the creation of a Constitution. On 29 June, they elected [[Archduke John of Austria]] to be the Regent of the [[Provisorische_Zentralgewalt|Provisional Central Power]].

At noon on 12 July 1848, the Federal Assembly handed over its responsibilities to the Regent and formally dissolved itself. The act lent legitimacy and, at least in theory, legally binding authority to the new office. However, the Regent refused to employ his powers and remained passive during this period. The National Assembly lost prestige and was closed on 19 June 1849. The Regent resigned his office on 20 December 1849, though not before transferring all responsibilities of the provisional government to Austria and Prussia on 30 September.

Prussia spent the next year challenging Austria's claims to supremacy in Germany, but on 30 November 1850 the [[Punctuation of Olmütz]] forced Prussia to abandon its proposal to alter Germany's political composition in its favor. By that time, all of the states in Germany had suppressed their Constitutions, popularly elected parliaments, and democratic clubs, thus erasing all work of the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;William Nassau Sr., ''Journals Kept in France and Italy from 1848 to 1852 with a Sketch of the Revolutions of 1848''. Henry S. King &amp; Co., 1871, page 239.&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 May 1851, the old Confederate Diet was reopened in the Thurn and Taxis Palace.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Eugene Little, ''Cyclopedia of Classified Dates: With an Exhaustive Index'', 1900, page 819.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Assembly was dissolved after the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, the terms being dictated by the [[Peace_of_Prague_(1866)|Peace of Prague]] on 23 August 1866. Although the [[North German Confederation]] was legally not the successor of the German Confederation, the new [[Federal Council of Germany|Federal Council (Bundesrat)]] could be seen as a kind of replacement for the Federal Assembly.

[[File:United Provinces of China stamp (1912).png|thumb|right|An early [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] stamp (1912) carried the English name "United Provinces of China"]]

'''Chinese federalism''' refers to political theories which argue that [[China]]'s central government should share [[sovereignty]] with regional entities, under a form of [[federalism]]. Such proposals were made in the early twentieth century, in connection with the end of the [[Qing dynasty]]; as well as recently, with a view to providing [[Separation of powers#Checks_and_balances|checks]] against the power of the central government, as well as settling the relationship between the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], and other potential political entities.

[[Wu Bangguo]], who used to be the official number two in China's leadership structure, said in 2011 there will be no federal system in China. "There would be no separation of powers between the different branches of government and no federal system" he said. "It is possible that the state could sink into the abyss of internal disorder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12697997 |work=BBC News |title=Chinese leader rules out democracy |first=Michael |last=Bristow |date=10 March 2011 |publisher=British Broadcasting Corp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nationalist-era proposals==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:upcbond.png|thumb|right|A 5 Yuan Fractional Debenture Bond of Huángdi era (黃帝紀元 / 黄帝纪元) 4609 (1911) issued by Shanghai Military Government carried the English name "United Provinces of China"]] --&gt;
The [[Revive China Society]], founded in November 1894 by [[Sun Yat-Sen]], was among the first to suggest that a future Chinese government should be established on federal lines—a feeling expressed in the organisation's oath, "Expel [[Manchu|the northern barbarians]], revive [[Huaxia|Zhonghua]], and establish a unified (''hézhòng'') government".  The term ''hézhòng'', literally meaning "many unified as one", refers to a federal structure such as the [[United States|United States of America]].

During the [[Xinhai Revolution]] (1911), fourteen provinces proclaimed independence from the Qing dynasty and reunited as the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. But when the Guizhou Provincial Consultative Council proclaimed independence, they asked to build the '''Great Han Federal Democratic Republic'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Chang Peng-yuan |title=Constitutionalists and the Revolution of 1911 in China |location=Taipei |publisher=Institute of Modern History, Academia Sinica |year=2005 |edition=3rd |pages=155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to January 1912, one semi-official translation of the country's new name used by revolutional Shanghai Military Government was the '''United Provinces of China.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/12/28/104846372.pdf |title=Accept Sun as Leader. |newspaper=The New York Times |date=28 December 1911 |format=PDF}} {{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E02E4D91231E233A2575BC2A9649D946096D6CF |newspaper=The New York Times |date=28 December 1911 |title=Accept Sun as Leader.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sun Yat-sen's title in 1912 was "President of the Provisional Government of the United Provinces of China".&lt;ref&gt;'''[[Wikisource]]''': {{cite journal |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_New_Student%27s_Reference_Work/China |work=The New Student's Reference Work |title=China |publisher=F.

Compton and Company |year=1914 |first1=Chandler B. |last1=Beach |first2=Frank Morton |last2=McMurry |location=Chicago |volume= I: A—CZER}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese federalists from this period often used "United Provinces" instead of "Federation" or "United States" because "states" suggested a more independent arrangement than "provinces." In other words, they wished to avoid the impression that federalism implied [[separatism]].

Proposals for a federal Chinese state were first advanced in the 1920s, but these proved unpopular. These often used the phrase '''United Autonomous Provinces''' as the name of the intended system.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} [[Hunan]] was the center of this movement. The young [[Mao Zedong]] even advocated the formation of a "Republic of Hunan" during that period. But many intellectuals, including Sun Yat-sen, argued that these proposals would limit the ability of China to fight off external invasion and would legitimize the rule of [[warlord]]s.

==Communist-era developments==

After [[Chinese Communism|Chinese Communists]] established the [[Jiangxi Soviet|Chinese Soviet Republic]] in [[Jiangxi]], they aimed at a political system modeled after the [[union republic]]s of the [[Soviet Union]]. According to their plans, China was to be a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] federal republic with several autonomous republics (such as Mongolia, Turkestan, and Tibet). During the period of the [[Long March]] they established a small [[autonomy|autonomous]] republic for Tibetans in [[Sichuan]]. In [[Shaanxi]], however, they changed their nationality policy, abandoning their plan to establish autonomous republics (as in the Soviet Union) in favor of autonomous regions. The first of these to be created was [[Inner Mongolia]] in 1947.

When the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, it was divided into six semi-independent [[greater administrative area]]s. The central government was transferred from the People's Government of North China and just controlled northern China and Inner Mongolia. Other [[greater administrative area]]s had more autonomy. This autonomy had ended completely by 1954.

More recently, some economists have argued that during the process of [[Chinese economic reform]] that the People's Republic has evolved into a de facto federal state in which provinces have wide discretion to implement policy goals which are set by the PRC central government and in which provinces and localities actively compete with each other in order to advance economically.&lt;ref name="uc"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Usman W. Chohan |date=June 2014 |title=Fiscal Decentralization and Local Government Bonds in China –财政分权, 地方政府债务 |journal = McGill University Economic Publications|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/channels/news/fiscal-decentralization-and-local-government-bonds-china-%E2%80%93%E8%B4%A2%E6%94%BF%E5%88%86%E6%9D%83-%E5%9C%B0%E6%96%B9%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E5%80%BA%E5%8A%A1-237127}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a 2004 study conducted by [[Bo Zhiyue]], Chair of the Department of International Studies at the [[St. John Fisher College]], provincial authorities have greater institutional power than central institutions. Bo concluded that after the [[16th Party Congress]], due to personnel transfers between the provinces and the centre, the central authorities emerged more powerful, but was still shy of outpowering the provincial authorities on his power index score.&lt;ref name="bz"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bo Zhiyue |date=May 2004 |title=The 16th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party: formal institutions and factional groups |journal=Journal of Contemporary China |volume= 13 |issue= 39 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a713622595&amp;db=all|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121203232806/http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a713622595&amp;db=all|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future proposals==
===Charter 08===

[[Charter 08]], one of the authors of which is [[human rights activist]] and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Liu Xiaobo]], calls for the establishment of a Chinese "Federal Republic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/jailedappeals-01042010160430.html |work=Radio Free Asia |title=Jailed Dissident Appeals |date=4 January 2010 |author=Ding Xiao}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relevant proposal states:

''"A Federated Republic. A democratic China should seek to act as a responsible major power contributing toward peace and development in the Asian Pacific region by approaching others in a spirit of equality and fairness. In Hong Kong and Macao, we should support the freedoms that already exist. With respect to Taiwan, we should declare our commitment to the principles of freedom and democracy and then, negotiating as equals and ready to compromise, seek a formula for peaceful unification. We should approach disputes in the national-minority areas of China with an open mind, seeking ways to find a workable framework within which all ethnic and religious groups can flourish. We should aim ultimately at a federation of democratic communities of China."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/jan/15/chinas-charter-08/ |title=China’s Charter 08 |work=The New York Review of Books |date=15 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of late 2010, Charter 08 has already been signed by more than 10,000 people both inside and outside China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/21/opinion/21iht-edhavel.html?_r=1 |newspaper=The New York Times |title=A Nobel Prize for a Chinese Dissident |date=20 September 2010 |first1=Vaclav |last1=Havel |first2=Dana |last2=Nemcova |first3=Vaclav |last3=Maly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Federal Republic of China"===

A '''Federal Republic of China''' is a proposed future [[federal republic]] encompassing [[mainland China]], [[Macau]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Taiwan]]. This "Third Republic" (following on from the [[Republic of China#Republican China.2C 1911-1949|Republic of China]] and the [[People's Republic of China]]) is proposed by supporters of the [[International Tibet Independence Movement|Tibet independence movement]], although it would not in effect create an independent Tibet. [[Yan Jiaqi]], writing for the Tibetan government in exile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tibet.com/China/fedchina.html |title=Towards the Federal Republic of China |work=The Government of Tibet in Exile |author=Yan Jiaqi |accessdate=18 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224215225/http://www.tibet.com/China/fedchina.html |archivedate=24 February 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has written that:
[[File:Flag of China (1912–1928).svg|thumb|right|Proposed flag for a Federal Republic of China,  identical to the [[Five Races Under One Union]] flag, used as a national flag from the inception of the First Republic in 1912 until the demise of the [[warlord era|warlord]] government in 1928.]]

''"It would be a federation with the characteristics of a confederation. Federal China would consist of two kinds of republics: 'loose republics' such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, Tibet, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang: and 'close republics' consisting the rest of China."''

According to Yan:

''"They would differ from the existing federal countries in their defence, taxation and legal systems"''

This model, however, in which the close republics would have an arrangement based on the [[United States|United States of America]], and the loose republics more on the [[European Union]], is not agreed upon by all advocates of a Federal Republic.

==="United China" or "United States of China"===

Another concept is that of a '''United China''' or a '''United States of China'''.  First devised in the early 1920s by [[Chen Jiongming]], it was modeled closely after the [[United States|United States of America]].  Given the political, social and linguistic realities of China in the [[warlord]] period, Chen Jiongming believed that a federalist approach was the only feasible way to eventually establish a united, [[democratic republic]].  Beginning with [[Guangdong]] as a model state, he wanted to organize a "United States of China in the manner of the American experience" through negotiation with federalists from all parts of the country (New York Times June 27, 1922).

This usage was popularized after Chinese president [[Jiang Zemin]] in 2001 made a comment that a united China can adopt a new national name and flag.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source|date=July 2016}}  Large economic ties between China and Taiwan have also motivated the occasional informal use of the term to describe a united China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/magazine/business/0,8782,165847,00.html |title=The United States of China: How business is moving Taipei and Beijing together |first=Allen T |last=Cheng |accessdate=18 April 2007 |work=Asia Week |publisher=Time |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406224643/http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/magazine/business/0,8782,165847,00.html |archivedate=April 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of [[Special Economic Zones of the People's Republic of China|Special Economic Zones]] since the 1980s have led to the development of several distinct regional economies within the [[People's Republic of China]], such as the [[Pearl River Delta]], [[Yangtze River Delta]], and the [[Bohai Rim]].  Several of these regions have economies the size of small developed nations. Some scholars who use the term United States of China argue that during the process of [[Chinese economic reform]] the People's Republic has evolved into a de facto federal state in which these economic regions have wide discretion to implement policy goals which are set by the PRC central government and in which provinces and localities actively compete with each other in order to advance economically.

==="United Republics of China"===

[[File:Gomberg map.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Gomberg's map]]
The concept of a '''United Republics of China''' first appeared in the fantastic [[Outline of the Post-War New World Map|"Outline of (the) Post-War New World Map"]]. Published in Philadelphia in early 1942, this map - created by Maurice Gomberg - shows a proposal to re-arrange the world after an Allied victory against the Axis forces. In the map the United Republics of China (URC) includes most parts of present-day China, Korea, the erstwhile French colony of Indochina (now Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia), Thailand and Malaya. Otherwise, North Manchuria and Mongolia belong to the USSR; Taiwan and Hainan become territories of the USA.

In 2004, Lin Chong-Pin, former deputy [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Minister of Defense]] of the ROC, said that a [[think tank]] in Beijing or Shanghai gave a proposal for '''United Republics of China'''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2004/new/oct/9/today-fo5.htm |script-title=zh:北京智庫促統 推銷新國號 |trans-title=New Chinese formal name proposed by think tank of Beijing |author=Cao Yufen |accessdate=9 October 2004 |location=Taiwan |work=Liberty Times |date=9 September 2004 |language=zh |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050116215539/http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2004/new/oct/9/today-fo5.htm |archivedate=16 January 2005 |df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt; None of this proposal has become public. But in the same years{{when|date=April 2013}} the officials and think-tanks of the PRC have often shown an interest in the 1964 merger of mainland Tanganyika and the archipelago of Zanzibar to form the [[United Republic of Tanzania]]. As [[Zanzibar]] has its own president, government, parliament, autonomy, etc. and the president of Zanzibar served as the vice-president of Tanzania until the first Multiparty elections in 1995, Tanzania may have provided an examplar of [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s proposals for "[[One country, two systems]]" in China in the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In 2011, Li Yi-hu, director of Institute of International Politics, University of Peking, said that Tanzania and Zanzibar, the model of "One country, two constitutions", could be referring to "One China, two constitutions".&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:The Courtyard, NLB Bldg.JPG|thumb|right|300px|[[National Library, Singapore]]]]
A '''green library''' is designed to minimize negative impact on the natural environment and maximize indoor environmental quality by means of careful site selection, use of natural construction materials and biodegradable products, conservation of resources (water, energy, paper), and responsible waste disposal (recycling, etc.). In new construction and library renovation, sustainability is increasingly achieved through [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) certification, a rating system developed and administered by the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] (USGBC).&lt;ref&gt;The Online Dictionary of Library and Information Science (ODLIS)&lt;/ref&gt;

Green libraries are a part of the larger [[green building]] movement. Also known as sustainable libraries, green libraries are being built all over the world,&lt;ref&gt;Stoss, F. (2010). Libraries Taking the `LEED': Green Libraries Leading in Energy and Environmental Design. ''ONLINE -WESTON THEN WILTON-'', (2). 20.&lt;/ref&gt; with many high-profile projects bringing the concept into the mainstream. Along with [[library 2.0]], [[green design]] is an emerging trend, defining the [[library]] of the 21st century. Many view the library as having a unique role in the green building movement due to its [[altruistic]] mission, public and pedagogical nature, and the fact that new libraries are usually high profile, community driven projects.

==What makes a library green?==
There are many ways to define a green library, but there are a number of central themes that run through all of them, including, minimizing the negative impact the building will have on the local environment, and if possible having a positive impact. Reducing the use of water and energy by designing in a way that maximizes the use of natural and renewable resources. Integrating actual greenery and vegetation into the building and site design; Preferably, using drought resistant and/or native vegetation. And, maintaining high standards of indoor air quality to help ensure the health of the people who inhabit the building.

===LEED===
Despite the fact that there are many paths to [[sustainable design]], the emergence of the trend has created a demand for quantifiability. In the United States, the [[non-profit organization]] the [[United States Green Building Council]] (USGBC) developed the  [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) rating system in the year 2000. Their point based rating has a total of 100 base points possible, and buildings can be categorized as certified (40 points), silver (50), gold (60), or platinum (80+). LEED uses five different categories to judge a building's sustainability; 1) site location, 2) water conservation, 3)energy efficiency, 4) materials, 5) indoor air quality, and a bonus category for innovation and design.&lt;ref name="Sands2002"&gt;{{cite book

|url=http://www.librisdesign.org/docs/
}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2003}} libraries accounted for 16% of all LEED projects ([[#Reference-idBrown2003|Brown, 2003]]).

===Special needs===
Sustainable library design is strongly tied to the overall green building movement, but libraries have specific needs that present some extra challenges for green builders.

The biggest challenge is balancing the sometimes conflicting needs of the patrons and the materials. One of the central themes of the library's mission is to preserve knowledge, so that it can be passed on to future generations. For over a thousand years [[books]] have been the dominant way to do that. While the [[internet]] has become the information medium of choice for many, books still play a very important role in the preservation of knowledge. In order to be preserved, books must be kept away from extreme temperatures, moisture, and sunlight. In contrast, many individuals find sunlight to be the most enjoyable light for reading. Sunlight also plays a major role in green design, because it can be used to reduce the reliance on artificial lighting. For a long time, libraries needed to protect the collection from the damaging ultra-violet rays of the sun. New developments in glass technology over the past ten years have given designers more flexibility in their ability to place collections ([[#Reference-idMcCabe2003|Mcabe, 2003]]).

Another, often overlooked, challenge the library presents is the weight of the books. A common strategy in green design is to raise the floors to increase circulation, but the weight of the stacks can be an impediment to this strategy. To deal with this challenge, many designers have resorted to zoning the library into designated areas, so these strategies can be enacted in certain areas, and alternatives can be used in others.&lt;ref name="Lamis2003"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;
Libraries need to be built flexibly, in order to make room for expansions in size and in wiring capabilities. Library buildings are long term investments into the community, so when designing them architects need to be looking 50 or 100 years into the future. These obstacles by no means present insurmountable challenges to green libraries. The special needs of the library just need to be taken into consideration from the beginning of the project.

==How are libraries becoming green?==
Green design is an integrated process. No one aspect of a building's [[architecture]] makes it [[green architecture]]. Without proper integration from the earliest moments of the planning phase, redundancies can occur, eliminating many of the potential benefits of sustainable design. Good sustainable design capitalizes on the synergistic relationships that occur between the various design elements. LEED groups these elements into five categories. Buildings can be designed in a way in which, good design in one category helps another category fulfill its goal.

===Site selection===
Before building can start, a site must be chosen. The selection of the site has a large impact on how ecologically friendly the library will be. LEED has a number of guidelines to help the [[site selection]] process. There are a number of questions to consider that will help guide the site selection process, including, what kind of impact will construction  have on the local environment, will there be erosion, what can be done with storm runoff, and is the site already green? Also, the library should be located in a densely populated area, near a number of other service related buildings. People should be able to reach the building via public transportation and the parking lots should give priority parking to those driving energy efficient  automobiles. The heat island effect can be reduced by shading hard surfaces, putting them underground, or by implementing a vegetative roof ([[#Reference-idLEED2005|LEED, 2005]])

===Water conservation===
There are many different ways for libraries to conserve water. A number of them rely on proper site selection. If a site is selected properly strategies can be used to capture rainwater runoff to be used in irrigation. Another strategy is to use low flow fixtures, and waterless urinals.

===Energy conservation===
[[Efficient energy use|Energy efficiency]] is considered by many to be the most important category in becoming sustainable. In the LEED rating system it is the heaviest weighted of all the categories. Energy efficient design is in many ways a return to passive design principles that evolved over thousands of years, until the advent of air conditioning and cheap energy made those strategies appear to be unnecessary. After air conditioning became widely available, buildings were designed to eliminate influences of the outside environment. Lamis illustrates this point in "Greening the Library" when he compares two libraries built near the turn of the 20th century, the [[New York Public Library]] and the [[Boston Public Library]]; to two more recently built libraries, the [[Chicago Public Library]] and the [[Phoenix Public Library]]. The two older libraries have interior spaces that are narrow, so they can be reached by natural light and air. Whereas the two more modern libraries have large floor plans, with interior spaces far removed from the outside environment. Making them more dependent on artificial systems of temperature control.&lt;ref name="Lamis2003" /&gt;

As environmental awareness increases, as well as the cost of fossil fuels needed to operate giant heating, air conditioning, and ventilation ([HVAC]) systems, building designers are beginning to recognize that the outside environment cannot be ignored, and should be taken advantage of.  What 21st-century designers are beginning to do is implement ancient passive design principles, while taking advantage of the most advanced technology available.

The passive strategies vary according to location, but they are always implemented to capitalize on the natural elements, mostly wind and sun, to manage the temperature and to provide ventilation and light. Active strategies are more technologically advanced solutions that include using various forms of renewable energy resources and using sensors to adjust lighting. Using [[photovoltaic cells]] that turn sunlight into energy is becoming an increasingly popular way to reduce energy dependence. In order to fully maximize energy efficiency and comfort, libraries are combining passive and active strategies.

===Building materials===
It is believed that up to 40% of landfill space is filled with construction waste material.&lt;ref name="Sands2002" /&gt; The primary responsibility in selecting materials for the library is to contribute as little waste as possible. Another responsibility is to choose materials that can be produced without causing too much damage to the natural environment. In order to fulfill the first responsibility, post-industrial and post-consumer recycled materials are being used. When purchasing materials claiming to be made from recycled goods it is important to investigate what their claims mean. It is a common marketing practice to exaggerate how green a product is by using misleading statements.&lt;ref name="Sands2002" /&gt; Also, materials should be chosen that are going to be able to be reused or recycled 50–100 years down the road when the library building has reached the end of its useful life ([[#Reference-idTsang2007|Tseng, 2007]]). As non-renewable resources decrease, reusing and [[recycling]] are going to become increasingly necessary in the future.

It is also important to consider where materials are coming from: Resources have emerged to help guide the material selection process, such as the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC). They rate and certify wood based on a number of factors regarding how it was produced; rights of indigenous peoples, environmental impact, workers rights, efficiency, management, and conservation ([[#Reference-idFSC1996|FSC, 1996]]). Another material option is using quickly renewable materials such as bamboo in place of wood whenever possible.&lt;ref name="Lamis2003" /&gt; The widening availability of green building materials, along with the development of non-profit watchdog groups are two important factors in the greening of 21st-century library buildings.

===Indoor air quality===
Along with energy inefficiency, poor air quality has been another side-effect of the post air conditioning building design. Because most modern buildings are temperature controlled, they are designed to be airtight. The lack of ventilation can not only make buildings expensive to cool, it also traps harmful toxins that can do serious damage to people's respiratory systems. Toxins come from a variety of sources. Materials that make up the library, including paints and carpeting, have [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOC's), which produce a ground-level ozone after reacting with sunlight and nitrogen. The carbon dioxide that people breathe into the atmosphere is another toxin.  To improve air quality, materials can be bought that have a low VOC content, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  monitors can be installed to ensure that  CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  levels remain at a safe level.  On average, people spend about 90% of their time indoors.&lt;ref name="Lamis2003" /&gt; Therefore, green buildings need to be designed in a way in which the air gets recycled, and does not stay stagnant. A green library is not just about taking care of the environment, it is about taking care of the health and well-being of those who work in it and patronize it.

==Green Design Elements for Libraries==
Green libraries combine the needs of a library, sustainable design, and real cost savings in energy consumption (Brown, 2003). The main goal of green buildings is to develop and use sustainable energy-efficient resources in construction, maintenance, and overall life of the structure. Libraries considering green design will often look at the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system. Brown (2003) identifies the following green design elements, which can be incorporated into libraries:

'''•Community collaboration''' – makes sure that community assets are efficiently used and helps to maintain public support

'''•Daylight''' – pair daylight with artificial lighting to reduce energy costs

'''•Green materials''' – use renewable materials like wood, linoleum, bamboo, and cork

'''•Green roofs'''

'''•Raised floor systems'''

'''•Energy efficiency'''

'''•Natural ventilation'''

'''•Green power and renewable energy'''

'''•Indoor environmental quality'''

==Why are libraries becoming green?==
First, libraries have been expanding the scope of their mission statements, to include working for the betterment of mankind.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Second, technology is no longer a barrier. Third, it is great for the image of the library. Finally, sustainability offers the library a degree of independence, because cost of maintenance goes down, as does reliance on the volatile fossil fuels market.

===Mission===
All libraries have a mission statement, and spoken or unspoken, libraries are here to improve the condition of mankind. An institution can no longer, in good faith aim to improve the human condition while contributing to the destruction of the future: Buildings produce about 40% of  the dangerous greenhouse gasses emitted into the atmosphere ([[#reference-idAnisko2006|Anisko &amp; Willoughby, 2006]]). The environmental debate has evolved. The fact that humans are having a negative impact on the environment is no longer seriously questioned.  Now,  two questions shape the debate: What is our responsibility to fix it, and what can we do to fix it? Individuals and private organizations have a right to find their personal answers to those questions, but libraries are an investment in the future of our society. Libraries have a responsibility to not contribute to the destruction of the environment, to educate the people regarding our current situation, and empower them to make a difference.  Libraries are discovering that their green building gives them a great opportunity to educate the citizenry ([[#Reference-idTsang2007|Tseng, 2007]]). As libraries continue to take a more progressive stance on improving the human condition, sustainability will have to be a central theme.

===Technology===

The availability of the technology and knowledge to build green buildings has passed a tipping point. Green buildings are constructed all over the world in every sector of the economy; residential, commercial, non-profit, government, etc.  Another breakthrough is the diversity of green technology. There is an abundance of options, so any green builder has the ability to capitalize on the local natural resources available, and customize the building to most efficiently operate in the local environment. Along with the advancement of technology, the increasing awareness of environmental issues decrease the burden on the green builder. With the development of organizations like the USGBC and the FSC, green builders have information resources available to them. These organizations offer measurable levels of achievement to strive for, along with acting as watchdogs to help prevent the exaggeration of green credentials or "[[green-washing]]." With these advances, sustainable construction is no longer a [[utopian]] fantasy, but is simply becoming the way good buildings are being built.

===Image===
The library is undergoing an identity transformation. It is struggling to stay relevant, as a vocal minority predicts its demise. While its image as an outdated institution is not entirely deserved, it is trying to assert itself as an irreplaceable part of the community, that plans on being an assertive force for good in the 21st century. Green design helps it do that three different ways. 1) A sustainable building makes a statement that the library is investing in the future of the community. 2) Sustainable buildings are smartly designed, aesthetically pleasing, and are powered by state-of-the-art technology. When people see these emerald marvels they will no longer be able to maintain false stereotypes regarding libraries as anachronistic relics from an analog age. 3) More and more people take [[environmentalism]] seriously, so a green image is a good image.  The public awareness on this issue is only going to increase. Libraries want the public to believe that they are still relevant, and that their mission is to better humankind. Many have decided that a green library is a physical manifestation of their mission statement, and it provides an image of how libraries want to be seen in the 21st century.

===Independence===
As publicly funded institutions, libraries are constantly battling with budget issues. Swings in the economy can affect the tax dollars coming into the library, as well as new legislation. Sustainable design offers libraries a way to reduce maintenance and energy costs, providing them with a degree of independence. Thanks to computer modeling software, building planning can be done more efficiently than in the past. Precise estimations on quantity of building materials can prevent waste and save money. Simulations can also be done to predict how big of an HVAC system the library needs. Solar 5.5 is a computer program that builds a 3-D model of the library's energy performance, and then plugs in various passive and [[Active Design]] strategies to see what kind of effect they would have on each other to maximize the energy savings and cost of the building; it has saved some California libraries up to 46% of the energy cost compared to meeting minimum state requirements ([[#Reference-idBoyden2000|Boyden &amp; Weiner, 2000]]).

One of the most important features of green design is a shift from the reliance on depleting fossil fuels to renewable energy resources. The independence from fossil fuels will save the library large sums of money, and it will relish its independence if prices continue to rise.

Money will also be saved by having higher morale, health, and productivity from employees.  The architectural firm Heschong Mahone conducted a study that indicated students perform 25% better on standardized tests when in classrooms lit naturally.&lt;ref name="Sands2002" /&gt; High levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can decreases performance as well.&lt;ref name="Lamis2003" /&gt; Savings can also be increased, because there are governmental incentives to capitalize on, and some  utility companies offer incentives too ([[#Reference-idBoyden2001|Boyden &amp; Weiner, 2001]]).

Because of the long-term nature of the library, green design is potentially less expensive than standard design, as heavy up-front costs often pay for themselves, waste is reduced, efficiency is increased, and energy and water are conserved. Evolving libraries of the 21st century are integrating sustainable practices, because it is becoming the most cost-effective way to do things.

==High-profile green libraries==
In the 2000s (decade) a number of high-profile green libraries have been built in the U.S. and in the rest of the world.

===Fayetteville (AR) Public Library===
The [[Fayetteville Public Library]] designed by [[Meyer, Scherer and Rockcastle, Ltd. in Minneapolis]] opened in October 2004. The library, ''Library Journal's'' 2005 Library of the Year, was the first building in Arkansas to register with the U.S. Green Building Council and achieved the silver LEED designation in 2006. To earn this designation the library employed many green-design techniques. The library was built on an empty lot a few blocks away from the [[Fayetteville Historic Square|city's bustling square]], making it a textbook infill project. During construction, any trees removed were harvested and used for furniture or donated to local parks. Throughout the project, almost 99% of the construction waste was recycled or reused. More than 65% of the materials used to build the library were made within {{convert|500|mi|km}} of the city. By incorporating a green roof and using alternative roofing materials, the design team reduced air temperature as much as 20 degrees. Water collected on the roof is reused for landscape irrigation. The library's green roof saves about $4,000 a year in energy savings. The building's reading spaces and circulation desks were situated to take advantage of the natural sunlight without over-working the building's air conditioners, reducing energy costs by 25% and the overall building's energy consumption by 30%. Sunlight streams through 75% of the building's public spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faylib.org|title=Fayettevill Public Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seattle Central Library===
The [[Seattle Central Library]] designed by [[Rem Koolhaas]] opened in May 2004. It employs a number of innovative techniques to achieve the status of a green library. It is located in a dense urban area, accessible by public transportation. Rainwater runoff is stored in a 40,000 gallon tank, and used to irrigate the landscape. It has triple glazed glass, used to reduce heat buildup. Seventy-five percent of the demolition and construction waste was recycled. Many other green strategies were employed that can be read in more detail here: [http://www.spl.org/default.asp?pageID=branch_central_sustainable&amp;branchID=1 SPL's green strategies]

===National Library, Singapore===
The [[Singapore National Library]] has been called the greenest building on the planet. Designed by [[Ken Yeang]], it opened in July 2005. It is designed using light shelves that allow the light to filter into the library, without having any harsh effects. During the moments that the sun is either to bright or not bright enough, sensors are programmed to dim or brighten the lights, and raise and lower the shades to maximize comfort and reduce costs ([[#Reference-idAnisko2006|Anisko &amp; Willoughby, 2006]])

===Minneapolis Public Library===
The Central Branch of the [[Minneapolis Public Library]] System was designed by [[Cesar Pelli]], and it opened in May 2006. It has a {{convert|18560|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[green roof]]. The green roof is planted with vegetation that does well in Minnesota's harsh climate, and it reduces rainwater runoff, reduces the building's heating and cooling load, reduces the buildings [[heat island effect]], and adds green space to the downtown cityscape ([[#Reference-idMinneapolis2006|MPL, 2006]]).

===Public Library of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:ImaginOn UpTown In the Morning.PNG|thumb|ImaginOn in the a.m.]] --&gt;The Joe and Joan Martin Center is the first public building in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County certified by the US Green Building Council. In 2006, ImaginOn was awarded LEED certification at the silver level {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.

===Children's Museum of Pittsburgh===
The [[Children's Museum of Pittsburgh]] underwent extensive expansion and renovation in 2004 using sustainable techniques and guiding principles thereby earning silver LEED-certification, one of largest museums in the country to receive this designation, and the first children’s museum in America to do so. For more detailed information, see [http://www.pittsburghkids.org/Templates/CMP_Level3_List.aspx?CID=418&amp;SECID=5&amp;MENUID=1 The Green Museum]

===University of California, Merced Kolligian Library===
Opened in August 2005, UC Merced's Kolligian Library was awarded Gold Leeds Certification in 2007. The {{convert|180000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} glass-and-concrete building uses 42% less water and 50% less energy than comparable buildings. The building's carpet contains 37% recycled content, while its acoustical ceiling tiles contain 66% recycled content that includes telephone books and newspapers. Nearly 30% of the materials used to construct the building were manufactured locally, resulting in significant transportation and energy savings.&lt;ref name="SignKolligian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://administration.ucmerced.edu/sites/administration/files/public/documents/SignKolligian.pdf|title=Leo &amp; Dottie Kolligian Library Sign|accessdate=20 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227010331/http://administration.ucmerced.edu/sites/administration/files/public/documents/SignKolligian.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of green libraries is growing all the time. For an up-to-date information on green libraries and green library projects in the U.S. and Canada see [http://www.greenlibraries.org/index.html green libraries].

'''Greenhouse debt''' is the measure to which an individual person, incorporated association, business enterprise, government instrumentality or / [and] (per Neb., USA) geographic community exceeds its permitted [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse]] [[ecological footprint|footprint]] and contributes [[greenhouse gas]]es that contribute to [[global warming]] and [[climate change]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The concept makes no sense without a clear numerical value for the permitted [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse]] [[ecological footprint|footprint]]. It is not clear what this value is.

[[Friends of the Earth]] and similar organisations put forward the concept to define specifically the environmental harm caused by developed countries' past and present policies.&lt;ref&gt;Friends of the Earth International. 2000. "Greenhouse debt".  ''Link'' (20):  http://www.foei.org/en/publications/link/92/e92greenhouse_debt.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some governments, at least the Australian [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] leadership, have a tendency to accept such a line of reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Clive Hamilton, "We will all pay for Howard's hidden greenhouse debt", Crikey, Friday, 14 December 2007: http://www.crikey.com.au/Politics/20071214-Howards-Hidden-Greenhouse-Debt-.html?CurrentDate=14+%2F+01+%2F+2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The greenhouse debt assessment thus forms an [[ecological footprint]] analysis but can be used separately. Taken conjointly with a 'water debt' [[needs assessment|analysis]] and an [[environmental impact assessment|ecological impact assessment]], greenhouse debt analysis is basic to giving individuals, organisations, governments and communities an understanding of the effects they are having on [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia]], [[life]], and [[global warming]].  

Ensuring that the greenhouse debt is zero is essential towards achieving [[ecologically sustainable development]] or a [[sustainable retreat]]. Any greenhouse debt incurred will contribute to making life harder for future generations of humans and [[non-human]] lifeforms.

There are three possible consequences that occur as a result of a greenhouse debt.

#''[[Mitigation of global warming|Mitigation]]:'' finding compensatory ways of reducing the greenhouse debt so its effects are neutralised
#''[[Adaptation]]:'' finding ways of adjusting to the resulting global warming or climate change
#''[[Suffering]]:'' having one's quality of life reduced as a result of the consequences

The owners of hogs were responsible for [[Yoke|yoking]] and placing rings in their noses. If the hogs got loose and became a nuisance in the community, one or more of the men assigned as a hog reeve would be responsible for capturing and [[Animal pound|impounding]] the animal. If the animal did not have a ring in its nose, then the reeve was responsible for performing the necessary chore for the owner, who could legally be charged a small fee for the service.  There were punishments and fines established for failing to yoke hogs and to control animals. In an 1865 Act of the [[General Assembly of Prince Edward Island]], Canada, owners were required to pay 4 [[shilling]]s per head to reclaim their animals, and hogreeves were permitted to sell unclaimed swine at public auction  48 hours after written notices were posted in public places in that district.&lt;ref&gt;Prince Edward Island, (1865). "The acts of the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island", Canada&lt;/ref&gt;  
In [[New England]], the owner of a stray hog in the town of [[Chelsea, Massachusetts]] would be charged 10 shillings per hog.&lt;ref name="Chelsea"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071118004020/http://www.olgp.net/chs/mayors/officeholders/positions.htm "DESCRIPTION OF OFFICIAL POSITIONS HELD BY THE INHABITANTS OF WINNISIMMET,  RUMNEY MARSH AND PULLEN POINT when still a part of Boston and after  separation to become the TOWN of CHELSEA"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The office originated in [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon England]], when hogreeves would be stationed at the doors of [[cathedral]]s during services to prevent swine from entering the church.&lt;ref name="Adams"  /&gt;  The office of hogreeve was among the earliest elected offices to exist in colonial North America; the earliest rights specifically granted to towns in New England concerned the herding of swine, cattle, and the regulation of fences and common fields.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;Adams, H. B. (1883) Norman constables in America, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore. (p. 35-36)&lt;/ref&gt; The field driver held similar duties but was not restricted to swine.&lt;ref&gt;General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, [http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleVII/Chapter49/Section24,"General Laws: CHAPTER 49, Section 24"]&lt;/ref&gt; The hogreeve was a historical municipal official in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Prince Edward Island]] in Canada; it was also listed as an elected office in early [[New Hampshire]] township records.&lt;ref&gt;Casselman, B. (2009) [http://www.billcasselman.com/whats_in_a_canadian_name/canadian_job_names.htm, "Canadian Job Names"]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In [[Massachusetts]], towns could vote to stop enforcement of the state law against letting swine run loose; many towns did so, leaving their hog reeves with nothing to do. As a result, it became a joke to elect a man hog reeve during the first year of his marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Old Sturbridge Inc., [http://www.osv.org/explore_learn/document_viewer.php?DocID=1127 "Glossary of New England Town Officers"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Imre Lakatos''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|l|æ|k|ə|t|ɒ|s}},&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgvKG_3Ck7Y Philosophy of Science: Popper and Lakatos],&lt;!--at 0:43--&gt; lecture on the philosophy of science of Karl Popper and Imre Lakatos, delivered to master's students at the [[University of Sussex]] in November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|US|-|t|oʊ|s}}; {{lang-hu|Lakatos Imre}} {{IPA-hu|ˈlɒkɒtoʃ ˈimrɛ|}}; November 9, 1922 – February 2, 1974) was a [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] [[philosopher]] of [[Philosophy of mathematics|mathematics]] and [[Philosophy of science|science]], known for his thesis of the fallibility of mathematics and its 'methodology of proofs and refutations' in its pre-axiomatic stages of development, and also for introducing the concept of the '[[research programme]]' in his methodology of scientific research programmes.

==Life==
Lakatos was born '''Imre''' ('''Avrum''') '''Lipschitz''' to a [[Jew]]ish family in [[Debrecen]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]] in 1922. He received a degree in mathematics, [[physics]], and [[philosophy]] from the [[University of Debrecen]] in 1944. In March 1944 the [[Operation Margarethe|Germans invaded Hungary]] and Lakatos along with Éva Révész, his then-girlfriend and subsequent wife, formed soon after that event a [[Marxist]] resistance group.&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lakatos/ Imre Lakatos (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; In May of that year, the group was joined by Éva Izsák, a 19-year-old Jewish antifascist activist. Lakatos, considering that there was a risk that she would be captured and forced to betray them, decided that her duty to the group was to commit suicide.&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; Subsequently, a member of the group took her to Debrecen and gave her [[cyanide]].&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;

During the occupation, Lakatos avoided [[Nazi]] persecution of Jews by changing his name to '''Imre Molnár'''.  His mother and grandmother died in [[Auschwitz]]. He changed his surname once again to ''Lakatos'' (Locksmith) in honor of [[Géza Lakatos]].

After the war, from 1947, he worked as a senior official in the Hungarian ministry of education. He also continued his education with a PhD at Debrecen University awarded in 1948, and also attended [[György Lukács]]'s weekly Wednesday afternoon private seminars. He also studied at the [[Moscow State University]] under the supervision of [[Sofya Yanovskaya]] in 1949. When he returned, however, he found himself on the losing side of internal arguments within the [[Hungarian Workers' Party|Hungarian communist party]] and was imprisoned on charges of [[Marxist revisionism|revisionism]] from 1950 to 1953. More of Lakatos' activities in Hungary after World War II have recently become known. In fact, Lakatos was a hardline [[Stalinist]] and, despite his young age, had an important role between 1945 and 1950 (his own arrest and jailing) in building up the Communist rule, especially in cultural life and the academia, in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Bandy 2010.{{page needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preceding his fleeing to Vienna he confessed he has worked as an informer of [[State Protection Authority]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

After his release, Lakatos returned to academic life, doing mathematical research and translating [[George Pólya]]'s ''[[How to Solve It]]'' into Hungarian. Still nominally a communist, his political views had shifted markedly and he was involved with at least one dissident student group in the lead-up to the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]].

After the [[Soviet Union]] invaded Hungary in November 1956, Lakatos fled to [[Vienna]], and later reached England. He received a PhD in philosophy in 1961 from the [[University of Cambridge]]; his thesis advisor was [[R. B. Braithwaite]]. The book ''[[Proofs and Refutations|Proofs and Refutations: The Logic of Mathematical Discovery]]'', published after his death, is based on this work.

Lakatos never obtained [[British nationality law|British citizenship]].
In 1960, he was appointed to a position in the [[London School of Economics]], where he wrote on the [[philosophy of mathematics]] and the [[philosophy of science]]. The LSE philosophy of science department at that time included [[Karl Popper]], [[Joseph Agassi]] and [[John Oulton Wisdom|J. O. Wisdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|page=42|title=Gallery of Scholars: A Philosopher's Recollections|volume=13|series=Philosophy and education|first=Israel|last=Scheffler|publisher=Springer|year=2007|isbn=9781402027109|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_UI5cC3QlsC&amp;pg=PA42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Agassi who first introduced Lakatos to Popper under the rubric of his applying a [[Fallibilism|fallibilist]] methodology of [[conjecture]]s and [[refutation]]s to mathematics in his Cambridge PhD thesis.

With co-editor [[Alan Musgrave]], he edited the often cited ''Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge'', the ''Proceedings'' of the International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science, London, 1965. Published in 1970, the 1965 Colloquium included well-known speakers delivering papers in response to [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn's]] ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''.

Lakatos remained at the London School of Economics until his sudden death in 1974 of a heart attack&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald A. Gillies]]. "Review. Matteo Motterlini (ed). Imre Lakatos. Paul K Feyerabend. Sull'orlo della scienza: pro e contro il metodo. (On the threshold of Science: for and against method)." ''The British Journal of the Philosophy of Science''. Vol. 47, No. 3, Sep., 1996. https://www.jstor.org/stable/687992&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of 51. The [[Lakatos Award]] was set up by the school in his memory.

In January 1971, he became editor of the ''[[British Journal for the Philosophy of Science]]'', which J. O. Wisdom had built up before departing in 1965, and he continued as editor until his death in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;See Lakatos's 5 Jan 1971 letter to Paul Feyerabend pp 233–4 in Motterlini's 1999 ''For and Against Method''&lt;/ref&gt; after which it was then edited jointly for many years by his LSE colleagues [[John W. N. Watkins]] and [[John Worrall (philosopher)|John Worrall]], Lakatos's ex-research assistant.

His last LSE lectures in scientific method in Lent Term 1973 along with parts of his correspondence with his friend and critic [[Paul Feyerabend]] have been published in ''[[For and Against Method]]'' ({{ISBN|0-226-46774-0}}).

Lakatos and his colleague [[Spiro Latsis]] organized an international conference devoted entirely to historical case studies in Lakatos's methodology of research programmes in physical sciences and economics, to be held in Greece in 1974, and which still went ahead following Lakatos's death in February 1974. These case studies in such as Einstein's relativity programme, [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel|Fresnel]]'s wave theory of light and [[neoclassical economics]], were published by Cambridge University Press in two separate volumes in 1976, one devoted to physical sciences and Lakatos's general programme for rewriting the history of science, with a concluding critique by his great friend Paul Feyerabend, and the other devoted to economics.&lt;ref&gt;These were respectively ''Method and Appraisal in the Physical Sciences: The Critical Background to Modern Science 1800–1905'' by Colin Howson (ed.) and ''Method and Appraisal in Economics'' by Spiro J. Latsis (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proofs and refutations, mathematics==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Quasi-empiricism in mathematics]] --&gt;
{{main|Proofs and Refutations}}

Lakatos' philosophy of mathematics was inspired by both [[Georg Hegel|Hegel]]'s and [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s [[dialectic]], by [[Karl Popper]]'s theory of knowledge, and by the work of mathematician [[George Pólya]].

The 1976 book ''Proofs and Refutations'' is based on the first three chapters of his four chapter 1961 doctoral thesis ''Essays in the logic of mathematical discovery''. But its first chapter is Lakatos's own revision of its chapter 1 that was first published as ''Proofs and Refutations'' in four parts in 1963–4 in ''The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science''. It is largely taken up by a fictional [[dialogue]] set in a mathematics class. The students are attempting to prove the formula for the [[Euler characteristic]] in [[algebraic topology]], which is a [[theorem]] about the properties of [[polyhedra]], namely that for all polyhedra the number of their ''V''ertices minus the number of their ''E''dges plus the number of their ''F''aces is 2:&amp;nbsp; (''V – E + F = 2''). The dialogue is meant to represent the actual series of attempted proofs which mathematicians historically offered for the [[conjecture]], only to be repeatedly refuted by [[counterexample]]s. Often the students paraphrase famous mathematicians such as [[Cauchy]], as noted in Lakatos's extensive footnotes.

Lakatos termed the polyhedral counter examples to Euler's formula ''monsters'' and distinguished three ways of handling these objects:
Firstly, ''monster-barring'', by which means the theorem in question could not be applied to such objects. Secondly, ''monster-adjustment'' whereby by making a re-appraisal of the ''monster'' it could be ''made'' to obey the proposed theorem. Thirdly, ''exception handling'', a further distinct process. These distinct strategies have been taken up in qualitative physics, where the terminology of ''monsters'' has been applied to apparent counter-examples, and the techniques of ''monster-barring'' and ''monster-adjustment'' recognized as approaches to the refinement of the analysis of a physical issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lakatosian Monsters|url=http://harveycohen.net/dragons/Lakatosian_Monsters.htm|accessdate= 18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What Lakatos tried to establish was that no theorem of [[informal mathematics]] is final or perfect. This means that we should not think that a theorem is ultimately true, only that no [[counterexample]] has yet been found. Once a counterexample, i.e. an entity contradicting/not explained by the theorem is found, we adjust the theorem, possibly extending the domain of its validity. This is a continuous way our knowledge accumulates, through the logic and process of proofs and refutations. (If axioms are given for a branch of mathematics, however, Lakatos claimed that proofs from those [[axiom]]s were [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]], i.e. [[logical truth|logically true]].)&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Lakatos' ''A renaissance of empiricism in the recent philosophy of mathematics'', section 2, in which he defines a Euclidean system to be one consisting of all logical deductions from an initial set of axioms and writes that "a Euclidean system may be claimed to be true".&lt;/ref&gt;

Lakatos proposed an account of mathematical knowledge based on the idea of [[heuristic]]s. In ''Proofs and Refutations'' the concept of 'heuristic' was not well developed, although Lakatos gave several basic rules for finding proofs and counterexamples to conjectures. He thought that mathematical '[[thought experiment]]s' are a valid way to discover mathematical conjectures and proofs, and sometimes called his philosophy 'quasi-[[empiricism]]'.

However, he also conceived of the mathematical community as carrying on a kind of dialectic to decide which [[mathematical proof]]s are [[Validity (logic)|valid]] and which are not. Therefore, he fundamentally disagreed with the '[[formalism (mathematics)|formalist]]' conception of proof which prevailed in [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]'s and [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]]'s [[logicism]], which defines proof simply in terms of ''formal'' validity.

On its first publication as a paper in ''The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science'' in 1963–4, ''Proofs and Refutations'' became highly influential on new work in the philosophy of mathematics, although few agreed with Lakatos' strong disapproval of formal proof. Before his death he had been planning to return to the philosophy of mathematics and apply his theory of research programmes to it. Lakatos, Worrall and Zahar use [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré (1893)]]&lt;ref&gt;Poincaré, H. (1893). "Sur la Généralisation d'un Théorème d'Euler relatif aux Polyèdres", ''Comptes Redus des Séances de l'Académie des Sciences'', '''117''' p. 144, as cited in Lakatos, Worrall and Zahar, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; to answer one of the major problems perceived by critics, namely that the pattern of mathematical research depicted in ''Proofs and Refutations'' does not faithfully represent most of the actual activity of contemporary mathematicians.&lt;ref&gt;Lakatos, Worrall and Zahar (1976), ''Proofs and Refutations'' {{ISBN|0-521-21078-X}}, pp. 106–126, note that Poincaré's formal proof (1899) "Complèment à l'Analysis Situs", ''Rediconti del Circolo Matematico di Palermo'', '''13''', pp. 285–343, [[Rewriting|rewrite]]s Euler's conjecture into a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] of [[vector algebra]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cauchy and uniform convergence===
In a 1966 text published as (Lakatos 1978), Lakatos re-examines the history of the calculus, with special regard to [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]] and the concept of uniform convergence, in the light of [[non-standard analysis]].  Lakatos is concerned that historians of mathematics should not judge the evolution of mathematics in terms of currently fashionable theories.  As an illustration, he examines Cauchy's proof that the sum of a series of continuous functions is itself continuous.  Lakatos is critical of those who would see Cauchy's proof, with its failure to make explicit a suitable convergence hypothesis, merely as an inadequate approach to Weierstrassian analysis.  Lakatos sees in such an approach a failure to realize that Cauchy's concept of the continuum differed from currently dominant views.

==Research programmes==
Lakatos's second major contribution to the philosophy of science was his model of the 'research programme',&lt;ref&gt;Lakatos, Imre. (1970). "Falsification and the methodology of scientific research programmes." In: Lakatos, Musgrave eds. (1970), pp. 91–195.&lt;/ref&gt; which he formulated in an attempt to resolve the perceived conflict between [[Karl Popper|Popper's]] [[falsifiability|falsificationism]] and the revolutionary structure of science described by [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Kuhn]]. Popper's standard of [[Falsifiability|falsificationism]] was widely taken to imply that a theory should be abandoned as soon as any evidence appears to challenge it, while Kuhn's descriptions of scientific activity were taken to imply that science was most constructive when it upheld a system of popular, or 'normal', theories, despite anomalies. Lakatos' model of the research programme aims to combine Popper's adherence to empirical validity with Kuhn's appreciation for conventional consistency.

A Lakatosian research programme&lt;ref&gt;Bruce J. Caldwell (1991) "[http://public.econ.duke.edu/~bjc18/docs/MSRP%20in%20Economics.pdf The Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes: Criticisms and Conjectures]" in G. K. Shaw ed. (1991) ''Economics, Culture, and Education: Essays in Honor of Mark Blaug'' Aldershot: Elgar, 1991 pp. 95–107&lt;/ref&gt; is based on a ''hard core'' of theoretical assumptions that cannot be abandoned or altered without abandoning the programme altogether. More modest and specific theories that are formulated in order to explain evidence that threatens the 'hard core' are termed ''auxiliary hypotheses''. Auxiliary hypotheses are considered expendable by the adherents of the research programme—they may be altered or abandoned as empirical discoveries require in order to 'protect' the 'hard core'. Whereas Popper was generally read as hostile toward such ''ad hoc'' theoretical amendments, Lakatos argued that they can be ''progressive'', i.e. productive, when they enhance the programme's explanatory and/or predictive power, and that they are at least permissible until some better system of theories is devised and the research programme is replaced entirely. The difference between a ''progressive'' and a ''degenerative'' research programme lies, for Lakatos, in whether the recent changes to its auxiliary hypotheses have achieved this greater explanatory/predictive power or whether they have been made simply out of the necessity of offering some response in the face of new and troublesome evidence. A degenerative research programme indicates that a new and more progressive system of theories should be sought to replace the currently prevailing one, but until such a system of theories can be conceived of and agreed upon, abandonment of the current one would only further weaken our explanatory power and was therefore unacceptable for Lakatos. Lakatos's primary example of a research programme that had been successful in its time and then progressively replaced is that founded by [[Isaac Newton]], with his three [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] forming the 'hard core'.

The Lakatosian research programme deliberately provides a framework within which research can be conducted on the basis of 'first principles' (the 'hard core') which are shared by those involved in the research programme and accepted for the purpose of that research without further proof or debate. In this regard, it is similar to Kuhn's notion of a paradigm. Lakatos sought to replace Kuhn's paradigm, guided by an irrational 'psychology of discovery', with a research programme no less coherent or consistent yet guided by Popper's objectively valid [[The Logic of Scientific Discovery|logic of discovery]].

Lakatos was following [[Pierre Duhem]]'s idea that one can always protect a cherished theory (or part of one) from hostile evidence by redirecting the criticism toward other theories or parts thereof. (See ''[[Confirmation holism]]'' and [[Duhem–Quine thesis]]). This aspect of falsification had been acknowledged by Popper.

[[Karl Popper|Popper]]'s theory, [[falsificationism]], proposed that scientists put forward theories and that nature 'shouts NO' in the form of an inconsistent observation. According to Popper, it is irrational for scientists to maintain their theories in the face of Nature's rejection, as Kuhn had described them doing. For Lakatos, however, "It is not that we propose a theory and Nature may shout NO; rather, we propose a maze of theories, and nature may shout INCONSISTENT".&lt;ref&gt;Lakatos, Musgrave eds. (1970), p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; The continued adherence to a programme's 'hard core', augmented with adaptable auxiliary hypotheses, reflects Lakatos's less strict standard of falsificationism.

Lakatos saw himself as merely extending Popper's ideas, which changed over time and were interpreted by many in conflicting ways. In his 1968 paper "Criticism and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes",&lt;ref name=La68&gt;Lakatos, Imre. (1968). "Criticism and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes." ''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society'' '''69'''(1):149–186 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; Lakatos contrasted ''Popper0'', the "naive falsificationist" who demanded unconditional rejection of any theory in the face of any anomaly (an interpretation Lakatos saw as erroneous but that he nevertheless referred to often); ''Popper1'', the more nuanced and conservatively interpreted philosopher; and ''Popper2'', the "sophisticated methodological falsificationist" that Lakatos claims is the logical extension of the correctly interpreted ideas of ''Popper1'' (and who is therefore essentially Lakatos himself). It is, therefore, very difficult to determine which ideas and arguments concerning the research programme should be credited to whom.

While Lakatos dubbed his theory "sophisticated methodological falsificationism", it is not "methodological" in the strict sense of asserting universal methodological rules by which all scientific research must abide. Rather, it is methodological only in that theories are only abandoned according to a methodical progression from worse theories to better theories—a stipulation overlooked by what Lakatos terms "dogmatic falsificationism". Methodological assertions in the strict sense, pertaining to which methods are valid and which are invalid, are, themselves, contained within the research programmes that choose to adhere to them, and should be judged according to whether the research programmes that adhere to them prove progressive or degenerative. Lakatos divided these 'methodological rules' within a research programme into its 'negative heuristics', i.e., what research methods and approaches to avoid, and its 'positive heuristics', i.e., what research methods and approaches to prefer. While the 'negative heuristic' protects the hard core, the 'positive heuristic' directs the modification of the hard core and auxiliary hypotheses in a general direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/720560483|title=Great readings in clinical science : essential selections for mental health professionals|date=2012|publisher=Pearson|others=Lilienfeld, Scott O., 1960-, O'Donohue, William T.|isbn=9780205698035|location=Boston|oclc=720560483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lakatos claimed that not all changes of the auxiliary hypotheses of a research programme (which he calls 'problem shifts') are equally productive or acceptable. He took the view that these 'problem shifts' should be evaluated not just by their ability to defend the 'hard core' by explaining apparent anomalies, but also by their ability to produce new facts, in the form of predictions or additional explanations.&lt;ref&gt;Theoretical progressiveness is if the new 'theory has more empirical content than the old. Empirical progressiveness is if some of this content is corroborated. (Lakatos ed., 1970, p. 118)&lt;/ref&gt; Adjustments that accomplish nothing more than the maintenance of the 'hard core' mark the research programme as degenerative.

Lakatos' model provides for the possibility of a research programme that is not only continued in the presence of troublesome anomalies but that remains progressive despite them. For Lakatos, it is essentially necessary to continue on with a theory that we basically know cannot be completely true, and it is even possible to make scientific progress in doing so, as long as we remain receptive to a better research programme that may eventually be conceived of. In this sense, it is, for Lakatos, an acknowledged misnomer to refer to 'falsification' or 'refutation', when it is not the truth or falsity of a theory that is solely determining whether we consider it 'falsified', but also the availability of a ''less false'' theory. A theory cannot be rightfully 'falsified', according to Lakatos, until it is superseded by a better (i.e. more progressive) research programme. This is what he says is happening in the historical periods Kuhn describes as revolutions and what makes them rational as opposed to mere leaps of faith or periods of deranged social psychology, as Kuhn argued.

==Pseudoscience==
According to the demarcation criterion of [[pseudoscience]] proposed by Lakatos, a theory is pseudoscientific if it fails to make any novel predictions of previously unknown phenomena or its predictions were mostly falsified, in contrast with scientific theories, which predict novel fact(s).&lt;ref&gt;See/hear Lakatos's 1973 Open University BBC Radio talk ''Science and Pseudoscience'' at his LSE website at www.lse.ac.uk/lakatos&lt;/ref&gt; Progressive scientific theories are those which have their novel facts confirmed and degenerate scientific theories, which can degenerate so much they become pseudo-science, are those whose predictions of novel facts are refuted. As he put it:

"A given fact is explained scientifically only if a new fact is predicted with it....The idea of growth and the concept of empirical character are soldered into one." See pages 34–5 of ''The Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes'', 1978.

Lakatos's own key examples of pseudoscience were [[Ptolemaic system|Ptolemaic]] astronomy, [[Immanuel Velikovsky]]'s planetary cosmogony, [[Freud]]ian [[psychoanalysis]], 20th century [[Soviet Marxism|''Soviet'' Marxism]],&lt;ref&gt;Lakatos notably only condemned specifically ''Soviet'' Marxism as pseudoscientific, as opposed to Marxism in general. In fact at the very end of his very last LSE lectures on Scientific Method in 1973, he finished by posing the question of whether [[Trotsky]]'s theoretical development of Marxism was scientific, and commented that "Nobody has ever undertaken a critical history of Marxism with the aid of better methodological and historiographical instruments. Nobody has ever tried to find an answer to questions like: were Trotsky's unorthodox predictions simply patching up a badly degenerating programme, or did they represent a creative development of Marx's programme? To answer similar questions, we would really need a detailed analysis which takes years of work. So I simply do not know the answer, even if I am very interested in it."[p109 Motterlini 1999]  However, in his 1976 ''On the Critique of Scientific Reason'' Feyerabend claimed [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s development of Marxism in his auxiliary theory of colonial exploitation had been 'Lakatos scientific' because it was "accompanied by a wealth of novel predictions (the arrival and structure of monopolies being one of them)." And he continued by claiming both Rosa Luxemburg's and Trotsky's developments of Marxism were close to what Lakatos regarded as scientific: "And whoever has read Rosa Luxemburg's reply to Bernstein's criticism of Marx or Trotsky's account of why the Russian Revolution took place in a backward country (cf. also Lenin [1968], vol. 19, pp. 99ff.) will see that Marxists are pretty close to what Lakatos would like any upstanding rationalist to do..." [See footnote 9 of p. 315 of Howson (ed.) 1976.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lysenkoism|Lysenko's biology]], [[Niels Bohr]]'s Quantum Mechanics post-1924, [[astrology]], [[psychiatry]], [[sociology]], [[neoclassical economics]], and Darwin's theory.

===Darwin's theory===
In his 1973 LSE Scientific Method Lecture 1&lt;ref&gt;Published in ''For and Against Method: Imre Lakatos and Paul Feyerabend'' by Matteo Motterlini (ed.), University of Chicago Press 1999&lt;/ref&gt; he also claimed that "nobody to date has yet found a demarcation criterion according to which Darwin can be described as scientific".

Almost 20 years after Lakatos's 1973 challenge to the scientificity of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], in her 1991 ''The Ant and the Peacock'', LSE lecturer and ex-colleague of Lakatos, [[Helena Cronin]], attempted to establish that Darwinian theory was empirically scientific in respect of at least being supported by evidence of likeness in the diversity of life forms in the world, explained by descent with modification. She wrote that &lt;blockquote&gt;our usual idea of corroboration as requiring the successful prediction of novel facts...Darwinian theory was not strong on temporally novel predictions. ... however familiar the evidence and whatever role it played in the construction of the theory, it still confirms the theory.&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, H., ''The Ant and the Peacock: Altruism and Sexual Selection from Darwin to Today'', Cambridge University Press, 1993. pp. 31–32. [https://books.google.com/books?id=y0wTY3z3nggC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ant+peacock&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ieWAUvSBNsuS7AaD5IDICg&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=%22For%20darwinian%20theory%2C%20the%20evidence%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Rational reconstructions of the history of science==
In his 1970 paper "History of Science and Its Rational Reconstructions"&lt;ref&gt;Lakatos, Imre. (1970). "History of Science and Its Rational Reconstructions." PSA: ''Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association''. ([https://www.jstor.org/stable/495757 JSTOR link]).&lt;/ref&gt; Lakatos proposed a dialectical historiographical meta-method for evaluating different theories of scientific method, namely by means of their comparative success in explaining the actual [[history of science]] and [[scientific revolution]]s on the one hand, whilst on the other providing a historiographical framework for rationally reconstructing the history of science as anything more than merely inconsequential rambling. The paper started with his now renowned dictum "Philosophy of science without history of science is empty; history of science without philosophy of science is blind."

However, neither Lakatos himself nor his collaborators ever completed the first part of this dictum by showing that in any scientific revolution the great majority of the relevant scientific community converted just when Lakatos's criterion – one programme successfully predicting some novel facts whilst its competitor degenerated – was satisfied. Indeed, for the historical case studies in his 1968 paper "Criticism and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes"&lt;ref name=La68/&gt; he had openly admitted as much, commenting 'In this paper it is not my purpose to go on seriously to the second stage of comparing [[rational reconstruction]]s with actual history for any lack of historicity.'

==Criticism==

===Feyerabend===
[[Paul Feyerabend]] argued that Lakatos's methodology was not a methodology at all, but merely "words that ''sound'' like the elements of a methodology."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.galilean-library.org/manuscript.php?postid=43842 ''How to Defend Society Against Science'']&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that Lakatos's methodology was no different in practice from [[epistemological anarchism]], Feyerabend's own position. He wrote in ''[[Science in a Free Society]]'' (after Lakatos's death) that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Lakatos realized and admitted that the existing standards of rationality, standards of logic included, were too restrictive and would have hindered science had they been applied with determination. He therefore permitted the scientist to violate them (he admits that science is not "rational" in the sense of ''these'' standards). However, he demanded that research programmes show certain features ''in the long run'' — they must be progressive.... I have argued that this demand no longer restricts scientific practice. Any development agrees with it.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Feyerabend (1978). ''Science in a Free Society''. London: NLB. {{ISBN|0-86091-008-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Lakatos and Feyerabend planned to produce a joint work in which Lakatos would develop a rationalist description of science and Feyerabend would attack it. The correspondence between Lakatos and Feyerabend, where the two discussed the project, has since been reproduced, with commentary, by Matteo Motterlini.&lt;ref&gt;Motterlini, M. (1999).

== Investigations ==
The Pennsylvania state Judicial Conduct Board received four complaints about Conahan between 2004 and 2008, but later admitted it failed to investigate any of them, nor had it sought documentation regarding the cases involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jjie.org/2010/03/22/getting-the-juvenile-justice-system-to-grow-up/18/ |title=State Failed to Investigate Complaints in Juvenile Court Kickback Scandal |last=Echols |first=Noah |date=March 22, 2010 |website=Juvenile Justice Information Exchange |access-date=December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI was tipped off about Conahan and [[nepotism]] in the county courts in 2006.&lt;ref name="conduct-board"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://citizensvoice.com/news/lokuta-says-conduct-board-kept-conahan-allegations-under-wraps-1.480057 |title=Lokuta says conduct board kept Conahan allegations under wraps |last=Sisak |first=Michael R. |date=December 12, 2009 |newspaper=[[The Citizens' Voice]] |access-date=December 7, 2016 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214020749/http://citizensvoice.com/news/lokuta-says-conduct-board-kept-conahan-allegations-under-wraps-1.480057 |archive-date=December 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional investigation into improper sentencing in Luzerne County began early in 2007 as a result of requests for assistance from several youths received by the [[Philadelphia]]-based Juvenile Law Center. Attorneys from the center determined that several hundred cases were tried without the defendants receiving proper counsel. In April 2008, the Center petitioned the [[Pennsylvania Supreme Court]] seeking relief for alleged violation of the youths' [[civil rights]]. The application of relief was later denied, then reconsidered in January 2009 when charges of corruption against the judges surfaced.&lt;ref name="jlc-luzerne"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jlc.org/luzerne/ |title=Luzerne County |date=April 27, 2009 |website=Juvenile Law Center |access-date=May 2, 2009 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412100902/http://www.jlc.org/luzerne/ |archive-date=April 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and the [[Internal Revenue Service]] also investigated the two judges, although the exact dates and scope of the investigations by the two federal agencies were not made public.&lt;ref name="hall-summary"/&gt; Part of the investigation was revealed to have occurred during disciplinary hearings over the conduct of another former Luzerne County judge, Ann H.

== Charges and pleas ==
A statement from the office of the [[United States Attorney]] for the Middle District of Pennsylvania outlined the charges against the two judges on January 26, 2009. The charges outlined in the [[Information (formal criminal charge)|information]]&lt;ref name="charges-1-26-09"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/pam/Corruption/Ciavarella_Conahan/conahan%20and%20ciavarella%20information.pdf |title=United States of America v.

The U.S. Attorney charged that in 2002 Conahan, who at the time was President Judge of the court, used his authority to remove funding for the county-operated facility. The judges were alleged to have received "millions of dollars" in payments for the completion of a binding agreement between the court and the private facilities, co-owned by attorney Robert Powell, to use their services and the subsequent closing of the county facility.&lt;ref name="doj-charges" /&gt; The methods used to conceal the payments involved several parties and transactions which resulted in allegations of [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion#Tax evasion|tax evasion]] against the two. Ciavarella and Conahan were also charged with "Ordering juveniles to be sent to these facilities in which the judges had a financial interest even when Juvenile Probation Officers did not recommend placement," according to the statement.&lt;ref name="doj-charges" /&gt;

Original, negotiated plea agreements called for both judges to serve up to seven years in prison, pay fines and restitution, and accept responsibility for the crimes.&lt;ref name="RedFlagsNYT"/&gt; However, on July 30, 2009, Judge [[Edwin M. Kosik]] of [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania|Federal District Court]] in nearby [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] rejected the plea agreement, citing "post-guilty plea conduct and expressions from the defendants" that he ruled did not satisfy the terms of the agreement. Kosik wrote that Conahan and Ciavarella continued to deny their crimes even in the face of overwhelming evidence, and therefore did not merit sentences that were well below federal sentencing guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Plea Agreement by 2 Judges Is Rejected In Pennsylvania |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/01/us/01judge.html |last=Urbina |first=Ian |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 31, 2009 |accessdate=August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kosik-memo"/&gt; Attorneys for the two judges brought a motion requesting reconsideration of the judge's rejection of the plea agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Former Pa.

Following the plea withdrawals, on September 9, 2009, a federal grand jury in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania returned a 48-count indictment&lt;ref name="indictment"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.theweekender.com/documents/INDICTMENT.pdf |title=Indictment – USA v.

Robert Mericle, the prominent real estate developer who built the two juvenile facilities, pleaded guilty on September 3, 2009, to failing to disclose a felony. Mericle had failed to tell a grand jury he had paid $2.1 million to Ciavarella and Conahan as a finder's fee. As part of his plea, Mericle agreed to pay $2.15 million to fund local children's health and welfare programs.

Sandra Brulo, the former Deputy Director of Forensic Services for the Luzerne County Juvenile Probation Office, agreed to plead guilty in March 2009 to federal obstruction of justice. Those charges stemmed from actions Brulo took after she became aware she had been named in the federal civil action. Brulo backdated her recommendation of a placement she made concerning a juvenile defendant in September 2007, and changed her original recommendation of placement to probation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=United States v.

== Criminal verdicts and sentences ==
[[File:Mark Ciavarella.jpg|thumb|[[Mark Ciavarella]] booking photo]]
On February 18, 2011, following a trial, a federal jury convicted Ciavarella on 12 of the 39 remaining counts he faced including racketeering, a crime in which prosecutors said the former judge used children "as pawns to enrich himself." In convicting Ciavarella of racketeering, the jury agreed with prosecutors that he and Conahan had taken an illegal payment of nearly $1 million from a youth center's builder, then hid the money.&lt;ref name="philly20110218"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ex-judge Mark A.

The panel of six men and six women also found Ciavarella guilty of "honest services mail fraud" and of being a tax cheat, for failing to list that money and more on his annual public financial-disclosure forms and on four years of tax returns. In addition, they found him guilty of conspiring to launder money. The jurors acquitted Ciavarella of extortion and bribery in connection with $1.9 million that prosecutors said the judges extracted from the builder and owner of two youth centers, including allegations that Ciavarella shared the proceeds of FedEx boxes that were stuffed with tens of thousands of dollars in cash.

Following Ciavarella's conviction, he and his lawyer appeared on the steps of the courthouse to give an impromptu press conference. The press conference was interrupted by Sandy Fonzo, whose son Edward Kenzakoski committed suicide after Ciavarella adjudicated him to placement, despite Kenzakoski's first-time offender status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2011/02/mom_blames_luzerne_county_judg.html |title=Mom blames son's suicide on Luzerne County judge in 'kids for cash' case |newspaper=[[The Patriot-News]] |accessdate=17 September 2014 |agency=Associated Press |date=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Ciavarella has continued to appeal, contending that the Supreme Court's decision in the [[McDonnell v.

== Interbranch Commission on Juvenile Justice ==
In the aftermath of the federal charges and defendant pleas, the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] moved to create a commission to investigate the entire set of circumstances surrounding the miscarriage of justice in Luzerne County. Sponsored by [[Todd A. Eachus|Representative Todd Eachus]] of [[Butler Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Butler Township]] in Luzerne County, House Bill 1648&lt;ref name="hb1648"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;sessYr=2009&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=H&amp;billTyp=B&amp;billNbr=1648&amp;pn=2294 |title=House Bill No. 1648 |date=June 25, 2009 |website=The Pennsylvania General Assembly |accessdate=August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; established the Interbranch Commission on Juvenile Justice in July 2009. The commission comprises 11 members, appointed from each branch of government in Pennsylvania, with four members chosen by the judiciary, four by the legislature and three by the governor.&lt;ref name="rendell-ICJJ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.prnewswire.com/DisplayReleaseContent.aspx?ACCT=ind_focus.story&amp;STORY=/www/story/08-07-2009/0005074011&amp;EDATE= |title=Governor Rendell Signs Bill Creating Commission to Probe Juvenile Justice System |date=August 7, 2009 |website=Pennsylvania Office of the Governor |accessdate=August 26, 2009 |df= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902182032/http://news.prnewswire.com/DisplayReleaseContent.aspx?ACCT=ind_focus.story&amp;STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F08-07-2009%2F0005074011&amp;EDATE= |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In signing the legislation on August 7, 2009, Governor [[Ed Rendell]] castigated Ciavarella and Conahan, saying they "violated the rights of as many as 6000 young people by denying them basic rights to counsel and handing down outrageously excessive sentences. The lives of these young people and their families were changed forever."&lt;ref name="rendell-ICJJ" /&gt; Scheduled to meet a minimum of once per month, the commission was organized to investigate the actions of and damages caused by the two judges and review the state of the Luzerne County courts left in the wake of their tenures.&lt;ref name="swift-icjj"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://citizensvoice.com/news/juvenile_justice_commission_s_first_meeting_set_for_next_week |title=Juvenile justice commission's first meeting set for next week |last=Swift |first=Robert |date=August 21, 2009 |newspaper=The Citizen's Voice |accessdate=August 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902065824/http://citizensvoice.com/news/juvenile_justice_commission_s_first_meeting_set_for_next_week |archivedate=September 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pahouse-icjj"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pahouse.com/PR/122081709.asp |title=Democratic leaders name nationally recognized expert to Interbranch Commission on Juvenile Justice |date=August 17, 2009 |website=Pennsylvania House Democratic Caucus |accessdate=August 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission was given power of [[subpoena]] and was required to complete its work and report its recommendations and findings to the three branches of state government by May 31, 2010.&lt;ref name="swift-icjj2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://citizensvoice.com/news/rendell_to_sign_legislation_creating_corruption_commission |title=Rendell to sign legislation creating corruption commission |last=Swift |first=Robert |date=August 7, 2009 |newspaper=The Citizen's Voice |accessdate=August 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902065920/http://citizensvoice.com/news/rendell_to_sign_legislation_creating_corruption_commission |archivedate=September 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scandal has also led to several portrayals in fictional works. The ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' episode "[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 10)#ep222|Crush]]", the ''[[CSI: NY]]'' episode "Crossroads",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csifiles.com/content/2012/07/review-csi-new-york-crossroads/ |title=Review: CSI: New York — 'Crossroads' |last=Trongo |first=Rachel |date=2012 |website=CSI Files.com |access-date=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an episode of ''[[The Good Wife]]'' featured corrupt judges sending children to private detention centers.

Parker, wrote ''Kickback'', which borrows heavily from this case, transposing it into a Boston suburb instead. An episode of ''[[Billions (TV series)|Billions]]'' called "Quality of Life" has a subplot inspired by the scandal in which a New York City judge sentences youths harshly for financial gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joshua |last=Alston |url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/bobby-buries-one-his-own-solid-empty-billions-234440 |title=Bobby buries one of his own in a solid but empty Billions |website=The AV Club |date=March 28, 2016 |accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel ''Corrupted'' by Lisa Scottoline includes the scandal, portraying characters in the book as victims of the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Scottoline |first=Lisa |date=2015 |title=Corrupted: A Rosato and DiNuzio Novel |publisher=St. Martin's Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Leo Mechelin 1900.jpg|thumb|right|Leo Mechelin]]
'''Leopold (Leo) Henrik Stanislaus Mechelin''' (24 November 1839 in [[Hamina]], Finland – 26 January 1914 in [[Helsinki]], Finland) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] professor, statesman, senator and [[Liberalism|liberal]] reformer. A leading defender of the [[autonomy]] of the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], and of the rights of women and minorities, Mechelin's 1905–1908 government
("Mechelin's Senate") made Finland the first nation in the world with the [[Universal suffrage|universal right to vote]] and to be elected. During his period in office the freedom of [[freedom of expression|expression]], the [[freedom of press|press]], and of [[freedom of assembly|assembly]] were introduced.

==Career==
He also founded the [[Liberal Party of Finland]] (1880–1885), wrote its program, was one of the founders of the Union Bank of Finland 1862 (now part of Nordea Bank) and co-founded the [[Nokia|Nokia Company]] (1871) with [[Fredrik Idestam]], was the first chairman of the [[town council]] of [[Helsinki]] (1875–1876 and 1892–1899) and an internationally respected expert on politology and member of peace movement. Emperor Alexander II ennobled Mechelin 1876.

Mechelin led the passive resistance in Finland during the [[Russification of Finland|first period of oppression]] (1899–1905) until and even after his banishment (1903), from which officials had to let him return as a member of parliament (House of Nobles) 1904, welcomed by a celebrating crowd of 10,000 people. In a secret meeting of the [[Kagaali]], Mechelin had written a petition against the draft of Finns to the Russian army, which collected almost 500,000 signatures. His coalition, the Constitutionals, managed to end the draft through boycott.

==Biography==
[[File:Leo Mechelin Bust.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Leo Mechelin's bust in [[Helsinki]].]]
Born in [[Hamina]] in 1839, the son of Gustaf Johan Mechelin and Amanda Gustava Costiander, Leo Mechelin studied at the [[University of Helsinki]], gaining his [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]] and [[Master's degree|Master's]] degree's in [[Philosophy]] in 1860, a bachelor's degree in law in 1864, and a [[Licentiate (degree)|License]] and [[Doctorate]] in 1873.

As professor of jurisdiction and politology 1874-82, Mechelin had argued that the tsars were bound by the [[Swedish Constitution of 1772|old constitutional laws]] from the time of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] rule of Finland (before 1809), and hence affirmed that Finland was a separate, constitutional state, which the tsar could only rule by law, whereas in Russia he had absolute power. During the periods of oppression, the tsar tried to impose unconstitutional laws, which Mechelin opposed. The [[Russian Revolution of 1905|unrests in Russia]] and [[Finnish general strike of 1905|Finland]] (1905) finally compelled the tsar to comply with the [[November Manifesto]] written by Mechelin. This allowed Mechelin to form a government (1905–1908) and to transform Finland into what was in many respects the first [[liberal democracy]] (e.g., in [[New Zealand]] women already had the right to vote but not to be voted; in [[Australia]] only white people had those rights) in 1906. In 1907, the first universal elections to the one-chamber [[Parliament of Finland|parliament]] ("eduskunta") were held, and 19 of its 200 first members were women. However, the constitutionals of all parties did not obtain the majority of seats, and the tsar realised that he could carry on with the oppression, starting the [[Russification of Finland|second period of oppression]] (1908–1917). After Mechelin's death (in 1914), the two revolutions in Russia allowed  Finland to declare its independence (1917) and Mechelin's younger co-workers were able to complete his work.

[[Nokia]], once a world-leading [[mobile phone]] corporation, was founded by Mechelin and his student days' roommate [[Fredrik Idestam]] as a [[forestry]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=HugmyrqibtwC&amp;pg=PA271&amp;dq=leo+mechelin+and+nokia&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit75W7ydbVAhXGWBQKHe7YDoYQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=leo%20mechelin%20and%20nokia&amp;f=false|title=Wireless Horizon: Strategy and Competition in the Worldwide Mobile Marketplace|last=Steinbock|first=Dan|date=2003|publisher=AMACOM Div American Mgmt Assn|isbn=9780814407141|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Mechelin's wish to expand into the electricity business was at first thwarted by Idestam's opposition, but Mechelin managed to convince most shareholders of his plans and became the company chairman (1898–1914), thus being able to realise his visions.

Mechelin was also active in [[civil society]] and President of the current [[University of Art and Design Helsinki]] and of the [[Finnish Art Society]]. As a politician he was always highly respected among all parties and citizens, although after the dissolution of the Liberal Party (1885) he never joined any other party.

Mechelin demanded peaceful [[nonviolent resistance]] and did not bend even during hard times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =  https://kansallisbiografia.fi/kansallisbiografia/henkilo/3553 | title = Mechelin, Leo (1839 - 1914) | author = Tapio Helen | date = 1997-09-16 | publisher = Biografiakeskus | access-date = 2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This effect is called [[electroluminescence]], and the color of the light (corresponding to the energy of the photon) is determined by the energy [[band gap]] of the semiconductor. LEDs are typically small (less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and integrated optical components may be used to shape the [[radiation pattern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moreno|first=Ivan|last2=Sun|first2=Ching-Cherng|date=2008-02-04|title=Modeling the radiation pattern of LEDs|journal=Optics Express|volume=16|issue=3|pages=1808–1819|doi=10.1364/oe.16.001808|bibcode=2008OExpr..16.1808M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appearing as practical electronic components in 1962, the earliest LEDs emitted low-intensity infrared light.&lt;ref name=FirstPracticalLED /&gt;
Infrared LEDs are still frequently used as transmitting elements in remote-control circuits, such as those in remote controls for a wide variety of consumer electronics.
The first visible-light LEDs were of low intensity and limited to red. Modern LEDs are available across the [[visible spectrum|visible]], [[ultraviolet]], and [[infrared]] wavelengths, with very high brightness.

Early LEDs were often used as indicator lamps for electronic devices, replacing small incandescent bulbs. They were soon packaged into numeric readouts in the form of [[seven-segment display]]s and were commonly seen in digital clocks. Recent developments have produced LEDs suitable for environmental and task lighting. LEDs have led to new displays and sensors, while their high switching rates are useful in advanced communications technology.

LEDs have many advantages over incandescent light sources, including lower energy consumption, longer lifetime, improved physical robustness, smaller size, and faster switching. Light-emitting diodes are used in applications as diverse as [[navigation light#Aviation navigation lights|aviation lighting]], [[automotive lighting#Light emitting diodes (LED)|automotive headlamps]], advertising, [[Lighting|general lighting]], [[traffic signal]]s, camera flashes, lighted wallpaper and medical devices.&lt;ref name=Aguilar&gt;{{Cite book|pmid=18002450|doi= 10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4352784|year= 2007|last1= Peláez|first1= E.

In 1936, [[Georges Destriau]] observed that electroluminescence could be produced when [[zinc sulphide]] (ZnS) powder is suspended in an insulator and an alternating electrical field is applied to it. In his publications, Destriau often referred to luminescence as Losev-Light. Destriau worked in the laboratories of Madame [[Marie Curie]], also an early pioneer in the field of luminescence with research on [[radium]].&lt;ref name="ChemiePhysique"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Braunstein observed infrared emission generated by simple diode structures using [[gallium antimonide]] (GaSb), GaAs, [[indium phosphide]] (InP), and [[silicon-germanium]] (SiGe) alloys at room temperature and at 77&amp;nbsp;Kelvin.

In 1957, Braunstein further demonstrated that the rudimentary devices could be used for non-radio communication across a short distance.  As noted by Kroemer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kroemer |first1=Herbert |title=The Double-Heterostructure Concept: How It Got Started |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|date=Sep 16, 2013 |volume=101 |issue=10 |pages=2183–2187 |doi=10.1109/JPROC.2013.2274914}}&lt;/ref&gt; Braunstein "…had set up a simple optical communications link: Music emerging from a record player was used via suitable electronics to modulate the forward current of a GaAs diode. The emitted light was detected by a PbS diode some distance away. This signal was fed into an audio amplifier and played back by a loudspeaker. Intercepting the beam stopped the music. We had a great deal of fun playing with this setup." This setup presaged the use of LEDs for optical communication applications.

In September 1961, while working at [[Texas Instruments]] in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], [[James R.

After establishing the priority of their work based on engineering notebooks predating submissions from [[G.E.]] Labs, [[RCA]] Research Labs, [[IBM]] Research Labs, [[Bell Labs]], and [[Lincoln Lab]] at [[MIT]], the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. patent office]] issued the two inventors the patent for the GaAs infrared (IR) light-emitting diode (U.S. Patent [http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3293513.pdf US3293513]), the first practical LED.&lt;ref name=FirstPracticalLED /&gt; Immediately after filing the patent, [[Texas Instruments]] (TI) began a project to manufacture infrared diodes.

===Initial commercial development===
The first commercial LEDs were commonly used as replacements for [[incandescence|incandescent]] and [[neon lamp|neon]] indicator lamps, and in [[seven-segment display]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.datamath.org/Display/Monsanto.htm | title=LEDs cast Monsanto in Unfamiliar Role | author=Rostky, George | journal=Electronic Engineering Times (EETimes) |date=March 1997 | issue=944}}&lt;/ref&gt; first in expensive equipment such as laboratory and electronics test equipment, then later in such appliances as TVs, radios, telephones, calculators, as well as watches (see list of [[#Indicators and signs|signal uses]]).
Until 1968, visible and infrared LEDs were extremely costly, in the order of [[United States dollar|US$]]200 per unit, and so had little practical use.&lt;ref name="Schubert" /&gt;
The [[Monsanto Company]] was the first organization to mass-produce visible LEDs, using gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) in 1968 to produce red LEDs suitable for indicators.&lt;ref name="Schubert"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Schubert, E. Fred |title=Light-Emitting Diodes|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|chapter=1|isbn=978-0-8194-3956-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP) introduced LEDs in 1968, initially using GaAsP supplied by Monsanto. These red LEDs were bright enough only for use as indicators, as the light output was not enough to illuminate an area. Readouts in calculators were so small that plastic lenses were built over each digit to make them legible. Later, other colors became widely available and appeared in appliances and equipment. In the 1970s commercially successful LED devices at less than five cents each were produced by Fairchild Optoelectronics. These devices employed compound semiconductor chips fabricated with the [[planar process]] invented by Dr. Jean Hoerni at [[Fairchild Semiconductor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | title=Method of Manufacturing Semiconductor Devices |country=US |number=3025589 | author=Hoerni, J.A. |fdate=May 1, 1959 |gdate=Mar 20, 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US3025589 Patent number: 3025589] Retrieved May 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of planar processing for chip fabrication and innovative packaging methods enabled the team at Fairchild led by optoelectronics pioneer Thomas Brandt to achieve the needed cost reductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| author=Bausch, Jeffrey |title =The Long History of Light Emitting Diodes |url=http://www.electronicproducts.com/Optoelectronics/LEDs/The_long_history_of_light-emitting_diodes.aspx|publisher =Hearst Business Communications  |date= December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  LED producers continue to use these methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Most LEDs were made in the very common 5&amp;nbsp;mm T1¾ and 3&amp;nbsp;mm T1 packages, but with rising power output, it has grown increasingly necessary to shed excess heat to maintain reliability,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lunaraccents.com/educational-LED-thermal-management.html LED Thermal Management].

The first high-brightness blue LED was demonstrated by [[Shuji Nakamura]] of [[Nichia Corporation]] in 1994 and was based on [[indium gallium nitride|InGaN]].&lt;ref name="Nakamura"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Candela-Class High-Brightness InGaN/AlGaN Double-Heterostructure Blue-Light-Emitting-Diodes | last1=Nakamura | first1=S. | last2=Mukai | first2=T. | last3=Senoh | first3=M. | journal=Appl.

===White LEDs and the illumination breakthrough===
Even though white light can be created using individual red, green and blue LEDs, perhaps using a single SMD (Surface Mount Device) or through-hole RGB LED, this setup results in poor color rendering or CRI, due to the fact that  virtually only 3 wavelengths of light are being emitted, so the attainment of high efficiency in blue LEDs was quickly followed by the development of the first [[#Phosphor-based LEDs|white LED]]. In this device a {{chem|Y|3|Al|5|O|12}}:Ce (known as "[[YAG]]") [[cerium]] doped phosphor coating on the emitter absorbs some of the blue emission and produces yellow light through [[fluorescence]]. The combination of that yellow with remaining blue light appears white to the eye. However, using different [[phosphor]]s (fluorescent materials) it also became possible to instead produce green and red light through fluorescence. The resulting mixture of red, green and blue is not only perceived by humans as white light but is superior for illumination in terms of [[color rendering]], whereas one cannot appreciate the color of red or green objects illuminated only by the yellow (and remaining blue) wavelengths from the YAG phosphor.

The first white LEDs were expensive and inefficient. However, the light output of LEDs has increased [[exponential growth|exponentially]], with a doubling occurring approximately every 36 months since the 1960s (similar to [[Moore's law]]). The latest research and development has been propagated by Japanese manufacturers such as [[Panasonic]], [[Nichia]], etc. and later by Korean and Chinese factories and investment such as: [[Samsung]], [[Samsung|Solstice]], Kingsun, and countless others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ledcornbulbs.com/LEDlightsapplication/List-of-Top-10-LED-light-manufacturer-in-China-19.html List of Top 10 LED light manufacturer in China].

Light output and efficiency of blue and near-ultraviolet LEDs rose as the cost of reliable devices fell.

U.S. Energy Information Administration (March 19, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The LED chip is encapsulated inside a small, plastic, white mold. It can be encapsulated using resin, silicone, or epoxy containing (powdered) Cerium doped YAG phosphor. After allowing the solvents to evaporate, the LEDs are often tested, and placed on tapes for [[SMT placement equipment]] for use in LED light bulb production.  Encapsulation is performed after probing, dicing, die transfer from wafer to package, and wire bonding or flip chip mounting, perhaps using [[Indium tin oxide]], a transparent electrical conductor. In this case, the bond wire(s) are attached to the ITO film that has been deposited in the LEDs.

The YAG phosphor in the LED's encapsulation compound is why white LEDs look yellow when off. Some LED light bulbs use a single plastic cover with YAG phosphor (remote phosphor) for several blue LEDs instead of using a diffuser and single chip white LEDs. Remote phosphor LED light bulbs may have behind the plastic cover a white plastic reflector. Others shape the remote phosphor as a dome, or sphere, and place it atop a single PCB containing blue LEDs; this assembly may be behind a frosted glass or plastic cover. The PCB is often installed atop a pillar, which is lined with white plastic.

==Working principle==
[[File:PnJunction-LED-E.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The inner workings of an LED, showing circuit (top) and [[band diagram]] (bottom)]]

A P-N junction can convert absorbed light energy into a proportional electric current. The same process is reversed here (i.e. the P-N junction emits light when electrical energy is applied to it). This phenomenon is generally called [[electroluminescence]], which can be defined as the emission of light from a [[semiconductor]] under the influence of an [[electric field]]. The charge carriers recombine in a forward-biased P-N junction as the electrons cross from the N-region and recombine with the holes existing in the P-region. Free electrons are in the [[conduction band]] of energy levels, while holes are in the valence [[energy band]]. Thus the energy level of the holes is less than the energy levels of the electrons. Some portion of the energy must be dissipated to recombine the electrons and the holes. This energy is emitted in the form of heat and light.

The electrons dissipate energy in the form of heat for silicon and germanium diodes but in [[gallium arsenide phosphide]] (GaAsP) and [[gallium phosphide]] (GaP) semiconductors, the electrons dissipate energy by emitting [[photon]]s. If the semiconductor is translucent, the junction becomes the source of light as it is emitted, thus becoming a light-emitting diode. However, when the junction is reverse biased, the LED produces no light and—if the potential is great enough, the device is damaged.

==Technology==
[[File:Diode-IV-Curve.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|I-V diagram for a [[diode]]. An LED begins to emit light when more than 2 or 3 volts is applied. The reverse bias region uses a different vertical scale from the forward bias region to show that the leakage current is nearly constant with voltage until breakdown occurs. In forward bias, the current is small but increases exponentially with voltage.]]

===Physics===
The LED consists of a chip of semiconducting material [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] with impurities to create a ''[[p-n junction]]''. As in other diodes, current flows easily from the p-side, or [[anode]], to the n-side, or cathode, but not in the reverse direction. Charge-carriers—[[electron]]s and [[electron hole|holes]]—flow into the junction from [[electrode]]s with different voltages. When an electron meets a hole, it falls into a lower [[energy level]] and releases [[energy]] in the form of a [[photon]].

The [[wavelength]] of the light emitted, and thus its color, depends on the [[band gap]] energy of the materials forming the ''p-n junction''. In [[silicon]] or [[germanium]] diodes, the electrons and holes usually recombine by a ''non-radiative transition'', which produces no optical emission, because these are [[indirect band gap]] materials. The materials used for the LED have a [[direct band gap]] with energies corresponding to near-infrared, visible, or near-ultraviolet light.

LED development began with infrared and red devices made with [[gallium arsenide]]. Advances in [[materials science]] have enabled making devices with ever-shorter wavelengths, emitting light in a variety of colors.

LEDs are usually built on an [[Extrinsic semiconductor#P-type semiconductors|n-type substrate]], with an electrode attached to the p-type layer deposited on its surface. [[Extrinsic semiconductor#P-type semiconductors|P-type substrates]], while less common, occur as well. Many commercial LEDs, especially GaN/InGaN, also use [[sapphire]] substrate.

=== Refractive index ===

The left illustration is for a translucent wafer, while the right illustration shows the half-cones formed when the bottom layer is opaque. 
The light is actually emitted equally in all directions from the point-source, but can only escape perpendicular to the semiconductor's surface and some degrees to the side, which is illustrated by the cone shapes. When the critical angle is exceeded, photons are reflected internally. The areas between the cones represent the trapped light energy wasted as heat.&lt;ref name="critical" /&gt;]]

[[File:LED light emission cones from 2D plane emission zone.png|thumb|upright=1.35|
Most materials used for LED production have very high [[refractive index|refractive indices]]. This means that much of the light is reflected back into the material at the material/air surface interface. Thus, [[light extraction in LEDs]] is an important aspect of LED production, subject to much research and development.
The light emission cones of a real LED wafer are far more complex than a single point-source light emission. The light emission zone is typically a two-dimensional plane between the wafers. Every atom across this plane has an individual set of emission cones.
Drawing the billions of overlapping cones is impossible, so this is a simplified diagram showing the extents of all the emission cones combined. The larger side cones are clipped to show the interior features and reduce image complexity; they would extend to the opposite edges of the two-dimensional emission plane.]]

Bare uncoated semiconductors such as [[silicon]] exhibit a very high [[refractive index]] relative to open air, which prevents passage of [[photon]]s arriving at sharp angles relative to the air-contacting surface of the semiconductor due to [[total internal reflection]]. This property affects both the light-emission efficiency of LEDs as well as the light-absorption efficiency of [[photovoltaic cell]]s. The refractive index of silicon is set at 3.96 (at 590&amp;nbsp;nm),&lt;ref name="si_website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pvcdrom.pveducation.org/APPEND/OPTICAL.HTM|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605222316/http://pvcdrom.pveducation.org/APPEND/OPTICAL.HTM |archivedate=2009-06-05|title=Optical Properties of Silicon |website=PVCDROM.PVEducation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; while air's refractive index is set at 1.0002926.&lt;ref&gt;[http://interactagram.com/physics/optics/refraction/ Refraction&amp;nbsp;— Snell's Law]. Interactagram.com. Retrieved on March 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, a flat-surface uncoated LED semiconductor chip emits light only perpendicular to the semiconductor's surface, and a few degrees to the side, in a cone shape referred to as the ''light cone'', ''cone of light'',&lt;ref&gt;Lipták, Bela G. (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=TxKynbyaIAMC&amp;lpg=PA537 Instrument Engineers' Handbook: Process control and optimization], CRC Press, {{ISBN|0-8493-1081-4}} p. 537, "cone of light" in context of optical fibers&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''escape cone''.&lt;ref name="critical"&gt;Mueller, Gerd (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2plxAU3tPj4C&amp;lpg=PA67 Electroluminescence I], Academic Press, {{ISBN|0-12-752173-9}}, p. 67, "escape cone of light" from semiconductor, illustrations of light cones on p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] is referred to as the [[critical angle (optics)|critical angle]]. When the critical angle is exceeded, photons no longer escape the semiconductor but are, instead, reflected internally inside the semiconductor crystal as if it were a [[mirror]].&lt;ref name="critical"/&gt;

[[Internal reflection]]s can escape through other crystalline faces if the incidence angle is low enough and the crystal is sufficiently transparent to not re-absorb the photon emission. But for a simple square LED with 90-degree angled surfaces on all sides, the faces all act as equal angle mirrors. In this case, most of the light can not escape and is lost as [[waste heat]] in the crystal.&lt;ref name="critical"/&gt;

A convoluted chip surface with angled [[facet]]s similar to a jewel or [[fresnel lens]] can increase light output by distributing light perpendicular to the chip surface and far to the sides of the photon emission point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Capper, Peter  |author2=Mauk, Michael  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IfLGPRJDfqgC&amp;lpg=PA389 |title=Liquid phase epitaxy of electronic, optical, and optoelectronic materials|publisher= Wiley|year=2007|isbn=978-0-470-85290-3| page=389|quote=faceted structures are of interest for solar cells, LEDs, thermophotovoltaic devices, and detectors in that nonplanar surfaces and facets can enhance optical coupling and light-trapping effects, [with example microphotograph of a faceted crystal substrate].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideal shape of a semiconductor with maximum light output would be a [[microsphere]] with the photon emission occurring at the exact center, with electrodes penetrating to the center to contact at the emission point. All light rays emanating from the center would be perpendicular to the entire surface of the sphere, resulting in no internal reflections. A hemispherical semiconductor would also work, with the flat back-surface serving as a mirror to back-scattered photons.&lt;ref&gt;Dakin, John and Brown, Robert G. W. (eds.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=3GmcgL7Z-6YC&amp;lpg=PA356 Handbook of optoelectronics, Volume 2], Taylor &amp; Francis, 2006 {{ISBN|0-7503-0646-7}} p. 356, "Die shaping is a step towards the ideal solution, that of a point light source at the center of a spherical semiconductor die."&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Transition coatings ====
After the doping of the [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]], it is usually cut apart into individual [[die (integrated circuit)|dies]]. Each die is commonly called a chip.

Many LED semiconductor chips are encapsulated or [[Potting (electronics)|potted]] in clear or colored molded solid plastic. The plastic encapsulation has three purposes:
# Mounting the semiconductor chip in devices is easier to accomplish. 
# The tiny fragile electrical wiring is physically supported and protected from damage.
# The plastic acts as a refractive intermediary between the relatively high-index semiconductor and low-index open air.&lt;ref&gt;Schubert, E. Fred (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=0H4bWIpaXb0C&amp;lpg=PA97 Light-emitting diodes], Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-86538-7}} p. 97, "Epoxy Encapsulants", "The light extraction efficiency can be enhanced by using dome-shaped encapsulants with a large refractive index."&lt;/ref&gt;
The third feature helps to boost the light emission from the semiconductor by acting as a diffusing lens, emitting light at a much higher angle of incidence from the light cone than the bare chip would alone.

===Efficiency and operational parameters===
Typical indicator LEDs are designed to operate with no more than 30–60 [[milliwatt]]s (mW) of electrical power. Around 1999, [[Philips Lumileds Lighting Company|Philips Lumileds]] introduced power LEDs capable of continuous use at one [[watt]]. These LEDs used much larger semiconductor die sizes to handle the large power inputs. Also, the semiconductor dies were mounted onto metal slugs to allow for greater heat dissipation from the LED die.

One of the key advantages of LED-based lighting sources is high [[luminous efficacy]]. White LEDs quickly matched and overtook the efficacy of standard incandescent lighting systems. In 2002, Lumileds made five-watt LEDs available with luminous efficacy of 18–22 lumens per watt (lm/W). For comparison, a conventional [[incandescent light bulb]] of 60–100 watts emits around 15&amp;nbsp;lm/W, and standard [[fluorescent light]]s emit up to 100&amp;nbsp;lm/W.

{{As of|2012}}, [[Philips]] had achieved the following efficacies for each color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philipslumileds.com/uploads/221/PG01-pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314111003/http://www.philipslumileds.com/uploads/221/PG01-pdf |title=All in 1 LED Lighting Solutions Guide|website=PhilipsLumileds.com|publisher=[[Philips]]|page=15|date=2012-10-04|archivedate=March 14, 2013 |accessdate=2015-11-18|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efficiency values show the physics – light power out per electrical power in. The lumen-per-watt efficacy value includes characteristics of the human eye and is derived using the [[luminosity function]].

In September 2003, a new type of blue LED was demonstrated by [[Cree Inc.|Cree]]. This produced a commercially packaged white light giving 65&amp;nbsp;lm/W at 20 mA, becoming the brightest white LED commercially available at the time, and more than four times as efficient as standard incandescents. In 2006, they demonstrated a prototype with a record white LED luminous efficacy of 131&amp;nbsp;lm/W at 20&amp;nbsp;mA. [[Nichia Corporation]] has developed a white LED with luminous efficacy of 150&amp;nbsp;lm/W at a forward current of 20&amp;nbsp;mA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20061221/125713/ |title=Nichia Unveils White LED with 150&amp;nbsp;lm/W Luminous Efficiency |publisher=Tech-On! |date=December 21, 2006 |accessdate=August 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cree's XLamp XM-L LEDs, commercially available in 2011, produce 100&amp;nbsp;lm/W at their full power of 10&amp;nbsp;W, and up to 160&amp;nbsp;lm/W at around 2&amp;nbsp;W input power. In 2012, Cree announced a white LED giving 254&amp;nbsp;lm/W,&lt;ref&gt;[http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20120423/214494/ "Cree Sets New Record for White LED Efficiency"], Tech-On, April 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and 303&amp;nbsp;lm/W in March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cree.com/News-and-Events/Cree-News/Press-Releases/2014/March/300LPW-LED-barrier "Cree First to Break 300 Lumens-Per-Watt Barrier"], Cree news&lt;/ref&gt;
Practical general lighting needs high-power LEDs, of one watt or more. Typical operating currents for such devices begin at 350&amp;nbsp;mA.

These efficiencies are for the light-emitting diode only, held at low temperature in a lab. Since LEDs installed in real fixtures operate at higher temperature and with driver losses, real-world efficiencies are much lower. [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) testing of commercial LED lamps designed to replace incandescent lamps or [[Compact fluorescent lamp|CFLs]] showed that average efficacy was still about 46 lm/W in 2009 (tested performance ranged from 17&amp;nbsp;lm/W to 79&amp;nbsp;lm/W).&lt;ref name="doe"&gt;

====Efficiency droop====
{{anchor|LED droop}}{{anchor|Droop (LED)}}Efficiency droop is the decrease in luminous efficiency of LEDs as the [[electric current]] increases above tens of milliamperes.

This effect was initially thought related to elevated temperatures. Scientists proved the opposite is true: though the life of an LED is shortened, the efficiency droop is less severe at elevated temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digikey.com/us/en/techzone/lighting/resources/articles/identifying-the-causes-of-led-efficiency-droop.html Identifying the Causes of LED Efficiency Droop] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213073051/http://www.digikey.com/us/en/techzone/lighting/resources/articles/identifying-the-causes-of-led-efficiency-droop.html |date=December 13, 2013 }}, By Steven Keeping, Digi-Key Corporation Tech Zone&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism causing efficiency droop was identified in 2007 as [[Auger recombination]], which was taken with mixed reaction.&lt;ref name="stevenson" /&gt; In 2013, a study confirmed Auger recombination as the cause of efficiency droop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Justin |last1=Iveland |first2=Lucio |last2=Martinelli |first3=Jacques |last3=Peretti |first4=James S. |last4=Speck |first5=Claude |last5=Weisbuch |title=Cause of LED Efficiency Droop Finally Revealed |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/04/130423102328.htm |website=Physical Review Letters, 2013 |publisher=Science Daily|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being less efficient, operating LEDs at higher electric currents creates higher heat levels, which can compromise LED lifetime. Because of this increased heat at higher currents, [[Light-emitting diode#High-power|high-brightness LEDs]] have an industry standard of operating at only 350&amp;nbsp;mA, which is a compromise between light output, efficiency, and longevity.&lt;ref name=stevenson&gt;Stevenson, Richard (August 2009) [http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/optoelectronics/the-leds-dark-secret The LED’s Dark Secret: Solid-state lighting won't supplant the lightbulb until it can overcome the mysterious malady known as droop].

=====Possible solutions=====
Instead of increasing current levels, luminance is usually increased by combining multiple LEDs in one bulb. Solving the problem of efficiency droop would mean that household LED light bulbs would need fewer LEDs, which would significantly reduce costs.

Researchers at the [[U.S. Naval Research Laboratory]] have found a way to lessen the efficiency droop. They found that the droop arises from [[non-radiative recombination|non-radiative]] Auger recombination of the injected carriers. They created quantum wells with a soft confinement potential to lessen the non-radiative Auger processes.&lt;ref&gt;McKinney, Donna (19 February 2014) [http://www.nrl.navy.mil/media/news-releases/2014/a-roadmap-to-efficient-green-blue-ultraviolet-light-emitting-diodes A Roadmap to Efficient Green-Blue-Ultraviolet Light-Emitting Diodes], U.S. Naval Research Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at [[Taiwan National Central University]] and [[Epistar Corp]] are developing a way to lessen the efficiency droop by using ceramic aluminium nitride (AlN) substrates, which are more [[Thermal conductivity|thermally conductive]] than the commercially used sapphire. The higher thermal conductivity reduces self-heating effects.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, Mike (11 February 2014) [http://www.semiconductor-today.com/news_items/2014/FEB/EPISTAR_110214.shtml Enabling high-voltage InGaN LED operation with ceramic substrate], ''Semiconductor Today''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lifetime and failure===
{{Main|List of LED failure modes}}

Solid-state devices such as LEDs are subject to very limited [[wear and tear]] if operated at low currents and at low temperatures. Typical lifetimes quoted are 25,000 to 100,000 hours, but heat and current settings can extend or shorten this time significantly.&lt;ref name=eere&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/ssl/lifetime.html |title=Lifetime of White LEDs |accessdate=2009-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410145015/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/ssl/lifetime.html |archivedate=April 10, 2009 |df=mdy }}, US Department of Energy&lt;/ref&gt; One way to cool down the LED and use the energy efficiently, is to blink the LED in order to gain biomass for example in microalgae cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2015.12.057|pmid=26747205|title=Flashing light in microalgae biotechnology|journal=Bioresource Technology|volume=203|pages=357–363|year=2016|last1=Abu-Ghosh|first1=Said|last2=Fixler|first2=Dror|last3=Dubinsky|first3=Zvy|last4=Iluz|first4=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that these projections are based on a standard test that may not accelerate all the potential mechanisms that can induce failures in LEDs.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, J.

The most common symptom of LED (and [[diode laser]]) failure is the gradual lowering of light output and loss of efficiency. Sudden failures, although rare, can also occur. Early red LEDs were notable for their short service life. With the development of high-power LEDs, the devices are subjected to higher [[junction temperature]]s and higher current densities than traditional devices. This causes stress on the material and may cause early light-output degradation. To quantify useful lifetime in a standardized manner, some suggest using L70 or L50, which are runtimes (typically in thousands of hours) at which a given LED reaches 70% and 50% of initial light output, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Narendran, N.  |author2=Y. Gu|year= 2005|title=Life of LED-based white light sources|journal= IEEE/OSA Journal of Display Technology |volume=1|issue=1|pages= 167–171|doi=10.1109/JDT.2005.852510|bibcode = 2005JDisT...1..167N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas in most previous sources of light (incandescent lamps, discharge lamps, and those that burn combustible fuel, e.g. candles and oil lamps) the light results from heat, LEDs only operate if they are kept cool enough. The manufacturer commonly specifies a maximum junction temperature of 125 or 150&amp;nbsp;°C, and lower temperatures are advisable in the interests of long life. At these temperatures, relatively little heat is lost by radiation, which means that the light beam generated by an LED is cool.

The waste heat in a high-power LED (which as of 2015 can be less than half the power that it consumes) is conveyed by conduction through the substrate and package of the LED to a [[heat sink]], which gives up the heat to the ambient air by convection. Careful thermal design is, therefore, essential, taking into account the [[thermal resistance]]s of the LED’s package, the heat sink and the interface between the two. Medium-power LEDs are often designed to solder directly to a [[printed circuit board]] that contains a thermally conductive metal layer. (Often, it is a PCB with a white [[solder mask]] (white pcb) and a ~1mm thick [[aluminum]] backing.) High-power LEDs are packaged in large-area ceramic packages that attach to a metal [[heat sink]]—the interface being a material with high thermal conductivity ([[thermal grease]], [[phase-change material]], [[thermally conductive pad]], or [[thermal adhesive]]).

If an LED-based lamp is installed in an unventilated [[luminaire]], or a luminaire is located in an environment that does not have free air circulation, the LED is likely to overheat, resulting in reduced life or early catastrophic failure. Thermal design is often based on an [[ambient temperature]] of {{convert|25|C}}. LEDs used in outdoor applications, such as traffic signals or in-pavement signal lights, and in climates where the temperature within the light fixture becomes very high, could experience reduced output or even failure.&lt;ref name="RPI.edu"&gt;Conway, K.

However, they may be more susceptible to frost and snow buildup than incandescent lamps,&lt;ref name="RPI.edu" /&gt; so some LED lighting systems have been designed with an added heating circuit. Additionally, research has developed heat sink technologies that transfer heat produced within the junction to appropriate areas of the light fixture.&lt;ref&gt;Gu, Y., A. Baker, and N.

The first blue-violet LED using magnesium-doped gallium nitride was made at [[Stanford University]] in 1972 by Herb Maruska and Wally Rhines, doctoral students in materials science and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/geek-life/history/rcas-forgotten-work-on-the-blue-led "Nobel Shocker: RCA Had the First Blue LED in 1972"].

''The Oregonian''. October 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Maruska was on leave from [[RCA|RCA Laboratories]], where he collaborated with Jacques Pankove on related work. In 1971, the year after Maruska left for Stanford, his RCA colleagues Pankove and Ed Miller demonstrated the first blue electroluminescence from zinc-doped gallium nitride, though the subsequent device Pankove and Miller built, the first actual gallium nitride light-emitting diode, emitted green light.&lt;ref&gt;Schubert, E.

In the early 1970s, these devices were too dim for practical use, and research into gallium nitride devices slowed. In August 1989, Cree introduced the first commercially available blue LED based on the [[Direct and indirect band gaps|indirect bandgap]] semiconductor, silicon carbide (SiC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cree.com/about/milestones.asp Major Business and Product Milestones].

Building upon this foundation, Theodore Moustakas at Boston University patented a method for producing high-brightness blue LEDs using a new two-step process.&lt;ref&gt;Moustakas, Theodore D. {{US patent|5686738A}} "Highly insulating monocrystalline gallium nitride thin films " Issue date: Mar 18, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;  Two years later, in 1993, high-brightness blue LEDs were demonstrated again by [[Shuji Nakamura]] of [[Nichia Corporation]] using a gallium nitride growth process similar to Moustakas's.&lt;ref&gt;Iwasa, Naruhito; Mukai, Takashi and Nakamura, Shuji {{US patent|5578839}} "Light-emitting gallium nitride-based compound semiconductor device" Issue date: November 26, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Moustakas and Nakamura were issued separate patents, which confused the issue of who was the original inventor (partly because although Moustakas invented his first, Nakamura filed first).{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  This new development revolutionized LED lighting, making high-power blue light sources practical, leading to the development of technologies like [[Blu-ray]], as well as allowing the bright high-resolution screens of modern tablets and phones.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Nakamura was awarded the 2006 [[Millennium Technology Prize]] for his invention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ia.ucsb.edu/pa/display.aspx?pkey=1475 2006 Millennium technology prize awarded to UCSB's Shuji Nakamura]. Ia.ucsb.edu (June 15, 2006). Retrieved on March 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1990s, blue LEDs became widely available. They have an active region consisting of one or more InGaN [[quantum well]]s sandwiched between thicker layers of GaN, called cladding layers. By varying the relative In/Ga fraction in the InGaN quantum wells, the light emission can in theory be varied from violet to amber. [[Aluminium gallium nitride]] (AlGaN) of varying Al/Ga fraction can be used to manufacture the cladding and quantum well layers for ultraviolet LEDs, but these devices have not yet reached the level of efficiency and technological maturity of InGaN/GaN blue/green devices. If un-alloyed GaN is used in this case to form the active quantum well layers, the device emits near-ultraviolet light with a peak wavelength centred around 365&amp;nbsp;nm. Green LEDs manufactured from the InGaN/GaN system are far more efficient and brighter than green LEDs produced with non-nitride material systems, but practical devices still exhibit efficiency too low for high-brightness applications.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

With nitrides containing aluminium, most often [[Aluminium gallium nitride|AlGaN]] and [[aluminium gallium indium nitride|AlGaInN]], even shorter wavelengths are achievable. Ultraviolet LEDs in a range of wavelengths are becoming available on the market. Near-UV emitters at wavelengths around 375–395&amp;nbsp;nm are already cheap and often encountered, for example, as [[black light]] lamp replacements for inspection of anti-[[counterfeiting]] UV watermarks in some documents and paper currencies. Shorter-wavelength diodes, while substantially more expensive, are commercially available for wavelengths down to 240&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.semiconductor-today.com/features/SemiconductorToday%20-%20Going%20deep%20for%20UV%20sterilization%20LEDs.pdf |journal=Semiconductor Today |title=Going Deep for UV Sterilization LEDs |page=82 |volume=5 |issue=3 |author=Cooke, Mike |date=April–May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515030549/http://www.semiconductor-today.com/features/SemiconductorToday%20-%20Going%20deep%20for%20UV%20sterilization%20LEDs.pdf |archivedate=May 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the photosensitivity of microorganisms approximately matches the absorption spectrum of [[DNA]], with a peak at about 260&amp;nbsp;nm, UV LED emitting at 250–270&amp;nbsp;nm are expected in prospective disinfection and sterilization devices.

Unlike dedicated-color LEDs, however, these obviously do not produce pure wavelengths. Moreover, such modules as commercially available are often not optimized for smooth color mixing.

===White===
There are two primary ways of producing [[white]] light-emitting diodes (WLEDs), LEDs that generate high-intensity white light. One is to use individual LEDs that emit three [[primary color]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2000 |title=The derivation of XYZ tristimulus spaces: A comparison of two alternative methods |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1520-6378%282001%2926%3A1%2B%3C%3A%3AAID-COL47%3E3.0.CO%3B2-4|author1=Wold, J. H. |author2=Valberg, A. |journal=Color Research &amp; Application |volume=26 |issue=S1 |pages=S222|doi=10.1002/1520-6378(2001)26:1+&lt;::AID-COL47&gt;3.0.CO;2-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—red, green, and blue—and then mix all the colors to form white light. The other is to use a phosphor material to convert monochromatic light from a blue or UV LED to broad-spectrum white light, much in the same way a fluorescent light bulb works. The 'whiteness' of the light produced is essentially engineered to suit the human eye. The yellow phosphor in LEDs is [[cerium]]-doped [[YAG]] crystal, in powder form and may be suspended in plastic, epoxy, synthetic rubber or silicone. Touching 
bare LEDs using synthetic rubber or silicone can damage the delicate wire bonds from LED to package or the LED itself, so they may be protected by a plastic or glass cover, such as in the LED flash in smartphones. It is this YAG phosphor which causes white LEDs without diffusers (such as those used in LED lamps and bulbs) to look yellow when off.

There are three main methods of mixing colors to produce white light from an LED:
* blue LED + green LED + red LED (color mixing; can be used as backlighting for displays, extremely poor for illumination due to gaps in spectrum)
* near-UV or UV LED + RGB phosphor (an LED producing light with a wavelength shorter than blue's is used to excite an RGB phosphor, a mixture of red, green, and blue phosphor)
* blue LED + yellow phosphor (two complementary colors combine to form white light; more efficient than the first two methods and more commonly used)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/ecj.10394|year = 2012|title=Latest trends in LED lighting|author1=Bessho, M |author2=Shimizu, K |journal=Electronics and Communications in Japan|volume=95|issue=1|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of [[Metamerism (color)|metamerism]], it is possible to have quite different spectra that appear white. However, the appearance of objects illuminated by that light may vary as the spectrum varies; this is the issue of color rendition, quite separate from color temperature, where a really orange or cyan object could appear with the wrong color and much darker as the LED or phosphor does not emit the wavelength it reflects. The best color rendition CFL and LEDs use a mix of phosphors, resulting in less efficiency but better quality of light. Though [[incandescent]] [[halogen lamp]]s have a more orange color temperature, they are still the best easily available artificial light sources in terms of color rendition.

====RGB systems====

[[File:RGB LED.jpg|thumb|RGB LED]]

White light can be formed by mixing differently colored lights; the most common method is to use red, green, and blue (RGB). Hence the method is called multicolor white LEDs (sometimes referred to as RGB LEDs). Because these need electronic circuits to control the blending and [[diffusion]] of different colors, and because the individual color LEDs typically have slightly different emission patterns (leading to variation of the color depending on direction) even if they are made as a single unit, these are seldom used to produce white lighting. Nonetheless, this method has many applications because of the flexibility of mixing different colors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in principle, this mechanism also has higher quantum efficiency in producing white light.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

There are several types of multicolor white LEDs: [[:wiktionary:dichromatic|di-]], [[trichromatic|tri-]], and [[tetrachromatic]] white LEDs. Several key factors that play among these different methods include color stability, [[color rendering index|color rendering]] capability, and luminous efficacy. Often, higher efficiency means lower color rendering, presenting a trade-off between the luminous efficacy and color rendering. For example, the dichromatic white LEDs have the best luminous efficacy (120 lm/W), but the lowest color rendering capability. However, although tetrachromatic white LEDs have excellent color rendering capability, they often have poor luminous efficacy. Trichromatic white LEDs are in between, having both good luminous efficacy (&gt;70 lm/W) and fair color rendering capability.

One of the challenges is the development of more efficient green LEDs. The theoretical maximum for green LEDs is 683 lumens per watt but as of 2010 few green LEDs exceed even 100 lumens per watt. The blue and red LEDs approach their theoretical limits.

Multicolor LEDs offer not merely another means to form white light but a new means to form light of different colors. Most [[color#Perception|perceivable colors]] can be formed by mixing different amounts of three primary colors. This allows precise dynamic color control. As more effort is devoted to investigating this method, multicolor LEDs should have profound influence on the fundamental method that we use to produce and control light color. However, before this type of LED can play a role on the market, several technical problems must be solved. These include that this type of LED's emission power [[exponential decay|decays exponentially]] with rising temperature,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Schubert |first1=E. Fred |last2=Kim |first2=Jong Kyu |journal=Science |volume=308 |issue=5726 |doi=10.1126/science.1108712 |pmid=15919985 |pages=1274–1278 |year=2005 |title=Solid-State Light Sources Getting Smart |bibcode=2005Sci...308.1274S |url=http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/~schubert/Reprints/2005%20Schubert%20and%20Kim%20%28Science%29%20Solid-state%20light%20sources%20getting%20smart.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
resulting in a substantial change in color stability. Such problems inhibit and may preclude industrial use. Thus, many new package designs aimed at solving this problem have been proposed and their results are now being reproduced by researchers and scientists. However multicolor LEDs without phosphors can never provide good quality lighting because each LED is a narrow band source (see graph). LEDs without phosphor while a poorer solution for general lighting are the best solution for displays, either backlight of LCD, or direct LED based pixels.

[[Correlated color temperature]] (CCT) dimming for LED technology is regarded as a difficult task since LED binning,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ledcorporations.com/led-binning/|title=What Exactly IS LED Binning? |date=2013-10-22|work=LED Corporations|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; age and temperature drift effects of LEDs change the actual color value output. Feedback loop systems are used for example with color sensors, to actively monitor and control the color output of multiple color mixing LEDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

====Phosphor-based LEDs====
[[File:White LED.png|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Spectrum of a white LED showing blue light directly emitted by the GaN-based LED (peak at about 465 nm) and the more broadband [[Stokes shift|Stokes-shifted]] light emitted by the Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;:YAG phosphor, which emits at roughly 500–700 nm]]

This method involves [[coating]] LEDs of one color (mostly blue LEDs made of [[InGaN]]) with [[phosphor]]s of different colors to form white light; the resultant LEDs are called phosphor-based or phosphor-converted white LEDs (pcLEDs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Depending on the original LED's color, various color phosphors are used.  Using several phosphor layers of distinct colors broadens the emitted spectrum, effectively raising the [[Color Rendering Index|color rendering index]] (CRI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Phosphor-based LEDs have efficiency losses due to heat loss from the [[Stokes shift]] and also other phosphor-related issues. Their luminous efficacies compared to normal LEDs depend on the spectral distribution of the resultant light output and the original wavelength of the LED itself. For example, the luminous efficacy of a typical YAG yellow phosphor based white LED ranges from 3 to 5 times the luminous efficacy of the original blue LED because of the human eye's greater sensitivity to yellow than to blue (as modeled in the [[luminosity function]]). Due to the simplicity of manufacturing, the phosphor method is still the most popular method for making high-intensity white LEDs. The design and production of a light source or light fixture using a monochrome emitter with phosphor conversion is simpler and cheaper than a complex [[#RGB systems|RGB]] system, and the majority of high-intensity white LEDs presently on the market are manufactured using phosphor light conversion.

Among the challenges being faced to improve the efficiency of LED-based white light sources is the development of more efficient phosphors. As of 2010, the most efficient yellow phosphor is still the YAG phosphor, with less than 10% Stokes shift loss. Losses attributable to internal optical losses due to re-absorption in the LED chip and in the LED packaging itself account typically for another 10% to 30% of efficiency loss. Currently, in the area of phosphor LED development, much effort is being spent on optimizing these devices to higher light output and higher operation temperatures. For instance, the efficiency can be raised by adapting better package design or by using a more suitable type of phosphor. Conformal coating process is frequently used to address the issue of varying phosphor thickness.

Some phosphor-based white LEDs encapsulate InGaN blue LEDs inside phosphor-coated epoxy. Alternatively, the LED might be paired with a remote phosphor, a preformed polycarbonate piece coated with the phosphor material. Remote phosphors provide more diffuse light, which is desirable for many applications. Remote phosphor designs are also more tolerant of variations in the LED emissions spectrum. A common yellow phosphor material is [[cerium]]-[[Doping (Semiconductors)|doped]] [[yttrium aluminium garnet]] (Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;:YAG).

White LEDs can also be made by [[coating]] near-[[ultraviolet]] (NUV) LEDs with a mixture of high-efficiency [[europium]]-based phosphors that emit red and blue, plus copper and aluminium-doped zinc sulfide (ZnS:Cu, Al) that emits green. This is a method analogous to the way [[fluorescent lamp]]s work. This method is less efficient than blue LEDs with YAG:Ce phosphor, as the Stokes shift is larger, so more energy is converted to heat, but yields light with better spectral characteristics, which render color better. Due to the higher radiative output of the ultraviolet LEDs than of the blue ones, both methods offer comparable brightness. A concern is that UV light may leak from a malfunctioning light source and cause harm to human eyes or skin.

====Other white LEDs====
Another method used to produce experimental white light LEDs used no phosphors at all and was based on [[epitaxy|homoepitaxially]] grown [[zinc selenide]] (ZnSe) on a ZnSe substrate that simultaneously emitted blue light from its active region and yellow light from the substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Joint venture to make ZnSe white LEDs

A new style of wafers composed of gallium-nitride-on-silicon (GaN-on-Si) is being used to produce white LEDs using 200-mm silicon wafers. This avoids the typical costly [[sapphire]] [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] in relatively small 100- or 150-mm wafer sizes.&lt;ref name="electronicdesign.com"&gt;[http://electronicdesign.com/europe-news/next-generation-gan-si-white-leds-suppress-costs Next-Generation GaN-on-Si White LEDs Suppress Costs], Electronic Design, 19 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The sapphire apparatus must be coupled with a mirror-like collector to reflect light that would otherwise be wasted. It is predicted that by 2020, 40% of all GaN LEDs will be made with GaN-on-Si. Manufacturing large sapphire material is difficult, while large silicon material is cheaper and more abundant. LED companies shifting from using sapphire to silicon should be a minimal investment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isuppli.com/Semiconductor-Value-Chain/News/Pages/GaN-on-Silicon-LEDs-Forecast-to-Increase-Market-Share-to-40Percent-by-2020.aspx GaN-on-Silicon LEDs Forecast to Increase Market Share to 40 Percent by 2020], iSuppli, 4 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Organic light-emitting diode}}

In an organic light-emitting diode ([[Organic light-emitting diode|OLED]]), the [[Electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] material composing the emissive layer of the diode is an [[organic compound]]. The organic material is electrically conductive due to the [[Delocalized electron|delocalization]] of [[Pi bond|pi electrons]] caused by [[Conjugated system|conjugation]] over all or part of the molecule, and the material therefore functions as an [[organic semiconductor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Burroughes | first1 = J.

===Quantum-dot LEDs===
{{see also|quantum dot display}}
[[Quantum dot]]s (QD) are semiconductor [[nanocrystal]]s with optical properties that let their emission color be tuned from the visible into the infrared spectrum.&lt;ref name=MITqdot2002&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2002/dot.html Quantum-dot LED may be screen of choice for future electronics] [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] News Office, December 18, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=H. |last1=Neidhardt |first2=L. |last2=Wilhelm |first3=V.

This provides more color options and better color rendering than white LEDs since the emission spectrum is much narrower, characteristic of quantum confined states.

There are two types of schemes for QD excitation. One uses photo excitation with a primary light source LED (typically blue or UV LEDs are used). The other is direct electrical excitation first demonstrated by Alivisatos et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Colvin | first1 = V. L. | last2 = Schlamp | first2 = M.

One example of the photo-excitation scheme is a method developed by Michael Bowers, at [[Vanderbilt University]] in Nashville, involving coating a blue LED with quantum dots that glow white in response to the blue light from the LED. This method emits a warm, yellowish-white light similar to that made by [[incandescent light bulb]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Accidental Invention Points to End of Light Bulbs|publisher =LiveScience.com|date = October 21, 2005|url = http://www.livescience.com/technology/051021_nano_light.html|accessdate = January 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quantum dots are also being considered for use in white light-emitting diodes in liquid crystal display (LCD) televisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanocogroup.com/content/Library/NewsandEvents/articles/Nanoco_Signs_Agreement_with_Major_Japanese_Electronics_Company/136.aspx Nanoco Signs Agreement with Major Japanese Electronics Company], nanocogroup.com (September 23, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011 scientists at PlasmaChem GmbH were able to synthesize quantum dots for LED applications and build a light converter on their basis, which was able to efficiently convert light from blue to any other color for many hundred hours.&lt;ref&gt;Nanotechnologie Aktuell, pp. 98–99, v. 4, 2011, {{ISSN|1866-4997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such QDs can be used to emit visible or near infrared light of any wavelength being excited by light with a shorter wavelength.

The structure of QD-LEDs used for the electrical-excitation scheme is similar to basic design of [[OLED]]s. A layer of quantum dots is sandwiched between layers of electron-transporting and hole-transporting materials. An applied electric field causes electrons and holes to move into the quantum dot layer and recombine forming an [[exciton]] that excites a QD. This scheme is commonly studied for [[quantum dot display]]. The tunability of emission wavelengths and narrow bandwidth is also beneficial as excitation sources for fluorescence imaging. Fluorescence near-field scanning optical microscopy
([[NSOM]]) utilizing an integrated QD-LED has been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hoshino | first1 = K. | last2 = Gopal | first2 = A. | last3 = Glaz | first3 = M.

==Types==
[[File:Verschiedene LEDs.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3.4|LEDs are produced in a variety of shapes and sizes. The color of the plastic lens is often the same as the actual color of light emitted, but not always. For instance, purple plastic is often used for [[infrared]] LEDs, and most blue devices have colorless housings. Modern high-power LEDs such as those used for lighting and backlighting are generally found in [[surface-mount technology]] (SMT) packages (not shown).]]

The main types of LEDs are miniature, high-power devices, and custom designs such as alphanumeric or multicolor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flexfireleds.com/pages/Comparison-between-3528-LEDs-and-5050-LEDs.html What is the difference between 3528 LEDs and 5050 LEDs |SMD 5050 SMD 3528].

These are mostly single-die LEDs used as indicators, and they come in various sizes from 2&amp;nbsp;mm to 8&amp;nbsp;mm, [[through-hole]] and [[surface mount]] packages. They usually do not use a separate [[heat sink]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elektor.com/magazines/2008/february/power-to-the-leds.350167.lynkx LED-design]. Elektor.com.

The small size sets a natural upper boundary on power consumption due to heat caused by the high current density and need for a heat sink.

Common package shapes include round, with a domed or flat top, rectangular with a flat top (as used in bar-graph displays), and triangular or square with a flat top.
The encapsulation may also be clear or tinted to improve contrast and viewing angle.

Researchers at the [[University of Washington]] have invented the thinnest LED. It is made of [[Two-dimensional space|two-dimensional (2-D)]] flexible materials. It is three [[atom]]s thick, which is 10 to 20 times thinner than [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional (3-D)]] LEDs and is also 10,000 times smaller than the thickness of a human hair. These 2-D LEDs are going to make it possible to create smaller, more energy-efficient lighting, [[optical communication]] and [[nano lasers]].&lt;ref&gt;Ma, Michelle (10 March 2014) [http://www.washington.edu/news/2014/03/10/scientists-build-thinnest-possible-leds-to-be-stronger-more-energy-efficient/ Researchers build thinnest-known LED], UW Today&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Electrically tunable excitonic light-emitting diodes based on monolayer WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; p–n junctions|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|volume=9|issue=4|pages=268–72|pmid=24608230|doi=10.1038/nnano.2014.26|arxiv=1312.1435|year=2014|last1=Ross|first1=J.

There are three main categories of miniature single die LEDs:
; Low-current
: Typically rated for 2&amp;nbsp;mA at around 2&amp;nbsp;V (approximately 4&amp;nbsp;mW consumption)
; Standard
: 20&amp;nbsp;mA LEDs (ranging from approximately 40&amp;nbsp;mW to 90&amp;nbsp;mW) at around:
:* 1.9 to 2.1&amp;nbsp;V for red, orange, yellow, and traditional green
:* 3.0 to 3.4&amp;nbsp;V for pure green and blue
:* 2.9 to 4.2&amp;nbsp;V for violet, pink, purple and white
; Ultra-high-output
: 20&amp;nbsp;mA at approximately 2 or 4–5&amp;nbsp;V, designed for viewing in direct sunlight

5&amp;nbsp;V and 12&amp;nbsp;V LEDs are ordinary miniature LEDs that incorporate a suitable [[Series and parallel circuits#Resistors|series]] [[resistor]] for direct connection to a 5 V or 12 V supply.

===High-power===
[[File:2007-07-24 High-power light emitting diodes (Luxeon, Lumiled).jpg|thumb|High-power light-emitting diodes attached to an LED star base ([[Luxeon]], [[Philips Lumileds Lighting Company|Lumileds]])]]
{{See also|Solid-state lighting|LED lamp|Thermal management of high-power LEDs}}

High-power LEDs (HP-LEDs) or high-output LEDs (HO-LEDs) can be driven at currents from hundreds of mA to more than an ampere, compared with the tens of mA for other LEDs. Some can emit over a thousand lumens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luminus.com/content1044|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725033952/http://www.luminus.com/content1044 |archivedate=2008-07-25|title=Luminus Products |publisher=Luminus Devices |accessdate=October 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luminus.com/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/7c8547b3575bcecc577525b80d210ac7/misc/pds_001314_rev_03__cst_90_w_product_datasheet_illumination.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331100545/http://www.luminus.com/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/7c8547b3575bcecc577525b80d210ac7/misc/pds_001314_rev_03__cst_90_w_product_datasheet_illumination.pdf |archivedate=2010-03-31|title=Luminus Products CST-90 Series Datasheet |publisher=Luminus Devices |accessdate=October 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; LED [[Power density|power densities]] up to 300 W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; have been achieved. Since overheating is destructive, the HP-LEDs must be mounted on a heat sink to allow for heat dissipation. If the heat from an HP-LED is not removed, the device fails in seconds. One HP-LED can often replace an incandescent bulb in a [[flashlight]], or be set in an array to form a powerful [[LED lamp]].

Some well-known HP-LEDs in this category are the Nichia 19 series, Lumileds Rebel Led, Osram Opto Semiconductors Golden Dragon, and Cree X-lamp. As of September 2009, some HP-LEDs manufactured by Cree now exceed 105&amp;nbsp;lm/W.&lt;ref name="Xlamp Xp-G Led"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cree.com/products/xlamp_xpg.asp |title=Xlamp Xp-G Led |website=Cree.com |publisher=[[Cree, Inc.]] |accessdate=March 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313082324/http://www.cree.com/products/xlamp_xpg.asp |archivedate=March 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples for [[Haitz's law]]—which predicts an exponential rise in light output and efficacy of LEDs over time—are the CREE XP-G series LED, which achieved 105 lm/W in 2009&lt;ref name="Xlamp Xp-G Led" /&gt; and the Nichia 19 series with a typical efficacy of 140 lm/W, released in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nichia.co.jp/en/about_nichia/2010/2010_110201.html High Power Point Source White Led NVSx219A]. Nichia.co.jp, November 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===AC-driven===
LEDs developed by Seoul Semiconductor can operate on AC power without a DC converter. For each half-cycle, part of the LED emits light and part is dark, and this is reversed during the next half-cycle. The efficacy of this type of HP-LED is typically 40 lm/W.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ledsmagazine.com/news/3/11/14|title=Seoul Semiconductor launches AC LED lighting source Acrich |publisher=LEDS Magazine |accessdate=February 17, 2008|date=November 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of LED elements in series may be able to operate directly from line voltage. In 2009, Seoul Semiconductor released a high DC voltage LED, named as 'Acrich MJT', capable of being driven from AC power with a simple controlling circuit. The low-power dissipation of these LEDs affords them more flexibility than the original AC LED design.&lt;ref name="IDA" /&gt;

===Application-specific variations===

====Flashing====
Flashing LEDs are used as attention seeking indicators without requiring external electronics. Flashing LEDs resemble standard LEDs but they contain an integrated [[multivibrator]] circuit that causes the LED to flash with a typical period of one second. In diffused lens LEDs, this circuit is visible as a small black dot. Most flashing LEDs emit light of one color, but more sophisticated devices can flash between multiple colors and even fade through a color sequence using RGB color mixing.

====Bi-color====
Bi-color LEDs contain two different LED emitters in one case. There are two types of these. One type consists of two dies connected to the same two leads [[Antiparallel (electronics)|antiparallel]] to each other. Current flow in one direction emits one color, and current in the opposite direction emits the other color. The other type consists of two dies with separate leads for both dies and another lead for common anode or cathode so that they can be controlled independently.  The most common bi-color combination is red/traditional green, however, other available combinations include amber/traditional green, red/pure green, red/blue, and blue/pure green.

====Tri-color====
Tri-color LEDs contain three different LED emitters in one case. Each emitter is connected to a separate lead so they can be controlled independently. A four-lead arrangement is typical with one common lead (anode or cathode) and an additional lead for each color.

====RGB====
RGB LEDs are tri-color LEDs with red, green, and blue emitters, in general using a four-wire connection with one common lead (anode or cathode). Others, however, have only two leads (positive and negative) and have a built-in [[electronic control unit]].

====Decorative-multicolor====
Decorative-multicolor LEDs incorporate several emitters of different colors supplied by only two lead-out wires. Colors are switched internally by varying the supply voltage.

====Alphanumeric====
[[File:Macro photo of LED matrix.jpg|thumb|Composite image of a 11x44 LED matrix lapel [[name tag]] display using 1608/0603-type SMD LEDs. Top: A little over half of the 21x86 mm display. Center: Close-up of LEDs in ambient light. Bottom: LEDs in their own red light.]]
Alphanumeric LEDs are available in [[seven-segment display|seven-segment]], [[Starburst display|starburst]], and [[Dot-matrix display|dot-matrix]] format. Seven-segment displays handle all numbers and a limited set of letters. Starburst displays can display all letters. Dot-matrix displays typically use 5x7 pixels per character. Seven-segment LED displays were in widespread use in the 1970s and 1980s, but rising use of [[liquid crystal display]]s, with their lower power needs and greater display flexibility, has reduced the popularity of numeric and alphanumeric LED displays.

====Digital-RGB====
Digital RGB Addressable LEDs are RGB LEDs that contain their own "smart" control electronics. In addition to power and ground, these provide connections for data-in, data-out, and sometimes a clock or strobe signal. These are connected in a [[Daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]], with the data in of the first LED sourced by a microprocessor, which can control the brightness and color of each LED independently of the others. They are used where a combination of maximum control and minimum visible electronics are needed such as strings for Christmas and LED matrices. Some even have refresh rates in the kHz range, allowing for basic video applications. These devices are also known by their part number (WS2812 being the most common) or a brand name such as [[Adafruit Industries#NeoPixel|NeoPixel]]

====Filament====
An [[LED filament]] consists of multiple LED chips connected in series on a common longitudinal substrate that forms a thin rod reminiscent of a traditional incandescent filament.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|accessdate=October 26, 2015}}
&lt;/ref&gt; These are being used as a low-cost decorative alternative for traditional light bulbs that are being phased out in many countries. The filaments require a rather high voltage to light to nominal brightness, allowing them to work efficiently and simply with mains voltages. Often a simple rectifier and capacitive current limiting are employed to create a low-cost replacement for a traditional light bulb without the complexity of the low voltage, high current converter that single die LEDs need.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|title=LED Filaments
|accessdate=October 26, 2015}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, they are packaged in a sealed enclosure with a shape similar to lamps they were designed to replace (e.g. a bulb) and filled with inert nitrogen or carbon dioxide gas to remove heat efficiently.

==Considerations for use==

===Power sources===
{{Main|LED power sources}}
[[File:LED circuit.svg|thumb|upright|Simple LED circuit with resistor for current limiting]]

The current–voltage characteristic of an LED is similar to other diodes, in that the current is dependent exponentially on the voltage (see [[Shockley diode equation]]). This means that a small change in voltage can cause a large change in current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Elektrotechnik Gesamtband Technische Mathematik Kommunikationselektronik|date=1997|publisher=Westermann|isbn=978-3142212517|page=171|edition=1st|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the applied voltage exceeds the LED's forward voltage drop by a small amount, the current rating may be exceeded by a large amount, potentially damaging or destroying the LED. The typical solution is to use [[Constant current|constant-current]] power supplies to keep the current below the LED's maximum current rating. Since most common power sources (batteries, mains) are constant-voltage sources, most LED fixtures must include a power converter, at least a current-limiting resistor.
However, the high resistance of three-volt [[Button cell|coin cells]] combined with the high differential resistance of nitride-based LEDs makes it possible to power such an LED from such a coin cell without an external resistor.

===Electrical polarity===
{{Main|Electrical polarity of LEDs}}

As with all diodes, current flows easily from p-type to n-type material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Schubert, E. Fred |title=Light-Emitting Diodes|publisher= Cambridge University Press|year= 2005|chapter =Chapter 4|isbn=978-0-8194-3956-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, no current flows and no light is emitted if a small voltage is applied in the reverse direction. If the reverse voltage grows large enough to exceed the [[breakdown voltage]], a large current flows and the LED may be damaged. If the reverse current is sufficiently limited to avoid damage, the reverse-conducting LED is a useful [[Hardware random number generator#Physical phenomena without quantum-random properties|noise diode]].

===Safety and health===
The vast majority of devices containing LEDs are "safe under all conditions of normal use", and so are classified as "Class 1 LED product"/"LED Klasse 1". At present, only a few LEDs—extremely bright LEDs that also have a tightly focused viewing angle of 8° or less—could, in theory, cause temporary blindness, and so are classified as "Class 2".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120125033254/http://www.datasheetarchive.com/datasheet-pdf/054/DSA0017490.html "Visible LED Device Classifications"]. Datasheetarchive.com. Retrieved on January 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
The opinion of the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health &amp; Safety (ANSES) of 2010, on the health issues concerning LEDs, suggested banning public use of lamps in the moderate Risk Group 2, especially those with a high blue component, in places frequented by children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anses.fr/Documents/AP2008sa0408EN.pdf Opinion of the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health &amp; Safety], ANSES Opinion, October 19, 2010. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429161553/http://www.anses.fr/Documents/AP2008sa0408EN.pdf |date=April 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.anses.fr/en/content/led-%E2%80%93-light-emitting-diodes Opinion of the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health &amp; Safety], ANSES Opinion update, September 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, [[laser safety]] regulations—and the "Class 1", "Class 2", etc. system—also apply to LEDs.&lt;ref&gt;

While LEDs have the advantage over [[fluorescent lamp]]s that they do not contain [[mercury (element)|mercury]], they may contain other hazardous metals such as [[lead]] and [[arsenic]]. Regarding the toxicity of LEDs when treated as waste, a study published in 2011 stated: "According to federal standards, LEDs are not hazardous except for low-intensity red LEDs, which leached Pb [lead] at levels exceeding regulatory limits (186 mg/L; regulatory limit: 5). However, according to California regulations, excessive levels of copper (up to 3892 mg/kg; limit: 2500), lead (up to 8103 mg/kg; limit: 1000), [[nickel]] (up to 4797 mg/kg; limit: 2000), or [[silver]] (up to 721 mg/kg; limit: 500) render all except low-intensity yellow LEDs hazardous."&lt;ref name=Limetal2011&gt;{{Cite journal

In 2016 a statement of the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) concerning the possible influence of blueish [[street light]]ing on the [[sleep-wake cycle]] of city-dwellers led to some controversy.
So far [[High-pressure sodium|high-pressure sodium lamp]]s (HPS) with an orange light spectrum were the most efficient light sources commonly used in street-lighting.
Now many modern street lamps are equipped with [[Indium gallium nitride#LEDs|Indium gallium nitride LEDs]] (InGaN). These are even more efficient and mostly emit blue-rich light with a higher ''correlated [[color temperature]] (CCT)''. Since light with a high CCT resembles daylight it is thought that this might have an effect on the normal [[circadian rhythm|circadian physiology]] by suppressing [[melatonin]] production in the human body. There have been no relevant studies as yet and critics claim exposure levels are not high enough to have a noticeable effect.&lt;ref&gt;The reactions to the recommendations of the [[American Medical Association]] are cited in an [http://www.lightnowblog.com/2016/07/ama-issues-led-streetlighting-guidance-controversy-ensues/ article] on LightNowBlog.com. The comments note that the AMA slogan "cool it and dim it" leads to some confusion, since this refers to lighting with ''cooler'' color temperatures, which is commonly perceived as having a ''warmer'' color.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===
* '''Efficiency:''' LEDs emit more lumens per watt than incandescent light bulbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/ssl/comparing.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505080533/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/ssl/comparing.html |archivedate=2009-05-05|title=Solid-State Lighting: Comparing LEDs to Traditional Light Sources|website=eere.energy.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efficiency of LED lighting fixtures is not affected by shape and size, unlike fluorescent light bulbs or tubes.
* '''Color:''' LEDs can emit light of an intended color without using any color filters as traditional lighting methods need. This is more efficient and can lower initial costs.
* '''Size:''' LEDs can be very small (smaller than 2&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dialight.com/Assets/Brochures_And_Catalogs/Indication/MDEI5980603.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205040334/http://www.dialight.com/Assets/Brochures_And_Catalogs/Indication/MDEI5980603.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-05|format=PDF|title=Dialight Micro LED SMD LED "598 SERIES" Datasheet|website=Dialight.com}}
&lt;/ref&gt;) and are easily attached to printed circuit boards.
* '''Warmup time:''' LEDs light up very quickly. A typical red indicator LED achieves full brightness in under a [[microsecond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avagotech.com/docs/AV02-1555EN|title=Data Sheet&amp;nbsp;— HLMP-1301, T-1 (3 mm) Diffused LED Lamps |publisher=Avago Technologies |accessdate=May 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; LEDs used in communications devices can have even faster response times.
* '''Cycling:''' LEDs are ideal for uses subject to frequent on-off cycling, unlike incandescent and fluorescent lamps that fail faster when cycled often, or [[high-intensity discharge lamp]]s (HID lamps) that require a long time before restarting.
* '''Dimming:''' LEDs can very easily be [[Dimmer|dimmed]] either by [[pulse-width modulation]] or lowering the forward current.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Narra |first1=Prathyusha |last2=Zinger |first2=D.S. |journal=Industry Applications Conference, 2004. 39th IAS Annual Meeting. Conference Record of the 2004 IEEE|title=An effective LED dimming approach |year=2004|volume=3 |pages= 1671–1676 |doi=10.1109/IAS.2004.1348695 |isbn=978-0-7803-8486-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This pulse-width modulation is why LED lights, particularly headlights on cars,  when viewed on camera or by some people, seem to flash or flicker. This is a type of [[stroboscopic effect]].
* '''Cool light:''' In contrast to most light sources, LEDs radiate very little heat in the form of [[Infrared|IR]] that can cause damage to sensitive objects or fabrics. Wasted energy is dispersed as heat through the base of the LED.
* '''Slow failure:''' LEDs mainly fail by dimming over time, rather than the abrupt failure of incandescent bulbs.&lt;ref name=eere/&gt;
* '''Lifetime:''' LEDs can have a relatively long useful life. One report estimates 35,000 to 50,000 hours of useful life, though time to complete failure may be shorter or longer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/publications/pdfs/ssl/lifetime_white_leds_aug16_r1.pdf Lifetime of White LEDs]. US Department of Energy. (PDF) . Retrieved on March 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Fluorescent tubes typically are rated at about 10,000 to 25,000 hours, depending partly on the conditions of use, and incandescent light bulbs at 1,000 to 2,000 hours. Several [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] demonstrations have shown that reduced maintenance costs from this extended lifetime, rather than energy savings, is the primary factor in determining the payback period for an LED product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.ltgovernors.com/in-depth-advantages-of-led-lighting.html|title=In depth: Advantages of LED Lighting|website=energy.ltgovernors.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Shock resistance:''' LEDs, being solid-state components, are difficult to damage with external shock, unlike fluorescent and incandescent bulbs, which are fragile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.larsonelectronics.com/a-5-led-light-bars-for-off-road-illumination.aspx|title=LED Light Bars For Off Road Illumination|last=|first=|date=|website=Larson Electronics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Focus:''' The solid package of the LED can be designed to [[focus (optics)|focus]] its light. Incandescent and fluorescent sources often require an external reflector to collect light and direct it in a usable manner. For larger LED packages [[total internal reflection]] (TIR) lenses are often used to the same effect. However, when large quantities of light are needed many light sources are usually deployed, which are difficult to focus or [[collimate]] towards the same target.

===Disadvantages===
* '''Initial price:''' LEDs are currently slightly more expensive (price per lumen) on an initial capital cost basis, than other lighting technologies. {{As of|2014|3}}, at least one manufacturer claims to have reached $1 per kilolumen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=March 25, 2014|title=Philips Lumileds|website=Philipslumileds.com|url=http://www.philipslumileds.com/uploads/news/id228/PR211.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The additional expense partially stems from the relatively low lumen output and the drive circuitry and power supplies needed.
* '''Temperature dependence:''' LED performance largely depends on the ambient temperature of the operating environment&amp;nbsp;– or thermal management properties. Overdriving an LED in high ambient temperatures may result in overheating the LED package, eventually leading to device failure. An adequate [[heat sink]] is needed to maintain long life. This is especially important in automotive, medical, and military uses where devices must operate over a wide range of temperatures, which require low failure rates. Toshiba has produced LEDs with an operating temperature range of −40 to 100&amp;nbsp;°C, which suits the LEDs for both indoor and outdoor use in applications such as lamps, ceiling lighting, street lights, and floodlights.&lt;ref name="electronicdesign.com" /&gt;
* '''Voltage sensitivity:''' LEDs must be supplied with a voltage above their [[P–n junction#Forward bias|threshold voltage]] and a current below their rating. Current and lifetime change greatly with a small change in applied voltage. They thus require a current-regulated supply (usually just a series resistor for indicator LEDs).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ledmuseum.org/ The Led Museum]. The Led Museum. Retrieved on March 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Color rendition:''' Most cool-[[#Other white LEDs|white LEDs]] have spectra that differ significantly from a [[black body]] radiator like the sun or an incandescent light. The spike at 460&amp;nbsp;nm and dip at 500&amp;nbsp;nm can make the color of objects [[color vision|appear differently]] under cool-white LED illumination than sunlight or incandescent sources, due to [[metamerism (color)|metamerism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.jimworthey.com/jimtalk2006feb.html|title = How White Light Works|author = Worthey, James A. |website = LRO Lighting Research Symposium, Light and Color|accessdate = October 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; red surfaces being rendered particularly poorly by typical phosphor-based cool-white LEDs. The same is true with green surfaces.
* '''Area light source:''' Single LEDs do not approximate a [[point source]] of light giving a spherical light distribution, but rather a [[Lambert's cosine law|lambertian]] distribution. So, LEDs are difficult to apply to uses needing a spherical light field; however, different fields of light can be manipulated by the application of different optics or "lenses". LEDs cannot provide divergence below a few degrees. In contrast, lasers can emit beams with divergences of 0.2 degrees or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Hecht, E. |title=Optics|edition=4|page=591|publisher=Addison Wesley|year= 2002|isbn=978-0-19-510818-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Electrical polarity]]:''' Unlike [[incandescent]] light bulbs, which illuminate regardless of the [[electrical polarity]], LEDs only light with correct electrical polarity.  To automatically match source polarity to LED devices, [[rectifier]]s can be used.

* '''[[Light pollution]]:''' Because [[#White light|white LEDs]], especially those with high [[color temperature]], emit much more short wavelength light than conventional outdoor light sources such as high-pressure [[sodium vapor lamp]]s, the increased blue and green sensitivity of [[scotopic vision]] means that white LEDs used in outdoor lighting cause substantially more [[sky glow]].&lt;ref name="IDA"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Visibility, Environmental, and Astronomical Issues Associated with Blue-Rich White Outdoor Lighting |publisher=International Dark-Sky Association |date=May 4, 2010 |url=http://www.darksky.org/assets/documents/Reports/IDA-Blue-Rich-Light-White-Paper.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116003035/http://darksky.org/assets/documents/Reports/IDA-Blue-Rich-Light-White-Paper.pdf |archivedate=January 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luginbuhl|first1=C.|title=The impact of light source spectral power distribution on sky glow|journal=Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer|date=2014|volume=139|pages=21–26|doi=10.1016/j.jqsrt.2013.12.004|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022407313004792|bibcode=2014JQSRT.139...21L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aubé|first1=M.|last2=Roby|first2=J.|last3=Kocifaj|first3=M.|title=Evaluating Potential Spectral Impacts of Various Artificial Lights on Melatonin Suppression, Photosynthesis, and Star Visibility|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=7|pages=e67798|date=2013|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0067798|pmid=23861808|pmc=3702543|bibcode=2013PLoSO...867798A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crawford|first1=Mark|title=LED light pollution: Can we save energy and save the night?|url=http://spie.org/newsroom/technical-articles/1015-led-light-pollution?highlight=x2408&amp;ArticleID=x115768|publisher=SPIE Newsroom|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flagstaff Dark Skies Coalition|title=Lamp Spectrum and Light Pollution|url=http://www.flagstaffdarkskies.org/for-wonks/lamp-spectrum-light-pollution/|website=Lamp Spectrum and Light Pollution|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Medical Association warned on the use of high blue content white LEDs in street lighting, due to their higher impact on human health and environment, compared to low blue content light sources (e.g. high-pressure sodium, PC amber LEDs, and low CCT LEDs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/2016/2016-06-14-community-guidance-street-lighting.page?|title=AMA Adopts Community Guidance to Reduce the Harmful Human and Environmental Effects of High Intensity Street Lighting|website=www.ama-assn.org|access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Thermal runaway and negative resistance:'''{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Some LEDs, notably large area diodes, have quite high reverse capacitance and it is possible to damage them if the dV/dT is too short due to destructive ringing oscillations with inadequate driver similar to a related effect in laser diodes. To some extent this can be mitigated by shunting the diode(s) with a resistor whose value can be calculated based on a very simple formula. Value can be quite high even up to 100K as the capacitance of a typical LED is in the 10-900pF range. Incidentally this effect is also used in some amateur radio optical receivers to help detect weak signals in the visible band, e.g. Phlatlight(tm) paired with a bandpass filtered reverse biased silicon photovoltaic module using instrumentation amplifiers. Some newer GaN and InGaN LEDs show negative resistance at low to moderate drive current and this can be problematic as it can result in unpredictable behavior and RF emission under certain drive methodologies.

==Applications==
LED uses fall into four major categories:

* Visual signals where light goes more or less directly from the source to the human eye, to convey a message or meaning
* [[Lighting|Illumination]] where light is reflected from objects to give visual response of these objects
* Measuring and interacting with processes involving no human vision&lt;ref&gt;[[European Photonics Industry Consortium]] (EPIC). This includes use in data communications over [[Optical fiber|fiber optics]] as well as "broadcast" data or signaling.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Narrow band light sensors where [[LEDs as light sensors|LEDs operate in a reverse-bias mode]] and respond to incident light, instead of emitting light&lt;ref&gt;

===Indicators and signs===
The [[energy conservation|low energy consumption]], low maintenance and small size of LEDs has led to uses as status indicators and displays on a variety of equipment and installations. Large-area [[LED display]]s are used as stadium displays, dynamic decorative displays, and [[dynamic message sign]]s on freeways. Thin, lightweight message displays are used at airports and railway stations, and as [[Destination sign|destination displays]] for trains, buses, trams, and ferries.

[[File:Red and green traffic signals, Stamford Road, Singapore - 20111210.jpg|thumb|upright|Red and green LED traffic signals]]

One-color light is well suited for [[traffic light]]s and signals, [[exit sign]]s, [[emergency vehicle lighting]], ships' navigation lights or [[lantern]]s (chromacity and luminance standards being set under the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972, Annex I and the CIE) and [[Christmas lighting technology#LEDs|LED-based Christmas lights]]. In cold climates, LED traffic lights may remain snow-covered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ledsmagazine.com/news/7/1/4 LED advantages outweigh potential snow hazards in traffic signals], LEDs magazine January 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Red or yellow LEDs are used in indicator and alphanumeric displays in environments where night vision must be retained: aircraft cockpits, submarine and ship bridges, astronomy observatories, and in the field, e.g. night time animal watching and military field use.

[[File:LEDClose6545.jpg|thumb|Automotive applications for LEDs continue to grow.]]

Because of their long life, fast switching times, and visibility in broad daylight due to their high output and focus, LEDs have been used in brake lights for cars' [[center high-mounted stop lamp|high-mounted brake lights]], trucks, and buses, and in turn signals for some time. However, many vehicles now use LEDs for their rear light clusters. The use in brakes improves safety, due to a great reduction in the time needed to light fully, or faster rise time, up to 0.5 second faster{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} than an incandescent bulb. This gives drivers behind more time to react. In a dual intensity circuit (rear markers and brakes) if the LEDs are not pulsed at a fast enough frequency, they can create a [[flicker fusion threshold#Visual phenomena|phantom array]], where ghost images of the LED appear if the eyes quickly scan across the array. White LED headlamps are beginning to appear. Using LEDs has styling advantages because LEDs can form much thinner lights than incandescent lamps with [[parabolic reflector]]s.

Due to the relative cheapness of low output LEDs, they are also used in many temporary uses such as [[glowstick]]s, [[throwies]], and the photonic [[textile]] [[Lumalive]]. Artists have also used LEDs for [[LED art]].

[[Weather radio|Weather]] and [[NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards|all-hazards]] radio receivers with [[Specific Area Message Encoding]] (SAME) have three LEDs: red for warnings, orange for watches, and yellow for advisories and statements whenever issued.

===Lighting===
With the development of high-efficiency and high-power LEDs, it has become possible to use LEDs in lighting and illumination. To encourage the shift to [[LED lamp]]s and other high-efficiency lighting, the [[US Department of Energy]] has created the [[L Prize]] competition. The [[Philips]] Lighting North America LED bulb won the first competition on August 3, 2011, after successfully completing 18 months of intensive field, lab, and product testing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightingprize.org/ "L-Prize U.S. Department of Energy"], L-Prize Website, August 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

LEDs are used as [[street light]]s and in other [[Architectural lighting design|architectural lighting]]. The mechanical robustness and long lifetime are used in [[automotive lighting]] on cars, motorcycles, and [[Bicycle lighting#LEDs|bicycle lights]]. LED light emission may be efficiently controlled by using [[nonimaging optics]] principles.

[[LED street light]]s are employed on poles and in parking garages. In 2007, the Italian village of [[Torraca]] was the first place to convert its entire illumination system to LEDs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=led-there-be-light LED There Be Light], Scientific American, March 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

LEDs are used in aviation lighting. [[Airbus]] has used LED lighting in its [[Airbus A320 Enhanced]] since 2007, and Boeing uses LED lighting in the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787]] and 737 Sky Interior. LEDs are also being used now in airport and heliport lighting. LED airport fixtures currently include medium-intensity runway lights, runway centerline lights, taxiway centerline and edge lights, guidance signs, and obstruction lighting.

LEDs are also used as a light source for [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]] projectors, and to [[backlight]] [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] televisions (referred to as [[LED-backlit LCD display|LED TVs]]) and [[laptop]] displays. RGB LEDs raise the color gamut by as much as 45%. Screens for TV and computer displays can be made thinner using LEDs for backlighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/24/business/yourmoney/24novel.html|publisher=New York Times|title=In Pursuit of Perfect TV Color, With L.E.D.’s and Lasers|date=June 24, 2007|first=Anne|last=Eisenberg|accessdate=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of IR or heat radiation makes LEDs ideal for [[stage light]]s using banks of RGB LEDs that can easily change color and decrease heating from traditional stage lighting, as well as medical lighting where IR-radiation can be harmful. In energy conservation, the lower heat output of LEDs also means air conditioning (cooling) systems have less heat in need of disposal.

LEDs are small, durable and need little power, so they are used in handheld devices such as [[flashlight]]s. LED [[strobe light]]s or [[camera flash]]es operate at a safe, low voltage, instead of the 250+ volts commonly found in [[xenon]] flashlamp-based lighting. This is especially useful in cameras on [[mobile phone]]s, where space is at a premium and bulky voltage-raising circuitry is undesirable.

LEDs are used for infrared illumination in [[night vision]] uses including [[security camera]]s. A ring of LEDs around a [[video camera]], aimed forward into a [[retroreflective]] [[Projection screen|background]], allows [[chroma keying]] in [[video production]]s.

LEDs are used in [[Mining|mining operations]], as cap lamps to provide light for miners. Research has been done to improve LEDs for mining, to reduce glare and to increase illumination, reducing risk of injury to the miners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2011-192/ | title = CDC – NIOSH Publications and Products – Impact: NIOSH Light-Emitting Diode (LED) Cap Lamp Improves Illumination and Decreases Injury Risk for Underground Miners | publisher = cdc.gov | accessdate=May 3, 2013| doi = 10.26616/NIOSHPUB2011192 | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

LEDs are now used commonly in all market areas from commercial to home use: standard lighting, AV, stage, theatrical, architectural, and public installations, and wherever artificial light is used.

LEDs are increasingly finding uses in medical and educational applications, for example as mood enhancement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Janeway |first=Kimberly |url=https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/12/led-lightbulbs-that-promise-to-help-you-sleep/index.htm |title=LED lightbulbs that promise to help you sleep |work=Consumer Reports |date=2014-12-12 |accessdate=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and new technologies such as [[AmBX]], exploiting LED versatility. [[NASA]] has even sponsored research for the use of LEDs to promote health for astronauts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press_release | url=http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/Spinoff2008/hm_3.html | title=LED Device Illuminates New Path to Healing | publisher=nasa.gov | accessdate=January 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data communication and other signalling===
{{See also|Li-Fi|fibre optics}}
Light can be used to transmit data and analog signals. For example, lighting white LEDs can be used in systems assisting people to navigate in closed spaces while searching necessary rooms or objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ntv.ifmo.ru/en/article/11192/chastotnye_harakteristiki_sovremennyh_svetodiodnyh_lyuminofornyh_materialov.htm |title=Frequency characteristics of modern LED phosphor materials |author1=Fudin, M.

[[Assistive listening device]]s in many theaters and similar spaces use arrays of infrared LEDs to send sound to listeners' receivers. Light-emitting diodes (as well as semiconductor lasers) are used to send data over many types of [[Optical fiber|fiber optic]] cable, from digital audio over [[TOSLINK]] cables to the very high bandwidth fiber links that form the Internet backbone. For some time, computers were commonly equipped with [[IrDA]] interfaces, which allowed them to send and receive data to nearby machines via infrared.

Because LEDs can [[frequency|cycle on and off]] millions of times per second, very high data bandwidth can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Hank |last=Green |url=http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/2194/74/ |title=Transmitting Data Through LED Light Bulbs |publisher=EcoGeek |date=October 9, 2008 |accessdate=February 15, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212050729/http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/2194/74/ |archivedate=December 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable lighting===

Efficient lighting is needed for [[sustainable architecture]]. In 2009, US Department of Energy testing results on LED lamps showed an average efficacy of 35&amp;nbsp;lm/W, below that of typical [[Compact fluorescent lamp|CFLs]], and as low as 9&amp;nbsp;lm/W, worse than standard incandescent bulbs. A typical 13-watt LED lamp emitted 450 to 650 lumens,&lt;ref name="doe2009"&gt;{{Cite book| title=DOE Solid-State Lighting CALiPER Program Summary of Results: Round 7 of Product Testing| publisher=U.S. Department of Energy| date=February 2009| url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/publications/pdfs/ssl/caliper_round_7_summary_final.pdf| format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is equivalent to a standard 40-watt incandescent bulb.

However, as of 2011, there are LED bulbs available as efficient as 150&amp;nbsp;lm/W and even inexpensive low-end models typically exceed 50&amp;nbsp;lm/W, so that a 6-watt LED could achieve the same results as a standard 40-watt incandescent bulb. The latter has an expected lifespan of 1,000 hours, whereas an LED can continue to operate with reduced efficiency for more than 50,000 hours.

====Energy consumption====
In the US, one kilowatt-hour (3.6 MJ) of electricity currently causes an average {{convert|1.34|lb|g}} of {{chem|CO|2}} emission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/emission_factors.html US DOE EIA: Electricity Emission Factors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614045522/http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/emission_factors.html |date=June 14, 2009 }}. Eia.doe.gov. Retrieved on March 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming the average light bulb is on for 10 hours a day, a 40-watt bulb causes {{convert|196|lb}} of {{chem|CO|2}} emission per year. The 6-watt LED equivalent only causes {{convert|30|lb}} of {{chem|CO|2}} over the same time span. A building’s carbon footprint from lighting can, therefore, be reduced by 85% by exchanging all incandescent bulbs for new LEDs—if a building previously used only incandescent bulbs.

In practice, most buildings that use a lot of lighting use [[fluorescent lighting]], which has 22% [[luminous efficiency]] compared with 5% for filaments, so changing to LED lighting would still give a 34% reduction in electrical power use and carbon emissions.

The reduction in carbon emissions depends on the source of electricity. [[Nuclear power in the United States]] produced 19.2% of electricity in 2011, so reducing electricity consumption in the U.S. reduces carbon emissions more than in France ([[Nuclear power in France|75% nuclear electricity]]) or Norway ([[Energy in Norway#Electricity generation|almost entirely hydroelectric]]).

Replacing lights that spend the most time lit results in the most savings, so LED lights in infrequently used locations bring a smaller return on investment.

=== LED as a light source for machine vision systems ===
[[Machine vision]] systems, also known as [[Computer vision]] systems, often require bright and homogeneous illumination, so features of interest are easier to process. LEDs are often used to achieve this type of purpose, and this is likely to remain one of their major uses until their price drops low enough to make signaling and illumination uses more economically feasible.

[[Barcode scanner]]s are the most common example of machine vision applications, and many of those scanners use low-cost products red LEDs instead of laser-based LEDs.&lt;ref name="Administrator"&gt;{{cite web|title = Application of LED Lighting|url = http://www.abengroup.com/index.php/general-info/49-application-of-led-lighting|website = www.abengroup.com|access-date = 2016-02-12|last = Administrator|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170701152508/http://www.abengroup.com/index.php/general-info/49-application-of-led-lighting|archive-date = July 1, 2017|dead-url = yes|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Optical computer mice are an example of LEDs in machine vision, as it is used to provide an even light source on the surface for the miniature camera within the mouse. LEDs constitute a nearly ideal light source for [[machine vision]] systems for several reasons:
* The size of the illuminated field is usually comparatively small and machine vision systems are often quite expensive, so the cost of the light source is usually a minor concern. However, it might not be easy to replace a broken light source placed within complex machinery, and here the long service life of LEDs is a benefit.
* LED elements tend to be small and can be placed with high density over flat or even-shaped substrates (PCBs etc.) so that bright and homogeneous sources that direct light from tightly controlled directions on inspected parts can be designed. 
* LED lights can often be obtained with small, low-cost [[lens (optics)|lens]]es and [[diffuser (optics)|diffuser]]s that help achieve [[high light density|high light densities]] with control over lighting levels and homogeneity. 
* LED sources can also be shaped in several configurations (spot lights; ring lights; backlights; or linear assemblies ... etc).
* LEDs can be easily strobed (in the microsecond range and below) and synchronized with imaging. High-power LEDs are available allowing well-lit images even with very short light pulses. This is often used to obtain crisp and sharp [[still image]]s of quickly moving parts.
* LEDs come in several different colors and wavelengths, allowing easy use of the best color for each need, where different color may provide better visibility of features of interest. Having a precisely known spectrum lets tightly matched filters be used to separate informative bandwidth or to reduce disturbing effects of ambient light. LEDs usually operate at comparatively low working temperatures, simplifying heat management, and dissipation. This allows using plastic lenses, filters, and diffusers. Waterproof units can also easily be designed, allowing use in harsh or wet environments (food, beverage, or oil industry).&lt;ref name="Administrator"/&gt;

The light from LEDs can be modulated very quickly so they are used extensively in [[optical fiber]] and [[free space optics]] communications. This includes [[remote control]]s, such as for TVs, VCRs, and LED Computers, where infrared LEDs are often used. [[Opto-isolator]]s use an LED combined with a [[photodiode]] or [[phototransistor]] to provide a signal path with electrical isolation between two circuits. This is especially useful in medical equipment where the signals from a low-voltage [[sensor]] circuit (usually battery-powered) in contact with a living organism must be electrically isolated from any possible electrical failure in a recording or monitoring device operating at potentially dangerous voltages. An optoisolator also lets information be transferred between circuits that don't share a common ground potential.

Many sensor systems rely on light as the signal source. LEDs are often ideal as a light source due to the requirements of the sensors. LEDs are used as [[motion sensors]], for example in [[optical mouse|optical computer mice]]. The Nintendo [[Wii]]'s sensor bar uses infrared LEDs. [[Pulse oximeter]]s use them for measuring [[oxygen saturation]]. Some flatbed scanners use arrays of RGB LEDs rather than the typical [[cold-cathode fluorescent lamp]] as the light source. Having independent control of three illuminated colors allows the scanner to calibrate itself for more accurate color balance, and there is no need for warm-up. Further, its sensors only need be monochromatic, since at any one time the page being scanned is only lit by one color of light. Since LEDs can also be used as photodiodes, they can be used for both photo emission and detection. This could be used, for example, in a [[touchscreen]] that registers reflected light from a finger or [[stylus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dietz, P. H. |author2=Yerazunis, W. S. |author3=Leigh, D. L. |title=Very Low-Cost Sensing and Communication Using Bidirectional LEDs |year=2004 |url=http://www.merl.com/publications/TR2003-035/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many materials and biological systems are sensitive to, or dependent on, light. [[Grow lights]] use LEDs to increase [[photosynthesis]] in [[plant]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Goins, G. D. |author2=Yorio, N. C. |author3=Sanwo, M. M. |author4=Brown, C.

LEDs have also been used as a medium-quality [[voltage reference]] in electronic circuits. The forward voltage drop (e.g. about 1.7&amp;nbsp;V for a normal red LED) can be used instead of a [[Zener diode]] in low-voltage regulators. Red LEDs have the flattest I/V curve above the knee. Nitride-based LEDs have a fairly steep I/V curve and are useless for this purpose. Although LED forward voltage is far more current-dependent than a Zener diode, Zener diodes with breakdown voltages below 3&amp;nbsp;V are not widely available.

The progressive miniaturization of low-voltage lighting technology, such as [[LEDs]] and [[OLEDs]], suitable to incorporate into low-thickness materials has fostered experimentation in combining light sources and wall covering surfaces for interior walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schubert |first=E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3596">The '''London Declaration concerning the Laws of Naval War''' is an international code of [[maritime law]], especially as it relates to wartime activities, proposed in 1909 at the [[London Naval Conference#First conference|London Naval Conference]] by the leading European [[navy|naval]] powers, the [[United States]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], after a multinational conference that occurred in 1908 in [[London]]. The declaration largely reiterated existing law, but dealt with many controversial points, including [[blockade]]s, [[contraband]] and [[prize (law)|prize]], and showed greater regard to the rights of neutral entities.

The declaration was signed by most of the great powers of the day: [[Austria-Hungary]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]. (It was also signed by the [[Netherlands]] and [[Spain under the Restoration|Spain]].)&lt;ref name = signatures&gt;[https://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/States.xsp?xp_viewStates=XPages_NORMStatesSign&amp;xp_treatySelected=255 Declaration concerning the Laws of Naval War: Signatory States], icrc.org.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, no state ever ratified the declaration and consequently it never came into force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/ihl/INTRO/255?OpenDocument Declaration concerning the Laws of Naval War], icrc.org.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States insisted that the belligerent nations fighting in [[World War I]] abide by the Declaration, while the British and Germans ignored it.

The British [[Geostrategy|geostrategist]] and [[Naval history|naval historian]] Sir [[Julian Corbett]] argued strongly against the provisions of the Declaration which sought to outlaw 'general capture' of enemy commerce on the high seas during wartime. In his earlier 1907 essay 'The Capture of Private Property at Sea', he argued that the curtailment of the [[Royal Navy]]'s right to seize enemy shipping would have a detrimental impact on Britain's ability to wage economic warfare against a continental enemy; economic warfare being the single most important function of the Navy, in his view.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, J. (1907) [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001046867 'The Capture of Private Property at Sea', A. T. Mahan, ''Some Neglected Aspects of War''] (Boston: 1907).&lt;/ref&gt; The arguments he set out gained currency within the Navy and British government, and would eventually prevail with Britain's decision not to ratify the Declaration and the successful waging of maritime economic warfare, including 'general capture', against Germany during the [[World War One|First World War]].

'''''M. C. Mehta v. Kamal Nath''''' was a [[landmark case]] in [[Indian law|Indian]] [[environmental law]]. In the case, the [[Supreme Court of India]] held that the [[public trust doctrine]] applied in [[India]].&lt;ref name="Land Mark Cases"/&gt;

==Facts of the case==
The ''[[Indian Express]]'' published an article reporting that [[Span Motels Private Limited]], which owns Span Resorts, had floated another ambitious venture, Span Club. The family of Indian politician [[Kamal Nath]] has direct links with this company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PM declares his FDs, Kamal Nath &amp; Deora business interests |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/pm-declares-his-fds-kamal-nath---deora-business-interests/801260/|accessdate=14 May 2013|newspaper=Indian Express|date=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The club was built after encroaching upon 27.12 [[bigha]]s of land, including substantial [[forest]]land, in 1990. The land was later regularised and [[lease]]d out to the company on 11 April, 1994. 

The regularisation was done when Nath was [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Minister of Environment and Forests]]. This encroachment led to the swelling of the [[Beas River]], and the swollen river changed its course and engulfed the Span Club and the adjoining lawns, washing it away. For almost five months now, the Span Resorts management has been moving bulldozers and earth movers to turn the course of the Beas for a second time.

A worrying thought was that of the river eating into the mountains, leading to landslides which were an occasional occurrence in that area. In September, these caused floods in the Beas and property estimated to be worth Rs. 105 crore was destroyed.
The Government of India, Ministry of Environment and Forests by the letter dated 24.11.1993, addressed to the Secretary, Forest, Government of Himachal Pradesh, Shimla conveyed its prior approval in terms of Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 for leasing to the Motel 27 bighas and 12 biswas of forest land adjoining to the land already on lease with the Motel.
An expert committee formed to assess the situation of the area arrived at the following conclusion;

"The river is presently in a highly unstable regime after the extraordinary floods of 1995, and it is difficult to predict its behaviour if another high flood occur in the near future. A long-term planning for flood control in the Kullu Valley needs to be taken up immediately with the advice of an organisation having expertise in the field, and permanent measures shall be taken to protect the area so that recurrence of such a heavy flood is mitigated permanently".

==Arguments for the defendants==
* Whatever construction activity was done by the motel on the land under its possession and on the area around, if any, was done with a view to protect the lease-hold land from floods.
* Divisional Forest Officer permitted the motel to carry out the necessary works subject to the conditions that the department would not be liable to pay any amount incurred for the said purpose by the motel.
However, it could be easily ascertained from the facts that the Motel had made various constructions on the surrounding area and on the banks of the river.

==Judgment of the court==
{{Environmental law}}

The forest lands which have been given on lease to the Motel by the State Governments are situated at the bank of the river Beas. Beas is a young and dynamic river. The river is fast-flowing, carrying large boulders, at the time of flood. When water velocity is not sufficient to carry the boulders, these are deposited in the channel often blocking the flow of water. Under such circumstances the river stream changes its course, remaining within the valley but swinging from one bank to the other. The right bank of the river Beas where the motel is located mostly comes under forest, the left bank consists of plateaus, having steep banks facing the river, where fruit orchards and cereal cultivation are predominant. The area being ecologically fragile and full of scenic beauty should not have been permitted to be converted into private ownership and for commercial gains.

===Doctrine of Public trust under Roman Law===
The notion that the public has a right to expect certain lands and natural areas to retain their natural characteristic is finding its way into the law of the land. The ancient Roman Empire developed a legal theory known as the "Doctrine of the Public Trust". It was founded on the ideas that certain common properties such as rivers, sea-shore, forests and the air were held by Government in trusteeship for the free and unimpeded use of the general public. Under the Roman Law these resources were either owned by no one (Res Nullious) or by everyone in common (Res Communious).

===Doctrine of Public trust under English common Law===
Under the English common law, however, the Sovereign could own these resources but the ownership was limited in nature, the Crown could not grant these properties to private owners if the effect was to interfere with the public interests in navigation of fishing. Resources that were suitable for these uses were deemed to be held in trust by the Crown for the benefit of the public.
The Public Trust Doctrine primarily rests on the principle that certain resources like air, sea, waters and the forests have such a great importance to the people as a whole that it would be wholly unjustified to make them a subject of private ownership. The said resources being a gift of nature. They should be made freely available to everyone irrespective of the status in life. The doctrine enjoins upon the Government to protect the resources for the enjoyment of the general public rather than to permit their use for private ownership or commercial purposes.
Three types of restrictions on governmental authority are often thought to be imposed by the public trust: first, the property subject to the trust must not only be used for a public purpose, but it must be held available for use by the general public; second, the property may not be sold, even for a fair cash equivalent; and third, the property must be maintained for particular types of uses.

===Lake Mono Case===
[[Supreme Court of California]] said in the Mono Lake case,
“….the public trust is more than an affirmation of state power to use public property for public purposes. It is an affirmation of the duty of the state to protect the people's common heritage of streams, lakes, marshlands and tidelands, surrendering that right of protection only in rare cases when the abandonment of that right is consistent with the purposes of the trust...."
Our legal system-based on English Common Law - includes the public trust doctrine as part of its jurisprudence. The State is the trustee of all natural resources which are by nature meant for public use and enjoyment. The State as a trustee is under a legal duty to protect the natural resources. These resources meant for public use cannot be converted into private ownership.

The esthetic use and the pristine glory of the natural resources, the environment and the eco-systems of our country cannot be permitted to be eroded for private, commercial or any other use unless the courts find it necessary in good faith, for the public good and in public interest to encroach upon the said resources.

The Court said that they had no hesitation in holding that the Himachal Pradesh Government committed patent breach of public trust by leasing the ecologically fragile land to the Motel management. Both the lease - transactions are in patent breach of the trust held by the State Government. The second lease granted in the year 1994 was virtually of the land which is a part of riverbed. Even the board in its report has recommended deleasing of the said area.

==Orders of the Court==
The public trust doctrine, as discussed by the Court in this judgment was a part of the law of the land.
The prior approval granted by the Government of India, Ministry of Environment and Forest and the lease-deed dated 11.04.1994 in favour of the Motel were quashed. The lease granted to the Motel by the said lease-deed in respect of 27 bighas and 12 biswas of area, is cancelled and set aside. The Himachal Pradesh Government shall take over the area and restore it to its original-natural conditions.
The Motel shall pay compensation by way of cost for the restitution of the environment and ecology of the area. The pollution caused by various constitutions made by the Motel in the riverbed and the banks on the river Beas have to be removed and reversed.&lt;ref name="Land Mark Cases"&gt;{{cite web|title=Land Mark Cases|url=http://www.mcmef.org/landmark.htm|publisher=mcmef.org|accessdate=9 January 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227053748/http://www.mcmef.org/landmark.htm|archivedate=27 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Morrison v Upper Hutt City Council''' [1998] 2 NZLR 331, [1998] NZRMA 224 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding negilgence claims against the government
.&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
After first granting Morrison a building consent to build a new town house, the UHCC later withdrew the consent after discovering it had been issued outside of the District Plan.

Morrison appealed successfully to the Environment Court, and subsequently sought damages from the council.

==Held==

The court ruled that a council had no liability for making what is a quasi judicial decision.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12671">[[File:Open research.ogv|500px|thumb|thumbtime=43|Open research is concerned with making scientific research more transparent, more collaborative and more efficient. A central aspect to it is to provide [[open access]] to scientific information, especially to the research published in [[scholarly journal]]s and to the underlying [[scientific data|data]], much of which traditional science tends to hide away. Other aspects are more open forms of collaboration and engagement with a wider audience, including [[citizen science|citizen scientists]] and the public at large.]]

'''Open research''' is research conducted in the spirit of [[free and open-source software]]. Much like open-source schemes that are built around a [[source code]] that is made public, the central theme of open research is to make clear accounts of the methodology freely available via the internet, along with any data or results extracted or derived from them. This permits a massively distributed collaboration, and one in which anyone may participate at any level of the project.

Especially if the research is scientific in nature, it is frequently referred to as [[open science]].&lt;ref&gt;For an overview, see [https://www.amazon.com/Reinventing-Discovery-New-Networked-Science/dp/0691148902/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1319948131&amp;sr=1-1 "Reinventing Discovery"] by Michael Nielsen, Princeton University Press (21 October 2011), {{ISBN|0-691-14890-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woelfle|first=Michael|author2=Olliaro, Piero |author3=Todd, Matthew H. |title=Open science is a research accelerator|journal=Nature Chemistry|date=23 September 2011|volume=3|issue=10|pages=745–748|doi=10.1038/nchem.1149|url=http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v3/n10/full/nchem.1149.html|accessdate=16 October 2013|pmid=21941234|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Open research'' can also include [[social sciences]], the [[humanities]], [[mathematics]], engineering and medicine.

== Types of open projects ==
Important distinctions exist between different types of open projects.

Projects that provide open data but don't offer open collaboration are referred to as "[[Open access (publishing)|open access]]" rather than open research. Providing [[open data]] is a necessary but not sufficient condition for open research, because although the data may be used by anyone, there is no [[Share-alike|requirement for subsequent research to take place openly]]. For example, though there have been many calls for more open collaborative research in drug discovery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hopkins|first=Andrew L.|author2=Witty, Michael J. |author3=Nwaka, Solomon |title=Neglected Diseases Mission possible|journal=Nature|date=13 September 2007|volume=449|issue=7159|pages=166–169|doi=10.1038/449166a|pmid=17851512|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v449/n7159/full/449166a.html|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the open deposition of large amounts of data,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v465/n7296/full/nature09107.html F. -J. Gamo, et al. Thousands of chemical starting points for antimalarial lead identification. ''Nature'' '''2010''', ''465'', 305–310]&lt;/ref&gt; there are very few active, openly collaborative projects in this area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openwetware.org/wiki/Open_Source_Drug_Discovery Open Source Drug Discovery wiki]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osdd.net/ Indian Open Source Drug Discovery portal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mendeley.com/groups/1150251/open-source-drug-discovery/ Mendeley Group on Open Source Drug Discovery]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crowdsourcing]] projects that recruit large numbers of participants to carry out small tasks which are then assembled into a larger project outcome have delivered significant research outcomes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature09304 S. Cooper, ''et al.'' Predicting protein structures with a multiplayer online game. ''Nature'' '''2010''' ''466'', 756–760]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13490.x K. Land et al. Galaxy Zoo: the large-scale spin statistics of spiral galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, ''Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc.'' '''2008''', ''388'', 1686–1692]&lt;/ref&gt; but these projects are distinct from those in which participants are able to influence the overall direction of the research, or in which participants are expected to have creative input into the science behind the project.

Most open research is conducted within existing research groups. Primary research data are posted which can be added to, or interpreted by, anyone who has the necessary expertise and who can therefore join the collaborative effort. Thus the "end product" of the project (which may still be subject to future expansion or modification) arises from many contributions across multiple research groups, rather than the effort of one group or individual. Open research is therefore distinct from open access in that the output of open research is prone to change with time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Todd|first=Matthew H.|title=Open access and open source in chemistry|journal=Chemistry Central Journal|date=1 January 2007|volume=1|issue=1|pages=3|doi=10.1186/1752-153X-1-3|pmid=17939849|pmc=1975827|url=http://journal.chemistrycentral.com/content/1/1/3|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike open access, true open research must demonstrate live, online collaboration. Project websites that demonstrate this capability have started to become available.&lt;ref name=TSL&gt;[http://www.thesynapticleap.org/ The Synaptic Leap]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MIAWiki&gt;[http://confocal-manawatu.pbworks.com/w/page/49706793/MIAWiki%20Real-Time%20Collaboration/ MIAWiki for Open Research and Collaboration]&lt;/ref&gt;

While first attempts towards opening research were primarily aimed at opening areas such as scientific data, methodologies, software and publications, now increasingly other artifacts of the scientific workflow are also tackled, such as scientific meta-data&lt;ref&gt;[http://OpenResearch.org Main Page – OpenResearch.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and funding ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Auer, S.; Braun-Thürmann, H.: [http://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~auer/publication/OpenScience.pdf Towards Bottom-Up, Stakeholder-Driven Research Funding – Open Source Funding, Open Peer Review.]

In 2013, open research became more mainstream with web based platforms such as [[figshare]] continuing to grow in terms of users and publicly available outputs.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, S: [http://research.gigaom.com/2013/12/tools-for-sharing-open-research-materials-zenodo-and-figshare/ Tools for sharing open research materials]

The Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Committee met in 2014 to address one key element of the incentive systems: journals' procedures and policies for publication. The committee consisted of disciplinary leaders, journal editors, funding agency representatives, and disciplinary experts largely from the social and behavioral sciences. By developing shared standards for open practices across journals, the committee said it hopes to translate scientific norms and values into concrete actions and change the current incentive structures to drive researchers' behavior toward more openness.&lt;ref name=Science-Mag-2015-06-26/&gt; The committee said it sought to produce guidelines that (a) focus on the commonalities across disciplines, and that (b) define what aspects of the research process should be made available to the community to evaluate, critique, reuse, and extend. The committee added that the guidelines aim to help improve journal policies in order to help transparency, openness, and reproducibility "become more evident in daily practice and ultimately improve the public trust in science, and science itself."&lt;ref name="Science-Mag-2015-06-26"&gt;B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2553">In Canada a '''policy jury''' or citizen jury is a body of people convened to render a decision or advice on a matter of public policy. It is similar to juries used in modern court trial except that the subject of its deliberation is a matter of public policy, rather than law. The concept of the policy jury is closely connected with [[deliberative democracy]] or [[participatory]] models of democratic governance, and is similar to a [[deliberative opinion poll]].

In some cases, policy juries are composed of randomly selected members of a given population. Citizens participating in a policy jury engage in a comprehensive learning and deliberation processes before settling on a conclusion or set of recommendations.

Policy juries have been used in [[Canada]]. Citizens’ Assemblies on Electoral Reform convened in British Columbia in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citizensassembly.bc.ca/public |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050924143403/http://citizensassembly.bc.ca/public |archivedate=2005-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ontario in 2006&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.citizensassembly.gov.on.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; used policy juries to address alternative electoral systems. Three of Ontario’s Local Health Integration Networks (LHIN) have referred their Integrated Health Service Plans (IHSP) for 2010-2013 to policy juries for advice and refinement. LHINs referring their IHSPs to policy juries include the South East LHIN,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.southeastlhin.on.ca/Page.aspx?id=2346&lt;/ref&gt; Central LHIN and Mississauga Halton LHIN.

'''Political demography''' is the study of how population change affects politics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Myron Weiner|Weiner, Myron]] and Michael S. Teitelbaum. 2001. ''Political Demography and Demographic Engineering''. New York: Bergahn Books; [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 Goldstone, Jack A., Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft, ed. 2011. Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security. Oxford: Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Population change is driven by classic [[Demographics|demographic]] mechanisms – birth, death, age structure, and migration. 

However, in political demography, there is always scope for assimilation as well as boundary and identity change, which can redraw the boundaries of populations in a way that is not possible with biological populations.&lt;ref&gt;Bookman, Milica Zarkovic. 1997. The demographic struggle for power : the political economy of demographic engineering in the modern world. London ; Portland, OR: Frank Cass&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, political-demographic projections can account for both demographic factors and transitions caused by social change. A notable leader in the area of sub-state population projection is the [http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/POP/ World Population Program] of the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria. 

Some of the issues which are studied in the context of political demography are: surges of young people in the developing world, significantly increasing aging in the developed world, and the impact of increasing urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 |title=Political Demography - Jack A. Goldstone; Eric P. Kaufmann - Oxford University Press |publisher=Oup.com |date=2011-12-31 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political demographers study issues like population growth in a political context. A population's growth is impacted by the relative balance of variables like mortality, fertility and immigration.&lt;ref name="sneps1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sneps.net/research-interests/political-demography-ethnicity-nationalism-religion |title=The Political Demography of Ethnicity, Nationalism and Religion &amp;#124; Eric Kaufmann |publisher=Sneps.net |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many of the present world's most powerful nations are aging quickly, largely as a result of major decreases in fertility rates and major increases in life expectancies.&lt;ref name="wilsoncenter1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/political-demography-identity-institutions-and-conflict-book-launch |title=Political Demography: How Population Changes Are Reshaping International Security and National Politics |publisher=Wilson Center |date=2012-01-10 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the labor pools in these nations shrink, and spending on the elderly increases, their economies are likely to slow down.&lt;ref name="wilsoncenter1"/&gt; By 2050, the workforce in Japan and Russia is predicted to decrease by more than 30 percent, while the German workforce is expected to decline by 25 percent by that year.&lt;ref name="wilsoncenter1"/&gt; The governments of these countries have made financial commitments to the elderly in their populations which will consume huge percentages of their national GDP.&lt;ref name="wilsoncenter1"/&gt; For example, based on current numbers, more than 25% of the national GDPs of Japan, France and Germany will be consumed by these commitments by 2040.&lt;ref name="wilsoncenter1"/&gt;

==Political demography and evolution==
Differential reproductive success is the mechanism through which evolution takes place. For much of human history this occurred through migrations and wars of conquest, with disease and mortality through famine and war affecting the power of empires, tribes and city-states. Differential fertility also played a part, though typically reflected resource availability rather than cultural factors.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared. (1997). Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. New York: W.W. Norton; McNeill, William Hardy. 1976. Plagues and peoples. 1st ed. Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; Though culture has largely usurped this role, some claim that differential demography continues to affect cultural and political evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Blume, Michael. 2009. "'The Reproductive Benefits of Religious Affiliation'." In The Biological Evolution of Religious Mind and Behavior, ed. E. Voland and W. Schiefenhövel. New York: Springer-Verlag, pp. 117-26 (Blume 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uneven transition, democratization and globalization==
The demographic transition from the late eighteenth century onwards opened up the possibility that significant change could occur within and between political units. Though the writings of Polybius and Cicero in classical times bemoaned the low fertility of the patrician elite as against their more fecund barbarian competitors,&lt;ref name="autogeneratedci"&gt;Jackson, Richard, and Neil Howe. 2011. "'Global Aging And Global Security In The 21st Century'." in [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security, ed. J. A. Goldstone, Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft. Oxford: Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; differential fertility has probably only recently emerged as a central aspect of political demography. 

This has come about due to medical advances which have lowered infant mortality while conquest migrations have faded as a factor in world history. Differences in immunity levels to infectious diseases between populations also play no major role in our age of modern medicine and widespread exposure to a common disease pool. 

It is not so much the trajectory of demographic transition that counts as the fact that it has become more intense and uneven in the late twentieth century as it has spread into the developing world. Uneven transitions lend themselves to differential growth rates between contending groups. These changes are in turn, magnified by democratization, which entrenches majority rule and privileges the power of numbers in politics as never before.

Indeed, in many new democracies riven by ethnic and religious conflicts, elections are akin to censuses while groups seek to 'win the census'. Ethnic parties struggle to increase their constituencies through pronatalism ('wombfare'), oppose family planning, and contest census and election results.&lt;ref&gt;Toft, Monica Duffy. 2011. "Wombfare: The Religious and Political Dimensions of Fertility and Demographic Change." in [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security, ed. J. A. Goldstone, Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft. Oxford: Oxford University Press]; Horowitz, D. 1985. Ethnic Groups in Conflict. Berkeley: University of California Press, esp. chapters 3-4,7 and 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic, national and civilizational conflict===
One branch of political demography examines how differences in population growth between nation-states, religions, ethnic groups and civilizations affects the balance of power between these political actors. For instance, Ethiopia is projected to have a larger population than Russia in 2020, and while there were 3.5 Europeans per African in 1900, there will be four Africans for each European in 2050.&lt;ref&gt;Demeny, P, and G. McNicoll, eds. 2006. The Political Economy of Global Population Change, 1950-2050. New York: Population Council&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wilsoncenter1" /&gt; Population has always counted for national power to some degree and it is unlikely that these changes will leave the world system unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 Goldstone, Jack A., Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft, ed. 2011. Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security, ed. J. A. Goldstone, Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft. Oxford: Oxford University Press]., 'Introduction'.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The same dynamic can be witnessed within countries due to [[Demographic threat|differential ethnic population growth]].&lt;ref&gt;Himmelfarb, Milton, and Victor Baras (eds). 1978. Zero Population Growth-For Whom?: differential fertility and minority group survival. Westport, CT: Praeger; Leuprecht, C. 2011.

J. A. Goldstone, Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft. Oxford: Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Irish Catholics in Northern Ireland increased their share of the population through higher birthrates and the momentum of a youthful age structure from 35 to nearly 50 percent of the total between 1965 and 2011. Similar changes, also affected by in- and out-migration, have taken place in, amongst others, the United States (Hispanics), Israel-Palestine (Jews and Arabs), Kosovo (Albanians), Lebanon (Shia, with decline of Christians) and Nagorno-Karabakh (Armenians). 

In the US, the growth of Hispanics and Asians, and Hispanics' youthful age profile as against whites, has the potential to tilt more states away from the Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;Frey, William H. 2011. "Racial Demographics and the 2008 Presidential Election in the United States " in [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security, ed. J. A. Goldstone, Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft. Oxford: Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the fertility advantage of conservative over liberal white voters is significant and rising, thus the Republicans are poised to win a larger share of the white vote - especially over the very long run of 50 to 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;Lesthaeghe, R., and L. Neidert. 2006. "The Second Demographic Transition in the United States:. Exception or Textbook Example?" Population and Development Review 32 (4):669-98; Kaufmann, Eric, A. Goujon, and [[Vegard Skirbekk|V Skirbekk]]. 2011. "American political affiliation, 2003-43: A cohort component projection." Population Studies&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to London-based scholar [[Eric Kaufmann]], the high birth rates of religious fundamentalists as against seculars and moderates has contributed to an increase in religious fundamentalism and decrease of moderate religion within religious groups, as in Israel, the US and the Muslim Middle East. Kaufmann, armed with empirical from a number of countries, also posits that this will be further bolstered by the higher retention rates of religious fundamentalists, with individuals in religiously fundamentalist households less likely to become religiously non-observant than others.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Eric. 2011.

==Age structure and politics==
===Youth bulges===
A second avenue of inquiry considers age structures: be these [[Population pyramid|'youth bulges']] or aging populations. Young populations are associated with a ratio of dependents to producers: a high proportion of the population under age 16 puts pressure on resources. A 'youth bulge' of those in the 16-30 bracket creates a different set of problems.

A large population of adolescents entering the labor force and electorate strains at the seams of the economy and polity, which were designed for smaller populations. This creates unemployment and alienation unless new opportunities are created quickly enough - in which case a 'demographic dividend' accrues because productive workers outweigh young and elderly dependents. Yet the 16-30 age range is associated with risk-taking, especially among males.

In general, youth bulges in developing countries are associated with higher unemployment and, as a result, a heightened risk of violence and political instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Huntington | first1 = Samuel P | year = 1996 | title = The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order. | location = New York, NY|publisher= Simon and Schuster }}; {{cite journal | authorlink=Henrik Urdal |last1=Urdal|first1= Henrik|year= 2006| title = A Clash of Generations?

"The Age-structural Maturity Thesis: The Youth Bulge's Influence on the Advent and Stability of Liberal Democracy?" In [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security, ed. J. A. Goldstone, Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft. Oxford: Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population aging===
Population aging presents the obverse effect: older populations are less risk-taking and less prone to violence and instability. However, like those under-16, they place great strain on the social safety net, especially in countries committed to old-age provision and high-quality medical care. 

Some observers believe that the advent of a much older planet, courtesy of below-replacement fertility in Europe, North America, China and much of the rest of Asia and Latin America, will produce a 'geriatric peace'.&lt;ref&gt;Haas, M. L. 2007. "A geriatric peace? The future of US power in a world of aging populations." International Security 32 (1):112-32; Haas, Mark. 2011. "'America’s Golden Years?:U.S. Security in an Aging World'." in [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security, ed. J. A. Goldstone, Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft. Oxford: Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;  Others are concerned that population aging will bankrupt the welfare state and handicap western liberal democracies' ability to project power abroad to defend their interests. A more cautious climate could also herald slower economic growth, less entrepreneurship and reduced productivity in mature democracies.&lt;ref name="autogeneratedci" /&gt; 

It is also possible that ageing leads to lower inflation as elderly people are both inflation averse and politically powerful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vlandas|first1=T|title=Grey power and the economy: Ageing and inflation across advanced economies|journal=Comparative Political Studies |date=2017|doi=10.1177/0010414017710261}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some argue that older people in the developed world have much higher productivity, human capital and better health than their counterparts in developing countries, so the economic effects of population aging will be largely mitigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=[[Vegard Skirbekk|Skirbekk, Vegard]], Elke Loichinger and Daniela Weber|date=2011|title='Variation in cognitive functioning as a refined approach to comparing aging across countries'|publisher=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/12/13/1112173109|accessdate=2013-10-06|doi=10.1073/pnas.1112173109|volume=109|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=770–774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emerging discipline==
The study of political demography is in its early stages and can be traced back to the works of figures such as Jack Goldstone, whom is often considered to be the father of Political Demography. Since 2000 the subject has drawn the attention of policymakers and journalists and is now emerging as an academic subfield. Panels on political demography appear at demography conferences such as the [http://www.populationassociation.org/ Population Association of America (PAA)] and [http://www.eaps.nl/index.php European Association for Population Studies (EAPS)]. There is now a [http://www.isanet.org/pd/page/2/ political demography section] at the International Studies Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isanet.org/pd/page/2/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521160905/http://www.isanet.org/pd/page/2/ |archivedate=May 21, 2012 |title=The Political Demography &amp; Geography Section Charter |deadurl=yes |accessdate=June 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of important international conferences have also taken place since 2006 on the subject.&lt;ref name="sneps1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6153">A '''qualified website authentication certificate''' ('''QWAC certificate''') is a [[qualified digital certificate]] under the trust services defined in the [[eIDAS]] Regulation.

An [[ENISA]] report proposed six strategies and twelve recommended actions as an escalated approach that targets the most important aspects detected to be critical for improving the website authentication market in Europe and successfully introducing qualified website authentication certificates as a means to increase transparency in this market.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/qualified-website-authentication-certificates QWAC certificate on enisa.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.quovadisglobal.com/QVRepository/RepositoryUpdates.aspx eIDAS Qualified Website Authentication Certificates on quovadisglobal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== QWAC in the context of other standards ==
There are different types of website authentication certificates: Domain Validated (DV), Organization Validated (OV) and [[Extended Validation Certificate|Extended Validation]] (EV).
Another distinction that can be made among types of website authentication certificates relates to the number of domains that are secured by the certificate: Single domain, [[wildcard certificate|wildcard]], [[Subject Alternative Name|multi domain]]. Extended Validation certificates offer the highest quality in terms of assurance of the identity of a certificate owner among exiting types of certificate in the market. Typically the use of an EV certificate is indicated by a green color – but this varies by browser.

The eIDAS Regulation has taken into account that there is an established market with its own industrial standardization efforts. The objective is not to create a disruption with existing initiatives and to optimize the effort for qualified providers to align both with the EU regulations and with the existing market standards.

== eIDAS Regulation ==
In the eIDAS Regulation trust services are defined as electronic services, normally provided by trust service providers (TSPs), which consist of electronic signatures, electronic seals, electronic time stamps, electronic registered delivery services and website authentication.&lt;ref name="Tuner_Understanding eIDAS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn|title=Understanding eIDAS|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/understanding-eidas|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eIDAS-EUR-Lex"&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG|website=EUR-Lex|publisher=The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In essence, the eIDAS Regulation provides a framework to promote:&lt;ref name="eIDAS-TrustServiceProviders"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Trust Service Providers according to eIDAS|url=https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/trust-service-providers-according-to-eidas|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Transparency and accountability: well-defined minimal obligations for TSPs and liability.
* Guarantee of trustworthiness of the services together with security requirements for TSPs.
* Technological neutrality: avoiding requirements which could only be met by a specific technology.
* Market rules and standardization certainty.

== Content ==
Website authentication certificates are one of the five trust service defined in the eIDAS Regulation. Article 45 sets the requirement for trust service providers issuing qualified website authentication certificates of being qualified, which implies that all requirements for [[qualified trust service provider]]s (QTSPs) described in the previous section will be applicable. Annex IV defines the content of qualified certificates for website authentication:&lt;ref name="eIDAS-EUR-Lex" /&gt;

{{ordered list
| An indication that the certificate has been issued as a qualified certificate for website authentication.

{{Youth rights sidebar}}

The '''Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms''' ({{lang-fr|Charte des droits et libertés de la personne}}) is a statutory [[bill of rights]] and [[human rights]] code passed by the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] on June 27, 1975.  It received [[Royal Assent]] from [[Lieutenant Governor of Quebec|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Hugues Lapointe]], coming into effect on June 28, 1976.

Introduced by the [[Liberal Party of Quebec|Liberal]] government of [[Robert Bourassa]], the charter followed extensive preparatory work that began under the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] government of [[Daniel Johnson, Sr.|Daniel Johnson]]. The charter ranks among other [[Quasi-constitutionality (Canada)|quasi-constitutional]] Quebec laws, such as the [[Charter of the French Language]] and the [[Freedom of information legislation#Canada|Act respecting Access to documents held by public bodies and the Protection of personal information]]. Having precedence over all provincial legislation (including the latter), the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms stands at the pinnacle of Quebec's legal system. Only the [[Constitution of Canada]], including the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], enjoys priority over the Quebec charter.

==Provisions==
The Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms consists of six parts:

* ''Part I'' defines fundamental [[human rights]]. Its six chapters enunciate fundamental freedoms and rights, equality rights, political rights, judicial rights, economic and social rights, and interpretative provisions.
* ''Part II'' establishes the ''[[Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse]]'' (Human Rights and Youth Rights Commission). The commission is responsible for promoting and upholding the principles of the charter by any appropriate measures, including investigating possible cases of discrimination and the instigation of litigation. Members of the commission are appointed by the National Assembly. The commission's staff members do not belong to the Civil Service, in order to safeguard their independence.
* ''Part III'' provides for affirmative action programs.
* ''Part IV'' guarantees rights to privacy.
* ''Part V'' gives the government regulatory powers.
* ''Part VI'' establishes the [[Human Rights Tribunal of Quebec]], whose members that hold the decision-making power are chosen from among the judiciary.

==Comparison with other human rights instruments==
The Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms is unique among Canadian (and North American) human rights documents in that it covers not only the fundamental (civil and political) human rights, but also a number of important social and economic rights. The protections contained in the charter are inspired by the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]. Furthermore, the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination included in the Quebec charter is extensive; a total of fourteen prohibited grounds are enumerated, including race, colour, ethnic or national origin, sex, pregnancy and age. "Social condition" has been a prohibited ground of discrimination since the charter came into force. Discrimination based on sexual orientation has been prohibited since 1977; with that change, Quebec became the first jurisdiction larger than a city or county to prohibit anti-gay discrimination. In 2016, [[gender identity|gender identity or expression]] was added to the Quebec Charter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=5&amp;file=2016C19A.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enforceability ==
An illicit violation of the charter, whether by a private party or by the [[Monarchy in Quebec|provincial Crown]], may give rise to a cease-and-desist order and to compensation for damages. Punitive damages may be awarded in case of an intentional and unlawful violation.

The Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms is called quasi-constitutional because, according to section 52, no provision of any other act passed by the Quebec National Assembly may derogate from sections 1 to 38, unless such act expressly states that it applies despite the charter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&amp;file=/C_12/C12_A.HTM Charter of human rights and freedoms]&lt;/ref&gt; A total impossibility to adopt derogating laws could be considered incompatible with [[parliamentary sovereignty]], a fundamental principle in political systems following the British tradition; however, Canada, of which Quebec is a province, has a tradition of constitutional supremacy.  Its Constitution, which includes the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], is supreme, binding the federal parliament and the legislative assemblies of Canada's provinces and territories.

The Quebec charter's supremacy under its section 52 applies to the following categories of rights: fundamental rights and freedoms (the right to life, free speech, freedom of religion, the right to privacy, etc.); the right to equality; political rights; and judicial rights.  Economic and social rights do not enjoy supremacy but, according to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in the 2002 case of [[Gosselin v. Quebec (Attorney General)]], failure to respect such a right may give rise to a judicial declaration of violation.

The charter provides for a specific machinery in cases of discrimination (or exploitation of an elderly person or person with a disability). Instead of introducing litigation in court, victims of such a violation may file a complaint with the Human Rights and Youth Rights Commission. The commission will investigate the matter and attempt to foster a settlement between the parties. It may recommend corrective measures. If those are not followed, the commission may introduce litigation before a court (usually, but not necessarily, the [[Human Rights Tribunal of Quebec|Human Rights Tribunal]]). Victims will be represented free of charge by the commission.

The Quebec charter does not apply to federally regulated activities in Quebec. Those are subject to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and/or the [[Canadian Human Rights Act]].

* ''[[Ford v. Quebec (Attorney General)]]'', [1988] 2 S.C.R. 712 : Freedom of expression and signs
* ''[[Devine v. Quebec (Attorney General)]]'' [1988] 2 S.C.R. 790 : Freedom of expression

{{Civil procedure (United States)}}

In law, a '''settlement''' is a resolution between disputing parties about a [[lawsuit|legal case]], reached either before or after court action begins. The term "settlement" also has other meanings in the context of law. [[Structured settlement]]s provide for future periodic payments, instead of a one time cash payment.

==Basis==
A settlement, as well as dealing with the dispute between the parties is a [[contract]] between those parties, and is one possible (and common) result when parties [[lawsuit|sue]] (or contemplate so doing) each other in [[Private law|civil]] [[proceedings]]. The [[plaintiff]](s) and defendant(s) identified in the [[lawsuit]] can  end the dispute between themselves without a [[trial (law)|trial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/536312/settlement |title=settlement (law) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contract is based upon the bargain that a party forgoes its ability to sue (if it has not sued already), or to continue with the claim (if the plaintiff has sued), in return for the certainty written into the settlement.  The courts will enforce the settlement:  if it is breached, the party in default could be sued for breach of that contract. In some jurisdictions, the party in default could also face the original action being restored.

The settlement of the lawsuit defines legal requirements of the parties, and is often put in force by an order of the court after a joint [[stipulation]] by the parties. In other situations (as where the claims have been satisfied by the payment of a certain sum of money) the plaintiff and defendant can simply file a notice that the case has been dismissed.

The majority of cases are decided by a settlement. Both sides (regardless of relative monetary resources) often have a strong incentive to settle to avoid the costs (such as legal fees, finding expert witnesses, etc.), the time and the stress associated with a trial, particularly where a trial by jury is available.  Generally, one side or the other will make a [[settlement offer]] early in litigation. The parties may hold (and indeed, the court may require) a [[settlement conference]], at which they attempt to reach such a settlement.

In controversial cases, it may be written into a settlement that both sides keep its contents and all other information relevant to the case confidential, and/or that one of the parties (usually the one being sued) does not, by agreeing to the settlement, admit to any fault or wrongdoing in the underlying issue.

A "global settlement" is one employed where suits have been filed, or charges brought, in multiple jurisdictions and is defined as "a legal agreement that addresses or compromises both civil claims and criminal charges against a corporation or other large entity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.todayquestions.com/300218-06375149/?title=Definition+of+Global+Settlement|law.today questions.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of a global settlement include the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement]] between the attorneys general of 46 U.S. states and the four major U.S. tobacco companies in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;''Global Settlement of Tobacco Litigation: Hearing Before the Commerce, Science, and Transportation, U.S. Senate'' (U.S. Government Printing Office, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example is within the [[Global Analyst Research Settlements]].

==Specific jurisdictions==
===United States===

Usually, lawsuits end in a settlement, with an empirical analysis finding that less than 2% of cases end with a trial, 90% of [[tort]]s settle, and around 50% of other civil cases settle.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barkai|first=John|last2=Kent|first2=Elizabeth|date=2014-01-01|title=Let's Stop Spreading Rumors About Settlement and Litigation: A Comparative Study of Settlement and Litigation in Hawaii Courts|ssrn=2398550|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, when a settlement is reached in the U.S., it will be submitted to the court to be "rolled into a [[court order]]." This is done so that the court which was initially assigned the case may retain jurisdiction over it. The court is then free to modify its order as necessary to achieve justice in the case, and a party that breaches the settlement may be held in [[contempt of court]], rather than facing only a civil claim for the breach. A party may request that the case be [[Prejudice (legal term)|dismissed with prejudice]] to ensure that the lawsuit cannot be resubmitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legaldictionary.net/dismissed-with-prejudice/|title=Dismissed with Prejudice Definition, Examples, Cases, Processes|website=Legal Dictionary|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Negotiations ====
Under Federal Rule of Evidence 408, settlement negotiations cannot usually be introduced as evidence at trial,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.americanbar.org/litigation/committees/businesstorts/articles/summer2013-0713-admissibility-of-settlement-related-evidence-at-trial.html|title=Admissibility of Settlement-Related Evidence at Trial|website=apps.americanbar.org|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many state rules of evidence have similar rules modeled after it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wc.com/assets/attachments/The_Settlement_Privilege_Fact_or_Fiction.PDF|title=THE SETTLEMENT PRIVILEGE: FACT OR FICTION?|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Ethics &amp; Privilege|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403160837/https://www.wc.com/assets/attachments/The_Settlement_Privilege_Fact_or_Fiction.PDF|archive-date=2016-04-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Confidentiality ====
Most settlements are confidential. In these cases, the court order may refer to another document which is not disclosed, but which may be revealed to prove a breach of the settlement. Confidentiality is not possible in [[class action]] cases in the United States, where all settlements are subject to approval by the court pursuant to Rule 23 of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] and counterpart rules adopted in most states.

In some cases, confidential settlements are requested in discovery. Federal courts can issue [[protective order]]s preventing the release, but the party seeking to prevent disclosure must show that harm or prejudice would result from the disclosure.&lt;ref name="produce_or_not"&gt;{{cite web|title=Confidential Settlement Agreements: To Produce Or Not To Produce?|url=http://www.reedsmith.com/Confidential-Settlement-Agreements-To-Produce-Or-Not-To-Produce-03-18-2011/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://perma.cc/WA6Z-NLY2|archivedate=2016-03-20|df=|access-date=2016-03-20}}{{sbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; In specific states such as California, however the burden is on the party seeking release of the confidential settlement.&lt;ref name="produce_or_not" /&gt;

===== Limitations =====
The confidentiality of settlements is controversial as it allows damaging actions to remain secret, as occurred in the [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|Catholic sexual abuse scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/27/nyregion/albany-diocese-settled-abuse-case-for-almost-1-million.html|title=Albany Diocese Settled Abuse Case for Almost $1 Million|last=Goodstein|first=Laurie|date=2002-06-27|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, some states have passed laws which limit confidentiality. For example, in 1990 Florida passed a 'Sunshine in Litigation' law which limits confidentiality from concealing public hazards.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/publications/gp_solo/2012/november_december2012privacyandconfidentiality/confidentiality_settlement_agreements_is_bad_clients_lawyers_justice.html|title=Confidentiality in Settlement Agreements Is Bad for Clients, Bad for Lawyers, Bad for Justice|website=www.americanbar.org|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington state, Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana have laws limiting confidentiality as well, although judicial interpretation has weakened the application of these types of laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol154/iss2/4/|title="Quality, Not Quantity: An Analysis of Confidential Settlements and Lit" by Alison Lothes|website=scholarship.law.upenn.edu|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. Congress, a similar federal Sunshine in Litigation Act has been proposed but not passed in 2009, 2011, 2014, and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fan|first=Mary D.|date=2015-09-18|title=Private Data, Public Safety: A Bounded Access Model of Disclosure|ssrn=2662678|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confidentiality agreements which keep secrets from regulators about violations is probably unenforceable, but a specific carveout granting regulators access is usually not included.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

===England and Wales===
In [[England and Wales]], if the matter is already before the courts, except in a case where the claim is to be dismissed outright and the Claimant agrees to pay the Defendant's costs, the matter is usually dealt with by a [[consent order]], signed by the legal representatives of both parties and approved by the judge.

To get around the issue of confidentiality referred to above, a standard procedure consent order, known as a [[Tomlin Order]] is entered into. The order itself contains an agreement that the claim is [[stay of proceedings|stayed]] and no further action can be taken in court (except for referring a dispute in the implementation of the order to court, which is allowed). The order also deals with payment of costs, and payments of money out of court if any money is held by the court (as these are matters which must be dealt with by Court Order). However, the actual terms of the settlement are dealt with in a 'schedule' to the order, which can remain confidential. Breach of the schedule can be dealt with as breach of contract, or breach of the consent order.

=== Israel ===
In Israel, which is a common law jurisdiction, settlements almost always are submitted to the court, for two reasons:  (a) only by submitting the settlement to the court can the litigants control whether the court will order one or more parties to pay costs, and (b) the plaintiff (claimant) usually prefers for the settlement to be given the effect of a judgment.

==Criminal cases==
In [[Criminal law|criminal]] matters, the closest parallel to a settlement is a [[plea bargain]], although this differs in several important respects, particularly the ability of the presiding judge to reject the terms of a settlement.

'''''Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service''''', 816 [[F. Supp.]] 432 (W.D. Tex. 1993), was a [[lawsuit]] arising from a 1990 raid by the [[United States Secret Service]] on the headquarters of [[Steve Jackson Games]] (SJG) in [[Austin, Texas]]. The raid, along with the Secret Service's unrelated [[Operation Sundevil]], was influential in the founding of the  [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sjgames.com/SS/topten.html |title=The Top Ten Media Errors About the SJ Games Raid |date=1994-10-12 |publisher=Steve Jackson Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Raid==
In October 1988, [[Bell South]] became aware that a proprietary document relating to its [[9-1-1]] system had been posted on a [[bulletin board system]] (BBS) in Illinois.&lt;ref name="tex435"/&gt; This was reported to the Secret Service in July 1989.&lt;ref name="tex435"&gt;816 F.Supp. 432 (1993) 435&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1990 Secret Service found that the document had been posted on the "Phoenix" BBS in Austin, Texas, which was operated by [[Loyd Blankenship]], who was at the time employed by SJG and moderator of the company's own BBS, "Illuminati".&lt;ref name="tex435"/&gt; The Secret Service believed there was [[probable cause]] to search computers belonging to Blankenship and his employer, and a [[search warrant]]  was issued on February 28.&lt;ref&gt;816 F.Supp. 432 (1993) 436&lt;/ref&gt;

The Secret Service executed the warrant on SJG on 1 March 1990.&lt;ref name="tex437"&gt;816 F.Supp. 432 (1993) 437&lt;/ref&gt; Three SJG computers were seized, along with over 300 [[floppy disk]]s.&lt;ref name="tex437"/&gt; Among these was  the master copy of ''[[GURPS Cyberpunk]]'', a [[role-playing game]] written by Blankenship which SJG was about to release.&lt;ref name="tex438t9"&gt;816 F.Supp. 432 (1993) 438–439&lt;/ref&gt; The "Illuminati" server included private personal emails to and from SJG employees.&lt;ref&gt;816 F.Supp. 432 (1993) 441&lt;/ref&gt; The material was returned in June 1990.&lt;ref&gt;816 F.Supp. 432 (1993) 435, 439&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
SJG sued the Secret Service for damages arising from loss of revenue while the computers were in its custody.&lt;ref name="tex438t9"/&gt; [[Steve Jackson (American game designer)|Steve Jackson]] and three other employees also sued for invasion of privacy, claiming the seizures were illegal under the [[Privacy Protection Act of 1980]], [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act]] and [[Stored Communications Act]].&lt;ref name="tex434"&gt;816 F.Supp. 432 (1993) 434&lt;/ref&gt;  Loyd Blankenship was not party to the suits.&lt;ref&gt;816 F.Supp. 432 (1993) 432&lt;/ref&gt; The case came to trial in 1993 in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Texas|Western Texas District Court]].&lt;ref&gt;816 F.Supp. 432 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; SJG was represented by the Austin firm of George, Donaldson &amp; Ford, while the lead counsel was Pete Kennedy.  SJG won two out of the three counts and was awarded $50,000 in [[statutory damages]] and $250,000 in [[attorney's fees]].&lt;ref name="tex438t9"/&gt; No [[compensatory damages]] were awarded.&lt;ref name="tex438t9"/&gt; The judge said that Steve Jackson had little involvement in SJG at the time of the raid, and the company was close to [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]], and that Jackson's renewed involvement in the wake of the raid had turned the company's fortunes around.&lt;ref name="tex438t9"/&gt;  The judge reprimanded the Secret Service, calling their warrant preparation "sloppy",&lt;ref name="tex437"/&gt; suggesting that they needed "better education" regarding relevant statutes,&lt;ref&gt;816 F.Supp. 432 (1993) 444&lt;/ref&gt; and finding that they had no basis to suspect SJG of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="tex435"/&gt; The third count dealing with interception of e-mail was upheld in October 1994 by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref name="app458"&gt;36 F.3d 457 (1994) 458&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] was an [[amicus curiae]] at the appeal.&lt;ref name="app458"/&gt;

Although the raid was not a part of [[Operation Sundevil]], this law enforcement effort, which spanned two years, has a tarnished image owing to a lack of successful prosecutions and questionable procedures.&lt;ref name="ripco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.eff.org/legal/cases/SJG/?f=ripco_case_closed.article.txt|title="Operation Sundevil" is finally over for Dr. Ripco|author=Bruce Esquibel|date=1994-10-08|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-03-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810225717/http://w2.eff.org/legal/cases/SJG/?f=ripco_case_closed.article.txt|archivedate=2011-08-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''GURPS Cyberpunk'' book lists "Unsolicited Comments: The United States Secret Service" on its credits page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Loyd Blankenship]]|title= [[GURPS Cyberpunk]] |publisher= [[Steve Jackson Games]] |year= 1990 |isbn= 1-55634-168-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4733">'''Sunil Kumar Lahoria''' (about 1961 – February 2013 [[Navi Mumbai]]) was a builder from [[Mumbra]], [[Thane district]], India who was killed in February, 2013 after reporting about illegal buildings. This occurred about a year and a half before the collapse of an illegal building in [[2013 Thane building collapse|Thane on 4 April 2013]], killing 74 people.&lt;ref name=TOI&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-04-10/mumbai/38433304_1_cidco-raigad-palm-beach-road | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130629121701/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-04-10/mumbai/38433304_1_cidco-raigad-palm-beach-road | dead-url=yes | archive-date=29 June 2013 | title=Lahoria's expose of illegal buildings led to murder? | date=10 April 2013 | agency=Times of India | accessdate=10 April 2013 | author=Vijay Singh, TNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illegal buildings==
{{main|Illegal housing in India}}
In 2011, Lahoria informed municipal and state authorities that within [[Navi Mumbai]] there were more than 600 [[Illegal housing in India|illegal buildings]]. He also filed a writ petition in the [[Bombay High Court]]. Construction of the buildings also violated floor space index (FSI) rules, including development of additional storeys.&lt;ref name=TOI /&gt;

21 towers on Palm Beach Road were included in the count of 600 illegal buildings. According to [[Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation]]'s (NMMC) [[urban planning|town planning]] officer, Prakash Thakur: one of the towers is being investigated by the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority and action has been taken on 20 towers.&lt;ref name=TOI /&gt;

In addition to the complaints to governmental authorities and the court, he also questioned [[City and Industrial Development Corporation|CIDCO]] and [[Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation]]'s (NMMC) role in allowing the construction to occur.&lt;ref name="TOI Gunmen kill builder"/&gt; 

Starting the latter half of 2011, about six months before Lahoria's murder, he received death threats from builders with criminal connections. Although protection was requested of the Navi Mumbai police, he never received it.&lt;ref name="TOI Gunmen kill builder"/&gt;

==Death==
In February 2013, Lahoria sustained five bullet wounds and a slash to his hand and neck outside of S K Brothers Builders &amp; Developers' Office, his real estate company in [[Navi Mumbai]]. The two men who shot him wore private security guard uniforms, one of whom knocked a coconut into his head after he had fallen to the ground. Intending to perform a mock funeral, the men had 'agarbattis' and a garland with them&lt;ref name=TOI /&gt;&lt;ref name="TOI Gunmen kill builder"/&gt;

Having seen the incident, two workers in Lahoria's office chased the men. They were able to catch one of the men, a hitman named Venkatesh Shettiyar, who was placed in police custody. The victim's son, Sunny Kumar, claimed that the names of "two prominent developers" had been given by the captured gunman; on the other hand, the gunman told police that he committed the murder because he had not been paid a large commission.&lt;ref name="TOI Gunmen kill builder"/&gt; 

Anurag Garg and Suresh Bijlani, both still escaping [[incarceration]], are [[suspect]]s in his murder.&lt;ref name=TOI /&gt;&lt;ref name="TOI Gunmen kill builder"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-02-17/mumbai/37144441_1_navi-mumbai-murder-case-cidco | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130629124201/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-02-17/mumbai/37144441_1_navi-mumbai-murder-case-cidco | dead-url=yes | archive-date=29 June 2013 | title=Gunmen kill builder, hold mock funeral | publisher=Times of India | date=17 February 2013 | accessdate=9 April 2013 | author=Vijay Singh, TNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lahoria's son, Sandeep Kumar has continued his father's crusade to mitigate illegal buildings. He has also written to the state [[Director General of Police]] and the [[Prime Minister's Office (India)|Prime Minister]]'s Office about the handling of his father's murder investigation. He called out two specific Navi Mumbai senior policemen and questioned the easy treatment of the suspects, including not seizing their [[passport]]s.&lt;ref name=TOI /&gt; Of his father, he said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;My father paid a very heavy price for exposing irregularities that took place with the active involvement of government officers. He made use of the [[Right to Information Act]] to deal with corruption, but he was killed.&lt;ref name=TOI /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''[[Tax]]es in [[Uruguay]]''' are collected by the General Taxation Directorate ({{lang-es|[[Dirección General Impositiva]]}}, DGI).

A major tax reform bill came into force on 1 July 2007 with the number 18083.&lt;ref name="Ley 18083"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pwc.com.uy/en/free-zones/uruguay.jhtml |title=Uruguayan government drafts major tax reform bill |publisher=[[PwC]] |accessdate=2014-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, something important remained: Uruguay applies the source principle, with investments located and activities performed outside Uruguay remaining untouched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pkf.com/media/131863/doing%20business%20in%20uruguay.pdf |title=Doing Business In Uruguay |publisher=PKF |accessdate=2014-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Tax rates==
* [[Value added taxes]] (VAT): basically 18%, but some goods (pharmaceutical, etc.) are taxed with 10%, and fruits and vegetables are not taxed. As of August 2014, the Financial Inclusion Law ({{lang-es|Ley de Inclusión Financiera}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inclusionfinanciera.uy/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2014-04-Ley-19.210-Inclusi%C3%B3n-Financiera.pdf |title=Financial Inclusion Law |publisher=[[Parliament of Uruguay]] |accessdate=2014-09-21}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;) established a 4% tax deduction for sales with [[debit card]]s and 2% for [[credit card]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatlive.com/americas/uruguay-cuts-vat-rate-bank-card-purchases/ |title=Uruguay cuts VAT rate on electronic purchases |publisher=VAT Live |accessdate=2014-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Corporate tax]]: it used to be 30%, since 2007 it was lowered to 25%, but special dispositions can bring this to 33%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-Uruguay/Local%20Assets/Documents/Perfil%20de%20Inversiones.pdf |title=Uruguay: Tax and Investment Profile |publisher=[[Deloitte]] |year=2012 |accessdate=2014-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Income tax|Individual income tax]]: Since 2007&lt;ref name="Ley 18083"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=18083&amp;Anchor= |title=Tax system in Uruguay |publisher=[[Parliament of Uruguay]] |accessdate=2014-09-21 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is a progressive scale of taxation, with a non-taxable minimum. The [[payroll tax]] is part of the same tax scheme.
* [[Wealth tax]]: There is a non-taxable minimum which leaves the big majority of Uruguayans out of this duty. A progressive scale of taxation ranges from 0.7% to 2.75%.

==Other taxes==
* The Schools Tax ({{lang-es|Impuesto de Enseñanza Primaria}}) taxing urban rural estate is collected by the National Administration of Public Education.
* Regional administrations in the country can establish, collect and control certain taxes through their respective Departmental Councils. The most significant local taxes include the Real Estate Tax, Vehicle Registration Fee and the Food Analysis Tax.

The '''Telecoms Package''' was the review of the European Union Telecommunications Framework from 2007 – 2009. The objective of the review was to update the EU Telecoms Framework of 2002 and to create a common set of regulations for the telecoms industry across all 27 EU member states. The review consisted of a package of directives addressing the regulation of service provision, access, interconnection, users' contractual rights and users' privacy, as well as a Regulation creating a new European regulatory body (BEREC).

The update to the telecoms regulations was needed to address the growth of broadband Internet. It was intended merely to address structural regulation and competitive issues concerning the broadband providers and the provision of spectrum. The Telecoms Package created a new pan-European agency called [[Body of European Regulators of Electronic Communications]] (BEREC) overseeing telecoms regulation in the Member States. It provided for Member States to set minimum quality of service levels for broadband network transmission. It harmonised European contractual rights for telephone and Internet subscribers. These rights included the ability to switch telephone operators within 24 hours of giving notice, and retaining the phone number. Broadband and phone providers are obligated to limit the contract term to 12 months. Subscribers are to be notified of data privacy breaches.

The Telecoms Package became subject to several political controversies, including disputes over the provision of access to infrastructure by dominant broadband providers. However, the most significant controversies concerned copyright and net neutrality.

The controversy over copyright arose because of an attempt to put in amendments mandating Internet Service Providers to enforce copyright. It was argued that these amendments sought to implement a three strikes regime. There was a public political argument over this matter. The debate eventually centred on one single counter-amendment, known as Amendment 138. The outcome was that the Package was forced to go to three readings in the European Parliament, and a compromise amendment was drafted, with the agreement of the three European institutions – Parliament, Commission and Council. This compromise amendment is sometimes now known as the 'Freedom provision'.

The [[net neutrality]] controversy arose out of changes made to transparency requirements for broadband providers, where, it was argued, those changes could permit the providers to alter quality of service or favour or discriminate against other players.

The Telecoms Package is known in German as "Telekom-Paket", in French as "Paquet Telecom", in Spanish as "Paquete Telecom", and in Swedish as "Telekompaketet".

==Legislative history==
The legislation that comprises the Telecoms Package, as published in the European Union Official Journal is:

[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:0037:0069:EN:PDF Directive 2009/140/EC] (Framework, Authorisation and Access directives)

[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:0011:0036:EN:PDF Directive 2009/136/EC](Universal services and E-privacy directives)

[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:0001:0010:EN:PDF Regulation No 1211/2009] establishing the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC)

The Telecoms Package was presented by [[Viviane Reding]], the European Commissioner for Information Society, to the [[European Parliament]] in Strasbourg 13 November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/07/1677&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en Commission proposes a single European Telecoms Market for 500 million consumers], Commission press release, IP/07/1677&lt;/ref&gt;

The draft legislation that was presented to the European Parliament was:

[http://www.ipex.eu/IPEXL-WEB/dossier/document.do?code=COM&amp;year=2007&amp;number=697&amp;extension=FIN Proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directives 2002/21/EC] on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services, 2002/19/EC on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and services, and 2002/20/EC on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services

[http://www.ipex.eu/IPEXL-WEB/dossier/files/download/082dbcc530b1bf490130bb9ac3273f74.do Proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2002/22/EC] on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks, Directive 2002/58/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 on consumer protection cooperation

[http://www.ipex.eu/IPEXL-WEB/dossier/document.do?code=COM&amp;year=2007&amp;number=699&amp;extension=FIN Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Electronic Communications Market Authority]

The Telecoms Package went through three readings in the European Parliament. The First Reading concluded on 24 September 2008. The Second Reading concluded on 5 May 2009. The Third Reading, also known as the Conciliation process, concluded at midnight on 5 November 2009.

The entire Package was finally adopted by a majority vote in the European Parliament on 24 November 2009. This was however, a legal technicality. The critical policy issues had already been decided during the three Readings.

The Telecoms Package entered into European law on 18 December 2009 (the date on which it was published in the Official Journal), after which member states had 18 months to implement its provisions in national law.

== Copyright and The Telecoms Package ==
The Telecoms Package was a complex piece of legislation. It was intended to update many aspects of telecoms regulation. It combined earlier directives from 2002 into two new bundles. The Framework, Access and Authorisation directives from 2002, were put into one new directive. The Universal Services and e-Privacy directives, also from 2002, were bundled together into another new directive.

In the European Commission's draft of 13 November 2007, there were two amendments that attempted to insert support for copyright, notably that EU Member States should mandate their broadband providers to co-operate with rights-holders and favouring a 'three strikes' or graduated response regime. These two amendments were Annex 1, point 19 of the Authorisation directive and Amendment 20.6 of the Universal Services directive.&lt;ref name="Horten, M, "&gt;[http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?PID=526246 Horten, M, The Copyright Enforcement Enigma – Internet Politics and the Telecoms Package], , page 124.&lt;/ref&gt; They sparked a major political controversy over the enforcement of copyright on the Internet.

The copyright controversy became public during the first reading of European Parliament. It came to dominate the political debate, and was the subject of a vocal activist campaign led by [[La Quadrature du Net]]. It was only resolved during the Third Reading, when the European Parliament drafted a new provision that reminded Member State governments of their obligations under the European Convention of Human Rights, notably the right to due process.

===Amendment 138===
The famous (or infamous) Amendment 138 was tabled to highlight the problem of copyright and with the aim of stopping a three strikes regime being legitimated in European Union legislation.

Amendment 138 was an amendment tabled to the Framework directive, that sought to mandate a judicicial ruling in cases where Internet access would be cut off. It was deliberately framed to target other proposals for copyright measures – the so-called '3 strikes'.
The text of amendment 138 was:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P6-TA-2008-0449&amp;language=EN&amp;ring=A6-2008-0321 European Parliament Texts Adopted 24 September 2008.] Amendment 138 is Article 8.4h.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“ applying the principle that no restriction may be imposed on the fundamental rights and freedoms of end-users, without a prior ruling by the judicial authorities, notably in accordance with Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union on freedom of expression and information, save when public security is threatened in which case the ruling may be subsequent.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Amendment 138 was adopted by the European Parliament in the First Reading plenary vote on 24 September 2008. This created an inter-institutional stand-off between the Parliament on the one hand, and the Commission and the Council of Ministers, on the other.

In the Second Reading, on 5 May 2009, the European Parliament again voted for Amendment 138.

In the Third Reading, the only issue under discussion was Amendment 138 and how to handle the copyright issue. A compromise provision was finally agreed by all three EU institutions at midnight on 4 November 2009. This provision is Article 1.3a of the Framework directive. It is sometimes known as the 'Freedom Provision'.

The text of Article 1.3a (the so-called "Freedom Provision") is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"3a. Measures taken by Member States regarding end-users access’ to, or use of, services and applications through electronic communications networks shall respect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms
and general principles of Community law.

Any of these measures regarding end-users’ access to, or use of, services and applications through electronic communications
networks liable to restrict those fundamental rights or freedoms may only be imposed if they are appropriate, proportionate and necessary within a democratic society, and their implementation shall be subject to adequate procedural safeguards in conformity with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and with general principles of Community law, including effective judicial protection and due process. Accordingly, these measures may only be taken with due respect for the principle of the presumption of innocence and the right to privacy. A prior, fair and impartial procedure shall be guaranteed, including the right to be heard of the person or persons concerned, subject to the need for appropriate conditions and procedural arrangements in duly substantiated cases of urgency in conformity with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The right to effective and timely judicial review shall be guaranteed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:0037:0069:EN:PDF Directive 2009/140/EC, Article 1.3a].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Net Neutrality and the Telecoms Package==
The Telecoms Package contained provisions that concerned net neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomsburyacademic.com/view/NetNeutrality_9781849662192/book-ba-9781849662192.xml Marsden, C Net Neutrality: Towards a Co-regulatory Solution.] See Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; These provisions related to transparency of information supplied by network operators and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to their subscribers. They can be found in Article 20 and 21 of the Universal Services directive.

These two Articles were subject to considerable lobbying by the telecoms network operators, who wanted to retain the flexibility to run the networks to suit their business requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&amp;context=research Horten, M Where Copyright Enforcement and Net Neutrality Collide – How the EU Telecoms Package Supports Two Corporate Political Agendas for the Internet], in American University College of Law Program on Information Justice and Intellectual Property PIJIP Research Paper Series 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of their demands were criticised by citizens advocacy groups&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laquadrature.net/files/LaQuadratureduNet-DOSSIER_Protecting_Net_Neutrality_in_Europe.pdf La Quadrature du Net dossier on Net Neutrality and the Telecoms Package]&lt;/ref&gt;
, who argued that certain proposed amendments would allow the broadband operators to use discriminatory forms of traffic management. The outcome was a strange wording in the text:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"inform subscribers of any change to conditions limiting access to and/or use of services and applications, where such conditions are permitted under national law in accordance with Community law";&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:0011:0036:EN:PDF Directive 2009/136/EC] Universal services directive, see Article 20, point 1(b) second bullet.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Telecoms Package was a target for lobbying by American telecoms companies, notably AT&amp;T and Verizon, seeking to get the ability to use sophisticated traffic management techniques on broadband networks embedded into European law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/08/technology/08iht-neutral.1.20669185.html U.S. lobbyists angle for influence in Europe's Net neutrality debate], The New York Times, retrieved 6 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erikjosefsson.eu/sites/default/files/VON_Europe__Blocking_of_VoIP_applications_by_mobile_operators__final.doc VON Coalition Europe] {{Webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20141122033905/http%3A//www.erikjosefsson.eu/sites/default/files/VON_Europe__Blocking_of_VoIP_applications_by_mobile_operators__final.doc |date=22 November 2014 }}, The Voice on the Net (VON) Coalition Europe was launched in December 2007, press release retrieved 6 April 2009 from external website

'''Torrentz''' was a [[Finland]]-based [[metasearch engine]] for [[BitTorrent]], run by an individual known as Flippy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://whois.domaintools.com/torrentz.eu |title = torrentz.eu – Torrent Search Engine |publisher = 2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It indexed [[torrent file|torrent]]s from various major torrent websites, and offered compilations of various trackers per torrent that were not necessarily present in the default [[torrent file|.torrent]] file, so that when a tracker was down, other trackers could do the work. It was the second most popular torrent website in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://torrentfreak.com/top-10-most-popular-torrent-sites-of-2012-120107/ |title = Top 10 Most Popular Torrent Sites of 2012 |publisher = Torrentfreak.com |date = 2012-01-07 |accessdate = 2012-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
Torrentz's [[user interface]] was simple; it had only a user menu and a search panel. Users were not required to register before searching files.

To perform a search, users would simply type in a string of keywords within the [[autocomplete]]-enabled search field and execute the search by either pressing the search button in the UI or the [[enter key]] on the [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]]. From there, a list of matching torrent files were displayed on the screen for the user to choose from. This list could be filtered by age (one day, three days, one week or one month) and by "safety &amp; quality" ("any", "good" or "verified").{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} The "good" filter was applied by default, and "verified" was reserved for torrents uploaded by well-known groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Torrentz Introduces Verified Torrents and More New Features |url = http://torrentfreak.com/torrentz-new-features-and-verified-torrents-080129/ |author = Ernesto |date = 29 January 2008 |work = [[TorrentFreak]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selecting a torrent from the search results list would take the user to another page listing the websites currently hosting the specified torrent (with which users would download files). As Torrentz used meta-search engines, users would be redirected to other torrent sites to download content (commonly [[KickassTorrents]], which was considered safe to use).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}
== History ==
In November 2008, [[confidence trick|scammers]] using fake papers attempted to take over the torrentz.com domain. As a backup, the site administrator set up the domain torrentz.eu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://torrentfreak.com/torrentz-faces-hostile-domain-takeover-081105/ |title = Torrentz Faces Hostile Domain Takeover |publisher = Torrentfreak.com |date = 2008-11-05 |accessdate = 2011-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After December 18, 2010, torrentz.eu became the site's default domain, due to the domain name seizures carried out by US authorities on various torrent websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://torrentfreak.com/bittorrent-domain-exodus-continues-as-torrentz-dumps-com-101218/ |title = Torrentz dumps .com |publisher = Torrentfreak.com |date = 2010-12-18 |accessdate = 2011-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Paramount Pictures]] sent a [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] claim to [[Google Search|Google]] to remove the Torrentz homepage and two other pages from its search engine. Torrentz counter-claimed on this request, claiming that the links did not infringe any copyright policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Paramount Censors Torrentz’s Torrentless Homepage from Google |url=http://torrentfreak.com/paramount-censors-torrentzs-torrentless-homepage-from-google-130315/ |publisher=TorrentFreak |date=15 March 2013 |accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 May 2014, Torrentz had its [[domain name]] suspended without a court order&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Registrars Can’t Hold ‘Pirate’ Domains Hostage Without Court Order |url=http://torrentfreak.com/registrars-cant-hold-pirate-domains-hostage-without-court-order-140110/ |publisher=TorrentFreak |date=10 January 2014 |accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.easydns.org/2013/10/08/whatever-happened-to-due-process/ |title=Whatever Happened to "Due Process" ? |date=8 October 2013 |publisher=easyDNS |accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; following a request from the [[Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit]]. A day later, the suspension of torrentz.eu was lifted. The website had three alternative domains (.me, .ch and .in) and hoped to move the .eu domain to a new registrar. All of these domains have since been blocked within the UK by [[BSkyB|Sky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://torrentfreak.com/torrentz-eu-domain-suspended-uk-police-request-140526/|title=Torrentz.eu Domain suspended after UK Police request |publisher=TorrentFreak |date=26 May 2014 |accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://torrentfreak.com/torrentz-eu-domain-unsuspended-back-action-140527/ |title=Torrentz.eu Domain Unsuspended and Back In Action |date=27 May 2014 |publisher=TorrentFreak |accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 5, 2016, Torrentz was shut down by its operators with the message "Torrentz will always love you. Farewell." displayed; it operated for over 13 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://torrentfreak.com/torrentz-shuts-down-largest-torrent-meta-search-engine-says-farewell-160805/ "Torrentz Shuts Down, Largest Torrent Meta-Search Engine Says Farewell"]. TorrentFreak August 5, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clones==
In August 2016, a few days after Torrentz shut down, an unofficial clone of Torrentz - Torrentz2.eu - was launched that initially indexed 60 million torrents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/torrentz-eu-clone-website-goes-online-2964137/ Torrentz2.eu clone rises to take place of earlier website] August 10, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, another unofficial clone -  torrentzeu.to - was launched that initially indexed 30 million torrents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techtimes.com/articles/174475/20160822/new-torrentz-clone-appears-alternative-mirror-site-includes-pirate-bay-and-extratorrent-searches.htm New Torrentz Clone Appears: Alternative Mirror Site Includes Pirate Bay And Extratorrent Searches] Tech Times&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Treaty of Simulambuco''' was signed in 1885 by representatives of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] government and officials in the [[N'Goyo]] Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unpo.org/content/view/2744/99/|title=UNPO: UNPO Resolution Concerning the Cabinda Enclave|website=www.unpo.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shillington K., Encyclopedia of African history, Volume 1, p197 {{ISBN|978-1-57958-245-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The agreement was drafted and signed in response to the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1885|Treaty of Berlin]], which was an agreement between the colonizing European powers about how to divide up [[Africa]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} The long-established Portuguese, not wanting to miss out on the [[Scramble for Africa]] involving territories near its own old possessions, began to colonize deeper than the numerous trading ports it had controlled on the African coast since the early 16th century. In contrast to the violent struggles between the Portuguese and some native peoples in [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]], the colonization of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] was peaceful.

Portugal first claimed sovereignty over Cabinda in the February 1885 Treaty of Simulambuco,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Right of Self-Determination in the Angolan Enclave of Cabinda|url=http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Workshop/kone98.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which gave Cabinda the status of a protectorate of the [[Portuguese Crown]] under the request of “the princes and governors of Cabinda”.&lt;ref name="Institute"&gt;{{cite web| title=Cabinda.

Cabinda was incorporated into the [[Portuguese Empire]] separately from its larger southern neighbour [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] even though, at the time, the two were separated merely by the [[Congo River]] and a strip of land of Democratic Republic of Congo. In 2005, Cabindans celebrated the 120th anniversary of the treaty, to the annoyance of Angolan officials, who view the treaty as running counter to their claim that the territory is an [[exclave]]. This dispute over the treaty has led to an ongoing [[Cabinda conflict|separatist conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/cabinda.htm#|title=Cabinda|last=Pike|first=John|website=www.globalsecurity.org|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shantz, J.

{{ Civil procedure (United States)}}
'''Voluntary dismissal''' is termination of a [[lawsuit]] by voluntary request of the [[plaintiff]] (the party who originally filed the lawsuit).  A voluntary dismissal with prejudice (meaning the plaintiff is permanently barred from further litigating the same subject matter) is the modern descendant of the [[common law]] procedure known as '''retraxit'''.&lt;ref&gt;''O'Hara v. Teamsters Union Local No. 856'', 151 F.3d 1152 (9th Cir. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, voluntary dismissal in [[United States district court|Federal court]] is subject to Rule 41(a) of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]].  Rule 41(a)'s full text can be found below.  Simply stated, Rule 41(a) allows the plaintiff to make a dismissal as long as the [[defendant]] has not filed an [[answer (law)|answer]] or filed a motion for summary judgment. 

If the defendant has taken such action, dismissal is only proper under two circumstances:

a. all defendants stipulate to dismissal; or

b. the judge overseeing the case rules for the case to be dismissed

Once the case has been voluntarily dismissed, if it is brought to court again a dismissal in this second case will mean the case can never again be brought back to court.

If the defendant has a [[counterclaim]], the case can only be dismissed if the counterclaim can still stand as its own case. 

Full text of Rule 41 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule41.htm Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 41.  Legal Information Institute, Cornell University Law School.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''(a) Voluntary Dismissal: Effect Thereof'''

:(1) ''By Plaintiff; By Stipulation.''  Subject to the provisions of Rule 23(e), of Rule 66, and of any statute of the United States, an action may be dismissed by the plaintiff without order of court (i) by filing notice of dismissal at any time before service by the adverse party of an answer or of a motion for summary judgment, whichever first occurs, or (ii) by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared in the action.  Unless otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal or stipulation, the dismissal is without prejudice, except that a notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits when filed by a plaintiff who has once dismissed in any court of the United States or of any state an action based on or including the same claim.

:(2) ''By Order of Court.''  Except as provided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision of this rule, an action shall not be dismissed at the plaintiff's instance save upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper.  If a counterclaim has been pleaded by a defendant prior to the service upon the defendant of the plaintiff's motion to dismiss, the action shall not be dismissed against the defendant's objections unless the counterclaim can remain pending for independent adjudication by the court.  Unless otherwise specified in the order, a dismissal under this paragraph is without prejudice.

The [[Australian High Court]] decided that [[estoppel]], in certain circumstances could be a cause of action.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Contract |edition=4th |last1=Walker |first1=Campbell |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71770-X|year=2004 |page=70-72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
Maher owned some property with buildings on it in [[Nowra]]. He was negotiating with a department store company called [[Waltons (department store)|Waltons Stores]] (at the time controlled by the [[Bond Corporation]]) for a lease of the land. They wanted an existing building to be demolished and a new one erected.

In reliance on representations made before a contract was completed, Maher demolished the building and started to erect a new one. But the contract never came to completion because Waltons Stores did not sign the lease as Maher had yelled at them and become hostile towards them. Waltons told their solicitors to slow the deal while they did further investigations as to whether the transaction would be good business, but allowed Maher to remain under the impression that the deal would be completed.

==Judgment==
The High Court held that to avoid detriment through Waltons' unconscionable behaviour, Waltons was estopped from denying the contract. Whilst the mere exercise of legal right not to exchange contracts was not unconscionable, there were two additional elements which made Waltons' conduct unconscionable: a) element of  urgency, b) Maher executed and forwarded on 11/11 and assumed execution by Walton was a formality. The award (though very similar to an expectation interest, as if it were a contract that was enforced) was only meant to cover reliance. Because Maher had acted to his detriment, in reliance on the encouragement of Walton Stores, which had acted unconscionably, equity would intervene.

[[Anthony Mason (judge)|Mason CJ]] and Wilson J said the following

{{Cquote|27. But there are differences between a contract and an equity created by estoppel. A contractual obligation is created by the agreement of the parties; an equity created by estoppel may be imposed irrespective of any agreement by the party bound. A contractual obligation must be supported by consideration; an equity created by estoppel need not be supported by what is, strictly speaking, consideration. The measure of a contractual obligation depends on the terms of the contract and the circumstances to which it applies; the measure of an equity created by estoppel varies according to what is necessary to prevent detriment resulting from unconscionable conduct.

28. In ''[[Combe v Combe]]'' Denning L.J. limited the application of promissory estoppel, as he expounded the doctrine, to ensure that it did not displace the doctrine of consideration. His Lordship's solution of the problem was to hold that the promise should not itself be a cause of action, but merely the foundation of a defensive equity. He said (at p 220):

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Seeing that the principle never stands alone as giving a cause of action in itself, it can never do away with the necessity of consideration when that is an essential part of the cause of action. The doctrine of consideration is too firmly fixed to be overthrown by a side-wind."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

29. The remedy offered by promissory estoppel has been limited to preventing the enforcement of existing legal rights. In ''[[Crabb v Arun District Council]]'' Lord Denning M.R. said, at p 188, that if a person -

&lt;blockquote&gt;" by his words or conduct, so behaves as to lead another to believe that he will not insist on his strict legal rights - knowing or intending that the other will act on that belief - and he does so act, that again will raise an equity in favour of the other; and it is for a court of equity to say in what way the equity may be satisfied."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If the object of the principle were to make a promise binding in equity, the need to preserve the doctrine of consideration would require a limitation to be placed on the remedy. But there is a logical difficulty in limiting the principle so that it applies only to promises to suspend or extinguish existing rights. If a promise by A not to enforce an existing right against B is to confer an equitable right on B to compel fulfilment of the promise, why should B be denied the same protection in similar circumstances if the promise is intended to create in B a new legal right against A? There is no logical distinction to be drawn between a change in legal relationships effected by a promise which extinguishes a right and a change in legal relationships effected by a promise which creates one. Why should an equity of the kind to which Combe v. Combe refers be regarded as a shield but not a sword? The want of logic in the limitation on the remedy is well exposed in Mr David Jackson's essay "Estoppel as a Sword" in (1965) 81 Law Quarterly Review 84,223 at pp 241-243.

34. The foregoing review of the doctrine of promissory estoppel indicates that the doctrine extends to the enforcement of voluntary promises on the footing that a departure from the basic assumptions underlying the transaction between the parties must be unconscionable. As failure to fulfil a promise does not of itself amount to unconscionable conduct, mere reliance on an executory promise to do something, resulting in the promisee changing his position or suffering detriment, does not bring promissory estoppel into play. Something more would be required. Humphreys Estate suggests that this may be found, if at all, in the creation or encouragement by the party estopped in the other party of an assumption that a contract will come into existence or a promise will be performed and that the other party relied on that assumption to his detriment to the knowledge of the first party.}}
