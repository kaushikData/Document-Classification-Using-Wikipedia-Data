'''[[Capacitor]]s''' have many uses in electronic and electrical systems. They are so ubiquitous that it is rare that an electrical product does not include at least one for some purpose.

== Energy storage ==
[[File:Flash.JPG|thumb|right|Energy storage capacitor for [[camera flash]] in a vintage [[Instant camera|Polaroid]]]]
A capacitor can store electric energy when it is connected to its charging circuit. And when it is disconnected from its charging circuit, it can dissipate that stored energy, so it can be used like a temporary [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. Capacitors are commonly used in electronic devices to maintain power supply while batteries are being changed. (This prevents  loss of information in volatile memory.)

Conventional electrostatic capacitors provide less than 360 [[joule]]s per kilogram of energy density, while capacitors using developing technology can provide more than 2.52 [[Kilo-|kilo]][[joule]]s per kilogram.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cleantech.com/news/4278/next-gen-car-solution-capacitor Next-gen car solution? Scientists expand uses for electrostatic capacitor] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429070618/http://cleantech.com/news/4278/next-gen-car-solution-capacitor |date=April 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[car audio]] systems, large capacitors store energy for the [[amplifier]] to use on demand. 

An [[uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) can be equipped with maintenance-free capacitors to extend [[service life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.industrial-europe.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=210602105&amp;cid=NL_industrialeu industrial-europe.com]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pulsed power and weapons ==
Groups of large, specially constructed, low-[[inductance]] high-voltage capacitors (''capacitor banks'') are used to supply huge pulses of current for many [[pulsed power]] applications. These include [[electromagnetic forming]], [[Marx generator]]s, pulsed [[laser]]s (especially [[TEA laser]]s), [[pulse forming network]]s, [[Fusion power|fusion]] research, and [[particle accelerator]]s.

Large capacitor banks (reservoirs) are used as energy sources for the [[exploding-bridgewire detonator]]s or [[slapper detonator]]s in [[nuclear weapon]]s and other specialty weapons. Experimental work is under way using banks of capacitors as power sources for [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] [[Vehicle armour|armour]] and electromagnetic [[railgun]]s or [[coilgun]]s.

== Power conditioning ==

Reservoir capacitors are used in power supplies where they smooth the output of a full or half wave rectifier. They can also be used in charge pump circuits as the energy storage element in the generation of higher voltages than the input voltage.

Capacitors are connected in parallel with the DC power circuits of most electronic devices to smooth   current fluctuations for signal or control circuits. Audio equipment, for example, uses several capacitors in this way, to shunt away power line hum before it gets into the signal circuitry. The capacitors act as a local reserve for the DC power source, and bypass AC currents from the power supply. This is used in car audio applications, when a stiffening capacitor compensates for the inductance and resistance of the leads to the lead-acid car battery.

== Power factor correction ==
In electric power distribution, capacitors are used for power factor correction. Such capacitors often come as three capacitors connected as a three phase Electrical load.Usually, the values of these capacitors are given not in farads but rather as a reactive power in volt-amperes reactive (VAr). The purpose is to counteract inductive loading from devices like Induction motor,electric motors and transmission lines to make the load appear to be mostly resistive. Individual motor or lamp loads may have capacitors for power factor correction, or larger sets of capacitors (usually with automatic switching devices) may be installed at a load center within a building or in a large utility electrical substation. In high-voltage direct current transmission systems, power factor correction capacitors may have tuning inductors to suppress harmonic currents that would otherwise be injected into the AC power system.

== Suppression and coupling ==

=== Signal coupling ===
{{main|Capacitive coupling}}
Because capacitors pass AC but block DC [[Signal (information theory)|signals]] (when charged up to the applied DC voltage), they are often used to separate the AC and DC components of a signal. This method is known as ''AC coupling'' or "capacitive coupling". Here, a large value of capacitance, whose value need not be accurately controlled, but whose [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]] is small at the signal frequency, is employed.

=== Decoupling ===
{{main|decoupling capacitor}}
[[File:Capacitors x2y.jpg|thumb|right|Ceramic X2YÂ® decoupling capacitors]]
A decoupling capacitor is a capacitor used to decouple one part of a circuit from another. Noise caused by other circuit elements is shunted through the capacitor, reducing the effect they have on the rest of the circuit. It is most commonly used between the power supply and ground.
An alternative name is ''bypass capacitor'' as it is used to bypass the power supply or other high impedance component of a circuit.

===High-pass and low-pass filters===
{{Further|High-pass filter|Low-pass filter}}

===Noise filters and snubbers===
[[File:GTO-P1180590b.JPG|thumb|right|Heavy-duty snubber capacitor with screw terminals]]
When an inductive circuit is opened, the current through the inductance collapses quickly, creating a large voltage across the open circuit of the switch or relay. If the inductance is large enough, the energy will generate an [[electric spark]], causing the contact points to oxidize, deteriorate, or sometimes weld together, or destroying a solid-state switch. A [[snubber]] capacitor across the newly opened circuit creates a path for this impulse to bypass the contact points, thereby preserving their life; these were commonly found in [[contact breaker]] [[ignition system]]s, for instance. Similarly, in smaller scale circuits, the spark may not be enough to damage the switch but will still [[Spark-gap transmitter|radiate]] undesirable [[radio frequency interference]] (RFI), which a '''filter''' capacitor absorbs. Snubber capacitors are usually employed with a low-value resistor in series, to dissipate energy and minimize RFI. Such resistor-capacitor combinations are available in a single package.

Capacitors are also used in parallel to interrupt units of a high-voltage [[circuit breaker]] in order to equally distribute the voltage between these units. In this case they are called grading capacitors.

In schematic diagrams, a capacitor used primarily for DC charge storage is often drawn vertically in circuit diagrams with the lower, more negative, plate drawn as an arc. The straight plate indicates the positive terminal of the device, if it is polarized (see [[electrolytic capacitor]]).

==Motor starters ==
{{main|motor capacitor}}
[[File:Motor-Start-Capacitor.jpg|thumb|right|A typical motor start capacitor, as can be seen by its black color and can shape]]
In single phase [[Squirrel-cage rotor|squirrel cage]] motors, the primary winding within the motor housing is not capable of starting a rotational motion on the rotor, but is capable of sustaining one. To start the motor, a secondary winding is used in series with a non-polarized ''[[starting capacitor]]'' to introduce a lag in the sinusoidal current through the starting  winding. When the secondary winding is placed at an angle with respect to the primary winding, a rotating electric field is created. The force of the rotational field is not constant, but is sufficient to start the rotor spinning. When the rotor comes close to operating speed, a centrifugal switch (or current-sensitive relay in series with the main winding) disconnects the capacitor. The start capacitor is typically mounted to the side of the motor housing. These are called capacitor-start motors, and have relatively high starting torque.

There are also capacitor-run induction motors which have a permanently connected phase-shifting capacitor in series with a second winding. The motor is much like a two-phase induction motor.

Motor-starting capacitors are typically non-polarized electrolytic types, while running capacitors are conventional paper or plastic film [[dielectric]] types.

5.Signal processing.
The energy stored in  capacitor can be used to represent information, either in binary form, as in [[DRAM]]s, or in analogue form, as in [[analog sampled filter]]s and Charge-coupled device CCDs. Capacitors can be used in [[analog circuit]]s as components of integrators or more complex filters and in [[negative feedback]] loop stabilization. Signal processing circuits also use capacitors to [[integral|integrate]] a current signal.

===Tuned circuits===
[[File:Drehkondensator-sw.jpg|thumb|right|Air gap tuning capacitor]]
Capacitors and [[inductor]]s are applied together in [[RLC circuit|tuned circuits]] to select information in particular frequency bands.  For example, [[radio receiver]]s rely on variable capacitors to tune the station frequency. Speakers use passive analog [[Audio crossover|crossovers]], and analog equalizers use capacitors to select different audio bands.

== Sensing ==
Most capacitors are designed to maintain a fixed physical structure. However, various factors can change the structure of the capacitor; the resulting change in capacitance can be used to [[Sensor|sense]] those factors.

===Changing the dielectric===
The effects of varying the characteristics of the dielectric can also be used for sensing and measurement. Capacitors with an exposed and porous dielectric can be used to measure humidity in air. Capacitors are used to accurately measure the fuel level in [[airplane]]s; as the fuel covers more of a pair of plates, the circuit capacitance increases.

===Changing the distance between the plates===
A capacitor with a flexible plate can be used to measure strain or pressure or [[Load cell|weight]].

Industrial pressure transmitters used for [[process control]] use pressure-sensing diaphragms, which form a capacitor plate of an oscillator circuit. Capacitors are used as the [[sensor]] in [[condenser microphone]]s, where one plate is moved by air pressure, relative to the fixed position of the other plate. Some [[accelerometer]]s use [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS) capacitors etched on a chip to measure the magnitude and direction of the acceleration vector. They are used to detect changes in acceleration, e.g. as tilt sensors or to detect free fall, as sensors triggering [[airbag]] deployment, and in many other applications. Some [[Fingerprint authentication#Fingerprint sensors|fingerprint sensors]] use capacitors.

===Changing the effective area of the plates===
Capacitive touch switches are now used on many consumer electronic products.

==Oscillators==
{{Further|Hartley oscillator}}
[[File:OscillatorSchematic.png|upright|thumb|Example of a simple oscillator that requires a capacitor to function]]
A capacitor can possess spring-like qualities in an oscillator circuit. In the image example, a capacitor acts to influence the biasing voltage at the npn transistor's base. The resistance values of the voltage-divider resistors and the capacitance value of the capacitor together control the oscillatory frequency.

==Hazards and safety==
Capacitors may retain a charge long after power is removed from a circuit; this charge can cause dangerous or even potentially fatal shocks or damage connected equipment. For example, even a seemingly innocuous device such as a disposable camera flash unit powered by a 1.5 volt AA battery contains a capacitor which may be charged to over 300 volts. This is easily capable of delivering a shock. Service procedures for electronic devices usually include instructions to discharge large or high-voltage capacitors. Capacitors may also have built-in discharge resistors to dissipate stored energy to a safe level within a few seconds after power is removed. High-voltage capacitors are stored with the terminals shorted, as protection from potentially dangerous voltages due to dielectric absorption.

Some old, large oil-filled capacitors contain [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs). It is known that waste PCBs can leak into groundwater under landfills. Capacitors containing PCB were labelled as containing "Askarel" and several other trade names. PCB-filled capacitors are found in very old (pre 1975) fluorescent lamp ballasts, and other applications.

High-voltage capacitors may catastrophically fail when subjected to voltages or currents beyond their rating, or as they reach their normal end of life. Dielectric or metal interconnection failures may create arcing that vaporizes dielectric fluid, resulting in case bulging, rupture, or even an explosion. Capacitors used in RF or sustained high-current applications can overheat, especially in the center of the capacitor rolls. Capacitors used within high-energy capacitor banks can violently explode when a short in one capacitor causes sudden dumping of energy stored in the rest of the bank into the failing unit. High voltage vacuum capacitors can generate soft X-rays even during normal operation. Proper containment, fusing, and preventive maintenance can help to minimize these hazards.

High-voltage capacitors can benefit from a pre-charge to limit in-rush currents at power-up of high voltage direct current (HVDC) circuits. This will extend the life off the component and may mitigate high-voltage hazards.

The '''Balli Dam''' is a [[gravity dam]] under construction on the [[Ortasu River]] (a tributary of the [[Hezil River]]) in [[Uludere]] district of [[ÅÄ±rnak Province]], southeast [[Turkey]]. Under contract from Turkey's [[State Hydraulic Works]], construction on the dam began in 2008 and a completion date has not been announced.&lt;ref name=DSIII/&gt;

The reported purpose of the dam is water storage and it can also support an 8.36 MW [[hydroelectric]] power station in the future.&lt;ref name=DSIII&gt;{{cite web|title=DSI 10 REGIONAL OFFICE - Diyarbakir |url=http://www2.dsi.gov.tr/bolge/dsi10/sirnak.htm |publisher=State Hydraulic Works |accessdate=1 August 2013 |language=Turkish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121071858/http://www2.dsi.gov.tr/bolge/dsi10/sirnak.htm |archivedate=21 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another purpose of the dam which has been widely reported in the Turkish press is to reduce the freedom of movement of [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK) militants. Blocking and flooding valleys in close proximity to the IraqâTurkey border is expected to help curb cross-border PKK smuggling and deny caves in which ammunition can be stored.

==Location==

Ballyboodan Ogham Stone lies in an enclosure on the roadside, {{Convert|1.7|km|abbr=on}} south of Knocktopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geograph.ie/photo/206902|title=Geograph:: Ogham stone by side of lane,... (C) Humphrey Bolton|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Ballyboodan Ogham Stone was carved c. AD 700â900. It was rediscovered before 1841, and was knocked down by treasure-seekers. In 1850 the tenant of the land wanted to destroy it as an obstacle to the plough, but luckily it was saved by the landlord, [[Sir Hercules Richard Langrishe, 3rd Baronet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/l/Langrishe_H/life.htm|title=[Sir] Hercules Langrishe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Band saw boxes''' are boxes made out of [[wood]] using only a [[bandsaw]] for cutting them out. The wood may be a solid block, a [[laminated]] block or a log from the woodpile. Whereas most boxes have straight sides and square corners, band saw boxes have virtually no restrictions as to shape. They can be oval, heart-shaped, lizard-shaped, or any shape the maker can think of. Other tools such as [[belt sander]]s and drum sanders can be used to shape and sand the box smooth. Relief cuts are always needed if you are going to make a bandsaw box. If you don't, the box always seems to fall apart. If the bandsaw has a little hitch in it the box usually snaps in two.

There are multiple techniques for constructing band saw boxes.

The primary technique starts by cutting the main shape of the box. Then a 1/8" to 1/4" piece of wood is cut off what is to become the back. The drawer shape is cut within the main shape, which involves cutting through the main body, and the body must be glued back together. Once the drawer shape is cut, the usual technique is to remove 1/8" to 1/4" of material from both the front and rear of the drawer shape to be used as faces. The remaining stock is then reduced or hollowed out to produce a drawer or cavity. The front and rear drawer faces are glued back to the remaining hollowed drawer stock, and the back that was cut off is glued to the main body. A handle can be added to the front of the drawer if desired.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3679">[[File:Abell 1689.jpg|thumb|This image shows the galaxy cluster Abell 1689, with the mass distribution of the dark matter in the gravitational lens overlaid (in purple). The mass in this lens is made up partly of normal (baryonic) matter and partly of dark matter. Distorted galaxies are clearly visible around the edges of the gravitational lens. The appearance of these distorted galaxies depends on the distribution of matter in the lens and on the relative geometry of the lens and the distant galaxies, as well as on the effect of dark energy on the geometry of the Universe.]]

In [[astronomy]] and [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], '''baryonic dark matter''' is [[dark matter]] composed of [[baryon]]s. Only a small proportion of the dark matter in the universe is likely to be baryonic.

==Characteristics==
As "dark matter", baryonic dark matter is undetectable by its emitted [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]], but its presence can be inferred from [[gravity|gravitational]] effects on visible matter.  This form of dark matter is composed of "baryons", heavy subatomic particles such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s and combinations of these, including non-emitting ordinary atoms.

==Presence==
Baryonic dark matter may occur in non-luminous gas or in [[Massive compact halo object|Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects]] (MACHOs) - condensed objects such as [[black hole]]s, [[neutron star]]s, [[white dwarf]]s, very faint [[star]]s, or non-luminous objects like [[planet]]s and [[brown dwarf]]s.

==Estimates of quantity==
The total amount of baryonic dark matter can be inferred from models of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], and observations of the [[cosmic microwave background]]. Both indicate that the amount of baryonic dark matter is much smaller than the total amount of dark matter.

===Big Bang nucleosynthesis===
From the perspective of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, a larger amount of ordinary (baryonic) matter implies a denser early universe, more efficient conversion of matter to [[helium-4]], and less unburned [[deuterium]] remaining. If all of the dark matter in the universe were baryonic, then there would be much less deuterium in the universe than is observed. This could be resolved if more deuterium were somehow generated, but large efforts in the 1970s failed to identify plausible mechanisms for this to occur. For instance, MACHOs, which include, for example, brown dwarfs (bodies of hydrogen and helium with masses less than {{convert|0.08|solar mass|kg|lk=on|abbr=on|disp=or}}), never begin [[nuclear fusion]] of hydrogen, but they do burn deuterium. Other possibilities that were examined include "Jupiters", which are similar to brown dwarfs but have masses &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; {{convert|0.001|solar mass|kg|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} and do not burn anything, and [[white dwarf]]s.&lt;ref name="Jungman"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=G.

'''CHAPS''' is a [[zwitterion]]ic [[surfactant]] used in the laboratory to [[solubility|solubilize]] biological macromolecules such as [[protein]]s. It may be synthesized from [[cholic acid]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hjelmeland|first1=LM|title=A nondenaturing zwitterionic detergent for membrane biochemistry: design and synthesis.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=November 1980|volume=77|issue=11|pages=6368â70|pmid=6935651|doi=10.1073/pnas.77.11.6368|pmc=350285}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is zwitterionic due to its [[quaternary ammonium]] and [[sulfonate]] groups; it is structurally similar to certain [[bile acid]]s, such as [[taurodeoxycholic acid]] and [[taurochenodeoxycholic acid]]. It is used as a non-[[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] detergent in the process of [[protein purification]] and is especially useful in purifying [[membrane protein]]s, which are often sparingly soluble or insoluble in [[aqueous]] solution due to their native [[hydrophobic|hydrophobicity]].&lt;ref name="CladeraRicaud1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cladera|first1=Josep|last2=Ricaud|first2=Jean-Louis|last3=Verde|first3=Joaquim Villa|last4=DuNach|first4=Mireia|title=Liposome Solubilization and Membrane Protein Reconstitution Using Chaps and Chapso|journal=European Journal of Biochemistry|volume=243|issue=3|year=1997|pages=798â804|doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1997.00798.x|pmid=9057848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CHAPS is an abbreviation for 3-[(3-'''ch'''olamidopropyl)dimethyl'''a'''mmonio]-1-'''p'''ropane'''s'''ulfonate. A related detergent, called CHAPSO, has the same basic chemical structure with an additional [[hydroxyl]] [[functional group]]; its full chemical name is 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonate. Both detergents have low light absorbance in the [[ultraviolet]] region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], which is useful for monitoring ongoing [[chemical reaction]]s or [[protein-protein interaction|protein-protein binding]] with [[UV/Vis spectroscopy]].

'''Corundum''' is a [[crystal]]line form of [[aluminium oxide]] ({{chem|Al|2|O|3}}) typically containing traces of [[iron]], [[titanium]], [[vanadium]] and [[chromium]].&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt; It is a [[rock (geology)|rock]]-forming [[mineral]]. It is also a naturally [[transparent material]], but can have different colors depending on the presence of [[Transition metal|transition metal]] impurities in its crystalline structure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gem Corundum|last=Giuliani|first=Gaston|last2=Ohnenstetter|first2=Daniel|last3=Fallick|first3=Anthony E.|last4=Groat|first4=Lee|last5=Fagan|last6=Andrew J|publisher=Mineralogical Association of Canada|year=2014|isbn=978 - 0 - 921294 - 54 - 2|location=Research Gate|pages=37-38|chapter=The Geology and Genesis of Gem Corundum Deposits}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corundum has two primary gem varieties, [[ruby]] and [[sapphire]]. Rubies are red due to the presence of [[chromium]], and sapphires exhibit a range of colors depending on what transition metal is present.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A rare type of sapphire, [[Sapphire#Padparadscha|padparadscha]] sapphire, is pink-orange. 

The name "corundum" is derived from the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word ''Kurundam'', which in turn derives from the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] ''Kuruvinda''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|corundum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of corundum's hardness (pure corundum is defined to have 9.0 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs]] scale), it can scratch almost every other mineral. It is commonly used as an [[abrasive]] on everything from [[sandpaper]] to large tools used in machining metals, plastics, and wood. Some [[Emery (mineral)|emery]] is a mix of corundum and other substances, and the mix is less abrasive, with an average Mohs hardness of 8.0.

In addition to its hardness, corundum has a density of 4.02 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which is unusually high for a transparent mineral composed of the low-[[atomic mass]] elements [[aluminium]] and [[oxygen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galleries.com/minerals/oxides/corundum/corundum.htm The Mineral Corundum]. galleries.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology and occurrence==
[[File:Corindon azulEZ.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Corundum from [[Brazil]], size about {{convert|2|Ã|3|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}.]]
Corundum occurs as a mineral in mica [[schist]], [[gneiss]], and some [[marble]]s in [[metamorphic]] [[terranes]]. It also occurs in low silica [[igneous]] [[syenite]] and [[nepheline syenite]] [[Intrusive rock|intrusive]]s. Other occurrences are as masses adjacent to [[ultramafic]] intrusives, associated with [[lamprophyre]] [[Dike (geology)|dikes]] and as large crystals in [[pegmatite]]s.&lt;ref name=Hurlbut/&gt; It commonly occurs as a [[detrital]] mineral in stream and beach sands because of its hardness and resistance to weathering.&lt;ref name=Hurlbut/&gt; The largest documented single crystal of corundum measured about {{convert|65|*|40|*|40|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and weighed {{convert|152|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM66/AM66_885.pdf| journal = American Mineralogist| volume = 66| pages = 885â907| year= 1981| title= The largest crystals| author = Rickwood, P. C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The record has since been surpassed by certain synthetic boules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ledinside.com/news/2009/4/Rubicon_Technology_Grows_Super_boule_of_200kg_Weight_20090421 Rubicon Technology Grows 200kg "Super Boule"], ''LED Inside'', April 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Corundum for abrasives is mined in Zimbabwe, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Russia, Sri Lanka, and India. Historically it was mined from deposits associated with [[dunite]]s in [[North Carolina]], US and from a [[nepheline syenite]] in [[Craigmont, Ontario]].&lt;ref name=Hurlbut/&gt; [[Emery (mineral)|Emery]]-grade corundum is found on the [[List of islands of Greece|Greek island]] of [[Naxos]] and near [[Peekskill, New York]], US. Abrasive corundum is synthetically manufactured from [[bauxite]].&lt;ref name=Hurlbut/&gt; Four corundum axes dating back to 2500 BCE from the Liangzhou culture have been discovered in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4555235.stm|title=Chinese made first use of diamond|publisher=BBC|date=May 2005|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthetic corundum==
In 1837, [[Marc Antoine Auguste Gaudin|Marc Antoine Gaudin]] made the first synthetic rubies by fusing [[alumina]] at a high temperature with a small amount of [[chromium]] as a pigment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.gem-a.com/media/94808/duroc%20danner%20website.pdf| journal = Journal of Gemmology| volume = 32| pages = 175â178| year = 2011| title = Untreated yellowish orange sapphire exhibiting its natural colour| author = Duroc-Danner, J. M.| doi = 10.15506/jog.2011.32.5.174| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130516231326/http://www.gem-a.com/media/94808/duroc%20danner%20website.pdf| archivedate = 2013-05-16| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1847, [[Jacques-Joseph Ebelmen|Ebelmen]] made white [[Sapphire#Synthetic sapphire|synthetic sapphires]] by fusing [[Aluminum oxide|alumina]] in [[boric acid]]. In 1877 Frenic and Freil made crystal corundum from which small stones could be cut. Frimy and [[Auguste Verneuil]] manufactured artificial ruby by fusing [[Barium fluoride|{{chem|BaF|2}}]] and {{chem|Al|2|O|3}} with a little chromium at temperatures above {{convert|2000|C|0|abbr=on}}. In 1903, Verneuil announced he could produce synthetic rubies on a commercial scale using this [[flame fusion]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/bahadur_handbook_of_precious_stones/page_067|title = Bahadur: a Handbook of Precious Stones|year = 1943|accessdate = 2007-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Verneuil process]] allows the production of flawless single-crystal [[sapphire]]s, [[ruby|rubies]] and other corundum gems of much larger size than normally found in nature. It is also possible to grow gem-quality synthetic corundum by flux-growth and [[hydrothermal synthesis]]. Because of the simplicity of the methods involved in corundum synthesis, large quantities of these crystals have become available on the market causing a significant reduction of price in recent years. Apart from ornamental uses, synthetic corundum is also used to produce mechanical parts (tubes, rods, bearings, and other machined parts), scratch-resistant optics, scratch-resistant [[Watch#Overview|watch]] crystals, instrument windows for satellites and spacecraft (because of its transparency in the ultraviolet to infrared range), and [[laser]] components.

==Structure and physical properties==
[[File:Corundum.png|thumb|250 px|left|Crystal structure of corundum]]
[[File:Corundum-pV.svg|thumb|250 px|right|Molar volume vs. pressure at room temperature.]]
Corundum crystallizes with trigonal symmetry in the space group [[Trigonal crystal system#Crystal classes|''R''{{overline|3}}''c'']] and has the lattice parameters a = 4.75 Ã and c = 12.982 Ã at standard conditions. The unit cell contains six formula units.

The toughness of corundum is sensitive to surface roughness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00638054?no-access=true|title=Effect of machining on fracture toughness of corundum|first1=Farrokh|last1=Farzin-Nia|first2=Terry|last2=Sterrett|first3=Ron|last3=Sirney|publisher=|journal=Journal of Materials Science|volume=25|issue=5|pages=2527â2531|doi=10.1007/bf00638054}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.1976.tb09390.x | volume=59 | title=Fracture-Strength Anisotropy of Sapphire | journal=Journal of the American Ceramic Society | pages=59â61}}&lt;/ref&gt; and crystallographic orientation.&lt;ref name="Fracture of Sapphire"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.1969.tb09199.x | volume=52 | title=Fracture of Sapphire | journal=Journal of the American Ceramic Society | pages=485â491}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be 6-7 MPaÂ·m&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; for synthetic crystals,&lt;ref name="Fracture of Sapphire"/&gt; and ~4 for natural&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.matweb.com/search/datasheet_print.aspx?matguid=c8c56ad547ae4cfabad15977bfb537f1|title=Corundum, Aluminum Oxide, Alumina, 99.9%, Al  2  O  3|website=www.matweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lattice of corundum, the oxygen atoms form a slightly distorted hexagonal close packing, in which two-thirds of the gaps between the octahedra are occupied by aluminum ions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13572">The '''Cryogenic Dark Matter Search''' ('''CDMS''') is a series of experiments designed to directly detect particle [[dark matter]] in the form of [[Weakly interacting massive particles|WIMP]]s. Using an array of semiconductor detectors at [[millikelvin]] temperatures, CDMS has set the most sensitive limits to date on the interactions of WIMP dark matter with terrestrial materials.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} The first experiment, '''CDMS I''', was run in a tunnel under the [[Stanford University]] campus. The current experiment, '''SuperCDMS''', is located deep underground in the [[Soudan Underground Mine State Park|Soudan Mine]] in northern [[Minnesota]].

== Background ==
Observations of the large-scale structure of the universe show that matter is aggregated into very large structures that have not had time to form under the force of their own self-gravitation. It is generally believed that some form of [[missing mass]] is responsible for increasing the gravitational force at these scales, although this mass has not been directly observed. This is a problem; normal matter in space will heat up until it gives off light, so if this missing mass exists, it is generally assumed to be in a form that is not commonly observed on earth.

A number of proposed candidates for the missing mass have been put forward over time. Early candidates included heavy [[baryon]]s that would have had to be created in the [[big bang]], but more recent work on nucleosynthesis seems to have ruled most of these out.&lt;ref name=over&gt;[http://cdms.berkeley.edu/experiment.html "WIMP Dark Matter"], ''CDMSII Overview'', [[University of California, Berkeley]]&lt;/ref&gt; Another candidate are new types of particles known as [[weakly interacting massive particle]]s, or "WIMP"s. As the name implies, WIMPs interact weakly with normal matter, which explains why they are not easily visible.&lt;ref name=over/&gt;

Detecting WIMPs thus presents a problem; if the WIMPs are very weakly interacting, detecting them will be extremely difficult. Detectors like CDMS and similar experiments measure huge numbers of interactions within their detector volume in order to find the extremely rare WIMP events.

== Detection technology ==

The CDMS detectors measure the [[ionization]] and [[phonon]]s produced by every particle interaction in their [[germanium]] and [[silicon]] crystal substrates.&lt;ref name=over/&gt; These two measurements determine the energy deposited in the crystal in each interaction, but also give information about what kind of particle caused the event.  The ratio of ionization signal to phonon signal differs for particle interactions with atomic electrons ("electron recoils") and atomic nuclei ("nuclear recoils").  The vast majority of background particle interactions are electron recoils, while WIMPs (and [[neutrons]]) are expected to produce nuclear recoils.  This allows WIMP-scattering events to be identified even though they are rare compared to the vast majority of unwanted background interactions.

From [[Supersymmetry]], the probability of a spin-independent interaction between a WIMP and a nucleus would be related to the amount of nucleons in the nucleus. Thus, a WIMP would be more likely to interact with a germanium detector than a silicon detector, since germanium is a much heavier element. Neutrons would be able to interact with both silicon and germanium detectors with similar probability. By comparing rates of interactions between silicon and germanium detectors, CDMS is able to determine the probability of interactions being caused by neutrons.

CDMS detectors are disks of germanium or silicon, cooled to millikelvin temperatures by a [[dilution refrigerator]].  The extremely low temperatures are needed to limit thermal noise which would otherwise obscure the phonon signals of particle interactions.  Phonon detection is accomplished with [[superconduction]] [[transition edge sensor|transition edge sensors (TESs)]] read out by [[SQUID]] amplifiers, while ionization signals are read out using a [[Field effect transistors|FET]] amplifier. CDMS detectors also provide data on the phonon pulse shape which is crucial in rejecting near-surface background events.

== History ==

Simultaneous detection of ionization and heat with semiconductors at low temperature was first proposed by [[Blas Cabrera]], [[Lawrence M. Krauss]], and [[Frank Wilczek]].&lt;ref name="Cabrera"&gt;{{Citation |author1=B. Cabrera |authorlink1=Blas Cabrera |author2=L.M. Krauss |authorlink2=Lawrence M. Krauss |author3=F.

CDMS collected WIMP search data in a shallow underground site at [[Stanford University]] through 2002, and has operated (with collaboration from the [[University of Minnesota]]) in the [[Soudan Mine]] since 2003. A new detector, SuperCDMS, with interleaved electrodes, more mass, and even better background rejection is currently taking data at Soudan.

===Results===
On December 17, 2009, the collaboration announced the possible detection of two candidate WIMPs, one on August 8, 2007 and the other on October 27, 2007. Due to the low number of events, the team could exclude false positives from background noise such as [[neutron]] collisions.  It is estimated that such noise would produce two or more events 25% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdms.berkeley.edu/results_summary.pdf "Latest Results in the Search for Dark Matter Thursday, December 17, 2009"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618221140/http://cdms.berkeley.edu/results_summary.pdf |date=June 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polythene absorbers were fitted to reduce any neutron background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cdms.berkeley.edu/public_pics/cryostat_without_detectors.html | title=CDMS cryostat without detectors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 analysis with lower energy thresholds, looked for evidence for low-mass WIMPs (M &lt; 9 GeV).  Their limits rule out hints claimed by a new germanium experiment called [[CoGeNT]] and the long-standing [[DAMA/NaI]], [[DAMA/LIBRA]] annual modulation result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1011.2482v3|version= |title=Results from a Low-Energy Analysis of the CDMS II Germanium Data |author=CDMS Collaboration  |date=21 Apr 2011 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.131302 |pmid= 21517371|volume=106 |issue= 13|pages= 131302|journal=Physical Review Letters |bibcode=2011PhRvL.106m1302A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further analysis of data in Physical Review Letters May 2013, revealed 3 WIMP detections with expected background of 0.7, with masses expected from WIMPs, including neutralinos. There is a 0.19% chance that these are anomalous background noise, giving the result a 99.8% (3 sigma) confidence level. Whilst not conclusive evidence for WIMPs this provides strong weight to the theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=CDMS Collaboration|title=Dark Matter Search Results Using the Silicon Detectors of CDMS II|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=4 May 2013|arxiv=1304.4279|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.251301|bibcode = 2013PhRvL.111y1301A|volume=111|issue=25|pmid=24483735|page=251301}}&lt;/ref&gt; This signal was observed by the CDMS II-experiment and it is called the CDMS Si-signal (sometimes the experiment is also called CDMS Si) because it was observed by the silicon detectors.

SuperCDMS search results from October 2012 to June 2013 were published in June 2014, finding 11 events in the signal region for WIMP mass less than 30 GeV, and set an upper limit for spin-independent cross section disfavoring a recent CoGeNT low mass signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Search for Low-Mass WIMPs with SuperCDMS|date = June 20, 2014|journal = Phys.

==GEODM proposal==
A third generation of SuperCDMS is envisioned,{{r|Cushman2012}} although still in the early planning phase.  GEODM ('''Ge'''rmanium '''O'''bservatory for '''D'''ark '''M'''atter), with roughly 1500&amp;nbsp;kg of detector mass, has expressed interest in the SNOLAB "Cryopit" location.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing the detector mass only makes the detector more sensitive if the unwanted background detections do not increase as well, thus each generation must be cleaner and better shielded than the one before.  The purpose of building in ten-fold stages like this is to develop the necessary shielding techniques before finalizing the GEODM design.

The '''DAMA/LIBRA experiment'''&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
is a [[particle detector]] experiment designed to detect [[dark matter]] using the [[Dark matter#Direct detection experiments|direct detection]] approach, by using a matrix of [[NaI(Tl)]] [[scintillator|scintillation detectors]] to detect dark matter particles in the [[galactic halo]].  The experiment aims to find an annual modulation of the number of detection events, caused by the variation of the velocity of the detector relative to the [[dark matter halo]] as the Earth orbits the Sun. It is located underground at the [[Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso]] in [[Italy]].

It is a follow-on to the [[DAMA/NaI]] experiment which observed an annual modulation signature over 7 annual cycles (1995-2002).

== Detector ==
The detector is made of 25 highly radiopure scintillating [[thallium]]-doped [[sodium iodide]] (NaI(Tl)) crystals placed in a 5 by 5 matrix. Each crystal is coupled to two low background [[photomultiplier]]s. The detectors are placed inside a sealed copper box flushed with highly pure nitrogen; to reduce the natural environmental background the copper box is surrounded by a low background multi-ton shield. In addition, 1 m of concrete, made from the Gran Sasso rock material, almost fully surrounds this passive shield. The installation has a 3-level sealing system which prevents environmental air reaching the detectors. The whole installation is air-conditioned and several operative parameters are continuously monitored and recorded.

DAMA/LIBRA was upgraded in 2008 and in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, after the upgrade in 2010 the experiment entered in its phase 2, with an increase of the set-upâs sensitivity
thanks to the lowering of the energy threshold. The DAMA/LIBRA-phase 2 is in data taking.

This experiment has further confirmed the presence of a model-independent annual modulation effect in the data in 2-6&amp;nbsp;keV range that satisfy all the features expected for a dark matter signal with high statistical significance.

As previously done for DAMA/NaI, careful investigations on absence of any significant systematics or side reaction in DAMA/LIBRA have been quantitatively carried out.&lt;ref name="lib1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==SABRE==
The obvious criticism of the seasonal variation of events recorded in the DAMA/LIBRA experiment is that it is in fact due to some purely seasonal effect unconnected with WIMPs.  Although the deep underground location minimizes temperature swings and other direct sunlight effects, there are annual humidity fluctuations and other non-obvious effects.  At moment, all these criticisms are taken in account by DAMA collaboration in analysis of the experimental data and they have been excluded, as discussed in published results. A repetition of this experiment in the Southern Hemisphere with the variation in phase with DAMA/LIBRA would discount this objection; if on the other hand variation was detected in the Southern Hemisphere that was 6 months out of phase with DAMA/LIBRA, then the seasonal variation objection would be upheld.

Improved versions of DAMA/LIBRA, named SABRE (Sodium-iodide with Active Background REjection) are under construction in two places. One is at LNGS, and the other is in [[Australia]] at the [[Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Australiaâs first dark matter experiment |date=23 October 2014 |first=Glenn Jr. |last=Roberts |journal=Symmetry Magazine |url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/october-2014/australias-first-dark-matter-experiment}}&lt;/ref&gt; a laboratory being constructed 1025&amp;nbsp;m below the surface in a gold mine in [[Stawell, Victoria]]. First results are expected in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://royalsocietyvictoria.org.au/events/the-hunt-for-dark-matter/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Drude model''' of [[electrical conduction]] was proposed in 1900&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Drude |first= Paul|year= 1900 |title= Zur Elektronentheorie der Metalle |url= http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/112485959/PDFSTART |journal= [[Annalen der Physik]] | volume= 306 | issue=3 | pages=566-613 |doi= 10.1002/andp.19003060312|bibcode = 1900AnP...306..566D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Drude |first= Paul |year= 1900 |title= Zur Elektronentheorie der Metalle; II.

The model, which is an application of [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]], assumes that the microscopic behavior of electrons in a solid may be treated classically and looks much like a [[pinball]] machine, with a sea of constantly jittering electrons bouncing and re-bouncing off heavier, relatively immobile positive ions.

The two most significant results of the Drude model are an electronic equation of motion,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\langle\mathbf{p}(t)\rangle = q\left(\mathbf{E}+\frac{\langle\mathbf{p}(t)\rangle\times\mathbf{B}}{m}\right) - \frac{\langle\mathbf{p}(t)\rangle}{\tau},&lt;/math&gt;

and a linear relationship between [[current density]] {{math|'''J'''}} and electric field {{math|'''E'''}},

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \left( \frac{n q^2 \tau}{m} \right) \mathbf{E}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here {{mvar|t}} is the time, {{mvar|â¨pâ©}} is the average momentum per electron and {{mvar|q, n, m}}, and {{mvar|Ï}} are respectively the electron charge, number density, mass, and mean free time between ionic collisions (that is, the mean time an electron has traveled since the last collision). The latter expression is particularly important because it explains in semi-quantitative terms why [[Ohm's law]], one of the most ubiquitous relationships in all of electromagnetism, should be true.&lt;ref group="note" name=":0"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ashcroft|Mermin|1976|pp=6â7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Edward M. Purcell | year = 1965 | title = Electricity and Magnetism | publisher = McGraw-Hill | pages = 117â122 | isbn = 978-0-07-004908-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = David J. Griffiths | year = 1999 | title = Introduction to Electrodynamics | publisher = Prentice-Hall | pages = 289 | isbn =  978-0-13-805326-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model was extended in 1905 by [[Hendrik Antoon Lorentz]] (and hence is also known as the '''DrudeâLorentz model'''){{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} and is a [[Classical physics|classical]] model. Later it was supplemented with the results of quantum theory in 1933 by [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] and [[Hans Bethe]], leading to the [[Free electron model|DrudeâSommerfeld model]].

== Assumptions ==
The Drude model considers the metal to be formed of a mass of positively charged ions from which a number of "free electrons" were detached. These may be thought to have become delocalized when the valence levels of the atom came in contact with the potential of the other atoms.&lt;ref group="note" name=":1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ashcroft|Mermin|1976|pp=2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Drude model neglects any long-range interaction between the electron and the ions or between the electrons. The only possible interaction of a free electron with its environment is via instantaneous collisions. The average time between subsequent collisions of such an electron is {{mvar|Ï}}, and the nature of the collision partner of the electron does not matter for the calculations and conclusions of the Drude model.&lt;ref name=":1" group="note" /&gt;

After a collision event, the velocity (and direction) of the electron only depends on the local temperature distribution and is completely independent of the velocity of the electron before the collision event.&lt;ref name=":1" group="note" /&gt;

== Explanations ==

=== DC field ===
The simplest analysis of the Drude model assumes that electric field {{math|'''E'''}} is both uniform and constant, and that the thermal velocity of electrons is sufficiently high such that they accumulate only an infinitesimal amount of momentum {{math|''d'''''p'''}} between collisions, which occur on average every {{mvar|Ï}} seconds.&lt;ref name=":0" group="note" /&gt;

Then an electron isolated at time {{mvar|t}} will on average have been travelling for time {{mvar|Ï}} since its last collision, and consequently will have accumulated momentum

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\langle\mathbf{p}\rangle= q \mathbf{E} \tau.&lt;/math&gt;

During its last collision, this electron will have been just as likely to have bounced forward as backward, so all prior contributions to the electron's momentum may be ignored, resulting in the expression

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\mathbf{p}\rangle = q \mathbf{E} \tau.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the relations

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\mathbf{p}\rangle = m \langle\mathbf{v}\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = n q \langle\mathbf{v}\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;
results in the formulation of Ohm's law mentioned above:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \left( \frac{n q^2 \tau}{m} \right) \mathbf{E}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Time-varying analysis ===
[[File:DrudeResponse.gif|thumb|300 px|right|Drude response of current density to an AC electric field.]]

The dynamics may also be described by introducing an effective drag force. At time {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''dt''}} the average electron's momentum will be

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\mathbf{p}(t_0+dt)\rangle=\left( 1 - \frac{dt}{\tau} \right) \left(\langle\mathbf{p}(t_0)\rangle + q\mathbf{E}dt\right),&lt;/math&gt;

because, on average, a fraction of {{math|1 â {{sfrac|''dt''|''Ï''}}}} of the electrons will not have experienced another collision, and the ones that have will contribute to the total momentum to only a negligible order.&lt;ref group="note" name=":2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ashcroft|Mermin|1976|pp=|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a bit of algebra and dropping terms of order {{math|''dt''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, this results in the differential equation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\langle\mathbf{p}(t)\rangle = q\mathbf{E} - \frac{\langle\mathbf{p}(t)\rangle}{\tau},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|â¨'''p'''â©}} denotes average momentum and {{mvar|q}} the charge of the electrons. This, which is an inhomogeneous differential equation, may be solved to obtain the general solution of

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\mathbf{p}(t)\rangle = q \tau \mathbf{E}(1-e^{-t/\tau}) + \langle\mathbf{p(0)}\rangle e^{-t/\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

for {{math|''p''(''t'')}}. The [[steady state]] solution, {{math|{{sfrac|''d'' â¨'''p'''â©|''dt''}} {{=}} 0}}, is then

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\mathbf{p}\rangle = q \tau \mathbf{E}.&lt;/math&gt;

As above, average momentum may be related to average velocity and this in turn may be related to current density,

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\mathbf{p}\rangle = m \langle\mathbf{v}\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = n q \langle\mathbf{v}\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

and the material can be shown to satisfy Ohm's law &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \sigma_0 \mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; with a [[Direct current|DC]]-conductivity {{math|''Ï''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_0 = \frac{n q^2 \tau}{m}&lt;/math&gt;

=== AC field ===
[[File:DrudeModelComplexConductivity.png|thumb|300 px|right|Complex conductivity for different frequencies assuming that {{math|''Ï'' {{=}} 10&lt;sup&gt;â5&lt;/sup&gt;}} and that {{math|''Ï''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 1}}.]]
The Drude model can also predict the current as a response to a time-dependent electric field with an angular frequency {{mvar|Ï}}. The complex conductivity turns out to be
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(\omega) = \frac{\sigma_0}{1 + i\omega\tau}= \frac{\sigma_0}{1 + \omega^2\tau^2}- i\omega\tau\frac{\sigma_0}{1 + \omega^2\tau^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here it is assumed that

:&lt;math&gt;E(t) = \Re\left(E_0 e^{i\omega t}\right);&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J(t) = \Re\left(\sigma(\omega) E_0 e^{i\omega t}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Please note, that in other conventions, used by engineers, {{mvar|i}} is replaced by {{mvar|âi}} (or {{mvar|âj}} ) in all equations, which reflects the phase difference with respect to origin, rather than delay at the observation point traveling in time. The imaginary part indicates that the current lags behind the electrical field, which happens because the electrons need roughly a time {{mvar|Ï}} to accelerate in response to a change in the electrical field. Here the Drude model is applied to electrons; it can be applied both to electrons and holes; i.e., positive charge carriers in semiconductors. The curves for {{math|''Ï''(''Ï'')}} are shown in the graph.

If an oscillating sinusoidal electric field with frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is applied to the solid, the negatively charged electrons behave as a plasma that tends to move a distance ''x'' apart from the positively charged background. As a result, the sample is polarized and there will be an excess charge at the opposite surfaces of the sample.

The [[dielectric constant]] of the sample  is expressed as
: &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = \frac {D}{\epsilon_0 E} = 1 + \frac {P}{\epsilon_0 E} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Electric displacement field|electric displacement]] and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the [[polarization density]].

The polarization density is written as
:&lt;math&gt;P(t)=\Re\left(P_0e^{i\omega t}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
and the polarization density with ''n'' electron density is
: &lt;math&gt;P = - n e x&lt;/math&gt;
After a little algebra the relation between polarization density and electric field can be expressed as
: &lt;math&gt;P = - \frac{ne^2}{m\omega^2} E&lt;/math&gt;
The frequency dependent dielectric function of the solid is
: &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(\omega) = 1 - \frac {n e^2}{\epsilon_0m \omega^2}&lt;/math&gt;
At a resonance frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\rm p}&lt;/math&gt;, called the '''plasma frequency''', the dielectric function changes sign from negative to positive and real part of the dielectric function drops to zero.
: &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\rm p} = \sqrt{\frac{n e^2}{\epsilon_0 m}} &lt;/math&gt;
The plasma frequency represents a [[plasma oscillation]] resonance or [[plasmon]]. The plasma frequency can be employed as a direct measure of the square root of the density of valence electrons in a solid. Observed values are in reasonable agreement with this theoretical prediction for a large number of materials.&lt;ref name="Kittel2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Solid State Physics|author=C. Kittel|publisher=Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1953â1976|isbn=978-0-471-49024-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below the plasma frequency, the dielectric function is negative and the field cannot penetrate the sample. Light with angular frequency below the plasma frequency will be totally reflected. Above the plasma frequency the light waves can penetrate the sample.

=== Drude response in real materials ===
The characteristic behavior of a Drude metal in the time or frequency domain, i.e. exponential relaxation with time constant {{mvar|Ï}} or the frequency dependence for {{math|''Ï''(''Ï'')}} stated above, is called Drude response. In a conventional, simple, real metal (e.g. sodium, silver, or gold at room temperature) such behavior is not found experimentally, because the characteristic frequency {{math|''Ï''&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is in the infrared frequency range, where other features that are not considered in the Drude model (such as [[Electronic band structure|band structure]]) play an important role.&lt;ref name="Dressel"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=M. Dressel |author2=M. Scheffler |year=2006|title=Verifying the Drude response|journal=[[Annalen der Physik|Ann. Phys.]]|volume=15|issue=7â8|pages=535â544|doi=10.1002/andp.200510198|bibcode = 2006AnP...518..535D }}&lt;/ref&gt; But for certain other materials with metallic properties, frequency-dependent conductivity was found that closely follows the simple Drude prediction for {{math|''Ï''(''Ï'')}}. These are materials where the relaxation rate {{math|''Ï''&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is at much lower frequencies.&lt;ref name="Dressel"/&gt; This is the case for certain [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped semiconductor]] single crystals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=M. van Exter |author2=D.

== Accuracy of the model ==
Historically, the Drude formula was first derived in an incorrect way, namely by assuming that the charge carriers form a [[Classical physics|classical]] [[ideal gas]]. [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] considered quantum theory and extended the theory to the [[free electron model]], where the carriers follow [[FermiâDirac distribution]]. Amazingly, the conductivity predicted turns out to be the same as in the Drude model, as it does not depend on the form of the electronic speed distribution.

Drude model provides a very good explanation of DC and AC conductivity in metals, the [[Hall effect]], and the [[magnetoresistance]]&lt;ref name=":2" group="note" /&gt; in metals near room temperature. The model also explains partly the [[WiedemannâFranz law]] of 1853. However, it greatly overestimates the electronic heat capacities of metals. In reality, metals and insulators have roughly the same heat capacity at room temperature. The model can also be applied to positive (hole) charge carriers, as demonstrated by the Hall effect.

One note of trivia surrounding the theory is that in his original paper, Drude made a conceptual error, estimating the Lorenz number of Wiedemann-Franz law to be in fact be twice of what it classically should have been, thus making it seem in agreement with the experimental measurement. Another surprise is that the experimental value for the specific heat is about 100 smaller than the classical prediction but this factor cancels out with the mean electronic speed that is actually about 100 times bigger than Drude's calculation.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ashcroft|Mermin|1976|pp=|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1925">'''Duna KÃ¶r''' ({{lang-en|Danube Circle}}) is a Hungarian environmental organization founded in 1984 as a protest body to prevent the construction of the [[GabÄÃ­kovo â Nagymaros Dams]]. Opponents of the dam argued that it would create an environmental disaster that would displace thousands of Hungarians from villages and towns where their families had lived for centuries. Opponents of the regime soon joined this burgeoning environmental protest and by the fall of 1988 the Danube Circle had about 10,000 core followers who actively demonstrated against the dam in the streets of Budapest. These actions mirrored protests earlier in the summer of 1988, in which more than 30,000 people marched in Budapest to express their anger over the Romanian governmentâs plan to bulldoze entire Hungarian villages in Transylvania. Hungary had not seen public protests on this scale since 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chnm.gmu.edu/1989/exhibits/intro/hungary|title=Introductory Essay {{!}} Making the History of 1989|website=chnm.gmu.edu|access-date=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is significant in that it is seen to be the start of the erosion of Communist power in Hungary, which ended in May 1990 with the first free democratic elections.

The founder was biologist [[JÃ¡nos Vargha]].

The '''Electric Vehicle Grand Prix''' (stylized as evGrand Prix) is an electric [[go-kart]] race held at [[Purdue University]] and the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]].

== How it started ==

[[Purdue University]], in conjunction with [[University of Notre Dame]], [[University of Indianapolis]], [[Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana|Ivy Tech Community College]], [[Purdue University Calumet]], and [[Indiana University Northwest]], was awarded a $6.1 million grant by the [[United States Department of Energy]]. This grant was awarded to create The Indiana Advanced Electric Vehicle Training and Education Consortium (I-AEVtec). The goal of this consortium is to educate and train the workforce needed to design, manufacture, and maintain advanced [[electric vehicle]]s and the associated infrastructure. This goal includes creating online courses related to batteries, fuel cells, motors, controls, electric vehicles, and environmental impact. As part of this grant, Purdue created an event called the Electric Vehicle Grand Prix. The grant was part of the grants announced by [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] at a speech in [[Elkhart, Indiana]] in August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/24-billion-grants-accelerate-manufacturing-and-deployment-next-generation-us-batter "President Obama Announces $2.4 Billion in Grants to Accelerate the Manufacturing and Deployment of the Next Generation of U.S. Batteries and Electric Vehicles"]. Press release from [[whitehouse.gov]], August 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The race ==

The Electric Vehicle Grand Prix is an event at Purdue University that allows students to get real experience with electric vehicles. The first Electric Vehicle Grand Prix was held on April 18, 2010. Students join a team either through a build class or a student-organized team.  Each team builds a battery-powered electric go-kart and races it in the event. The 2010 race was an endurance race consisting of 80 laps and a [[Automotive battery|battery]] change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evgrandprix.org/docs/KartSpec_2011A_Final.pdf "2011 Event A Kart Specifications"]. evGrandPrix. November 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, a second event took place at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway where teams would compete in the International evGrand Prix. For the 2013 International evGrand Prix, the event was split up into two races. The first race featured electric karts with standard motors and batteries while the second race featured karts with upgraded motors and batteries.
In 2015 for the first time the race was sanctioned by [[United States Auto Club|USAC]].  In 2016, the evGrand Prix became part of the Student Karting World Finals, along with the High School evGrand Prix and the new National Gas Grand Prix, all of which were sanctioned by USAC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usackarting.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education now ==

Currently at Purdue there are four classes being offered that relate directly to electric vehicles across multiple disciplines. They include "Communication and Emerging Technologies" and "Electric Vehicle Systems".

== EV vs. Gas Challenge ==
On October 25, 2014, five EV and five gas karts competed on the same track for the first time in Purdue history. The race was scheduled for October 18, but was delayed due to rain. Cary Racing swept the front row with a gas kart on pole, and an EV starting second. The gas karts dominated the race, as eventual winner Eli Salamie leading all 40 laps for Cary Racing. Christian Jones in the #34 PEF kart was the highest finishing EV kart in 4th.

The '''Israel Public Utility Authority for Electricity''' (in short: The Electricity Authority) is a [[government]] authority charged with providing utility services, setting tariffs, regulation and oversight of the [[electricity]] market in [[Israel]]. The Authority was established in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pua.gov.il/35-he/Electricity.aspx |title=The Electricity Market Law| publisher=Electricity Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt; concurrent with the expiration of the 70-year-old concession of the [[Israel Electric Corporation]] (IEC), and pursuant to the Electricity Market Law of 1996. Prior to the establishment of the Electricity Authority, the Electric Corporation itself operated vis-a-vis the government of Israel in various fields related to regulation of the electricity system in Israel, such as the initiation of the construction of new power plants.
The powers and tasks of the Authority, as well as the composition of the Authority's members and its manner of operation are defined in and based on the Electricity Market Law. The Electricity Authority serves as an independent professional regulator in matters concerning the electricity market in Israel, and is responsible for the regulation and oversight of the provision of public utilities in the field of electricity in Israel. The Authority is obligated to maintain a balance of interests between consumers, the Electric Corporation, electricity manufacturers, and the state.
Part of the role of the Electricity Authority is the setting of the electricity tariffs in Israel, and the implementation of Israeli government decisions which have set a required level of power production by private producers and by [[renewable energy]], through the encouragement and regulation of private power producers and producers of electricity from renewable energies, alongside the Electric Corporation.

==The Authority's Main Areas of Responsibility==
* Setting electricity [[tariffs]] and the methods of updating them.
* Setting required standards for the level, nature and quality of the service provided by the various entities operating in the electricity market to consumers, and overseeing the fulfillment of these duties according to measures set by the Authority.
* Conducting cost monitoring for the Electric Corporation, for the purpose of setting the components of the tariff.
* Issuing licenses to operate in the electricity market, and overseeing the fulfillment of conditions set in the licenses.
* Setting economic arrangements for license holders and private entrepreneurship in the electricity market vis-a-vis the Electric Corporation.
* Setting economic arrangements for the promotion and activities of [[renewable energy]] power producers.
* Promotion of arrangements for the management and streamlining of consumption.
* Checking consumer complaints against service providers and ruling on them.
* Minimizing costs in the electricity market.
* Creating conditions for competition in the electricity market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pua.gov.il/Sip_storage/FILES/7/3187.pdf |title=Activity Report for the years 2011-2012 |publisher=Electricity Authority |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714143227/http://www.pua.gov.il/Sip_storage/FILES/7/3187.pdf |archivedate=July 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chairperson of the Authority==
The Chairperson of the Authority is appointed by the government for a term of five years, with the possibility of an additional four-year extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pua.gov.il/35-he/Electricity.aspx |title=The Electricity Market Law| publisher=Electricity Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Authority is currently headed by Dr. Assaf Eilat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pua.gov.il/English/Pages/TheChairperson.aspx|title=The Chairperson of the Public Utility Authority â Electricity|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=The Electricity Authority|archiveurl=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]] and [[thermodynamics]], an '''equation of state''' is a [[thermodynamic equations|thermodynamic equation]] relating [[state variable]]s which describe the state of matter under a given set of physical conditions, such as [[pressure]], [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]], [[temperature]] ('''PVT'''), or [[internal energy]].&lt;ref name="Perrot" &gt;{{cite book | author=Perrot, Pierre | title=A to Z of Thermodynamics | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1998 | isbn=978-0-19-856552-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equations of state are useful in describing the properties of [[fluid]]s, mixtures of fluids, [[solid]]s, and the interior of [[star]]s.
{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=[[Thermodynamic system|Systems]]}}

==Overview==
The most prominent use of an equation of state is to correlate densities of gases and liquids to temperatures and pressures. One of the simplest equations of state for this purpose is the [[ideal gas law]], which is roughly accurate for weakly polar gases at low pressures and moderate temperatures. However, this equation becomes increasingly inaccurate at higher pressures and lower temperatures, and fails to predict condensation from a gas to a liquid. Therefore, a number of more accurate equations of state have been developed for gases and liquids. At present, there is no single equation of state that accurately predicts the properties of all substances under all conditions.

Another common use is in modeling the interior of stars, including [[neutron star]]s, dense matter ([[quarkâgluon plasma]]s) and radiation fields. A related concept is the [[perfect fluid]] [[equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state used in cosmology]].

Equations of state can also describe solids, including the transition of solids from one crystalline state to another.

In a practical context, equations of state are instrumental for PVT calculations in [[process engineering]] problems, such as petroleum gas/liquid equilibrium calculations. A successful PVT model based on a fitted equation of state can be helpful to determine the state of the flow regime, the parameters for handling the [[reservoir fluids]], and pipe sizing.

== Historical ==

=== Boyle's law (1662) ===
Boyle's Law was perhaps the first expression of an equation of state.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} In 1662, the Irish physicist and chemist [[Robert Boyle]] performed a series of experiments employing a J-shaped glass tube, which was sealed on one end. [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] was added to the tube, trapping a fixed quantity of air in the short, sealed end of the tube. Then the volume of gas was measured as additional mercury was added to the tube. The pressure of the gas could be determined by the difference between the mercury level in the short end of the tube and that in the long, open end. Through these experiments, Boyle noted that the gas volume varied inversely with the pressure. In mathematical form, this can be stated as:

:&lt;math&gt; pV = \mathrm{constant}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &lt;!--this V doesn't have to be molar volume--&gt;

The above relationship has also been attributed to [[Edme Mariotte]] and is sometimes referred to as Mariotte's law. However, Mariotte's work was not published until 1676.

=== Charles's law or Law of Charles and Gay-Lussac (1787) ===
In 1787 the French physicist [[Jacques Charles]] found that oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and air expand to roughly the same extent over the same 80-kelvin interval. Later, in 1802, [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] published results of similar experiments, indicating a linear relationship between volume and temperature:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Dalton's law of partial pressures (1801) ===
[[Dalton's Law]] of partial pressure states that the pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the pressures of all of the constituent gases alone.

Mathematically, this can be represented for ''n'' species as:

::&lt;math&gt;
p_\text{total} = p_1+p_2+\cdots+p_n = p_\text{total} = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i.
&lt;/math&gt;

=== The ideal gas law (1834) ===
In 1834, [[Ãmile Clapeyron]] combined Boyle's Law and Charles' law into the first statement of the ''[[ideal gas law]]''. Initially, the law was formulated as ''pV&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''R''(''T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' + 267) (with temperature expressed in degrees Celsius), where ''R'' is the [[gas constant]]. However, later work revealed that the number should actually be closer to 273.2, and then the Celsius scale was defined with 0{{nbsp}}Â°C = 273.15{{nbsp}}K, giving:

:&lt;math&gt;pV_m = R \left(T_C + 273.15\ {}^\circ\text{C}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Van der Waals equation of state (1873) ===
In 1873, [[J. D. van der Waals]] introduced the first [[van der Waals equation|equation of state]] derived by the assumption of a finite volume occupied by the constituent molecules.&lt;ref name="van der Waals" &gt;{{cite book |author1=van der Waals |author2=J. D. | title=On the Continuity of the Gaseous and Liquid States (doctoral dissertation) | publisher=Universiteit Leiden | year=1873}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His new formula revolutionized the study of equations of state, and was most famously continued via the [[RedlichâKwong equation of state]] and the [[#Soave modification of Redlich-Kwong|Soave modification of Redlich-Kwong]].

== General form of an equation of state ==
For a given amount of substance contained in a system, the temperature, volume, and pressure are not independent quantities; they are connected by a relationship of the general form

:&lt;math&gt;f(p, V, T) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

An equation used to model this relationship is called an equation of state. In the following sections major equations of state are described, and the variables used here are defined as follows. Any consistent set of units may be used, although [[International System of Units|SI]] units are preferred. [[Thermodynamic temperature|Absolute temperature]] refers to use of the [[Kelvin]] (K) or [[Rankine scale|Rankine]] (Â°R) temperature scales, with zero being absolute zero.

:&lt;math&gt;\ p&lt;/math&gt;, pressure (absolute)
:&lt;math&gt;\ V&lt;/math&gt;, volume
:&lt;math&gt;\ n&lt;/math&gt;, number of moles of a substance
:&lt;math&gt;\ V_m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{V}{n}&lt;/math&gt;, '''[[molar volume]]''', the volume of 1 mole of gas or liquid
:&lt;math&gt;\ T&lt;/math&gt;, [[thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]]
:&lt;math&gt;\ R&lt;/math&gt;, [[gas constant|ideal gas constant]] â 8.3144621{{nbsp}}J/molÂ·K
:&lt;math&gt;\ p_c&lt;/math&gt;, pressure at the critical point
:&lt;math&gt;\ V_c&lt;/math&gt;, molar volume at the critical point
:&lt;math&gt;\ T_c&lt;/math&gt;, absolute temperature at the critical point

== Classical ideal gas law ==
The classical [[ideal gas law]] may be written

:&lt;math&gt;pV = nRT.&lt;/math&gt;

In the form shown above, the equation of state is thus

:&lt;math&gt;f(p, V, T) = pV - nRT = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

If the [[Perfect gas|calorically perfect]] gas approximation is used, then the ideal gas law may also be expressed as follows

:&lt;math&gt;p = \rho(\gamma - 1)e&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;  is the density, &lt;math&gt;\gamma = C_p/C_v&lt;/math&gt; is the adiabatic index ([[heat capacity ratio|ratio of specific heats]]), &lt;math&gt;e = C_v T&lt;/math&gt; is the internal energy per unit mass (the "specific internal energy"), &lt;math&gt;C_v&lt;/math&gt; is the specific heat at constant volume, and &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt; is the specific heat at constant pressure.

== Cubic equations of state ==
Cubic equations of state are called such because they can be rewritten as a [[cubic function]] of V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Van der Waals equation of state ===
The [[Van der Waals equation]] of state may be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(p + \frac{a}{V_m^2}\right)\left(V_m - b\right) = RT&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V_m&lt;/math&gt; is [[molar volume]]. The substance-specific constants &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated from the [[critical properties]] &lt;math&gt;p_c, T_c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_c&lt;/math&gt; (noting that &lt;math&gt;V_c&lt;/math&gt; is the molar volume at the critical point) as:
:&lt;math&gt;a = 3p_c\, V_c^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{V_c}{3}.&lt;/math&gt;

Also written as
:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{27(R\,T_c)^2}{64p_c}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{R\,T_c}{8p_c}.&lt;/math&gt;

Proposed in 1873, the van der Waals equation of state was one of the first to perform markedly better than the ideal gas law. In this landmark equation &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is called the attraction parameter and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; the repulsion parameter or the effective molecular volume. While the equation is definitely superior to the ideal gas law and does predict the formation of a liquid phase, the agreement with experimental data is limited for conditions where the liquid forms. While the van der Waals equation is commonly referenced in text-books and papers for historical reasons, it is now obsolete. Other modern equations of only slightly greater complexity are much more accurate.

The van der Waals equation may be considered as the ideal gas law, "improved" due to two independent reasons:
# Molecules are thought as particles with volume, not material points. Thus &lt;math&gt;V_m&lt;/math&gt; cannot be too little, less than some constant. So we get (&lt;math&gt;V_m - b&lt;/math&gt;) instead of &lt;math&gt;V_m&lt;/math&gt;.
# While ideal gas molecules do not interact, we consider molecules attracting others within a distance of several molecules' radii. It makes no effect inside the material, but surface molecules are attracted into the material from the surface. We see this as diminishing of pressure on the outer shell (which is used in the ideal gas law), so we write (&lt;math&gt;p +&lt;/math&gt; something) instead of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. To evaluate this âsomethingâ, let's examine an additional force acting on an element of gas surface. While the force acting on each surface molecule is ~&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, the force acting on the whole element is ~&lt;math&gt;\rho^2&lt;/math&gt;~&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{V_m^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

With the reduced state variables, i.e. V&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;=V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;=P/P&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;=T/T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, the reduced form of the Van der Waals equation can be formulated:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(P_r + \frac{3}{V_r^2}\right)\left(3V_r - 1\right) = 8T_r&lt;/math&gt;

The benefit of this form is that for given T&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, the reduced volume of the liquid and gas can be calculated directly using [[Cubic function#Cardano's method|Cardano's method]] for the reduced cubic form:

:&lt;math&gt;V_r^3 - \left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{8T_r}{3P_r}\right)V_r^2 + \frac{3V_r}{P_r} - \frac{1}{P_r} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

For P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;1 and T&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;1, the system is in a state of vaporâliquid equilibrium. The reduced cubic equation of state yields in that case 3 solutions. The largest and the lowest solution are the gas and liquid reduced volume.

=== Redlich-Kwong equation of state ===
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  p &amp;= \frac{R\,T}{V_m - b} - \frac{a}{\sqrt{T}\,V_m\left(V_m + b\right)} \\[3pt]
  a &amp;\approx 0.42748\frac{R^2\,T_c^\frac{5}{2}}{p_c} \\[3pt]
  b &amp;\approx 0.08664\frac{R\,T_c}{p_c}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Introduced in 1949, the [[Redlich-Kwong equation of state]] was a considerable improvement over other equations of the time. It is still of interest primarily due to its relatively simple form. While superior to the van der Waals equation of state, it performs poorly with respect to the liquid phase and thus cannot be used for accurately calculating [[vaporâliquid equilibria]]. However, it can be used in conjunction with separate liquid-phase correlations for this purpose.

The Redlich-Kwong equation is adequate for calculation of gas phase properties when the ratio of the pressure to the [[critical properties|critical pressure]] (reduced pressure) is less than about one-half of the ratio of the temperature to the [[critical properties|critical temperature]] (reduced temperature):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{p_c} &lt; \frac{T}{2T_c}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Soave modification of Redlich-Kwong ===
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{R\,T}{V_m-b} - \frac{a\,\alpha}{V_m\left(V_m+b\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{0.42747\,R^2\,T_c^2}{P_c}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{0.08664\,R\,T_c}{P_c}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \left(1 + \left(0.48508 + 1.55171\,\omega - 0.15613\,\omega^2\right) \left(1-T_r^{\,0.5}\right)\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T_r = \frac{T}{T_c}&lt;/math&gt;

Where Ï is the [[acentric factor]] for the species.

This formulation for &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is due to Graboski and Daubert.  The original formulation from Soave is:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \left(1 + \left(0.480 + 1.574\,\omega - 0.176\,\omega^2\right) \left(1-T_r^{\,0.5}\right)\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

for hydrogen:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = 1.202 \exp\left(-0.30288\,T_r\right).&lt;/math&gt;

We can also write it in the polynomial form, with:

:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{a\,\alpha\,P}{R^2\,T^2}&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{b\,P}{R\,T}&lt;/math&gt;
then we have:
:&lt;math&gt;0 = Z^3-Z^2+Z\left(A-B-B^2\right)-AB \;&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[universal gas constant]] and Z=PV/(RT) is the [[compressibility factor]].

In 1972 G. Soave&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/0009-2509(72)80096-4|title = Equilibrium constants from a modified Redlich-Kwong equation of state| journal=Chemical Engineering Science| volume=27| issue=6| pages=1197â1203|year = 1972|last1 = Soave|first1 = Giorgio}}&lt;/ref&gt; replaced the 1/{{radic|''T''}} term of the Redlich-Kwong equation with a function Î±(T,Ï) involving the temperature and the [[acentric factor]] (the resulting equation is also known as the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state; SRK EOS). The Î± function was devised to fit the vapor pressure data of hydrocarbons and the equation does fairly well for these materials.

Note especially that this replacement changes the definition of ''a'' slightly, as the &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt; is now to the second power.

=== Volume translation of Peneloux et alios ===
The SRK EOS may be written as
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{R\,T}{V_{m,\text{SRK}} - b} - \frac{a}{V_{m,\text{SRK}} \left(V_{m,\text{SRK}} + b\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    a &amp;= a_c\, \alpha \\
  a_c &amp;\approx 0.42747\frac{R^2\,T_c^2}{P_c} \\
    b &amp;\approx 0.08664\frac{R\,T_c}{P_c}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and other parts of the SRK EOS is defined in the SRK EOS section.

A downside of the SRK EOS, and other cubic EOS, is that the liquid molar volume is significantly less accurate than the gas molar volume. Peneloux et alios (1982)&lt;ref name="Peneloux1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peneloux|first1=A.|last2=Rauzy|first2=E.|last3=Freze|first3=R.|year=1982|title= A Consistent Correction for Redlich-Kwong-Soave Volumes|journal= Fluid Phase Equilibria|volume=8|issue=1982|pages=7â23|doi=10.1016/0378-3812(82)80002-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a simple correction for this by introducing a volume translation

:&lt;math&gt;V_{m,\text{SRK}} = V_m + c&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is an additional fluid component parameter that translate the molar volume slightly. On the liquid branch of the EOS, a small change in molar volume corresponds to a large change in pressure. On the gas branch of the EOS, a small change in molar volume corresponds to a much smaller change in pressure than for the liquid branch. Thus, the perturbation of the molar gas volume is small. Unfortunately, there are two versions that occur in science and industry.

In the first version only &lt;math&gt;V_{m,\text{SRK}}&lt;/math&gt; is translated,&lt;ref name="Soave1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soave|first1=G.|last2=Fermeglia|first2=M.|year=1990|title= On the Application of Cubic Equation of State to Synthetic High-Pressure VLE Measurements|journal= Fluid Phase Equilibria|volume=60|issue=1990|pages=261â271|doi=10.1016/0378-3812(90)85056-G}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Zeberg2001"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=ZÃ©berg-Mikkelsen|first1=C.K.|year=2001|title=Viscosity study of hydrocarbon fluids at reservoir conditions - modeling and measurements|journal=Ph.D. Thesis at the Technical University of Denmark. Department of Chemical Engineering|volume=June|issue=2001|pages=1â271|isbn=9788790142742}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the EOS becomes

:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{R\,T}{V_m + c - b} - \frac{a}{\left(V_m + c\right) \left(V_m + c + b\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

In the second version both &lt;math&gt;V_{m,\text{SRK}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_\text{SRK}&lt;/math&gt; are translated, or the translation of &lt;math&gt;V_{m,\text{SRK}}&lt;/math&gt; is followed by a renaming of the composite parameter {{nowrap|b â c}}.&lt;ref name="Pedersen1989"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Pedersen|first1=K.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  b_\text{SRK} &amp;= b + c \quad \text{or} \quad b - c \curvearrowright b \\
             p &amp;= \frac{R\,T}{V_m - b} - \frac{a}{\left(V_m + c\right) \left(V_m + 2c + b\right)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The c-parameter of a fluid mixture is calculated by
:&lt;math&gt;c = \sum_{i=1}^n z_i c_i&lt;/math&gt;

The c-parameter of the individual fluid components in a petroleum gas and oil can be estimated by the correlation

:&lt;math&gt;c_i \approx 0.40768\ \frac{RT_{ci}}{P_{ci}} \left(0.29441 - Z_{\text{RA},i}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where the Rackett compressibility factor &lt;math&gt;Z_{text{RA},i}&lt;/math&gt; can be estimated by

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{RA},i} \approx 0.29056 - 0.08775\ \omega_i&lt;/math&gt;

A nice feature with the volume translation method of Peneloux et alios (1982) is that it does not affect the vapor-liquid equilibrium calculations.&lt;ref name="Knudsen1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knudsen|first1=K.|year=1992|title=Phase Equilibria and Transport of Multiphase Systems|journal=Ph.D. Thesis at the Technical University of Denmark. Department of Chemical Engineering|issue=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that this method of volume translation can also be applied to other cubic EOSs if the c-parameter correlation is adjusted to match the selected EOS.

=== PengâRobinson equation of state ===

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       p &amp;= \frac{R\,T}{V_m - b} - \frac{a\,\alpha}{V_m^2 + 2bV_m - b^2} \\[3pt]
       a &amp;\approx 0.45724 \frac{R^2\,T_c^2}{p_c} \\[3pt]
       b &amp;\approx 0.07780 \frac{R\,T_c}{p_c} \\[3pt]
  \alpha &amp;= \left(1 + \kappa \left(1 - T_r^\frac{1}{2}\right)\right)^2 \\[3pt]
  \kappa &amp;\approx 0.37464 + 1.54226\,\omega - 0.26992\,\omega^2 \\[3pt]
     T_r &amp;= \frac{T}{T_c}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In polynomial form:
:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{\alpha a p}{R^2\,T^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{bp}{RT}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z^3 - (1 - B)Z^2 + \left(A - 2B - 3B^2\right)Z - \left(AB - B^2 - B^3\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[acentric factor]] of the species, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[universal gas constant]] and &lt;math&gt;Z = PV/nRT&lt;/math&gt; is [[compressibility factor]].

The PengâRobinson equation of state (PR EOS) was developed in 1976 at The [[University of Alberta]] by [[Ding Yu Peng|Ding-Yu Peng]] and Donald Robinson in order to satisfy the following goals:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A New Two-Constant Equation of State | journal = Industrial and Engineering Chemistry: Fundamentals | volume = 15 | year = 1976 | pages = 59â64 |author1=Peng, D. Y. |author2=Robinson, D. B. | doi = 10.1021/i160057a011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The parameters should be expressible in terms of the [[critical properties]] and the [[acentric factor]].
# The model should provide reasonable accuracy near the critical point, particularly for calculations of the [[compressibility factor]] and liquid density.
# The mixing rules should not employ more than a single binary interaction parameter, which should be independent of temperature, pressure and composition.
# The equation should be applicable to all calculations of all fluid properties in natural gas processes.

For the most part the PengâRobinson equation exhibits performance similar to the Soave equation, although it is generally superior in predicting the liquid densities of many materials, especially nonpolar ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Essentials of Reservoir Engineering | volume = 1 | year = 2007 | pages = 151 | author = Pierre Donnez  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[departure function]]s of the PengâRobinson equation are given on a separate article.

The analytic values of its characteristic constants are:

: &lt;math&gt;Z_c = \frac{1}{32} \left( 11 - 2\sqrt{7} \sinh(\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{asinh}(\frac{13}{7 \sqrt{7}})) \right) \approx 0.307401&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;b' = \frac{b}{V_{m,c}} = \frac{1}{3} \left( \sqrt{8} \sinh(\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{asinh}(\sqrt{8}) ) - 1 \right) \approx 0.253077 \approx \frac{0.07780}{Z_c} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{P_c V_{m,c}^2}{a\,b'} = \frac{3}{8} \left( 1 + \cosh(\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{acosh}(3) ) \right) \approx 0.816619 \approx \frac{Z_c^2}{0.45724 \, b'} &lt;/math&gt;

====PRSV1====
A modification to the attraction term in the PengâRobinson equation of state published by Stryjek and Vera in 1986 (PRSV) significantly improved the model's accuracy by introducing an adjustable pure component parameter and by modifying the polynomial fit of the [[acentric factor]].&lt;ref name="PRSV1"&gt;{{cite journal | title = PRSV: An improved PengâRobinson equation of state for pure compounds and mixtures | journal = The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering | volume = 64 | issue = 2 | year = 1986 | pages = 323â333 |author1=Stryjek, R.  |author2=Vera, J. H. | doi = 10.1002/cjce.5450640224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modification is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \kappa &amp;= \kappa_0 + \kappa_1 \left(1 + T_r^\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(0.7 - T_r\right) \\
  \kappa_0 &amp;= 0.378893+1.4897153\,\omega - 0.17131848\,\omega^2 + 0.0196554\,\omega^3
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\,\kappa_1&lt;/math&gt; is an adjustable pure component parameter.  Stryjek and Vera published pure component parameters for many compounds of industrial interest in their original journal article. At reduced temperatures above 0.7, they recommend to set &lt;math&gt;\,\kappa_1 = 0 &lt;/math&gt; and simply use &lt;math&gt;\kappa = \kappa_0 &lt;/math&gt;. For alcohols and water the value of &lt;math&gt;\,\kappa_1 &lt;/math&gt; may be used up to the critical temperature and set to zero at higher temperatures.&lt;ref name="PRSV1" /&gt;

====PRSV2====
A subsequent modification published in 1986 (PRSV2) further improved the model's accuracy by introducing two additional pure component parameters to the previous attraction term modification.&lt;ref name="PRSV2"&gt;{{cite journal | title = PRSV2: A cubic equation of state for accurate vaporâliquid equilibria calculations | journal = The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering | volume = 64 | issue = 5 | year = 1986 | pages = 820â826 |author1=Stryjek, R.  |author2=Vera, J. H. | doi = 10.1002/cjce.5450640516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modification is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \kappa &amp;= \kappa_0 + \left[\kappa_1 + \kappa_2\left(\kappa_3 - T_r\right)\left(1 - T_r^\frac{1}{2}\right)\right]\left(1 + T_r^\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(0.7 - T_r\right) \\
  \kappa_0 &amp;= 0.378893 + 1.4897153\,\omega - 0.17131848\,\omega^2 + 0.0196554\,\omega^3
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\,\kappa_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\,\kappa_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\,\kappa_3&lt;/math&gt; are adjustable pure component parameters.

PRSV2 is particularly advantageous for [[vaporâliquid equilibrium|VLE]] calculations.  While PRSV1 does offer an advantage over the PengâRobinson model for describing thermodynamic behavior, it is still not accurate enough, in general, for phase equilibrium calculations.&lt;ref name="PRSV1" /&gt;  The highly non-linear behavior of phase-equilibrium calculation methods tends to amplify what would otherwise be acceptably small errors.  It is therefore recommended that PRSV2 be used for equilibrium calculations when applying these models to a design.  However, once the equilibrium state has been determined, the phase specific thermodynamic values at equilibrium may be determined by one of several simpler models with a reasonable degree of accuracy.&lt;ref name="PRSV2" /&gt;

One thing to note is that in the PRSV equation, the parameter fit is done in a particular temperature range which is usually below the critical temperature. Above the critical temperature, the PRSV alpha function tends to diverge and become arbitrarily large instead of tending towards 0. Because of this, alternate equations for alpha should be employed above the critical point. This is especially important for systems containing hydrogen which is often found at temperatures far above its critical point. Several alternate formulations have been proposed. Some well known ones are by Twu et all or by Mathias and Copeman.

=== Elliott, Suresh, Donohue equation of state ===
The Elliott, Suresh, and Donohue (ESD) equation of state was proposed in 1990.&lt;ref name="ESD" &gt;{{cite journal |author1=J. Richard, Jr. Elliott |author2=S. Jayaraman Suresh |author3=Marc D. Donohue | year=1990 | title=A Simple Equation of State for Nonspherical and Associating Molecules | journal=Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. |volume=29 | pages=1476â1485 | doi=10.1021/ie00103a057 | issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equation seeks to correct a shortcoming in the PengâRobinson EOS in that there was an inaccuracy in the van der Waals repulsive term. The EOS accounts for the effect of the shape of a non-polar molecule and can be extended to polymers with the addition of an extra term (not shown). The EOS itself was developed through modeling computer simulations and should capture the essential physics of the size, shape, and hydrogen bonding.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p V_m}{RT}=Z=1 + Z^{\rm{rep}} + Z^{\rm{att}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;Z^{\rm{rep}} = \frac{4 c \eta}{1-1.9 \eta}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z^{\rm{att}} = -\frac{z_m q \eta Y}{1+ k_1 \eta Y}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a "shape factor", with &lt;math&gt;c=1&lt;/math&gt; for spherical molecules
:For non-spherical molecules, the following relation is suggested:

:&lt;math&gt;c=1+3.535\omega+0.533\omega^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[acentric factor]]

:The reduced number density &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\eta=\frac{v^* n}{V}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;v^*&lt;/math&gt; is the characteristic size parameter
:&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of molecules
:&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the container
The characteristic size parameter is related to the shape parameter &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; through
:&lt;math&gt;v^*=\frac{kT_c}{P_c}\Phi&lt;/math&gt;
where

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi=\frac{0.0312+0.087(c-1)+0.008(c-1)^2}{1.000+2.455(c-1)+0.732(c-1)^2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]].

Noting the relationships between Boltzmann's constant and the [[Universal gas constant]], and observing that the number of molecules can be expressed in terms of [[Avogadro's number]] and the [[molar mass]], the reduced number density &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in terms of the molar volume as

:&lt;math&gt;\eta=\frac{R T_c}{P_c}\Phi\frac{1}{V_m}.&lt;/math&gt;

The shape parameter &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; appearing in the Attraction term and the term &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are given by
:&lt;math&gt;q=1+k_3(c-1)&lt;/math&gt; (and is hence also equal to 1 for spherical molecules).

:&lt;math&gt;Y=\exp\left(\frac{\epsilon}{kT}\right) - k_2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the depth of the square-well potential and is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\epsilon}{k} =\frac{1.000+0.945(c-1)+0.134(c-1)^2}{1.023+2.225(c-1)+0.478(c-1)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z_m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_3&lt;/math&gt; are constants in the equation of state:
:&lt;math&gt;z_m = 9.49&lt;/math&gt; for spherical molecules (c=1)
:&lt;math&gt;k_1 = 1.7745&lt;/math&gt; for spherical molecules (c=1)
:&lt;math&gt;k_2 = 1.0617&lt;/math&gt; for spherical molecules (c=1)
:&lt;math&gt;k_3 = 1.90476.&lt;/math&gt;

The model can be extended to associating components and mixtures of nonassociating components. Details are in the paper by J.R. Elliott, Jr. ''et al.'' (1990).&lt;ref name="ESD"/&gt;

=== Dieterici equation of state ===
: &lt;math&gt;p(V - b) = RTe^{-\frac{a}{RTV}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' is associated with the interaction between molecules and ''b'' takes into account the finite size of the molecules, similar to the Van der Waals equation.

The reduced coordinates are:

=== Virial equation of state ===
{{main|Virial expansion}}
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{pV_m}{RT} = A + \frac{B}{V_m} + \frac{C}{V_m^2} + \frac{D}{V_m^3} + \dots&lt;/math&gt;

Although usually not the most convenient equation of state, the virial equation is important because it can be derived directly from [[statistical mechanics]]. This equation is also called the [[Kamerlingh Onnes]] equation. If appropriate assumptions are made about the mathematical form of intermolecular forces, theoretical expressions can be developed for each of the [[virial coefficient|coefficients]]. ''A'' is the first virial coefficient, which has a constant value of 1 and makes the statement that when volume is large, all fluids behave like ideal gases. The second virial coefficient ''B'' corresponds to interactions between pairs of molecules, ''C'' to triplets, and so on. Accuracy can be increased indefinitely by considering higher order terms.  The coefficients ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', etc. are functions of temperature only.

One of the most accurate equations of state is that from Benedict-Webb-Rubin-Starling&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Fluid Properties for Light Petroleum Systems |last=Starling |first=Kenneth E. |publisher=Gulf Publishing Company |year=1973 |page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; shown next. It was very close to a virial equation of state. If the exponential term in it is expanded to two Taylor terms, a virial equation can be derived:
:&lt;math&gt;p=\rho RT + \left(B_0 RT-A_0 - \frac{C_0}{T^2} + \frac{D_0}{T^3} - \frac{E_0}{T^4}\right) \rho^2 + \left(bRT-a-\frac{d}{T} + \frac{c}{T^2}\right) \rho^3 + \alpha\left(a+\frac{d}{T}\right) \rho^6 &lt;/math&gt;

Note that in this virial equation, the fourth and fifth virial terms are zero. The second virial coefficient is monotonically decreasing as temperature is lowered. The third virial coefficient is monotonically increasing as temperature is lowered.

=== The BWR equation of state ===
{{main|BenedictâWebbâRubin equation}}
:&lt;math&gt;
  p = \rho RT +
      \left(B_0 RT - A_0 - \frac{C_0}{T^2} + \frac{D_0}{T^3} - \frac{E_0}{T^4}\right) \rho^2 +
      \left(bRT - a - \frac{d}{T}\right) \rho^3 +
      \alpha\left(a + \frac{d}{T}\right) \rho^6 +
      \frac{c\rho^3}{T^2}\left(1 + \gamma\rho^2\right)\exp\left(-\gamma\rho^2\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where
:''p'' is pressure
:''Ï'' is molar density

== SAFT equations of state ==
[[Statistical associating fluid theory]] (SAFT) equations of state use [[Statistical mechanics|statistical mechanical]] methods (in particular [[perturbation theory]]) to describe the interactions between molecules in a system.&lt;ref name="ChapmanGubbins1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chapman|first1=Walter G.|last2=Gubbins|first2=K.E.|last3=Jackson|first3=G.|last4=Radosz|first4=M.|title=SAFT: Equation-of-state solution model for associating fluids|journal=Fluid Phase Equilibria|date=1 December 1989|volume=52|year=1989|pages=31â38|doi=10.1016/0378-3812(89)80308-5 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378381289803085 |accessdate=31 August 2018 |language=en |issn=0378-3812}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a SAFT equation of state was first proposed by Chapman et al. in 1989,&lt;ref name="ChapmanGubbins1989" /&gt; but since then many different SAFT equations of state have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1063/1.473101|title = Statistical associating fluid theory for chain molecules with attractive potentials of variable range| journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics| volume=106| issue=10| pages=4168â4186|year = 1997|last1 = Gil-Villegas|first1 = Alejandro| last2=Galindo| first2=Amparo| last3=Whitehead| first3=Paul J.| last4=Mills| first4=Stuart J.| last5=Jackson| first5=George| last6=Burgess| first6=Andrew N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often SAFT equations represent molecules as collections of spherical particles that interact with one another.&lt;ref name="ChapmanGubbins1989" /&gt; One popular SAFT equation represents molecules as chains composed of spherical segments ([[PC-SAFT]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1021/ie0003887|title = Perturbed-Chain SAFT:Â  An Equation of State Based on a Perturbation Theory for Chain Molecules| journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research| volume=40| issue=4| pages=1244â1260|year = 2001|last1 = Gross|first1 = Joachim| last2=Sadowski| first2=Gabriele}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, SAFT equations give more accurate results than traditional cubic equations of state, especially for systems containing liquids or solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1021/ie010954d|title = Application of the Perturbed-Chain SAFT Equation of State to Associating Systems| journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research| volume=41| issue=22| pages=5510â5515|year = 2002|last1 = Gross|first1 = Joachim| last2=Sadowski| first2=Gabriele}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.fluid.2014.08.035|title = A modified continuous flow apparatus for gas solubility measurements at high pressure and temperature with camera system| journal=Fluid Phase Equilibria| volume=382| pages=150â157|year = 2014|last1 = Saajanlehto|first1 = Meri| last2=Uusi-Kyyny| first2=Petri| last3=Alopaeus| first3=Ville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Multiparameter equations of state ==

=== Helmholtz Function form ===
Multiparameter equations of state (MEOS) can be used to represent pure fluids with high accuracy, in both the liquid and gaseous states. MEOS's represent the Helmholtz function of the fluid as the sum of ideal gas and residual terms. Both terms are explicit in reduced temperature and reduced density - thus:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{a(T, \rho)}{RT} = 
  \frac{a^o(T, \rho) + a^r(T, \rho)}{RT} =
  \alpha^o(\tau, \delta) + \alpha^r(\tau, \delta)
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: &lt;math&gt;\tau = \frac{T_r}{T}, \delta = \frac{\rho}{\rho_r}&lt;/math&gt;

The reduced density and temperature are typically, though not always, the critical values for the pure fluid.

Other thermodynamic functions can be derived from the MEOS by using appropriate derivatives of the Helmholtz function; hence, because integration of the MEOS is not required, there are few restrictions as to the functional form of the ideal or residual terms. Typical MEOS use upwards of 50 fluid specific parameters, but are able to represent the fluid's properties with high accuracy. MEOS are available currently for about 50 of the most common industrial fluids including refrigerants. Mixture models also exist.

== Other equations of state of interest ==

===Stiffened equation of state===

When considering water under very high pressures, in situations such as [[Underwater explosion|underwater nuclear explosions]], [[Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy|sonic shock lithotripsy]], and [[sonoluminescence]], the stiffened equation of state is often used:

:&lt;math&gt;p = \rho(\gamma - 1)e - \gamma p^0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the internal energy per unit mass, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is an empirically determined constant typically taken to be about 6.1, and &lt;math&gt;p^0&lt;/math&gt; is another constant, representing the molecular attraction between water molecules. The magnitude of the correction is about 2 gigapascals (20,000 atmospheres).

The equation is stated in this form because the speed of sound in water is given by &lt;math&gt;c^2 = \gamma\left(p + p^0\right)/\rho&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus water behaves as though it is an ideal gas that is ''already'' under about 20,000 atmospheres (2&amp;nbsp;GPa) pressure, and explains why water is commonly assumed to be incompressible: when the external pressure changes from 1 atmosphere to 2 atmospheres (100&amp;nbsp;kPa to 200&amp;nbsp;kPa), the water behaves as an ideal gas would when changing from 20,001 to 20,002 atmospheres (2000.1&amp;nbsp;MPa to 2000.2&amp;nbsp;MPa).

This equation mispredicts the [[specific heat capacity]] of water but few simple alternatives are available for severely nonisentropic processes such as strong shocks.

===Ultrarelativistic equation of state===

An [[ultrarelativistic fluid]] has equation of state

:&lt;math&gt;p = \rho_m c_s^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure, &lt;math&gt;\rho_m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass density, and &lt;math&gt;c_s&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of sound]].

===Ideal Bose equation of state===

The equation of state for an ideal [[Bose gas]] is

:&lt;math&gt;pV_m =
  RT~\frac{\text{Li}_{\alpha+1}(z)}{\zeta(\alpha)}
  \left(\frac{T}{T_c}\right)^\alpha
&lt;/math&gt;

where Î± is an exponent specific to the system (e.g. in the absence of a potential field, Î± = 3/2), ''z'' is exp(''Î¼''/''kT'') where ''Î¼'' is the [[chemical potential]], Li is the [[polylogarithm]], Î¶ is the [[Riemann zeta function]], and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; is the critical temperature at which a [[BoseâEinstein condensate]] begins to form.

===JonesâWilkinsâLee equation of state for explosives (JWL equation)===
The '''equation of state from JonesâWilkinsâLee''' is used to describe the detonation products of explosives.

:&lt;math&gt;p = A \left( 1 - \frac{\omega}{R_1 V} \right) \exp(-R_1 V) + B \left( 1 - \frac{\omega}{R_2 V} \right) \exp\left(-R_2 V\right) + \frac{\omega e_0}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

The ratio &lt;math&gt; V = \rho_e / \rho &lt;/math&gt; is defined by using &lt;math&gt; \rho_e &lt;/math&gt; = density of the explosive (solid part) and &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; = density of the detonation products. The parameters &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; R_1 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; R_2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; are given by several references.&lt;ref name="Dobratz" &gt;{{Cite journal |author1=B.

In [[English law]], an '''estover''' is an allowance made to a person out of an estate, or other thing, for his or her support. '''Estovers''' are wood, that a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] is allowed to take, for life or a period of years, from the land he holds for the repair of his [[house]], the implements of [[husbandry]], [[Hedge (barrier)|hedges]] and [[fence]]s, and for [[firewood]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=801}}

==History==
The word derives from the [[French language|French]] ''estover'', ''estovoir'', a [[verb]] used as a [[substantive]] meaning "that which is necessary". This word is of disputed origin; it has been referred to the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''stare'', to stand, or ''studere'', to desire.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=801}}

The Old English word for estover was ''bote'' or ''boot'', also spelled ''bot'' or ''bÃ³t'', (literally meaning 'good' or 'profit' and cognate with the word ''better''). The various kinds of estovers were known as house-bote, cart or plough-bote, hedge or hay-bote, and fire-bote. [[Anglo-Saxon law]] also imposed "bot" fines in the modern sense of compensation.&lt;ref&gt;The legal phrase ''&amp;'' n. ''scillingas to bote'', "and ''n.'' shillings as compensation" often followed after other fines imposed for the same offense, and is the origin of the modern English phrase, "to boot". [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/560-975dooms.html Anglo-Saxon dooms from 560-975]&lt;/ref&gt; These rights might be restricted by express [[Covenant (law)|covenants]]. [[Copyhold]]ers had similar rights over the land they occupied and over the waste of the manor, in which case the rights are known as [[Commons]] of estovers.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=801}}


Burrill in his dated ''A law dictionary and glossary'' published in New York (1871) states:
{{quote|ESTOVER. L. Fr. and Eng. [L. Lat ''estoverium''.] An allowance made to a person. See Estoverium. The plural only (''estovers'') is now used. See ''Estovers''.

...

ESTOVERS. L.Fr. and Eng. [L. Lat. ''estoveria'' and more anciently ''estoverium''; from Fr. ''estouver', ''estover'', or ''estoffer'', to furnish, supply or maintain.] 

An allowance  made to a person out of an estate, or other thing for his or her support, as for food and  raiment, (''in victu'' et vestitu''). ''Stat, Gloc. 
c. 4. See ''Estover'', ''Estoverium''. An allowance (more commonly called ''[[alimony]]'',) granted to a woman divorced ''a mensa et thoro'', for her support out of her husband's estate. 1 ''Bl Com.'' 441.

This is the ordinary meaning of the word estovers which are also called in law botes embracing the various kinds of house-bote fire-bote plough-bote and hay-bote See [[Wiktionary:bote|Bote]]s. Estovers are sometimes erroneously confounded with ''common of estavers (q. v.) and the distinction is not clearly made by ''Britton'' in his 60th chapter, ''De renables estovers''.{{sfn|Burrill|1871|pp=565â566}}

'''Frank Allston Davis''' (September 8, 1850&lt;ref name="Hartzell200651"&gt;Hartzell, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; January 2, 1917&lt;ref name="Hartzell200655"&gt;Hartzell, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[publishing]] executive who founded the [[F. A. Davis Company]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].  After moving to the [[Tampa Bay Area]], he introduced electricity to [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] and founded the city of [[Pinellas Park, Florida|Pinellas Park]].

==Early life==
Davis was born in [[Duxbury, Vermont]] and, as a child, worked as a [[groundskeeper]] and attended school. His mother died in 1861, after which he lived with Samuel Cook Turner.&lt;ref name="Hartzell200651" /&gt; He worked as a lawnmower salesman in [[Asbury Park, New Jersey]] during the summer of 1870.&lt;ref name="fadaviscom"&gt;[http://www.fadavis.com/about_us/history.cfm The History of F. A. Davis] from the [[F. A. Davis Company]] web site.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1872, he earned $30 per month as a teacher.&lt;ref name="Hartzell2006512"&gt;Hartzell, pp. 51-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis relocated to Philadelphia and worked as an agent for several publishing firms.&lt;ref name="fadaviscom" /&gt;  He married Lizzie Fritz and their son, Alonzo, was born in 1873.&lt;ref name="Hartzell200652"&gt;Hartzell, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1879, he was working as an agent for the largest medical publisher in the world, William Wood and Company when he formed his own publishing company, F. A. Davis Company.&lt;ref name="fadaviscom" /&gt;  Similar to William Wood, Davis's company specialized in publishing medical material including medical studies.  Davis's first wife died in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="Hartzell200652" /&gt;

==Florida==
On April 29, 1885, Davis attended an [[American Medical Association]] meeting which included a study about the benefits of the [[Pinellas]] peninsula. Davis eventually published the study and, in 1889, he travelled to [[Tarpon Springs, Florida]]. He felt improvement in his muscular [[rheumatism]] and advertised for Florida in one of his medical journals. In Tarpon Springs he met Jacob Disston, the brother of Florida land baron [[Hamilton Disston]].&lt;ref name="Hartzell200652" /&gt; Davis and Disston combined to bring electricity to Tarpon Springs in 1895.&lt;ref name="Hartzell200653"&gt;Hartzell, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Davis married Elizabeth Irene Craven.&lt;ref name="Hartzell200651" /&gt;

Electricity had little impact on Tarpon Springs so Davis received an electricity [[Government-granted monopoly|franchise]] from St. Petersburg on February 2, 1897 and moved his plant there.  St. Petersburg's first wood-powered electrical service was initiated on August 5, 1897. On February 4, 1902, Davis was granted a trolley franchise by St. Petersburg.  He paid for trolley construction with funding from Jacob Disston and others, and by purchasing and re-selling the city's phone system.&lt;ref name="Hartzell200651" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hartzell200653" /&gt; Trolley construction began on May 30, 1904 and operation began four months later. In 1905, he expanded the trolley system to [[Disston City]]. Through his publishing company, Davis promoted the area with ''Florida'' magazine in 1905 and two books in 1906.&lt;ref name="Hartzell200653" /&gt; Continuing to expand his influence in St. Petersburg, Davis tore down the Brantley Pier and built the [[St. Petersburg Pier|Electric Pier]] in 1906.&lt;ref name="Hartzell200651" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hartzell200654"&gt;Hartzell, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pier"&gt;[http://www.stpetepier.com/history.php History] from The Pier web site.&lt;/ref&gt; He paid $80,000 for a 500-passenger steamboat named ''Favorite'' which first arrived on October 17, 1906 and was a popular attraction at the Electric Pier.&lt;ref name="Hartzell200654" /&gt;

Davis's progress - and St. Petersburg's in general - was hampered when Tampa tycoon, [[Henry B. Plant]], purchased the city's lifeline, the Orange Belt Railroad, in 1906.&lt;ref name="Hartzell200654" /&gt; Davis was dealt another blow by the banking [[panic of 1907]].&lt;ref name="Hartzell200651" /&gt; Two years later, he shifted control of much of his St. Petersburg holdings to his occasional rival, [[H. Walter Fuller]]. After a conflict over St. Petersburg waterfront area, Davis purchased {{convert|12800|acre|km2}} of Hamilton Disston's land around 1911 and established the city of Pinellas Park. Davis, his son, and P. J. McDevitt advertised the new city drawing people from Pennsylvania and Ohio. McDevitt became the city's first mayor.&lt;ref name="Hartzell200654" /&gt; Davis sold a free lot in Pinellas Park for every ten-acre farm purchased, resulting in 111 farm sales from 1910 to 1912.  Lack of drainage in Pinellas Park caused problems in August 1915 when {{convert|15|in|mm}} of rain fell.&lt;ref name="Hartzell200655" /&gt;

Davis died in Philadelphia from heart failure, reportedly due to [[World War I]] and concern over his estate. Jacob Disston closed out Davis's remaining holdings in Florida while his wife, Elizabeth, remained involved with F. A. Davis Company until her death in 1964.&lt;ref name="Hartzell200655" /&gt;

As seen in this photograph, the [[tributaries]] and [[distributaries]] of the Ganges and [[Brahmaputra River]]s deposit huge amounts of [[silt]] and [[clay]] that create a shifting maze of waterways and islands in the [[Bay of Bengal]].]]

The '''flood pulse concept''' explains how the periodic inundation and drought (flood pulse) control the lateral exchange of water, nutrients ad organisms between the main river channel (or lake) and the connected floodplain [https://www.nrem.iastate.edu/class/assets/aecl518/Discussion%20Readings/Junk_et_al._1989.pdf (Junk et al., 1989)]. The annual flood pulse is the most important aspect and the most biologically productive feature of a [[river]]'s [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref name=thorp&gt;Thorp, J. H., &amp; Delong, M. D. (1994). The Riverine Productivity Model: An Heuristic View of Carbon Sources and Organic Processing in Large River Ecosystems. Oikos , 305-308&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benke, A. C., Chaubey, I., Ward, G. M., &amp; Dunn, E. L. (2000). Flood Pulse Dynamics of an Unregulated River Floodplain in the Southeastern U.S. Coastal Plain. Ecology , 2730-2741.&lt;/ref&gt;, describing the movement, distribution and quality of water in [[river ecosystems]] and the dynamic interaction in the transition zone between water and land (aquatic/terrestrial transition zones - ATTZ). It contrasts with previous [[Ecological theory|ecological theories]] which considered [[floods]] to be catastrophic events.


==Background==
River floodplain systems consist of an area surrounding a river that is periodically flooded by the overflow of the river as well as by precipitation, called the aquatic/terrestrial transition zone (ATTZ).  The ATTZ is the area covered by water only during the flooding.&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;Johnson, Barry L., William B. Richardson, and Teresa J. Naimo. 1995. Past, Present, and Future Concepts in Large River Ecology. p. 134-141. In BioScience, Vol. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;  This flooding in turn creates unique habitat that is essential to the survival of many different species.&lt;ref name=junk&gt;Junk, W.J., P.B. Bayley, and R.E. Sparks. 1989. The flood pulse concept in river-floodplain systems. p. 110-127. In D.P. Dodge [ed.] Proceedings of the International Large River Symposium. Can. Spec. Publ. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; The flood pulse concept is unique because it incorporates the outlying rivers and streams which add a lateral aspect to previous concepts, e.g. the River Continuum Concept (RCC) that failed in explain processes that happen in big rives and their floodplains. From this lateral perspective, rivers can be seen as a collection of width-based water systems.&lt;ref name=thorp/&gt;

Flooding consists of multiple stages.  First, at the start of the flooding, nutrients rush in from the area where the flood begins.  During flood periods, the most important element is called the moving [[littoral]].  As flooding begins and water levels increase nutrients that have been [[Mineralization (geology)|mineralized]] in the dry phase are suspended with sediments in the flood waters and main river.  The moving littoral consists of the water from the shoreline to a few meters deep in the river.  This pulse of water is the primary driver of high productivity and decomposition rates as it moves nutrients in and out of the system and is good breeding ground for many species of [[estuarial]] organisms.&lt;ref name=junk/&gt; At this point in time production rates exceed decomposition rates.  As water levels stabilize, decomposition rates outpace production rates, frequently contributing to [[dissolved oxygen]] deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Bayley, Peter B. 1995. Understanding Large River: Floodplain Ecosystems. p. 153-158. In BioScience, Vol. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; When the water starts receding, the moving littoral reverses, concentrating nutrients and contributing to [[phytoplankton]] growth.

==Living communities and flood types==
The flood pulse helps maintain genetic and species diversity in the floodplain ecosystem, and it brings in oxygen to help fauna and decomposition.  The flood pulse also increases yields by increasing the surface area of water and showers the land with river biota.  Flood plain systems also serve as migration routes, [[hibernation]] spots, and [[spawning]] locations for many species.&lt;ref name=junk/&gt; For the [[red-bellied piranha]], their two annual reproductive seasons are dependent on the flooding pulse. However, the flood pulse has the potential to overpower some species; when flood pulses occur at unusual times or last for too long, terrestrial vegetation can be overwhelmed.&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt; Furthermore, the receding of the flood at the end of the flood pulse can lead to oxygen deficiency.

==Human impact==
River floodplain systems can be both natural and man-made; the latter occur when [[dams]] and [[levees]] create a flood plain.&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt; Humans have had several effects on the flood pulse.  Through ecosystem alterations such as dams, debris removal, channelization, levees, navigation, irrigation, contamination, logging, fire suppression, species introduction, and agricultural runoff, humans have contributed to the destruction of wetlands and the extinction of species.  Biota relies on the flood plain for food supply, spawning and shelter, and flood pulses that are too quick or slow interrupt this.  This can have devastating effects on [[riparian ecosystems]].&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt;&lt;ref name=junk/&gt;

==Criticisms and alternative concepts==
The flood pulse concept is one of three primary models describing large [[river ecosystem]]s.   The others include the [[river continuum concept]] (RCC) and the [[serial discontinuity concept]].&lt;ref name=thorp/&gt; Related theories include the [[nutrient spiraling concept]].&lt;ref&gt;Tockner, K., Malard, F., &amp; Ward, J. (2000). An extension of the flood pulse concept. Hydrological Process, 2861-2883.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many theorists have criticized the flood pulse concept and believe that other concepts could help explain the phenomena that occur in large rivers.  Some say that the flood pulse concept is inadequate because it only applies to [[temperate climate|temperate]] and [[tropical climate|tropical]] systems.&lt;ref name=junk/&gt; The flood pulse concept involves many assumptions; many theorists object to the concept on the basis of these assumptions.  The flood pulse concept assumes that all systems are either hierarchical or linear, that physical features control biological structures, and that there is [[dynamic equilibrium]] between the biological and the physical rhythms.&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt; Because of their criticisms of the flood pulse concept, some theorists prefer the river continuum concept.  However, Junk et al. argue that the river continuum concept is not sufficient because it is based on research done on small temperate streams and has mistakenly been applied to all water systems; furthermore, the river continuum concept does not explain habitats that fluctuate between lotic and [[lentic]] states, whereas the flood pulse concept adequately covers these systems.&lt;ref name=junk/&gt;

[[File:Hertzsprung-Russel StarData.png|upright=2|thumb|An HR diagram showing many well known stars in the Milky Way galaxy.]]

The '''HertzsprungâRussell diagram''', abbreviated as '''HâR diagram''', '''HR diagram''' or '''HRD''', is a [[scatter plot]] of [[star]]s showing the relationship between the stars' [[absolute magnitude]]s or [[luminosity|luminosities]] versus their [[stellar classification]]s or [[effective temperature]]s. More simply, it plots each star on a graph plotting the star's brightness against its temperature (color).

The diagram was created circa 1910 by [[Ejnar Hertzsprung]] and [[Henry Norris Russell]] and represents a major step towards an understanding of [[stellar evolution]].

The related '''colourâmagnitude diagram''' (CMD) plots the [[apparent magnitude]]s of stars against their colour, usually for a cluster so that the stars are all at the same distance.

==Historical background==
In the nineteenth-century large-scale photographic spectroscopic surveys of stars were performed at [[Harvard College Observatory]], producing spectral classifications for tens of thousands of stars, culminating ultimately in the [[Henry Draper Catalogue]].  In one segment of this work [[Antonia Maury]] included divisions of the stars by the width of their [[spectral line]]s.&lt;ref name=HCAn28&gt;{{cite journal | author1=A.C. Maury | author2=E.C. Pickering | journal=Annals of Harvard College Observatory | volume=28 | pages=1â128 | date=1897 | title=Spectra of bright stars photographed with the 11-inch Draper Telescope as part of the Henry Draper Memorial |bibcode = 1897AnHar..28....1M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hertzsprung noted that stars described with narrow lines tended to have smaller [[proper motion]]s than the others of the same spectral classification.  He took this as an indication of greater luminosity for the narrow-line stars, and computed [[Stellar parallax#Other baselines|secular parallaxes]] for several groups of these, allowing him to estimate their absolute magnitude.&lt;ref name=Hertzsprung1909&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hertzprung | first=Ejnar | journal=Astronomische Nachrichten | volume=179 | issue=24 | pages=373â380 | date=1908 | title=Ãber die Sterne der Unterabteilung ''c'' und ''ac'' nach der Spektralklassifikation von Antonia C. Maury | bibcode=1909AN....179..373H | doi=10.1002/asna.19081792402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910 Hans Rosenberg published a diagram plotting the apparent magnitude of stars in the Pleiades cluster against the strengths of the [[calcium K line]] and two [[hydrogen]] [[Balmer line]]s.&lt;ref name=rosenberg/&gt;  These spectral lines serve as a proxy for the temperature of the star, an early form of spectral classification.  The apparent magnitude of stars in the same cluster is equivalent to their absolute magnitude and so this early diagram was effectively a plot of luminosity against temperature.  The same type of diagram is still used today as a means of showing the stars in clusters without having to initially know their distance and luminosity.&lt;ref name=cluster&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/775/2/134| title = The Ages of 95 Globular Clusters as Determined Using an Improved &lt;math&gt;\Delta V^{HB}_{TO}&lt;/math&gt; Method Along with Color-Magnitude Diagram Constraints, and Their Implications for Broader Issues| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 775| issue = 2| pages = 134| year = 2013| last1 = Vandenberg | first1 = D.

This was also the form of the diagram using apparent magnitudes of a cluster of stars all at the same distance.&lt;ref name=hertzsprung&gt;Hertzsprung, E., 1911, Uber die Verwendung Photographischer Eï¬ektiver Wellenlaengen zur Bestimmung von Farbenaequivalenten, Publikationen des Astrophysikalischen Observatoriums zu Potsdam, 22.

Russell's early (1913) versions of the diagram included Maury's giant stars identified by Hertzsprung, those nearby stars with parallaxes measured at the time, stars from the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] (a nearby [[open cluster]]), and several [[moving groups]], for which the [[moving cluster method]] could be used to derive distances and thereby obtain absolute magnitudes for those stars.&lt;ref name=Russ1914PA&gt;{{cite journal | last=Russell | first=Henry Norris | journal=Popular Astronomy | volume=22 | pages=275â294 | date=1914 | title=Relations Between the Spectra and Other Characteristics of the Stars | bibcode=1914PA.....22..275R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms of diagram==
There are several forms of the HertzsprungâRussell diagram, and the [[nomenclature]] is not very well defined.  All forms share the same general layout: stars of greater luminosity are toward the top of the diagram, and stars with higher surface temperature are toward the left side of the diagram.

The original diagram displayed the spectral type of stars on the horizontal axis and the [[absolute magnitude|absolute visual magnitude]] on the vertical axis.  The spectral type is not a numerical quantity, but the sequence of spectral types is a [[monotonic function|monotonic series]] that reflects the stellar surface temperature.  Modern observational versions of the chart replace spectral type by a [[color index]] (in diagrams made in the middle of the 20th Century, most often the [[B-V color]]) of the stars.  This type of diagram is what is often called an observational HertzsprungâRussell diagram, or specifically a colorâmagnitude diagram (CMD), and it is often used by observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/astro801/content/l4_p6.html |title=The Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram |last=Palma |first=Dr. Christopher |date=2016 |website=ASTRO 801: Planets, Stars, Galaxies, and the Universe |publisher=John A. Dutton e-Education Institute: College of Earth and Mineral Sciences: The Pennsylvania State University |access-date=2017-01-29 |quote=The quantities that are easiest to measure... are color and magnitude, so most observers ... refer to the diagram as a 'ColorâMagnitude diagram' or 'CMD' rather than an HR diagram. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In cases where the stars are known to be at identical distances such as within a star cluster, a colorâmagnitude diagram is often used to describe the stars of the cluster with a plot in which the vertical axis is the [[apparent magnitude]] of the stars. For cluster members, by assumption there is a single additive constant difference between their apparent and absolute magnitudes, called the [[distance modulus]], for all of that cluster of stars.  Early studies of nearby open clusters (like the Hyades and [[Pleiades]]) by Hertzsprung and Rosenberg produced the first CMDs, antedating by a few years Russell's influential synthesis of the diagram collecting data for all stars for which absolute magnitudes could be determined.&lt;ref name=rosenberg&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rosenberg | first=Hans | journal=Astronomische Nachrichten | volume=186 | issue=5 | pages=71â78 | date=1910| title=Ãber den Zusammenhang von Helligkeit und Spektraltypus in den Plejaden | bibcode=1910AN....186...71R |doi = 10.1002/asna.19101860503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hertzsprung/&gt;

Another form of the diagram plots the [[effective temperature|effective surface temperature]] of the star on one axis and the luminosity of the star on the other, almost invariably in a [[log-log plot]].  Theoretical calculations of [[stellar structure]] and the [[Stellar evolution#Models|evolution of stars]] produce plots that match those from observations. This type of diagram could be called ''temperature-luminosity diagram'', but this term is hardly ever used; when the distinction is made, this form is called the ''theoretical HertzsprungâRussell diagram'' instead.  A peculiar characteristic of this form of the HâR diagram is that the temperatures are plotted from high temperature to low temperature, which aids in comparing this form of the HâR diagram with the observational form.

Although the two types of diagrams are similar, astronomers make a sharp distinction between the two.  The reason for this distinction is that the exact transformation from one to the other is not trivial.  To go between effective temperature and color requires a [[Color temperature#Color temperature in astronomy|colorâtemperature relation]], and constructing that is difficult; it is known to be a function of [[stellar chemistry|stellar composition]] and can be affected by other factors like [[stellar rotation]].  When converting luminosity or absolute [[bolometric magnitude]] to apparent or absolute visual magnitude, one requires a [[bolometric correction]], which may or may not come from the same source as the colorâtemperature relation.  One also needs to know the distance to the observed objects (''i.e.'', the distance modulus) and the effects of [[Extinction (astronomy)|interstellar obscuration]], both in the color (reddening) and in the apparent magnitude (where the effect is called "extinction").  Color distortion (including reddening) and extinction (obscuration) are also apparent in stars having significant [[circumstellar dust]].  The ideal of direct comparison of theoretical predictions of stellar evolution to observations thus has additional uncertainties incurred in the conversions between theoretical quantities and observations.

==Interpretation==
[[File:HR-diag-instability-strip.svg|thumb|An HR diagram with the [[instability strip]] and its components highlighted.]]
Most of the stars occupy the region in the diagram along the line called the [[main sequence]]. During the stage of their lives in which stars are found on the main sequence line, they are [[Protonâproton chain reaction|fusing hydrogen]] in their cores. The next concentration of stars is on the [[horizontal branch]] ([[helium fusion]] in the core and hydrogen burning in a shell surrounding the core). Another prominent feature is the [[Hertzsprung gap]] located in the region between A5 and G0 spectral type and between +1 and â3 absolute magnitudes (''i.e.'' between the top of the main sequence and the giants in the [[horizontal branch]]). [[RR Lyrae variable]] stars can be found in the left of this gap on a section of the diagram called the [[instability strip]]. [[Cepheid variable]]s also fall on the instability strip, at higher luminosities.

The H-R diagram can be used by scientists to roughly measure how far away a [[star cluster]] or [[galaxy]] is from Earth. This can be done by comparing the apparent magnitudes of the stars in the cluster to the absolute magnitudes of stars with known distances (or of model stars). The observed group is then shifted in the vertical direction, until the two main sequences overlap. The difference in magnitude that was bridged in order to match the two groups is called the [[distance modulus]] and is a direct measure for the distance (ignoring [[extinction (astronomy)|extinction]]). This technique is known as [[main sequence fitting]] and is a type of [[spectroscopic parallax]]. Not only the turn-off in the main sequence can be used, but also the tip of the red giant branch stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Da Costa |first1=G. S. |last2=Armandroff |first2=T.

==Diagram's role in the development of stellar physics==
{{See also|stellar nucleosynthesis}}
[[File:Open cluster HR diagram ages.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|HR diagrams for two [[open cluster]]s, [[Open Cluster M67|M67]] and [[NGC 188]], showing the [[main sequence|main-sequence]] turn-off at different ages.]]
Contemplation of the diagram led astronomers to speculate that it might demonstrate [[stellar evolution]], the main suggestion being that stars collapsed from red giants to dwarf stars, then moving down along the line of the main sequence in the course of their lifetimes. Stars were thought therefore to radiate energy by converting gravitational energy into radiation through the [[KelvinâHelmholtz mechanism]]. This mechanism resulted in an age for the Sun of only tens of millions of years, creating a conflict over the age of the Solar System between astronomers, and biologists and geologists who had evidence that the Earth was far older than that. This conflict was only resolved in the 1930s when nuclear fusion was identified as the source of stellar energy.

Following Russell's presentation of the diagram to a meeting of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] in 1912, [[Arthur Eddington]] was inspired to use it as a basis for developing ideas on [[stellar physics]]. In 1926, in his book ''The Internal Constitution of the Stars'' he explained the physics of how stars fit on the diagram.&lt;ref name=eddington&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Internal Constitution of the Stars |first=A. S. |last=Eddington |journal=The Scientific Monthly |volume=11 |issue=4 |date=Oct 1920 |pages=297â303 |jstor=6491|bibcode=1920SciMo..11..297E }}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper anticipated the later discovery of [[nuclear fusion]] and correctly proposed that the star's source of power was the combination of hydrogen into helium, liberating enormous energy. This was a particularly remarkable jump of insight, since at that time the source of a star's energy was still unsolved, [[Nuclear fusion|thermonuclear energy]] had not been proven to exist, and even that stars are largely composed of [[hydrogen]] (see [[metallicity]]), had not yet been discovered. Eddington managed to sidestep this problem by concentrating on the [[thermodynamics]] of [[thermal radiation|radiative transport]] of energy in stellar interiors.&lt;ref name=eddington2&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1916MNRAS..77...16E |title=On the radiative equilibrium of the stars |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=77|pages=16â35 |author1=Eddington |first1=A. S. |year=1916 |doi=10.1093/mnras/77.1.16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eddington predicted that dwarf stars remain in an essentially static position on the main sequence for most of their lives. In the 1930s and 1940s, with an understanding of hydrogen fusion, came an evidence-backed theory of evolution to red giants following which were speculated cases of explosion and implosion of the remnants to white dwarfs. The term [[supernova nucleosynthesis]] is used to describe the creation of elements during the evolution and explosion of a pre-supernova star, a concept put forth by [[Fred Hoyle]] in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=F. |last=Hoyle |title=On Nuclear Reactions Occurring in Very Hot Stars.

[[File:Esbit brand Hexamine tablets.JPG|thumb|Esbit brand Hexamine tablets]]

A '''hexamine fuel tablet''' is a form of [[solid fuel]] in [[:wikt:tablet|tablet]] form. The tablets burn smokelessly, have a high [[energy density]], do not liquefy while burning and leave no [[ash]]es. Invented in Murrhardt, [[Germany]], in 1936, the main component is [[hexamethylenetetramine|hexamine]], which was discovered by [[Aleksandr Butlerov]] in 1859. Some fuel tablets use [[1,3,5-Trioxane|1,3,5-trioxane]] as another ingredient.

A number of alternative names are in use, including '''heat tablet''' and '''Esbit'''. Esbit is a [[genericized trademark]] as it is used to refer to similar products made by other companies. In most countries from the former Soviet bloc this is known as "dry [[alcohol]]".

== Uses ==
The tablets are used for cooking by [[camping|campers]], the military and relief organizations. They are often used with [[hexamine stove|disposable metal stoves]] that are included with [[field ration]] packs. Backpackers concerned with ultra light gear tend to buy or make their own much lighter stove.  An Esbit [[beverage-can stove]] can be made by cutting off the bottom of an aluminium soft drink can, and turning it upside down to support the fuel tablet. A pot can be supported above this with a circle of [[chicken wire]] or metal tent pegs.  The burning tablets are sensitive to wind, so a simple windscreen should be used, such as a strip of aluminium foil curved in a circle around the pot and stove.  If necessary, the fuel tablet can be placed on a rock or on the dirt, with a pot supported above it by rocks, but this is less than ideal.

Another common use is to provide a relatively safe (see disadvantages below) heat source for model [[steam engine]]s, such as those manufactured by [[Wilesco]] and [[Mamod]], and other external combustion engines such as [[Stirling engine]]s and [[pop pop boat]]s.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Hexamine is prepared by the reaction of [[formaldehyde]] and [[ammonia]]. In an acid environment hexamine is converted to toxic formaldehyde, which the main hazard for [[toxicity]] is by [[ingestion]].

Fuel tablets are simple, ultra-lightweight compared to other stove options, and compact; the entire stove system and fuel can be stored inside a 0.5 litre cooking pot. As with trioxane, hexamine has an almost infinite shelf life if stored properly, in a sealed dry container. However, the heat given off cannot be easily adjusted, so water can be boiled, but cooking requiring [[simmering]] is more difficult. Tablets are a powerful stove fuel (30.0 MJ/kg), and are sensitive to wind and dampness. Fuel tablets are expensive and are not as widely available compared to alternatives such as alcohol or petrol,  but can use very cheap stoves. 

Esbit's Material Safety Data Sheet states combustion can create [[formaldehyde]], [[ammonia]], [[nitrogen oxide]], [[hydrogen cyanide]] and ingestion may cause [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], gastrointestinal disturbances, and [[kidney damage]].  When burned, the chemical oxidation of the fuel yields noxious fumes, requiring foods being cooked to be contained in a receptacle such as a pot or pan with a tight fitting lid.  Burned tablets leave a sticky dark [[:wikt:residue|residue]] on the bottom of pots. If tablets are stored or used under damp conditions then they can break up while burning and shed burning fragments, although this claim is hard to verify or reproduce.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Hexamine is a precursor for the simplest synthesis of the chemical explosive [[RDX]]; in many areas its availability is tightly regulated due to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/696156/Selling_chemical_products_responsibly_leaflet.pdf|title=You can make a difference! - Sell chemical products responsibly|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gov.uk|publisher=[[Home Office]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hydrogen-bridged cations''' are a type of charged species in which a hydrogen atom is simultaneously bonded to two atoms through partial [[sigma bond]]s. While best observable in the presence of [[superacids]] at room temperature, [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] evidence has suggested that hydrogen-bridged cations exist in ordinary [[solvent]]s. These ions have been the subject of debate as they constitute a type of charged species of uncertain [[electronic structure]].&lt;ref name="textbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Bernard|last2=Prasad|first2=Rajendra|title=Advanced Organic Chemistry|date=2006|publisher=Pearson Education|location=India|isbn=81-7758-296-8|pages=183â184|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
Two models provide an explanation of their structure, the classical and the non-classical view. The classical view (Figure 1.a) involves a fast-equilibrating system in which a hydrogen atom rapidly shifts between two adjacent carbon atoms. In this model, fast equilibrium results from a low energy barrier between the two conformations of the molecule, and each conformer has a localized positive charge. The [[Potential energy surface|potential energy]] diagram of this model is characterized by a double-well with two energy minima.

The non-classical view (Figure 1.b) involves the [[Delocalized electron|delocalization]] of two electrons over three atoms (1 hydrogen and 2 carbon atoms). The model is characterized by a 3-membered ring where a hydrogen atom is located between two other atoms with partial sigma bonds. The potential energy diagram of this model is characterized by a single energy minimum, where the structure of the cation corresponds to the transition state between the two conformers of the classical view.

==History==

For several decades after they were first proposed around 1950, the existence and importance of non-classical ions in organic chemistry was bitterly controversial. As hydrogen bridges discussed here are 3 center (3 atom) - 2 electron bonds, the investigations over the possibilities of such systems laid an important framework from which to understand this bonding. Many of these studies centered around the [[2-Norbornyl cation|2-norbornyl cation]]. Observations made by [[Saul Winstein]] and others suggested that highly delocalized and symmetric intermediates were present in the reactions of various substituted norbornyl cations, evidence for non-classical ions. [[Herbert C. Brown|H. C. Brown]], the most outspoken opponent of non-classical ions, believed that such non-classical bonding was invoked far too widely and saw no reason to deviate from the classical idea of rapidly equilibrating, discrete [[carbocations]].&lt;ref name="H. C. Brown book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Herbert C.|title=The Nonclassical Ion Problem|date=1977|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4613-4120-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, [[George Andrew Olah|G. Olah]] was able to directly observe the 2-norbornyl cation by low-temperature NMR and confirm the presence of a non-classical 2-norbornyl cation, allowing the field to reach some conclusions about the possibilities of 3 center - 2 electron bonds involving carbon.&lt;ref name="Olah"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olah|first1=G.

[[File:Classical and Non-classical Interpretations of Bonding in the 2-Norbornyl Cation.jpg|The classical and non-classical models for bonding in the 2-norbornyl cation. The non-classical model (a) shows one three-center two-electron bond with a delocalized positive charge. The classical model, (b) describes a rapid equilibration between three distinct carbocations rather than delocalization. In 1973 Olah confirmed the validity of the non-classical model in this system.]]

'''Scheme 1''' - The classical and non-classical models for bonding in the 2-norbornyl cation are shown above. The non-classical model (a) shows one three-center two-electron bond with a delocalized positive charge. The classical model, (b) describes a rapid equilibration between three distinct carbocations rather than delocalization.

== Structure ==
Two different types of C-H-C bonding are recognized. The first is an "open" type, entailing linear geometry and negligible bonding between the terminal carbon atoms, while the second is the "closed" type, with triangular geometry allowing bonding interaction between terminal carbons.&lt;ref name="McMurry" /&gt; The relationship between these two types of 3-center 2-electron bonding can be shown through a molecular orbital diagram. Because of the additional overlap between the orbitals, the bonding orbital for the "closed" type is pushed lower in energy relative to the "open" type. The presence of two electrons in this system implies that the closed geometry will be energetically favorable, which has been seen in studies of metal-H-metal systems.&lt;ref name="Bau"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bau|first1=R.|last2=Teller|first2=R. G.|last3=Kirtley|first3=S. W.|last4=Koetzle|first4=T. F.|title=Structures of Transition-Metal Hydride Complexes|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|volume=12|date=1979|issue=12|pages=176â183|doi=10.1021/ar50137a003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Molecular Orbitals and Structure of Hydrogen Bridged Cations.jpg|Molecular orbitals of two types of hydrogen bridged cations with carbon that are structurally distinct. The open and closed structures show different orbital overlap which leads to different bonding energy.]]

'''Figure 2''' - A molecular orbital diagram for open and closed hydrogen bridged cations with carbon is shown above. The open and closed structures show different orbital overlap which leads to different bonding energy.

===Closed C-H-C Bonds===
In closed 3 center 2 electron bonds, the atoms are arranged in a triangular shape to increase orbital overlap as shown above. Because there are only two electrons in the system, this overlap causes a net reduction in energy relative to the open, linear bond.&lt;ref name="McMurry" /&gt; While the closed C-H-C bond has not been isolated or studied, it is well established that hydrogen-bridged ''metals'' prefer the closed triangular bonding pattern. One example of closed C-H-C bonding is seen in the detection of "protonated ethene" through mass spectrometry, {{chem|C|2|C|7|+}}, with the bridging hydrogen sitting atop the Ï-bond of ethene. These closed bridges are likely short-lived intermediates, as there is no steric hindrance to prevent further reaction.

===Open C-H-C bonds===
While supposedly less favored energetically, the steric properties of some molecules promote the formation of open C-H-C bridges, as shown below in Scheme 2. In 1978 T.S. Sorenson obtained NMR evidence for hydrido-bridged carbocations with 3-center 2-electron bonds through using the 1,6-dimethyl-1-cyclodecyl cation.&lt;ref name="Sorensen" /&gt; The steric restriction of the ten-membered ring allowed the formation of a bridging hydrogen species. Expanding upon this approach, in 1992 [[John E. McMurry|McMurry]] developed the ''in''-bicyclo[4,4,4]-1-tetradecyl cation, where the additional ring vastly improved the stability of the molecule by maintain a more rigid structure around the hydrogen bridge.&lt;ref name="McMurry" /&gt;

== Synthesis ==
While they are reactive intermediates, hydrogen bridged cations can be stabilized sterically. Hydrogen bridged cations are generally formed by producing a carbocation through the addition of a proton to an alcohol or alkene. Instead of continuing the reaction through the nucleophile addition of the conjugate base to the carbocation, a neighboring C-H bond can interact with the carbocation to form the hydrogen bridge. In Sorensen's 1978 synthesis and observation of the 1,6-dimethyl-1-cyclododecyl anion, the hydroxyl group of 1,6-dimethyl-1-cyclodecanol was removed using [[fluorosulfonic acid]].&lt;ref name="Sorensen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirchen|first1=Robert T.|last2=Sorensen|first2=Ted S.|title=The 1,6-dimethylcyclodecyl cation. Nuclear magnetic resonance evidence for a 1,6-Âµ-hydrido structure|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society|date=1978|issue=17|pages=769â770|doi=10.1039/C39780000769}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed the formation of the 1,6 hydrogen bridge. With McMurry's ''in''-bicyclo[4.4.4]-tetradecyl cation, the alkene across from the methyne hydrogen was protonated by [[trifluoroacetic acid]] (TFA) to allow a bridge to the tertiary carbocation bridgehead.&lt;ref name="McMurry"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McMurry|first1=John E.|last2=Leckta|first2=Thomas|title=Three-Center, Two-Electron C-H-C Bonds in Organic Chemistry|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|date=1992|volume=25|issue=1|pages=47â53|doi=10.1021/ar00013a007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sorensen in 1978 and (b) the in-bicyclo[4.4.4]-1-tetradecyl cation which J. E. McMurry synthesized in 1992. Both involve the use of a strong acid to form a linear 3 center-2 electron bond.]]

'''Scheme 2''' - Final steps in the synthesis of (a) 1,6-dimethyl-1-cyclodecyl cation, first characterized by T.S. Sorensen in 1978 and (b) the in-bicyclo[4.4.4]-1-tetradecyl cation which J. E. McMurry synthesized in 1992. Both involve the use of a strong acid to form a linear 3 center-2 electron bond.

In both cases, the final step used an extremely strong acid to form a carbocation across the molecule from the hydrogen to be bridged. In Sorensen's use of fluorosulfonic acid, a hydroxyl group leaves to form a tertiary carbocation. With TFA, an alkene is protonated, again causing the creation of the carbocation bridgehead. However, the stability of McMurry's ''in''-bycyclo[4.4.4]-tetradecyl cation allows the alkene to be protonated with much weaker acids as well. Even in pure acetic acid, the alkene is protonated to about 50% as determined with NMR.

Hydrogen-bridged cations have been implicated in the [[Annulation|transannular]] migration of hydrogens. It has been noticed that the transannular rearrangement in the reaction between an acid and a [[cycloalkene]] always results in ''cis'' addition of the [[nucleophile]]. Presumably, the [[stereoselectivity]] of this type of reaction comes from a nucleophilic attack on a hydrogen-bridged cation (Scheme 1). In this model, the electron cloud of the hydrogen bridge prevents the nucleophile from having accessibility to that side of the molecule, thus forcing it to attack from a ''cis'' orientation with respect to the initial proton.&lt;ref name="textbook" /&gt;

== Characterization ==

=== Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy ===
The most significant trait of bridging hydrogens in NMR spectra is their upfield shift. Due to the increased number of bonds that the hydrogen atom is part of, the higher electron density around hydrogen shields the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nucleus, causing its chemical shift to appear at negative ppm. Characterization of the dimethylcyclodecyl ion by Sorensen in 1978 relied on low-temperature NMR, as the ion slowly decomposes at above -70&amp;nbsp;Â°C, and showed the bridging hydrogen at Î´ -3.9.&lt;ref name="Sorensen" /&gt; McMurry's characterization of the more stable ''in''-bicyclo[4,4,4]-tetradecyl cation showed two broad 12 proton peaks at Î´ 2.5 and 1.9, and a broad proton singlet at Î´ -3.46. Depending on the length of bridging chains in a similar bridged bicyclo[3,3,1]-nonyl cations the upfield shift of the bridging hydrogen can vary from Î´ -6.50 to 0.07. This is actually due to a change in C-H-C bond angle, where change in bond angle affects the bonding nature of the 3 center-2 electron bond.&lt;ref name="McMurry" /&gt;

[[File:Classical versus Non-classical Bonding of the in-Bicyclo(4.4.4)-1-tetradecyl Cation.jpg|The classical and non-classical bonding of the in-bicyclo[4.4.4]-1-tetradecyl cation. The non-classical model (a) shows one hydrogen bridged molecule while the classical model (b) would imply rapid interconversion between two distinct carbocations and lack the hydrogen bridge. McMurry confirmed the presence of the 3-center 2-electron bond and the hydrogen bridged species by NMR.]]

'''Scheme 4''' - The classical and non-classical bonding of the in-bicyclo[4.4.4]-1-tetradecyl cation are shown above. The non-classical model (a) shows one hydrogen bridged molecule while the classical model (b) would imply rapid interconversion between two distinct carbocations and lack the hydrogen bridge. McMurry confirmed the presence of the 3-center 2-electron bond and the hydrogen bridged species by NMR.

=== Infrared (IR) spectroscopy ===

An asymmetric C-H-C stretching band at 2213&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt; was observed in McMurry's synthesis.&lt;ref name="McMurry" /&gt; This was assigned through observation of a 1558&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt; replacing the 2113&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt; band upon substitution of the ''in''-hydrogen with ''in''-deuterium. Because the isotropic shift was observed while all other peaks remained constant, the two peaks were able to be assigned to the bridging hydrogen or deuterium. The energy of 2133&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt; for the C-H-C stretching is lower than typical for C-H bonds as a result of adding a third body to the oscillating system.

== Hydrogen-bridged radical cation catalysis ==

Hydrogen-Bridged cations have been implicated in the [[catalysis]] of [[isomerization]] of [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]] species. This mechanism involves the transformation of a radical ion into its lower-energy hydrogen-shifted isomer using a neutral molecule as the catalyst.&lt;ref name="Gauld 96"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gauld|first1=James|last2=Audier|first2=Henri|last3=Fossey|first3=Jacques|last4=Radom|first4=Leo|title=Water-Catalyzed Interconversion of Conventional and Distonic Radical Cations: Methanol and Methyleneoxonium Radical Cation|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=1996|volume=118|issue=26|pages=6299â6300|doi=10.1021/ja960924f}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for a catalyst is the result of a large [[Activation energy|energy barrier]] that prevents spontaneous interconversion of the protonated species.&lt;ref name="review" /&gt; While [[1,2-rearrangement|1,2-alkyl shifts.]] of radical species are fully allowed processes and do not involve the formation of a hydrogen-bridged cation intermediate, these intermediates have been proposed to provide a feasible low-energy pathway for forbidden 1,3-alkyl shifts.&lt;ref name="review" /&gt;

=== Proton-transfer catalysis ===

The term Proton-Transfer Catalysis (PTC) was first introduced by Diethard K. Bhome in 1992.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jobst|first1=Karl|last2=Trikoupis|first2=Moschoula|title=Catalysis in hydrogen-bridged radical cations|journal=European Journal of Mass Spectrometry|date=2012|volume=18|issue=2|pages=183â194|doi=10.1255/ejms.1163}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this process, a neutral [[molecule]] transports a proton from a high- to a low-energy site of a protonated radical to catalyze its isomerization.&lt;ref name="Bohme 92"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bohme|first1=Diethard|title=Proton transport in the catalyzed gas-phase isomerization of protonated molecules|journal=International Journal of Mass Spectrometry and Ion Processes|date=1992|volume=115|issue=2â3|pages=95â110|doi=10.1016/0168-1176(92)85035-X|bibcode=1992IJMSI.115...95B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first confirmed example of PTC was the isomerization of the methylene [[oxonium ion]].&lt;ref name="review" /&gt;

The two species involved in this mechanism are the more stable distonic methylene oxonium ion (&lt;sup&gt;â¢&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and the less stable ionized [[methanol]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH&lt;sup&gt;+â¢&lt;/sup&gt;) species. These two species are separated by a large (108.4&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol) energy barrier that prevents their spontaneous interconversion.&lt;ref name="Gauld 96" /&gt; However, it was observed that when ionized methanol interacts with water in the chemical ionization source of a [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]], it readily transforms into the more stable [[distonic ion]].

A hydrogen-bridged cation was proposed to be responsible for this isomerization (Scheme 5).&lt;ref name="Audier Mechanism 94"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Audier|first1=Henri|last2=Leblanc|first2=Danielle|last3=Mourgues|first3=Phillippe|last4=McMahon|first4=Terry|last5=Hammerum|first5=Steen|title=Catalysed Isomerization of Simple Radical Cations in the Gas Phase|journal=J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun.|issue=20|pages=2329|date=1994|doi=10.1039/C39940002329}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Gauld modeled the potential energy surfaces of this reaction using water as a spectator molecule and as a mode of proton transport. This study determined that a transition state in the mechanism of water as a spectator ion (no hydrogen bridge) posed an energy barrier of 115&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol (higher than that for spontaneous isomerization).&lt;ref name="Gauld 96" /&gt; Water-mediated isomerization was modeled with a 3- and a 5-membered transition state hydrogen-bridged cation. These models only posed energy barriers of 12.3 and 8.5&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, respectively (Scheme 6).&lt;ref name="Gauld 96" /&gt; Since a spectator-water model resulted in a higher energy barrier, it was established that the PTC mechanism proposed by Audier and Mourgues with hydrogen-bridged cations is energetically plausible, thus supporting the existence of a hydrogen bridge.

'''Scheme 6''' - 3-membered and 5-membered transition states for the isomerization of ionized methanol to the methylene oxonium ion.

The requirements for the neutral molecule catalyst is that it must be basic enough to deprotonate one site of the ionic species, but sufficiently weak to donate the proton to a different atom on the substrate ion.&lt;ref name="review" /&gt; This is best exemplified by considering the [[proton affinity]] of the neutral molecule. For example, the PA value of water is 690&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, which is found between the PA of the carbon (670&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol) and that of the oxygen (699&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol) in CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH&lt;sup&gt;â¢&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="review" /&gt; In this example, the water molecule is basic enough to deprotonate the carbon atom, and acidic enough to donate the proton back but to the oxygen atom, thus facilitating the isomerization of the original species.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2897">Prof '''Magnus Maclean''' [[FRSE]] MIEE MICE LLD(1857-1937) was an electrical engineer who assisted [[Lord Kelvin]] in his electrical experiments and later became Professor of Electrical Engineering in Glasgow (one of the first to hold such a title). He also lectured in Celtic Studies at [[Glasgow University]]. The '''Magnus Maclean Memorial Prize''' given to students of electrical engineering is named in his honour.

==Life==

He was born on the isle of [[Skye]] on 1 November 1857. He was educated at [[Colbost]] on the island then sent to [[Glasgow]] for secondary education. He then began training as a Free Church minister at the Free Church Training College in Glasgow and also studied at [[Glasgow University]]. However, her abandoned this after two years and became a teacher in Sutherland.

Re-entering Glasgow University in 1881 with a Lorimer bursary for Mathematics, and a London Highland Society scholarship. He studied Natural Philosophy (Physics) and Mathematics  at [[Glasgow University]] graduating MA around 1883.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH9778&amp;type=P&lt;/ref&gt;

From at least 1880 he was the personal assistant to [[William Thomson, Lord Kelvin]] in his electrical experiments. In 1888 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[William Thomson, Lord Kelvin]], [[William Jack (mathematician)|William Jack]], [[Thomas Muir (mathematician)|Thomas Muir]], and Thomas Gray. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783â2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899 he became Professor of Electrical Engineering at the Royal Technical College in Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;http://strathclyde.ica-atom.org/maclean-magnus-1857-1937-electrical-engineer&lt;/ref&gt;
Glasgow University gave him an honorary doctorate (LLD) in 1919.

In later life he lived at 51 Kersland Terrace in Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;Glasgow Post Office directory 1911-12&lt;/ref&gt;

He retired in 1924 and died on 2 September 1937.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH9778&amp;type=P&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic Recognition==

His painting by James Raeburn Middleton is held by [[Strathclyde University]].&lt;ref&gt;https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/magnus-maclean-18571937-155834&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Big Cranes Mitsubishi.jpg|thumb|upright|The Big Cranes at The Mitsubishi Dockyard Nagasaki, Meiji Period]]

In 1857, at the request of the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]], a group of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] engineers began work on the ''Nagasaki Yotetsusho'', a modern, Western-style [[foundry]] and shipyard near the Dutch settlement of [[Dejima]], at [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]].&lt;ref name="nsmw_history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhi.co.jp/en/nsmw/introduction/history/index.html|author=Nagasaki Shipyard &amp; Machinery Works|title=History|accessdate=2011-02-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807050917/http://www.mhi.co.jp/en/nsmw/introduction/history/index.html|archivedate=2011-08-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was renamed ''Nagasaki Seitetsusho'' in 1860, and construction was completed in 1861. Following the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868, the shipyard was placed under control of the new [[Government of Meiji Japan]]. The first dry dock was completed in 1879.

In 1884, [[Yataro Iwasaki]], the founder of Mitsubishi, leased the ''Nagasaki [[Ironworks|Seitetsusho]]'' from the Japanese government, renamed it the ''Nagasaki Shipyard &amp; Machinery Works'' and entered the shipbuilding business on a large scale. Iwasaki purchased the shipyards outright in 1887. In 1891, '''Mitsubishi Heavy Industries - Yokohama Machinery Works''' was started as ''Yokohama Dock Company, Ltd''. Its main business was ship repairs, to which it added ship servicing by 1897.&lt;ref name="ymw_outline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhi.co.jp/en/ydmw/introduction/outline/index.html|author=Yokohama Machinery Works|title=Outline|accessdate=2011-02-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807051657/http://www.mhi.co.jp/en/ydmw/introduction/outline/index.html|archivedate=2011-08-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works was renamed ''Mitsubishi Shipyard of Mitsubishi [[GÅshi gaisha|Goshi Kaisha]]'' in 1893 and additional [[dry dock]]s were completed in 1896 and 1905.&lt;ref name="nsmw_history" /&gt;

The '''Mitsubishi Heavy Industries - Shimonoseki Shipyard &amp; Machinery Works''' was established in 1914. It produced industrial machinery and merchant ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhi.co.jp/en/ssmw/introduction/outline/index.html|author=Shimonoseki Shipyard &amp; Machinery Works|title=Outline|accessdate=2011-02-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807052446/http://www.mhi.co.jp/en/ssmw/introduction/outline/index.html|archivedate=2011-08-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nagasaki company was renamed ''Mitsubishi Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Company, Ltd.'' in 1917 and again renamed as ''Mitsubishi Heavy Industries'' in 1934. It became the largest private firm in Japan, active in the manufacture of ships, heavy machinery, airplanes and railway cars. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries merged with the Yokohama Dock Company in 1935.&lt;ref name="ymw_outline" /&gt; From its inception, the Mitsubishi Nagasaki shipyards were heavily involved in contracts for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. The  largest [[battleship]] [[Japanese battleship Musashi|''Musashi'']] was completed at Nagasaki in 1942.

The ''Kobe Shipyard of Mitsubishi Goshi Kaisha'' was established in 1905. The Kobe Shipyard merged with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in 1934. The Kobe Shipyard constructed the ocean liner ''Argentina Maru'' (later repurposed as the [[aircraft carrier]] ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaiyo|Kaiyo]]''), and the submarines the  ''[[Japanese submarine I-19|I-19]]'' and ''[[Japanese submarine I-25|I-25]]''.&lt;ref name="ksmw_history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhi.co.jp/en/kobe/introduction/history/briefhistory/index.html|author=Kobe Shipyard &amp; Machinery Works|title=Brief History|accessdate=2011-03-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807052529/http://www.mhi.co.jp/en/kobe/introduction/history/briefhistory/index.html|archivedate=2011-08-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the dissolution of the ''[[zaibatsu]]'' after the [[surrender of Japan]] at the end of [[World War II]], Mitsubishi divided into three companies. Mitsubishi Nagasaki became ''West Japan Heavy Industries, Ltd.'' The Nagasaki Shipyard was renamed ''Mitsubishi Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Co., Ltd.'' in 1952.&lt;ref name="nsmw_history" /&gt; The Mitsubishi Kobe Shipyard became ''Central Japan Heavy Industries, Ltd.'' in 1950.&lt;ref name="ksmw_history" /&gt;

In 1964, the three independent companies from the 1950 break-up were merged again into one company under the name of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. The Nagasaki works was renamed the ''Nagasaki Shipyard &amp; Engine Works''. The Kobe works was renamed the '''Mitsubishi Heavy Industries - Kobe Shipyard &amp; Machinery Works'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhi.co.jp/en/kobe/introduction/outline/index.html|author=Kobe Shipyard &amp; Machinery Works|title=Outline|accessdate=2011-02-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807052202/http://www.mhi.co.jp/en/kobe/introduction/outline/index.html|archivedate=2011-08-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, MHI's automobile parts department became an independent company as [[Mitsubishi Motors]].

In 1974, its Tokyo headquarters was targeted in a [[1974 Mitsubishi Heavy Industries bombing|bombing that killed eight people]].

MHI participated in a Â¥540 billion emergency rescue of Mitsubishi Motors in January 2005, in partnership with [[Mitsubishi Corporation]] and [[Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group]].&lt;ref name=nyt29105&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/28/business/worldbusiness/28iht-mitsu.html|title=Mitsubishi's rocky road|accessdate=17 July 2012|publisher=The New York Times| date=29 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4214655.stm|title=Mitsubishi seeks $5.2bn bail out |accessdate=17 July 2012|publisher=BBC News| date=28 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the rescue, MHI acquired Â¥50 billion of Mitsubishi Motors stock, increasing its ownership stake to 15 percent and making the automaker an affiliate again.&lt;ref name="nyt29105" /&gt;

In October 2009, MHI announced an order for up to 100 regional jets from the United States-based airline [[Trans States Holdings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/mitsubishi-announces-order-for-100-regional-jets-20091002-ggbh.html|title=Mitsubishi announces order for 100 regional jets|accessdate=17 July 2012|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald| date=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/10/02/mitsubishi-idUKT30518320091002|title=Japan jet business gets boost with big US order|accessdate=17 July 2012|publisher=Reuters| date=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MHI entered talks with [[Hitachi]] in August 2011 about a potential merger of the two companies, in what would have been the largest merger between two Japanese companies in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/08/04/uk-hitachi-mitsubishi-idUKTRE7730FY20110804|title=Hitachi, Mitsubishi edge towards groundbreaking merger|accessdate=17 July 2012|publisher=Reuters| date=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14398128|title=Shares of Hitachi and Mitsubishi Heavy get merger boost|accessdate=17 July 2012|publisher=BBC News| date=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The talks subsequently broke down and were suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/05/mhi-shares-idUST9E7IB02L20110805|title=Mitsubishi Heavy, Hitachi shares tumble as merger talks stall|accessdate=17 July 2012|publisher=Reuters| date=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Hitachi agreed to merge their thermal power generation businesses into a joint venture to be owned 65% by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and 35% by Hitachi.&lt;ref name=bbc301112&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20551428|title=Hitachi and Mitsubishi Heavy shares rise after merger|accessdate=11 December 2012|publisher=BBC News| date=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jt301112&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nb20121130n2.html|title=MHI, Hitachi plan to merge thermal power units to boost overseas sales|accessdate=11 December 2012|publisher=The Japan Times| date=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The joint venture began operations in February 2014.&lt;ref name="bbc301112" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jt301112" /&gt;

In June 2014  [[Siemens]] and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries announced their formation of joint ventures to bid for [[Alstom]]'s troubled energy and transportation businesses (in locomotives, steam turbines, and aircraft engines).  A rival bid by [[General Electric]] (GE) has been criticized by French government sources, who consider Alstom's operations as a "vital national interest" at a moment when the French unemployment level stands above 10% and some voters are turning towards the far-right.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/16/us-alstom-siemens-offer-idUSKBN0ER0MC20140616   Jens Hack and Natalie Huet, "Siemens and Mitsubishi challenge GE with Alstom offer", ''Reuters'' (June 16 2014).]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerospace===
MHI has aerospace facilities in [[Nagoya]], [[Aichi]], [[Komaki, Aichi]] and [[Mississauga, Ontario, Canada]].

In the 1950s the company began to re-enter the aerospace industry in earnest. Along with other major Japanese companies it was involved in design and production of the [[NAMC YS-11]], the first Japanese airliner to enter production after World War II.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.airliners.net/aircraft-data/namc-ys-11/287 NAMC YS-11] ''airliners.net'' Retrieved December 7, 2016 &lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 work started on the design of the [[Mitsubishi MU-2]], which became the company's first postwar aircraft design.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.airliners.net/aircraft-data/mitsubishi-mu-2/288 Mitsubishi MU-2] ''airliners.net'' Retrieved December 7, 2016 &lt;/ref&gt; 

In the defense sector, MHI has produced jet fighters for the [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]] and anti-submarine helicopters for the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]], as well as aero-engines, missiles and torpedoes. It produced [[North American F-86 Sabre]], [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] and [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]] fighters. It manufactured 139 [[Mitsubishi F-15J]] fighter aircraft from 1981 and produced 200 [[Sikorsky S-70]] family [[Mitsubishi H-60]] helicopters from 1989, in both cases under license production. The company also plays an important role in the Japanese Ballistic Missile Defense System program. 

In the space systems sector, MHI is the producer of the [[H-IIA]] and [[H-IIB]] launch vehicles, Japan's main rockets, and provides launch services to [[JAXA]] related to the launch vehicles. The company is also involved in the [[International Space Station]] program.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

On 1 April 2008, MHI established [[Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation]] as a subsidiary to develop and produce the MRJ or [[Mitsubishi Regional Jet]], a 70 to 90 passenger regional airliner. MHI is the majority shareholder of the new company, with [[Toyota|Toyota Motor Corporation]] owning 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.ce.cn/World/biz/200805/23/t20080523_15587864.shtml|title=Toyota to sink $67.2 mln in Mitsubishi passenger jet _World Biz--China Economic Net|publisher=|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 12, 2012, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has bought [[Goodrich Corporation|Goodrich]] turbine business,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manufacturing.net/news/2012/12/united-tech-sells-3-businesses-for-35b United Tech Sells 3 Businesses For $3.5B].

The '''HPCL Mumbai refinery''' is one of the most complex refineries in the country, is constructed on an area of 321 acres. This versatile refinery which is the first of Indiaâs modern refineries, symbolizes the countryâs industrial strength and progress in the oil industry. Mumbai Refinery has grown over the years as the main hub of petroleum products. The refinery has reached to present level through several upgradation and restructuring processes.&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.hindustanpetroleum.com/refinerieshistory&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Mumbai Refinery was commissioned by Esso Standard in 1954, with an installed capacity of 1.25 MMTPA.
Lube refinery, Lube India Ltd, was commissioned in 1969 with a capacity of 165 TMTPA of Lube Oil Base Stock (LOBS) production
Crude processing capacity increased to 3.5 MMTPA during 1969. In 1974, the Government of India took over Esso and Lube India by the [http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1769128/ Esso (Acquisition of Undertakings in India) Act 1974] and formed HPCL. 
Expansion of fuels block was carried out by installation of new 2 MMTPA crude units in 1985.
Second expansion of Lube Refinery took place to increase the capacity of the refinery to 335 MMTPA, so far the largest in India. The installed capacity of the refinery was later enhanced to 6.5 MMTPA. The current installed capacity of the refinery is 7.5 MMTPA

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8870">A '''nanoscale vacuum-channel transistor''' ('''NVCT''') is a [[transistor]] in which the electron transport medium is a vacuum. In a traditional solid-state transistor, a [[semiconductor]] channel exists between the source and the drain, and the current flows through the semiconductor. However,  in a nanoscale vacuum-channel transistor, no material exists between the source and the drain, and therefore, the current flows through the [[vacuum]].

Theoretically, a vacuum-channel transistor is expected to operate faster than a traditional solid-state transistor,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=R.|last2=Gray|first2=H.|last3=Campisi|first3=G.|date=1985|title=Vacuum integrated circuits|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org:80/document/1485472/?reload=true|journal=1985 International Electron Devices Meeting|volume=31|pages=172â175|doi=10.1109/IEDM.1985.190922}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have higher power output.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Moreover, vacuum-channel transistors are expected to operate at higher temperature and radiation level than a traditional transistor&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; making them suitable for space application.

== History ==
The concept of using field-emitted electron beam in a diode was first mentioned in a 1961 article by Kenneth Shoulders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065245808601424|title=Microelectronics Using Electron-Beam-Activated Machining Techniques* - ScienceDirect|language=en|access-date=2017-05-02|doi=10.1016/S0065-2458(08)60142-4|journal=Advances in Computers|pages=135â293 | last1 = Shoulders | first1 = Kenneth R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the technological difficulty of fabricating a field-emitter electron source, such a diode was not implemented.

As the field of microfabrication advanced, it became possible to fabricate field-emitted electron sources, thereby paving the way for vacuum-channel transistors. The first successful implementation was reported by Gary et. al. in 1986.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, early vacuum-channel transistors suffered from high gate [[threshold voltage]] and couldn't compete with solid-state transistors. 

More recent advances in microfabrication have allowed the vacuum-channel length between the source and the drain to be shrunk, thereby reducing the gate threshold voltage. In 2012, Srisonphan et. al. reported a new design of vacuum-channel transistor with a gate threshold value of 0.5V,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srisonphan|first=Siwapon|last2=Jung|first2=Yun Suk|last3=Kim|first3=Hong Koo|title=Metalâoxideâsemiconductor field-effect transistor with a vacuum channel|url=http://doi.org/10.1038/nnano.2012.107|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|volume=7|issue=8|pages=504â508|doi=10.1038/nnano.2012.107|bibcode=2012NatNa...7..504S}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is comparable to the gate threshold voltage of current solid-state transistors.

As the shrinking of solid-state transistors is reaching its theoretical limit,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waldrop|first=M. Mitchell|date=2016-02-11|title=The chips are down for Mooreâs law|url=http://www.nature.com/news/the-chips-are-down-for-moore-s-law-1.19338|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=530|issue=7589|pages=144â147|doi=10.1038/530144a|bibcode=2016Natur.530..144W}}&lt;/ref&gt; vacuum-channel transistors may offer an alternative.

== Simplified operation ==
A nanoscale vacuum-channel transistor is essentially a miniaturized version of a [[vacuum tube]]. It consists of a field-emitter electron source, a collector electrode, and a gate electrode. The electron source and the collector electrodes are separated by a small distance, usually of the order of several nanometers. When a voltage is applied across the source and the collector electrode, due to [[Field emission|field-emission]], electrons are emitted from the source electrode, travel through the gap and are collected by the collector electrode. A gate electrode is used to control the current flow through the vacuum-channel.

Despite the name, vacuum-channel transistors do not need to be evacuated. The gap traversed by the electrons is so small that collisions with molecules gas at atmospheric pressure are infrequent enough not to matter.

== Advantages ==
The nanoscale vacuum-channel transistors have several benefits over traditional solid-state transistors such as high speed, high output power, and operation at high temperature and immunity to strong radiations.  The advantages of a vacuum-channel transistor over a solid-state transistor are discussed in detail below:

=== High speed ===

In a solid-state transistor, the electrons collide with the semiconductor lattice and suffer from scattering which slows down the speed of the electrons. In fact, in silicon, the velocity of electrons is limited to  1.4Ã10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;cm/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Physics of semiconductor devices.|last=Sze|first=S. M.|publisher=John wiley &amp; sons|year=1981|isbn=0-471-05661-8|location=USA|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in vacuum electrons do not suffer from scattering and can reach a velocity of up to 3Ã10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;cm/s. Therefore, a vacuum-channel transistor can operate at a faster speed than a silicon solid-state transistor.

=== Operation at high temperature ===
The [[Band gap|band-gap]] of [[silicon]] is 1.11eV, and the [[thermal energy]] of electrons should remain lower than this value for silicon to retain its semiconductor properties. This places a limit on the operating temperature of silicon transistors. However, no such limitation exists in vacuum. Therefore, a vacuum-channel transistor can operate at a much higher temperature, only limited by the melting temperature of the materials used for its fabrication. The vacuum-transistor can be used in applications where a tolerance to high temperature is required.

=== Immunity to radiation ===
The radiation can ionize the atoms in a solid-state transistors. These ionized atoms and corresponding electrons can interfere with the electron transport between the source and collector. However, no ionization occur in the vacuum-channel transistors. Therefore, a vacuum-channel transistor can be used in a high radiation environment such as outer space or inside a nuclear reactor.

== Disadvantage ==
The performance of a vacuum-channel transistor depends upon the field emission of electrons from the source electrode. However, due to the high electric field, the source electrodes degrades over time, thereby decreasing the emission current.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-05-21|title=Vacuum nanoelectronics: Back to the future?âGate insulated nanoscale vacuum channel transistor|url=http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4717751|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=100|issue=21|pages=213505|doi=10.1063/1.4717751|issn=0003-6951 | last1 = Han | first1 = Jin-Woo|bibcode=2012ApPhL.100u3505H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the degradation of electrons source electrode, vacuum-channel transistors suffer from poor reliability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6666">The '''oil depletion allowance''' in American (US) tax law is an allowance claimable by anyone with an economic interest in a mineral deposit or standing timber.&lt;ref name ="IRS"&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/publications/p535/ch09.html IRS publication 535], Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;   The principle is that the asset is a capital investment that is a [[wasting asset]], and therefore [[depreciation]] can reasonably be  offset (effectively as a [[capital loss]]) against income.

The oil depletion allowance has been subject of interest, because of the relationship of [[big oil]] with the US government, and because one method (percentage depletion) of claiming the allowance makes it possible to write off more than the whole capital cost of the asset.

==Depletion calculation==
Two methods of depletion calculations are available, detailed regulations determine which can be used, but in some circumstances the asset owner can choose.&lt;ref name ="IRS" /&gt;

===Cost depletion===
With this method the original investment is effectively amortized over the productive life of the asset, starting with the original capital investment, the annual percentage being the percentage of the reserves at the beginning of the year that are sold in the course of the year.  The amortized amount is deducted from the net income before calculating taxes.  The total amount deducted by this method cannot exceed the original value of the capital invested.&lt;ref name="Mineral Web"&gt;[http://www.mineralweb.com/owners-guide/leased-and-producing/royalty-taxes/depletion-allowance/ Depletion Allowance] at Mineral Web&lt;/ref&gt;

===Percentage depletion===
With this method, a fixed percentage of the gross income is treated as deductible.&lt;ref name="Mineral Web" /&gt;  The percentage is dependent on the nature of the resource being extracted.&lt;ref name ="IRS" /&gt;  It is possible under this scheme for the total deductibles (or indeed the annual deductible) to exceed the original capital investment.&lt;ref name = "Mineral Web" /&gt;

====Table of percentages====
The following percentages are prescribed by the [[Internal Revenue Code]], section 613(b).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/613 IRC Section 613]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polymethylpentene''' ('''PMP'''), also known as '''poly(4-methyl-1-pentene)''', is a [[thermoplastic]] [[polymer]] of [[4-Methyl-1-pentene|4-methyl-1-pentene]]. It is used for gas permeable packaging, [[autoclave|autoclavable]] medical and laboratory equipment, [[microwave]] components, and [[cookware]]. It is commonly called '''TPX''', which is a trademark of [[Mitsui Chemicals]].

==Production==
Polymethylpentene is a [[4-methyl-1-pentene]] based linear [[isotactic]] [[polyolefin]] and is made by [[Ziegler-Natta]] type [[catalysis]]. The commercially available grades are usually [[copolymers]]. It can be [[extrusion|extruded]] and molded (by [[injection molding]] or [[blow molding]]).

==Physical properties==
Polymethylpentene melts at â 235&amp;nbsp;Â°C. It has a very low [[density]] (0.84 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and is [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]]. It has low moisture absorption, and exceptional acoustical and electrical properties. Its properties are reasonably similar to those of other [[polyolefin]]s, although it is more [[brittle]] and more gas permeable. The polymer also has a high [[thermal stability]], excellent [[dielectric]] characteristics and a high [[chemical resistance]].&lt;ref name="Lopez1992"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Lopez, L. C., Wilkes, G. L., Stricklen, P. M., White, S. A. | title=Synthesis, Structure and Properties of Poly(4-Methyl-1-pentene)|journal = Journal of Macromolecular Science, Part C: Polymer Reviews | year = 1992 | volume = 32 | pages = 301â406}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[crystal]]line phase has a lower [[density]] than the [[amorphous]] phase.&lt;ref name="Lopez1992"/&gt;

In comparison to other materials being used for operating in [[Terahertz radiation|THz]] range, TPX shows excellent optical properties with a wavelength independent [[refractive index]] of 1.460Â±0.005 between [[visible light]] and 100~GHz.

==Applications==
*Applications include [[sonar]] covers, [[speaker cone]]s, [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] transducer heads, and lightweight structural parts. It is also FDA compliant for use in [[food processing]] machinery. Polymethylpentene is often used in films and coatings for gas permeable packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plasticsintl.com/polymethylpentene.htm|title=Polymethylpentene (TPXÂ®)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Because of its high [[melting point]] and good temperature stability, polymethylpentene is used for autoclavable medical and laboratory equipment, microwave components, and [[cookware]].
*It is also often used in electrical components e.g. [[LED]] molds because it is an excellent [[electrical insulator]].
*TPX is a hard, solid material, which can be mechanically shaped into various optical components like [[Lens (optics)|lens]]es and [[window]]s. Also specifically TPX is used in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; laser pumped molecular lasers as an output window because it is transparent in the whole [[Terahertz radiation|terahertz]] range and totally suppresses the ~10&amp;nbsp;Âµm pump radiation.

{{further|2000s energy crisis}}

From 1999 til mid 2008, the price of oil rose significantly. It was explained by the rising oil demand in countries like China and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/09/business/worldbusiness/09oil.html|title=Rising Demand for Oil Provokes New Energy Crisis|first=Jad|last=Mouawad|date=November 9, 2007|publisher=|accessdate=March 25, 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the middle of the [[financial crisis of 2007â2008]], the price of oil underwent a significant decrease after the record peak of US$147.27 it reached on July 11, 2008. On December 23, 2008, WTI crude oil spot price fell to US$30.28 a barrel, the lowest since the [[financial crisis of 2007â2010]] began. The price sharply rebounded after the crisis and rose to US$82 a barrel in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/hist/rwtcd.htm|title=Cushing, OK WTI Spot Price FOB  (Dollars per Barrel)|author=|date=|website=tonto.eia.doe.gov|accessdate=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008 oil reached a record peak of US$147.27 but by February 2009 it sank beneath $40 a barrel.&lt;ref name="cnbc_2015"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/07/us-crude-oil-prices-remain-near-7-yr-lows-as-opec-glut-bites.html|title = US oil settles at $37.51 a barrel after hitting 2009 lows|publisher = CNCB via Reuters|date = 8 December 2015|accessdate = 17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 January 2011, the [[Brent Crude|Brent]] price hit $100 a barrel for the first time since October 2008, on concerns about the [[2011 Egyptian protests|political unrest]] in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="BBC_2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12328745|title=BBC News â Egypt unrest pushes Brent crude oil to $100 a barrel|work=BBC News|accessdate=January 5, 2015|date=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For about three and half years the price largely remained in the $90â$120 range. In the middle of 2014, price started declining due to a significant increase in oil production in USA, and declining demand in the emerging countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-prices-hit-again-by-weak-china-data-buildup-in-u-s-stockpiles-1420019256|title=U.S. Oil Falls 46%, Steepest Yearly Loss Since 2008 â WSJ|author=Nicole Friedman|date=31 December 2014|work=WSJ|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oil glutâcaused by multiple factorsâspurred a sharp downward spiral in the price of oil that continued through February 2016.&lt;ref name="telegraph_2015"&gt;{{cite news|first1= Ambrose |last1=Evans-Pritchard |title= Goldman eyes $20 oil as glut overwhelms storage sites |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/oilprices/12006554/Goldman-eyes-20-oil-as-glut-overwhelms-storage-sites.html |accessdate=29 December 2015|newspaper=The Telegraph |date=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 3, 2016 oil was below $30â&lt;ref name="calgaryherald_feb_3_2016_"&gt;{{cite web | title=Commodities | work=Calgary Herald | date=3 February 2016 | accessdate=3 February 2016 |page=C7}}&lt;/ref&gt; a drop of "almost 75 percent since mid-2014 as competing producers pumped 1â2 million barrels of crude daily exceeding demand, just as China's economy hit lowest growth in a generation."&lt;ref name="CNCB_2016_oilfutures" /&gt; Some analysts speculate that it may continue to drop further, perhaps as low as $18&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/04/oil-may-hit-18-amid-saudi-iran-tensions-kilduff.html|title=Oil may fall to $18 amid Gulf tensions: Kilduff|first=Tom|last=DiChristopher|date=January 4, 2016|website=cnbc.com|accessdate=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report released on February 15, 2016 by [[Deloitte]] LLPâthe audit and consulting firmâwith global crude oil at near ten-year low prices, 35% of listed E&amp;P oil and gas companies are at a high risk of bankruptcy worldwide.&lt;ref name="G&amp;M_Deloitte_2016"&gt;{{citation |work=Globe and Mail via PressReader |date=February 6, 2016 |accessdate=|title=Deloitte warns of oil bankruptcies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters_2016_Feb16"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-shale-bankruptcy-idUSKCN0VP0O6 | title=High risk of bankruptcy for one-third of oil firms: Deloitte | publisher=Reuters | date=16 February 2016 | accessdate=17 February 2016 | author=Scheyder, Ernest | location=Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, bankruptcies "in the oil and gas industry could surpass levels seen in the Great Recession."&lt;ref name="G&amp;M_Deloitte_2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fortune_2016" /&gt;

==The causes of oil price fluctuations==
There are two views dominating the oil market discourse. There are those who strongly believe that the market has undergone structural changes and that low oil prices are here to stay for a prolonged period. At the other end of the spectrum, there are those who think that this is yet another cycle and oil prices will recover sooner rather than later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fattouh|first=Bassam|year=2016|title=Adjustment in the Oil Market : Structural, Cyclical or Both?|url=https://www.oxfordenergy.org/publications/adjustment-oil-market-structural-cyclical/|journal=Oxford Energy Comment|publisher=Oxford Institute for Energy Studies|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 survey of the academic literature finds that "most major oil price fluctuations dating back to 1973 are largely explained by shifts in the demand for crude oil".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Forty Years of Oil Price Fluctuations: Why the Price of Oil May Still Surprise Us|url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/aea/jep/2016/00000030/00000001/art00007|journal = The Journal of Economic Perspectives|date = 2016-01-01|pages = 139â160|volume = 30|issue = 1|doi = 10.1257/jep.30.1.139|first = Christiane|last = Baumeister|first2 = Lutz|last2 = Kilian}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the global economy expands, so does demand for crude oil.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The authors note that the price of oil has also increased at times due to greater "demand for stocks (or inventories) of crude oil... to guard against future shortages in the oil market. Historically, inventory demand has been high in times of geopolitical tension in the Middle East, low spare capacity in oil production, and strong expected global economic growth."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In particular, political events can have a strong influence on the oil price. Historical examples include OPECâs 1973 embargo in reaction to the [[Yom Kippur War]] and the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]]. Financial analysts and academics have had very few tools to study such political events compared to what is available on economic aspects of oil price formation.&lt;ref name="commodities-now.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.commodities-now.com/reports/power-and-energy/19760-prix-index-forecasts-ample-oil-supplies.html |journal = Commodities Now |title = PRIX index forecasts ample oil supplies |date = 2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[PRIX index]] was developed in attempt to fill this gap with a metric on political developments and corresponding export trends from worldâs 20 largest oil exporters.&lt;ref name="commodities-now.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Oil&amp;Gas Financial Journal |url=http://www.ogfj.com/articles/print/volume-12/issue-8/features/quantifying-political-risk.html |title=Quantifying Political Risk |date= 2015-08-07 |accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The supply of oil is dependent on geological discovery, the legal and tax framework for oil extraction, the cost of extraction, the availability and cost of technology for extraction, and the political situation in oil-producing countries. Both domestic political instability in oil producing countries and conflicts with other countries can destabilise the oil price. In 2008 the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported, for example, in the 1940s the price of oil was about $17 rising to just over $20 during the [[Korean War]] (1951â1953). During the [[Vietnam War]] (1950s{{snd}}1970s) the price of oil slowly declined to under $20. During the [[1973 oil crisis|Arab oil embargo of 1973]]âthe first oil shockâthe price of oil rapidly rose to double in price. During the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]] the price of oil rose. During the second oil shock the price of oil peaked in April 1980 at $103.76. During the [[1980s oil glut|1980s]] there was a period of "conservation and insulation efforts" and the price of oil dropped slowly to {{circa|$22}}.

==Benchmark pricing==
{{main article |Benchmark (crude oil)}}

In North America this generally refers to the [[spot price|WTI Cushing Crude Oil Spot Price]] West Texas Intermediate (WTI), also known as Texas Light Sweet, a type of crude oil used as a benchmark in oil pricing and the underlying commodity of New York Mercantile Exchange's oil futures contracts. WTI is a light [[crude oil]], lighter than Brent Crude oil. It contains about 0.24% sulfur, rating it a sweet crude, sweeter than Brent. Its properties and production site make it ideal for being refined in the United States, mostly in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions. WTI has an API gravity of around 39.6 (specific gravity approx. 0.827) per barrel (159 liters) of either [[West Texas Intermediate|WTI]]/[[Light crude oil|light crude]] as traded on the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]] (NYMEX) for delivery at [[Cushing, Oklahoma]]. [[Cushing, Oklahoma]], a major oil supply hub connecting oil suppliers to the Gulf Coast, has become the most significant trading hub for crude oil in North America.

In Europe and some other parts of the world, the oil price benchmark is [[Brent Crude|Brent]] as traded on the [[Intercontinental Exchange]] (ICE, into which the [[International Petroleum Exchange]] has been incorporated) for delivery at [[Sullom Voe]].

Other important [[Benchmark (crude oil)|benchmarks]] include Dubai, Tapis, and the [[OPEC basket]]. The [[Energy Information Administration]] (EIA) uses the imported refiner acquisition cost, the [[Weighted mean|weighted average]] cost of all oil imported into the US, as its "world oil price".

In [[Robert Mabro]]'s 2006 book on challenges and opportunities in oil in the 21st century, after the collapse of the OPEC-administered pricing system in 1985, and a short lived experiment with netback pricing, oil-exporting countries adopted a market-linked pricing mechanism.&lt;ref name="Mabro"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mabro|first=Robert|work=Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries|title=Oil in the 21st century: issues, challenges and opportunities|publisher=Oxford Press|year=2006|page=351|isbn=9780199207381}}&lt;/ref&gt; First adopted by [[PEMEX]] in 1986, market-linked pricing received wide acceptance and by 1988 became and still is the main method for pricing crude oil in international trade.&lt;ref name="Mabro" /&gt;  The current reference, or pricing markers, are [[Brent Crude|Brent]], [[West Texas Intermediate|WTI]], and [[Dubai Crude|Dubai/Oman]].&lt;ref name="Mabro" /&gt;

==Speculation during the 2008 crisis==
In June 2008 ''Business Week'' reported that the surge in oil prices prior to 2008 had led some commentators to argue that at least some of the rise was due to [[speculation]] in the [[Futures exchange|futures markets]].&lt;ref name=Wallace2008 /&gt; However, although speculation can greatly raise the oil price in the short run, in the long run fundamental market conditions will determine the oil price. Storing oil is expensive, and all speculators must ultimately, and generally within a few months, sell the oil they purchase.

According to a U.S. [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC) May 29, 2008 report the "Multiple Energy Market Initiatives" was launched in partnership with the United Kingdom [[Financial Services Authority]] and [[IntercontinentalExchange|ICE Futures Europe]] in order to expand surveillance and information sharing of various futures contracts.  Part 1 is "Expanded International Surveillance Information for Crude Oil Trading."&lt;ref name=CFTC_2008 /&gt;  This announcement has received wide coverage in the financial press, with speculation about oil futures price manipulation.&lt;ref name="ftgateway_2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost_2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="money_2008" /&gt;

The interim report by the Interagency Task Force, released in July, found that [[speculation]] had not caused significant changes in oil prices and that fundamental [[supply and demand]] factors provide the best explanation for the crude [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil price increases]]. The report found that the primary reason for the price increases was that the [[world economy]] had [[economic expansion|expanded]] at its fastest pace in decades, resulting in substantial increases in the demand for oil, while the [[oil production]] grew sluggishly, compounded by production shortfalls in oil-exporting countries.

The report stated that as a result of the imbalance and low [[price elasticity]], very large price increases occurred as the [[Market (economics)|market]] attempted to balance scarce [[price elasticity of supply|supply]] against growing [[price elasticity of demand|demand]], particularly in the last three years. The report forecast that this imbalance would persist in the future, leading to continued upward pressure on oil prices, and that large or rapid movements in oil prices are likely to occur even in the absence of activity by speculators. The task force continues to analyze [[commodity market]]s and intends to issue further findings later in the year.

==Oil-storage trade (contango)==
{{main article|Oil-storage trade}}
[[File:Bateaux comparaison3.png|thumb|upright=1.8|The [[Seawise Giant|Knock Nevis]] (1979â2010), a ULCC supertanker compared to the longest ships ever built]]
{{quote|The strategy works because oil prices for delivery in the future are trading at a premium to those in the spot market â a market structure known in the industry as contango â with investors expecting prices to eventually recover from the near 60 percent slide in oil in the last seven months.|Reuters 2015}}
The oil-storage trade, also referred to as contango, a market strategy in which large, often vertically-integrated oil companies purchase oil for immediate delivery and storageâwhen the price of oil is lowâ and hold it in storage until the price of oil increases. Investors bet on the future of oil prices through a [[financial instrument]], [[oil futures]] in which they agree on a contract basis, to buy or sell oil at a set date in the future. Crude oil is stored in salt mines, tanks and oil tankers.&lt;ref name="oil_glut" /&gt;

Investors can choose to take profits or losses prior to the oil-delivery date arrives. Or they can leave the contract in place and physical oil is "delivered on the set date" to an "officially designated delivery point", in the United States, that is usually [[Cushing, Oklahoma|Cushing]], Oklahoma. When delivery dates approach, they close out existing contracts and sell new ones for future delivery of the same oil. The oil never moves out of storage. If the forward market is in "[[contango]]"âthe [[forward price]] is higher than the current [[spot price]]âthe strategy is very successful.

Scandinavian Tank Storage AB and its founder Lars Jacobsson introduced the concept on the market in early 1990.&lt;ref name="Yglesias_2014"&gt;{{citation |title=Why speculators are stashing vast quantities of crude oil on tanker ships |first=Matthew |last=Yglesias |date=25 December 2014 |accessdate=21 January 2015 |url=https://www.vox.com/2014/12/25/7443569/contango-oil-storage |work=[[Vox (website)|VOX]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it was in 2007 through 2009 the oil storage trade expanded,&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web|first=Michele|last=Norris|date=17 December 2008|title=Contango In Oil Markets Explained|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98410267}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many participantsâincluding [[Wall Street]] giants, such as [[Morgan Stanley]], [[Goldman Sachs]], and [[Citicorp]]âturning sizeable profits simply by sitting on tanks of oil.&lt;ref name=WSJ6oct2007&gt;{{cite news|title=Where Has All The Oil Gone? After Sitting on Crude, speculators Unload It.

{{quote|"The trend follows a spike in oil futures prices that has created incentives for traders to buy crude oil and oil products at current rates, sell them on futures markets and store them until delivery."|Financial Post 2009}}

By the end of October 2009 one in twelve of the largest oil tankers was being used more for temporary storage of oil, rather than transportation.&lt;ref name=FT2009&gt;{{cite web|date=17 November 2009|title=Tankers store oil as futures prices rocket|first=Robert |last=Wright|journal=Financial Times|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/29a6663e-d3af-11de-8caf-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2QV1AuRl4|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From June 2014 to January 2015, as the price of oil dropped 60 percent and the supply of oil remained high, the world's largest traders in crude oil purchased at least 25 million barrels to store in supertankers to make a profit in the future when prices rise. [[Trafigura]], [[Vitol]], [[Gunvor (company)|Gunvor]], [[Koch Industries|Koch]], [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and other major energy companies began to book booking oil storage supertankers for up to 12 months. By 13 January 2015 At least 11 [[Oil tanker#Size categories|Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC) and Ultra Large Crude Carriers (ULCC)]]" have been reported as booked with storage options, rising from around five vessels at the end of last week. Each VLCC can hold 2 million barrels."&lt;ref name="Reuters_2015"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/102335399#. |title=Oil traders to store millions of barrels at sea as prices slump |date=13 January 2015 |work=Reuters |accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 as global capacity for oil storage was out-paced by global oil production, and an oil glut occurred. Crude oil storage space became a [[tradable commodity]] with [[CME Group]]â which owns [[NYMEX]]â offering [[oil-storage futures]] contracts in March 2015.&lt;ref name="oil_glut" /&gt; Traders and producers can buy and sell the right to store certain types of oil.&lt;ref name="oil_glut" /&gt;

By 5 March 2015, as oil production outpaces oil demand by 1.5 million barrels a day, storage capacity globally is dwindling.&lt;ref name="oil_glut" /&gt; In the United States alone, according to data from the [[Energy Information Administration]], U.S. crude-oil supplies are at almost 70% of the U. S. storage capacity, the highest to capacity ratio since 1935.&lt;ref name="oil_glut"&gt;{{citation |title=Oil Glut Sparks Latest Dilemma: Where to put it all as storage tanks near capacity, some predict spillover will send crude prices even lower |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-glut-sparks-latest-dilemma-where-to-put-it-all-1425577673 |work=Wall Street Journal |date=5 March 2015 |accessdate=6 March 2015 |first=Nicole |last=Friedman }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future projections==
{{Main article|Oil depletion|Peak oil}}
Peak oil is the period when the maximum rate of global [[petroleum]] [[extraction of petroleum|extraction]] is reached, after which the rate of production enters terminal decline. It relates to a long-term decline in the available supply of petroleum.  This, combined with increasing demand, will significantly increase the worldwide prices of petroleum derived products.  Most significant will be the availability and price of liquid fuel for transportation.

The US Department of Energy in the [[Hirsch report]] indicates that "The problems associated with world oil production peaking will not be temporary, and past "energy crisis" experience will provide relatively little guidance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/others/pdf/Oil_Peaking_NETL.pdf|title=DOE Hirsch Report|author=|date=|website=doe.gov|accessdate=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United Nations]], world oil demand is projected to reach over 99 million barrels per day in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/publication/world-economic-situation-and-prospects-2018/ |title=World Economic Situation and Prospects 2018  |publisher = [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]], Development Policy and Analysis Division.

The macroeconomics impact on lower oil prices is lower inflation. A lower inflation rate is good for the consumers. This means that the general price of a basket of goods would increase at a bare minimum on a year to year basis. Consumer can benefit as they would have a better purchasing power, which may improve real gdp &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pettinger|first1=Tevjan|title=Impact of falling oil prices|url=https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/11738/oil/impact-of-falling-oil-prices/|website=Economics Org|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, in recent countries like Japan, the decrease in oil prices may cause deflation and it shows that consumers are not willing to spend even though the prices of goods are decreasing yearly, which indirectly increases the real debt burden.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

It shows the GDP increase between 0.5% to 1.0% for India, USA and China, and a decline of greater than 3.5% from Saudi Arabia and Russia. A stable price of $60 would add 0.5 percentage point to global gross domestic product.

Katina Stefanova has argued that falling oil prices do not imply a recession and a decline in stock prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/katinastefanova/2014/12/31/do-falling-oil-prices-foreshadow-a-slump-in-the-stock-market-in-2015/|title=Do Falling Oil Prices Foreshadow a Slump in the Stock Market in 2015?|author=Katina Stefanova|work=Forbes|accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liz Ann Sonders, Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab, had earlier written that  that  positive impact on consumers and businesses outside of the energy sector, which is a larger portion of the US economy will outweigh the negatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/nn/articles/Black-Dog-Are-Plunging-Oil-Prices-a-Positive-or-a-Negative|title=Black Dog: Are Plunging Oil Prices a Positive or a Negative?, Liz Ann Sonders, November 3, 2014|author=|date=|website=schwab.com|accessdate=March 25, 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220084048/http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/nn/articles/Black-Dog-Are-Plunging-Oil-Prices-a-Positive-or-a-Negative|archivedate=December 20, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking cues from a legendary oil investor, [[Harold Hamm]], ranked as one of the richest men in the world by [[Forbes]], [[Shawn Baldwin]], Chairman of alternative investment firm [[AIA Group, LLC|The AIA Group]], speculates that oil prices will rise by year-end 2016 from current levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3043719/ask-the-experts/why-oil-prices-will-be-60-65-by-year-end |title=Shawn Baldwin Discusses Why Oil Will Hit $60â$65 with Harold Hamm |work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |accessdate=2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil glut===
Economists have observed that the [[2016 oil glut|2015â2016 oil glut]] also known as [[2010s oil glut]] started with a considerable time-lag, more than six years after the beginning of the [[Great Recession]]: "''the price of oil'' [had] ''stabilized at a relatively high level (around $100 a barrel) unlike all  previous recessionary cycles since 1980 (start of First Persian Gulf War). But nothing guarantee[d] such price levels in perpetuity''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.academia.edu/6702258/A_GCC_House_Divided_Country_Risk_Implications_of_the_Saudi-Qatari_Rift |work=Al-Hayat |location=London |title=A GCC House Divided: Country Risk Implications of the Saudi-Qatari Rift |first=M. Nicolas J. |last=Firzli |date=6 April 2014 |accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2014â2015, OPEC members consistently exceeded their production ceiling, and China experienced a marked slowdown in economic growth. At the same time, U.S. oil production nearly doubled from 2008 levels, due to substantial improvements in [[tight oil|shale]] "[[fracking]]" technology in response to record oil prices. A combination of factors led a plunge in U.S. oil import requirements and a record high volume of worldwide oil [[inventory|inventories]] in storage, and a collapse in oil prices that continues into 2016.&lt;ref name="NYT_2014"&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Oil Prices Fall Below $80 a Barrel |first=Clifford |last=Krassnov |date=November 3, 2014 |accessdate=December 13, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/business/energy-environment/us-oil-prices-fall-below-80-a-barrel.html |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=glut&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-04/opec-maintains-crude-production-as-group-defers-output-target-ihryzilb |title=OPEC Won't Cut Production to Stop Oil's Slump |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=basketprice /&gt;

It has also been argued that the collapse in oil prices in 2015 should be very beneficial for developed western economies, who are generally oil importers and aren't over exposed to declining demand from China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/3845256-opportunity-decline-oil-price,|title=Opportunity From The Decline In Oil Price|first=Edward Pearce|last=Gould|date=January 28, 2016|website=seekingalpha.com|accessdate=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Asia-Pacific region, exports and economic growth were at significant risk across economies reliant on commodity exports as an engine of growth. The most vulnerable economies were those with a high dependence on fuel and mineral exports to China, such as: Korea DPR, Mongolia and Turkmenistan â where primary commodity exports account for 59â99% of total exports and more than 50% of total exports are destined to China. The decline in Chinaâs demand for commodities also adversely affected the growth of exports and GDP of large commodity-exporting economies such as Australia (minerals) and the Russian Federation (fuel). On the other hand, lower commodity prices led to an improvement in the trade balance â through lower the cost of raw materials and fuels â across commodity importing economies, particularly Cambodia, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal and other remote island nations (Kiribati, Maldives, Micronesia (F.S), Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu) which are highly dependent on fuel and agricultural imports &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=2617542 |date= 2015|title= Commodity Price Crash: Risks to Exports and Economic Growth in Asia-Pacific LDCs and LLDCs |accessdate=5 March 2015 |publisher=United Nations ESCAP |author1=Saggu, A. |author2=Anukoonwattaka, W. |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hedging as risk management==

The use of [[hedge (finance)|hedging]] using commodity [[derivative (finance)|derivative]]s as a risk management tool on price exposure to liquidity and earnings, has been long established in North America. Chief Financial Officers (CFOS) use derivatives to dampen, remove or mitigate price uncertainty.&lt;ref name="ogfj_2012"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ogfj.com/articles/print/volume-9/issue-11/features/etrm/hedging-is-an-effective-risk-management.html | title=Hedging Is An Effective Risk Management Tool For Upstream Companies | publisher=Oil and Gas Financial Journal | date=1 November 2012 | accessdate=17 February 2016 | author=Price, Kevin | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bankers also use hedge funds to more "safely increase leverage to smaller oil and gas companies."&lt;ref name="ogfj_2012" /&gt; However, when not properly used, "derivatives can multiply losses"&lt;ref name="ogfj_2012" /&gt; particularly in North America where investors are more comfortable with higher levels of risk than in other countries.&lt;ref name="ogfj_2012" /&gt;

With the large number of bankruptcies as reported by Deloitte&lt;ref name="fortune_2016"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fortune.com/2016/02/16/oil-companies-bankrupt/ | title=One-Third of Oil Companies Could Go Bankrupt this Year | publisher=Fortune | date=16 February 2016 | accessdate=17 February 2016 | author=Zillman, Claire}}&lt;/ref&gt; "funding [for upstream oil industry] is shrinking and hedges are unwinding."&lt;ref name="G&amp;M_Deloitte_2016" /&gt; "Some oil producers are also choosing to liquidate hedges for a quick infusion of cash, a risky bet."&lt;ref name="reuters_2016_Feb16" /&gt;

{{quote|"Access to capital markets, bankers' support and derivatives protection, which helped smooth an otherwise rocky road, are fast waning...The roughly 175 companies at risk of bankruptcy have more than $150 billion in debt, with the slipping value of secondary stock offerings and asset sales further hindering their ability to generate cash."|John England, Vice-Chairman Deloitte LLP, Statement, February 16, 2016}}

To finance exploration and production of the unconventional [[shale oil]] industry in the United States, "hundreds of billions of dollars of capital came from non-bank participants [non-bank buyers of bank energy credits] in leveraged loans] that were thought at the time to be low risk.&lt;ref name="ft_2015"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5bb59df2-9808-11e4-b4be-00144feabdc0.html#axzz40SbjUYQ2 | title=Lesson from history on perils facing oil and gas investors | publisher=Financial Times | date=9 January 2015 | accessdate=17 February 2016 | author=Dizard, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the oil glut that continued into 2016, about a third of oil companies are facing bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="fortune_2016"/&gt; While investors were aware that there was a risk that the operator might declare bankruptcy, they felt protected because "they had come in at the 'bank' level, where there was a senior claim on the assets [and] they could get their capital returned."&lt;ref name="ogfj_2012" /&gt;

By 2012,&lt;ref name="ogfj_2012" /&gt;

{{quote|"... in recent years the combination of the development of large resource plays in the US and the emergence of business models designed to ensure consistent dividend payouts to investors has led to the development of more aggressive hedging policies in companies and less restrictive covenants in bank loans."|''Oil and Gas Financial Journal'', 2012}}

A classic example of taking on too much risk through hedging is the 1982 collapse of [[Penn Square Bank]] caused by plummeting of the price of oil in 1981.&lt;ref name="ft_2015" /&gt; Penn Square Bank had lent too much to [[Upstream (petroleum industry)|Exploration and Production]] E&amp;P operators. Penn Square Bank caused the failure of Seafirst in 1982 and then Continental Illinois.&lt;ref name="ft_2015" /&gt; When they failed and were liquidated by the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) the non-bank buyers or participants of bank energy credits of these leveraged loans participants were considered to be 'unsecured claims,' not 'true sales' and they were not able to collect any capital.&lt;ref name="ft_2015" /&gt;

At the 5th annual World Pensions Forum in 2015, [[Jeffrey Sachs]] advised [[institutional investor]]s to divest from carbon-reliant [[oil industry]] firms in their [[pension fund]]'s portfolio.&lt;ref name="Sachs_2015"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Andrew |last1=Pearce|title= Jeffrey Sachs: Fund Managers Have a Duty to Dump Fossil Fuels|url=http://www.efinancialnews.com/story/2015-12-07/sachs222 |accessdate=30 December 2015|work=Financial News|date=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015â16 prices: The lows of January 2016===

Because of oversupply and lack of agreements between oil-producing countries members of the OPEC (Saudi Arabia in particular, which pumped at world's records) and also because of lack of coordinated efforts between OPEC and Non-OPEC countries (Russian being a big player, refusing to reduce production) the price of oil fell rapidly in 2015 and continued to slide in 2016 causing the cost of WTI crude to fall to a 10-year low of $26.55 on January 20. The average price of oil in January 2016 was well below $35. Oil did not recover until April 2016, when oil went above the $45 mark.

By 20 January 2016, the OPEC Reference Basket was down to US$22.48/bblâless than one-fourth of its high from June 2014 ($110.48), less than one-sixth of its record from July 2008 ($147.27), and back below the April 2003 starting point ($23.27) of its historic run-up.&lt;ref name=basketprice&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opec.org/basket/basketDayArchives.xml |title=OPEC Basket Daily Archives |work=OPEC |accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United Nations]], growth prospects of the oil exporters are predicted to remain subdued past 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/publication/world-economic-situation-and-prospects-2018/ |title=World Economic Situation and Prospects 2018  |publisher = [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]], Development Policy and Analysis Division. |page = 4|accessdate = 2018-03-02 |ISBN = 978-92-1-109177-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quartz''' is a [[mineral]] composed of [[silicon]] and [[oxygen]] atoms in a continuous framework of SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; siliconâoxygen [[Tetrahedral molecular geometry|tetrahedra]], with each oxygen being shared between two tetrahedra, giving an overall [[chemical formula]] of [[Silicon dioxide|SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].  Quartz is the second most abundant [[mineral]] in [[Earth]]'s [[continental crust]], behind [[feldspar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Robert S. |last1=Anderson |first2=Suzanne P. |last2=Anderson |title=Geomorphology: The Mechanics and Chemistry of Landscapes |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |page=187|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hDt5A2-km_wC|isbn=978-1-139-78870-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quartz crystals are [[chiral]], and exist in two forms, the normal Î±-quartz and the high-temperature Î²-quartz. The transformation from Î±-quartz to Î²-quartz takes place abruptly at 573&amp;nbsp;Â°C (846&amp;nbsp;K). Since the transformation is accompanied by a significant change in volume, it can easily induce fracturing of ceramics or rocks passing through this temperature limit.

There are many different varieties of quartz, several of which are semi-precious [[gemstone]]s. Since antiquity, varieties of quartz have been the most commonly used minerals in the making of [[Jewellery|jewelry]] and [[hardstone carving]]s, especially in Eurasia.

==Etymology==
The word "quartz" is derived from the [[German language|German]] word "Quarz", which had the same form in the first half of the 14th century in [[Middle High German]] in [[East Central German]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dwds.de/wb/Quarz Digitales WÃ¶rterbuch der deutschen Sprache] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201042329/https://www.dwds.de/wb/Quarz |date=1 December 2017 }} (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; and which came from the Polish dialect term ''kwardy'', which corresponds to the Czech term ''tvrdÃ½'' ("hard").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/quartz |title={title} |access-date=26 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043652/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/quartz |archive-date=1 December 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] referred to quartz as ÎºÏÏÏÏÎ±Î»Î»Î¿Ï (''krustallos'') derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''ÎºÏÏÎ¿Ï'' (''kruos'') meaning "icy cold", because some [[philosopher]]s (including [[Theophrastus]]) apparently believed the mineral to be a form of [[Supercooling|supercooled]] ice.&lt;ref name="Tomkieff"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.minersoc.org/pages/Archive-MM/Volume_26/26-176-172.pdf | title=On the origin of the name 'quartz' | author=Tomkeieff, S.I. | journal=Mineralogical Magazine | year=1942 | volume=26 | pages=172â178 | doi=10.1180/minmag.1942.026.176.04 | access-date=12 August 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904013105/http://www.minersoc.org/pages/Archive-MM/Volume_26/26-176-172.pdf | archive-date=4 September 2015 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the term ''rock crystal'' is sometimes used as an alternative name for the purest form of quartz.

==Crystal habit and structure==
[[File:Quartz crystals on section of limestone core.jpg|thumb|left|Quartz mineral embedded in [[limestone]] (top right of the sample), easily identifiable by its hexagonal form. It cannot be scratched by steel (see [[Mohs scale]]).]]

Quartz belongs to the [[trigonal crystal system]]. The [[crystal habit|ideal crystal shape]] is a six-sided [[prism (geometry)|prism]] terminating with six-sided [[pyramid]]s at each end. In nature quartz crystals are often [[Crystal twinning|twinned]] (with twin right-handed and left-handed quartz crystals), distorted, or so intergrown with adjacent crystals of quartz or other minerals as to only show part of this shape, or to lack obvious crystal faces altogether and appear massive. Well-formed crystals typically form in a 'bed' that has unconstrained growth into a void; usually the crystals are attached at the other end to a matrix and only one termination pyramid is present. However, doubly terminated crystals do occur where they develop freely without attachment, for instance within [[gypsum]]. A quartz [[geode]] is such a situation where the void is approximately spherical in shape, lined with a bed of crystals pointing inward.

Î±-quartz crystallizes in the trigonal crystal system, [[space group]] ''P''3&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;21 or ''P''3&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;21 depending on the chirality. Î²-quartz belongs to the hexagonal system, space group ''P''6&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;22 and ''P''6&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;22, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal Data, Determinative Tables, ACA Monograph No. 5, American Crystallographic Association, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; These space groups are truly chiral (they each belong to the 11 enantiomorphous pairs). Both Î±-quartz and Î²-quartz are examples of chiral crystal structures composed of achiral building blocks (SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra in the present case). The transformation between Î±- and Î²-quartz only involves a comparatively minor rotation of the tetrahedra with respect to one another, without change in the way they are linked.

==Varieties (according to microstructure)==
Although many of the varietal names historically arose from the color of the mineral, current scientific naming schemes refer primarily to the microstructure of the mineral. Color is a secondary identifier for the cryptocrystalline minerals, although it is a primary identifier for the macrocrystalline varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gemselect.com/gem-info/quartz/quartz-info.php|title=Quartz Gemstone and Jewelry Information: Natural Quartz - GemSelect|website=www.gemselect.com|access-date=2017-08-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829171847/https://www.gemselect.com/gem-info/quartz/quartz-info.php|archive-date=29 August 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties (according to color)==
[[File:Transparency.jpg|right|thumb|Quartz crystal demonstrating [[Transparency and translucency|transparency]]]]

Pure quartz, traditionally called rock crystal or clear quartz, is colorless and [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]] or translucent, and has often been used for [[hardstone carving]]s, such as the [[Lothair Crystal]]. Common colored varieties include citrine, rose quartz, amethyst, smoky quartz, milky quartz, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.minerals.net/gemstone/quartz_gemstone.aspx|title=Quartz: The gemstone Quartz information and pictures|website=www.minerals.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827194835/http://www.minerals.net/gemstone/quartz_gemstone.aspx|archive-date=27 August 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important distinction between types of quartz is that of ''macrocrystalline'' (individual crystals visible to the unaided eye) and the [[microcrystalline]] or [[cryptocrystalline]] varieties ([[Aggregate (geology)|aggregate]]s of crystals visible only under high magnification). The cryptocrystalline varieties are either translucent or mostly opaque, while the transparent varieties tend to be macrocrystalline. [[Chalcedony]] is a cryptocrystalline form of silica consisting of fine intergrowths of both quartz, and its [[Monoclinic crystal system|monoclinic]] polymorph [[moganite]].&lt;ref name="heany_1994"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heaney |first=Peter J. |year=1994 |title=Structure and Chemistry of the low-pressure silica polymorphs |journal=Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry |volume=29 |pages=1â40 |url=http://rimg.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/29/1/1 |issue=1 |access-date=26 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724151910/http://rimg.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/29/1/1 |archive-date=24 July 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other opaque gemstone varieties of quartz, or mixed rocks including quartz, often including contrasting bands or patterns of color, are [[agate]], [[carnelian]] or sard, [[onyx]],  [[Heliotrope (mineral)|heliotrope]], and [[jasper]].

===Amethyst===
[[Amethyst]] is a form of quartz that ranges from a bright to dark or dull purple color. The world's largest deposits of amethysts can be found in Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay, Russia, France, Namibia and Morocco. Sometimes amethyst and citrine are found growing in the same crystal. It is then referred to as [[ametrine]]. An amethyst is formed when there is iron in the area where it was formed.

===Blue quartz===
Blue quartz contains inclusions of fibrous [[magnesio-riebeckite]] or [[crocidolite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blue Quartz|publisher=Mindat.org|url=https://www.mindat.org/min-26723.html|access-date=24 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224211828/https://www.mindat.org/min-26723.html|archive-date=24 February 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dumortierite quartz===
Inclusions of the mineral [[dumortierite]] within quartz pieces often result in silky-appearing splotches with a [[Blue (color)|blue]] hue, shades giving off [[Purple (color)|purple]] and/or [[Grey (color)|grey]] colors additionally being found. "Dumortierite quartz" (sometimes called "blue quartz") will sometimes feature contrasting light and dark color zones across the material.&lt;ref name=Cally/&gt;&lt;ref name=gemstone&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.minerals.net/gemstone/dumortierite_gemstone.aspx | title=The Gemstone Dumortierite | publisher=Minerals.net | accessdate=23 April 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506074639/http://www.minerals.net/gemstone/dumortierite_gemstone.aspx | archive-date=6 May 2017 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in the certain quality forms of blue quartz as a collectible gemstone particularly arises in India and in the United States.&lt;ref name=Cally&gt;{{citebook|title=Firefly Guide to Gems|first=Cally|last=Oldershaw|publisher=Firefly Books|date=2003|ISBN=9781552978146|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wm_X_LzoN-cC|pages=100|access-date=19 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053945/https://books.google.com/books?id=wm_X_LzoN-cC|archive-date=22 February 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Citrine===
Citrine is a variety of quartz whose color ranges from a pale yellow to brown due to [[ferric]] impurities. Natural citrines are rare; most commercial citrines are heat-treated [[amethyst]]s or [[smoky quartz]]es. However, a heat-treated amethyst will have small lines in the crystal, as opposed to a natural citrine's cloudy or smokey appearance. It is nearly impossible to differentiate between cut citrine and yellow [[topaz]] visually, but they differ in [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]]. Brazil is the leading producer of citrine, with much of its production coming from the state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. The name is derived from the Latin word ''citrina'' which means "yellow" and is also the origin of the word "[[citron]]". Sometimes citrine and amethyst can be found together in the same crystal, which is then referred to as [[ametrine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-1054.html Citrine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502064111/http://www.mindat.org/min-1054.html |date=2 May 2010 }}. Mindat.org (2013-03-01). Retrieved 2013-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Citrine has been referred to as the "merchant's stone" or "money stone", due to a superstition that it would bring prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Superstitions By Richard Webster, p.19&lt;/ref&gt;

Citrine was first appreciated as a golden-yellow gemstone in Greece between 300 and 150 BC, during the Hellenistic Age. The yellow quartz was used prior to that to decorate jewelry and tools but it was not highly sought-after.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://thehealingchest.com/crystals-stones/citrine-meaning/ |title={title} |access-date=18 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818175635/http://thehealingchest.com/crystals-stones/citrine-meaning/ |archive-date=18 August 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milky quartz===
Milk quartz or milky quartz is the most common variety of crystalline quartz. The white color is caused by minute [[fluid inclusions]] of gas, liquid, or both, trapped during crystal formation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KLSTDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97|title=Gemstones: A Complete Color Reference for Precious and Semiprecious Stones of the World|last=Hurrell|first=Karen|last2=Johnson|first2=Mary L.|date=2016-12-15|publisher=Book Sales|isbn=978-0-7858-3498-4|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it of little value for optical and quality gemstone applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galleries.com/minerals/silicate/milky_qu/milky_qu.htm Milky quartz at Mineral Galleries] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219020818/http://www.galleries.com/minerals/silicate/milky_qu/milky_qu.htm |date=19 December 2008 }}. Galleries.com. Retrieved 2013-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rose quartz===
Rose quartz is a type of quartz which exhibits a pale pink to rose red hue. The color is usually considered as due to trace amounts of [[titanium]], [[iron]], or [[manganese]], in the material. Some rose quartz contains microscopic [[rutile]] needles which produces an [[Asterism (gemology)|asterism]] in transmitted light. Recent [[X-ray crystallography|X-ray diffraction]] studies suggest that the color is due to thin microscopic fibers of possibly [[dumortierite]] within the quartz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/show.php?id=3456 Rose Quartz] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401031656/http://www.mindat.org/show.php?id=3456 |date=1 April 2009 }}. Mindat.org (2013-02-18). Retrieved 2013-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there is a rare type of pink quartz (also frequently called crystalline rose quartz) with color that is thought to be caused by trace amounts of [[phosphate]] or [[aluminium]]. The color in crystals is apparently photosensitive and subject to fading. The first crystals were found in a [[pegmatite]] found near [[Rumford, Maine|Rumford]], [[Maine]], USA and in [[Minas Gerais]], [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://minerals.caltech.edu/ge114/Lecture_Topics/Quartz/Index.htm Colored Varieties of Quartz] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719160220/http://minerals.caltech.edu/ge114/Lecture_Topics/Quartz/Index.htm |date=19 July 2011 }}, Caltech&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smoky quartz===
[[Smoky quartz]] is a gray, translucent version of quartz. It ranges in clarity from almost complete transparency to a brownish-gray crystal that is almost opaque. Some can also be black.  The translucency results from natural irradiation creating free silicon within the crystal.

===Prasiolite===
{{distinguish|Praseolite}}

[[Prasiolite]], also known as ''vermarine'',  is a variety of quartz that is green in color. Since 1950, almost all natural prasiolite has come from a small [[Brazil]]ian mine, but it is also seen in [[Lower Silesia]] in [[Poland]]. Naturally occurring prasiolite is also found in the [[Thunder Bay]] area of [[Canada]]. It is a rare mineral in nature; most green quartz is heat-treated amethyst.&lt;ref name=Page&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quartzpage.de/prasiolite.html |title=Prasiolite |publisher=quarzpage.de |date=28 October 2009 |accessdate=28 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713052049/http://www.quartzpage.de/prasiolite.html |archive-date=13 July 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthetic and artificial treatments==
[[File:Quartz synthese.jpg|thumb|A synthetic quartz crystal grown by the [[Hydrothermal synthesis|hydrothermal method]], about 19&amp;nbsp;cm long and weighing about 127 grams]]

Not all varieties of quartz are naturally occurring. Some clear quartz crystals can be treated using heat or gamma-irradiation to induce color where it would not otherwise have occurred naturally. Susceptibility to such treatments depends on the location from which the quartz was mined.&lt;ref&gt;Liccini, Mark, [http://www.gemsociety.org/article/treating-quartz-color/ ''Treating Quartz to Create Color''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223233321/http://www.gemsociety.org/article/treating-quartz-color/ |date=23 December 2014 }}, [[International Gem Society]] website. Retrieved 22 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prasiolite]], an olive colored material, is produced by heat treatment; natural prasiolite has also been observed in Lower Silesia in Poland. Although citrine occurs naturally, the majority is the result of heat-treated amethyst. [[Carnelian]] is widely heat-treated to deepen its color.

Because natural quartz is often [[crystal twinning|twinned]], synthetic quartz is produced for use in industry. Large, flawless, single crystals are synthesized in an [[Autoclave (industrial)|autoclave]] via the [[Hydrothermal synthesis|hydrothermal process]]; [[emerald]]s are also synthesized in this fashion.

Like other crystals, quartz may be [[Metal-coated crystal|coated with metal vapors]] to give it an attractive sheen.

==Occurrence==
[[File:ArideGranite1.jpg|thumb| Granite rock in the cliff of Gros la TÃªte â [[Aride Island]], [[Seychelles]]. The thin (1-3 cm wide) brighter layers are quartz veins, formed during the late stages of crystallization of granitic magmas. They are sometimes called "hydrothermal veins".]]
Quartz is a defining constituent of [[granite]] and other [[felsic]] [[igneous rock]]s. It is very common in [[sedimentary rock]]s such as [[sandstone]] and [[shale]]. It is a common constituent of [[schist]], [[gneiss]], [[quartzite]] and other [[metamorphic rock]]s. Quartz has the lowest potential for [[weathering]] in the [[Goldich dissolution series]] and consequently it is very common as a residual mineral in stream sediments and residual [[soil]]s.

While the majority of quartz crystallizes from molten [[magma]], much quartz also chemically precipitates from hot [[Hydrothermal circulation|hydrothermal]] [[Vein (geology)|veins]] as [[gangue]], sometimes with [[ore]] minerals like gold, silver and copper. Large crystals of quartz are found in magmatic [[pegmatite]]s. Well-formed crystals may reach several meters in length and [[mass|weigh]] hundreds of kilograms.

Naturally occurring quartz crystals of extremely high purity, necessary for the crucibles and other equipment used for growing [[Monocrystalline silicon|silicon]] [[Wafer (electronics)|wafers]] in the [[semiconductor]] industry, are expensive and rare.

Quartz is the most common material identified as the mystical substance [[maban]] in [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]]. It is found regularly in passage tomb cemeteries in Europe in a burial context, such as [[Newgrange]] or [[Carrowmore]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. The [[Irish language|Irish]] word for quartz is ''grianchloch'', which means 'sunstone'. Quartz was also used in [[Prehistoric Ireland]], as well as many other countries, for [[stone tool]]s; both vein quartz and rock crystal were [[knapping|knapped]] as part of the [[lithic technology]] of the prehistoric peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lithicsireland.ie/phd_quartz_lithic_technology_chap_3.html |title=Driscoll, Killian. 2010.

Available on-line at:  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D37%3Achapter%3D9 Perseus.Tufts.edu] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109044605/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D37%3Achapter%3D9 |date=9 November 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; (The word "crystal" comes from the Greek word ''ÎºÏÏÏÏÎ±Î»Î»Î¿Ï'', "ice".) He supported this idea by saying that quartz is found near glaciers in the Alps, but not on volcanic mountains, and that large quartz crystals were fashioned into spheres to cool the hands. This idea persisted until at least the 17th century. He also knew of the ability of quartz to split light into a [[spectrum]].

In the 17th century, [[Nicolas Steno]]'s study of quartz paved the way for modern [[crystallography]]. He discovered that regardless of a quartz crystal's size or shape, its long prism faces always joined at a perfect 60Â° angle.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaus Steno (Latinized name of Niels Steensen) with John Garrett Winter, trans., ''The Prodromus of Nicolaus Steno's Dissertation Concerning a Solid Body Enclosed by Process of Nature Within a Solid'' (New York, New York:  Macmillan Co., 1916). On [https://books.google.com/books?id=5IYNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA272 page 272] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904013105/https://books.google.com/books?id=5IYNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA272 |date=4 September 2015 }}, Steno states his law of constancy of interfacial angles:  "Figures 5 and 6 belong to the class of those which I could present in countless numbers to prove that in the plane of the axis both the number and the length of the sides are changed in various ways without changing the angles; â¦ "&lt;/ref&gt;

Quartz's [[Piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] properties were discovered by [[Jacques Curie|Jacques]] and [[Pierre Curie]] in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Curie, Jacques |author2=Curie, Pierre |year=1880|title=DÃ©veloppement par compression de l'Ã©lectricitÃ© polaire dans les cristaux hÃ©miÃ¨dres Ã  faces inclinÃ©es|trans-title=Development, via compression, of electric polarization in hemihedral crystals with inclined faces|journal=Bulletin de la SociÃ©tÃ© minÃ©rologique de France|volume= 3| pages =90â93}}.

Efforts to synthesize quartz began in the mid nineteenth century as scientists attempted to create minerals under laboratory conditions that mimicked the conditions in which the minerals formed in nature:  German geologist [[Karl Emil von SchafhÃ¤utl]] (1803â1890)&lt;ref&gt;For biographical information about Karl von SchafhÃ¤utl, see German Wikipedia's article:   [[:de:Karl Emil von SchafhÃ¤utl|Karl Emil von SchafhÃ¤utl]] (in German).&lt;/ref&gt; was the first person to synthesize quartz when in 1845 he created microscopic quartz crystals in a pressure cooker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Karl Emil |last=von SchafhÃ¤utl |title=Die neuesten geologischen Hypothesen und ihr VerhÃ¤ltniÃ zur Naturwissenschaft Ã¼berhaupt (Fortsetzung) |trans-title=The latest geological hypotheses and their relation to science in general (continuation) |journal=Gelehrte Anzeigen |volume=20 |issue=72 |date=10 April 1845 |pages=577â584 |location=[[Munich|MÃ¼nchen]] |publisher=im Verlage der kÃ¶niglichen Akademie der Wissenschaften, in Commission der Franz'schen Buchhandlung |url=https://archive.org/stream/gelehrteanzeige06wissgoog#page/n298/mode/1up |oclc=1478717}} From page 578:  5) ''Bildeten sich aus Wasser, in welchen ich im Papinianischen Topfe frisch gefÃ¤llte KieselsÃ¤ure aufgelÃ¶st hatte, beym Verdampfen schon nach 8 Tagen Krystalle, die zwar mikroscopisch, aber sehr wohl erkenntlich aus sechseitigen Prismen mit derselben gewÃ¶hnlichen Pyramide bestanden.''

By the 1930s, the electronics industry had become dependent on quartz crystals.  The only source of suitable crystals was Brazil; however, World War II disrupted the supplies from Brazil, so nations attempted to synthesize quartz on a commercial scale.  German mineralogist Richard Nacken (1884â1971) achieved some success during the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Nacken, R. (1950) "Hydrothermal Synthese als Grundlage fÃ¼r ZÃ¼chtung von Quarz-Kristallen" (Hydrothermal synthesis as a basis for the production of quartz crystals), ''Chemiker Zeitung'', '''74''' : 745â749.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the war, many laboratories attempted to grow large quartz crystals.  In the United States, the U.S. Army Signal Corps contracted with [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]] and with the [[Brush Development Company]] of Cleveland, Ohio to synthesize crystals following Nacken's lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.107.2781.393| title = The Laboratory Growing of Quartz| journal = Science| volume = 107| issue = 2781| pages = 393â394| year = 1948| last1 = Hale | first1 = D.

By 1948, Brush Development had grown crystals that were 1.5 inches (3.8&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter, the largest to date.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pCQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA148 "Record crystal,"] ''Popular Science'', '''154''' (2) :  148 (February 1949).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brush Development's team of scientists included:  Danforth R. Hale, Andrew R. Sobek, and Charles Baldwin Sawyer (1895â1964).  The company's U.S. patents included:
*  Sobek, Andrew R. "Apparatus for growing single crystals of quartz," {{US Patent|2674520}}; filed:  11 April 1950; issued: 6 April 1954.

(This patent was assigned to Sawyer Research Products of Eastlake, Ohio.)&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1950s, [[hydrothermal synthesis]] techniques were producing synthetic quartz crystals on an industrial scale, and today virtually all the quartz crystal used in the modern electronics industry is synthetic.

==Piezoelectricity==
Some types of quartz crystals have [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] properties; they develop an [[electric potential]] upon the application of [[Stress (mechanics)|mechanical stress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a4Z1AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA302|title=They Would Be Gods|last=Forwood|first=Anthony K.|date=2011|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-257-37362-8|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early use of this property of quartz crystals was in [[phonograph]] pickups. One of the most common piezoelectric uses of quartz today is as a [[crystal oscillator]]. The [[quartz clock]] is a familiar device using the mineral. The resonant frequency of a quartz crystal oscillator is changed by mechanically loading it, and this principle is used for very accurate measurements of very small mass changes in the [[quartz crystal microbalance]] and in [[thin-film thickness monitor]]s.

A '''radioactive source''' is a known quantity of a [[radionuclide]] which emits [[ionizing radiation]]; typically one or more of the radiation types [[gamma ray]]s, [[alpha particle]]s, [[beta particle]]s, and [[neutron radiation]].

Sources can be used for [[irradiation]], where the radiation performs a significant ionising function on a target material, or as a radiation [[metrology]] source, which is used for the calibration of radiometric process and [[radiation protection]] instrumentation. They are also used for industrial process measurements, such as thickness gauging in the paper and steel industries. Sources can be sealed in a container (highly penetrating radiation) or deposited on a surface (weakly penetrating radiation), or they can be in a fluid. 
 
As an irradiation source they are used in medicine for [[radiation therapy]] and in industry for such as [[industrial radiography]], [[food irradiation]], [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]], [[vermin]] disinfestation, and [[Cross-linked polyethylene|irradiation crosslinking]] of PVC. 

Radionuclides are chosen according to the type and character of the radiation they emit, intensity of emission, and the [[half-life]] of their decay. Common source radionuclides include [[cobalt-60]],&lt;ref name="C188"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nordion.com/gamma-technologies/markets/c-188/ |title=C-188 Cobalt-60 Source |publisher=Nordion Inc |accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[iridium-192]],&lt;ref name="Isoflex"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isoflex.com/iridium-192 |title=Iridium-192 |publisher=Isoflex |accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[strontium-90]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://practicalphysics.org/radioactive-sources-isotopes-and-availability.html |title=Radioactive sources: isotopes and availability |accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[SI]] measurement quantity of source [[radioactive decay|activity]] is the [[Becquerel]], though the historical unit [[Curies]] is still in partial use, such as in the USA, despite the USA [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] strongly advising the use of the SI unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/pubs/sp811/sec05.cfm#52 |title=NIST Guide to the SI, Chapter 5 (paragraph 5.2) |publisher=NIST |accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SI unit for health purposes is mandatory in the [[EU]].

An irradiation source typically lasts for between 5 and 15 years before its activity drops below useful levels.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/TRS436_web.pdf|title=Disposal Options for Disused Radioactive Sources|last=|first=|publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency|year=2005|isbn=92-0-100305-6|location=|pages=|issn=0074-1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; However sources with long half-life radionuclides when utilised as calibration sources can be used for much longer.

==Sealed sources==
Many radioactive sources are sealed, meaning they are permanently either completely contained in a capsule or firmly bonded solid to a surface. Capsules are usually made of [[stainless steel]], [[titanium]], [[platinum]] or another inert [[metal]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The use of sealed sources removes ''almost'' all risk of [[radioactive contamination|dispersion of radioactive material]] into the environment due to mishandling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onr.org.uk/hass.htm |title=Implementation of the Control of High-activity Sealed Radioactive Sources and Orphan Sources (HASS) directive for nuclear licensed sites |accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the container is not intended to attenuate radiation, so further shielding is required for radiation protection.&lt;ref name="SealedSources"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iaea.org/OurWork/ST/NE/NEFW/Technical-Areas/WTS/sealedsources-sealedsources.html |title=Disused Sealed Source Management |publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency |accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sealed sources are used in almost all applications where the source does not need to be chemically or physically included in a liquid or gas.

=== Categorisation of sealed sources&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1578_web-57265295.pdf|title=Radiation protection and safety of radiation sources : International basic safety standards|last=|first=|publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency|year=2014|isbn=978-92-0-135310-8|location=Vienna|pages=|issn=1020-525X}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===

Sealed sources are categorised by the [[IAEA]] according to their activity in relation to a minimum dangerous source (where a dangerous source is one that could cause significant injury to humans). The ratio used is A/D, where A is the activity of the source and D is the minimum dangerous activity.

Note that sources with sufficiently low radioactive output (such as those used in [[Smoke detector]]s) as to not cause harm to humans are not categorised.

==Calibration sources==
[[File:US Navy 070208-N-9132D-002 Electronics Technician 2nd Class Shea Thompson tests an Alpha Particle Dection Probe.jpg|thumb| Hand-held large area alpha scintillation probe under calibration using a plate source]]
Calibration sources are used primarily for the calibration of radiometric instrumentation, which is used on process monitoring or in radiological protection. 

Capsule sources, where the radiation effectively emits from a point, are used for beta, gamma and X-ray instrument calibration. High level sources are normally used in a calibration cell: a room with thick walls to protect the operator and the provision of remote operation of the source exposure. 

The plate source is in common use for the [[Counts per minute|calibration]] of radioactive contamination instruments. This has a known amount of radioactive material fixed to its surface, such as an alpha and/or beta emitter, to allow the calibration of large area radiation detectors used for contamination surveys and personnel monitoring. Such measurements are typically counts per unit time received by the detector, such as [[counts per minute]] or counts per second.  

Unlike the capsule source, the plate source emitting material must be on the surface to prevent attenuation by a container or self-shielding due to the material itself. This is particularly important with alpha particles which are easily stopped by a small mass. The [[Bragg curve]] shows the attenuation effect in free air.

==Unsealed sources==
[[Unsealed source radiotherapy|Unsealed sources]] are sources that are not in a permanently sealed container, and are used extensively for medical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ionactive.co.uk/glossary/Unsealed_Source.html |title=Radiation Protection Glossary |accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are used when the source needs to be dissolved in a liquid for injection into a patient or ingestion by the patient. Unsealed sources are also used in industry in a similar manner for leak detection as a [[Radioactive tracer]].

== Disposal ==
Disposal of expired radioactive sources presents similar challenges to the disposal of other [[Radioactive waste|nuclear waste]], although to a lesser degree. Spent low level sources will sometimes be sufficiently inactive that they are suitable for disposal via normal waste disposal methods â usually landfill. Other disposal methods are similar to those for higher-level radioactive waste, using various depths of [[borehole]] depending on the activity of the waste.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A notorious incident of neglect in disposing of a high level source was the [[GoiÃ¢nia accident]], which resulted in several fatalities.

In passing through matter, [[charged particle]]s [[ionization|ionize]] and thus lose [[energy]] in many steps, until their energy is (almost) zero. The distance to this point is called the '''range''' of the particle. The range depends on the type of particle, on its initial energy and on the material through which it passes.

For example, if the ionising particle passing through the material is a positive [[ion]] like an [[alpha particle]] or [[proton]], it will collide with atomic electrons in the material via [[Coulomb's Law|Coulombic interaction]]. Since the mass of the [[proton]] or [[alpha particle]] is much greater than that of the [[electron]], there will be no significant deviation from the radiation's incident path and very little [[kinetic energy]] will be lost in each collision. As such, it will take many successive collisions for such heavy ionising radiation to come to a halt within the stopping medium or material. Maximum energy loss will take place in a head-on collision with an [[electron]].

Since large angle scattering is rare for positive ions, a range may be well defined for that [[radiation]], depending on its [[energy]] and [[charge (physics)|charge]], as well as the [[ionisation energy]] of the stopping medium. Since the nature of such interactions is statistical, the number of collisions required to bring a radiation particle to rest within the medium will vary slightly with each particle (i.e., some may travel further and undergo fewer collisions than others). Hence, there will be a small variation in the range, known as '''straggling'''.

The energy loss per unit distance (and hence, the density of ionization), or [[Stopping power (particle radiation)|stopping power]] also depends on the type and energy of the particle and on the material. Usually, the energy loss per unit distance increases while the particle slows down. The curve describing this fact is called the [[William Henry Bragg|Bragg]] curve. Shortly before the end, the energy loss passes through a maximum, the [[Bragg Peak]], and then drops to zero (see the figures in [[Bragg Peak]] and in [[Stopping power (particle radiation)|stopping power]]). This fact is of great practical importance for [[radiation therapy]].

The range of [[alpha particles]] in ambient air amounts to only several centimeters; this type of radiation can therefore be stopped by a sheet of paper. Although [[beta radiation|beta particles]] scatter much more than alpha particles, a range can still be defined; it frequently amounts to several hundred centimeters of air.

The mean range can be calculated by integrating the inverse stopping power over energy.

==Scaling==
The range of a heavy charged particle is approximately proportional to the mass of the particle and the inverse of the density of the medium, and is a function of the initial velocity of the particle.

The '''S10 NBC Respirator''' is a military [[gas mask]] that was formerly used within all branches of the [[British Armed Forces]]. Following the mask's replacement by the [[General Service Respirator]] in 2011, the S10 is now widely available to the public on the [[Military surplus|army surplus]] market.

==History==
[[File:Soldier Wearing Full Individual Protection Equiptment And Detector Paper MOD 45150761.jpg|thumb|upright|A British soldier with the S10 respirator during NBC exercises]]
The S10 was introduced in 1986 as a replacement for the [[S6 NBC Respirator]]&lt;ref name="S10"&gt;{{cite web| title = Avon S10| url = http://gasmasksukreferences.webs.com/britain.htm| accessdate = 2010-08-09| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120904195427/http://gasmasksukreferences.webs.com/britain.htm| archivedate = 2012-09-04| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in service from the 1960s, and is manufactured by [[Avon Rubber]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gasmaskking.com/british-s10-service&lt;/ref&gt; S10s were issued to British nationals in [[Saudi Arabia]] during the [[Gulf War|1991 Gulf War]] and were marked by a blue coloured PSM (Primary Speech Module) fitting or a blue painted spot on the forehead; although meant to be returned to the authorities after the Iraqi threat (from [[Scud]] missile attacks, potentially carrying chemical warheads) had expired, large numbers were unaccounted for in the wake of the conflict.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The S10 respirator was originally due to be replaced by the new [[General Service Respirator]] (GSR) in 2007, although replacement efforts officially began in 2011 and all S10 Respirators have since been replaced with the GSR. All issued filters for the S10 have expired, the last of which expired in 2014. No new S10 Respirators will be bought. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0UQBHirYpI&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Two filter canisters are issued for the S10, as with the S6; a light pressed metal type for riot control situations or training (marked with a painted red stripe or red tape), and a heavier plastic encased type for protection against NBC agents. The latter have a maximum shelf-life of 10 years, and the mask itself (the facepiece) of 20 years. The mask has many features including a fail-safe drinking device, a Secondary Speech Transmitter (SST) on the side which can accept special microphones, and corrective lenses can be fitted to the eyepieces. The mask also contains an inner mask to decrease fogging on the lenses.

==Variants==
Variants include:&lt;ref name="S10"/&gt;
*'''SF10''', intended for security and [[special forces]] use (replaced, at least in [[Special Air Service|SAS]] service, by the [[FM12 NBC Respirator#Variants|CT12]])
*'''AR10''' for police forces
*'''N10''', a commercial version.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1414">In [[forestry]] and [[silviculture]], a '''sanitation harvest''' or '''sanitation cutting''' is a harvest of trees for the purpose of removing insects or diseases from a stand of trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Forestry Merit Badge Booklet|year= 2005|publisher=Boy Scouts of America |location= Irving, Texas|isbn= 0-8395-3302-0|page= 67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sanitation harvesting is used to prevent the diseases or pests from spreading to other nearby trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/apa3316|title= Woodlot Harvest|author= Government of Alberta Department of Agriculture and Rural Development|date= September 14, 2009|accessdate=2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a form of [[Intermediate management (silviculture)|intermediate management]] and is used in order to improve an already existing [[stand level modelling|stand of trees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.forestencyclopedia.net/p/p1731|title= Sanitation Cuttings|work= Forest Encyclopedia Network|accessdate=2010-04-04}}

Sanitation cutting is done when legally required, for example to prevent bark beetle outbreaks. Or, when economic considerations about preventing potential loss or future losses due to inaction may occur.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3712">The '''solar zenith angle''' is the angle between the [[zenith]] and the centre of the [[Sun]]'s disc. The '''solar elevation angle''' is the altitude of the Sun, the angle between the horizon and the centre of the Sun's disc. Since these two angles are [[Angle#Combining angle pairs|complementary]], the cosine of either one of them equals the sine of the other. They can both be calculated with the same formula, using results from [[spherical trigonometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | page = 317 | title = Fundamentals of Atmospheric Modeling | first = Mark Z. | last = Jacobson | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | date = 2005 | isbn = 0521548659 | edition = 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hartmann"&gt;{{cite book | title = Global Physical Climatology | first = Dennis L. | last = Hartmann | publisher = [[Academic Press]] | page = 30 | date = 1994 | isbn = 0080571638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC right}}

==Formula==
:&lt;math&gt; \cos \theta_s = \sin \alpha_s = \sin \Phi \sin \delta + \cos \Phi \cos \delta \cos h&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;\theta_s&lt;/math&gt; is the ''solar zenith angle''
* &lt;math&gt;\alpha_s&lt;/math&gt; is the ''solar elevation angle'', &lt;math&gt;\alpha_s&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;90Â°&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\theta_s&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the [[hour angle]], in the local [[solar time]].
* &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the current [[declination of the Sun]]
* &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is the local [[latitude]].

===Caveats===
The calculated values are approximations due to the distinction between [[Latitude#Geodetic and geocentric latitudes|common/geodetic latitude]] and [[Latitude#Geocentric latitude|geocentric latitude]]. However, the two values [[Latitude#Comparison of selected types|differ]] by less than 12 [[minutes of arc]], which is less than the apparent angular radius of the sun.

The formula also neglects the effect of [[atmospheric refraction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = On the computation of solar elevation angles and the determination of sunrise and sunset times | page = 3 | first = Harold M. | last = Woolf | journal = NASA technical memorandu, X-1646 | date = 1968 | location = Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Sunrise/Sunset===
Sunset and sunrise occur (approximately) when the zenith angle is 90Â°, where the hour angle ''h''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; satisfies&lt;ref name="hartmann" /&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\cos h_0 = -\tan \Phi \tan \delta.&lt;/math&gt;

Precise times of sunset and [[Sunrise#Angle|sunrise]] occur when the upper limb of the Sun appears, as refracted by the atmosphere, to be on the horizon.

===Albedo===
A weighted daily average zenith angle, used in computing the local [[albedo of the Earth]], is given by
::&lt;math&gt;\overline{\cos \theta_s} = \frac{\int_{-h_0}^{h_0} Q \cos \theta_s \text{d}h}{\int_{-h_0}^{h_0} Q \text{d}h}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''Q'' is the instantaneous [[insolation]].&lt;ref name="hartmann" /&gt;

===Summary of special angles===
For example, the solar elevation angle is :
* 90Â° if you are on the equator, a day of equinox, at a solar hour of twelve
* near 0Â° at the sunset or at the sunrise
* between -90Â° and 0Â° during the night (midnight)

An exact calculation is given in [[position of the Sun]]. Other approximations exist elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=livioflores-ga|url=http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview/id/782886.html|publisher=[[Google]]|title=Equation to know where the Sun is at a given place at a given date-time|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''K-27''' was the only submarine of Project 645 in the [[Soviet Navy]]. Project 645 was not assigned a [[NATO reporting name]]. That project produced one test model [[nuclear submarine]], which incorporated a pair of experimental [[VT-1 reactor|VT-1]] [[nuclear reactor]]s that used a liquid-metal coolant ([[Lead-bismuth eutectic]]), placed into the modified hull of a [[November class submarine]] (Project 627A).

==Launch and operations==
The keel of ''K-27'' was laid down on 15 June 1958 at [[Severodvinsk]] Shipyard No. 402.&lt;ref name="K-27"&gt;[http://www.deepstorm.ru/DeepStorm.files/45-92/nts/645/k27/k27.htm K-27 Project 645]. Deepstorm.ru. Retrieved on 8 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched on 1 April 1962, and went into service as an experimental "attack submarine" on 30 October 1963.&lt;ref name="K-27"/&gt; ''K-27'' was officially commissioned into the [[Soviet Northern Fleet]] on 7 September 1965. ''K-27'' was assigned to the  17th submarine division, headquartered at  [[Ostrovnoy|Gremikha]]).&lt;ref name="K-27"/&gt;

The nuclear reactors of ''K-27'' were troublesome from their first [[critical reaction|criticality]], but the ''K-27'' was able to engage in test operations for about five years. On 24 May 1968, the power output of one of her reactors suddenly dropped sharply; [[radioactivity|radioactive]] gases were released into her engine room; and the [[ionizing radiation|radiation]] levels throughout ''K-27'' increased dangerously â by 1.5 [[gray (unit)|grays per hour]]{{Clarify| reason=Did it rise up to 1.5 Gy/h or was it rising by 1.5 Gy/hÂ²?| date=September 2013}}. This radiation consisted mostly of [[gamma ray]]s and [[thermal neutron]]s, with some [[alpha ray|alpha radiation]] and [[beta ray|beta radiation]] in addition{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} â generated by the released radioactive gasses such as [[xenon]] and [[krypton]] in her reactor compartment.{{fact|date=July 2015}}

The training of the crew by the Soviet Navy had been inadequate, and these sailors did not recognize that their [[nuclear reactor]] had suffered from extensive [[fuel element failure]]s. By the time they gave up their attempts to repair the reactor at sea, nine of the crewmen had accumulated fatal radioactive exposures.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

About one-fifth of the [[reactor core]] had experienced [[loss of coolant|inadequate cooling]] caused by uneven coolant flows. Hot spots in the reactor had ruptured, releasing nuclear fuel and [[nuclear fission]] products into the liquid-metal coolant, which circulated them throughout her reactor compartment.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

''K-27'' was laid up in [[Gremikha Bay]] starting on 20 June 1968. The cooling-off of the reactors and various experimental projects were carried out aboard the submarine through 1973.  These included the successful restarting of the starboard reactor up to 40% of maximal power production. Plans were considered to slice off the reactor compartment and replace it with a new one containing standard VM-A water-cooled reactors. The rebuilding or replacement of the nuclear reactor was considered to be too expensive, and also to be inappropriate because more modern [[nuclear submarine]]s had already entered service in the [[Soviet Navy]].&lt;ref name="Project 645 - K27"&gt;[http://atrinaflot.narod.ru/1_submarines/03_pla_645/0_645.htm ÐÑÐ¾Ð¼Ð½ÑÐµ Ð¿Ð¾Ð´Ð²Ð¾Ð´Ð½ÑÐµ Ð»Ð¾Ð´ÐºÐ¸ ÑÐ¸Ð¿Ð° Ð-27 (Nuclear-powered Submarines of K-27 Type)].

Retrieved on 8 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scuttled in the Kara Sea==

Then ''K-27'' was towed to a special training area in the eastern [[Kara Sea]], and it was scuttled there on 6 September 1982 near the location 72Â°31'28"N., 55Â°30'09"E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://world.lib.ru/m/mazurenko_w_n/history.shtml  | script-title=ru:Ð-27 "ÐÐ¸Ð´ÐºÐ¸Ð¹ ÐÐµÑÐ°Ð»Ð»" | accessdate =12 August 2010 | last = ÐÐ¸ÐºÐ¾Ð»Ð°ÐµÐ²Ð¸Ñ | first = ÐÐ°Ð·ÑÑÐµÐ½ÐºÐ¾ ÐÑÑÐµÑÐ»Ð°Ð² | date = 17 February 2009 | language = Russian | quote = ÐÐ¸Ð´Ð¸Ð¼Ð¾, ÐµÑÐµ Ð´Ð¾Ð»Ð³Ð¾ Ð² Ð½Ð°ÑÐµÐ¼ ÑÐ¾Ð·Ð½Ð°Ð½Ð¸Ð¸, Ð¾ÑÐ¾Ð±ÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾ ÑÐµÑ, ÐºÑÐ¾ ÑÐ»ÑÐ¶Ð¸Ð» Ð² ÐÐ¾ÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾-Ð¼Ð¾ÑÑÐºÐ¾Ð¼ Ð¤Ð»Ð¾ÑÐµ Ð½Ð° Ð°ÑÐ¾Ð¼Ð½Ð¾Ð¹ Ð¿Ð¾Ð´Ð²Ð¾Ð´Ð½Ð¾Ð¹ Ð»Ð¾Ð´ÐºÐµ Ð-27, 24 Ð¼Ð°Ñ 1968Ð³.

The last scientific expedition of the "Russian Ministry of Emergencies" to the Kara Sea examined the site of the scuttling in September 2006. Numerous samples of the seawater, the seafloor, and the sealife were gathered and then analyzed. The final report stated that the [[radioactivity|radiation]] levels of the area were  stable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mchs.gov.ru/news/detail.php?ID=3664 Ð ÐÐ°ÑÑÐºÐ¾Ð¼ Ð¼Ð¾ÑÐµ Ð¿ÑÐ¾Ð¹Ð´ÐµÑ Ð¾Ð±ÑÐ»ÐµÐ´Ð¾Ð²Ð°Ð½Ð¸Ðµ Ð·Ð°ÑÐ¾Ð½ÑÐ²ÑÐ¸Ñ Ð¾Ð¿Ð°ÑÐ½ÑÑ Ð¿Ð¾Ð´Ð²Ð¾Ð´Ð½ÑÑ Ð¾Ð±ÑÐµÐºÑÐ¾Ð² (The Survey of Submerged Dangerous Objects in the Kara Sea)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessons in nuclear submarine construction and safety learned from Projekt 645 were applied in Projects 705 and 705K â that produced the Soviet [[Alfa class submarine]]s. These were equipped with similar [[liquid-metal-cooled reactor]]s.

=== Recovery plans ===
In September 2012 it was reported that the  submarine needed to be lifted from her shallow bed in the Kara Sea. The vessel was said to be a "nuclear time bomb", and that the rusting and decaying vessel may be reaching a critical level leading to an "uncontrolled chain reaction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://rt.com/news/k-27-submarine-arctic-oil-040/|
title='Nuclear time bomb:' Downed K-27 submarine must be lifted out|
publisher=RT | date=13 September 2012 |accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a joint Russian and Norwegian mission in 2012 did not find alarming levels of radioactivity in the water and soil surrounding the  submarine, an urgent consideration pertains to the dismantling of the nuclear reactors should the  submarine be raised. Because the reactors were cooled by liquid metals, the nuclear rods became fused with the coolant when the reactors were stopped and conventional methods cannot be used for disassembling the reactors. However, [[France]]'s [[Commissariat Ã  l'Ã©nergie atomique et aux Ã©nergies alternatives]] designed and donated special equipment for a dedicated dry-dock (SD-10) in Gremikha, which was used to dismantle the [[Alfa-class submarine]]s that shared this design feature. However, since the last Alfa reactor was dismantled in 2011, this equipment is at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://barentsobserver.com/en/nature/urgent-lift-dumped-k-27-nuclear-sub-25-09|

In 2017, plans were again mooted to raise the submarine, by 2022. The [[Krylov State Research Center]] of [[St Petersburg]] announced that it was working on plans for a catamaran [[floating dry dock|floating dock]], capable of such heavy lifts from the seabed.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite web

'''Sterile neutrinos''' (or '''inert neutrinos''') are hypothetical [[particles]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/major-physics-experiment-just-detected-particle-shouldn-t-exist-ncna879616 |title=A major physics experiment just detected a particle that shouldn't exist |department=Live Science |year=2018 |website=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; (neutral [[lepton]]s â [[neutrino]]s) that interact only via [[gravity]] and do not interact via any of the [[fundamental interaction]]s of the [[Standard Model]]. The term ''sterile neutrino'' is used to distinguish them from the known ''active neutrinos'' in the [[Standard Model]], which are charged under the [[weak interaction]].

This term usually refers to [[neutrino]]s with [[right-handed]] [[Chirality (physics)|chirality]] (see [[Neutrino#Chirality|right-handed neutrino]]), which may be added to the Standard Model. Occasionally it is used in a general sense for any neutral [[fermion]], instead of the more cautiously vague name '''neutral heavy leptons''' (NHLs) or '''heavy neutral leptons''' (HNLs).

The existence of right-handed neutrinos is theoretically well-motivated, as all other known [[fermions]] have been observed with both left and right [[chirality]], and they can explain the observed active [[neutrino mass]]es in a natural way. The mass of the right-handed neutrinos themselves is unknown and could have any value between 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt#Mass|GeV]] and less than 1&amp;nbsp;eV.&lt;ref name=RHNeutrinosReview&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Drewes, Marco |year=2013 |title=The phenomenology of right handed neutrinos |journal=[[International Journal of Modern Physics E]] |volume=22 |issue=8 |pages=1330019 |arxiv=1303.6912 |doi=10.1142/S0218301313300191 |bibcode = 2013IJMPE..2230019D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of sterile neutrino types (should they exist) is not yet theoretically established. This is in contrast to the number of active neutrino types, which has to equal that of charged leptons and quark generations to ensure the anomaly freedom of the [[electroweak interaction]].

The search for sterile neutrinos is an active area of [[particle physics]]. If they exist and their mass is smaller than the energies of particles in the experiment, they can be produced in the laboratory, either by [[Neutrino oscillations|mixing]] between active and sterile neutrinos or in high energy particle collisions. If they are heavier, the only directly observable consequence of their existence would be the observed active neutrino masses. They may, however, be responsible for a number of unexplained phenomena in [[physical cosmology]] and [[astrophysics]], including [[dark matter]], [[baryogenesis]] or [[dark radiation]].&lt;ref name=RHNeutrinosReview /&gt; In May&amp;nbsp;2018, physicists of the [[MiniBooNE]] experiment reported a stronger neutrino oscillation signal than expected, a possible hint of sterile neutrinos.&lt;ref name="LS-20180601" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ARX-20180530" /&gt;

==Motivation==
{{See also|Neutrino#Chirality|Neutrino oscillation|l1=Neutrino: Chirality}}
Experimental results show that all produced and observed neutrinos have left-handed [[helicity (particle physics)|helicities]] (spin antiparallel to [[momentum]]), and all antineutrinos have right-handed helicities, within the margin of error. In the massless limit, it means that only one of two possible [[chirality (physics)|chiralities]] is observed for either particle. These are the only helicities (and chiralities) included in the Standard Model of particle interactions.

Recent experiments such as [[neutrino oscillation]], however, have shown that neutrinos have a non-zero mass, which is not predicted by the Standard Model and suggests new, unknown physics. This unexpected mass explains neutrinos with right-handed helicity and antineutrinos with left-handed helicity: Since they do not move at the speed of light, their helicity is not [[relativistic invariant]] (it is possible to move faster than them and observe the opposite helicity). Yet all neutrinos have been observed with left-handed ''chirality'', and all antineutrinos right-handed. Chirality is a fundamental property of particles and ''is'' relativistic invariant: It is the same regardless of the particle's speed and mass in every inertial reference frame. Although note that a particle with mass that starts out left-handed can develop a right-handed component as it travels â chirality is ''not'' conserved in the propagation of a free particle.

The question, thus, remains: Do neutrinos and antineutrinos differ only in their chirality? Or do exotic right-handed neutrinos and left-handed antineutrinos exist as separate particles from the common left-handed neutrinos and right-handed antineutrinos?

==Properties==
Such particles would belong to a [[singlet state|singlet]] [[group representation|representation]] with respect to the [[strong interaction]] and the [[weak interaction]], having zero [[electric charge]], zero [[weak hypercharge]], zero [[weak isospin]], and, as with the other [[leptons]], no [[color charge|color]], although they do have a [[B-L]] of &amp;minus;1. If the [[standard model]] is embedded in a hypothetical [[SO(10)]] [[grand unified theory]], they can be assigned an [[X (charge)|X charge]] of &amp;minus;5. The left-handed anti-neutrino has a [[B-L]] of +1 and an [[X (charge)|X charge]] of +5.

Due to the lack of electric charge, hypercharge, and color, sterile neutrinos would not interact [[electromagnetism|electromagnetically]], weakly, or strongly, making them extremely difficult to detect. They have [[Yukawa interaction]]s with ordinary [[leptons]] and [[Higgs boson]]s, which via the [[Higgs mechanism]] lead to mixing with ordinary neutrinos. 
In experiments involving energies larger than their mass they would participate in all processes in which ordinary neutrinos take part, but with a quantum mechanical probability that is suppressed by the small mixing angle. That makes it possible to produce them in experiments if they are light enough. 
They would also interact gravitationally due to their mass, however, and if they are heavy enough, they could explain [[cold dark matter]] or [[warm dark matter]]. In some [[grand unification theories]], such as  [[SO(10)]], they also interact via [[gauge boson|gauge interactions]] which are extremely suppressed at ordinary energies because their [[gauge boson]] is extremely massive. They do not appear at all in some other GUTs, such as the [[GeorgiâGlashow model]] (i.e. all its [[SU(5)]] charges or [[quantum numbers]] are zero).

===Mass===
All particles are initially massless under the Standard Model, since there are no [[Standard Model (mathematical formulation)#Mass terms|Dirac mass terms]] in the Standard Model's [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]. The only mass terms are generated by the [[Higgs mechanism]], which produces non-zero Yukawa couplings between the left-handed components of fermions, the [[Higgs field]], and their right-handed components. This occurs when the [[Special unitary group|'''SU'''(2)]] doublet Higgs field &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; acquires its non-zero vacuum expectation value, &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;, [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously breaking]] its SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;times; U(1) symmetry, and thus yielding non-zero Yukawa couplings:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(\psi) = 
\bar{\psi}(i\partial\!\!\!/)\psi - G\bar\psi_L \phi \psi_R&lt;/math&gt;

Such is the case for charged leptons, like the electron; but within the standard model, the right-handed neutrino does not exist, so even with a Yukawa coupling neutrinos remain massless. In other words, there are no mass terms for neutrinos under the Standard Model: the model only contains a left-handed neutrino and its antiparticle, a right-handed antineutrino, for each generation, produced in weak eigenstates during weak interactions. (See [[Standard Model (mathematical formulation)#Neutrino masses|neutrino masses in the Standard Model]] for a detailed explanation.)

In the [[seesaw mechanism]], one eigenvector of the neutrino mass matrix, which includes sterile neutrinos, is predicted to be significantly heavier than the other.

A sterile neutrino would have the same [[weak hypercharge]], [[weak isospin]], and mass as its antiparticle. For any charged particle, for example the electron, this is not the case: its antiparticle, the [[positron]], has opposite electric charge, among other opposite charges. Similarly, an [[up quark]] has a charge of +{{frac||2|3}} and (for example) a color charge of red, while its antiparticle has an electric charge of &amp;minus;{{frac||2|3}} and a color charge of anti-red.

===Dirac and Majorana terms===
Sterile neutrinos allow the introduction of a [[Dirac mass]] term as usual. This can yield the observed neutrino mass, but it requires that the strength of the Yukawa coupling be much weaker for the electron neutrino than the electron, without explanation. Similar problems (although less severe) are observed in the quark sector, where the top and bottom masses differ by a factor of 40.

Unlike for the left-handed neutrino, a [[Majorana mass]] term can be added for a sterile neutrino without violating local symmetries (weak isospin and weak hypercharge) since it has no weak charge. However, this would still violate total [[lepton number]].

It is possible to include '''both''' Dirac and Majorana terms: this is done in the seesaw mechanism (below). In addition to satisfying the [[Majorana equation]], if the neutrino were also [[real neutral particle|its own antiparticle]], then it would be the first [[Majorana fermion]]. In that case, it could annihilate with another neutrino, allowing [[neutrinoless double beta decay]]. The other case is that it is a [[Dirac fermion]], which is not its own antiparticle.

To put this in mathematical terms, we have to make use of the transformation properties of particles. For free fields, a Majorana field is defined as an eigenstate of charge conjugation. However, neutrinos interact only via the weak interactions, which are not invariant under [[charge conjugation]] (C), so an interacting Majorana neutrino cannot be an eigenstate of C. The generalized definition is: "a [[Majorana fermion|Majorana]] neutrino field is an eigenstate of the CP transformation". Consequently, Majorana and Dirac neutrinos would behave differently under CP transformations (actually [[Lorentz transformations|Lorentz]] and [[CPT symmetry|CPT]] transformations). Also, a massive Dirac neutrino would have nonzero [[magnetic dipole moment|magnetic]] and [[electric dipole moment]]s, whereas a Majorana neutrino would not. However, the Majorana and Dirac neutrinos are different only if their rest mass is not zero. For Dirac neutrinos, the dipole moments are proportional to mass and would vanish for a massless particle. Both Majorana and Dirac mass terms however can appear in the mass [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]].

===Seesaw mechanism===
{{Main|Seesaw mechanism}}

In addition to the left-handed neutrino, which couples to its family charged lepton in weak charged currents, if there is also a right-handed sterile neutrino partner (a [[weak isospin|weak isosinglet]] with zero [[Weak hypercharge|charge]]) then it is possible to add a Majorana mass term without violating electroweak symmetry. Both neutrinos have mass and handedness is no longer preserved (thus "left or right-handed neutrino" means that the state is mostly left or right-handed). To get the neutrino mass eigenstates, we have to diagonalize the general mass matrix &lt;math&gt;M_{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;M_{\nu} = \begin{pmatrix}0&amp;m_D\\m_D&amp;M_{NHL}\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;M_{NHL}&lt;/math&gt; is big and &lt;math&gt;m_D&lt;/math&gt; is of intermediate size terms.

Apart from empirical evidence, there is also a theoretical justification for the seesaw mechanism in various extensions to the Standard Model. Both [[Grand Unification Theories]] (GUTs) and left-right symmetrical models predict the following relation:

:&lt;math&gt;m_{\nu} \ll m_D \ll M_{NHL}&lt;/math&gt;

According to GUTs and left-right models, the right-handed neutrino is extremely heavy: {{nowrap|''M&lt;sub&gt;NHL&lt;/sub&gt;'' â {{val|e=5}}&amp;ndash;{{val|e=12|u=GeV}}}}, while the smaller eigenvalue is approximately equal to

:&lt;math&gt;m_{\nu} \approx \frac{m_D^2}{M_{NHL}}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the [[seesaw mechanism]]: as the sterile right-handed neutrino gets heavier, the normal left-handed neutrino gets lighter. The left-handed neutrino is a mixture of two Majorana neutrinos, and this mixing process is how sterile neutrino mass is generated.

==Detection attempts==
The production and decay of sterile neutrinos could happen through the mixing with virtual ("off mass shell") neutrinos. There were several experiments set up to discover or observe NHLs, for example the [[NuTeV]] (E815) experiment at [[Fermilab]] or [[LEP-l3]] at [[CERN]]. They all led to establishing limits to observation, rather than actual observation of those particles. If they are indeed a constituent of dark matter, sensitive [[X-ray]] detectors would be needed to observe the radiation emitted by their decays.&lt;ref name=bbcwdm&gt;{{cite web |last=Battison |first=Leila |publisher=[[BBC News]] |title=Dwarf galaxies suggest dark matter theory may be wrong |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14948730 |date=2011-09-16 |accessdate=2011-09-18 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sterile neutrinos may mix with ordinary neutrinos via a [[Dirac mass]] after [[electroweak symmetry breaking]], in analogy to [[quarks]] and charged [[leptons]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
Sterile neutrinos and (in more-complicated models) ordinary neutrinos may also have [[Majorana equation|Majorana mass]]es. In the type 1 [[seesaw mechanism]] both Dirac and Majorana masses are used to drive ordinary neutrino masses down and make the sterile neutrinos much heavier than the Standard Model's interacting neutrinos. In some models{{Which|date=November 2009}} the heavy neutrinos can be as heavy as the [[GUT scale]] ({{val|p=â|e=15|u=GeV}}). In other models{{Which|date=November 2009}} they could be lighter than the [[W-boson|weak gauge bosons W and Z]] as in the so-called [[Î½MSM]] model where their masses are between GeV and keV. A light (with the mass {{val|p=â|1|u=eV}}) sterile neutrino was suggested as a possible explanation of the results of the [[Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector]] experiment.
On 11&amp;nbsp;April 2007, researchers at the [[MiniBooNE]] experiment at [[Fermilab]] announced that they had not found any evidence supporting the existence of such a sterile neutrino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-boone.fnal.gov/publicpages/First_Results.pdf |title=First results |department=Booster Neutrino Experiment (BooNE) |publisher=[[Fermilab|Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab)]] |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; More-recent results and analysis have provided some support for the existence of the sterile neutrino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&amp;ARTICLEID_CHAR=9D2C5D4D-2B35-221B-6C9DB167634A6DDB |magazine=Scientific American |title=Dimensional shortcuts |date=August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The number of neutrinos and the masses of the particles can have large-scale effects that shape the appearance of the [[cosmic microwave background]]. The total number of neutrino species, for instance, affects the rate at which the cosmos expanded in its earliest epochs: more neutrinos means a faster expansion. The Planck Satellite 2013 data release is compatible with the existence of a sterile neutrino.

A list of passengers was provided in the fifth press release on the crash from TACA Airlines. This list was in the Spanish and English sections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.taca.com/esp/nws/nwsbro.asp?key=897 Noticias GRUPO TACA BOLETÃN INFORMATIVO No. 5]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602011953/http://news.taca.com/esp/nws/nwsbro.asp?key=897|date=June 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five people died as a result of the accident, including Captain D'Antonio. The deceased passengers were later confirmed as Jeanne Chantal Neele, wife of Brian Michael Fraser Neele ([[Brazil]]'s ambassador to Honduras), and Nicaraguan businessman [[Harry Brautigam]], president of the [[Central American Bank for Economic Integration]]; Brautigam died from a heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2008-05-31/world/honduras.crash_1_runway-passengers-toncontin-international-airport?_s=PM:WORLD Five die as Honduras jet overshoots runway] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324130908/http://articles.cnn.com/2008-05-31/world/honduras.crash_1_runway-passengers-toncontin-international-airport?_s=PM:WORLD |date=2012-03-24 }}." ''[[CNN]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ambassador Fraser Neele sustained injuries in the crash. The former head of the [[military of Honduras|Honduran armed forces]], General Daniel LÃ³pez Carballo, was also injured. There were two fatalities on the ground, one a taxi driver, in one of three vehicles crushed on the street by the aircraft. Mario Castillo, a survivor, said that the business class passengers sustained the most serious injuries.&lt;ref name="Diversions"/&gt;

==Investigation==
Honduran authorities delegated the investigation of the accident to the [[Civil Aviation Authority (El Salvador)|Civil Aviation Authority]] of [[El Salvador]] as per the [[Convention on International Civil Aviation]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.aac.gob.sv/archivos/cai/390.pdf Preliminary Report]." ([https://www.webcitation.org/5zhRi2VrA?url=http://www.aac.gob.sv/archivos/cai/390.pdf Archive]) Civil Aviation Authority (El Salvador). Retrieved June 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The accident report stated that the airplane had landed with a 12-knot tailwind, 400 meters from the displaced approach end of the runway. Since this was the first intermediate stop on a long transcontinental flight, the aircraft was near its upper landing-weight limit (63.5t vs. 64.5t maximum allowable). In addition, the runway was wet, due to the passage of [[Tropical Storm Alma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20080530-0|title=Accident description, Friday 30 May 2008, TACA International Airlines, EI-TAF|work=ASN|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''twelve-angled stone''' is an [[archeological]] artefact in [[Cuzco]], [[Peru]]. It was part of a stone wall of an [[Inca Empire|Inca]] palace, and is considered to be a national heritage object. The stone is currently part of a wall of the palace of the Archbishop of Cuzco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.municusco.gob.pe/web/contenido.php?id_item=48&amp;tab=5|title=Lugares turÃ­sticos (Tourist site)|publisher=municusco.gob.pe|date=July 14, 2014|language=Spanish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714203004/http://www.municusco.gob.pe/web/contenido.php?id_item=48&amp;tab=5|archivedate=July 14, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

[[File:Piedra de los 12 Ã¡ngulos 2.gif|150px|left|border]] 

The twelve-angled stone is composed of a formation of [[Diorite|diorite]] rocks  {{Citation needed|reason=The stone's composition isn't externally apparent|date=October 2018}} and is recognized by its fine finishing and twelve-angled border, an example of perfectionist Incan architecture. The block is categorized as Cultural Heritage of the Nation of Peru and is located in the city of Cuzco, 1105 km from Lima. The stone is a great example of Inca knowledge in the evolution of construction. There are other stones with the same vertices but the twelve-angled stone is the most famous.

As an example of the Incaâs advanced stonework, the stone is a popular tourist attraction in Cuzco and a site of pride for many locals. The perfectly cut stone is part of a wall known as the Hatun Rumiyoc, which makes up the outside of the Archbishopâs palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.peruviantimes.com/10/cuscos-twelve-angle-stone-defaced/21712/|title=Cuscoâs Twelve Angle Stone Defaced |publisher=www.peruviantimes.com|date=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Vestas]] V90-3MW''' is a three bladed upwind [[wind turbine]] generator that uses pitch control and a [[DFIG|doubly fed induction generator]] (50&amp;nbsp;Hz version). Its manufacturer claims to have installed over 500 units of this type globally since launch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090706121351/http://www.vestas.com/en/wind-power-solutions/wind-turbines/3.0-mw Vestas   3.0 MW&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vestas claims the turbine provides 50% more power for roughly the same weight as the V80.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The V90-3MW should not be confused with the V90-2MW, which is essentially a V80-2MW with longer blades. It is produced in both an on and offshore version.

The first V90-3MW was erected in northern Germany in May 2002. 15 test turbines were deployed around the world in different climatic conditions, so that when it went into production, the V90-3MW had been tested in more sites than the V80-2MW. Following a number of gearbox problems, the V90-3MW was withdrawn for offshore sales in early 2007 before being reissued for offshore use in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.vestas.com/files//Filer/EN/Investor/Company_announcements/2008/080218-MFKUK-11.pdf |title=''V90-3.0 MW offshore wind turbine back on the market again'', Vestas Press Release 18th Feb 2008 |access-date=2008-04-22 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090707005200/http://www.vestas.com/files//Filer/EN/Investor/Company_announcements/2008/080218-MFKUK-11.pdf |archive-date=2009-07-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Presently, the nacelles are exclusively made at the Vestas Nacelles works in [[Taranto]], Italy. Towers and blades may come from a number of locations. Vestas produces a 3.65 MW low-wind version called the V136.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business.dk/energi/vestas-paa-vej-med-ny-landbaseret-kaempemoelle&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences between V90-3 and V90-2/V80s==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
Differences from its predecessor model the V80 include use of an oil cooled generator, and a compact gearbox, which now butts up directly to the hub rather than through a low speed shaft. The V90-3MW can be differentiated from the V80 by the shape of the [[nacelle]], which has a cut-out profile at the back. Other differences include:
* Does not use a low speed shaft (the gearbox is integral to the main bearing).
* Generator is liquid cooled (with an associated additional cooling system).
* Lighter tower construction
* Different shape of the back of the nacelle to accommodate this cooling system.
* Yawing system which used six motors rather than four.
* The V90-3 uses gearboxes manufactured by [[Hansen Transmissions]], a subsidiary of ZF Wind Power Antwerpen
* Additional frame structure on nose cone to accommodate hub escape hatch.
* Disc brake for parking.
* New blade construction incorporating carbon fiber in main spar
* Vortex shedders on blades.

The V90-3MW can be specified with one of five different 'noise modes'. Each mode is set in the turbine software as part of the installation, although may be changed to another mode later. Each different noise mode implies a different power curve, so that for quieter operation, some energy yield is sacrificed. [[Noise mitigation]] is managed by adjustments to the blade pitch angle.

For licensing reasons, the 60&amp;nbsp;Hz model sold in the US and Canada uses a slightly different converter system, allowing only one-way power flow through the rotor converter, rather than 2-way power flow used in the standard version. This restriction does not apply to 60&amp;nbsp;Hz models sold in other regions (i.e. Japan).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3003">The '''West number''' is an empirical parameter used to characterize the performance of '''[[Stirling engine]]s''' and other Stirling systems. It is very similar to the [[Beale number]] where a larger number indicates higher performance; however, the West number includes temperature compensation. The West number is often used to approximate of the [[Power (physics)|power]] output of a Stirling engine. The average value is (0.25) [http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cppr/y2001/rpt/27113.pdf] for a wide variety of engines, although it may range up to (0.35) [http://www.bekkoame.ne.jp/~khirata/academic/simple/simplee.htm], particularly for engines operating with a high [[temperature]] differential.

The West number may be defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;W_n = \frac{Wo}{P V f} \frac{(T_H + T_K)}{(T_H - T_K)} = B_n \frac{(T_H + T_K)}{(T_H - T_K)}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*'''W&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the West number 
*'''W&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the power output of the engine ([[watt]]s)
*'''P''' is the [[Arithmetic_mean|mean average]] gas [[pressure]] ([[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]) or ([[MPa]], if volume is in cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
*'''V''' is swept [[volume]] of the expansion space (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) or (cmÂ³, if pressure is in MPa)
*'''f''' is the engine cycle [[frequency]] ([[Hertz|Hz]])
*'''T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the absolute [[temperature]] of the expansion space or [[heater]] ([[kelvin]]s)
*'''T&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the absolute temperature of the compression space or cooler (kelvins)
*'''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the [[Beale number]] for an engine operating between temperatures ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''H''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;  

When the Beale number is known, but the West number is not known, it is possible to calculate it.  First calculate the West number at the temperatures ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''H''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt; for which the Beale number is known, and then use the resulting West number to calculate output power for other temperatures.

To estimate the power output of a new engine design, nominal values are assumed for the West number, pressure, swept volume and frequency, and the power is calculated as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;W_o = W_n P V f \frac{(T_H - T_K)}{(T_H + T_K)} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cppr/y2001/rpt/27113.pdf ornl-tm-10475&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, with an absolute temperature ratio of 2, the portion of the equation representing temperature correction equals 1/3. With a temperature ratio of 3, the temperature term is 1/2. This factor accounts for the difference between the West equation, and the Beale equation in which this temperature term is taken as a constant. Thus, the Beale number is typically in the range of 0.10 to 0.15, which is about 1/3 to 1/2 the value of the West number.
