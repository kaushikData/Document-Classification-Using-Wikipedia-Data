'''Alexis 'Lexi' Brasseur''' (26 December 1860 – 3 November 1924) was a [[Luxembourg]]eois playwright, composer, and metallurgist.

Born in [[Luxembourg City]] as the oldest son of [[Dominique Brasseur]], Brasseur attended the [[Athénée de Luxembourg]].  He followed this by studying law at the [[University of Bonn]], where he met [[Batty Weber]].&lt;ref name="Mersch 95"&gt;Mersch (1959), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;  Brasseur received his doctorate in Luxembourg in 1886, and was [[call to the bar|called to the bar]], but showed little interest in working in the law.  He turned to [[metallurgy]], like his father and uncle [[Pierre Brasseur (Luxembourg)|Pierre]].&lt;ref name="Mersch 95" /&gt;

In 1894, he had written a [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] with Batty Weber called ''De Monoonk Phëlpp''.&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1959), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1907, he moved to Paris, staying there for four years.&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1959), pp. 95–6&lt;/ref&gt;  Brasseur died in Luxembourg City on 3 November 1924.&lt;ref name="Mersch 99"&gt;Mersch (1959), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexis Brasseur was a member of the prominent [[Brasseur family]].  His father, [[Dominique Brasseur|Dominique]], was a [[deputy (legislator)|deputy]] (1866 – 99) and [[mayor of Luxembourg City]] (1891 – 94).  His brother, [[Robert Brasseur|Robert]], was a deputy and founded the [[Liberal League (Luxembourg)|Liberal League]].&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1959), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexis Brasseur married Jeanne Bian (1869–1960), sister of the liberal deputy [[Félix Bian]] and industrialist [[Émile Bian]].&lt;ref name="Mersch 99" /&gt;  They had three children.&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1959), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Business economics''' is a field in [[applied economics]] which uses [[economic theory]] and quantitative methods to analyze [[Business|business enterprises]] and the factors contributing to the diversity of organizational structures and the relationships of firms with labour, [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and product markets.&lt;ref name="Moschandreas"&gt;Moschandreas, Maria (2000). ''Business Economics'', 2nd Edition, Thompson Learning,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=ncVfjhTULyAC&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PA410#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Description] and chapter-preview [https://books.google.com/books?id=ncVfjhTULyAC&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PR5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false links].&lt;/ref&gt; A professional focus of the journal ''[[Business Economics (journal)|Business Economics]]'' has been expressed as providing "practical information for people who apply economics in their jobs."&lt;ref&gt;National Association for Business Economics, ''[http://www.nabe.com/busecon.htm ''Business Economics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111082746/http://www.nabe.com/busecon.htm |date=November 11, 2011 }}''®&lt;/ref&gt;
Business economics is an integral part of traditional economics. It is an extension of economic concepts to the real business situations. It is an applied science in the sense of a tool of managerial decision-making and forward planning by management. In other words, Business economics is concerned with the application of economic theory to business management.

==Subject matter==
Business economics is concerned with economic issues and problems related to business organization, management, and strategy. Issues and problems include: an explanation of why ''corporate'' firms emerge and exist; why they expand: horizontally, vertically and spacially; the role of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship; the significance of organizational structure; the relationship of firms with the employees, the providers of capital, the customers, the government; the interactions between firms and the business environment.&lt;ref name="Moschandreas"/&gt;

==Ambiguity in the use of term==
The term 'business economics' is used in a variety of ways.  Sometimes it is used as synonymously with industrial economics/[[industrial organisation]], [[managerial economics]], and economics for business. Still, there may be substantial differences in the usage of 'economics for business' and 'managerial economics' with the latter used more narrowly.
One view of the distinctions between these would be that business economics is wider in its scope than industrial economics in that it would be concerned not only with "industry" but also businesses in the service sector. Economics for business looks at the major principles of economics but focuses on applying these economic principles to the real world of business.&lt;ref&gt;Sloman, J and Sutcliffe (2004) Economics for Business, Financial Times/ Prentice Hall; 3 edition&lt;/ref&gt; Managerial economics is the application of economic methods in the managerial decision-making process.&lt;ref&gt;• Jones, Trefor, 2004 ''Business Economics and Managerial Decision Making'', Wiley. [http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP000988.html Description] and chapter-preview  [https://books.google.com/books?id=qr7TORfhBwQC&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PR7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false links].&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Wilkinson, Nick (2005). ''Managerial Economics: A Problem-Solving Approach'', Cambridge University Press. [http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1170271/?site_locale=en_GB Description] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=O-Fv7B4J-6EC&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PR5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretations from various universities ==
Many universities offer courses in business economics and offer a range of interpretations as to the meaning of the word.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uel.ac.uk/programmes/business/undergraduate/summary/businesseco.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bachelor of Business Economics (BBE) Program at [[University of Delhi]] is designed to meet the growing need for an analytical and quantitative approach to problem solving in the changing corporate world by the application of the latest techniques evolved in the fields of economics and business.&lt;ref&gt;http://du.ac.in/du/index.php?page=business-economics-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] (UAB), the [[Universidad Pública de Navarra]] (UPNa) and the [[University of the Balearic Islands]] (UIB) developed an official Master of Science in Management, Organization and Business Economics focused on management and business topics to train professionals in the study of organizations, on a conceptual and quantitative basis. To achieve this, advanced analysis tools are used from the fields of [[Neoclassical economics]], [[New institutional economics]], [[Statistics]], [[Econometrics]] and [[Operations research]]. This focus is complemented with contributing ideas and theories to develop the necessary instruments to facilitate the management of sophisticated and complex organizations.&lt;ref&gt;UAB,UPNa, UIB - Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Management, Organization and Business Economics - MMOBE Program. [http://pagines.uab.cat/mmobe/ Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

The program at [[Harvard University]] uses economic methods to analyze practical aspects of business, including [[business administration]], management, and related fields of business economics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gsas.harvard.edu/programs_of_study/business_economics_4.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Miami]] defines business economics as involving the study of how we use our resources for the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.  This requires business economists to analyze social institutions, banks, the stock market, the government and their relationships with labor negotiations, taxes, international trade, and urban and environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.miami.muohio.edu/academics/majorsminors/majors/businesseconomics.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725091346/http://www.miami.muohio.edu/academics/majorsminors/majors/businesseconomics.cfm |archivedate=2009-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Courses at the [[University of Manchester]] interpret business economics to be concerned with the economic analysis of how businesses contribute to welfare of society rather than on the welfare of an individual or a business. This is done via an examination of the relationship between ownership, control and firm objectives; theories of the growth of the firm; the behavioural [[theory of the firm]]; theories of entrepreneurship; the factors that influence the [[Structure-conduct-performance paradigm|structure, conduct and performance]] of business at the industry level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/modules/modulelist.html?department%3D3%26newcode%3DECON2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224053759/http://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/modules/modulelist.html?department=3&amp;newcode=ECON2 |archivedate=2008-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian Universities borrow their concept of business economics from the tradition of [[Gino Zappa]], for example a standard course&lt;ref&gt;https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/schedaincarico/schedaincarico/controller/scheda_pubblica/SchedaPublic.do?&amp;evn_default=evento&amp;c_classe=618079&amp;__pj0=0&amp;__pj1=6f3356db456e221b165cf3ee421a14ec&lt;/ref&gt;  at the [[Politecnico di Milano]] involves studying [[corporate governance]], [[accounting]], [[investment analysis]], [[budgeting]] and [[business strategy]].

[[La Trobe University]] of Melbourne, Australia associates business economics with the process of demand, supply and equilibrium coordinating the behaviour of individuals and businesses in the market. Also, business economics extends to government policy, economic variables and international factors which influence business and competition.

The Center for Copyright Information was formed in September 2011 to coordinate efforts between the television, film and music industries and service providers to curb online [[copyright infringement]] and educate Internet subscribers about the issue.&lt;ref name=CCIRelease&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/press-release/center-for-copyright-information-announces-three-major-steps-towards-implementation/ |title=Center for Copyright Information Announces Three Major Steps Towards Implementation |date= April 2012 |work=www.copyrightinformation.org |publisher=Center for Copyright Information |accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RIAA began negotiations to create the Center for Copyright Information and its Copyright Alert System in December 2008, after it ceased a five-year litigation campaign against individual file sharers.&lt;ref name=Kravets11&gt;{{cite news |title=ISPs to Disrupt Internet Access of Copyright Scofflaws |first=David |last=Kravets |url= https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/07/disrupting-internet-access/ |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=7 July 2011 |accessdate= 20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2003 and 2008, the RIAA adopted a practice of suing individual file sharers; previously it had focused on efforts to shut down [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] services.&lt;ref name=Kravets10&gt;{{cite news |title=Copyright Lawsuits Plummet in Aftermath of RIAA Campaign |first=David |last=Kravets |url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/05/riaa-bump/ |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate= 20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MPAA and RIAA, along with the [[Independent Film &amp; Television Alliance]] and [[American Association of Independent Music]], as associations representing independent producers in their fields, reached an agreement in July 2011 with five large ISPs to create the Copyright Alerts System.&lt;ref name=Kravets11/&gt; The trade groups argued copyright infringement was costing the U.S. economy hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in lost earnings and tax revenue annually.&lt;ref name=Richwine11&gt;{{cite news |title=Internet providers to act against online pirates |first=Lisa |last=Richwine |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/07/us-internet-piracy-idUSTRE7667FL20110707 |work=[[Reuters]] |date=7 July 2011 |accessdate= 20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] helped bring parties to the table as part of his 2008 work with Internet service providers to block access to online [[child pornography]].&lt;ref name=Sisario11&gt;{{cite news |title=To Slow Piracy, Internet Providers Ready Penalties |first=Ben |last=Sisario |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/08/technology/to-slow-piracy-internet-providers-ready-penalties.html?_r=0 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=7 July 2011 |accessdate= 3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the July 2011 agreement, several U.S. Internet service providers, including [[Verizon Communications]], [[Comcast]], [[Time Warner Cable]], [[Cablevision Systems]] and [[AT&amp;T]] agreed to send alerts to customers who appeared to be using their accounts for illegal downloading.&lt;ref name=Richwine11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloomberg&gt;{{cite news |title=AT&amp;T Joins Verizon in Fighting Web Piracy of Movies, Music |first=Eric |last=Engelman |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-07/at-t-joins-verizon-in-fight-against-web-piracy-of-movies-music.html |work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=7 July 2011 |accessdate= 20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the agreement 75% of all broadband internet usage was provided by one of these five companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ernesto|title=HAS YOUR ISP JOINED THE US "SIX STRIKES" ANTI-PIRACY SCHEME?|url=http://torrentfreak.com/isp-six-strikes-anti-piracy-scheme-120803/|publisher=Torrent Freak|accessdate=6 March 2014|date=August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;    The Memorandum of Understanding established that copyright holders and ISP’s would split the costs of the system 50/50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ernesto|title="SIX STRIKES"COPYRIGHT ALERT SYSTEM COSTS MILLIONS|url=http://torrentfreak.com/six-strikescopyright-alert-system-costs-millions-131017/|publisher=Torrent Freak|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   According to the CCI’s first tax filing, chronicling the first 8 months of the companies operations, CSA operation costs were $1,377,633.00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Center For Copyright Information Tax Return 2011|url=https://bulk.resource.org/irs.gov/eo/2013_06_EO/45-3366529_990O_201206.pdf|work=IRS Form 2011|accessdate=6 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307010426/https://bulk.resource.org/irs.gov/eo/2013_06_EO/45-3366529_990O_201206.pdf#|archive-date=2014-03-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2011, the [[Obama administration]] praised the formation of the CCI on the official [[White House Blog]] as "a positive step” and consistent with the executive branch’s strategy of encouraging voluntary intellectual property enforcement.&lt;ref name=WhiteHouse&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/07/07/working-together-stop-internet-piracy  |title=Working Together to Stop Internet Piracy |author=Victoria Espinel |date=7 July 2011 |work=www.whitehouse.gov |publisher=The White House |accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the CCI had its corporate status revoked according to the Columbia Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs for failing to file the proper paperwork, which they quickly resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sam|title=US Center for Copyright Information Lost Its Title|url=http://extratorrent.cc/article/2950/us+center+for+copyright+information+lost+its+title.html|publisher=Extra Torrent|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2013, the CCI announced it would be supporting iKeepSafe’s pilot program. iKeepSafe, is an independently created curriculum designed to educate children about copyright law and fair use in the digital age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mann|first=Colin|title=Six strikes’ effective in piracy fight|url=http://advanced-television.com/2014/02/26/six-strikes-effective-in-piracy-fight/|publisher=Advanced Television|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership and advisors===
CCI is led by an executive committee, with Executive Director Jill Lesser as its head. Lesser was previously the senior vice president of domestic public policy for [[AOL]], as well as the deputy director of public policy at [[People for the American Way]].&lt;ref name=CCIAbout&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/about-cci/ |title=About the Center for Copyright Information |work=www.copyrightinformation.org |publisher=Center for Copyright Information |accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the CCI has an advisory board which "consults actively on issues the Executive Committee is considering."&lt;ref name=CCIAbout /&gt; The CCI's original advisory board includes consumer advocates Jerry Berman, founder of the [[Center for Democracy and Technology]]; [[Gigi Sohn]], president and CEO of [[Public Knowledge]]; and Jules Polonetsky, director and co-chair of the [[Future of Privacy Forum]].&lt;ref name=CCIAbout /&gt;&lt;ref name=Masnick12&gt;{{cite news |last=Masnick |first=Mike |title=Organization Overseeing Six Strikes Agreement Between Labels And ISPs Includes Advisory Board To Try To Keep Tech Folks Happy |url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120402/18015918339/organization-overseeing-six-strikes-agreement-between-labels-isps-includes-advisory-board-to-try-to-keep-tech-folks-happy.shtml  |date=2 April 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leslie Harris, former President of the Center of Democracy and Technology replaced  Gigi Sohn when she was asked by the Chairman of Federal Communication’s Commission, Tom Wheeler, to run the FCC’s External Affairs branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tummarello|first=Kate|title='Six strikes' thwarting piracy, leader says|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/199124-six-strikes-thwarting-piracy-leader-says|publisher=The Hill|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright Alert System==

{{Main|Copyright Alert System}}

The Copyright Alert System uses third parties to identify when copyrighted information is shared via peer-to-peer services. These third parties inform Internet service providers, which then send an alert to the relevant customer. The Copyright Alert System was launched in February 2013 by the Center for Copyright Information.&lt;ref name=Stewart13&gt;{{cite news |title=Warning System Launched for Movie, Music Pirates |first=Christopher |last=Stewart |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323699704578326402159158748 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=26 February 2013 |accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCI has stated that the primary goal of the system is "to make consumers aware of activity that has occurred using their Internet accounts, educate them on how they can prevent such activity from happening again, and provide information about the growing number of ways to access digital content legally."&lt;ref name=CCI1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/uncategorized/the-copyright-alert-system-moving-to-implementation/ |title=The Copyright Alert System: Moving to Implementation |author=Jill Lesser Espinel |work=www.copyrightinformation.org |publisher=Center for Copyright Information |accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chang Jung-fa''' [[CBE]] ({{zh|c=張榮發|p=Zhāng Róngfā}}; 6 October 1927 – 20 January 2016) was a Taiwanese businessman. He founded and chaired the [[Evergreen Group]].

== Biography ==
Chang was born in [[Su'ao]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2016/01/21/2003637689|archivedate=21 January 2016|last1=Sun|first1=Yu-Huay|title=Chang Yung-fa, Taiwan's Evergreen Group Founder, Dies at 88|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-20/chang-yung-fa-founder-of-taiwan-s-evergreen-group-dies-at-88|accessdate=20 January 2016|work=Bloomberg|date=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Taiwan was under Japanese rule]]. When he was seven, the family moved to [[Keelung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wang|first1=Shu-fen|last2=Liu|first2=Claudia|last3=Wu|first3=Lilian|title=Evergreen Group founder passes away|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aeco/201601200021.aspx|accessdate=20 January 2016|agency=Central News Agency|date=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from Taipei Commercial High School at the age of 18, he went to work in the [[Taipei]] office of a Japanese shipping line. He continued his education by taking night classes at a vocational school in Taipei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2016/01/20/taiwans-evergreen-marine-billionaire-founder-chang-yung-fa-dies/#2715e4857a0b7b408c823cc0|title=Taiwan's Evergreen Marine Billionaire Founder Chang Yung-fa Dies|author=Russell Flannery|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], he joined the seagoing staff of a local shipping company as [[third mate|third officer]]. His subsequent career was spent with various local companies and he progressed through the ranks to [[Captain (nautical)|captain]].

In 1961, Chang and some friends jointly established a shipping company and, having helped this company to develop, he decided to branch out on his own, establishing Evergreen Marine Corporation on 1 September 1968 with just one secondhand 15,000 ton vessel, Central Trust.

Over the next four years, Chang built his fleet up to twelve, running them empty when necessary to convince his customers his services were regular and reliable. Within a year, he had expanded to the Middle East. Within three, Chang was dispatching Evergreen ships to the Caribbean.

In 1975, Chang realised that containerisation was the way forward. He built four advanced S-type container ships and launched his [[US East Coast]] service. Fifteen months later, he added the [[West coast of the United States]] to his network. Europe followed in 1979.

By 1984, he started his most ambitious service yet- two 80-day round-the-world services, one circling the globe in an easterly direction, the other westward. Departing every 10 days, the 20 G-type container ships he employed had a capacity of 2,728 containers each and could travel at a speed of 20.5 [[knot (unit)|knots]].

The Evergreen Group has expanded beyond the shipping industry to encompass operations in heavy industrial development, air transport, hotels and resorts services.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;Jennings, Ralph. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphjennings/2013/07/03/morality-play/ "Morality Play: Chang Yung-Fa Fosters A Culture Of Doing The Right Thing"], ''Forbes'', 3 July 2013. Retrieved 27 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Evergreen Group, with over 27,000 employees and more than 220 offices worldwide, now comprises about 30 major corporations worldwide, 3 of which are listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. During the 2012 Republic of China presidential election, Mr Chang expressed his disapproval of the so-called [[Taiwan Consensus]]. The China Post reported that he said that the ""Taiwan Consensus" smacks of Taiwan independence" which the paper said was "not his cup of tea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ting|first1=David Kan|title=Taiwan's Re-Election of KMT's Ma Is Nod|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/commentary/the-china-post/david-ting/2012/01/20/329564/Taiwans-re-election.htm|accessdate=21 January 2016|work=China Post|date=20 January 2012|archiveurl=https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1P3-2564902241/taiwan-s-re-election-of-kmt-s-ma-is-nod|archivedate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012, it was reported that Chang had pledged "to give away all his wealth" (approximately US$1.69&amp;nbsp;billion), primarily via the [[Chang Yung-fa Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2012/02/08/330949/Evergreen-founder.htm "Evergreen founder to donate entire fortune"], ''China Post'', 8 February 2012.

His second wife Lee Yu-mei bore him one son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wei|first1=Shu|last2=Chang|first2=S.C.|title=Evergreen group 'regrets' Chang Kuo-wei's announcement of taking helm|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aeco/201602180032.aspx|accessdate=18 February 2016|agency=Central News Agency|date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 January 2016, Chang died at the age of 88.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=As of 2:22&amp;nbsp;am |url=http://www.todayonline.com/business/chang-yung-fa-founder-taiwans-evergreen-group-dies-88 |title=Chang Yung-fa, founder of Taiwan's Evergreen Group, dies at 88 |work=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernesto Carlos Tornquist''' (31 December 1842 – 17 June 1908) is considered to be one of the most important entrepreneurs in Argentina at the end of the 19th century.  The diversified business empire he created played a key role in helping to link Argentina with the trading and financial systems of the first world.  Amongst many other achievements, he founded the Tornquist Bank, the Plaza Hotel in [[Buenos Aires]], the [[Partidos of Buenos Aires|partido]] of [[Tornquist Partido|Tornquist]] and [[Tornquist, Buenos Aires|Tornquist]] its main city, in the south of [[Buenos Aires Province]].

== Biography ==
Born in Buenos Aires in 1842, Ernesto Tornquist was the seventh son of Jorge Pedro Ernesto Tornquist (1801-1876), a [[Lutheran]] born in [[Baltimore]], United States and whose parents came from a [[Germany|German]] family in the city of [[Hamburg]] with roots in [[Karlskrona]] in Sweden. The father was consul of the city of [[Bremen]] in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], and was an importer and property investor in Buenos Aires. His mother, Rosa Camusso Alsina, a [[Catholic]], was born in Buenos Aires in 1805 and died there of [[yellow fever]] in 1871.

Tornquist started his schooling at Escuela Evangélica Alemana and in 1856 was sent to study in Germany in the city of [[Krefeld]] for two years.  On his return to Argentina he took up a job working for a company directed by his brother-in-law which [[export]]ed [[wool]] and [[leather]] and [[import]]ed [[agricultural machinery]].  In 1872 he married his niece, Rosa Altgelt Tornquist in Buenos Aires, and in 1874 took over the running of his brother-in-law’s company which was now renamed, ''Ernesto Tornquist y Cia''.  With the help of Belgium capital the company diversified its activities to include investment in the sugar, meat-salting and cold-storage industries.  The company also invested in railways and acquired land in the provinces of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] and [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Rios]],  previously occupied by Indians.  In the 1880s he set up a large sugar refinery, ''Refineria Argentina'', in [[Rosario]].  Other initiatives included founding the ''Bieckert'' brewery, the ''Seeber'' [[margarine]] manufacturer and the ''Bianchetti'' [[Weighing scale|scale]] manufacturer.
[[File:Marriott Plaza Hotel Buenos Aires, Argentina - exterior.JPG|right|thumb|150px|Marriott Plaza Hotel]]

On 17 April 1883 he founded Tornquist, the main city of Tornquist Partido, in the south of Buenos Aires Province.  From the beginning the town was organized as an agricultural colony for German and [[Volga German]] immigrants.  After the economic crisis of 1890 he took charge of organizing the recovery of the company ''Sansinena'' and its cold-storage plant ''La Negra'' in [[Villa Riachuelo|Riachuelo]] and set up the plant ''Cuartreros'' in [[Bahía Blanca]].

Amongst other activities the Tornquist group organised the hunting of whales (not controversial in those days) around the [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia Islands]] through  the ''Compañía Argentina de Pesca'', oil exploration in [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], the exploitation of [[Quebracho tree|quebracho]] in [[Santiago del Estero]] and the construction of the Ferrocarril del Norte de Santa Fe with the help of Belgium capital.

Ernesto Tornquist played a crucial role in helping to avoid a war between [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] in 1902 by managing the British mediation in the border dispute, and by strongly opposing the bellicose Foreign Minister [[Estanislao Zeballos]].  He represented the German armaments group [[Krupp]] in Buenos Aires where he organised a strong lobby for the armaments industry, whilst on the other hand he helped to resolve a conflict with Brazil.

In 1903 he built the [[estancia]], ''Sierra de la Ventana'', in Tornquist, designed by the German immigrant architect [[Carlos Nordmann]] in [[Gothic Architecture|Gothic]] style typical of German castles in the [[Rhine|Rhine Valley]].  The grounds were designed by the French immigrant landscape architect, [[Carlos Thays]].

He maintained a close friendship with Argentine presidents [[Julio A. Roca]] and [[Carlos Pellegrini]] and tenaciously opposed the militaristic plans of the War Minister Estanislao Zeballos during the presidency of [[José Figueroa Alcorta]] (1906-1910).

In 1909 he built the [[Marriott Plaza Hotel, Buenos Aires|Plaza Hotel]] (today called the Marriott Plaza Hotel), designed by the German architect Alfredo Zucker, in Florida street, overlooking [[Plaza San Martín (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Martin]] in Buenos Aires.

He died in 1908 in Buenos Aires and since 1980 his remains are buried in the local church in the town of Tornquist.

== Objective ==
The goal of the player is to maximize [[profit (economics)|profit]] and drive the [[competition]] out of business. The player accomplishes this goal by distributing [[money]] to the different company needs in order to reach a successful business.

== Gameplay ==
The player is given control of a potion company and goes through each day in two basic modes. The first consists of a time period to determine how the [[budget]] should be allocated.

Among the day-to-day decisions that are made are pricing, supplies, research, and upgrades. The [[Weather]] is also an important factor when deciding what will happen in the coming day.

Other people to interact with in this mode include a loan shark, goons, marketing, and [[freelancers]] that are willing to do things for a price.

Occasionally, well-known [[fairy tale]] characters such as [[Cinderella]] or [[Little Red Riding Hood]] will initiate events that will allow the user to make decisions regarding the incident, leading to anything from gifts and upgrades to the loss of supplies.

The second mode consists of [[curse]]d customers with various ailments walking around town looking to buy potions to cure their problems. During this time period, the player is allowed to set the speed to Normal, Fast, or Very Fast. Through various upgrades, the user is also allowed to trigger changes in the decisions of the citizens of the town and fix problems such as [[shortages]] in supplies or overpriced potions.

Rockefeller was born in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] on April 3, 1882 to Almira Geraldine Goodsell and [[William Rockefeller]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge obituary|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wPUlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bfMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5765,1068489&amp;dq=geraldine+rockefeller+dodge&amp;hl=en|work=[[The Miami News]]|date=August 14, 1973|accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; She grew up at [[Rockwood Hall]], her father's estate in [[Mount Pleasant, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;http://fultonhistory.com/Newspapers%2023/Tarrytown%20Ny%20Daily%20News/Tarrytown%20Ny%20Daily%20News%201962/Tarrytown%20Ny%20Daily%20News%201962%20-%201360.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

She married [[Marcellus Hartley Dodge Sr.]], president of The [[Remington Arms Company]] and, she brought into the marriage an estimated personal fortune of $101 million. They were married on April 18, 1907 in [[Manhattan]], where both resided, in a small ceremony at the residence of the bride's family, following the contemporary customs dictated by a mourning period after the death of the groom's father in February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Miss Rockefeller Wedded To Mr. Dodge.

The couple had only one child, [[Marcellus Hartley Dodge Jr.]], whom they called "Hartley". He was killed in an automobile accident on August 29, 1930 in Mogesca, [[France]]. In his memory, his mother purchased a large parcel of land for twenty thousand dollars and gave [[Madison, New Jersey]] the property and the Hartley Dodge Memorial Building which was dedicated on Memorial Day, Thursday, May 30, 1935 and used as the borough hall. ''[[The New York Times]]'' published that the building cost $800,000. Mrs. Dodge also donated the train station. These structures became the core of the [[Madison Civic Commercial District]], which is listed on the State Register of Historic Places and the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. They made many other significant donations in his name. During the early part of their marriage they resided together at ''Hartley Farms''. Eventually, while in [[New Jersey]], they resided on separate, but abutting, country estates: ''Giralda Farms'' and ''Hartley Farms'' hers fronting the main route from [[Madison, New Jersey|Madison]] to [[Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown]] and extending to his that faced south and fronted on Spring Valley Road in [[New Vernon, New Jersey|New Vernon]]. A long private path extended for miles from one house to the other with gates at either side of Woodland Road, which defined the southern boundary of her property.

She died in 1973,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge, Founder of Kennel Club, Dead |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/14/archives/geraldine-rockefeller-dodge-founder-of-kennel-club-dead.html |quote=Mrs. Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge, last surviving child of the financier William Rockefeller and the widow of Marcellus Hartley Dodge, chairman of the Renmington Arms Company, died today at her home, Giralda Farms.

==Dogs==
Geraldine R. Dodge judged at major dog shows in every American state as well as the premier shows in Germany, Canada, Ireland, and England. She was the first woman invited to judge for the [[Westminster Kennel Club]], where she was invited to judge the ''Best in Show''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.morrisandessex.com/Cap%20Story%20Page%201.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the author of two books, ''The [[English Cocker Spaniel]] in America'', and ''The [[German Shepherd Dog]] in America'', the latter of which was a collaboration with her curator of art, Josephine Z. Rine.

She was recognized as a [[philanthropist]], a benefactor to communities, the arts, nonprofit and natural resource efforts, as an author, a judge of dogs, a breeder of dogs, the founder of the Morris and Essex Dog Club and its internationally recognized annual exhibition in May that was considered the most prestigious dog show held in the United States of America for decades, and the founder of a refuge for injured and lost animals.

At her death she left $85 million to establish the [[Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation]], which continues her work, including the [[Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grdodge.org/aboutus/historymission.htm |title=History and Mission |quote=Through the foresight and generosity of Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge (daughter of William and Almira Rockefeller), the foundation bearing her name was created in 1974.

Unfortunately, the historic residence of Geraldine R. Dodge was demolished by the insurance company that bought the estate following her death. The grand home was built in the style of [[Giralda]] in [[Seville]]. She had purchased it in 1923 from [[Charles W. Harkness]], the third largest holder of stock in Standard Oil while she and her husband were assembling properties that adjoined. Mr. Dodge's property extended to the edge of the [[Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge|Great Swamp]] that is a remnant from the [[Glacial Lake Passaic]]. His property has been preserved through a [[conservation easement]] and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

They were instrumental in helping those in the ''Jersey Jetport Site Association'', which began the campaign to save that vast swamp from development as an airport, by providing funds for the initial purchases of core properties in 1959. [http://www.tentowns.org/10t/suststew.htm] Acquisition of a significant area of land was required for it to qualify as a large enough gift to the federal government that could be set aside, forever, as a federal park.

Her husband was one of the first trustees of the ''North American Wildlife Foundation'' that completed the acquisition. [[Legislation]] championed by then congressman [[Stewart L. Udall]] was passed on November 3, 1960 protecting the important natural resource. In 1964 the park was dedicated by Udall, who had become [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] to president [[John F. Kennedy]] and continued under [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. [http://www.fws.gov/news/historic/1964/19640525b.pdf] The [[Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge]] was dedicated in 1968 and named the M. Hartley Dodge Wildlife Refuge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13439">'''Government Accountability Office investigations of the Department of Defense''' (DoD) are typically [[audit]]s in which the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO), the [[United States Congress]]' investigative arm, studies how the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] spends taxpayer dollars. Since the GAO is accountable only to the legislative branch, it is in a unique position to investigate the military; no other agency can audit Federal departments with the same degree of independence from the President. However, the GAO is still subject to influence from powerful members of Congress.  As of March 2016, the DoD was the only government agency to have failed every audit since all government agencies were required to pass such audits by the [[Chief Financial Officers Act]] of 1990.&lt;ref name="Smithberger"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smithberger|first1=Mandy|title=Will the Pentagon Ever Be Able to Be Audited?|url=http://www.pogo.org/straus/issues/defense-budget/2016/will-the-pentagon-ever-be.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/|website=Project on Government Oversight|accessdate=2016-12-01|date=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two examples of major GAO investigations in the 2000s were the audits of [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and Defense Department airline reimbursements.

==Major investigations==

===Operation Iraqi Freedom===
GAO investigations into Operation Iraqi Freedom revealed a number of accounting problems, ranging from the mundane to the severe. Pay irregularities were a chronic problem. In 2004 the GAO reported that 450 of the 481 [[Army National Guard]] soldiers from six [[Special Forces]] units had at least one pay problem associated with their mobilization impacting 94 percent of the soldiers. The report found that the DoD's inability to provide timely and accurate payments to these soldiers, many of whom risked their lives in [[Iraq]] or [[Afghanistan]], distracted them from their missions, imposed financial hardships on the soldiers and their families and may reduce retention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[Procurement]] irregularities included [[Halliburton]] charging the government $5 for hot meals they got from a Kuwaiti subcontractor, Timimmi, for $3 each.  In one camp in July 2003 they "billed the government for an average 42,000 meals a day but served only 14,000. In a seven-month period, alleged overcharging in that camp totalled $16m."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Teather|first1=David|title=Halliburton suspends bill for army meals: 'Overcharging' by Cheney's old firm becomes election issue|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/feb/18/iraq.usa|accessdate=2017-02-27|publisher=The Guardian|date=2004-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the investigation into Iraqi Freedom progressed, it began turning up worse and worse procurement problems. GAO [[auditor]]s caught the Department selling new chemical and biological protective garments on the Internet for $3 each. At the same time, the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] was buying identical garments elsewhere for more than $200 apiece. Other accounting snafus resulted in the [[United States Army|Army]] losing track of 56 [[airplane]]s, 32 [[tank]]s, and 36 [[FGM-148 Javelin|Javelin]] missile command launch-units.  In May 2003 SFGATE reported $1 trillion missing.&lt;ref name="SFGATE"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abate|first1=Tom|title=Military waste under fire / $1 trillion missing -- Bush plan targets Pentagon accounting|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Military-waste-under-fire-1-trillion-missing-2616120.php|accessdate=2017-02-27|publisher=SFGATE|date=2003-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GAO found that the waste encountered in Iraq is symptomatic of a wider inventory-control problem. More than 200 inventory-control systems at the Defense Department still are not integrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The GAO notes, "Poor communication between services within the Department of Defense and improper accounting results in the disposal of needed spare parts and the purchase of duplicative parts worth millions of dollars."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/defazio/102699DERelease.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406033457/http://www.house.gov/defazio/102699DERelease.htm |archivedate=2005-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airline reimbursements===
A more recent GAO investigation revealed $100 million in wasted airline fees. The [[Associated Press]] notes that the Defense Department spent an estimated $100 million for airline tickets that were not used over six years and failed to seek refunds even though the tickets were reimbursable. The Department also reimbursed employees for airline tickets that had been purchased by the Department. To demonstrate how easy it was to have the Pentagon pay for airline travel, the investigators posed as Defense employees, had the department generate a ticket and showed up at the ticket counter to pick up a boarding pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Defense Department drops $100M on unused airline tickets|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/news/2004-06-09-pentagon-flights_x.htm|accessdate=2017-02-27|publisher=USA Today|date=2004-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GAO also uncovered several incidences of airline-related fraud. One DoD traveler used a Department account number to pay for more than 70 airline tickets totaling more than $60,000. He then sold them at a discount to coworkers and family members for personal travel. Another employee admitted to "accidentally" claiming reimbursement for $10,000 worth of airline tickets that had been paid for by the Department.

==GAO influence over Defense Department reform==

===Defense Department responses to investigations===
There is evidence that GAO investigations are encouraging the Department to reform. The Halliburton contract was re-negotiated and assigned directly to Timimmi. And Dov Zakheim, chief financial officer for the Pentagon, said, "We are overhauling our financial management system precisely because people like &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Comptroller General of the United States|GAO Comptroller General]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[David M. Walker (U.S. Comptroller General)|David Walker]] are rightly critical of it".&lt;ref name="SFGATE"/&gt;

These audits appear to have been more effective at prompting reform than the Defense Department's own initiatives. In 1989, the Department began attempting to unify more than 2,000 overlapping systems used for billing, inventory, and personnel. But after spending $20 billion, the initiative was abandoned. Gregory Kutz, director of GAO's financial management division, noted the Pentagon's weak fiscal control over its subsidiaries – the Army, [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], and [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] – saying, "The [Pentagon's] inability to even complete an audit shows just how far they have to go."&lt;ref name="SFGATE"/&gt;

===Threats to GAO independence===
Scholars believe, however, that the GAO's authority could be undermined in the wake of a landmark case, Walker vs. Cheney. This Federal lawsuit pertained to a GAO investigation into the Bush Administration's Energy Task Force. [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Cheney]] refused to disclose which individuals and groups met with the Task Force, prompting Walker to sue for the information in Federal court. In December 2002, the court ruled for Cheney.

Congressional pressure persuaded Walker to abandon appeals. Having vowed to "go to the mat," he originally planned to pursue the case further. But according to the [[w:Center for Effective Government|Center for Effective Government]],

The [[Center for Effective Government]] reported that, "Sen. [[Ted Stevens]] (R-AK), chairman of the Appropriations Committee, met with GAO Comptroller General David Walker earlier in [2003], and sources have reported that sharp cuts in the GAO $440 million budget were threatened if the lawsuit was pursued further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GAO Authority Undermined|url=http://www.foreffectivegov.org/node/1244|website=foreffectivegov.org|publisher=Center for Effective Government|accessdate=2017-02-27|date=2003-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GAO was designed to be independent, and Walker cites several factors insulating his agency from political pressure. In a Roll Call op-ed, he remarks, "To begin with, our location in the legislative branch gives us some distance from the executive branches we audit and oversee. Moreover, the head of GAO serves a 15-year term, which gives the agency a continuity of leadership that is rare in the federal government. GAO's independence is further safeguarded by the fact that its workforce consists of career civil servants hired on the basis of their knowledge, skill, and ability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=David M.|title=GAO Answers the Question: What's in a Name?|url=http://www.gao.gov/about/rollcall07192004.pdf|website=Government Accountability Office|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=2017-02-27|date=2004-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the GAO, like all federal agencies, is subject to Congress' budgetary power. According to ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', "Walker did say . . . that several lawmakers have threatened in the past year to cut agency funding if it persisted with the controversial lawsuit. He also said the budget threat was among a number of factors that tipped his Feb. 7 decision to halt litigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Brand | first1 = Peter | last2 = Bolton | first2 = Alexander
| title = GOP Threats Stopped GAO  From Filing Suit Against Cheney | url=http://rense.com/general34/gao.htm|accessdate=2017-02-27|agency=The Hill|date=2003-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to tell whether curtailed GAO independence will threaten Defense Department reform. Some aspects of Defense Department accounting have resisted reform for decades. Danielle Brian, director of the nonprofit [[Project on Government Oversight]], says, "Waste has become ingrained in the Defense budget because opposition to defense spending is portrayed as unpatriotic, and legislators are often more concerned about winning Pentagon [[pork barrel|pork]] than controlling defense waste."&lt;ref name="SFGATE"/&gt;

But even Representatives who generally support Defense spending seem to be getting fed up with the problem. Representative [[Thomas M. Davis]], R-Virginia, asked the Pentagon to present 11 documents relating to contracts in Iraq, among them papers that would prove whether Halliburton benefited from its association with Cheney. And Rep. [[Jimmy Duncan (U.S. politician)|John Duncan]], R-Tenn., of the House Committee on Government Reform recently said, "I've always considered myself to be a pro-military type person, but that doesn't mean I just want to sit back and watch the Pentagon waste billions and billions of dollars."&lt;ref name="SFGATE"/&gt;

Supporters of the GAO investigations like to point out the disparity between the GAO budget and military expenses. The GAO's [[fiscal year|Fiscal Year]] 2016 annual budget was $555 million, with "Measurable financial benefits from GAO work:	$63.4 billion--a return of about $112 on every dollar invested in GAO."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2016 | title=GAO at a Glance|url=http://www.gao.gov/about/gglance.html|website=Government Accountability Office|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, GAO reports show that the Defense Department's 2,200 overlapping financial systems cost $18 billion a year to operate.&lt;ref name="SFGATE"/&gt;

In March 2016, the [[Project on Government Oversight]] reported that, "The Department of Defense remains the only federal agency that can't get a clean audit".

'''Nils Gustaf Dalén''' ({{IPA-sv|²ɡɵsːtav daˈleːn|-|Sv-Gustaf_Dahlén.ogg}}; 30 November 1869 – 9 December 1937) was a Swedish [[Nobel Laureate]] and industrialist, the founder of the [[AGA AB|AGA]] company and inventor of the [[AGA cooker]] and the [[Dalén light]]. In 1912 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his "invention of [[Sun valve|automatic regulators]] for use in conjunction with gas accumulators for illuminating [[lighthouse]]s and [[buoy]]s".

==Early years==
[[File:Gustaf Dalén 1895.png|thumb|left|Gustaf Dalén as a young engineer with his bicycle in the photo studio 1895.]]
Dalén was born in Stenstorp, a small village in [[Falköping Municipality]], [[Västra Götaland County]]. He managed the family farm, which he expanded to include a market garden, a seed merchants and a dairy. In 1892 he invented a milk-fat tester to check milk quality of the milk delivered and went to [[Stockholm]] to show his new invention for [[Gustaf de Laval]]. de Laval was impressed by the self-taught Dalén and the invention and encouraged him to get a basic technical education. He was admitted to the [[Chalmers University of Technology]] where he earned his [[Master's degree]] and a [[Doctorate]] on leaving in 1896. Dalén was much the same type of inventor as Gustaf de Laval, not afraid of testing "impossible" ideas, but Dalén was much more careful with the company economy. The products should have a solid market place before he introduced a new product.

==Career with AGA==
In 1906 Dalén became chief engineer at the Gas Accumulator Company (manufacturer and distributor of acetylene) and in 1909 when AGA was founded, he was appointed the managing director for the company. During his life, AGA was one of the most innovative companies in Sweden and produced a large variety of products that grew every year. Finally in the early 1970s AGA was forced to reduce the number of markets it was involved in and concentrate on the production of gases for industrial use.

In 1909 he ascended to the position of Managing Director of the renamed company Svenska Aktiebolaget Gasaccumulator (AGA). AGA developed lighthouses using Dalén's products. In 1910 the company bought a large real estate in [[Lidingö Municipality|Lidingö]] and built a production plant that was completed around 1912, when they moved out from the facilities in Stockholm.

===Dalen light===
[[File:Stockholm Sweden Blockhusudden-lighthouse-01.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The AGA lighthouse "Blockhusudden" close to Stockholm, initially set up in 1912. When the lighthouse was electrified in 1980 it was determined that the sun valve had been working continuously since 1912 without the need for an overhaul.]]

Initially Dalén worked with [[acetylene]] ([[IUPAC]]: [[ethyne]]), a flammable and sometimes  explosive [[hydrocarbon]] gas. Dalén invented [[Agamassan]] (Aga), a [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] used to absorb the gas allowing safe storage and hence commercial exploitation.

Acetylene produced an ultra-bright white light which superseded the less bright [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] as the fuel of choice for lighthouse illumination.

Dalén exploited the new fuel, developing the [[Dalén light]] which incorporated another invention, the [[sun valve]]. This device allowed the light to operate only at night, conserving fuel, and extending their service life to over a year.

The 'Dalen Flasher' was a device that, except for a small pilot light, only consumed gas during the flash stage. This reduced gas consumption by more than 90%. The AGA lighthouse equipment worked without any type of electric supply and was thus extremely reliable.

To a rugged coastal area like [[Scandinavia]], his mass-produced, robust, minimal maintenance buoys were a significant boon to safety and livelihood. AGA Lighthouses covered the entire [[Panama Canal]].

===AGA cooker===
In 1922 he patented his invention of the [[AGA cooker]]. Most of the testing for the cooker was made in his private kitchen in his Villa Ekbacken that was built when AGA moved to Lidingö in 1912 but that he never actually had a chance to see with his own eyes. His family helped him with the development work, checking temperatures, airflow etc., as the development work proceeded.

==Personal life==
His parents were Anders and Lovisa Dalén. He married Elma Persson in 1901. They had four children, two daughters and two sons;
*Maja, married Silfverstolpe (1904–1995)
*Gunnar (1905–1970)
*Anders (1907–1994)
*Inga-Lisa, married Keen (1910–2006)

===The accident in 1912===
Early in 1912, Dalén was [[Blindness|blind]]ed in an acetylene explosion during a test of maximum pressure for the accumulators. Later the same year he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for physics]]. Too ill to attend the presentation, Dalén had his brother, ophthalmologist Professor Albin Dalén of the [[Caroline Institute]], stand in his place.

The presentation speech praised the quality of sacrificing personal safety in scientific experimentation, a compliment that compared Dalén with [[Alfred Nobel|Nobel]] himself. Despite his blindness, Dalén controlled AGA until his death in 1937. He received over 100 patents during his lifetime.

==Honours and awards==
* Nobel Prize for Physics 1912
* Member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]
* Member of the [[Academy of Science and Engineering]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6189">{{nihongo|'''Hideshi Hamaguchi''' |濱口 秀司|Hamaguchi Hideshi}} is a Japanese [[concept]] creator and [[strategist]] in the business field. Hamaguchi is also called a business designer or an innovation designer.

He is considered a leading mind in creative concept development, strategy-building and decision management in the United States and Japan.
 
A self-proclaimed "creative visual thinker" and "diagram-lover", Hamaguchi uses visual models to bring what he calls "[[simplexity]]" and "structured chaos" to the process of brainstorming, helping businesses generate creative ideas and strategies in various industries &amp; businesses.

==Education==
Hamaguchi holds a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from [[Kyoto University]], [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]

==Professional==
Hamaguchi is acknowledged for the [[BET theory]] of TiO2 ([[titanium dioxide]],) an energy production photocatalyst called the Honda-Fujishima effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TFN-3YCN376-8H&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=9962f1e45ebe45b9817d39023cf88d57 Titanium(IV) oxide photocatalyst of ultra-high activity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamaguchi started his business career with [[Panasonic Corporation]] (former [[Matsushita Electric Works]], Ltd.) in Japan. In 1993, he became one of their first corporate [[decision analysts]], supporting board members and executives with strategic decision making. In 1994, he created the concept of the [[Intranet]] and developed Japan's first corporate [[Intranet]] with [[Toru Takasuka]].

From 1998 to 2001, he served as a strategist at Ziba Design, Inc. in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] and led award winning projects, including IDEA ([[International Design Excellence Awards]]) gold awarded projects.

While at Ziba, he created the concept of the world's first [[USB flash drive]]. IBM first marketed the drives in North America in 2000, with its product the "DiskOnKey" (manufactured by the Israeli company [[M-Systems]]). In 2002, he helped the start-up of MDRM, an Israeli company developing technology for [[digital rights management]] through [[flash memory]] cards. ([[SanDisk]] acquired MDRM in December 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investor.sandisk.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=86495&amp;p=irol-newsArticle_Print&amp;ID=658477&amp;highlight= SanDisk Acquires MDRM]&lt;/ref&gt;)

In 2001, Hamaguchi returned to [[Panasonic Electric Works]], Ltd. During his time there he was Director of the New Business Planning Group in Japan and Executive Vice President of Panasonic Electric Works Laboratory of America, Inc. in the U.S.A.

In 2006 he founded [[LUNARR]] Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portlandonfire.com/hideshihamaguchi/ Hideshi Hamaguchi | Portland On Fire&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; with his business partner [[Toru Takasuka]] in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Oregon, U.S.A.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/2007/10/01/smallb1.html Tracking progress - Portland Business Journal:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He was COO of [[LUNARR]], Inc.

In 2009 he returned to Ziba Design as Director of Strategy.

In 2012 he became a juror of the [[Red Dot]] Design Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.red-dot.org/jury2012.html?cHash=878d60c4069b7a8e85cb667839e26bb7&amp;detail=4671]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.red-dot.org/4806.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamaguchi has developed his own theory and methodology (Model Based Approach) for creative concept and strategy building through his experiences in various industries, businesses and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.picmet.org/newsletter/tmn.asp?news_ID=314&amp;NL_code=18 Portland International Engineering and Technology Management Center&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamaguchi is Yanko Design's Design Strategist.

'''INFOTAB''' (International Tobacco Information Center) was based in Brussels as the cigarette industry's international lobby organisation.  It developed through four main stages.

Initially the program to set up a joint lobby by the competing cigarette manufacturers was known by the code-name [[Operation Berkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/foz1aa00/pdf|title=Industry Documents Library|website=legacy.library.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/vix66b00/pdf|title=Industry Documents Library|website=legacy.library.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was formally set up in mid 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/cyg85a00/pdf|title=Industry Documents Library|website=legacy.library.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first actual organisation with staff was established by [[Mary Covington]] on loan from Philip Morris.  It functioned under the name ICOSI (International Committee on Smoking Issues),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/ppdl0012|title=Industry Documents Library|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its main operating subcommitte was SAWP (Social Acceptability Working Party) which tried to find ways to make smoking more acceptable to non-smokers. An Australian ex-member of parliament, [[Julian Doyle]] was the main director at this stage.

ICOSI was transformed into INFOTAB in 1984 when they decided to fund and staff the organisation to attack the growing political moves against the tobacco industry with the European Community (based in Brussels), and the World Health Organisation (WHO) and International Labor Organisation (ILO) in Geneva. The WHO in particular had a highly active anti-smoking program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/tmnk0196|title=Industry Documents Library|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main director of INFOTAB was the Australian newspaper executive Bryan C Simpson.

In the November 1998, the [[Master Settlement Agreement]] was signed between the Clinton Administration, the US States Attorneys General. and the tobacco industry. This agreement supposedly clamped down  on the underhand activities of the tobacco industry and so INFOTAB was supposed to disappear.  It didn't.

Many of the functions were simply passed over to the Tobacco Documentation Center which was by then a highly diffuse organisation with database operations in various countries, but based initially on the Brussels INFOTAB database division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/stfd0204|title=Industry Documents Library|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/pfe51a99/pdf|title=Industry Documents Library|website=legacy.library.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4846">An '''information silo''', or a group of such silos, is an insular [[management system]] in which one [[information system]] or subsystem is incapable of reciprocal operation with others that are, or should be, related. Thus [[information]] is not adequately shared but rather remains sequestered within each system or subsystem, figuratively trapped within a container like grain is trapped within a [[silo]]: there may be a lot of it, and it may be stacked quite high and freely available within those limits, but it has no effect outside those limits. Such data silos are proving to be an obstacle for businesses wishing to use [[data mining]] to make productive use of their data. 

[[File:Information silo.png|thumb|Typical information silos in a hierarchic structured organization.]]
Information silos occur whenever a [[data system]] is incompatible or not integrated with other data systems.  This incompatibility may occur in the technical architecture, in the [[application architecture]], or in the [[data architecture]] of any data system.  However, since it has been shown that established [[data modeling]] methods are the root cause of the data integration problem &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://maxxphase.com/data-compatibility/top-benefits/data-silo-elimination/|title = Incompatible Data Silos|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date = 2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, most data systems are at least incompatible in the data architecture layer.

==Silo mentality==
In management the term '''silo mentality''' often refers to information silos in organizations. Silo mentality is caused by divergent goals of different organizational units. It can also be described as a variant of the [[Principal–agent problem|principal-agent problem]]. Silo mentality preferably occurs in larger organizations and can lead to a decreased performance and has a negative impact on the corporate culture. Silo mentality can be countered by the introduction of shared goals, the increase of internal networking activities and the flattening of hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.rotize.com/silo-mentality/|title = Silo mentality in companies|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date = 2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Predictors for the occurrence of silos are 
* Number of employees 
* Number of organizational units within the whole organization 
* Degree of specialization 
* Number of different incentive mechanisms  

This should not be confused with a data silo in computing, like [[application virtualization]], [[operating-system-level virtualization]], or a [[separation kernel]].

== Etymology ==
The term '''functional silo syndrome''' was coined in 1988 by Phil S. Ensor (1931–2018) who worked in organizational development and employee relations for [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]], [[Eaton Corporation]], and as a consultant. "Silo" and "stovepipe" (as in "[[stovepipe (organisation)|stovepipe organization]]" and "[[stovepipe system]]") are now used interchangeably and applied broadly. Phil Ensor's use of the term "silo" reflects his rural Illinois origins and the many grain silos he would pass on return visits as he contemplated the challenges of the modern organizations with which he worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Functional Silo Syndrome|url=http://www.ame.org/sites/default/files/documents/88q1a3.pdf|first=Phil|last=Ensor|work=AME Target|page=16|date=Spring 1988|accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Organizational Renewal – Tearing Down the Functional Silos|url=http://www.ame.org/sites/default/files/target_articles/88q2a1.pdf|author=AME Study Group on Functional Organization|work=AME Target|page=4-16|date=Summer 1988|accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Breaking Down the Functional Silos: Motorola Paging Division "Bandit" Plant|url=http://www.ame.org/sites/default/files/documents/89Q4A5.pdf|first=James|last=Pullin|work=AME Target|date=Winter 1989|accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Of Silos and Stovepipes|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002964.html|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|work=Language Log|date=2006-03-27|accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute for Consumer Antitrust Studies''' is a non-partisan, independent academic center designed to explore the impact of [[antitrust]] enforcement on the individual consumer and public, and to shape policy issues.  It is located at [[Loyola University Chicago School of Law]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]].

The School of Law created the institute in 1994 at the direction of then-dean Nina S. Appel, Professor Jane H. Locke, and a variety of other supporters.  Funding for the institute was provided via a [[cy pres]] award from the late [[Hubert Louis Will|United States District Judge Hubert Will]] with funds remaining from a large antitrust settlement.&lt;ref&gt;''Superior Beverage Co. v. Owens-Illinois'', 827 F. Supp. 477, 482-83 (N.D. Ill. 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, the institute celebrated its 15th anniversary.

Beginning in 2000, Professor Spencer Waller became director of the institute.  Professor Waller has authored numerous scholarly articles and several books on the subject of antitrust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=145112 |title=SSRN Author Page for Waller, Spencer Weber |publisher=[[SSRN]] |date= |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to joining the institute, Professor Waller served as associate dean at Brooklyn Law School.  In addition to teaching, Professor Waller practiced with the [[United States Department of Justice]] Antitrust and Criminal Divisions and with the Chicago law firm of Freeborn &amp; Peters.

== Fellowship ==

===Student Fellowship Program===

The institute promotes the study and discussion of consumer and competition law issues through its [http://www.luc.edu/law/centers/antitrust/fellowship.html Student Fellowship Program], which began in January 2001. Fellows are law students chosen from among applicants who meet certain minimum requirements, including academic achievement (fellows must be in the top one-third of their class), an interest in pursuing a career in antitrust or consumer protection, and complete requisite coursework.[3] The institute provides fellows with a stipend.

Fellows attend all institute events as well as special programs designed to inform them of current topics of interest in competition law, practice and policy. These special programs introduce the fellows to the key policymakers in the public and private sectors. Each year, the institute sends fellows to the ABA Section of Antitrust Spring Meeting. In addition, fellows engage in externships with organizations such as the [[Federal Trade Commission]], the [[Illinois Attorney General]], public interest groups and private law firms.

The fellows write papers on timely antitrust and consumer protection issues, recent Supreme Court decisions and new developments in these fields. To see a few of the more recent papers written by fellows, scholars and institute faculty members, please click here,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luc.edu/law/centers/antitrust/publications/news_views/index.html|title=School of Law - Institute for Consumer Antitrust Studies: Loyola University Chicago |publisher=Luc.edu |date=2014-04-21 |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; or see below under News &amp; Views.

Alumni of the Student Fellowship Program work at a wide variety of law firms, government agencies and corporate counsel offices. The institute has alumni who followed career paths at the [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division|U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division]], the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] and Brooklyn Legal Services Foreclosure Defense.

===Senior research fellow===

The institute also sponsors a [http://www.luc.edu/law/centers/antitrust/research_fellowship.html senior research fellow].

==Online Global Competition Masters Program==
Loyola's Institute for Consumer Antitrust Studies now offers online Master of Jurisprudence and Master of Laws degree programs in Global Competition Law,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/law/centers/antitrust/pdfs/Global%20Competition%20Law%20Highlights%202015-16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; featuring a comprehensive curriculum, exceptional faculty and a flexible structure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.luc.edu/law/centers/antitrust/degreesandcertificates/&lt;/ref&gt;  For more information on each specific program, see below.

Over 130 jurisdictions around the world enforce some form of competition law that prohibits cartels and other agreements to harm competition and consumers.  Competition law also prevents monopolization or abuse of a dominant position, and anticompetitive mergers and acquisitions.  The Institute for Consumer Antitrust Studies at Loyola University of Chicago has over 20 years of experience teaching, researching, publishing and advocating for a more competitive and consumer-friendly economy.  Loyola's new online LLM and MJ programs offer professionals around the globe who are working in government, the private sector, or academia the opportunity to strengthen their skills and knowledge of competition law through flexible part-time online programs.

To see teaching faculty biographies, click here.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.luc.edu/law/centers/antitrust/degreesandcertificates/teachingfacultybiographies/&lt;/ref&gt;

	The curriculum requires the completion on four mandatory courses in year one, which include: Principles of Competition Law, Intellectual Property Law Survey, Law and Economics, and International and Comparative Competition Law. Students then must choose four electives from a list of selected courses to complete in year two.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4101">'''Ernst Karl''' (sometimes also '''Carl''') '''Erdmann Heine''' (January 10, 1819 – August 25, 1888) was a [[lawyer]] in Leipzig and a major [[entrepreneur]] and industrial pioneer who shaped the face of the western suburbs of Leipzig.

== Life ==
[[Image:Karl-Heine Denkmal in Leipzig.jpg|thumb|Karl Heine's monument in Leipzig]]

Karl Heine was born in [[Leipzig]], to the owner of Neuscherbitz Estate, Johann Carl Friedrich Heine, and his wife Christiana Dorothea, née Reichel (1781–1857). He attended the ''[[Thomasschule zu Leipzig]]'', a public boarding school in Leipzig. Later he studied law at the [[University of Leipzig]] - he was member of the [[Corps Saxonia Leipzig]] fraternity. He received a [[doctorate]] on the economic use of waterways and shores according to Saxon state law. Later, he established himself as a barrister in Leipzig .

After the death of his grandfather E.T. Reichel (1748–1832), Karl Heine bought the shares of Reichel's Garden from another heir, took these pieces of land and from the medial of the 19th century on, he gradually built what is today the inner western suburb of Leipzig.

In 1854, Heine also expanded his estate in the ''Gemeinde Plagwitz'' district of Leipzig; in 1856, he began the construction of the first section of a navigable canal connecting the rivers [[Weisse Elster]] and [[Saale]], which today bears his name (''Karl-Heine-Kanal''). The excavation of the canal reclaimed which was later to become the western suburb of Leipzig. To institute his plans for construction and industrialization, Heine established an "economy" in Plagwitz.

When the western suburb was connected to ''Gemeinde Plagwitz'', Heine constructed the ''Plagwitzer Straße'' (today named ''Käthe-Kollwitz-Straße''), a street to the south of the old highway from Leipzig to [[Lindenau (Leipzig)|Lindenau]], which ran parallel to the new street. Against the opposition of the Leipzig council, he also built the Plagwitz bridge, which connected to the ''Leipziger Straße'' in Plagwitz (today: ''Karl-Heine-Straße'').

Karl Heine was a member of the Saxon Diet from 1870 to his death. He was also a representative in the Leipzig city council.

In 1874, he moved into his newly built villa in Neuschleußig ([[Karl-Heine-Villa]], ''Könneritzstraße 1''), where he resided until his death.

In 1876, a construction scheme was approved which encompassed merging Karl Heine's meadows and fields in the northern part of [[Schleußig]] (''Neuschleußig'') with Bernhard Hüffer's (1824–1904) estate and extensive undeveloped forest land. These areas would be designated as new residential areas. 

On May 24, 1888, Heine founded the ''Westend-Baugesellschaft'', a construction company, to continue his work in developing the Leipzig economy after his death.

Since 1854, Karl Heine had also been a member of the Leipzig [[masonic lodge]] ''Apollo''. He died on August 25, 1888, aged 69, in Leipzig.

==Honours==
In 1897, the city of Leipzig honoured Karl Heine with a monument. The monument was melted down in the Second World War but was renewed in 2001. Many streets and one plaza are named after him. (''Erdmannstraße'', 1891; ''Karl-Heine-Straße'', 1904; ''Karl-Heine-Platz'', et al.)

In 2003, a Leipzig vocational school adopted the name of ''Karl-Heine-Schule''.

A leading member of the [[Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt|Muslim Brotherhood]], as the Deputy Supreme Guide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/75815/Egypt/Politics-/Muslim-Brotherhoods-secondman-ElShater-arrested-Se.aspx|title=Muslim Brotherhood's second-man El-Shater arrested: Security official|last=Gamaledine|first=El-Sayed|date=6 July 2013|work=Ahram Online|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; el-Shater was the initial candidate of the movement's [[Freedom and Justice Party (Egypt)|Freedom and Justice Party]] during the [[Egyptian presidential election, 2012|2012 Egyptian presidential election]] before being disqualified by the election commission. Previously, he was the deputy chairman of the Brotherhood.

==Life and career==
Born in [[Dakahlia Governorate|Dakahlia]], el-Shater joined the youth wing of the ruling [[Arab Socialist Union (Egypt)|Arab Socialist Union]] party at age 16, during the presidency of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. He studied engineering at the [[Alexandria University]]. There he participated in the February 1968 student protests against the government. After serving in the military for two years, el-Shater studied for a master's degree and worked as a lecturer at the [[Mansoura University]]. After the then president [[Anwar Sadat]]'s assassination in 1981, el-Shater was exiled as an Islamist dissident, and left for [[England]]. After returning in the mid-1980s, he became an active member of the Muslim Brotherhood. In 1995, he became head of the Brotherhood's [[Greater Cairo]] branch.&lt;ref name="Howeidy"&gt;{{Citation|first=Amira|last=Howeidy|title=Meet the Brotherhood’s enforcer: Khairat El-Shater |newspaper=Ahram Online|date=29 March 2012|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/37993/Egypt/Politics-/Meet-the-Brotherhood%E2%80%99s-enforcer-Khairat-ElShater.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

El-Shater led a successful furniture and textile business with branches in Cairo's luxurious shopping malls, which earned him a fortune of several millions.&lt;ref name="Howeidy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abulmagd"&gt;{{Citation|first=Zeinab|last=Abul-Magd |title=The Brotherhood's businessmen|newspaper=Egypt Independent|date=13 February 2012 |url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/node/654581|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Asher"&gt;{{Citation|first=Avi |last=Asher-Schapiro|title=The GOP Brotherhood of Egypt|newspaper=Salon|date=26 January 2012 |url=http://www.salon.com/2012/01/26/the_gop_brotherhood_of_egypt/|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered a main financier&lt;ref name="Abulmagd"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Rached Ghannouchi, Khairat El Shater|work=The FP Top 100 Global Thinkers|publisher=Foreign Policy|date=December 2011 |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/11/28/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers?page=0,3#thinker4|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and chief strategist of the Brotherhood.&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;{{Citation|title=Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood fields deputy leader as presidential candidate|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=31 March 2012 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/egypts-muslim-brotherhood-fields-deputy-leader-as-presidential-candidate/2012/03/31/gIQATAHanS_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Mubarak regime, he was imprisoned from 2007 until his release by the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]] in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Egypt: IHRC welcomes release of Khairat Al-Shater|newspaper=Bikya Masr|date=2 March 2011|url=http://bikyamasr.com/29231/egypt-ihrc-welcomes-release-of-khairat-al-shater/|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the victory of the [[Freedom and Justice Party (Egypt)|Freedom and Justice Party]] (parliamentary wing of the Muslim Brotherhood) in the [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2011–12|2011/12 parliamentary election]], el-Shater was tipped as a likely candidate for [[Prime Minister of Egypt|Prime Minister]] of a coalition government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Muslim Brotherhood picks members of proposed coalition govt|newspaper=Egypt Independent|date=13 February 2012|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/node/654376|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Zvi|last=Bar'el|title=The Muslim Brotherhood prepares for Egypt's new government|newspaper=Haaretz|date=14 February 2012|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/the-muslim-brotherhood-prepares-for-egypt-s-new-government-1.412881|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Middle East researcher Avi Asher-Schapiro considers el-Shater to be a strong advocate of privatization and free market.&lt;ref name="Abulmagd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Asher"/&gt;

Even though he is the nominal number two in the Brotherhood's hierarchy, some consider him its actual leader. In the eyes of many analysts and activists, he is one of the main reasons behind the anti-revolutionary style of politics the MB followed since the fall of Mubarak. He is also claimed to be responsible for the expulsion of the dissident Brotherhood member [[Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh]] and his supporters.&lt;ref name="Howeidy"/&gt;

==Presidential candidacy==
On 31 March 2012 the Freedom and Justice Party named him their candidate for the [[Egyptian presidential election, 2012|presidential election in May]].&lt;ref name="WP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=David D.|last=Kirkpatrick|title=More Confident Brotherhood Names Candidate in Egypt|newspaper=The New York Times|date=31 March 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/world/middleeast/brotherhood-chooses-a-candidate-in-egypt.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; El-Shater formally resigned from the Brotherhood in order to run for president and to avoid violating the Brotherhood's pledge not to field a candidate. The announcement of Shater's presidential candidacy was a historical first for the 83-year-old group, which originally pledged that none of their members would run for president to calm secular and western governments' fears of a complete Islamist takeover by the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/node/744031|title=Update: Muslim Brotherhood endorses Khairat al-Shater as presidential candidate|publisher=Egypt Independent|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in 2012, Khairat El-Shater had denied any intentions for entering the presidential race on [[Al Jazeera]], after Ahmed Mansour, host of the show ''Without Limits'' (''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|bilā ḥudūd}}'' {{lang|ar|بلا حدود}}), had subtly questioned the sequence of events which later took place on 31 March 2012. The Egyptian [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]] barred El-Shater from the presidential race on 14 April 2012, stating that he was only released from prison in March 2011, in violation of election rules stating that a candidate has to be released from prison for 6 years before he can become a candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhvouWONOiY|title=لقاء خيرت الشاطر في برنامج بلا حدود|publisher=YouTube|date=8 February 2012|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
El-Shater was arrested on 5 July 2013, following the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|military coup d'état]] which unseated the Brotherhood-led government and President [[Mohamed Morsi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Muslim Brotherhood's second-man El-Shater arrested: Security official|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/75815/Egypt/Politics-/Muslim-Brotherhoods-secondman-ElShater-arrested-Se.aspx|publisher=Ahram Online|accessdate=5 July 2013|date=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 July 2013 Egypt's military-installed prosecutor general [[Hisham Barakat]] ordered his assets to be frozen.&lt;ref name="egypindep"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Asset freeze for Islamist leaders goes into action|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/asset-freeze-islamist-leaders-goes-action|work=Egypt Independent|date=15 July 2013|accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 October 2013, a three-judge panel at Cairo Criminal Court stepped down from the proceedings, citing "uneasiness" over the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/29/judges-in-egyptianbrotherhoodtrialquit.html|title=Judges in Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood trial quit|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 December 2013, a second panel of judges withdrew from the trial.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/88855/Egypt/Politics-/Second-judging-panel-withdraws-from-Brotherhood-tr.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 February 2015, he was sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecairopost.com/news/139398/news/breaking-mohamed-badie-khairat-el-shater-sentenced-to-life|title=Update: Mohamed Badie, Khairat el-Shater sentenced to life|date=2015-02-28|work=Cairo Post|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 May 2015, another court issued a preliminary death sentence against him in a separate case.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1615">{{Nihongo|'''Kunio Nakamura'''|中村 邦夫|Nakamura Kunio|born July 5, 1939}} is a Japanese businessman. He served as the president of [[Panasonic]] from 2000 to 2005 and assumed the position of chairman on June 28, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=320491&amp;privcapId=320433 Nakamura Kunio], Bloomberg Business&lt;/ref&gt; Even though he is widely regarded as having reformed the company, he created a crisis in the mid-2000s for focusing on [[plasma display]] panels (PDPs) instead of medium liquid crystal TVs (LCDs).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hankyung.com/news/app/newsview.php?aid=2012020538681 침몰하는 파나소닉…리틀 경영의 神 독재 'PDP 재앙'을 부르다], Korea Economy (newspaper)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2010 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in [[Las Vegas]], Panasonic introduced their 152" 2160p 3D plasma. In 2010 Panasonic shipped 19.1 million [[plasma TV panel]]s.

In 2010, shipments of plasma TVs reached 18.2 million units worldwide. Since then shipments have declined substantially; the decline has been attributed to competition from liquid crystal (LCD) televisions, whose prices have fallen more rapidly than those of the plasma TVs. In late 2013, Panasonic announced that they would stop producing plasma TVs in March 2014 onwards. In 2014, LG and Samsung discontinued plasma TV production as well, effectively killing the technology, probably because of falling demand.

'''Leonardo Salvador Sarao, Sr.''' (April 13, 1921 &amp;ndash; July 31, 2001) was the founder and owner of the [[Sarao Motors]], a company known for designing, manufacturing and selling the [[jeepney]], the most popular mode of transportation in the [[Philippines]].  He is not the first person to alter the surplus [[Willys MB Jeep|jeeps]] left behind by the [[U.S. Army]] from [[World War II]],&lt;ref name=PUV&gt;Blueberry (2007-09-23).[http://phuvs.blogspot.com/2007/09/sarao-jeepney.html "Sarao Jeepney"]. Public Utility Vehicles. Retrieved on 2013-04-25.&lt;/ref&gt; but he saw them as a business opportunity for [[mass transportation]]. He redesigned the surplus jeeps to increase its functionality by extending the body to accommodate at least twice the number of passengers and by putting some railings at the back and top for extra passengers to cling to, and for cargoes.&lt;ref name=remarkable&gt;[http://www.hawaii.edu/cps/jeepney.html "Remarkable Philippine Jeepneys"]. Center for Philippine Studies, [[University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa]]. Retrieved on 2013-04-26.&lt;/ref&gt;  He revolutionized a burgeoning industry and changed the life of generations of Filipinos.&lt;ref name=tofil&gt;Santos, Michelle D. [http://www.tofil.ph/greatleaders.php?id=67 "Great Leaders in Our Midst"]. The Outstanding Filipino (TOFIL) Award. Retrieved on 2013-04-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonardo Sarao was awarded [[The Outstanding Filipino Award]] (TOFIL) in 1997 for [[Entrepreneurship]].  He started Sarao Motors from a borrowed [[Philippine peso|PHP]]700.  Though he only attained [[elementary education|Grade 6]] level of education because of [[poverty]], he was able to make the company grow into a multimillion [[Banknotes of the Philippine peso|peso]] [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]].

He was a relative of [[Leonides Sarao Virata]], a respected and distinguished Filipino economist served as Secretary of Trade and Industry and Chairman of the [[Development Bank of the Philippines]] (DBP) during Marcos regime.

== Digital cameras ==

Kodak has produced a wide variety of [[digital camera]]s for both professional and consumer use.

=== Kodak professional digital cameras ===

Kodak was a leader in professional-grade digital photography products, although in recent years it has retreated from this market. Since Kodak did not have its own line of lenses, Kodak [[digital SLR]]s have all taken either [[Canon EOS]] or [[Nikon F-mount]] lenses; most have either been based on [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] or [[Nikon Corporation|Nikon]] 135 film [[single lens reflex|SLRs]]. PixPro has seen its kind of revival, but manufactured by JK Imaging instead of Kodak.

==== Kodak EasyShare consumer digital cameras ====
[[Kodak EasyShare|EasyShare]] was Kodak's line of consumer digital cameras compatible with "docks" also manufactured by Kodak, simplifying the process of interfacing with computers for editing and printing.

===== Kodak EasyShare DX series =====
The DX series cameras were the first EasyShare models released, beginning with the DX3215. It was originally a very basic point and shoot camera series, compatible with the original EasyShare Camera Dock. The CX series eventually replaced the lower-end DX models, and the newer DX-Series models had more advanced features and higher megapixel resolutions and zoom. The DX series is now discontinued. The higher-end of the DX-Series (higher zoom, megapixel) eventually became the Z-Series. Select DX models were the last Kodak consumer digital cameras to use CompactFlash external memory cards.

[[File:Cigarette rolling papers (8).JPG|thumb|250px|Several brands of rolling papers]]

'''[[Rolling paper]]s''' (aka Blanks) are small sheets, rolls, or leaves of [[paper]] which are sold for [[Roll-your-own|rolling]] [[cigarette]]s either by hand or with a [[rolling machine]]. When rolling a cigarette, one fills the rolling paper with [[tobacco]], [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[cloves]], [[damiana]], [[hashish|hash]] or other [[herb]]s. The paper for holding the tobacco blend may vary in porosity to allow ventilation of the burning ember or contain materials that control the burning rate of the cigarette and stability of the produced ash.
Civil War re-enactors often use cigarette rolling papers to make combustible cartridges for cap &amp; ball rifles and revolvers.

|Abadie
|[[France]]
|([[France]] 1840) pink pack. Originating from [[Bolloré]] (now called [[Republic Tobacco|Republic]]) in [[France]], there were also [[Spain|Spanish]]-made Abadie papers which are produced by Miguel Y Costas, as well as an Abadie factory in [[Vienna]]. The Abadie brand website has been removed due to French anti-tobacco legislation which prohibits the marketing of cigarettes or cigarette papers. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} However, Republic Tobacco still produces and markets Abadie Papers. On January 4, 2006, Republic—through their subsidiary—renewed the trademark and signed an allegation that they are continuing to use it; ([http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=71201906 trademark statement]). It cannot be disputed that this brand is still marketed and sold in the US, without claiming that Republic filed a false statement in 2006 with the US Patent and Trademark office (which they did not). Abadie is still very much for sale in America and can be found at hundreds of specialty stores across the country (and in Canada as well).  {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The Austrian/German Abadie factory also published a number of stamp albums, the main ones two large albums with 3800 stamps with [[coats of arms]] and [[flags]], published in the 1930s.  {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

|[[Tally-Ho]]
|[[Australia]]
|An [[Australia]]n brand of rolling paper distributed by [[Imperial Tobacco]] Australia. The [[packaging]] of the product aims to appeal to Australian [[patriotism]], with many assertions such as 'Australia's Finest' and 'Australia's No.1 paper for over 60 years'. It also offers pieces of [[trivia]] on the packaging which again appeal to [[Australian patriotism]], such as 'Australia's [[dingo fence]] is twice the length of the [[Great Wall of China]]' and 'Australia has more beaches than any other country – about 7,000'. The product is actually produced in [[Belgium]].  Previous to 2005 this was stated only on the inside of the packaging where it was normally not visible.  At some point in 2005, packaging changed to include the notice 'Made in Belgium' on the outside back cover. Also made in [[Belgium]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

'''María Elena Holly''' (née '''Santiago'''; born December 20, 1932)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buddyhollyandthecrickets.com/birthdays.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140130202140/http://buddyhollyandthecrickets.com/birthdays.html |archivedate=2014-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the widow of [[rock and roll]] pioneer [[Buddy Holly]]. She later remarried.  She owns the rights to his name, image, trademarks, and other intellectual property.  In 2010, Santiago-Holly co-founded, with Peter Bradley, "The Buddy Holly Educational Foundation" also known as TBHEF.

==Early years==
Santiago-Holly (birth name: '''María Elena Santiago''') was born in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. María Elena's mother died when she was 12 years old. In 1953, her father sent her to live with her aunt (Provi Garcia) in [[New York City]]. Santiago worked as a [[receptionist]] for [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publisher]] [[Peermusic]]. As a receptionist Maria Elena probably first met Buddy in August 1957 when as rising stars he and the Crickets first visited Peer Southern Music in the Brill Building at 1619 Broadway  to meet their publishing manager Murray Deutch who was Maria's boss. Then a day or so before Thursday, June 19, 1958 when he recorded 'Early In The Morning' in New York's Pythian Temple, Buddy asked her out.  Santiago had never been out on a date and told Holly he would have to ask her aunt for permission. Holly promptly got her aunt's permission. Five hours into their first date, Buddy handed a rose to Maria and asked her to marry him.&lt;ref name="BHS"&gt;[http://www.houstontheatre.com/buddy2.html The Buddy Holly Story]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Married life==
On August 15, 1958, less than two months later, they were married in Buddy's hometown of [[Lubbock, Texas]]. They settled down in Lubbock until Buddy broke up with his band, [[The Crickets]], and they moved to New York. Santiago-Holly went on one tour (October 1958) with her husband and took on promotional duties.&lt;ref name="BHS"/&gt; Buddy Holly also formed the Maria Music publishing company with which "Stay Close To Me" was filed. Holly produced Lou Giordano's version of the song which was issued on Brunswick 55115 on January 27, 1959.

In the early morning hours of February 3, 1959, Buddy Holly was on tour when he, together with [[Ritchie Valens]] and [[The Big Bopper]], [[The Day the Music Died|died in an airplane crash]].  Holly and Santiago had been married for only six months at the time of his death. She learned of his death from the reports on television. A widow after only six months of marriage, she suffered a [[miscarriage]] shortly after, reportedly due to "[[psychological trauma]]".&lt;ref name="Suddath"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1876542,00.html|title=The Day the Music Died|last=Suddath|first=Claire|date=February 3, 2009|work=Time|accessdate=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddy was interred in Lubbock. 

Santiago-Holly did not attend the funeral and has never visited the grave site. She told the ''Avalanche-Journal'': "In a way, I blame myself. I was not feeling well when he left. I was two weeks pregnant, and I wanted Buddy to stay with me, but he had scheduled that tour. It was the only time I wasn't with him. And I blame myself because I know that, if only I had gone along, Buddy never would have gotten into that airplane."&lt;ref name="LAJ"&gt;''[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]'', Morning Edition, 7 February 1959, Section 1, Page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the miscarriage suffered by Santiago-Holly and the circumstances in which she was informed of his death, a policy was later adopted by authorities not to disclose victims' names until after their families have been informed.&lt;ref name="Suddath2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1876542,00.html|title=The Day the Music Died|last=Suddath|first=Claire|date=February 3, 2009|work=Time|accessdate=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Santiago-Holly eventually remarried and had three children.  Now divorced, she is a grandmother living in [[Dallas, Texas]], and promotes her first husband's legacy. In 1989, [[The Smithereens]] paid honor to her with the song "Maria Elena" on their album ''[[11 (The Smithereens album)|11]]''.  Actress [[Maria Richwine]] played Santiago-Holly's role in the 1978 movie ''[[The Buddy Holly Story]]''. [[Jill Hennessy]] portrayed her in the Broadway production of ''[[Buddy – The Buddy Holly Story]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vergemag.com/0900/muse/muse.html Detailed plot summary and information about the genesis of the show]&lt;/ref&gt;

Santiago-Holly has spent most of her life protecting Buddy Holly's legacy. She controversially wanted to charge the city of Lubbock to use Buddy's name in various ways, including in relation to a music festival, a street named the "Buddy Holly Walk of Fame", and a terrace named "Buddy Holly Terrace."

In 2008, Santiago-Holly threatened legal action against Peggy Sue Gerron, the subject of the song "[[Peggy Sue (song)|Peggy Sue]]", after the publication of Gerron's autobiography ''Whatever Happened to Peggy Sue?''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/01/11/buddy-holly-widow-threatens-to-sue-peggy-sue-over-book/ Fox News]&lt;/ref&gt;

While visiting New York City in May 2008, Santiago-Holly visited Washington Square Park, where Holly often played his guitar. She observed musicians singing there, and later told the ''Avalanche-Journal'':{{Quote box
|quote  = &lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt; "I gave one musician $9 because 9 was Buddy's favorite number"
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|width  = 50%
|align  = center
}} She also visited the apartment building where she and Holly had lived. Santiago-Holly remarked it was the first time she had been back to the building since Holly's death.

==The Buddy Holly Educational Foundation==
In 2010, Santiago-Holly co-founded, with Peter Bradley, the Buddy Holly Educational Foundation. The foundation is a charitable corporation whose mission is to keep Buddy Holly’s legacy alive by providing musical education to new generations regardless of income, ethnicity or educational limitations. Among the areas in the musical education provided are songwriting, production, arranging, orchestration and performance education. The Buddy Holly Educational Foundation co-hosts worldwide songwriting retreats with [[Chris Difford]]. They are organized by Peter Bradley Jr, board Director of the Buddy Holly Educational Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://davestewart.com/the-buddy-holly-educational-foundation-names-ambassador-artists-honoring-buddy-holly/  The Buddy Holly Educational Foundation names Ambassador]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''world's most livable cities''' is an informal name given to any [[list of cities]] as they rank on an annual survey of [[standard of living|living conditions]]. Regions with cities commonly ranked in the top 50 include the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Western Europe]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="MercerSurvey2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=2015 quality of living survey | work=Mercer | date=4 March 2015 |url=http://www.uk.mercer.com/newsroom/2015-quality-of-living-survey.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three examples of such surveys are [[Monocle (lifestyle magazine)|Monocle]]'s "Most Liveable Cities Index", the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]'s "Global Liveability Ranking", and "[[Mercer (consulting firm)|Mercer]] Quality of Living Survey". Numbeo has the largest statistics and survey data based on cities and countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/ Numbeo official website]&lt;/ref&gt; Livability rankings may be used by employers assigning hardship allowances as part of job relocation.

{{main article|Global Liveability Ranking}}

The [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]'s (EIU) publishes an annual Global Liveability Ranking, which ranks 140 cities for their urban [[quality of life]] based on assessments of their stability, [[healthcare]], culture and environment, [[education]] and [[infrastructure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eiu.com/topic/liveability|title=Global Liveability Ranking 2016|website=www.eiu.com|language=en|access-date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Melbourne]], Australia, had been ranked by the EIU as the world's most livable city for seven years in a row, from 2011 to 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-16/melbourne-named-worlds-most-liveable-city-for-seventh-year/8812196|title=World's most liveable city: Melbourne takes top spot for seventh year running|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=16 August 2017|author=Stephanie Chalkley-Rhoden|access-date=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2004 and 2010, [[Vancouver]], Canada, was ranked the EIU's most livable city, with Melbourne sharing first place in the inaugural 2002 report. Vancouver has ranked third since 2015, while [[Vienna]], Austria, ranked second until 2018 when it ranked first.

The Syrian capital, [[Damascus]], was ranked the least livable city of the 140 assessed in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A summary of the liveability ranking and overview|last=Economist Intelligence Unit|first=|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EIU also publishes a Worldwide Cost of Living Survey that compares the cost of living in a range of global cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eiu.com/topic/worldwide-cost-of-living|title=The Worldwide Cost of Living Survey|website=www.eiu.com|language=en|access-date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Mercer Quality of Living Survey}}

American global [[human resources]] and related [[financial services]] consulting firm [[Mercer Human Resource Consulting|Mercer]] annually releases its [[Mercer Quality of Living Survey]], comparing 221 cities based on 39 criteria. New York City is given a baseline score of 100 and other cities are rated in comparison. Important criteria are [[safety]], [[education]], [[hygiene]], [[health care]], [[culture]], [[Natural environment|environment]], [[recreation]], political-economic stability, [[public transport]] and access to goods and services. The list is intended to help [[multinational companies]] decide where to open offices or plants, and how much to pay employees. For nine consecutive years (2009–2017), Mercer ranked [[Austria]]'s capital [[Vienna]] first in its annual "Quality of Living" survey, a title the city still held in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monocle|title=Quality of Live Survey 2015|url=http://monocle.com/film/affairs/the-monocle-quality-of-life-survey-2015/|publisher=Monocle|accessdate=24 June 2015}}[[Monocle (2007 magazine)|Monocle's]] 2012 "Quality of Life Survey" ranked Vienna fourth on a list of the top 25 cities in the world "to make a base within" (up from sixth in 2011 and eighth in 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quality of Life Survey 2012|url=http://www.monocle.com/sections/affairs/Web-Articles/The-Monocle-Quality-of-Life-Survey-2012/|publisher=Monocle|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monocle's top 25 cities for 2011, on businessinsider.com|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/monocle-quality-of-life-2011-6?op=1|accessdate=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monocle's 2011 "Quality of LIfe" summary|url=http://www.monocle.com/sections/affairs/Web-Articles/Most-liveable-city-Helsinki/|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monocle.com/sections/affairs/Magazine-Articles/08-Vienna/ |title=08 Vienna |publisher=Monocle.com |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monocle's Quality of Life Survey==
[[File:Stadtbild_München.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Munich]] was ranked highest by ''[[Monocle (lifestyle magazine)|Monocle]]'' in 2018]]

Since 2006, the lifestyle magazine ''[[Monocle (lifestyle magazine)|Monocle]]'' has published an annual list of livable cities. The list in 2008 was named "The Most Liveable Cities Index" and presented 25 top locations for [[quality of life]].

Important criteria in this survey are safety/crime, international connectivity, climate/sunshine, quality of architecture, public transport, tolerance, environmental issues and access to nature, urban design, business conditions, pro-active policy developments and medical care.

The 2018 Monocle Survey determined the world's most livable city was [[Munich]], followed by [[Tokyo]], [[Vienna]] and [[Zurich]]. A total of four [[German cities]] were on the list of the 25 most livable cities, 15 out of the 25 were [[Europe|European]], 3 each from [[Japan]] and [[Australia]], and one from [[North America]] ([[Vancouver]]). No cities from [[South America]], [[South Asia]], or [[Africa]] made it into the list.&lt;ref&gt;[[Forbes|forbes.com]] [https://www.forbes.com/sites/bishopjordan/2018/06/25/monocle-most-livable-city-quality-life-survey-2018-munich/#35c5a3bd6153 Munich Named The Most Livable City In The World] Published: 25 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oriental management''' is a modern management school based on both the latest and historical theories as well as practices and rules of [[management]] inside and outside China. Although similar thoughts have been proposed in the early 1970s,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-GLXB200601002.htm|title=Oriental Management Theory: Its Source,Essence and Framework--《Chinese Journal of Management》2006年01期|website=en.cnki.com.cn|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; oriental management gained traction in the early 1990s having been launched [[Su Dongshui]]. The concept is generally based on the unique traditional culture of eastern countries, especially China, and has integrated the essence of management thoughts from both the east and the west, after decades of study.&lt;ref&gt;Su Dongshui, ''Oriental Management'', Shanghai: Fudan University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The theoretical foundations of oriental management are ''Chinese Management'', ''Western Management,'' and ''Overseas Chinese Management''. It adopted an approach that is people-oriented, with a strong focus on "human morality," and "human behavior." The framework prioritizes learning, ideal behavior, governing, action, and harmony.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Utility ==
Aside from serving as a form of management standards for Chinese companies, oriental management can be useful for managers and organizations that encounter specific challenges involving ethics, conflict, and poor performance. Since it incorporates elements of [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]] and Western management theories, it is capable of creating a culture of accommodation, transformation, learning, teamwork, and respect for hierarchy, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art Of Modern Oriental Management: Applying The Chinese, Japanese And Korean Management Styles At Work|last=Ong|first=Yu Sing|publisher=World Scientific|year=2017|isbn=9789813220317|location=London|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; An understanding of oriental management can also provide people interested in doing business in China meaningful insights into the Chinese business practices and norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Oriental Corporate Culture: A Case Collection|last=Su|first=Yong|last2=Chen|first2=Lanjian|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=9783642352133|location=Heidelberg|pages=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Scope ==
The research scope of oriental management is not confined to business, but extending to almost all fields of management, including individual governance, management analysis, family governance, business governance and state governance. By exercising and implementing the "Fifteen philosophical elements", including rules of governing a state, flexibility against changes, human orientedness, application of power, pragmaticism, regarding harmony as priority, attaching importance on using tools, state governance by law, embarking on a business with credit and good faith, being well planned, stratagem in decision making, subtle using of tactics, being highly efficient and uncorrupted, being industrious in making a fortune, and entelechy with reason, the highest purpose or ultimate value of oriental management is [[harmonious society]] in which everybody fulfills his comprehensive and free development.

A '''partially disclosed principal''' is one whose agent reveals that he has a principal, but does not reveal the principal's identity. This concept has important implications in liability law. It is in contrast to a [[disclosed principal]] and [[undisclosed principal]].&lt;ref&gt;Bohlman, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-324-06183-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Process optimization''' is the discipline of adjusting a process so as to optimize some specified set of parameters without violating some constraint.  The most common goals are minimizing cost and maximizing throughput and/or efficiency.  This is one of the major [[quantitative property|quantitative]] tools in industrial [[decision theory|decision making]].

When [[optimization|optimizing]] a process, the goal is to maximize one or more of the process specifications, while keeping all others within their constraints. This can be done by using a [[process mining]] tool, discovering the critical activities and bottlenecks, and acting only on them.

== Areas ==
Fundamentally, there are three parameters that can be adjusted to affect optimal performance.  They are:
* Equipment optimization
The first step is to verify that the existing equipment is being used to its fullest advantage by examining operating data to identify equipment bottlenecks.

* Operating procedures
Operating procedures may vary widely from person-to-person or from shift-to-shift.  Automation of the plant can help significantly.  But automation will be of no help if the operators take control and run the plant in manual.

* Control optimization
In a typical processing plant, such as a [[chemical plant]] or [[oil refinery]], there are hundreds or even thousands of control loops.  Each control loop is responsible for controlling one part of the process, such as maintaining a temperature, level, or flow.

If the [[control loop]] is not properly designed and tuned, the process runs below its optimum.  The process will be more expensive to operate, and equipment will wear out prematurely.  For each control loop to run optimally, identification of sensor, valve, and tuning problems is important.  It has been well documented that over 35% of control loops typically have problems.{{Fact|date=June 2008}}

The process of continuously monitoring and optimizing the entire plant is sometimes called performance supervision.

''' Retail Intelligence''' is the set of tools and applications focused on the creation and [[Knowledge management|management of knowledge]] through the recollection, processing, interaction and analysis of information generated in all operations performed by any retailer.

Retail Intelligence applications can relate in real time and interactively, the internal variables (range, space, pricing, promotions, staff, sales) with the [[external variable]]s (influence zone and its commercial mix), with different parameters of the shopper's behavior, such as [[pedestrian]] flows and magnitudes, length of stay, occupancy, hot spots, etc.

These applications provide users with a greater understanding of the current functioning of the points of sale and the [[buyer behaviour]] (shopper), to anticipate future events, with the aim of improving the competitive position of its portfolio of stores increasing [[Profit (economics)|profitability]], efficiency commercial and [[customer service]], and identify new business opportunities.

==Operation==

Retail Intelligence tools combine the technology hardware (readers of traffic, [[people counter]]s, [[motion sensor]]s) with [[management software]] used for data access tools and provide reports, analysis, views and alerts to users.

==Tools==
Retail Intelligence includes the following tools:
* External Traffic reader: sensor that allows external counting.
* In&amp;Out traffic counter: sensors that count in&amp;out traffic at points of sale, allowing to separate the inputs and outputs as well as gauging and measuring the average time of stay.
* Motion sensors: sensors that enable the flow behavior of customers, distinguishing the hottest areas from the least visited at each point of sale.
Access to information is done interactively, via [[intranet]] and through tiered access, providing reporting, analysis, views and alerts to users.

'''Robert A. Bennett''' (born 1941) is an American banking and finance [[journalist]] who worked for ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''U.S. Banker'' (also previously known as ''United States Banker''). Bennett wrote for ''The New York Times'' between 1977–1989, most in his official capacity as the newspaper's Banking Correspondent (1979–1988).&lt;ref&gt;[http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/b/robert_a_bennett/index.html "Robert A. Bennett - The New York Times," ''The New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt; After his tenure at ''The New York Times,'' Bennett served as Editor of ''U.S. Banker'' from 1988–1992 and, later, as Editor-in-Chief from 2000-2002.&lt;ref name=Good6&gt;Andrew L. Goodenough, "A Word from the Publisher," ''United States Banker'', April 1988: 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wanda Cantrell, "Publisher's Letter," ''US Banker'', March 1, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his hiring by ''U.S. Banker'' in 1988, the Publisher, Andrew L. Goodenough, called Bennett, "the nation's premier banking editor."&lt;ref name=Good6/&gt; Goodenough described Bennett's reach in the financial world: "[Robert A. Bennett] is known personally by most of the nation's financial institution leaders; the rest most certainly know him by name and reputation.

During his forty-plus years in banking and finance journalism, Bennett also wrote and worked for other financial publications, including ''[[American Banker]]'' and ''[[The Bond Buyer]]''.

JH Beers &amp; Co., 1906, page 200&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882, he moved to Racine where he became a [[parquetry|parquet]] flooring salesman for the Racine Hardware Manufacturing Co. In 1886, he purchased the flooring business from the company and renamed it Johnson's Prepared Paste Wax Company. A few years later he established his own factory for manufacturing floor waxes and wood finishes. When his son, [[Herbert Fisk Johnson Sr.]] became a partner in 1906, the firm was renamed S. C. Johnson &amp; Son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=1537&amp;term_type_id=1&amp;term_type_text=people&amp;letter=J |accessdate=March 24, 2014 |title=Johnson, Samuel Curtis 1833 - 1919 |publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society |work=Dictionary of Wisconsin History |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324051556/http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=1537&amp;term_type_id=1&amp;term_type_text=people&amp;letter=J |archivedate=March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scott Picken''' is a [[South Africa]]n-born [[real estate]] investor and entrepreneur. He is the co-founder of [[Wealth Migrate]], a fintech company that offers  [[real estate]] investments on its online marketplace through [[crowdfunding]]. He began offering real estate investment solutions at the age of 26 when he founded International Property Solutions. ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' named [[Wealth Migrate]] as one of the top 60 real estate crowdfunding solutions in the [[United States]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-drake/advancing-forward-the-top_b_6373984.html|title=Advancing Forward: The Top 60 US Real Estate Crowdfunding Platforms|last=Journalist|first=David Drake|last2=Group|first2=The Soho Loft Media|date=2014-12-24|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Picken is the author of ''Property Going Global''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fin24.com/Money/Property/Buying-property-overseas-is-like-buying-a-boat-expert-20150518|title=Buying property overseas is like buying a boat - expert|access-date=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Picken grew up in [[South Africa]], before he moved to [[London]] to study. In 1998, Picken wrote his dissertation on how he expected technology to change the way we invest in property. He moved to [[London]] to continue his education. Picken graduated in 2001 with a [[masters degree]], also studying the effect of technology on [[real estate]] investing.&lt;ref name=crowdfund&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alois|first1=JD|title=Global Real Estate Crowdfunding Site Wealth Migrate Looks to Asia for Rapid Expansion|url=http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2015/08/72221-global-real-estate-crowdfunding-site-wealth-migrate-looks-to-asia-for-rapid-expansion/|publisher=Crowdfund Insider|date=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After leaving [[University]], Picken setup International Property Solutions (IPS) at the age of 26. The company assisted people with overseas investments in his native [[South Africa]]. During the next few years, Picken helped thousands of people invest in property on four different continents.&lt;ref name=crowdfund /&gt;

During an interview, Picken recalled the opportunity to invest in property after the 2008 financial crisis hit. He stated that there were incredible buying opportunities in [[Wimbledon, London]] at the time. In order to capitalize on these opportunities, he required £10 million but didn't have the time to raise the funds. He decided that after missing the buying opportunity, he would be interested in creating a vehicle that allowed investors to have quick access to buying power.&lt;ref name=crowdfund /&gt;

Following the development of the idea, Picken co-founded [[Wealth Migrate]] with Hennie Bezuidenhoudt as his co-founder. The company was launched to assist people to invest in real estate assets, through various partnerships.&lt;ref name=fin24&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Glenda|title=Driving access to the global property market|url=http://www.fin24.com/Finweek/Entrepreneurs/Driving-access-to-the-global-property-market-20151015|publisher=Fin24|date=October 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Picken took the step of using a number of existing partners to launch the [[crowdfunding]] platform. Picken was interviewed in the media on a regular basis following the launch of the innovative company. The platform allowed individuals to invest in property around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dewberry|first1=Lisa|title=Real-estate crowdfunding is unchartered territory in SA|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/decor/property/2015/11/13/Real-estate-crowdfunding-is-unchartered-territory-in-SA|publisher=[[The Sunday Times (South Africa)]]|date=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea was further developed by Picken after he studied the figures behind small investments made in real estate. Using equity companies as an example, they would often invest a small percentage of their funds into [[real estate]]. Serious investors would likely use a middleman for these transactions, which would dramatically affect the [[return on investment]]. [[Wealth Migrate]]'s margins were not only lower than traditional charges, but it also made larger projects more accessible to the common real estate investor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benjamin|first1=Jeff|title=Real estate crowdfunding trend presents new challenges, opportunities for financial advisers|url=http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20150713/FREE/150719980/real-estate-crowdfunding-trend-presents-new-challenges-opportunities|publisher=InvestmentNews|date=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Picken stated in an interview with [[CNBC]] that investors could make both residential and commercial [[investments]]. Individual investors would normally struggle to invest in larger projects, as they would have to either find the partners themselves or find other ways to raise the full capital amount.&lt;ref name=cnbcafrica&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wealth Within the Property Sector|url=http://www.cnbcafrica.com/video/?bctid=4277034994001|publisher=[[CNBC Africa]]|date=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wealth Migrate would allow capital investments as low as $10,000 for investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Few Minutes With … Scott Picken of Wealth Migrate|url=https://www.financialpoise.com/accreditedinvestormarkets/a-few-minutes-with-scott-picken/|publisher=Financial Poise|date=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was launched in [[South Africa]], before expanding abroad.&lt;ref name=fin24 /&gt;

After five years in operation, [[Wealth Migrate]] was selected by [[The Huffington Post]] as one of the top United States Real Estate Crowdfunding Platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drake|first1=David|title=Advancing Forward: The Top 60 US Real Estate Crowdfunding Platforms|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-drake/advancing-forward-the-top_b_6373984.html|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=December 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The selection likely came off the back of the growth of the real estate crowdfunding market, which grew to $2.5 billion in transactions in a single year in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lowenstein|first1=Andie|title=A Secret Behind the Booming Real Estate Industry|url=https://www.multihousingnews.com/post/a-secret-behind-the-booming-real-estate-industry/|publisher=MultiHousing News|date=March 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Picken featured in the news during 2015, discussing how he felt [[crowdfunding]] would radically change the way [[real estate]] transactions take place globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CEO’s 2015 Prediction on Real Estate Crowdfunding|url=http://crowdfundbeat.com/2014/12/21/ceos-2015-prediction-on-real-estate-crowdfunding/|publisher=CrowdfundBeat}}&lt;/ref&gt; He raised $4 million in capital for [[Wealth Migrate]] for further expansion in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wealth Migrate Raises Nearly $4 Million to Expand Global Real Estate Investment Platform|url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/wealth-migrate-raises-nearly-4-million-expand-global-real-estate-investment-platform-2055437.htm|publisher=MarketWired|date=September 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wealth Migrate brand expanded its operations to Asia in 2015, under the leadership of Picken.&lt;ref name=crowdfund /&gt;

==Investments==
During an interview with [[CNBC]], Picken discussed his investment strategy for [[Wealth Migrate]] in the [[London]]-area. The commercial [[real estate]] opportunity was based on converting abandoned pubs in the [[United Kingdom]] into convenience stores. The moves received coverage in the British media, as many [[supermarket]] chains used this as a method to open convenience stores in the country in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smithers|first1=Rebecca|title=Supermarkets targeting pubs to exploit legal loophole, says Camra|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/19/supermarkets-target-pubs-loophole-camra|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Picken suggested in an interview with [[GQ magazine|GQ (magazine)]] that investments made by his firm are 70% commercial and 30% residential. The platform was developed to give serious investors the opportunity to make alternative commercial investments when compared to more traditional routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sephton|first1=Paul|title=World of Potential|publisher=[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major examples that were quoted on [[CNBC Africa]], was the investment made in the medical market. Picken stated that [[Wealth Migrate]] invested close to hospitals geographically, which allowed a steady return on the investment.&lt;ref name=cnbcafrica /&gt; Another example given was the investment and purchasing of [[commercial property]] around [[London]], where they would then rent the property to a convenience store company once it had been purchased.&lt;ref name=cnbcafrica /&gt;

Picken is the author of the book, Property Going Global.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official website|url=http://propertygoingglobal.com|publisher=Property Going Global}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Services in the Internal Market Directive''' [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32006L0123 2006/123/EC] (also called the "'''Bolkestein Directive'''") is an [[European Union law|EU law]] aiming at establishing a [[single market]] for [[Service (economics)|services]] within the [[European Union]] (EU). Drafted under the leadership of the former [[European Commissioner|European Commissioner for the Internal Market]] [[Frits Bolkestein]], it has been popularly referred to by his name. It was seen as an important kick-start to the [[Lisbon Agenda]] which, launched in 2000, was an agreed strategy to make the EU "the world's most dynamic and competitive economy" by 2010.

The Bolkestein Directive was harshly criticised by left-wing European politicians, who stated that it would lead to competition between workers in different parts of Europe — hence the expression "[[Polish plumber]]" — resulting in [[social dumping]]. After the 2004 original draft had been substantially amended, the proposal was approved on 12 December 2006 by the European Parliament and Council, and adopted as the Directive 2006/123/EC.

==History==
===2004 original proposal: the three pillars===
Devised by the [[European Commission]] in March 2004, the first draft of the Services Directive propounded several important changes in the EU services market. Assuming every piece of regulation to be burdensome by default, the Directive required member states to justify all existing legislation on the grounds that it was non-discriminatory, necessary and proportional.

However, the changes proposed in the Directive would have not affected the professions, to which the rules of the country where the services are provided would continue to apply under the Directive on the Recognition of Diplomas. Nor, contrary to the popular belief that, for example, a [[Polish plumber]] could work in France under Polish [[labour law]]), would the changes have affected social legislation or health and safety at work (HSW). In these social fields the [[Posted Workers Directive|Posting-of-Workers Directive]] requires that short-term social protection, such as minimum wages and HSW, is governed by the rules of the country where the services are provided (the host country), while long-term benefits, such as pension and unemployment benefit contributions, remain with the country of origin (to which the posted workers returns after the service is over).

===Pros and cons===
====Arguments in favour of the original version====
Legally the Directive did not bring anything into EU law that was not already in the [[EC Treaty]] as interpreted by the Court of Justice. The "country of origin" principle had been gradually introduced into EU law on the freedom of movement of goods in the Cassis de Dijon case (1979) and into other areas, notably services and establishment, soon after. Secondary legislation cannot introduce rights and obligations that do not already have a basis in the Treaty. In this respect, the original draft of the Services Directive was not a novelty, but a clarification of the case law of the European Court of Justice, and a continuation of the "country of origin" principle, which had already been applied in the TV Without Frontiers Directive, the Second Banking Directive, the Third Insurance Directive, the E-Commerce Directive and others.

====Criticisms of the early draft====
[[File:Frits Bolkestein, 78.jpg|thumb|[[Frits Bolkestein]]]]
[[File:Bolkestein.gif|thumb|Protest against [[Frits Bolkestein]] in Brussels on March 19, 2005]]
[[File:CgtSyndicatBrussels.jpg|thumb|French and Belgian trade unions protesting against the directive in Brussels on 19 March 2005]]

The first version of the Bolkestein Directive provoked intense debate and mass protests in various EU countries, including [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]]. On 21 March 2005 nearly 100,000 people marched in [[Brussels]] to protest against the Directive. Critics argued that the Directive would erode many of the Member States' regulations governing industry and the environment, and would lead to competition between workers in different parts of Europe, resulting in a decline in income levels. The expression "[[Polish plumber]]" became famous during the French debate about the Directive, referring to the fear that under the Directive a Polish plumber would be able to work in France under Polish [[labour law]]s. Critics also charged that the Directive was a sign that "Anglo-Saxon" economic policy was running rampant over the EU and claimed that the Directive would inevitably lead to "[[social dumping]]" as companies and jobs were relocated to the lower-cost and less regulated economies of eastern Europe. They also claimed, falsely, that the Directive would have an adverse effect on social legislation and HSW (when, as mentioned above, it would have no effect on either).

===Developments during 2005===
On 22 March 2005 EU leaders agreed on a "far reaching" revision of the Directive to preserve the [[European social model]]. French President [[Jacques Chirac]] told an EU summit in Brussels that the changes planned by the Directive were "unacceptable". Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg declared: "If France wishes to eliminate the risk of social dumping, this will be addressed in the framework of the legislative procedure and of co-decision, which has been initiated." Modifications to the Directive were introduced at a later stage, in the normal course of the EU legislative process.

On 1 July 2005 the UK, which was in favour of the Directive, took the chair of the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|EU Presidency]]. In [[Tony Blair]]'s speech to the European Parliament on 23 June he committed the UK Presidency to try to "resolve some of the hard dossiers," of which the Services Directive was one. However, agreement was not achieved during its Presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4698524.stm | work=BBC News | title=Q&amp;A: Services Directive | date=15 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parliamentary amendments to the original version===
[[File:Strasbourg, protest against Bolkestein IMG 2870.jpg|thumb|Protests against the directive in Strasbourg on 12 February 2006]]

From 14 to 16 February 2006 a plenary session of the [[European Parliament]] carried out its [[first reading]] of the Directive in [[Strasbourg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stopbolkestein.org/index.cfm?Content_ID=1484657 |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nantes.indymedia.org/article.php3?id_article=7473 |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 February 2006 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] (Members of the European Parliament) voted 391-213 in favour of a proposed revision to the Directive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hix | first1 = Simon | last2 = Nourby | first2 = Abdul | title = After enlargement: voting patterns in the sixth European Parliament | journal = [[Legislative Studies Quarterly]] | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 159–174 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi= 10.3162/036298009788314282 | jstor = 20680234 | date = May 2009 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.3162/036298009788314282 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://personal.lse.ac.uk/hix/Working_Papers/HixandNoury-LSQ-May09.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; although it had already been "watered down" from the original version read to the European Parliament on 14 February, so much so that [[Party of European Socialists|Socialist]] MEP [[Evelyne Gebhardt]] said that the Directive had been "turned upside down," a claim contested by labour organisations. The majority of members of the two largest groupings in the Parliament, the conservative [[European People's Party]] (EPP) and the centre-left [[Party of European Socialists]] (PES) voted in favour of the revised draft. The [[Party of the European Left]], the [[European Green Party]] and the [[French Socialist Party]] voted against the new revision. Meanwhile, about 50,000 people demonstrated against the "country of origin principle" in Strasbourg.

====Suggested inclusions====
The proposed Directive would have covered:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/innovation/services-internal-market/article-132241 |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Services of "[[general public interest]]" ([[public services]]), including, but not limited to, [[water]], [[sewage]] and [[waste]] management.
*Services provided to businesses, such as management consultancy, certification and testing, facilities management and advertising,
*Services provided both to businesses and to consumers, such as real estate agencies, construction services, architects, distribution services, car rental and travel agencies.
*Consumer leisure services such as tourism, sports centres and amusement parks.

====Suggested exclusions====
The following, however, would have been excluded:
*[[Broadcasting]],
*[[Gambling]]
*[[Employment agency|Temporary employment agencies]],
*[[Legal]] and [[social]] services,
*[[Mail|Postal]] and [[Audiovisual services]],
*[[Publicly-funded health care|Public health care]] (but not [[Private Healthcare|private health care]]),
*[[Public transport]]

The controversial "[[country of origin]]" principle was explicitly left out, but there was no "country of destination" principle to replace it. The [[European Court of Justice]] would therefore be charged with deciding, through its [[jurisprudence]], which country's [[labour law]]s would apply in each case.

===Comments on the amended draft===
====Proponents of liberalisation====
Business groups stated that the new Directive would limit the benefits that the early version of the Directive would have provided.

The European Commission estimated that this proposed version of the Directive would have created an additional 600,000 jobs in the EU, would have boosted economic growth, and would have increased product quality and choice for consumers.

The ''Wall Street Journal'' estimated that the revised Directive would have failed in its objective: the liberalisation of services at the heart of the EU.

D. Godefridi of the Hayek Institute wrote in ''[[le Figaro]]'': "Services represent 70% of the European economy. In not liberalising these the EU remains below the objective of the founding treaties of 1957: there is no common European market. For ten years European economic project has moved backwards. On 30 May 2006 the European political elite buried the very essence of the European project".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/debats/20060531.FIG000000250_directive_services_liberalisation_zero.html|title=?|author=|date=|work=|publisher=|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125094039/http://www.lefigaro.fr/debats/20060531.FIG000000250_directive_services_liberalisation_zero.html|archivedate=25 November 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opponents of liberalisation====
Left-wing and labour organisations maintained that the new version of the Directive was not as favourable to workers as it was made out to be. There was also concern that the "country of origin" principle would most likely still be applied by the European Court of Justice, as previous jurisprudence seemed to suggest. In particular, it was pointed out that member states would be prohibited from applying any kind of restricted authorisation to businesses in the fields covered by the Directive, which would, they claimed, make administration of labour laws close to impossible.

===Final revision===
On 5 April 2006 the [[European Commission]] presented a new version of the Directive to the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]], including most of the modifications voted by the MEPs, in accordance with the [[codecision procedure]]. On 29 May 2006 the Council approved the revised text, which subsequently was resubmitted to the Parliament for its second and final reading.

==Approval and implementation==
The Directive, after being substantially amended from the original proposal, was adopted on 12 December 2006 by the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] and the [[European Parliament]], and published on the [[Official Journal of the European Union]] on 27 December 2006 as the Directive 2006/123/EC. Therefore, the Directive on services in the internal market should have been completely implemented by the Member States by 28 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edilportale.com/news/2007/01/lavoro/servizi-nella-ue-pubblicata-la-direttiva_9145_33.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edilportale.com/normativa/direttiva-cee/2006/2006-123-ce/direttiva-del-parlamento-europeo-e-del-consiglio-relativa-ai-servizi-nel-mercato-interno-%28ex-bolkestein%29_9956.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euractiv.com/fr/europe-sociale/cedag-confusion-rgne-directive-services/article-184963&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the final version did not include the "country of origin" principle, the Directive instead reminded Member States of the principle of free movement, while accepting inroads when free movement collides with other public interests. However, before making such inroads, authorities have to verify and recognize any protection already provided in the country of origin - under the mutual recognition principle, they need to take into account what takes place in other countries before proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=2bc515ee-b254-42ef-94e9-143a4931249a&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementation===
The Services Directive, which came into force on 28 December 2009, requires all EU Member States to establish web portals so that anyone who provides a service will have a "point of single contact" where they can find out what legal requirements they need to meet to operate in the country in question. Service providers can also use the web portals to apply for any licence or permit they need.

The Directive should make it easier for EU service providers to operate in any other EU Member State. The UK's [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] (Services Directive implementation team), working with marketing consultants, created the EUGO brand for use on point-of-single-contact portals across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/eu-go/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Companies law}}
A '''sole proprietorship''', also known as the '''sole trader''', '''individual entrepreneurship''' or '''proprietorship''', is a type of enterprise that is owned and run by one person and in which there is no legal distinction between the owner and the [[Types of business entity|business entity]]. The owner is in direct control of all elements and is legally accountable for the finances of such business and this may include debts, loans, loss, etc. A sole trader does not necessarily work 'alone'—it is possible for the sole trader to employ other people.&lt;ref&gt;The Accountancy Partnership, [https://www.theaccountancy.co.uk/articles/information/can-a-sole-trader-have-employees-639.html Can a sole trader have employees?] published 10 March 2012, accessed 22 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The sole trader receives all profits (subject to taxation specific to the business) and has unlimited responsibility for all losses and debts. Every asset of the business is owned by the proprietor and all debts of the business are the proprietor's. It is a "sole" proprietorship in contrast with [[partnership]]s (which have at least two owners).

A sole proprietor may use a [[trade name]] or business name other than their or its legal name. They may have to legally trademark their business name if it differs from their own legal name, the process varying depending upon country of residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.smallbusiness.wa.gov.au/step-3-how-do-i-register-my-business-name/|title = Small Business.gov.au - How do I register my business name?|date = |accessdate = 2015-07-13|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140820064531/http://www.smallbusiness.wa.gov.au/step-3-how-do-i-register-my-business-name/|archive-date = 2014-10-18|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Registration of a business name for a sole proprietor is generally uncomplicated unless it involves the selection of a name that is fictitious, or “assumed”. The business owner is required to register with the appropriate [[local authorities]], who will determine that the name submitted is not duplicated by another [[business entity]]. Furthermore, the business owner must complete a form submitted to the governing authority to acquire title as a “DBA” or "[[doing business as]]”. The authority in some US states is the Secretary of State.

The license for a sole proprietary business entitles the owner to hire [[Employment|employees]] and enlist the services of [[Independent contractor|independent consultants]]. Although an employee or consultant may be requested by the owner to complete a specific project or participate in the company's [[decision-making]] process, their contribution to the project or decision is considered a ''recommendation'' under the law. Under the [[legal doctrine]] ''Respondeat superior'' ([[Latin]]: "let the master answer"), the [[legal liability]] for any business decision arising from such a contribution remains upon the owner and cannot be renounced or [[Apportionment|apportioned]].

This is transposed by the unlimited liability attached to a sole proprietary business. The owner carries the financial responsibility for all [[debts]] and/or losses suffered by the business, to the extent of using personal or other assets, to discharge any outstanding [[Liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]]. The owner is exclusively liable for all business activities conducted by the sole proprietorship and accordingly, entitled to full control and all earnings associated with it. The general aspect according to the general business law is that this type of business owner does not embody a “[[legal entity]]” Furthermore, any attempted and unreliable distinctions of the business do not change the classification under this title.

==Rules for sole proprietorships in different countries==

===Ireland===
In [[Ireland]], a sole trader who wishes to use a business name must register that name with the [[Companies Registration Office (Ireland)|Companies Registration Office]] (CRO).&lt;ref&gt;Citizens Information Board, [http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/types_of_employment/self_employment/setting_up_a_business_in_ireland.html Starting a Business], published 21 March 2018, accessed 22 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malaysia ===
==== Registration of Sole Proprietorships ====
In [[Malaysia]], there are three different laws governing the registration and administration of sole proprietors:-
# West Malaysia and the Federal Territory of [[Labuan]]: Registration of Business Act 1956 (Act 197);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ssm.com.my/sites/default/files/acts/fscommand/a0197.htm|title=Registration of Business Act 1956|last=|first=|date=|website=Companies Commission of Malaysia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Sabah]]: Trades Licensing Ordinance for the State of Sabah [Sabah Chapter 144].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawnet.sabah.gov.my/Lawnet/SabahLawsDeclaredFederal/TradesLicensingOrdinance(SabahCap144).pdf|title=Trades Licensing Ordinance [Sabah Chapter 144]|last=|first=|date=|website=Sabah State Attorney-General's Chambers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In West Malaysia, the registration of sole proprietors come under the purview of the [[Companies Commission of Malaysia]] (''Suruhanjaya Syarikat Malaysia'', or abbreviated as ''SSM''). In Sabah and Sarawak (with the exception of Kuching), the registration of businesses are done at the local authorities (e.g. municipal councils or district offices) while in [[Kuching]], sole proprietors are registered with the Kuching Office of the Malaysian Inland Revenue Board.

Sole proprietors, which includes the self-employed, must register with the relevant authority within thirty (30) days from the commencement of their business&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssm.com.my/sites/default/files/guidelines/OWNER%20RESPONSIBILITY_new.pdf|title=Responsibility of Business Owner|last=|first=|date=|website=Companies Commission of Malaysia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Sole proprietors may register their business using one of two names: (1) their legal name following the registrant's identity card or (2) a trade name&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ssm.com.my/en/sole/starting-a-sole-proprietorship-partnership|title=Starting a Sole Proprietorship/Partnership|last=|first=|date=|website=Companies Commission of Malaysia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Registration of a business lasts either one or two years, and must be renewed thirty (30) days before its expiry&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 

In the event of termination of business, the proprietor has thirty (30) days from the termination date to file the notice with the relevant authority&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. If the termination is caused by the death of the proprietor, the administrators of the estate has four (4) months from the death date to file a notice of termination&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

==== Goods and Services Tax (GST) ====
Sole proprietors must register with the Royal Malaysian Customs Department to charge and collect goods and services tax (GST) once their taxable turnover within a 12 month-period exceeds RM500,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gst.customs.gov.my/en/SiteAssets/doc/Registering%20for%20GST%20Amend%201.pdf|title=Getting Ready for GST – Registering for GST|last=|first=|date=|website=Royal Malaysian Customs Department|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Sole Proprietors as Employers ====
Similar to other Common Law jurisdiction, proprietors may enter into contracts of employment and/or apprenticeship with their employees. Sole proprietors, as employers, are responsible to:-
* Make contribution to their employees' Employees Provident Fund&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kwsp.gov.my/portal/en/employers|title=EPF - Employers - KWSP|website=www.kwsp.gov.my|language=ms-MY|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and
* Pay contribution to their employees' Social Security&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.perkeso.gov.my/index.php/en/social-security-protection/employer-employee-eligibility|title=Employer &amp; Employee Eligibility|last=User|first=Super|website=www.perkeso.gov.my|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Online Businesses ====
In 2016, the SSM took legal action against 478 online businesses who fail to register their businesses whether as sole proprietors, partnerships, or private limited companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2016/01/26/ssm-unregistered-businesses-cannot-sell-products-online/|title=SSM: Unregistered businesses cannot sell products online - Nation {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As at May 12 2017, a total of 50,882 online businesses have registered with the SSM since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astroawani.com/berita-bisnes/50-882-peniaga-online-berdaftar-dengan-ssm-143421|title=50882 peniaga online berdaftar dengan SSM|website=www.astroawani.com|language=ms|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom ===
A sole trader is the simplest type of business structure defined in UK law. It refers to an individual who owns their own business and retains all the profits from it. When starting up, sole traders must complete a straightforward registration with [[HM Revenue and Customs]] as self-employed for tax and National Insurance purposes.&lt;ref&gt;HMRC, [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/selfemployed/register-selfemp.htm First Steps To Register As Self-Employed]&lt;/ref&gt; They are responsible for maintaining the businesses records and submitting an annual Tax return for all income from self-employment and other work.&lt;ref&gt;Business Link, [http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1073789606&amp;type=RESOURCES  Legal Structures: The Basics - Sole Trader]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, anyone who begins work for themselves is considered by the Government to be a self-employed sole trader, regardless of whether or not they have advised [[HM Revenue and Customs]]. A sole trader can keep all the profits of their business after tax has been paid. They must lodge a self-assessment tax return each year, and pay Income Tax as well as [[National Insurance]]. If revenue is expected to be more than £83,000 a year, they must also register for the [[Value Added Tax (United Kingdom)|Value Added Tax]]. A sole trader can employ staff, but is personally responsible for any losses the business makes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.gov.uk/business-legal-structures/sole-trader|title = Choose a legal structure for your business|date = 1 April 2015|accessdate = 7 July 2015|website = GOV.UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Advantages ====
Becoming a sole trader is relatively simple compared to other business structures. It can rapidly enable a business to begin trading; the requirements for record keeping are far more straightforward than other business structures. Sole traders make all operational decisions and are solely responsible for raising business finance. They can invest their own capital into the business, or may be able to access business loans and/or overdrafts. Unlike limited companies or partnerships, it is not necessary to share decision making or the profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Set up as a sole trader|url=https://www.gov.uk/set-up-sole-trader|website=gov.uk|publisher=Crown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Disadvantages ====
The simplicity of this structure also has its limitations. Unlike forming a limited company, it lacks the clear cut definition between personal and business income from the perspective of the tax authorities.{{Fact|date=July 2012}} The business owner is personally liable for income tax and National Insurance contributions due for the business profits in each given tax year. They are also personally liable for any debts the business incurs. Business analysts may advise sole traders to form a limited company in order to access greater levels of financing, for example for expansion plans. This can limit their personal liability; business lenders may be more inclined to co-operate with a limited company. It can also be the case that within certain industries it is easier to secure work if presenting potential business partners with a [[Limited company|limited company structure]].

===United States===
In the United States there are no formalities that must be followed to start a sole proprietorship or commence business as a sole proprietor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=The Sole Proprietorship|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/sole_proprietorship.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=26 January 2018|date=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, depending upon the business activity of the sole proprietorship, sole proprietors may require licenses and permits in order to conduct business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Christopher|title=What Are the Registration Requirements &amp; Procedures for Sole Proprietorship?|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/registration-requirements-procedures-sole-proprietorship-3953.html|website=Chron|publisher=Texas Chronicle|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Small Business Administration]] (SBA) a sole proprietor and their business are considered as one and the same; therefore, the business is not subjected to separate taxation and regarded as the direct income of the owner. Income, losses and expenses may be listed on a Schedule C, which is then transferred to the personal tax return of the owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sole Proprietorships|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/sole-proprietorships|website=IRS|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=26 January 2018|date=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the responsibility of the owner to ensure all due income taxes and self-employment contributions are paid.

A permitted exception to the sole proprietor (single owner) stipulation is made by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) permitting the spouse of a sole proprietor to work for the business. They are not classified as partners in the enterprise, or an [[independent contractor]], enabling the business to retain its sole proprietorship status and not be required to submit a partnership income tax return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Husband and Wife Business|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/husband-and-wife-business|website=Internal Revenue Service|publisher=irs.gov|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Foundation and development====
The setting-up process of a sole proprietorship to comply with local laws and regulations, is obtainable from the Small Business Development Center (SBDC), using their locator facility. A sole proprietor must be prepared to devote their time, utilizing business methods towards establishing a sound and appropriate foundation. Doing so may contribute to increased turnover, profits, minimize taxes, and avoid other potential adversities. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weltman|first1=Barbara|title=J.K. Lasser's Small Business Taxes 2011: Your Complete Guide to a Better|date=2011|publisher=Wiley|isbn=0470939575|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w7ruyHGt6BYC|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sole owners are engaged in many varieties of industry and commerce and a comprehensive list of the primary categories, is found in the [[North American Industry Classification System]] (NAICS). The selection of a business type by a new sole proprietor is in many instances, motivated by appropriate business experience in a particular field, especially those pertaining to enterprises involving the marketing and selling of defined products and services.

A crucial component of a sole proprietorship within a business plan is the provision of an inherent guideline, for actions that require implementing for a business to achieve growth. The business name and products are critical aspects in the founding of a sole proprietorship and once selected, should be protected. In the event of a determined brand name being legalized, information regarding trademark protection is available from the U.S. Patent and [[Trademark]] Office.

====Finances====
For the sole proprietor there are a variety of options in obtaining financial support for their business, including loan facilities available from the U.S. [[Small Business Administration]]. The loans are not originated by the SBA, but the administration does guarantee loans made by various independent lending institutions. The primary loan facility for small businesses offered by this agency is the 7(a) loan program, designed for general applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = 7(a) Loan Program|url = https://www.sba.gov/7a-loan-program|website = SBA.gov|accessdate = 11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sole proprietors are able to finance legitimate operating expenses; for example, working capital, furniture, leasehold improvements and building renovations.

Many and varied private [[organizations]] and individuals seek opportunities to invest and fund a business that may not qualify for [[Small business financing|traditional financing]] from institutions, such as banks. For the sole proprietor, seeking to take advantage of this facility, there are various factors that must be understood and adhered to regarding the [[loan application]].

The [[Small Business Administration]] (SBA) advises there are traditionally two forms of financing: [[debt]] and [[Equity (finance)|equity]]. For any [[small business owner]] seeking funding, they must consider the [[debt-to-equity ratio]] of their enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The SBA Loan Guarantee Program|url=https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/SDOLoanFactSheet_Oct_2011.pdf|website=Small Business Administration|accessdate=26 January 2018|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means the inter-action between the sum of dollars borrowed and the financial dollars invested in the business. The mathematics are simple; greater the finance invested by sole proprietors in their business; easier the obtaining of finance! The SBA statistics show that the majority of [[small enterprises]] favor the use of limited equity financing; for example, friends and relatives.

According to the SBA, there are various private organizations prepared to fund sole proprietor [[business operations]] that do not qualify for traditional financing from banks. These [[private investors]] can provide loans, credit lines, leasing facilities for equipment, or other forms of capital, to sole proprietorship that have exhausted alternative financial resources. It is also possible for these owners to obtain financing by way of [[business partners]] or others, with cash to invest. Financial partners are frequently “silent” and although they do not participate in any business related decisions, they generally receive a percentage of the profits, generated by the business.

To assist sole proprietors, there are business grants available from the Federal Government or private organizations, providing certain criteria are met. To qualify for Federal grants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Sole Proprietorship Loan Programs|url = http://www.sba.gov/category/navigation-structure/loans-grants/small-business-loans/sba-loan-programs|website = SBA.gov|accessdate = 11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; small businesses must comply with determined business size and income standards. For consideration regarding various grant opportunities, sole proprietors may apply for a grant in their capacity as an individual. [[Local governments]] and state economic development agencies, frequently make [[grants]] available, for businesses that stimulate their [[local economies]].

For any sole proprietor applying for a loan, before starting the loan procedure, it is essential their personal and business credit history is in order and up-to-date. A personal credit report should be obtained from a credit bureau; for example, Trans-Union, [[Equifax]] or [[Experian]]. This action should be initiated by a business owner well before starting the borrowing process.

The [[Small Business Administration]] specifies that all credit reports received from any source should be carefully reviewed to ensure that all relevant [[personal information]] is correct. Other content in the report should also be examined particularly that related to the past credit obtained, from sources such as, credit cards, [[mortgages]], student loans, as well as details pertaining to how the credit was repaid.

===Other countries ===
An exact translation of "sole proprietorship" is unusual, because the focus of the concept can change. An example is the Brazilian concept of "sole business" that was split into two main kinds of [[Freelancer|formal freelancer]]:
*'''sole professional''': with [[Academic certificate#Higher level academic certificates|higher level academic certificate]] and regulations for formal control of autonomous exercise (ex. sole doctor's office).
*'''sole entrepreneur''': typical "little entrepreneurs", as sole craftsman, autonomous taxi driver, and many others, that can be formal. An [[Informal sector|informal]] freelancer, through a simple process, can be formalized as ''sole microentrepreneur'' 

[[German tax system|German]] and [[Law of Austria|Austrian]] tax laws also differentiate between sole professionals and other sole proprietors.

'''Supervision''' is an act or instance of directing, managing, or oversight.

==Etymology ==
The [[English language|English]] noun "supervision" derives from the two [[Latin]] words "super" (above) and "videre" (see, observe).

{{distinguish|Supervizion}}
The spelling is "Supervision" in Standard English of all English linguistic varieties, including North American English.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Supervision is the act or function of overseeing something or somebody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=supervizion.com|title=Supervision or Supervizion|url=http://www.supervizion.com/blog/supervision-or-supervizion/|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who performs supervision is a "supervisor", but does not always have the formal title of [[supervisor]]. A person who is getting supervision is the "supervisee".

==Theoretical scope==
Generally, supervision contains elements of providing knowledge, helping to organize tasks, enhance motivation, and monitoring activity and results; the amount of each element is varying in different contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=supervizion.com|title=Supervision or Supervizion|url=http://www.supervizion.com/blog/supervision-or-supervizion/|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of supervision==

===Academia===
In [[academia]], supervision is aiding and guiding of a postgraduate research student, [[graduate student]], or undergraduate student, in their research project; offering both moral support and scientific insight and guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55889551|title=Research supervision for supervisors and their students|last=1944-|first=Remenyi, D.,|date=2004|publisher=Academic Conferences International|others=Money, Arthur H., 1941-|isbn=0954709608|location=Kidmore End|oclc=55889551}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supervisor is often a senior scientist or scholar, and in some countries called [[doctoral advisor]].

===Business===
In [[business]], supervision is overseeing the work of staff. The person performing supervision could lack a formal title or carry the title [[supervisor]] or [[manager]], where the latter has wider authority.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5266">'''Thomas Foulis''' (fl. 1580-1628) Scottish goldsmith and financier.

Thomas Foulis was an Edinburgh goldsmith and financier, he was also involved in the mint and coinage, gold and lead mining, and from May 1591 the receipt of money given to [[James VI of England]] by [[Elizabeth I of England]], known as the English annuity or subsidy. He was a son of Henry Foulis of Colinton and Margaret Haldane.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Goodare, (2004, September 23). 'Foulis, Thomas (c. 1560–1628), goldsmith, financier, and mining entrepreneur', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Retrieved 29 Sep. 2018, [https://doi-org.nls.idm.oclc.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/73674], subscription or library log-in required.&lt;/ref&gt; As a financier to the mint and crown his business partner was Robert Joussie, or Jowsie (d. 1610), an Edinburgh cloth merchant who later became [[Groom of the Chamber]].&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Scotland'' vol. 13 part 1 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 228: Neil Cuddy, 'The Revival of the Entourage' in David Starkey, ''The English Court'' (London, 1987), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foulis was made a master of the Edinburgh Incorporation of Goldsmiths and burgess on 18 June 1581 after submitting an essay of silverwork. His master had been Michael Gilbert. A son David followed him into the craft.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Munro &amp; Henry Steuart Fotheringham, ''Edinburgh Goldsmith's Minutes'' (Edinburgh, 2006), p. 32, 142.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1581/2 he made new dies for minting coins, following the designs of [[George Seton, 7th Lord Seton|Lord Seton's]] painter.&lt;ref&gt;Robert William Cochran-Patrick, ''Records of the Coinage of Scotland'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1876), pp. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

James VI sent Foulis and Joussie to London in July 1589 to buy clothes and ornaments for his marriage to [[Anne of Denmark]]. James gave him a pleadge of two cut rubies and three cabochon rubies set in gold "chattons" or buttons from the crown jewels for these purchases and new work.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), no. 154: David Masson, ''Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, 1585-1592'', vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt; Foulis supplied jewels to James VI and Anne, while Joussie supplied clothes and fabrics (Foulis also had a stock of fabric at his death).&lt;ref&gt;Julian Goodare, ''ODNB'' (2004): See [https://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk], (1629 Foullis, Thomas (Wills and testaments Reference CC14/5/3, Lanark Commissary Court)).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1590 he made a silver-gilt and engraved basin and ewer for [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth's]] christening gift to Elizabeth Stewart, the daughter of [[Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell]], and advanced the English ambassador [[Robert Bowes (diplomat)|Robert Bowes]] £20 sterling to reward the servants and musicians.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10, pp. 857-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1594 he received a grant to prospect and mine for gold, silver, lead, tin and other metals, in Lanarkshire.&lt;ref&gt;''The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707'', K.M. Brown et al eds (St Andrews, 2007-2018), 1594/4/82. Date accessed: 28 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; He became known as Thomas Foulis of Leadhills.

Foulis became involved in the administration of the Scottish exchequer by the group knowns as the [[Octavians]]. They gave him a role on 29 December 1597 overseeing royal expenditure. However, Foulis was bankrupted by the scheme on 17 January 1598.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Goodare, 'The Octavians', in Miles Kerr-Peterson and Steven J. Reid ed., ''James VI and Noble Power'' (Abingdon, 2017), p. 182, 184-6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Aston]] wrote that Foulis was treasurer in all but name and after twenty days "fell by his wits" and lay "in great extremity". [[David Calderwood]] called his distress a frenzy, "phrenesie".&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Scotland'' vol. 13 part 1 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; He recovered and on 2 August 1598 Foulis and Joussie obtained a contract (a tack) to operate the mint for six years in recompense of their losses.&lt;ref&gt;Robert William Cochran-Patrick, ''Records of the Coinage of Scotland'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1876), pp. 269-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

James Hudson wrote in May 1598 that Foulis was involved in pawning a gold lion set with a ruby worth £400 in London, which he suggested belonged to James VI.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Scotland'' vol. 13 part 1 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1613 Foulis had the contract for a silvermine at Hilderston near Linlithgow. He died in Edinburgh in 1628.

==Family==
Foulis married firstly Jean Francis, who died in 1623, then Rachel Porteous. Jean had sons, Thomas and David Foulis of Glendorch, and three daughters, Margaret, Jean, and another who married James McMath. After his death a cousin, Anne Foulis, who was married to [[James Hope of Hopetoun]], eventually inherited the mining wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Goodare, ''ODNB'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1562">'''Voluntary Counselling and Testing''' ('''VCT''') for [[HIV]] usually involves two counseling sessions: one prior to taking the test known as "pre-test counseling" and one following the HIV test when the results are given, often referred to as "post-test counseling". Counseling focuses on the infection (HIV), the disease ([[AIDS]]), the test, and positive behavior change.  VCT has become popular in many parts of [[Africa]] as a way for a person to learn their HIV status.  VCT centers and counselors often use rapid HIV tests that require a drop of [[blood]] or some [[cell (biology)|cell]]s from the inside of one's cheek; the tests are cheap, require minimal training, and provide accurate results in about 15 minutes.
