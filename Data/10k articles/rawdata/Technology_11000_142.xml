      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2949">An '''Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration''' (ACTD) enables the evaluation of mature advanced technology for usage by the United States Military. ACTDs allow technology evaluation earlier and cheaper than would be possible through the formal acquisition of new production capabilities. ACTDs must be sponsored by an operational user with approval and oversight from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Advanced Systems and Concepts (DUSD(AS&amp;C)).  No ACTDs were initiated after 2006, when the DUSD(AS&amp;C) initiated the follow-on Joint Concept Technology Demonstration (JCTD) program to emphasize multiservice technology development and improved planning for transition to operations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtic.mil/descriptivesum/Y2009/OSD/0603648D8Z.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anatoliy O. Morozov''' (born May 9, 1939) is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] scientist in the field of [[cybernetics]]. He is a Corresponding Member of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]], a Full member (Academician) of the International Academy of Information Science and the Academy of Technological Sciences of Russia and the President of the [[Academy of Technological Sciences of Ukraine]].

==Early life and education==
Morozov was born in [[Kiev]], in the [[Ukrainian SSR]] of the [[Soviet Union]], in present-day [[Ukraine]]. He was educated at the [[Kyiv Polytechnic Institute]] and was a student and follower of [[Victor Glushkov]]. From 1961 to 1992 he worked at the Institute of Cybernetics, Kiev. Since then he is with the Institute of Mathematical Machines and Systems Problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.immsp.kiev.ua/perspages/eng/morozov_ao/index.html |title=IMMSP - Personal page: Anatoliy O. Morozov |work=immsp.kiev.ua  |accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable works==
Morozov was the chief designer of the automated control system of the Lviv manufacturing project, supervised by Glushkov. In 1970 Glushkov and the developers of Lviv were awarded the State Award of Ukrainian Socialist Republic.

Since May 1, 1986, Morozov has been involved in the liquidation of consequences resulting from the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. He worked directly in a failure-zone for the greater part of a year. He headed the Special Design Bureau of Mathematical Machines and Systems of the Institute Cybernetics Academy of Sciences, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and organized the Special Design Office of Experts of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. These bodies organized the ministries and departments of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic concerning the situational forecasting of radiation pollution of the [[Dnipro River]] and the territory of Ukraine. For this work he was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]].

Morozov is the Chief Designer of the RADA system, a hardware/software complex for the support of decisions by public authorities at various levels used by the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (Parliament of Ukraine). It is also used by various councils at different state levels in Ukraine and in several other countries. In 1998 he and the group of developers were awarded the State Award of Ukraine for this project.

==Honors and awards==
He has many state awards and honours, including the following:
* Corresponding Member, [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]]
* [[USSR State Prize]], three times
* State Prize of the Ukraine SSR, three times
* [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]]
* [[Order of Merit (Ukraine)|Order of Merit]], Third Class

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2665">'''Battleshort''' (sometimes "battle short") is a condition in which some [[Military technology|military equipment]] can be placed so it does not shut down when circumstances would be damaging to the equipment or [[Military personnel|personnel]].  The origin of the term is to bridge or "short" the fuses of an electrical apparatus before entering combat, so that the fuse blowing will not stop the equipment from operating.

According to Allied Ordnance Publication AOP-38-3,&lt;ref name="aop38"&gt;[http://www.nato.int/structur/ac/310/pdf/aop-38-3.pdf AOP-38], Allied Ordnance Publication 38, Edition 3, ''Glossary of terms and definitions concerning the safety and suitability for service of munitions, explosives and related products'', April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[NATO]] publication, a battleshort is "The capability to bypass certain safety features in a system to ensure completion of the mission without interruption due to the safety feature." It also says, "Examples of bypassed safety features are [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] overload protection, and [[Thermal cutoff|protection against overheating]]".&lt;ref name="aop38" /&gt;

In peaceful situations one would want equipment to shut down so it is not damaged. In a [[battle]] or emergency, where the survival of the [[Watercraft|vessel]] (or other protected asset) is dependent upon the continued operation of the equipment, it is sometimes wiser to risk equipment damage than have the equipment shut down when it is needed.  For example, the electrical drives to elevate and traverse the guns of a combat warship may have "battleshort" fuses, which are simply copper bars of the correct size to fit the fuse holders, as failure to return fire in a combat situation may cause loss of the ship and crew and damaging or overheating of the electrical motors is a preferable alternative.

Battleshorts have been used in some non-combat situations as well, including the Firing Room/Mission Control spaces at NASA during the manned Apollo missions&amp;nbsp;— specifically the Moon landings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In the Shadow of the Moon: A Challenging Journey to Tranquility, 1965–1969 |first1=Francis |last1=French |first2=Colin |last2=Burgess |year=2007 |isbn=0-8032-0984-3 |series=Outward Odyssey: A People's History of Spaceflight |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y_16I8NzSjEC&amp;pg=PA406 |quote=Before we go into any critical phase in Mission Control, we always go into 'Battle Short.'

[[Image:Devon Billhook.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Gilpin 1918 pattern billhook, thick nose with handle crudely replaced]]

The '''billhook''' is a traditional cutting tool used widely in [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] for cutting smaller woody material such as shrubs and branches and is distinct from the [[sickle]]. It is very common in the wine-growing countries of Europe. Elsewhere, it either developed locally such as in China, India and Japan, or was introduced by European settlers, such as in North and South America, South Africa and Australia.

== Design ==
The blade is usually made from a medium-[[carbon steel]] in varying weights and lengths, but typically {{convert|20|to|25|cm|in}} long. Blades are straight near the handle but have an increasingly strong curve towards the end. The blade is generally sharpened only on the inside of the curve, but double-edged billhooks, or "broom hooks", also have a straight secondary edge on the back.

The blade is fixed to a wooden handle, in Europe usually made from [[Fraxinus excelsior|ash]] due to its strength and ability to deal with repeated impact.  Handles are mostly {{convert|12|to|15|cm|in}} long and may be caulked{{clarify|date=August 2017}} or round.  Longer handles are sometimes be used for heavier patterns, making the tool double-handed. The blade and handle are usually linked by a [[Tang (tools)|tang]] passing through the handle, but sometimes a socket that encloses the blade. Some styles of billhook have scales&lt;ref&gt;For an explanation of the term "scales" see [[straight razor#Parts description]].&lt;/ref&gt; of hardwood or horn fitted to the handle.

Some billhooks (for example the [[Kent]] pattern) have a single-bevelled blade, available in both right- and left-handed versions, others (such as the [[Machynlleth]] pattern) have dished blades (concave one side and convex the other), or a pronounced thickened nose (such as the [[Monmouth]] pattern).  The reasons for many of these variations are now lost.

The use of a billhook is between that of a knife and an [[axe]].  It is often used for cutting woody plants such as saplings and small branches, for [[hedge (barrier)|hedging]] and for [[snedding]] (stripping the side shoots from a branch). In France and Italy it is widely used for pruning grape vines.  The billhook is the European equivalent of tools such as [[machete]]s, [[parang (knife)|parang]]s, and [[kukri]]s.

The billhook's use as a cutting tool goes back to the [[Bronze Age]], and a few examples survive from this period&amp;mdash;for example found in the sea around Greece. [[Iron]] examples from the later [[Iron Age]] have been found in pre-Roman settlements in several English counties as well as in France, Germany where it is called "Hippe" or "Sechsle" and Switzerland where it is called "Gertel".

The tool has developed a large variety of names in different parts of Britain, including bill, hedging bill, hand bill, hook bill, billhook, billook, brishing hook and broom hook. In [[Comparison of American and British English|American English]] a billhook may sometimes be referred to as a "fascine knife".

Made on a small scale in village smithies and in larger industrial sites (e.g. [[Old Iron Works, Mells]]) the billhook is still relatively common throughout most of western Europe. During the 19th and early 20th centuries the larger manufacturers offered up to 200 or so different regional styles and shapes of blade, sometimes in a range of different sizes from {{convert|6|to|11|in|cm}} long in {{convert|0.5|in|cm}} steps. The French firm of Talabot boasted in their 1930 catalogue that they held over 3000 different patterns in their archives.

=== Principles of design ===
Billhooks would have once been made by the local [[Blacksmith|smith]] to the user's specifications but now sizes and shapes are largely standardised.  The handles are mostly rat-tail [[Tang (tools)|tang]], except the Yorkshire having such a long handle that a tang is just not practical&amp;mdash;they have a socket instead. The smaller hooks have variations in the shape of the handle: round, oval and pistol-grip.

Billhooks are almost universally made from ordinary [[Carbon steel|steel]] of a moderate [[carbon]] content.  High-carbon steel is not often used since an extremely sharp and hard edge is not necessary, and a slightly lower carbon content makes the hook easier to sharpen in the field.  Hygiene and cosmetic appearance are unimportant so more expensive [[stainless steel]] is not used.

Billhooks have a relatively thick blade since they are typically used for cutting thick and woody vegetation. The nose is sometimes also thickened to bring the [[sweet spot (sports)|sweet spot]] further forward and to optimise the chopping action. The edge of a billhook is not bevelled to a very narrow angle to avoid binding in green wood.

The hooked front of the blade is designed to prevent the edge from hitting the ground,{{clarify|date=April 2018}} which would quickly damage or blunt it. Billhooks were the tool of choice for clearing areas of brush and shrubs, since this activity requires chopping close to the ground. In German speaking countries, the billhook is known as a "Rodeaxt", which translates to "clearing axe".

A billhook may vary in shape depending from which part of the UK it originates; there are eleven main types.

=== Northern, Midland and Welsh designs (UK) ===
*[[Leicester]]/[[Warwickshire]]:&lt;br/&gt;Favoured by midlands-style hedgers, this is a one handed tool with a {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on}} handle and a {{convert|10|in|cm|adj=on}} blade. It has a curved front edge and a shorter straight edge at the back, the front edge being used for general purpose and the back edge kept extremely sharp for delicate trimming, topping off stakes and other work which will not damage the blade.
*[[Yorkshire]]:&lt;br/&gt;Used by a small percentage of Midlands-style hedgers, this is generally a two handed tool with a {{convert|14|in|cm|adj=on}} handle and {{convert|10|in|cm|adj=on}} blade, again it has the curved front and straight back edges.  In some cases the handle can be up to {{convert|36|in|cm}} long. The disadvantage of this variety of tool is its weight.
*[[Llandeilo]] and [[Carmarthenshire]]:&lt;br/&gt;Have a {{convert|9|in|cm|adj=on}} handle and a {{convert|10|in|cm|adj=on}} blade.  They lack a back edge but have a small notch at the top, known as a hedge grip, which allows hedgers to push [[pleacher]]s and [[wikt:brash|brash]] into place without using the hands.
*[[Pontypool]] and [[Monmouthshire]]:&lt;br/&gt;Have a {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on}} handle and a {{convert|10|in|cm|adj=on}} blade but lack the back edge or the hedge grip of the Llandeilo.
*[[Knighton, Powys|Knighton]]/[[Radnorshire]]:&lt;br/&gt;With similar measurements to the Pontypool/Monmouthshire style, this style has the least curvature of any hook and is almost a straight blade.
*[[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]]/[[Montgomeryshire]]:&lt;br/&gt;Has slightly more curvature than the Knighton. The top picture shows a Newtown pattern billhook.

=== Southern designs (UK) ===
The southern group of hedgers use hooks often designed for other woodland work beside hedging  They are all single-edged, and vary from moderately heavy to very light.

*[[Devon]]/[[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] Half Turn:&lt;br/&gt;Has a heavily weighted nose, a {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on}} handle and a {{convert|10|in|cm|adj=on}} blade.
*[[Bristol]]:&lt;br/&gt;Slightly lighter than the Devon with a bulge in the middle which accentuates the curve further up the hook.  It has the same measurements as the Devonshire.
*[[West Country]]:&lt;br/&gt;Lighter again than the Bristol with its much more traditional shape and identical measurements to the Devonshire.
*[[Spar-hook]]:&lt;br/&gt;Very light with a {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on}} handle and a {{convert|6|to|7|in|cm|adj=on}} blade: too light to be used for snedding of anything except the smallest of side-shoots, its main use is the splitting of spars (or spits or broaches, depending upon the region), made from hazel gads for use by thatchers in pegging down the layers of thatch
*[[Kent]]:&lt;br/&gt; Also known as brishing hook.

[[Image:Kentish billhooks 2027 3.jpg|thumbnail|right|Kentish brishing hooks.]]

=== Other hooks===
*[[Block hooks]]: with a straight or slightly convex cutting edge, they were often used in urban environments for cutting against a wooden block (similar to the back edge of a broom hook, used for trimming the head of a [[birch]] [[Besom broom|besom]] to length). Often found with a small hook at the back of the blade&amp;mdash;useful for pulling the wood towards the user. Dutch hooks commonly have a straight blade and are shown in [[Renaissance painting]]s of carpenter's shops, where they would most probably have been used for rough shaping of timber, similar to the [[side axe]].

A variety of other hooks were also made by most edge-tool makers (including pea and bean hooks, gorse or furze hooks, trimming hooks, staff hooks, slashers, pruning hooks) that are closely related to the billhook, although they may differ in shape, width or thickness of blade, length of handle etc. Another very close relation is the meat [[cleaver]]&amp;mdash;sizes and handle-fixing of these are often very similar to billhooks. In some other European countries the same name is used for both tools, and it can be difficult to identify if the tool is intended for cutting wood or animal [[bone]]s.

Usage of billhooks also varies from country to country&amp;mdash;in Sweden they were often used for cutting [[fodder]] for [[livestock]] (in the UK a gorse or furze hook would have been used); in France and Italy they were widely used for pruning vines (only recently has wine making come back to the UK), and miniature billhooks were used for harvesting grapes during the '[[Vendange tardive|vendange]]' in France; in the Netherlands they were often used in a carpenter's workshop (in the UK use of a small hand axe was more common), and they were also found in the [[Cooper (profession)|coopers']] workshops in France (known as a cochoir, and used in the making of wooden barrel hoops). In the [[Balkans]] they were used for harvesting [[maize]]. In Finland they are used to cut branches from trees and cutting down small trees (known as vesuri). Images of billhooks often appear on [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of towns and villages (particularly in [[Viticulture|winemaking]] areas of [[Alsace]], the [[Black Forest]], [[Hungary]] and Switzerland) and have been found carved into [[Boundary marker|boundary stones]] in parts of Germany and onto rock faces in Italy.

== Modern usage ==
Billhooks are currently in common use by [[Thatching|thatcher]]s, [[Coppicing|coppicers]], [[hurdles (agricultural)|hurdle]] makers, [[charcoal]] burners and often by other traditional craftsmen, farmers and woodsmen. They are also the primary tool for [[Hedge laying|hedge]]layers.

== Military use ==
In the medieval period a weapon similar to the [[halberd]] was called a [[bill (weapon)|bill or billhook]]. It consisted of a pole with a bill-like blade mounted below a spearhead, with spikes added to the back of the blade to increase the versatility of the weapon against [[cavalry]] and armour. The English in particular were known for using massed billmen rather than [[pike (weapon)|pike]]s or [[halberd]]s in the Renaissance period, notably at the [[Battle of Flodden]] in 1513, when the Scottish king [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] was felled by an arrow and bill.&lt;ref&gt;''State Papers Henry'', vol. iv part iv, (1836), 2: Ellis, Henry, ed., (1846), 164, has ''regem occisum fuisse non longius latitudine lanceae ab illo'': Hall (1809), 564.&lt;/ref&gt;

The billhook is an issued tool in some armed forces (see [[fascine knife]]). It is used for cutting brushwood for making [[fascine]]s (brushwood bundles) and [[gabions]]&amp;mdash;originally for the construction of cannon emplacements, and later for [[machine gun]] emplacements. It is also issued to the pioneer corps of most regiments. In the [[Indian Army]], it is given the name 'knife gabion'.

A non-military use as a weapon was a "pruning bill", described as the weapon used in the [[Pierre Rivière (parricide)|Pierre Rivière]] [[parricide]] case of 1835.

The Finnish [[military engineer]] NCOs have a billhook as the part of their personal gear instead of [[entrenching tool|field shovel]]. It also doubles as a sidearm. Officers have a field axe.

The '''Bowling Iron Works''' was an iron working complex established around 1780 in the district of [[East Bowling]] part of the township and manor of [[Bowling, Yorkshire|Bowling]], now in the southeast of [[Bradford]] in Yorkshire, England. The operation included mining coal and iron ore, smelting, refining, casting and forging to create finished products.

==Mineral deposits==

Iron is said to have been worked in the vicinity of Bradford in Roman times. 
The monks of [[Rievaulx Abbey]] to the east were working iron on land owned by their monastery in 1150, and forgemen are mentioned in 1358.
Surface coal was being extracted from outcrops and shallow pits by 1360, and coal mines were worked by 1502.{{sfn|Pickles|1966|p=7}}
The Bowling Ironworks were established in the 1780s to smelt and forge iron from the Black Bed ironstone deposits using coal from the Better Bed seam, both of which lay under the site.{{sfn|Cudworth|1891|p=122}}
The ironstone yields about 32% iron.{{sfn|Cudworth|1891|p=205}}
The Better Bed coal is free of sulfur, making it ideal for furnaces used in smelting, puddling and forging.
The Black Bed coal, nearer to the surface, could be sold or used for firing boilers and other purposes.{{sfn|Cudworth|1891|p=223-224}}

Mining began in Jeremiah Rawson's estate, then extended into nearby estates as the deposits became exhausted, always mining the same beds of minerals.{{sfn|Cudworth|1891|p=123}}
In 1794 the company purchased from Francis Lindley Wood (owner of [[Bolling Hall]] and Lord of the Manor) the rights to 90 acres of coal and iron stone in Hall Lane, [[Broomfields]]. In 1806 the company purchased additional mineral rights to parts of Sir Francis Lindley Wood's Bowling Hall Estate .{{sfn|Cudworth|1891|p=208}}
The rights to other land was purchased in later years, often after extensive negotiation.{{sfn|Cudworth|1891|p=209}}
In 1816 the company purchased from Sir Francis all his remaining lands and mineral rights in Bowling and in 1821 purchased from him the Lordship of the Manor.

The same seams of ironstone and coal were exploited by the [[Low Moor Iron Company]], founded in 1788, and then by the Bierley Iron Company from around 1810.{{sfn|Cudworth|1891|p=123}}

==Foundation==

The first foundry was established at Bowling around 1784 by a group of businessmen including John Sturges, an ironmaster with works at [[Wakefield]], and Richard Paley, an iron merchant of [[Leeds]].{{sfn|Cudworth|1891|p=205}}
The other partners were John Sturges junior, William Sturges and John Ewell. Ewell left the partnership in 1792.{{sfn|Cudworth|1891|p=206}}
The company took the name of John Sturges &amp; Company.{{sfn|Pickles|1966|p=10}}

Iron was brought to the foundry from Wakefield in the early years.
The first products were items for domestic use such as laundry irons, ovens, boilers, window sash weights and clock weights.{{sfn|Cudworth|1891|p=205}}
The smelting plant was established in 1788, producing pig iron that was used in the boiler plates for the first steam engine at the Low Moor works. 
As late as 1792 pig iron was delivered to Wakefield and wrought iron received in exchange.{{sfn|Cudworth|1891|p=206}}
In 1804 the partnership was extended, bringing in John Green Paley, George Paley, Thomas Mason and the Reverend John Simons.{{sfn|Cudworth|1891|p=208}}

==History==
[[File:Bowling Iron Company 1861 b.jpg|thumb|A part of the ironworks in 1861]]
The Bowling works were selling large quantities of guns, shot and shells to the British government before 1790. Cast iron was used for guns before the invention of wrought iron, and the cast iron guns were subject to rigorous production controls and quality tests.{{sfn|Cudworth|1891|p=224}}
On 27 July 1796 the partners signed an agreement with [[Matthew Boulton]] and [[James Watt]] to pay royalties on the two steam engines in use at the works, and to be allowed to make additional steam engines at the works, paying royalties.{{sfn|Cudworth|1891|p=227}}
When Sir [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]] invented wrought-iron guns, some of the first coils he used were Bowling iron.{{sfn|Cudworth|1891|p=224-225}} 
Bowling iron, or Best Yorkshire, became well known around the world.{{sfn|Cudworth|1891|p=123}}

[[Steam hammer]]s were installed at the Bowling Ironworks where the steam cylinder was bolted to the back of the hammer, 
thus reducing the height of the machine.{{sfn|Artizan Club (Great Britain)|1868|p=301}}
These were designed by John Charles Pearce, who took out a patent for his steam hammer design several years before [[James Nasmyth]]'s patent expired.{{sfn|Cudworth|1891|p=234}}
On 14 November 1848 a new partnership was created with the name of Bowling Iron Co., confirmed by act of parliament in August 1849. 
The company was incorporated and registered in 1870.{{sfn|Pickles|1966|p=10}}

[[File:Industry during the First World War- Bradford Q28530.jpg|thumb|A female worker demonstrates an elevating device for barrels at the Bowling Iron Works, Bradford, in November 1918.]]
An 1891 description said the ironworks lay in,
{{blockquote|a sort of deep horseshoe valley, the banks which surround it consisting chiefly of shale and cinders, the accumulations of a century's workings. The whole area, enclosed by a high stone wall, is somewhat more than a mile and a half round. Looking from the counting-house at the entrance, on the right is a large waste space, with the steaming lake and cinder hills behind. At night, when live scoria and ashes glow from the sides of the latter, and the lake is lighted up by vivid and fitful gleams emitted from the blast furnaces, the scene is strange and weird-like ... one might almost fancy himself in immediate proximity to an active volcano.{{sfn|Cudworth|1891|p=222}} }}

The plant at that time included blast furnaces and refineries used in the first stages of iron manufacture, puddling and ball furnaces with high brick or iron chimneys, a shed housing the steam hammers, steelworks, a large machine shop, boiler works, a large foundry and other workshops and buildings. A narrow gauge railway was used to move material within the works, and a line to the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] was used to ship the products.{{sfn|Cudworth|1891|p=223}}
A network of tramways brought minerals from the pits to the works, with wagons pulled by wire ropes powered by stationary engines.{{sfn|Cudworth|1891|p=224}}
Four large pumps were being used to keep the mines dry, with some of the water used in the ironworks.{{sfn|Cudworth|1891|p=123}}

The Bowling Iron Company went into liquidation in 1898.{{sfn|Richardson|1976|p=73}}
In 1903 the company was reorganized as The Bowling Iron Company. It was liquidated in 1921.{{sfn|Pickles|1966|p=11}}

==Conditions==

By 1840 Bradford was known for having some of the most smoke-filled air in Britain.
As early as 1803 an act had stated that, "Engine chimneys are to be erected of sufficient height as not to create a nuisance by the emission of smoke. All owners of engines etc. are to construct fireplaces thereof in such a manner as most effectually to destroy and consume the smoke arising therefrom."  However, little was done to enforce the laws. 
There was a general feeling that the factories provided work, so should not be pushed too hard to reduce pollution.{{sfn|Richardson|1986|pp=28-34}}
An 1841 account said, "The condition of Bradford is dreadful. Lowmoor iron-forges most extensively spread their suffocating exhalations on the one side ... On the other side, Bowling Iron ''Hell'' (for it is one truly) casts a still denser atmosphere and sulphurous stench..."{{sfn|Granville|1841|p=407}}
The Bowling Iron Company was fined on 12 December 1874, but only for £5 with £9. 10s. costs for ten offences.
The population suffered high levels of respiratory diseases, peaking in 1890 during an influenza epidemic.{{sfn|Richardson|1986|pp=28-34}}

The method of paying the men led them into temptation of intemperance and extravagance:{{sfn|On the Operation of the Act ... 1847|p=26}}
According to H. Hartopp, manager of the Bowling Works,
{{blockquote|All our colliers and miners are in our direct employ, without the intervention of contractors. They appoint one of their number, the head man in the pit, to come to the office every week to receive the money. It is given to him in sovereigns and silver, perhaps 20''l''. or 30''l''.. There is no need, whatever, that they should go to a public house to divide it, but I believe their practice, too often, is to do so. I have been anxious to put an end to it, by providing them with a convenient room near the collieries, where practicable; but they are scattered and distant.{{sfn|On the Operation of the Act ... 1847|p=25}} }}

[[File:St John's Church, Wakefield Road, Bowling, Bradford - geograph.org.uk - 669688.jpg|thumb|St John's Church, Wakefield Road, Bowling, Bradford, built in 1842 at the expense of the Bowling Iron Company]]
The company built St. John's Church, Bowling, at its own expense of ₤5,000. The church was consecrated on 8 February 1842.
It is built in the Lancet-Gothic style and is {{convert|111|by|60|ft}} in size, with a {{convert|130|ft}} spire.
The church was the first to be built in England of iron and stone, with only the rafters made of wood.{{sfn|Cudworth|1891|p=274}}
In April 1847 St. John's school in Bowling was visited. The Bowling Iron company had erected the building, but did not contribute much to its expenses. There were on average 150 children at the school, of whom 12 were factory workers.
Only seven children had reached aged 13. The schoolroom had poor lighting and ventilation, and there was no mistress to instruct the older children.{{sfn|Committee on Education|1848|p=194}}

In the mines, hurrier-boys would drag carriages along tracks to the miners,
then drag the filled carriages back to the pit shaft and hook them to a chain so they could be pulled up.{{sfn|Follen|Brown|Abbot|1855|p=134}}
An 1843 inquiry into child labor said of Jabez Scott, aged fifteen, a worker at the Bowling Iron Works: "Work is very hard; sleeps well sometimes, sometimes is very ill tired and cannot sleep so weel [sic]."{{sfn|Commissioners for Inquiring into the Employment and Condition of Children in Mines and Manufactories|1843|p=42}}
An 1847 report noted that there was considerable temptation to employ boys in the mines when they were below the legal age, then ten years of age.
"Managers, &amp;c., of mines, complain that the work required of boys in seams of coal not more than 18 inches to two feet thick, is done at a disadvantage, unless they are brought to it from their earliest years."{{sfn|On the Operation of the Act ... 1847|p=25}}

In 1875 there was an explosion in the Bowling Iron Company's Crosses Pit mine, where 40 men and boys were working. Four ironstone getters and hurriers were killed, and others injured. The cause seems to have been accidental ignition of gunpowder being used to break up large pieces of scale that contained the ironstone.{{sfn|House of Commons|1876|p=298}}
A select committee of the House of Commons in 1877 heard that in West Yorkshire, including the Bowling Iron Works, the colliers employed boys as assistants, rather the boys being employed by the company, although the boys had their names entered and were subject to the colliery rules. At that time Bowling employed about 2,000 workmen in the collieries, and it was estimated that about two men died each year. Accident rates were higher in the iron works, despite employment being lower.{{sfn|House of Commons|1877|p=46}}
Boys were employed in various capacities in the ironworks, such as wheeling hot lumps of puddled iron to the hammers.{{sfn|Chambers|Chambers|1867|p=222}}

'''CALS''' ('''C'''ontinuous '''A'''cquisition and '''L'''ife-cycle '''S'''upport)  is a [[United States Department of Defense]] initiative for electronically capturing military documentation and linking related information. 

The initiative has developed a number of standard specifications
(protocols) for the exchange of electronic data with commercial suppliers. These standards are often referred to as simply "CALS". CALS standards have been adopted by several other allied nations. 

The CALS initiative has endorsed [[IGES]] and [[ISO 10303|STEP]] as formats for digital data. 

CALS includes standards for electronic data interchange, electronic technical documentation, and guidelines for process improvement. 

* The [[CALS Table Model]] is a DTD standard for representing tables in SGML/XML. (see also [[DocBook]])
* The [[CALS Raster file format]] was developed in the mid-1980s to standardize on graphics data interchange for electronic publishing for the federal government.

CALS was known formerly as ''Computer-aided Acquisition and Logistic Support''.

In [[oil and gas]] production a '''choke manifold''' is used to lower the pressure from the [[well head]]. It consist of a set of high pressure [[valve]]s and at least two [[Choke valve|chokes]]. These chokes can be fixed or adjustable or a mix of both. The redundancy is needed so that if one choke has to be taken out of service, the flow can be directed through another one.   By lowering pressure the retrieved gases can be flared off on site.

A '''cider mill''' is the location and equipment used to crush [[apple|apples]] into [[apple juice]] for use in making [[apple cider]], [[hard cider]], [[applejack (beverage)|applejack]], [[Apfelwein|apple wine]], [[pectin]] and other products derived from apples. More specifically, it refers to a device used to crush or grind apples as part of the overall juice production.

The mills used to manufacture, [[Fermentation (food)|ferment]], store, and ship juice products are usually located near apple [[orchard]]s. Historically, the types of structure and machinery have varied greatly — including horse powered, water driven, and machine operated mills. The presses can be fixed or portable.

Cider mills were subject to legal proceedings in New York state in the 1800s over whether they were "fixed to [[Customary freehold|freehold]]s"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0xU9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA501&amp;dq=cider+mill&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=cider%20mill&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; and other cases addressing legal designation as to what kind of property a cider mill is.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rvsaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=cider+mill&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=cider%20mill&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
Cider-making takes place in numerous countries and regions. As with the cider itself, the various techniques used in milling and pressing the apples vary with each cider-making tradition. In most traditions, cider milling traditionally takes place in two stages: first, milling or grinding the apples into a pulpy mass called pulp, and a second stage, pressing the pulp to release the juice or "must". The remaining solids after juice extraction is "[[pomace]]" or "pommage".

Some mills provide custom pressing of a farmer's apples.  In this way, apple varieties can be blended to make a cider of mixed juice types, for instance, a combination of sweet and aromatic juices. Various types of apple are recommended for cidering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Proulx|first1=Annie|last2=Nichols|first2=Lew|title=Making, Using &amp; Enjoying Sweet &amp; Hard Cider|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c-Bmu8i-cp0C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=cider+mill&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=cider%20mill&amp;f=false|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alcoholic cider can also be produced and is known as [[hard cider]] or [[applejack (beverage)|applejack]]. Cider is stored and fermented in wooden barrels, [[carboy|carboys]], stainless tanks, or glass jugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Proulx|first1=Annie|last2=Nichols|first2=Lew|title=Making, Using &amp; Enjoying Sweet &amp; Hard Cider|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c-Bmu8i-cp0C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=cider+mill&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=cider%20mill&amp;f=false|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 19th Century New England, apple farmers paid a mill owner a fee to crush apples into juice. A typical cider mill would look like many other small barns and sheds, with a set of large doors in the center of the longer side.  Most cider mills were 20-30' long by 20-25' in width.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osv.org/explore_learn/document_viewer.php?DocID=1010{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Includes illustrations of old cider mills.&lt;/ref&gt; At Old Sturbridge Village in Massachusetts, 19th Century cider mill equipment is still used to make cider. In ''[[The Marble Faun]]'', author [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] contrasted the wine-making in Italy with the cider-making process of "New England vintages, where the big piles of golden and rosy apples lie under the orchard trees, in the mild, autumnal sunshine; and the creaking cider-mill, set in motion by a circumgyratory horse, is all a-gush with the luscious juice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hawthorne|first1=Nathaniel|title=The Marble Faun|page=Chapter Thirty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
===Milling===
Milling, grinding, or crushing can take various forms, depending on the quantity of apples to be crushed and the mode of power available.

The earliest and most basic form of cider mill consists of little more than an enclosed area where apples are pounded by large wooden pestles.&lt;ref name="Bull 1886 42"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bull|first=Henry Graves|title=The Apple &amp; Pear as Vintage Fruits|year=1886|publisher=Jakeman &amp; Carver|location=Hereford, England|pages=42|url=https://archive.org/details/applepearasvinta00bull}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, Jersey, and northern France, the traditional form was a "horse-mill" or "stone mill". A horse-mill consists of a circular trough made of stone, in which is set either one or two large stone wheels called "runners".&lt;ref name= Cyder-mill /&gt; At the center is a pivot point or "nut".&lt;ref name= Cyder-mill /&gt; A horse is harnessed to the outside of the wheel, and driven in a circle, slowly grinding the apples to a pulpy mass called pommage.&lt;ref name= Cyder-mill /&gt; Through the early 19th century, this was the dominant form in England.&lt;ref name = Cyder-mill&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=1808 |title = CYDER-MILL|volume=10 |encyclopedia= [[Rees's Cyclopædia]]|publisher= Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme &amp; Brown|location= London|id= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 20th century in Britain, however, the stone mills had largely fallen out of fashion, increasingly replaced by the roller mills, though they continued to be the primary form in France.&lt;ref name="1903 Report mills" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alwood on horse mills"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alwood|first=William B.|title=A Study of Cider Making|year=1903|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=51-52,55|url=https://archive.org/details/studyofcidermaki00willrich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the stone mill had been introduced to and used by the American Colonists, its usage was not well recorded, and by the end of the 19th century it was essentially unknown in the United States.&lt;ref name="Alwood on horse mills" /&gt;

In Germany, apples were traditionally grated by hand rather than crushed.&lt;ref name="Alwood German traditional"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alwood|first=William B.|title=A Study of Cider Making|year=1903|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture|location=Washington, D.C.|page=54-55|url=https://archive.org/details/studyofcidermaki00willrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later innovation was the toothed roller-mill. These mills use toothed cylinders made of stone or metal to grind the apples into pomace.&lt;ref name="1903 Report mills" /&gt; Such mills are portable, and produce a pomace that is finer than that of the large horse-mills.&lt;ref name=Cyder-mill /&gt;&lt;ref name="1903 Report mills"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lloyd|first=F.J.|title=Report on the Results of Investigations into Cider-Making: 1893-1902|year=1903|publisher=Board of Agriculture and Fisheries|location=London|pages=31-32|url=https://archive.org/details/reportonresultso00grearich}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first introduced to England in 1689 by agriculturalist [[John Worlidge]], who adapted it from the sugar-cane crushers used in the West Indies.&lt;ref name="Bull 1886 43"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bull|first=Henry Graves|title=The Apple &amp; Pear as Vintage Fruits|year=1886|publisher=Jakeman &amp; Carver|location=Hereford, England|pages=43|url=https://archive.org/details/applepearasvinta00bull}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet as of the beginning of the 19th-century, such mills could not handle the same quantity in bulk as the horse-driven mills.&lt;ref name=Cyder-mill /&gt;

===Pressing===
After the apples have been ground into pomace, the pomace must be squeezed to extract the juice. This is done in a device called a cider press, which like the cider mill, takes various forms.&lt;ref name = Cyder-Press&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=1808 |title = CYDER-PRESS|volume=10 |encyclopedia= [[Rees's Cyclopædia]]|publisher= Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme &amp; Brown|location= London|id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One form is a large horse-operated lever press or screw press. This method was common in Britain, Jersey, and northern France, as well as the United States. This form involves either of two methods to hold the loose pomace in place as it is pressed. The first is to use alternating layers of straw and pomace, creating a mixture known as "cheese". The other is to wrap the pomace in cloth. The German tradition used smaller, hand-operated lever presses in the same manner.&lt;ref name="Alwood German traditional" /&gt;

An alternate form is the "hand press" (sometimes called a "Continental Press" in England), a small screw-press operated by hand. These presses dispense with the various methods of covering the pomace, and instead use a container made of wooden staves.

By the turn of the 20th century, hydraulic presses had begun to be introduced.&lt;ref name="1903 Report presses"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lloyd|first=F.J.|title=Report on the Results of Investigations into Cider-Making: 1893-1902|year=1903|publisher=Board of Agriculture and Fisheries|location=London|pages=34-39|url=https://archive.org/details/reportonresultso00grearich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the juices had been extracted, the leftover pressings are variously known as "math", "cake", "powz", "mure" or simply "[[pommage]]".&lt;ref name="Bull 1886 46"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bull|first=Henry Graves|title=The Apple &amp; Pear as Vintage Fruits|year=1886|publisher=Jakeman &amp; Carver|location=Hereford, England|pages=46|url=https://archive.org/details/applepearasvinta00bull}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It might either be watered and pressed again to produce a weak cider known as [[ciderkin]], or when still fresh, used as animal feed.&lt;ref name="Bull 1886 46" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1903 Report Leftover"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lloyd|first=F.J.|title=Report on the Results of Investigations into Cider-Making: 1893-1902|year=1903|publisher=Board of Agriculture and Fisheries|location=London|pages=41-42|url=https://archive.org/details/reportonresultso00grearich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computer Professionals' Union''' ('''CPU''' or '''CP-Union''') is a mass organization of [[information and communications technology]] (ICT) professionals, practitioners, and workers in the [[Philippines]]. It is registered in the Philippines as a non-stock, non-profit, non-government organization that promotes activist ICT principles and organize ICT professionals to provide ICT services to [[Filipino people]].&lt;ref name=whatCPU /&gt;&lt;ref name=aboutCPU&gt;{{cite web|title=About Computer Professionals' Union|url=http://www.cp-union.com/article/2011/11/13/about-computer-professionals-union|publisher=Computer Professionals' Union|accessdate=8 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128022733/http://www.cp-union.com/article/2011/11/13/about-computer-professionals-union|archivedate=28 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their office is located at [[Quezon City]] and their current National Coordinator is Rick Bahague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Software Freedom Day 2012: Going Green with the Free and Open Source Community|url=http://www.cp-union.com/article/2012/09/06/software-freedom-day-2012-going-green-free-and-open-source-community|accessdate=8 January 2013|date=6 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130071130/http://www.cp-union.com/article/2012/09/06/software-freedom-day-2012-going-green-free-and-open-source-community|archivedate=30 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The organization was started in 2001 by a group of information communications technology practitioners. They officially registered under the Philippine [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]] in 2008 as a non-profit and non-stock corporation.

==Activism==

[[File:2011WikimediaPhilippineTour035.JPG|thumb|Meeting of Wikimedia Foundation, Wikimedia Philippines, and Computer Professionals' Union at the CPU office in Quezon City. Third from the left is National Director Rick Bahague, and first from the right is Deputy National Director Gladys Regalado]]

CPU is notable for its belief that the ICT sector in the Philippines is controlled and dominated by foreign [[monopoly]] capitalists, which stunts the growth and development of Filipino technology and economy.&lt;ref name=aboutCPU /&gt; CPU supports a truly nationalist and democratic government that will advance and promote a people's ICT.&lt;ref name=aboutCPU /&gt; CPU believes that, like farmers, workers, and other sectors in the country, ICT workers also need to organize in order to advance their specific needs.&lt;ref name=whatCPU&gt;{{cite web|title=What is CPU?|url=http://www.cp-union.com/project/what-cpu|accessdate=8 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129233519/http://www.cp-union.com/project/what-cpu|archivedate=29 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year before the [[Philippine general election, 2010|2010 Philippine general elections]], CPU warns sophisticated cheating with the Philippines' first automated polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Computer Experts Warn of Sophisticated Dagdag Bawas with Automated Polls|url=http://bulatlat.com/main/2009/04/04/computer-experts-warn-of-sophisticated-dagdag-bawas-with-automated-polls/|publisher=Bulatlat|accessdate=8 January 2013|author=Ronalyn V. Olea|date=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had hosted a national conference in [[University of the Philippines]] in Diliman, Quezon City to discuss the automated election system (AES).&lt;ref name=elections&gt;{{cite news|title=IT groups to meet to discuss automated polls|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/157863/news/nation/it-groups-to-meet-to-discuss-automated-polls|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=[[GMA News]]|date=21 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rick Bahague, CPU National Coordinator said that the goal of the conference was to gather experiences and best practices in technologies relevant to AES. He further said that software bugs in the AES system can affect machines to be used in the elections and the automated election system is vulnerable to manipulation from inside or outside attacks.&lt;ref name=elections /&gt;

During the height of the [[Protests against SOPA and PIPA|protests]] against [[Stop Online Piracy Act|Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA)]] and [[PROTECT IP Act|PROTECT IP Act (PIPA)]] in January 2012, CPU expressed strong opposition to it.&lt;ref name=sopapipa&gt;{{cite web|title=Computer Professionals’ Union opposes SOPA and PIPA Act|url=http://davaotoday.com/main/2012/01/19/computer-professionals-union-opposes-sopa-and-pipa-act/|publisher=Davao Today|accessdate=8 January 2013|date=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They said that SOPA and PIPA that were being pushed in the [[United States Congress]] attack free speech and expression and would have impacts to human rights groups, bloggers, advocacy groups and all content creators in the web. They believed that any website can be closed without due process.&lt;ref name=sopapipa /&gt;

In September 2012, [[Benigno Aquino III|Philippine President Aquino]] signed the [[Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012]] enacted by [[15th Congress of the Philippines]]. The law had led numerous sectors including Computer Professionals' Union to protest it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why we protest the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012?

Saligumba}}&lt;/ref&gt; They further said that Section 19 of the law has become far worse than SOPA and PIPA.&lt;ref name=cybercrime /&gt;

==Organization tenets==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}
In advancing CPU's advocacy, these are their principles:

*Free Information: CPU believes that information in all forms is the collective knowledge and experience of humankind. It believes that no one owns information; therefore, anyone can use and develop it for the benefit of mankind and development of society.
*Privacy of Information: Computers and telecommunications networks have brought consumers many conveniences. But, the organization alleges, advanced technologies pose serious threats to privacy. CPU believes that information about us, our families, where we live, where we work, people we call, sites we surf, stores we shop in, etc., should be kept private.
*Open Source: CPU fully supports the [[Open-source software|open source]] initiative. One of the group's aims is to convince fellow technology practitioners and the government to abandon the use of software by companies such as [[Microsoft]] and [[Oracle Corporation]].
*Right to organize: CPU members believe that as workers, they have the right to form [[labor union]]s and associations that will collectively fight for workers' rights and welfare.
*Use of Appropriate Technology: CPU believes that technology alone cannot solve political and social problems. It aims to dispel myths about the infallibility of technological systems and neutrality of science and technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3689">The '''Darrieus–Landau instability''' is an intrinsic flame instability that occurs in [[premixed flame]]s due to the thermal expansion of the gas produced by the [[combustion]] process. It was predicted independently by [[Georges Jean Marie Darrieus]] and [[Lev Landau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Darrieus, G.|title=Propagation d'un front de flamme|journal=La Technique Moderne and Congrés de Mécanique Appliquée Paris|year=1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Landau, L. D.|title=On the theory of slow combustion|journal=Acta Physicochim.|year=1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The instability analysis behind the Darrieus–Landau instability considers a planar, premixed [[flame]] front subjected to very small perturbations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316162453|title=Combustion Waves and Fronts in Flows|last=Clavin|first=Paul|last2=Searby|first2=Geoff|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781316162453|location=Cambridge|language=en|doi=10.1017/cbo9781316162453}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is useful to think of this arrangement as one in which the unperturbed flame is stationary, with the reactants (fuel and oxidizer) directed towards the flame and perpendicular to it with a velocity u1, and the burnt gases leaving the flame also in a perpendicular way but with velocity u2. The analysis assumes that the flow is an [[incompressible flow]], and that the perturbations are governed by the linearized [[Euler equations]] and, thus, are inviscid.  With these considerations, the main result of this analysis is that, if the density of the burnt [[gases]] is less than that of the reactants, which is the case in practice due to the thermal expansion of the gas produced by the combustion process, the flame front is unstable to perturbations of any [[wavelength]]. Another result is that the rate of growth of the perturbations is inversely proportional to their wavelength; thus small flame wrinkles (but larger than the characteristic flame thickness) grow faster than larger ones.  In practice, however, diffusive and buoyancy effects that are not taken into account by the analysis of Darrieus and Landau may have a stabilizing effect.&lt;ref&gt;Markstein, G. H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7978">'''Dense Inert Metal Explosive''' ('''DIME''') is an experimental type of [[explosive material|explosive]] that has a relatively small but effective [[blast radius]].  It is manufactured by producing a homogeneous mixture of an explosive material (such as [[phlegmatized]] [[HMX]] or [[RDX]]) and small particles of a chemically inert material such as [[tungsten]].  It is intended to limit the distance at which the explosion causes damage, to avoid [[collateral damage]] in warfare.

The phrase ''[[Chemically inert|inert]] metal'' refers to a metal that is not chemically active and therefore not part of the chemical reaction that causes the explosion, as opposed to some metals, such as [[aluminium]], that do form part of the chemical reaction—e.g. in [[Tritonal]].

An emerging criticism of DIME weapons is that they might turn out to have strong biological effects in those who are hit by the micro-[[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] from these types of explosives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090122061721/http://qwstnevrythg.com/archives/5248 DIME: A New Horror] at Question Everything, January 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

DIME mixtures have been studied for some time,&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Paul W. ''Explosives Engineering''. New York: Wiley-VCH, 1996. {{ISBN|0-471-18636-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but apparently only began to be adopted for weapons after the year 2000.

==Method of operation==
DIME weapons consist of a [[carbon fiber]] casing filled with a mixture of explosive and very dense microshrapnel, consisting of very small particles (1–2&amp;nbsp;mm) or powder of a heavy metal. To date, [[tungsten]] alloy (heavy metal tungsten alloy, or HMTA) composed of tungsten and other metals such as [[cobalt]] and [[nickel]] or [[iron]] has been the preferred material for the dense microshrapnel or powder.

Two common HMTA alloys are:

* rWNiCo: tungsten (91–93%), nickel (3–5%) and cobalt (2–4%)
* rWNiFe: tungsten (91–93%), nickel (3–5%) and iron (2–4%)

Upon detonation of the explosive, the casing disintegrates into extremely small particles, as opposed to larger pieces of [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] which results from the fragmentation of a metal [[Shell (projectile)|shell]] casing. The HMTA powder acts like micro-shrapnel which is very lethal at close range (about {{cvt|4|m|disp=or}}), but loses momentum very quickly due to air resistance, coming to a halt within approximately 40 times the diameter of the charge. This increases the probability of killing people within a few meters of the explosion while reducing the probability of causing death and injuries or damage farther away. Survivors close to the lethal zone may still have their limbs amputated by the HMTA microshrapnel, which can slice through soft tissue and bone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/dime.htm Dense Inert Metal Explosive (DIME)] at GlobalSecurity.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toxic/carcinogenic effects==
The [[carcinogen]]ic effects of heavy metal [[tungsten]] alloys (HMTA) (along with [[depleted uranium]] [DU]) have been studied by the U.S. Armed Forces since at least the year 2000.  These alloys were found to cause [[neoplastic]] transformations of human [[osteoblast]] cells.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/22/1/115 Neoplastic transformation of human osteoblast cells to the tumorigenic phenotype by heavy metal–tungsten alloy particles: induction of genotoxic effects]". ''Carcinogenesis'', Vol. 22, No. 1, 115–125, January 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent U.S. Department of Health and Human Services study, from 2005, has found that HMTA shrapnel rapidly induces [[rhabdomyosarcoma]] in laboratory rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmc = 1257598|year = 2005|last1 = Kalinich|first1 = J. F.|title = Embedded Weapons-Grade Tungsten Alloy Shrapnel Rapidly Induces Metastatic High-Grade Rhabdomyosarcomas in F344 Rats|journal = Environmental Health Perspectives|volume = 113|issue = 6|pages = 729–734|last2 = Emond|first2 = C.

E.|pmid = 15929896|doi = 10.1289/ehp.7791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tungsten alloy carcinogenicity may be most closely related to the [[nickel]] content of the alloys used in weapons to date; however, pure tungsten and [[tungsten trioxide]] are also suspected of carcinogenic and other toxic properties, and have been shown to have such effects in animal studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/htdocs/Chem_Background/ExSumPdf/tungsten.pdf Tungsten and Selected Tungsten Compounds - Review of Toxicological Literature]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a group of Italian scientists affiliated with the New Weapons Research Committee (NWRC) [[watchdog group]] pronounced DIME wounds "untreatable" because the powdered tungsten they dispense cannot be removed surgically.&lt;ref name=Marquand_20090114&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0114/p07s01-wome.html "Gaza: Israel under fire for alleged white phosphorus use", ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', January 14, 2009, by Robert Marquand and Nicholas Blanford]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in battle==
In July/August 2006, doctors in the [[Gaza Strip]] reported unusual wounds caused by [[Israel Defense Forces]] attacks against Palestinians, claiming that they were from previously unknown weapons. A lab analysis of the metals found in the victims' bodies was reportedly "compatible with the hypothesis" that DIME weapons were involved. Israel denied possessing or using such weapons, and an Israeli military expert said that the wounds were consistent with ordinary explosives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/oct/17/israel1 ''Gaza doctors say patients suffering mystery injuries after Israeli attacks'']. The Guardian, 17 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Mads Gilbert]] and Dr. [[Erik Fosse]], working on wounded from the [[2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict]], reported injuries that they believed were caused by some new type of weapon used by Israel, which they speculated were DIME bombs.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.democracynow.org/2009/1/14/white_phosphorous_and_dense_inert_metal Is Israel Using Banned and Experimental Munitions in Gaza?]", ''[[Democracy Now!]]''.

A '''draw sheet''' is a small [[bed sheet]] placed crosswise over the middle of the bottom sheet of a [[mattress]] to cover the area between the person's upper back and thighs, often used by [[medical professional]]s to move [[patient]]s. It can be made of plastic, rubber, or cotton, and is about half the size of a regular sheet. It can be used in place of a [[mattress pad]] if a rubber mattress is used. The draw sheet may or may not be tucked into the sides of the bed. When a draw sheet is used to move patients, it is sometimes known as a lift sheet. Nursing manuals recommend that, when a plastic or rubber draw sheet is used, a cotton drawsheet is placed over it. If a folded sheet is used as a draw sheet, the folded edge of the sheet is positioned at the person's upper body.

'''Energy harvesting''' (also known as '''power harvesting''' or '''energy scavenging''' or '''ambient power''') is the process by which [[energy]] is derived from external sources (e.g., [[solar power]], [[thermal energy]], [[wind energy]], [[Osmotic power|salinity gradients]], and [[kinetic energy]], also known as '''ambient energy'''), captured, and stored for small, wireless autonomous devices, like those used in [[Wearable computer|wearable electronics]] and wireless [[sensor network]]s&lt;ref&gt; Guler U, Sendi M.S.E, Ghovanloo, M, ``[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8053188/A dual-mode passive rectifier for wide-range input power flow]'',  IEEE 60th International Midwest Symposium on  Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS), Aug. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Energy harvesters provide a very small amount of power for low-energy electronics. While the input fuel to some large-scale generation costs resources (oil, coal, etc.), the energy source for energy harvesters is present as ambient background. For example, temperature gradients exist from the operation of a combustion engine and in urban areas, there is a large amount of electromagnetic energy in the environment because of radio and television broadcasting.

One of the earliest applications of ambient power collected from ambient [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EMR) is the [[crystal radio]].

The principles of energy harvesting from ambient EMR can be demonstrated with basic components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rexresearch.com/tate/tate.htm#apm |title=The Amazing Ambient Power Module |publisher=Ambient Research |access-date=16 January 2008 |first=Joeseph |last=Tate |date=1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
Energy harvesting devices converting ambient energy into electrical energy have attracted much interest in both the military and commercial sectors. Some systems convert motion, such as that of ocean waves, into electricity to be used by oceanographic monitoring sensors for autonomous operation. Future applications may include high power output devices (or arrays of such devices) deployed at remote locations to serve as reliable power stations for large systems. Another application is in wearable electronics, where energy harvesting devices can power or recharge cellphones, mobile computers, radio communication equipment, etc. All of these devices must be sufficiently robust to endure long-term exposure to hostile environments and have a broad range of dynamic sensitivity to exploit the entire spectrum of wave motions.

===Accumulating energy===
Energy can also be harvested to power small autonomous sensors such as those developed using [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS technology]]. These systems are often very small and require little power, but their applications are limited by the reliance on battery power.  Scavenging energy from ambient vibrations, wind, heat or light could enable smart sensors to be functional indefinitely. Several academic and commercial groups have been involved in the analysis and development of vibration-powered energy harvesting technology, including the Control and Power Group and Optical and Semiconductor Devices Group at [[Imperial College London]], [[IMEC]] and the partnering Holst Centr,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.imec.be/ufc/file2/imec_sites/floosen/7be71c7cb514f2be8c963ae242994a9a/pu/Human___white_paper_JP042008.pdf Holst Centre Human++ Program]&lt;/ref&gt; AdaptivEnergy, LLC, ARVENI, [[MIT]] Boston, Victoria University of Wellington,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecs.victoria.ac.nz/Groups/NERG/OpenResearchProjects Wireless Sensor Networks Powered by Ambient Energy Harvesting (WSN-HEAP)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgia Tech]], [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], [[Southampton University]], [[University of Bristol]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2009/6725.html Pickin’ up good vibrations to produce green electricity]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.mesl.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ Micro Energy System Lab at The University of Tokyo], [[Nanyang Technological University]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://research-tlh.appspot.com Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting Research at NTU]&lt;/ref&gt; PMG Perpetuum, [http://www.revibeenergy.com ReVibe Energy], [[Vestfold University College]], [[National University of Singapore]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/emdl/yenkheng.htm Some Energy Harvesting Research @NUS]&lt;/ref&gt; NiPS Laboratory at the University of Perugia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nipslab.org/ Noise in Physical Systems Laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Columbia University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://enhants.ee.columbia.edu/ EnHANTs project at Columbia University]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona]] and USN &amp; Renewable Energy Lab at the University of Ulsan (Ulsan, South Korea). The [[National Science Foundation]] also supports an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center led by [[Virginia Tech]] and [[The University of Texas at Dallas]] called the Center for Energy Harvesting Materials and Systems.

Typical power densities available from energy harvesting devices are highly dependent upon the specific application (affecting the generator's size) and the design itself of the harvesting generator.  In general, for motion powered devices, typical values are a few µW/cm³ for human body powered applications and hundreds of µW/cm³ for generators powered from machinery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/84/28958/01303621.pdf "Architectures for Vibration-Driven Micropower Generators, P. D. Mitcheson, T. C. Green, E. M. Yeatman, A. S. Holmes"]&lt;/ref&gt; Most energy scavenging devices for wearable electronics generate very little power.&lt;ref&gt;ik, batterij by Erick Vermeulen, NatuurWetenschap &amp; Techniek January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=February 2011}}

===Storage of power===
In general, energy can be stored in a [[capacitor]], [[super capacitor]], or [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. Capacitors are used when the application needs to provide huge energy spikes. Batteries leak less energy and are therefore used when the device needs to provide a steady flow of energy. Compared to batteries, super capacitors have virtually unlimited charge-discharge cycles and can therefore operate forever enabling a maintenance-free operation in IoT and wireless sensor   devices &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Munir|first=Bilal |author2=Vladimir Dyo |title=On the Impact of Mobility on Battery-Less RF Energy Harvesting System Performance|journal=Sensors|year=2018|volume=18|issue=11|pages=3597 |doi=10.3390/s18113597|pmid=30360501 |url=https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/18/11/3597/htm|accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
.

===Use of the power===
Current interest in low power energy harvesting is for independent sensor networks. In these applications an energy harvesting scheme puts power stored into a capacitor then boosted/regulated to a second storage capacitor or battery for the use in the [[microprocessor]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linear.com/docs/29710 Energy Harvester Produces Power from Local Environment, Eliminating Batteries in Wireless Sensors]&lt;/ref&gt; or in the data transmission.&lt;ref name="ieeexplore.ieee.org"&gt;X. Kang et. al ``[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7115936/ Full-Duplex Wireless-Powered Communication Network With Energy Causality],'' in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, vol.14, no.10, pp.5539-5551, Oct. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The power is usually used in a [[sensor]] application and the data stored or is [[transmitter|transmitted]] possibly through a wireless method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idtechex.com/research/reports/wireless-power-transmission-for-consumer-electronics-and-electric-vehicles-2012-2022-000281.asp Wireless Power Transmission for Consumer Electronics and Electric Vehicles 2012-2022]. IDTechEx. Retrieved on 2013-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==
The history of energy harvesting dates back to the windmill and the waterwheel. People have searched for ways to store the energy from heat and vibrations for many decades. One driving force behind the search for new energy harvesting devices is the desire to power sensor networks and mobile devices without batteries. Energy harvesting is also motivated by a desire to address the issue of climate change and global warming.

==Devices==

There are many small-scale energy sources that generally cannot be scaled up to industrial size:
* Some [[wristwatch]]es are powered by kinetic energy (called [[automatic watch]]es), in this case movement of the arm is used. The arm movement causes winding of its [[mainspring]]. A newer design introduced by [[Seiko]] ("Kinetic") uses movement of a magnet in the electromagnetic generator instead to power the quartz movement. The motion provides a rate of change of flux, which results in some induced [[Electromotive force|emf]] on the coils. The concept is related to [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's Law]].
* [[Photovoltaics]] is a method of generating electrical power by converting solar radiation (both indoors and outdoors) into direct current electricity using semiconductors that exhibit the photovoltaic effect. Photovoltaic power generation employs solar panels composed of a number of cells containing a photovoltaic material. Note that photovoltaics have been scaled up to industrial size and that large solar farms exist.
* [[Thermoelectric]] generators (TEGs) consist of the junction of two dissimilar materials and the presence of a thermal gradient. Large voltage outputs are possible by connecting many junctions electrically in series and thermally in parallel. Typical performance is 100-300 μV/K per junction. These can be utilized to capture mW.s of energy from industrial equipment, structures, and even the human body. They are typically coupled with heat sinks to improve temperature gradient.
* [[Micro wind turbine]] are used to harvest wind energy readily available in the environment in the form of kinetic energy to power the low power electronic devices such as wireless sensor nodes. When air flows across the blades of the turbine, a net pressure difference is developed between the wind speeds above and below the blades. This will result in a lift force generated which in turn rotate the blades. Similar to photovoltaics, wind farms have been constructed on an industrial scale and are being used to generate substantial amounts of electrical energy.
* [[piezoelectricity|Piezoelectric]] crystals or fibers generate a small voltage whenever they are mechanically deformed. Vibration from [[internal combustion engine|engines]] can stimulate piezoelectric materials, as can the heel of a shoe, or the pushing of a button.
* Special [[antenna (electronics)|antennas]] can collect energy from stray radio waves,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rexresearch.com/tate/tate.htm Inventor Joe Tate's Ambient Power Module converts radio frequencies to usable electrical power (albeit only milliwatts) sufficient to operate clocks, smoke alarms, Ni-Cd battery chargers, &amp;amp;c.]&lt;/ref&gt; this can also be done with a [[Rectenna]] and theoretically at even higher frequency [[Electromagnetic radiation|EM radiation]] with a [[Nantenna]].
* Power from keys pressed during use of a portable electronic device or remote controller, using magnet and coil or piezoelectric energy converters, may be used to help power the device.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ezerotech.com/5838138.pdf Electronic Device Which is Powered By Actuation Of Manual Inputs, US Patent no. 5,838,138]&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|RF}}Ambient-radiation sources===
A possible source of energy comes from ubiquitous radio transmitters. Historically, either a large collection area or close proximity to the radiating [[Wireless energy transfer|wireless energy]] source is needed to get useful power levels from this source. The [[nantenna]] is one proposed development which would overcome this limitation by making use of the abundant [[radiant energy|natural radiation]] (such as [[solar radiation]]).

One idea is to deliberately broadcast RF energy to power and collect information from remote devices:&lt;ref name="ieeexplore.ieee.org"/&gt; This is now commonplace in passive [[radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) systems, but the Safety and US [[Federal Communications Commission]] (and equivalent bodies worldwide) limit the maximum power that can be transmitted this way to civilian use. This method has been used to power individual nodes in a wireless sensor network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Percy|first=Steven |author2=Chris Knight |author3=Francis Cooray |author4=Ken Smart|title=Supplying the Power Requirements to a Sensor Network Using Radio Frequency Power Transfer|journal=Sensors|year=2012|volume=12|issue=7|pages=8571–8585|doi=10.3390/s120708571|pmid=23012506 |pmc=3444064 |url=http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/12/7/8571|accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Munir|first=Bilal |author2=Vladimir Dyo |title=On the Impact of Mobility on Battery-Less RF Energy Harvesting System Performance|journal=Sensors|year=2018|volume=18|issue=11|pages=3597 |doi=10.3390/s18113597|pmid=30360501 |url=https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/18/11/3597/htm|accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
.

===Fluid flow===
Airflow can be harvested by various turbine and non-turbine generator technologies. For example, Zephyr Energy Corporation’s patented Windbeam micro generator captures energy from airflow to recharge batteries and power electronic devices. The Windbeam’s novel design allows it to operate silently in wind speeds as low as 2&amp;nbsp;mph. The generator consists of a lightweight beam suspended by durable long-lasting springs within an outer frame. The beam oscillates rapidly when exposed to airflow due to the effects of multiple fluid flow phenomena. A linear alternator assembly converts the oscillating beam motion into usable electrical energy. A lack of bearings and gears eliminates frictional inefficiencies and noise. The generator can operate in low-light environments unsuitable for solar panels (e.g. HVAC ducts) and is inexpensive due to low cost components and simple construction. The scalable technology can be optimized to satisfy the energy requirements and design constraints of a given application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.zephyrenergy.com | title=Zephyr Energy &amp;#124; Windbeam &amp;#124; &amp;#124; Zephyr Energy Corporation's patented Windbeam micro generator captures energy from airflow to recharge batteries and power electronic devices.Zephyr Energy &amp;#124; Windbeam &amp;#124; &amp;#124; Zephyr Energy Corporation's patented Windbeam micro generator captures energy from airflow to recharge batteries and power electronic devices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flow of blood can also be used to power devices. For instance, the pacemaker developed at the University of Bern, uses blood flow to wind up a spring which in turn drives an electrical micro-generator.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11070625/Clockwork-pacemaker-powered-by-heart-beat-could-end-need-for-surgery.html Clockwork pacemaker]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photovoltaic===
Photovoltaic (PV) energy harvesting wireless technology offers significant advantages over wired or solely battery-powered sensor solutions: virtually inexhaustible sources of power with little or no adverse environmental effects.  Indoor PV harvesting solutions have to date been powered by specially tuned amorphous silicon (aSi)a technology most used in Solar Calculators.  In recent years new PV technologies have come to the forefront in Energy Harvesting such as Dye Sensitized Solar Cells ([[Dye-sensitized solar cell|DSSC]]).  The dyes absorbs light much like [[chlorophyll]] does in plants.  Electrons released on impact escape to the layer of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and from there diffuse, through the electrolyte, as the dye can be tuned to the visible spectrum much higher power can be produced.  At {{nowrap|200 [[lux]]}} a DSSC can provide over {{nowrap|10 µW}} per cm².

===Piezoelectric===
The [[piezoelectric effect]] converts mechanical [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] into electric current or voltage. This strain can come from many different sources. Human motion, low-frequency seismic vibrations, and acoustic noise are everyday examples. Except in rare instances the piezoelectric effect operates in AC requiring time-varying inputs at mechanical resonance to be efficient.

Most piezoelectric electricity sources produce power on the order of milliwatts, too small for system application, but enough for hand-held devices such as some commercially available self-winding wristwatches.  One proposal is that they are used for micro-scale devices, such as in a device harvesting micro-hydraulic energy. In this device, the flow of pressurized hydraulic fluid drives a reciprocating piston supported by three piezoelectric elements which convert the pressure fluctuations into an alternating current.

As piezo energy harvesting has been investigated only since the late 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = N.M. | last2 = Glynne-Jones | first2 = P. | last3 = Beeby | first3 = S.P. | year = 2001 | title = A novel thick-film piezoelectric micro-generator | url = https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/256612/1/Smart_materials.pdf| journal = Smart Materials and Structures | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 850–852 | doi = 10.1088/0964-1726/10/4/403 | bibcode = 2001SMaS...10..850W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kymissis|first1=John|title=Parasitic power harvesting in shoes|journal=Second International Symposium on Wearable Computers|date=1998|pages=132–139|doi=10.1109/ISWC.1998.729539|isbn=978-0-8186-9074-7|citeseerx=10.1.1.11.6175}}&lt;/ref&gt; it remains an emerging technology. Nevertheless, some interesting improvements were made with the self-powered electronic switch at INSA school of engineering, implemented by the spin-off Arveni. In 2006, the proof of concept of a battery-less wireless doorbell push button was created, and recently, a product showed that classical wireless wallswitch can be powered by a piezo harvester. Other industrial applications appeared between 2000 and 2005,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cedrat.com/en/technologies/mechatronic-systems/energy-harvesting.html energy harvesting industrial realisations]&lt;/ref&gt; to harvest energy from vibration and supply sensors for example, or to harvest energy from shock.

Piezoelectric systems can convert motion from the human body into electrical power. [[DARPA]] has funded efforts to harness energy from leg and arm motion, shoe impacts, and [[blood pressure]] for low level power to implantable or wearable sensors. The nanobrushes are another example of a piezoelectric energy harvester.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanoscience.gatech.edu/zlwang/ Zhong Lin Wang's nanobrushes]&lt;/ref&gt; They can be integrated into clothing. Multiple other nanostructures have been exploited to build an energy-harvesting device, for example, a single crystal PMN-PT nanobelt was fabricated and assembled into a piezoelectric energy harvester in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Fan|last2=Cai|first2=Wei|last3=Yeh|first3=Yao-Wen|last4=Xu|first4=Shiyou|last5=Yao|first5=Nan|date=2016-03-01|title=Energy scavenging based on a single-crystal PMN-PT nanobelt|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep22513|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=6|doi=10.1038/srep22513|issn=2045-2322|pmc=4772540|pmid=26928788|page=22513|bibcode=2016NatSR...622513W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Careful design is needed to minimise user discomfort. These energy harvesting sources by association affect the body. The Vibration Energy Scavenging Project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vibes.ecs.soton.ac.uk/ VIBES Project]&lt;/ref&gt; is another project that is set up to try to scavenge electrical energy from environmental vibrations and movements. Microbelt can be used to gather electricity from respiration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engr.wisc.edu/news/archive/2011/Oct11.html Electricity from the nose]&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, as the vibration of motion from human comes in three directions, a single piezoelectric cantilever based omni-directional energy harvester is created by using 1:2 internal resonance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xu|first=J.|last2=Tang|first2=J.|date=2015-11-23|title=Multi-directional energy harvesting by piezoelectric cantilever-pendulum with internal resonance|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=107|issue=21|pages=213902|doi=10.1063/1.4936607|issn=0003-6951|bibcode=2015ApPhL.107u3902X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, a millimeter-scale piezoelectric energy harvester has also already been created.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ns.umich.edu/htdocs/releases/story.php?id=8386 Millimter-scale piezoelectric energy harvester]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[piezoelectric]] materials to harvest power has already become popular. Piezoelectric materials have the ability to transform mechanical strain energy into electrical charge. Piezo elements are being embedded in walkways&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/08/japan_ticket_gates.php "Japan: Producing Electricity from Train Station Ticket Gates"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerleap.net/public.html Powerleap tiles as piezoelectric energy harvesting machines]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tokyomango.blogspot.com/2006/10/commuter-generated-electricity.html "Commuter-generated electricity"]&lt;/ref&gt; to recover the "people energy" of footsteps. They can also be embedded in shoes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rst2.edu/njheps/resources/energy_scavenging.pdf "Energy Scavenging with Shoe-Mounted Piezoelectrics"]&lt;/ref&gt; to recover "walking energy". Researchers at MIT developed the first micro-scale piezoelectric energy harvester using thin film PZT in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924424705000683 | doi=10.1016/j.sna.2004.12.032 | volume=122 | title=MEMS power generator with transverse mode thin film PZT | year=2005 | journal=Sensors and Actuators A: Physical | pages=16–22 | last1 = Jeon | first1 = Y.B. | last2 = Sood | first2 = R. | last3 = Kim | first3 = S.-G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arman Hajati and Sang-Gook Kim invented the Ultra Wide-Bandwidth micro-scale piezoelectric energy harvesting device by exploiting the nonlinear stiffness of a doubly clamped microelectromechanical systems ([[MEMS]]s) resonator. The stretching strain in a doubly clamped beam shows a nonlinear stiffness, which provides a passive feedback and results in amplitude-stiffened Duffing mode resonance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apl.aip.org/resource/1/applab/v99/i8/p083105_s1 Ultra-wide bandwidth piezoelectric energy harvesting] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515113711/http://apl.aip.org/resource/1/applab/v99/i8/p083105_s1 |date=15 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, piezoelectric cantilevers are adopted for the above-mentioned energy harvesting system.  One drawback is that the piezoelectric cantilever has gradient strain distribution, i.e., the piezoelectric transducer is not fully utilized.

=== Energy from smart roads and piezoelectricity ===

[[Image:SchemaPiezo.gif|thumb|right|200px|A piezoelectric disk generates a voltage when deformed (change in shape is greatly exaggerated)]]

Brothers [[Pierre Curie]] and [[Jacques Curie]] gave the concept of piezoelectric effect in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques and Pierre Curie (1880) "Développement par compression de l’électricité polaire dans les cristaux hémièdres à faces inclinées" (Development, via compression, of electric polarization in hemihedral crystals with inclined faces), ''Bulletin de la Société minérologique de France'', vol. 3, pages 90 - 93.

Considering piezoelectric effect in thin film lead zirconate titanate &lt;math&gt; Pb(Zr,Ti)O_3 &lt;/math&gt; PZT, microelectromechanical systems ([[MEMS]]) power generating device has been developed. During recent improvement in piezoelectric technology, Aqsa Abbasi ''(also known as Aqsa Aitbar, General secretory at IMS, [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] [[Mehran University of Engineering and Technology|MUET Chapter]] and [[Director (business)|Director]] [[Mass media|Media]] at [[Model United Nations|HYD MUN]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://hydmun.com/host.html Aqsa Aitbar, Director Media at Hyderabad Model United Nation]&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://portalgaruda.org/index.php?ref=browse&amp;mod=viewarticle&amp;article=89504  Abbasi, Aqsa.

"Electricity Generation Due to Vibration of Moving Vehicles Using Piezoelectric Effect" (AEEE) Vol.4, No.3 (2014), pp. 313-318.]&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Aqsa further developed beam-structured [[electrostatic]] devices that are more difficult to fabricate than PZT MEMS devices versus a similar because general [[silicon]] processing involves many more mask steps that do not require PZT film. Piezoelectric &lt;math&gt;d_{31}&lt;/math&gt; type [[sensors]] and [[actuators]] have a cantilever beam structure that consists of a membrane bottom [[electrode]], film,  piezoelectric film, and top electrode. More than {{math|''(3~5 masks)''}} mask steps are required for patterning of each layer while have very low induced voltage.  Pyroelectric crystals that have a unique polar axis and have spontaneous polarization, along which the spontaneous polarization exists. These are the [[crystals]] of classes {{math|''6mm''}}, {{math|''4mm''}}, {{math|''mm2''}}, {{math|''6''}}, {{math|''4''}}, {{math|''3m''}}, {{math|''3''}},{{math|''2''}}, {{math|''m''}}. The special polar axis—crystallophysical axis {{math|''X3''}} — coincides with the axes {{math|''L6''}},{{math|''L4''}}, {{math|''L3''}}, and {{math|''L2''}} of the crystals or lies in the unique straight plane {{math|''P (class “m”)''}}. Consequently, the electric centers of positive and negative charges are displaced of an elementary cell from equilibrium positions, i.e., the spontaneous polarization of the crystal changes. Therefore, all considered crystals have spontaneous polarization &lt;math&gt;Ps = P3&lt;/math&gt;. Since 
piezoelectric effect in pyroelectric crystals arises as a result of changes in their spontaneous polarization under external effects ([[electric fields]], mechanical stresses). As a result of displacement, Aqsa Abbasi introduced change in the components &lt;math&gt;\Delta P_s&lt;/math&gt; along all three axes &lt;math&gt;\Delta P_s = (\Delta P_1, \Delta P_2, \Delta P_3) &lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\Delta P_s = (\Delta P_1, \Delta P_2, \Delta P_3) &lt;/math&gt;  is proportional to the [[mechanical stress]]es causing in a first approximation, which results &lt;math&gt; \Delta P_i = dikl Tkl &lt;/math&gt; where {{math|''Tkl''}} represents the mechanical stress and {{math|''dikl''}} represents the piezoelectric modules.&lt;ref name="iaesjournal.com"/&gt;

PZT thin films have attracted attention for applications such as force sensors, [[accelerometers]], gyroscopes actuators, tunable optics, micro pumps, ferroelectric RAM, display systems and smart roads,&lt;ref name="iaesjournal.com"/&gt; when energy sources are limited, energy harvesting plays an important role in the environment. Smart roads have the potential to play an important role in power generation. Embedding piezoelectric material in the road can convert pressure exerted by moving vehicles into voltage and current.&lt;ref name="iaesjournal.com"/&gt;

=== Smart transportation intelligent system ===
{{See also|Piezoelectric sensors}}
Piezoelectric sensors are most useful in Smart-road technologies that can be used to create systems that are intelligent and improve productivity in the long run. Imagine highways that alert motorists of a traffic jam before it forms. Or bridges that report when they are at risk of collapse, or an electric grid that fixes itself when blackouts hit. For many decades, scientists and experts have argued that the best way to fight congestion is intelligent transportation systems, such as roadside sensors to measure traffic and synchronized traffic lights to control the flow of vehicles. But the spread of these technologies has been limited by cost. There are also some other smart-technology [[shovel ready]] projects which could be deployed fairly quickly, but most of the technologies are still at the development stage and might not be practically available for five years or more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smarthighway.net/ Smart Highways and  intelligent transportation]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pyroelectric===

The [[pyroelectric effect]] converts a temperature change into electric current or voltage. It is analogous to the [[piezoelectric effect]], which is another type of [[ferroelectric]] behavior. Pyroelectricity requires time-varying inputs and suffers from small power outputs in energy harvesting applications due to its low operating frequencies. However, one key advantage of pyroelectrics over [[thermoelectrics]] is that many pyroelectric materials are stable up to 1200 ⁰C or higher, enabling energy harvesting from high temperature sources and thus increasing [[thermodynamic efficiency]].

One way to directly convert [[waste heat]] into electricity is by executing the Olsen cycle on pyroelectric materials. The Olsen cycle consists of two isothermal and two isoelectric field processes in the electric displacement-electric field (D-E) diagram. The principle of the Olsen cycle is to charge a capacitor via cooling under low electric field and to discharge it under heating at higher electric field. Several pyroelectric converters have been developed to implement the Olsen cycle using conduction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359431111007319 | doi=10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2011.12.034 | volume=37 | title=Pyroelectric waste heat energy harvesting using heat conduction | year=2012 | journal=Applied Thermal Engineering | pages=30–37 | last1 = Lee | first1 = Felix Y. | last2 = Navid | first2 = Ashcon | last3 = Pilon | first3 = Laurent}}&lt;/ref&gt; convection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00150198108209595 | volume=38 | title=A pyroelectric energy converter which employs regeneration | year=1981 | journal=Ferroelectrics | pages=975–978 | last1 = Olsen | first1 = Randall B. | last2 = Briscoe | first2 = Joseph M. | last3 = Bruno | first3 = David A. | last4 = Butler | first4 = William F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00150198408240091 | volume=59 | title=Cascaded pyroelectric energy converter | year=1984 | journal=Ferroelectrics | pages=205–219 | last1 = Olsen | first1 = R.

Additionally, a pyroelectric scavenging device that does not require time-varying inputs was recently introduced. The energy-harvesting device uses the edge-depolarizing electric field of a heated pyroelectric to convert heat energy into mechanical energy instead of drawing electric current off two plates attached to the crystal-faces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.createthefuturecontest.com/pages/view/entriesdetail.html?entryID=1309 "Pyroelectric Energy Scavenger"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermoelectrics===
{{Main article|Thermoelectric generator}}
In 1821, [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]] discovered that a thermal gradient formed between two dissimilar conductors produces a voltage.  At the heart of the thermoelectric effect is the fact that a temperature gradient in a conducting material results in heat flow; this results in the diffusion of charge carriers. The flow of charge carriers between the hot and cold regions in turn creates a voltage difference. In 1834, [[Jean Charles Athanase Peltier]] discovered that running an electric current through the junction of two dissimilar conductors could, depending on the direction of the current, cause it to act as a heater or cooler. The heat absorbed or produced is proportional to the current, and the proportionality constant is known as the Peltier coefficient. Today, due to knowledge of the Seebeck and [[Peltier effect]]s, thermoelectric materials can be used as heaters, coolers and [[Thermogenerator|generators]] (TEGs).

Ideal thermoelectric materials have a high Seebeck coefficient, high electrical conductivity, and low thermal conductivity. Low thermal conductivity is necessary to maintain a high thermal gradient at the junction. Standard thermoelectric modules manufactured today consist of P- and N-doped bismuth-telluride semiconductors sandwiched between two metallized ceramic plates. The ceramic plates add rigidity and electrical insulation to the system. The semiconductors are connected electrically in series and thermally in parallel.

Miniature thermocouples have been developed that convert body heat into electricity and generate 40[[micro-|μ]][[Watt|W]] at 3[[Volt|V]] with a 5 degree &lt;!-- C or F? --&gt; temperature gradient, while on the other end of the scale, large thermocouples are used in nuclear [[Radioisotope thermoelectric generator|RTG]] batteries.

Practical examples are the finger-heartratemeter by the [[Holst Centre]] and the thermogenerators by the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.micropelt.com/down/pm_te_power_node_engl.pdf Fraunhofer Thermogenerator 1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS129017+11-Mar-2008+BW20080311 15mW thermogenerator by Fraunhofer Gesellschaft]&lt;/ref&gt;

Advantages to thermoelectrics:
# No moving parts allow continuous operation for many years. ''Tellurex Corporation''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tellurex.com Tellurex Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt; (a thermoelectric production company) claims that thermoelectrics are capable of over 100,000 hours of steady state operation.
# Thermoelectrics contain no materials that must be replenished.
# Heating and cooling can be reversed.

One downside to thermoelectric energy conversion is low efficiency (currently less than 10%). The development of materials that are able to operate in higher temperature gradients, and that can conduct electricity well without also conducting heat (something that was until recently thought impossible {{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}), will result in increased efficiency.

Future work in thermoelectrics could be to convert wasted heat, such as in automobile engine combustion, into electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Powerdriver]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrostatic (capacitive)===
This type of harvesting is based on the changing capacitance of vibration-dependent capacitors. Vibrations separate the plates of a charged variable capacitor, and mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy.
Electrostatic energy harvesters need a polarization source to work and to convert mechanical energy from vibrations into electricity. The polarization source should be in the order of some hundreds of volts; this greatly complicates the power management circuit. Another solution consists in using [[electret]]s, that are electrically charged dielectrics able to keep the polarization on the capacitor for years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tikalon.com/blog/blog.php?article=2011/electret Tikalon Blog by Dev Gualtieri]. Tikalon.com. Retrieved on 2013-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt;
It's possible to adapt structures from classical electrostatic induction generators, which also extract energy from variable capacitances, for this purpose. The resulting devices are self-biasing, and can directly charge batteries, or can produce exponentially growing voltages on storage capacitors, from which energy can be periodically extracted by DC/DC converters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?reload=true&amp;arnumber=6093949 IEEE Xplore - The Doubler of Electricity Used as Battery Charger]. Ieeexplore.ieee.org. Retrieved on 2013-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetic induction===
Magnets wobbling on a cantilever are sensitive to even small vibrations and generate microcurrents by moving relative to conductors due to [[Faraday's law of induction]]. By developing a miniature device of this kind in 2007, a team from the [[University of Southampton]] made possible the planting of such a device in environments that preclude having any electrical connection to the outside world. [[Sensors]] in inaccessible places can now generate their own power and transmit data to outside receivers.&lt;ref name="Southampton"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6272752.stm "Good vibes power tiny generator."]  ''BBC News''.  5 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major limitations of the magnetic vibration energy harvester developed at [[University of Southampton]] is the size of the generator, in this case approximately one cubic centimeter, which is much too large to integrate into today's mobile technologies. The complete generator including circuitry is a massive 4&amp;nbsp;cm by 4&amp;nbsp;cm by 1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;ref name="Southampton"/&gt; nearly the same size as some mobile devices such as the iPod nano.  Further reductions in the dimensions are possible through the integration of new and more flexible materials as the cantilever beam component. In 2012, a group at [[Northwestern University]] developed a vibration-powered generator out of polymer in the form of a spring.&lt;ref name="Northwestern"&gt;[http://www.hindawi.com/journals/smr/2012/741835/abs/ "Polymer Vibration-Powered Generator"]  ''Hindawi Publishing Corporation''.  13 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This device was able to target the same frequencies as the University of Southampton groups silicon based device but with one third the size of the beam component.

A new approach to magnetic induction based energy harvesting has also been proposed by using ferrofluids. The journal article, "Electromagnetic ferrofluid-based energy harvester", discusses the use of ferrofluids to harvest low frequency vibrational energy at 2.2&amp;nbsp;Hz with a power output of ~80&amp;nbsp;mW per g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bibo|first1=A.|last2=Masana|first2=R.|last3=King|first3=A.|last4=Li|first4=G.|last5=Daqaq|first5=M.F.|title=Electromagnetic ferrofluid-based energy harvester|journal=Physics Letters A|date=June 2012|volume=376|issue=32|pages=2163–2166|doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2012.05.033|bibcode=2012PhLA..376.2163B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercially successful vibration energy harvesters based on magnetic induction are still relatively few in number. Examples include products developed by Swedish company [http://www.revibeenergy.com ReVibe Energy], a technology spin-out from [[Saab Group]]. Another example is the products developed from the early University of Southampton prototypes by Perpetuum. These have to be sufficiently large to generate the power required by wireless sensor nodes (wsn)but in M2M applications this is not normally an issue. These harvesters are now being supplied in large volumes to power wsn's made by companies such as GE and Emerson and also for train bearing monitoring systems made by Perpetuum.
[[Wireless powerline sensor|Overhead powerline sensors]] can use magnetic induction to harvest energy directly from the conductor they are monitoring.&lt;ref name="enocean"&gt;{{cite web |author=Christian Bach

===Blood sugar===
Another way of energy harvesting is through the oxidation of blood sugars. These energy harvesters are called [[Biobattery|biobatteries]]. They could be used to power implanted electronic devices (e.g., pacemakers, implanted biosensors for diabetics, implanted active RFID devices, etc.). At present, the Minteer Group of Saint Louis University has created enzymes that could be used to generate power from blood sugars. However, the enzymes would still need to be replaced after a few years.&lt;ref&gt;The power within, by Bob Holmes, New Scientist, 25 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a pacemaker was powered by implantable biofuel cells at Clarkson University under the leadership of Dr. Evgeny Katz.&lt;ref&gt;K.

Katz, "From 'Cyborg' Lobsters to a Pacemaker Powered by Implantable Biofuel Cells", Energy &amp; Environmental Science, 2013, 6, 81-86&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tree-based===
Tree metabolic energy harvesting is a type of bio-energy harvesting. Voltree has developed a method for harvesting energy from trees. These energy harvesters are being used to power remote sensors and mesh networks as the basis for a long term deployment system to monitor forest fires and weather in the forest. According to Voltree's website, the useful life of such a device should be limited only by the lifetime of the tree to which it is attached. A small test network was recently deployed in a US National Park forest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voltreepower.com/index.html "Voltree's Website"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sources of energy from trees include capturing the physical movement of the tree in a generator. Theoretical analysis of this source of energy shows some promise in powering small electronic devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGarry|first=Scott|author2=Knight, Chris|title=The Potential for Harvesting Energy from the Movement of Trees|journal=Sensors|date=28 September 2011|volume=11|issue=10|pages=9275–9299|doi=10.3390/s111009275|pmid=22163695|pmc=3231266|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/11/10/9275|accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A practical device based on this theory has been built and successfully powered a sensor node for a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGarry|first=Scott|author2=Knight, Chris|title=Development and Successful Application of a Tree Movement Energy Harvesting Device, to Power a Wireless Sensor Node|journal=Sensors|date=4 September 2012|volume=12|issue=9|pages=12110–12125|doi=10.3390/s120912110|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/12/9/12110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metamaterial===
A metamaterial-based device wirelessly converts a 900&amp;nbsp;MHz [[microwave]] signal to 7.3 volts of [[direct current]] (greater than that of a USB device). The device can be tuned to harvest other signals including Wi-Fi signals, satellite signals, or even sound signals. The experimental device used a series of five [[fiberglass]] and [[copper]] conductors. Conversion efficiency reached 37 percent. When traditional antennas are close to each other in space they interfere with each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurzweilai.net/wireless-device-converts-lost-microwave-energy-into-electric-power Wireless device converts 'lost’ microwave energy into electric power].

While the claim of 7.3 volts is grand, the measurement is for an open circuit. Since the power is so low, there can be almost no current when any load is attached.

===Atmospheric pressure changes===
The change in air pressure due to temperature changes or weather patterns vs. a sealed chamber has been used to provide power for mechanical clocks such as the [[Atmos clock]].

What is an Atmospheric pressure change?

An Atmospheric change is a force exerted on a surface by air above as gravity pulls it to Earth. This is often measured by the barometer, a slight mercury in the glass tube rises and drops depending on changes in altitude and pressure. Usually, atmosphere pressure drops as altitude increases, also vice versa. Atmospheric pressure consists of molecules in constant motion, colliding with each other about 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; collisions per molecule per second at 10&amp;nbsp;°C (50&amp;nbsp;°F), this is part of the kinetic energy of the atmosphere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benn|first1=Dr. D.I.|title=pressure.htm|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~dib2/climate/pressure.html|website=www.st-andrews.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;. With given devices/technology (Wind Turbine) in the contemporary era, industries/individuals can harvest or convert atmospheric energy into Electrical energy with low-cost efficient or even free! Overall an Atmospheric pressure is a great utility that can be devised into our economy for top-tier energy harvest and future solution for many other issues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Khaligh|first1=Alreza|title=Energy Harvesting: Solar, Wind, and Ocean Energy Conversion Systems|url=https://www.crcpress.com/Energy-Harvesting-Solar-Wind-and-Ocean-Energy-Conversion-Systems/Khaligh-Onar/p/book/9781439815083|website=CRC Press|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Ocean Energy ===
A relatively new concept of generating energy is to generate energy from oceans. Large masses of waters are present on the planet which carry with them great amounts of energy. The energy in this case can be generated by tidal streams, ocean waves, difference in salinity and also difference in temperature. Efforts are underway to harvest energy this way as it holds a great potential and would be a renewable form of energy. United States Navy recently was able to generate electricity using difference in temperatures present in the ocean. The project didn't yield that much energy but sure there is a lot of potential.

Another idea is to generate an artificial flow in ocean to generate energy. If a flow of considerable magnitude could be generated it would produce large amounts of energy.

==Future directions==

[[Electroactive polymers]] (EAPs) have been proposed for harvesting energy. These polymers have a large strain, elastic energy density, and high energy conversion efficiency. The total weight of systems based on EAPs(electroactive polymers) is proposed to be significantly lower than those based on piezoelectric materials.

[[Nanogenerator]]s, such as the one made by Georgia Tech, could provide a new way for powering devices without batteries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gatech.edu/newsroom/release.html?id=1326 Georgia tech Nanogenerator]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, it only generates some dozen nanowatts, which is too low for any practical application.

[[Noise]] has been the subject of a proposal by NiPS Laboratory in Italy to harvest wide spectrum low scale vibrations via a nonlinear dynamical mechanism that can improve harvester efficiency up to a factor 4 compared to traditional linear harvesters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/38102 Noise harvesting]&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of complementary balanced energy harvesting has the potential to increase reliability of wireless sensor systems for structural health monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Verbelen |first=Yannick |last2=Braeken |first2=An |last3=Touhafi |first3=Abdellah |date=2014 |title=Towards a complementary balanced energy harvesting solution for low power embedded systems |journal=Microsystem Technologies |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=1007–1021 |doi=10.1007/s00542-014-2103-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fatty acid photodecarboxylase''' is an enzyme that converts fatty acids to [[alkanes]] or [[alkenes]], which can then, in principle, be used as [[biofuel]].  The enzyme has been found in ''[[Chlorella variabilis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/51391/title/A-Newly-Identified-Photoenzyme-Helps-Algae-Pump-Out-Fuel/|title=A Newly Identified Photoenzyme Helps Algae Pump Out Fuel|last=Zimmer|first=Katarina|date=2018-02-01|website=The Scientist|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fiberglass sheet laminating''' is the process of taking a thin [[fiberglass]] sheet and [[laminating]] it to another material in order to provide strength and support to that material.

==Process Characteristics==
Fiberglass is composed of very fine strands of glass. It has many different purposes, one of which is used for strength. The strength of fiberglass depends on the size of the glass strands, the temperature, and the humidity.

==Materials Needed==
Fiberglass sheet, [[resin]], wood or metal roller, brush or other tool to spread epoxy, material to be strengthened

==Process Description==
Start by applying the epoxy to the fiberglass sheet. Continue carefully but quickly until all areas are sufficiently covered by the epoxy. Next, start at one end of the material to be strengthened and stick the epoxy covered fiberglass to the material, being sure to smooth out any bubbles that may form between the material and fiberglass. If the epoxy hardens before you are able to stick the fiberglass to the material, recoat and apply again.  After the fiberglass sheet has been applied, use a roller to press the fiberglass firmly to the other sheet to ensure complete bonding has occurred.

==Effect on Work Material==
Certain laminating techniques use two steps of applying the epoxy to form resin impregnated fiber glass sheets.  In the first step there is a resin solvent mixture which is partially cured so it will not redissolve in a second coating of the same mixture.  The same resin mixture is subsequently given to the covered fiberglass with moderately cured resin in the second step. This second glaze which covers the first fills in the empty spaces between the fibers.  The second coating is also only partially cured. This partial curing of the second layer furthers the curing of the first epoxy layer. This process also produces a thin sticky layer. The first coating acts like a sealed insulating sheet, preventing glass fiber contact with conductive planes.  The second coating fills the planes and can form adhesive bonds to cores and conductive layers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5783252.html Technique for forming resin-impregnated fiberglass sheets], United States Patent 5783252&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
* Be sure to keep fiberglass and epoxy away from open flames
* Do not inhale excess fumes from epoxy or allow epoxy to come in contact with eyes or skin

A '''foreign exchange aggregator''' or '''FX Aggregator''' is a class of systems used in [[forex|Forex trading]] to aggregate the [[liquidity]] from several liquidity providers.

Aggregators usually provide two main functions; they allow FX traders to compare price from different liquidity venues such as banks-global [[market maker]]s or [[electronic communication network|ECNs]] like [[Currenex]], [[FXall]] or [[Hotspot FX]] and to have a consolidated view of the market. They allow traders to trade with many participants using a single [[API]] or a single [[electronic trading platform|trading terminal]]. Some of the systems support order sweeping (an order is split into the chunks which are sent to the respective counterparties based on the price, time and other attributes of the quotes from these counterparties), other systems route the whole order to a single liquidity provider who is chosen by an order routing algorithm embedded into an aggregator.

==Technology==
FX Aggregator implementation is complex as the technology needs to be fast (Latencies in microseconds) and flexible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelmudra.com/ |title=An online foreign exchange aggregator enabling you to search RBI authorised money changers in India |publisher=Travelmudra |date=March 17, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222083236/http://www.travelmudra.com/ |archivedate=December 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seekingalpha.com/instablog/846513-propelgrowth/1312481-5-reasons-fx-liquidity-aggregation-is-so-challenging/ |title=5 Reasons FX Liquidity Aggregation Is So Challenging |date= November 26, 2012 |publisher=Seeking Alpha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mark 1 coach 6313 at Bristol Temple Meads 2006-03-01 03.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A British Railways Mark 1 coach fitted with a gangway connection of the Pullman type]]
A '''gangway connection''' (or, more loosely, a '''corridor connection''') is a flexible connector fitted to the end of a railway coach, enabling passengers to move from one coach to another without danger of falling from the train.

==Origins: Coaches in British and American railways==
The [[London and North Western Railway]] (LNWR) was the first British railway to provide passengers with the means to move from one coach to another whilst the train was in motion. In 1869 the LNWR built a pair of saloons for the use of [[Queen Victoria]]; these had six-wheel underframes (the [[bogie]] coach did not appear in Britain until 1874), and the gangway was fitted to only one end of each coach. The Queen preferred to wait until the train had stopped before using the gangway.{{sfn|Jenkinson|1978|p=117}}{{sfn|Jenkinson|1988|p=10}}

[[File:GNER-91116-coupling-01.jpg|thumb|right|This British locomotive has a centre buffing plate similar to that fitted to the lower portion of a Pullman-type gangway connection]] 
In 1887, [[George M. Pullman]] introduced his patented [[Vestibuled train|vestibule cars]]. Older railroad cars had open platforms at their ends, which were used both for joining and leaving the train, but could also be used to step from one car to the next. This practice was dangerous, and so Pullman decided to enclose the platform to produce the [[Vestibule (architecture)#Railroad use|vestibule]]. For passing between cars, there was a passageway in the form of a steel-framed rectangular diaphragm mounted on a buffing plate above the centre coupler. The vestibule prevented passengers from falling out, and protected passengers from the weather when passing between cars. In the event of an accident, the design also helped prevent cars from overriding each other, reducing the risk of [[Telescoping (railway)|telescoping]]. Pullman's vestibule cars were first used in 1887. Among the first to use them was the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] on the ''Pennsylvania Limited'' service to Chicago.{{sfn|Chant|2002|p=348}}{{sfn|Solomon|2001|p=101}}

The [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] introduced the Gould-design{{clarify|date=July 2014}} gangway connection to Great Britain in 1889, when E.F. Howlden was Carriage and Wagon Superintendent.{{sfn|Harris|1995|p=9}}

On 7 March 1892, the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) introduced a set of gangwayed coaches on their {{stnlnk|Paddington}} to [[Birkenhead Woodside railway station|Birkenhead]] service. Built to the design of [[William Dean (engineer)|William Dean]], it was the first British side-corridor train to have gangway connections between all the coaches, although they were provided not to enable passengers to move around the train, but rather to allow the guard to reach any compartment quickly. Electric bells were provided so that he could be summoned. When the guard was not so required, he kept the communicating doors locked. Passengers could still use the side-corridor within the coach to reach the toilet.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=38}} The gangway connections of the early GWR corridor coaches were offset to one side.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=23}} Some coaches intended for use at the ends of trains had the gangway connection fitted at one end only.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=40}} The GWR introduced restaurant cars in 1896; gangway connections were fitted, but passengers wishing to use the restaurant car were expected to board it at the start of their journey, and remain there: the connections were still not for public use.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=48,51}}

[[File:GWR coach D124 BTK 1614.jpg|thumb|right|A GWR coach fitted with a British Standard gangway connection of the "suspended" type]]
On 17 May 1923, the GWR introduced some new coaches on their South Wales services; some of these coaches had British Standard gangway connections{{clarify|date=July 2014}} and screw couplers as used on many other GWR coaches; some had Pullman-type gangway connections and Laycock "buckeye" couplers; and there were some with one type at one end, and the other end having the other type.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=24}}{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=75}} In 1925 the GWR started to use the "suspended" form of gangway connection instead of the "scissors" pattern{{clarify|date=July 2014}}.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=24}}{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=77}} From 1938, GWR coaches which were expected to need coupling to LNER or SR coaches were fitted with gangway adaptors, to allow the dissimilar types to be connected.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=24}}

From the beginning, the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] used the British Standard type of gangway connector, with its "scissors" pattern as used by the GWR. Some coaches needed for LNER or SR lines were given gangway adaptors, so that they could safely couple to coaches fitted with the Pullman-type gangway.{{sfn|Essery|Jenkinson|1991|p=7}}

On the formation of British Railways on 1 January 1948, operators decided to produce a new range of standard coaches, instead of perpetuating existing designs—but the new types had to be compatible with the old. Two of the pre-BR companies (the GWR and the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]]) favoured the British Standard gangway, whereas the other two (the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] and the [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]]) used the Pullman type. In the design of their new [[British Railways Mark 1|Mark 1 coaches]], British Railways decided to standardise on the Pullman type in view of its resistance to [[Telescoping (railway)|telescoping]].{{sfn|Parkin|1991|p=7,8}} These gangways consisted of a flat steel plate, having a large aperture for the passageway. At the bottom it was riveted to the buffing plate, whilst the top was supported on the coach end by two telescopic spring units. On the coach end was a wooden doorframe; this was connected to the faceplate by a flexible diaphragm made from plasticised [[asbestos]]. When two coaches were coupled, a curtain was used to cover the inside surfaces of the diaphragms and faceplates. The doorframe was fitted with a lockable door, of either sliding or hinged type, depending on the interior layout of that end of the coach.{{sfn|Parkin|1991|p=18,26}}

===Travelling Post Office===
[[File:GreatCentralRailwayE70268E.JPG|thumb|left|A preserved LNER [[Post Office Stowage Van|post office stowage tender]] with offset gangway connection]]

Coaches built for the [[Travelling Post Offices in the United Kingdom|Travelling Post Office]] (TPO) services normally had their gangway connections offset to one side. There were two main reasons: there was a perceived security risk should these coaches be coupled to ordinary passenger-carrying coaches, the differing gangway positions minimising the risk of intrusion; and more space was available for sorting tables, the postal workers being able to walk in a straight line between vans without disturbing the sorters. A disadvantage was that when a van was added to a TPO train, it might need to be turned around before it could be used. After the formation of British Railways, most new Mark 1 TPO vans were provided with centre gangways, though a batch intended to work with older vans were given offset gangways. These were altered to the standard arrangement in 1973. Until then, they had been the only BR Mark 1 gangwayed coaches not to have the Pullman gangway.{{sfn|Parkin|1991|p=175}}

The [[London and North Eastern Railway]] (LNER) decided that from the start of their summer timetable on 1 May 1928, the [[Flying Scotsman (train)|''Flying Scotsman'']] service would run non-stop over the {{convert|392.7|mi|km}} between {{stnlnk|London King's Cross}} and {{stnlnk|Edinburgh Waverley}}. The locomotives to be used were of that railway's [[LNER Gresley Classes A1 and A3|class A1]],{{sfn|Boddy|Neve|Yeadon|1973|pp=75–76}} and the schedule was for the journey to be completed in {{frac|8|1|4}} hours.{{sfn|Nock|1945|p=46}} This was too long to allow a single crew to handle the train without a rest; means were therefore sought by which the crew could be changed at approximately the half-way point.{{sfn|Boddy|Neve|Yeadon|1973|p=68}}

[[File:Flying Scotsman tender NRM 15 March 2009.jpg|thumb|A preserved corridor tender. The passageway runs along the side closest to the camera; the top of the passageway may be seen at the rear]]
The LNER's locomotive design team, headed by [[Nigel Gresley]], produced a new design of tender that was slightly longer than the old, but built as high and wide as possible without compromising the [[loading gauge]]. A passageway was incorporated along the right-hand side, and at the rear end a Pullman type gangway connection was fitted, together with a [[Janney coupler|buckeye coupler]], both of which were compatible with LNER coaches; the gangway was of concertina pattern, and was pressed against the corresponding gangway on the leading coach by means of sprung pistons. Although a normal gangway connection was used, the passageway through the tender was only {{convert|5|ft|m|2}} high and {{convert|18|in|m}} wide, and the floor of the passage was {{convert|2|ft|m}} above the bottom of the water tank, giving a high step at both ends. The passageway was illuminated by a single circular window in the tender rear panel, placed high up and to the right of the corridor connection.{{sfn|Boddy|Neve|Yeadon|1973|pp=68,112}} Ten of these tenders were placed in service between April and September 1928, of which three were attached to new locomotives of Class A3; two were attached to existing Class A3 locomotives, and five attached to Class A1 locomotives.{{sfn|Boddy|Neve|Yeadon|1973|pp=68–69}} The design was patented by Gresley in August 1928.{{sfn|Hughes|2001|p=95}}

In service, the relief crew travelled in the front coach of the train, and as the train approached the half-way point, they left their seats and made their way forward through the corridor tender to the locomotive cab. On their arrival, the previous crew then handed over the controls and went back to the seats in the train vacated by the relief crew.{{sfn|Boddy|Fry|Hennigan|Proud|1963|p=64}}

Another corridor tender was built in 1929 for use with the new [[LNER Class W1|Class W1]] 4-6-4 no. 10000;{{sfn|Boddy|Brown|Hennigan|Hoole|1984|p=149}} four more were built in 1935 with the first four locomotives of the new [[LNER Class A4|Class A4]], and a final seven were built with the 1937 batch of Class A4 locomotives, making a total of 22. The original ten were reconditioned in 1936–1937 and attached to other Class A4 locomotives. In May 1948, the 1929-built corridor tender was transferred to a locomotive of Class A4, after which all 22 remained with this class until withdrawal.{{sfn|Boddy|Fry|Hennigan|Proud|1963|p=64}}{{sfn|Boddy|Neve|Yeadon|1973|pp=112–3}}{{sfn|Boddy|Brown|Hennigan|Hoole|1984|p=156}}

In the USA, the [[Milwaukee Road class A]] 4-4-2s of 1935 built for the {{frac|6|1|2}} hour ''[[Hiawatha (passenger train)|Hiawatha]]'' express also used a corridor tender.

==Open gangways in urban transit==

In urban transit, open gangways are most commonly used in [[light rail]] and [[streetcar]]s, where the railcars are divided into two or more sections linked by gangways.  [[Articulated bus]]es similarly have extensions connected with a gangway.  Open gangways have also become increasingly used for [[heavy rail]] [[rapid transit]] rolling stock.  Bombardier's [[Bombardier Movia|Movia]] design is an example of an open gangway heavy rail car, which operates on a variety of subway systems around the world.  It provides a way to seamlessly move between cars at any time, without passing through doors and a dangerous open area that is often against the rules. It also raises the capacity of metro cars by about 10%,&lt;ref name="postcanada"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2016/08/16/heres-a-glimpse-at-the-future-on-nycs-subways/ |title=Here’s a glimpse at the future on NYC’s subways |date=August 16, 2016|author=Danielle Furfaro |work=[[New York Post]] |accessdate=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a significant improvement for systems such as the [[New York City Subway]] where infrastructure and timetables are near or at capacity.

The [[Toronto Transit Commission]] (TTC) was the first North American transit authority to use open gangway rolling stock, with its [[Toronto Rocket]] railcars delivered to the [[Toronto subway]] system from 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TTC unveils new subway cars |url=http://www.cp24.com/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20101014/101014_ttc/20101014/?hub=CP24Home |publisher=[[CP24]] |date=2010-10-14 |accessdate=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Société de Transport de Montréal]] (STM) upgraded its fleet of subway cars with Azur ([[MPM-10]]) trains that included open gangways.&lt;ref&gt;STM societyinmotion.org http://www.mouvementcollectif.org/SWF/?en/#/metro-cars&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA) is considering the design for the [[New York City Subway]]'s planned [[R211 (New York City Subway car)|R211]] order. Initially the order will consist of 545 cars, of which 20 will be in experimental open gangway formations. The order includes an option to purchase up to 640 additional open gangway cars, the decision of which will be based on the success of the prototype set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-unveils-design-reimagined-mta-subway-cars-and-details-ambitious-plan-enhance|title=Governor Cuomo Unveils Design of Reimagined MTA Subway Cars and Details Ambitious Plan to Enhance Subway Stations|date=2016-07-18|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Walk-through head is a type of gangway connection that is installed in a train set that is intended to enable the passage from one train to the next, when they are interconnected.

With most trains, it is possible, as similar to a locomotive towed train, to walk from one carriage to another, but a passage between the trains is less common.

[[File:Huletts.jpg|thumb|250px|Huletts at the [[Pennsylvania Railroad|PRR]] ore docks at [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]].  The near Hulett is discharging into the hopper, while the next is lowering its bucket into the hold.]]

The '''Hulett''' was an ore unloader that was widely used on the [[Great Lakes]] of North America. It was unsuited to tidewater ports because it could not adjust for rising and falling tides, although one was used in New York City.

==History==

The Hulett was invented by George Hulett of [[Ohio]] in the late 19th century; he received a patent for his invention in 1898.  The first working machine was built the following year at [[Conneaut Harbor]] in [[Conneaut, Ohio]].  It was successful, and many more were built along the [[Great Lakes]], especially the southern shore of [[Lake Erie]] to unload boats full of [[taconite]] from the iron mines near [[Lake Superior]]. Substantial improvements were later made on the design by [[Samuel T. Wellman]].

The Hulett machine revolutionised iron ore shipment on the Great Lakes.  Previous methods of unloading [[lake freighter]]s, involving hoists and buckets and much hand labor, cost approximately 18¢/ton.  Unloading with Huletts cost only 5¢/ton.  Unloading only took 5–10 hours, as opposed to days for previous methods.  Lake boats changed to accommodate the Hulett unloader, and became much larger, doubling in length and quadrupling in capacity.

By 1913, 54 Hulett machines were in service. Two were built at [[Lake Superior]] (unloading coal) and five at [[Gary, Indiana]], but the vast majority were along the shores of Lake Erie.  The additional unloading capacity they brought helped permit a greater than doubling of the ore traffic in the 1900&amp;ndash;1912 period.  A total of approximately 75 Huletts were built.  One was installed in [[New York City]] to unload garbage.  

The lake's Huletts were used until about 1992, when [[Self-discharger|self-unloading boats]] were standard on the American side of the lake. All have since been scrapped. In 1999, only six remained, the group of four at [[Whiskey Island, Cleveland, Ohio|Whiskey Island]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] the oldest. Another set was used unloading barges of coal in South Chicago until 2002 and were demolished in the Spring of 2010. 

In spite of the Cleveland machines being on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and designated as a [[Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark]], they were demolished in 2000 by the [[Cleveland Port Authority]] to enable development of the underlying land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cleveland's Huletts Soon Will Be History |journal=[[Society for Industrial Archeology Newsletter]] |volume=28 |issue=2 |page=17 |url=http://www.sia-web.org/sian/images/SIANVol282.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609151427/http://www.sia-web.org/sian/images/SIANVol282.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Port Authority disassembled and retained two Huletts, to enable their reconstruction at another site, but the reconstruction has not yet happened.

==Operation==
[[File:Hulett-bucket.jpg|thumb|A Hulett's bucket in the foreground, while another scoops ore from the hold. The operator's cab is in the leg, behind the aperture above the bucket and below the circular sprocket.]]
[[File:Hulett-discharging.jpg|thumb|Discharging the travelling hopper's load into a waiting [[hopper car]].]]

The electrically powered Hulett unloader rode on two parallel tracks along the [[Dock (maritime)|dock]]s, one near the edge and one further back, ordinarily with four [[rail tracks|railroad tracks]] in between.  Steel towers, riding on wheeled trucks, supported girders that spanned the railroad tracks.  

Along these girders ran a carriage which could move toward or away from the dock face.  This in turn carried a large walking beam which could be raised or lowered; at the dock end of this was a vertical column with a large scoop [[bucket]] on the end.  A parallel beam was mounted halfway down this column to keep the column vertical as it was raised or lowered.  The machine's operator, stationed in the vertical beam above the bucket for maximum cargo visibility, could spin the beam at any angle.  The scoop bucket was lowered into the ship's hold, closed to capture a quantity (10 tons approx.) of ore, raised, and moved back toward the dock. The workmen who operated the Hulett uploaders were known as '''Ore Hogs'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aNwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA74&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Giant Jaws Unload Ore Ship."] ''Popular Mechanics'', May 1953, pp. 74-77.&lt;/ref&gt; 

To reduce the required motion of the carriage, a moving receiving hopper ran between the main girders.  It was moved to the front for the main bucket to discharge its load, and then moved back to dump it into a waiting railroad car, or out onto a [[cantilever]] frame at the back to dump the load onto a stockpile.

The Hulett could move along the dock to align with the holds on an ore boat.  When the hold was almost empty, the Hulett could not finish the job itself.  Workmen entered the hold and shoveled the remaining ore into the Hulett's bucket. In a later development, a wheeled excavator was chained to the Hulett's bucket and lowered into the hold to fill the Hulett.

'''Jeff Prosise''' is a technical author on [[Microsoft Windows]] applications. He is very experienced in Microsoft Windows technologies like [[Microsoft Foundation Class Library|MFC]], [[.NET framework]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and others.

==Publications==
Jeff Prosise is the author of the book ''Programming Windows with MFC'', published by Microsoft Press. His book is about the [[Microsoft Foundation Class Library|MFC]], a [[C++]] based [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] programming library for Microsoft Windows. This book, along with [[Charles Petzold]]'s popular ''Programming Windows'' book are considered to be 'bibles' in Windows programming. While Petzold's book is known as the 'Windows API bible', Prosise's book is often referred to as the 'MFC bible'.

Some of his other publications are ''Programming Microsoft .NET'', ''Programming Windows with C#'' and ''How Computer Graphics Work'' (co-author Gary Suen). His previous books, published back in the 1980s and 1990s, included ''PC Magazine DOS 6 Techniques And Utilities'', ''PC Magazine DOS 6 Memory Management With Utilities'', and ''Windows Desktop Utilities''.

==Biography==
[[Image:GayettysMedicatedPaperAdvertisement.jpg|right|thumb|upright|An advertisement for Gayetty's Medicated Paper]]
[[United States Census]] records from 1860 show Gayetty lived in [[New York City]] with his family; his birthplace in the census records is listed as Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MC4T-Q76|title=Family Search "Personal Data for Joseph Gayetty"|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He first marketed toilet paper on December 8, 1857. Each sheet of pure [[Manila hemp]] paper &lt;ref name="Hendrickson2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Hendrickson|title=The Facts on File Dictionary of American Regionalisms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yXY0yQnvmmUC&amp;pg=PA679|year=2000|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-2992-1|pages=679–}}&lt;/ref&gt; was [[watermark]]ed "J C Gayetty N Y".&lt;ref name = "Cowboy Bob"&gt;[http://www.lemen.com/imageGayetty1.html Gayetty's Medicated Paper], Cowboy Bob's Dictionary, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The original product contained [[aloe]] as a lubricant and was marketed as an anti-[[hemorrhoid]] medical product.&lt;ref name="Hendrickson2000" /&gt;

Gayetty was attacked as a [[Quackery|quack]] by at least one medical society.&lt;ref&gt;Quackery, New Orleans Medical News and Hospital Gazette, April 1859&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smyth2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Smyth|title=Bum Fodder: An Absorbing History of Toilet Paper|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aooedVIbrdYC&amp;pg=PT38|year=2012|publisher=Souvenir Press Limited|isbn=978-0-285-64120-4|pages=38–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet his advertisement of the same year called his product "The Greatest Necessity of the Age" and warned against the perils of using toxic inked papers on sensitive body parts.&lt;ref&gt;Gayetty, J.C., [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/h?ammem/rbpebib:@field%28NUMBER+@band%28rbpe+13400600%29%29 The greatest necessity of the age! Gayetty's medicated paper for the water-closet. Read and learn what is in ordinary paper], An American Time Capsule: Three Centuries of Broadsides and Other Printed Ephemera, The Library of Congress American Memory, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; A different advertisement, also printed in 1859, says his business was located at 41 [[Ann Street (Manhattan)|Ann Street]], and he was selling 1,000 sheets for one dollar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://image2.findagrave.com/photos/2013/61/106087826_136230829409.jpg Gayetty's Medicated Paper, the Novelty of the Day (Advertisement)], New York Daily Tribune, February 3, 1859&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gayetty name and product were involved in a lawsuit that was filed in 1891, when B.T. Hoogland's Sons, toilet paper dealers, filed suit against the Gayetty Paper Company, specifically Harry K. Gayetty, for [[trademark infringement]]. B.T. Hoogland and Son's claim was that they were entitled to the use of the Gayetty name due to an unpaid debt.  A paper dated December 5, 1866, was allegedly given to a creditor in lieu of $25 debt and subsequently sold to B.T. Hoogland (senior) for one dollar.  However, on January 1, 1866, J.C. Gayetty had entered a ten-year contract for the exclusive right to sell and vend in his name with [[Demas Barnes]] and Company, which had taken out a [[copyright]] on the product on October 27, 1891.  The suit was dismissed in 1894, but another suit was brought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Stationer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2FdYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA461|year=1894|publisher=Howard Lockwood|page=461}}&lt;/ref&gt;  B.T. Hoogland's Sons next sued to stop Harry K. Gayetty and the Diamond Mills Paper Company from using the Gayetty name, and in this case they were successful.  Harry Gayetty appealed, but lost at the Appellate Court.&lt;ref name ="NES&amp;B"&gt;{{cite book|title=New England Stationer and Printer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mvFYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA70|year=1901|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally in July 1900, the [[New York Supreme Court]] permanently enjoined the Diamond Mills Paper Company and Harry K. Gayetty from using the name on any similar paper product labels.&lt;ref name ="NES&amp;B" /&gt;

In 1900, an advertisement shows that B.T. Hoogland's Sons of New York were distributing the watermarked "Papel Medicado De Gayetty" and giving credit to the invention of the paper in 1857 by Joseph C. Gayetty, Inventor.&lt;ref name = "Monthly"&gt;{{cite book|title=Monthly Bulletin of the International Bureau of the American Republics, International Union of American Republics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cCxMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA733|year=1900|publisher=The Bureau|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nearly the same advertisement was run in English in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Druggists Circular|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8XQgAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA7|year=1907|publisher=The Circular|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The product continued to be marketed until the 1920s.

'''Karl W. Steinbuch''' (June 15, 1917 in [[Stuttgart|Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt]] – June 4, 2005 in [[Ettlingen]]) was a German [[Computer science|computer scientist]],  [[Cybernetics|cyberneticist]], and [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineer]].  He was an early and influential researcher of German computer science, and was the developer of the [[Lernmatrix]], an early implementation of [[artificial neural network]]s. Steinbuch also wrote about the societal implications of modern media.

== Biography ==
Steinbuch studied at the [[University of Stuttgart]] and in 1944 he received his [[PhD]] in physics. In 1948 he joined [[:de:Standard Elektrik Lorenz|Standard Elektrik Lorenz]] (SEL, part of the [[ITT Corporation|ITT group]]) in [[Stuttgart]], as a computer design engineer and later as a director of [[research and development]], where he filed more than 70 [[patent]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} There Steinbuch completed the first European fully [[transistorized computer]], the ER 56 marketed by SEL.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1967 he began publishing books, in which he tried to influence German education policy. Together with books from colleagues like [[Jean Ziegler]] from Switzerland, [[Eric J. Hobsbawm]] from UK, and [[John Naisbitt]] his books{{which|date=January 2015}} predicted what he regarded as the coming education disaster of the emerging civic lobby society.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Steinbuch coined in 1957 the term ''Informatik'', the German word for computer science,&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cache/papers/cs2/334/http:zSzzSzhelios.informatik.uni-kl.dezSzeuology.pdf/unknown.pdf Karl Steinbuch Eulogy] - [[Bernard Widrow]], [[Reiner Hartenstein]], Robert Hecht-Nielsen&lt;/ref&gt; which gave ''[[informatics]]'', and the term [[:de:Kybernetische Anthropologie|kybernetische Anthropologie]] ({{PMID|16301776}}).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9713">'''Lead Market''' is a term used in innovation theory and denotes a country or region, which pioneers the successful adoption of an innovative design. It sends signalling effects to other "lag" markets, which in turn helps in triggering a process of global diffusion. Marian Beise, one of the foremost propounders of this theory as it has been understood so far, states: "Innovations that have been successful with local users in lead markets have a higher potential of becoming adopted world-wide than any other design preferred in other countries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beise|first=Marian|title=Lead Markets: Country-Specific Success Factors of the Global Diffusion of Innovations|journal=Research Policy|year=2004|volume=33|issue=6–7|pages=997–1018|doi=10.1016/j.respol.2004.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christoph Bartlett and Sumantra Ghoshal have described lead markets as "[…] markets that provide the stimuli for most global products and processes of a multinational company. Local innovations in such markets become useful elsewhere as the environmental characteristics that stimulated such innovations diffuse to other locations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett, C.|first=Ghoshal, S.|title=Managing innovation in the transnational corporation,in: Bartlett et al, 'Managing the Global Firm'|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=London|pages=215–255}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To illustrate a lead market with some examples, Germany can be seen as a lead market for renewable energies and (premium) automobiles, while the United States would suit as a lead market for information technologies including e-commerce.&lt;ref name=Beise_Book&gt;{{cite book|last=Beise|first=Marian|title=Lead Markets: Country-Specific Success Factors of the Global Diffusion of Innovations|year=2001|publisher=Physica-Verlag|location=Heidelberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead markets are thought to help reduce market and technology uncertainty in the process of new product development;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gerybadze|first=Alexander|author2=Reger, Guido |title=Globalization of R&amp;D: recent changes in the management of innovation in transnational corporations|journal=Research Policy|year=1999|volume=28|issue=2–3|pages=251–274|doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(98)00111-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and can be seen as an important driver for internationalization of research and development (R&amp;D).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sachwald|first=F.|title=Location choices within global innovation networks: the case of Europe|journal=Journal of Technology Transfer|year=2008|volume=33|issue=4|pages=364–378|doi=10.1007/s10961-007-9057-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead markets have been supposed to be characterized by factors such as high per capita income, high level of customer sophisitication, and a competitive "eco-system".&lt;ref name="Beise_Book" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jänicke|first=Martin|author2=Jacob, Klaus |title=Lead Markets for Environmental Innovations: A New Role for the Nation State|journal=Global Environmental Politics|year=2004|volume=4|issue=1|pages=29–46|doi=10.1162/152638004773730202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such factors are subsumed into 5 "groups of advantages", namely demand advantage, market structure advantage, cost advantage, export advantage, and transfer advantage.&lt;ref name="Beise_Book" /&gt; Some scholars have also spoken of a regulation advantage, which emanates from favourable government policies (cf. Rennings and Smidt, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rennings|first=Klaus|author2=Smidt, Wolfgang |title=A Lead Market Approach Towards the Emergence and Diffusion of Coal-fired Power Plant Technology|journal=Economica Politica|year=2010|volume=XXVII|pages=303–328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some other scholars have pointed towards regulation's impact on all other factors. For example, Tiwari and Herstatt (2012: 100) state: "[...] we consider it appropriate, not to treat regulation as a separate group since policy factors influence all other groups of advantages and are implicitly covered by them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tiwari|first=Rajnish|author2=Herstatt, Cornelius |title=Assessing India's lead market potential for cost-effective innovations|journal=Journal of Indian Business Research|year=2012|volume=4|issue=2|pages=97–115|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=17036170&amp;show=abstract|doi=10.1108/17554191211228029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of lead markets has been criticized for not being "consistent and stringent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cleff|first=Thomas|author2=Rennings, Klaus |title=Are there any first mover advantages for pioneering firms? Lead market oriented business strategies for environmental innovation|journal=Working Paper No. 2 within the project: Lead Markets Funded under the BMBF Programme "WIN 2"|year=2011|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; While conventional wisdom, due to its emphasis on customer affluence and sophistication as inducers of innovation, has tended to see lead markets exist in economically highly developed countries; recent research, notably by Rajnish Tiwari and Cornelius Herstatt of [[Hamburg University of Technology]] (e.g. [http://www.global-innovation.net/publications/PDF/Working_Paper_67.pdf Tiwari and Herstatt, 2011a], [http://www.global-innovation.net/publications/PDF/Working_Paper_69.pdf Tiwari and Herstatt, 2011b]), has emphasized the need to update/extend the lead market model to adjust it to the changing ground realities in the face of globalization and sustained economic growth in developing nations. Using examples of several [[frugal innovation]]s from India, and more specifically the case of small car industry in India's automotive sector, Rajnish Tiwari in his dissertation at Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH) has proposed that lead markets can emerge in developing nations as well provided the market size enables significant economies of scale and the country's innovation system is endowed with the necessary technological capabilities.&lt;ref name=Tiwari_Dissertation&gt;{{cite book|last=Tiwari|first=Rajnish|title=Emergence of Lead Markets in Developing Economies: An Examination on the Basis of ‘Small Car’ Segment in India’s Automobile Industry, Doctoral Thesis|year=2013|publisher=Institute for Technology and Innovation Management, Hamburg University of Technology|location=Hamburg}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two conditions, seen in conjunction with several other factors such as embeddedness in the international trade and access to open global innovation networks (OGINs),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tiwari|first=Rajnish|author2=Herstatt, Cornelius |title=Frugal Innovation: A Global Networks' Perspective|journal=Die Unternehmung (Swiss Journal of Business Research and Practice)|year=2012|volume=66|issue=3|pages=245–274}}&lt;/ref&gt; can in many instances compensate other typical drawbacks of developing countries, such as low purchasing power.&lt;ref name="Tiwari_Dissertation" /&gt; As a consequence, Tiwari's dissertation has proposed to update the model to include technology advantage in the model, while combining the export and transfer advantages as one single group. Factors within the individual groups of advantages have been also update/modified. The evolution of India's small car sector has also provided some valuable insights into possible emergence of a lead market in a country.&lt;ref name="Tiwari_Dissertation" /&gt; This model, if validated by further research, would help enable an [[ex ante]] analysis of lead markets, whereas so far mostly [[ex post]], macroeconomic analyses have been the norm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6749">[[File:Dr. Martin Tajmar.jpg|thumb|upright|Martin Tajmar&lt;br&gt;(2010)]] '''Martin Tajmar''' is a physicist and professor for Space Systems at the [[Dresden University of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tu-dresden.de/die_tu_dresden/fakultaeten/fakultaet_maschinenwesen/ilr/rfs/staff/portrait_englisch portrait_tajmar] tu-dresden.de&lt;/ref&gt; He has research interests in advanced [[Spacecraft propulsion|space propulsion]] systems, [[Field-emission electric propulsion|FEEP thrusters]], breakthrough propulsion physics and possible connections between gravity and superconductivity.&lt;ref name="Tajmar2006"/&gt;

== Biography ==

Tajmar completed his PhD in [[Plasma (physics)|numerical plasmaphysics]] at the [[Vienna University of Technology]], [[Austria]], in 1999, and is now an external lecturer for the university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilsb.tuwien.ac.at/~tajmar/ Home page and biography] at the Technical University of Vienna.&lt;/ref&gt; He also published the textbook ''Advanced Space Propulsion Systems'' in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|978-3-211-83862-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gravitomagnetism research ==

In a 2003 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | journal = Physica C | first1 = M. | last1 = Tajmar | first2 = C.J. | last2 = de Matos | date = 2003 | volume=385 | pages=551–554 |issue=1, number 4 |title = Coupling of Electromagnetism and Gravitation in the Weak Field Approximation|arxiv = gr-qc/0203033 |bibcode = 2003PhyC..385..551T |doi = 10.1016/S0921-4534(02)02305-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tajmar proposed that a gravitational effect may explain the long-standing discrepancy between the mass of [[Cooper pair]]s first measured in superconductors by [http://physics.oregonstate.edu/~tatej/ Janet Tate] ''et al.'' and the theoretically-expected value.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017|J. Tate, B. Cabrera, S. B. Felch, J. T. Anderson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 62, (8) 845 (1989).=}}

In 2006 Tajmar and several coworkers announced their claim to have measured a [[Gravitomagnetism|gravitomagnetic]] version of the [[frame-dragging]] effect caused by a [[superconductor]] with an accelerating or decelerating spin.&lt;ref name="Tajmar2006"&gt;{{cite arXiv | author=Tajmar, M. |author2=Plesescu, F. |author3=Marhold, K. |author4=de Matos, C.J. |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Experimental Detection of the Gravitomagnetic London Moment| date = 2006 |version= | eprint=gr-qc/0603033v1}}&lt;br&gt;Component descriptions and schematics are provided in the following two volumes:&lt;br&gt;*[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a461571.pdf 12.

In February 2008 Tajmar filed an international patent application for a "Process for the generation of a gravitational field and a gravitational field generator."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derstandard.at/?url=/?id=3210240|title=Patent für Gravitations-Generator angemeldet|author=Redaktion|work=derStandard.at|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, Tajmar reported a new phenomenon suggesting that signals could be induced in a gyroscope resulting from a new property of rotating low-temperature helium. He also reported that because the rings in the experiment were accelerated pneumatically, and not with high acceleration, the earlier reported results could not be discounted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/0806.2271 Anomalous Fiber Optic Gyroscope Signals Observed above Spinning Rings at Low Temperature] Arxiv.org&lt;/ref&gt; His further research suggests the anomaly may indeed be coming from liquid helium in the setup.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.1033 Fiber-Optic-Gyroscope Measurements Close to Rotating Liquid Helium]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mechanical, electrical and plumbing''' ('''MEP''') refers to these aspects of building design and construction.  In commercial buildings these aspects are often designed by an engineering firm specializing in MEP. MEP design is important for design decision-making, accurate documentation, performance and cost-estimation, construction planning, managing and operating the resulting facility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MEP makes engineering projects faster and reduces cost|url=https://www.ny-engineers.com/blog/how-mep-integration-makes-engineering-projects-faster-and-less-expensive|website=ny-engineers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Design and documentation ==
As with other aspect of buildings, MEP [[Technical drawing|drafting]], design and documentation were traditionally done manually.  [[Computer-aided design]] had some advantages over this, in some instances including [[3D modeling]].  [[Building information modeling]] provides holistic design and parametric change management of the MEP design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setty.com/pdf_presentations/RC_Whitepaper_Revit_Systems_BIM_for_MEP_Engine.pdf|title=Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing|website=Setty.com|publisher=Revit MEP:BIM for MEP Engineering|date=12 February 2013|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814101043/http://www.setty.com/pdf_presentations/RC_Whitepaper_Revit_Systems_BIM_for_MEP_Engine.pdf|archivedate=14 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medical Unit, Self-contained, Transportable''' (MUST) was a type of medical equipment system developed for field hospitals in the [[United States Army]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The system used inflatable shelters for ward and [[patient care]] space, and expandable shelters for operating rooms and other sections. They were powered by [[auxiliary power unit]]s which used [[JP-4]] as fuel, producing power and [[air conditioning]] for the hospital in addition to air to keep the shelters inflated. A 60 bed [[Mobile army surgical hospital (US)|surgical]] hospital in [[Vietnam]] could use up to 3,000 gallons of JP-4 per day to keep the hospital inflated and operational.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.army.mil/books/Vietnam/basedev/images-full/foto7.jpg/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procurement==
The units were manufactured by Missouri Research Manufacturing Company, Inflated Products Company, [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company]], [[Brunswick Corporation]], with spare parts supplied by [[Coats &amp; Clark|Coats &amp; Clark Company]] and Scoville Manufacturing Company (zippers,) Beckett Lace and [[Velcro]] (fasteners.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015082343339;view=1up;seq=105 Department of Defense Appropriations for 1983], pt. 8, pp. 103-107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
According to Major General [[Spurgeon Neel]], a commander of the [[44th Medical Brigade (United States)|44th Medical Brigade]] in [[South Vietnam]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/vietnam/medicalsupport/chapter4.html/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906190431/http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/vietnam/medicalsupport/chapter4.html |archivedate=2015-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;MUST-equipped surgical hospitals were operated for several years in Vietnam with mixed success. These units consisted of three basic elements, each of which could be airlifted and dispatched by truck or helicopter. The expandable surgical element was a self-contained, rigid-panel shelter with accordion sides. The air-inflatable ward element was a double-walled fabric shelter providing a free-space area for ward facilities. The utility element or power package contained a multifuel gas turbine engine which supplied electric power for air-conditioning, refrigeration, air heating and circulation, water heating and pumping, air pressure for the inflatable elements, and compressed air or suction. In addition, other expandables were used for central materiel supply, laboratory, X-ray, pharmacy, dental, and kitchen facilities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Meteor''' is a designation of a series of [[Poland|Polish]] [[sounding rocket]]s. The Meteor rockets were built between 1963 and 1974.

Meteor was the one and two stages meteorological rockets, using the solid fuel, constructed for the research of the top layers of terrestrial atmosphere, also directions and forces of winds from 18 to more than 50&amp;nbsp;km above the Earth surface. These rockets were designed by Polish engineers of Warsaw Aviation Institute (among them was Professor Jacek Walczewski and engineer [[Adam Obidziński]]) and had been produced by WZK-Mielec factory.

==The History==

The first launching site of the sounding rockets in Poland was Błędowska Desert, where since 1958 to 1963, the rockets of different types had been launched; among others RD and Rasko. During a flight, the biological experiment with earlier trained two white mouses was conducted (the RM-2D rocket achieved the altitude of 1580 meters).
 
Since 1965 to April 1970, the Meteor-1 rockets had been launched from "spaceport" located 5&amp;nbsp;km from [[Ustka]] town. This programme had been continued to 1974, when rockets were bearing out from the area of experimental center founded there during the years of the Second World War, located on west side of Łeba town. Currently, it is in the museum (the starting place with ramp and the radar bases).

There was 224 flights of "Meteor-1" rocket series (including prototypes). The valuable data both meteorological and connected with rocket techniques were found as the result of these researches.

The "Meteor-1", "Meteor-2H" and "Meteor 2K" (the largest civilian rocket developed in Poland) were single-stage rockets. The "Meteor 3" was a two-stage rocket, developed from "Meteor 1".

Meteor rockets had been launched from [[Łeba]] and [[Ustka]]. Five Meteor rockets missions were conducted around 1970 from [[Zingst]], in the former Eastern Germany. The programme of flights of Meteor-2 was finished during the same year, when Poland started to participate in [[Interkosmos]] research, using the Vertical rockets.

==Meteor-1==

One stage, but two units rocket called "Meteor-1" had the length of 2470&amp;nbsp;mm and the initial mass of 32.5&amp;nbsp;kg. The flight lasted for 80 second and reaching at the peak altitude of 36.5&amp;nbsp;km. The motor ignite for 2–3 seconds and reached the maximum velocity of 1100 meters per second. In 1965, 6 rockets of "Meteor-1" type was launched and after this time: 12 in 1966, 40 in 1967, 45 in 1968, 36 in 1969, 34 in 1970 and 4 in 1971.

The charge of metal dipoles was released by rockets and this material had later been observed on radar screens. It was the base of derivation of winds strength in the stratosphere and winds directions in the same atmospheric layer. After experiments that had been conducted in the years 1965-1966, during "The Year of the Quiet Sun", a cyclic pattern of variation in case of directions of these atmospheric flows was concluded.

==Meteor-2==

The one stage "Meteor-2K" was the most advanced version of the Meteor rocket. On 7 October 1970, the flight took place and reached the altitude of 90 kilometers. This rocket had been used as sounding of the ionosphere, reaching the level of boundary between D and E layers. 10 flights of this version were realized, when the measurements of temperature were made. The length of rocket frame is 4.5 meters and some are more longer than an English rocket, [[Petrel (rocket)|Petrel]] (in service since 1968). The "Meteor-2" had not been produced in serial way. The cost of this rocket prototype was eight times higher than for the copy of "Meteor-1". The weight of useful charge, in form of "RAMZES" recovery probe, is 10&amp;nbsp;kg.

==Meteor-3==

A two-stage rocket called "Meteor-3" was a developed version of "Meteor-1". The range of flight was increased and the rocket gained possibility of launching of few charges of dipoles. It can reach at ceiling altitudes between 67 and 74 kilometers. An idea of version "S" project had been considered. This model could be launch from airplane frame, about 5 kilometers above the surface.

==Meteor-4==

"Meteor-4" rocket has ten times more thrust than "Meteor-2". This version could reach above 100&amp;nbsp;km. According to design, this rocket is longer than 5 meters and had the initial total mass of 407&amp;nbsp;kg with useful weight of 10&amp;nbsp;kg. 175 seconds into the flight, it would reach at the altitude of 120 kilometers.

==Organization and activities==
===Censorship===
The ministry has "responsibility for all the Saudi media and other channels of information".&lt;ref name=Green-493/&gt; The ministry has been called the "main agent of censorship" in the kingdom.&lt;ref name=Green-493/&gt; It is charged with the purification of culture prior to it being permitted circulation to the public. A special unit, the management of publications department, "analyzes all publications and issues directives to newspapers and magazines" stating that way in which a given topic must be treated.&lt;ref name=Green-493&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathon Green|title=Encyclopedia of Censorship|date=2005|publisher=Infobase publishing|page=493|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bunHURgi7FcC&amp;pg=PA493&amp;dq=saudi+censorship++ministry+of+information&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n78xVJGBCJCsyATa74DgDA&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=saudi%20censorship%20%20ministry%20of%20information&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Censorship is strict enough for works of the minister of culture and information himself: the former minister Abdulaziz Khojah's own works of poetry were banned in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hanna Labonté|title=Saudi Man of Letters and Cautious Reformer|url=http://en.qantara.de/Saudi-Man-of-Letters-and-Cautious-Reformer/8370c162/index.html|accessdate=4 September 2012|work=Qantara|date=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other bodies===
The ministry also oversees the activities of the following bodies: King Fahd Cultural Centre, Administration of Folklore, Saudi Society for Culture and Arts, General Administration of Cultural Activities and Literary Clubs, and General Administration for Literary Clubs.&lt;ref name=rad/&gt; It is also responsible for the activities of the General Administration for Public Libraries and the General Administration for Cultural Relations.&lt;ref name=rad/&gt; The [[Saudi Press Agency]] is also part of the ministry.&lt;ref name=rad/&gt;

==History==
A proposal to establish an information ministry for Ukraine was first put forth on 30 November 2014 by [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ukraine)|Internal Affairs Ministry]] advisor [[Anton Herashchenko]].&lt;ref name="2DECMAS"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://mashable.com/2014/12/02/ukraine-ministry-of-truth/ | title=Ukraine just created its own version of Orwell's 'Ministry of Truth' | work=Mashable | date=2 December 2014 | accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that ministry could protect "Ukraine's information space from Russian propaganda and counter propaganda in Russia, in the temporarily occupied territories of Crimea and eastern Ukraine".&lt;ref name="2DECMAS" /&gt; The proposal was made amidst ongoing efforts to form a government, following the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2014|October 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election]].&lt;ref name="2DECMAS" /&gt; Ukrainian president [[Petro Poroshenko]] advocated for the establishment of such a ministry through the night on 1–2 December.&lt;ref name="2DECMAS" /&gt; It was quickly pushed through parliament with little fanfare. The formation of the [[Second Yatsenyuk Government]] was announced on 2 December, with Poroshenko ally [[Yuriy Stets]] confirmed as the first Minister for Information Policy.&lt;ref name="FLUYGIU21214"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2DECMAS"/&gt; One day after his appointment, Stets published the ministry's regulations, which were based on a draft he wrote in 2007–09.&lt;ref name="Journaleechnd"&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/kyiv-post-plus/journalists-media-rights-activists-demand-abolishing-of-newly-formed-ministry-of-truth-374003.html Journalists, free speech activists demand abolishing of newly-formed ‘Ministry of Truth’], [[Kyiv Post]] (4 December 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; According to these regulations, the ministry is meant to "develop and implement professional standards in the media sphere", "ensure freedom of speech", and prevent the spread of "incomplete, outdated, or unreal information.&lt;ref name="Journaleechnd"/&gt;

Prior to its establishment, many Ukrainian journalists protested the creation of the ministry.&lt;ref name="2DECMAS"/&gt;&lt;ref name=RFE141203&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-ministry-information-journalists-protest/26723352.html |title= 'No Big Brother!'

[[United States Ambassador to Ukraine]] [[Geoffrey Pyatt]] stated late January 2016 "It's a huge mistake to create a 'Ministry of Truth' that tries to generate alternative stories. That is not the way to defeat this [[information warfare]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/321326.html U.S. ambassador calls formation of 'Ministry of Truth' serious mistake, urges Ukraine to focus on progress and development], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (1 February 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Staff of the Ministry of Information Policy ==
The approved staff of the Ministry of Information Policy of Ukraine for 2015 includes 29 employees. Given the Ukrainian practice, the figure seems to be very small.However, the experience of many countries and contemporary understanding of management prove that these are the public institutions with a small staff working based on delegation principles, which are much more capable to implement global state tasks.

Despite strict requirements of Ukrainian legislation, the Ministry of Information Policy is able to successfully perform all assigned tasks with minimum resources." to "The approved staff of the Ministry of Information Policy of Ukraine for 2015 includes 29 employees, so we are a "lean and mean" department. Contemporary management strategies suggest that public institutions with a small staff working on delegated principles, can be highly effective to performing government tasks.

'''Multi-junction''' ('''MJ''') '''solar cells''' are [[solar cell]]s with multiple [[p–n junction]]s made of [[List of semiconductor materials|different semiconductor materials]]. Each material's p-n junction will produce electric current in response to different [[Electromagnetic spectrum|wavelengths of light]]. The use of multiple [[Semiconductor|semiconducting materials]] allows the absorbance of a broader range of wavelengths, improving the cell's sunlight to electrical energy conversion efficiency.

Traditional single-junction cells have a maximum theoretical [[solar cell efficiency|efficiency]] of 33.16%.&lt;ref name="Shockley-Queisser-Tables"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Tabulated Values of the Shockley-Queisser Limit for Single Junction Solar Cells|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X16001110 |journal = Solar Energy|date = 2016-02-08|pages = 139–147|volume = 130|doi = 10.1016/j.solener.2016.02.015 |language = EN|first = Sven|last = Rühle|bibcode = 2016SoEn..130..139R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically, an infinite number of junctions would have a limiting efficiency of 86.8% under highly concentrated sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Green | first=Martin A. | date=2003 | title=Third Generation Photovoltaics: Advanced Solar Energy Conversion | publisher=Springer | page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this efficiency is gained at the cost of increased complexity and manufacturing price. To date, their higher price and higher [[price-to-performance ratio]] have limited their use to special roles, notably in [[aerospace]] where their high [[power-to-weight ratio]] is desirable. In terrestrial applications, these solar cells are emerging in [[concentrator photovoltaics]] (CPV), with a growing number of installations around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/csp/concentrating_pv.html "Concentrating Photovoltaic Technology"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822161453/http://www.nrel.gov/csp/concentrating_pv.html |date=2011-08-22 }}, NREL&lt;/ref&gt;

Tandem fabrication techniques have been used to improve the performance of existing designs. In particular, the technique can be applied to lower cost [[thin-film solar cell]]s using [[amorphous silicon]], as opposed to conventional crystalline silicon, to produce a cell with about 10% efficiency that is lightweight and flexible. This approach has been used by several commercial vendors,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-solar.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/Energy_Production_EN.pdf "Uni-Solar Energy Production"], Uni-Solar&lt;/ref&gt; but these products are currently limited to certain niche roles, like roofing materials.

== Description ==

=== Basics of solar cells ===

[[File:Effetphotovoltaic.jpg|right|thumb|325px|Figure A. [[Band diagram]] illustration of the [[photovoltaic effect]]. [[Photon]]s give their energy to electrons in the depletion or quasi-neutral regions. These move from the [[valence band]] to the [[conduction band]]. Depending on the location, [[electron]]s and [[Electron hole|holes]] are accelerated by ''E&lt;sub&gt;drift&lt;/sub&gt;'', which gives generation [[photocurrent]], or by E&lt;sub&gt;scatt&lt;/sub&gt;, which gives scattering photocurrent.&lt;ref name=a7&gt;R.Delamare, O.Bulteel, D.Flandre, Conversion lumière/électricité: notions fondamentales et exemples de recherche&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Traditional photovoltaic cells are commonly composed of [[doping (semiconductor)|doped]] [[silicon]] with metallic contacts deposited on the top and bottom. The doping is normally applied to a thin layer on the top of the cell, producing a [[pn-junction]] with a particular [[bandgap]] energy, E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Photon]]s that hit the top of the solar cell are either reflected or transmitted into the cell. Transmitted photons have the potential to give their energy, ''hν'', to an [[electron]] if ''hν'' ≥ E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;, generating an electron-[[electron hole|hole]] pair.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_Xs6QgAACAAJ "Basic Photovoltaic Principles and Methods"], Technical Information Office, Solar Energy Research Institute (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; In the depletion region, the drift electric field ''E&lt;sub&gt;drift&lt;/sub&gt;'' accelerates both electrons and holes towards their respective n-doped and p-doped regions (up and down, respectively). The resulting [[electric current|current]] ''I&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' is called the generated [[photocurrent]]. In the quasi-neutral region, the scattering electric field E&lt;sub&gt;scatt&lt;/sub&gt; accelerates holes (electrons) towards the p-doped (n-doped) region, which gives a scattering photocurrent ''I&lt;sub&gt;pscatt&lt;/sub&gt;'' (''I&lt;sub&gt;nscatt&lt;/sub&gt;''). Consequently, due to the accumulation of [[electric charge|charge]]s, a potential ''V'' and a photocurrent ''I&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt;'' appear. The expression for this photocurrent is obtained by adding generation and scattering photocurrents: ''I&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; + I&lt;sub&gt;nscatt&lt;/sub&gt; + I&lt;sub&gt;pscatt&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The ''J-V'' characteristics (J is current density, i.e. current per unit area) of a solar cell under illumination are obtained by shifting the ''J-V'' characteristics of a [[diode]] in the dark downward by ''I&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt;''. Since solar cells are designed to supply power and not absorb it, the power ''P = V·I&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt;'' must be negative. Hence, the operating point ''(V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, J&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;)'' is located in the region where ''V''&gt;0 and ''I&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;0, and chosen to maximize the [[absolute value]] of the power |''P''|.&lt;ref name=a9&gt;{{cite book|url=http://sunlab.eecs.uottawa.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/pdf/HiEfficMjSc-CurrStatusFuturePotential.pdf|author=N.V.Yastrebova|title=High-efficiency multi-junction solar cells: current status and future potential|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Loss mechanisms ===

[[File:ShockleyQueisserFullCurve.svg|thumb|The [[Shockley-Queisser limit]] for the efficiency of a single-junction solar cell. It is essentially impossible for a single-junction solar cell, under unconcentrated sunlight, to have more than ~34% efficiency. A multi-junction cell, however, can exceed that limit.]]

The theoretical performance of a solar cell was first studied in depth in the 1960s, and is today known as the [[Shockley–Queisser limit]]. The limit describes several loss mechanisms that are inherent to any solar cell design.

The first are the losses due to [[blackbody radiation]], a loss mechanism that affects any material object above [[absolute zero]]. In the case of solar cells at [[standard temperature and pressure]], this loss accounts for about 7% of the power. The second is an effect known as "recombination", where the [[electron]]s created by the [[photoelectric effect]] meet the [[electron hole]]s left behind by previous excitations. In silicon, this accounts for another 10% of the power.

However, the dominant loss mechanism is the inability of a solar cell to extract all of the power in the [[light]], and the associated problem that it cannot extract any power at all from certain photons. This is due to the fact that the photons must have enough energy to overcome the bandgap of the material.

If the photon has less energy than the bandgap, it is not collected at all. This is a major consideration for conventional solar cells, which are not sensitive to most of the [[infrared]] spectrum, although that represents almost half of the power coming from the sun. Conversely, photons with more energy than the bandgap, say blue light, initially eject an electron to a state high above the bandgap, but this extra energy is lost through collisions in a process known as "relaxation". This lost energy turns into heat in the cell, which has the side-effect of further increasing blackbody losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Third Generation Photovoltaics|last=Green|first=M.A.|year=2003|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=978-3-540-26562-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combining all of these factors, the maximum efficiency for a single-bandgap material, like conventional silicon cells, is about 34%. That is, 66% of the energy in the sunlight hitting the cell will be lost. Practical concerns further reduce this, notably reflection off the front surface or the metal terminals, with modern high-quality cells at about 22%.

Lower, also called narrower, bandgap materials will convert longer wavelength, lower energy photons.  Higher, or wider bandgap materials will convert shorter wavelength, higher energy light. An analysis of the [[AM1.5]] spectrum, shows the best balance is reached at about 1.1&amp;nbsp;eV (about 1100&amp;nbsp;nm, in the near infrared), which happens to be very close to the natural bandgap in silicon and a number of other useful semiconductors.

=== Multi-junction cells ===

Cells made from multiple materials layers can have multiple bandgaps and will therefore respond to multiple light wavelengths, capturing and converting some of the energy that would otherwise be lost to relaxation as described above.

For instance, if one had a cell with two bandgaps in it, one tuned to red light and the other to green, then the extra energy in green, cyan and blue light would be lost only to the bandgap of the green-sensitive material, while the energy of the red, yellow and orange would be lost only to the bandgap of the red-sensitive material. Following analysis similar to those performed for single-bandgap devices, it can be demonstrated that the perfect bandgaps for a two-gap device are at 1.1 eV and 1.8 eV.&lt;ref name=super&gt;[http://www.superstrate.net/pv/limit/tandem.html "Tandem solar cells"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conveniently, light of a particular wavelength does not interact strongly with materials that are of bigger bandgap. This means that you can make a multi-junction cell by layering the different materials on top of each other, shortest wavelengths (biggest bandgap) on the "top" and increasing through the body of the cell. As the photons have to pass through the cell to reach the proper layer to be absorbed, [[Transparent conducting film|transparent conductors]] need to be used to collect the electrons being generated at each layer.

[[File:StructureMJetspectre.png|thumb|550px|Figure C. (a) The structure of an MJ solar cell. There are six important types of layers: pn junctions, back surface field (BSF) layers, window layers, tunnel junctions, [[anti-reflective coating]] and metallic contacts. (b) Graph of spectral irradiance E vs. wavelength λ over the [[Air mass coefficient|AM]]1.5 solar spectrum, together with the maximum electricity conversion efficiency for every junction as a function of the wavelength.&lt;ref name=a9 /&gt;]]

Producing a tandem cell is not an easy task, largely due to the thinness of the materials and the difficulties extracting the current between the layers. The easy solution is to use two mechanically separate [[thin film solar cell]]s and then wire them together separately outside the cell. This technique is widely used by [[amorphous silicon]] solar cells, [[Uni-Solar]]'s products use three such layers to reach efficiencies around 9%. Lab examples using more exotic thin-film materials have demonstrated efficiencies over 30%.&lt;ref name=super/&gt;

The more difficult solution is the "monolithically integrated" cell, where the cell consists of a number of layers that are mechanically and electrically connected. These cells are much more difficult to produce because the electrical characteristics of each layer have to be carefully matched. In particular, the photocurrent generated in each layer needs to be matched, otherwise electrons will be absorbed between layers. This limits their construction to certain materials, best met by the III-V semiconductors.&lt;ref name=super/&gt;

==== Material choice ====

The choice of materials for each sub-cell is determined by the requirements for lattice-matching, current-matching, and high performance opto-electronic properties.

For optimal growth and resulting crystal quality, the crystal lattice constant ''a'' of each material must be closely matched, resulting in lattice-matched devices. This constraint has been relaxed somewhat in recently developed [[Solar cell research#Metamorphic multi-junction solar cell|metamorphic solar cells]] which contain a small degree of lattice mismatch. However, a greater degree of mismatch or other growth imperfections can lead to crystal defects causing a degradation in electronic properties.

Since each sub-cell is connected electrically in series, the same current flows through each junction. The materials are ordered with decreasing [[bandgap]]s, E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;, allowing sub-bandgap light (''hc/λ &lt; e·E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'') to transmit to the lower sub-cells. Therefore, suitable bandgaps must be chosen such that the design spectrum will balance the current generation in each of the sub-cells, achieving current matching. Figure C(b) plots [[spectral irradiance]] ''E''(λ), which is the source power density at a given [[wavelength]] λ. It is plotted together with the maximum conversion efficiency for every junction as a function of the wavelength, which is directly related to the number of photons available for conversion into photocurrent.

Finally, the layers must be electrically optimal for high performance. This necessitates usage of materials with strong absorption coefficients α(λ), high minority carrier lifetimes τ&lt;sub&gt;minority&lt;/sub&gt;, and high mobilities µ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miles|first1=R|title=Photovoltaic solar cells: Choice of materials and production methods|journal=Vacuum|volume=80|issue=10|pages=1090–1097|year=2006|doi=10.1016/j.vacuum.2006.01.006 |bibcode = 2006Vacuu..80.1090M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The favorable values in the table below justify the choice of materials typically used for multi-junction solar cells: [[InGaP]] for the top sub-cell (E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.8 − 1.9 eV), [[InGaAs]] for the middle sub-cell (E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.4 eV), and [[Germanium]] for the bottom sub-cell (E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.67 eV). The use of Ge is mainly due to its lattice constant, robustness, low cost, abundance, and ease of production.

Because the different layers are closely lattice-matched, the fabrication of the device typically employs [[metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy|metal-organic chemical vapor deposition]] (MOCVD). This technique is preferable to the [[molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE) because it ensures high [[crystal]] quality and large scale production.&lt;ref name=a9 /&gt;

=== Structural elements ===

==== Metallic contacts ====

The metallic contacts are low-resistivity [[electrodes]] that make contact with the semiconductor layers.  They are often [[aluminum]].  This provides an electrical connection to a load or other parts of a solar cell array.  They are usually on two sides of the cell. And are important to be on the back face so that shadowing on the lighting surface is reduced.

==== Anti-reflective coating ====

[[Anti-reflective coating|Anti-reflective]] (AR) coating is generally composed of several layers in the case of MJ solar cells. The top AR layer has usually a [[NaOH]] surface texturation with several [[pyramid]]s in order to increase the transmission coefficient ''T'', the trapping of the light in the material (because photons cannot easily get out the MJ structure due to pyramids) and therefore, the path length of photons in the material.&lt;ref name=a7 /&gt; On the one hand, the thickness of each AR layer is chosen to get destructive interferences. Therefore, the reflection coefficient ''R'' decreases to 1%. In the case of two AR layers ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' (the top layer, usually {{chem|SiO|2}}) and ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' (usually {{chem|TiO|2}}), there must be &lt;math&gt;n_{L2} = n_{AlInP}^{1/2} \cdot n_{L1}&lt;/math&gt; to have the same amplitudes for reflected fields and ''n&lt;sub&gt;L1&lt;/sub&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;L1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 4λ&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;,''n&lt;sub&gt;L2&lt;/sub&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;L2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = λ&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;/4 to have opposite phase for reflected fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strehlke|first1=S|last2=Bastide|first2=S|last3=Guillet|first3=J|last4=Levyclement|first4=C|title=Design of porous silicon antireflection coatings for silicon solar cells|journal=Materials Science and Engineering B|volume=69–70|pages=81–86|year=2000|doi=10.1016/S0921-5107(99)00272-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the thickness of each AR layer is also chosen to minimize the reflectance at wavelengths for which the photocurrent is the lowest. Consequently, this maximizes ''J&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;'' by matching currents of the three subcells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/1099-159X(200011/12)8:6&lt;563::AID-PIP327&gt;3.0.CO;2-8|author=Daniel J.Aiken|journal=Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications|volume=8|title=Antireflection coating design for multi-junction, series interconnected solar cells|year=2000|issue=6|pages=563–570|url=http://photovoltaics.sandia.gov/docs/PDF/aikencell.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721061827/http://photovoltaics.sandia.gov/docs/PDF/aikencell.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As example, because the current generated by the bottom cell is greater than the currents generated by the other cells, the thickness of AR layers is adjusted so that the infrared (IR) transmission (which corresponds to the bottom cell) is degraded while the [[ultraviolet]] transmission (which corresponds to the top cell) is upgraded. Particularly, an AR coating is very important at low wavelengths because, without it, ''T'' would be strongly reduced to 70%.

==== Tunnel junctions ====

[[File:Tunneljunction.jpg|thumb|300px|Figure D: Layers and [[band diagram]] of the tunnel junction. Because the length of the depletion region is narrow and the band gap is high, electrons can tunnel.]]

The main goal of [[tunnel junction]]s is to provide a low [[electrical resistance]] and optically low-loss connection between two subcells.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yamaguchi|first1=M|last2=Takamoto|first2=T|last3=Araki|first3=K|title=Super high-efficiency multi-junction and concentrator solar cells|journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|volume=90|issue=18–19|pages=3068–3077|year=2006|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2006.06.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without it, the p-doped region of the top cell would be directly connected with the n-doped region of the middle cell. Hence, a pn junction with opposite direction to the others would appear between the top cell and the middle cell. Consequently, the [[surface photovoltage|photovoltage]] would be lower than if there would be no parasitic [[diode]]. In order to decrease this effect, a tunnel junction is used.&lt;ref name=a2&gt;J.F.Klem, S.Park, J.C.Zolper, Semiconductor tunnel junction with enhancement layer, {{US Patent|5679963}}(1997)&lt;/ref&gt; It is simply a wide band gap, highly doped diode. The high doping reduces the length of the depletion region because

: &lt;math&gt;l_{depl} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \epsilon (\phi_0 - V)}{q} \frac{N_A+N_D}{N_A N_D}}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, electrons can easily tunnel through the depletion region. The J-V characteristic of the tunnel junction is very important because it explains why tunnel junctions can be used to have a low electrical resistance connection between two pn junctions. Figure D shows three different regions: the tunneling region, the negative differential resistance region and the thermal diffusion region. The region where electrons can tunnel through the barrier is called the tunneling region. There, the voltage must be low enough so that energy of some electrons who are tunneling is equal to energy states available on the other side of the barrier. Consequently, current density through the tunnel junction is high (with maximum value of &lt;math&gt;J_P&lt;/math&gt;, the peak current density) and the slope near the origin is therefore steep. Then, the resistance is extremely low and consequently, the [[voltage]] too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=AlGaAs Tunnel Junction for high efficiency multi-junction solar cells: simulation and measurement of temperature-dependent operation|url=http://sunlab.site.uottawa.ca/pdf/conferences/PVSC2009_JWheeldon_AlGaAsTjHiEfficMjSc-Sim&amp;MeasTDep.pdf|year=2009|author=J.F.Wheeldon|displayauthors=etal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091117044306/http://sunlab.site.uottawa.ca/pdf/conferences/PVSC2009_JWheeldon_AlGaAsTjHiEfficMjSc-Sim%26MeasTDep.pdf|archivedate=2009-11-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is why tunnel junctions are ideal for connecting two pn junctions without having a voltage drop. When voltage is higher, electrons cannot cross the barrier because energy states are no longer available for electrons. Therefore, the current density decreases and the differential resistance is negative. The last region, called thermal diffusion region, corresponds to the J-V characteristic of the usual diode:

: &lt;math&gt;J = J_S \left(\exp\left(\frac{qV}{kT}\right) - 1\right)&lt;/math&gt;

In order to avoid the reduction of the MJ solar cell performances, tunnel junctions must be transparent to wavelengths absorbed by the next photovoltaic cell, the middle cell, i.e. E&lt;sub&gt;gTunnel&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; E&lt;sub&gt;gMiddleCell&lt;/sub&gt;.

==== Window layer and back-surface field ====

[[File:Bsfwindow.jpg|left|thumb|500px|Figure E: (a) Layers and [[band diagram]] of a window layer. The surface recombination is reduced. (b) Layers and band diagram of a BSF layer. The scattering of carriers is reduced.]]

A window layer is used in order to reduce the surface recombination velocity ''S''. Similarly, a back-surface field (BSF) layer reduces the scattering of carriers towards the tunnel junction. The structure of these two layers is the same: it is a [[heterojunction]] which catches electrons (holes). Indeed, despite the [[electric field]] ''E&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'', these cannot jump above the barrier formed by the heterojunction because they don't have enough energy, as illustrated in figure E. Hence, electrons (holes) cannot recombine with holes (electrons) and cannot diffuse through the barrier. By the way, window and BSF layers must be transparent to wavelengths absorbed by the next pn junction i.e. E&lt;sub&gt;gWindow&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; E&lt;sub&gt;gEmitter&lt;/sub&gt; and E&lt;sub&gt;gBSF&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; E&lt;sub&gt;gEmitter&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, the lattice constant must be close to the one of InGaP and the layer must be highly doped (''n'' ≥ 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=a3&gt;{{harvnb|Luque|Hegedus|2003|p=390 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== J-V characteristic ===

For maximum efficiency, each subcell should be operated at its optimal J-V parameters, which are not necessarily equal for each subcell. If they are different, the total current through the solar cell is the lowest of the three. By approximation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peharz|first1=G.|last2=Siefer|first2=G.|last3=Bett|first3=A.W.|title=A simple method for quantifying spectral impacts on multi-junction solar cells|journal=Solar Energy|volume=83|issue=9|pages=1588–1598|year=2009|doi=10.1016/j.solener.2009.05.009 |bibcode=2009SoEn...83.1588P}}&lt;/ref&gt; it results in the same relationship for the short-circuit current of the MJ solar cell: ''J&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt; = min (J&lt;sub&gt;SC1&lt;/sub&gt;, J&lt;sub&gt;SC2&lt;/sub&gt;, J&lt;sub&gt;SC3&lt;/sub&gt;)'' where ''J&lt;sub&gt;SCi&lt;/sub&gt;''(λ) is the short-circuit current density at a given wavelength λ for the subcell ''i''.

Because of the impossibility to obtain ''J&lt;sub&gt;SC1&lt;/sub&gt;, J&lt;sub&gt;SC2&lt;/sub&gt;, J&lt;sub&gt;SC3&lt;/sub&gt;'' directly from the total J-V characteristic, the quantum efficiency ''QE''(λ) is utilized. It measures the ratio between the amount of electron-hole pairs created and the incident photons at a given wavelength λ. Let φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(λ) be the photon flux of corresponding incident light in subcell ''i''and''QE''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(λ) be the quantum efficiency of the subcell ''i''. By definition, this equates to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Lei|last2=Chen|first2=Nuofu|last3=Bai|first3=Yiming|last4=Cui|first4=Ming|last5=Zhang|first5=Han|last6=Gao|first6=Fubao|last7=Yin|first7=Zhigang|last8=Zhang|first8=Xingwang|title=Quantum efficiency and temperature coefficients of GaInP/GaAs dual-junction solar cell|journal=Science China Technological Sciences|volume=52|issue=5|pages=1176–1180|year=2008|doi=10.1007/s11431-008-0203-9|url=http://dspace.imech.ac.cn/handle/311007/26704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;QE_i(\lambda) = \frac{J_{SCi}(\lambda)}{q \phi_i(\lambda)} \Rightarrow J_{SCi} = \int_{0}^{\lambda2} q \phi_i(\lambda) QE_i(\lambda) \, d \lambda&lt;/math&gt;

The value of &lt;math&gt;QE_i(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; is obtained by linking it with the absorption coefficient &lt;math&gt;\alpha(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the number of photons absorbed per unit of length by a material. If it is assumed that each photon absorbed by a subcell creates an electron/hole pair (which is a good approximation), this leads to:&lt;ref name=a3 /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;QE_i(\lambda) = 1 - e^{-\alpha(\lambda) d_i}&lt;/math&gt; where ''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the thickness of the subcell ''i'' and &lt;math&gt;e^{-\alpha(\lambda) d_i}&lt;/math&gt; is the percentage of incident light which is not absorbed by the subcell ''i''.

Similarly, because

: &lt;math&gt;V = \sum_{i=1}^3 V_i&lt;/math&gt;, the following approximation can be used: &lt;math&gt;V_{OC} = \sum_{i=1}^3 V_{OCi}&lt;/math&gt;.

The values of &lt;math&gt;V_{OCi}&lt;/math&gt; are then given by the J-V diode equation:

: &lt;math&gt;J_i = J_{0i} \left(e^{\frac{qV_i}{kT}}-1\right)-J_{SCi} \Rightarrow V_{OCi} \approx \frac{kT}{q} \ln(\frac{J_{SCi}}{J_{0i}})&lt;/math&gt;

=== Theoretical limiting efficiency ===

We can estimate the limiting efficiency of ideal infinite multi-junction solar cells using the graphical quantum-efficiency (QE) analysis invented by C. H. Henry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henry|first1=C. H.|title=Limiting efficiencies of ideal single and multiple energy gap terrestrial solar cells| journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=51|issue=8|page=4494|year=1980|bibcode=1980JAP....51.4494H|doi=10.1063/1.328272}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To fully take advantage of Henry's method, the unit of the AM1.5 spectral irradiance should be converted to that of photon flux (i.e., number of photons/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s). To do that, it is necessary to carry out an intermediate unit conversion from the power of electromagnetic radiation incident per unit area per photon energy to the photon flux per photon energy (i.e., from [W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/eV] to [number of photons/m&lt;big&gt;2&lt;/big&gt;/s/eV]). For this intermediate unit conversion, the following points have to be considered: A photon has a distinct energy which is defined as follows.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(1): E&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt; = h∙f = h∙(c/λ)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
where E&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt; is photon energy, h is Planck's constant (h = 6.626*10&lt;sup&gt;−34&lt;/sup&gt; [J∙s]), c is speed of light (c = 2.998*10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; [m/s]), f is frequency [1/s], and λ is wavelength [nm].

Then the photon flux per photon energy, dn&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt;/dhν, with respect to certain irradiance E [W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/eV] can be calculated as follows.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(2): &lt;math&gt;\frac{dn_{ph}}{dhv} \, = \frac{E}{E_{ph}} \,&lt;/math&gt; = E/{h∙(c/λ)} = E[W/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;∙eV)]∙λ∙(10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; [m])/(1.998∙10&lt;sup&gt;−25&lt;/sup&gt; [J∙s∙m/s]) = E∙λ∙5.03∙10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; [(# of photons)/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;∙s∙eV)] &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a result of this intermediate unit conversion, the AM1.5 spectral irradiance is given in unit of the photon flux per photon energy, [number of photons/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s/eV], as shown in Figure 1.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
Fig._1_Photon_flux_per_photon_energy_vs._photon_energy.tif|Figure 1. Photon flux per photon energy from standard solar energy spectrum (AM of 1.5).
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Based on the above result from the intermediate unit conversion, we can derive the photon flux by numerically integrating the photon flux per photon energy with respect to photon energy. The numerically integrated photon flux is calculated using the Trapezoidal rule, as follows.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(3): &lt;math&gt;n_{ph}(E_g) = \int_{E_g}^{\infty} \frac{dn_{ph}}{dhv} \, dhv = \sum_{i= E_g }^{\infty}(hv_{i+1} - hv_i) \frac{1}{2} (\frac{dn_{ph}}{dhv} (hv_{i+1}) + \frac{dn_{ph}}{dhv} (hv_i)) \,&lt;/math&gt;

As a result of this numerical integration, the AM1.5 spectral irradiance is given in unit of the photon flux, [number of photons/m2/s], as shown in Figure 2.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
Fig. 2 Photon flux vs. photon energy.tif|Figure 2. Photon flux from standard solar energy spectrum (AM of 1.5).
&lt;/gallery&gt;
It is should be noted that there are no photon flux data in the small photon energy range from 0 eV to 0.3096 eV because the standard (AM1.5) solar energy spectrum for hν &lt; 0.31 eV are not available. Regardless of this data unavailability, however, the graphical QE analysis can be done using the only available data with a reasonable assumption that semiconductors are opaque for photon energies greater than their bandgap energy, but transparent for photon energies less than their bandgap energy. This assumption accounts for the first intrinsic loss in the efficiency of solar cells, which is caused by the inability of single-junction solar cells to properly match the broad solar energy spectrum.
However, the current graphical QE analysis still cannot reflect the second intrinsic loss in the efficiency of solar cells, radiative recombination. To take the radiative recombination into account, we need to evaluate the radiative current density, J&lt;sub&gt;rad&lt;/sub&gt;, first. According to Shockley and Queisser method,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Shockley|first1=W|last2=Queisser|first2=H.A.|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=32|issue=3|page=510|year=1961|doi=10.1063/1.1736034|title=Detailed Balance Limit of Efficiency of p-n Junction Solar Cells|bibcode = 1961JAP....32..510S }}&lt;/ref&gt;
J&lt;sub&gt;rad&lt;/sub&gt; can be approximated as follows.

(4): &lt;math&gt;J_{rad} = A exp(\frac{eV - E_g}{kT}) \,&lt;/math&gt;

(5): &lt;math&gt;A = \frac{2\pi\,exp(n^2+1)E_g^2kT}{h^3c^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; is in electron volts and n is evaluated to be 3.6, the value for GaAs. The incident absorbed thermal radiation J&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; is given by J&lt;sub&gt;rad&lt;/sub&gt; with V = 0.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(6): &lt;math&gt;J_{th} = A exp(\frac{-E_g}{kT}) \,&lt;/math&gt;

The current density delivered to the load is the difference of the current densities due to absorbed solar and thermal radiation and the current density of radiation emitted from the top surface or absorbed in the substrate. Defining J&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt; = en&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt;, we have

(7): J = J&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt; + J&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; − J&lt;sub&gt;rad&lt;/sub&gt;

The second term, J&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;, is negligible compared to J&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt; for all semiconductors with E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;. ≥ 0.3 eV, as can be shown by evaluation of the above J&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; equation. Thus, we will neglect this term to simplify the following discussion. Then we can express J as follows.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(8): &lt;math&gt;J =en_{ph} - A exp(\frac{eV - E_g}{kT}) \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The open-circuit voltage is found by setting J = 0.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(9): &lt;math&gt;eV_{OC} =E_g - kT ln(\frac{A}{en_{ph}}) \,&lt;/math&gt;

The maximum power point (J&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) is found by stetting the derivative &lt;math&gt;\frac{dJV}{dV} \, = 0&lt;/math&gt;. The familiar result of this calculation is&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(10): &lt;math&gt;eV_{m} =eV_{OC} - kT ln(1+\frac{eV_m}{kT}) \,&lt;/math&gt;

(11): &lt;math&gt;J_{m} = \frac{en_{ph}}{1+kT/eV_m} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the maximum work (W&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) done per absorbed photon, Wm is given by&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(12): &lt;math&gt;W_{m} = \frac{J_mV_m}{n_{ph}} \, = \frac{eV_{m}}{1+kT/eV_m} \, = eV_m - kT&lt;/math&gt;

Combining the last three equations, we have&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(13): &lt;math&gt;W_{m} = E_g - kT[ln(\frac{A}{en_{ph}}) + ln(1 + \frac{eV_{m}}{kT}) + 1] \,&lt;/math&gt;

Using the above equation, W&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; (red line) is plotted in Figure 3 for different values of E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; (or n&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
Fig. 3 Maximum Work by Multi-Junction Solar Cells.tif|Figure 3. Maximum work by ideal infinite multi-junction solar cells under standard AM1.5 spectral irradiance.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Now, we can fully use Henry's graphical QE analysis, taking into account the two major intrinsic losses in the efficiency of solar cells. The two main intrinsic losses are radiative recombination, and the inability of single junction solar cells to properly match the broad solar energy spectrum. The shaded area under the red line represents the maximum work done by ideal infinite multi-junction solar cells. Hence, the limiting efficiency of ideal infinite multi-junction solar cells is evaluated to be 68.8% by comparing the shaded area defined by the red line with the total photon-flux area determined by the black line. (This is why this method is called "graphical" QE analysis.) Although this limiting efficiency value is consistent with the values published by Parrott and Vos in 1979: 64% and 68.2% respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vos|first1=A. D.| journal=Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics|volume=13|issue=5|pages=839–846|year=1980|doi=10.1088/0022-3727/13/5/018|title=Detailed balance limit of the efficiency of tandem solar cells|bibcode = 1980JPhD...13..839D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parrott|first1=J.| journal=Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics|volume=12|issue=3|pages=441–450|year=1979|doi=10.1088/0022-3727/12/3/014|title=The limiting efficiency of an edge-illuminated multigap solar cell|bibcode = 1979JPhD...12..441P }}&lt;/ref&gt;
there is a small gap between the estimated value in this report and literature values. This minor difference is most likely due to the different ways how to approximate the photon flux from 0 eV to 0.3096 eV. Here, we approximated the photon flux from 0 eV to 0.3096 eV as the same as the photon flux at 0.31 eV.

== Materials ==

The majority of multi-junction cells that have been produced to date use three layers (although many tandem a-Si:H/mc-Si modules have been produced and are widely available). However, the triple junction cells require the use of semiconductors that can be tuned to specific frequencies, which has led to most of them being made of [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) compounds, often germanium for the bottom-, GaAs for the middle-, and GaInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for the top-cell.

Dual junction cells can be made on Gallium arsenide wafers.  Alloys of [[Indium gallium phosphide]] in the range In&lt;sub&gt;.5&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;.5&lt;/sub&gt;P through In&lt;sub&gt;.53&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;.47&lt;/sub&gt;P serve as the high band gap alloy.  This alloy range provides for the ability to have band gaps in the range of 1.92eV to 1.87eV.  The lower [[GaAs]] junction has a band gap of 1.42eV.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

=== Germanium substrate ===

Triple junction cells consisting of [[indium gallium phosphide]] (InGaP), [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) or [[indium gallium arsenide]] (InGaAs) and [[germanium]] (Ge) can be fabricated on germanium wafers. Early cells used straight gallium arsenide in the middle junction. Later cells have utilized In&lt;sub&gt;0.015&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;0.985&lt;/sub&gt;As, due to the better lattice match to Ge, resulting in a lower defect density.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Due to the huge band gap difference between GaAs (1.42eV), and Ge (0.66eV), the current match is very poor, with the Ge junction operated significantly current limited.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

[[Indium phosphide]] may be used as a substrate to fabricate cells with band gaps between 1.35eV and 0.74eV.  Indium Phosphide has a band gap of 1.35eV.  [[Indium gallium arsenide]] (In&lt;sub&gt;0.53&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;0.47&lt;/sub&gt;As) is lattice matched to Indium Phosphide with a band gap of 0.74eV.  A quaternary alloy of Indium gallium arsenide phosphide can be lattice matched for any band gap in between the two.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Indium phosphide-based cells have the potential to work in tandem with gallium arsenide cells. The two cells can be optically connected in series (with the InP cell below the GaAs cell), or in parallel through the use of spectra splitting using a [[Dichroic filter]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

=== Indium gallium nitride substrate ===

[[Indium gallium nitride]] (InGaN) is a semiconductor material made of a mix of gallium nitride (GaN) and indium nitride (InN). It is a ternary group III/V [[direct bandgap]] semiconductor. Its bandgap can be tuned by varying the amount of indium in the alloy from 0.7&amp;nbsp;eV to 3.4&amp;nbsp;eV, thus making it an ideal material for solar cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kuykendall |first1=T. |last2=Ulrich |first2=Philipp |last3=Aloni |first3=Shaul |last4=Yang |first4=Peidong |title=Complete compositional tunability of InGaN nanowires using a combinatorial approach |journal=Nature Materials |volume=6 |issue=12 |doi= 10.1038/nmat2037 |year=2007 |pages=951–956|bibcode = 2007NatMa...6..951K |pmid=17965718}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its conversion efficiencies because of technological factors unrelated to bandgap are still not high enough to be competitive in the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McLaughlin |first1=D.V.P. |last2=Pearce |first2=J.M. |year=2013 |title=Progress in Indium Gallium Nitride Materials for Solar Photovoltaic Energy Conversion |url=https://www.academia.edu/2635794 |journal=Metallurgical and Materials Transactions A |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=1947–1954 |doi=10.1007/s11661-013-1622-1|bibcode = 2013MMTA...44.1947M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yam |first1=F.K. |last2=Hassan |first2=Z. |date=2008 |title=InGaN: An overview of the growth kinetics, physical properties and emission mechanisms |journal=Superlattices and Microstructures |volume=43 |issue=1|pages=1 |bibcode=2008SuMi...43....1Y |doi=10.1016/j.spmi.2007.05.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structure ===

Many MJ photovoltaic cells use [[III-V semiconductor]] materials. GaAsSb-based heterojunction tunnel diodes, instead of conventional InGaP highly doped tunnel diodes described above, have a lower tunneling distance. Indeed, in the heterostructure formed by GaAsSb and [[Indium gallium arsenide|InGaAs]], the valence band of GaAsSb is higher than the valence band of the adjoining p-doped layer.&lt;ref name=a2 /&gt; Consequently, the tunneling distance ''d&lt;sub&gt;tunnel&lt;/sub&gt;'' is reduced and so the tunneling current, which exponentially depends of ''d&lt;sub&gt;tunnel&lt;/sub&gt;'', is increased. Hence, the voltage is lower than that of the InGaP tunnel junction.
GaAsSb heterojunction tunnel diodes offer other advantages. The same current can be achieved by using a lower doping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=J.C. Zolper|journal=Proceedings of 1994 IEEE 1st World Conference on Photovoltaic Energy Conversion - WCPEC (A Joint Conference of PVSC, PVSEC and PSEC)|doi=10.1109/WCPEC.1994.520724|year=1994|page=1843|volume=2|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10107906-3FIrKs/webviewable/|author2=and others|displayauthors=1|title=Ga ''As'' ''Sb''-based heterojunction tunnel diodes for tandem solar cell interconnects|last3=Plut|last4=Tigges|isbn=978-0-7803-1460-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, because the lattice constant is larger for GaAsSb than Ge, one can use a wider range of materials for the bottom cell because more materials are lattice-matched to GaAsSb than to Ge.&lt;ref name=a2/&gt;

Chemical components can be added to some layers. Adding about one percent of [[Indium]] in each layer better matches lattice constants of the different layers.&lt;ref name=a6&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yamaguchi|first1=M|last2=Takamoto|first2=T|last3=Araki|first3=K|last4=Ekinsdaukes|first4=N|title=Multi-junction III–V solar cells: current status and future potential|journal=Solar Energy|volume=79|issue=1|pages=78–85|year=2005|doi=10.1016/j.solener.2004.09.018 |bibcode=2005SoEn...79...78Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without it, there is about 0.08 percent of mismatching between layers, which inhibits performance. Adding aluminium to the top cell increases its band gap to 1.96&amp;nbsp;eV,&lt;ref name=a6 /&gt; covering a larger part of the solar spectrum and obtain a higher open-circuit voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The theoretical efficiency of MJ solar cells is 86.8% for an infinite number of pn junctions,&lt;ref name=a9/&gt; implying that more junctions increase efficiency. The maximum theoretical efficiency is 37, 50, 56, 72% for 1, 2, 3, 36 pn junctions, respectively, with the number of junctions increasing exponentially to achieve equal efficiency increments.&lt;ref name=a3 /&gt; The exponential relationship implies that as the cell approaches the limit of efficiency, the increase cost and complexity grow rapidly. Decreasing the thickness of the top cell increases the transmission coefficient ''T''.&lt;ref name=a3 /&gt;

Finally, an InGaP hetero-layer between the p-Ge layer and the InGaAs layer can be added in order to create automatically the n-Ge layer by scattering during MOCVD growth and increase significantly the quantum efficiency ''QE''(λ) of the bottom cell.&lt;ref name=a6 /&gt; InGaP is advantageous because of its high scattering coefficient and low solubility in Ge.

=== Spectral variations ===

Solar spectrum at the Earth surface changes constantly depending on the weather and sun position. This results in the variation of φ(λ), ''QE''(λ), α(λ) and thus the short-circuit currents ''J&lt;sub&gt;SCi&lt;/sub&gt;''. As a result, the current densities ''J&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are not necessarily matched and the total current becomes lower. These variations can be quantified using the average photon energy (APE) which is the ratio between the spectral irradiance G(λ) (the power density of the light source in a specific wavelength λ) and the total photon flux density. It can be shown that a high (low) value for APE means low (high) wavelengths spectral conditions and higher (lower) efficiencies.&lt;ref name=a4&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/WCPEC.2003.1306273 |title=Impact of spectral effects on the electrical parameters of multijunction amorphous silicon cells |url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/8216/1/betts3.pdf |doi-broken-date=2018-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus APE is a good indicator for quantifying the effects of the solar spectrum variations on performances and has the added advantage of being independent of the device structure and the absorption profile of the device.&lt;ref name=a4 /&gt;

=== Use of light concentrators ===

Light concentrators increase efficiencies and reduce the cost/efficiency ratio. The three types of light concentrators in use are refractive lenses like [[Fresnel lens]]es, reflective dishes (parabolic or cassegraine), and light [[Waveguide (optics)|guide]] optics. Thanks to these devices, light arriving on a large surface can be concentrated on a smaller cell. The intensity concentration ratio (or “suns”) is the average intensity of the focused light divided by 1&amp;nbsp;kW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (reasonable value related to [[solar constant]]). If its value is ''X'' then the MJ current becomes ''X'' higher under concentrated illumination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Luque|Hegedus|2003|pp= 61 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a5&gt;{{harvnb|Luque|Hegedus|2003|pp=449 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using concentrations on the order of 500 to 1000, meaning that a 1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cell can use the light collected from 0.1 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (as 1 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; equal 10000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), produces the highest efficiencies seen to date. Three-layer cells are fundamentally limited to 63%, but existing commercial prototypes have already demonstrated over 40%.&lt;ref name=cnet&gt;Michael Kanellos, [http://news.cnet.com/Solar-cell-breaks-efficiency-record/2100-11395_3-6141527.html "Solar cell breaks efficiency record"], ''CNET News'', 6 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/news/press/2008/625.html "NREL Solar Cell Sets World Efficiency Record at 40.8 Percent"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917040839/http://www.nrel.gov/news/press/2008/625.html |date=2008-09-17 }}, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 13 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; These cells capture about 2/3 of their theoretical maximum performance, so assuming the same is true for a non-concentrated version of the same design, one might expect a three-layer cell of 30% efficiency. This is not enough of an advantage over traditional silicon designs to make up for their extra production costs. For this reason, almost all multi-junction cell research for terrestrial use is dedicated to concentrator systems, normally using mirrors or fresnel lenses.

Using a concentrator also has the added benefit that the number of cells needed to cover a given amount of ground area is greatly reduced. A conventional system covering 1 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; would require 625 16&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cells, but for a concentrator system only a single cell is needed, along with a concentrator. The argument for concentrated Multi-junction cells has been that the high cost of the cells themselves would be more than offset by the reduction in total number of cells. However, the downside of the concentrator approach is that efficiency drops off very quickly under lower lighting conditions. In order to maximize its advantage over traditional cells and thus be cost competitive, the concentrator system has to track the sun as it moves to keep the light focused on the cell and maintain maximum efficiency as long as possible. This requires a [[solar tracker]] system, which increases yield, but also cost.

== Fabrication ==

As of 2014 multi-junction cells were expensive to produce, using techniques similar to [[semiconduction|semiconductor device fabrication]], usually [[metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy]] but on "chip" sizes on the order of centimeters.

A new technique was announced that year that allowed such cells to use a substrate of glass or steel, lower-cost vapors in reduced quantities that was claimed to offer costs competitive with conventional silicon cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bullis |first=Kevin |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/527926/exotic-highly-efficient-solar-cells-may-soon-get-cheaper |title=High Efficiency Solar Cells for the Price of Conventional Ones &amp;#124; MIT Technology Review |publisher=Technologyreview.com |date=2014-06-09 |accessdate=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with other technologies ==

There are four main categories of photovoltaic cells: conventional mono and multi [[crystalline silicon]] (c-Si) cells, [[thin film solar cell]]s (a-Si, CIGS and CdTe), and multi-junction (MJ) solar cells. The fourth category, [[emerging photovoltaics]], contains technologies that  are still in the research or development phase and are not listed in the table below.

MJ solar cells and other photovoltaic devices have significant differences ''(see the table above)''. Physically, the main property of a MJ solar cell is having more than one pn junction in order to catch a larger photon energy spectrum while the main property of the [[thin film solar cell]] is to use thin films instead of thick layers in order to decrease the cost efficiency ratio. {{As of|2010}}, MJ solar panels are more expensive than others. These differences imply different applications: MJ solar cells are preferred in space and c-Si solar cells for terrestrial applications.

[[File:Best Research-Cell Efficiencies.png|thumb|500px|[[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] graph of [[solar cell efficiency]] over time.]]

The efficiencies of solar cells and Si solar technology are relatively stable, while the efficiency of solar modules and multi-junction technology are progressing.

Measurements on MJ solar cells are usually made in laboratory, using light concentrators (this is often not the case for the other cells) and under standard test conditions (STCs). STCs prescribe, for terrestrial applications, the AM1.5 spectrum as the reference. This air mass (AM) corresponds to a fixed position of the sun in the sky of 48° and a fixed power of 833 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, spectral variations of incident light and environmental parameters are not taken into account under STC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Albuflasa|first1=H|last2=Gottschalg|first2=R|last3=Betts|first3=T|title=Modeling the effect of varying spectra on multi junction A-SI solar cells|journal=Desalination|volume=209|issue=1–3|pages=78–85|year=2007|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2007.04.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, performance of MJ solar cells in terrestrial environment is inferior to that achieved in laboratory. Moreover, MJ solar cells are designed such that currents are matched under STC, but not necessarily under field conditions. One can use ''QE''(λ) to compare performances of different technologies, but ''QE''(λ) contains no information on the matching of currents of subcells. An important comparison point is rather the output power per unit area generated with the same incident light.

== Applications ==

As of 2010, the cost of MJ solar cells was too high to allow use outside of specialized applications. The high cost is mainly due to the complex structure and the high price of materials. Nevertheless, with light concentrators under illumination of at least 400 suns, [[Concentrated photovoltaics|MJ solar panels]] become practical.&lt;ref name=a3 /&gt;

As less expensive multi-junction materials become available other applications involve [[bandgap engineering]] for [[microclimates]] with varied atmospheric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;C. Zhang, J. Gwamuri, R. Andrews, and J. M. Pearce, (2014). Design of Multi-Junction Photovoltaic Cells Optimized for Varied Atmospheric Conditions, ''International Journal of Photoenergy'',514962, pp. 1-7.[https://www.academia.edu/9178398/Design_of_Multijunction_Photovoltaic_Cells_Optimized_for_Varied_Atmospheric_Conditions open access]&lt;/ref&gt;

MJ cells are currently being utilized in the [[Mars rover]] missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0094-5765(02)00287-4| title = The performance of gallium arsenide/germanium solar cells at the Martian surface  | year = 2004 | author = D.

Ewell | journal = Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications | volume = 54 | issue = 2 | pages = 83–101 | bibcode = 2004AcAau..54...83C  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;!-- "The rovers have outlived their predicted life spans and functioned since for over two years." Editors note: this is going to be out of date continuously. Please provide power-up date and allow users to calculate. --&gt;

The environment in space is quite different. Because there is no atmosphere, the solar spectrum is different (AM0). The cells have a poor current match due to a greater photon flux of photons above 1.87eV vs. those between 1.87eV and 1.42eV.  This results in too little current in the GaAs junction, and hampers the overall efficiency since the InGaP junction operates below MPP current and the GaAs junction operates above MPP current.  To improve current match, the InGaP layer is intentionally thinned to allow additional photons to penetrate to the lower GaAs layer.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In terrestrial concentrating applications, the scatter of blue light by the atmosphere reduces the photon flux above 1.87eV, better balancing the junction currents.  Radiation particles that are no longer filtered can damage the cell. There are two kinds of damage: [[ionisation]] and atomic displacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Luque|Hegedus|2003|pp=414 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, MJ cells offer higher radiation resistance, higher efficiency and a lower temperature coefficient.&lt;ref name=a3 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9236">'''Nanoionic hard drives''' use [[nanoionic technology]] allowing for smaller  devices  while  doing away with moving parts and the [[mechanical system|mechanical]] failures which are associated with previous HDD drives. Nanoionic hard drives are currently the most state of the art drives on the market  and  nanoionics was not utilized in hard drives until February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bullis|first=Kevin|title=Terabyte Storage for Cell Phones|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/408974/terabyte-storage-for-cell-phones/|publisher=Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanoionic devices were first proposed in 1992: "The results obtained show that it is possible to form arrays of electrochemical devices with single elements ~10 nm in size in the films".&lt;ref&gt;Despotuli A.L., Nikolaichik V.I. A step towards nanoionics // Solid State Ionics 1993 V.60. P. 275–278.&lt;/ref&gt; The basis of design of nanoionic devices is the creation of nanostructures  with nanoionic parameter  ''λ'' / ''L'' ~ 1, where ''L'' is the size of device structure, and ''λ'' is the characteristic size of specific region where the property of fast ionic transport is realized. “Possibilities to influence on these specific regions &lt; λ &gt; in a controllable manner may appear in short sized devices”. Ion - electronic hybrid devices should be considered as a step on a way to the future nanoelectronics-nanoionics (nanoelionics) that was first proposed in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Despotuli A.L., Andreeva A.V. Nanoionics: New materials and supercapacitors // Nanotechnologies in Russia 2010, V. 5. # 7-8. P. 506-520.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The First HDD [[Hard Drive]] was made in 1956 by [[IBM]]. It weighed nearly 2000 [[pound (mass)|pounds]] and only could hold 5 [[Megabyte|MB]]. The first HDD Drive was 60" long, 68" tall, and 29" wide. It was used in [[IBM]]'s RAMAC 305,the first [[computer]] to use HDD drives.&lt;ref name=firstHardDrive&gt;{{cite news|last=Hernandez|first=Daniela|title=Tech Time Warp of the Week: The World's First Hard Drive, 1956 |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2014/01/tech-time-warp-ibm-ramac/ |newspaper=WIRED|date=January 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1956 the principle of storing information via [[magnetic domains]] has not changed much. As time progressed HDD drives were able to store more information than the original and the parts became much smaller, but the moving parts that are used in HDD drives were here to stay until nanoionic technologies began to be utilized in hard drives.&lt;ref name=firstHardDrive /&gt;

In 1976 the first [[Solid State]] Device or SSD was made by [[Dataram]] and could store up to 2 [[Megabyte|MB]]. The SSD did not become popular until 2001 when SSD the SSD industry its revenues reached $25 million a year and was listed on INC 500 fastest growing private companies. The reason for this slow growth was that SSD were expensive. In 1978 1 [[Gigabyte|GB]] would have cost $1 million. Even in 2001, Adtron’s  S35PC 3.5” SSD drive which had 14 [[Gigabyte|GB]] storage cost $42,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kerekes|first=Zsolt|title=Charting the Rise of the Solid State Disk Market|url=http://www.storagesearch.com/chartingtheriseofssds.html|publisher=storagesearch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea to utilized this technology began at Arizona State University in 1992 and in 1996 the [[nanoionic supercapacitor]] was the first device to use nanoionics. The first drive to have this technology was invented by Dr. Michael Kozicki at [[Arizona State University]] 1996.This technology was then used in multiple universities around the globe, but did npt become available to the public until February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=programmable metallization cell|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/programmable+metallization+cell|publisher=Farlex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison ==

Traditional [[hard drive]]s run on mechanical parts, which uses the permanent disk to store your personal data. The hard disk drives usually have a 10 centimeter diameter and are a centimeter thick. These drives use a [[magnetic recording]] technique. We, as users, can easily manipulate our data on this medium i.e. add, copy, cut or paste data on it though this technique. The principle of [[magnetic flux]] is used for such processes. Basically the hard drive remembers which data is where and how to manipulate the data according to the user’s preference by remembering the flux patterns.
The average hard drives contain the specific parts:
* [[Disk case]] - This is a rectangular shaped disk case (the main part of the drive) which contains all the components screwed together.
* [[Disk platter]] – This is the actual disk where the user’s data is recorded on. Consists of patterns on which the computer navigates through the data using the principle of magnetic flux.
* [[Spindle (hard disk drive)|Spindle]] – This component holds the magnetic platters together and is responsible for spinning the disk platter when required.
* Read/Write Arm – This component acts as the navigator. It navigates through the magnetic patterns looking for the particular data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Santo Domingo|first=Joel|title=What's the Difference?|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2404260,00.asp|publisher=PCMAG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SSD, regarded as the future of [[data]] storage, is a technology recently available to the consumers. However expensive, these state of the art drives are considerably smaller. Data on such drives is statically twice as safer i.e. such drives crash less.
First of all, these drives do not involve magnetic principles. These drives use [[semiconductors]] to store data unlike the disk platter used in the Hard Disk Drives. SSDs use the principle of flash drive. It consists of no actual mechanical parts i.e. no movements of parts is involved. Usually the HDD data is referred to as volatile memory, this really means that when the computer loses power, all the memory is lost. However, in the case of [[Solid State]] Drives, there are chips which deliver [[non-volatile memory]] meaning the data is stored even when there is a loss of power with the machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NANOIONIC MATERIALS AND DEVICES LAB|url=http://coen.boisestate.edu/ece/nanoionic-materials-and-devices-lab/|publisher=Boise State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mode of operation ==
Nanoionics devices rely on the fundamentals of [[electrochemistry]]. Currently the hard drives are made up of solid materials which weigh less and generate more power; solids have one [[Electrical polarity|polarity]] for ions that are moving. The ions are what the electrodes are made of. Electrodes are key components in nanoionic devices. Those [[electrodes]] can be made out of ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a metal which is coated in La&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/La&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, or Bi&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(metal)O&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;. Where “metal” is any metal found in the [[transition metal]] group like copper. These nanoionic devices are made up of smaller devices that are that are spaced less than a tenth [[nanometer]] away. Due to the small spaced distance between the materials in the nanoionic device smaller ions are necessary for the pathway.Metals in the [[first group]] of the [[periodic table]] are small, but they are too reactive. So there needs to be a compromise between the reactivity of chemicals and size. That is why materials like [[Copper|Cu]] or [[Silver|Ag]] fulfill the needs of the nanoionic drives.

In the nanoionic device there would be [[chalcogenide glass]] with has the metal like gold and an element for group six infused in the glass. This glass is the electrode for the nanoionic. In the [[oxidation]] reaction the [[Silver|Ag]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; then loses the [[electron]] and turns into [[Silver|Ag]]. This reaction only happens when a [[switch]] confirms the reaction to happen and these [[switches]] are used for the binary information storage. That binary information storage is where all the data is saved on the [[hard drive]]. All this is dependent on the small current of ions, hence the name nanoionic, to allow the reaction to happen.  All the components of the switch, right metals, and solid have to come together to make the nanoionic happen correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kozicki|first=Michael|author2=Maria Mitkova|title=Memory devices based on mass transport in solid electrolytes|date=March 2011|url=http://coen.boisestate.edu/ece/files/2011/11/Chapter-for-the-Wasers-book-final-edit.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problems ==

Due to nanoionic devices being new technology, they lack [[memory]] capacity. Smaller drives take up less charge to change the [[electrolytes]] in their [[Volatility (chemistry)|nonvolatile]] state. The smaller size is the only way the nanoionic devices are feasible with today’s technology because it needs the reduction in resistance. These smaller sizes can hold a lot of memory and can still work in a [[computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kozicki|first=Michael|author2=Maria Mitkova|title=Memory devices based on mass transport in solid electrolytes|date=March 2011|url=http://coen.boisestate.edu/ece/files/2011/11/Chapter-for-the-Wasers-book-final-edit.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Old Bess''''' is an early [[beam engine]] built by the partnership of [[Boulton and Watt]]. The engine was constructed in 1777 and worked until 1848.&lt;ref name="Dickinson &amp; Jenkins, 1927, 120-126" &gt;{{cite book

The engine is most obviously known simply for being an early example of an engine built by Boulton and Watt. However it also played a far more important role in the development of [[steam engine]]s for being the first engine designed to work with an early [[cutoff (steam engine)|cutoff]], and so to use the expansion of the steam for greater efficiency.

It is now preserved in the Power Gallery of the [[Science Museum, London]].&lt;ref name="Science Museum, Old Bess" &gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the parts were taken down and re-used at [[Matthew Boulton|Boulton]]'s [[Soho Manufactory]] in [[Birmingham]].&lt;ref name="Dickinson &amp; Jenkins, 1927, 120-126" /&gt; The reworked engine was more successful there, and encouraged Boulton to invest further in this developing steam technology and in Watt's inventions.

The Manufactory had been built to use a [[water wheel]] to drive its machinery, and the site had been chosen on that basis, but there were concerns over seasonal lack of water to power the wheel.&lt;ref name="Wilson, 1963, 58-59" &gt;{{Cite book

  |pages=58–59
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar problems in the iron industry had inspired the development of the [[water-returning engine]]: a steam pump that could raise water to drive the wheel, in times of low water on the river. The Kinneil Engine had been built as a pump, for use in a coal mine, and so was suitable for this new task. Watt's [[rotative beam engine]] had not yet been considered and so the only way to produce rotary work to drive machinery in the Manufactory was by water power.

In 1777 Boulton and Watt decided to build a second engine for use at Soho, either to supplement the Kinneil Engine&lt;ref name="Wilson, 1963, 58-59" /&gt; or primarily to experiment with Watt's new idea of [[simple expansion steam engine|expansive working]] of the steam.&lt;ref name="Dickinson &amp; Jenkins, 1927, 120-126" /&gt; The new engine was also to be a water-returning engine&lt;ref name="Science Museum, Old Bess" /&gt; Like the earlier [[Newcomen engine]]s, it was only capable of pumping water rather than driving machinery directly.

== Working life ==
=== Construction ===
As early as 1769, Watt was considering the possibility of working steam expansively, as recorded in a letter of 28 May to [[William Small|Dr. Small]].&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite book
  |last=Arago  |first=M.
  |title=Historical Eloge of James Watt
  |location=London
  |year=1838
  |page=88
  |quote=admit steam until one-fourth of the distance between it and the next valve is filled with steam, shut the valve and the steam will continue to expand and to press round the wheel with diminishing power
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early engines were incapable of this, as they used a single valve for both inlet and exhaust. As Watt had already begun to use separate valves for each function,&lt;ref name="Dickinson &amp; Jenkins, 1927, 120-126" /&gt; it would now be possible to control their timing independently, i.e. to apply [[lead (steam engine)|lead]] to the timing of the inlet valve. Watt decided to construct a new engine to demonstrate this principle and was confident of the substantial savings in coal consumption to be offered.&lt;ref &gt;Letter to [[Gilbert Meason]], 24 April 1777, Boulton &amp; Watt colln.&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction began in 1777 with the ordering of a 33-inch&lt;ref group="note" &gt;Engines were characterised by and often named after the diameter of their cylinder. This dimension (amongst other factors) determined their power output; whilst the working pressure and precise piston stroke length could be altered, the cylinder was fixed at manufacture.&lt;/ref&gt; cylinder (84cm).&lt;ref name="Dickinson &amp; Jenkins, 1927, 120-126" /&gt; The engine was erected and working at Soho by August, although still incomplete.

The engine always worked as a water pump and was equipped with two [[cast iron]] cylinders at opposite ends of the beam, one for the working cylinder and one for the pump. The pump cylinder was taller and thinner, of {{convert|24|in|cm}} diameter and {{convert|8|ft|3|in|m|1}} tall, designed for a working stroke {{convert|7|ft|m}} within this, although only {{convert|6|ft|1|in|m|1}} was used in practice. The pumped water was delivered at a [[hydrostatic head|head]] of {{convert|24|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="Dickinson &amp; Jenkins, 1927, 120-126" /&gt; The engine was later described as being of 30&amp;nbsp;[[horsepower|hp]] in power.&lt;ref name="Harrison" /&gt;

The beam was typical for early [[single-acting cylinder|single-acting]] beam engines, pulling through [[wrought iron]] chains running over a curved arch-head at each end of the beam. At some later point, possibly when reconstructed after the fire, this beam was strengthened by being strutted and bridled with the additional timber and iron triangular trusses that are seen above the beam today.&lt;ref name="Crowley, Old Bess" /&gt;

=== ''Beelzebub'' ===
Initial operation of the engine was unsatisfactory. Watt was away in Cornwall and Boulton wrote to him, describing the engine's actions as "very fierce".&lt;ref &gt;Letter to Watt, 18 August 1777, Boulton &amp; Watt colln.&lt;/ref&gt; His opinion was that the engine's cylinder was too large for the work expected of it. This led to it being worked at a pressure of around 5.7&amp;nbsp;psi, whereas if it were operating at 8&amp;nbsp;psi, it would be less jerky and violent. This action was so remarkable as to give the engine its initial nickname of ''[[Beelzebub]]''.&lt;ref name="Dickinson &amp; Jenkins, 1927, 120-126" /&gt;

Neither Watt nor Boulton had a solution to the engine's behaviour. Watt's experience with the Chacewater engine, a rebuilt [[John Smeaton|Smeaton]] engine, at [[Wheal Busy]], suggested that cutoff led to a violent action. In September he recommended [[throttle|throttling]] the steam supply to the engine.&lt;ref &gt;Letter to Boulton, 20 September 1777, Boulton &amp; Watt colln.&lt;/ref&gt; Boulton favoured further experimentation with [[cutoff (steam engine)|cutoff]] (i.e. valve timing) and in 1779 suggested that a series of more scientific measurements be tried. With hindsight, Boulton's approach was the more thermodynamically efficient, although this lesson was not fully appreciated by locomotive drivers right to the end of steam power.

=== Fire and reconstruction ===
One morning in July 1778 the engine house was discovered to be on fire. The fire spread rapidly and within half an hour the roof was burned to the ground. The timberwork and soldered copper piping of the engine were also destroyed or damaged. Even the beam itself, a substantial timber construction, was "rendered unfit" by the fire. Fortunately the most important part of the engine, its cylinder, survived the fire relatively intact. Within three weeks the engine had been reconstructed and was expected to be working again shortly.&lt;ref name="Dickinson &amp; Jenkins, 1927, 120-126" /&gt;

While the engine had been damaged, Watt, who was once again away in Cornwall, had advised that "no repair farther that the roof ought to be gone about at present", with his intention being to reconstruct the engine in some improved manner.&lt;ref name="Dickinson &amp; Jenkins, 1927, 120-126" /&gt; The nature of these reconstructions, and their effectiveness, remains unclear.

By 1781, the engine had been working in its reconstructed form for some years. Whatever the improvements had been, they left Watt and Boulton still agreeing that this was, "one of the worst engines they had".&lt;ref name="Dickinson &amp; Jenkins, 1927, 120-126" /&gt;&lt;ref &gt;Letter from Watt to Boulton, 1781, Boulton &amp; Watt colln.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Closure of the Mint and preservation ==
The engine operated at the [[Soho Mint]], until the mint's closure in 1848. It was sold for £48, then re-sold for £58 and placed on display on an island in [[Derrington Pool]], outside the metal-rolling works of its new owner, a Mr. Walker.&lt;ref name="Dickinson &amp; Jenkins, 1927, 120-126" /&gt; Although much of the Mint's [[coining (mint)|coining]] machinery had been re-sold for further use at the new [[Birmingham Mint]], this aged and thoroughly obsolete engine appears to have been one of the first artefacts of [[industrial archaeology]] to be deliberately preserved.

The engine was later re-sold and then presented to the [[Commissioners of Patents]] for their [[Patent Office Museum]], which would in turn become the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]].&lt;ref name="Dickinson &amp; Jenkins, 1927, 120-126" /&gt; The engine is thus not only one of the Museum's oldest exhibits, but also one of the first to enter its collection. When first displayed, the engine was erected in an open-fronted representation of a brick-built engine house.&lt;ref &gt;{{harvnb|Crowley|1986|pages=9, 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now displayed on free-standing timberwork, allowing a closer inspection of the cylinders.

For an engine that had been described as "one of the worst engines they had" when almost new, it had a relatively long working life of over 70 years. Its name had also shifted from the violent ''Beelzebub'' to the rather more friendly ''Old Bess'', indicating a more satisfactory performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Confusion between engines ==
Several confusions exist about this engine, and have been widely repeated.

The first of these confusions is that this was Watt's ''second'' engine (after the Kinneil engine) and the first by the Boulton and Watt partnership.&lt;ref name="Crowley, Old Bess" /&gt; In fact several engines were built between 1773 (the return of the Kinneil engine to Birmingham) and the construction of ''Beelzebub'' in 1777.&lt;ref name="Dickinson &amp; Jenkins, 1927, 111-119"  &gt;{{harvnb|Dickinson|Jenkins|1927}}, Chap.&amp;nbsp;IX, ''The Single Acting Pumping Engine'', pp.&amp;nbsp;111–119&lt;/ref&gt; These include such well-known engines as the 1775 38-inch [[blowing engine]] for [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]]'s [[blast furnace]]s at [[New Willey Company|New Willey]], near [[Broseley]], and the 50-inch [[pumping engine]] for Bloomfield Colliery near [[Tipton]].&lt;ref name="Wilson, 1963, 58-59" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dickinson &amp; Jenkins, 1927, 111-119"  /&gt;

The identity of ''Beelzebub'' is also confused. Some sources describe this as referring to the rebuilt Kinneil engine at Birmingham.&lt;ref name="Crowley, Old Bess" /&gt; There are two pieces of evidence to support the view that ''Old Bess'' and  ''Beelzebub'' are the same engine.&lt;ref name="Wilson, 1963, 58-59" /&gt; Firstly the name ''Beelzebub'' derives from its violent action when used experimentally for expansive working, an experiment applied to the engine built new in 1777.&lt;ref name="Dickinson &amp; Jenkins, 1927, 120-126" /&gt; Secondly ''Beelzebub'' is described as a 33&amp;nbsp;inch engine, as is ''Old Bess'' on display today. There is no record of Boulton &amp; Watt ever building another engine of this dimension.&lt;ref name="Dickinson &amp; Jenkins, 1927, 120-126" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2255">'''Panclastites''' are a class of [[Sprengel explosive]]s similar to [[oxyliquit]]s. They were first suggested in 1881 by [[Eugène Turpin]], a French chemist. They are a mixture of liquid [[dinitrogen tetroxide]] serving as [[oxidizer]] with a suitable fuel, e.g. [[carbon disulfide]], in the 3:2 volume ratio. [http://www.webref.org/geology/p/panclastite.htm] Other fuel being used is [[nitrobenzene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newsgroup|title=Re: Panclastite|message-id=6natdc$sqa$1@news01.btx.dtag.de|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!original/alt.engr.explosives/jI8-WhcxgwI/M1DZOLuljEQJ|date=1998-06-30|newsgroup=alt.engr.explosives}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Possible alternative fuels are e.g. [[nitrotoluene]], [[gasoline]], [[nitromethane]], or [[halocarbon]]s.

Panclastites are shock-sensitive and difficult to handle, requiring their mixing immediately before use; also the dinitrogen tetroxide is highly corrosive and explodes in contact with some chemicals. Despite their [[brisance]] and [[detonation velocity]] being comparable with [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]], panclastites have virtually no use today.

During World War I, due to shortages of other explosives, French used some panclastite-class mixtures, which they called '''anilites''', in small aircraft bombs. The mixing of the chemicals was triggered by airflow spinning a propeller on the nose of the bomb after it was dropped, mixing the previously separated chemicals inside. The resulting mixture was so sensitive the bombs did not need a fuze to explode on impact.

In the 1880s, Germans were testing [[torpedo]]es with panclastite [[warhead]]. Carbon disulfide and nitrogen tetroxide were stored in separate glass compartments, which were broken when the torpedo was launched and the chemicals mixed, and later were detonated by a [[contact fuse]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Kliper+Parom 2006.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Kliper utilizing Parom Space Tug]] --&gt;
The '''''Parom''''' (''ferry'' in [[Russian language|Russian]]) is a [[space tug]] that has been proposed by [[RKK Energia]].  The purpose of this vehicle is to replace most of the Progress' active components. [[Progress spacecraft]] have flown re-supply missions since 1978. Nikolai Bryukhanov, RKK Energia's deputy general designer, said in May 2005 that the Federal Space Agency had received a design for a new space system. According to him, the system's operation principle is completely different from that used by Progress. A launch vehicle first places a Parom reusable inter-orbit "tug" into a 200&amp;nbsp;km orbit. As this spacecraft will not carry any consignments, other rockets will orbit payload containers that will be docked by Parom. The tug will then deliver them to the [[International Space Station|ISS]] or another orbiter.

"Any Russian or foreign launch vehicle can orbit such containers," Bryukhanov said. The size of the container and its shape depend on payload characteristics. "This can be an airtight instrument module or a fuel tanker," the deputy general designer continued. "Moreover, depressurized platform featuring large scientific equipment and auxiliary systems, i.e., solar batteries that cannot be stored inside the airtight module".{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In layout, the Parom will be built around a pressurized transfer passage with docking ports at each end: each of these two docking ports can be used to dock with the cargo container, the [[Kliper]], the space station or any other spacecraft. It will have its own engines, along with propellant transfer lines to feed fuel from the cargo container into its own tanks or into the space station’s  or another spacecraft's tank. It will also have engines scaled to handle cargo modules weighing up to 30 tonnes (around 60,000 pounds), twice the mass of the largest station sections carried into orbit aboard [[space shuttle]]s and [[Proton rocket]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3043">'''Phoslock''' is the commercial name for a [[bentonite]] clay in which the sodium and/or calcium ions are exchanged for [[lanthanum]]. The addition of this element allows it to bind with phosphates to form rhabdophane (&lt;chem&gt;LaPO4.\mathit{n}H2O&lt;/chem&gt;) and thereby remove them from the water column. It is used in lake restoration projects as a tool to manage [[eutrophication]] and manage [[algal blooms]] (specifically [[cyanobacteria]] or blue green algae) by reducing [[phosphorus]], one of the major contributing factors to algal growth.

It was developed in Australia by the [[CSIRO]] in the late 1990s by Dr Grant Douglas (US Patent 6350383) as a way of utilising the ability of lanthanum to bind phosphate in freshwater natural aquatic systems. The first large-scale trial took place in January 2000 in the [[Canning River]], Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phoslock.com.au/irm/ShowStaticCategory.aspx?CategoryID=172&amp;masterpage=5 About Phoslock], Phoslock Water Solutions&lt;/ref&gt; More recent [[CSIRO]] research has involved the development of a nanoclay hybrid with a demonstrated ability to remove dissolved phosphorus from both natural and wastewaters.  
  
During its development, patenting and commercialisation by CSIRO and subsequent commercial production, Phoslock has been a subject in academic research (,&lt;ref&gt;Egemose et al, Chemical lake restoration products: sediment stability and phosphorus dynamics, Environment Science &amp; Technology 44 (3), 985-991 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lurling et al, Effects of lanthanum and lanthanum-modified clay on growth, survival and reproduction of Daphnia magna, Water Research 44 (3), 309-319 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robb et al, Application of Phoslock™, an innovative phosphorus binding clay, to two Western Australian waterways - preliminary findings, Hydrological Processes, 494, 237-243 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, et al, Phoslock™ - A new technique to reduce internal phosphorus loads in aquatic systems.

The largest number of whole lake applications and the most comprehensive pre and post-application monitoring has taken place in Europe, primarily Germany (where it is sold under the tradename Bentophos), the Netherlands and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phoslock.eu|title=Home : Phoslock|website=Phoslock.eu|accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The most usual meaning is in reference to instruction manuals, and means "Read the F'ing Book" more politely rendered as "Read the Fine Book."

'''"RTFB"''' is a [[parody|parodical]] extension to the [[Internet slang]] term "[[RTFM]]" and its extension "RTFS".

"RTFB" is short for "read the fucking binary", in a similar way as "RTFM" means "read the fucking manual" and "RTFS" means "read the fucking source". While both "RTFM" and "RTFS" have legitimate uses, "RTFB" is usually intended only as a parody of them. While any user, no matter how tech-savvy, can be expected to read the [[Owners manual|manual]], and experienced [[computer programmer]]s can deduce the working logic of a [[computer program]] directly from reading its human-readable [[source code]], "RTFB" expects users to directly read the [[machine language]] code that the [[microprocessor]] executes natively. Today's microprocessors are usually so complex that, except for trivial textbook programs, this is a difficult task even for experienced programmers, and because of anti-[[reverse-engineering]] laws, may even be illegal.

RTFB has also been used meaning "Read the fucking [[Bible]]" in relation to WWJD ([[What would Jesus do?|What Would Jesus Do]]) jokes.

A more recent use, applied to members of the legislative branch, means "read the fucking bill". It is a reaction to the practice of passing massive legislation where the final bill is available for only a few hours before it is voted upon.

'''Robert Coldwell Wood''' (September 16, 1923 &amp;ndash; April 1, 2005) was an American political scientist, academic and government [[Administration (government)|administrator]], and professor of political science at [[MIT]].  From 1965 to 1969, Wood served as the Under Secretary of the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] under President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], and for two weeks as acting secretary of the department.

After his return to MIT, he directed the Joint Center for Urban Studies at MIT and Harvard. He also had a joint appointment as chairman of the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]]. He served as president of the [[University of Massachusetts]] (1970-1977), overseeing expansion of programs, including construction of a campus in south Boston.

== Early life and career ==
Wood was born on September 16, 1923 in [[St Louis, Missouri]], the son of Mary (née Bradshaw) Wood and Thomas Frank Wood.  He won a scholarship to [[Princeton University]], interrupting his studies during World War II to serve in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. Wood saw action during [[Battle of the Bulge]], won a [[Bronze Star]], and rose to the rank of sergeant.

After graduating from [[Princeton University]], Wood earned three degrees from [[Harvard University]]: a master's in [[public administration]], and a master's and a doctorate in government.&lt;ref name = "ORB05"&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2005/obit-wood-0406.html Sarah H. Wright, "Professor, HUD chief Robert Wood dies"], MIT News Office, 6 April 2005, Retrieved 9 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood taught political science at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] from 1959 to 1965.  From 1965 to 1969, Wood served as the Under Secretary of the newly created [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] under President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].

In 1968, Wood was awarded the [[Wiener Medal for Cybernetics]] from the American Society for Cybernetics. Following the resignation of [[Robert C. Weaver]] as Secretary of HUD, Wood served briefly in the position for two weeks before George Romney took office.

Wood returned to MIT, where he directed the Joint Center for Urban Studies at MIT and Harvard. At the same time, he was appointed as head of the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA).

From 1970 to 1977 he served as president of the [[University of Massachusetts]]. During these years, Wood led the expansion of the university, to include UMass Medical Center in Worcester and its Boston campus. He also played a key role in bringing the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum to its site at Columbia Point, next to UMass-Boston.&lt;ref name = "ORB05"/&gt; He also taught at [[Wesleyan University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princeton.edu/~paw/archive_new/PAW04-05/16-0706/memorials.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Wood married the former Margaret Byers, on March 22, 1952. They had three children, including the actor [[Frank Wood (actor)|Frank Wood]] and the Governor of New Hampshire and U.S. Senator [[Maggie Hassan]].&lt;ref name = "ORB05"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Douglas|title=Robert Wood, Education Expert, Dies at 81|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/05/education/robert-wood-education-expert-dies-at-81.html|accessdate=21 June 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=5 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood died from [[stomach cancer]] at his home in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], on April 1, 2005.

In [[telecommunication]]s, a '''scrambler''' is a device that transposes or inverts signals or otherwise encodes a [[message]] at the sender's side to make the message unintelligible at a receiver not equipped with an appropriately set descrambling device. Whereas [[encryption]] usually refers to operations carried out in the [[Digital data|digital]] domain, scrambling usually refers to operations carried out in the [[Analog transmission|analog]] domain. Scrambling is accomplished by the addition of components to the original signal or the changing of some important component of the original signal in order to make extraction of the original signal difficult. Examples of the latter might include removing or changing vertical or horizontal sync pulses in television signals; televisions will not be able to display a picture from such a signal.  Some modern scramblers are actually [[encryption]] devices, the name remaining due to the similarities in use, as opposed to internal operation.

In [[telecommunications]] and [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]], a ''scrambler'' (also referred to as a ''randomizer'') is a device that manipulates a data stream before transmitting. The manipulations are reversed by a ''descrambler'' at the receiving side. Scrambling is widely used in [[satellite communications|satellite]], [[Microwave radio relay|radio relay]] communications and [[PSTN]] modems. A scrambler can be placed just before a [[Forward error correction|FEC]] coder, or it can be placed after the FEC, just before the  modulation or [[line code]]. A scrambler in this context has nothing to do with [[encryption|encrypting]], as the intent is not to render the message unintelligible, but to give the transmitted data useful engineering properties.

A scrambler replaces sequences (referred to as ''whitening sequences'') into other sequences without removing undesirable sequences, and as a result it changes the probability of occurrence of vexatious sequences. Clearly it is not foolproof as there are input sequences that yield all-zeros, all-ones, or other undesirable periodic output sequences. A scrambler is therefore not a good substitute for a [[line code]], which, through a coding step, removes unwanted sequences.

== Purposes of scrambling ==
A scrambler (or randomizer) can be either:
# An algorithm that converts an input string into a seemingly [[random]] output string of the same length (e.g., by [[pseudo-random]]ly selecting bits to invert), thus avoiding long sequences of bits of the same value; in this context, a randomizer is also referred to as a scrambler.
# An analog or digital source of unpredictable (i.e., high entropy), unbiased, and usually independent (i.e., random) output bits. A "truly" random generator may be used to feed a (more practical) [[deterministic]] [[pseudo-random]] [[random number generator]], which extends the [[random seed]] value.&lt;!--note: the MIL reference is *very* unclear on that point; does it refer to "true" randomness, statistical randomness, or cryptographically secure randomness?--&gt;

There are two main reasons why scrambling is used:

* To enable accurate timing recovery on receiver equipment without resorting to redundant line coding.  It facilitates the work of a [[timing recovery circuit]] (see also [[Clock recovery]]), an [[automatic gain control]] and other adaptive circuits of the receiver (eliminating long sequences consisting of '0' or '1' only).
* For energy dispersal on the carrier, reducing inter-carrier signal [[interference (communication)|interference]].  It eliminates the dependence of a signal's [[power spectrum]] upon the actual transmitted data, making it more dispersed to meet maximum power spectral density requirements (because if the power is concentrated in a narrow frequency band, it can interfere with adjacent channels due to the [[intermodulation]] (also known as cross-modulation) caused by non-linearities of the receiving tract).

Scramblers are essential components of [[physical layer]] system standards besides [[forward error correction#Interleaving|interleaved coding]] and [[modulation]]. They are usually defined based on [[linear feedback shift register]]s (LFSRs) due to their good statistical properties and ease of implementation in hardware.

It is common for physical layer standards bodies to refer to lower-layer (physical layer and [[link layer]]) encryption as scrambling as well.&lt;ref&gt;EN 301 192, ''Specifications for Data Broadcasting'', [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI), 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ETR 289, ''Support for use of scrambling and Conditional Access (CA) within digital broadcast systems'', [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI), 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This may well be because (traditional) mechanisms employed are based on feedback shift registers as well.
Some standards for [[digital television]], such as [[Conditional access|DVB-CA]] and [[Multiprotocol encapsulation|MPE]], refer to encryption at the link layer as scrambling.

== Types of scramblers ==
* Additive  (synchronous) scramblers
* Multiplicative (self-synchronizing) scramblers

=== Additive (synchronous) scramblers ===
[[File:Scrambler randomizer additive.png|right|thumb|350px|An additive scrambler (descrambler) used in [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]]]]

''Additive scramblers'' (they are also referred to as ''synchronous'') transform the input data stream by applying a [[pseudo-random binary sequence]] (PRBS) (by modulo-two addition). Sometimes a pre-calculated PRBS stored in the [[read-only memory]] is used, but more often it is generated by a [[linear-feedback shift register]] (LFSR).

In order to assure a synchronous operation of the transmitting and receiving LFSR (that is, ''scrambler'' and ''descrambler''), a ''[[sync-word]]'' must be used.

A sync-word is a pattern that is placed in the data stream through equal intervals (that is, in each [[Data frame|frame]]). A receiver searches for a few sync-words in adjacent frames and hence determines the place when its LFSR must be reloaded with a pre-defined ''initial state''.

The ''additive descrambler'' is just the same device as the additive scrambler.

Additive scrambler/descrambler is defined by the polynomial of its LFSR (for the scrambler on the picture above, it is &lt;math&gt;1+z^{-14}+z^{-15}&lt;/math&gt;) and its ''initial state''.

=== Multiplicative (self-synchronizing) scramblers ===
[[File:Scrambler randomizer multiplicative scrambler.png|right|thumb|350px|A multiplicative scrambler used in V.34 recommendation]]

[[File:Scrambler randomizer multiplicative descrambler.png|right|thumb|350px|A multiplicative descrambler used in V.34 recommendation]]

''Multiplicative scramblers'' (also known as ''feed-through'') are called so because they perform a ''multiplication'' of the input signal by the scrambler's [[transfer function]] in [[Z-transform|Z-space]]. They are discrete [[LTI system|linear time-invariant]] systems.
A multiplicative scrambler is recursive, and a multiplicative descrambler is non-recursive. Unlike additive scramblers, multiplicative scramblers do not need the frame synchronization, that is why they are also called ''self-synchronizing''. Multiplicative scrambler/descrambler is defined similarly by a polynomial (for the scrambler on the picture it is &lt;math&gt;1+z^{-18}+z^{-23}&lt;/math&gt;), which is also a ''transfer function'' of the descrambler.

=== Comparison of scramblers ===
Scramblers have certain drawbacks: 
* Both types may fail to generate random sequences under worst-case input conditions. 
* Multiplicative scramblers lead to error multiplication during descrambling (i.e. a single-bit error at the descrambler's input will result in ''w'' errors at its output, where ''w'' equals the number of the scrambler's feedback taps). 
* Additive scramblers must be reset by the frame sync; if this fails, massive error propagation will result, as a complete frame cannot be descrambled. 
* The effective length of the random sequence of an additive scrambler is limited by the frame length, which is normally much shorter than the period of the PRBS. By adding frame numbers to the frame sync, it is possible to extend the length of the random sequence, by varying the random sequence in accordance with the frame number.

==Noise==
The first voice scramblers were invented at [[Bell Labs]] in the period just before [[World War II]]. These sets consisted of electronics that could mix two signals or alternatively "subtract" one signal back out again. The two signals were provided by a [[telephone]] and a [[record player]]. A matching pair of records was produced, each containing the same recording of [[noise]]. The recording was played into the telephone, and the mixed signal was sent over the wire. The noise was then subtracted out at the far end using the matching record, leaving the original voice signal intact. Eavesdroppers would hear only the noisy signal, unable to understand the voice.

One of those, used (among other duties) for telephone conversations between [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was intercepted and unscrambled by the [[Germans]]. At least one German [[engineer]] had worked at Bell Labs before the war and came up with a way to break them. Later versions were sufficiently different that the German team was unable to unscramble them. Early versions were known as "[[A-3 (scrambler)|A-3]]" (from [[AT&amp;T Corporation]]). An unrelated device called [[SIGSALY]] was used for higher-level voice communications.

The noise was provided on large shellac [[phonograph]] records made in pairs, shipped as needed, and destroyed after use. This worked, but was enormously awkward. Just achieving synchronization of the two records proved difficult. Post-war electronics made such systems much easier to work with by creating pseudo-random noise based on a short input tone. In use, the caller would play a tone into the phone, and both scrambler units would then listen to the signal and synchronize to it. This provided limited security, however, as any listener with a basic knowledge of the electronic circuitry could often produce a machine of similar-enough settings to break into the communications.

==Cryptographic==
It was the need to synchronize the scramblers that suggested to [[James H. Ellis]] the idea for [[non-secret encryption]], which ultimately led to the invention of both the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] encryption algorithm and [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange]] well before either was reinvented publicly by [[Ron Rivest|Rivest]], [[Adi Shamir|Shamir]], and [[Leonard Adleman|Adleman]], or by [[Whitfield Diffie|Diffie]] and [[Martin Hellman|Hellman]].

The latest scramblers are not scramblers in the truest sense of the word, but rather [[Digitizing|digitizers]] combined with encryption machines. In these systems the original signal is first converted into digital form, and then the digital data is encrypted and sent. Using modern [[Public-key cryptography|public-key systems]], these "scramblers" are much more [[Security|secure]] than their earlier analog counterparts. Only these types of systems are considered secure enough for sensitive data.

[[Voice inversion]] scrambling can be as simple as inverting the [[Frequency range|frequency bands]] around a static point to various complex methods of changing the inversion point randomly and in real time and using multiple bands.

The "scramblers" used in [[cable television]] are designed to prevent casual signal theft, not to provide any real security. Early versions of these devices simply "inverted" one important component of the TV signal, re-inverting it at the client end for display. Later devices were only slightly more complex, filtering out that component entirely and then adding it by examining other portions of the signal. In both cases the circuitry could be easily built by any reasonably knowledgeable hobbyist.  (See [[Television encryption]].)

Electronic kits for scrambling and descrambling are available from hobbyist suppliers. [[Scanner (radio)|Scanner]] enthusiasts often use them to listen in to scrambled communications at car races and some public-service transmissions. It is also common in [[Family Radio Service|FRS]] radios.  This is an easy way to learn about scrambling.

The term "scrambling" is sometimes incorrectly used when [[Radio jamming|jamming]] is meant.

== Descramble ==
'''Descramble''' in [[cable television]] context is the act of taking a scrambled or [[encrypted]] video signal that has been provided by a cable television company for [[premium television]] services, processed by a scrambler and then supplied over a [[coaxial cable]] and delivered to the household where a [[set-top box]] reprocesses the signal, thus descrambling it and making it available for viewing on the [[television]] set. A descrambler is a device that restores the picture and sound of a scrambled channel. A descrambler must be used with a [[cable converter box]] to be able to unencrypt all of the premium &amp; pay-per-view channels of a Cable Television System.

[[File:SLC Silicon Slopes.jpg|thumb|right|Silicon Slopes' [[Salt Lake City]] Winter Skyline]]
'''Silicon Slopes''' refers to the metropolitan area that primarily originates in the [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] metropolitan area but also includes [[Provo, Utah]] and [[Park City, Utah]] and surrounding areas. Served by the [[Salt Lake City International Airport]] and less than a two-hour flight from [[Silicon Valley, CA]], Silicon Slopes has been mentioned in news media, including [[NPR]] coverage about the [[NSA]] [[Utah Data Center]] in the region.&lt;ref name="npr_nsa"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/03/12/148252561/on-utahs-silicon-slopes-tech-jobs-get-a-lift|title=On Utah's 'Silicon Slopes,' Tech Jobs Get A Lift|date=March 12, 2012|accessdate=March 25, 2015|author=Steve Henn|publisher=[[NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reference to California's [[Silicon Valley]], Utah's "Silicon Slopes" encompasses a cluster of information technology, software development, and hardware manufacturing and research firms along the [[Wasatch Front]]. In particular, this grouping includes memory process technology companies [[SanDisk]] and the [[Intel]]/[[Micron]] joint venture [[IM Flash Technologies]], video game software development companies [[EA Sports]], and data analysis software including [[Adobe Systems]].&lt;ref name="herbert_cnbc_blog"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/100860405#|title=Technology's new home located in 'Silicon Slopes,' Utah|author=[[Gary R.

The term ''Silicon Slopes'' is the brainchild of [[Josh James]] (founder and CEO of [[Domo (company)|Domo]]) for the purpose of creating a branding campaign to promote Utah's growing technology community. The nickname is derived from "[[Silicon Valley]]," substituting Utah's mountains (slopes) for Northern California's Santa Clara valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://siliconslopes.com/|title=Silicon Slopes|website=siliconslopes.com|access-date=April 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Utah has a decades-long history of government contract work and innovative Utah businesses' early involvement in the tech industry, including the creation of the [[Internet]] as the fourth node of [[ARPANET]]. These foundations were built over years, and established Utah's ability to become a leading technology center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/utah-became-next-silicon-valley|title=How Utah Became the Next Silicon Valley|last=Vauhini|first=Vara|date=February 3, 2015|magazine=The New Yorker|access-date=August 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Utah also has a strong Internet backbone; it was a Google Fiber early expansion city with service now available in Provo and Salt Lake City &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fiber.google.com/cities/saltlakecity/|title=Google Fiber is coming to Salt Lake City|website=fiber.google.com|access-date=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government Partnerships===
Utah has a long history of partnerships with the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] that have contributed to laying the groundwork for the state's high-tech business environment and infrastructure. [[David C. Evans]], &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/12/business/david-evans-pioneer-in-computer-graphics-dies-at-74.html|title=David Evans, Pioneer in Computer Graphics, Dies at 74|last=Markoff|first=John|date=October 12, 1998|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a native of Salt Lake City, was one of the original pioneers of computer science in Utah and its groundbreaking work with the [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]].  During the early 1960s, Evans worked as the head of the [[computer science]] department at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]], where he was also in charge of the university's work for the Pentagon's Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA).  In 1965, Evans was recruited back to Salt Lake City to create a computer science department at the [[University of Utah]], and he brought his DoD contacts with him, including [[Ivan Sutherland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Markoff|first1=John|title=David Evans, Pioneer in Computer Graphic, Dies at 74|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/12/business/david-evans-pioneer-in-computer-graphics-dies-at-74.html|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evans and Sutherland continued their work on ARPA for the DoD with their colleagues in California and helped to establish [[ARPANET]], an "early packet switching network and the first network to implement the protocol suite TCP/IP."  Both of these technologies form the technical foundation of the internet.  In 1969, the University of Utah was one of the original four nodes of ARPANET, cementing its place in military and technological history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burrington|first1=Ingrid|title=A Visit to the NSA's Data Center in Utah|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/a-visit-to-the-nsas-data-center-in-utah/416691/|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to this early partnership with the DoD, Utah was able to encourage more joint ventures with the military.  Not only was Utah capable of developing high-tech infrastructure, many geographic and natural characteristics were appealing to the DoD.  Utah is geographically isolated from both the east and west coasts, providing higher security and less vulnerability to [http://www.edcutah.org/documents/DataCenterProfileFinal.pdf attacks.]  Utah also has a low incidence of large-scale natural disasters and wide open spaces that provide enough room for chemical weapons testing and drone pilot training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burrington|first1=Ingrid|title=A Visit to the NSA's Data Center in Utah|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/a-visit-to-the-nsas-data-center-in-utah/416691/|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some notable Utah partnerships with the U.S. military include [[Hill Air Force Base]], [[Utah Test and Training Range]], [[Dugway Proving Ground]], and the [[Tooele Chemical Agent Disposal Facility]].

In recent years, Utah has also become home to a growing number of big data processing centers.  Some of these are government partnerships, such as the largest [[National Security Agency|NSA]] data storage facility in the United States, located in Bluffdale, Utah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nsa.gov1.info/utah-data-center/|title=NSA Utah Data Center - Serving Our Nation's Intelligence Community|website=nsa.gov1.info|access-date=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to meet the demand and facilitate more partnerships, the University of Utah recently added a new Big Data certificate program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.unews.utah.edu/news_releases/big-data-big-business/|title=Big Data, Big Business {{!}} University of Utah News|website=archive.unews.utah.edu|access-date=April 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; within its School of Computing.  The program began in the Fall of 2014.  Utah is already ahead of the curve in the national trend on big data, and training students how to understand the technicality of big data analysis will continue to attract business and military operations to Utah.

=== Local Tech Businesses ===
Examples of early local tech businesses and founders that helped attract more start-ups to the area include: [[Evans &amp; Sutherland]], founded in Salt Lake City by David Evans and Ivan Sutherland in 1968, as the world's first computer graphics company&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.es.com/|title=Evans &amp; Sutherland Digital Planetariums|website=www.es.com|access-date=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in operation for over four decades supplying advanced computer graphics technologies to the market); [[David C. Evans]], founder and first chairman of the [[University of Utah School of Computing]] from 1965-1973; [[James H. Clark]], founder of [[Silicon Graphics]], Inc; [[John Warnock]], a co-founder of [[Adobe Systems]]; [[Alan Ashton (executive)|Alan Ashton]], co-founder of [[WordPerfect|Wordperfect]]; [[Edwin Catmull]], co-founder of [[Pixar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Markoff|first1=John|title=David Evans, Pioneer in Computer Graphics, Dies at 74|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/12/business/david-evans-pioneer-in-computer-graphics-dies-at-74.html|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Novell]], Inc., a [[Software development]] company founded in 1979 by [[Ray Noorda]], produced software to connect desktop computers so they could share peripheral devices, like a [[Printer (computing)]] and [[Hard disks]]. As the price of desktop computers began to fall, Novell captured a large segment of the market with its Netware program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fisher|first1=Lawrence|title=Preaching Love Thy computer|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/29/business/preaching-love-thy-competitor.html?pagewanted=1|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At their height in the early 1990s, Novell controlled 65% of the market for network operating systems in the high-tech industry.

=== Past Political Leadership ===
Governor [[Mike Leavitt|Michael Leavitt]] (1993-2003) was instrumental in luring many tech companies to Utah.  During his time in office, Leavitt made monthly trips to Silicon Valley and used his slogan, "We have workers, we have space, we have proximity," to increase his influence there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Jennifer|title=WAY OUT WEST|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/13/business/way-out-west-there-s-silicon-in-them-thar-hills-or-will-be-soon.html?pagewanted=1|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He specifically highlighted the challenges facing the Silicon Valley region: natural geographic boundaries and traffic congestion.  Utah, he maintained, was the place to grow with ease.  Leavitt was a key factor in enticing [[eBay]] to locate their main customer service center in Utah and in bringing in new research operations for [[Intel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Jennifer|title=WAY OUT WEST|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/13/business/way-out-west-there-s-silicon-in-them-thar-hills-or-will-be-soon.html?pagewanted=1|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Governor Leavitt laid the groundwork for his successors to build on his achievements and continue to make Utah a business-friendly state, particularly for high-tech companies.

=== Banking History ===
Utah's economic stability is also reflected in its history as a center for industrial banks and as a secondary financial hub for investment banks like [[Goldman Sachs]] that encourage venture capitalism in the state.  Industrial banks, also known as [[Industrial Loan Corporation]]s (ILCs), are a niche form of banking that is nearly exclusively located in Utah.  Examples of Utah ILCs include BMW Bank, [[Pitney Bowes]] Bank, and [[Target Bank]].  Due to this distinction, Utah is the fourth-largest center for state-chartered banking in the nation, with nearly $280 billion in assets within its borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cityweekly.net/utah/bank-on-it/Content?oid=2782335|title=Bank On It|website=Salt Lake City Weekly|access-date=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utah's industrial banks began in the early 1900s before Congress passed the [[Bank Holding Company Act of 1956]], which severed the ties between banking and commercial corporations.  Utah's ILCs were grandfathered in, so Utah's industrial-bank charter is not subject to the Bank Holding Company Act.  This means that the ILCs are not regulated by the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]]; they are overseen by the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|FDIC]] and Utah's Department of Financial Services.  This allows the banks to be free from more onerous federal regulation and also allows them to be more responsive to changes in the economy.  By providing sound oversight in this area of banking, Utah has built credibility in the marketplace and earned a distinguished reputation in banking.  This has helped to create the pro-business climate that is attractive to venture capitalists and start-up technology companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frazier|first1=Colby|title=Bank On It|url=http://www.cityweekly.net/utah/bank-on-it/Content?oid=2782335|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of the prominence of the Silicon Slopes tech industry is the growing amount of venture capital coming into the area. In the first nine months of 2014, the dollar-per-deal average in the Silicon Slopes was the highest in the country, at an average of $51.3 million per deal. This high average can be attributed to big deals with key players such as Qualtrics and Domo. Qualtrics, a customer analytics software firm, brought in $150 million in venture capital funding in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/ilan-mochari/silicon-valley-utah.html|title=Move Over, Silicon Valley: Utah Has Arrived|date=November 10, 2014|website=Inc.com|access-date=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
Utah has continually ranked number one for best state for businesses. There is a continuous focus to create partnerships between businesses, government, education, and communities. The Governor's Office of Economic Development is based on Governor [[Gary Herbert]]'s commitment to economic development statewide. In the most recent State New Economy Index, performed by the [[Kauffman Foundation]] in 2010, Utah was ranked first in the nation for Economic Dynamism and inventor patents, while placing third in fastest growing firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://business.utah.gov/publications/workforce-2/|title=Workforce|website=business.utah.gov|language=en-US|access-date=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic Development ===
Utah's economic stability has grown to meet the standards of the tech giants that occupy the Silicon Slopes area made possible in 2009 by Governor [[Gary Herbert]] who focused on four cornerstones to strengthen the economy of Utah:  jobs, energy, education and self-determination. Governor Herbert credits the economic momentum in Utah to collaboration between corporate and government partnerships. The Governors Office of Economic Development, led by [[Spencer Eccles|Spencer P. Eccles]], coordinated with Governor Herbert to build on the economic development cornerstones, calling it economic development 2.0. The updated objectives to help sustain the economic growth in Utah, allowing the Silicon Slope regions to expand, strengthen, and grow existing Utah businesses, increase innovation, entrepreneurship and investment, national and international business, and prioritize education to develop the workforce of the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://business.utah.gov/publications/economic-development-2-0/|title=Economic Development 2.0 -|website=business.utah.gov|language=en-US|access-date=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics   ==
[[File:Utah Scenery.jpg|thumb|Fall colors in Utah]]

=== Location, Climate and Geography ===
Utah's location is enticing to both companies and employees. With close proximity to the [[Rocky Mountains]], many activities are available year-round. Four distinct seasons offer such year-round activities as skiing, hiking, and rock climbing. Utah also has many national parks, including [[Zion National Park]], [[Bryce Canyon National Park]], and [[Canyonlands National Park]]. [[Salt Lake City]] is a [[Delta Air Lines|Delta Airlines]] hub and is perfectly situated to allow for business day trips from Silicon Valley due to direct, 90-minute flights that cut travel expenses and limit travel time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://business.utah.gov/publications/hitting-utahs-silicon-slopes/|title=Hitting Utah's Silicon Slopes -|website=business.utah.gov|language=en-US|access-date=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utah offers many incentives that are more attractive than other cities in the Western region: the cost of living is lower than in Seattle or Portland; the climate is not as hot as [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] or [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]]; geographic proximity is closer than [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], allowing for less travel time and cost; and the ski slopes can be reached in less than an hour, unlike [[Denver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Jennifer|title=WAY OUT WEST|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/13/business/way-out-west-there-s-silicon-in-them-thar-hills-or-will-be-soon.html?pagewanted=1|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Culture ===

With Salt Lake City as the headquarters for [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the "[[Mormon culture]]" is predominant within Utah.  This has both positives and negatives for attracting technology companies to the state.  Utah workers have a reputation for being hard-working, dedicated, and loyal.  This "Mormon work ethic" is attractive to tech executives because the workforce in Utah is known for its reliability and stability.  Silicon Valley workers are notorious for short job tenure and frequently bouncing between multiple tech ventures.  However, workers in Silicon Valley are also willing to stretch themselves to the limits - working extreme hours and participating in marathon sessions over weekends and holidays when deadlines are looming.  They spend a lot of time after work together as well, making connections and forming networks.  "Mormon culture" values family over all else, and many Silicon Slopes workers are unwilling to put in the same amount of hours as their counterparts in Silicon Valley, and they are much less likely to spend extracurricular time with their coworkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=James|first1=Al|title=Demystifying the Role of Culture in Innovative Regional Economies|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=dd7a43d2-370d-4241-8243-938c66dcef9a%40sessionmgr107&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=102&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d&amp;preview=false#AN=19802127&amp;db=buh|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mormon culture" can also explain the diverse and multi-linguistic workforce.  Thousands of young Utahns serve missions for their church around the world and return to Utah with language skills they are able to apply in their education and future workforce participation.  Mormons also tend to marry early and are more likely to have larger-than-average families.  They value education and encourage their children to go to college and earn degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/?lang=eng|title=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|website=www.lds.org|access-date=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Workforce ===
Utah boasts a highly educated, technologically proficient, multilingual workforce, speaking over 130 languages. Many residents of Utah lived and worked abroad which contributes to the flexibility and capabilities of immediately contributing to companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Utah Governor's Office of Economic Development|title=Why Utah?|url=http://business.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/Why-Utah.pdf|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Utah also maintains the youngest population in the United States due to its higher-than-average birth rate.  The median age in Utah is 29.6 years, compared to the nationwide median of 37.3 years.  This young labor force is very attractive to employers as baby boomers throughout the nation retire and many states find it difficult to replenish their workforce due to falling birth rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Utah Department of Workforce Services|title=Utah's Labor Market and Economy|url=http://economyutah.blogspot.com/2013/08/youngest-in-nation.html|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Schools ===
Prominent schools that contribute to the Utah workforce include three major universities,[[Brigham Young University]], [[University of Utah]] and [[Utah State University]] having a primary emphasis on entrepreneurship, innovation, and research and development, followed by [[Utah Valley University]], [[Weber State University]], [[Salt Lake Community College]], [[Dixie State University]] and [[Westminster College (Utah)|Westminster College]]. In the early 2000s, the Utah Legislature allocated around $100 million to the state's universities in order to bolster their computer science programs and significantly increase the number of graduates in the field.  The universities also provided matching funding and created many new courses and areas of technological study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Jennifer|title=WAY OUT WEST; There's Silicon in Them Thar Hills, or Will Be Soon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/13/business/way-out-west-there-s-silicon-in-them-thar-hills-or-will-be-soon.html?pagewanted=1|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer science graduates continue to rise in Utah, with Northern Utah universities boasting 663 graduate students in 2013, up 47 percent from 2009. Of the six schools listed above, students graduating in Computer Science with a bachelor's degree have risen 44 percent since 2009. Students graduating with a master's degree rose 46 percent and those getting doctorates increased by 61 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://siliconslopes.com/blog/2014/02/18/utah-computer-science-grads-jump-44-to-522/|title=Utah computer science grads jump 47 percent to 534 : Silicon Slopes|website=siliconslopes.com|access-date=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These computer science programs are garnering interest due to demand from the companies found in the Silicon Slopes.  As of August 2015, the [[Utah Technology Council]] achieved "mainstreaming Computer Science" in high schools by allowing students to take credited rigorous Computer Science courses as a Science credit option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.utahtech.org/About/Accomplishments.aspx|title=Accomplishments - Utah Technology Council {{!}} Salt Lake City, UT|website=www.utahtech.org|access-date=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nationally Ranked Programs   ===
The University of Utah's [http://eae.utah.edu/ Entertainment Arts &amp; Engineering undergraduate program] is No. 1 for game design in the U.S., and its graduate program consistently ranks in the top three according to [http://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=top-50-game-design-ugrad The Princeton Review].  The EAE program began in 2007 and is an interdisciplinary program between engineering, computer science, and fine arts.  It has professional facilities and a motion capture system that allows students to have real-world experience, making them very attractive to game developers and tech companies upon graduation.  Beyond video games, students also produce games and apps that are used in a wide variety of industries, especially in the medical field.  The EAE program collaborates closely with the [http://healthsciences.utah.edu/center-for-medical-innovation/ Center for Medical Innovation] at the University of Utah.

BYU also has a strong computer science program, and its [https://animation.byu.edu/ Center for Animation] is regularly ranked among the top five schools for animation in the U.S.  The program began in 2010 after a wealthy homebuilder, Ira A. Fulton, purchased a supercomputer for the school, allowing them to produce top quality animation.  Many of the faculty members came from companies such as [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Pixar]], [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]], and [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]].  Student-produced films win regular awards and have been screened at many film festivals, including Sundance and Cannes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=BYU|title=Center for Animation|url=https://animation.byu.edu/about_anim|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Utah and BYU are also both ranked within the top 25 schools for entrepreneurship according to [[The Princeton Review]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=top-25-entrepreneurship-ugrad|title=Top 25 Entrepreneurship: Ugrad {{!}} The Princeton Review|website=www.princetonreview.com|access-date=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [http://marriottschool.byu.edu/cet/ The Rollins Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology] at BYU is ranked No. 2 in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://marriottschool.byu.edu/cet/|title=Home Page - Rollins Center for Entrepreneurship &amp; Technology|website=Rollins Center for Entrepreneurship &amp; Technology|language=en-US|access-date=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It first began in 1971 and now focuses most specifically on tech start-ups.  Over the past ten years, students of the program have started 196 companies and have attracted more than $772 million in funding.  The entrepreneurship program at the University of Utah began in 2004, and it is currently ranked at No. 24.  Over the past ten years, its students have started 167 companies and raised nearly $750,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Entrepreneur|title=Entrepreneur|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/slideshow/252396|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lassonde.utah.edu/|title=Lassonde Entrepreneur Institute {{!}} University of Utah|website=Lassonde Entrepreneur Institute {{!}} University of Utah|access-date=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; continues to be strengthened, and at the start of the fall semester in August 2016, [http://lassonde.utah.edu/studios/ Lassonde Studios], an institute that combines 400 residences with a 20,000-square-foot garage (used for building prototypes and holding events and conferences) will be opened to create a hub for innovators, makers, and entrepreneurs of all disciplines to connect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lassonde.utah.edu/studios/|title=Lassonde Studios {{!}} Lassonde Entrepreneur Institute {{!}} University of Utah|website=Lassonde Entrepreneur Institute {{!}} University of Utah|access-date=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infrastructure ===
A key contributor to Silicon Slopes' successful tech industry is the well-planned Internet infrastructure.  Salt Lake City is in a fortunate geographic location because it sits along the major east-west Internet corridor where ten major service providers interconnect with each other and deliver high-speed services to the area.  This [http://www.edcutah.org/documents/DataCenterProfileFinal.pdf "internet backbone"] is a critical aspect of Utah's high-tech industry success.

In [[Provo, Utah|Provo]], the city government started planning a fiber-optic Internet infrastructure in the late 1990s. This high-speed Internet system was funded as a private-public partnership called [[iProvo]] and construction was completed in 2006. [[Google Fiber]] later acquired iProvo in 2013 and now offers Internet speeds up to 1,000 Mbit/s for businesses and households.

In response to the high-tech industry located in Salt Lake City and its relationship with Provo, Google officially announced in March 2015 that Salt Lake City would be one of the next places to receive Google Fiber.  Construction is currently ongoing, but significant progress has been made, and residents and businesses will soon be able to sign-up for lightning-fast internet service.  Requests for business permits in the area have drastically increased in response to the soon-to-be-available service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rogers-Whitehead|first1=Carrie|title=Google Fiber plans move along: What will it mean for SLC?|url=http://www.ksl.com/?sid=37391064&amp;nid=1012|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corporate Recruitment ==
The State of Utah has offered a variety of incentives to encourage large tech companies to call Utah home, and the Silicon Slopes uprising would suggest that these perks have been motivating. The Utah Governor's Office of Economic Development allows a variety of grants and tax incentives to companies willing to either relocate or expand their enterprise, depending on the stability of the company and the types of jobs that are being brought to the state. From the state's perspective, they are trying to attract companies will positions that require a high level of education or skill to motivate Utah graduates to remain here in the state and help drive economic growth.

Numerous publications and studies rank Utah as one of the top "best states for business"&lt;ref name="best states for business"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/fdc/welcome_mjx.shtml|title=Best States for Business|date=November 12, 2014|accessdate=April 20, 2015|author=Kurt Badenhausen|publisher=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most "fiscally fit"&lt;ref name="fiscally fit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/10/13/best-states-for-business-business-beltway-best-states.html|title=The Best States for Business and Careers|date=October 13, 2010|accessdate=April 20, 2015|author=Kurt Badenhasen|publisher=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's "Enterprising States" report, Utah ranks in the top five in every export category and was the only state to finish in the top 10 for all six metrics.&lt;ref name="enterprising states"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uschamber.com/enterprising-states-0|title=Enterprising States|author=[[United States Chamber of Commerce]]|date=June 19, 2011|accessdate=April 20, 2015|publisher=[[United States Chamber of Commerce]], [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation]], Campaign for Free Enterprise through [[Purple Strategies]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utah tops [[Governing (magazine)|Governing Magazine]]'s list of the best managed states.&lt;ref name="best managed states"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governing.com/blogs/by-the-numbers/small-business-friendly-states-cities-rankings.html|title=Survey Ranks Most and Least Small Business-Friendly States, Cities|date=April 2, 2013|accessdate=April 20, 2013|author=Mike Maciag|publisher=[[Governing (magazine)|Governing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corporation Requirements   ===
To qualify for the tax benefits or grant programs associated with the Silicon Slopes region, there are specific guidelines in place to determine if the state will offer incentives to encourage relocation. These incentives are evaluated on a case by case basis by the [http://www.utah.gov/governor/ Governor's Office] and the [http://business.utah.gov/why-come-to-utah/about-goed/executive-director/ Executive Director]. Some of these standards include the industry the company is in, historical successes of the company, revenues that are raised and the types of jobs that were created. The jobs that are being brought in need to require specific qualifications and maintain certain salaries to maintain a well-educated, professional workforce within the state. To monitor these qualifications, grants and tax credits are only awarded after each corporation has proven its ability to provide the jobs and revenue required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://business.utah.gov/programs/incentives/|title=Corporate Incentives {{!}} Utah Governor's Office of Economic Development|website=business.utah.gov|language=en-US|access-date=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rural Development   ===
A motivational factor for the [[Utah|State of Utah]] to provide incentives to corporations for expansion or relocation is the development of rural areas or deteriorating regions. The Silicon Slopes region is located between two of Utah's largest metropolises, [[Salt Lake City]] and [[Provo, Utah|Provo]]. Historically, this area has been largely underdeveloped, with the exception of the much smaller cities of [[Alpine, Utah|Alpine]], [[Highland, Utah|Highland]], [[American Fork, Utah|American Fork]], [[Lehi, Utah|Lehi]], [[Pleasant Grove, Utah|Pleasant Grove]], [[Lindon, Utah|Lindon]], and [[Orem, Utah|Orem City]]. Orem is the largest of the, with a population of just under 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/4957300,49|title=Population estimates, July 1, 2015,  (V2015)|website=www.census.gov|access-date=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To accelerate the development of this area and surrounding areas, the Governor's Office of Economic Development ([http://business.utah.gov/ GOED]) established the Economic Development Tax Increment Financing (EDTID) tax credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://business.utah.gov/programs/incentives/edtif/|title=EDTIF Tax Credit -|website=business.utah.gov|language=en-US|access-date=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally,the [http://business.utah.gov/publications/rural-development-2/ Utah Office of Rural Development] created the [http://business.utah.gov/programs/incentives/enterprise-zones/ Utah Enterprise Zone Tax Credit]  to motivate business to choose locations that would benefit these rural areas. These credits can compound depending on employee wages compared to surrounding businesses, and are structured to encourage strong economic growth and professional retention to the area.

The United States Department of Agriculture ([[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]) has also partnered with the State of Utah to provide other motivating factors to prospective employees of Silicon Slope companies. Homes can be purchased with specifically structured mortgages that require little to no down payment, and can include extra financing to update or refurnish older homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/programs-services-individuals|title=Programs &amp; Services for Individuals {{!}} USDA Rural Development|website=www.rd.usda.gov|access-date=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Surface micromachining''' builds [[Microstructure|microstructures]] by [[Nanoparticle deposition|deposition]] and etching structural layers over a [[substrate (materials science)|substrate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bustillo |first=J.M. |author2=R.T. Howe |author3=R.S. Muller |date=August 1998 |title=Surface micromachining for microelectromechanical systems |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=86 |issue=8 |pages=1552–1574 |doi=10.1109/5.704260}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is different from [[Bulk micromachining]], in which a [[silicon]] substrate [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]] is selectively etched to produce structures. 

== Layers ==
Generally, [[polysilicon]] is used as one of the substrate layers while [[silicon dioxide]] is used as a ''sacrificial layer.'' The sacrificial layer is removed or etched out to create any necessary void in the thickness direction. Added layers tend to be vary in size from 2-5 micrometres. The main advantage of this machining process is the ability to build electronic and mechanical components (functions) on the same substrate. Surface micro-machined components are smaller compared to their bulk micro-machined counterparts.

As the structures are built on top of the substrate and not inside it, the substrate's properties are not as important as in bulk micro-machining. Expensive [[Silicon Wafer|silicon wafers]] can be replaced by cheaper substrates, such as [[glass]] or [[plastic]]. The size of the substrates may be larger than a silicon wafer, and surface micro-machining is used to produce [[Thin-film transistor|thin-film transistors]] on large area glass substrates for flat panel displays. This technology can also be used for the manufacture of [[thin film solar cell]]s, which can be deposited on glass, [[Polyethylene terephthalate|polyethylene terepthalate]] substrates or other non-rigid materials.

==Fabrication process==
Micro-machining starts with a silicon wafer or other substrate upon which new layers are grown. These layers are selectively etched by [[photo-lithography]]; either a wet etch involving an [[acid]], or a dry etch involving an [[ionized gas]] (or [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]). Dry etching can combine chemical etching with physical etching or [[ion]] bombardment. Surface micro-machining involves as many layers as are needed with a different mask (producing a different pattern) on each layer. Modern integrated [[Integrated circuit|circuit]] [[Semiconductor device fabrication|fabrication]] uses this technique and can use as many as 100 layers. Micro-machining is a younger technology and usually uses no more than 5 or 6 layers. Surface micro-machining uses developed technology (although sometimes not enough for demanding applications) which is easily repeatable for volume production.

===Sacrificial layers===
A sacrificial layer is used to build complicated components, such as movable parts. For example, a suspended [[cantilever]] can be built by depositing and structuring a sacrificial layer, which is then selectively removed at the locations where the future beams must be attached to the substrate (i.e. the anchor points). A structural layer is then deposited on top of the [[polymer]] and structured to define the beams. Finally, the sacrificial layer is removed to release the beams, using a selective etch process that does not not damage the structural layer.

Many combinations of structural and sacrificial layers are possible. The combination chosen depends on the process. For example, it is important for the structural layer not to be damaged by the process used to remove the sacrificial layer.

== Examples ==
Surface Micro-machining can be seen in action in the following MEMS (Microelectromechanical) products:

==History==

Scientists around Daniel Rugar and John Mamin at the [[IBM Almaden Research Center|IBM research laboratories in Almaden]] have been the pioneers in using heated [[Atomic force microscopy|AFM]] (atomic force microscope) probes for the modification of surfaces. In 1992, they used microsecond [[Laser#Pulsed operation|laser pulses]] to heat AFM tips to write indents as small as 150&amp;nbsp;nm into the [[polymer]] [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|PMMA]] at rates of 100&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Thermomechanical writing with an atomic force microscope tip|journal = Applied Physics Letters|date = 1992-08-24|issn = 0003-6951|pages = 1003–1005|volume = 61|issue = 8|doi = 10.1063/1.108460|first = H.

It was an example of a memory storage device with a large array of parallel probes, which was however never commercialized due to growing competition from [[non-volatile memory]] such as [[flash memory]]. The storage medium of the Millipede memory consisted of polymers with shape memory functionality, like e.g. [[cross-link]]ed [[polystyrene]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title =Nanoscale Shape-Memory Function in Highly Cross-Linked Polymers |last = T.

==History==
[[File:Ryan Carson age 35.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Ryan Carson in 2013]]

Treehouse was founded by Ryan Carson, a computer science graduate from [[Colorado State University]].&lt;ref name="VB Profile"&gt;{{cite web|title=VP Profiles Ryan Carson|url=https://www.vbprofiles.com/people/ryan-carson-52270b78843bac5a36000423|website=VB Profiles|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating, Carson worked for Fingal, a design agency in London before moving to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[United Kingdom]]. In 2004, Ryan Carson and his wife Gillian Carson founded Carsonified, a company built towards training web designers and developers based in Bath, United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Startup Grind"&gt;{{cite web|title=Startup Grind Hosted Ryan Carson (Treehouse)|url=https://www.startupgrind.com/events/details/startup-grind-portland-hosted-ryan-carson-treehouse#/|website=Startup Grind|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to training designers and developers, Carsonified also created web applications and hosted web industry events, conferences and workshops. In 2008 Carsonified sold its file-sharing application [[DropSend]] to the Florida-based company Webminds.&lt;ref name="Gigaom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carsonified Sells Dropsend Web App To Boost Its Coffers|url=https://gigaom.com/2008/09/29/419-carsonified-sells-dropsend-web-app-to-boost-its-coffers75/|website=Gigaom|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Ryan Carson sold Carsonified which is now named [[Future Insights]] and started working on his new project, Treehouse.

Ryan Carson founded Treehouse in 2011, a project that emerged from Carson's previous company, Carsonified, and its video-tutorial service Think Vitamin Membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treehouse Blog|url=http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/unlock-awesome-treehouse-rewards|publisher=Treehouse Island inc.|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carson decided to redesign and rebrand the service as Treehouse because the name "reflects the wonder of learning as a child."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=May|first=Tom|title=Ryan Carson on Treehouse, FOWA, startups and more!|url=http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/ryan-carson-11116649|publisher=Creative Bloq|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treehouse's mission is to offer affordable technology education to users globally.&lt;ref name="About Treehouse"&gt;{{cite web|title=Treehouse: About|url=https://teamtreehouse.com/about|website=Treehouse|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Treehouse opened their first office in [[Orlando, Florida]], In 2012 they opened their second office and moved Treehouse HQ to [[Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref name="Oregon Live"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rogoway|first1=Mike|title=Online education startup Treehouse says it has raised $4.75 million and will move HQ to Portland|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/index.ssf/2012/04/online_education_startup_treeh.html|website=Oregon Live|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, Treehouse released its first iPad app for accessing Treehouse's content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tomer|first=Caryn|title=Treehouse Launches iPad App; Helps Programmers And Designers Be Job Ready|url=http://techli.com/treehouse/|publisher=Techli|accessdate=31 Jul 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treehouse also released an Android application in 2014 and added a course for Apple's Swift programming language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Owen|title=Treehouse releases Android app, adds course for Apple’s Swift programming language|url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/09/17/treehouse-releases-android-app-adds-apple-swift-courses/|publisher=The Next Web|accessdate=17 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carson is currently the active CEO of Treehouse.&lt;ref name="About Treehouse" /&gt;

==The Techdegree Program==
In May 2016, Treehouse announced the launch of the Techdegree Program. The Techdegree program is a guided learning program that is designed to help students prepare for entry-level development jobs. The Techdegree program is available for six competencies: Android, front-end web development, Full Stack Javascript, iOS, Java, and Python.&lt;ref name="Techdegree"&gt;{{cite web|title=Treehouse Introduces Techdegree|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160510006497/en/Treehouse-Introduces-Techdegree|website=Business Wire|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Program length varies by Techdegree. Below is a breakout of how much time it takes to complete a program, including courses and projects.
* Front End Web Development - 155–195 hours
* Full Stack JavaScript - 310–340 hours
* iOS - 235–275 hours
* Android - 175–215 hours
