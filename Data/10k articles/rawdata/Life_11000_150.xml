'''Abdagus''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 873) was, according to 18th and 19th century historical books, a duke of [[Frisia]].

Abdagus, Duke of Frisia, appointed by [[Louis the German]], headed in 873 the [[Frisians]] against the [[Danes]], who had invaded Frisia under the Danish leader [[Rudolf Haraldsson|Rudolf]], and destroyed and plundered large parts of the country. The battle was fierce, but Rudolf fell early with 500 compatriots (or 800, the sources disagree on this). The remainder fled to a stronghold, where they were besieged by the Frisians. One Norman, who had converted to Christianity and lived amongst the Frisians, and who has been said to have been [[Rorik of Dorestad|Roruk]], Rudolf's uncle, convinced them to end the siege and sign a pact. The Danes promised to return their plunder and never to return to the territory of King Louis. Theerafter, the sieged were allowed to return to their ships, keeping a few as hostages to maintain the pact.

'''Abdul Wahid bin Zaid Abul Fadl''' ('Abdul Wāḥid bin Zaid Abul Faḍl; died 21st Shawwal 793) was an early day Sufi Saint, a successor to [[Hasan al-Basri]], second link in the [[Sufi]] [[Silsilah]] of [[Chishti Order]], and the Master of [[Fudhail Bin Iyadh]].

Abdul Waahid Bin Zaid has been quoted in ''Fazail-e-Sadaqat'' &lt;ref&gt;a book by Mawlana Zakaria, reprint Delhi, 1976, p 149&lt;/ref&gt; as receiving advice from a Christian monk. He is also reported to have received education from Imam Abu Hanifah, before being initiated full-time as a Sufi by Khwaja Hasan al-Basri.&lt;ref&gt;Taj ul Auliya i Chisht, by Dr Ghulam Muhammad Chishti-Fareedi, pub Lahore, 1952, pp 208-209&lt;/ref&gt;

His year of birth is unknown but is said to be on 176, 177, or 186 [[Islamic Calendar|Hijri]], equating probably to 711 AD.  The month is said to be 27th of [[Safar]].  His shrine is in [[Basrah]], [[Iraq]].

'''Agafya Semyonovna Grushetskaya''' ({{lang-ru|Агафья Семёновна Грушецкая}}) (1663 – 14 July 1681) was a Russian noble, [[Tsaritsa]] of [[Russia]] as the first spouse of Tsar [[Feodor III of Russia]] who hailed from the [[Grushetsky]] family.

== Biography ==
She was a daughter of ([[voivode]], and [[boyar]]) Semyon Fyodorovich Grushetsky and his spouse Mariya Ivanovna Zaborovskaya. She could speak and write Polish, French and Latin and was well informed about the Western European life style. She could also play [[harpsichord]]. She was described as beautiful as "an angel of heaven", with an easy going character. From 1677 she lived with her uncle, Semyon Zaborovsky, who did not wish her to marry. In 1680, [[Feodor III of Russia|Feodor]], the tsar of the time, saw her during a religious procession: when she fainted after the sight of a witch in a religious theater play he rushed forward to support her, and fell in love with her. Aware that her uncle did not wish her to marry, a traditional summon was proclaimed to all unmarried noble women to gather for Feodor to choose from, and he chose her.

On 18 July 1680, she married Feodor. Agafya shared the radical views of her spouse. She opposed the influence of the Miloslavsky party, led by her husband's mother and sister, and supported Likhachev. Her husband's relative Ivan Iljitj Miloslavskii exposed her to slander, which caused a conflict, and was punished by Feodor. Her sisters were married to princes and her cousins were raised in rank by Feodor. Agafya has been described as an angelic tsarina, merciful and loyal to Feodor and the public's welfare. She was the first to advocate beard-shaving and the adoption of Western clothes at the Russian court. She herself was the first tsarina to expose her hair and to wear a Western (Polish) dress.

On 11 July 1681, the Tsarina gave birth to her son, Tsarevich Ilya Fyodorovich, the expected heir to the throne. Agafya died as a consequence of the childbirth three days later, on 14 July, and six days later, on 21 July, the nine-days-old Tsarevich also died. She was reportedly deeply mourned by Feodor.

'''Ajjamada Boppayya Devayya''' is the only Air Force Officer to be posthumously awarded the [[Maha Vir Chakra]] (MVC). The Maha Vir Chakra is the second highest wartime gallantry award and is less in precedence only to the [[Param Vir Chakra]]. During the 1965 [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|India-Pakistan War]], Sqn Ldr A B Devayya (called 'Wings of Fire') was part of a strike mission (on the Pakistani airbase [[Sargodha]]) when he was attacked by an enemy aircraft. He shot down the enemy pursuer's plane but in the process his aircraft was damaged and he went missing. Presumably he died in Pakistani territory. 23 years later, in 1988, he was posthumously awarded the retrospective MVC award for this feat in the 1965 conflict.&lt;ref name = "IAF MVC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maha Vir Chakra awards (IAF)|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/Awards/Gallantry/302-MVC.html|publisher=Bharat Rakshak (Indian Armed Forces)|accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "1988 MVC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maha Vir Chakra awards (1988)|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/Database/Awards/awards.php?qyear=1988|publisher=Bharat Rakshak (Indian Armed Forces)|accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Devayya was born on 24 December 1932, at [[Coorg|Coorg, Karnataka]]. He was the son of Dr. Bopayya. In 1954 he was commissioned into the [[Indian Air Force]] as a pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A B Devayya |url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/HEROISM/Devayya.html |publisher=Bharat Rakshak (Indian Armed Forces) |accessdate=11 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425124828/http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/HEROISM/Devayya.html |archivedate=25 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the outbreak of the 1965 war, he was an instructor at the Air Force Flying College. He was posted to No.1 "Tigers" Squadron and flew the [[Dassault Mystère IV|Mystere IVa fighter bomber]].&lt;ref name = "MVC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maha Vir Chakra Awardee List|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/Database/Awards/awards.php?qaward=MVC|publisher=Bharat Rakshak (Indian Armed Forces)|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a senior flying instructor, Squadron Leader Devayya was part of an aircraft strike mission which went to Sargodha airfield in [[Pakistan]]. Despite actually being a standby in case one of the first 12 aircraft dropped out, he joined the air battle. Devayya was intercepted by an enemy F-104 Starfighter flown by Pakistani pilot Flt. Lt. Amjad Hussain. Devayya successfully evaded the Starfighter's attacks. But the faster aircraft caught up with him and damaged his plane. Yet Devayya attacked the Starfighter and struck it. The Starfighter went down while the pilot Hussain ejected from his seat and parachuted. It is not known what happened to Devayya. The IAF Mysteres were short on fuel and efficiency. The Mystere aircraft was destroyed and it is assumed that Devayya died on Pakistani soil.&lt;ref name = "MVC"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Encounter"&gt;{{cite web|title=Devayya's Encounter - 1965 War - 7 September 1965|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/Galleries/AviationArt/DebGohain/1965-Devayya-Encounter.jpg.html|publisher=Bharat Rakshak (Indian Armed Forces)|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The IAF was not aware of what had happened to Devayya, first recording him missing and later declaring him dead. Later, a British writer, John Fricker, was commissioned by the Pakistani Air Force to write an account of the war derived from Pakistani sources in 1979.&lt;ref name = "MVC"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Encounter"/&gt; What lead to Devayya's actual death still remains a mystery. It was revealed much later by Pakistan that Devayya's body was found almost intact by villagers not very far from Sargodha and buried.&lt;ref name = "Encounter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Squadron Leader Ajammada Boppaya Devayya|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/Database/4810|publisher=Bharat Rakshak|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Fricker's work, the IAF realised what had truly happened and in 1988 announced that the [[Maha Vir Chakra]] was to be awarded to Devayya posthumously. This is the only posthumous Maha Vir Chakra that the IAF has received.&lt;ref name = "MVC"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Encounter"/&gt; 21 IAF personnel (including two Canberra pilots Wg Cdr [[Jag Mohan Nath]] and late Wg Cdr Padmanabha Gautham who have the distinction of receiving the bar to the Maha Vir Chakra) have received the Maha Vir Chakra in four wars and numerous actions since 1947.&lt;ref name = "IAF MVC"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "1988 MVC"/&gt;

Mrs. Devayya accepted the posthumous Maha Vir Chakra awarded to her husband in 1988, nearly 23 years after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Epilogue : Where are they now? |url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1965War/Photos-10.html |publisher=Bharat Rakshak |accessdate=11 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050505074406/http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1965War/Photos-10.html |archivedate=5 May 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 7, 2009, the private bus stand circle in [[Madikeri]] in [[Kodagu]] was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Correspondent|first=Special|title=Tributes paid to war hero Devayya|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tributes-paid-to-war-hero-devayya/article5106521.ece|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=The Hindu|date=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coorg|title=Kodagu blog|url=http://coorgblog.blogspot.in/2010/07/category-military-service-indian-army.html|work=coorgblog|publisher=blogspot|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dinesh|first=B C|title=Dedicated to nation’s defence|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/article172390.ece?service=print|accessdate=16 April 2014|date=Dec 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Correspondent|first=Staff|title=Circle named after A.B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23263">'''Artificial intelligence for video surveillance''' utilizes [[computer software]] programs that analyze the images from [[Surveillance cameras|video surveillance camera]]s in order to recognize humans, vehicles or objects. Security contractors program the software to define restricted areas within the camera's view (such as a fenced off area, a parking lot but not the sidewalk or public street outside the lot) and program for times of day (such as after the close of business) for the property being protected by the camera [[surveillance]]. The [[artificial intelligence]] ("A.I.") sends an alert if it detects a trespasser breaking the "rule" set that no person is allowed in that area during that time of day.

The A.I. program functions by using [[machine vision]]. Machine vision is a series of [[algorithm]]s, or mathematical procedures, which work like a flow-chart or series of questions to compare the object seen with hundreds of thousands of stored reference images of humans in different postures, angles, positions and movements. The A.I. asks itself if the observed object moves like the reference images, whether it is approximately the same size height relative to width, if it has the characteristic two arms and two legs, if it moves with similar speed, and if it is vertical instead of horizontal. Many other questions are possible, such as the degree to which the object is reflective, the degree to which it is steady or vibrating, and the smoothness with which it moves. Combining all of the values from the various questions, an overall ranking is derived which gives the A.I. the probability that the object is or is not a human. If the value exceeds a limit that is set, then the alert is sent. It is characteristic of such programs that they are [[Unsupervised learning|self-learning]] to a degree, learning, for example that humans or vehicles appear bigger in certain portions of the monitored image – those areas near the camera – than in other portions, those being the areas farthest from the camera.

In addition to the simple rule restricting humans or vehicles from certain areas at certain times of day, more complex rules can be set. The user of the system may wish to know if vehicles drive in one direction but not the other. Users may wish to know that there are more than a certain preset number of people within a particular area. The A.I. is capable of maintaining surveillance of hundreds of cameras simultaneously. Its ability to spot a trespasser in the distance or in rain or glare is superior to humans' ability to do so.

This type of A.I. for security is known as "[[Logic programming|rule-based]]" because a human programmer must set rules for all of the things for which the user wishes to be alerted. This is the most prevalent form  of A.I. for security. Many video surveillance camera systems today include this type of A.I. capability. The hard-drive that houses the program can either be located in the cameras themselves or can be in a separate device that receives the input from the cameras.

A newer, non-rule based form of A.I. for security called "[[behavioral analytics]]" has been developed. This software is fully self-learning with no initial programming input by the user or security contractor. In this type of [[analytics]], the A.I. learns what is normal behavior for people, vehicles, machines, and the environment based on its own observation of patterns of various characteristics such as size, speed, reflectivity, color, grouping, vertical or horizontal orientation and so forth. The A.I. normalizes the visual data, meaning that it classifies and tags the objects and patterns it observes, building up continuously refined definitions of what is normal or average behavior for the various observed objects. After several weeks of learning in this fashion it can recognize when things break the pattern. When it observes such anomalies it sends an alert. For example, it is normal for cars to drive in the street. A car seen driving up onto a sidewalk would be an anomaly. If a fenced yard is normally empty at night, then a person entering that area would be an anomaly.

=== Statement of the problem ===

Limitations in the ability of humans to vigilantly monitor video surveillance live footage led to the demand for artificial intelligence that could better serve the task. Humans watching a single video monitor for more than twenty minutes lose 95% of their ability to maintain attention sufficient to discern significant events.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Mary W. (1999) ''The Appropriate and Effective Use of Security Technologies in  U.S. Schools, A Guide for Schools and Law Enforcement Agencies'', Sandia National Laboratories&lt;/ref&gt; With two monitors this is cut in half again.&lt;ref&gt;Sulman, N.; Sanocki, T.; Goldgof, D.; Kasturi, R., ''How effective is human video surveillance performance?, Pattern Recognition'', ICPR 2008. 19th International Conference on, vol., no., pp.1,3, 8-11 Dec. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Given that many facilities have dozens or even hundreds of cameras, the task is clearly beyond human ability. In general, the camera views of empty hallways, storage facilities, parking lots or structures are exceedingly boring and thus attention is quickly attenuated. When multiple cameras are monitored, typically employing a wall monitor or bank of monitors with split screen views and rotating every several seconds between one set of cameras and the next, the visual tedium is quickly overwhelming. While video surveillance cameras proliferated with great adoption by users ranging from car dealerships and shopping plazas to schools and businesses to highly secured facilities such as nuclear plants, it was recognized in hindsight that video surveillance by human officers (also called "operators") was impractical and ineffective. Extensive video surveillance systems were relegated to merely recording for possible forensic use to identify someone, after the fact of a theft, arson, attack or incident. Where wide angle camera views were employed, particularly for large outdoor areas, severe limitations were discovered even for this purpose due to insufficient resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Nuechterlein, K.H., Parasuraman, R., &amp; Jiang, Q. (1983). 
''Visual sustained attention: Image degradation produces rapid sensitivity decrement over time''. Science, 220, 327-329&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases it is impossible to identify the trespasser or perpetrator because their image is too tiny on the monitor.

=== Earlier attempts at solution ===

==== Motion detection cameras ====

In response to the shortcomings of human guards to watch surveillance monitors long-term, the first solution was to add [[Motion detector|motion detectors]] to cameras. It was reasoned that an intruder's or perpetrator's motion would send an alert to the remote monitoring officer obviating the need for constant human vigilance. The problem was that in an outdoor environment there is constant motion or changes of pixels that comprise the total viewed image on screen. The motion of leaves on trees blowing in the wind, litter along the ground, insects, birds, dogs, shadows, headlights, sunbeams and so forth all comprise motion. This caused hundreds or even thousands of false alerts per day, rendering this solution inoperable except in indoor environments during times of non-operating hours.

==== Advanced video motion detection ====

The next evolution reduced false alerts to a degree but at the cost of complicated and time-consuming manual calibration. Here, changes of a target such as a person or vehicle relative to a fixed background are detected. Where the background changes seasonally or due to other changes, the reliability deteriorates over time. The economics of responding to too many false alerts again proved to be an obstacle and this solution was insufficient.

=== Advent of true video analytics ===

Machine learning of visual recognition relates to patterns and their classification.&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Domingos, ''The Master Algorithm: How the
Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World'', September 22, 2015 Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies, E. R. (2012) ''Computer and Machine Vision, Fourth Edition: Theory, Algorithms, Practicalities'' Academic Press, Waltham Mass.&lt;/ref&gt; True video analytics can distinguish the human form, vehicles and boats or selected objects from the general movement of all other objects and visual static or changes in pixels on the monitor. It does this by [[pattern recognition|recognizing patterns]]. When the object of interest, for example a human, violates a preset rule, for example that the number of people shall not exceed zero in a pre-defined area during a defined time interval, then an alert is sent. A red rectangle or so-called "bounding box" will typically automatically follow the detected intruder, and a short video clip of this is sent as the alert.

== Practical application ==

=== Real-time preventative action ===

The detection of intruders using video surveillance has limitations based on economics and the nature of video cameras. Typically, cameras outdoors are set to a wide angle view and yet look out over a long distance. Frame rate per second and dynamic range to handle brightly lit areas and dimly lit ones further challenge the camera to actually be adequate to see a moving human intruder. At night, even in illuminated outdoor areas, a moving subject does not gather enough light per frame per second and so, unless quite close to the camera, will appear as a thin wisp or barely discernible ghost or completely invisible. Conditions of glare, partial obscuration, rain, snow, fog, and darkness all compound the problem. Even when a human is directed to look at the actual location on a monitor of a subject in these conditions, the subject will usually not be detected. The A.I. is able to impartially look at the entire image and all cameras' images simultaneously. Using statistical models of degrees of deviation from its learned pattern of what constitutes the human form it will detect an intruder with high reliability and a low false alert rate even in adverse conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Dufour, Jean-Yves, ''Intelligent Video Surveillance Systems'', John Wiley Publisher (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Its learning is based on approximately a quarter million images of humans in various positions, angles, postures, and so forth.

A one megapixel camera with the onboard video analytics was able to detect a human at a distance of about 350' and an angle of view of about 30 degrees in non-ideal conditions. Rules could be set for a "virtual fence" or intrusion into a pre-defined area. Rules could be set for directional travel, object left behind, crowd formation and some other conditions.

==== Talk-down ====

One of the most powerful features of the system is that a human officer or operator, receiving an alert from the A.I., could immediately talk down over outdoor public address loudspeakers to the intruder. This had high deterrence value as most crimes are opportunistic and the risk of capture to the intruder becomes so pronounced when a live person is talking to them that they are very likely to desist from intrusion and to retreat. The security officer would describe the actions of the intruder so that the intruder had no doubt that a real person was watching them. The officer would announce that the intruder was breaking the law and that law enforcement was being contacted and that they were being video-recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Hantman, Ken (2014) [http://perimeterprotectivesystems.com/content/about-video-analytics/ ''What is Video Analytics, Simply Explained'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Verified breach report ====

The police receive a tremendous number of false alarms from burglar alarms. In fact the security industry reports that over 98% of such alarms are false ones. Accordingly, the police give very low priority response to burglar alarms and can take from twenty minutes to two hours to respond to the site. By contrast, the video analytic-detected crime is reported to the central monitoring officer, who verifies with his or her own eyes that it is a real crime in progress. He or she then dispatches to the police who give such calls their highest priority.

==== Continuing advances ====

Analytics work with [[digital camera]]s or [[analog camera]]s that have [[analog-to-digital converter]]s. Various companies aside from VideoIQ and Avigilon offer video analytics. In many cases the software samples down to standard definition or less, regardless of the camera's resolution. The advance achieved by Avigilon is true analytics on up to exceedingly high-resolution 30 megapixel cameras.

== Behavioral analytics  ==

=== Active environments ===

While rule-based video analytics worked economically and reliably for many security applications there are many situations in which it cannot work.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Derek, ''Finding &amp; Selling The Value of Analytics'', SDM Magazine (Sept 2015) BNP Media II, Troy Michigan&lt;/ref&gt; For an indoor or outdoor area where no one belongs during certain times of day, for example overnight, or for areas where no one belongs at any time such as a [[Cell site|cell tower]], traditional rule-based analytics are perfectly appropriate. In the example of a cell tower the rare time that a service technician may need to access the area would simply require calling in with a pass-code to put the monitoring response "on test" or inactivated for the brief time the authorized person was there.

But there are many security needs in active environments in which hundreds or thousands of people belong all over the place all the time. For example, a college campus, an active factory, a hospital or any active operating facility. It is not possible to set rules that would discriminate between legitimate people and criminals or wrong-doers.

==== Overcoming the problem of active environments ====

Using behavioral analytics, a self-learning, non-rule-based A.I. takes the data from video cameras and continuously classifies objects and events that it sees. For example, a person crossing a street is one classification. A group of people is another classification. A vehicle is one classification, but with continued learning a public bus would be discriminated from a small truck and that from a motorcycle. With increasing sophistication, the system recognizes patterns in human behavior. For example, it might observe that individuals pass through a controlled access door one at a time. The door opens, the person presents their proximity card or tag, the person passes through and the door closes. This pattern of activity, observed repeatedly, forms a basis for what is normal in the view of the camera observing that scene. Now if an authorized person opens the door but a second "tail-gating" unauthorized person grabs the door before it closes and passes through, that is the sort of anomaly that would create an alert. This type of analysis is much more complex than the rule-based analytics. While the rule-based analytics work mainly to detect intruders into areas where no one is normally present at defined times of day, the behavioral analytics works where people are active to detect things that are out of the ordinary.

A fire breaking out outdoors would be an unusual event and would cause an alert, as would a rising cloud of smoke. Vehicles driving the wrong way into a one-way driveway would also typify the type of event that has a strong visual signature and would deviate from the repeatedly observed pattern of vehicles driving the correct one-way in the lane. Someone thrown to the ground by an attacker would be an unusual event that would likely cause an alert. This is situation-specific. So if the camera viewed a gymnasium where wrestling was practiced the A.I. would learn it is usual for one human to throw another to the ground, in which case it would not alert on this observation.

==== What the artificial intelligence 'understands' ====

The A.I. does not know or understand what a human is, or a fire, or a vehicle. It is simply finding characteristics of these things based on their size, shape, color, reflectivity, angle, orientation, motion, and so on. It then finds that the objects it has classified have typical patterns of behavior. For example, humans walk on sidewalks and sometimes on streets but they don't climb up the sides of buildings very often. Vehicles drive on streets but don't drive on sidewalks. Thus the anomalous behavior of someone scaling a building or a vehicle veering onto a sidewalk would trigger an alert.

==== Varies from traditional mindset of security systems  ====

Typical alarm systems are designed to not miss true positives (real crime events) and to have as low of a false alarm rate as possible. In that regard, burglar alarms miss very few true positives but have a very high false alarm rate even in the controlled indoor environment. Motion detecting cameras miss some true positives but are plagued with overwhelming false alarms in an outdoor environment. Rule-based analytics reliably detect most true positives and have a low rate of false positives but cannot perform in active environments, only in empty ones. Also they are limited to the simple discrimination of whether an intruder is present or not.

Something as complex or subtle as a fight breaking out or an employee breaking a safety procedure is not possible for a rule based analytics to detect or discriminate. With behavioral analytics, it is. Places where people are moving and working do not present a problem. However, the A.I. may spot many things that appear anomalous but are innocent in nature. For example, if students at a campus walk on a plaza, that will be learned as normal. If a couple of students decided to carry a large sheet outdoors flapping in the wind, that might indeed trigger an alert. The monitoring officer would be alerted to look at his or her monitor and would see that the event is not a threat and would then ignore it. The degree of deviation from norm that triggers an alert can be set so that only the most abnormal things are reported. However, this still constitutes a new way of human and A.I. interaction not typified by the traditional alarm industry mindset. This is because there will be many false alarms that may nevertheless be valuable to send to a human officer who can quickly look and determine if the scene requires a response. In this sense, it is a "tap on the shoulder" from the A.I. to have the human look at something.

==== Limitations of behavioral analytics ====

Because so many complex things are being processed continuously, the software samples down to the very low resolution of only [[Common_Intermediate_Format|1 CIF]] to conserve computational demand. The 1 CIF resolution means that an object the size of a human will not be detected if the camera utilized is wide angle and the human is more than sixty to eighty feet distant depending on conditions. Larger objects like vehicles or smoke would be detectable at greater distances.

==== Quantification of situational awareness  ====

The utility of artificial intelligence for security does not exist in a vacuum, and its development was not driven by purely academic or scientific study. Rather, it is addressed to real world needs, and hence, economic forces. Its use for non-security applications such as operational efficiency, shopper heat-mapping of display areas (meaning how many people are in a certain area in a retail space), and attendance at classes are developing uses.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, Illy, ''The Evolution of Video Analytics'', Security Sales &amp;  Integration magazine (August 11, 2012) Security Sales &amp; Integration, Framingham MA&lt;/ref&gt; Humans are not as well qualified as A.I. to compile and recognize patterns consisting of very large data sets requiring simultaneous calculations in multiple remote viewed locations. There is nothing natively human about such awareness. Such multi-tasking has been shown to defocus human attention and performance. A.I.s have the ability to handle such data. For the purposes of security interacting with video cameras they functionally have better visual acuity than humans or the machine approximation to it.  For judging subtleties of behaviors or intentions of subjects or degrees of threat, humans remain far superior at the present state of the technology. So the A.I. in security functions to broadly scan beyond human capability and to vet the data to a first level of sorting of relevance and to alert the human officer who then takes over the function of assessment and response.

Security in the practical world is economically determined so that the expenditure of preventative security will never typically exceed the perceived cost of the risk to be avoided. Studies have shown that companies typically only spend about one twenty-fifth the amount on security that their actual losses cost them.&lt;ref&gt;Bressler, Martin S.,
''The Impact of Crime on Business: A Model of Prevention, Detection &amp; Remedy'', Journal of Management and Marketing Research (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; What by pure economic theory should be an equivalence or homeostasis, thus falls vastly short of it. One theory that explains this is [[cognitive dissonance]], or the ease with which unpleasant things like risk can be shunted from the conscious mind. Nevertheless, security is a major expenditure, and comparison of the costs of different means of security is always foremost amongst security professionals.

Another reason that future security threats or losses are under-assessed is that often only the direct cost of a potential loss is considered instead of the spectrum of consequential losses that are concomitantly experienced. For example, the vandalism-destruction of a custom production machine in a factory or of a refrigerated tractor trailer would result in a long replacement time during which customers could not be served, resulting in loss of their business. A violent crime will have extensive public relations damage for an employer, beyond the direct liability for failing to protect the employee.

Behavioral analytics uniquely functions beyond simple security and, due to its ability to observe breaches in standard patterns of protocols, it can effectively find unsafe acts of employees that may result in workers comp or public liability incidents. Here too, the assessment of future incidents' costs falls short of the reality. A study by [[Liberty Mutual|Liberty Mutual Insurance Company]] showed that the cost to employers is about six times the direct insured cost, since uninsured costs of consequential damages include temporary replacement workers, hiring costs for replacements, training costs, managers' time in reports or court, adverse morale on other workers, and effect on customer and public relations.&lt;ref&gt;''Safety Index Report'', Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; The potential of A.I. in the form of behavioral analytics to proactively intercept and prevent such incidents is significant.

'''Barbara Adriaens''', alias Willem Adriaens (1611 –  fl. 1636), was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] soldier. Her case belongs to the most known and well documented legal cases of female [[transvestism]] and homosexuality during the early modern age in the [[Netherlands]].

Adriaens was at the age of thirteen placed in a house of correction for public drunkenness. After she was released, she tried to support herself as a domestic and a [[seamstress]]. In 1627 or 1628, she adopted male clothing and presented as male under the name Willem Adriaens. As such, she enlisted in the army. In [[Amsterdam]], she married a woman, Hilletje Jans, who did not know of her anatomy. She avoided consummating the marriage by claiming to be sick. Her wife suspected her to be female, and after having accused her of this in public after an argument outside a public house, they caused a riot where Adriaens was almost [[lynched]] and then brought to trial. She stated in court that she had never felt sexual attraction to males, and her land lady witnessed that she was known to have a taste for female prostitutes. Homosexuality was punishable by death, but this law was in fact not used for female homosexuality, as intercourse was defined by penetration, and it was therefore deemed necessary that a female have a clitoris big enough to penetrate a women with for it to be considered a sexual act. Another criteria was that the women live together in a male and one female role. The last criteria was fulfilled, and the prosecutor recommended the death penalty. However, the French [[Duchess de Bouillon]], who was visiting the town at this point, took an interest in the case, and prevented a death sentence. Instead, Adriaens was [[Exile|banished]] for a period of 24 years: according to reports, she was escorted out of town by great crowds. Her wife was given no punishment as she, which was common, was deemed not to have known anything of the true gender of her spouse. In 1636, Adriaens was again tried for the identical crime in Groningen, where she had lived as a man and married a woman, Alke Peter. This time she was banished for life. Her later life is unknown.

Headquartered in [[Leverkusen]], where its illuminated corporate logo, the Bayer cross, is a landmark, Bayer's areas of business include human and veterinary pharmaceuticals; consumer healthcare products; agricultural chemicals and biotechnology products; and high-value [[polymers]]. The company is a component of the [[Euro Stoxx 50]] [[stock market index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.boerse-frankfurt.de/index/constituents/Euro_Stoxx_50#Constituents|title=Euro Stoxx 50, Börse Frankfurt (Frankfurt Stock Exchange)|publisher=Deutsche Boerse|access-date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Werner Baumann]] has been CEO since 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thomas |first1=Natalie |title=Bayer confirms Werner Baumann as new chief |url=https://www.ft.com/content/33118c7f-c1af-3ea0-8eaf-134a0530c04f |work=Financial Times |date=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in [[Barmen]] in 1863 as a [[Dye|dyestuffs]] factory, Bayer's first and best-known product was [[aspirin]]. In 1898 Bayer [[trademarked]] the name ''[[heroin]]'' for the drug diacetylmorphine and marketed it as a cough suppressant and non-addictive substitute for [[morphine]] until 1910. Bayer also introduced [[phenobarbital]]; [[prontosil]], the first widely used antibiotic and the subject of the 1939 Nobel Prize in Medicine; the antibiotic Cipro ([[ciprofloxacin]]); and Yaz ([[drospirenone]]) [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pills]].

In 1925 Bayer was one of six chemical companies that merged to form [[IG Farben]],{{sfn|Tammen|1978|p=195}} the world's largest chemical and pharmaceutical company. The [[Allied Control Council]] seized IG Farben after [[World War II]],{{efn|name=seized}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Law No. 9 |url=http://images.library.wisc.edu/History/EFacs/GerRecon/PropControl/reference/history.propcontrol.i0039.pdf |publisher=Allied Control Council|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922015412/http://images.library.wisc.edu/History/EFacs/GerRecon/PropControl/reference/history.propcontrol.i0039.pdf|archive-date=22 September 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of its role in the [[Nazi]] war effort and involvement in [[the Holocaust]], which included using slave labour from concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2001|pp=xxi–xxii}}; {{harvnb|Dickerman|2017|p=440}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was split into its six constituent companies in 1951, then split again into three: BASF, Bayer and Hoechst.{{sfn|Hayes|2001|p=xxii}}&lt;ref name=Schneibel19Aug2011&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dw.com/en/stock-of-former-nazi-chemicals-giant-to-be-delisted/a-15327052| first=Gerhard|last=Schneibel| title=Stock of former Nazi chemicals giant to be delisted|work=Deutsche Welle| date=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayer played a key role in the [[Wirtschaftswunder]] in post-war [[West Germany]], quickly regaining its position as one of the world's largest chemical and pharmaceutical corporations. In 2006 the company acquired [[Schering AG|Schering]], in 2014 it acquired [[Merck &amp; Co.]]'s consumer business, with brands such as Claritin, Coppertone and Dr. Scholl's, and in 2018 it acquired [[Monsanto]], a leading producer of genetically engineered crops, for $63 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Neate |first1=Rupert |title=Monsanto to ditch its infamous name after sale to Bayer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/04/monsanto-to-ditch-its-infamous-name-after-sale-to-bayer |work=The Guardian |date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bayer CropScience develops [[genetically modified crops]] and [[pesticides]].

===Foundation===
[[File:Farbenfabrik vorm. Friedr. Bayer &amp; Comp 1908.jpg|left|thumb|Share of Farbenfabriken vorm. Friedr. Bayer &amp; Comp in Elberfeld, issued 1 May 1908]]

Bayer AG was founded as a [[Dye|dyestuffs]] factory in 1863 in [[Barmen]] (later part of [[Wuppertal]]), Germany, by [[Friedrich Bayer]] and his partner, Johann Friedrich Weskott, a master dyer.{{sfn|Lewis|Zitzlsperger|2016|p=92}} Bayer was responsible for the commercial tasks. [[Fuchsine]] and [[aniline]] became the company's most important products.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The headquarters and most production facilities moved from Barmen to a larger area in [[Elberfeld]] in 1866. Friedrich Bayer (1851–1920), son of the company’s founder, was a chemist and joined the company in 1873. After the death of his father in 1880, the company became a joint-stock company, Farbenfabriken vorm. Friedr.

A further expansion in Elberfeld was impossible, so the company moved to the village Wiesdorf at Rhein and settled in the area of the [[alizarin]] producer [[Carl Leverkus|Leverkus and Sons]]. A new city, [[Leverkusen]], was founded there in 1930 and became home to Bayer AG's headquarters. The company's corporate logo, the Bayer cross, was introduced in 1904, consisting of the word ''BAYER'' written vertically and horizontally, sharing the ''Y'' and enclosed in a circle.{{sfn|Sánchez-Serrano|2011|p=51}} An illuminated version of the logo is a landmark in Leverkusen.&lt;ref&gt;Europe Tourism. 5 March 2015 [http://europetourism.ga/category/landmarks/ landmarks Landmarks: Cologne: Nearby Attractions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aspirin===
[[File:Aspirin-Fläschchen.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Bottle of Bayer aspirin, 1899]]
Bayer's first major product was [[acetylsalicylic acid]]—first described by French chemist [[Charles Frederic Gerhardt]] in 1853{{sfn|Schrör|2016|p=12}}—a modification of [[salicylic acid]] or [[salicin]], a [[folk remedy]] found in the [[Bark (botany)|bark]] of the [[willow]] plant.{{sfn|Schrör|2016|p=8}}&lt;ref name=Mahdi2006/&gt; By 1899 Bayer's trademark [[Aspirin]] was registered worldwide for Bayer's brand of acetylsalicylic acid, but it lost its trademark status in the United States, France and the United Kingdom after the confiscation of Bayer's US assets and trademarks during [[World War I]] by the United States, and because of the subsequent widespread usage of the word.&lt;ref name=Tulett28May2014/&gt;

There is an unresolved controversy over the roles played by Bayer scientists in the development of aspirin. [[Arthur Eichengrün]], a Bayer chemist, said he was the first to discover an aspirin formulation that did not have the unpleasant [[adverse effect|side effects]] of [[nausea]] and [[gastric pain]]. He also said he had invented the name ''aspirin'' and was the first person to use the new formulation to test its safety and efficacy. Bayer contends that aspirin was discovered by [[Felix Hoffmann]] to help his father, who had [[arthritis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Felix Hoffmann ist der "Vater" des Aspirin|date=September 1999|publisher=Bayer AG, courtesy of LaHave Media Services Limited|url=http://pressearchiv-kubitschek.www.de/pharma-presse/presseerklaerungen/texte/pharma_medikamente/bayer/bayer_110999.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928132933/http://pressearchiv-kubitschek.www.de/pharma-presse/presseerklaerungen/texte/pharma_medikamente/bayer/bayer_110999.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various sources support the conflicting claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|date=1999|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|url=http://www.rsc.org/pdf/pressoffice/1999/annconf99press3.pdf|title=Jewish Scientist's Claim to Discover Aspirin Denied by Nazis|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050528215006/http://www.rsc.org/pdf/pressoffice/1999/annconf99press3.pdf|archive-date=28 May 2005|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sneader&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sneader, Walter|date=23 December 2000|title=The discovery of aspirin: a reappraisal|journal=BMJ|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/321/7276/1591|volume=321 |issue=7276 |pages=1591–1594 |year=2000 |pmid=11124191 |pmc=1119266 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.321.7276.1591}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most mainstream historians attribute the invention of aspirin to Hoffmann and/or Eichengrün.&lt;ref name=Sneader/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mahdi2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mahdi|first1=J.G.| last2=Mahdi|first2=A.J.|last3=Mahdi|first3=A.J.|last4=Bowen|first4=I.D. |title=The historical analysis of aspirin discovery, its relation to the willow tree and antiproliferative and anticancer potential |journal=Cell Proliferation |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=147–155 |date=April 2006  |pmid=16542349 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2184.2006.00377.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phenobarbital===
In 1903 Bayer licensed the patent for the hypnotic drug [[diethylbarbituric acid]] from its inventors Emil Fischer and Joseph von Mering. It was marketed under the trade name Veronal as a sleep aid beginning in 1904. Systematic investigations of the effect of structural changes on potency and duration of action at Bayer led to the discovery of [[phenobarbital]] in 1911 and the discovery of its potent anti-epileptic activity in 1912. Phenobarbital was among the most widely used drugs for the treatment of epilepsy through the 1970s, and as of 2014 it remains on the World Health Organization's list of essential medications.&lt;ref name="Yasiry Z, Shorvon SD 26–39"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yasiry Z, Shorvon SD |title=How phenobarbital revolutionized epilepsy therapy: the story of phenobarbital therapy in epilepsy in the last 100 years |journal=Epilepsia |volume=53 Suppl 8 |issue= |pages=26–39 |date=December 2012  |pmid=23205960 |doi=10.1111/epi.12026 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="López-Muñoz F, Ucha-Udabe R, Alamo C 329–43"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=López-Muñoz F, Ucha-Udabe R, Alamo C |title=The history of barbiturates a century after their clinical introduction |journal=Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=329–343 |date=December 2005 |pmid=18568113 |pmc=2424120 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
[[File:BayerHeroin1911.png|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Bayer advertisement, 1911]]
During [[World War I]] (1914–1918), Bayer's assets, including the rights to its name and trademarks, were confiscated in the United States, Canada and several other countries.&lt;ref name="bayer1"/&gt; In the United States and Canada, Bayer's assets and trademarks, including the well-known Bayer cross, were acquired by [[Sterling Drug]], a predecessor of [[Sterling Winthrop]] and were not reclaimed until 1994.

In 1916 Bayer scientists discovered [[suramin]], an anti-[[trypanosomes|parasite]] drug that is still sold by Bayer under the brand name Germanin. The formula of suramin was kept secret by Bayer for commercial reasons, but it was elucidated and published in 1924 by [[Ernest Fourneau]] and his team at the [[Pasteur Institute]].{{sfn|Sneader|2005|pp=378–379}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fourneau | first1 = E. | last2 = Th | last3 = Vallée | first3 = J. | year = 1924 | title = Sur une nouvelle série de médicaments trypanocides | url = | journal = Comptes rendus de l'Académie des Sciences | volume = 178 | issue = | page = 675 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is on the [[World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO Model List of EssentialMedicines|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML_18_eng.pdf?ua=1|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overview===
In 1953 Bayer brought the first neuroleptic ([[chlorpromazine]]) onto the German market.{{sfn|Bangen|1992}}{{page needed|date=September 2018}} In the 1960s Bayer introduced a pregnancy test, [[Primodos]], that consisted of two pills that contained [[norethisterone]] (as acetate) and [[ethinylestradiol]]. It detected pregnancy by inducing [[menstruation]] in women who were not pregnant; the presence or absence of menstrual bleeding was then used to determine whether the user was pregnant. The test became the subject of controversy when it was blamed for [[birth defect]]s, and it was withdrawn from the market in the mid-1970s. Litigation in the 1980s ended inconclusively. A review of the matter by the [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] in 2014 assessed the studies performed to date and found the evidence for adverse effects to be inconclusive.&lt;ref name=MHRAreview2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/comms-ic/documents/websiteresources/con404471.pdf|title=Assessment of historical evidence on Primodos and congenital malformations – a synopsis|publisher=Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency|date=2014|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alka-Seltzer Ged Handelsmerk.JPG|thumb|Bayer has owned [[Alka-Seltzer]] since 1978.]]
In 1978 Bayer purchased [[Miles Laboratories]] and its subsidiaries Miles Canada and [[Cutter Laboratories]], acquiring along with them a variety of product lines including [[Alka-Seltzer]], [[Flintstones chewable vitamins|Flintstones vitamins]] and [[One A Day|One-A-Day]] vitamins, and Cutter [[insect repellent]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/adualtrusttrans02cuttrich/adualtrusttrans02cuttrich_djvu.txt "Cutter Laboratories: 1897–1972. A Dual Trust"]. The Bancroft Library, University of California/Berkeley, Regional Oral History Office, transcript 1972–1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the purchase of Cutter, Bayer acquired Cutter's [[Factor VIII]] business. Factor VIII, a clotting agent used to treat [[hemophilia]], was produced, at the time, by processing donated blood. In the [[History of HIV/AIDS#1981: From GRID to AIDS|early days of the AIDS epidemic]], people with hemophilia were found to have higher rates of AIDS, and by 1983 the CDC had identified [[Contaminated haemophilia blood products|contaminated blood products]] as a source of infection. According to the ''New York Times'', this was "one of the worst drug-related medical disasters in history". Companies, including Bayer, developed new ways to treat donated blood with heat to decontaminate it, and these new products were introduced early in 1984. In 1997 Bayer and the other three makers of such blood products agreed to pay $660 million to settle cases on behalf of more than 6,000 hemophiliacs infected in United States. But in 2003 documents emerged showing that Cutter had continued to sell unheated blood products in markets outside the US until 1985, including in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Japan and Argentina, to offload a product they were unable to sell in Europe and the US; they also continued manufacturing the unheated product for several months. Bayer said it did this because some countries were doubtful about the efficacy of the new product.&lt;ref name = NYTimes2003&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/22/business/2-paths-of-bayer-drug-in-80-s-riskier-one-steered-overseas.html | title = 2 Paths of Bayer Drug in 80's: Riskier One Steered Overseas | last1=Bogdanich|first1=Walt|authorlink1=Walt Bogdanich|last2=Koli|first2=Eric|authorlink2=|work=The New York Times |date=19 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayer has been involved in other controversies regarding its drug products. In the late 1990s it introduced a [[statin]] drug, Baycol ([[cerivastatin]]), but after 52 deaths were attributed to it, Bayer discontinued it in 2001. The side effect was [[rhabdomyolysis]], causing [[renal failure]], which occurred with a tenfold greater frequency in patients treated with Baycol in comparison to those prescribed alternate medications of the statin class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Corporate structure==
In 2003, to separate operational and strategic managements, Bayer AG was reorganized into a [[holding company]]. The group's core businesses were transformed into limited companies, each controlled by Bayer [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]]. These companies were: Bayer CropScience AG; Bayer HealthCare AG; [[Bayer MaterialScience|Bayer MaterialScience AG]] and Bayer Chemicals AG, and the three service limited companies Bayer Technology Services [[GmbH]], Bayer Business Services GmbH and Bayer Industry Services GmbH &amp; Co. OHG. In 2016, the company began a second restructuring with the aim of allowing it to transition to a [[life sciences]] based company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manufacturingchemist.com/news/article_page/Bayer_organises_its_Life_Science_businesses_into_three_divisions_Pharmaceuticals_Consumer_Health_and_Crop_Science/112053|title=Bayer organises its Life Science businesses into three divisions: Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Health and Crop Science|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By divesting its Chemicals division in 2004 and with the aim of off-loading its Materials division by mid-2016, Bayer will be left with the four core units, as depicted below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bayer.com/en/profile-and-organization.aspx | title=Names, Facts, Figures about Bayer | date=31 December 2015 | publisher=Bayer | accessdate=7 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.press.bayer.com/baynews/baynews.nsf/id/Bayer-aligns-organization-with-Life-Science-businesses|title=Bayer aligns organization with Life Science businesses - Bayer News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bayer CropScience===
Bayer CropScience has products in crop protection (i.e. [[pesticides]]), nonagricultural [[pest (animal)|pest]] control, [[seeds]] and plant [[biotechnology]]. In addition to conventional agrochemical business, it is involved in [[Genetically modified food|genetic engineering of food]].&lt;ref name="AR2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.annualreport2010.bayer.com/en/bayer-annual-report-2010.pdfx |title=Annual Report 2010 |accessdate=1 March 2011 |publisher=Bayer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Bayer AG acquired Aventis (now part of [[Sanofi]]) CropScience and fused it with their own agrochemicals division (Bayer Pflanzenschutz or "Crop Protection") to form Bayer CropScience; the Belgian biotech company [[Plant Genetic Systems]] became part of Bayer through the Aventis acquisition.&lt;ref name="AR2010" /&gt;  Also in 2002, Bayer AG acquired the Dutch seed company Nunhems, which at the time was one of the world's top five seed companies.&lt;ref&gt;Fruitnet. 4 April 2014 [http://www.fruitnet.com/americafruit/article/161152/bayer-announces-nunhems-rebranding Bayer Cropscience rebrands Nunhems]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ram HH and Yadava, R. Genetic Resources and Seed Enterprises: Management and Policies. New India Publishing, 2007 {{ISBN|9788189422653}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|270}} In 2006, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that Bayer CropScience's LibertyLink genetically modified rice had contaminated the U.S. rice supply. Shortly after the public learned of the contamination, the E.U. banned imports of U.S. long-grain rice and the futures price plunged. In April 2010, a Lonoke County, Arkansas jury awarded a dozen farmers $48 million. The case is currently on appeal to the Arkansas Supreme Court. On 1 July 2011 Bayer CropScience agreed to a global settlement for up to $750 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bloomberg|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/02/business/02rice.html|newspaper=The New York Times | title=Bayer Settles With Farmers Over Modified Rice Seeds|date=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, the firm announced plans to invest $1 billion in the [[United States]] between 2013 and 2016.  A Bayer spokesperson said that the largest investments will be made to expand the production of its herbicide Liberty.  Liberty is an alternative to Monsanto's product, [[Glyphosate|Roundup]], which are both used to kill weeds.

==Bayer 04 Leverkusen==
{{Main|Bayer 04 Leverkusen}}
In 1904, the company founded the sports club TuS 04 ("Turn- und Spielverein der Farbenfabriken vorm. Friedr. Bayer &amp; Co."), later SV Bayer 04 ("Sportvereinigung Bayer 04 Leverkusen"), finally becoming [[TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen]] ("Turn- und Sportverein") in 1984, generally, however, known simply as [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen]]. The club is best known for its football team, but has been involved in many other sports, including athletics, fencing, team handball, volleyball, boxing, and basketball. TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen is one of the largest sports clubs in Germany. The company also supports similar clubs at other company sites, including Dormagen (particularly handball), Wuppertal (particularly volleyball), and Krefeld-Uerdingen (featuring another former Bundesliga football club, SC Bayer 05 Uerdingen, now [[KFC Uerdingen 05]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bayer04.de/B04-DEU/de/_site_index.aspx|title=Bayer 04 Leverkusen Fussball GmbH|work=bayer04.de|access-date=26 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126142444/http://www.bayer04.de/b04-deu/de/_site_index.aspx|archive-date=26 January 2017|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new location is east side of [[Gir National Park]] in [[Amreli district]] of [[Gujarat]]. After inclusion of New Jesal sanctuary the area of this forest will go to 1600&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which is bigger than [[Gir National Park|Gir sanctuary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-03-19/ahmedabad/27789455_1_gir-sanctuary-asiatic-lions-mitiala New sanctuary for lions to come up at Jesar]&lt;/ref&gt; The Gujarat state government insisted on shifting the lions to this forest claiming that lions were pride of Gujarat. However the [[Government of India|central government]] is pressuring Gujarat state government to shift some lions in [[Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary]]. There are almost 110 lions outside the protected area in Gir forest. A pride of about 20 lions will be introduce in three different area in this forest.

==Plot==
{{See also|List of Bleach characters}}

[[Ichigo Kurosaki]] is a teenager from Karakura Town who can see ghosts, a talent which lets him meet supernatural trespasser [[Rukia Kuchiki]]. Rukia is one of the [[List of Soul Reapers in Bleach|Soul Reapers]], soldiers trusted with ushering the souls of the dead from the World of the Living to the {{nihongo4|Soul Society|尸魂界 {{small|(ソウル·ソサエティ)}}||lit. "Dead Spirit World"}}—the afterlife realm from which she originates—and with fighting [[List of Hollows in Bleach|Hollows]], monstrous lost souls who can harm both ghosts and humans. When she is severely wounded defending Ichigo from a Hollow she is pursuing, Rukia transfers her powers to Ichigo so that he may fight in her stead while she recovers her strength. Rukia is thereby trapped in an ordinary human body, and must advise Ichigo as he balances the demands of his substitute Soul Reaper duties and attending high school. For aid in hunting the Hollows, the pair ally with a trio of other spiritually empowered teenagers: Ichigo's high school classmate [[Orihime Inoue]], best friend [[Yasutora Sado|Yasutora "Chad" Sado]] and the Quincy—humans who can fight Hollows—[[Uryū Ishida]].

Eventually, Rukia is arrested by her Soul Reaper superiors and sentenced to death for the illegal act of transferring her powers into a human. Ichigo and friends enlist the help of ex-Soul Reaper scientist [[Kisuke Urahara]], who also enables Ichigo to access his own Soul Reaper powers, to enter Soul Society and rescue Rukia. Shortly after the party's arrival in the Soul Society, conflict arises among the captains of 13 Court Squads when the captain of the fifth company, [[Sōsuke Aizen]], is apparently murdered, which caused the Soul Reapers to begin fighting amongst themselves. However, as Ichigo is almost succeeded in rescuing Rukia and Soul Society on the verge of civil war, Aizen reappears and reveals his intention to obtain the {{nihongo4|Hōgyoku|崩玉||lit. "Crumbling Orb"}}—an orb of immense power—that Kisuke planted in Rukia's human vessel by faking his death and arranging Rukia's execution. Aizen is accompanied by his fellow conspirators, [[Gin Ichimaru]] and Kaname Tōsen who are the third and ninth company's captain, as they use Hollows to cover their escape into the Hollows' realm, {{nihongo4|Hueco Mundo|虚圏 {{small|(ウェコムンド)}}||lit. "Hollow World"}}. Afterwards, Ichigo and Rukia reconciled with the Soul Reapers, who view the former as a powerful ally and designate him as an official substitute Soul Reaper.

Ichigo soon finds himself and his friends in escalating skirmishes with Aizen's army of humanoid Hollows, the [[List of Hollows in Bleach#Arrancar|Arrancar]], as they are joined by the [[List of Bleach characters#Vizards|Vizards]]—Soul Reapers who were victims of Aizen's experiments in creating Soul Reaper/Hollow hybrids. When one of the Espada—Aizen's 10 most powerful Arrancars—kidnaps Orihime, Ichigo and his allies enter Hueco Mundo to invade Aizen's palace. However, as Ichigo rescues Orihime, Aizen reveals her abduction was a distraction as he launch an attack on Karakura Town to sacrifice the souls of the living to create a key to the Soul King's Palace so he can kill the Soul King who reigns over the Soul Society. When the Vizards join the remaining Soul Reapers to face their mutual enemy, Gin reveals his own agenda of assassinating Aizen. However, the latter then used the Hōgyoku to become a Hollow-like being and overpowered everyone. Ichigo ultimately succeeds in subduing Aizen at the cost of his powers and reverts to a normal human.

Months later, preparing for life after high school, Ichigo is called back into action when [[List of Bleach characters#Xcution|Xcution]], a gang of Fullbringers—supernaturally aware humans like Chad—manipulate him and his loved ones in a scheme to siphon his Fullbring abilities. After his Soul Society allies restore his Soul Reaper powers, learning that Xcution's leader Ginjo Kujo was his predecessor and that the substitute Soul Reapers are not fully trusted, Ichigo defeats Ginjo while resolving to continue fighting with the Soul Society.

After Ichigo regained his powers, an army of Quincies known as the {{nihongo4|[[List of Bleach characters#Wandenreich|Wandenreich]]|見えざる帝国 {{small|(ヴァンデンライヒ)}}||lit. "Invisible Empire"}} appear and declare their own war on the Soul Society, after enslaving the Arrancars. The group is led by Yhwach, the ancient progenitor of the Quincies who seeks to kill the Soul King and rid the world from the fear of death. In their first invasion, the Wandenreich killed many Soul Reapers including their head-captain. Uryū joins the Wandenreich as a means to get close to Yhwach, who was responsible for the death of his mother among other Quincies. Later on, Ichigo and his friends aid the Soul Society in fighting the Wandenreich's second invasion, but Yhwach proceeds to slay the Soul King. In the final battle, Yhwach returns to the Soul Society to conquer it, but with the help of Uryū's father, Ichigo and Uryū defeat the Quincy leader.

Years later, Rukia becomes the new captain of the thirteenth company and has a daughter, an apprentice Soul Reaper named Ichika, with her childhood friend [[Renji Abarai]]. Meanwhile, Ichigo and Orihime have a son named Kazui, who is also training to become a Soul Reaper.

==Production==
''Bleach'' was first conceived from [[Tite Kubo]]'s desire to draw a [[Shinigami]] (Soul Reaper) in a [[kimono]], which formed the basis for the design of the Soul Reapers in the series.&lt;ref name="About 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manga.about.com/od/mangaartistinterviews/a/TiteKubo.htm|title=Interview: Tite Kubo (page 1)|author=Deb Aoki|publisher=About.com|accessdate=September 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/28/entertainment/etw-kuboweb28|title=Creator Tite Kubo surprised by 'Bleach' success|author=Charles Solomon|date=August 28, 2008|accessdate=September 17, 2008|work=Los Angeles Times|archivedate=April 23, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423115417/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/28/entertainment/etw-kuboweb28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Kubo thought that the Soul Reapers should use guns, so the first title for the series was "Snipe" (as in "sniper"); however, this was changed with the inclusion of swords.&lt;ref name="SJ 71"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Shonen Jump (magazine)|Shonen Jump]] ''#71'' | publisher=Viz Media | volume=6 | issue=11 | date=November 2008 | title=Tite Kubo's Big Comic-Con Adventure! | pages=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the series was meant to be named "Black" due to the color of the Soul Reapers' clothes, but Kubo thought the title was too generic. He later tried the name of "White," but came to like "Bleach" more for its association with the color white and that he did not find it too obvious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Bleach: Interview with Tite Kubo|work=[[Anime Insider]]|volume=|issue=61|page=39|date=October 2008|publisher=[[Wizard Universe]]|issn=1547-3767 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original story concept was submitted to ''Weekly Shōnen Jump'' shortly after the cancellation of Kubo's previous manga, ''[[Zombiepowder]]'', but was at first rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/person/tite-kubo|title=Tite Kubo|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manga artist [[Akira Toriyama]] saw the story and wrote a letter of encouragement to Kubo.&lt;ref name="LA Times" /&gt; ''Bleach'' was accepted for publication a short time later in 2001, and was initially intended to be a shorter series, with a maximum serialization length of five years.&lt;ref name="LA Times" /&gt; Early plans for the story did not include the hierarchical structure of the Soul Society, but did include some characters and elements that were not introduced into the plot until [[List of Bleach chapters#Volumes 21–40|the Arrancar arc]], such as Ichigo's Soul Reaper parentage.&lt;ref name="About 1" /&gt;

Kubo has cited influences for elements of ''Bleach'' ranging from other manga series to music, foreign language, architecture, and film. He attributed his interest in drawing the supernatural and monsters to [[Shigeru Mizuki]]'s ''[[GeGeGe no Kitaro]]'' and ''Bleach''{{'}}s focus on interesting weaponry and battle scenes to [[Masami Kurumada]]'s ''[[Saint Seiya]]'', manga that Kubo enjoyed as a boy.&lt;ref name="About 1" /&gt; The latter is based on [[Greek mythology]] and Kubo also considered it as a source for his focus on myths, monsters and the afterlife.&lt;ref name="SJ 71"/&gt; The action style and storytelling found in ''Bleach'' are inspired by cinema, though Kubo has not revealed any specific movie as being an influence for fight scenes. When pressed, he told interviewers that he liked ''[[Snatch (film)|Snatch]]'' but did not use it as a model.&lt;ref name="SJ 51"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Shonen Jump ''#51'' | title=none | volume=5 | issue=3 |date=March 2007 | publisher=Viz Media | page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bleach''{{'}}s [[fight choreography]] is instead constructed with the aid of rock music, which the author listens to while imagining the fights in order to give him a sense of pacing for the panel cuts and change of angles through the scenes.&lt;ref name="About 3"/&gt; Kubo prefers to draw realistic injuries in order to render the fight more impactful, by making the readers feel the pain the characters are feeling.&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt; ''Bleach''{{'s}} fight scenes are often broken up with brief gags, which the author inserts when he grows bored during the illustration process.&lt;ref name="About 3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manga.about.com/od/mangaartistinterviews/a/TiteKubo_3.htm|title=Interview: Tite Kubo (page 3)|author=Deb Aoki|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bleach''{{'}}s plotting process is focused around [[Characterisation|character design]]. When writing plotlines or having difficulties generating new material, Kubo begins by thinking of new characters, often ''en masse'', and rereading previous volumes of ''Bleach''.&lt;ref name="About 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PW"&gt;{{cite web |author=Kai-ming Cha |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/1480-kubo-comes-to-comic-con-.html |title=Kubo Comes to Comic-Con |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |publisher=PWxyz, LLC |date=August 4, 2008 |accessdate=September 17, 2008 }}&lt;!-- http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6584260.htmlTiteKubo.htm --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Kubo has said that he likes creating characters that have outward appearances that do not match their true nature—an element that can be found in many ''Bleach'' characters—as he is "attracted to people with that seeming contradiction" and finds an "urge to draw people like that" when he works.&lt;ref name="WSJ 12" /&gt; The terminology used in ''Bleach'' has a variety of inspirations, with each category of characters bearing a different linguistic theme. Many of the names for swords and spells used by Soul Reapers were inspired by ancient [[Japanese literature]]. Hollows and Arrancars use [[Spanish language|Spanish]] terms. Fullbringers use [[English language|English]] vocabulary, with names referencing rock music, and finally, both Quincy and Bounts draw on the [[German language]]. This multilingual terminology, along with the variety in apparent character ethnicities, emphasizes the international nature of the ''Bleach'' settings.&lt;ref name="WSJ 12"&gt;''[[Shonen Jump (magazine)|Shonen Jump]]''. Volume 6, Issue 6. June 2007. [[Viz Media]]. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
''Bleach''{{'}}s plot incorporates the traditional Japanese belief of spirits coexisting with humans and their nature, good or evil, depends on the circumstances.&lt;ref name=Feigenblatt /&gt; An example is Orihime's backstory: she was raised from the age of three by her brother Sora, and prayed for his soul's peace after he died in a car accident.&lt;ref name="ch6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kubo, Tite|title=Bleach, Volume 1|year=2004 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |chapter=Chapter 6|isbn=1-59116-441-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As time went on, she prayed less and Sora became jealous and turned into a Hollow and attacked Orihime. Academic Patrick Drazen says this is a reminder to the audience to not abandon the old ways or risk the spirits taking offense and causing problems in the world.&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"&gt;{{cite book | title=A Gathering of Spirits: Japan's Ghost Story Tradition from Folklore and Kabuki to Anime and Manga | publisher=iUniverse | author=Drazen, Patrick | date=June 29, 2011 | pages=11–12 |isbn=978-1462029426}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bleach'' also incorporates [[Shinto]] themes of purification of "evil spirits through charms, scrolls, incantations, and other rituals."&lt;ref name=Feigenblatt /&gt; Christopher A. Born regards ''Bleach'' as transmitting [[Confucian values]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 1, 2010|title=In the Footsteps of the Master: Confucian Values in Anime and Manga|journal=ASIANetwork Exchange: A Journal for Asian Studies in the Liberal Arts|volume=17|issue=2|pages=39–53|doi=10.16995/ane.206|doi-access=free|last1=Born|first1=Christopher A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Feigenblatt describes ''Bleach'' as being culturally and religiously aware, as it draws upon [[Christianity]] and Caribbean [[Santería]].&lt;ref name=Feigenblatt&gt;{{cite journal | author=von Feigenblatt, Otto F. | title=Japanese Animation as a Global Product: The Lingering Traces of Nijonjinron and the Rise of Globalism and Hybridity | date=July–December 2012 | journal=Journal of History &amp; Social Sciences | issue=2 | volume=3 | pages=1&amp;ndash;14, | ssrn=2195562}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish terms are prevalent throughout the realm of Hueco Mundo,&lt;ref name=Feigenblatt /&gt; while both Quincy and Bounts have been known to associate with the German language, making Kubo's world of characters diverse in race and language as well.&lt;ref name="WSJ 12"/&gt; Von Feigenblatt notes that the Quincy "are clearly inspired by the [[Roman Catholic]] Christian Orders of Knighthood such as the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] and the [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre|Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre]] whose influence is shown in terms of the uniform worn by the Quincy as well as by the symbolism of the cross."&lt;ref name=Feigenblatt /&gt;

===Films===
There are four animated feature films based on the ''Bleach'' series, all of which are directed by [[Noriyuki Abe]], director of the ''Bleach'' anime series. The films were released annually each December starting in 2006, though none were released in 2009. Each movie features an original plotline along with original characters designed by Tite Kubo, which is contrary to the normal practice for anime-based films, as the original author usually has little creative involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=Bleach: The DiamondDust Rebellion |titlelink=Bleach: The DiamondDust Rebellion |year=2008 |others=[[Noriyuki Abe]]  |publisher=[[Toho]] |location=Japan |language=Japanese }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sparrow. He also commented on the series' ability to handle multiple minor character plotlines at the same time, which he considered a point of appeal, in response to fans' claims about a "lack of a story" in ''Bleach''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/772/772283p1.html|title=Bleach: Volume 18 review Blink and you'll miss something very cool|author=Sparrow, A.

He felt it was a rough start for the series with unimpressive battles, overused gags, and a bad introduction for central character Ichigo that causes him to come across "as a frowning punk" whose one good trait is his desire to protect. Despite this, Pine notes that he loves the series, particularly its quirky, lovable characters.&lt;ref name="pine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mania.com/bleach-vol-01_article_82089.html |title=Bleach Vol. #01 |date=February 24, 2005 |publisher=Mania |last=Pine |first=Jarred |accessdate=December 13, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018201823/http://www.mania.com/bleach-vol-01_article_82089.html |archivedate=October 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jason Thompson (writer)|Jason Thompson]] said he was no longer able to take ''Bleach'' seriously after it introduced villains [[Ulquiorra]] and [[Yammy]] in a scene precisely mirroring [[Vegeta]] and [[Nappa (character)|Nappa]]'s arrival in ''[[Dragon Ball|Dragon Ball Z]]'', but acknowledged it was likely intended as a deliberate homage. He also said Kubo was able to avoid the worst artistic failings typical in series which indulge in superpowered combat, but that the battle scenes were still sometimes difficult to follow.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/house-of-1000-manga/2013-01-31|title=Jason Thompson's House of 1000 Manga - The Saga of Shonen Jump Part II|publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |last=Thompson |first=Jason |date=2013-01-31 |accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:17XX Richtrad anagoria.JPG|thumb|Execution wheel (German: ''Richtrad'') with underlays, 18th century; on display at the [[Märkisches Museum]], Berlin]]
The '''breaking wheel''' or '''execution wheel''', also known as the '''Catherine wheel''' or simply the '''Wheel''', was a [[Torture|torture method]] used for [[Capital punishment#Public execution|public execution]] from [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] through [[Middle Ages]] into the [[early modern period]] by breaking a criminal's bones and/or [[Club (weapon)|bludgeoning]] them to death. The practice was abolished in [[Bavaria]] in 1813 and in the [[Electorate of Hesse]] in 1836: the last known execution by the "Wheel" took place in [[Prussia]] in 1841. In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], it was a "[[mirror punishment]]" for [[highwaymen]] and [[Footpad|street thieves]] but was also set out in the ''[[Sachsenspiegel]]'' for [[murder]] and [[arson]].&lt;ref name="MSK"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Menschen im Schatten der Kathedrale: Neuigkeiten aus dem Mittelalter|trans-title=People in the shadow of the cathedral: News from the Middle Ages|url=|last1=Althoff|first1=Gerd|last2=Goetz|first2=Hans-Werner|last3=Schubert|first3=Ernst|authorlink=|publisher=Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft|location= Darmstadt|date=1998|page=332|language=German|volume=|isbn=9783534142217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punishment==
===Execution by wheel===
[[File:Klassisches Radern.png|thumb|Illustration of execution by wheel ([[Augsburg]], Bavaria, 1586): Classic example of the "breaking wheel" punishment, with wheel crucifixions in the background]]
[[File:Städtisches museum zittau - 44.jpg|right|thumb|An execution wheel (German: ''Richtrad'') exhibited in the Museum of Cultural History Franziskanerkloster in [[Zittau]], Saxony, Germany, dated in the centre with year 1775. Bolted to the lower rim edge is an iron blade-like thrust attachment]]
Those convicted as [[Murder|murderers]] and/or [[Robbery|robbers]] to be executed by "the Wheel", sometimes termed to be "Wheeled" or "broken by the Wheel", would be taken to a public stage [[Scaffold (execution site)|scaffold]] site and tied to the floor. The execution Wheel was typically a large wooden spoked wheel, the same as was used on wooden transport carts and [[carriages]] (often with [[iron]] rim), sometimes purposely modified with a rectangular iron thrust attached and extending blade-like from part of the rim. The primary goal of the first act was the agonizing mutilation of the body, not death. Therefore, the most common form would start with breaking the [[leg bones]]. To this end, the [[executioner]] dropped the execution Wheel on the [[Tibia|shinbones]] of the convicted person and then worked his way up to the arms. Here, rhythm and number of beatings were prescribed in each case, sometimes also the number of spokes on the Wheel. To increase its effect, often sharp-edged timbers were placed under the convict's [[joints]]. Later, there were devices in which the convicted person could be "harnessed". Although not commonplace, the executioner could be instructed to execute the convicted person at the end of the first act, by aiming for the neck or heart in a "[[Coup de grâce|coup de grace]]". Even less often, this occurred immediately from the start (from the head down).&lt;ref name="DGDG"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Die Geschichte der Gerichtsbarkeit: vom Gottesurteil bis zum Beginn der modernen Rechtsprechung ; 1000 Jahre Grausamkeit ; Hintergründe, Urteile, Aberglaube, Hexen, Folter, Tod|trans-title=The history of the judicature: from the judgment of God to the beginning of modern jurisprudence; 1000 years of cruelty; Backgrounds, judgments, superstition, witches, torture, death|url=|first=Wolfgang|last=Schild|authorlink=|publisher=Nikol Verlagsgesellschaft mbH|location=Hamburg|date=1997|page=202|language=German|volume=|isbn=9783930656745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second act, the body was braided into another wooden spoked wheel, which was possible through the broken limbs, or tied to the wheel. The wheel was then erected on a mast or pole, like a [[crucifixion]]. After this, the executioner was permitted to [[Decapitation|decapitate]] or [[garrotte]] the convicted if need be. Alternatively, fire was kindled under the Wheel, or the "Wheeled" convict was simply thrown into a fire. Occasionally, a small [[gallows]] was set up on the Wheel, for example, if the guilty verdict in addition to murder was by theft.&lt;ref name="DGDG" /&gt;

Since the body remained on the Wheel after execution, left to scavenging animals, birds and decay, this form of punishment, like the ancient [[crucifixion]], had a sacral function beyond death: According to the belief at that time, this would hinder transition from death to [[resurrection]].&lt;ref name="MSK" /&gt;{{rp|180}}

If the convict fell from the Wheel still alive or the execution failed in some other way, it was interpreted as [[God]]'s intervention. There exist [[Votive offering|votive images]] of saved victims of the Wheel, and there is literature on how best to treat such sustained injuries.&lt;ref name="DGDG" /&gt;{{rp|204}}

The survival time after being "wheeled" or "broken" could be extensive. Accounts exist of a 14th-century murderer who remained conscious for three days after undergoing the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOUyAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA162|pages=162–163|last=Sporschil|first=Johann|title=Geschichte des Entstehens: des Wachsthums und der Grösse der österreichischen Monarchie|volume=2|year=1847|location=Leipzig|publisher=Oscar Banckwitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1348, during the time of the [[Black Death]], a Jewish man named Bona Dies underwent the punishment. The authorities stated he remained conscious for four days and nights afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=211|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1O_PX2wVD0sC&amp;pg=PA211|title=The Black Death|last=Horrox|first=Rosemay|year=1994|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=9780719034985}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1581, the possibly fictitious German [[serial killer]] [[Christman Genipperteinga]] remained conscious for nine days on the breaking wheel before expiring, having been deliberately kept alive with "strong drink".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==History==

===Possible Frankish origins===
Pieter Spierenburg mentions a reference in sixth-century author [[Gregory of Tours]] as a possible origin for the punishment of breaking someone on the wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norberteliasfoundation.nl/network/profile.php?profId=3|title=Pieter Spierenburg|work=Norbert Elias Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Gregory's time, a criminal could be placed in a deep track, and then a heavily laden wagon was driven over him. Thus, the latter practice could be seen as a symbolic re-enactment of the previous penalty in which people were literally driven over by a wagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spierenburg|first=Pieter C.|title=The Spectacle of Suffering: Executions and the Evolution of Repression : from a Preindustrial Metropolis to the European Experience|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NxQ-AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA71|pages=71|year=1984|isbn=9780521261869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In France, the condemned were placed on a cartwheel with their limbs stretched out along the spokes over two sturdy wooden beams. The wheel was made to revolve slowly, and a large [[hammer]] or an iron bar was then applied to the limb over the gap between the beams, breaking the [[bone]]s. This process was repeated several times per limb. Sometimes it was "mercifully" ordered that the executioner should strike the condemned on the chest and abdomen, blows known as {{lang|fr|[[Coup de grâce|coups de grâce]]}} ({{lang-fr|"blows of mercy"}}), which caused fatal injuries. Without those, the broken man could last hours and even days, during which birds could peck at the helpless victim. Eventually, [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] and [[dehydration]] caused death.  In France, a special grace, the ''retentum'', could be granted, by which the condemned was strangled after the second or third blow, or in special cases, even before the breaking began.

===Holy Roman Empire===
[[Image:Klostermayr Radbrechmaschine.jpg|thumb|Breaking-wheel machine used to execute [[Matthias Klostermayr]], Bavaria, 1772.]]
In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the wheel was punishment reserved primarily for men convicted of aggravated murder (murder committed during another crime, or against a family member). Less severe offenders would be cudgelled "top down", with a lethal first blow to the neck.  More heinous criminals were punished "bottom up", starting with the legs, and sometimes being beaten for hours. The number and sequence of blows was specified in the court's sentence (for example, in 1581, the arch-killer [[Peter Niers]], found guilty of 544 murders was, after two days of extended torture, given 42 strikes with the wheel, and was, at last, [[Dismemberment|quartered]] alive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garon|first=Louis|title=Exilium melancholiae|publisher=Josias Städel|location=Strasbourg|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k1hCAAAAcAAJ|pages=553|year=1669}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Corpses were left for [[carrion]]-eaters, and the criminals' heads often placed on a spike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Zürcher Blutgerichtsordnung" (Procedures for the [[Blood Court]] in [[Zurich]]) dates from the 15th century and contains a detailed description of how the breaking on the wheel shall occur: Firstly, the delinquent is placed belly down, bound hands and feet outstretched to a board, and thus dragged by a horse to the place of execution. The wheel is then slammed two times on each arm, one blow above the elbow, the other below. Then, each leg gets the same treatment, above and below the knees. The final ninth blow is given at the middle of the spine, so that it breaks. Then, the broken body is woven onto the wheel (i.e., between the spokes), and the wheel is then hammered onto a pole, which is then fastened upright in its other end in the ground. The criminal is then to be left dying "afloat" on the wheel, and be left to rot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Müller|first=J.|title=Der Aargau: Seine politische, Rechts-, Kultur- und Sitten-Geschichte. ¬Der alte Aarau, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9EdCAAAAcAAJ|year=1870|publisher=Schultheß|location=Zurich|pages=385–86|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dolle case; unclear case ====
On 1 October 1786 in the [[County of Tecklenburg]], Heinrich Dolle was to be executed by being broken on the wheel, on account of the aggravated murder of a Jew. The court had decided that Dolle should be broken ''von oben herab'': the first stroke of the wheel should crush his chest (traditionally thought to kill him instantly). The court instructed the executioner, Essmeyer, that Dolle should be clandestinely strangled (by [[garrotte]]) prior to the first stroke. The bystanders were shocked by what they thought was a severely botched execution by Essmeyer and his son, and thought Dolle had been alive during the entire proceeding, and also after Essmeyer had secured Dolle onto the wheel, and raised it on a pole. The town physician climbed up on a ladder (the Essmeyers had gone by then), and could ascertain that Dolle was indeed alive; he died six hours later.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

The Essmeyers were taken to court for severe malpractice. It was established that the string around Dolle's neck had not been drawn tightly enough, and that Essmeyer had, contrary to his duties as an executioner, accepted the use of a wheel that was not heavy enough. That lacking weight meant that the chest had not been crushed. Furthermore, one arm and one leg of Dolle's had not broken according to proper penal procedure. And finally, the nail that was customarily hammered through the convict's brain in order to fasten him upon the wheel had been hammered in far too low.{{cn|date=July 2017}}
Many believed that Essmeyer's act of malpractice had been not so much a display of gross incompetence as it had been a deliberate act of cruelty because Dolle, just prior to his execution, had converted from Catholicism to that of the Reformed Church (the executioner Essmeyer was a devout Catholic). The court did not find sufficient evidence for deliberate malice on Essmeyer's part, but sentenced him to two years' hard labour and banned him from ever working again as an executioner. His young son was, on grounds of mercy, acquitted of any culpable wrongdoings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klein|first=Ernst F.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=An1DAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA35|pages=35–41|title=Annalen der Gesetzgebung und Rechtsgelehrsamkeit in den preussischen Staaten, Volume 4|year=1796|location=Berlin, Stettin|publisher=Friedrich Nicolai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian Subcontinent===
A long struggle between the [[Sikh]] community and Islamic rulers resulted in [[Martyrdom in Sikhism|execution of Sikhs]]. In 1746, Bhai Subeg Singh and Bhai Shahbaz Singh were executed on rotating wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sikh-history.com/sikhhist/martyrs/shahbaz.html | publisher=www.sikh-history.com | accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.art-heritage.com/historical/historical-paintings/bhai-shahbaz-singh-ms-18.html | title=www.art-heritage.com | accessdate=11 June 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614073130/http://www.art-heritage.com/historical/historical-paintings/bhai-shahbaz-singh-ms-18.html# | archive-date=14 June 2016 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
In [[Scotland]], a servant named Robert Weir was broken on the wheel at [[Edinburgh]] in 1603 or 1604 (sources disagree). This punishment had been used infrequently there. The crime had been the murder of John [[Clan Kincaid|Kincaid]], Lord of [[Warriston]], on behalf of his wife, [[Jean Kincaid]].  Weir was secured to a cart wheel and was struck and broken with the [[Coulter (agriculture)|coulter]] of a [[plough]]. Lady Warriston was later beheaded.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Robert (1885).

===British and French colonial empires===
This method of execution was used in 18th-century North America following slave revolts. It was once used in New York after several British citizens were killed [[New York Slave Revolt of 1712|during a slave rebellion]] in 1712. Between 1730 and 1754, 11 slaves in French-controlled [[Louisiana]], who had revolted against their masters, were killed on the wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Habsburg Empire ===
At the end of the [[Revolt of Horea, Cloșca and Crișan]], in 1785 (in the Austrian [[Principality of Transylvania (1711–1867)]]), two of the revolt leaders, Horea and Cloșca, were sentenced to be executed by the breaking wheel. Crișan hanged himself in prison before that sentence could be carried out. According to a book published the same year by Adam F. Geisler, the two leaders were broken "von unten auf", from bottom up, meaning the lower limbs were broken before the upper limbs, prolonging the torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geisler|first=Adam F.|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VvVKAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA68|title=Horja und Klotska, Oberhaupt und Rathgeber der Aufrührer in Siebenbürgen.

===Russia===
The breaking wheel was frequently used in the [[Great Northern War]] in the early 1700s when the [[Tsardom of Russia]] challenged the supremacy of the [[Swedish Empire]] in northern [[Central Europe]] and [[Eastern Europe]].

===Sweden===
[[Image:Breaking Wheel.jpg|thumb|The execution of [[Peter Stumpp]], involving the breaking wheel in use in Cologne in the early modern period]]
[[Johann Patkul]] was a [[Livonian people|Livonian]] gentleman who was condemned on charges of treason by Swedish king [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] in 1707. The priest Lorentz Hagen was a friend of Patkul's and described the horrors his friend had to endure when Patkul was condemned to be broken on the wheel:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hagen|first=Lorentz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=27NbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA45|pages=45–46|title=Anecdotes Concerning the Famous John Reinhold Patkul: Or, an Authentic Relation of what Passed Betwixt Him and His Confessor, the Night Before and at His Execution.

{{quote|Here the executioner gave him the first stroke. His cries were terrible. "O Jesus! Jesus, have mercy upon me!" This cruel scene was much lengthened out, and of the utmost horror; for as the headsman had no skill in his business, the wretch under his hands received upwards of fifteen blows, with each of which were intermixed the most piteous groans, and invocations of the name of God. At length, after two strokes given on the breast, his strength and voice failed him. In a faltering dying tone, he was just heard to say, "Cut off my head!" and the executioner still lingering, he himself placed his head on the scaffold: in a word, after four strokes with an hatchet, the head was separated from the body, and the body quartered. Such was the end of the renowned Patkul: and may God have mercy on his soul!}}

===Later use===
The breaking wheel was used as a form of execution in Germany as recently as the early 19th century. Its use as a method of execution was not fully abolished in Bavaria until 1813, and still in use until 1836 in [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]]. In [[Prussia]], the punishment of death was inflicted by [[decapitation]] with a large sword, by burning, and by breaking on the wheel. At the time, the Prussian penal code required a criminal to be broken upon the wheel when a particularly heinous crime had been committed.  The king always issued an order to the executioner to strangle the criminal (which was done by a small cord not easily seen) before his limbs were broken.  The last execution by this stronger form of capital punishment, of [[Rudolf Kühnapfel]], was on 13 August 1841.&lt;ref&gt;Blazek, Matthias: „Letzte Hinrichtung durch Rädern im Königreich Preußen am 13. August 1841“ (In the Kingdom of Prussia a criminal was broken upon the wheel for the last time on  13 August 1841), in: Fachprosaforschung&amp;nbsp;– Grenzüberschreitungen. Deutscher Wissenschafts-Verlag (DWV), Baden-Baden, ed. 7, 2011, p. 339–343. {{cite book |title= A Law Dictionary and Glossary |last= Burrill |first= Alexander |authorlink= Alexander Burrill |edition= 2nd |volume= 2 |year= 1870 |publisher= Baker Voorheis and Co. |location= New York, NY |page= 620 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ztgUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA620&amp;lpg=PA620&amp;dq=prussia+1841+breaking+wheel#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |accessdate= 21 March 2010}} Rudolf Kühnapfel, [[assassin]] of Andreas Stanislaus von Hatten, the Bishop of [[Warmia]], was sentenced to be executed in this manner, though he was killed by [[strangulation]] before his corpse was broken on the wheel.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
[[Image:Hinrichtung durch Rädern, Skelett.jpg|right|thumb|Skeletal remains of a man executed by "breaking wheel", aged about 25 to 30 years, from the 16th to 18th century. Discovered in 2014, in the place of execution [[Pöls-Oberkurzheim]] ([[Styria]]), Austria. The skeleton is displayed at [[Riegersburg Castle]] in Austria]]
Since victims' bodies of the breaking wheel were often left exposed to environmental influences over a long period of time, so hardly any [[Feature (archaeology)|archaeological features]] for the "breaking wheel" exist; as a deterrence, the bodies were often left on public display over many years, exposed to wind and weather, birds and other scavenging animals could also take away the remains and bones. In the [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|German-speaking areas]], only one archaeological discovery of a breaking wheel victim has been documented so far: In autumn 2013, the skeleton of a man was found in [[Groß Pankow (Prignitz)|Groß Pankow]], Germany, the sensational find was discovered during the laying of Federal Highway 189 (''Bundesstraße 189'') between [[Perleberg]] and [[Pritzwalk]] in [[Brandenburg]], whose position and signs of injury indicate death by the "breaking wheel".&lt;ref name="FCS1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.focus.de/wissen/historischer-fund-in-gross-pankow-erstmals-das-skelett-eines-geraederter-mannes-gefunden_id_3838956.html|title=Historischer Fund in Groß Pankow: Sensation!

==Metaphorical uses==
The breaking wheel was also known as a great dishonor, and appeared in several expressions as such.  In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], there is the expression ''opgroeien voor galg en rad'', "to grow up for the gallows and wheel," meaning to be destined to come to no good. It is also mentioned in the Chilean expression ''morir en la rueda'', "to die on the wheel," meaning to keep silent about something. The Dutch expression ''ik ben geradbraakt'', literally "I have been broken on the wheel", is used to describe physical exhaustion and pain, like the [[German language|German]] expression ''sich gerädert fühlen'', "to feel wheeled," and the [[Danish language|Danish]] expression "radbrækket" refer almost exclusively to physical exhaustion and great discomfort.

In Finnish ''teilata'', "to execute by the wheel," refers to forceful and violent critique or rejection of performance, ideas or innovations. The German verb ''radebrechen'' ("to break on the wheel") can refer to speaking incorrectly, for example with a strong foreign accent or with a great deal of foreign vocabulary. Similarly, the [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''radbrekke'' can be applied to art and language, and refers to use which is seen as despoiling tradition and courtesy, with connotations of willful ignorance or malice. In [[Swedish language|Swedish]], ''rådbråka'' can be used in the same sense as the English idiom "[[:wikt:rack one's brain|rack one's brain]]" or, as in German, to mangle language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://g3.spraakdata.gu.se/saob/show.phtml?filenr=1/223/158.html Svenska Akademiens Ordbok: Rådbråka] (Swedish only) Retrieved 12 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word {{lang|fr|roué}}, meaning a debauched or lecherous person, is French, and its original meaning was "broken on the wheel." As execution by breaking on the wheel in France and some other countries was reserved for crimes of particular atrocity, ''roué'' came by a natural process to be understood to mean a man morally worse than a "gallows-bird," a criminal who only deserved hanging for common crimes. He was also a leader in wickedness, since the chief of a gang of brigands (for instance) would be broken on the wheel, while his obscure followers were merely hanged. [[Philip II, Duke of Orléans|Philip, Duke of Orléans]], who was regent of France from 1715 to 1723, gave the term the sense of impious and callous debauchee, which it has borne since his time, by habitually applying it to the very bad male company who amused his privacy and his leisure. The ''[[locus classicus]]'' for the origin of this use of the epithet is in the Memoirs of [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]].

Another french expression is "rouer de coups", which means giving a severe beating to someone.

In English, the quotation "[[Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?]]" from [[Alexander Pope]]'s "[[Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot]]" is occasionally seen, referring to putting great effort into achieving something minor or unimportant.

[[File:Waldburg-Gebetbuch 096.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Saint [[Catherine of Alexandria]] with a wheel as her attribute]]

Medieval hagiographies, such as the ''[[Golden Legend|Legenda sanctorum]]'', record that [[Catherine of Alexandria|St. Catherine of Alexandria]] was executed on one of these devices for refusing to renounce her Christian belief, which thereafter became known as the ''Catherine wheel'', also used as her [[saint symbolism|iconographic attribute]]. It is said the wheel miraculously broke when she touched it; she was then [[decapitation|beheaded]].&lt;ref name=clugnet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03445a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Catherine of Alexandria|work=newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an attribute it is usually shown broken in a small version beside her, or sometimes as a miniature she holds in her hand; the sword then used is also often shown.

'''Carin or Karin (Catharina) du Rietz''' (1766–1788) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] woman who became a soldier at the [[Högvakten|Royal guard]] in the guise of a man. She was the first woman in the Swedish royal guard. Her story was a well known and discussed event in her time, and later regarded to exemplify the vivacious [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustavian age]].

== Background ==
The daughter of [[lieutenant]] Carl du Rietz and Eva Cronhjelm, she was described as a woman with the stunning intelligence of an [[Amazons|Amazon]], with power and courage, temperament and beauty, and a "mind of fire". She grew up in a mansion in [[Småland]].

She ran away from home three times; the cause was thought to have been the strictness of her parents combined with the "reading of too many novels". The first time, she reached [[Stockholm]], where she was discovered and captured by her brothers; the second time she escaped to her doting grandparents on [[Värmdön]]. The third time, however, she dressed herself like a man and enlisted in the [[Högvakten|Royal regiment]] at court in Stockholm, as the first female ever.

== In the Royal Guard ==
During her time as a guard soldier, she preserved her male identity through her "female cunning", but as the story goes, she had so many troubles with sexual advances from both women and men that in the end she could see no other solution but to reveal her identity to the king himself before she was discovered in some other way. According to the legend, she stepped forward and fell down before the king one day when he passed a row of soldiers, of which she was one. She then revealed her identity to him.

When she did so, the king, [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]], was highly amused by her story. He allowed her to marry a librarian at the royal court, Erik Johan Paulin. They were both described as very happy about this. Paulin had a priest-education, and the king gave him the post of vicar in [[Kungsbacka]] parish. Carin was related to [[Charlotte Du Rietz]], to whom the monarch had a strong attachment.

De Rietz died in [[childbirth]] shortly after the family moved into their new home; her husband and child died soon after.

== Context and other examples ==
Du Rietz was far from the only example of women personating and living as men. The 18 May 1780 an incident was reported in the newspaper as a warning example; &lt;blockquote&gt;
''As a great benefit to the maids of the city, death newly discovered a terrible fraud, which, if it becomes an example, would alarm the fair sex, humiliate the clothing of males and make medical examinations necessary for both engagements and weddings.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
One of the coachmen of the city of [[Linköping]], Petter Cederlöf, had suddenly taken ill and died within ten hours. The woman taking care of the body then discovered that the man was in fact a woman. It was decided to make it public as a warning. Cederlöf had been hired the spring before after having shown all the necessary papers, amused himself with the maids, and finally proposed and engaged himself with a maid from the city. The fiancee was initially devastated over the death of her dear "Petter", but when she was told, it was reported that: ''All her tears have suddenly ceased.''

Many such stories are told, some of them quite famous; [[Gustafva Juliana Cederström]], (1746-1801) was widely known in the country for having served in several professions as a man, and on the opposite side, there was [[Lasse-Maja]], a man dressing himself as a woman.

[[File:Signal transduction pathways.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Overview of signal transduction pathways involved in [[apoptosis]].]]

'''Cell death''' is the event of a [[Cell (biology)|biological cell]] ceasing to carry out its functions. This may be the result of the natural process of old cells dying and being replaced by new ones, or may result from such factors as [[disease]], localized [[injury]], or the death of the organism of which the cells are part. Kinds of cell death include the following:

[[Programmed cell death]] (or PCD) is cell death mediated by an intracellular program.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |vauthors=Engelberg-Kulka H, Amitai S, Kolodkin-Gal I, Hazan R |year=2006 |title=Bacterial Programmed Cell Death and Multicellular Behavior in Bacteria |url=http://genetics.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020135 |journal=[[PLoS Genetics]] |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=e135 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020135 |pmid=17069462 |pmc=1626106}}

For example, the differentiation of fingers and toes in a developing human embryo occurs because cells between  the fingers [[Apoptosis|apoptose]]; the result is that the digits are separate. PCD serves fundamental functions during both plant and [[metazoa]] (multicellular animals) tissue development.

[[Apoptosis]] or Type I cell-death, and [[Autophagy (cellular)|autophagy]] or Type II cell-death are both forms of programmed cell death, while [[necrosis]] is a non-physiological process that occurs as a result of infection or injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kierszenbaum|first=Abraham|title=Histology and Cell Biology - An Introduction to Pathology|year=2012|publisher=ELSEVIER SAUNDERS|location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Necrosis]] is cell death caused by external factors such as trauma or infection, and occurs in several different forms. Recently a form of programmed necrosis, called [[necroptosis]], has been recognized as an alternative form of programmed cell death. It is hypothesized that necroptosis can serve as a cell-death backup to apoptosis when the apoptosis signaling is blocked by endogenous or exogenous factors such as viruses or mutations.

[[Mitotic catastrophe]] is a mode of cell death that is due to premature or inappropriate entry of cells into mitosis.  It is the most common mode of cell death in cancer cells exposed to [[ionizing radiation]] and many other anti-cancer treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ianzini|first1=Fiorenza|last2=Mackey|first2=Michael A|title=Mitotic Catastrophe in Apoptosis, Senescence, and Cancer|date=2007|publisher=Humana Press|isbn=978-1-58829-527-9|pages=73–91|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-59745-221-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autophagy is ''[[cytoplasm]]ic'', characterized by the formation of large [[vacuole]]s that eat away [[organelle]]s in a specific sequence prior to the destruction of the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |vauthors = Schwartz LM, Smith SW, Jones ME, Osborne BA |year = 1993 |title = Do all programmed cell deaths occur via apoptosis? |journal = [[PNAS]] |volume = 90 |issue = 3 |pages = 980–4 |pmid = 8430112 |pmc = 45794 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.90.3.980}};and, for a more recent view, see {{cite journal |doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2000.tb05594.x |vauthors = Bursch W, Ellinger A, Gerner C, Fröhwein U, Schulte-Hermann R |year = 2000 |title = Programmed cell death (PCD).

[[Apoptosis]] is the process of programmed cell death (PCD) that may occur in [[multicellular organisms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Douglas|title=Means To An End|year=2011|publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-87969-888-1 |url=http://celldeathbook.wordpress.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biochemical]] events lead to characteristic cell changes ([[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]) and death. These changes include [[Bleb (cell biology)|blebbing]], cell shrinkage, [[Cell nucleus|nuclear]] fragmentation, [[chromatin condensation]], and [[chromosome|chromosomal]] [[DNA]] fragmentation. It is now thought that – in a developmental context – cells are induced to positively commit suicide whilst in a homeostatic context; the absence of certain survival factors may provide the impetus for suicide. There appears to be some variation in the morphology and indeed the biochemistry of these suicide pathways; some treading the path of "apoptosis", others following a more generalized pathway to deletion, but both usually being genetically and synthetically motivated. There is some evidence that certain symptoms of "apoptosis" such as endonuclease activation can be spuriously induced without engaging a genetic cascade, however, presumably true apoptosis and programmed cell death must be genetically mediated. It is also becoming clear that mitosis and apoptosis are toggled or linked in some way and that the balance achieved depends on signals received from appropriate growth or survival factors.&lt;ref name="Apoptosis or programmed cell death?"&gt;{{cite book|last=D. Bowen|first=Ivor|title=Cell Biology International 17|year=1993|publisher=Portland Press|location=Great Britain|issn=1095-8355|doi=10.1006/cbir.1993.1075|pages=365–380|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1006/cbir.1993.1075/epdf|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Macroautophagy]], often referred to as [[autophagy]], is a [[catabolic]] process that results in the [[Autophagosome|autophagosomic]]-[[Lysosome|lysosomal]] degradation of bulk [[cytoplasm]]ic contents, abnormal protein aggregates, and excess or damaged [[organelle]]s. Autophagy is generally activated by conditions of [[nutrient]] deprivation but has also been associated with [[Physiology|physiolog]]ical as well as [[Pathology|patholog]]ical processes such as development, differentiation, [[neurodegenerative]] [[disease]]s, [[stress (physiology)|stress]], [[infection]] and [[cancer]].

Other pathways of programmed cell death have been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |vauthors = Kroemer G, Martin SJ |year = 2005 |title = Caspase-independent cell death |journal = [[Nature Medicine]] |volume = 11 |issue = 7 |pages = 725–30 |pmid = 16015365 |doi = 10.1038/nm1263}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Called "non-apoptotic programmed cell-death" (or "[[caspase]]-independent programmed cell-death" or "necroptosis"), these alternative routes to death are as efficient as apoptosis and can function as either backup mechanisms or the main type of PCD.

Plant cells undergo particular processes of PCD similar to autophagic cell death. However, some common features of PCD are highly conserved in both plants and metazoa.

[[Activation-induced cell death (AICD)]] is a programmed cell death caused by the interaction of Fas receptor (Fas, CD95)and Fas ligand (FasL, CD95 ligand).&lt;ref name="Zhang"&gt;Zhang J, Xu X, Liu Y. (2004), Activation-Induced Cell Death in T Cells and Autoimmunity. Cell Mol Immunol. 1(3):186-92&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs as a result of repeated stimulation of specific T-cell receptors (TCR) and it helps to maintain the periphery immune tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;Kabelitz D, Janssen O. (1997), Antigen-induced death of T-lymphocytes. Front Biosci. 2:d61-77&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, an alteration of the process may lead to autoimmune diseases.&lt;ref name="Zhang" /&gt; In the other words AICD is the negative regulator of activated T-lymphocytes.

[[Ischemic cell death]], or oncosis, is a form of accidental, or passive cell death that is often considered a lethal injury. The process is characterized by [[mitochondria]]l [[swelling (medical)|swelling]], [[cytoplasm]] [[vacuolization]], and swelling of the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and cytoplasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oncosis|url=http://www.copewithcytokines.de/cope.cgi?key=Oncosis|accessdate=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immunogenic cell death]] or immunogenic [[apoptosis]] is a form of cell death caused by some cytostatic agents such as [[anthracyclines]], oxaliplatin and bortezomib, or [[radiotherapy]] and [[photodynamic therapy]] (PDT).&lt;ref name="pmid19720113"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Garg AD, Nowis D, Golab J, Vandenabeele P, Krysko DV, Agostinis P| title=Immunogenic cell death, DAMPs and anticancer therapeutics: an emerging amalgamation. | journal=Biochim Biophys Acta | year= 2010 | volume= 1805 | issue= 1 | pages= 53–71 | pmid=19720113 | doi=10.1016/j.bbcan.2009.08.003 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=19720113  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death that occurs most frequently upon infection with intracellular pathogens and is likely to form part of the antimicrobial response in myeloid cells.

The term "cell necrobiology" has been used to describe the life processes associated with morphological, biochemical, and molecular changes which predispose, precede, and accompany cell death, as well as the consequences and tissue response to cell death. The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] νεκρό meaning "death", βìο meaning "life", and [[logos|λόγος]] meaning "the study of". The term was initially coined to broadly define investigations of the changes that accompany cell death,  detected and measured by multiparameter flow- and laser scanning- cytometry.&lt;ref&gt;Darzynkiewicz Z, Juan G, Li X, Gorczyca W, Murakami T, Traganos F. (1997) Cytometry in cell necrobiology: analysis of apoptosis and accidental cell death (necrosis). 1997;27(1):1-20. {{PMID|9000580}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used to describe the real-time changes during cell death, detected by flow cytometry &lt;ref&gt;Warnes G, Martins S.

The '''Centers for Spiritual Living''', or '''CSL''', is a religious denomination promoting [[Religious Science]] that was founded by [[Ernest Holmes]] in 1926. Before 2011, it was two organizations known as '''United Centers for Spiritual Living''' (formally, United Church of Religious Science) and '''International Centers for Spiritual Living''' (formally, Religious Science International).

== History ==
Holmes and his brother [[Fenwicke Holmes|Fenwicke]] learned about [[New Thought]] in Boston with Mary Baker Eddy, and later in Los Angeles were drawn to the belief in the power of the mind for healing and fulfillment of life. In 1926, Holmes's major work, ''[[The Science of Mind]]'', was published, and in 1927 he founded the Institute of Religious Science and Philosophy in Los Angeles to teach his principles. After a growing number of the Institute's graduates established churches on teachings by Holmes, it was reorganized in 1949 as the '''Church of Religious Science'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/497414/Religious-Science "Religious Science"], Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved May 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, P. (2010) ''American Veda: From Emerson and the Beatles to Yoga and Meditation How Indian Spirituality Changed the West. Random House Digital, Inc. p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s it split into two organizations that were originally called the '''United Church of Religious Science''' and '''Religious Science International'''.

=== Integration ===
The International Centers for Spiritual Living and United Centers for Spiritual Living reunited in 2011 after more than 50 years apart. After an eight-year process, the two organizations used a shared leadership model including nearly 400 volunteers. As of 2011, the organization has over 400 churches across North America.

In 2012 the newly merged Centers for Spiritual Living, elected Dr. Kenn Gordon as its first Spiritual Leader, having served in numerous capacities on the board of directors, including President of the former International Centers for Spiritual Living since 1999. In 2005 he was named Minister of the Year and received his Doctorate of Humanities.  Dr. Kenn, along with wife Dr. Deborah Gordon, pastors the Centre for Spiritual Living Kelowna.{{clear}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8226">A '''chemical oxygen generator''' is a device that releases [[oxygen]] via a [[chemical reaction]]. The oxygen source is usually an inorganic [[superoxide]],&lt;ref&gt; Hayyan M., Hashim M.A., AlNashef I.M., Superoxide Ion: Generation and Chemical Implications, Chem. Rev., 2016, 116 (5), pp 3029–3085. [[DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00407]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[chlorate]], or [[perchlorate]]; [[ozonide]]s are a promising group of oxygen sources.  The generators are usually ignited by a [[firing pin]], and the chemical reaction is usually [[exothermic]], making the generator a potential [[fire hazard]]. [[Potassium superoxide]] was used as an oxygen source on early manned  missions of the [[Soviet space program]], for [[firefighting|firefighters]], and for [[mine rescue]].

== In commercial airliners ==
[[File:Aircraft oxygen generator diagram.svg|thumb|350px|Diagram of a chemical oxygen generator system]]
[[File:Chemical Oxygen Generator, Cut-away View.gif|thumb|Chemical Oxygen Generator, Cut-away View]]

Commercial aircraft provide [[Emergency oxygen system|emergency oxygen]] to passengers to protect them from drops in cabin pressure. Chemical oxygen generators are not used for the cockpit crew, who are typically supplied using compressed oxygen canisters also known as oxygen bottles. In narrow body airliners, for each row of seats there are overhead [[oxygen mask]]s and oxygen generators. In some wide-body airliners, such as the [[DC-10]] and [[IL-96]], the canisters and oxygen masks are mounted in the top portion of the seat backs, since the ceiling is too high above the passengers. If a decompression occurs, the panels are opened either by an automatic pressure switch or by a manual switch, and the masks are released. When the passengers pull down on the mask they remove the retaining pins and trigger the production of oxygen.

The oxidizer core is [[sodium chlorate]] ([[Sodium|Na]][[Chlorine|Cl]][[Oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which is mixed with less than 5
percent [[barium peroxide]] ([[barium|Ba]][[Oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and less than 1 percent [[potassium perchlorate]] ([[potassium|K]][[chlorine|Cl]][[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The explosives in the percussion cap are a [[lead styphnate]] and [[tetrazene explosive]] mixture. The chemical reaction is exothermic and the exterior temperature of the canister will reach {{convert|260|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. It will produce oxygen for 12 to 22 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;

Accidental activation of improperly shipped expired generators caused the [[ValuJet Flight 592]] crash, killing all on board. An ATA DC-10, Flight 131, was also destroyed while parked at O'Hare Airport, on August 10, 1986. The cause was the accidental activation of an oxygen canister, contained in the back of a broken DC-10 seat, being shipped in the cargo compartment to a repair station. There were no fatalities or injuries because the plane contained no passengers when the fire broke out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airliners.net/photo/American-Trans-Air/McDonnell-Douglas-DC-10-40/0148751/L/&amp;sid=faf57dd90832c5c13834020fb2255dc2 Airliners.net, Photograph, Dave Campbell]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oxygen candle==
A ''chlorate candle'', or an ''oxygen candle'', is a cylindrical chemical oxygen generator that contains a mix of [[sodium chlorate]] and [[iron]] powder, which when ignited [[smoldering|smolders]] at about {{convert|600|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, producing [[sodium chloride]], [[iron oxide]], and at a fixed rate about 6.5 man-hours of oxygen per kilogram of the mixture. The mixture has an indefinite shelf life if stored properly: candles have been stored for 20 years without decreased oxygen output.  Thermal decomposition releases the oxygen.  The burning iron supplies the heat. The candle must be wrapped in thermal insulation to maintain the reaction temperature and to protect surrounding equipment.  The key reaction is:&lt;ref name=G&amp;E&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:2 NaClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  →  2 NaCl  +  3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

[[potassium chlorate|Potassium]] and [[lithium chlorate]], and [[sodium perchlorate|sodium]], [[potassium perchlorate|potassium]] and [[lithium perchlorate]]s can also be used in oxygen candles.

An explosion caused by one of these candles killed two Royal Navy sailors on {{HMS|Tireless|S88}}, a nuclear-powered submarine, under the Arctic on 21&amp;nbsp;March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=C. W.|title=Degraded Modes and the ‘Culture of Coping’ in Military Operations: An Analysis of a Fatal Incident on-board HMS Tireless on 20/21 March 2007|url=http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~johnson/papers/JWSSC2009/Degraded_Modes.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The candle had become contaminated with hydraulic oil, which caused the mixture to explode rather than burn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = 'Oxygen candle' caused explosion| url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/03/22/sub_blast_oxy_candle/ | publisher = The Register | last = Page | first = Lewis | date = 22 March 2007 | accessdate = 2013-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Vika oxygen generator]] used on some spacecraft, [[lithium perchlorate]] is the source of [[oxygen]]. At 400 °C, it releases 60% of its weight as [[oxygen]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lithium Perchlorate Oxygen Candle. Pyrochemical Source of Pure Oxygen|authors=M. M. Markowitz, D. A. Boryta, and Harvey Stewart, Jr.|journal=Ind. Eng. Chem. Prod. Res. Dev.|year=1964|volume=3|pages=321–330
|doi=10.1021/i360012a016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:LiClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  →  LiCl  +  2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

==Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generators==
{{Main|Oxygen concentrator}}
Advances in technology have provided industrial oxygen generator systems for use where air is available and a higher concentration of oxygen is desired. [[Pressure swing adsorption]] (PSA) incorporates a material called molecular sieve for gas separation. In the case of oxygen generation a zeolite-based sieve forces preferential adsorption for nitrogen. Clean, dry air is passed through the sieve beds on the oxygen generator, producing an oxygen-enriched gas.  [[Nitrogen separation membrane]] equipment is also used.

==Uses==
Chemical oxygen generators are used in [[aircraft]], breathing apparatus for [[firefighter]]s and mine rescue crews, [[submarine]]s, and everywhere a compact emergency oxygen generator with long shelf life is needed. They usually contain a device for absorption of [[carbon dioxide]], sometimes a filter filled with [[lithium hydroxide]]; a kilogram of LiOH absorbs about half a kilogram of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
*Self-contained oxygen generators (SCOGs) are used in submarines.
*[[Self-contained self-rescue device]]s (SCSRs) are used to facilitate escape from [[mining|mines]].
*On the [[International Space Station]], chemical oxygen generators are used as a backup supply. Each canister can produce enough oxygen for one crewmember for one day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barry|first=Patrick|title=Breathing Easy on the Space Station|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast13nov_1/|accessdate=9 September 2012|year=2000|publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4989">The '''Davies Commission Inquiry''' or '''Davies Commission Inquiry into the Death of Frank Paul''' (2007 - 2011) was an inquiry under Commissioner [[William H. Davies]] {{Post-nominals|QC}} a retired Justice of the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia]] (BCSC), [[Canada]]. The final report was submitted in May 2011.

The Inquiry focused on the 1998 death by hypothermia of Frank Paul, a homeless [[Mi'kmaq]] man originally from [[Elsipogtog First Nation]], {{IPAc-en|ɛ|l|z|ɪ|ˈ|b|ʊ|k|t|ʊ|k}} [[New Brunswick]].&lt;ref name="Davies_2009"/&gt;{{rp|ii}} According to the report, Paul died of hypothermia in an alley in east side Vancouver where he had been released by Vancouver police.&lt;ref name="cbc_davies_report"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/justice-system-failed-frank-paul-left-to-die-of-hypothermia-report-1.800186 |title=Justice system failed Frank Paul, left to die of hypothermia: report |newspaper=CBC News |date=March 12, 2009 |access-date=February 15, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theresa Allore''' was a 19-year-old Canadian college student who disappeared on Friday, November 3, 1978 from [[Champlain College Lennoxville]] in the Eastern Townships of Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/cold-case-public-inquiry-policing-1.3541598|title=Quebec cold cases: Families of 8 dead women call for public inquiry {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1978 Disappearance &amp; Discovery ==
'''Theresa Allore''' was a 19-year-old Canadian when she disappeared in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://numerique.banq.qc.ca/patrimoine/details/52327/2981588?docsearchtext=%22Theresa%20Allore%22|title=Allore Search Hits Dead End|last=Fudakowsky|first=Anna|date=November 16, 1978|work=Th Sherbrooke Record|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five months later, on April 13, 1979, her body was discovered in a small body of water approximately one kilometer from her dormitory residence in [[Compton, Quebec|Compton]], Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://numerique.banq.qc.ca/patrimoine/details/52327/2981698?docsearchtext=%22Theresa%20Allore%22|title=Dad Identifies Dead Co-Ed|last=|first=|date=April 17, 1979|work=The Sherbrooke Record|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon her disappearance police initially suggested she was a runaway. When her body was discovered police then suggested that she was the possible victim of a drug overdose, perhaps with the assistance of fellow college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://numerique.banq.qc.ca/patrimoine/details/52327/2970419?docsearchtext=%22Theresa%20Allore%22%20hamel|title=Family Seeks Closure in Daughter's Murder|last=McCully|first=Sharon|date=August 19, 2002|work=The Sherbrooke Record|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2002 Re-investigation ==
In the summer of 2002, the family of Theresa Allore enlisted the support of an investigative reporter and friend, [[Patricia Pearson]], who produced a series of articles for Canada's [[National Post]] newspaper that presented compelling evidence that Theresa Allore was a victim of murder, and that her death was possibly linked to two other unsolved local cases; the death of 10-year-old Manon Dube in March 1978, and the murder of Louise Camirand in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theresaallore.com/wkt-original-story/|title=Who Killed Theresa?|last=Pearson|first=Patricia|date=August 10, 2002|work=The National Post|accessdate=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was supported by geographic profiler and then FBI consultant, [[Kim Rossmo]], who suggested a serial sexual predator may have been operating in the Quebec region in the late 1970s and advised police to investigate the three deaths as a series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theresaallore.com/wkt-original-story/|title=Who Killed Theresa?|last=Pearson|first=Patricia|date=August 12, 2002|work=The National Post|access-date=August 12, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rossmo later gained notoriety when, in 1998, he suggested that Vancouver police create a serial killer task force to investigate the multiple cases of missing women from Vancouver's [[downtown Eastside]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Former+detective+Rossmo+testifies+bosses+nixed+serial+killer+warning/6044479/story.html|title=Former VPD detective Kim Rossmo testifies bosses nixed serial killer warning|last=Hall|first=Neal|date=January 24, 2012|work=The Vancouver Sun|access-date=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Pickton]] was eventually arrested and found guilty of six murders, though he was accused of, and implicated in, an additional 26 murders of Vancouver missing women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/former-profiler-expected-to-tell-pickton-inquiry-why-the-police-ignored-his-serial-killer-warning|title=Former profiler expected to tell Pickton inquiry why the police ignored his serial-killer warning|last=Fournier|first=Suzanne|date=January 24, 2012|work=The National Post|access-date=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deaths of Theresa Allore, Manon Dubé, and Louise Camirand remain unsolved cold-cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bayly|first1=Joanne|title=Quebec cold cases: Families of 8 dead women call for public inquiry|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/cold-case-public-inquiry-policing-1.3541598|website=CBC News|accessdate=12 March 2018|date=April 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Earth mysteries''' are a wide range of [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[Pseudoreligion|quasi-religious]] and [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] ideas focusing on cultural and religious beliefs about the [[Earth]], generally with regard to particular geographical locations of historical significance.&lt;ref name=hutton&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy|first=Ronald |last=Hutton |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=1993 |pages=118–9, 123, 125, 340|isbn=0631189467}}&lt;/ref&gt; Believers in Earth mysteries generally consider certain locations to be "sacred",  or  that certain spiritual "energies" may be active at those locations.&lt;ref name=ivakhiv&gt;{{cite book|title=Claiming Sacred Ground: Pilgrims and Politics at Glastonbury and Sedona |first=Adrian J. |last=Ivakhiv|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=22, 24, 32|year= 2001|isbn=0253338999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "[[alternative archaeology]]" has also been used to describe the study of Earth mystery beliefs.&lt;ref name=hutton/&gt;&lt;ref name=ivakhiv/&gt;

The study of [[ley line]]s originates in the 1920s with [[Alfred Watkins]]. The term "Earth mysteries" for this field of interest was coined about 1970 in ''The Ley Hunter'' journal,&lt;ref&gt;earlier use of the term "earth-mysteries" mostly refers to actual [[mystery religion|mysteries]] dedicated to [[chthonic]] deities in classical antiquity.&lt;/ref&gt; and the associated concepts have been embraced and reinvented by movements such as the [[New Age Movement]] and [[neopaganism|modern paganism]] during the 1970s to 1980s.&lt;ref name=hutton/&gt;

Some New Age believers engage in travel to locations they consider important according to their beliefs; for example, [[Stonehenge]] is a popular destination among New Age seekers.&lt;ref name=hetherington&gt;{{cite book|title=New Age Travellers: Vanloads of Uproarious Humanity |first=Kevin |last=Hetherington |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |pages=143|year=2000|isbn=0304339784}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Macdonald &gt;{{cite book|title=Theorizing Museums: Representing Identity and Diversity in a Changing World|first=Sharon |last=Macdonald|author2=Gordon Fyfe |publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=1996|isbn=0631201513|pages=156,164–6,171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of Earth mysteries can be traced back to two 17th-century [[antiquarians]]: [[John Aubrey]] and [[William Stukeley]], who both believed that [[Stonehenge]] was associated with the [[druids]]. Stukeley mixed together ancient [[monuments]] and [[mythology]] towards an "idealized vision" of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzmwsF-O3fIC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=%22John+Aubrey%22+earth+mysteries&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fxL0TcO2GI618QOhnNyPBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDwQuwUwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22John+Aubrey%22+earth+mysteries&amp;f=false|title=The Cultures of Celebrations|first1=Ray Broadus|last1=Browne|first2=Michael T.|last2=Marsden|date=31 December 1994|publisher=Popular Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ley lines" were postulated by  [[Alfred Watkins]] in 1921 at a presentation at the [[Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club]], later published in ''Early British Trackways'' (1922) and ''The Old Straight Track'' (1925). Watkins formed the ''Old Straight Track Club'' in 1927, which was active until 1935 but became defunct during the World War II period.{{Citation needed|reason=Mention of organization becoming defunct, but no date or source are provided|date=February 2017}}

A revival of interest in the topic began in the 1960s, now associated with [[neopagan]] currents like [[Wicca]], and with [[ufology]]. Watkins' Straight Track Club was revived in 1962 by [[Philip Heselton]] and others as the Ley Hunters' Club. The new club's journal ''The Ley Hunter'' was issued from 1965 to 1970, subtitled "the Magazine of Earth Mysteries".{{Citation needed|reason=Reference to a journal and its content, without sources or external links|date=February 2017}}

British writer John Ivimy wrote a book in 1975 called ''The Sphinx and the Megaliths'' in which he linked the Egyptian [[Sphinx]] to the British [[Stonehenge]] and other [[megalith|megalithic structures]] claiming they were all built by a group of "elite trained" people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ex3FSCaY_4C&amp;pg=PA548&amp;dq=John+Ivimy+megaliths&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SiH1TaCLO5C38QO8q5yzBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDUQuwUwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=John+Ivimy+megaliths&amp;f=false|title=New Scientist|first=Reed Business|last=Information|date=29 August 1974|publisher=Reed Business Information|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Age boom]] of the 1980s expanded the scope of the "Earth mysteries" field beyond the British landscape, and Earth mysteries as a "New Age invented tradition" by the 1990s could include the study of ancient sites and landscapes (including [[archaeology]], [[archaeoastronomy]], and [[ley lines]]), Chinese [[geomancy]] or [[feng shui]], western magical concepts of [[gematria]], and [[dowsing]].&lt;ref name=macdonald&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.anthrosource.net/Abstract.aspx?issn=1053-4202&amp;volume=6&amp;issue=4&amp;doubleissueno=0&amp;article=237261&amp;suppno=0&amp;jstor=False| journal=Anthropology of Consciousness |volume= 6| issue = 4. |date=December 1995 |pages=31–45|title=Inventing Traditions for the New Age: A Case Study of the Earth Energy Tradition |author=JEFFERY L. MACDONALD|doi=10.1525/ac.1995.6.4.31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An important writer combining these fields during the 1970s to 2000s was [[John Michell (writer)|John Michell]]. Michell's book ''The View Over Atlantis'' mixed [[ley lines]] with [[folklore]] and [[archeology]]; these ideas became popularised as "earth mysteries".&lt;ref&gt;Danny Sullivan, Ley Lines: The Greatest Landscape Mystery, Publisher Green Magic, 2005, p. 11 {{ISBN|0954296346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other 1980s authors on the subject of Earth mysteries include [[Paul Devereux]] and [[Nigel Pennick]].&lt;ref&gt;Caitlin Matthews, John Matthews, Walkers Between the Worlds: The Western Mysteries from Shaman to Magus, Publisher: Inner Traditions, 2004, p. 55 {{ISBN|9780892810918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related ideas include the "[[landscape archaeology]]" advocated by German author Kurt Derungs from about 1990, and the wider field of "[[Forteana]]", a term taken to include [[paranormal]] phenomena more generally.{{Citation needed|reason=Assertion of connection to [[Forteana]], which makes no references to either archaelogy or paranormal locations. |date=February 2017}}

==Reception==

Proponents consider the Earth mysteries to be "[[sacred]]" and "[[Mythopoeic thought|mythopoeic]]" rather than scientific.&lt;ref name=ivakhiv/&gt; The ley lines idea has been generally ignored by the academic establishment in the field of archaeology.&lt;ref name=ivakhiv/&gt; The work of researchers who support the paranormal aspects of Earth mysteries have been extensively criticized by "professional debunkers" such as [[James Randi]], [[Martin Gardner]], and the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal ([[CSICOP]]).&lt;ref name=ivakhiv/&gt;

The Earth mysteries movement in Great Britain embraced the term "ritual landscapes" that was used in British archaeology starting in the 1980s, with regards to "sacred" locations apparently used for mainly ceremonial purposes in the [[Neolithic British Isles|Neolithic]] and the early [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]]; the concept has been both adopted and criticized in the field of academic archaeology.&lt;ref name= Robb&gt;{{cite journal|title=The 'ritual landscape' concept in archaeology: a heritage construction| url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a769326307~db=all |author=John G.

'''Steven Paul''' "'''Elliott'''" '''Smith''' (August 6, 1969&amp;nbsp;– October 21, 2003) was an American [[singer]], [[songwriter]], and [[multi-instrumentalist]]. Smith was born in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], raised primarily in [[Texas]], and lived much of his life in [[Portland, Oregon]], where he first gained popularity. Smith's primary instrument was the guitar, though he was also proficient with piano, [[clarinet]], bass guitar, drums, and [[harmonica]]. Smith had a distinctive vocal style, characterized by his "whispery, spiderweb-thin delivery",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/elliott-smith-mw0000177957 |title=''Elliott Smith'' – Elliott Smith : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |last=Huey |first=Steve |website=[[AllMusic]] | publisher=[[AllRovi]] | accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used [[Multitrack recording|multi-tracking]] to create vocal layers, textures, and [[harmony|harmonies]].

After playing in the rock band [[Heatmiser]] for several years, Smith began his solo career in 1994, with releases on the independent record labels [[Cavity Search Records|Cavity Search]] and [[Kill Rock Stars]] (KRS). In 1997, he signed a contract with [[DreamWorks Records]], for which he recorded two albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7267-figure-8/ |title=Elliott Smith: ''Figure 8'' |last=Schreiber |first=Ryan |date=March 31, 2000 |website=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] | accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith rose to mainstream prominence when his song "[[Miss Misery (song)|Miss Misery]]"—included in the soundtrack for the film ''[[Good Will Hunting]] ''(1997)—was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] category in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bitcandy.com/plogs/plogDedicated/music/todays-candy-elliott-smith-miss-misery |title=Elliott Smith – Miss Misery |last=Grant |first=Jess |date=November 9, 2011 |website=BitCandy |accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith had trouble with alcohol and other drugs throughout his life, while suffering from [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], and these topics often appear in his lyrics. In 2003, aged 34, he died in [[Los Angeles, California]], from two stab wounds to the chest.&lt;ref name="autopsy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/rockers-autopsy-doesnt-rule-out-homicide |title=Rocker's Autopsy Doesn't Rule Out Homicide |date=January 8, 2004 |website=The Smoking Gun |accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The autopsy evidence was inconclusive as to whether the wounds were [[suicide|self-inflicted]] or the result of [[homicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/smith-autopsy-inconclusive-20031231 |title=Smith Autopsy Inconclusive  |last=Dansby |first=Andrew |date=December 31, 2003 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] | accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, Smith was working on his sixth studio album, ''[[From a Basement on the Hill]]'', which was posthumously completed and released in 2004.

== Early life ==
Steven Paul Smith was born at the Clarkson Hospital in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], the only child of Gary Smith, a student at the [[University of Nebraska Medical Center]], and Bunny Kay Berryman, an elementary school music teacher. His parents divorced when he was six months old, and Smith moved with his mother to [[Duncanville, Texas]]. Smith later had a tattoo of a map of Texas drawn on his upper arm and said: "I didn't get it because I like Texas, kind of the opposite. But I won't forget about it, although I'm tempted to because I don't like it there."&lt;ref name="Shutt page 6"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sweetadeline.net/bio6.html |title=Elliott Smith: Biography – Page 6 |last=Shutt |first=S. R. |website=Sweet Adeline |accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith endured a difficult childhood&lt;ref name="Gowing"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Gowing |first=Liam |date=December 2004 |title=Mr. Misery |magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |volume=20 |issue=12 |pages=80–92 |url=https://www.spin.com/2013/10/elliott-smith-mr-misery-10-year-anniversary-death/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222181447/https://www.spin.com/2013/10/elliott-smith-mr-misery-10-year-anniversary-death/ |archivedate=December 22, 2013 |accessdate=April 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a troubled relationship with his stepfather Charlie Welch.&lt;ref name="Shutt page 3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sweetadeline.net/bio3.html |title=Elliott Smith: Biography – Page 3 |last=Shutt |first=S. R. |website=Sweet Adeline |accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith stated he may have been [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] by Welch at a young age, an allegation which Welch has denied.&lt;ref name="Gowing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Carpenter"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.spin.com/2009/10/why-i-cant-listen-to-elliott-smiths-music/ |title='Why I Can't Listen to Elliott Smith's Music' |last=Carpenter |first=Ellen |date=October 21, 2009 |magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] | accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote about this part of his life in "Some Song". The name "Charlie" also appears in songs "Flowers for Charlie" and "No Confidence Man." In a 2004 interview, Jennifer Chiba, Smith's partner at the time of his death, said that Smith's difficult childhood was partly why he needed to sedate himself with drugs as an adult: "He was remembering traumatic things from his childhood – parts of things. It's not my place to say what."&lt;ref name="Gowing" /&gt;

For much of his childhood, Smith's family was a part of the [[Community of Christ]]{{sfn|Nugent|2004|pp=12–14}} but began attending services at a local [[Methodism|Methodist]] Church. Smith felt that going to church did little for him, except make him "really scared of Hell".{{sfn|Nugent|2004|pages=12–14}} In 2001, he said: "I don't necessarily buy into any officially structured version of spirituality. But I have my own version of it."&lt;ref name="Shutt page 2" /&gt;

Smith began playing piano at age nine, and at ten began learning guitar on a small [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]] bought for him by his father.&lt;ref name="Under the Radar 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://undertheradarmag.com/issue4/elliottsmith.html |title=UTR – Issue 4 |last=Kagler |first=Marcus |year=2003 |website=[[Under the Radar (magazine)|Under the Radar]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615125926/http://undertheradarmag.com/issue4/elliottsmith.html |archivedate=June 15, 2006 |accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this age he composed an original piano piece, "Fantasy", which won him a prize at an [[arts festival]].&lt;ref name="Shutt page 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sweetadeline.net/bio2.html |title=Elliott Smith: Biography – Page 2 |last=Shutt |first=S. R. |website=Sweet Adeline |accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the people on his mother's side of the family were non-professional musicians; his grandfather was a [[Dixieland]] drummer, and his grandmother sang in a [[glee club]].&lt;ref name="Shutt page 2" /&gt;

[[File:Lincoln High School - Portland Oregon.jpg|alt=A side view of Lincoln High School—a brick, two-story building with an American flag|thumb|Smith graduated from Lincoln High School in Portland, Oregon.]]

At fourteen, Smith left his mother's home in Texas and moved to [[Portland, Oregon]], to live with his father, who was then working as a psychiatrist. It was around this time that Smith began using drugs, including alcohol, with friends. He also began experimenting with [[sound recording|recording]] for the first time after borrowing a [[Multitrack recording|four-track recorder]].&lt;ref name="Shutt page 2" /&gt; At high school, Smith played clarinet in the school band and played guitar and piano; he also sang in the bands Stranger Than Fiction&lt;ref name="Shutt page 3" /&gt; and A Murder of Crows,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sweetadeline.net/amurderof.html |title=Elliott Smith: A murder of crows |website=Sweet Adeline |accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; billed as either Steven Smith or "Johnny Panic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pushby.com/forrest/arc/005521.html |title=Recorded Music: Elliott Smith, 1969–2003 |date=October 23, 2003 |website=pushby.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118211329/http://www.pushby.com/forrest/arc/005521.html |archivedate=November 18, 2006 |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Lincoln High School (Portland, Oregon)|Lincoln High School]] as a [[National Merit Scholarship Program|National Merit Scholar]].&lt;ref name="Shutt page 4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sweetadeline.net/bio4.html |title=Elliott Smith: Biography – Page 4 |last=Shutt |first=S. R. |website=Sweet Adeline |accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation, Smith began calling himself "Elliott", saying that he thought "Steve" sounded too much like a "[[jock (subculture)|jock]]" name, and that "Steven" sounded "too bookish".&lt;ref name="Shutt page 4" /&gt; According to friends, he had also used the pseudonym "Elliott Stillwater-Rotter" during his time in the band A Murder of Crows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/oct/24/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries |title=Elliott Smith: Gentle singer with a delicate message of brutality and despair |last=Peschek |first=David |date=October 24, 2003  | accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer S. R. Shutt speculates that the name was either inspired by Elliott Avenue, a street that Smith had lived on in Portland, or that it was suggested by his then-girlfriend. A junior high acquaintance of Smith speculates Smith changed his name so as not to be confused with [[Steve Smith (musician)|Steve Smith]], the drummer of [[Journey (band)|Journey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beingtheremag.com/content/0502/smith.html |title=Being There |last=Pittman |first=Mark |year=2004 |website=Being There |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050217100436/http://www.beingtheremag.com/content/0502/smith.html |archivedate=February 17, 2005 |accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== 1991–96: Heatmiser ===
{{main|Heatmiser}}

Smith graduated from [[Hampshire College]] in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]] in 1991 with a [[academic degree|degree]] in philosophy and political science. "Went straight through in four years", he explained to ''Under the Radar'' in 2003. "I guess it proved to myself that I could do something I really didn't want to for four years. Except I did like what I was studying. At the time it seemed like, 'This is your one and only chance to go to college and you had just better do it because some day you might wish that you did.' Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day."&lt;ref name="Under the Radar 2" /&gt; After he graduated, he "worked in a bakery back in Portland with a [[Bachelor of Arts|bachelor's degree]] in philosophy and [[legal theory]]".&lt;ref name="Under the Radar 2" /&gt;

While at Hampshire, Smith formed the band [[Heatmiser]] with classmate [[Neil Gust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sweetadeline.net/bio5.html |title=Elliott Smith: Biography – Page 5 |last=Shutt |first=S. R. |website=Sweet Adeline |accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Smith graduated from Hampshire, the band added drummer [[Tony Lash]] and bassist [[Brandt Peterson]] and began performing around Portland in 1992.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=byhMHIYrkSkC&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Torment Saint: The Life of Elliott Smith - William Todd Schultz - Google Libri|date=2018-01-24|access-date=2018-01-24|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124174401/https://books.google.com/books?id=byhMHIYrkSkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|archivedate=2018-01-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group released the albums ''[[Dead Air (Heatmiser album)|Dead Air]]'' (1993) and ''[[Cop and Speeder]]'' (1994) as well as the ''[[Yellow No. 5 (Heatmiser E.P.)|Yellow No. 5]]'' EP (1994) on [[Frontier Records]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They were then signed to [[Virgin Records]] to release what became their final album, ''[[Mic City Sons]]'' (1996).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.treblezine.com/32195-heatmiser-mic-city-sons-bridge-elliott-smith-solo/|title=Heatmiser’s ‘Mic City Sons’ built a bridge to Elliott Smith’s solo albums|date=2018-01-24|access-date=2018-01-24|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124174840/http://www.treblezine.com/32195-heatmiser-mic-city-sons-bridge-elliott-smith-solo/|archivedate=2018-01-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time, Smith and Gust worked a number of odd jobs around Portland, including installing [[drywall]], spreading gravel, transplanting bamboo trees, and painting the roof of a warehouse with heat reflective paint. The pair were also on unemployment benefits for some time, which they considered an "artist grant".&lt;ref name="Under the Radar 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://undertheradarmag.com/es.html |title=Elliott Smith – Better Off Than Dead, Elliott Smith Comes Clean |last=Kagler |first=Marcus |date=June 2003 |website=[[Under the Radar (magazine)|Under the Radar]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031105005159/http://www.undertheradarmag.com/es.html |archivedate=November 5, 2003 |accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith had begun his solo career while still in Heatmiser, and the success of his first two releases created distance and tension with his band.&lt;ref name="Under the Radar 1" /&gt; Heatmiser disbanded prior to the release of ''Mic City Sons'', prompting Virgin to put the album out inauspiciously through its independent arm, [[Caroline Records]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A clause in Heatmiser's [[record contract]] with Virgin meant that Smith was still bound to it as an individual. The contract was later bought out by DreamWorks prior to the recording of his fourth album, ''[[XO (Elliott Smith album)|XO]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/article/9246-keep-the-things-you-forgot-an-elliott-smith-oral-history/|title=Keep the Things You Forgot: An Elliott Smith Oral History {{!}} Pitchfork|date=2018-01-24|access-date=2018-01-24|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124191042/https://pitchfork.com/features/article/9246-keep-the-things-you-forgot-an-elliott-smith-oral-history/|archivedate=2018-01-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1994: ''Roman Candle'' ===

| format = [[Ogg]]
}}

His first release, ''[[Roman Candle (album)|Roman Candle]]'' (1994), came about when Smith's girlfriend at the time convinced him to send a tape of "the most recent eight songs that [he'd] recorded on borrowed [[Multitrack recording|four-tracks]] and borrowed guitar" to [[Cavity Search Records]].&lt;ref name="Under the Radar 1" /&gt; Owner Christopher Cooper immediately requested to release the entire album of songs, which surprised Smith, as he was expecting only a deal for a [[Seven-inch|seven-inch record]].&lt;ref name="Shutt page 6" /&gt;

Regarding the record, Smith said: "I thought my head would be chopped off immediately when it came out because at the time it was so opposite to the [[grunge]] thing that was popular&amp;nbsp;... The thing is that album was really well received, which was a total shock, and it immediately eclipsed [Heatmiser], unfortunately."&lt;ref name="Under the Radar 1" /&gt; Smith felt his solo songs were not representative of the music Heatmiser was making: "The idea of playing [my music] for people didn't occur to me... because at the time it was the [[American Northwest|Northwest]]—[[Mudhoney]] and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]—and going out to play an acoustic show was like crawling out on a limb and begging for it to be sawed off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fritch |first=Matthew |date=September 1998 |title=Down on the Upside |magazine=[[Magnet (magazine)|Magnet]] | issue=46 |url=http://www.sweetadeline.net/down.html |accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Smith's first solo performances was at the now-defunct Umbra Penumbra on September 17, 1994. Only three songs from ''Roman Candle'' were performed, with the majority of the ten-song set being [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]], Heatmiser tunes and unreleased tracks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/elliott-smith/1994/umbra-penumbra-portland-or-73d58661.html Elliott Smith Setlist at Umbra Penumbra, Portland]&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after this performance, Smith was asked to open for [[Mary Lou Lord]] on a week-long U.S. tour. She later recorded one of his songs, "I Figured You Out", which he had discarded for sounding "too much like the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]".

The same year, Smith released a split 7" record with Pete Krebs, contributing the track "[[No Confidence Man]]" as the single's B-side.

=== 1995–97: ''Elliott Smith'' and ''Either/Or'' ===

}}

In 1995, Smith's [[Elliott Smith (album)|self-titled album]] was released on [[Kill Rock Stars]]; the record featured a style of recording similar to ''Roman Candle'', but with hints of growth and experimentation.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Though the majority of the album was recorded by Smith alone, friend and [[The Spinanes]] vocalist Rebecca Gates sang harmony vocals on "St. Ides Heaven", and Heatmiser guitarist [[Neil Gust]] played guitar on "Single File". Several songs made reference to drugs, but Smith explained that he used the theme of drugs as a vehicle for conveying dependence rather than the songs being about drugs specifically.&lt;ref name="Shutt page 7"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sweetadeline.net/bio7.html |title=Elliott Smith: Biography – Page 7 |last=Shutt |first=S.

In 1996, filmmaker [[Jem Cohen]] recorded Smith playing acoustic songs for the short film ''[[Lucky Three]]: An Elliott Smith Portrait''.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Two of these songs would appear on his next album, ''[[Either/Or (album)|Either/Or]]'', which was another Kill Rock Stars release. ''Either/Or'' came out in 1997 to favorable reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/Current/A1020.htm |title=Acclaimed Music – ''Either/Or'' |website=[[Acclaimed Music]] |accessdate=April 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602024700/http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/Current/A1020.htm |archivedate=June 2, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album found Smith venturing further into full instrumentation, with several songs containing [[bass guitar]], [[drum kit|drums]], [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]], and electric guitars, all played by Smith. The album title was derived from the two-volume [[Either/Or|book of the same name]] by [[Denmark|Danish]] philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], whose works generally deal with themes such as [[existential despair]], [[angst]], death, and [[God]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

By this time, Smith's already-heavy drinking was being compounded with use of [[antidepressant]]s.&lt;ref name="D'Angelo, Perez"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/s/smith_elliott/news_feature_102903/ |title=mtvnews.com: Elliott Smith: |last1=D'Angelo |first1=Joe |last2=Perez |first2=Rodrigo |website=[[MTV News]] |accessdate=April 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126125518/http://www.mtv.com/bands/s/smith_elliott/news_feature_102903/ |archivedate=November 26, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the ''Either/Or'' tour, some of his close friends staged an [[intervention (counseling)|intervention]] in [[Chicago]],&lt;ref name="D'Angelo, Perez" /&gt; but it proved ineffective.&lt;ref name="Gowing" /&gt; Shortly after, Smith relocated from Portland to [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name="Kelley"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2003-10-30/music/xo-elliott/ |title=XO, Elliott – Page 1 – Music – Phoenix |last=Kelley |first=Brendan Joel |date=October 30, 2003 |website=[[Phoenix New Times]] | accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1997–98: "Miss Misery" and the Oscars ===

In 1997, Smith was selected by director and fellow Portland resident [[Gus Van Sant]] to be a part of the soundtrack to his film, ''[[Good Will Hunting]]''. Smith recorded an orchestral version of "Between the Bars" with composer [[Danny Elfman]] for the movie. Smith also contributed a new song, "Miss Misery", and three previously released tracks ("No Name #3", from ''[[Roman Candle (album)|Roman Candle]]'', and "Angeles" and "Say Yes", from ''[[Either/Or (album)|Either/Or]]''). The film was a commercial and critical success, and Smith was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for "Miss Misery". Not eager to step into the limelight, he agreed to perform the song at the ceremony only after the producers informed him that if he was unwilling to perform, they would choose someone else to play it.&lt;ref name="Under the Radar 1" /&gt;{{failed verification|reason=nothing in parentheses is mentioned at all|date=September 2018}}

On March 5, 1998, Smith made his [[network television]] debut on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' performing "[[Miss Misery]]" solo on acoustic guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbc.com/Late_Night_with_Conan_O%27Brien/episode_guide/160.shtml |title=''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'' &gt; Episode Guide |website=[[NBC]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013051724/http://www.nbc.com/Late_Night_with_Conan_O%27Brien/episode_guide/160.shtml |archivedate=October 13, 2007 |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, wearing a white suit, he played an abridged version of the song at the Oscars, accompanied by the house [[orchestra]]. [[James Horner]] and [[Will Jennings]] won the award that night for best song with "[[My Heart Will Go On]]" (sung by [[Celine Dion]]) from the film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''. Smith did not voice disappointment about not winning the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/Issues/2000-10-12/music/music.html |title=Back to Earth – Page 1 – Music – Phoenix |last=Garcia |first=Gilberta |date=October 12, 2000 |website=[[Phoenix New Times]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210183646/http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/Issues/2000-10-12/music/music.html |archivedate=December 10, 2008 |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith commented on the [[surrealism]] of the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] experience: "That's exactly what it was, surreal... I enjoy performing almost as much as I enjoy making up songs in the first place. But the Oscars was a very strange show, where the set was only one song cut down to less than two minutes, and the audience was a lot of people who didn't come to hear me play. I wouldn't want to live in that world, but it was fun to walk around on the moon for a day."&lt;ref name="Anderman"&gt;{{cite news |last=Anderman |first=Joan |date=March 26, 1999 |title=Tunesmith to the Miserable but Don't Mistake His Characters for Him, Says Elliott Smith |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1998–2000: ''XO'' and ''Figure 8'' ===

In 1998, after the success of ''[[Either/Or (album)|Either/Or]]'' and "Miss Misery", Smith signed to a bigger record label, [[DreamWorks Records]]. Around the same time, Smith fell into [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], speaking openly of considering suicide,&lt;ref name="D'Angelo, Perez" /&gt; and on at least one occasion&lt;ref name="Gowing" /&gt; made a serious attempt at ending his own life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inkblotmagazine.com/We_Love_Elliott_Smith.htm |title=Why We Love Elliott Smith |last=Scherl |first=Alexis |website=Ink Blot Magazine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519201027/http://www.inkblotmagazine.com/We_Love_Elliott_Smith.htm |archivedate=May 19, 2008 |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in [[North Carolina]], he became severely intoxicated and ran off a cliff. He landed on a tree, which badly impaled him but broke his fall.&lt;ref name="Gowing" /&gt; When questioned about his suicide attempt, he told an interviewer, "Yeah, I jumped off a cliff, but let's talk about something else."&lt;ref name="Kelley" /&gt;

Christopher Cooper, head of Cavity Search Records (which released ''Roman Candle''), said about this time in Smith's life, "I talked him out of thinking that he wanted to kill himself numerous times when he was in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]. I kept telling him that he was a brilliant man, and that life was worth living, and that people loved him."&lt;ref name="D'Angelo, Perez" /&gt; Pete Krebs also agreed: "In Portland we got the brunt of Elliott's initial depression... Lots of people have stories of their own experiences of staying up with Elliott 'til five in the morning, holding his hand, telling him not to kill himself."&lt;ref name="Kelley" /&gt;

Smith's first release for DreamWorks was later that year. Titled ''[[XO (Elliott Smith album)|XO]]'', it was conceived and developed while Smith wrote it out over the winter of 1997/1998, night after night seated at the bar in [[Luna Lounge]]. It was produced by the team of [[Rob Schnapf]] and [[Tom Rothrock]]. ''XO'' also contained some instrumentation from Los Angeles musicians [[Joey Waronker]] and [[Jon Brion]]. It contained a more full-sounding, [[baroque pop]] sound than any of his previous efforts, with songs featuring a horn section, [[Chamberlin (music)|Chamberlins]], elaborate [[string instrument|string]] [[arrangement]]s, and even a [[Music loop|drum loop]] on the song "Independence Day". His familiar double-tracked vocal and acoustic guitar style were still apparent while his somewhat personal lyrical style survived. The album went on to peak at number 104 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]&lt;ref name="Billboard charts"&gt;{{cite magazine |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=elliott smith|chart=all}} |title=Elliott Smith – Chart History |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and number 123 on the [[UK Album Charts]],&lt;ref name="zobbel.de"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_S.HTM |title=Chart Log UK: DJ S – The System of Life |website=zobbel.de |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while selling 400,000 copies&lt;ref name="Petridis"&gt;{{cite news |last=Petridis |first=Alexis |date=March 19, 2004 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/mar/19/popandrock.elliottsmith |title=The Mysterious Death of Elliott Smith |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (more than double that of each of his two Kill Rock Stars releases), becoming the best-selling release of his career.{{sfn|Nugent|2004|p=201}} Smith's backing band during most of this period was the Portland-based group [[Quasi]], consisting of former bandmate [[Sam Coomes]] on bass guitar and Coomes's ex-wife [[Janet Weiss]] on drums. Quasi also performed as the opening act at many shows on the tour, with Smith sometimes contributing bass guitar, guitar, or backing vocals. [[List of Saturday Night Live hosts and musical guests#Season 24|On October 17, 1998]], Smith appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and performed "Waltz #2 (XO)". His backing band for this appearance was [[John Moen]], [[Jon Brion]], [[Rob Schnapf]], and [[Sam Coomes]].

In response to whether the change to a bigger record label would influence his creative control, Smith said, "I think despite the fact that sometimes people look at major labels as simply money-making machines, they're actually composed of individuals who are real people, and there's a part of them that needs to feel that part of their job is to put out good music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/elliottsmith/articles/story/5924200/smith_comes_up_roses |title=Smith Comes Up Roses: Elliott Smith |last=Dansby |first=Andrew |date=April 22, 2000 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001021013/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/elliottsmith/articles/story/5924200/smith_comes_up_roses |archivedate=October 1, 2007 |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith also claimed in another interview that he never read his reviews for fear that they would interfere with his songwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Entertainment – Elliott Smith Keeps Moving – May 17, 2000 |last=Allen |first=Jamie |website=[[CNN]].com |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/SHOWBIZ/Music/05/17/elliott.smith/ |accessdate=June 24, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601213317/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/SHOWBIZ/Music/05/17/elliott.smith/ |archivedate=June 1, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this period that Smith appeared on Dutch television in 1998 and provided a candid interview in which he spoke of his assessment of his music career until that point:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I mostly only know things are different because people ask me different questions, but I don't feel like things are very changed. I mean, I still, I do the same things that I did before … I think about the same things, so … I'm the wrong kind of person to be really big and famous.&lt;ref name="Dutch TV"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5yjQX-8iuI |title=Elliott Smith Live, 29 November 1998: Full 2 Meter Session (high res VCR capture) |date=July 2, 2013 |website=[[YouTube]] | accessdate=January 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As part of the Dutch television special, Smith played live versions of "Waltz #2 (XO)", "Miss Misery", and "I Didn't Understand"—the latter two songs were performed solely on piano, while the first song was cut short by Smith, as he explained: "I had to stop it because it's… you know, what's the point of playing a song badly? It'd be better to play it and mean it, than to just walk through it."&lt;ref name="Dutch TV" /&gt;

Smith relocated from Brooklyn to Los Angeles in 1999,&lt;ref name="Kelley" /&gt; taking up residence at a cabin in the [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]] section of town, where he would regularly play intimate, acoustic shows at local venues like [[Silverlake Lounge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=December 2003 |title=The Long Slow Death of Elliott Smith |magazine=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wideanglesounds.bigcartel.com/product/elliott-smith-at-silverlake-lounge-99|title=Elliott Smith at Silverlake Lounge '99 / Wide Angle Sounds|last=Sounds|first=Wide Angle|website=wideanglesounds.bigcartel.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also performed in Toronto in April that year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000204220616/http://chartattack.com:80/road/reviews/1999/19990412-elliottsmith.html "Live Reviews: Elliott Smith April 1, 1999 The Opera House, Toronto, ON"].

The final album Smith completed in his lifetime, ''[[Figure 8 (album)|Figure 8]]'', was released on April 18, 2000. It featured the return of Rothrock, Schnapf, Brion, and Waronker and was partially recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in England, with an obvious Beatles influence in the songwriting and production. The album garnered very favorable reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/figure-8/elliott-smith |title=''Figure 8'' Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; peaking at number 99 on the ''Billboard'' 200&lt;ref name="Billboard charts" /&gt; and 37 on the UK Album Charts.&lt;ref name="zobbel.de" /&gt; The album received praise for its [[power pop]] style and complex arrangements, described as creating a "sweeping kaleidoscope of layered instruments and sonic textures".&lt;ref name="AllMusic Figure 8"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/figure-8-mw0000604250 |title=''Figure 8'' – Elliott Smith : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |last=Huey |first=Steve |website=[[AllMusic]] | publisher=[[AllRovi]] | accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some reviewers felt that Smith's trademark dark and [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]] songwriting had lost some of its subtlety, with one reviewer likening some of the lyrics to "the self-pitying complaints of an adolescent venting in his diary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/music/pop/reviews/2847/ |title=Möbius Smith |last=Smith |first=Ethan |date=April 24, 2000 |website=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] | accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Album art and promotional pictures from the period showed Smith looking cleaned-up and put-together. An extensive tour in promotion of the record ensued, book-ended by television appearances on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' and the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''. However, Smith's condition began to deteriorate as he had become addicted to heroin either towards the end of or just after the ''Figure 8'' tour.&lt;ref name="Gowing" /&gt;

=== 2001–02: Addiction and scrapped recordings ===
[[File:Crystal Ballroom entrance - Portland, Oregon.JPG|alt=Crystal Ballroom from the street—a three-story brick building with an elaborate black awning|thumb|The Crystal Ballroom music venue in Portland, Oregon. One of Smith's performances here in December 2001 drew concern from a reviewer.]]

Around the time he began recording his final album, Smith began to display signs of [[paranoia]], often believing that a white van followed him wherever he went.{{sfn|Nugent|2004}} He would have friends drop him off for recording sessions almost a mile away from the studio, and to reach the location, he would trudge through hundreds of yards of brush and cliffs. He started telling people that [[DreamWorks]] was out to get him: "Not long ago my house was broken into, and songs were stolen off my computer which have wound up in the hands of certain people who work at a certain label. I've also been followed around for months at a time. I wouldn't even want to necessarily say it's the people from that label who are following me around, but it was probably them who broke into my house."&lt;ref name="Under the Radar 1" /&gt; During this period, Smith hardly ate, subsisting primarily on ice cream. He would go without sleeping for several days and then sleep for an entire day.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

A follow-up to Smith's 2000 album was originally planned to happen with [[Rob Schnapf]], but their sessions were abandoned. Smith also began distancing himself from manager Margaret Mittleman, who had handled him since the ''Roman Candle'' days.&lt;ref name="Gowing" /&gt; He finally began recording a new album with only himself and [[Jon Brion]] as producers sometime during 2001. The pair had recorded a substantial amount of music for the album when Brion confronted Smith about his [[drug abuse|drug]] and [[alcoholism|alcohol abuse]].&lt;ref name="The Confabulators"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.confabulators.com/2005/elliott-smith-lives-again-from-a-basement-on-the-hill-v2 |title=Elliott Smith Lives Again!

He later said "There was even a little more than half of a record done before this new one that I just scrapped because of a blown friendship with someone that made me so depressed I didn't want to hear any of those songs. He was just helping me record the songs and stuff, and then the friendship kind of fell apart all of a sudden one day. It just made it kind of awkward being alone in the car listening to the songs."&lt;ref name="Under the Radar 1" /&gt;

When Brion sent a bill for the abandoned sessions to DreamWorks, executives [[Lenny Waronker]] and Luke Wood scheduled a meeting with Smith to determine what went wrong with the sessions. The singer complained of intrusion upon his personal life from the label, as well as poor promotion for the ''Figure 8'' album. The talks proved to be fruitless, and soon after, Smith sent a message to the executives, stating that if they did not release him from his contract, he would take his own life.&lt;ref name="Gowing" /&gt; In May 2001, Smith set out to re-record the album, mostly on his own, but with some help from [[David McConnell]] of [[Goldenboy]]. McConnell told ''Spin'' that, during this time, Smith would smoke over $1,500 worth of heroin and [[crack cocaine|crack]] per day, would often talk about suicide, and on numerous occasions tried to give himself an overdose. [[Steven Drozd]] of [[The Flaming Lips]] and Scott McPherson of [[Sense Field]] played a few drum tracks, [[Sam Coomes]] contributed some bass guitar and backing vocals, but almost every other instrument was recorded by Smith.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Smith's song "[[Needle in the Hay]]" was included in [[Wes Anderson]]'s 2001 dark comedy film ''[[The Royal Tenenbaums]]'' during a [[suicide attempt]] scene. Smith was originally supposed to contribute a cover of The Beatles' "[[Hey Jude]]" for the film, but when he failed to do so in time, Anderson had to use [[Mutato Muzika|The Mutato Muzika Orchestra]]'s version of the track instead.&lt;ref name="Wes Anderson"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1008489_2,00.html |title=The Life Melodic |last=Miller |first=Nancy |date=December 20, 2004 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly|EW.com]] | accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson would later say that Smith "was in a bad state" at the time.&lt;ref name="Wes Anderson" /&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2017}}

Smith's live performances during 2001 and 2002 were infrequent, typically in the [[Pacific Northwest]] or Los Angeles. A review of his December 20, 2001 show at Portland's [[Crystal Ballroom (Portland, Oregon)|Crystal Ballroom]] expressed concern over his appearance and performance: his hair was uncharacteristically greasy and long, his face was bearded and gaunt, and during his songs he exhibited alarming signs of "memory-loss and butterfingers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-2607-elliott_smith_%281969_2003%29.html |title=Elliott Smith (1969–2003) |date=October 29, 2003 |website=[[Willamette Week]] |accessdate=June 25, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717071127/http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-2607-elliott_smith_%281969_2003%29.html |archivedate=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At another performance in San Francisco that month, the audience began shouting out lyrics when Smith could not remember them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://magnetmagazine.com/live/livesmith.html |title=''Magnet'' Live Review: Elliott Smith |last=Stoltz |first=Peter |website=[[Magnet (magazine)|Magnet]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013103320/http://magnetmagazine.com/live/livesmith.html |archivedate=October 13, 2007 |accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2003: Reemergence and ''From a Basement on the Hill'' ===

[[File:Elliott Smith live NYC.jpg|thumb|left|One of Smith's last performances in New York City at the Lit Lounge in January 2003. He played Knitting Factory &amp; North Six in June 2003.]]

Smith had attempted to go to [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]] several times, but found that he was unable to relate to the popular treatments for addicts that used a [[twelve-step program]] basis for treatment. "I couldn't do the [[twelve-step program|first step]] […] I couldn't say what you were supposed to say and mean it."&lt;ref name="Under the Radar 1" /&gt; In 2002, Smith went to the Neurotransmitter Restoration Center in [[Beverly Hills]] to start a course of treatment for his [[drug addiction]]. In one of his final interviews, he spoke about the center, "What they do is an [[intravenous drip|IV]] treatment where they put a [[Hypodermic needle|needle]] in your arm, and you're on a drip bag, but the only thing that's in the drip bag is [[amino acids]] and [[saline (medicine)|saline]] solution. I was coming off of a lot of psych meds and other things. I was even on an [[antipsychotic]], although I'm not [[psychotic]]."&lt;ref name="Under the Radar 1" /&gt;

Two sold-out solo acoustic concerts at [[Hollywood]]'s Henry Fonda Theater, on January 31 and February 1, 2003, saw Smith attempting to reestablish his credibility as a live performer. Before the show, Smith scrawled "[[Kali]]&amp;nbsp;– The Destroyer" (the [[Hindu]] goddess associated with time and change) in large block letters with [[permanent marker|permanent ink]] on his left arm, which was visible to the crowd during the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sweetadeline.net/jan03.html |title=January 2003 |website=Sweet Adeline |accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2004-10-14/music/sleepwalker/ |title=Sleepwalker – Page 1 – Los Angeles |last=Bemis |first=Alec Hanley |date=October 14, 2004 |website=[[LA Weekly]] | accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On several songs, he was backed by a stripped-down drum kit played by Robin Peringer (of the band [[764-HERO]]), and on one track, members of opening band [[Rilo Kiley]] contributed backing vocals. Smith then played two more live shows in his adopted hometown: three months later at The Derby and once at the ''L.A. Weekly'' Music Awards in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=L.A.

After his 34th birthday on August 6, 2003, he gave up alcohol, caffeine, red meat, refined sugar and his longtime (sometimes abused) regimen of [[psychiatric medication]].&lt;ref name="Gowing" /&gt; Director [[Mike Mills (director)|Mike Mills]] had been working with Smith during his final years and described Smith's troubles and apparent recovery: "I gave the script to him, then he dropped off the face of the earth […] he went through his whole crazy time, but by the time I was done with the film, he was making ''From a Basement on the Hill'' and I was shocked that he was actually making music."&lt;ref name="Thumbsucker"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1507697/elliott-smith-polyphonics-on-thumbsucker-soundtrack.jhtml |title=Elliott Smith, Polyphonics Bring Balance to ''Thumbsucker'' Soundtrack – Music, Celebrity, Artist News |last=Perez |first=Rodrigo |date=August 16, 2005 |website=[[MTV News]] | accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With things improving for Smith after several troubled years, he began experimenting with [[noise music]] and worked on his girlfriend Jennifer Chiba's [[iMac]] with the intent of learning how to record with computers, noting that it was the only method with which he was still unfamiliar.&lt;ref name="Under the Radar 1" /&gt; Smith jokingly labeled his experimental way of recording "The California Frown" (a play on the [[Beach Boys]]' "[[California Sound]]").&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/18/arts/music-elliott-smith-s-uneasy-afterlife.html |title=Music; Elliott Smith's Uneasy Afterlife |last=Smith |first=R J |date=July 18, 2004 |website=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said of the songs, "They're kind of more noisy with the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] all distorted. Some are more [[acoustic music|acoustic]], but there aren't too many like that. Lately I've just been making up a lot of noise."&lt;ref name="Under the Radar 1" /&gt;

He was also in the process of recording songs for the [[Thumbsucker (soundtrack)|''Thumbsucker'' soundtrack]], including [[Big Star (band)|Big Star]]'s "[[Thirteen (song)|Thirteen]]" and [[Cat Stevens]]'s "Trouble".&lt;ref name="Thumbsucker" /&gt; In August 2003, Suicide Squeeze Records put out a limited-edition [[gramophone record|vinyl]] single for "Pretty (Ugly Before)", a song that Smith had been playing since the ''Figure 8'' tour.

Smith's final show was at Redfest at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City on September 19, 2003. The final song he played live was "[[Long, Long, Long]]" by [[The Beatles]].

== Death ==
Smith died on October 21, 2003 at the age of 34 from two stab wounds to the chest.&lt;ref name="autopsy" /&gt; At the time of the stabbing, he was at his Lemoyne Street home in [[Echo Park, California]],&lt;ref name="autopsyreport"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/rockers-autopsy-doesnt-rule-out-homicide |title=Rocker's Autopsy Doesn't Rule Out Homicide |date=January 8, 2004 |website=The Smoking Gun |accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he lived with his girlfriend, Jennifer Chiba. According to Chiba, the two were arguing,&lt;ref name="Petridis" /&gt; and she locked herself in the bathroom to take a shower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2004/01/12/080503.php |title=Blogcritics.org: Smith's Girlfriend Speaks... |last=Dodge |first=Marty |date=January 12, 2004 |website=Blogcritics.org |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090715081152/http://blogcritics.org/archives/2004/01/12/080503.php |archivedate=July 15, 2009 |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiba heard him scream and upon opening the door saw Smith standing with a knife in his chest. She pulled the knife out, after which he collapsed and she called [[9-1-1]] at 12:18&amp;nbsp;p.m. Smith died in the hospital with the time of death listed as 1:36&amp;nbsp;p.m.

A possible [[suicide note]], written on a [[Post-it note]], read: "I'm so sorry—love, Elliott. God forgive me."&lt;ref name="autopsy" /&gt; The name "Elliott" is misspelled as "Elliot" in the coroner's report of the note, but not on the Post-it.&lt;ref name="autopsy" /&gt; While Smith's death was reported as a [[suicide]], the official [[autopsy]] report released in December 2003 left open the question of [[homicide]].&lt;ref name="autopsy" /&gt;

According to ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'', record producer [[Larry Crane (recording engineer)|Larry Crane]] reported on his Tape Op message board that he had planned to help Smith [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]] his album in mid-November. Crane wrote, "I hadn't talked to Elliott in over a year. His girlfriend, Jennifer, called me [last week] and asked if I'd like to come to L.A. and help mix and finish [Smith's album]. I said 'yes, of course', and chatted with Elliott for the first time in ages. It seems surreal that he would call me to finish an album and then a week later kill himself. I talked to Jennifer this morning, who was obviously shattered and in tears, and she said, 'I don't understand, he was so healthy.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://messageboard.tapeop.com/viewtopic.php?printertopic=1&amp;t=4998&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;&amp;start=75&amp;sid=7a9f2fc2b7da075cd204be4b29fa7513 |title=Tape Op Message Board :: View Topic – OT: Elliott Smith Has Died... |last=Crane |first=Larry |authorlink=Larry Crane (recording engineer) |date=October 22, 2003 |website=Tape Op |accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[coroner]] reported that no traces of illegal substances or alcohol were found in Smith's system at the time of his death but did find prescribed levels of [[antidepressant]], [[anxiolytic]], and [[Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|ADHD]] medications, including [[clonazepam]], [[mirtazapine]], [[atomoxetine]], and [[amphetamine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2004-01-01/news/the-elliott-smith-mystery/ |title=The Elliott Smith Mystery – Page 1 – News – Los Angeles |last=Pelisek |first=Christine |date=January 1, 2004 |website=[[LA Weekly]] | accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were no [[hesitation wound]]s, which are typical of suicide by self-infliction.&lt;ref name="Petridis" /&gt; However, the authorities do not seem to be investigating the case further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nypress.com/18/25/books/hurewitz.cfm |title=New York's Premier Alternative Newspaper.

Shortly after Smith's death, a fan memorial was initiated outside Solutions Audio (4334 [[Sunset Boulevard]], [[Los Angeles, California]]), the site at which the cover of the ''[[Figure 8 (album)|Figure 8]]'' album was shot. Farewell messages to Smith were written on the wall, and flowers, photos, candles, and empty bottles of alcohol mentioned in Smith's songs were left.

In an October 2013 ''Spin'' magazine article—a reflection at the ten-year anniversary of Smith's death—drummer McPherson stated that Smith was "a sick man without his medicine" during the last 31 days of his life, when he was not only sober, but had also given up red meat and sugar. In the same article, Chiba recalls thinking, "Okay, you're asking a lot of yourself. You're giving up a lot at once." Chiba further explained that "anyone who understands drug abuse knows that you use drugs to hide from your past or sedate yourself from strong, overwhelming feelings. So when you're newly clean and coming off the medications that have been masking all those feelings, that's when you're the most vulnerable." Writing for ''Spin'', Liam Gowing also encountered a local musician who stated that Smith had said to him: "The people who try to intervene, they're good people who genuinely care about you. But they don't know what you're going through. Do what you need to do." According to the musician, Smith had adamantly dissuaded him from suicide.&lt;ref name="Gowing" /&gt;

[[File:Joanna Bolme of Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks - Constellations Festival, Leeds 2011.jpg|alt=Bolme onstage playing bass guitar|thumb|Joanna Bolme helped bring ''From a Basement on the Hill'' to completion in the wake of Smith's death.]]

''[[From a Basement on the Hill]]'', almost four years in production, was released on October 19, 2004, by [[ANTI- Records]] (a part of [[Epitaph Records]]). With Smith's family in control of his estate, they chose to bring in [[Rob Schnapf]] and Smith's ex-girlfriend [[Joanna Bolme]] to sort through the recordings and mix the album. Although Smith had voiced his desire for it to be a double album or a regular album with a bonus disc, it was not clear whether it would have been possible for him to release it that way had he completed it.&lt;ref name="Under the Radar 1" /&gt; As completed by Schnapf and Bolme, it was released as a 15-track single album. Many songs from the sessions (later leaked onto the Internet) were not included, such as "True Love", "Everything's OK", "Stickman", and "Suicide Machine" (a reworking of the ''Figure 8''-era unreleased instrumental "Tiny Time Machine").&lt;ref name="The Confabulators" /&gt; There has been unconfirmed speculation that Smith's family made the decision not to include some songs on the record due to their lyrical content, although songs such as "King's Crossing" that deal with darker subjects did make the album.&lt;ref name="The Confabulators" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/from-a-basement-on-the-hill/elliott-smith |title=''From a Basement on the Hill'' Review |website=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Elliott Smith and the Big Nothing]]'', a biography by [[Benjamin Nugent]], was rushed to publication and hit stores shortly after ''From a Basement on the Hill'', barely beyond the first anniversary of the musician's death. Smith's family, as well as Joanna Bolme, Jennifer Chiba, Neil Gust, [[Sam Coomes]], and [[Janet Weiss]], all declined to be interviewed. It contained interviews with Rob Schnapf, David McConnell, and [[Pete Krebs]]. The book received mixed reviews, with ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' remarking that while "Nugent manages to patch together the major beats of Smith's life, he can offer little meaningful insight.

In 2005, a tribute album, ''A Tribute to Elliott Smith'', was released. It featured various bands performing tributes to Smith.&lt;ref name="cdbaby-review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/esmithtrib|title=CD Review {{!}} A Tribute To Elliott Smith|work=cdbaby|publisher=cdbaby|accessdate=2009-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 8, 2007, a posthumous two-disc [[compilation album]] entitled ''[[New Moon (Elliott Smith album)|New Moon]]'' was released by Kill Rock Stars. The album contained 24 songs recorded by Smith between 1994 and 1997 during his tenure with the label, songs that were not included on albums, as well as a few early versions and previously released [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]]. In the United States, the album debuted at number 24 on the ''Billboard'' 200, selling about 24,000 copies in its first week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1052095/buble-sidesteps-bone-thugs-to-claim-no-1 |title=Buble Sidesteps Bone Thugs to Claim No. 1 |last=Hasty |first=Katie |date=May 16, 2007 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record received favorable reviews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/new-moon/elliott-smith |title=''New Moon'' Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was [[Metacritic]]'s 15th best-reviewed album of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/browse/albums/score/metascore/year?sort=desc&amp;view=condensed&amp;year_selected=2007 |title=Highest and Lowest Scoring Music and Albums |website=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A portion of the proceeds from album sales were to go to [[Outside In (organization)|Outside In]], a social service agency for low-income adults and homeless youth in Portland, Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1054996/elliott-smith-rarities-compiled-on-new-moon |title=Elliott Smith Rarities Compiled on ''New Moon'' |last=Cohen |first=Jonathan |date=February 14, 2007 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | accessdate=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A five-song CD featuring previously unreleased live recordings of Smith performing acoustically at [[Largo (nightclub)|Largo]] in Los Angeles was included in the release.

Following the singer's death, the Smith estate licensed his songs for use in a number of film and television projects, such as ''[[One Tree Hill (TV show)|One Tree Hill]]'', ''[[The Girl Next Door (2004 film)|The Girl Next Door]]'', ''[[Georgia Rule]]'', and ''[[Paranoid Park (film)|Paranoid Park]]''.

In a March 2009 interview, Larry Crane said that the estate of Elliott Smith was now "defunct" and all rights previously held by the singer are now in the control of "his parents".&lt;ref name="Glorious Noise" /&gt; Crane went on to say that his parents own the rights to Smith's high school recordings, some of the Heatmiser material, all solo songs recorded until his 1998 record deal with [[DreamWorks Records]], and ''From a Basement on the Hill''.&lt;ref name="Glorious Noise" /&gt; DreamWorks Records was acquired by [[Universal Music Group]] in 2003, and [[Interscope Records]] currently "owns all studio and live recording from Jan 1998 to his passing, except for the songs on ''From a Basement on the Hill''."&lt;ref name="Glorious Noise" /&gt;

In December 2009, Kill Rock Stars announced that it had obtained the rights to re-release ''Roman Candle'' and ''From a Basement on the Hill'', originally released by Cavity Search and ANTI-, respectively.&lt;ref name="reissues"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/37398-hear-an-unreleased-elliott-smith-song/ |title=Hear an Unreleased Elliott Smith Song |last=Breihan |first=Tom |date=December 15, 2009 |website=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] | accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Roman Candle'' would be remastered by Larry Crane.&lt;ref name="reissues" /&gt; Along with the press release, Kill Rock Stars posted a previously unreleased track of Smith's, titled "Cecilia/Amanda", as a free download.&lt;ref name="reissues" /&gt; ''Roman Candle'' and ''From a Basement on the Hill'' were re-released on April 6, 2010, in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.killrockstars.com/news/ |title=killrockstars |website=[[Kill Rock Stars|killrockstars.com]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100319222724/http://www.killrockstars.com/news/ |archivedate=March 19, 2010 |accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A greatest hits compilation titled ''[[An Introduction to... Elliott Smith]]'' was released in November 2010 by Domino Records (UK) and Kill Rock Stars (US).

In August 2013, there was a memorial concert in Portland, Oregon and three other cities. Attending the Portland show were several musicians Smith had performed with, friends, and an appearance by film director [[Gus Van Sant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.spin.com/2013/06/elliott-smith-birthday-tribute-benefit-concerts-grandaddy-gus-van-sant/ |title=Elliott Smith Tribute Concerts Planned in Four Cities |publisher=SPIN |date= |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, director [[Paul Thomas Anderson]] posted a video of the pilot episode for a show called ''The Jon Brion Show'', featuring an acoustic set by Smith including accompaniment by Brion and pianist [[Brad Mehldau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityartsonline.com/truth-about-jon-brion-show-feat-elliott-smith Cityartsonline]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 17, 2015, a documentary about Smith's life titled ''[[Heaven Adores You]]'' saw a limited theatrical release. The documentary enlisted a number of close friends and family members, as well as hours of audio interviews throughout Smith's short career. The film was directed by Nickolas Rossi and released through [[Eagle Rock Entertainment]]. ''Heaven Adores You'' received positive reviews from [[Consequence of Sound]], ''[[The Guardian]]'', and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goble |first=Blake |url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/05/film-review-heaven-adores-you/ |title=Film Review: Heaven Adores You |publisher=Consequence of Sound |date=2015-05-19 |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/heaven-adores-you-melbourne-review-723355 |title='Heaven Adores You': Melbourne Review |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date= |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Musical style and influences ==
[[File:Bob Dylan 1978.jpg|thumb|180px|Bob Dylan was one of the biggest influences on Smith's musical career.]]

He liked classic literature, especially [[Samuel Beckett]], [[T. S. Eliot]], and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] (and other Russian novelists).&lt;ref name="NME chat" /&gt;

Smith mentioned his admiration for [[Bob Dylan]] in several interviews, citing him as an early musical influence. He once commented: "My father taught me how to play '[[Don't Think Twice, It's All Right]]'. I love Dylan's words, but even more than that, I love the fact that he loves words."&lt;ref name="Shutt page 2" /&gt; Smith covered Dylan's "[[When I Paint My Masterpiece]]" several times in concert. Smith has also been compared to folk singer [[Nick Drake]], due to his fingerpicking style and vocals. Darryl Cater of [[AllMusic]] called references to "the definitive folk loner" Drake "inevitable",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/roman-candle-mw0000120632 |title=''Roman Candle'' – Elliott Smith : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |last=Cater |first=Darryl |website=[[AllMusic]] | publisher=[[AllRovi]] | accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Smith's lyrics have been compared to those in Drake's minimalist and haunting [[Pink Moon|final album]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/elliott-smith-mw0000177957 |title=''Elliott Smith'' – Elliott Smith : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |last=Huey |first=Steve |website=[[AllMusic]] | publisher=[[AllRovi]] | accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith was a dedicated fan of [[The Beatles]] (as well as their solo projects), once noting that he had been listening to them frequently since he was about "four years old"&lt;ref&gt;Smith said this when asked "Have you been listening to a lot of Beatles lately?" in ''[[Strange Parallel]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and also claimed that hearing ''[[The Beatles (album)|The White Album]]'' was his original inspiration to become a musician.&lt;ref name="NME chat" /&gt; In 1998, Smith contributed a [[cover version|cover]] of the Beatles song "[[Because (The Beatles song)|Because]]" to the closing credits and [[American Beauty (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] of the film ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]''. Although this was the only Beatles song that Smith ever officially released, he is known to have recorded at least two others ("[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]" and "[[I'll Be Back (song)|I'll Be Back]]") and played many songs by both the band and the members' solo projects at live concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sweetadeline.net/multimedia.htm |title=Audio |website=Sweet Adeline |accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith said that transitions were his favorite part of songs and that he preferred to write broader, more [[impressionist music|impressionistic]] music closer to [[pop music|pop]] rather than [[folk music]].&lt;ref name="Shutt page 2" /&gt; Smith compared his songs to stories or dreams, not purely confessional pieces that people could relate to.&lt;ref name="Anderman" /&gt; When asked about the dark nature of his songwriting and the [[cult following]] he was gaining, Smith said he felt it was merely a product of his writing songs that were strongly meaningful to him rather than anything contrived.&lt;ref name="Anderman" /&gt; Larry Crane, Smith's posthumous archivist, has said that he was surprised at the amount of "recycling of musical ideas" that he has encountered while cataloging the singer's private tapes:&lt;ref name="Glorious Noise"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gloriousnoise.com/2009/elliott_smith_archives_larry_c |title=Elliott Smith's Archives: The Glono Interview with Larry Crane |last=Brown |first=Jake |date=March 30, 2009 |website=Glorious Noise |accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I found songs recorded in high school reworked 15 years on.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21045">'''Equation-free modeling''' is a method for [[multiscale computation]] and [[computer-aided analysis]]. It is designed for a class of complicated systems in which one observes evolution at a macroscopic, coarse scale of interest, while accurate models are only given at a finely detailed, microscopic, level of description. The framework empowers one to perform macroscopic computational tasks (over large space-time scales) using only appropriately initialized microscopic simulation on short time and small length scales. The methodology eliminates the derivation of explicit macroscopic [[evolution equation]]s when these equations conceptually exist but are not available in closed form; hence the term equation-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last1=Kevrekidis |first1=I.G.|authorlink=Yannís G. Kevrekidis |last2=Samaey |first2=G. |year=2009 |title=Equation-free multiscale computation: algorithms and applications |journal=Annual Review of Physical Chemistry |volume=60 |pages=321–344 |doi=10.1146/annurev.physchem.59.032607.093610 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
In a wide range of chemical, physical and biological systems, coherent macroscopic behavior emerges from interactions between microscopic entities themselves (molecules, cells, grains, animals in a population, agents) and with their environment. Sometimes, remarkably, a coarse-scale differential equation model (such as the [[Navier-Stokes equations]] for fluid flow, or a [[reaction-diffusion system]]) can accurately describe macroscopic behavior.  Such macroscale modeling makes use of general principles of conservation (atoms, particles, mass, momentum, energy), and closed into a well-posed system through phenomenological [[constitutive equations]] or [[equations of state]].  However, one increasingly encounters [[complex systems]] that only have known microscopic, fine scale, models. In such cases, although we observe the emergence of coarse-scale, macroscopic behavior, modeling it through explicit closure relations may be impossible or impractical. [[Non-Newtonian fluid]] flow, [[chemotaxis]], [[porous media]] transport, [[epidemiology]], brain modeling and neuronal systems are some typical examples.  Equation-free modeling aims to use such microscale models to predict coarse macroscale emergent phenomena.

Performing coarse-scale computational tasks directly with fine-scale models is often infeasible: direct simulation over the full space-time domain of interest is often computationally prohibitive. Moreover,  modeling tasks, such as numerical bifurcation analysis, are often impossible to perform on the fine-scale model directly: a coarse-scale steady state may not imply a steady state for the fine-scale system, since individual molecules or particles do not stop moving when the gas density or pressure become stationary. Equation-free modeling circumvents such problems by using short bursts of appropriately initialized fine-scale simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Kevrekidis, I.G. |year=2003 |title=Equation-free, coarse-grained multiscale computation: enabling microscopic simulators to perform system-level tasks |journal=Comm. Math. Sciences |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=715–762 |mr=2041455 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The coarse time-stepper==
Dynamic problems invoke the coarse time-stepper.   In essence, short bursts of computational experiments with the fine-scale simulator estimate local time derivatives. Given an initial condition for the coarse variables &lt;math&gt;U(t_k)&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t_k&lt;/math&gt;, the coarse time-stepper involves four steps:

* Lifting, creates microscale initial conditions &lt;math&gt;u(t_k)&lt;/math&gt;, consistent with the macrostate &lt;math&gt;U(t_k)&lt;/math&gt;;
* Simulation, uses the microscale simulator to compute the microscale state &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; at over a short interval &lt;math&gt;t_k\leq t \leq t_k+\delta t&lt;/math&gt;;
* Restriction, obtains the macrostate &lt;math&gt;U(t_k+\delta t)&lt;/math&gt; from the fine-scale state &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt;;
* the Time-step, extrapolation of macrostate &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;t_k&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;t_{k+1}=t_k+\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; predicts the state a macrotime in the future.

Multiple time steps simulates the system into the macro-future.
If the microscale model is stochastic, then an ensemble of microscale simulations may be needed to obtain sufficiently good extrapolation in the time step.  Such a coarse time-stepper may be used in many algorithms of traditional continuum numerical analysis, such as numerical bifurcation analysis, optimization, control, and even accelerated coarse-scale simulation.

Traditionally, algebraic formulae determine time derivatives of the coarse model. In our approach, the macroscale derivative is estimated by the inner microscale simulator, in effect performing a closure on demand.  A reason for the name ''equation-free'' is by analogy with matrix-free numerical linear algebra;&lt;ref&gt;C. T. Kelley. ''Iterative Methods for linear and nonlinear equations'', SIAM, Philadelphia, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; the name emphasizes that  macro-level equations are never constructed explicitly in closed form.

===Restriction===
The restriction operator often follows directly from the specific choice of the macroscale variables. For example, when the microscale model evolves an ensemble of many particles, the restriction typically computes the first few moments of the particle distribution (the density, momentum, and energy).

===Lifting===
The lifting operator is usually much more involved. For example, consider a particle model: we need to define a mapping from a few low order moments of the particle distribution to initial conditions for each particle. The assumption that a relation exists that closes in these low order, coarse, moments, implies that the detailed microscale configurations are functionals of the moments (sometimes referred to as slaving &lt;ref&gt;H. Haken. Slaving principle revisited. ''Physica D'', 97:95–103, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;).  We assume this relationship is established/emerges on time scales that are fast compared to the overall system evolution (see [[slow manifold]] theory and applications &lt;ref&gt;A. J. Roberts. Effectively model dynamics, deterministic and stochastic, across multiple space and time scales. In J. G. Hartnett and P. C. Abbott, editors, ''Frontiers of Fundamental and Computational Physics: 10th International Symposium'', volume 1246, pages 75–87. AIP, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;).  Unfortunately, the closure (slaving relations) are algebraically unknown (as otherwise the coarse evolution law would be known).

Initializing the unknown microscale modes randomly introduces a lifting error: we rely on the separation of macro and micro time scales to ensure a quick relaxation to functionals of the coarse macrostates (healing). A preparatory step may be required, possibly involving microscale simulations constrained to keep the macrostates fixed.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Ryckaert, G. Ciccotti, and H. Berendsen. Numerical integration of the Cartesian equation of motion of a system with constraints: molecular dynamics of N-alkanes. ''J. Comput. Phys.'', 23:237, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; When the system has a unique fixed point for the unknown microscale details conditioned upon the coarse macrostates,  a constrained runs algorithm may perform this preparatory step using only the microscale time-stepper.&lt;ref&gt;C. W. Gear, T. J.  Kaper, I. G. Kevrekidis, and A. Zagaris. Projecting to a Slow Manifold: Singularly Perturbed Systems and Legacy Codes. ''SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems'' 4(3):711–732, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===An illustrative example===
A toy problem illustrates the basic concepts.  For example, consider the [[differential equation]] system for two variables &lt;math&gt;(U(t),u(t))&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dU}{dt}=-U-u+2\,,\quad \frac{du}{dt}=100(U^3-u).&lt;/math&gt;
Capital &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; denotes the presumed macroscale variable, and lowercase &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; the microscale variable. This classification means that we assume a coarse model of the form &lt;math&gt;dU/dt=G(U)&lt;/math&gt; exists, although we do not necessarily know what it is.   Arbitrarily define the lifting from any given macrostate &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;(U,u)=(U,0.5)&lt;/math&gt;. A simulation using this lifting and the coarse time-stepper is shown in the figure.
[[File:EquationFreeProjectiveIntegration.png|400px|thumb|Equation-free coarse time-stepper applied to the illustrative example differential equation system using &lt;math&gt;\delta t=0.1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U(0)=-1&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The solution of the differential equation rapidly moves to the [[slow manifold]]  &lt;math&gt;u\approx U^3&lt;/math&gt; for any initial data. The coarse time-stepper solution would agree better with the full solution when the 100 factor is increased. The graph shows the lifted solution (blue solid line) &lt;math&gt;(U,u)&lt;/math&gt;. At times &lt;math&gt;t=n\delta t&lt;/math&gt;, the solution is restricted and then lifted again, which here is simply setting &lt;math&gt;u(n\delta t)=0.5&lt;/math&gt;. The slow manifold is shown as a  red line. The right plot shows the time derivative of the restricted solution as a function of time (blue curve), as well as the time derivative &lt;math&gt;dU/dt&lt;/math&gt; (the coarse time derivative), as observed from a full simulation (red curve).

===On application to concrete multiscale problems===
The equation-free approach has been applied to many examples. The examples illustrate the various ways to construct and assemble the algorithmic building blocks.  Numerical analysis establishes the accuracy and efficiency of this approach. Additional numerical analysis  on other methods of this type has also been done.&lt;ref&gt;W. E and B. Engquist (2003). The heterogeneous multiscale methods ''Comm. Math. Sciences'' 1(1):87–132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying the equation-free paradigm to a real problem requires considerable care, especially defining the lifting and restriction operators, and the appropriate outer solver.

* The first challenge is to identify the macroscale observables.  They need to be complete enough so that the unknown microscale variables can be reliably reconstructed (lifted).  Physical arguments often the identify the macroscale observables.  Almost always one invokes densities, but there are some surprisingly simple examples where correlation functions are essential macroscale variables.&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Young, A. J. Roberts, and G. Stuhne. Reproductive pair correlations and the clustering of organisms. Nature, 412:328–331, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; If not resorting to physical arguments, then modern data-mining or manifold learning techniques, such as Isomap or diffusion maps, may obtain the macroscale variables from microscale simulation.&lt;ref&gt;R. R. Coifman et al. (2005). Geometric diffusions as a tool for harmonic analysis and structure definition of data: Diffusion maps Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 102(21):7426–7431.&lt;/ref&gt;
* There should be a clear separation between the time-scales of the macroscale observables and the time-scales of the remaining microscale modes quasi-equilibrate given any macrostate.
* Knowing the macroscale observables might not be sufficient.  One strategy to obtain such information is the baby-bathwater scheme which uses only appropriately initialized simulations.&lt;ref&gt;J. Li, P. G. Kevrekidis, C. W. Gear and I. G. Kevrekidis (2003). Deciding the nature of the coarse equation through microscopic simulations: the baby-bathwater scheme ''SIAM Multiscale Modeling and Simulation'' 1(3):391–407.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coarse bifurcation analysis==
The recursive projection method&lt;ref&gt;G.M. Schroff and H.B. Keller (1993). Stabilization of unstable procedures: the recursive projection method ''SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis'' 30: 1099–1120.&lt;/ref&gt; enables the computation of [[bifurcation diagram]]s using legacy simulation code.  It also empowers the coarse time-stepper to perform equation-free bifurcation computations.  Consider the coarse time stepper in its effective form
:&lt;math&gt;\vec U^{n+1}=\vec S(\vec U^n,\lambda; \delta t),&lt;/math&gt;
which includes explicit dependence upon one or more parameters &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.  Bifurcation analysis computes [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibria]] or [[periodic orbit]]s, their stability and dependence upon parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

Compute a coarse equilibrium as a [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of the coarse time stepper
:&lt;math&gt;\vec U-\vec S(\vec U,\lambda; \delta t)=\vec 0.&lt;/math&gt;
In the equation-free context, the recursive projection method is the outer solver of this equation, and the coarse time-stepper enables this method to be performed using fine scale dynamics.

Additionally, for problems where the macroscale has continuous symmetries, one can use a template based approach &lt;ref&gt;C. Rowley and J. Marsden (2000). Reconstruction equations and the Karhunen–Loève expansion for systems with symmetry ''Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena'' 142: 1–19.&lt;/ref&gt; to compute coarse [[self-similar]] or [[travelling wave]] solutions as fixed points of a coarse time-stepper that also encodes appropriate rescaling and/or shifting of space-time and/or solution.
For example, self-similar diffusion solutions may be found as the [[probability density function]] of detailed [[molecular dynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Chen, P. Debenedetti, C.W. Gear, and I.G. Kevrekidis (2004). From molecular dynamics to coarse self-similar solutions: a simple example using equation-free computation ''Journal of Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics'' 120: 215–223.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative to the recursive projection method is to use Newton—Krylov methods.&lt;ref&gt;C.T. Kelley (1995). ''Iterative Methods for linear and nonlinear equations'' SIAM, Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coarse projective integration==

The coarse time stepper accelerates simulation over large macroscale times. In the scheme described above, let the large macro-time-step &lt;math&gt;\Delta t\gg\delta t&lt;/math&gt;, and be on the time scale of the slow coarse dynamics.  Let the computed &lt;math&gt;U^n\approx U(n\Delta t)&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the coarse variable, and let the microscale simulation compute &lt;math&gt;U^{n,k}\approx U(n\Delta t+k\delta t)&lt;/math&gt; from a local time simulation with initial condition that the coarse variable &lt;math&gt;U(n\Delta t)=U^n=U^{n,0}&lt;/math&gt;.  Then we approximate &lt;math&gt;U((n+1)\Delta t)&lt;/math&gt; via extrapolating over a gap by
:&lt;math&gt;U^{n+1}=U^{n,k}+(\Delta t-k\delta t)F(\vec U^n)&lt;/math&gt;
where, for example, simple linear extrapolation would be 
:&lt;math&gt;F(\vec U^n)=(U^{n,k}-U^{n,k-1})/\delta t&lt;/math&gt;
This scheme is the called coarse projective forward Euler, and is the simplest in the class.

The &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; steps taken before the extrapolation reflect that we must allow the system to settle onto a quasi-equilibrium (from the microscale point of view), so that we can make a reliable extrapolation of the slow dynamics.  Then the size of the projective integration step is limited by stability of the slow modes.&lt;ref&gt;C.W. Gear and I.G. Kevrekidis. Projective methods for stiff differential equations: problems with gaps in their eigenvalue spectrum . ''SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing'' 24(4):1091–1106, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevrekidis and  Theodoropoulos. Coarse integration/bifurcation analysis via microscopic simulators: micro-Galerkin methods ''Computers and Chemical Engineering'' 26: 941–963, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Higher order schemes for systems where the microscale noise is still apparent on the macroscale time step are more problematic.&lt;ref&gt;X.

==Patch dynamics==

The spatial analogue of projective integration is the gap-tooth scheme.
The idea of the gap-tooth scheme is to perform simulations of small patches of space, the teeth, separated by unsimulated space, the gaps.
By appropriately coupling the small patches of simulations we create a large scale, coarse level, simulation of the spatially extended system.
When the microscale simulator is computationally expensive the gap-tooth scheme empowers efficient large scale prediction.
Furthermore, it does this without us ever having to identify an algebraic closure for a large scale model.
&lt;ref&gt;Kevrekidis, I.G. et al. (2003). Equation-free, coarse-grained multiscale computation: enabling microscopic simulators to perform system-level tasks ''Comm. Math. Sciences'' 1(4): 715–762.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samaey, G.; Roose, D. and Kevrekidis, I.G. (2005). The gap-tooth scheme for homogenization problems ''SIAM Multiscale Modeling and Simulation'' 4: 278–306.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts2007"&gt;Roberts, A.J. and Kevrekidis, I.G. (2007). General tooth boundary conditions for equation free modelling ''SIAM J. Scientific Computing'' 29(4): 1495–1510.&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of the gap-tooth scheme with coarse projective integration is called patch dynamics.

===Coupling boundary conditions===

The key to the gap-tooth and patch scheme is the coupling of the small patches across unsimulated space.
Surprisingly, the generic answer is to simply use classic Lagrange interpolation, whether in one dimension&lt;ref name="Roberts2007"/&gt; or multiple dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Roberts, T. MacKenzie, and J. Bunder. A dynamical systems approach to simulating macroscale spatial dynamics in multiple dimensions. ''J. Engineering Mathematics'', 86(1):175–207, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  This answer is related to the coupling in [[holistic discretization]] and theoretical support provided by the theory of [[slow manifold]]s.
The interpolation provides value or flux boundary conditions as required by the microscale simulator.  
High order consistency between the macroscale gap-tooth/patch scheme and the microscale simulation is achieved through high order Lagrange interpolation.

However, commonly the microscale is a noisy particle based or [[agent-based model]].
In such cases the relevant macroscale variables are averages such as mass and momentum density. 
Then one generally has to form averages over a core of each tooth/patch, and apply the coupling condition over a finite action region on the edges of each tooth/patch.
The provisional recommendation is to make these regions as big as half the tooth/patch.&lt;ref&gt;J. E. Bunder, A. J. Roberts, and I. Kevrekidis. Better buffers for patches in macroscale simulation of systems with microscale randomness. Technical report, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1415], Dec 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
That is, for efficiency one makes the microscale tooth/patch as small as possible, but limited by the need to fit in action and core regions big enough to form accurate enough averages.

===Lifting===

Patch dynamics is the combination of the gap-tooth scheme and coarse projective integration.  Just as for normal projective integration, at the start of each burst of microscale simulation, one has to create an initial condition for each patch that is consistent with the local macroscale variables, and the macroscale gradients from neighboring interpolated patches.  The same techniques suffice.

==Open problems and future directions==

Assumptions and choices about the macroscale evolution are crucial in the equation-free scheme.  The key assumption is that the variables we choose for the macroscale coupling must effectively close on the chosen macroscale.  If the chosen macroscale length is too small then more coarse scale variables may be needed: for example, in fluid dynamics we conventionally close the PDEs for density, momentum and energy; yet in high speed flow especially at lower densities we need to resolve modes of molecular vibration because they have not equilibrated on the time scales of the fluid flow.  Qualitatively the same considerations apply to the equation-free approach.

For many systems appropriate coarse variables are more-or-less known by experience.  However, in complex situations there is a need to automatically detect the appropriate coarse variables, and then use them in the macroscale evolution.  This needs much more research utilizing techniques from data mining and manifold learning.  In some problems it could be that as well as densities, the appropriate coarse variables also need to include spatial correlations, as in the so-called Brownian bugs.&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Young, A. J. Roberts, and G. Stuhne. Reproductive pair correlations and the clustering of organisms. ''Nature'', 412:328–331, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The macroscale may have to be treated as a stochastic system, but then the errors are likely to be much larger and the closures more uncertain.

Critics of [[euthanasia]] sometimes claim that legalizing any form of the practice will lead to a [[slippery slope]] effect, resulting eventually in [[non-voluntary euthanasia|non-voluntary]] or even [[involuntary euthanasia]]. The slippery slope argument has been present in the euthanasia debate since at least the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pappas|1996|page=389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawyer [[Eugene Volokh]] argued in his article ''The Mechanism of the Slippery Slope'' that judicial logic could eventually lead to a gradual break in the legal restrictions for euthanasia,&lt;ref name="SlipperySlopeMechanisms"&gt;{{harvnb|Volok|2003|pp=1057–1058}}&lt;/ref&gt; while medical oncologist and palliative care specialist Jan Bernheim believes the law can provide safeguards against slippery-slope effects, saying that the grievances of euthanasia opponents are unfounded.&lt;ref name="Laws can safeguard the dying"/&gt;

==The slippery slope==

As applied to the euthanasia debate, the slippery slope argument claims that the acceptance of certain practices, such as [[Assisted suicide|physician-assisted suicide]] or [[voluntary euthanasia]], will invariably lead to the acceptance or practice of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable, such as [[Non-voluntary euthanasia|non-voluntary]] or [[involuntary euthanasia]]. Thus, it is argued, in order to prevent these undesirable practices from occurring, we need to resist taking the first step.&lt;ref name="Lewis2007p197"&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2007|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two basic forms which the argument may take, each of which involves different arguments for and against.&lt;ref name="Lewis2007p197" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VanderBurg1991p43"&gt;{{harvnb|van der Burg|1991|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these, referred to as the logical version, argues that the acceptance of the initial act, A, [[logical consequence|logically entails]] the acceptance of B, where A is acceptable but B is an undesirable action.&lt;ref name="VanderBurg1991p43" /&gt; This version is further refined into two forms based on how A entails B. In the first, it is argued that there "is no relevant conceptual difference between A and B"&lt;ref name="VanderBurg1991p44"&gt;{{harvnb|van der Burg|1991|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; – the premises that underlie the acceptance of A logically entail the acceptance of B. Within the euthanasia debate, van der Burg identifies one of Richard Sherlock's objections to Duff and Campbell as fitting this model.&lt;ref name="VanderBurg1991p44" /&gt; Duff and Campbell had presented an argument for the selective non-treatment of newborns suffering from serious defects. In responding to Duff and Campbell's stance, Sherlock argued that the premises which they employed in order to justify their position would be just as effective, if not more-so, in justifying the non-treatment of older children: "In short, if there is any justification at all for what Duff and Campbell propose for newborns then there is better justification for a similar policy with respect to children at any age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sherlock|first=Richard|title=Selective non-treatment of newborns|journal=[[Journal of Medical Ethics]]|volume=5|year=1979|issue=3|pages=140|pmc=1154742 |pmid=90725 |doi=10.1136/jme.5.3.139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second logical form of the slippery slope argument, referred to as the "arbitrary line" version,&lt;ref name="VoluntaryEuthanasiaStanford"&gt;{{cite web|title=Voluntary Euthanasia|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/euthanasia-voluntary/|work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the acceptance of A will lead to the acceptance of A1, as A1 is not significantly different from A. A1 will then lead to A2, A2 to A3, and eventually the process will lead to the unacceptable B.&lt;ref name="VanderBurg1991p44" /&gt; As Glover argues, this version of the argument does not say that there is no significant difference between A and B, but instead argues that it is impossible to justify accepting A while also denying B – drawing a line at any point between the two would be creating an arbitrary cut-off point that would be unjustifiable.&lt;ref name="Glover 1977 page=166"&gt;{{harvnb|Glover|1977|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glover provides the example of infanticide (or non-voluntary euthanasia) and severely deformed children:

{{Quote|"If it is allowable at birth for children with some grave abnormality, what will we say about an equally grave abnormality that is only detectable at three months? And another that is only detectable at six months? And another that is detectable at birth only slightly less serious? And another that is slightly less serious than that one?"|Jonathan Glover&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glover|1977|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The second primary form of the slippery slope argument is that of the "Empirical" or "Psychological" argument.&lt;ref name="Lewis2007p197" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VanderBurg1991p43" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VoluntaryEuthanasiaStanford" /&gt; The empirical version does not rely on a logical connection between A and B, but instead argues that an acceptance of A will, in time, lead to an acceptance of B.&lt;ref name="Lewis2007p197" /&gt; The process is not a logical necessity, but one which will be followed through a process of moral change.&lt;ref name="VanderBurg1991p51"&gt;{{harvnb|van der Burg|1991|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enoch describes the application of this form of the argument thus:

{{Quote|"Once we allow voluntary euthanasia, she argues, we may (or will) fail to make the crucial distinction, and then we will make the morally unacceptable outcome of allowing involuntary euthanasia; or perhaps even though we may make the relevant distinction, we will not act accordingly for some reason (perhaps a political reason, or a reason that has to do with weakness of will, or some other reason)."|David Enoch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Enoch|first=David|title=Once You Start Using Slippery Slope Arguments, You're on a Very Slippery Slope|journal=Oxford Journal of Legal Studies|year=2001|volume=21|issue=4|page=631 |doi=10.1093/ojls/21.4.629}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Glover, however, notes that this line of argument requires good evidence that this direction will be followed, as not all boundaries are thus pushed.&lt;ref name="Glover1977p167"&gt;{{harvnb|Glover|1977|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, it has been argued that in employing the slippery slope there can be an "implicit concession", as it starts from the assumption that the initial practice is acceptable – even though it will lead to unacceptable outcomes in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schauer|first=Frederick|title=Slippery slopes|journal=[[Harvard Law Review]]|year=1985|volume=99|issue=2|pages=368–369 |jstor=1341127 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, van der Burg argues that this not a useful concession, as the outcomes are intended to make it clear that the initial practice was not justifiable after all.&lt;ref name="VanderBurg1991p42"&gt;{{harvnb|van der Burg|1991|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response to the logical versions==

Countering the first logical version of the slippery slope argument, it is argued that the different types of euthanasia are sufficiently distinct that it is not "logically inconsistent" to support one version while denying the others. It is possible to support, for example, voluntary euthanasia while denying non-voluntary euthanasia, just as it is possible to support both – the distinction comes not from a logical inconsistency, but a choice of principles, such that a focus on euthanasia as personal choice will support voluntary euthanasia but not non-voluntary euthanasia, while a focus on a person's "best interests" may allow for the support of both.&lt;ref name="VoluntaryEuthanasiaStanford" /&gt; From a more practical perspective, another option when faced with the logical version of the argument is to simply accept the consequences. This was the response by Duff and Campbell to Sherlock. Rather than arguing that their premises were flawed, they argued that Sherlock was correct: their criteria could also be applied to older children, and thus it should be applied, as it was "probably the most caring policy generally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=A G M|author2=Duff, R S|title=Author's response to Richard Sherlock's commentary|journal=[[Journal of Medical Ethics]]|date=September 1979|volume=5|issue=3|page=141|pmc=1154743 |doi=10.1136/jme.5.3.141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In responding to the "arbitrary line" version of the slippery slope argument, it is argued that the stance relies on the "[[Sorites paradox|paradox of the heap]]", and that it is possible to draw a line between the acceptable and unacceptable alternatives.&lt;ref name="Glover 1977 page=166"/&gt; Furthermore, in the case of euthanasia, it is possible to draw hard lines between different types of practices. For example, there is a clear distinction between voluntary and non-voluntary euthanasia, such that the arbitrary line approach cannot be applied.&lt;ref name="VoluntaryEuthanasiaStanford" /&gt;

==The empirical argument==

Glover argues that the empirical argument needs to be backed by evidence, as there are situations where we do not seem to push boundaries.&lt;ref name="Glover1977p167" /&gt; Generally, two examples are discussed – [[Action T4]], the Nazi euthanasia program in Germany between 1939 and 1941, and the [[Groningen Protocol]] in the Netherlands, which has allowed for non-voluntary euthanasia of severely deformed newborns.

Lewis notes that the focus has been on voluntary to non-voluntary euthanasia, rather than physician-assisted suicide to voluntary euthanasia, as there have been no instances of the latter: in jurisdictions where physician-assisted suicide have been legalised, there have been no moves to legalise voluntary euthanasia, while jurisdictions that have legalised voluntary euthanasia also allowed physician-assisted suicide at the same time.&lt;ref name="Lewis2007pp197-198"&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2007|pages=197–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Action T4===
[[File:Alkoven Schloss Hartheim 2005-08-18 3589.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Hartheim Euthanasia Centre]], where over 18,000 people were killed.]]
[[Leo Alexander]], in examining the events of the [[Holocaust]] during the [[Nuremberg Trials]], stated that the origins of the Nazi programs could be traced back to "small beginnings", and presented a slippery slope argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = Walter | year = 2000 | title = Historical Analogies, Slippery Sloped, and the Question of Euthanasia | url = | journal = [[Journal of Law, Medicine and Ethics]] | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 176–186 | doi=10.1111/j.1748-720x.2000.tb00008.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that Action T4 is not an example of the empirical slippery slope,&lt;ref name="VoluntaryEuthanasiaStanford" /&gt; as euthanasia was still a criminal act in Germany during that time, and there is "no record of the Nazi doctors either killing or assisting in the suicide of a patient who was suffering intolerably from a fatal illness".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pappas|1996|page=390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Euthanasia historian [[Ian Dowbiggin]] linked the Nazis' [[Action T4]] to the resistance in the West to involuntary euthanasia. He believes that the revulsion inspired by the Nazis led to some of the early advocates of euthanasia in all its forms in the U.S. and U.K. removing non-voluntary euthanasia from their proposed platforms.&lt;ref name="a_merciful_end"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Dowbiggin | first1 = Ian Robert | title = A merciful end: the euthanasia movement in modern America | year = 2002 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York  | isbn = 0-19-515443-6 | pages = {{Page needed|date=September 2010}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Groningen Protocol===
Non-voluntary euthanasia is sometimes cited as one of the possible outcomes of the [[slippery slope]] argument, in which it is claimed that permitting voluntary euthanasia to occur will lead to the support and legalization of non-voluntary and involuntary euthanasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Voluntary Euthanasia|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/euthanasia-voluntary/#Six|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=June 13, 2010|date=March 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies of the Netherlands after the introduction of voluntary euthanasia state that there was no evidence to support this claim&lt;ref name="Ryan-1998"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Ryan | first1 = C.J. | title = Pulling up the runaway: the effect of new evidence on euthanasia's slippery slope | journal = [[Journal of Medical Ethics]] | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 341–344 |date=October 1998 | doi = 10.1136/jme.24.5.341| pmid = 9800591 | pmc = 1377611 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/0140-6736(91)91241-L| last1 = van der Maas | first1 = P.J. | last2 = van Delden | first2 = J.J.M. | title = Euthanasia and other medical decisions concerning the end of life | journal = [[The Lancet]] | volume = 338 | issue = 8768 | pages = 669–674 | year = 1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while other studies state otherwise.&lt;ref name="Lindeboom" /&gt;

A study from the ''Jakobovits Center for Medical Ethics'' in [[Israel]] argued that a form of non-voluntary euthanasia, the [[Groningen Protocol]], has "potential to validate the slippery-slope argument against allowing euthanasia in selected populations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Jotkowitz | first1 = Alan | last2 = Glick | first2 = S | last3 = Gesundheit | first3 = B | title = A Case Against Justified Non-Voluntary Active Euthanasia (The Groningen Protocol) | journal = The American Journal of Bioethics | year = 2008 | volume = 8 | issue = 11 | page = 25 | doi = 10.1080/15265160802513085 | issn = 1526-5161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anesthesiologist William Lanier says that the "ongoing evolution of euthanasia law in the Netherlands" is evidence that a slippery slope is "playing out in real time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Lanier | first = William| last2 = Berge| first2 = K.

A 1999 study by Jochemsen and Keown from the Dutch Christan Lindeboom Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lindeboominstituut.nl/sitemanager.asp?pid=105 |title=Lindeboom Instituut Studiecentrum voor medische ethiek vanuit de christelijke levensbeschouwing |publisher=www.lindeboominstituut.nl |accessdate=2011-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724160513/http://www.lindeboominstituut.nl/sitemanager.asp?pid=105 |archive-date=2011-07-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the peer reviewed ''Journal of Medical Ethics'', argued that euthanasia in the Netherlands is not well-controlled and that there is still a significant percentage of cases of euthanasia practiced illegally.&lt;ref name="Lindeboom"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jochemsen H, Keown J |title=Voluntary euthanasia under control?

(1996-1997). "The Slippery Slope: The Dutch Example", ''[[Duquesne Law Review]], 35:1. p427.&lt;/ref&gt;

An October 2007 study, published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, found that "rates of assisted dying in Oregon and in the Netherlands showed no evidence of heightened risk for the elderly, women, the uninsured (inapplicable in the Netherlands, where all are insured), people with low educational status, the poor, the physically disabled or chronically ill, minors, people with psychiatric illnesses including depression, or racial or ethnic minorities, compared with background populations. The only group with a heightened risk was people with AIDS."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Battin|first1=M|last2=van der Heide|first2=A|last3=Ganzini|first3=L|last4=van der Wal|first4=G|last5=Onwuteaka-Phillipsen|first5=B.D.|author-link1=Margaret Battin|title=Legal physician-assisted dying in Oregon and the Netherlands: evidence concerning the impact on patients in "vulnerable" groups.|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=October 2007|issue=10|pages= 591–7|doi=10.1136/jme.2007.022335|volume=33|pmc=2652799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 review study of euthanasia in the Netherlands concluded that no slippery slope effect has occurred,&lt;ref name="Rietjens-2009"/&gt; while another study of the same year found that abuse of the Dutch euthanasia system is rare.&lt;ref name="Norwood-2009"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Norwood | first1 = F. | last2 = Kimsma | first2 = G. | last3 = Battin | first3 = MP. | author-link3=Margaret Battin | title = Vulnerability and the 'slippery slope' at the end-of-life: a qualitative study of euthanasia, general practice and home death in The Netherlands. | journal = Fam Pract | volume = 26 | issue = 6 | pages = 472–80 |date=Dec 2009 | doi = 10.1093/fampra/cmp065 | pmid = 19828573 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, a study found that there is no evidence that legalizing assisted suicide will lead us down the slippery slope to involuntary euthanasia.&lt;ref name="Lesser-2010"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Lesser | first1 = H. | title = Should it be legal to assist suicide? | journal = J Eval Clin Pract | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 330–4 |date=Apr 2010 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2753.2010.01394.x | pmid = 20367858 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most critics rely predominantly on Dutch evidence of cases of "termination of life without an explicit request" as evidence for the slide from voluntary euthanasia to non-voluntary euthanasia.&lt;ref name="Lewis-2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; One commenter wrote that critics who rely on this slippery slope argument often omit two important elements, thereby using flawed logic.&lt;ref name="Lewis-2007"/&gt; First, the argument is only effective against legalization if it is legalization which causes the slippery slope; and secondly, it is only effective if it is used comparatively, to show that the slope is more slippery in the Netherlands than it is in jurisdictions which have not legalized assisted suicide or euthanasia;&lt;ref name="Lewis-2007"/&gt; since these questions have not been addressed by critics, little attention has been paid to available evidence on causation and comparability.

====Research review studies====
In the most recent review paper on euthanasia in the Netherlands, namely the 2009 paper entitled ''Two Decades of Research on Euthanasia from the Netherlands. What Have We Learnt and What Questions Remain?'' written by researchers from the Department of Public Health in the Netherlands, it was found that "public control and transparency of the practice of euthanasia is to a large extent possible" and that "[n]o slippery slope seems to have occurred".&lt;ref name="Rietjens-2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rietjens JA, van der Maas PJ, Onwuteaka-Philipsen BD, van Delden JJ, van der Heide A |title=Two Decades of Research on Euthanasia from the Netherlands.

#The frequency of ending of life without explicit patient request did not increase over the studied years;
#There is no evidence for a higher frequency of euthanasia, compared with background populations, among:
#*the [[old age|elderly]]
#*people with [[educational inequality|low educational status]]
#*the [[poverty|poor]]
#*the [[disability|physically disabled]] or [[chronically ill]]
#*[[Minor (law)|minors]]
#*people with [[psychiatric illness]]es including [[major depressive disorder|depression]]
#*racial or ethnic [[minority group|minorities]].&lt;ref name="Rietjens-2009"/&gt;

In 2010, 4050 persons died from euthanasia or from assisted suicide on request. According to research done by the [[Vrije Universiteit]] (Amsterdam), [[University Medical Center Utrecht]] and [[Statistics Netherlands]], and published in ''[[The Lancet]]'', this is not more than before the introduction of the "Termination of Life on Request and Assisted Suicide (Review Procedures) Act" in 2002. Both in the Netherlands and in Belgium, the number of termination of life without explicit request for terminally ill patients, decreased after the introduction of the legislation about the termination of life. In effect, the legislation did not lead to more cases of euthanasia and assisted suicide on request.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/2856077/euthanasiewet-leidde-niet-meer-euthanasie.html Euthanasiewet leidde niet tot meer euthanasie]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian Ferdinand Schiess''' [[Victoria Cross|VC]] (7 April 1856 &amp;ndash; 14 December 1884) was a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces. He died in poverty at just 28.

==Biography==

Schiess was born in [[Burgdorf, Switzerland|Burgdorf]], [[Switzerland]] on 7 April 1856, and spent time in an orphanage after his parents died. In 1870 he joined the [[French Army]] and fought in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Schiess later served in the [[Armée de l'Est]] and thus was interned in his home country when it surrendered there. He went to South Africa in 1877 and volunteered for the last [[Xhosa War]]. When the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] began the 22-years-old veteran was made a [[corporal]] in the [[Natal Native Contingent]] of the [[British Army]] in South Africa.&lt;ref name=SAM&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ernst|first1=F.|last2=Scheurer|first2=K.|title=HISTORY OF THE SWISS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA - SCHIESS, Christian Ferdinand|url=http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol093fe.html|website=The South African Military History Society|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 1879, at [[Rorke's Drift]], Natal, Corporal Schiess, in spite of having been wounded in the foot a few days previously, displayed great gallantry when the garrison had retired to the inner line of defence and the Zulus had occupied the wall of mealie bags which had been abandoned. He crept along the wall in order to dislodge one of the enemy and succeeded in killing him and two others before returning to the inner defences.&lt;ref name=VC&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24788|page=7148|date=2 December 1879 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Steward&gt;{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=Rupert|title=The book of the Victoria cross|year=1916|publisher=H. Rees|location=London|url=https://archive.org/stream/bookofvictoriacr00stewuoft#page/418/mode/2up|page=419}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Friederich Schless Memorial.JPG|thumb|left|Memorial plaque to ''Friederich'' Schiess at the Rorke's Drift Museum, Natal.]]
[[File:Lady butler defense rorkes drift.jpg|thumb|left|Lady Butler's version of Battle of Rorke's Drift.]]
In 1880 he was awarded the Victoria Cross by General [[Sir Garnet Wolseley]] for his services at Rorke's Drift. Schiess was the first man serving with a locally raised native unit to receive the Victoria Cross, the "British-only" rule being broken under political pressure, also being the first Swiss national to do so.&lt;ref name="SAM"/&gt;

After the volunteer forces were disbanded he failed to find work, even from British authorities. He briefly went to India but eventually returned to South Africa. In 1884, he was found on the streets of [[Cape Town]] suffering from exposure and malnutrition. The Royal Navy found him, gave him food, and offered him a passage to England on board the ''[[HMS Serapis (1866)|Serapis]]''. He accepted, but became ill during the voyage and died. His remains were buried at sea at approximately {{coord|13|00|S|07|24|W|region:XZ_type:landmark|name=Christian Ferdinand Schiess (burial at sea)}}.

It is unknown if there was a portrait of Corporal Schiess. According to some, in [[Elizabeth Thompson|Lady Butler]]'s painting ''[[The Defence of Rorke's Drift]]'' he is shown lying at left against the [[mealie]] bags.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==Victoria Cross==
The citation for Schiess's Victoria Cross was given as:

{{quote|For conspicuous gallantry in the defence of Rorke's Drift Post on the night of the 22nd January, 1879, when, in spite of his having been wounded in the foot a few days previously, he greatly distinguished himself when the Garrison were repulsing, with the bayonet, a series of desperate assaults made by the Zulus, and displayed great activity and devoted gallantry throughout the defence. On one occasion when the Garrison had retired to the inner line of defence, and the Zulus occupied the wall of mealie bags which had been abandoned, he crept along the wall, without any order, to dislodge a Zulu who was shooting better than usual and succeeded in killing him, and two others, before he, the Corporal, returned to the inner defence.&lt;ref name="VC"/&gt;}}

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the [[National Army Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nam.ac.uk/online-collection/image-zoom.php?img_ref=78088 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140614201100/http://www.nam.ac.uk/online-collection/image-zoom.php?img_ref=78088 |archivedate=14 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film portrayal==
In the 1964 film ''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]'', [[Dickie Owen]] portrays Schiess as a much older soldier than he was during the Battle of Rorke's Drift.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10421">'''Fragmentation''' in multicellular organisms is a form of asexual reproduction in which an organism is split into fragments. Each of these fragments develop into matured, fully grown individuals that are identical to their parents

The splitting may or may not be ''intentional'' – it may or may not occur due to man-made or natural damage by the environment or predators. This kind of organism may develop specific organs or zones that may be shed or easily broken off. If the splitting occurs without the prior preparation of the organism, both fragments must be able to [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] the complete organism for it to function as reproduction.

Fragmentation, also known as splitting, as a method of reproduction is seen in many organisms such as filamentous [[cyanobacteria]], [[mold]]s, [[lichen]]s, many plants, and animals such as [[sponge]]s, [[acoelomorpha|acoel flatworms]], some [[annelid worms]] and [[sea star]]s.

== Fragmentation in various organisms ==
Moulds, [[yeast]]s and [[mushroom]]s, all of which are part of the [[Fungi]] [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], produce tiny filaments called [[hypha]]e. These hyphae obtain food and nutrients from the body of other organisms to grow and fertilize. Then a piece of hyphae breaks off and grows into a new individual and the cycle continues.

Many [[lichen]]s produce specialized structures that can easily break away and disperse. These structures contain both the hyphae of the [[mycobiont]] and the algae([[phycobiont]]) (see [[soredia]] and [[isidia]]). Larger fragments of the thallus may break away when the lichen dries or due to mechanical disturbances(see the section on [[Lichen#Reproduction and dispersal|reproduction in lichens]]).

==Plants==
Fragmentation is a very common type of [[vegetative reproduction]] in [[plants]]. Many [[trees]], [[shrub]]s, nonwoody [[Perennial plant|perennials]], and [[fern]]s form [[clonal colony|clonal colonies]] by producing new rooted shoots by [[rhizomes]] or [[stolons]], which increases the diameter of the colony. If a rooted [[shoot]] becomes detached from the colony, then fragmentation has occurred. There are several other mechanisms of natural fragmentation in plants.

*Production of specialized reproductive structures: A few plants produce [[adventitious]] plantlets on their leaves, which drop off and form independent plants, e.g. ''[[Tolmiea menziesii]]'' and ''[[Kalanchoe daigremontiana]]''. Others produce organs like [[bulbil]]s and [[turion (botany)|turion]]s.
*Easily lost parts that have high potential to grow into a complete plant: Some woody plants like the [[willow]] naturally shed twigs. This is termed [[cladoptosis]]. The lost twigs may form roots in a suitable environment to establish a new plant. River currents often tear off branch fragments from certain cottonwood species growing on riverbanks. Fragments reaching suitable environments can root and establish new plants.&lt;ref&gt;Rood, S.B., Kalischuk, M.L., and Braatne, J.H. 2003. Branch propagation, not cladoptosis, permits dispersive, clonal reproduction of [[riparian cottonwood]]s. ''Forest Ecology and Management'' 186: 227–242. [http://eco.nefu.edu.cn/person/ljz/aticle/Branch%20propagation,%20not%20cladoptosis,%20permits%20dispersive,%20clonal%20reproduction%20of%20riparian%20cottonwoods.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[cactus|cacti]] and other plants have jointed stems. When a stem segment, called a pad, falls off, it can root and form a new plant. Leaves of some plants readily root when they fall off, e.g. ''[[Sedum]]'' and ''[[Echeveria]]''.
* Fragmentation is observed in [[nonvascular plants]] as well, for example, in liverworts and mosses. Small pieces of moss "stems" or "leaves" are often scattered by the wind, water or animals. If a moss fragment reaches a suitable environment, it can establish a new plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbs.auckland.ac.nz/info/schools/nzplants/moss_asexual.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927220618/http://www.sbs.auckland.ac.nz/info/schools/nzplants/moss_asexual.htm |archivedate=2006-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also produce [[gemma (botany)|gemmae]], for example in the splash-cups of ''[[Marchantia polymorpha]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Equihua |first1=Clementina |title=Diseminación de yemas en Marchantia polymorpha L. (Hepaticae) |journal=Cryptogamie, Bryologie, Lichenologie |date=1987| volume=8| issue=3| page=199-217 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; that are easily broken off and distributed.

People use fragmentation to artificially propagate many plants via [[Division (horticulture)|division]], [[layering]], [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]], [[grafting]], [[micropropagation]] and [[storage organ]]s, such as [[bulb]]s, [[corm]]s, [[tuber]]s and [[rhizome]]s.

==Animals==
Animals like [[sponges]] and [[coral]] colonies naturally fragment and reproduce. Many species of [[annelids]] and flat worms reproduce by this method.

When the splitting occurs due to specific developmental changes, the terms architomy, paratomy and [[budding]] are used. In '''architomy''' the animal splits at a particular point and the two fragments regenerate the missing organs and tissues. The splitting is not preceded by the development of the tissues to be lost. Prior to splitting, the animal may develop furrows at the zone of splitting. The headless fragment has to regenerate a complete head.

In '''[[paratomy]]''', the split occurs perpendicular to the [[antero-posteriorly|antero-posterior axis]] and the split is preceded by the "pregeneration" of the anterior structures in the posterior portion. The two organisms have their body axis aligned i.e. they develop in a head to tail fashion. Budding can be considered to be similar to paratomy except that the body axes need not be aligned: the new head may grow toward the side or even point backward (e.g. ''[[Convolutriloba retrogemma]]'' an [[acoela|acoel]] flat worm).&lt;ref name=Akesson2001&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1046/j.1463-6395.2001.00084.x| issn = 1463-6395| volume = 82| issue = 3| pages = 231–239| last = Åkesson| first = Bertil|author2=Robert Gschwentner |author3=Jan Hendelberg |author4=Peter Ladurner |author5=Johann Müller |author6=Reinhard Rieger | title = Fission in Convolutriloba longifissura: asexual reproduction in acoelous turbellarians revisited| journal = Acta Zoologica| accessdate = 2011-07-13| date = 2001-12-01| url = http://homepage.uibk.ac.at/~c719135/pdf/Akesson-Gschwentner-2001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1002/bdrc.20135| issn = 1542-9768| volume = 84| issue = 4| pages = 257–264| last = Egger| first = Bernhard| title = Regeneration: rewarding, but potentially risky| journal = Birth Defects Research.

Within the [[reef aquarium]] hobby, enthusiasts regularly fragment [[coral]]s for a multitude of purposes including shape control; selling to, trading with, or sharing with others; regrowth experiments; and minimizing damage to natural coral reefs. Both hard and soft corals can be fragmented. [[Genera]] that have shown to be highly tolerant of fragmentation include ''[[Acropora]]'', ''[[Montipora]]'', ''[[Pocillopora]]'', ''[[Euphyllia]]'', and ''[[Caulastraea]]'' among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reefkeeping.com/issues/2002-06/ac/feature/ |title=Coral fragmentation: Not just for beginners |author=Calfo, Anthony |year=2008 |work=Reefkeeping Magazine |publisher=Reef Central |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[sea anemone]]s reproduce through fragmentation. There are a variety of methods including '''longitudinal fission''', where the original anemone splits across the middle, forming two equal-sized anemones, and '''basal laceration''', in which small parts of the animal split from the base and form a new anemone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mba.ac.uk/fact-sheet-sea-anemones |title=Fact Sheet: Sea Anemones |work=[[Marine Biological Association]] |accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Echinoderms ===
In [[echinoderm]]s, the process is usually known as '''fissiparity''' (a term also used infrequently for [[Fission (biology)|fission]] in general). Some species can intentionally reproduce in this manner through [[autotomy]]. This method is more common during the larval stages.&lt;ref name="skold"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Helen Nilsson Sköld |author2=Matthias Obst |author3=Mattias Sköld |author4=Bertil Åkesson |editor1=Baruch Rinkevich |editor2=Valeria Matranga |title =Stem Cells in Marine Organisms|chapter =Stem Cells in Asexual Reproduction of Marine Invertebrates|publisher =Springer|year =2009|page=125|isbn = 978-90-481-2766-5|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=-eP2p0VF6VcC&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=Fissiparity&amp;pg=PA125#v=onepage&amp;q=Fissiparity&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantage of this process of reproduction ==
As this process is a form of asexual reproduction, it does not produce [[genetic diversity]] in the offspring. Therefore, these are more vulnerable to changing environments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3281">'''Gaius Calpurnius Aviola''' was a [[Roman senate|senator]] of the [[Roman Empire]]. He was ''[[Roman consul|suffect consul]]'' in AD 24 with [[Publius Cornelius Lentulus Scipio]] as his colleague.&lt;ref&gt;Alison E. Cooley, ''The Cambridge Manual of Latin Epigraphy'' (Cambridge: University Press, 2012), p. 459&lt;/ref&gt; Aviola is also recorded as being governor of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] in 37/38.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Syme, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/298283 "Piso Frugi and Crassus Frugi"], ''[[Journal of Roman Studies]]'', '''50''' (1960), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Aviola has been identified as the father of [[Manius Acilius Aviola (consul AD 54)|Manius Acilius Aviola]], consul in 54.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gallivan, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4435641 "Who Was Acilius?"], ''[[Historia: Zeitschrift für Alte Geschichte]]'', '''27''' (1978), p. 622&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on Aviola's name, [[Ronald Syme]] argues that he was "presumably an Acilius Aviola adopted by a [[Calpurnius Piso|C. Calpurnius Piso]]"; Olli Salomies disagrees, believing the adoptive parent was a "C. Calpurnius without a cognomen (e.g. a son of C. Calpurnius, curule and plebeian aedile in 23 BC)".&lt;ref&gt; Salomies, ''Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature in the Roman Empire'', (Helsinski: Societas Scientiarum Fenica, 1992), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Yet both identify the adoptee as the [[praetor]]ian [[Legatus|legate]] or governor of [[Gallia Lugdunensis]] in AD 21, who suppressed a revolt by the [[Andecavi]] in Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', III.41.1&lt;/ref&gt; Syme notes that "praetorian governorships tend to proceed to the consulate", yet this Acilius Aviola vanishes from history soon after; unless he had died prematurely after his governorship, it would make sense that upon being adopted by a Gaius Calpurnius Piso he changed his name and continued his career under it.

If they are identical, then Aviola is the subject of a tale recorded by [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Valerius Maximus]]. Assumed to be dead, his body was set on top of a funeral pyre, which was then lit. Whereupon he is said to have come to life again, but due to the intensity of the flames, Aviola could not be rescued, and burned to death. This must have occurred prior to the death of [[Tiberius]] in AD 37, since Valerius Maximus published his work during that emperor's reign.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, vii. 52. 53; [[Valerius Maximus]], i. 8. § 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giovanni d'Alemagna''' (ca. 1411 - died 1450) was a German painter, active in Italy, who collaborated with his brother-in-law [[Antonio Vivarini]] on various important religious paintings in Venice and Padua.

Although it is difficult to distinguish the two artists' contributions, Giovanni is associated with the St Jerome (1444), which carries the signature 'Johannes'. This painting suggests that Giovanni's work was generally flatter and more decorative than Antonio's more naturalistic style.

Giovanni d'Alemagna and Antonio Vivarini ran an extremely well organized shop in Venice that specialized in multi-tiered, multi-paneled altarpieces and fanciful Gothic frames, which they subcontracted to various woodworkers.

In 1446 Giovanni and Antonio signed and dated the triptych representing the Madonna and Child with Saints for the wall behind the officers' bench of the recently expanded meeting room of the Scuola della Carità (now part of the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]]). Resembling an altarpiece but functioning as an inducement to good decision making, this monumental painting shows the four doctors of the Church (Sts Gregory and Jerome at the left, Ambrose and Augustine at the right) in a courtyard around a massive Madonna and Child. The Virgin's celestial court is vividly rendered with marbled pink and grey architecture, rich deep colours, costly robes, and lovingly observed plant life.

In 1448 he started working, together with Vivarini and [[Andrea Mantegna]], in the decoration of the [[Ovetari Chapel]] in Padua, but died soon afterwards.

'''Health technology assessment''' is the systematic evaluation of the properties and effects of a [[health technology]], addressing the direct and intended effects of this technology, as well as its indirect and [[unintended consequences]], and aimed mainly at informing decision making regarding health technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=INAHTA (International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment) | title=HTA Glossary.net | url=http://htaglossary.net/health+technology+assessment+%28HTA%29 | date=Jun 1, 2015 | publisher=INAHTA}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has other definitions including "a method of evidence synthesis that considers evidence regarding clinical effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness and, when broadly applied, includes social, ethical, and legal aspects of the use of health technologies. The precise balance of these inputs depends on the purpose of each individual HTA. A major use of HTAs is in informing reimbursement and coverage decisions by [[Health insurance|insurers]] and national health systems, in which case HTAs should include benefit-harm assessment and economic evaluation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Luce BR, etal | title=. EBM, HTA, and CER: clearing the confusion | journal=Milbank Q | date=2010 | volume=88 | pages=256–76 | pmid=20579285 | pmc=2980346 | issue=2 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2010.00598.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and "a multidisciplinary process that summarises information about the medical, social, economic and ethical issues related to the use of a health technology in a systematic, transparent, unbiased, robust manner. Its aim is to inform the formulation of safe, effective, [[health policies]] that are patient focused and seek to achieve best value. Despite its policy goals, HTA must always be firmly rooted in research and the scientific method".&lt;ref&gt;EUnetHTA (European network for Health Technology Assessment) https://www.eunethta.eu/about-eunethta/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Health technology assessment is intended to provide a bridge between the world of research and the world of decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Battista, RN: ''The scientific basis of health services''. BMJ Publishing Group, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; HTA is an active field internationally and has seen continued growth fostered by the need to support management, clinical, and policy decisions. It has also been advanced by the evolution of evaluative methods in the social and applied sciences, including [[clinical epidemiology]] and [[Health economics|health economics]]. Health policy decisions are becoming increasingly important as the opportunity costs from making wrong decisions continue to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Menon D.| title=The internationalization of heath technology assessment | journal=IJTAHC | date=1996 | volume=12 | pages=45–51 | pmid=8690561 | last2=Marshall | first2=D | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; HTA is now also used in assessment of innovative medical technologies like telemedicine e.g. by use of the [[Model for assessment of telemedicine]] (MAST).

Health technology can be defined broadly as:
{{Quote|Any intervention that may be used to promote health, to prevent, diagnose or treat disease or for rehabilitation or long-term care. This includes the pharmaceuticals, devices, procedures and organizational systems used in health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=INAHTA (International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment). | title=HTA glossary. | url=http://htaglossary.net/tiki-index.php?page=health%20technology | date=Oct 8, 2013 | publisher=HTAi}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
The growth of HTA internationally can be seen in the expanding membership of the International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA), a non-profit umbrella organization established in 1993. Organizations and individuals involved in HTA research are also affiliated with societies such as the international societies HTAi and the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research |url=https://www.ispor.org |website=ISPOR |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An international Masters program in health technology assessment and management, ULYSSES, is also offered.

==Health Technology Assessment by country==
===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom's [[National Institute for Health Research]] runs several research programmes which may be viewed as falling into the realm of Health Technology Assessment. Of particular note is the NIHR Health Technology Assessment programme, its longest running, which undertakes both conventional HTA in the form of Evidence Synthesis and modelling, and evidence generation with a large portfolio of pragmatic [[Randomized controlled trial|RCTs]] and [[Cohort study|cohort studies]].

Also in the UK, the Multidisciplinary Assessment of Technology Centre for Healthcare carries out HTA in collaboration with the health service, the NHS and various industrial partners.  MATCH is organised into four themes addressing key HTA topics including Health Economics, Tools for Industry, User Needs and Procurement and Supply chain.

'''Henry Waters Taft''' (May 27, 1859 – August 11, 1945) was an American lawyer and author. He was the son of [[Alphonso Taft|Alphonso]] and brother of President [[William Howard Taft]]. A renowned [[antitrust]] lawyer, he was a [[Partner (business rank)|name partner]] at [[Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft]].

==Biography==
He graduated from Yale in 1880 with a BA, where he was a member of [[Skull and Bones]] and commencement orator of the class of 1880.&lt;ref name="Yaleobit194546"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mssa.library.yale.edu/obituary_record/1925_1952/1945-46.pdf | title=OBITUARY RECORD OF GRADUATES OF YALE UNIVERSITY DECEASED DURING THE YEAR 1945-1946 | publisher=Yale University | date=January 1, 1947 | accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} Taft also studied at Cincinnati and Columbia Law Schools. He received an honorary MA from [[Yale]] in 1905.

In 1882, he was admitted to the bar, and began the practice of law in [[Ohio]]. Shortly afterward, he joined Strong &amp; Cadwalader, in New York City, later [[Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft]]. He also became counsel to the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad. After building up a reputation as a lawyer, Taft decided to run for Justice of the [[New York Supreme Court]]. He was defeated. Two years later, he was offered the position by [[Theodore Roosevelt]], but he declined. The following year, he was appointed to the Charter Revision Commission to revise charter of Greater New York. From 1905 to January 1907, he was a special assistant to [[United States Attorney General|Attorneys General]] [[William H. Moody]] and [[Charles Joseph Bonaparte]] to investigate and prosecute the [[Tobacco Trust]]. During the trial, Taft pushed for the Tobacco Trust to release certain books, which they refused to submit as evidence. From 1917 to 1919, he was Chairman of the Permanent Legal Advisory Board for Greater New York. He also served on the Commission on Reorganisation of the New York State Government, from 1925 to 1926. In 1926, he was appointed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court. Taft became one of the most noted lawyers in New York. 

During the annual convention of the American Bar Association, the delegates made a trip to [[Bohemian Grove]]. Taft who was among them said, 'There among the giant redwoods the spirit that is San Francisco was revealed to the visitors. The amalgamation of San Francisco Society through its love of beauty, through it cultural purpose has no duplicate in America and the Bohemian Club which unites the world of big business and the world of fine art, literature and cultural ideals could only exist in a community such as this.' Taft said his brother, William Howard Taft, was also very fond of the [[Bohemian Club]].

He was a Trustee of the [[Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York|Mutual Life Insurance Company]] and the [[Central Savings Bank]].

Taft was a member of the [[New York City Board of Education]], from 1896 to 1900; Trustee of the [[City College of New York|College of the City of New York]], from 1903 to 1905; Trustee of the [[New York Public Library]], from 1908 to 1919; President of the Council of [[University Settlement House]], from 1917 to 1919; member of the Advisory Committee to investigate public schools of New York City, in 1931; member of the Committee on Cost of Public Education, in 1933; and President of the [[League for Political Education]], from 1919 to 1935.

He was affiliated with the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] and was a delegate to the [[Republican National Convention]], in 1920 and 1924. Taft was a supporter of the [[League of Nations]], and wrote several articles on the organisation for the ''[[New York Times]]''. He also wrote for other newspapers, including ''[[The Times]]''.

Taft was Chairman of the Advisory Board of [[The Salvation Army]] for New York City, from 1920 to 1940.

===Death===
Taft died in New York City on August 11, 1945. He had been in the St. Luke's Hospital for fourteen weeks as the result of a hip injury received after a fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Died |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,797689,00.html |quote=Henry Waters Taft, 86, brother of the late President, onetime tobacco trustbuster under Theodore Roosevelt; after a hip injury; in Manhattan.

He began his artistic studies in [[Vilnius]] with [[Kanuty Rusiecki]].&lt;ref name="N"&gt;[https://nekropole.info/lv/person/view?id=3103127 Biographical notes] @ Nekropole.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Kazimierz, he participated in the [[January Uprising]]. His brother was exiled to [[Siberia]] for six years, but he was able to escape to France and settled in [[Perpignan]], where he initially supported himself by working as a construction draftsman for a railway company.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[http://www.agraart.pl/nowe/artists/alchimowicz-hiacynt-polska-agra-art-aukcje-obrazy-antyki.html Biographical notes] @ AgraArt.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872, when the construction work ended, he resumed his studies. In 1876, he became a drawing teacher at the Polytechnic School and the women's lyceum.&lt;ref name="N" /&gt; Later, he spent some time studying in Paris, where he made the acquaintance of [[Michał Elwiro Andriolli]], who helped him obtain work doing some illustrations. In 1892, he was awarded the [[Ordre des Palmes Académiques]].&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

He exhibited in Paris and throughout southern France. As of 1897, he was still known to be living in Perpignan.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; He apparently never returned to Poland, although his works were exhibited there in 1901 and 1904.

{{Other uses|Incontinence (disambiguation)}}
'''Incontinence''' ("a want of continence or self-restraint") is often used by philosophers to translate the Greek term [[Akrasia]] (ἀκρασία). Used to refer to a lacking in moderation or self-control, especially related to sexual desire,&lt;ref&gt;dictionary.com – [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/incontinence incontinence]&lt;/ref&gt; incontinence may also be called '''wantonness'''.

==Aristotle==
[[Aristotle]] devoted book VII of the [[Nicomachean Ethics]] to the discussion of continence and incontinence, having previously linked the latter both to [[Spendthrift|prodigality]] in its effects, and to those dominated by irrational feeling in its failure to obey knowledge of the good:&lt;ref&gt;J. A. K. Thompson trans, ''The Ethics of Aristotle'' (1976) pp. 142, 66, and 89&lt;/ref&gt; a case of knowing [[virtue]], but not having habituated it to control [[Passion (emotion)|passion]]. 

Aristotle considered one could be incontinent with respect to money or temper or glory, but that its core relation was to bodily enjoyment.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 235-9&lt;/ref&gt; Its causes could be weakness of will, or an impetuous refusal to think.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he did not consider it a vice, because it is not so much a product of moral choice, but instead, a failure to act on one's better knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 244-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later developments==

For Augustine, incontinence was not so much a problem of knowledge (knowing but not acting) but of the [[Will (philosophy)|will]]: he considered it a matter of everyday experience that men incontinently choose lesser over greater goods.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Mitcham, ''Thinking Through Technology'' (1994) p. 263-4&lt;/ref&gt;

In the structural division of [[Inferno (Dante)|Dante's ''Inferno'']], incontinence is the sin punished in the second through fifth circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Durling|first1=Robert M.|last2=Martinez|first2=Ronald L.|page=178|title=Inferno|series=The Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri|volume=1|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1996|isbn=9780195087444}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mutual incontinence of lust was for Dante the lightest of the deadly sins,&lt;ref&gt;Dante, p. 101-2&lt;/ref&gt; even if its lack of self-control would open the road to deeper layers of Hell.

Akrasia appeared later as a character in Spenser's [[The Faerie Queene]], representing the incontinence of lust, followed in the next canto by a study of that of anger;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Spenser]], ''The Fairie Queen'' (1978) p. lxiv&lt;/ref&gt; and as late as [[Jane Austen]] the [[sensibility]] of such figures as [[Marianne Dashwood]] would be treated as a form of (spiritual) incontinence.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Harman, ''Jane's Fame'' (2007) p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

With the triumph of [[Romanticism]], however, the incontinent choice of feeling over reason became increasingly valorised in Western culture.&lt;ref&gt;Mitcham, p. 265–56&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Blake|Blake]] wrote that "those who restrain desire, do so because theirs is weak enough to be restrained".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in M. H. Abrams, ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' (1971) p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Encouraged by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], there was a rise of what [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] would describe as "an ''abandon'' (ακρατεια)...a state of mind in which [[antinomianism]] is accepted – consciously or unconsciously, in theory or in practice – as a substitute for creativeness".&lt;ref&gt;Arnold J. Toynbee, ''[[A Study of History]]'' (1939) v5 p. 377 and p. 399&lt;/ref&gt;

A peak of such acrasia was perhaps reached in the 1960s cult of letting it all hang out – of breakdown, acting out and emotional self-indulgence and drama.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Diski, ''The Sixties'' (2009) p. 120-1&lt;/ref&gt; Partly in reaction, the proponents of [[emotional intelligence]] would look back to Aristotle in the search for impulse control and [[Gratification|delayed gratification]]&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (1996) pp. 80–83 and p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt; – to his dictum that "a person is called continent or incontinent according as his reason is or is not in control".&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intraparenchymal hemorrhage''' ('''IPH''') is one form of [[intracerebral bleeding]] in which there is bleeding within brain [[parenchyma]]. The other form is [[intraventricular hemorrhage]] (IVH).

Intraparenchymal hemorrhage accounts for approx. 8-13% of all [[stroke]]s and results from a wide spectrum of disorders. It is more likely to result in [[death]] or major [[disability]] than [[ischemic stroke]] or [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]], and therefore constitutes an immediate [[medical emergency]]. Intracerebral hemorrhages and accompanying [[edema]] may disrupt or compress adjacent [[brain tissue]], leading to neurological dysfunction. Substantial displacement of brain parenchyma may cause elevation of [[intracranial pressure]] (ICP) and potentially fatal [[Herniation (brain)|herniation syndromes]].

==Signs and symptoms==

Clinical manifestations of intraparenchymal hemorrhage are determined by the size and location of hemorrhage, but may include the following:{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

* Hypertension, [[fever]], or [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s
* [[Nuchal rigidity]]
* Subhyaloid retinal hemorrhages
* [[Altered level of consciousness]]
* [[Anisocoria]], [[nystagmus]]
* Focal neurological deficits
* [[Putamen]] - Contralateral [[hemiparesis]], contralateral sensory loss, contralateral conjugate gaze paresis, [[homonymous hemianopsia]], [[aphasia]], neglect, or [[apraxia]]
* [[Thalamus]] - Contralateral sensory loss, contralateral hemiparesis, gaze paresis, homonymous hemianopia, [[miosis]], aphasia, or confusion
* Lobar - Contralateral hemiparesis or sensory loss, contralateral conjugate gaze paresis, homonymous hemianopia, [[abulia]], aphasia, neglect, or apraxia
* [[Caudate nucleus]] - Contralateral hemiparesis, contralateral conjugate gaze paresis, or confusion
* [[Brain stem]] - [[Tetraparesis]], facial weakness, decreased level of consciousness, gaze paresis, ocular bobbing, miosis, or [[autonomic instability]]
* [[Cerebellum]] - [[Ataxia]], usually beginning in the trunk, ipsilateral facial weakness, ipsilateral sensory loss, gaze paresis, [[skew deviation]], miosis, or decreased level of consciousness

==Causes==
* [[Hypertension]]
* [[Arteriovenous malformation]]
* Aneurysm rupture
* [[Cerebral amyloid angiopathy]]
* Intracranial neoplasm
* [[Coagulopathy]]
* Hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic [[stroke]]
* Cerebral venous thrombosis
* Sympathomimetic drug abuse
* [[Moyamoya disease]]
* [[Sickle cell disease]]
* Eclampsia or postpartum vasculopathy
* Infection
* [[Vasculitis]]
* Neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage
* Trauma

In younger patients, vascular malformations, specifically AVMs and [[cavernous angioma]]s are more common causes for hemorrhage. In addition, venous malformations are associated with hemorrhage.

In the elderly population, amyloid angiopathy is associated with [[cerebral infarct]]s as well as hemorrhage in superficial locations, rather than deep white matter or basal ganglia. These are usually described as "lobar". These bleedings are not associated with systemic amyloidosis.

Hemorrhagic neoplasms are more complex, heterogeneous bleeds often with associated edema. These hemorrhages are related to tumor necrosis, [[vascular invasion]] and neovascularity. [[Glioblastoma]]s are the most common primary malignancies to hemorrhage while [[Thyroid cancer|thyroid]], [[renal cell carcinoma]], [[melanoma]], and [[lung cancer]] are the most common causes of hemorrhage from metastatic disease.

Other causes of intraparenchymal hemorrhage include hemorrhagic transformation of infarction which is usually in a classic vascular distribution and is seen in approximately 24 to 48 hours following the ischemic event. This hemorrhage rarely extends into the ventricular system.

==Pathophysiology==

Nontraumatic intraparenchymal hemorrhage most commonly results from hypertensive damage to [[blood vessel]] walls e.g.:
- [[hypertension]]
- [[eclampsia]]
- [[drug abuse]],
but it also may be due to [[Autoregulation|autoregulatory]] dysfunction with excessive cerebral blood flow e.g.:
- [[reperfusion injury]]
- hemorrhagic transformation
- cold exposure
- rupture of an [[aneurysm]] or [[arteriovenous malformation]] (AVM)
- arteriopathy (e.g. [[cerebral amyloid angiopathy]], [[Moyamoya disease|moyamoya]])
- altered [[hemostasis]] (e.g. [[thrombolysis]], [[anticoagulation]], [[bleeding diathesis]])
- hemorrhagic necrosis (e.g. [[tumor]], [[infection]])
- venous outflow obstruction (e.g. [[cerebral venous sinus thrombosis]]).
Nonpenetrating and penetrating cranial trauma can also be common causes of intracerebral hemorrhage.

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:mri041a2.jpg|thumb|Intraparenchymal hemorrhage]]
[[Image:mri041b2.jpg|left|thumb| CT-scan of intraparenchymal hemorrhage]]

'''Computed tomography (CT scan)''': A CT scan may be normal if it is done soon after the onset of symptoms. A CT scan is the best test to look for bleeding in or around your brain. In some hospitals, a perfusion CT scan may be done to see where the blood is flowing and not flowing in your brain. 

'''Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan)''': A special MRI technique ([[diffusion MRI]]) may show evidence of an ischemic stroke within minutes of symptom onset. In some hospitals, a perfusion MRI scan may be done to see where the blood is flowing and not flowing in your brain.

'''Angiogram''': a test that looks at the blood vessels that feed the brain. An [[angiogram]] will show whether the blood vessel is blocked by a clot, the blood vessel is narrowed, or if there is an abnormality of a blood vessel known as an aneurysm.

'''Carotid duplex''': A [[carotid duplex]] is an ultrasound study that assesses whether or not you have atherosclerosis (narrowing) of the carotid arteries. These arteries are the large blood vessels in your neck that feed your brain. 

'''Transcranial Doppler (TCD)''': Transcranial Doppler is an ultrasound study that assesses whether or not you have [[atherosclerosis]] (narrowing) of the blood vessels inside of your brain. It can also be used to see if you have emboli (blood clots) in your blood vessels.

==Treatment==

Intracerebral hemorrhages is a severe condition requiring prompt medical attention. Treatment goals include lifesaving interventions, supportive measures, and control of symptoms. Treatment depends on the location, extent, and cause of the bleeding. Often, treatment can reverse the damage that has been done.

A [[craniotomy]] is sometimes done to remove blood, abnormal blood vessels, or a tumor. Medications may be used to reduce swelling, prevent [[seizure]]s, lower [[blood pressure]], and control pain.

[[File:Jacob II Bernoulli.jpeg|thumb|Jakob II Bernoulli.]]
'''Jakob II Bernoulli''' (17 October 1759 in [[Basel]] &amp;ndash; 3 July 1789 in [[Saint Petersburg]]), younger brother of [[Johann III Bernoulli]]. Having finished his literary studies, he was, according to custom, sent to Neuchâtel to learn French. On his return, he graduated in law. This study, however, did not check his hereditary taste for geometry. The early lessons which he had received from his father were continued by his uncle [[Daniel Bernoulli|Daniel]], and such was his progress that at the age of twenty-one he was called to undertake the duties of the chair of experimental physics{{cn|reason=contradicts a source|date=May 2016}}, which his uncle’s advanced years rendered him unable to discharge. He afterwards accepted the situation of secretary to count de Brenner, which afforded him an opportunity of seeing Germany and Italy. In Italy, he formed a friendship with Lorgna, professor of mathematics at Verona, and one of the founders of the Società Italiana for the encouragement of the sciences. He was also made corresponding member of the royal society of Turin; and, while residing at Venice, he was, through the friendly representation of [[Nicolaus von Fuss]], admitted into the academy of St Petersburg. In 1788, he was named one of its mathematical professors.

He drowned while bathing in the [[Neva River|Neva]] in July 1789, a few months after his marriage with a granddaughter of [[Leonhard Euler]].

Several of his papers are contained in the first six volumes of ''Nova Acta Academiae Scientiarum Imperialis Petropolitanae'', in the ''Acta Helvetica'', in the ''Memoirs of the Academies of Berlin and Turin'', and in his brother Johann’s publications. He also published separately some juridical and physical theses, and a German translation of ''Mémoires du philosophe de Merian''.

He was one of the last notable members of the [[Bernoulli family]].

[[File:Last Enemy ASF.jpg|thumb|right|"Last Enemy" was originally published in the August 1950 issue of ''Astounding Science Fiction'']]
"'''Last Enemy'''" is a [[science fiction]] [[short story]] written by [[H. Beam Piper]], and is a part of his [[H. Beam Piper#Paratime|Paratime]] series. The title is a reference to [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] 15:26, “The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.” (KJV)

It made its first appearance in August 1950, in ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' magazine (now ''Analog'').

==Synopsis==
{{Plot|date=November 2015}}
The story begins at a dinner party given by Garnon of Roxor. The party is a voluntary discarnation feast, or suicide party. Garnon has been planning his discarnation for years, but has decided to proceed now, to assist in the scientific experiment of Dallona of Hadron. Immediately after Garnon’s death, a nearby sensitive, already placed in a hypnotic trance, begins to channel Garnon’s spirit, giving proof positive that disincarnate individuals are fully conscious, telepathically sensitive, capable of telepathic communication, and capable of exercising choice in the vehicle for their reincarnation.

But, Dallona’s discovery has important political considerations for the Second Level Akor-Neb society. The Statisticalist party believes that reincarnation is a statistically random event, and as such private property and wealth should be socialized to give everyone an equal opportunity. The Volitionalist party, on the other hand, believes that everyone reincarnates as they please, or of their own volition, so they favor the present system of private property and capitalism. Dallona’s new discoveries have completely undermined the Statisticalists' position, and they are determined to suppress the studies, and do away with Dallona permanently.

In reality, Dallona of Hadron is actually [[Paratime series#Hadron Dalla|Hadron Dalla]], a psychic-science researcher, from the [[Paratime series#First Level|Paratime First Level]]. And now that she has mysteriously disappeared, [[Paratime series#Tortha Karf|Tortha Karf]], the Chief of Paratime Police, sends his special assistant, [[Paratime series#Verkan Vall|Verkan Vall]], to the [[Paratime series#Akor-Neb Sector|Second Level Akor-Neb Sector]] to find her and bring her back before she can be forcibly discarnated (i.e., murdered).

Arriving in the provincial city of Ghamma, Vall, travelling under the pseudonym of Lord Virzal of Verkan, makes contact with the local representative of the Outtime Export and Import Company, and acquires a pair of Assassin bodyguards named Olirzon and Marnik. Together they then travel to the city of Darsh, where Dalla was doing her research, and where Garnon’s feast was held. At the Independent Institute of Reincarnation Research Vall talks to the director, to become familiar with Dalla’s research and its full political fallout.

Through his associate with the Society of Assassins and the constabulary, Olirzon finds evidence that suggests that Dalla is in fact alive, and hiding out with her Assassin-bodyguard, Dirzed. Vall realizes that it will prove impossible to find Dalla, so he must do something to get her to contact him. When Vall and the Assassins go to a restaurant, they find themselves sitting next to a table that contains three Statisticalists who are loudly denouncing Dalla’s work and disappearance as a politically inspired hoax. The three men “were of a breed Verkan Vall had learned to recognize on any time-line -- the arrogant, cocksure, ambitious, leftist politician, who knows what is best for everybody better than anybody else does, and who is convinced that he is inescapably right and that whoever differs with him is not only an ignoramus but a venal scoundrel as well.”

Feigning insult at one Statisticalist’s statements, Vall succeeds in getting each of the three to challenge him to individual duels, which in Akor-Neb are to the death. The first duel is handled with knives, and Vall succeeds in killing his opponent, Marnark of Bashad, in eight seconds. The remaining two duels are handled with guns, and Vall succeeds in killing these opponents, Sirzob of Abo and Yirzol of Narva, with one shot each to the head.

After the duels, Klarnood, the President-General of the Society of Assassins, who served as a witness to the duels, takes Vall aside, and informs him that the three men he has just killed were high among the leadership of the Statisticalist party, and that the Statisticalists will be as determined to discarnate him as they are Hadron Dalla. Also, he has certain knowledge that Dalla and Dirzed were alive four days previous, and that in three or four days he might be able to put Vall in communication with the pair. It is at that point that Vall explains that his reason for provoking the duels was to advertise his presence, so that Dalla can get in touch with him. Quickly checking a news broadcast on a visiplate, the pair finds that the duels are the top news story.

The next day, as the Earth of the Akor-Neb Sector descends into civil war, Verkan Vall receives a sealed message written in the alphabet and language of the First Paratime Level. It is from Dalla, and introduces its bearer as Dirzed, who has come to take Vall to her. She is hiding out in a hunting lodge that belongs to Prince Jirzyn of Starpha, a nobleman and important leader among the Volitionalists.

Dalla is overjoyed to see Vall, and happily tells him about all of the advancements she has made with past-life recall. But, when Vall tells her that she must immediately return to the First Level she refuses. It seems that one ramification of her studies has escaped her –- if a Paratimer dies in the Akor-Neb Sector, and later takes one of this sector’s past-life recall procedures, then the [[Paratime series#The Paratime Secret and the Paratime Police|Paratime secret]] will be utterly revealed. Conditioned, like all Paratimers, to protect the Paratime secret at all costs, Dalla realizes that it is imperative that they leave Akor-Neb as soon as possible.

Before they can leave the lodge, they and their Assassins come under attack from the Starpha family servants. It seems that Prince Jirzyn has changed his mind, and now wishes Lady Dallona dead –- Dalla’s experiments are beginning to bear more unexpected fruit. It seems that years ago Jirzyn of Starpha had murdered his brother to gain the title and position that his brother had, and now a man has found out that he was that brother in his most recent reincarnation and he has filled suit against Jirzyn to retrieve the title. This suit calls into question all the laws of inheritance, and has made the position of the rich and titled frighteningly unstable.

Besieged in an underground level of the hunting lodge, Vall and Dalla and their Assassin-bodyguards fight for their lives; their only hope being that when the shooting had started Marnik had been able to go to Klarnood for the help that he had promised. Just when the Starpha people gain the upper hand, and seem ready to discarnate the lot of them, help does indeed arrive and the Paratimers are saved. But all is not well, the lodge is rocked when an atomic bomb is detonated some forty miles distant, the first one fired in anger in a thousand years.

In Akor-Neb society, an Assassins’ Truce is a temporary cessation of hostilities, and before he leaves Vall recommends to President-General Klarnood that he declare a planet-wide Assassins’ Truce, holding the leaders personally responsible with their carnate existence for keeping it. Klarnood accepts the idea, and wishes Vall and Dalla well, expressing hope that he see neither of them ever again.

On their trip back to the First Level city of Dhergabar, Dalla expresses her regret at the forces she has released in the Akor-Neb Sector, but Vall assures her that she can only see the surface of the immediate situation, and that it is impossible to know what the long-term results will be. He compares the situation to that on Fourth Level Europo-American, where scientists regret their invention of the atomic bomb. Vall is confident that just what the sector needs is a “series of all-out atomic wars” and that, “in a century or so, the inventors of the atomic bomb will be hailed as the saviors of their species.”

As they talk, Dalla realizes that all her experiments prove that death isn’t forever, and that the last enemy -– death -– has finally been conquered. But Vall assures her that they still have one enemy left, stupidity, and death has no power over that. The story ends with Vall and Dalla vowing to return to the Akor-Neb Sector in a hundred years and see what changes have occurred.

'''''Los ángeles''''' ({{IPA-es|los ˈãŋ.xe.les|pron}}; [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "the angels") is the debut studio album by Spanish singer [[Rosalía Vila|Rosalía]], with production and arrangements by [[Raül Refree]]. It was released on February 10, 2017 by [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music Spain]].

==Background==
Rosalía began performing in [[tablao]]s a decade before the release of her recording debut, gradually becoming a known vocalist in [[Barcelona]]'s flamenco circuit. She worked as a [[guest artist]] and [[supporting act]] for various artists, including [[Chicuelo (guitarist)|Chicuelo]], [[Enric Palomar]], [[La Fura dels Baus]], [[Miguel Poveda]] and Rocío Márquez, performing across countries such as Germany, Singapur and Panama and events like the 2015 [[Primavera Sound]] and an [[Association of Performing Arts Professionals|APAP]] conference in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="elcultural"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elcultural.com/noticias/escenarios/Rosalia-y-Refree-al-flamenco-por-el-punk/10440|title=Rosalía y Refree, al flamenco por el punk|last=Yuste|first=Javier|date=February 15, 2017|accessdate=November 4, 2018|language=Spanish|work=El Cultural|publisher=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="millennial"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://smoda.elpais.com/celebrities/vips/entrevista-rosalia-cantaora-millenial-barcelona/|title=Rosalía, la cantaora millenial que revoluciona el flamenco (y agota entradas)|date=October 19, 2016|accessdate=November 4, 2018|work=[[El País]]|language=Spanish|last=Ortega|first=Henar}}&lt;/ref&gt; She told ''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]'': "I have done many collaborations with other musicians, and I have always tried that they were older than me, in order to learn from them."&lt;ref name="abuela"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.es/cultura/musica/abci-rosalia-interes-flamenco-nacio-viendo-cine-barrio-abuela-201702281345_noticia.html|title=Rosalía: «Mi primer contacto con el flamenco fue viendo Cine de Barrio con mi abuela»|last=Serrano|first=Nacho|language=Spanish|work=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]|date=February 28, 2017|accessdate=November 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosalía grew up in a family with no artistic background that mostly listened to music in English.&lt;ref name="estopa"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20180326/441968249949/rosalia-en-mi-casa-lo-mas-parecido-que-se-escuchaba-al-flamenco-era-estopa.html|title=Rosalía: "En mi casa lo más parecido que se escuchaba al flamenco era Estopa"|last=Herrero|first=Gabriel|date=March 26, 2018|accessdate=November 4, 2018|language=Spanish|work=[[La Vanguardia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She discovered flamenco at thirteen when her friends played [[Camarón de la Isla]] while meeting in a park after school, soon becoming fascinated with the genre and studying it on her own.&lt;ref name="woman"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.woman.es/celebrities/protagonistas/rosalia-primera-escuche-camaron-traspaso|title=Rosalía: "La primera vez que escuché a Camarón, me traspasó"|language=Spanish|date=August 7, 2017|accessdate=November 4, 2018|last=Tamarit|first=Olga|work=Woman Madame Figaro|publisher=Grupo Zeta}}&lt;/ref&gt; As she immersed herself in the Catalan flamenco scene, Rosalía met local fixture José Miguel Vizcaya "El Chiqui de la Línea", who suggested she started a degree in music.&lt;ref name="p4k"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/rising/get-to-know-rosalia-the-spanish-singer-giving-flamencos-age-old-sound-a-bracingly-modern-twist/|title=Get to Know Rosalía, the Spanish Singer Giving Flamenco’s Age-Old Sound a Bracingly Modern Twist|date=September 18, 2018|accessdate=November 4, 2018|publisher=[[Pitchfork]]|first=Philip|last=Sherburne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dazeddigital"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/42076/1/rosalia-el-mal-querer-interview|title=Rosalía is the Catalan star reshaping the sound of global pop|date=November 2, 2018|accessdate=November 4, 2018|first=Gunseli|last=Yalcinkaya|publisher=[[Dazed Digital]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; "El Chiqui" became Rosalía's teacher for the following eight years, as she studied Interpretation of Flamenco Singing at the [[Catalonia College of Music]] (Spanish: ''Escuela Superior de Música de Cataluña'', ESMUC).&lt;ref name="estopa"/&gt; The ESMUC only accepts one student of this discipline per year and Rosalía was selected in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revistavanityfair.es/cultura/entretenimiento/articulos/rosalia-malamante-pienso-tu-mira-el-mal-querer-refree-manager-canada/34353|title=Estos son los 10 nombre clave de la carrera de Rosalía|date=October 30, 2018|accessdate=November 4, 2018|last=Serrano|first=Álex|language=Spanish|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair Spain]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The singer has described "El Chiqui" as a fundamental figure in her career, who encouraged her to investigate the genre even further back in time. Speaking with ''ABC'', she stated: "To me, flamenco was Camarón, something of [[Romani people|gypsy]] aesthetics, and when going back I found many other things that I loved. [...] When I discovered ''[[cantaor]]es'' like Niño de la Huerta or "El Gloria", "El Chiqui" taught me to listen and appreciate their singing, because their recordings sound very bad! To people of our age that sound seems terrible to us."&lt;ref name="abuela"/&gt;

''Los ángeles'' is a [[concept album]] that collects a series of ''[[Palo (flamenco)|cantes]]'' which have [[death]] as its central theme.&lt;ref name="rtve"/&gt; It is a presentation of Rosalía as a soloist ''[[cantaora]]'' and as such its structure is similar to that of the debut of any orthodox flamenco singer: "a selection of varied ''[[Palo (flamenco)|palos]]'', often with traditional or popular lyrics, in which the artist shows his or her aptitude and background."&lt;ref name="jenesaispop"/&gt; In this manner, the singer encompasses several [[Musical form|forms]] of the genre, including ''[[alegrías]]'', ''[[Tango (flamenco)|tangos]]'', ''[[fandango]]s'', ''fandanguillos'', ''[[seguidillas]]'', ''[[tarantas]]'', ''[[malagueñas]]'' and "more specific" styles like ''[[Guajira (music)|guajira]]'', ''[[Saeta (flamenco)|saeta]]'' and ''milonga''.&lt;ref name="jenesaispop"/&gt; Rosalía felt that in the album "the ''cantes'' become songs", and as such did not list the ''palos''{{'s}} titles in the track listing, explaining that: "It's a way of saying that I am based on melodies and lyrics from ''cantes'', but we turn it into something else. Those who know something about flamenco will be able to identify them, because we are influenced by that, but we do our own thing."&lt;ref name="rtve"/&gt; 

Rosalía told Ecleen Luzmila Caraballo of [[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]] in 2018: "I feel like with ''Los ángeles'', I wanted to establish my musical legacy... and honor the classic sound of flamenco in the most traditional sense, respecting them to the maximum, with a pop and experimental structure, but with very basic instrumentation and a minimalist sound—just guitar and voice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://themuse.jezebel.com/rosalia-is-redefining-flamenco-1830164344|publisher=[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]|date=November 2, 2018|accessdate=November 5, 2018|title=Rosalía Is Redefining Flamenco|last=Caraballo|first=Ecleen Luzmila}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish filmmaking collective Manson directed the music video for "De plata", which features the singer performing the track as she walks and dances in the streets of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].&lt;ref name="nownessplata"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nowness.com/topic/los-angeles/rosalia-de-plata-manson|title=Rosalía: De Plata|date=May 19, 2017|accessdate=November 23, 2018|publisher=[[Nowness]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in Rosalía's YouTube channel on May 26, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfDEEyg3AdA|title=Rosalía - De Plata|date=May 26, 2017|accessdate=November 23, 2018|publisher=[[Rosalía Vila|Rosalía]] on [[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luis Troquel of ''[[Rockdelux]]'' felt that the clip showed a "facet of Rosalía that was unknown to many", as she dances "with a glowing enchantment and exuberant style."&lt;ref name="troquelrockdelux"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.rockdelux.com/secciones/p/rosalia-cantar-a-la-muerte-en-la-flor-de-la-vida.html|title=Rosalía.

''Los ángeles'' received several positive reviews from [[music critics]].&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; Spanish magazine ''[[Rockdelux]]'' called it "one of the most intense and sweeping debuts of recent times", with critic Juan Monge complimenting its mix of tradition and avant-garde.&lt;ref name="rockdelux"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockdelux.com/discos/p/rosalia-los-angeles.html|title=Rosalía. Los Ángeles|language=Spanish|last=Monge|first=Juan|date=April 2017|accessdate=July 25, 2018|work=[[Rockdelux]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AllMusic]]'s Mariano Prunes highly commended Rosalía's vocals, writing that "her instrument is a tornado capable of sweeping away any cultural or [[language barrier]]s", while noting that "she does not accomplish this with sheer volume or vocal histrionics, but by reaching almost unbearable levels of intensity and expression."&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; He concluded that ''Los ángeles'' "signals the appearance of a major talent in both the flamenco and the [[world music]] scene."&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; Writing for MondoSonoro, Yeray S. Iborra felt that with ''Los ángeles'', Rosalía "is posited as the contemporary [[cantaor]]a who has better understood the current times", noting the difference between the album and her "more American" collaboration with C. Tangana.&lt;ref name="mondosonoro"/&gt;

===Flamenco specialists===
In an ''[[El Confidencial]]'' article, musician and investigator Pedro Lópeh criticized the album, particularly Refree's work, deeming it "artificial" and "wearisome". His views coincided with those of Silvia Cruz, another flamenco expert. He stated: "I also insist on talking about Refree because the inks are always loaded against her and little or nothing against him, who is the producer and first author of this album. I do not think ''Los ángeles'' does any harm to flamenco, but it is a decontextualized product. Apart from the lyrics, I do not hear anything in it that appeals to the history of flamenco, its roots or its referents. For that reason, it does not seem to me a groundbreaking or revolutionary work and if it has come to save something, it is the [[music industry]], not flamenco."&lt;ref name="antigitana"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elconfidencial.com/cultura/2018-01-15/flamenco-rosalia-debate-cante-siglo-xxi_1504553/|language=Spanish|title=¿Rosalía antigitana?

He said: "Rosalía does not sing badly, but in flamenco she does not fit much. She is a very respectful girl, who has not come to invent a revolution for her face. She does not hurt anyone or has proclaimed herself master of anything." He was also critical of the album's promotional campaign, arguing that it installed the unworthy image of Rosalía as "the great revolution of flamenco".&lt;ref name="eldiario"/&gt;

==Accolades==
''Los ángeles'' ranked highly in the year-end lists of the Spanish specialized press.

In late 2017, Rosalía received the Premio Ojo Crítico in the category of Modern Music, awarded by [[Radio Nacional de España|RNE]].

Alonso of Jenesaispop.com noted that the album had remained charting since its release, ascending to number twenty-eight in its third week and maintaining that position the following week. Feeling that it was in its way to becoming the Spanish "[[sleeper hit]] of the year", Alonso described ''Los ángeles''{{'}}s chart run as "totally exceptional", taking into account that most albums "after the hype of the fans during the first week, [fall] slightly on the list until they settle depending on the duration of the promotion of the album or directly collapse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jenesaispop.com/2017/03/16/292182/los-angeles-rosalia-camino-sleeper-del-ano-espana/|title=‘Los Ángeles’ de Rosalía, camino a ser el sleeper del año en España|language=Spanish|last=Alonso|first=Sebas E.|date=March 16, 2017|accessdate=September 3, 2018|publisher=Jenesaispop.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Jordi Bardají wrote on November 1, 2018 that the record was "one of the greatest 'sleepers' that Spanish sales lists have known in recent times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jenesaispop.com/2018/11/02/345310/rosalia-publica-al-fin-el-mal-querer/|last=Bardají|first=Jordi|language=Spanish|date=November 1, 2018|title=Rosalía publica al fin ‘El mal querer’|accessdate=November 2, 2018|publisher=Jenesaispop.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Los ángeles'' reached its peak position of number nine and has remained in the albums chart since its entry, having accumulated a total of eighty weeks.&lt;ref name="hungmedien"/&gt;

'''Lucy Finch''' (born 1943) is a [[palliative care|palliative nurse]] who has worked in several African countries and founded a [[hospice]] in [[Malawi]] – ''Ndi Moyo'' – "the place giving life".

== Early life ==
Born Lucy Kishindo in [[Malawi]] in 1943, she was the eldest of 11 children&lt;ref name=Manele/&gt; of an Anglican primary school teacher. She was educated at [[mission school]]s in southern Malawi and trained as a nurse in the UK.&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;

== Nursing ==
In September 1964, Lucy travelled to Scotland to study nursing at the South Edinburgh School of Nursing.  In 1969, she met and married Tony Finch, son of the potter [[Ray Finch (potter)|Ray Finch]].&lt;ref name=G/&gt;  He worked for the [[Forestry Commission]] around the world and Lucy travelled with him, working as a nurse in Britain, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.&lt;ref name=Manele/&gt;  In 1997, while her husband was based in [[Kampala]], Lucy Finch began volunteering at [[Hospice Africa Uganda]], where she worked with Dr [[Anne Merriman]] in her pioneering, palliative care programme.&lt;ref name=AM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;  A year later, she returned to Malawi to nurse her sister, who was dying of HIV-related [[meningitis]].&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;  In the same hospital, a young man was dying in great pain and distress with no adequate pain relief.&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;  Lucy Finch vowed then, that with the knowledge and skills that she had, she would never again allow herself to be in that position where she could not help somebody who was suffering.&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;&lt;ref name=nmos/&gt;

==''Ndi Moyo''==
In 2002, Lucy and Tony Finch returned to Malawi and she began to help local patients, providing them with [[paracetamol]] and other assistance.  In 2005, her family and friends in the UK founded a charity to raise funds to support the work that she had started.&lt;ref name=nmos/&gt;  After gathering resources, the hospice ''Ndi Moyo'' – "the place giving life" – was opened in the [[Salima District]] in 2007 by the Minister of Health, [[Marjorie Ngaunje]].&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt; In 2016, it was the only hospice in all of Malawi.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Some sources say that the hospice was the first in Malawi but a [[Peace Corps]] nurse, Mary Jane Lucas, started a similar small hospice when she was there from 1999 to 2001.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;}} As of 2016, ''Ndi Moyo'' treats about 330 patients; trains and mentors health professionals; runs outreach clinics; and advocates for better [[end-of-life care]].&lt;ref name=nmos/&gt;  It provides home-based, patient-centred, holistic care to patients who would otherwise have little access to pain relief or end-of-life support.  According to 2015 estimates, approximately 1 million people in Malawi are living with [[HIV/AIDS]] and many of these patients develop cancers in a country that has no curative public health cancer treatment.&lt;ref name=UNAIDS/&gt;

==Recognition==
In 2013, Lucy Finch was recognised by [[Hospice Africa Uganda]] for her outstanding support in the promotion and development of palliative care in Uganda.&lt;ref name=nmos/&gt;  In 2015, she was awarded a Certificate of Recognition by the Right Honourable Dr [[Peter Kumpalume]], the Malawi Minister for Health.  In 2016, she was recognised as one of the [[100 Women (BBC)|BBC's 100 Women]] for her work caring for the dying.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Majin Buu'''|魔人ブウ|Majin Bū|lead=yes}}, generally spelled '''Majin Boo''' in subtitles of the Japanese anime, and rendered as '''Djinn-Boo''' in the [[Viz Media]] manga, is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and the final antagonist in the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' manga series created by [[Akira Toriyama]]. He is introduced in chapter #460 {{nihongo|''Majin Boo Appears?!''|魔人ブウ出現か!?|Majin Bū Shutsugen ka!?}} first published in ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'' magazine on March 1, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediaarts-db.jp/mg/magazines/322045 |title=週刊少年ジャンプ　1994/03/01　表示号数13 |website=Media Arts Database |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Majin Buu is a [[genie]]-like magical life form created by the evil warlock Bibidi that terrorized galaxies by destroying entire planets, millions of years before the events of ''Dragon Ball'' take place. He was temporarily sealed away and brought to Earth; however, Bibidi was killed and Buu remained hidden. During the events of ''Dragon Ball'', he is revived by Bibidi's son [[Babidi]] in order to carry on his father's plan to conquer the entire universe.

==Creation and design==
Manga author Akira Toriyama stated that when creating a villain in ''Dragon Ball'', he would try to make them different from any that had come before. Although it was difficult and he was usually not entirely pleased with the results, he thinks he did achieve this with Majin Buu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON BALL 大全集 6 MOVIES &amp; TV SPECIALS|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=212–216|year=1995|isbn=4-08-782756-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Shenlong Times'' issue #2, a bonus pamphlet given to some buyers of the ''[[Dragon Ball#Companion books|Daizenshuu 2: Story Guide]]'' guidebook, says that Majin Buu was modeled after Toriyama's editor at the time, Fuyuto Takeda.&lt;ref name="ST2"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Shenlong Times 2 |work=DRAGON BALL 大全集 2: STORY GUIDE |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |page=6 |year=1995| language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buu, Bibbidi and Bobbidi take their names from the song "[[Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo]]" in the Walt Disney movie ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''.&lt;ref name="ANN8review"&gt;{{cite web |first= Martin|last= Theron|title= Dragon Ball Z Season 8 DVD Set - Review|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/dragon-ball-z/dvd-season-8|publisher= Anime News Network|date= 2008-06-16|accessdate= 2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Majin Buu has several different forms, each with a different appearance and personality, however, all are pink creatures with an antenna on their head and several holes/pores on both sides of their heads, arms and their vertebrae. They have a rubbery body that can [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] instantly from any wound,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|title=Dragon Ball, Volume 39 (Dragon Ball Z, Volume 23) |year=2005 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 465 |pages=75–87 |isbn=978-1-4215-0148-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; separate parts of it from themselves and control them independently,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|title=Dragon Ball, Volume 39 (Dragon Ball Z, Volume 23) |year=2005 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 466 |pages=89–101 |isbn=978-1-4215-0148-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can even completely restore themselves from vapor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|title=Dragon Ball, Volume 39 (Dragon Ball Z, Volume 23) |year=2005 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 460 |pages=7–19 |isbn=978-1-4215-0148-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buu can also heal damaged beings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|title=Dragon Ball, Volume 39 (Dragon Ball Z, Volume 23) |year=2005 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 468 |pages=115–127 |isbn=978-1-4215-0148-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can absorb other organisms by enveloping them with his body or eating them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|title=Dragon Ball, Volume 40 (Dragon Ball Z, Volume 24) |year=2006 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 485 |pages=170–181 |isbn=978-1-4215-0273-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter done by using his signature attack that turns people into food such as candy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|title=Dragon Ball, Volume 39 (Dragon Ball Z, Volume 23) |year=2005 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 464 |pages=61–73 |isbn=978-1-4215-0148-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When first introduced he is overweight and wears gloves, boots, a vest and a cape. His appearance and the manner in which he appeared from his ball is somewhat genie-esque, an aspect further implied in the Japanese word "Majin" in his name, which can read as "Djinn", which lead to Viz Media rendering his name as Djinn-Boo for the English manga release. His trousers, in all forms he takes, bear the same "M" symbol as many other characters associated with Babidi in this part of the manga; whether this is short for Buu's title of "Majin", Babidi's title of "Madoshi" in the original Japanese, or something else is unclear.

Majin Buu's manner is very naive and childlike, taking joy in fighting and scaring people. Throughout the series, he is always referred to by either Majin Buu or simply Buu, no matter what form he is in. However, each form has been given their own names in guidebooks, video games or by fans, in order to distinguish between them. When Buu expels the evil inside him, it takes on a taller and much skinnier, frail form referred to as {{nihongo|"Pure Evil Majin Buu"|魔人ブウ 純粋悪|Majin Bū Junsui Aku}}.&lt;ref name="DB Daizenshuu 4"&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON BALL 大全集 4: WORLD GUIDE|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|year=1995|isbn= 4-08-782754-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}} When this Buu absorbs the fat one, he transforms in a muscular version of himself referred to as {{nihongo|"Evil Majin Buu"|魔人ブウ 悪|Majin Bū Aku}}.&lt;ref name="DB Daizenshuu 4"/&gt;{{rp|61}} Personality-wise, Evil Buu is more intelligent than Buu and is described as "pure rage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|title=Dragon Ball, Volume 41 (Dragon Ball Z, Volume 25) |year=2006 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 486 |page=9 |isbn=978-1-4215-0404-9 |quote=Now his body is perfectly suited to battle... and his soul is pure rage...}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This intelligence allows him to plan ahead for the opportunity to absorb Gotenks and [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]], and later [[Gohan (Dragon Ball)|Gohan]]. After absorbing the first two, his antenna lengthen and forming five full-fingers, Evil Buu gains Piccolo's intellect and momentarily wore Gotenks's vest and strength before his latter victim's fusion wore off. He then absorbed Gohan, gaining his power while wearing his [[Keikogi|dōgi]] top and undershirt. The last form shown, referred to as Kid Buu or {{nihongo|"Pure Majin Buu"|魔人ブウ 純粋|Majin Bū Junsui}},&lt;ref name="DB Daizenshuu 4"/&gt;{{rp|61}} is actually Buu's original form. Evil Buu was forced into that state after the fat Buu was completely removed from his body along with Gohan, Goten, Trunks, and Piccolo. While a child-like version of Evil Buu, Kid Buu is completely feral and animalistic, living only to destroy and is called "evil incarnate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|title=Dragon Ball, Volume 42 (Dragon Ball Z, Volume 26) |year=2006 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 508 |page=80 |isbn=978-1-4215-0636-4 |quote=This Buu... is evil incarnate...}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Daizenshuu 2: Story Guide'' refers to him as the "strongest enemy in the universe".&lt;ref name="Daizenshuu 2"&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON BALL 大全集 2: STORY GUIDE|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|year=1995|page=242|isbn=4-08-782752-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after Kid Buu is killed, the fat Majin Buu lives on Earth now completely-kindhearted and known as {{nihongo|Mr. Buu|ミスター・ブウ|Misutā Bū}}. In the anime, Buu's "Evil" and "Pure" forms' designs differ from the manga in that they both always have five fingers.

==Powers and abilities==
Being the final villain faced by the protagonists in the ''Dragon Ball'' manga, Buu is the most powerful of them all, possessing vast [[superhuman strength]], speed and reflexes beyond that of a trained Super Saiyan 2. He is able to channel his inner [[Qi|Ki]] energy for devastating offensive techniques capable of destroying planets or star systems. Buu also holds the unique ability of being able to transform objects or living things into chocolate or other sweet foods which he then consumes to satiate his greed and gluttony. Buu is also able to instantly recover and [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] from severe trauma, dismemberment and even combustion at a sub-molecular level. Buu can instantly emulate techniques used on him, launching Goku's signature Kamehameha many times.

==Appearances==
===In ''Dragon Ball''===
[[File:Majin-Boo.jpg|thumb|250px|Majin Buu in the anime, in the first form he is introduced in.]]
Before the events of ''Dragon Ball'', the evil warlock Bibbidi created Majin Buu; a being that existed "solely to slaughter and destroy" and within a few years they destroyed hundreds of planets.&lt;ref name="backstory"&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|title=Dragon Ball, Volume 37 (Dragon Ball Z, Volume 21) |year=2005 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 445 |pages=189–191 |isbn=1-59116-873-2 |quote=This Djinn possesses neither reason nor emotion. He exists solely to slaughter and destroy. To strike fear into the hearts of all living things. In just a few years, hundreds of planets were wiped out.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buu even killed four of the five [[Kaiō-shin|Supreme Kais]] who govern the universe, absorbing one of them and their leader which dulled his destructive nature and turned him into his current form. But Buu was still too ferocious even for Bibbidi to control, resulting with the Majin temporarily sealed and moved to their next target, Earth.&lt;ref name="backstory"/&gt; But the last surviving Supreme Kai, Shin, took advantage of this to kill Bibbidi with Buu sealed away on Earth.&lt;ref name="backstory"/&gt; In the present day, Bibbidi's son Babidi makes it his goal to revive Buu, which Shin plans to prevent by killing him. But Shin underestimates the power of Goku and Vegeta, and their spent energy results in Majin Buu's quick revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|title=Dragon Ball, Volume 38 (Dragon Ball Z, Volume 22) |year=2005 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 459 |pages=179–191 |isbn=978-1-4215-0051-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Babidi threatens to re-seal him, Buu begins to obey his orders and destroys and kills everything and everyone in sight in-order to get Piccolo, Trunks and Goten to come out of hiding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|title=Dragon Ball, Volume 39 (Dragon Ball Z, Volume 23) |year=2005 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 471 |pages=155–160 |isbn=978-1-4215-0148-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is until Goku asks him why he lets Babidi boss him around, leading to Buu killing him, however he continues his mischief and destruction, unaware that what he is doing is wrong.&lt;ref name="Vol40"&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|title=Dragon Ball, Volume 40 (Dragon Ball Z, Volume 24) |year=2006 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapters 473–485 |pages=7–181 |isbn=978-1-4215-0273-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Majin Buu attacks humans, destroying nearly all of the world's population, then builds a house by converting people into clay. He is resting in his house when [[Mr. Satan]] befriends him while waiting for an opening to kill him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|title=Dragon Ball, Volume 40 (Dragon Ball Z, Volume 24) |year=2006 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 481 |pages=115|isbn=978-1-4215-0273-1 |quote=In just one day, 80% of the world's population has been decimated.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The friendship coupled with the affection from a dog he healed, has Buu resolve not to kill anymore, when two civilians shoot the dog and then Mr. Satan.&lt;ref name="Vol40"/&gt; Buu heals them, but the evil aspect of his personality takes advantage of Buu's rage to manifest out of his body, transforming into a taller and much skinnier Buu, who attacks the now weaker fat Buu.&lt;ref name="Vol40"/&gt; The evil Buu reflects fat Buu's attack, turning his benign counterpart into chocolate and eating him to become whole and transform into a more dangerous Majin Buu.&lt;ref name="Vol40"/&gt; Evil Buu quickly senses Piccolo, Trunks and Goten and goes to them, demanding Gotenks fight him.&lt;ref name="Vol41"&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|title=Dragon Ball, Volume 41 (Dragon Ball Z, Volume 25) |year=2006 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapters 486–487, 497–502 |pages=7–33, 156–235|isbn=978-1-4215-0404-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gohan then arrives and clearly has the upper-hand over Buu, but Buu absorbs Gotenks and later Piccolo. Now stronger than Gohan, Buu, knowing that there is a time-limit on Gotenks' fusion, planned ahead and is able to absorb Gohan as well.&lt;ref name="Vol41"/&gt; However, [[Goku]] and [[Vegeta]] fuse together into Vegito, but, despite being powerful enough to defeat him, they purposefully get absorbed by Buu in-order to enter his body.&lt;ref name="Vol42"&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|title=Dragon Ball, Volume 42 (Dragon Ball Z, Volume 26) |year=2006 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapters 503–519 |pages=7–243|isbn=1-4215-0636-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Potara Fusion ran its course, Goku and Vegeta manage to retrieve Gohan, Piccolo, Goten, and Trunks before they completely separate fat Buu from Evil Buu.&lt;ref name="Vol42"/&gt;

The removal of Buu causes Evil Buu to revert to the original form of Majin Buu, no longer deluded by his benign counterpart as he immediately destroys the Earth.&lt;ref name="Vol42"/&gt; Kid Buu then follows Goku and Vegeta to the Kaiō-shin planet, where, after a battle with Goku, he is stalled by Vegeta and then fat Buu, so that Goku can finish him off with a giant ''Genki-Dama'' made with energy from the people on the newly resurrected Earth.&lt;ref name="Vol42"/&gt; The good fat Majin Buu goes on to live with Mr. Satan on Earth as Mr. Buu, after the Dragon Balls erase the people of Earth's memories about him.&lt;ref name="Vol42"/&gt; Kid Buu is reincarnated into a child named [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Oob|Oob]], whom, ten years later, Goku meets at the Tenka'ichi Budōkai martial arts tournament and leaves with to train as his successor.&lt;ref name="Vol42"/&gt;

=== In ''Dragon Ball Super'' ===
Buu is selected to participate in the Universe 7 team's tournament with Universe 6. He is disqualified before the tournament begins by falling asleep during the exam. Buu agrees to fight with Goku and Gohan in the Universe Survival tournament, being matched against Universe 9's Basil.&lt;ref&gt;"The Universes' Gods are Aghast! You'll Be Obliterated if You Lose at the "Tournament of Power". Dragon Ball Super. Episode 78. February 12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Buu is initially overwhelmed, though becomes enraged over seeing Mr. Satan injured by the battle collaterally and quickly overpowers Basil. After consuming a drug that increases his power, Basil seems to gain the upper hand on Buu with a buffer form coinciding with his attacks, however Buu is unaffected by the attacks and defeats Basil with a Kamehameha wave. Buu then heals Mr. Satan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Universe 9's Kicker Basil vs Universe 7's Majin Buu|date=February 19, 2017|series=''Dragon Ball Super''|number=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the mini tournament, Buu begins to train on Earth for the Tournament of Power. Due to the intensity of his training, Buu gains a slimmer and toned body and spares against Goku, beating him. Alas, also due to the intensity of his training, Buu falls asleep and will not wake for 3 months, forcing him to miss the Tournament of Power. 

Shortly after the events of the Tournament of Power and [[Dragon Ball Super: Broly|Broly]], Buu is kidnapped by the Galactic Patrol and taken to their headquarters. Goku and Vegeta are taken as well and find out their kidnapper is Merusu, the Galatic Patrol's #1 elite patrolman. Merusu explains that an evil criminal has escaped from galactic prison, and in order to recapture this criminal they need the Grand Kaioshin who is inside of Buu.

===In other media===

In ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]'', an anime-only sequel to the series, both Mr. Buu and Oob participate in battles against foes such as [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Baby|Baby]], [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Android #17|Super Android #17]] and [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Shadow Dragons|Super One-Star Dragon]]. They also fuse together, creating a character referred to as "Majoob" or {{nihongo|Super Oob|スーパーウーブ|Sūpā Ūbu}} and became more powerful. Buu is also seen in the 2008 short film ''[[Dragon Ball: Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!]]'' and plays a small role in the 2013 theatrical ''Dragon Ball Z'' film, ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods|Battle of Gods]]''.

Majin Buu briefly appears in an episode of the 1997 anime remake of Toriyama's ''[[Dr. Slump]]'', and makes a brief cameo appearance in Toriyama's manga series ''[[Neko Majin Z]]''. He also appears in chapter four of the ''[[Saikyō Jump]]'' manga ''Dragon Ball SD'', a [[super deformed]] spin-off of ''Dragon Ball'' written by Naho Ōishi, which depicts a comedic alternate retelling of him being released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Ōishi |first=Naho |title=Chapter 4 |language=Japanese |magazine=Saikyō Jump |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |series=''Dragon Ball SD''|volume=4 |date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ōishi drew a special chapter focusing on Buu for the July 2014 issue, titled {{nihongo|''Dragon Ball SD Majin Buu Extra Story''|ドラゴンボールSD 魔人ブウ番外編|Doragonbōru SD Majin Bū Bangai-hen}} it also features Toriyama's ''[[Neko Majin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Ōishi |first=Naho |title=''Dragon Ball SD Majin Buu Extra Story'' |language=Japanese |magazine=Saikyō Jump |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |series=''Dragon Ball SD'' |date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a playable character in the franchise's [[video games]], the first being ''Dragon Ball Z: Super Butōden 3'' in 1994, but also in most of the more recent games such as the ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi|Dragon Ball Z: Sparking!]]'' series. He is also playable in the ''Weekly Shōnen Jump'' crossover games ''[[Battle Stadium D.O.N]]'' and ''[[Jump Ultimate Stars]]''.

He is also referenced in the song "Pink Matter" by [[Frank Ocean]] featuring [[André 3000]] in the lyrics "That soft pink matter, Cotton candy Majin Buu".

==Voice actors==
[[File:10.15.11DragonBallZCastByLuigiNovi6.jpg|thumb|Justin Cook voices Evil and Super Buu in Funimation's English dubs.]]
In the original Japanese, Buu and all his forms are voiced by [[Kōzō Shioya]] in all media.&lt;ref name="Super"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-06-15/dragon-ball-super-main-visual-reveals-2-new-characters/.89281|title=Dragon Ball Super Main Visual Reveals 2 New Characters|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2015-06-15|accessdate=2015-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he looked at the character as a self-centered three-year-old.

==Reception==

Majin Buu is a popular character in the ''Dragon Ball'' series, in 2004 Japanese fans voted him the eighth most popular character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dragon Ball Forever |year=2004 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |isbn=4-08-873702-4|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was rated by ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine as the 40th greatest [[villain]] of all time, the only [[anime]] or [[manga]] character from Japan to make the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= The Wizard Staff|date=July 2006|title= The 100 Greatest Villains of All Time|magazine= Wizard Magazine|issue= 177|page= 90}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]]'s David F. Smith states that although he is tough, Majin Buu's pink complexion prevents anybody from taking him as a serious threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= David|last= Smith|title= Dragon Ball Z: Season Five DVD Review, You probably know the drill by now, as we plow into the long Cell Saga.|url= http://dvd.ign.com/articles/881/881818p1.html|publisher= IGN|date= 2008-06-16|accessdate= 2013-05-25|quote= Let's be honest with ourselves – Majin Buu was pretty tough, but he was just a little too pink to take seriously as a threat most of the time.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theron Martin of [[Anime News Network]] claims Buu's "childlike demeanor actually gives his malicious smiles and mad faces a surprisingly chilling effect", claiming it sets him apart from the "hyper-evil badasses" of the series.&lt;ref name="ANN8review"/&gt; He called Josh Martin's English vocal performance far more childish than Kōzō Shioya's, but also felt that Shioya's voice does not fit Buu's behavior.&lt;ref name="ANN8review"/&gt; According to Dennis Amith of J!-ENT, seeing him "kill people for the sake of hunger or for enjoyment to hear things go 'boom{{'"}} makes Buu the deadliest villain of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Dennis|last= Amith|title= Dragon Ball Z – Dragon Box Z Vol. 6 (a J!-ENT Anime DVD Review)|url= http://j-entonline.com/blu-ray-dvd-reviews/dvd-reviews-film-tv/anime-reviews/dragon-ball-z-dragon-box-z-vol-6-a-j-ent-anime-dvd-review/|publisher= J!-ENT|date= 2011-07-07|accessdate= 2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toriyama stated that the fight between Buu and Gotenks was fun to draw because he was able to come up with odd techniques in "the spirit of gag manga".&lt;ref name="DB Daizenshuu 4"/&gt;{{rp|167}}

{{nihongo foot|'''''Metroid: Other M'''''|メトロイド アザーエム|Metoroido Azā Emu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is an [[action-adventure]] video game developed by [[Team Ninja]] and [[Nintendo]] &lt;!-- D-Rockets, while part of Project M, is a CG animation studio, not a developer --&gt; and published by Nintendo for the [[Wii]] in 2010. It is part of the ''[[Metroid]]'' series, and takes place between the events of ''[[Super Metroid]]'' and ''[[Metroid Fusion]]''. The player controls intergalactic [[bounty hunter]] [[Samus Aran]], who investigates a [[Flotsam, jetsam, lagan, and derelict|derelict]] space station with a Galactic Federation platoon, including her former [[commanding officer]], Adam Malkovich.

Longtime ''Metroid'' director [[Yoshio Sakamoto]] approached Team Ninja to develop ''Other M'', while animation studio D-Rockets was brought in to handle the in-game [[cutscene]]s. The development team employed a simple control scheme to make the game appealing to modern players, and gave significant focus on plot and characterization, with extensive cinematics and voice acting. ''Other M'' is played from a [[virtual camera system|third-person]] perspective using only the [[Wii Remote]], and focuses on exploration and combat. It introduces [[Melee (gaming)|melee]] attacks which can only be executed when an enemy's health is reduced.

''Other M'' received praise for its gameplay, music, graphics and atmosphere. Some journalists, however, criticized its plot and Samus's characterization. The game also received honors from several journalistic sites and magazines. It was the third best-selling video game in Japan during its week of release, and the ninth best-selling game in North America during September 2010. ''Metroid: Other M'' was re-released on the [[Wii U]]'s [[Nintendo eShop]] in 2016.

Sakamoto served as producer and scenario designer, and main design was done by three designers from previous 2D ''Metroid'' games—''[[Metroid Fusion]]'' (2002) and ''[[Metroid: Zero Mission]]'' (2004). Team Ninja took charge of the [[Computer programming|programming]] and [[3D modeling]], and D-Rockets handled the [[Computer-generated imagery|CG]] cutscenes.&lt;ref name="1UP-2009-Interview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite web|first=Chris |last=Kohler |title=Sakamoto Metroid Other M Interview |date=June 3, 2009 |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/06/metroid-interview/ |accessdate=June 3, 2009 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XmcMw24F?url=http://www.wired.com/2009/06/metroid-interview/ |archivedate=April 14, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayashi described the work on the game as "a great honour" since he was a fan of the series, and stated Team Ninja tried to include as many creatures seen in previous games as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/19608/team-ninja-honoured-to-work-on-metroid-other-m/|title=Team Ninja 'honoured' to work on Metroid: Other M|last=East|first=Thomas|date=September 1, 2010|work=[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]|accessdate=September 13, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603173557/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/19608/team-ninja-honoured-to-work-on-metroid-other-m/|archivedate=June 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Retro Studios]] tried to create "the ultimate first-person experience" with the ''[[Metroid Prime]]'' series, Sakamoto's approach with gameplay was different, particularly for the story ''Other M'' intended to tell.&lt;ref name=cvg/&gt; Sakamoto's intent was to create a game with "controls as simple as those of a [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game", so it would appeal to modern players. Team Ninja agreed with that approach, as they felt control schemes with excessive buttons were possibly turning players off the action genre, and tried to make the game employ only the Wii Remote, without resorting to the [[Wii Remote#Nunchuk|Nunchuk]].&lt;ref name=iwata/&gt; The development team also tried to use the simpler controls to provide flashy action, with varied special attacks that would need few button inputs to be executed.&lt;ref name=devvideo/&gt; Sakamoto focused on 2D-like gameplay because he considered it more "comfortable" for audiences, particularly during shifts from gameplay to cutscenes, as he thought 2D "[doesn't] have the same distractions when you want to give them story sequences".&lt;ref name=joystiq/&gt; While the developers felt no need to integrate everything from the ''Prime'' series as they were games with different concepts, a few of the elements that "made those games unique" were implemented into ''Other M'', such as the "immersive sight" of the first-person mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/video-games/controller-freak/nintendo-designer-yoshio-sakamoto-on-metroid-other-m/article1718156/|title=Nintendo designer Yoshio Sakamoto on Metroid: Other M |date=September 22, 2010|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|author=Sapieha, Chad|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned if ''Other M'' would be too similar to ''Ninja Gaiden'', Hayashi responded that while the new game will feature heavy action-based sequences, there will still be the exploration-based sequences characteristic of other ''Metroid'' games. Sakamoto said that ''Other M'''s story progression was in the same manner as ''[[Metroid Fusion]]'', and stated that the collaboration between Nintendo and Team Ninja is "unlike anything that's ever been done at Nintendo; it's more than just a collaborative effort — it's one group working toward a common goal".&lt;ref name="1UP-2009-Interview" /&gt;

Before ''Other M''{{'}}s development, Sakamoto did not think too much about "what kind of person Samus Aran was and how she thinks and her personality", particularly because the games tried to depict Samus as a mysterious person.&lt;ref name=cvg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=263225|title=Wii Interview: Metroid: Other M|date=September 6, 2010|first=Tom|last=Pakinkis|work=[[Computer and Video Games]]|accessdate=September 13, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910230316/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=263225|archivedate=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakamoto and Team Ninja put much focus on backstory in the game to present Samus as an "appealing human character",&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt; something important for future installments, as players would get further interest in Samus' adventures.&lt;ref name=cvg/&gt; Hayashi said that one of the development team's goals was to have the player "connect with Samus as the story and action develops".&lt;ref name=devvideo/&gt; Sakamoto also said the game would "bring everyone up to the same level of understanding in the Metroid universe", and would not only introduce the series to new players but also create new challenges for fans.&lt;ref name=joystiq&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/03/12/interview-metroid-other-m-producer-yoshio-sakamoto/ |title=Interview: Metroid: Other M producer Yoshio Sakamoto |first=Christopher |last=Grant |date=March 12, 2010 |publisher=Engadget |accessdate=October 23, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Xmd6dTW2?url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/12/interview-metroid-other-m-producer-yoshio-sakamoto/ |archivedate=April 14, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chronological setting between ''Super Metroid'' and ''Metroid Fusion'' was chosen because Sakamoto considered the period "so critical that without addressing it, we wouldn't be able to make new games that show Samus' adventures that take place after the events of ''Metroid Fusion''".&lt;ref name="usatoday_q_and_a" /&gt;

D-Rockets, a company specialized in [[Computer-generated imagery|CG]] animation for video games and commercials, was brought into the project for its in-game cinematics on Team Ninja productions. Director Ryuji Kitaura said when Nintendo gave him the instructions, he considered the work "overwhelming" - most of D-Rockets work only involved high-quality CG, while Nintendo aimed to "make the parts of the game that the player controls the same quality as the cinematics, in order to make them seamless" and Sakamoto intended to cutscenes to give emotional depth to Samus.&lt;ref name=iwata/&gt; Team Ninja and D-Rockets worked separately most of the time, and only started to collaborate about a year into production, to make sure the in-game action and the cutscenes had the same style.&lt;ref name=devvideo&gt;{{cite video|people=Yoshio Sakamoto, Yosuke Hayashi, Ryuji Kitaura|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/23944/sakamoto-hayashi-and-kitaura-discuss-other-m|title=The Challenge of Project M: Metroid: Other M|work=[[Nintendo]]|type=Interview|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 300 [[storyboard]]s which took six months to be completed, and ten teams were employed on the development of cutscenes. For increased realism, professional [[camera operator]]s helped with the [[motion capture]], and Samus' face had a more detailed frame to make expressions more lifelike.&lt;ref name=iwata/&gt; Kitaura tried to include more scenes with Samus outside her [[Powered exoskeleton|powered armor]], to illustrate "the human, weak side of Samus, her expressions and gesture", but Sakamoto convinced him otherwise with a declaration that the Power Suit acts as a shield for both enemy attacks and the reveal of her emotions.&lt;ref name=devvideo/&gt; ''Other M'' uses a dual-layer disc due to extensive usage of cinematics in the game.&lt;ref name="iwata2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Metroid-Other-M/Vol-2-Development-Staff/1-Making-a-Game-with-Nintendo/1-Making-a-Game-with-Nintendo-207274.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6a0xuSuF2?url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Metroid-Other-M/Vol-2-Development-Staff/1-Making-a-Game-with-Nintendo/1-Making-a-Game-with-Nintendo-207274.html |title=Iwata Asks: Metroid: Other M Vol. 2 - Development Staff |publisher=Nintendo of Europe |accessdate=July 14, 2015 |archivedate=July 14, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nintendoworldreport.com/news/23914 |title=Metroid: Other M to Use Dual-Layer Disc |first=Pedro |last=Hernandez |work=[[Nintendo World Report]] |date=August 24, 2010 |accessdate=November 8, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Xmdf2317?url=https://nintendoworldreport.com/news/23914/metroid-other-m-to-use-dual-layer-disc |archivedate=April 14, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audio===
[[Kuniaki Haishima]] composed the soundtrack of ''Other M''. The team hired Haishima to write the music because the producers felt he could "tell the story with melodies" and "powerfully [helped] us depict Samus' feelings and emotions".&lt;ref name=iwata/&gt; Parts of the soundtrack were recorded and performed by Arigat-Orchestra in Tokyo and Asian Philharmonic Orchestra in Beijing.&lt;ref name="jpcredits" /&gt; Furthermore, a "piece of [[piano]] music" was made by a member of staff at Sakamoto's request.&lt;ref name="iwata2" /&gt;

For the game's voice acting, Jessica Martin&lt;!--Please don't link to the Wikipedia article titled "Jessica Martin" since that's a different actress.--&gt; was cast to play Samus in the English version of ''Other M'', and said that recording sessions took over a year which resulted in the voice cast being required to record lines with storyboards and unfinished cutscenes as basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOZeapJn9z8|title=Metroid: Other M Jessica Martin Interview|type=interview|work=[[Nintendo of America]]|date=December 2, 2010|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Malkovich was voiced by Dave Elvin; while Mike McGillicuty provided the voice of Anthony Higgs.&lt;ref name="jpcredits" /&gt; In Japanese, voice actors [[Ai Kobayashi]], [[Rikiya Koyama]], [[Kenji Nomura]] and [[Shizuka Itō]] provided the voices of Samus, Adam, Anthony and MB respectively.&lt;ref name=devvideo /&gt;&lt;ref name="jpcredits" /&gt; [[Seattle]]-based [[Bad Animals Studio]] and [[Ginza]]-based [[Onkio Haus]] recorded voice-overs in [[English language|English]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] languages respectively.&lt;ref name="jpcredits"&gt;{{cite video game |title=Metroid: Other M ||developer=[[Nintendo]]|developer2=[[Team Ninja]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=September 2, 2010 |language=Japanese |platform=[[Wii]] |scene=Theater Mode - Chapter 26 / Staff credits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing and release==
''Metroid: Other M'' was first announced by Nintendo of America president and CEO [[Reggie Fils-Aimé]] and a trailer was briefly shown during the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Breckon |first=Nick |title=Team Ninja's 'Metroid: Other M' Announced |publisher=[[Shacknews]] |date=June 2, 2009 |accessdate=June 3, 2009 |url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/58948}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fils-Aimé stated that ''Metroid: Other M'' would "take you deeper into Samus' story",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Levi |last=Buchanan |title=E3 2009: Metroid: Other M Unveiled |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/989/989404p1.html |publisher=IGN |date=June 2, 2009 |accessdate=June 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also noted that the game would be a return to the style of the traditional series as opposed to the ''[[Metroid Prime]]'' series, though the game would have a "harder edge".&lt;ref name=e3video&gt;{{cite web |last=Fletcher |first=JC |title=Interview: Reggie Fils-Aime |publisher=GameSpot |date=June 10, 2009 |accessdate=September 13, 2010 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/videos/interview-reggie-fils-aime/2300-6211815/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010|E3 2010]], the game had a playable demo, which [[GameTrailers]] picked as Best Wii Game and Action/Adventure Game of the expo, and was nominated for Game of the Show.&lt;ref name="GTbestwiigame"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/best-wii-best-of-e3/701401|title=Best of E3 2010 Awards - Best Wii Game|publisher=[[GameTrailers]]|date=July 2, 2010|accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GTgameoftheshow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/game-of-best-of-e3/701407|title=Best of E3 2010 Awards - Game of the Show|publisher=[[GameTrailers]]|date=July 2, 2010|accessdate=December 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previews of ''Other M'' were also featured in the 2010 editions of [[Game Developers Conference]] and Nintendo Media Summit.&lt;ref name="ignhandson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techland.time.com/2010/03/15/gdc-2010-hands-on-with-metroid-other-m/|title=GDC 2010: Hands-On with Metroid: Other M|first=Evan|last=Narcisse|date=March 15, 2010|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fils-Aimé expected global sales of between 1.5 and 2 million units.&lt;ref name=e3video/&gt;

Heavy criticism was directed toward the script, dialogue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/story-criticized-but-action-delivers-in-metroid-other-m-reviews-2066949.html|title=Story criticized but action delivers in 'Metroid: Other M' reviews|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=August 30, 2010|accessdate=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cutscene length.&lt;ref name=mtv/&gt; McShea felt that the unskippable cutscenes and "the overabundance of story in ''Other M'' were a negative deviation from ''Metroid'' tradition".&lt;ref name="GSreview" /&gt; Kollar states that they "often run as long as 15 minutes, exhausting players with repetition of obvious plot points and overwrought dialogue as mature and interesting as a teenager’s diary".&lt;ref name="GIreviewUS" /&gt; Justin Haywald of ''[[1UP.com]]'' complained that as the game progresses "instead of getting more of the things that work {{bracket|combat}}, you get more of the things you don't care about {{bracket|overwrought story}}".&lt;ref name="1UPreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/metroid-review |date=August 27, 2010 |title=Metroid Other M Review |publisher=1UP.com |last=Haywald |first=Justin |accessdate=March 25, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XHUpUe9t?url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/metroid-review |archivedate=March 25, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Donlan notes that the plot is considered as "the future's dumbest [[soap opera]]".&lt;ref name="eurogamer"/&gt; Wolinsky echoes the misgivings about Samus' immaturity, petulant behavior, and misguided loyalty.&lt;ref name="TheAVClub" /&gt; Tae K.

In a feature for ''1UP.com'', Jeremy Parish states that many ''Metroid'' fans were disappointed by the game's story, power-up restrictions and its "awkward handling of its leading lady".&lt;ref name=1UPDialOtherM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/metroid-other-m-post-mortem|title=Dial Other M for Murder: Is the Metroid Series Dead?|date=May 25, 2011|work=1UP.com|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=September 1, 2017|first=Jeremy|last=Parish|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018170753/http://www.1up.com/features/metroid-other-m-post-mortem|archivedate=October 18, 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video game scholar Luke Arnott argued that players were dissatisfied with ''Other M'' because it did not consistently balance gameplay constraints with player agency, and because it failed at what he calls “imperative” storytelling. Arnott suggested that studying how games like ''Other M'' create meaning in virtual spaces may help design better games and situate them within wider theories of postmodern subjectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arnott|first=L.|date=2017-01-01|title=Mapping Metroid: Narrative, Space, and Other M|url=http://gac.sagepub.com/cgi/doi/10.1177/1555412015580016|journal=Games and Culture|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=3–27|doi=10.1177/1555412015580016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clyde Mandelin of ''Legends of Localization'' noted that the game received mixed-to-positive reactions from Japanese fans.&lt;ref name="LegendsOfLocalization"&gt;{{cite web|title=What Does Japan Think of Metroid: Other M?|first=Clyde|last=Mandelin|url=http://legendsoflocalization.com/what-does-japan-think-of-metroid-other-m/|publisher=Legends of Localization|date=September 3, 2013|accessdate=December 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kotaku]]''{{'}}s Luke Plunkett wrote that Team Ninja was blamed by "many people" for the game's story;&lt;ref name=KotakuBlameNintendo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5843159/blame-nintendo-for-metroid-other-ms-sucky-story|title=Don’t Blame Team Ninja for Metroid: Other M’s Story|date=September 23, 2011|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|work=[[Kotaku]]|accessdate=October 6, 2011|first=Luke |last=Plunkett}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayashi later clarified that Sakamoto wrote the story himself.&lt;ref name=KotakuBlameNintendo /&gt;&lt;ref name="HayashiInterview"&gt;{{cite web| title=Team Ninja's Yosuke Hayashi Talks Ninja Gaiden 3| url=http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/716536/team-ninjas-yosuke-hayashi-talks-ninja-gaiden-3/#ixzz1YkFVArKB| publisher=[[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4 Media, Inc.]]| date=September 21, 2011| accessdate=October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nintendo Treehouse producer [[Nate Bihldorff]] stated that the scene depicting Samus' encounter with Ridley "is not a sign of weakness, but of strength.

The typical usage cases are connecting models developed for different simulators and connecting a parallel simulator to a post-processing tool.

MUSIC provides a standardized software interface ([[API]]) on top of the message-passing interface ([[Message Passing Interface|MPI]]) for communication among parallel applications for large-scale [[computational neuroscience]] simulations. It enables the transfer of massive amounts of event information and continuous values from one parallel application to another, including those using different data allocation strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12021-010-9064-z|title = Run-Time Interoperability Between Neuronal Network Simulators Based on the MUSIC Framework|last = Djurfeldt|first = Mikael|date = 2010-03-02|journal = Neuroinformatics|doi = 10.1007/s12021-010-9064-z|pmid = 20195795|access-date = 2015-11-20|volume=8|pmc=2846392|pages=43–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the design of the standard interface, care was taken to allow easy adaptation of existing simulators and to permit third-party development and community-sharing of reusable and interoperable software tools for parallel processing.

'''Naiad''' is a [[fictional]] [[Water (classical element)|water]] [[elemental]] published by [[DC Comics]]. She first appeared in ''[[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm, the Nuclear Man]]'' vol. 2 #90 (October 1989), during the four part ''Elemental War'' storyline that ran to issue #93, and was created by [[John Ostrander]] and [[Tom Mandrake]].

==Fictional character biography==
Mai Miyazaki was a Japanese [[environmentalist]] who was murdered by operatives of the '''Shogun Oil Company'''. While protesting at a Shogun Oil [[drilling rig]] in the sea off the coast of [[Alaska]], she was set on fire by a Shogun Oil employee under orders from his superior. The employee deliberately fires a [[flare gun]] into the [[oil spill]] surrounding her [[Inflatable boat|dingy]]. Mai died but was reborn as the Water Elemental Naiad. She destroys the drilling rig but oil and other chemicals which spill into the waters poison her, and drive her mad. Enraged and out of control Naiad attacks Firestorm because he is the incarnation of fire, and the last thing she remembers is death by fire.&lt;ref&gt;''Firestorm, the Nuclear Man'' #90&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:maya2dcu0.jpg|thumb|left|75px|Maya from Firestorm vol. 2 #92, artist [[Tom Mandrake]]]]
[[Swamp Thing]] begins looking for [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] (Ronnie Raymond/Mikhail Arkadin) because his attempts to [[Terraforming|terraform]] and heal an African desert valley which ended up mutating and scarring the "Green". Firestorm is able to temporarily calm a mindless Naiad and a discorporate [[Red Tornado]], both of whom were being pushed to attack humanity due to pain being caused them by poisons in the air and water, they believed the only way to "heal the planet" was by eliminating humanity. Naiad and the Red Tornado discover that ''no elemental can attack another elemental directly'', so they use earth to bury Firestorm underwater and head for [[Japan]] intending to terminate the island nation's entire population.&lt;ref name="FNM91"&gt;''Firestorm, the Nuclear Man'' #91&lt;/ref&gt; 

A drowning Firestorm is apparently contacted in a vision by '''Maya'' the "Earth Mother" who tells him that she created the "Four Elementals" to both guard her body and inspire mankind. She tells him that the job of an Elemental is to force mankind to evolve and leave their homeworld, she supports the actions of Naiad and the Red Tornado. Firestorm is saved from drowning by the Swamp Thing, according to Swamp Thing Firestorm's transmutation powers weaken the cellular makeup of matter, making it unstable. So at the Swamp Thing's request he burns the blighted plant life he created in an African valley. Swamp Thing and Firestorm head to [[Tokyo]] intent on stopping their fellow elementals.&lt;ref&gt;''Firestorm, the Nuclear Man'' #92&lt;/ref&gt; 

The attack on Tokyo by Naiad and Red Tornado is halted by Swamp Thing forming a shield over the city out of his body. Firestorm increases his body mass by absorbing heat and flames until he is the same expanded size as the other three elementals. During a pause in the battle he recounts his meeting with Maya to the other elementals. Naiad agrees to forgo her attack and leaves, and Firestorm creates a new corporeal body for the Red Tornado.&lt;ref&gt;''Firestorm, the Nuclear Man'' #93&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later, Naiad attempted to get revenge on Shogun Oil, but was stopped by [[Superman]] and the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Spectre'' vol. 3 #19-22&lt;/ref&gt; As Naiad, Mai Miyazaki is the elemental of [[Water (classical element)|water]] for the planet Earth. The '''Parliament of Waves''', is a group made up of older Water Elementals. The five Elemental Parliaments (Trees, Waves, Stone, Flames, Vapors) were destroyed by a Spectre level being called [[The Word (comics)|The Word]]. Naiad shares the title of "Elemental" with Firestorm the elemental of ([[Fire (classical element)|fire]]), Red Tornado the elemental of ([[Air (classical element)|air]]), and Swamp Thing the elemental of ([[Flora|plants]]).

She also appeared in [[Aquaman]] where she fought an intermediate fire elemental named '''Corona'''. Corona is the mother of Aquaman's son Koryak, and apparently became the Earth's fire elemental while Martin Stein was traveling through [[outer space]].&lt;ref&gt;''Aquaman'' vol. 5 #8 (April 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

She recently appeared during the ''[[Brightest Day]]'' crossover event, where she was one of the metahumans driven insane by [[Alan Scott]]'s Starheart powers. She attempted to destroy [[Gotham City]] using massive tidal wave, but was defeated and knocked unconscious by the duo of [[Dick Grayson|Batman]] II and [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]].&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #46&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "[[Watchmen]]" sequel "[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]," Naiad is listed as a member of Japan's superhero team called [[Big Science Action|Big Monster Action]].&lt;ref&gt;''Doomsday Clock'' #6 (July 2018). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
* Naiad is Earth's current Water Elemental. She can "teleport" by manifesting in small or large bodies of water anywhere on Earth.
* She can control all water in her immediate vicinity, but is mentally affected by [[pollutant]]s in water she uses to make up her body.
* Mai is connected to a section of the ''Morphogenetic field'' known as the ''Blue'' or the ''Clear''.
* No elemental can attack another elemental directly.&lt;ref name="FNM91"/&gt;

The '''National Institutes of Health''' ('''NIH''') ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|n|aɪ|ˈ|eɪ|tʃ}}; each letter separately) is the primary agency of the [[United States government]] responsible for [[biomedical]] and [[public health]] research. It was founded in the late 1870s and is now part of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]. The majority of NIH facilities are located in [[Bethesda, Maryland]]. The NIH conducts its own scientific research through its [[NIH Intramural Research Program|Intramural Research Program]] (IRP) and provides major biomedical research funding to non-NIH research facilities through its Extramural Research Program.

{{As of| 2013}}, the IRP had 1,200 [[principal investigator]]s and more than 4,000 [[postdoctoral]] fellows in basic, translational, and clinical research, being the largest biomedical research institution in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://irp.nih.gov/about-us/organization-and-leadership |title=Organization and Leadership &amp;#124; NIH Intramural Research Program |publisher=Irp.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424005609/http://irp.nih.gov/about-us/organization-and-leadership |archivedate=April 24, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while, as of 2003, the extramural arm provided 28% of biomedical research funding spent annually in the U.S., or about US$26.4 billion.&lt;ref name="Medical Research Spending Doubled Over Past Decade"&gt;{{cite web |first=Neil |last=Osterweil |url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/HealthPolicy/1767 |title=Medical Research Spending Doubled Over Past Decade |website=MedPage Today |date=September 20, 2005 |accessdate=2015-09-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016073042/http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/HealthPolicy/1767 |archivedate=October 16, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NIH comprises [[List of institutes and centers of the National Institutes of Health|27 separate institutes and centers]] of different biomedical disciplines and is responsible for many scientific accomplishments, including the discovery of fluoride to prevent [[tooth decay]], the use of [[lithium]] to manage [[bipolar disorder]], and the creation of vaccines against [[hepatitis]], ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' (HIB), and [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV).&lt;ref&gt;NIH Sourcebook {{cite web |url=http://sourcebook.od.nih.gov/oir/IRP_transition.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105120850/http://sourcebook.od.nih.gov/oir/IRP_transition.pdf |archivedate=January 5, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NIH's roots extend back to the [[Marine Hospital Service]] in the late 1790s that provided medical relief to sick and disabled men in the U.S. Navy. By 1870, a network of marine hospitals had developed and was placed under the charge of a medical officer within the Bureau of the Treasury Department. In the late 1870s, Congress allocated funds to investigate the causes of epidemics like cholera and yellow fever, and it created the National Board of Health, making [[medical research]] an official government initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NIH Almanac|2011|loc=[http://www.nih.gov/about/almanac/historical/chronology_of_events.htm#eighteenhundred History: Chronology of Events: 1800–]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1887, a laboratory for the study of bacteria, the Hygienic Laboratory, was established at the Marine Hospital in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.nih.gov/exhibits/history/index.html |title=A Short History of the National Institutes of Health (1 of 13) |publisher=history.nih.gov |accessdate=2011-05-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515022655/http://history.nih.gov/exhibits/history/index.html |archivedate=May 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/industries/Public-Administration/Administration-Public-Health-Programs.html |title=SIC 9431 Administration of Public Health Programs |publisher=Referenceforbusiness.com |accessdate=2011-05-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510114137/http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/industries/Public-Administration/Administration-Public-Health-Programs.html |archivedate=May 10, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1900s, Congress began appropriating funds for the Marine Hospital Service. By 1922, this organization changed its name to Public Health Services and established a Special Cancer Investigations laboratory at [[Harvard Medical School]]. This marked the beginning of a partnership with universities. In 1930, the Hygienic Laboratory was re-designated as the National Institute of Health by the [[Ransdell Act]], and was given $750,000 to construct two NIH buildings. Over the next few decades, Congress would increase funding tremendously to the NIH, and various institutes and centers within the NIH were created for specific research programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NIH Almanac|2011|loc=[http://www.nih.gov/about/almanac/historical/chronology_of_events.htm#nineteenten History: Chronology of Events: 1900–]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, the [[Public Health Service Act]] was approved, and the [[National Cancer Institute]] became a division of NIH. In 1948, the name changed from National Institute of Health to National Institutes of Health.

In the 1960s, virologist and cancer researcher [[Chester M. Southam]] injected [[HeLa]] cancer cells into patients at the Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital.&lt;ref name="Broadway Paperbacks"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skloot|first1=Rebecca|title=The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks|date=2010|publisher=Broadway Paperbacks|location=New York|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|130}} When three doctors resigned after refusing to inject patients without their consent, the experiment gained considerable media attention.&lt;ref name="Broadway Paperbacks"/&gt;{{rp|133}} The NIH was a major source of funding for Southam’s research and had required all research involving human subjects to obtain their consent prior to any experimentation.&lt;ref name="Broadway Paperbacks"/&gt;{{rp|135}} Upon investigating all of their grantee institutions, the NIH discovered that the majority of them did not protect the rights of human subjects. From then on, the NIH has required all grantee institutions to approve any research proposals involving human experimentation with review boards.&lt;ref name="Broadway Paperbacks"/&gt;{{rp|135}}

In 1967, the Division of Regional Medical Programs was created to administer grants for research for heart disease, cancer, and strokes. That same year, the NIH director lobbied the White House for increased federal funding in order to increase research and the speed with which health benefits could be brought to the people. An advisory committee was formed to oversee further development of the NIH and its research programs. By 1971 cancer research was in full force and President Nixon signed the [[National Cancer Act]], initiating a National Cancer Program, President's Cancer Panel, National Cancer Advisory Board, and 15 new research, training, and demonstration centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=History of the National Cancer Institute| publisher=National Cancer Institute{{snd}}National Institutes of Health| url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/overview/history#1971| accessdate=June 29, 2017| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628185858/https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/overview/history#1971| archivedate=June 28, 2017| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for the NIH has often been a source of contention in Congress, serving as a proxy for the political currents of the time. In 1992, the NIH encompassed nearly 1 percent of the federal government's operating budget and controlled more than 50 percent of all funding for health research, and 85 percent of all funding for health studies in universities.&lt;ref name="Laurie J. Price 1992 128–146"&gt;{{cite journal|title= A Medical Anthropologist's Ruminations on NIH Funding|author=Laurie J. Price |journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly, New Series| volume= 6| issue= 2| year=1992 | pages= 128–146 |jstor=649307}}&lt;/ref&gt; While government funding for research in other disciplines has been increasing at a rate similar to inflation since the 1970s, research funding for the NIH nearly tripled through the 1990s and early 2000s, but has remained relatively stagnant since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Trends in Federal R&amp;D|url=https://www.aaas.org/page/historical-trends-federal-rd|website=AAAS - The World's Largest General Scientific Society|language=en|date=11 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110055211/https://www.aaas.org/page/historical-trends-federal-rd|archivedate=January 10, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1990s, the NIH committee focus had shifted to DNA research, and launched the [[Human Genome Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/25520329/online-education-kit-1990-launch-of-the-human-genome-project/|title=Online Education Kit: 1990: Launch of the Human Genome Project|website=National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, 153 scientists receiving financial support from the NIH have been awarded a [[Nobel Prize]] and 195 have been awarded a [[Lasker Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lasker Awards|url=https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-almanac/lasker-awards|website=National Institutes of Health (NIH)|language=en|date=5 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705023514/https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-almanac/lasker-awards|archivedate=July 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intramural research ===
NIH devotes 10% of its funding to research within its own facilities (intramural research). The institution gives 80% of its funding in [[research grant]]s to extramural (outside) researchers. Of this extramural funding, a certain percentage (2.8% in 2014) must be granted to small businesses under the [[Small Business Innovation Research|SBIR/STTR]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garland|first=Eva|title=Winning SBIR/STTR Grants: A Ten Week Plan for Preparing Your NIH Phase I Application|date=2014|isbn=978-1494784447}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The extramural funding consists of about 50,000 grants to more than 325,000 researchers at more than 3000 institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIH Budget|url=http://www.nih.gov/about/budget.htm|website=National Institutes of Health|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=2011-08-26|date=May 23, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826201557/http://www.nih.gov/about/budget.htm|archivedate=August 26, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2010|alt=In [[fiscal year|FY]] 2010}}, NIH spent {{US$|10.7bn}} (not including temporary funding from the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]) on [[clinical research]], {{US$|7.4bn}} on [[genetics]]-related research, {{US$|6.0bn}} on prevention research, {{US$|5.8bn}} on cancer, and {{US$|5.7bn}} on [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref name=researchfunding&gt;{{cite web|title=Estimates of Funding for Various Research, Condition, and Disease Categories (RCDC) |url=http://report.nih.gov/rcdc/categories/Default.aspx |website=Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools |publisher=National Institutes of Health |accessdate=2011-08-26 |date=March 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813065343/http://report.nih.gov/rcdc/categories/Default.aspx |archivedate=August 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public Access Policy===
{{main|NIH Public Access Policy}}
In 2008 a Congressional mandate called for investigators funded by the NIH to submit an electronic version of their final manuscripts to the [[National Library of Medicine]]'s research repository, [[PubMed Central]] (PMC), no later than 12 months after the official date of publication.&lt;ref name="NIH Public Access Policy"&gt;{{cite web|last=National Institutes of Health|title=NIH Public Access Policy Details|url=http://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=January 30, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62vO48RCv?url=http://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm|archivedate=November 3, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[NIH Public Access Policy]] was the first public access mandate for a U.S. public funding agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suber|first=Peter|title=An open access mandate for the National Institutes of Health|journal=Open Medicine|date=April 16, 2008|volume=2|issue=2|pages=e39–41|pmc=3090178|pmid=21602938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NIH Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee===
On February 13, 2012, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced a new group of individuals assigned to research pain. This committee is composed of researchers from different organizations and will focus to "coordinate pain research activities across the federal government with the goals of stimulating pain research collaboration… and providing an important avenue for public involvement" ("Members of new," 2012). With a committee such as this research will not be conducted by each individual organization or person but instead a collaborating group which will increase the information available. With this hopefully more pain management will be available including techniques for arthritis sufferers.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Economic return===
In 2000, the Joint Economic Committee of Congress reported NIH research, which was funded at $16 billion a year in 2000, that some econometric studies had given a rate of return of 25 to 40 percent per year by reducing the economic cost of illness in the US. It found that of the 21 drugs with the highest therapeutic impact on society introduced between 1965 and 1992, public funding was "instrumental" for 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=U.S. Joint Economic Committee |date=May 2000 |url=http://www.faseb.org/portals/2/pdfs/opa/2008/nih_research_benefits.pdf |title=The Benefits of Medical Research and the Role of the NIH |accessdate=2011-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412003136/http://www.faseb.org/portals/2/pdfs/opa/2008/nih_research_benefits.pdf |archivedate=April 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011 NIH-supported research helped to discover 153 new FDA-approved drugs, vaccines, and new indications for drugs in the 40 years prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stevens |first=A.

===Notable discoveries and developments ===
Since its inception, the NIH intramural research program has been a source of many pivotal scientific and medical discoveries. Some of these include:
* 1908 – [[George W. McCoy]]'s discovery that rodents were a reservoir of [[bubonic plague]].
* 1911 – George W. McCoy, Charles W. Chapin, William B. Wherry, and B. H. Lamb described the previously-unknown [[tularemia]].
* 1924 – Roscoe R. Spencer and Ralph R. Parker developed a vaccine against [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]].
* 1930 – Sanford M. Rosenthal developed a treatment for [[mercury poisoning]] used widely before the development of dimercaptoethanol.
* 1943 – Wilton R. Earle pioneered the [[cell culture]] process and published a paper describing the production of malignancy in vitro, Katherine K. Sanford developed the first clone from an isolated cancer cell, and Virginia J. Evans devised a medium that supported growth of cells in vitro.
* 1940's-50's – Bernard Horecker and colleagues described the [[pentose phosphate pathway]].
* 1950's – [[Julius Axelrod]] discovered a new class of enzymes, [[cytochrome P450]] monooxygenases, a fundamental of drug metabolism.

* 1960s – Discovered the first human slow virus disease, kuru, which is a degenerative, fatal infection of the central nervous system. This discovery of a new mechanism for infectious diseases revolutionized thinking in microbiology and neurology.
* 1960s – Defined the mechanisms that regulate noradrenaline, one of the most important neurotransmitters in the brain.
* 1960s – Developed the first licensed rubella vaccine and the first test for rubella antibodies for large scale testing.
* 1960s – Developed an effective combination drug regimen for [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]].
* 1960s – Discovery that tooth decay is caused by bacteria. 
* 1970s – Developed the assay for [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] that evolved into the home pregnancy tests.
* 1970s – Described the hormonal cycle involved in menstruation. 
* 1980s – Determined the complete structure of the [[IgE receptor]] that is involved in allergic reactions. 
* 1990s – First trial of [[gene therapy]] in humans.

====NIH Toolbox====
In September 2006, the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research started a contract for the [[NIH Toolbox]] for the Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function to develop a set of state-of-the-art measurement tools to enhance collection of data in large cohort studies. Scientists from more than 100 institutions nationwide contributed. In September 2012, the NIH Toolbox was rolled out to the research community. NIH Toolbox assessments are based, where possible, on [[Item Response Theory]] and adapted for testing by computer.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

To allocate funds, the NIH must first obtain its budget from Congress. This process begins with institute and center (IC) leaders collaborating with scientists to determine the most important and promising research areas within their fields. IC leaders discuss research areas with NIH management who then develops a budget request for continuing projects, new research proposals, and new initiatives from the Director. NIH submits its budget request to the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS), and the HHS considers this request as a portion of its budget. Many adjustments and appeals occur between NIH and HHS before the agency submits NIH's budget request to the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB).  OMB determines what amounts and research areas are approved for incorporation into the President's final budget. The President then sends NIH's budget request to Congress in February for the next fiscal year's allocations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Funding|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33695.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060502/http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33695.pdf|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees deliberate and by fall, Congress usually appropriates funding. This process takes approximately 18 months before the NIH can allocate any actual funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Funding|url=http://officeofbudget.od.nih.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207114012/http://officeofbudget.od.nih.gov/|archivedate=December 7, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Historical funding ====
Over the last century, the responsibility to allocate funding has shifted from the OD and Advisory Committee to the individual ICs and Congress increasingly set apart funding for particular causes. In the 1970s, Congress began to earmark funds specifically for cancer research, and in the 1980s there was a significant amount allocated for AIDS/HIV research.&lt;ref name="Funding" /&gt;

Funding for the NIH has often been a source of contention in Congress, serving as a proxy for the political currents of the time. During the 1980s, President Reagan repeatedly tried to cut funding for research, only to see Congress partly restore funding. The political contention over NIH funding slowed the nation's response to the AIDS epidemic; while AIDS was reported in newspaper articles from 1981, no funding was provided for research on the disease. In 1984 National Cancer Institute scientists found implications that "variants of a human cancer virus called HTLV-III are the primary cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)," a new epidemic that gripped the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NIH Almanac|2011|loc=[http://www.nih.gov/about/almanac/historical/chronology_of_events.htm#nineteeneighty History: Chronology of Events: 1980–]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1992, the NIH encompassed nearly 1 percent of the federal government's operating budget and controlled more than 50 percent of all funding for health research and 85 percent of all funding for health studies in universities.&lt;ref name="Laurie J. Price 1992 128–146"/&gt; From 1993 to 2001 the NIH budget doubled. Since then, funding essentially remained flat, and during the decade following the financial crisis, the NIH budget struggled to keep up with inflation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-almanac/appropriations-section-1 NIH Appropriations (Section 1)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507125120/https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-almanac/appropriations-section-1 |date=May 7, 2017 }} and [https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-almanac/appropriations-section-2 NIH Appropriations (Section 2)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105133440/https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-almanac/appropriations-section-2 |date=January 5, 2018 }} 7 April 2016, retrieved 4 May 2016, U.S. Department of Health and Human Service&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 Congress increased the NIH's budget by $2.3 billion&lt;ref name="Funding"&gt;{{harvnb|NIH Almanac|2011|loc=[http://nih.gov/about/almanac/historical/legislative_chronology.htm History: Legislative Chronology: Funding]}}&lt;/ref&gt; to $17.2 billion in 2000.&lt;ref name="OfficeOfBudget"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://officeofbudget.od.nih.gov/pdfs/FY13/spending%20list/Mechanism%20Detail%20for%20Total%20NIH%20FY%202000%20-%20FY%202011.pdf|title=Funding|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215111157/http://officeofbudget.od.nih.gov/pdfs/FY13/spending%20list/Mechanism%20Detail%20for%20Total%20NIH%20FY%202000%20-%20FY%202011.pdf|archivedate=February 15, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Congress again increased the NIH budget to $31 billion in 2010.&lt;ref name="OfficeOfBudget" /&gt; In March 2017, President Trump proposed to cut the 2018 budget by 18.3%, or about $5.8 billion to $25.9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Office of Management and Budget [https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BUDGET-2018-BLUEPRINT/pdf/BUDGET-2018-BLUEPRINT.pdf America First.

===Extramural research===
{{main|NIH grant}}
Researchers at universities or other institutions outside of NIH can apply for [[NIH grants|research project grants]] (RPGs) from the NIH. There are numerous funding mechanisms for different project types (e.g., basic research, clinical research etc.) and career stages (e.g., early career, postdoc fellowships etc.). The NIH regularly issues "requests for applications" (RFAs), e.g., on timely medical problems (such as [[Zika virus]] research in early 2016). In addition, researchers can apply for "investigator-initiated grants" whose subject is determined by the scientist.

The total number of applicants has increased substantially, from about 60,000 investigators who had applied during the period from 1999 to 2003 to slightly less than 90,000 in who had applied during the period from 2011 to 2015.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2016/05/31/how-many-researchers/|title=How Many Researchers?|last=Lauer|first=Mike|date=31 May 2016|website=Open Mike|publisher=NIH|access-date=6 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825174823/https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2016/05/31/how-many-researchers/|archivedate=August 25, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, the "cumulative investigator rate," that is, the likelihood that unique investigators are funded over a 5-year window, has declined from 43% to 31%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

R01 grants are the most common funding mechanism and include investigator-initiated projects. The roughly 27,000 to 29,000 R01 applications had a funding success of 17-19% during 2012 though 2014. Similarly, the 13,000 to 14,000 R21 applications had a funding success of 13-14% during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2015/04/10/looking-at-recent-data-on-r21-and-r01-equivalent-grants/|title=Looking at Recent Data on R21 and R01-equivalent Grants|last=Rockey|first=Sally|date=10 April 2015|website=Rock Talk|publisher=NIH|access-date=2 Oct 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008215446/https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2015/04/10/looking-at-recent-data-on-r21-and-r01-equivalent-grants/|archivedate=October 8, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In FY 2016, the total number of grant applications received by the NIH was 54,220, with approximately 19% being awarded funding.&lt;ref name=2016funding&gt;{{cite web|title=NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORT)|url=https://report.nih.gov/success_rates/Success_ByIC.cfm|website=report.nih.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202133251/https://report.nih.gov/success_rates/Success_ByIC.cfm|archivedate=February 2, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutes have varying funding rates. The National Cancer Institute awarded funding to 12% of applicants, while the National Institute for General Medical Science awarded funding to 30% of applicants.&lt;ref name=2016funding/&gt;

===Funding criteria===
NIH employs five broad decision criteria in its funding policy. First, ensure the highest quality of scientific research by employing an arduous peer review process. Second, seize opportunities that have the greatest potential to yield new knowledge and that will lead to better prevention and treatment of disease. Third, maintain a diverse research portfolio in order to capitalize on major discoveries in a variety of fields such as cell biology, genetics, physics, engineering, and computer science. Fourth, address public health needs according to the disease burden (e.g., prevalence and mortality). And fifth, construct and support the scientific infrastructure (e.g., well-equipped laboratories and safe research facilities) necessary to conduct research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Statement on Funding Allocation for Disease Research by Harold Varmus, M. D., Director, National Institutes of Health |publisher=Assistant Secretary for Legislation, Department of Health and Human Services |url=https://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t990506a.htm |date=May 6, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advisory committee members advise the Institute on policy and procedures affecting the external research programs and provide a second level of review for all grant and cooperative agreement applications considered by the Institute for funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/find_people/nands/index.htm |title=National Advisory Neurological Disorders and Stroke Council (NANDSC) |publisher=Ninds.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428004009/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/find_people/nands/index.htm |archivedate=April 28, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender and sex bias====

In 2014, it was announced that the NIH is directing scientists to perform their experiments with both female and male animals, or cells derived from females as well as males if they are studying cell cultures, and that the NIH would take the balance of each study design into consideration when awarding grants.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |first=Roni Caryn |last=Rabin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/15/health/nih-tells-researchers-to-end-sex-bias-in-early-studies.html |title=Labs Are Told to Start Including a Neglected Variable: Females |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 14, 2014 |accessdate=2015-09-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906202122/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/15/health/nih-tells-researchers-to-end-sex-bias-in-early-studies.html |archivedate=September 6, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement also stated that this rule would probably not apply when studying sex-specific diseases (for example, ovarian or testicular cancer).&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

===Government shutdown===

When a [[government shutdown in the United States|government shutdown]] occurs, the NIH continues to treat people who are already enrolled in [[clinical trial]]s, but does not start any new clinical trials and does not admit new patients who are not already enrolled in a clinical trial, except for the most critically ill,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/health/in-shutdown-clinical-trial-enrollment-slows-but-doesnt-halt.html|title=Clinical Trials Continue, but Only at a Crawl|author=Sabrina Tavernese|publisher=New York Times|date=October 9, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027053456/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/health/in-shutdown-clinical-trial-enrollment-slows-but-doesnt-halt.html|archivedate=October 27, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lauran|last=Neergaard|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/10/09/nih-admits-a-dozen-critic_n_4073447.html|title=NIH admits a dozen critically ill, making exceptions to no-new-patient policy during shutdown|work=Huffington Post|agency=[[The Associated Press]]|date=October 9, 2013|accessdate=2015-09-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301013202/http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/10/09/nih-admits-a-dozen-critic_n_4073447.html|archivedate=March 1, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/10/02/government-slimdown-blocks-some-seeking-nih-research-treatment/|title=Government slimdown blocks some seeking NIH research treatment|work=[[Fox News Channel]]|agency=The Associated Press|date=October 2, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005124430/http://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/10/02/government-slimdown-blocks-some-seeking-nih-research-treatment/|archivedate=October 5, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as determined by the NIH Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/budget/fy2014/fy2014contingency_staffing_plan-rev6.pdf |title=Department of Health and Human Services Fiscal Year 2014 Contingency Staffing Plan for Operations in the Absence of Enacted Annual Appropriations |format=pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028125958/http://www.hhs.gov/budget/fy2014/fy2014contingency_staffing_plan-rev6.pdf |archivedate=October 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stakeholders===

====General public====
One of the goals of the NIH is to "expand the base in medical and associated sciences in order to ensure a continued high return on the public investment in research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stakeholders|url=http://www.nih.gov/about/mission.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125135014/http://www.nih.gov/about/mission.htm|archivedate=November 25, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Taxpayer dollars funding NIH are from the taxpayers, making them the primary beneficiaries of advances in research. Thus, the general public is a key stakeholder in the decisions resulting from the NIH funding policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stakeholders |url=http://acd.od.nih.gov/Roster.asp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114231545/http://acd.od.nih.gov/Roster.asp |archivedate=November 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some in the general public do not feel their interests are being represented, and individuals have formed patient advocacy groups to represent their own interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stakeholders|url=https://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t990506a.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104113818/http://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t990506a.html|archivedate=November 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Extramural researchers and scientists====
Important stakeholders of the NIH funding policy include researchers and scientists. Extramural researchers differ from intramural researchers in that they are not employed by the NIH but may apply for funding. Throughout the history of the NIH, the amount of funding received has increased, but the proportion to each IC remains relatively constant. The individual ICs then decide who will receive the grant money and how much will be allotted.

Policy changes on who receives funding significantly affects researchers. For example, the NIH has recently attempted to approve more first-time NIH R01 applicants, or the research grant applications of young scientists. To encourage the participation of young scientists, the application process has been shortened and made easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Science |year=2008 |volume=322 |issue=5905 |pages=1187–8 |doi=10.1126/science.322.5905.1187c |title=Changes to NIH grant system may backfire |vauthors=Karp PD, Sherlock G, Gerlt JA, Sim I, Paulsen I, Babbitt PC, Laderoute K, Hunter L, Sternberg P, Wooley J, Bourne PE |pmid=19023064}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, first-time applicants are being offered more funding for their research grants than those who have received grants in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Acad Med |date=May 2010 |volume=85 |issue=5 |pages=775–9 |doi=10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181d74256 |pmid=20520024 |title=Perspective: is NIH funding the "best science by the best scientists"?

==Commercial partnerships==
In 2011 and 2012, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General published a series of audit reports revealing that throughout the fiscal years 2000–2010, institutes under the aegis of the NIH did not comply with the time and amount requirements specified in appropriations statutes, in awarding federal contracts to commercial partners, committing the federal government to tens of millions of dollars of expenditure ahead of appropriation of funds from Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region3/31003120.pdf | title = Appropriations Funding for National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Contract N01-AI-15416 With the University of California at San Francisco Audit (A-03-10-03120) | accessdate = 2011-06-25 | date = June 2011 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111015190017/http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region3/31003120.pdf | archivedate = October 15, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}

He was defeated and killed by the Roman general [[Promotus]].&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, V.36 seems to put this ''before'' the death of Gratian in 383, but in IV.39 he tells of Theodosius recruiting the survivors for the coming campaign against Magnus Maximus, and Claudian ''Cos. Hon IV'' 633–37 dates the victory over Odotheus by Honorius’ first consulship, i.e. 386&lt;/ref&gt; His surviving people settled in [[Phrygia]].

== Invasion of Roman Empire ==

After the major Gothic entry into the Roman Empire in 376, there still remained substantial numbers of Goths in several kingdoms north and east of the lower [[Danube]].&lt;ref&gt;Heather (1996), 56&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 386 the king Odotheus led his people into the Empire, possibly fleeing Hunnic hegemony, but Heather (1996:103) disputes this.
Odotheus was brought to battle and killed by the general Promotus.
Zosimus gives two versions  (4.35 and 4.38-9), generally thought to be of the same story; the second version calls them ''Grothingi'' and speaks of a betrayal (or entrapment) by Promotus.
The survivors of his people were settled in [[Phrygia]]; some were drafted into the [[Roman Army|Army]] and some became agricultural labourers.&lt;ref&gt;Heather (1996), n. 10 to p. 138. "Zosimus 4.35, 38-9, Cons. Const. s.a. 386 (= ''CM ''1, 244). ''captivi'': Claudian ''In Eut.'' 2.582. ''coloni'': ''ibid''. 205".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fate of Odotheus' People ==
In 399, [[Tribigild]], a Gothic commander in Roman service who led a unit of these Phrygian survivors of Odotheus' kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;Heather (1996), 144&lt;/ref&gt; rose in revolt. [[Michael Kulikowski]] suggests the Goths of Tribigild were in fact survivors of the massacres in Asia Minor of 378/9, after the [[Battle of Adrianople]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kulikowski|2006|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gainas]], another Gothic general sent to suppress him, suborned Tribigild's revolt for his own purposes. After some initial successes, Gainas was suppressed and fled north of the Danube, only to be killed by the Hunnic chieftain [[Uldin]].&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus V.21-22&lt;/ref&gt; Thus perished many of Odotheus' remaining people; the fate of the rest in Phrygia is unknown.

[[File:PM Shop in HK.jpg|thumb|A papier-mache shop in Tai Po, Hong Kong.|367x367px]]
Traditional '''papier-mache offering shops in Hong Kong''' sell papier-mache offering items for sacred purposes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Siu|first1=Kin Wai|title=Lanterns of the Mid-Autumn Festival: A Reflection of Hong Kong Cultural Change|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|volume=33|issue=2|pages=67–86|doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1999.3302_67.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for festival-celebration purposes, the popularity started since the 1940s. Nowadays, the demand of papier sacred products are lowering and thus papier-mache shops and the entire papier-mache industry are facing declination.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://file.pokok.edu.hk/~cyberfair2009/offering%20history/|title=紙紮業在香港的歷史|last=|first=|date=2009|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Papier mache shop in Hong Kong==
Papier-mache offering shops started popping up in Hong Kong since 1940. From 1940, there were high demand of papier maches and the papier-mache industry was prosperous, shops were basically ran by the whole family that they manufactured and sold the papier-mache products all by their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goldenage.hk/b5/ga/ga_article.php?article_id=674|title=紙紮進化論|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, the [[Communist Party in China]] started to simplify funeral services through education, persuasion and step-by-step measures,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ZHANG|first=WEIMIN|date=1983-10-23|title=China buries old traditions|url=|journal=South China Morning Post (1946-Current) [Hong Kong]|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  following to the [[Cultural Revolution|cultural revolution]] started from 1960, the Communist Party promoted simplism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=黃|first=延敏|date=June 2013|title=破四舊運動的發展脈絡|url=http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ics/21c/issue/articles/137_1109069.pdf|journal=Chinese University of Hong Kong|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; they simplified traditional cultures and most of the traditional funeral rites were being dissuaded in mainland. This led to the flocking in of mainland papier-mache shop-owners to Hong Kong to continue their business. After 1980, Hong Kong transformed into an International Financial Centre which promoted [[Knowledge-Based Economy|knowledge-based economy]]. People were not willing to work in papier-mache sectors, this gradually led to the declination of papier-mache industry in Hong Kong. Nowadays in Hong Kong, not only the demand of papier-mache products is low, but over one-ninth of papier-mache products sold by local papier-mache offering shops are also imported from the mainland China,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; local papier-mache offering shops doing their own production are not common nowadays.

==Papier-mache products during different occasions and target customers==
There are generally two types of usage of papier-mache products, festival papier-mache for celebration and for funeral use. Papier-mache offering shops target their customers occasionally, they provided various papier-products according to different festivals and occasions. For people who consecrate offerings, most of them are [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]].

==Festival using paper-mache offerings==
[[File:IPhone papier mache set.jpg|thumb|A set of female papier-mache offerings included iPhone and accessories.]]
[[File:SIU MEi.jpg|thumb|A papier-mache food set of 'Siu Mei' and roast suckling pig.]]
In [[Chinese New Year]], shops provide paper money, joss sticks, [[Fai Chun]] and lighted red candles for good luck inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Li|first1=Ellen|title=Chinese Festival|date=1 Aug 2010|publisher=Nabu Press|isbn=1176542486}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Paper offerings are in demand at [[Ghost Festival]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deutsch|first1=Lauren|title=Up in Smoke Chinese Joss Paper Offerings|date=Spring 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; various offerings such as [[incense]]s, [[Joss paper|joss paper accessories]], [[altar candle]]s, paper-mache form of material items (i.e. golds, clothes, bank notes)  or other goods for the visiting spirits of ancestors, those all have a strong footing in paper offerings market. Candles in wooden bowls are placed on street corners or along rivers to guide wandering spirits to the feasts prepared for them. Shops provide joss paper,accessories paper and incense, selling to the public to sacrifice their ancestors in [[Qingming Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese offerings go up in smoke for dear ancestors|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/features/article/chinese-offerings-go-up-in-smoke-for-dear-ancestors|agency=Malaymail Online|date=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]]  and [[Lantern Festival]], shops sell candles and paper lanterns, which are used for celebration Families are willing to buy those stuff for children in the Mid-Autumn Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=SIU|first1=Lin Wai|title=Lanterns of the Mid‐Autumn Festival: A Reflection of Hong Kong Cultural Change|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|date=March 2004|volume=33|pages=67–86|doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1999.3302_67.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funeral using paper-mache offerings==
Chinese funeral ([[Taoism and death|Taoist funeral]]), is the occasion which uses the paper offerings most. Paper horse and paper goat is a must in the funeral ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Shuang|title=The Funeral and Chinese Culture|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|date=1993|volume=27|issue=2|pages=113–120|doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1993.113555.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those offerings are used for releasing souls from purgatory, fulfilling the dead daily needs in the [[underworld]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=LAI|first1=Chi Tim|title=Making Peace with the Unknown: A Reflection on Daoist Funerary Liturgy|journal=Death, Dying and Bereavement: A Hong Kong Chinese Experience|date=2006|volume=5|pages=87–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as paper currency, clothes, food, houses, and transports.Nowadays, products of paper offerings for funerals are near life size , for example, TV, iPhone or other electronic products are one of the paper mache offerings. This is a mixture of modern and ancient civilization. In this case, the target customers are people who held the Taoism funeral.

==The famous papier-mache shops in Hong Kong==

Papier-mache offering shops with long history in Hong Kong are mostly clustered together in Queen's Road West and Queen’s Road Central. Bo Wah Paper Craft (寶華紮作) and Chau Zi Paper Craft (秋記紮作) are two well-known papier-mache offering shops because of their long history.

===Bo Wah Paper Craft  (寶華紮作)===
Bo Wah Paper Craft  (寶華紮作) is established in 1963 and located in Sham Shui Po.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bo Wah Paper Craft - Bonding of Father and Son|url=http://www.huluhk.org/SSP/heritage.php?lang=en&amp;id=bowa|website=Hong Kong Jockey Club HULU|publisher=Hong Kong Jockey Club HULU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owner used to make traditional papier-mache like lion head for Chinese New Year, but Au Yeung Bing Chi, the son of the owner, have changed the style of papier-mache from traditional to modish in order to cater for the modern society and to create a new trend. Papier-mache can be customized in Bo Wah, creative papier-mache products such as Stormtrooper in Star Wars and specific bones of human skeleton are available in the shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=深水埗潮爆紙紮鋪 星球大戰都整到|url=http://nextplus.nextmedia.com/news/spot/20150317/168741|publisher=Next Media|date=2015-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chau Zi Paper Craft (秋記紮作)===
Chau Zi Paper Craft (秋記紮作), established in 1930 and located in Central, is one of the oldest papier-mache shops in Hong Kong. The owner Chan Kui Chau is a well-known Hong Kong papier-mache maker who made traditional papier-mache products such as trotting horse lamp. Chau Zi attracts tourists from all over the world coming to visit, order and explore traditional Chinese papier-mache products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=林|first1=佩婷|title=代 Cult2：八十前 老師傅紮足70年|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/supplement/culture/art/20100806/14315126|agency=Next Media|publisher=Apple Daily|date=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison between different Papier-mache offering shops among the world==

Papier-mache is a tradition among Asia, besides China and Hong Kong people, papier-mache offering shops are even being set-up in Japan, Vietnam and Malaysia with their unique cultures.

===Japan===

People would make the papier mache by themselves since Tang dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ba|first1=Bai Shan|last2=Kang|first2=Jia Xun|title=一看就懂，誰都能做紙公仔 (Ways to make a papier mache)|publisher=Shu Chuan Publishing House}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, due to the economic development, people started to set up shops afterwards. Unlike Hong Kong, the paper mache shops in Japan sells traditional paper products like [[orizuru]] (Japanese paper crane) , [[omamori]] and [[Japanese traditional dolls]] for bowing and making wishes in the [[shrine]] and temples.

===Vietnam===
In Vietnam, the [[Hàng Mã Street]] located in Hanoi, has been selling paper goods for more than 500 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Huyền Minh|first1=Lê Thị|title=How to preserve the Old Quarter|url=http://hanoi1000yrs.vietnam.gov.vn/Home/How-to-preserve-the-Old-Quarter/20103/4782.vgp|website=Vietnam Government Web Portal|publisher=Vietnam Government Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western countries===
Shops are even set up in Western countries like the USA or United Kingdom by Chinese immigrant. For example, [[Mulberry Street (Manhattan)|Mulberry Street]] in America, also known as Chinatown, there are also papier-mache selling shops which are similar with those in Hong Kong. They serve the Chinese who are living there to celebrate Chinese festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=黃|first1=偉江|title=清明紙紮品熱賣 (Papier-mache products become hot items in Ching Ming Festival)|url=http://singtao.com/showContent.php?main=oversea&amp;sub=4&amp;title=3&amp;page=0&amp;StrContentId=20120406a33|agency=Sing Tao Ltd.|publisher=Sing Tao Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior design and architectural style==

Papier-mache shops in Hong Kong are usually designed in traditional Chinese style without fancy decoration. The layout seems to be disorganised but the goods are arranged orderly. A large tablet placed on top of the door with the name of the shop written in golden colour, yellow colour or red colour, around with some Chinese lanterns for decoration. Some shelves are put outside the shops for displaying products. For the setting, some simple closets are placed all around the shop with variety of products on it. A glass case table forms a corner for the shop owner. Generally there are tables placed in the middle of the shop, with a lot of package of foss paper and papier-mache putting on them for ancestor worship, which sorted out by plastic baskets or cartons. The 3D papier-maches are wrapped in plastic bags and being hanged inside the shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=彩店 - 胡燕青散文集|last=胡|first=燕青|publisher=Infolink Publishing|year=2007|isbn=|location=Hong Kong|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During some traditional Chinese festivals such as the mid-autumn festival, the festive products will also be wrapped in plastic bags and being hanged outside the shop to attract customers.

'''Pirate''' has multiple meanings in [[sexual slang]]. Several of them emerged in the 20th century and play off the tradition that [[pirate]]s took whatever they wanted, including sex, which was "seen as a conquest."&lt;ref name="Dalzell"&gt;Dalzell, Tom; Victor, Terry (2007). ''Sex Slang.'' Psychology Press, {{ISBN|9780415371803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

The most common usage is [[Australian slang]] for a man searching around for [[casual sex]], as in "on the pirate" or the verb "to pirate".&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;Green, Jonathon (2005). ''Cassell's Dictionary of Slang.'' Sterling Publishing Company, Inc., {{ISBN|9780304366361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been used to describe a [[pimp]] who steals a prostitute from another pimp.&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt;

A more recent slang usage is a fictitious sex act called "the pirate" or "the angry pirate".&lt;ref name="sanchez"&gt;Denton-Brown, Nick et al (Eds.) (2009). ''Dirty Sanchez's Guide to Buck Nasty Sex.'' Ulysses Press, {{ISBN|9781569757208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex columnist [[Dan Savage]] fielded a question from a reader who asked about the act. The reader described it as "when you’re getting a [[blowjob]] from a girl, and when you cum, you  [[ejaculate]] in her eye. Then you kick her in the shin. The result is the woman is squinting her eye and hopping up and down on one foot, holding her leg and screaming, "ARRRGH!"&lt;ref name="savage2004"&gt;{{cite news |title=No Shit? |author=Dan Savage |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=20179&amp;mode=print |newspaper=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]] |date=December 23–29, 2004 |accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage replied &lt;!--This quotation preserves the capitalization in the original source material.--&gt;"no one has ever attempted "the Pirate," just as no one has ever performed a [[Hot Karl (slang)|Hot Karl]], delivered a [[donkey punch]], or inserted an [[Icy Mike]]. They’re all fictions." &lt;ref name="savage2004" /&gt; Author Jordan Tate, commenting in ''The Contemporary Dictionary of Sexual Euphemisms'' (2007) said this "falls into the class of theoretical euphemisms that are infrequent, impractical, and violent."&lt;ref name="Tate2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jordan Tate|title=The Contemporary Dictionary of Sexual Euphemisms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aclMh6SB1ngC|accessdate=15 February 2012|date=9 January 2007|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-36298-0|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tate said these terms originated sometime after the [[sexual revolution]], when the empowerment of women was threatening the place of men in contemporary society. [...] This shift in gender paradigms left men feeling threatened, and to reassert their authority, they created and popularized these theoretical and violent euphemisms.&lt;ref name="Tate2007" /&gt;

==Compound words==

The term is also used in [[compound words]], including "tango pirate," popularized in the early 20th century to describe [[gigolo]]s who sought out wealthy women at dances.&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt; The terms "butt pirate" or "ass pirate" or "poo pirate" have been used as [[sexual slur]]s for [[gay men]].&lt;ref name="Dalzell"/&gt; The term "Pamper pirate" has been used to describe a [[child molester]].&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt;

As with other installments in the ''Mystery Dungeon'' series, the game centers on randomly changing, multilevel dungeons which the player must explore and clear whilst battling hostile Pokémon in turn-based combat. It features separate Pokémon and dungeons between different versions, altogether containing 493 Pokémon of the first four generations of the Pokémon main series games.

==Gameplay==
While similar to previous installments such as the [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team|''Rescue Team'']] and [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness|''Explorers'']] titles, ''Adventure Team'' introduces 3-dimensional graphics instead of the [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]-based graphics of the aforementioned titles.&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gantayat|first1=Anoop|title=Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Hits WiiWare|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/07/15/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-hits-wiiware|accessdate=21 December 2017|work=IGN|date=15 July 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213201752/http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/07/15/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-hits-wiiware|archivedate=13 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from a difference of starters and the game's hub location (in ''Fire Adventure Team'', red-colored Pokémon such as [[Charmander]] are available in the "Pokémon Village", with blue-colored ones such as [[Squirtle]] in "Pokémon Beach" and yellow ones such as [[Pikachu]] in "Pokémon Garden" being available in ''Light Adventure Team'' and ''Storm Adventure Team'', respectively), the three games each contain 15 "Mystery Dungeons" which are unique to each other. Unlike preceding handheld games, ''Adventure Team'' games allows 4 save files in a single game. In addition, the player is capable of switching their character at any point in the game to another from a roster of nine Pokémon.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|title=冒険団シリーズ紹介 {{!}} ポケモン不思議のダンジョン 冒険団シリーズ公式サイト {{!}} ポケットモンスターオフィシャルサイト|url=http://www.pokemon.co.jp/special/dungeon_boukendan/about/|publisher=[[The Pokémon Company]]|website=www.pokemon.co.jp|accessdate=21 December 2017|language=ja|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629220756/http://www.pokemon.co.jp/special/dungeon_boukendan/about/|archivedate=29 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transfer of befriended Pokémon or items between the aforementioned save slots are allowed.

==Plot==
Unlike previous and following ''Pokémon Mystery Dungeon'' games, the player does not act as a human transformed into a Pokémon and are instead Pokémon inhabitants of a town (Pokémon Village, Beach, or Garden depending on the game). After rescuing a [[List of generation II Pokémon#Shuckle|Shuckle]] from a "mystery dungeon" in a tutorial mission with a single partner, the group of nine Pokémon forms an Adventure Team following the request of an elderly [[Slowking]]. After some time, in a mission the Pokémon obtain some chocolate which they hand to Shuckle, enticing jealousy across the town. To restore the town, the Adventure Team explore another dungeon and returns with cookies, successfully returning the town to its former peaceful state.

Following the incident, one of the legendary dogs (Raikou, Entei or Suicune) depending on the game approaches the player, offering to join the Adventure Team. Later, they encounter other legendary Pokémon which are available for recruitment into the Rescue Team, in addition to higher-difficulty dungeons.

==Release==
''Adventure Team'' installments were first teased through promotional pamphlets in mid-2009, with a website containing gameplay screenshots and footage being opened on July.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; The games were released on 4 August 2009 in the [[Wii Shop Channel]] for 1,200 [[Nintendo Points]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fletcher|first1=J.C.|title=Rumor: McDonalds reveals Pokemon Mystery Dungeon on WiiWare|url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/06/16/rumor-mcdonalds-reveals-pokemon-mystery-dungeon-on-wiiware/|accessdate=21 December 2017|work=Engadget|date=16 June 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101220359/https://www.engadget.com/2009/06/16/rumor-mcdonalds-reveals-pokemon-mystery-dungeon-on-wiiware/|archivedate=1 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ポケモン不思議のダンジョン すすめ！炎の冒険団・いくぞ！嵐の冒険団・めざせ！光の冒険団|url=http://www.pokemon.co.jp/game/wii/dungeon/|website=ポケットモンスターオフィシャルサイト|accessdate=21 December 2017|language=ja-JP|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171123025333/http://www.pokemon.co.jp/game/wii/dungeon/|archivedate=23 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The games were given a [[CERO]] rating of "A" (for all ages).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ポケモン不思議のダンジョン 冒険団シリーズ [Wii]|url=https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&amp;a=page_h_title&amp;title_id=12196|work=[[Famitsu]]|accessdate=27 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723094445/http://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&amp;a=page_h_title&amp;title_id=12196|archivedate=23 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kotaku]]'' listed the games as one of the best released through the WiiWare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kohler|first1=Chris|title=The Best WiiWare Games To Buy Before They All Disappear|url=https://kotaku.com/the-best-wiiware-games-to-buy-before-they-all-disappear-1820808421|accessdate=27 December 2017|work=Kotaku|date=29 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130075543/https://kotaku.com/the-best-wiiware-games-to-buy-before-they-all-disappear-1820808421|archivedate=30 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The''''' '''''Flying Deer''''' ([[Dutch language|dutch]]: '''''Het fliegende hert''''') was a 17th century [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] ship. She was lost at sea with all hands during a hurricane off [[St. kitts|St. Kitts]] in 1638.

== History ==
'''''The Flying Deer''''' was an early 17th century [[sloop]] in dutch service. She was recorded as participating in the lucrative trans-Atlantic [[tobacco]] trade. In August 1638, the sloop was anchored off island of St. Kitts when the [[Sweden|Swedish]]-flagged [[Kalmar Nyckel|''Kalmar Nykle'']] (which was returning from its first voyage to establish [[New Sweden]]) also dropped anchor off the island.&lt;ref&gt;''The Kalmar Nykle''; A Guide to the Ship and Her History. The Kalmar Nykle Foundation, Wilmington D.E.

URL: http://www.kalmarnyckel.org/docs/knf_guidebook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The captain of ''The'' ''Flying Deer'' was a friend of [[Peter Minuit]], a prominent explorer aboard the Swedish ship, and so Minuit and Captain [[Jan Hindricksen van der Water]] of ''Kalmar Nykle'' were invited aboard ''The Flying Deer''. During the visit, a powerful storm (possibly a [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]]) swept up on the island, battering the ships at anchor. ''Kalmar Nykle'' rode out the storm at sea, but ''The Flying Deer'' was never seen again and presumed to be lost with all hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wd5AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=dutch+ship+flying+deer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qSKkKHDReM&amp;sig=c6MvDpr3NF_uaBror9orcOc_jCM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi52aqEr8_bAhXR1lMKHWTsArwQ6AEINzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=dutch%20ship%20flying%20deer&amp;f=false|title=General history|last=Scharf|first=John Thomas|date=1888|publisher=L.

'''Vine Victor Deloria Jr.''' (March 26, 1933 – November 13, 2005) was a Native American author, theologian, historian, and activist. He was widely known for his book ''[[Custer Died for Your Sins]]: An Indian Manifesto'' (1969), which helped generate national attention to Native American issues in the same year as the [[Alcatraz-Red Power Movement]]. From 1964 to 1967, he had served as executive director of the [[National Congress of American Indians]], increasing tribal membership from 19 to 156. Beginning in 1977, he was a board member of the [[National Museum of the American Indian]], which now has buildings in both New York City and Washington, DC. He was influential in the development of what scientific critics called [[American Indian creationism]], but which American Indians referred to as defenses against [[scientific racism]].

Deloria began his academic career in 1970 at [[Western Washington State College]] at [[Bellingham, Washington]].  He became Professor of Political Science at the [[University of Arizona]] (1978–1990), where he established the first master's degree program in [[American Indian Studies]] in the United States. In 1990, Deloria taught at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]] until 2000, when he returned to Arizona and taught at the College of Law.

==Background and education==
Vine Deloria Jr. was born in 1933, in [[Martin, South Dakota]], near the [[Oglala Lakota]] [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]]. He was the son of Barbara Sloat (née Eastburn) and Vine Victor Deloria Sr. (1901–1990). His father studied English and Christian theology and became an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] archdeacon and [[missionary]] on the [[Standing Rock Indian Reservation]].&lt;ref&gt;Wishart, 60&lt;/ref&gt; His father transferred his and his children's tribal membership from the Yankton Sioux to Standing Rock. Vine Sr.'s sister [[Ella Deloria]] (1881–1971) was an [[anthropologist]].&lt;ref&gt;Wishart, 59&lt;/ref&gt; Vine Jr.'s paternal grandfather was ''Tipi Sapa'' (Black Lodge), also known as Rev. Philip Joseph Deloria, an [[Episcopal priest]] and a leader of the [[Yankton Sioux|Yankton]] band of the [[Sioux people|Dakota]] Nation. His paternal grandmother was Mary Sully, daughter of [[Alfred Sully]], a general in the [[American Civil War]] and [[Indian Wars]] and his French-Yankton wife; and granddaughter of painter [[Thomas Sully]].

Vine Jr. was first educated at reservation schools. Deloria graduated from [[Kent School]] in 1951. He graduated from [[Iowa State University]] in 1958 with a degree in general science.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;Johnson, Kirk. [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/15/national/15deloria.html "Vine Deloria Jr., Champion of Indian Rights, Dies at 72."] ''New York Times.'' November 15, 2005 (retrieved Aug 26, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Deloria served in the Marines from 1954 through 1956.&lt;ref name=mnsu&gt;Lorenz, Melissa. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080925082716/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/history/mncultures/vinedeloriajr.htm Vine Deloria Jr.], ''EMuseum @ Minnesota State University, Mankato.'' 2008 (Archived copy retrieved April 19, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally planning to be a minister like his father, Deloria Jr. in 1963 earned a theology degree from the [[Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago|Lutheran School of Theology]], then located in [[Rock Island, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; In the late 1960s, he returned to graduate study and earned a law degree from [[University of Colorado Law School]] in 1970.

==Activism==

In 1964, Deloria was elected executive director of the [[National Congress of American Indians]].&lt;ref name="atributewilkinsrevuefrancaise"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilkins|first1=David|title=A Tribute to Vine Deloria, Jr.: An Indigenous Visionary|journal=Revue Française d’Etudes Américaines|date=2015|volume=3|issue=144|pages=109–118|url=http://www.cairn.info/article.php?ID_ARTICLE=RFEA_144_0109&amp;WT.mc_id=RFEA_144|accessdate=May 31, 2016|via=[[Cairn.info]]|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his three-year term, the organization went from bankruptcy to solvency, and membership went from 19 to 156 tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, 107&lt;/ref&gt; Through the years, he was involved with many Native American organizations. Beginning in 1977, he was a board member of the [[National Museum of the American Indian]], which established its first center at the former United States Custom House in New York City.

While teaching at [[Western Washington State College]] at [[Bellingham, Washington]], Deloria advocated for the treaty fishing rights of local Native American tribes. He worked on the legal case that led to the historic [[George Hugo Boldt|Boldt]] Decision of the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Washington]]. Judge Boldt's ruling in ''[[United States v. Washington]]'' (1974) validated Indian fishing rights in the state as continuing past the tribes' cession of millions of acres of land to the United States in the 1850s. Thereafter Native Americans had the right to half the catch in fishing in the state.&lt;ref name=mnsu/&gt;

==Writing==
In 1969, Deloria published his first of more than twenty books, entitled ''[[Custer Died for Your Sins: An Indian Manifesto]]''. This book became one of Deloria's most famous works. In it, he addressed stereotypes of Indians and challenged white audiences to take a new look at the history of United States western expansion, noting its abuses of Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was released the year that students of the [[Alcatraz-Red Power Movement]] occupied [[Alcatraz Island]] to seek construction of an Indian cultural center, as well as attention in gaining justice on Indian issues, including recognition of tribal sovereignty. Other groups also gained momentum, with organizations such as the [[American Indian Movement]] staging events to attract media and public attention for education.

The book helped draw attention to the Native American struggle. Focused on the Native American goal of [[sovereignty]] without political and social assimilation, the book stood as a hallmark of [[Native American Self-Determination]] at the time. The [[American Anthropological Association]] sponsored a panel in response to ''Custer Died for Your Sins''. The book was reissued in 1988 with a new preface by the author, noting, "The Indian world has changed so substantially since the first publication of this book that some things contained in it seem new again."

Deloria wrote and edited many subsequent books and 200 articles, focusing on issues as they related to Native Americans, such as education and religion.&lt;ref name=mnsu/&gt; In 1995, Deloria argued in his book ''[[Red Earth, White Lies]]'' that the [[Beringia|Bering Strait Land Bridge]] never existed, and that the ancestors of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] had not migrated to the Americas over such a land bridge, as has been claimed by most [[archaeologists]], anthropologists, linguists and other scholars. Rather, he asserted that the Native Americans may have originated in the Americas, or reached them through transoceanic travel, as some of their [[creation stories]] suggested.&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt;

Deloria's position on the age of certain geological formations, the length of time Native Americans have been in the Americas, their possible coexistence with dinosaurs, etc. were influential in the development of American Indian defenses against scientific racism. This generally rejects scientific explanations of origins of indigenous peoples in the Americas that contradict American Indian accounts.&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;Jenkins, Philip [https://books.google.com/books?id=-CAphDNATLAC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=%22red+earth,+white+lies%22+creationism&amp;ei=TK0ASabiF4LwsQOQm43VDA&amp;client=firefox-a ''Dream Catchers: How Mainstream America Discovered Native Spirituality''], OUP USA (November 24, 2005) {{ISBN|978-0-19-518910-0}}. p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Leary, Denyse. ''By Design or by Chance in the Universe: The Growing Controversy on the Origins of Life'', Augsburg Fortress (August 3, 2004) {{ISBN|978-0-8066-5177-4}} p. 155 [https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/reader/0806651776/ref=sib_rdr_prev2_ex155?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=vine&amp;p=S04R&amp;twc=2&amp;checkSum=W%2B1kXHQfLLw5xkIa1rFFeRduR7SJHjTxhw4eXNTQLxk%3D#reader-page]&lt;/ref&gt; Deloria argued that scientists are virtually incapable of independent thinking and are hobbled by their reverence for orthodoxy. He wrote that scientists characteristically persecute those who dare to advance unorthodox views, and that science is thus, essentially a religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brumble|first1=H David|title=Vine Deloria Jr, Creationism, and Ethnic Pseudoscience|journal=RNCSE|date=1998|volume=18|issue=6|url=http://ncse.com/rncse/18/6/vine-deloria-jr-creationism-ethnic-pseudoscience|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deloria has been criticized for his embrace of American Indian traditional histories by such scholars as Bernard Ortiz de Montellano and H. David Brumble, who say such views are not supported by the scientific and physical evidence, and contribute to problems of pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Ortiz de Montellano. "Post-Modern Multiculturalism and Scientific Illiteracy", ''APS (American Physical Society) News'', January 1998, Vol 7, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Deloria often cited American Indian creation accounts and oral traditions in support of his views relating to science. He also relied on [[Hinduism and creationism|Hindu creationists]], such as [[Michael Cremo]].&lt;ref&gt;Deloria's critics on this issue include: Bruce Thornton, ''Plagues of the Mind: The New Epidemic of False Knowledge'', ISI Books, 1999.; H. David Brumble, "Vine Deloria Jr., Creationism, and Ethnic Pseudoscience", ''American Literary History'' 1998 10(2):335–346; George Johnson, "Indian Tribes' Creationists Thwart Archeologists", ''New York Times'', October 22, 1996; John C. Whittaker. "''Red Earth, White Lies'': Native Americas and the Myth of Scientific Fact", book review in ''The Skeptical Inquirer'', Jan–Feb 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicholas Peroff]] wrote that "Deloria has rarely missed a chance to argue that the realities of precontact American Indian experience and tradition cannot be recognized or understood within any conceptual framework built on the theories of modern science. And in fact, it is certainly true that no one, with or without the aid of scientific theories and concepts, can, in any absolute meaning of the word, know what life was like as a member of the Menominee Tribe six hundred years ago. But we can imagine what it was like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pavlik|first1=Steve|last2=Wildcat|first2=Daniel R.|title=Destroying dogma : Vine Deloria Jr. and his influence on American society|date=2006|publisher=Fulcrum Pub.|location=Golden, Colo.|isbn=1555915191|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
In 1970, Deloria took his first faculty position, teaching at the [[Western Washington University]] College of Ethnic Studies in [[Bellingham, Washington]].&lt;ref name=mnsu/&gt; As a visiting scholar, he taught at the [[Pacific School of Religion]], the New School of Religion and [[Colorado College]].  From 1972 to 1974 he also taught at the University of California at Los Angeles.

His first tenured position was as Professor of Political Science at the [[University of Arizona]], which he held from 1978 to 1990. While at UA, Deloria established the first master's degree program in [[American Indian Studies]] in the United States. Such recognition of American Indian culture in existing institutions was one of the goals of the Alcatraz-Red Power Movement.&lt;ref name=mnsu/&gt; Numerous American Indian studies programs, museums and collections, and other institutions have been established since Deloria's first book was published.

Deloria next taught at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]] from 1990 to 2000.&lt;ref name=cu&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/news/cgi-bin/print.cgi?year=2005&amp;id=433 "Vine Deloria Jr., Renowned Author And American Indian Leader, Dies At 72."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606104523/http://www.colorado.edu/news/cgi-bin/print.cgi?year=2005&amp;id=433 |date=June 6, 2011 }} ''University of Colorado at Boulder News Center.''

'''Workplace spirituality''' or '''spirituality in the workplace''' is a movement that began in the early 1920s.{{dubious|date=June 2017}}  It emerged as a grassroots movement with individuals seeking to live their faith and/or spiritual values in the workplace.  Spiritual or ''spirit-centered'' leadership is a topic of inquiry frequently associated with the workplace spirituality movement (Benefiel, 2005; Biberman, 2000; Fry, 2005; Giacalone &amp; Jurkiewicz, 2003; Jue, 2006).

==History==

The movement began primarily as U.S. centric{{fact|date=June 2017}} but has become much more international in recent years.{{when|date=June 2017}}  Key organizations include:

*  International Center for Spirit at Work (ICSW)
*  European Baha'i Business Forum (EBBF)
*  World Business Academy (WBA)
*  Spiritual Business Network (SBN)
*  Foundation for Workplace Spirituality 

Key factors that have led to this trend include:

#  [[Mergers and acquisitions]] destroyed the [[psychological contract]] that workers had a job for life.  This led some people to search for more of a sense of inner security rather than looking for external security from a corporation.
#  [[Baby Boomers]] hitting middle age resulting in a large demographic part of the population asking meaningful questions about life and purpose.
#  The [[millennium]] created an opportunity for people all over the world to reflect on where the human race has come from, where it is headed in the future, and what role business plays in the future of the human race.

In the late 1990s, the Academy of Management formed a special interest group called the Management, Spirituality and Religion Interest Group.

==Leading from within==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our complicity in world making is a source of awesome and sometimes painful responsibility—and a source of profound hope for change. It is the ground of our common call to leadership, the truth that makes leaders of us all.

A leader is someone with the power to project either shadow or light onto some part of the world and onto the lives of the people who dwell there. A leader shapes the ethos in which others must live, an ethos as light-filled as heaven or as shadowy as hell. A ''good'' leader is intensely aware of the interplay of inner shadow and light, lest the act of leadership do more harm than good. (Palmer, p 78)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
