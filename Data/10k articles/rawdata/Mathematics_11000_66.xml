'''''Acta Mathematica''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[Open access (publishing)|open-access]] [[scientific journal]] covering research in all fields of [[mathematics]]. The journal was established by [[Gösta Mittag-Leffler]] in 1882 and is published by [[Institut Mittag-Leffler]], a research institute for mathematics belonging to the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. The journal has been printed and distributed by [[Springer Science+Business Media]] from 2006 to 2016. Since 2017, Acta Mathematica is published electronically and in print by [[International Press]]. Its electronic version is open access without publishing fees.

According to [[Cédric Villani]], this journal is "considered by many to be the most prestigious of all mathematical research journals". The journal's "most famous episode" (according to Villani) concerns [[Henri Poincaré]], who won a prize offered in 1887 by [[Oscar II of Sweden]] for the best mathematical work concerning the [[stability of the Solar System]] by purporting to prove the stability of a special case of the [[three-body problem]]. This episode was (re)discovered in the 1990's by Daniel Goroff, in his preface to the english translation of "Les méthodes nouvelles de la mécanique céleste"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Daniel L. Goroff]]|title=Introduction to the english translation of "Les méthodes nouvelles de la mécanique céleste"| publisher= American Institute of Physics|year=1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt;.  by June Barrow-Green and K.G. Andersson (&lt;ref&gt; {{citation|author=[[June Barrow-Green]]|title=Oscar II's prize competition and the error in Poincaré's memoir on the three body problem|journal= Archive for History of Exact Sciences |volume=48 |issue=2|year=1994|pages=107–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[K.

The prized or lauded paper was to be published in ''Acta Mathematica'', but after the issue containing the paper was printed, Poincaré found an error that invalidated his proof. He paid more than the prize money to destroy the print run and reprint the issue without his paper, and instead published a corrected paper a year later in the same journal that demonstrated that the system could be unstable. This paper later became one of the foundational works of [[chaos theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Cédric Villani]]|title=Birth of a Theorem: A Mathematical Adventure|publisher=Farrar, Straus, and Giroux|location=New York|year=2015|pages=193–196}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fermat's method ==

Fermat used ''adequality'' first to find maxima of functions, and then adapted it to find tangent lines to curves.

To find the maximum of a term &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt;, Fermat equated (or more precisely adequated) &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p(x+e)&lt;/math&gt; and after doing algebra he could cancel out a factor of &lt;math&gt;e,&lt;/math&gt; and then discard any remaining terms involving &lt;math&gt;e.&lt;/math&gt; To illustrate the method by Fermat's own example, consider the problem of finding the maximum of &lt;math&gt;p(x)=bx-x^2&lt;/math&gt; (In Fermat's words, it is to divide a line &lt;math&gt;AC&lt;/math&gt; at a point &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, such that the product of the two parts &lt;math&gt;AE\times EC&lt;/math&gt; be a maximum.&lt;ref name="FermatTreatise" /&gt;) Fermat ''adequated'' &lt;math&gt;bx-x^2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;b(x+e)-(x+e)^2=bx-x^2+be-2ex-e^2&lt;/math&gt;. That is (using the notation &lt;math&gt;\backsim&lt;/math&gt; to denote adequality, introduced by [[Paul Tannery]]):
:&lt;math&gt;bx-x^2\backsim bx-x^2+be-2ex-e^2.&lt;/math&gt;
Canceling terms and dividing by &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; Fermat arrived at
:&lt;math&gt;b\backsim 2x+e.&lt;/math&gt;
Removing the terms that contained &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; Fermat arrived at the desired result that the maximum occurred when &lt;math&gt;x=b/2&lt;/math&gt;.

Fermat also used his principle to give a mathematical derivation of [[Snell's law]]s of refraction directly from the principle that light takes the quickest path.{{sfn|Grabiner|1983}}

==Descartes' criticism==
Fermat's method was highly criticized by his contemporaries, particularly [[Descartes]]. V. Katz suggests this is because Descartes had independently discovered the same new mathematics, known as his [[method of normals]], and Descartes was quite proud of his discovery. Katz also notes that while Fermat's methods were closer to the future developments in calculus, Descartes' methods had a more immediate impact on the development.{{sfn|Katz|2008}}

==Scholarly controversy==
{{cleanup|reason=too much unnecessary information displayed with poor formatting|date=September 2016}}
Both Newton and Leibniz referred to Fermat's work as an antecedent of [[infinitesimal calculus]]. Nevertheless, there is disagreement amongst modern scholars about the exact meaning of Fermat's adequality. Fermat's ''adequality'' was analyzed in a number of scholarly studies.  In 1896, [[Paul Tannery]] published a French translation of Fermat’s Latin treatises on maxima and minima (Fermat, Œuvres, Vol. III, pp.&amp;nbsp;121–156). Tannery translated Fermat's term as “adégaler” and adopted Fermat’s “adéquation”. Tannery also introduced the symbol &lt;math&gt;\backsim&lt;/math&gt; for adequality in mathematical formulas.

'''Heinrich Wieleitner''' (1929)&lt;ref&gt;Wieleitner, H.:Bemerkungen zu Fermats Methode der Aufsuchung von Extremwerten und der Berechnung von Kurventangenten. Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung '''38''' (1929)24–35, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Fermat replaces ''A'' with ''A''+''E''. Then he sets the new expression '''roughly equal''' ('''angenähert gleich''') to the old one, cancels  equal terms on both sides, and divides by the highest possible power of ''E''. He then cancels all terms which contain ''E'' and sets those that remain equal to each other. From that [the required] ''A'' results. That ''E'' should be as small as possible is nowhere said and is at best expressed by the word "adaequalitas". &lt;/blockquote&gt;(Wieleitner uses the symbol &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\sim&lt;/math&gt;.)
&lt;br&gt;

'''Max Miller''' (1934)&lt;ref&gt;Miller, M.: Pierre de Fermats Abhandlungen über Maxima und Minima. Akademische Verlagsgesellschaft, Leipzig (1934), p.1&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Thereupon one should put the both terms, which express the maximum and the minimum, '''approximately equal''' ('''näherungsweise  gleich'''), as Diophantus says.&lt;/blockquote&gt;(Miller uses the symbol &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \approx&lt;/math&gt;.)
&lt;br&gt;

'''Jean Itard''' (1948)&lt;ref&gt;Itard, I: Fermat précurseur du calcul différentiel. Arch Int. Hist. Sci. '''27''' (1948), 589–610, p.597&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;One knows that the expression "adégaler" is adopted by Fermat from Diophantus, translated by Xylander and by Bachet. It is about an '''approximate equality''' ('''égalité approximative''') ". &lt;/blockquote&gt;(Itard uses the symbol &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \backsim&lt;/math&gt;.)
&lt;br&gt;

'''Joseph Ehrenfried Hofmann''' (1963)&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, J.E.: Über ein Extremwertproblem des Apollonius und seine Behandlung bei Fermat. Nova Acta Leopoldina (2) '''27''' (167) (1963), 105–113, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Fermat chooses a quantity ''h'', thought as sufficiently small, and puts ''f''(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''h'') '''roughly equal''' ('''ungefähr gleich''') to ''f''(''x''). His technical term is ''adaequare''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;(Hofmann uses the symbol &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \approx&lt;/math&gt;.)
&lt;br&gt;

'''Peer Strømholm''' (1968)&lt;ref&gt;Strømholm, P.: Fermat's method of maxima and minima and of tangents. A reconstruction. Arch. Hist Exact Sci. '''5''' (1968), 47–69, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;The basis of Fermat's approach was the comparition of two expressions which, though they had the same form, were '''not exactly equal'''. This part of the process he called "''comparare par adaequalitatem''" or "''comparer per adaequalitatem''", and it implied that the otherwise strict identity between the two sides of the "equation" was destroyed by the modification of the variable by a ''small'' amount:

&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f(A){\sim}f(A+E)&lt;/math&gt;.

This, I believe, was the real significance of his use of Diophantos' πἀρισον, stressing the ''smallness'' of the variation. The ordinary translation of 'adaequalitas' seems to be "'''approximate equality'''", but I much prefer "'''pseudo-equality'''" to present Fermat's thought at this point.&lt;/blockquote&gt;He further notes that "there was never in M1 (Method 1) any question of the variation ''E'' being put equal to zero. The words Fermat used to express the process of suppressing terms containing ''E'' was 'elido', 'deleo', and 'expungo', and in French 'i'efface' and 'i'ôte'. We can hardly believe that a sane man wishing to express his meaning and searching for words, would constantly hit upon such tortuous ways of imparting the simple fact that the terms vanished because ''E'' was zero.&lt;/blockquote&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;51)
&lt;br&gt;

'''Claus Jensen''' (1969)&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, C.: ''Pierre Fermat's method of determining tangents and its application to the conchoid and the quadratrix.'' Centaurus '''14''' (1969), 72–85, p.73&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Moreover, in applying the notion of ''adégalité'' – which constitutes the basis of Fermat's general method of constructing tangents, and by which is meant a comparition of two magnitudes '''as if they were equal, although they are in fact not''' ("tamquam essent aequalia, licet revera aequalia non sint") – I will employ the nowadays more usual symbol &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \approx&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt; The Latin quotation comes from Tannery's 1891 edition of Fermat, volume 1, page 140.
&lt;br&gt;

'''[[Michael Sean Mahoney]]''' (1971)&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, M.S.: ''Fermat, Pierre de.'' Dictionary of Scientific Biography, vol. IV, Charles Scribner's Sons, New York (1971), p.569.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Fermat's Method of maxima and minima, which is clearly applicable to any polynomial 'P(x)'', originally rested on purely ''finitistic'' algebraic foundations. It assumed, '''counterfactually''', the inequality of two equal roots in order to determine, by Viete's theory of equations, a relation between those roots and one of the coefficients of the polynomial, a relation that was fully general. This relation then led to an extreme-value solution when Fermat removed his '''counterfactual assumption''' and set the roots equal. Borrowing a term from Diophantus, Fermat called this '''counterfactual equality''' 'adequality'.&lt;/blockquote&gt;(Mahoney uses the symbol &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\approx&lt;/math&gt;.) On p.&amp;nbsp;164, end of footnote 46, Mahoney notes that one of the meanings of adequality is ''approximate equality'' or ''equality in the limiting case''.
&lt;br&gt;

'''Charles Henry Edwards, Jr. ''' (1979)&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, C.H., Jr.:''The historical Development of the Calculus.'' Springer, New York 1979, p.122f&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;For example, in order to determine how to subdivide a segment of length &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle b&lt;/math&gt; into two segments &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle b-x&lt;/math&gt; whose product &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x(b-x)=bx-x^2&lt;/math&gt; is maximal, that is to find the rectangle with perimeter &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 2b&lt;/math&gt; that has the maximal area, he [Fermat] proceeds  as follows. First he substituted &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x+e&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; (he used ''A'', ''E'' instead of ''x'', ''e'') for the unknown ''x'', and then wrote down the following '''"pseudo-equality"''' to compare the resulting expression with the original one:

:&lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle b(x+e)-(x+e)^2=bx+be-x^2-2xe-e^2\; \sim\; bx-x^2. &lt;/math&gt;

After canceling terms, he divided through by ''e'' to obtain &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle b-2\,x-e\;\sim\;0.&lt;/math&gt; Finally he discarded the remaining term containing ''e'', transforming the '''pseudo-equality''' into the true equality &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x=\frac{b}{2}&lt;/math&gt; that gives the value of ''x'' which makes &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle bx-x^2&lt;/math&gt; maximal. Unfortunately, Fermat never explained the logical basis for this method with sufficient clarity or completeness to prevent disagreements between historical scholars as to precisely what he meant or intended."

'''[[Kirsti Andersen]]''' (1980)&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, K.: ''Techniques of the calculus 1630–1660.'' In: Grattan-Guinness, I. (ed): ''From the Calculus to Set Theory. An Introductory History.'' Duckworth, London 1980, 10–48, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;The two expressions of the maximum or minimum are made ''"adequal"'', which means something like '''as nearly equal as possible'''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;(Andersen uses the symbol &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\approx&lt;/math&gt;.)
&lt;br&gt;

'''Herbert Breger''' (1994)&lt;ref&gt;Breger, H.: ''The mysteries of adaequare: A vindication of Fermat.'' Arch. Hist. Exact Sci. '''46''' (1994), 193–219&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;I want to put forward my hypothesis: ''Fermat used the word "adaequare" in the sense of'' '''"to put equal"''' ... In a mathematical context, the only difference between "aequare" and "adaequare" seems to be that the latter gives more stress on the fact that the equality is achieved.&lt;/blockquote&gt;(Page 197f.)
&lt;br&gt;

'''[[John Stillwell]]''' (Stillwell 2006 p. 91) wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Fermat introduced the idea of adequality in 1630s but he was ahead of his time. His successors were unwilling to give up the convenience of ordinary equations, preferring to use equality loosely rather than to use adequality accurately. The idea of adequality was revived only in the twentieth century, in the so-called [[non-standard analysis]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

'''[[Enrico Giusti]]''' (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Giusti, Enrico, Les méthodes des maxima et minima de Fermat. Ann. Fac. Sci. Toulouse Math. (6) 18 (2009), Fascicule Spécial, 59–85.&lt;/ref&gt; cites Fermat's letter to [[Marin Mersenne]] where Fermat wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Cette comparaison par adégalité produit deux termes inégaux qui enfin produisent l'égalité (selon ma méthode) qui nous donne la solution de la question"  ("This comparison by adequality produces two unequal terms which finally produce the equality (following my method) which gives us the solution of the problem")..&lt;/blockquote&gt; Giusti notes in a footnote that this letter seems to have escaped Breger's notice.
&lt;br&gt;

'''Klaus Barner''' (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Barner, K.: ''Fermat’s  &lt;&lt;adaequare&gt;&gt; – and no end in sight? (Fermats  &lt;&lt;adaequare&gt;&gt; – und kein Ende? '') Math. Semesterber. (2011) '''58''', pp. 13–45&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that Fermat uses two different Latin words (aequabitur and adaequabitur) to replace the nowadays usual equals sign, ''aequabitur'' when the equation concerns a valid identity between two constants, a universally valid (proved) formula, or a conditional equation, ''adaequabitur'', however, when the equation describes a relation between two variables, which are ''not independent'' (and the equation is no valid formula). On page 36, Barner writes: "Why did Fermat continually repeat his inconsistent procedure for all his examples for the method of tangents? Why did he never mention the secant, with which he in fact operated? I do not know."

They develop a formalisation of Fermat's technique of adequality in modern mathematics as the [[standard part function]] which rounds off a finite [[hyperreal number]] to its nearest [[real number]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6282">In [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]], '''Alloy''' is a declarative [[specification language]] for expressing complex structural constraints and behavior in a [[software system]]. Alloy provides a simple structural modeling tool based on [[first-order logic]].&lt;ref name=alloy&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Jackson (computer scientist)|title = Software Abstractions: Logic, Language, and Analysis|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|year = 2006 |isbn=978-0-262-10114-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alloy is targeted at the creation of ''micro-models'' that can then be automatically checked for [[correctness (computer science)|correctness]]. Alloy specifications can be checked using the alloy analyzer.

Although Alloy is designed with automatic analysis in mind, Alloy differs from many specification languages designed for [[model checking|model-checking]] in that it permits the definition of infinite models. The Alloy Analyzer is designed to perform finite scope checks even on infinite models.

The Alloy language and analyzer are developed by a team led by [[Daniel Jackson (computer scientist)|Daniel Jackson]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in the [[United States]].

== History and influences ==

The first version of the Alloy language appeared in 1997.  It was a rather limited [[object model]]ing language. Succeeding iterations of the language "added [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s, higher [[arity]] relations, [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]], [[subtyping]], and signatures".&lt;ref name="alloyfaq"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alloy FAQ|url=http://alloy.mit.edu/alloy/faq.html|accessdate=2013-03-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070607115911/http://alloy.mit.edu/faq.php| archivedate= 7 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematical underpinnings of the language were heavily influenced by the [[Z notation]], and the [[syntax]] of Alloy owes more to languages such as [[Object Constraint Language]].

== The Alloy Analyzer ==

[[File:Screenshot of Alloy Analyzer.png|thumb|Alloy Analyzer.]]

The Alloy Analyzer was specifically developed to support so-called "lightweight formal methods". As such, it is intended to provide fully automated analysis, in contrast to the [[Proof assistant|interactive theorem proving]] techniques commonly used with specification languages similar to Alloy. Development of the Analyzer was originally inspired by the automated analysis provided by [[model checker]]s. However, model-checking is ill-suited to the kind of models that are typically developed in Alloy, and as a result the core of the Analyzer was eventually implemented as a model-finder built atop a [[Boolean satisfiability problem|boolean SAT solver]].&lt;ref name="alloy"/&gt;

Through version 3.0, the Alloy Analyzer incorporated an integral SAT-based model-finder based on an off-the-shelf SAT-solver. However, as of version 4.0 the Analyzer makes use of the Kodkod model-finder, for which the Analyzer acts as a front-end. Both model-finders essentially translate a model expressed in [[relational logic]] into a corresponding [[boolean logic]] formula, and then invoke an off-the-shelf SAT-solver on the boolean formula. In the event that the solver finds a solution, the result is translated back into a corresponding binding of constants to variables in the relational logic model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first1=E.|last1=Torlak|first2=G.|last2=Dennis|title=Kodkod for Alloy Users|booktitle=First ACM Alloy Workshop|location=Portland, Oregon|url=http://alloy.mit.edu/kodkod/pubs/kodkod-alloy06-talk.pdf|date=April 2008|accessdate=2009-04-19|conference=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622031957/http://alloy.mit.edu/kodkod/pubs/kodkod-alloy06-talk.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to ensure the model-finding problem is [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]], the Alloy Analyzer performs model-finding over restricted scopes consisting of a user-defined finite number of objects. This has the effect of limiting the generality of the results produced by the Analyzer. However, the designers of the Alloy Analyzer justify the decision to work within limited scopes through an appeal to the ''small scope hypothesis'': that a high proportion of bugs can be found by testing a program for all test inputs within some small scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|first1 = Alexandr | last1 = Andoni | first2 = Dumitru | last2 = Daniliuc | first3 = Sarfraz | last3 = Khurshid | first4 = Darko | last4 = Marinov | title = Evaluating the small scope hypothesis |citeseerx = 10.1.1.8.7702 | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Model structure ==
Alloy models are relational in nature, and are composed of several different kinds of statements:&lt;ref name=alloy /&gt;

* '''Signatures''' define the vocabulary of a model by creating new sets
::&lt;code&gt;'''sig''' Object{}&lt;/code&gt; defines a signature ''Object''
::&lt;code&gt;'''sig''' List{ head : '''lone''' Node }&lt;/code&gt; defines a signature ''List'' that contains a field ''head'' of type ''Node'' and multiplicity ''lone'' - this establishes the existence of a relation between ''List''s and ''Node''s such that every ''List'' is associated with no more than one head ''Node''

* '''Facts''' are constraints that are assumed to always hold
* '''Predicates''' are parameterized constraints, and can be used to represent operations
* '''Functions''' are expressions that return results
* '''Assertions''' are assumptions about the model

Because Alloy is a declarative language the meaning of a model is unaffected by the order of statements.

Then, the rectangle's [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] has measure 0, while its interior has  measure 1. Almost every point of the rectangle is an [[Interior (topology)#Interior point|interior point]], yet the interior has a nonempty [[complement (set theory)|complement]].]]
In [[measure theory]] (a branch of [[mathematical analysis]]), a property holds '''almost everywhere''' if, in a technical sense, the set for which the property holds takes up nearly all possibilities.  The notion of almost everywhere is a companion notion to the concept of [[measure zero]].  In the subject of [[probability]], which is largely based in measure theory, the notion is referred to as ''[[almost surely]]''.

More specifically, a property holds almost everywhere if the set of elements for which the property does not hold is a set of measure zero (Halmos 1974), or equivalently if the set of elements for which the property holds is [[conull set|conull]]. In cases where the measure is not [[Complete measure|complete]], it is sufficient that the set is contained within a set of measure zero. When discussing sets of [[real number]]s, the [[Lebesgue measure]] is assumed unless otherwise stated.

The term ''almost everywhere'' is abbreviated ''a.e.''; in older literature ''p.p.'' is used, to stand for the equivalent [[French language]] phrase ''presque partout''.

A set with '''full measure''' is one whose complement is of measure zero. In [[probability theory]], the terms ''[[almost surely]]'', ''almost certain'' and ''almost always'' refer to [[event (probability theory)|event]]s with [[probability]] 1, which are exactly the sets of full measure in a probability space.

Occasionally, instead of saying that a property holds almost everywhere, it is said that the property holds for '''almost all''' elements (though the term [[almost all]] also has other meanings).

== Definition ==

If &lt;math&gt;(X,\Sigma,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[measure space]], a property &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is said to hold almost everywhere in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if there exists a set &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mu(N) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and for &lt;math&gt;x\in X\setminus N&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has property &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. Another common way of expressing the same thing is to say that "almost every point satisfies &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;" or "for almost every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; holds".

It is ''not'' required that the set &lt;math&gt;\{x\in X: \neg P(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; has measure 0; it may not belong to &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

== Properties ==

* If property ''P'' holds almost everywhere and implies property ''Q'', then property ''Q'' holds almost everywhere. This follows from the [[Measure (mathematics)#Monotonicity|monotonicity]] of measures.
* If &lt;math&gt; (P_n) &lt;/math&gt; is a finite or countable sequence of properties, each of which holds almost everywhere, then their conjunction &lt;math&gt; \forall n P_n &lt;/math&gt; holds almost everywhere. This follows from the [[Measure (mathematics)#Measures of infinite unions of measurable sets|countable subadditivity]] of measures.
* By contrast, if  &lt;math&gt; (P_x)_{x\in \mathbf R} &lt;/math&gt; is an uncountable family of properties, each of which holds almost everywhere, then their conjunction &lt;math&gt; \forall x P_x &lt;/math&gt; does not necessarily hold almost everywhere. For example, if &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is Lebesgue measure on &lt;math&gt;X = \mathbf R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; P_x &lt;/math&gt; is the property of not being equal to &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt; P_x(y) &lt;/math&gt; is true if and only if &lt;math&gt; y \neq x&lt;/math&gt;), then each &lt;math&gt; P_x &lt;/math&gt; holds almost everywhere, but the conjunction &lt;math&gt; \forall x P_x &lt;/math&gt; does not hold anywhere.

As a consequence of the first two properties, it is often possible to reason about "almost every point" of a measure space as though it were an ordinary point rather than an abstraction. This is often done implicitly in informal mathematical arguments. However, one must be careful with this mode of reasoning because of the third bullet above: universal quantification over uncountable families of statements is valid for ordinary points but not for "almost every point".

== Examples ==
{{unordered list
| If ''f'' : '''R''' → '''R''' is a [[Lebesgue integral|Lebesgue integrable]] function and ''f''(''x'') ≥ 0 almost everywhere, then
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x) \, dx \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;}}
for all real numbers ''a'' &lt; ''b'' with equality [[iff]] &lt;math&gt;f(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; almost everywhere.
| If ''f'' : [''a'', ''b''] → '''R''' is a [[monotonic function]], then ''f'' is [[derivative|differentiable]] almost everywhere.
| If ''f'' : '''R''' → '''R''' is Lebesgue measurable and
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b |f(x)| \, dx &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;}}
for all real numbers ''a'' &lt; ''b'', then there exists a set ''E'' (depending on ''f'') such that, if ''x'' is in ''E'', the Lebesgue mean
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2\epsilon} \int_{x-\epsilon}^{x+\epsilon} f(t)\,dt&lt;/math&gt;}}
converges to ''f''(''x'') as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; decreases to zero. The set ''E'' is called the Lebesgue set of ''f''.  Its complement can be proved to have measure zero.  In other words, the Lebesgue mean of ''f'' converges to ''f'' almost everywhere.
| A bounded [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' is [[Riemann integral|Riemann integrable]] if and only if it is [[continuous function|continuous]] almost everywhere.
| As a curiosity, the decimal expansion of almost every real number in the interval [0, 1] contains the complete text of [[Shakespeare's plays]], encoded in [[ASCII]]; similarly for every other finite digit sequence, see [[Normal number]].}}

== Definition using ultrafilters ==

Outside of the context of real analysis, the notion of a property true almost everywhere is sometimes defined in terms of an [[ultrafilter]]. An ultrafilter on a set ''X'' is a maximal collection ''F'' of subsets of ''X'' such that:
# If ''U'' ∈ ''F'' and ''U'' ⊆ ''V'' then ''V'' ∈ ''F''
# The intersection of any two sets in ''F'' is in ''F''
# The empty set is not in ''F''
A property ''P'' of points in ''X'' holds almost everywhere, relative to an ultrafilter ''F'', if the set of points for which ''P'' holds is in ''F''.

For example, one construction of the [[hyperreal number]] system defines a hyperreal number as an equivalence class of sequences that are equal almost everywhere as defined by an ultrafilter.

The definition of ''almost everywhere'' in terms of ultrafilters is closely related to the definition in terms of measures, because each ultrafilter defines a finitely-additive measure taking only the values 0 and 1, where a set has measure 1 if and only if it is included in the ultrafilter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3238">In [[Category theory]], a branch of formal mathematics, an '''antiisomorphism''' (or '''anti-isomorphism''') between [[Mathematical structure|structured sets]] ''A'' and ''B'' is an [[isomorphism]] from ''A'' to the [[Dual (category theory)|opposite]] of ''B'' (or equivalently from the opposite of ''A'' to ''B'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pareigis|loc=p. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there exists an antiisomorphism between two structures, they are said to be ''antiisomorphic.''

Intuitively, to say that two mathematical structures are ''antiisomorphic'' is to say that they are basically opposites of one another.

The concept is particularly useful in an algebraic setting, as, for instance, when applied to [[ring (mathematics)|rings]].

==Simple example==
Let ''A'' be the [[binary relation]] (or [[directed graph]]) consisting of elements {1,2,3} and binary relation &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; defined as follows:
* &lt;math&gt;1 \rightarrow 2;&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;1 \rightarrow 3;&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;2 \rightarrow 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''B'' be the binary relation set consisting of elements {''a'',''b'',''c''} and binary relation &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; defined as follows:
* &lt;math&gt;b \Rightarrow a;&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;c \Rightarrow a;&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;a \Rightarrow b.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the opposite of ''B'' (denoted ''B''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;) is the same set of elements with the opposite binary relation &lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt; (that is, reverse all the arcs of the directed graph):
* &lt;math&gt;b \Leftarrow a;&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;c \Leftarrow a;&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;a \Leftarrow b.&lt;/math&gt;

If we replace ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' with 1, 2, and 3 respectively, we will see that each rule in ''B''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; is the same as some rule in ''A''. That is, we can define an isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; from ''A'' to ''B''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; by

&lt;math&gt;\phi(n) = \begin{cases}a&amp;\mbox{if }n=1;\\ b&amp;\mbox{if }n=2;\\ c&amp;\mbox{if }n=3.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

This &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is an antiisomorphism between ''A'' and ''B''.

==Ring anti-isomorphisms==
Specializing the general language of category theory to the algebraic topic of rings, we have:
Let ''R'' and ''S'' be rings and ''f'': ''R'' → ''S'' a [[bijection]] between them, then if
:&lt;math&gt;f(x +_R y) = f(x) +_S f(y) \text{  and  } f(x \cdot_R y) = f(y) \cdot_S f(x) \text{  for all  } x,y \in R&lt;/math&gt;
''f'' will be called a ''ring anti-isomorphism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobson|loc=p. 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''R'' = ''S'' then ''f'' will be called a ring ''anti-automorphism''.

An example of a ring anti-automorphism is given by the conjugate mapping of [[quaternion]]s:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baer|loc=p. 96}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; x_0 + x_1 \mathbf{i} + x_2 \mathbf{j} + x_3 \mathbf{k}\quad \mapsto \quad x_0 - x_1 \mathbf{i} - x_2 \mathbf{j} - x_3 \mathbf{k}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55696">In [[social choice theory]], '''Arrow's impossibility theorem''', the '''general possibility theorem''' or '''Arrow's paradox''' is an [[Proof of impossibility|impossibility theorem]] stating that when voters have three or more distinct alternatives (options), no [[ranked voting]] [[electoral system]] can convert the '''ranked preferences''' of individuals into a community-wide (complete and transitive) ranking while also meeting a specified set of criteria: ''[[unrestricted domain]]'', ''[[non-dictatorship]]'', ''[[Pareto efficiency]]'', and ''[[independence of irrelevant alternatives]]''. The theorem is often cited in discussions of voting theory as it is further interpreted by the [[Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem]]. The theorem is named after economist and Nobel laureate [[Kenneth Arrow]], who demonstrated the theorem in his doctoral thesis and popularized it in his 1951 book ''[[Social Choice and Individual Values]]''.  The original paper was titled "A Difficulty in the Concept of Social Welfare".{{sfnp|Arrow|1950}}

In short, the theorem states that no rank-order electoral system can be designed that always satisfies these three "fairness" criteria:

* If every voter prefers alternative X over alternative Y, then the group prefers X over Y.

* If every voter's preference between X and Y remains unchanged, then the group's preference between X and Y will also remain unchanged (even if voters' preferences between other pairs like X and Z, Y and Z, or Z and W change).

* There is no "[[dictator]]": no single voter possesses the power to always determine the group's preference.

[[Cardinal voting]] electoral systems are not covered by the theorem, as they convey more information than rank orders.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://electology.org/podcasts/2012-10-06_kenneth_arrow|title=Interview with Dr. Kenneth Arrow|last=|first=|date=October 6, 2012|website=The Center for Election Science|publisher=|access-date=|quote=''CES:'' you mention that your theorem applies to preferential systems or ranking systems. ...

The axiomatic approach Arrow adopted can treat all conceivable rules (that are based on preferences) within one unified framework. In that sense, the approach is qualitatively different from the earlier one in voting theory, in which rules were investigated one by one. One can therefore say that the contemporary paradigm of social choice theory started from this theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suzumura|first1=Kōtarō|authorlink1=Kotaro Suzumura|title=Introduction|at=In {{harvtxt|Arrow|Sen|Suzumura|2002|page=10}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practical consequences of the theorem are debatable: Arrow has said "Most systems are not going to work badly all of the time. All I proved is that all can work badly at times."&lt;ref name="ns12" /&gt;

== Statement of the theorem ==
The need to aggregate [[preference]]s occurs in many disciplines: in [[welfare economics]], where one attempts to find an economic outcome which would be acceptable and stable; in [[decision theory]], where a person has to make a rational choice based on several criteria; and most naturally in [[electoral system]]s, which are mechanisms for extracting a decision from a multitude of voters' preferences.

The framework for Arrow's theorem assumes that we need to extract a preference order on a given set of options (outcomes). Each individual in the society (or equivalently, each decision criterion) gives a particular order of preferences on the set of outcomes. We are searching for a [[ranked voting]] electoral system, called a ''social welfare function'' (''preference aggregation rule''), which transforms the set of preferences (''profile'' of preferences) into a single global societal preference order. Arrow's theorem says that if the decision-making body has at least two members and at least three options to decide among, then it is impossible to design a social welfare function that satisfies all these conditions (assumed to be a reasonable requirement of a fair electoral system) at once:
; [[Non-dictatorship]]: The social welfare function should account for the wishes of multiple voters. It cannot simply mimic the preferences of a single voter.
; [[Unrestricted domain]], or universality: For any set of individual voter preferences, the social welfare function should yield a unique and complete ranking of societal choices. Thus:{{bulleted list
 | It must do so in a manner that results in a complete ranking of preferences for society.
 | It must [[Deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministically]] provide the same ranking each time voters' preferences are presented the same way.
}}
; [[Independence of irrelevant alternatives#In social choice|Independence of irrelevant alternatives]] (IIA): The social preference between x and y should depend only on the individual preferences between x and y (''[[Learning to rank#Pairwise approach|pairwise]] independence''). More generally, changes in individuals' rankings of ''irrelevant'' alternatives (ones outside a certain subset) should have no impact on the societal ranking of the subset. For example, the introduction of a third candidate to a two-candidate election should not affect the outcome of the election unless the third candidate wins. (See Remarks below.)
; [[Monotonicity criterion|Monotonicity]], or positive association of social and individual values: If any individual modifies his or her preference order by promoting a certain option, then the societal preference order should respond only by promoting that same option or not changing, never by placing it lower than before. An individual should not be able to hurt an option by ranking it ''higher''.
; Non-imposition, or citizen sovereignty: Every possible societal preference order should be achievable by some set of individual preference orders. This means that the social welfare function is [[surjective function|surjective]]: It has an unrestricted target space.

A later (1963)&lt;ref name="Arrow 1963"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://cowles.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/pub/mon/m12-2-all.pdf|title=Social Choice and Individual Values|last=Arrow|first=Kenneth Joseph Arrow|date=1963|publisher=Yale University Press|year=|isbn=0300013647|location=|pages=|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; version of Arrow's theorem replaced the monotonicity and non-imposition criteria with:
; [[Pareto efficiency]], or '''unanimity''': If every individual prefers a certain option to another, then so must the resulting societal preference order. This, again, is a demand that the social welfare function will be minimally sensitive to the preference profile.

This later version is more general, having weaker conditions. The axioms of monotonicity, non-imposition, and IIA together imply Pareto efficiency, whereas Pareto efficiency (itself implying non-imposition) and IIA together do not imply monotonicity.

===Independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA)===
The IIA condition has three purposes (or effects):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Andreu Mas-Colell|first1=Andreu|last1=Mas-Colell|first2=Michael Dennis|last2=Whinston|first3=Jerry R.|last3=Green|year=1995|page=794|title=Microeconomic Theory|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-507340-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Normative: Irrelevant alternatives should not matter.
;Practical: Use of minimal information.
;Strategic: Providing the right incentives for the truthful revelation of individual preferences. Though the strategic property is conceptually different from IIA, it is closely related.

Arrow's death-of-a-candidate example (1963, page 26)&lt;ref name="Arrow 1963"/&gt; suggests that the agenda (the set of feasible alternatives) shrinks from, say, X = {a, b, c} to S = {a, b} because of the death of candidate c. This example is misleading since it can give the reader an impression that IIA is a condition involving ''two'' agenda and ''one'' profile. The fact is that IIA involves just ''one'' agendum ({x, y} in case of pairwise independence) but ''two'' profiles. If the condition is applied to this confusing example, it requires this: Suppose an aggregation rule satisfying IIA chooses b from the agenda {a, b} when the profile is given by (cab, cba), that is, individual 1 prefers c to a to b, 2 prefers c to b to a. Then, it must still choose b from {a, b} if the profile were, say: (abc, bac); (acb, bca); (acb, cba); or (abc, cba).

In different words, Arrow defines IIA as saying that the social preferences between alternatives x and y depend only on the individual preferences between x and y (not on those involving other candidates).

== Formal statement of the theorem ==
Let {{math|A}} be a set of '''outcomes''', {{math|''N''}} a number of '''voters''' or '''decision criteria'''. We shall denote the set of all full [[total order|linear orderings]] of {{math|A}} by {{math|L(A)}}.

A (strict) '''social welfare function''' ('''preference aggregation rule''') is a function
:&lt;math&gt; F : \mathrm{L(A)}^N \to \mathrm{L(A)} &lt;/math&gt;
which aggregates voters' preferences into a single preference order on {{math|A}}.&lt;ref&gt;Note that by definition, a ''social welfare function'' as defined here satisfies the Unrestricted domain condition.  Restricting the range to the social preferences that are never indifferent between distinct outcomes is probably a very restrictive assumption, but the goal here is to give a simple statement of the theorem.  Even if the restriction is relaxed, the impossibility result will persist.&lt;/ref&gt;

An {{math|''N''}}-[[tuple]] {{math|(''R''{{sub|1}}, …, ''R''{{sub|''N''}}) ∈ L(A){{sup|''N''}}}} of voters' preferences is called a ''preference profile''.  In its strongest and simplest form, Arrow's impossibility theorem states that whenever the set {{math|A}} of possible alternatives has more than 2 elements, then the following three conditions become incompatible:

; Unanimity, or weak Pareto efficiency: If alternative, {{math|'''a'''}}, is ranked strictly higher than {{math|'''b'''}} for all orderings {{math|''R''{{sub|1}} , …, ''R''{{sub|''N''}}}}, then {{math|'''a'''}} is ranked strictly higher than {{math|'''b'''}} by {{math|F(''R''{{sub|1}}, ''R''{{sub|2}}, …, ''R''{{sub|''N''}})}}. (Note that unanimity implies non-imposition.)
; Non-dictatorship: There is no individual, {{math|''i''}} whose strict preferences always prevail. That is, there is no {{math|''i'' ∈ {1, …, ''N''} }} such that for all {{math|(''R''{{sub|1}}, …, ''R''{{sub|''N''}}) ∈ L(A){{sup|''N''}}}}, {{math|'''a'''}} ranked strictly higher than {{math|'''b'''}} by {{math|''R{{sub|i}}''}} implies {{math|'''a'''}} ranked strictly higher than {{math|'''b'''}} by {{math|F(''R''{{sub|1}}, ''R''{{sub|2}}, …, ''R''{{sub|''N''}})}}, for all {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}}.
; [[Independence of irrelevant alternatives]]: For two preference profiles {{math|(''R''{{sub|1}}, …, ''R''{{sub|''N''}})}} and {{math|(''S''{{sub|1}}, …, ''S''{{sub|''N''}})}} such that for all individuals {{math|''i''}}, alternatives {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} have the same order in {{math|''R{{sub|i}}''}} as in {{math|''S{{sub|i}}''}}, alternatives {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} have the same order in {{math|F(''R''{{sub|1}}, ''R''{{sub|2}}, …, ''R''{{sub|''N''}})}} as in {{math|F(''S''{{sub|1}}, ''S''{{sub|2}}, …, ''S''{{sub|''N''}})}}.

== Informal proof ==
Based on two proofs{{sfnp|Geanakoplos|2005}}{{sfnp|Yu|2012}} appearing in ''[[Economic Theory (journal)|Economic Theory]]''.  For simplicity we have presented all rankings as if ties are impossible.  A complete proof taking possible ties into account is not essentially different from the one given here, except that one ought to say "not above" instead of "below" or "not below" instead of "above" in some cases.  Full details are given in the original articles.

We will prove that any social choice system respecting unrestricted domain, unanimity, and independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) is a dictatorship.  The key idea is to identify a ''pivotal voter'' whose ballot swings the societal outcome.  We then prove that this voter is a partial dictator (in a specific technical sense, described below).  Finally we conclude by showing that all of the partial dictators are the same person, hence this voter is a [[Non-dictatorship|dictator]].

=== Part one: There is a "pivotal" voter for B over A ===
[[File:Diagram for part one of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem.svg|thumb|right|300px|Part one: Successively move '''B''' from the bottom to the top of voters' ballots.  The voter whose change results in '''B''' being ranked over '''A''' is the ''pivotal voter for'' '''B''' ''over'' '''A'''.]]
Say there are three choices for society, call them '''A''', '''B''', and '''C'''.  Suppose first that everyone prefers option '''B''' the least: everyone prefers  '''A''' to '''B''', and everyone prefers '''C''' to '''B'''.  By unanimity, society must also prefer both '''A''' and '''C''' to '''B'''.  Call this situation ''profile 0''.

On the other hand, if everyone preferred '''B''' to everything else, then society would have to prefer '''B''' to everything else by unanimity.  Now arrange all the voters in some arbitrary but fixed order, and for each ''i'' let ''profile i'' be the same as ''profile 0'', but move '''B''' to the top of the ballots for voters 1 through ''i''.  So ''profile 1'' has '''B''' at the top of the ballot for voter 1, but not for any of the others.  ''Profile 2'' has '''B''' at the top for voters 1 and 2, but no others, and so on.

Since '''B''' eventually moves to the top of the societal preference, there must be some profile, number ''k'', for which '''B''' moves '''above A''' in the societal rank.  We call the voter whose ballot change causes this to happen the '''pivotal voter for B over A'''.  Note that the pivotal voter for '''B''' over '''A''' is not, [[a priori knowledge|a priori]], the same as the pivotal voter for '''A''' over '''B'''.  In part three of the proof we will show that these do turn out to be the same.

Also note that by IIA the same argument applies if ''profile 0'' is any profile in which '''A''' is ranked above '''B''' by every voter, and the pivotal voter for '''B''' over '''A''' will still be voter ''k''.  We will use this observation below.

=== Part two: The pivotal voter for B over A is a dictator for B over C ===
In this part of the argument we refer to voter ''k'', the pivotal voter for '''B''' over '''A''', as ''pivotal voter'' for simplicity.  We will show that pivotal voter dictates society's decision for '''B''' over '''C'''.  That is, we show that no matter how the rest of society votes, if Pivotal Voter ranks '''B''' over '''C''', then that is the societal outcome.  Note again that the dictator for '''B''' over '''C''' is not a priori the same as that for '''C''' over '''B'''.  In part three of the proof we will see that these turn out to be the same too.

[[File:Diagram for part two of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem.svg|thumb|right|300px|Part two:  Switching '''A''' and '''B''' on the ballot of voter ''k'' causes the same switch to the societal outcome, by part one of the argument.  Making any or all of the indicated switches to the other ballots has no effect on the outcome.]]
In the following, we call voters 1 through ''k − 1'', ''segment one'', and voters ''k + 1'' through ''N'', ''segment two''.  To begin, suppose that the ballots are as follows:
* Every voter in segment one ranks '''B''' above '''C''' and '''C''' above '''A'''.
* Pivotal voter ranks '''A''' above '''B''' and '''B''' above '''C'''.
* Every voter in segment two ranks '''A''' above '''B''' and '''B''' above '''C'''.

Then by the argument in part one (and the last observation in that part), the societal outcome must rank '''A''' above '''B'''.  This is because, except for a repositioning of '''C''', this profile is the same as ''profile k − 1'' from part one.  Furthermore, by unanimity the societal outcome must rank '''B''' above '''C'''.  Therefore, we know the outcome in this case completely.

Now suppose that pivotal voter moves '''B''' above '''A''', but keeps '''C''' in the same position and imagine that any number (or all!) of the other voters change their ballots to move '''B''' below '''C''', without changing the position of '''A'''.    Then aside from a repositioning of '''C''' this is the same as ''profile k'' from part one and hence the societal outcome ranks '''B''' above '''A'''.  Furthermore, by IIA the societal outcome must rank '''A''' above '''C''', as in the previous case.  In particular, the societal outcome ranks '''B''' above '''C''', even though Pivotal Voter may have been the ''only'' voter to rank '''B''' above '''C'''.  [[Condorcet paradox|By]] IIA, this conclusion holds independently of how '''A''' is positioned on the ballots, so pivotal voter is a dictator for '''B''' over '''C'''.

=== Part three: There can be at most one dictator ===
[[File:Diagram for part three of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem.svg|thumb|Part three: Since voter ''k'' is the dictator for '''B''' over '''C''', the pivotal voter for '''B''' over '''C''' must appear among the first ''k'' voters.  That is, ''outside'' of segment two.  Likewise, the pivotal voter for '''C''' over '''B''' must appear among voters ''k'' through ''N''.  That is, outside of Segment One.]]

In this part of the argument we refer back to the original ordering of voters, and compare the positions of the different pivotal voters (identified by applying parts one and two to the other pairs of candidates).  First, the pivotal voter for '''B''' over '''C''' must appear earlier (or at the same position) in the line than the dictator for '''B''' over '''C''':  As we consider the argument of part one applied to '''B''' and '''C''', successively moving '''B''' to the top of voters' ballots, the pivot point where society ranks '''B''' above '''C''' must come at or before we reach the dictator for '''B''' over '''C'''.  Likewise, reversing the roles of '''B''' and '''C''', the pivotal voter for '''C''' over '''B''' must be at or later in line than the dictator for '''B''' over '''C'''.  In short, if ''k''&lt;sub&gt;X/Y&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the position of the pivotal voter for '''X''' over '''Y''' (for any two candidates '''X''' and '''Y'''), then we have shown
:''k''&lt;sub&gt;B/C&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ k&lt;sub&gt;B/A&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''k''&lt;sub&gt;C/B&lt;/sub&gt;.

Now repeating the entire argument above with '''B''' and '''C''' switched, we also have
:''k''&lt;sub&gt;C/B&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B/C&lt;/sub&gt;.

Therefore, we have
:''k''&lt;sub&gt;B/C&lt;/sub&gt; = k&lt;sub&gt;B/A&lt;/sub&gt; = ''k''&lt;sub&gt;C/B&lt;/sub&gt;

and the same argument for other pairs shows that all the pivotal voters (and hence all the dictators) occur at the same position in the list of voters.  This voter is the dictator for the whole election.

== Interpretations of the theorem ==

Although Arrow's theorem is a mathematical result, it is often expressed in a non-mathematical way with a statement such as ''no voting method is fair'', ''every ranked voting method is flawed'', or ''the only voting method that isn't flawed is a dictatorship''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobooth.edu/capideas/blog/2016/march/what-economists-think-about-voting|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326065043/http://www.chicagobooth.edu/capideas/blog/2016/march/what-economists-think-about-voting|archive-date=2016-03-26|title=What economists think about voting|last=Cockrell|first=Jeff|date=2016-03-08|website=Capital Ideas|publisher=Chicago Booth|access-date=2016-09-05|quote=Is there such a thing as a perfect voting system? The respondents were unanimous in their insistence that there is not.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These statements are simplifications of Arrow's result which are not universally considered to be true. What Arrow's theorem does state is that a deterministic preferential voting mechanism—that is, one where a preference order is the only information in a vote, and any possible set of votes gives a unique result—cannot comply with all of the conditions given above simultaneously.

Various theorists have suggested [[Local independence of irrelevant alternatives|weakening the IIA criterion]] as a way out of the paradox. Proponents of ranked voting methods contend that the IIA is an unreasonably strong criterion.  It is the one breached in most useful [[electoral system]]s. Advocates of this position point out that failure of the standard IIA criterion is trivially implied by the possibility of [[Condorcet paradox|cyclic preferences]]. If voters cast ballots as follows:
* 1 vote for A &gt; B &gt; C
* 1 vote for B &gt; C &gt; A
* 1 vote for C &gt; A &gt; B
then the pairwise majority preference of the group is that A wins over B, B wins over C, and C wins over A: these yield [[rock-paper-scissors]] preferences for any pairwise comparison.  In this circumstance, ''any'' aggregation rule that satisfies the very basic majoritarian requirement that a candidate who receives a majority of votes must win the election, will fail the IIA criterion, if social preference is required to be transitive (or acyclic).  To see this, suppose that such a rule satisfies IIA.  Since majority preferences are respected, the society prefers A to B (two votes for A &gt; B and one for B &gt; A), B to C, and C to A.  Thus a cycle is generated, which contradicts the assumption that social preference is transitive.

So, what Arrow's theorem really shows is that any majority-wins electoral system is a non-trivial game, and that [[game theory]] should be used to predict the outcome of most voting mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;This does not mean various normative criteria will be satisfied if we use equilibrium concepts in game theory. Indeed, the mapping from profiles to equilibrium outcomes defines a social choice rule, whose performance can be investigated by social choice theory. See {{harvp|Austen-Smith|Banks|1999}} Section 7.2.&lt;/ref&gt; This could be seen as a discouraging result, because a game need not have efficient equilibria; e.g., a ballot could result in an alternative nobody really wanted in the first place, yet everybody voted for.

===Remark: Scalar rankings from a vector of attributes and the IIA property===
The IIA property might not be satisfied in human decision-making of realistic  complexity because the ''scalar'' preference ranking is effectively derived from the weighting—not usually explicit—of a ''vector'' of attributes (one book dealing with the Arrow theorem invites the reader to consider the related problem of creating a scalar measure for the track and field [[decathlon]] event—e.g. how does one make scoring 600 points in the discus event "commensurable" with scoring 600 points in the 1500&amp;nbsp;m race) and this scalar ranking can depend sensitively on the weighting of different attributes, with the tacit weighting itself affected by the context and contrast created by apparently "irrelevant" choices.  Edward MacNeal discusses this sensitivity problem with respect to the ranking of "most livable city" in the chapter "Surveys" of his book ''MathSemantics: making numbers talk sense'' (1994).

== Other possibilities ==
In an attempt to escape from the negative conclusion of Arrow's theorem, social choice theorists have investigated various possibilities ("ways out"). These investigations can be divided into the following two:
* those investigating functions whose domain, like that of Arrow's social welfare functions, consists of profiles of preferences;
* those investigating other kinds of rules.

=== Approaches investigating functions of preference profiles ===
This section includes approaches that deal with
* aggregation rules (functions that map each preference profile into a social preference), and
* other functions, such as functions that map each preference profile into an alternative.
Since these two approaches often overlap, we discuss them at the same time. What is characteristic of these approaches is that they investigate various possibilities by eliminating or weakening or replacing one or more conditions (criteria) that Arrow imposed.

==== Infinitely many individuals ====
Several theorists (e.g., Kirman and Sondermann&lt;ref name = kirman-s72&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Kirman | first1 = A.| last2 = Sondermann | first2 = D.| title = Arrow's theorem, many agents, and invisible dictators| journal = Journal of Economic Theory| volume = 5| pages = 267–277| year = 1972| doi = 10.1016/0022-0531(72)90106-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;) point out that when one drops the assumption that there are only finitely many individuals, one can find aggregation rules that satisfy all of Arrow's other conditions.

However, such aggregation rules are practically of limited interest, since they are based on [[ultrafilter]]s, highly non-constructive mathematical objects. In particular, Kirman and Sondermann argue that there is an "invisible dictator" behind such a rule.&lt;ref name = kirman-s72/&gt; Mihara&lt;ref name=mihara97&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Mihara |first1=H.

==== Limiting the number of alternatives ====
When there are only two alternatives to choose from, [[May's theorem]] shows that only simple majority rule satisfies a certain set of criteria (e.g., equal treatment of individuals and of alternatives; increased support for a winning alternative should not make it into a losing one). On the other hand, when there are at least three alternatives, Arrow's theorem points out the difficulty of collective decision making. Why is there such a sharp difference between the case of less than three alternatives and that of at least three alternatives?

''Nakamura's theorem'' (about the core of simple games) gives an answer more generally. It establishes that if the number of alternatives is less than a certain integer called the '''[[Nakamura number]]''', then the rule in question will identify "best" alternatives without any problem; if the number of alternatives is greater or equal to the Nakamura number, then the rule will not always work, since for some profile a voting paradox (a cycle such as alternative A socially preferred to alternative B, B to C, and C to A) will arise. Since the Nakamura number of majority rule is 3 (except the case of four individuals), one can conclude from Nakamura's theorem that majority rule can deal with up to two alternatives rationally. Some super-majority rules (such as those requiring 2/3 of the votes) can have a Nakamura number greater than 3, but such rules violate other conditions given by Arrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Austen-Smith|Banks|1999|loc=Chapter 3}} gives a detailed discussion of the approach trying to limit the number of alternatives.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pairwise voting====
A common way "around" Arrow's paradox is limiting the alternative set to two alternatives. Thus, whenever more than two alternatives should be put to the test, it seems very tempting to use a mechanism that pairs them and votes by pairs. As tempting as this mechanism seems at first glance, it is generally far from satisfying even [[Pareto efficiency]], not to mention IIA. The specific order by which the pairs are decided strongly influences the outcome. This is not necessarily a bad feature of the mechanism. Many sports use the tournament mechanism—essentially a pairing mechanism—to choose a winner.  This gives considerable opportunity for weaker teams to win, thus adding interest and tension throughout the tournament. This means that the person controlling the order by which the choices are paired (the agenda maker) has great control over the outcome. In any case, when viewing the entire voting process as one game, Arrow's theorem still applies.

==== Domain restrictions ====
Another approach is relaxing the universality condition, which means restricting the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of aggregation rules. The best-known result along this line assumes "single peaked" preferences.

[[Duncan Black]] has shown that if there is only one dimension on which every individual has a "single-peaked" preference, then all of Arrow's conditions are met by [[majority rule]]. Suppose that there is some predetermined linear ordering of the alternative set. An individual's preference is ''single-peaked'' with respect to this ordering if he has some special place that he likes best along that line, and his dislike for an alternative grows larger as the alternative goes further away from that spot (i.e., the graph of his utility function has a single peak if alternatives are placed according to the linear ordering on the horizontal axis).  For example, if voters were voting on where to set the volume for music, it would be reasonable to assume that each voter had their own ideal volume preference and that as the volume got progressively too loud or too quiet they would be increasingly dissatisfied.
If the domain is restricted to profiles in which every individual has a single peaked preference with respect to the linear ordering, then ''simple''&lt;ref name="austensmith-b99"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Austen-Smith | first1 = David | last2 = Banks | first2 = Jeffrey S. | title = Positive political theory I: Collective preference |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nxXDn3nPxIAC&amp;q=%22nakamura+number%22 | year = 1999 | publisher = University of Michigan Press | location = Ann Arbor  | isbn = 978-0-472-08721-1 | pages =   | accessdate = 2016-02-16 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; aggregation rules, which includes majority rule, have an ''acyclic'' (defined below) social preference, hence "best" alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Indeed, many different social welfare functions can meet Arrow's conditions under such restrictions of the domain. It has been proved, however, that under any such restriction, if there exists any social welfare function that adheres to Arrow's criteria, then the majority rule will adhere to Arrow's criteria. See {{cite journal |last=Campbell |first=D. E. |last2=Kelly |first2=J. S. |title=A simple characterization of majority rule |journal=[[Economic Theory (journal)|Economic Theory]] |volume=15 |issue=3 |year=2000 |pages=689–700 |doi=10.1007/s001990050318 |jstor=25055296}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, when there are odd number of individuals, then the social preference becomes transitive, and the socially "best" alternative is equal to the median of all the peaks of the individuals (Black's [[median voter theorem]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Black | first = Duncan | authorlink = Duncan Black | title = The theory of committees and elections | year = 1968 | publisher = University Press | location = Cambridge, Eng. | isbn = 0-89838-189-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Under single-peaked preferences, the majority rule is in some respects the most natural voting mechanism.

One can define the notion of "single-peaked" preferences on higher-dimensional sets of alternatives. However, one can identify the "median" of the peaks only in exceptional cases. Instead, we typically have the destructive situation suggested by McKelvey's [[McKelvey-Schofield chaos theorem|Chaos Theorem]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McKelvey | first1 = Richard D. | authorlink = Richard McKelvey | title = Intransitivities in multidimensional voting models and some implications for agenda control | journal = Journal of Economic Theory | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 472–482 | year = 1976 | doi = 10.1016/0022-0531(76)90040-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; for any ''x'' and ''y'', one can find a sequence of alternatives such that ''x'' is beaten by ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' by a majority, ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' by ''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', up to ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' by ''y''.

==== Relaxing transitivity ====
By relaxing the transitivity of social preferences, we can find aggregation rules that satisfy Arrow's other conditions. If we impose ''neutrality'' (equal treatment of alternatives) on such rules, however, there exists an individual who has a "veto". So the possibility provided by this approach is also very limited.

First, suppose that a social preference is [[Quasitransitive relation|''quasi-transitive'']] (instead of transitive); this means that the strict preference &lt;math&gt;\succ&lt;/math&gt; ("better than") is transitive: if &lt;math&gt;x \succ y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y \succ z&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x \succ z&lt;/math&gt;. Then, there do exist non-dictatorial aggregation rules satisfying Arrow's conditions, but such rules are ''oligarchic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibbard|first=Allan F.|authorlink=Allan Gibbard|doi=10.1007/s10058-014-0158-1|title=Intransitive social indifference and the Arrow dilemma|year=2014|orig-year=1969|volume=18|issue=1|pages=3–10|journal=Review of Economic Design}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that there exists a coalition L such that L is ''decisive'' (if every member in L prefers x to y, then the society prefers x to y), and each member in L ''has a veto'' (if she prefers x to y, then the society cannot prefer y to x).

Second, suppose that a social preference is ''acyclic'' (instead of transitive): there do not exist alternatives &lt;math&gt;x_1, \ldots, x_k&lt;/math&gt; that form a ''cycle'' (&lt;math&gt;x_1 \succ x_2, \; x_2 \succ x_3, \; \ldots, \; x_{k-1} \succ x_k, \; x_k \succ x_1&lt;/math&gt;). Then, provided that there are at least as many alternatives as individuals, an aggregation rule satisfying Arrow's other conditions is ''collegial''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=D. J. |year=1975 |title=Aggregation of Preferences |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=456–469 |jstor=1885263 | doi = 10.2307/1885263 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that there are individuals who belong to the intersection ("collegium") of all decisive coalitions. If there is someone who has a veto, then he belongs to the collegium. If the rule is assumed to be neutral, then it does have someone who has a veto.

Finally, Brown's theorem left open the case of acyclic social preferences where the number of alternatives is less than the number of individuals. One can give a definite answer for that case using the ''Nakamura number''.  See [[#Limiting the number of alternatives|limiting the number of alternatives]].

==== Relaxing IIA ====
There are numerous examples of aggregation rules satisfying Arrow's conditions except IIA. The [[Borda count|Borda rule]] is one of them. These rules, however, are susceptible to ''strategic manipulation'' by individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Blair | first1 = Douglas | first2 = Eitan  | last2 = Muller | title = Essential aggregation procedures on restricted domains of preferences | journal = Journal of Economic Theory | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 34–53 | year = 1983 | doi = 10.1016/0022-0531(83)90092-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

See also [[#Interpretations of the theorem|Interpretations of the theorem]] above.

==== Relaxing the Pareto criterion ====
Wilson (1972)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wilson |first = Robert | year = 1972| title = Social Choice Theory without the Pareto principle | journal = [[Journal of Economic Theory]] | volume =  5|issue = 3 | pages= 478–486| doi= 10.1016/0022-0531(72)90051-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that if an aggregation rule is non-imposed and non-null, then there is either a dictator or an inverse dictator, provided that Arrow's conditions other than Pareto are also satisfied. Here, an ''inverse dictator'' is an individual ''i'' such that whenever ''i'' prefers ''x'' to ''y'', then the society prefers ''y'' to&amp;nbsp;''x''.

===== Remark =====
[[Amartya Sen]] offered both relaxation of transitivity and removal of the Pareto principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sen |first=Amartya |authorlink=Amartya Sen|year=1979 |title=Personal Utilities and Public Judgements: Or What's Wrong With Welfare Economics |journal=[[Economic Journal]] |volume=89 |issue=355 |pages=537–588 |jstor=2231867 |doi=10.2307/2231867}}&lt;/ref&gt; He demonstrated another interesting impossibility result, known as the "impossibility of the Paretian Liberal" (see [[liberal paradox]] for details). Sen went on to argue that this demonstrates the futility of demanding Pareto optimality in relation to voting mechanisms.

==== Social choice instead of social preference ====
In social decision making, to rank all alternatives is not usually a goal.  It often suffices to find some alternative. The approach focusing on choosing an alternative investigates either ''social choice functions'' (functions that map each preference profile into an alternative) or ''social choice rules'' (functions that map each preference profile into a subset of alternatives).

As for social choice functions, the [[Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem]] is well-known, which states that if a social choice function whose range contains at least three alternatives is strategy-proof, then it is dictatorial.

As for social choice rules, we should assume there is a social preference behind them. That is, we should regard a rule as choosing the maximal elements ("best" alternatives) of some social preference. The set of maximal elements of a social preference is called the ''core''. Conditions for existence of an alternative in the core have been investigated in two approaches. The first approach assumes that preferences are at least ''acyclic'' (which is necessary and sufficient for the preferences to have a maximal element on any ''finite'' subset).  For this reason, it is closely related to [[#Relaxing transitivity|relaxing transitivity]]. The second approach drops the assumption of acyclic preferences. Kumabe and Mihara&lt;ref name="kumabe-m10geb"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Kumabe | first1 = M.| last2 = Mihara | first2 = H. R.| title = Preference aggregation theory without acyclicity: the core without majority dissatisfaction| journal = Games and Economic Behavior| volume = 72| pages = 187–201| year = 2011| doi = 10.1016/j.geb.2010.06.008| url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/23918/2/MPRA_paper_23918.pdf| arxiv = 1107.0431}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopt this approach. They make a more direct assumption that individual preferences have maximal elements, and examine conditions for the social preference to have a maximal element. See [[Nakamura number]] for details of these two approaches.

=== Rated electoral system and other approaches ===

Arrow originally rejected [[cardinal utility]] as a meaningful tool for expressing social welfare,&lt;ref&gt;"Modern economic theory has insisted on the ordinal concept of utility; that is, only orderings can be observed, and therefore no measurement of utility independent of these orderings has any significance. In the field of consumer's demand theory the ordinalist position turned out to create no problems; cardinal utility had no explanatory power above and beyond ordinal. Leibniz' Principle of the [[identity of indiscernibles]] demanded then the excision of cardinal utility from our thought patterns." Arrow (1967), as quoted on [https://books.google.com/books?id=7ECXDjlCpB0C&amp;pg=PA33 p.&amp;nbsp;33] by {{citation|title=The Active Consumer: Novelty and Surprise in Consumer Choice|volume=20|series=Routledge Frontiers of Political Economy|editor-first=Marina|editor-last=Bianchi|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|contribution=Choice without utility? Some reflections on the loose foundations of standard consumer theory|pages=21–45|first=Fabio|last=Racnchetti}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so focused his theorem on preference rankings, but later stated that a cardinal [[Score voting|score]] system with three or four classes "is probably the best".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Arrow's framework assumes that individual and social preferences are "orderings" (i.e., satisfy completeness and transitivity) on the set of alternatives. This means that if the preferences are represented by a [[utility function]], its value is an ''ordinal'' utility in the sense that it is meaningful so far as the greater value indicates the better alternative. For instance, having ordinal utilities of 4, 3, 2, 1 for alternatives a, b, c, d, respectively, is the same as having 1000, 100.01, 100, 0, which in turn is the same as having 99, 98, 1, .997. They all represent the ordering in which a is preferred to b to c to d. The assumption of ''ordinal'' preferences, which precludes ''interpersonal comparisons'' of utility, is an integral part of Arrow's theorem.

For various reasons, an approach based on [[cardinal utility]], where the utility has a meaning beyond just giving a ranking of alternatives, is not common in contemporary economics. However, once one adopts that approach, one can take [[intensity of preference|intensities of preferences]] into consideration, or one can compare (i) gains and losses of utility or (ii) levels of utility, across different individuals. In particular, Harsanyi (1955)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harsanyi|first=John C.|date=1955|title=Cardinal Welfare, Individualistic Ethics, and Interpersonal Comparisons of Utility|jstor=1827128|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=63|issue=4|pages=309–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives a justification of [[utilitarianism]] (which evaluates alternatives in terms of the sum of individual utilities), originating from [[Jeremy Bentham]]. Hammond (1976)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hammond|first=Peter J.|date=1976|title=Equity, Arrow's Conditions, and Rawls' Difference Principle|jstor=1913445|journal=Econometrica|volume=44|issue=4|pages=793–804|doi=10.2307/1913445}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives a justification of the [[Maximin principle#Maximin in philosophy|maximin principle]] (which evaluates alternatives in terms of the utility of the worst-off individual), originating from [[John Rawls]].

Not all voting methods use, as input, only an ordering of all candidates.&lt;ref&gt;It is sometimes asserted that such methods may trivially fail the ''universality'' criterion.  However, it is more appropriate to consider that such methods fail Arrow's definition of an aggregation rule (or that of a function whose domain consists of preference profiles), if preference orderings cannot uniquely translate into a ballot.&lt;/ref&gt; Methods which don't, often called "rated" or "cardinal" (as opposed to "ranked", "ordinal", or "preferential") electoral system, can be viewed as using information that only cardinal utility can convey. In that case, it is not surprising if some of them satisfy all of Arrow's conditions that are reformulated.{{refn| However, a modified version of Arrow's theorem may still apply to such methods (e.g., Brams and Fishburn, in {{harvtxt|Arrow|Sen|Suzumura|2002|loc=Chapter 4, Theorem 4.2}}).}}
[[Range voting]] is such a method.&lt;ref name="ns12"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKenna|first=Phil|date=12 April 2008|title=Vote of no confidence|url=http://rangevoting.org/McKennaText.txt|journal=New Scientist|volume=198|issue=2651|pages=30–33|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(08)60914-8|pmid=|access-date=|lay-url=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =warrensmith&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Whether such a claim is correct depends on how each condition is reformulated.{{refn
| No voting method that nontrivially uses cardinal utility satisfies Arrow's IIA (in which preference profiles are replaced by lists of ballots or lists of utilities). For this reason, a weakened notion of IIA is proposed (e.g., {{harvtxt|Sen|1979|page=129}}). The notion requires that the social ranking of two alternatives depend only on the ''levels of utility'' attained by individuals at the two alternatives. (More formally, a ''social welfare functional'' &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a function that maps each list &lt;math&gt;u=(u_1, \ldots, u_n)&lt;/math&gt; of utility functions into a social preference. &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; satisfies ''IIA (for social welfare functionals)'' if for all lists &lt;math&gt;u, u'&lt;/math&gt; and for all alternatives &lt;math&gt;x, y&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;u_i(x)=u'_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_i(y)=u'_i(y)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;xF(u)y \text{ iff } xF(u')y&lt;/math&gt;.) Many cardinal voting methods (including [[range voting]]) satisfy the weakened version of IIA.
}} Other rated electoral system which pass certain generalizations of Arrow's criteria include [[approval voting]] and [[majority judgment]]. Note that Arrow's theorem does not apply to single-winner methods such as these, but [[Gibbard's theorem]] still does: no non-defective electoral system is fully strategy-free, so the informal dictum that "no electoral system is perfect" still has a mathematical basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hbxL3A-pWagC&amp;lpg=PA317&amp;ots=epHDkYZByC&amp;dq=%22gibbard%22%20%22utilitarian%20voting%22&amp;pg=PA185#v=onepage&amp;q=gibbard&amp;f=false|title=Gaming the Vote: Why Elections Aren't Fair (and What We Can Do About It)|last=Poundstone|first=William|date=2009-02-17|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780809048922|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, though not an approach investigating some kind of rules, there is a criticism by [[James M. Buchanan]], [[Charles Plott]], and others. It argues that it is silly to think that there might be ''social'' preferences that are analogous to ''individual'' preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TmW5ahsMLIC|title=Welfare Economics and Social Choice Theory|last=Feldman|first=Allan M.|last2=Serrano|first2=Roberto|year=2006|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9780387293684|language=en|quote=It is quite silly in the first place to think that there might be social preferences that are analogous to individual preferences. It is nonsense to talk about social preferences since society itself is nothing more than a collection of individuals, each with his own interests. ... this first reaction to Arrow's Theorem is logically attractive, but it can lead to varieties of nihilism that are unappealing to some people, including us.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrow (1963, Chapter 8)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lo2uCECV__8C|title=Social Choice and Individual Values|last=Arrow|first=Kenneth Joseph|year=1963|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300013647|pages=103–109|chapter=Chapter VIII Notes on the Theory of Social Choice, Section III. What Is the Problem of Social Choice?|quote=these criticisms are based on misunderstandings of my position}}&lt;/ref&gt; answers this sort of criticism seen in the early period, which come at least partly from misunderstanding.

A multi-pronged refutation of Arrow's theorem was published by philosophy Professor Howard DeLong in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Refutation of Arrow's Theorem|last=DeLong|first=Howard|publisher=University Press of America|year=1991|isbn=978-0819182500}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/9661/1/MPRA_paper_9661.pdf |title=Review of Howard DeLong (1991), 'A refutation of Arrow's theorem', with a reaction, also on its relevance in 2008 for the European Union |first=Thomas |last=Colignatus |date=21 July 2008 |access-date=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He challenges the theorem on the basis that Arrow wrongly assumes Preference is transitive property and that Collective Preference is the same as summing up individual preferences.   He also claims that Arrow's model fails to model democracy as it exists in the real world as the model ignores the possibility of consensual temporary dictatorships (ie: Greek tyrants in times of war)  and the effect of allowing lotteries to decide tie breakers and to avoid the problem of the tyranny of the majority, the example used being a group of campers at a summer camp, 8 of whom prefer cake, 7 who prefer ice cream, but funds are limited to one choice or the other on a weekly basis. Under the collective preference of majority rule each week the group would select cake.  By drawing lots the choices would more accurately reflect the preferences of the collective than the majority.&lt;ref&gt;DeLong, Ch 5&lt;/ref&gt;  DeLong also criticizes Arrow's model for being hedonistic and not incorporating a sense of morality and social justice.

'''Bhama Srinivasan''' (born 22 April 1935&lt;ref name="Bhama Srinivasan The Invasion of Geometry into Finite Group Theory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bhama Srinivasan The Invasion of Geometry into Finite Group Theory|url=http://www.awm-math.org/noetherbrochure/Srinivasan90.html|publisher=awm-math.org|accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a mathematician known for her work in the [[representation theory of finite groups]].  Her contributions were honored with the 1990 [[Noether Lecture]].  She served as President of the [[Association for Women in Mathematics]] from 1981 to 1983.  She earned her Ph.D. in physics in 1959 with her dissertation ''Problems on Modular Representations of Finite Groups'' under [[Sandy Green (mathematician)|J. A. Green]] at the [[University of Manchester]].  She currently is a professor at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].  She has had five doctoral students.  She has co-authored a number of papers with Paul Fong in [[modular representation theory]] and [[Deligne–Lusztig theory]].

Srinivasan was born in Madras,India. She attended the [[University of Madras]], where she earned her bachelor of arts degree in 1954 and her master of science degree in 1955. She traveled to England for her doctoral study. She remained in England to commence her professional academic career as a lecturer in mathematics at the [[University of Keele]] from 1960 through 1964. She then pursued a postdoctoral fellowship at the [[University of British Columbia]] through the National research Council of Canada from 1965 through 1966.She returned home to India to teach at the Ramanujan Institute of Mathematics of her Alma mater, the [[University of Madras]], from 1966 though 1970.
Srinivasan then immigrated to the United States, where she taught for the next decade at [[Clark University]] in Worcester, Massachusetts, as an associate professor. In 1977, she became a naturalized citizen of the United States. That year, she was a member of the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton. In 1980, she commenced her longstanding tenure at the [[University of Illinois]] as a professor of mathematics at the Chicago Circle campus.

Srinivasan has distinguished herself in her field throughout her career. In January, 1979, she delivered the Invited Address to the American Mathematical Society(AMS)&lt;ref&gt;url=http://www.ams.org/home/page&lt;/ref&gt; at the Joint Mathematics Meetings in Biloxi, Mississippi. She has also been invited to fill visiting professorships internationally at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, the [[University of Essen]] in Germany, [[Sydney University]],and the [[Science University of Tokyo]] in Japan. She has served as an editor for several journals in her field: ''Proceedings of the AMS'' (from 1983 through 1987); ''Communications in Algebra'' (from 1978 through 1984); ''Mathematical Surveys and Monographs'' (from 1991 through 1993). From 1991 through 1994, she served on the Editorial Boards Committee of the AMS.

Srinivasan collaborated with Paul Fong on finite groups of the Lie type, and this work has been linked to Lusztig's research on quantum groups, thus crossing over between mathematics and physics. Although Srinivasan generally advocates pure mathematical research, resisting the temptation to find a practical application for all mathematics, she nevertheless got excited by the application of her research to physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oakes|first=Elizabeth H.|title=International encyclopedia of women scientists|date=2002|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York, NY|isbn=0816043817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 she became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-07-26.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, she was selected as a fellow of the [[Association for Women in Mathematics]] in the inaugural class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Launch of the AWM Fellows Program|url=https://sites.google.com/site/awmmath/awm-fellows|website=sites.google.com/site/awmmath/|publisher=Association for Women in Mathematics|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bronshtein and Semendyayev''''' (often just '''''Bronshtein''''' or '''''Bronstein''''') is the informal name of a comprehensive handbook of fundamental working knowledge of mathematics and table of formulas originally compiled by the Russian mathematician [[Ilya Nikolaevich Bronshtein]] and engineer [[Konstantin Adolfovic Semendyayev]].

The work was first published in 1945 in Russia&lt;ref name="Ziegler_2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Girlich_2014"/&gt; and soon became a "standard" and frequently used guide for scientists, engineers, and technical university students. Over the decades, high popularity and a string of translations, extensions, re-translations and major revisions by various editors led to a complex international publishing history centered around the significantly expanded German version. Legal hurdles following the [[fall of the Iron Curtain]] caused the development to split into several independent branches maintained by different publishers and editors to the effect that there are now two considerably different publications associated with the original title – and both of them are available in several languages.

With some slight variations, the English version of the book was originally named '''''A Guide-Book to Mathematics''''', but changed its name to '''''Handbook of Mathematics'''''. This name is still maintained up to the present by one of the branches. The other line is meanwhile named '''''Users' Guide to Mathematics''''' to help avoid confusion.

== {{anchor|Bronshtein|Semendyayev}}Overview ==
''Bronshtein and Semendyayev'' is a comprehensive handbook of fundamental working knowledge of mathematics and table of formulas based on the Russian book '''{{lang|ru|Справочник по математике для инженеров и учащихся втузов}}''' (''Spravochnik po matematike dlya inzhenerov i uchashchikhsya vtuzov'', literally: "Handbook of mathematics for engineers and students of technical universities") compiled by the Russian mathematician Ilya Nikolaevich Bronshtein (Russian: Илья Николаевич Бронштейн, German: Ilja Nikolajewitsch Bronstein)&lt;ref group="nb" name="Bronshtein_Bio"/&gt; and engineer Konstantin Adolfovic Semendyayev (Russian: Константин Адольфович Семендяев, German: Konstantin Adolfowitsch Semendjajew).&lt;ref name="Ziegler_2002"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="Semendyayev_Bio"/&gt;

The scope is the concise discussion of all major fields of applied mathematics by definitions, tables and examples with a focus on practicability and with limited formal rigour. The work also contains a comprehensive list of analytically solvable [[integral]]s, that is, those integrals which can be described in closed form with [[antiderivative]]s.

== {{anchor|Ziegler|Grosche|Zeidler|Musiol|Mühlig}}History ==
The two Russian authors originally wrote the book in 1939/1940.&lt;ref name="Ziegler_2002"/&gt; [[Hot lead typesetting]] had already started when the [[Siege of Leningrad]] prohibited further development and the [[print matrices]] were relocated.&lt;ref name="Ziegler_2002"/&gt; After the war, they were considered lost, but could be found again years later, so that the first edition of '''{{lang|ru|Справочник по математике для инженеров и учащихся втузов}}''' could finally be published in 1945.&lt;ref name="Ziegler_2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Girlich_2014"/&gt;

The expanded German translation '''''Taschenbuch der Mathematik''''' (literally: "Pocketbook of mathematics") by Viktor Ziegler&lt;ref name="Ziegler_2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Girlich_2014"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="Ziegler_V_Bio"/&gt; was first published in 1958 by [[B. G. Teubner Verlag|B. G. Teubner]] in Leipzig.&lt;ref name="Ziegler_2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Girlich_2014"/&gt;

Based on the German translation, an English translation became available as well under the title '''''A Guide-Book to Mathematics''''' in 1964, first by [[Pergamon Press]] and [[The Macmillan Company]], later by [[Springer Verlag New York, Inc.|Springer Verlag]] and [[Verlag Harri Deutsch]].

In 1966 it became apparent that the title needed considerable updates to meet new requirements.&lt;ref name="Ziegler_2002"/&gt; The original authors felt too old to continue the work and the Russian publisher [[Nauka (publisher)|Nauka]] ([[Наука (publisher)|Наука]]) seemed to have had lost interest in the further development as well for some while.&lt;ref name="Ziegler_2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Girlich_2014"/&gt; Therefore, in 1970 a consortium of East-German mathematicians were contracted by Teubner Verlag to start to expand and revise the work.&lt;ref name="Ziegler_2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Girlich_2014"/&gt; This was coordinated by Viktor Ziegler,&lt;ref group="nb" name="Ziegler_V_Bio"/&gt; Dorothea Ziegler&lt;ref group="nb" name="Ziegler_D_Bio"/&gt; and Günter Grosche&lt;ref group="nb" name="Grosche_G_Bio"/&gt; ([[Universität Leipzig]]).&lt;ref name="Ziegler_2002"/&gt; While Semendyayev contributed some work,&lt;ref name="Girlich_2014"/&gt; he did not want some other new chapters to be included in the manuscript in 1976, therefore they had to be split out into a new volume II.&lt;ref name="Ziegler_2002"/&gt; Finally, after almost a decade of work, the major new revision could be published in 1979, legally as a cooperation of Teubner and Nauka (Наука).&lt;ref name="Ziegler_2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Girlich_2014"/&gt;

The reworked two-volume German edition was well received and again became a "standard" in [[higher mathematics]] education in Germany.&lt;ref name="Ziegler_2002"/&gt; This led to a string of high-volume revisions&lt;ref name="Ziegler_2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Girlich_2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiss_2002"/&gt; and various translations (including into Russian, English, Japanese, and Spanish) to meet the international demand. The English version was published by [[Van Nostrand Reinhold Company]] and [[Verlag Harri Deutsch]] as '''''Handbook of Mathematics'''''.

A decade later the German '[[Wende (GDR)|Wende]]' and the later [[German reunification|reunification]] led to considerable changes in the publishing environment in Germany between 1989 and 1991.&lt;ref name="Frondeville_1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rumland_1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elteste_1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reich_1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Links_2010"/&gt; The East-German publisher Teubner Leipzig was integrated into the West-German publisher Teubner Stuttgart.&lt;ref name="Kraemer_2003"/&gt; These changes put an end to the cooperation of the East-German Teubner Verlag with the West-German [[Verlag Harri Deutsch]], who had been licensing this and other titles for distribution in Germany and Switzerland,&lt;ref name="Girlich_2014"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="HD_License"/&gt; a business model no longer working in a free market. Licensing issues caused the development to split into two independent branches by the two publishing houses:

Verlag Harri Deutsch contracted {{Interlanguage link multi|Gerhard Musiol|de}}&lt;ref group="nb" name="Musiol_G_Bio"/&gt; and Heiner Mühlig&lt;ref group="nb" name="Mühlig_H_Bio"/&gt; to translate&lt;ref name="Girlich_2014"/&gt; the last non-Teubner influenced edition (officially the latest revision (1977)&lt;ref name="Musiol_1993"/&gt; of the third Russian edition (1953),&lt;ref name="Musiol_1993"/&gt; which is actually the eleventh Russian edition (1967)) into German for a major rework of '''''Taschenbuch der Mathematik''''' as a single-volume title.&lt;ref name="Girlich_2014"/&gt; This was first published in 1992/1993. When Verlag Harri Deutsch closed two decades later, {{Interlanguage link multi|Europa-Lehrmittel|de}} took over in 2013, and they continue to maintain this work up to the present.&lt;ref name="BM_2013-05-17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boersenblatt_2013-05-21"/&gt; The new English translation (now by [[Springer Verlag]]) is still called '''''Handbook of Mathematics'''''.

In a parallel development, {{Interlanguage link multi|Eberhard Zeidler (mathematician)|de|3=Eberhard Zeidler (Mathematiker)|lt=Eberhard Zeidler}}&lt;ref group="nb" name="Zeidler_E_Bio"/&gt; became editor for the latest existing German edition by Teubner (1990),&lt;ref name="Girlich_2014"/&gt; the version which had previously also been distributed by Verlag Harri Deutsch, and updated it significantly to become the '''''Teubner-Taschenbuch der Mathematik'''''&lt;ref name="Weiss_2002"/&gt; (literally: "Teubner pocketbook of mathematics") for Teubner. This was first published in 1995/1996 – still as a two-volume work. The work was continued by [[Vieweg+Teubner Verlag]] after the merger with {{Interlanguage link multi|Vieweg Verlag|de}} in 2003. When Vieweg+Teubner was bought by Springer and renamed [[Springer Vieweg Verlag]], several new chapters were added and some more advanced contents stripped out for the single-volume '''''Springer-Taschenbuch der Mathematik''''' (literally: "Springer pocketbook of mathematics") in 2012/2013.&lt;ref name="Girlich_2014"/&gt; This is now accompanied by a completely reworked and considerably expanded four-volume series named '''''Springer-Handbuch der Mathematik''''' (literally: "Springer handbook of mathematics") by Zeidler also based on the former ''Bronshtein and Semendyayev''.&lt;ref name="Girlich_2014"/&gt; So far, this latest revision of the alternative development branch isn't available in English, but volume I of the former ''Teubner-Taschenbuch der Mathematik'' has been translated and published by [[Oxford University Press]] as '''''Oxford Users' Guide to Mathematics''''' already.

Due to ''Bronshtein and Semendyayev'' containing a comprehensive table of analytically solvable integrals, integrals are sometimes referred to as being "''Bronshtein-integrable''" in German universities if they can be looked up in the book (in playful analogy to terms like ''[[Riemann-integrability]]'' and ''[[Lebesgue-integrable|Lebesgue-integrability]]'').&lt;ref name="Bronstein-integrable"/&gt;&lt;!-- http://www.physik.uni-muenchen.de/lehre/vorlesungen/wise_10_11/biophsics_of_macromolecules/tutorial/ueb-5-loesung.pdf --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5502">In [[economics]] and [[game theory]], '''complete information''' is an economic situation or game in which knowledge about other market participants or players is available to all participants. The utility functions, payoffs, strategies and "types" of players are thus [[Common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]].

Inversely, in a '''game with incomplete information''', players do not possess full information about their opponents. Some players possess private information, a fact that the others should take into account when forming expectations about how those players will behave. A typical example is an [[auction]]: each player knows his own utility function (= valuation for the item), but does not know the utility function of the other players. See &lt;ref name=l02&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levin|first1=Jonathan|title=Games with Incomplete Information|url=http://web.stanford.edu/~jdlevin/Econ%20203/Bayesian.pdf|year=2002|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for more examples.

Games of incomplete information arise most frequently in social science rather than as games in the narrow sense.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}  For instance, [[John Harsanyi]] was motivated by consideration of arms control negotiations, where the players may be uncertain both of the capabilities of their opponents and of their desires and beliefs.

It is often assumed that the players have some statistical information about the other players. E.g., in an auction, each player knows that the valuations of the other players are drawn from some [[probability distribution]]. In this case, the game is called a [[Bayesian game]].

==Complete vs. perfect information==
Complete information is importantly different from [[perfect information]].
In a game of complete information, the structure of the game and the payoff functions of the players are commonly known but players may not see all of the moves made by other players (for instance, the initial placement of ships in [[Battleship (game)|Battleship]]); there may also be a chance element (as in most card games). Conversely, in games of [[perfect information]], every player observes other players' moves, but may lack some information on others' payoffs, or on the structure of the game.&lt;ref name="OsbRub94-Chap6"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Course in Game Theory|last2=Rubinstein|first2=A.|publisher=The MIT Press|year=1994|isbn=0-262-65040-1|location=Cambridge M.A.|chapter=Chapter 6: Extensive Games with Perfect Information|last1=Osborne|first1=M. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A game with complete information may or may not have perfect information, and vice versa.

* Examples of games with '''imperfect''' but '''complete''' information are card games, where each player's cards are hidden from other players but objectives are known, as in [[contract bridge]] and [[poker]].&lt;ref name="thomas"&gt;{{cite book|title=Games, Theory and Applications|last=Thomas|first=L. C.|publisher=Dover Publications|year=2003|isbn=0-486-43237-8|location=Mineola N.Y.|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OsbRub94-Chap11"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Course in Game Theory|last2=Rubinstein|first2=A.|publisher=The MIT Press|year=1994|isbn=0-262-65040-1|location=Cambridge M.A.|chapter=Chapter 11: Extensive Games with Imperfect Information|last1=Osborne|first1=M. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter claim assumes that all players are [[Risk neutral|risk-neutral]] and thus only maximizing their expected outcome. However, since each individual might respond differently to risk, one cannot generally know the exact form of the objective function the other players are trying to maximize and thus the way they will respond to different situations. Thus, from a purely theoretical perspective, these games should generally be considered as having imperfect and (slightly) incomplete information.{{clarify|text=contradicts previous statement.|date=October 2017}}{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
* Examples of games with '''incomplete''' but '''perfect''' information are conceptually more difficult to imagine. Suppose you are playing a game of chess against an opponent who will be paid some substantial amount of money if a particular event happens (an arrangement of pieces, for instance), but you do not know what the event is. In this case you have perfect information, since you know what each move of the opponent is. However, since you do not know the payoff function of the other player (which will affect its behavior even if it does not alter your own victory conditions), it is a game of incomplete information.{{Dubious |Perfect vs complete information|date=October 2017}}{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Games of incomplete information can be converted into games of complete but imperfect information under the "[[common prior assumption]]."  This assumption is commonly made for pragmatic reasons, but its justification remains controversial among economists.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

{{more citations needed|date=September 2012}}'''Complexity theory and organizations''', also called '''complexity strategy''' or '''complex adaptive organizations''', is the use of the study of [[Complex systems|complexity systems]] in the field of [[strategic management]] and [[organizational studies]].

Complexity theory is an interdisciplinary theory that grew out of [[systems theory]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Grobman, Gary M 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Grobman, Gary M.|title=Complexity Theory: a new way to look at organizational change|journal=Public Administration Quarterly|year=2005|url=http://www.complexityforum.com/members/Grobman%202005%20Complexity%20theory.pdf|volume=29|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|350}} It draws from research in the natural sciences that examines uncertainty and non-linearity.&lt;ref name="Grobman, Gary M 2005"/&gt; Complexity theory emphasizes interactions and the accompanying [[feedback]] loops that constantly change systems. While it proposes that systems are unpredictable, they are also constrained by order-generating rules.&lt;ref name="Burnes, Bernard 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Burnes, Bernard|title=Complexity theories and organizational change|journal=International Journal of Management Reviews|volume=7|issue=2|year=2005|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2370.2005.00107.x|pages=73–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|74}}

Complexity theory has been used in the fields of [[strategic management]] and [[organizational studies]].  Application areas include understanding how [[organizations]] or firms [[:wikt:adapt|adapt]] to their environments and how they cope with conditions of uncertainty.  Organisations have complex structures in that they are [[dynamic network analysis|dynamic network]]s of interactions, and their relationships are not aggregations of the individual static entities. They are adaptive; in that the individual and [[collective behavior]] mutate and [[self-organizing|self-organize]] corresponding to a change-initiating micro-event or collection of events.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-T-02" /&gt;

== Key concepts ==

=== Complex adaptive systems ===
Organizations can be treated as [[complex adaptive systems]] (CAS) as they exhibit fundamental CAS principles like self-organization, [[complexity]], [[emergence]],&lt;ref name="CAS-T-13" /&gt; interdependence, space of possibilities, co-evolution, [[Chaos theory|chaos]], and [[self-similarity]].&lt;ref name="CAS-T-01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-T-03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="terra"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Terra|first1=Leonardo Augusto Amaral|last2=Passador|first2=João Luiz|title=Symbiotic Dynamic: The Strategic Problem from the Perspective of Complexity|journal=Systems Research and Behavioral Science|date=2016|volume=33|issue=2|page=235|doi=10.1002/sres.2379|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sres.2379/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAS are contrasted with ordered and [[chaotic systems]] by the relationship that exists between the system and the agents which act within it.  In an ordered system the level of constraint means that all agent behaviour is limited to the rules of the system. In a chaotic system the agents are unconstrained and susceptible to statistical and other analysis.  In a CAS, the system and the agents co-evolve; the system lightly constrains agent behaviour, but the agents modify the system by their interaction with it. This [[self-organizing]] nature is an important characteristic of CAS; and its ability to learn to adapt, differentiate it from other self organizing systems.&lt;ref name=CAS-T-01/&gt;

== Implications for organizational management ==
CAS approaches to strategy seek to understand the nature of system constraints and agent interaction and generally takes an evolutionary or naturalistic approach to strategy.  Some research integrates [[computer simulation and organizational studies]].

===Complexity theory and knowledge management===
Complexity theory also relates to [[knowledge management]] (KM) and [[organizational learning]] (OL). "Complex systems are, by any other definition, learning organizations."&lt;ref name="CAS-T-28" /&gt; Complexity Theory, KM, and OL are all complimentary and co-dependent.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-28" /&gt; “KM and OL each lack a theory of how cognition happens in human social systems – complexity theory offers this missing piece”.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-28" /&gt;

=== Complexity theory and project management ===
Complexity theory is also being used to better understand new ways of doing [[project management]], as traditional models have been found lacking to current challenges.&lt;ref name="Saynisch 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Saynisch, Manfred|title=Beyond frontiers of traditional project management: An approach to evolutionary, self-organizational principles and the complexity theory—results of the research program|journal=Project Management Journal|volume=41|issue=2|year=2010|pages=21–37|doi=10.1002/pmj.20159}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}} This approaches advocates forming a "culture of trust" that "welcomes outsiders, embraces new ideas, and promotes cooperation."&lt;ref name="Saynisch 2010"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

=== Recommendations for managers ===
Complexity Theory implies approaches that focus on flatter, more flexible organizations, rather than top-down, command-and-control styles of management.&lt;ref name="Burnes, Bernard 2005"/&gt;{{rp|84}}

==Additional examples ==
A typical example for an organization behaving as CAS, is Wikipedia&lt;ref name="CAS-T-11" /&gt; – collaborated and managed by a loosely organized management structure,&lt;ref name="CAS-T-11" /&gt; composed of a complex mix of [[human–computer interaction]]s.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-T-17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-T-18" /&gt; By managing behavior, and not only mere content, Wikipedia uses simple rules to produce a complex, evolving knowledge base which has largely replaced older sources in popular use.

Other examples include the complex [[Macroeconomics|global macroeconomic network]] within a country or group of countries&lt;!--much more complex than mere macroeconomic, any help in redirecting to a better page would be welcomed---&gt;; [[stock market]] and complex web of [[Cross-border_cooperation|cross-border]] [[holding companies]]; [[manufacturing|manufacturing business]]es&lt;!--much more complex than mere manufacturing, any help in rewording would be welcomed---&gt;; and any human social group-based endeavour in a particular [[ideology]] and [[social system]] such as [[political party|political parties]], [[community|communities]], [[geopolitical]] [[organisations]], and [[terrorist network analysis|terrorist networks]] of both hierarchical and [[leaderless resistance|leaderless]] nature.&lt;ref name="GT-33" /&gt;  This new macro level state may create difficulty for an observer in explaining and describing the collective behaviour in terms of its constituent parts; as a result of the complex dynamic networks of interactions, outlined earlier.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-01" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2733">In [[probability theory]], a '''continuity correction''' is an adjustment that is made when a discrete [[Probability distribution|distribution]] is approximated by a continuous distribution.

==Examples==

===Binomial===

If a [[random variable]] ''X'' has a [[binomial distribution]] with parameters ''n'' and ''p'', i.e., ''X'' is distributed as the number of "successes" in ''n'' independent [[Bernoulli trial]]s with probability ''p'' of success on each trial, then

:&lt;math&gt;P(X\leq x) = P(X&lt;x+1)&lt;/math&gt;

for any ''x'' ∈ {0, 1, 2, ... ''n''}.  If ''np'' and ''np''(1 &amp;minus; ''p'') are large (sometimes taken to mean ≥ 5), then the probability above is fairly well approximated by

:&lt;math&gt;P(Y\leq x+1/2)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Y'' is a [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] random variable with the same [[expected value]] and the same [[variance]] as ''X'', i.e., E(''Y'') = ''np'' and var(''Y'') = ''np''(1 &amp;minus; ''p'').  This addition of 1/2 to ''x'' is a continuity correction. 

===Poisson===

A continuity correction can also be applied when other discrete distributions supported on the integers are approximated by the normal distribution.  For example, if ''X'' has a [[Poisson distribution]] with expected value λ then the variance of ''X'' is also λ, and

:&lt;math&gt;P(X\leq x)=P(X&lt;x+1)\approx P(Y\leq x+1/2)&lt;/math&gt;

if ''Y'' is normally distributed with expectation and variance both λ.

==Applications==
Before the ready availability of [[statistical software]] having the ability to evaluate probability distribution functions accurately, continuity corrections played an important role in the practical application of [[statistical hypothesis test|statistical tests]] in which the test statistic has a discrete distribution: it had a special importance for manual calculations. A particular example of this is the [[binomial test]], involving the [[binomial distribution]], as in [[checking whether a coin is fair]]. Where extreme accuracy is not necessary, computer calculations for some ranges of parameters may still rely on using continuity corrections to improve accuracy while retaining simplicity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8564">In [[differential geometry]], one can attach to every point ''x'' of a [[smooth manifold|smooth (or differentiable) manifold]] a [[vector space]] called the '''cotangent space''' at ''x''. Typically, the cotangent space is defined as the [[dual space]] of the [[tangent space]] at ''x'', although there are more direct definitions (see below). The elements of the cotangent space are called '''cotangent vectors''' or '''tangent covectors'''.

==Properties==
All cotangent spaces on a connected manifold have the same [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]], equal to the dimension of the manifold. All the cotangent spaces of a manifold can be "glued together" (i.e. unioned and endowed with a topology) to form a new differentiable manifold of twice the dimension, the [[cotangent bundle]] of the manifold.

The tangent space and the cotangent space at a point are both real vector spaces of the same dimension and therefore [[isomorphic]] to each other via many possible isomorphisms. The introduction of a [[Riemannian metric]] or a [[symplectic form]] gives rise to a [[natural isomorphism]] between the tangent space and the cotangent space at a point, associating to any tangent covector a canonical tangent vector.

==Formal definitions==

===Definition as linear functionals===

Let ''M'' be a smooth manifold and let ''x'' be a point in ''M''. Let ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' be the [[tangent space]] at ''x''. Then the cotangent space at ''x'' is defined as the [[dual space]] of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'':
:''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' = (''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
Concretely, elements of the cotangent space are [[linear functional]]s on ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''. That is, every element α ∈ ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' is a [[linear map]]
:&amp;alpha; : ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' &amp;rarr; '''F'''
where '''F''' is the underlying [[field (mathematics)|field]] of the vector space being considered. For example, the field of [[real number]]s. The elements of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' are called cotangent vectors.

===Alternative definition===

In some cases, one might like to have a direct definition of the cotangent space without reference to the tangent space. Such a definition can be formulated in terms of [[equivalence class]]es of smooth functions on ''M''. Informally, we will say that two smooth functions ''f'' and ''g'' are equivalent at a point ''x'' if they have the same first-order behavior near ''x'', analogous to their linear Taylor polynomials; two functions ''f'' and ''g'' have the same first order behaviour near ''x'' if and only if the derivative of the function ''f''-''g'' vanishes at ''x''. The cotangent space will then consist of all the possible first-order behaviors of a function near ''x''.

Let ''M'' be a smooth manifold and let ''x'' be a point in ''M''. Let ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; be the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of all functions in C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') vanishing at ''x'', and let ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; be the set of functions of the form &lt;math&gt;\sum_i f_i g_i\,&lt;/math&gt;, where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. Then ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are real vector spaces and the cotangent space is defined as the [[Quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' = ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

This formulation is analogous to the construction of the cotangent space to define the [[Zariski tangent space]] in algebraic geometry. The construction also generalizes to [[locally ringed space]]s.

==The differential of a function==

Let ''M'' be a smooth manifold and let ''f'' ∈ C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') be a [[smooth function]]. The differential of ''f'' at a point ''x'' is the map
:d''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''f'')
where ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[Differential geometry of curves|tangent vector]] at ''x'', thought of as a derivation. That is &lt;math&gt;X(f)=\mathcal{L}_Xf&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lie derivative]] of ''f'' in the direction ''X'', and one has d''f''(''X'')=''X''(''f'').  Equivalently, we can think of tangent vectors as tangents to curves, and write
:d''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;gamma;&amp;prime;(0)) = (''f'' o &amp;gamma;)&amp;prime;(0)
In either case, d''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is a linear map on ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' and hence it is a tangent covector at ''x''.

We can then define the differential map d : C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') → ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' at a point ''x'' as the map which sends ''f'' to d''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. Properties of the differential map include:

# d is a linear map: d(''af'' + ''bg'') = ''a'' d''f'' + ''b'' d''g'' for constants ''a'' and ''b'',
# d(''fg'')&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''(''x'')d''g''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''g''(''x'')d''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;,

The differential map provides the link between the two alternate definitions of the cotangent space given above. Given a function ''f'' ∈ ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; (a smooth function vanishing at ''x'') we can form the linear functional d''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; as above. Since the map d restricts to 0 on ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (the reader should verify this), d descends to a map from ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to the dual of the tangent space, (''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. One can show that this map is an isomorphism, establishing the equivalence of the two definitions.

==The pullback of a smooth map==

Just as every differentiable map ''f'' : ''M'' → ''N'' between manifolds induces a linear map (called the ''pushforward'' or ''derivative'') between the tangent spaces
:&lt;math&gt;f_{*}^{}\colon T_x M \to T_{f(x)} N&lt;/math&gt;
every such map induces a linear map (called the ''[[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]]'') between the cotangent spaces, only this time in the reverse direction:
:&lt;math&gt;f^{*}\colon T_{f(x)}^{*} N \to T_{x}^{*} M&lt;/math&gt;
The pullback is naturally defined as the dual (or transpose) of the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]]. Unraveling the definition, this means the following:
:&lt;math&gt;(f^{*}\theta)(X_x) = \theta(f_{*}^{}X_x)&lt;/math&gt;
where θ ∈ ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''f''(''x'')&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''N'' and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''. Note carefully where everything lives.

If we define tangent covectors in terms of equivalence classes of smooth maps vanishing at a point then the definition of the pullback is even more straightforward. Let ''g'' be a smooth function on ''N'' vanishing at ''f''(''x''). Then the pullback of the covector determined by ''g'' (denoted d''g'') is given by
:&lt;math&gt;f^{*}\mathrm dg = \mathrm d(g \circ f).&lt;/math&gt;
That is, it is the equivalence class of functions on ''M'' vanishing at ''x'' determined by ''g'' o ''f''.

==Exterior powers==

The ''k''-th [[exterior power]] of the cotangent space, denoted Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M''), is another important object in differential geometry. Vectors in the ''k''th exterior power, or more precisely sections of the ''k''-th exterior power of the [[cotangent bundle]], are called [[differential form|differential ''k''-forms]]. They can be thought of as alternating, [[multilinear map]]s on ''k'' tangent vectors. 
For this reason, tangent covectors are frequently called ''[[one-form]]s''.

'''David Raymond Curtiss''' (January 12, 1878 – April 29, 1953) was an American [[mathematician]]. He served as president of the [[Mathematical Association of America]] from 1935 to 1936. He was also vice president of the [[American Mathematical Society]] and the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].&lt;ref name="Moulton"&gt;Moulton E. J. (1953). Obituary: David Raymond Curtiss. ''[[The American Mathematical Monthly]]'', Vol. 60, No. 8, pp. 566–569.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Curtiss was born in [[Derby, Connecticut]]. He attended the [[University of California]], earning a bachelor's degree in 1899 and a master's degree in 1901. He earned a doctorate at [[Harvard University]] under [[Maxime Bôcher]] and [[William Fogg Osgood]] in 1903. He completed a postdoctoral fellowship at [[École Normale Supérieure]] in 1904.

In 1904, Curtiss taught at [[Yale University]] for one year. He then served as a professor at [[Northwestern University]] from 1905 to 1943, including 20 years as Chair of the Mathematics Department. Curtiss authored [[textbook]]s on [[trigonometry]] and [[analytic geometry]] with [[Elton James Moulton]]. He also published the second [[Carus Mathematical Monograph]], ''Analytic Functions of a Complex Variable.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rasor, S.

In [[topology]], the '''Denjoy–Riesz theorem''' describes a class of sets of points in the Euclidean plane that can be covered by a continuous image of the [[unit interval]], without self-intersections (a [[Jordan curve theorem|Jordan arc]]). A topological space is [[Zero-dimensional space|zero-dimensional]] according to the [[Lebesgue covering dimension]] if every finite [[open cover]] has a refinement that is also an open cover by disjoint sets. A topological space is [[Totally disconnected space|totally disconnected]] if it has no nontrivial connected subsets; for points in the plane, being totally disconnected is equivalent to being zero-dimensional. The Denjoy–Riesz theorem states that every compact totally disconnected subset of the plane is a subset of a Jordan arc.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Zoretti, which used a more general class of sets than Jordan arcs, but Zoretti found a flaw in Riesz's proof: it incorrectly presumed that one-dimensional projections of totally disconnected sets remained totally disconnected. Then, Denjoy (citing neither Zoretti nor Riesz) claimed a proof of Riesz's theorem, with little detail. Moore and Kline state and prove a generalization that completely characterizes the subsets of the plane that can be subsets of Jordan arcs, and that includes the Denjoy–Riesz theorem as a special case.

By applying this theorem to a two-dimensional version of the [[Smith–Volterra–Cantor set]], it is possible to find an [[Osgood curve]], a Jordan arc or closed Jordan curve whose [[Lebesgue measure]] is positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

A related result is the [[analyst's traveling salesman theorem]], describing the point sets that form subsets of curves of finite [[arc length]]. Not every compact totally disconnected set has this property, because some compact totally disconnected sets require any arc that covers them to have infinite length.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3233">In the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), a '''Dependency''' is a relationship that shows that an [[Element (UML)|element]], or set of elements, requires other model elements for their specification or implementation.&lt;ref name="OMG2"&gt;OMG Unified Modeling Language, Superstructure, Version 2.4.1&lt;/ref&gt; The element is ''dependent'' upon the independent element, called the supplier. Two or more elements in this relationship are called [[tuple]]s.

In the UML, this is indicated by a dashed line pointing from the dependent (or client) to the independent (or [[Distributor (business)|supplier]]) element. The arrow representing a Dependency specifies the direction of a relationship, not the direction of a process.

==Standard predefined dependencies==
[[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] - defined dependencies include {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}:
* «call2»          UML2: The client (an operation) may call the supplier (an operation)
* «create»        UML2: The client (a classifier) may create instances of the supplier (a classifier)
* «derive»        UML2: The client (e.g., attribute value, link) may be computed from the supplier(s)
* «instantiate»   UML2: Operations of the client (a classifier) may create instances of the supplier (a classifier)
* «permit»        UML2: Obsolete
* «realize»       UML2: Obsolete
* «refine»        UML2: The client element(s) are at a "later" semantic level than the supplier(s)
* «send»          UML2: The client (an operation) sends the supplier (a signal)
* «substitute»    UML2: The client element can replace (under some circumstances) the supplier
* «trace»         UML2: The client elements "trace" to the suppliers. Typically used for levels of requirements
* «use»           UML2: The client element somehow "uses" the supplier

==Differences with UML link==
A UML link is run-time relationship between instances of classifiers, while a dependency is a model-time relationship between definitions. 

A typical uni-directional link requires the one instance to know about, and thus depend, upon the other, but this is not required. A uni-directional link only requires the possibility of navigation not dependency. 

Likewise, a bi-directional link requires that both instances may traverse to each other, but this also does not require dependency.

However, after the traversal of the association, if some property of the target instance's definition is accessed, such as an operation or attribute, a dependency is created.

In the study of [[metric spaces]] in [[mathematics]], there are various notions of two [[metric (mathematics)|metrics]] on the same underlying space being "the same", or '''equivalent'''.

In the following, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; will denote a non-[[empty set]] and &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt; will denote two metrics on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

==Topological equivalence==
The two metrics &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt; are said to be '''topologically equivalent''' if they generate the same [[topology]] on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The adjective "topological" is often dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop and Goldberg, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple ways of expressing this condition:
* a subset &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt;-[[open set|open]] [[if and only if]] it is &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt;-open;
* the [[open ball]]s "nest": for any point &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; and any radius &lt;math&gt;r &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, there exist radii &lt;math&gt;r', r'' &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that
:: &lt;math&gt;B_{r'} (x; d_1) \subseteq B_r (x; d_2) \text{ and } B_{r''} (x; d_2) \subseteq B_r (x; d_1).&lt;/math&gt;
* the [[identity function]] &lt;math&gt;I : X \to X&lt;/math&gt; is both &lt;math&gt;(d_1, d_2)&lt;/math&gt;-[[continuous function|continuous]] and &lt;math&gt;(d_2, d_1)&lt;/math&gt;-continuous.

The following are sufficient but not necessary conditions for topological equivalence:
* there exists a strictly increasing, continuous, and [[subadditive]] &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}_{+} \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d_2 = f \circ d_1 &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Ok, p. 127, footnote 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
* for each &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, there exist positive constants &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; such that, for every point &lt;math&gt;y \in X&lt;/math&gt;,
:: &lt;math&gt;\alpha d_1 (x, y) \leq d_2 (x, y) \leq \beta d_1 (x, y).&lt;/math&gt;

==Strong equivalence==
Two metrics &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt; are '''strongly equivalent''' if and only if there exist positive constants &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; such that, for every &lt;math&gt;x,y\in X&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha d_1(x,y) \leq d_2(x,y) \leq \beta d_1 (x, y).&lt;/math&gt;
In contrast to the sufficient condition for topological equivalence listed above, strong equivalence requires that there is a single set of constants that holds for every pair of points in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, rather than potentially different constants associated with each point of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

Strong equivalence of two metrics implies topological equivalence, but not vice versa. An intuitive reason why topological equivalence does not imply strong equivalence is that [[Bounded set#Metric space|bounded sets]] under one metric are also bounded under a strongly equivalent metric, but not necessarily under a topologically equivalent metric.

When the two metrics &lt;math&gt;d_1,d_2&lt;/math&gt; are those induced by norms &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot \|_A, \|\cdot\|_B&lt;/math&gt; respectively, then strong equivalence is equivalent to the condition that, for all &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha\|x\|_A \leq \|x\|_B \leq \beta\|x\|_A&lt;/math&gt;

In finite dimensional spaces, all metrics induced by the [[p-norm]], including the [[euclidean metric]], the [[taxicab metric]], and the [[Chebyshev distance]], are strongly equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;Ok, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if two metrics are strongly equivalent, not all properties of the respective metric spaces are preserved. For instance, a function from the space to itself might be a [[contraction mapping]] under one metric, but not necessarily under a strongly equivalent one.&lt;ref&gt;Ok, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties preserved by equivalence==
* The [[continuous function|continuity]] of a function is preserved if either the domain or range is remetrized by an equivalent metric, but [[uniform continuity]] is preserved only by strongly equivalent metrics.&lt;ref&gt;Ok, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[differentiability]] of a function &lt;math&gt;f:U\to V&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; a normed space and &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; a subset of a normed space, is preserved if either the domain or range is renormed by a strongly equivalent norm.&lt;ref&gt;Cartan, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A metric that is strongly equivalent to a [[complete metric]] is also complete; the same is not true of equivalent metrics because homeomorphisms do not preserve completeness. For example, since &lt;math&gt;(0,1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; are homeomorphic, the homeomorphism induces a metric on &lt;math&gt;(0,1)&lt;/math&gt; which is complete because &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is, and generates the same topology as the usual one, yet &lt;math&gt;(0,1)&lt;/math&gt; with the usual metric is not complete, because the sequence &lt;math&gt;(2^{-n})_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; is Cauchy but not convergent. (It is not Cauchy in the induced metric.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8957">The '''Erdős–Gallai theorem''' is a result in [[graph theory]], a branch of [[combinatorics|combinatorial mathematics]]. It provides one of two known approaches to solving the [[graph realization problem]], i.e. it gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a [[finite sequence]] of [[natural number]]s to be the [[Degree (graph theory)#Degree sequence|degree sequence]] of a [[simple graph]]. A sequence obeying these conditions is called "graphic". The theorem was published in 1960 by [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Tibor Gallai]], after whom it is named.

==Theorem statement==
A sequence of non-negative [[integer]]s &lt;math&gt;d_1\geq\cdots\geq d_n&lt;/math&gt; can be represented as the degree sequence of a finite [[simple graph]] on ''n'' vertices if and only if &lt;math&gt;d_1+\cdots+d_n&lt;/math&gt; is even and

: &lt;math&gt;
\sum^{k}_{i=1}d_i\leq k(k-1)+ \sum^n_{i=k+1} \min(d_i,k)
&lt;/math&gt;

holds for every k in &lt;math&gt;1\leq k\leq n&lt;/math&gt;.

==Proofs==
It is not difficult to show that the conditions of the Erdős–Gallai theorem are necessary for a sequence of numbers to be graphic. The requirement that the sum of the degrees be even is the [[handshaking lemma]], already used by Euler in his 1736 paper on the [[bridges of Königsberg]]. The inequality between the sum of the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; largest degrees and the sum of the remaining degrees can be established by [[double counting (proof technique)|double counting]]: the left side gives the numbers of edge-vertex adjacencies among the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; highest-degree vertices, each such adjacency must either be on an edge with one or two high-degree endpoints, the &lt;math&gt;k(k-1)&lt;/math&gt; term on the right gives the maximum possible number of edge-vertex adjacencies in which both endpoints have high degree, and the remaining term on the right upper bounds the number of edges that have exactly one high degree endpoint. Thus, the more difficult part of the proof is to show that, for any sequence of numbers obeying these conditions, there exists a graph for which it is the degree sequence.

The original proof of {{harvtxt|Erdős|Gallai|1960}} was long and involved. {{harvtxt|Choudum|1986}} cites a shorter proof by [[Claude Berge]], based on ideas of [[flow network|network flow]]. Choudum instead provides a proof by [[mathematical induction]] on the sum of the degrees: he lets &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; be the first index of a number in the sequence for which &lt;math&gt;d_t &gt; d_{t+1}&lt;/math&gt; (or the penultimate number if all are equal), uses a case analysis to show that the sequence formed by subtracting one from &lt;math&gt;d_t&lt;/math&gt; and from the last number in the sequence (and removing the last number if this subtraction causes it to become zero) is again graphic, and forms a graph representing the original sequence by adding an edge between the two positions from which one was subtracted.

{{harvtxt|Tripathi|Venugopalan|West|2010}} consider a sequence of "subrealizations", graphs whose degrees are upper bounded by the given degree sequence. They show that, if ''G'' is a subrealization, and ''i'' is the smallest index of a vertex in ''G'' whose degree is not equal to ''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', then ''G'' may be modified in a way that produces another subrealization, increasing the degree of vertex ''i'' without changing the degrees of the earlier vertices in the sequence. Repeated steps of this kind must eventually reach a realization of the given sequence, proving the theorem.

==Relation to integer partitions==
{{harvtxt|Aigner|Triesch|1994}} describe close connections between the Erdős–Gallai theorem and the theory of [[Partition (number theory)|integer partitions]].
Let &lt;math&gt;m=\sum d_i&lt;/math&gt;; then the sorted integer sequences summing to &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; may be interpreted as the partitions of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. Under [[majorization]] of their [[prefix sum]]s, the partitions form a [[Lattice (order)|lattice]], in which the minimal change between an individual partition and another partition lower in the partition order is to subtract one from one of the numbers &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; and add it to a number &lt;math&gt;d_{j}&lt;/math&gt; that is smaller by at least two (&lt;math&gt;d_{j}&lt;/math&gt; could be zero). As Aigner and Triesch show, this operation preserves the property of being graphic, so to prove the Erdős–Gallai theorem it suffices to characterize the graphic sequences that are maximal in this majorization order. They provide such a characterization, in terms of the [[Ferrers diagram]]s of the corresponding partitions, and show that it is equivalent to the Erdős–Gallai theorem.

==Graphic sequences for other types of graphs==
Similar theorems describe the degree sequences of simple directed graphs, simple directed graphs with loops, and simple bipartite graphs {{harv|Berger|2012}}. The first problem is characterized by the [[Fulkerson–Chen–Anstee theorem]]. The latter two cases, which are equivalent, are characterized by the [[Gale–Ryser theorem]].

==Stronger version==
{{harvtxt|Tripathi|Vijay|2003}} proved that it suffices to consider the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;th inequality such that &lt;math&gt;1 \leq k &lt; n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a_k &gt; a_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; and for &lt;math&gt;k = n&lt;/math&gt;. {{harvtxt|Barrus|Hartke|Jao|West|2012}} restrict the set of inequalities for graphs in an opposite thrust. If an even-summed positive sequence d has no repeated entries other than the maximum and the minimum (and the length exceeds
the largest entry), then it suffices to check only the &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;th inequality, where &lt;math&gt;l = \max\{k \mid d_k \geq k\}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Generalization==
A finite sequences of nonnegative [[integer]]s &lt;math&gt;(d_1,\cdots,d_n)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;d_1 \geq \cdots \geq d_n&lt;/math&gt; is graphic if &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{n}d_i&lt;/math&gt; is even and there exists a sequence &lt;math&gt;(c_1,\cdots,c_n)&lt;/math&gt; that is graphic and [[Majorization|majorizes]] &lt;math&gt;(d_1,\cdots,d_n)&lt;/math&gt;. This result was given by {{harvtxt|Aigner|Triesch|1994}}. {{harvtxt|Mahadev|Peled|1995}} reinvented it and gave a more direct proof.

The term '''fractal expressionism''' was coined by physicist-artist Richard Taylor and co-authors to distinguish fractal art generated directly by artists from fractal art generated using mathematics and/or computers.&lt;ref&gt;R.P.Taylor, A.P. Micolich and D. Jonas, Fractal Expressionism, Physics World, 25, October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Fractals are patterns that repeat at increasingly fine scales and are prevalent in natural scenery (examples include clouds, rivers, and mountains).&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbrot, BB, The Fractal Geometry of Nature, WH Freedman, New York, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Fractal expressionism implies a direct expression of nature's patterns in an art work.

== Jackson Pollock's poured paintings ==

The initial studies of fractal expressionism focused on the poured paintings by the American artist [[Jackson Pollock]] (1912-1956), whose work has traditionally been associated with the [[Abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist movement]].&lt;ref name="taylor1999nature"&gt;[Taylor, Richard P., Adam P. Micolich, and David Jonas. "Fractal Analysis of Pollock's Drip Paintings." Nature 399.6735 (1999): 422. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taylor1999physicsworld"&gt;["Fractals Determine Date of Paintings." Physics World 04 June 1999: n. pag. Web. &lt;http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/1999/jun/04/fractals-determine-date-of-paintings&gt;.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Richard P., Adam P. Micolich, and David Jonas. "Fractal Analysis of Pollock's Drip Paintings." Nature 399.6735 (1999): 422. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Pollock’s patterns had previously been referred to as “natural” and “organic”, inviting speculation by author John Briggs in 1992 that Pollock's work featured fractals.&lt;ref&gt;John Briggs, Fractals, Touchstone Publishers, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Taylor built a pendulum device called the Pollockizer which painted fractal patterns bearing a similarity to Pollock’s work.&lt;ref&gt;R.P.Taylor, A.P. Micolich and D. Jonas, Fractal Expressionism, Physics World, 25, October 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Computer analysis of Pollock's work published by Taylor et al.  in a 1999 Nature article found that Pollock's painted patterns have characteristics that match those displayed by nature's fractals (specifically, they demonstrate a statistical [[self-similarity]] quantified by a non-integer dimension over a magnification range of 1.5-2 orders of magnitude).  This analysis supported clues (see below) that Pollock's patterns are fractal and reflect "the fingerprint of nature".&lt;ref name="taylor1999nature" /&gt;

Taylor noted several similarities between Pollock's painting style and the processes used by nature to construct its landscapes.  For instance, he cites Pollock's propensity to revisit paintings that he had not adjusted in several weeks as being comparable to cyclic processes in nature, such as the seasons or the tides.&lt;ref name="artbook"&gt;[Taylor, Richard. "Fractal Expressionism—Where Art Meets Science." Art and Complexity. Ed. John Casti and Anders Karlqvist. 1st ed. Greenwich: JAI, 2003. 117-44. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Taylor observed several visual similarities between the patterns produced by nature and those produced by Pollock as he painted.  He points out that Pollock abandoned the use of a traditional frame for his paintings, preferring instead to roll out his canvas on the floor; this, Taylor asserts, is more compatible with how nature works than traditional painting techniques because the patterns in nature's scenery are not artificially bounded.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt;

The perceived similarities between the processes and patterns involved in Pollock's paintings and those of nature compelled Taylor to posit that the same "basic trademark" of nature's pattern construction also appears in Pollock's work.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt;  Since some natural fractals are generated by a process known as "chaos",&lt;ref name="chaosbook"&gt;[Cvitanovic´, Predrag, Roberto Artuso, Ronnie Mainieri, and Gábor Vattay. Chaos: Classical and Quantum. Copenhagen: Niels Bohr Institute, 2016. ChaosBook.org. Web.]&lt;/ref&gt; including fractals in human physiology,&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Bassingthwaighte et al, Fractal Physiology, Oxford University press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor believed that Pollock's painting process might also have been chaotic, and could therefore leave behind a fractal pattern.  Taylor's hypothesis seems to be reflected in Pollock's statement "I am nature", which he made when asked if nature was a source of inspiration for his work.&lt;ref name="krasner"&gt;Krasner, Lee. "Lee Krasner Oral History." Interview by Dorothy Seckler. Archives of American Art. Smithsonian, 19 May 2005. Web. 30 Dec. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, Pollock is also quoted as stating "No chaos, damn it",  in response to a Time magazine article that referred to his paintings as "chaotic".&lt;ref name="nochaos"&gt;[Karmel, Pepe, ed. Jackson Pollock: Key Interviews, Articles and Reviews. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2000. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;   However, chaos theory was not understood until after Pollock's death, so he could not have been referring to the chaotic systems in nature but rather its common usage to mean disorder. In the famous film footage of [[Hans Namuth]],&lt;ref name="[https://www.sfmoma.org/watch/jackson-pollock-paintings-have-a-life-of-their-own/ sfmoma]"&gt;[Jackson Pollock: Paintings Have a Life of Their Own. Perf. Jackson Pollock. SFMOMA. SFMOMA, n.d. Web. &lt;https://www.sfmoma.org/watch/jackson-pollock-paintings-have-a-life-of-their-own/&gt;.]&lt;/ref&gt; Pollock says his paintings are no accident, and that he was able to control the flow of paint onto the canvas.

Taylor points to two aspects of Pollock's painting process that have the potential to introduce fractal patterns. The first is Pollock's motion as he moved around the canvas, which Taylor hypothesized followed a Levy flight, a type of chaotic motion that is known to leave behind a fractal pattern.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mandelbrot"&gt;[Mandelbrot, Benoit B. The Fractal Geometry of Nature. San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1982. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;  More specifically, a number of studies have shown that the motions associated with human balance have fractal characteristics. The second source of chaos could be introduced through Pollock's pouring technique.  Falling fluid has the capability of changing from a non-chaotic to a chaotic flow, meaning that Pollock could have introduced a chaotic flow of paint as he dripped it onto the canvas.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt; Although the fractal characteristics of human balance and falling liquid are generated on Pollock's painting time and length scales, physicist [[Predrag Cvitanovic]] notes that it would be quite an artistic challenge to control them: such parameters "are in no sense observable and measurable on the length-scales and time-scales dominated by chaotic dynamics".{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Since Taylor's initial Pollock analysis in 1999, more than ten research groups have used various forms of fractal analysis to successfully quantify Pollock’s work.&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Mureika, C.C. Dyer, G.C. Cupchik, “Multifractal Structure in Nonrepresentational Art”, Physical Review E, vol. 72, 046101-1-15 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="C. Redies, J 2007"&gt;C. Redies, J. Hasenstein and J.

Lee, S 2007"/&gt; Mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot (who invented the term fractal) and art theorist Francis O’Connor (the chief Pollock scholar) are well known advocates of fractal expressionism.&lt;ref name="J. Rehmeyer, 2007"&gt;J. Rehmeyer, “Fractal or Fake?”, ScienceNews, vol. 171, 122-123, (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see o'conner's website&lt;/ref&gt;

== The relationship between fractal expressionism and fractal fluency ==

Fractal expressionism is related to fractal fluency&lt;ref&gt;23 Taylor, RP, and Spehar B, Fractal Fleuncy: An Intimate Relationship Between the Brain and Processing of Fractal Stimuli, In: The Fractal Geometry of the Brain. New York: Springer; 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; because the latter provides an appealing motivation for why artists such as Pollock might aspire to Fractal Expressionism.  Fractal fluency is a neuroscience model that proposes that, through exposure to nature’s fractal scenery, people’s visual systems have adapted to efficiently process fractals with ease. This adaptation occurs at many stages of the visual system, from the way people’s eyes move to which regions of the brain get activated. Fluency puts the viewer in a ‘comfort zone’ so inducing an aesthetic experience. Neuroscience experiments have shown that Pollock’s paintings induce the same positive physiological responses in the observer as nature’s fractals and mathematical fractals.&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor, B. Spehar 2011"&gt;R.P. Taylor, B. Spehar, P. Van Donkelaar and C.M. Hagerhall, “Perceptual and Physiological Responses to Jackson Pollock’s Fractals,” Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, vol. 5 1- 13 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of fractal fluency and the associated aesthetics, other artists might be expected to display fractal expressionism. One year before Taylor’s publication, mathematician Richard Voss quantified Chinese art using fractal analysis.&lt;ref name="R. Voss 1998"&gt;R. Voss, Fractal Image Encoding and Analysis, Springer, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, other groups have used computer analysis to identify fractal content in a number of Western and Eastern artists,&lt;ref name="C. Redies, J 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="D.J. Field, 2008"/&gt; most recently in Pollock’s colleague Willem De Kooning’s work.&lt;ref&gt;A. Forsythe et al, Journal of Neurophysiology, vol. 31, 1, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the above analyzed works, symbolic representations of fractals can be found in cultures across the continents spanning several centuries, including Roman, Egyptian, Aztec, Incan and Mayan civilizations. They frequently predate patterns named after the mathematicians who subsequently developed their visual characteristics. For example, although von Koch is famous for developing The Koch Curve in 1904, a similar shape featuring repeating triangles was first used to depict waves in friezes by Hellenic artists (300 B.C.E.). In the 13th century, repetition of triangles in Cosmati Mosaics generated a shape later known in mathematics as The Sierpinski Triangle (named after Sierpinski’s 1915 pattern). Triangular repetitions are also found in the 12th century pulpit of The Ravello Cathedral in Italy. The lavish artwork within The Book of Kells (circa 800 C.E.) and the sculpted arabesques in The Jain Dilwara Temple in Mount Abu, India (1031 C.E.) also both reveal stunning examples of exact fractals. The artistic works of Leonardo da Vinci and Katsushika Hokusai serve as more recent examples from Europe and Asia, each reproducing the recurring patterns that they saw in nature. Da Vinci’s sketch of turbulence in water, The Deluge (1571–1518), was composed of small swirls within larger swirls of water. In The Great Wave off Kanagawa (1830–1833), Hokusai portrayed a wave crashing on a shore with small waves on top of a large wave. Other woodcuts from the same period also feature repeating patterns at several size scales: The Ghost of Kohada Koheiji shows fissures in a skull and The Falls At Mt. Kurokami features branching channels in a waterfall.

== The use of fractals to authenticate art and the associated controversy ==

Voss's 1998 study of Chinese art was the first demonstration of using fractal analysis to distinguish between the works of different artists.&lt;ref name="R. Voss 1998"/&gt; Following Taylor's 1999 Pollock publication, Art conservator Jim Coddington proposed that fractal analysis should be explored as a technique to help authenticate Pollock paintings. In 2005, Taylor and colleagues published a fractal analysis of 14 authentic and 37 imitation Pollocks suggesting that, when combined with other techniques, fractal analysis might be useful for authenticating Pollock's work.&lt;ref&gt;R.P. Taylor et al, “Authenticating Pollock Paintings Using Fractal Geometry”, Pattern Recognition Letters, vol. 28, 695-702 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year, The Pollock-Krasner Foundation requested a fractal analysis to be used for the first time in an authenticity dispute,&lt;ref&gt;A Abbott, Fractals and art: In the hands of a master, Nature 439, 648-650 (9 February 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis identified “significant deviations from Pollock’s characteristics.” Taylor cautioned that the results should be “coupled with other important information such as provenance, connoisseurship and materials analysis.” Two years later, materials scientists showed that pigments on the paintings dated from after Pollock’s death.
 
In 2006, the use of fractals to authenticate Pollocks stirred controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Jones-Smith et al, “Fractal Analysis: Revisiting Pollock’s Paintings”Nature, Brief Communication Arising, vol. 444, E9-10, (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor 2006"&gt;R.P. Taylor et al, “Fractal Analysis: Revisiting Pollock’s Paintings” Nature, Brief Communication Arising, vol. 444, E10-11, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="J. Rehmeyer, 2007"/&gt; This controversy was triggered by physicists Katherine Jones-Smith and Harsh Mathur who claimed that the fractal characteristics identified by Taylor et al. are also present in crude sketches made in [[Adobe Photoshop]],&lt;ref name="kate2006nature"&gt;[Jones-Smith, Katherine. "Revisiting Pollock's Drip Paintings." Nature 444.7119 (2006): E9-E10. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; and deliberately fraudulent poured paintings made by other artists&lt;ref name="kate2006nature" /&gt;&lt;ref name="physrevE"&gt;[ Jones-Smith, Katherine, Harsh Mathur, and Lawrence M. Krauss. "Drip paintings and fractal analysis." Physical Review E 79.4 (2009): 046111. ]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to Jones-Smith and Mathur, labeling Pollock's paintings as "fractal" is meaningless, because the same characteristics are found in other non-fractal images. However, Taylor's rebuttal published in Nature&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor 2006"/&gt; showed that Taylor's group's fractal analysis could distinguish between Pollock paintings and the crude sketches, and identified further limitations in Jones-Smith and Mathur's analysis.

Jones-Smith and Mathur raised a valid concern applicable to all forms of fractal expressionism: are art works too small for the painted patterns to repeat over sufficient magnifications to assume the visual characteristics of fractals? In the case of Pollock paintings, the largest range used by Taylor et al. to determine each fractal parameter in a Pollock painting is less than two orders of magnitude in magnification. Nature's fractals repeat over limited magnification ranges (typically just over one order of magnitude), prompting scientists to debate what range is required to reliably establish fractal behavior.&lt;ref name="Ave/Man"&gt;[Avnir, David, Ofer Biham, Daniel M. Lidar, and Ofer Malcai. "Is the Geometry of Nature Fractal?" Science 279.5347 (1998): 39-40. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; Mandelbrot refused to include a required magnification range in his definition of fractals and instead noted that it is the range necessary to generate the properties associated with fractal repetition. In the case of Pollock's work, this would be the magnification range necessary for the patterns to generate the fractal aesthetics. Neuroscience experiments have shown that this magnification range is less than two orders and that Pollock’s paintings do indeed induce the same physiological responses as nature’s fractals and mathematical fractals&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor, B. Spehar 2011"/&gt; Mandelbrot concluded "I do believe that Pollocks are fractal."&lt;ref name="J. Rehmeyer, 2007"/&gt;

At the time of the controversy, Coddington summarized as follows: “Fractal geometry has begun to play an important role in the authentication of the work of Jackson Pollock. We believe such analyses are necessary for pushing the field forward.”&lt;ref&gt;(J. Coddington et al, Proceedings SPIE, vol. 6810, 68100F 1-12, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent results, In 2015, by computer scientist Lior Shamir showed that, when combined with other pattern parameters, fractal analysis can be used to distinguish between real and imitation Pollocks with 93% accuracy. He found that the fractal parameters were the most powerful contributors to the detection accuracy&lt;ref&gt;L. Shamar, “What Makes a Pollock Pollock: A Machine Vision Approach”, International Journal of Arts and Technology, vol. 8, 1-10, (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2778">In [[abstract algebra]], the '''[[fundamental theorem]] on homomorphisms''', also known as the '''fundamental homomorphism theorem''', relates the structure of two objects between which a [[homomorphism]] is given, and of the [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] and image of the homomorphism.

The homomorphism theorem is used to prove the [[isomorphism theorem]]s.

== Group theoretic version ==

Given two [[group (mathematics)|group]]s ''G'' and ''H'' and a [[group homomorphism]] ''f'' : ''G''→''H'',  let ''K'' be a [[normal subgroup]] in ''G'' and φ the natural [[surjective]] homomorphism ''G''→''G''/''K'' (where ''G''/''K'' is a [[quotient group]]). If ''K'' is a subset of [[kernel (algebra)|ker]](''f'') then there exists a unique homomorphism ''h'':''G''/''K''→''H'' such that ''f'' = ''h'' φ.

In other words, the natural projection φ is [[Universal property|universal]] among homomorphisms on ''G'' that map ''K'' to the identity element.

The situation is described by the following [[commutative diagram]]:

By setting ''K'' = ker(''f'') we immediately get the [[first isomorphism theorem]].

In [[statistics]], the '''Gauss–Markov theorem''', named after [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Andrey Markov]], states that in a [[linear regression model]] in which the errors have expectation zero, are [[uncorrelated]] and have equal [[variance]]s, the '''best linear [[bias of an estimator|unbiased]] [[estimator]]''' ('''BLUE''') of the coefficients is given by the [[ordinary least squares]] (OLS) estimator, provided it exists.  Here "best" means giving the lowest variance of the estimate, as compared to other unbiased, linear estimators. The errors do not need to be [[normal distribution|normal]], nor do they need to be [[independent and identically distributed]] (only [[uncorrelated]] with mean zero and [[homoscedastic]] with finite variance). The requirement that the estimator be unbiased cannot be dropped, since biased estimators exist with lower variance. See, for example, the [[James–Stein estimator]] (which also drops linearity) or [[ridge regression]].

==Statement==
Suppose we have in matrix notation,
:&lt;math&gt; \underline{y} = X \underline{\beta} + \underline{\varepsilon},\quad (\underline{y},\underline{\varepsilon} \in \mathbb{R}^n, \underline{\beta} \in \mathbb{R}^K \text{ and } X\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times K}) &lt;/math&gt;
expanding to,
:&lt;math&gt; y_i=\sum_{j=1}^{K}\beta_j X_{ij}+\varepsilon_i \quad \forall i=1,2,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\beta_j&lt;/math&gt; are non-random but '''un'''observable parameters, &lt;math&gt;X_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are non-random and observable (called the "explanatory variables"), &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; are random, and so &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; are random. The random variables &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; are called the "disturbance", "noise" or simply "error" (will be contrasted with "residual" later in the article; see [[errors and residuals in statistics]]). Note that to include a constant in the model above, one can choose to introduce the constant as a variable &lt;math&gt;\beta_{K+1}&lt;/math&gt;  with a newly introduced last column of X being unity i.e., &lt;math&gt;X_{i(K+1)} = 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Gauss–Markov''' assumptions concern the set of error random variables, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_i&lt;/math&gt;:

*They have mean zero: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[\varepsilon_i]=0.&lt;/math&gt;
*They are [[homoscedasticity|homoscedastic]], that is all have the same finite variance: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(\varepsilon_i)= \sigma^2 &lt; \infty,&lt;/math&gt; and 
*Distinct error terms are uncorrelated: &lt;math&gt;\text{Cov}(\varepsilon_i,\varepsilon_j) = 0, \forall i \neq j.&lt;/math&gt;

A '''linear estimator''' of &lt;math&gt; \beta_j  &lt;/math&gt; is a linear combination

:&lt;math&gt;\widehat\beta_j = c_{1j}y_1+\cdots+c_{nj}y_n&lt;/math&gt;

in which the coefficients &lt;math&gt; c_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;  are not allowed to depend on the underlying coefficients &lt;math&gt;\beta_j&lt;/math&gt;, since those are not observable, but are allowed to depend on the values &lt;math&gt; X_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;, since these data are observable.  (The dependence of the coefficients on each &lt;math&gt;X_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is typically nonlinear; the estimator is linear in each &lt;math&gt; y_i &lt;/math&gt; and hence in each random &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon,&lt;/math&gt; which is why this is [[linear regression|"linear" regression]].)  The estimator is said to be '''unbiased''' [[if and only if]]

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}\left [\widehat\beta_j \right ]=\beta_j&lt;/math&gt;

regardless of the values of &lt;math&gt; X_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;. Now, let &lt;math&gt;\sum\nolimits_{j=1}^K\lambda_j\beta_j&lt;/math&gt; be some linear combination of the coefficients. Then the '''[[mean squared error]]''' of the corresponding estimation is

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E} \left [\left(\sum_{j=1}^K\lambda_j \left (\widehat\beta_j-\beta_j \right )\right)^2\right ],&lt;/math&gt;

in other words it is the expectation of the square of the weighted sum (across parameters) of the differences between the estimators and the corresponding parameters to be estimated.  (Since we are considering the case in which all the parameter estimates are unbiased, this mean squared error is the same as the variance of the linear combination.) The '''best linear unbiased estimator''' (BLUE) of the vector &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt;  of parameters &lt;math&gt; \beta_j &lt;/math&gt;  is one with the smallest mean squared error for every vector &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt; of linear combination parameters.  This is equivalent to the condition that

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}\left(\widetilde\beta\right)- \operatorname{Var} \left( \widehat \beta \right)&lt;/math&gt;

is a positive semi-definite matrix for every other linear unbiased estimator &lt;math&gt;\widetilde\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''ordinary least squares estimator (OLS)''' is the function

:&lt;math&gt;\widehat\beta=(X'X)^{-1}X'y&lt;/math&gt;

of &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;X'&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[transpose]] of &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;) that minimizes the '''sum of squares of [[errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]]''' (misprediction amounts):

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \left(y_i-\widehat{y}_i\right)^2=\sum_{i=1}^n \left(y_i-\sum_{j=1}^K \widehat\beta_j X_{ij}\right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The theorem now states that the OLS estimator is a BLUE. The main idea of the proof is that the least-squares estimator is uncorrelated with every linear unbiased estimator of zero, i.e., with every linear combination &lt;math&gt;a_1y_1+\cdots+a_ny_n&lt;/math&gt; whose coefficients do not depend upon the unobservable &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; but whose expected value is always zero.

==Proof==
Let &lt;math&gt;\tilde\beta = Cy&lt;/math&gt; be another linear estimator of &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;C = (X'X)^{-1}X' + D &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;K \times n&lt;/math&gt; non-zero matrix. As we're restricting to ''unbiased'' estimators, minimum mean squared error implies minimum variance. The goal is therefore to show that such an estimator has a variance no smaller than that of &lt;math&gt; \widehat\beta,&lt;/math&gt; the OLS estimator. We calculate:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname{E} \left[ \tilde\beta \right] &amp;= \operatorname{E}[Cy] \\
&amp;= \operatorname{E} \left [\left ((X'X)^{-1}X' + D \right )(X\beta + \varepsilon) \right ]\\
&amp;= \left ((X'X)^{-1}X' + D \right )X\beta + \left ((X'X)^{-1}X' + D \right ) \operatorname{E}[\varepsilon] \\
&amp;= \left ((X'X)^{-1}X' + D \right )X\beta  &amp;&amp; \operatorname{E}[\varepsilon] =0 \\
&amp;= (X'X)^{-1}X'X\beta + DX\beta  \\
&amp;= (I_K + DX)\beta. \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt; \tilde\beta &lt;/math&gt; is unbiased if and only if &lt;math&gt; DX = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. Then:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \operatorname{Var}\left(\tilde\beta\right) &amp;=  \operatorname{Var}(Cy) \\
&amp;= C \text{ Var}(y)C' \\
&amp;= \sigma^2 CC' \\
&amp;= \sigma^2 \left ((X'X)^{-1}X' + D \right ) \left (X(X'X)^{-1} + D' \right ) \\
&amp;= \sigma^2 \left ((X'X)^{-1}X'X(X'X)^{-1} + (X'X)^{-1}X'D' + DX(X'X)^{-1} + DD' \right) \\
&amp;= \sigma^2(X'X)^{-1} + \sigma^2(X'X)^{-1} (DX)' + \sigma^2 DX  (X'X)^{-1} + \sigma^2DD' \\
&amp;= \sigma^2(X'X)^{-1}+ \sigma^2DD' &amp;&amp; DX =0 \\
&amp;=  \operatorname{Var}\left(\widehat\beta\right)  + \sigma^2DD'  &amp;&amp; \sigma^2(X'X)^{-1} =   \operatorname{Var}\left(\widehat\beta\right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''DD''' is a positive semidefinite matrix, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}\left( \tilde \beta \right) &lt;/math&gt; exceeds &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}\left(\widehat\beta\right) &lt;/math&gt; by a positive semidefinite matrix.

==Remarks on the proof==
As it has been stated before,  the condition of &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Var} \left( \tilde \beta \right)- \operatorname{Var} \left(\widehat\beta\right)&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to the property that the best linear unbiased estimator of &lt;math&gt; \ell^t\beta &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; \ell^t\widehat\beta &lt;/math&gt; (best in the sense that it has minimum variance). To see this, let &lt;math&gt; \ell^t\tilde\beta &lt;/math&gt; another linear unbiased estimator of &lt;math&gt; \ell^t\beta &lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname{Var}\left(\ell^t\tilde\beta\right) &amp;= \ell^t \operatorname{Var} \left(\tilde\beta\right) \ell \\
&amp;=\sigma^2 \ell^t (X'X)^{-1}\ell+\ell^tDD^t\ell \\
&amp;= \operatorname{Var}\left(\ell^t\widehat\beta\right)+(D^t\ell)^t(D^t\ell) &amp;&amp; \sigma^2 \ell^t (X'X)^{-1}\ell = \operatorname{Var}\left(\ell^t\widehat\beta\right) \\
&amp;= \operatorname{Var}\left(\ell^t\widehat\beta\right) +\|D^t\ell\|\\
&amp; \geqslant \operatorname{Var}\left(\ell^t\widehat\beta\right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, equality holds if and only if &lt;math&gt; D^t\ell=0 &lt;/math&gt;. We calculate

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\ell^t\tilde\beta &amp;= \ell^t \left (((X'X)^{-1}X' + D) Y \right ) &amp;&amp; \text{ from above}\\
&amp;= \ell^t(X'X)^{-1}X'Y + \ell^tDY \\
&amp;= \ell^t\widehat\beta +(D^t\ell)^t Y \\
&amp;=\ell^t\widehat\beta &amp;&amp; D^t\ell = 0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This proves that the equality holds if and only if &lt;math&gt; \ell^t\tilde\beta=\ell^t\widehat\beta &lt;/math&gt; which gives the uniqueness of the OLS estimator as a BLUE.

==Generalized least squares estimator==
The [[generalized least squares]] (GLS), developed by [[Alexander Aitken|Aitken]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. C. |last=Aitken |title=On Least Squares and Linear Combinations of Observations |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh |year=1935 |volume=55 |issue= |pages=42–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt; extends the Gauss–Markov theorem to the case where the error vector has a non-scalar covariance matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David S. |last=Huang |title=Regression and Econometric Methods |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1970 |isbn=0-471-41754-8 |pages=127–147 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5IxRAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA127 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aitken estimator is also a BLUE.

==Gauss–Markov theorem as stated in econometrics==

In most treatments of OLS, the regressors (parameters of interest) in the [[design matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; are assumed to be fixed in repeated samples. This assumption is considered inappropriate for a predominantly nonexperimental science like [[econometrics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Fumio |last=Hayashi |authorlink=Fumio Hayashi |title=Econometrics |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-691-01018-8 |page=13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QyIW8WUIyzcC&amp;pg=PA13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the assumptions of the Gauss–Markov theorem are stated conditional on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Linearity===

The dependent variable is assumed to be a linear function of the variables specified in the model. The specification must be linear in its parameters. This does not mean that there must be a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. The independent variables can take non-linear forms as long as the parameters are linear.  The equation &lt;math&gt; y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x^2, &lt;/math&gt; qualifies as linear while &lt;math&gt; y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}^2 x&lt;/math&gt; can be transformed to be linear by replacing &lt;math&gt;\beta_{1}^2&lt;/math&gt; by another parameter, say &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. An equation with a parameter dependent on an independent variable does not qualify as linear, for example &lt;math&gt;y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}(x) \cdot x&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\beta_{1}(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Data transformation (statistics)|Data transformations]] are often used to convert an equation into a linear form. For example, the [[Cobb–Douglas production function|Cobb–Douglas function]]—often used in economics—is nonlinear:
:&lt;math&gt;Y = A L^\alpha K^{1 - \alpha} e^\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;

But it can be expressed in linear form by taking the [[natural logarithm]] of both sides:{{sfn|Kennedy|2003|p=110}}

: &lt;math&gt;\ln Y=\ln A + \alpha \ln L + (1 - \alpha) \ln K + \varepsilon = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ln L + \beta_2 \ln K + \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

This assumption also covers specification issues: assuming that the proper [[functional form]] has been selected and there are no [[Omitted-variable bias|omitted variables]].

One should be aware, however, that the parameters that minimize the residuals of the transformed equation not necessarily minimize the residuals of the original equation.

===Strict exogeneity===
For all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; observations, the expectation—conditional on the regressors—of the error term is zero:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Fumio |last=Hayashi |authorlink=Fumio Hayashi |title=Econometrics |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-691-01018-8 |page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QyIW8WUIyzcC&amp;pg=PA7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[\,\varepsilon_{i}\mid \mathbf{X} ] = \operatorname{E}[\,\varepsilon_{i}\mid \mathbf{x_{1}}, \dots, \mathbf{x_{n}} ] = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_i = \begin{bmatrix} x_{i1} &amp; x_{i2} &amp; \dots &amp; x_{ik} \end{bmatrix}^{\mathsf{T}}&lt;/math&gt; is the data vector of regressors for the ''i''th observation, and consequently &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{x_{1}^{\mathsf{T}}} &amp; \mathbf{x_{2}^{\mathsf{T}}} &amp; \dots &amp; \mathbf{x_{n}^{\mathsf{T}}} \end{bmatrix}^{\mathsf{T}}&lt;/math&gt; is the data matrix or design matrix.

Geometrically, this assumption implies that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] to each other, so that their [[Dot product|inner product]] (i.e., their cross moment) is zero.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[\,\mathbf{x}_{j} \cdot \varepsilon_{i}\,] = \begin{bmatrix} \operatorname{E}[\,{x}_{j1} \cdot \varepsilon_{i}\,] \\ \operatorname{E}[\,{x}_{j2} \cdot \varepsilon_{i}\,] \\ \vdots \\ \operatorname{E}[\,{x}_{jk} \cdot \varepsilon_{i}\,] \end{bmatrix} = \mathbf{0} \quad \text{for all } i, j \in n&lt;/math&gt;
This assumption is violated if the explanatory variables are stochastic, for instance when they are [[Errors-in-variables models|measured with error]], or are [[Endogeneity (economics)|endogenous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Johnston |authorlink=John Johnston (econometrician) |title=Econometric Methods |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |edition=Second |year=1972 |isbn=0-07-032679-7 |pages=267–291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Endogeneity can be the result of [[simultaneity]], where causality flows back and forth between both the dependent and independent variable. [[Instrumental variable]] techniques are commonly used to address this problem.

===Full rank===
The sample data matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; must have full column [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]].
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rank}(\mathbf{X}) = k&lt;/math&gt;
Otherwise &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X'X}&lt;/math&gt; is not invertible and the OLS estimator cannot be computed.

A violation of this assumption is [[Multicollinearity|perfect multicollinearity]], i.e. some explanatory variables are linearly dependent. One scenario in which this will occur is called "dummy variable trap," when a base dummy variable is not omitted resulting in perfect correlation between the dummy variables and the constant term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeffrey |last=Wooldridge |authorlink=Jeffrey Wooldridge |title=Introductory Econometrics |location= |publisher=South-Western |edition=Fifth international |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-111-53439-4 |page=220 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multicollinearity (as long as it is not "perfect") can be present resulting in a less efficient, but still unbiased estimate. The estimates will be less precise and highly sensitive to particular sets of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Johnston |authorlink=John Johnston (econometrician) |title=Econometric Methods |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |edition=Second |year=1972 |isbn=0-07-032679-7 |pages=159–168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Multicollinearity can be detected from [[condition number]] or the [[variance inflation factor]], among other tests.

===Spherical errors===
The [[outer product]] of the error vector must be spherical.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[\,\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} \boldsymbol{\varepsilon^{\mathsf{T}}} \mid \mathbf{X} ] = \operatorname{Var}[\,\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} \mid \mathbf{X} ] = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma^{2} &amp; 0 &amp; \dots &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \sigma^{2} &amp; \dots &amp; 0 \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \dots &amp; \sigma^{2} \end{bmatrix} = \sigma^{2} \mathbf{I} \quad \text{with } \sigma^{2} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
This implies the error term has uniform variance ([[homoscedasticity]]) and no serial dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Fumio |last=Hayashi |authorlink=Fumio Hayashi |title=Econometrics |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-691-01018-8 |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QyIW8WUIyzcC&amp;pg=PA10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If this assumption is violated, OLS is still unbiased, but inefficient. The term "spherical errors" will describe the multivariate normal distribution: if &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}[\,\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\mid \mathbf{X} ] = \sigma^{2} \mathbf{I}&lt;/math&gt; in the multivariate normal density, then the equation &lt;math&gt;f(x)=c&lt;/math&gt; is the formula for a [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]] centered at μ with radius σ in n-dimensional space.{{sfn|Greene|2012|p=23-note}}

[[Heteroskedasticity]] occurs when the amount of error is correlated with an independent variable. For example, in a regression on food expenditure and income, the error is correlated with income.  Low income people generally spend a similar amount on food, while high income people may spend a very large amount or as little as low income people spend. Heteroskedastic can also be caused by changes in measurement practices. For example, as statistical offices improve their data, measurement error decreases, so the error term declines over time.

This assumption is violated when there is [[autocorrelation]].  Autocorrelation can be visualized on a data plot when a given observation is more likely to lie above a fitted line if adjacent observations also lie above the fitted regression line. Autocorrelation is common in time series data where a data series may experience "inertia."{{sfn|Greene|2010|p=22}} If a dependent variable takes a while to fully absorb a shock. Spatial autocorrelation can also occur geographic areas are likely to have similar errors. Autocorrelation may be the result of misspecification such as choosing the wrong functional form. In these cases, correcting the specification is one possible way to deal with autocorrelation.

In the presence of spherical errors, the generalized least squares estimator can be shown to be BLUE.{{sfn|Kennedy|2003|p=135}}

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[graph theory]], the '''Goldner–Harary graph''' is a simple [[undirected graph]] with 11 vertices and 27 edges. It is named after A. Goldner and [[Frank Harary]], who proved in 1975 that it was the smallest [[Hamiltonian graph|non-Hamiltonian]] [[maximal planar graph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=A.|last1=Goldner|first2=F.|last2=Harary|author2-link=Frank Harary|title=Note on a smallest nonhamiltonian maximal planar graph|journal=Bull. Malaysian Math. Soc.|volume=6|issue=1|year=1975|pages=41–42}}. See also the same journal '''6'''(2):33 (1975) and '''8''':104-106 (1977).

C.|last2=Wilson|first2=R. J.|title=An Atlas of Graphs|location=Oxford, England|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=285|year=1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The same graph had already been given as an example of a non-Hamiltonian [[simplicial polyhedron]] by [[Branko Grünbaum]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="grun"/&gt;

==Properties==
The Goldner–Harary graph is a [[planar graph]]: it can be drawn in the plane with none of its edges crossing. When drawn on a plane, all its faces are triangular, making it a [[maximal planar graph]]. As with every maximal planar graph, it is also [[vertex connectivity|3-vertex-connected]]: the removal of any two of its vertices leaves a connected [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraph]].

The Goldner–Harary graph is also [[hamiltonian graph|non-hamiltonian]]. The smallest possible number of vertices for a non-hamiltonian polyhedral graph is 11. Therefore, the Goldner–Harary graph is a minimal example of graphs of this type. However, the [[Herschel graph]], another non-Hamiltonian polyhedron with 11 vertices, has fewer edges.

As a non-Hamiltonian maximal planar graph, the Goldner–Harary graph provides an example of a planar graph with [[book embedding|book thickness]] greater than two.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Frank R.|last1=Bernhart|first2=Paul C.|last2=Kainen|author2-link=Paul Chester Kainen|title=The book thickness of a graph|journal=Journal of Combinatorial Theory|series=Series B|volume=27|issue=3|pages=320–331|year=1979|doi=10.1016/0095-8956(79)90021-2}}. See in particular Figure 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the existence of such examples, Bernhart and Kainen conjectured that the book thickness of planar graphs could be made arbitrarily large, but it was subsequently shown that all planar graphs have book thickness at most four.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=Four pages are necessary and sufficient for planar graphs|first=Mihalis|last=Yannakakis|authorlink=Mihalis Yannakakis|title=Proc. 18th ACM Symp. Theory of Computing (STOC)|year=1986|pages=104–108|doi=10.1145/12130.12141}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has [[book thickness]] 3, [[chromatic number]] 4, [[chromatic index]] 8, girth 3, radius 2, diameter 2 and is a 3-[[k-edge-connected graph|edge-connected graph]].

It is also a [[k-tree|3-tree]], and therefore it has [[treewidth]] 3. Like any ''k''-tree, it is a [[chordal graph]]. As a planar 3-tree, it forms an example of an [[Apollonian network]].

==Geometry==
By [[Steinitz's theorem]], the Goldner–Harary graph is a [[polyhedral graph]]: it is planar and 3-connected, so there exists a convex polyhedron having the Goldner–Harary graph as its [[skeleton (topology)|skeleton]].

Geometrically, a polyhedron representing the Goldner–Harary graph may be formed by gluing a tetrahedron onto each face of a [[triangular dipyramid]], similarly to the way a [[triakis octahedron]] is formed by gluing a tetrahedron onto each face of an [[octahedron]]. That is, it is the [[Kleetope]] of the triangular dipyramid.&lt;ref name="grun"&gt;{{citation|first=Branko|last=Grünbaum|authorlink=Branko Grünbaum|title=Convex Polytopes|publisher=Wiley Interscience|year=1967|page=357}}.

==Algebraic properties==
The [[Graph automorphism|automorphism group]] of the Goldner–Harary graph is of order 12 and is isomorphic to the [[dihedral group]] D&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, the group of symmetries of a [[regular hexagon]], including both rotations and reflections.

The [[characteristic polynomial]] of the Goldner–Harary graph is : &lt;math&gt;-(x-1)^2 x^2 (x+2)^3 (x^2-3) (x^2-4 x-9)&lt;/math&gt;.

Trans. R. Soc. A 2018, 376 (2118).]]
'''Hilbert's problems''' are twenty-three problems in [[mathematics]] published by German mathematician [[David Hilbert]] in 1900. The problems were all unsolved at the time, and several of them were very influential for 20th-century mathematics. Hilbert presented ten of the problems (1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 13, 16, 19, 21 and 22) at the [[Paris]] conference of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], speaking on August 8 in the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. The complete list of 23 problems was published later, most notably in English translation in 1902 by [[Mary Frances Winston Newson]] in the ''[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David Hilbert, {{cite web | title=Mathematical Problems | url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1902-08-10/home.html}} ''[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]'', vol. 8, no. 10 (1902), pp. 437–479. Earlier publications (in the original German) appeared in ''Göttinger Nachrichten'', 1900, pp. 253–297, and ''Archiv der Mathematik und Physik'', 3rd series, vol. 1 (1901), pp. 44–63, 213–237.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature and influence of the problems==
Hilbert's problems ranged greatly in topic and precision.  Some of them are propounded precisely enough to enable a clear affirmative or negative answer, like the 3rd problem, which was the first to be solved, or the 8th problem (the [[Riemann hypothesis]]).  For other problems, such as the 5th, experts have traditionally agreed on a single interpretation, and a solution to the accepted interpretation has been given, but closely related unsolved problems exist.  Sometimes Hilbert's statements were not precise enough to specify a particular problem but were suggestive enough so that certain problems of more contemporary origin seem to apply, e.g. most modern number theorists would probably see the 9th problem as referring to the conjectural Langlands correspondence on representations of the absolute [[Galois group]] of a [[number field]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}  Still other problems, such as the 11th and the 16th, concern what are now flourishing mathematical subdisciplines, like the theories of quadratic forms and real algebraic curves.

There are two problems that are not only unresolved but may in fact be unresolvable by modern standards.  The 6th problem concerns the axiomatization of physics, a goal that twentieth-century developments of physics (including its recognition as a discipline independent from mathematics) seem to render both more remote and less important than in Hilbert's time.  Also, the 4th problem concerns the foundations of geometry, in a manner that is now generally judged to be too vague to enable a definitive answer.

The other twenty-one problems have all received significant attention, and late into the twentieth century work on these problems was still considered to be of the greatest importance.  [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] received the [[Fields Medal]] during 1966 for his work on the first problem, and the negative solution of the tenth problem during 1970 by [[Yuri Matiyasevich]] (completing work of [[Martin Davis]], [[Hilary Putnam]] and [[Julia Robinson]]) generated similar acclaim. Aspects of these problems are still of great interest today.

==Ignorabimus==
Following [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], Hilbert sought to define mathematics logically using the method of [[formal system]]s, i.e., [[finitism|finitistic]] proofs from an agreed-upon set of axioms.&lt;ref&gt;A reliable source of Hilbert's axiomatic system, his comments on them and on the foundational "crisis" that was on-going at the time (translated into English), appears as Hilbert's 1927 "The foundations of mathematics". This can be found on p. 464ff in Jean van Heijenoort (editor) 1976/1966, ''From Frege to Gödel: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879–1931'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge MA, {{ISBN|0-674-32449-8}} (pbk.).&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the main goals of [[Hilbert's program]] was a finitistic proof of the consistency of the axioms of arithmetic: that is his second problem.&lt;ref&gt;See Nagel and Newman revised by Hofstadter 2001:107, footnote #37: "Moreover, although most specialists in mathematical logic do not question the cogency of [Gentzen's] proof, it is not finitistic in the sense of Hilbert's original stipulations for an absolute proof of consistency." Also see next page: "But these proofs [Gentzen's et al.] cannot be mirrored inside the systems that they concern, and, since they are not finitistic, they do not achieve the proclaimed objectives of Hilbert's original program." Hofstadter rewrote the original (1958) footnote slightly, changing the word "students" to "specialists in mathematical logic". And this point is discussed again on page 109 and has not been modified by Hofstadter. (p.108)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Gödel's second incompleteness theorem]] gives a precise sense in which such a finitistic proof of the consistency of arithmetic is provably impossible.  Hilbert lived for 12 years after [[Kurt Gödel]] published his theorem, but does not seem to have written any formal response to Gödel's work.&lt;ref&gt;Reid reports that upon hearing about "Gödel's work from Bernays, he was 'somewhat angry'. . . . At first he was only angry and frustrated, but then he began to try to deal constructively with the problem. . . . It was not yet clear just what influence Gödel's work would ultimately have." (p. 198–199). Reid reports that Hilbert proposed a different form of induction called "'unendliche Induktion.' In 1931 two papers in the new direction appeared." (p. 199)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reid's biography of Hilbert, written during the 1960s from interviews and letters,  reports that "Godel (who never had any correspondence with Hilbert) feels that Hilbert's scheme for the foundations of mathematics 'remains highly interesting and important in spite of my negative results' (p. 217). Observe the use of present tense – she reports that Gödel and Bernays among others "answered my questions about Hilbert's work in logic and foundations"(p. vii).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilbert's tenth problem does not ask whether there exists an algorithm for deciding the solvability of [[Diophantine equations]], but rather asks for the ''construction'' of such an algorithm: "to devise a process according to which it can be determined in a finite number of operations whether the equation is solvable in rational integers." That this problem was solved by showing that there cannot be any such algorithm contradicted Hilbert's philosophy of mathematics.

In discussing his opinion that every mathematical problem should have a solution, Hilbert allows for the possibility that the solution could be a proof that the original problem is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;This issue that finds its beginnings in the "foundational crisis" of the early 20th century, in particular the controversy about under what circumstances could the [[Law of Excluded Middle]] be employed in proofs. See much more at [[Brouwer–Hilbert controversy]].&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that the point is to know one way or the other what the solution is, and he believed that we always can know this, that in mathematics there is not any "[[ignorabimus]]" (statement whose truth can never be known).&lt;ref&gt;"This conviction of the solvability of every mathematical problem is a powerful incentive to the worker. We hear within us the perpetual call: There is the problem. Seek its solution. You can find it by pure reason, for in mathematics there is no ''ignorabimus.''" (Hilbert 1902:445.)&lt;/ref&gt;  It seems unclear whether he would have regarded the solution of the tenth problem as an instance of ignorabimus: what is proved not to exist is not the integer solution, but (in a certain sense) the ability to discern in a specific way whether a solution exists.

On the other hand, the status of the first and second problems is even more complicated: there is not any clear mathematical consensus as to whether the results of Gödel (in the case of the second problem), or Gödel and Cohen (in the case of the first problem) give definitive negative solutions or not, since these solutions apply to a certain formalization of the problems, which is not necessarily the only possible one.&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, Newman and Hofstadter discuss this issue: "The possibility of constructing a finitistic absolute proof of consistency for a formal system such as ''Principia Mathematica'' is not excluded by Gödel's results. ... His argument does not eliminate the possibility ... But no one today appears to have a clear idea of what a finitistic proof would be like that is ''not'' capable of being mirrored inside ''Principia Mathematica'' (footnote 39, page 109). The authors conclude that the prospect "is most unlikely."&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 24th problem==
{{Main article|Hilbert's twenty-fourth problem}}
Hilbert originally included 24 problems on his list, but decided ''against'' including one of them in the published list.  The "24th problem" (in proof theory, on a criterion for [[simplicity]] and general methods) was rediscovered in Hilbert's original manuscript notes by German historian {{Interlanguage link multi|Rüdiger Thiele|de|3=Rüdiger Thiele (Mathematiker)}} in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/news/Thiele.pdf Hilbert's twenty-fourth problem] Rüdiger Thiele, American Mathematical Monthly, January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequels==
Since 1900, mathematicians and mathematical organizations have announced problem lists, but, with few exceptions, these collections have not had nearly as much influence nor generated as much work as Hilbert's problems.

One of the exceptions is furnished by three conjectures made by [[André Weil]] during the late 1940s (the [[Weil conjectures]]).  In the fields of algebraic geometry, number theory and the links between the two, the Weil conjectures were very important {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}.  The first of the Weil conjectures was proved by [[Bernard Dwork]], and a completely different proof of the first two conjectures via [[Étale cohomology|l-adic cohomology]] was given by [[Alexander Grothendieck]].  The last and deepest of the Weil conjectures (an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis) was proven by [[Pierre Deligne]].  Both Grothendieck and Deligne were awarded the [[Fields medal]].  However, the Weil conjectures in their scope are more like a single Hilbert problem, and Weil never intended them as a programme for all mathematics.  This is somewhat ironic, since arguably Weil was the mathematician of the 1940s and 1950s who best played the Hilbert role, being conversant with nearly all areas of (theoretical) mathematics and having figured importantly in the development of many of them.

[[Paul Erdős]] posed hundreds, if not thousands, of mathematical [[Paul Erdős#Erdős problems|problems]], many of them profound.  Erdős often offered monetary rewards; the size of the reward depended on the perceived difficulty of the problem.

The end of the millennium, being also the centennial of Hilbert's announcement of his problems, was a natural occasion to propose "a new set of Hilbert problems."  Several mathematicians accepted the challenge, notably Fields Medalist [[Steve Smale]], who responded to a request of [[Vladimir Arnold]] by proposing a list of 18 problems.
[[Smale's problems]] have thus far not received much attention from the media, and it is unclear how much serious attention they are getting from the mathematical community.

At least in the mainstream media, the ''de facto'' 21st century analogue of Hilbert's problems is the list of seven [[Millennium Prize Problems]] chosen during 2000 by the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]].  Unlike the Hilbert problems, where the primary award was the admiration of Hilbert in particular and mathematicians in general, each prize problem includes a million dollar bounty.  As with the Hilbert problems, one of the prize problems (the [[Poincaré conjecture]]) was solved relatively soon after the problems were announced.

Noteworthy for its appearance on the list of Hilbert problems, Smale's list and the list of Millennium Prize Problems — and even, in its geometric guise, in the Weil Conjectures — is the Riemann hypothesis.  Notwithstanding some famous recent assaults from major mathematicians of our day, many experts believe that the [[Riemann hypothesis]] will be included in problem lists for centuries yet.  Hilbert himself declared: "If I were to awaken after having slept for a thousand years, my first question would be: has the Riemann hypothesis been proven?"&lt;ref&gt;Mathematical mysteries: the beauty and magic of numbers
By Calvin C. Clawson, page 258&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[DARPA]] announced its own list of 23 problems which it hoped could cause major mathematical breakthroughs, "thereby strengthening the scientific and technological capabilities of [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/33361 | title=The world's 23 toughest math questions | date=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=c120bc7171c203aa5f4b3903aa08e558&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0 | title=DARPA Mathematics Challenge solicitation | date=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Of the cleanly formulated Hilbert problems, problems 3, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20, and 21 have a resolution that is accepted by consensus. On the other hand, problems 1, 2, 5, 9, 15, 18, and 22 have solutions that have partial acceptance, but there exists some controversy as to whether they resolve the problems.

That leaves 8 (the [[Riemann hypothesis]]), 12 and 16{{refn|Some authors consider this problem as too vague to ever be described as solved, although there is still active research on it.|group=n}} unresolved, and 4 and 23 as too vague to ever be described as solved. The withdrawn 24 would also be in this class. 6 is considered as a problem in physics rather than in mathematics.

In a speech to the German Informatics Society ([[Gesellschaft für Informatik]]) on October 11, 1990 in Stuttgart, sponsored by IBM-Germany, Postman said the following:  "The tie between information and action has been severed. Information is now a commodity that can be bought and sold, or used as a form of entertainment, or worn like a garment to enhance one's status. It comes indiscriminately, directed at no one in particular, disconnected from usefulness; we are glutted with information, drowning in information, have no control over it, don't know what to do with it."

In ''Amusing Ourselves to Death'' Postman frames the information-action ratio in the context of the telegraph's invention. Prior to the telegraph, Postman says people received information relevant to their lives, creating a high correlation between information and action:  "The information-action ratio was sufficiently close so that most people had a sense of being able to control some of the contingencies in their lives” (p.&amp;nbsp;69).

The telegraph allowed bits of information to travel long distances, and so Postman claims "the local and the timeless&amp;nbsp;... lost their central position in newspapers, eclipsed by the dazzle of distance and speed&amp;nbsp;... Wars, crimes, crashes, fires, floods—much of it the social and political equivalent of Adelaide's whooping coughs—became the content of what people called 'the news of the day'" (pp.&amp;nbsp;66–67).

A high information-action ratio, therefore, refers to the helplessness people confront when faced with decontextualized information.  Someone may know Adelaide has the whooping cough, but what could anyone do about it?  Postman said that this kind of access to decontextualized information "made the relationship between information and action both abstract and remote."  Information consumers were "faced with the problem of a diminished social and political potency."


The term was referenced in [[Arctic Monkeys]]' song "Four Out of Five" off the band's 2018 album [[Tranquility Base Hotel &amp; Casino]], where the Information Action Ratio is the name of a fictional taqueria on the moon.&lt;ref&gt;https://pitchfork.com/features/song-by-song/arctic-monkeys-alex-turner-decodes-every-song-on-tranquility-base-hotel-and-casino/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and family==

Károly Bezdek was born in [[Budapest]], Hungary, but grew up in [[Dunaújváros]], Hungary. His parents are Károly Bezdek, Sr. (mechanical engineer) and Magdolna Cserey. His brother András Bezdek is also a mathematician. Károly and his brother have scored at the top level in several Mathematics and Physics competitions for high school and university students in Hungary. Károly's list of awards include winning the first prize in the traditional [[Középiskolai Matematikai és Fizikai Lapok|KöMal]] (Hungarian Math. Journal for Highschool Students) contest in the academic year 1972–1973, as well as winning the first prize for the research results presented at the National Science Conference for Hungarian Undergraduate Students (TDK) in 1978. Károly entered [[Eötvös Loránd University]] in Hungary, and completed his Diploma in Mathematics in 1978. Bezdek is married to Éva Bezdek, and has three sons: [[23199 Bezdek|Dániel]], [[25038 Matebezdek|Máté]] and Márk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10998-006-0016-1| title =Dedication to Károly Bezdek | doi=10.1007/s10998-006-0016-1 | volume=53| year=2006| journal=Periodica Mathematica Hungarica| page=3 | last1 = Connelly | first1 = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''learnable evolution model''' ('''LEM''') is a non-[[Darwinian]] methodology for [[evolutionary computation]] that employs [[machine learning]] to guide the generation of new individuals ([[candidate solution|candidate problem solution]]s). Unlike standard, Darwinian-type evolutionary computation methods that use random or semi-random operators for generating new individuals (such as [[mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]]s and/or [[genetic recombination|recombination]]s), LEM employs hypothesis generation and instantiation operators.
 
The [[hypothesis generation]] operator applies a machine learning program to induce descriptions that distinguish between high-[[fitness (biology)|fitness]] and low-fitness individuals in each consecutive [[population]].  Such descriptions delineate areas in the [[Candidate solution|search space]] that most likely contain the desirable solutions. Subsequently the instantiation operator samples these areas to create new individuals.
LEM has been modified from optimization domain to classification domain by augmented LEM with ID3. (February 2013 by M. Elemam Shehab, K. Badran, M. Zaki and Gouda I. Salama.

'''''Math Country''''' is an [[instructional television]] program produced by [[Kentucky Educational Television]], in the late 1970s.

The show taught elementary math concepts and featured actor [[Ray Walston]] as a ghost named Lionel Hardway who inhabits the family farm, now lived in and ran by his descendants, helping them with various math problems, and sometimes getting involved in side stories involving the living members of the Hardway family.

Episodes were roughly 15 minutes in length (design for use during limited classroom time) and were broadcast on [[educational television|educational]] and [[public television]] channels during the school year.

Each broadcast was usually followed by a short called "Math Country Plus", which usually dealt with how a girl in school figured out how to solve problems on her own, using her own creativity and intellect, played by two actors who interacted with the girl on a fantasy set to represent the inside of the girl's head.

{{electromagnetism}}

There are various '''mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field''' that are used in the study of [[electromagnetism]], one of the four [[fundamental interaction]]s of nature. In this article, several approaches are discussed, although the equations are in terms of electric and magnetic fields, potentials, and charges with currents, generally speaking.

==Vector field approach==
{{main|Classical electromagnetism}}

The most common description of the electromagnetic field uses two three-dimensional [[vector field]]s called the [[electric field]] and the [[magnetic field]]. These vector fields each have a value defined at every point of space and time and are thus often regarded as functions of the space and time coordinates. As such, they are often written as {{nowrap|'''E'''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''t'')}} (electric field) and {{nowrap|'''B'''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''t'')}} (magnetic field).

If only the electric field ('''E''') is non-zero, and is constant in time, the field is said to be an [[electrostatic field]].  Similarly, if only the magnetic field ('''B''') is non-zero and is constant in time, the field is said to be a [[magnetostatic field]].  However, if either the electric or magnetic field has a time-dependence, then both fields must be considered together as a coupled electromagnetic field using [[Maxwell's equations]].

===Maxwell's equations in the vector field approach===

{{main|Maxwell's equations}}

The behaviour of electric and magnetic fields, whether in cases of electrostatics, magnetostatics, or [[electrodynamics]] (electromagnetic fields), is governed by [[Maxwell's equations]]:

where ''ρ'' is the charge density, which can (and often does) depend on time and position, ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[electric constant]], ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[magnetic constant]], and '''J''' is the current per unit area, also a function of time and position.  The equations take this form with the [[International System of Quantities]].

When dealing with only nondispersive isotropic linear materials, Maxwell's equations are often modified to ignore bound charges by replacing the permeability and permittivity of [[free space]] with the permeability and permittivity of the linear material in question.  For some materials that have more complex responses to electromagnetic fields, these properties can be represented by tensors, with time-dependence related to the material's ability to respond to rapid field changes ([[dispersion (optics)]], [[Green–Kubo relations]]), and possibly also field dependencies representing nonlinear and/or nonlocal material responses to large amplitude fields ([[nonlinear optics]]).

==Potential field approach==

Many times in the use and calculation of electric and magnetic fields, the approach used first computes an associated potential:  the [[electric potential]], ''&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;'', for the electric field, and the [[magnetic potential]], '''A''', for the magnetic field.  The electric potential is a scalar field, while the magnetic potential is a vector field.  This is why sometimes the electric potential is called the scalar potential and the magnetic potential is called the vector potential.  These potentials can be used to find their associated fields as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E = - \mathbf \nabla \varphi - \frac{\partial \mathbf A}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf B = \mathbf \nabla \times \mathbf A&lt;/math&gt;

===Maxwell's equations in potential formulation===

These relations can be substituted into Maxwell's equations to express the latter in terms of the potentials. [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]] and [[Gauss's law for magnetism]] reduce to identities (e.g., in the case of Gauss's Law for magnetism, {{nowrap|1=0 = 0}}).  The other two of Maxwell's equations turn out less simply.

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Maxwell's equations''' (''potential formulation'')

|cellpadding

|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

These equations taken together are as powerful and complete as Maxwell's equations.  Moreover, the problem has been reduced somewhat, as the electric and magnetic fields together had six components to solve for.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Electrodynamics by Griffiths&lt;/ref&gt;  In the potential formulation, there are only four components: the electric potential and the three components of the vector potential.  However, the equations are messier than Maxwell's equations using the electric and magnetic fields.

===Gauge freedom===

These equations can be simplified by taking advantage of the fact that only the electric and magnetic fields are physically meaningful quantities that can be measured; the potentials are not.  There is a freedom to constrain the form of the potentials provided that this does not affect the resultant electric and magnetic fields, called [[Gauge fixing#Gauge freedom|gauge freedom]].  Specifically for these equations, for any choice of a twice-differentiable scalar function of position and time ''λ'', if {{nowrap|(''φ'', '''A''')}} is a solution for a given system, then so is another potential {{nowrap|(''φ''′, '''A'''′)}} given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi' = \varphi - \frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A' = \mathbf A + \mathbf \nabla \lambda .&lt;/math&gt;

This freedom can be used to simplify the potential formulation.  Either of two such scalar functions is typically chosen: the Coulomb gauge and the Lorenz gauge.

====Coulomb gauge====

The [[Coulomb gauge]] is chosen in such a way that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf \nabla \cdot \mathbf A' = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which corresponds to the case of magnetostatics.  In terms of ''λ'', this means that it must satisfy the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \lambda = - \mathbf \nabla \cdot \mathbf A&lt;/math&gt;.

This choice of function results in the following formulation of Maxwell's equations:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \varphi' = -\frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \mathbf A' - \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2\! \mathbf A'}{\partial t^2} = - \mu_0 \mathbf J + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \nabla\!\! \left (\! \frac{\partial \varphi'}{\partial t} \!\right )&lt;/math&gt;

Several features about Maxwell's equations in the Coulomb gauge are as follows.  Firstly, solving for the electric potential is very easy, as the equation is a version of [[Poisson's equation]].  Secondly, solving for the magnetic vector potential is particularly difficult. This is the big disadvantage of this gauge.  The third thing to note, and something which is not immediately obvious, is that the electric potential changes instantly everywhere in response to a change in conditions in one locality.

For instance, if a charge is moved in New York at 1 pm local time, then a hypothetical observer in Australia who could measure the electric potential directly would measure a change in the potential at 1 pm New York time.  This seemingly goes violates causality in [[special relativity]], i.e. the impossibility of information, signals, or anything travelling faster than the speed of light.  The resolution to this apparent problem lies in the fact that, as previously stated, no observers can measure the potentials; they measure the electric and magnetic fields.  So, the combination of '''∇'''''φ'' and ∂'''A'''/∂''t'' used in determining the electric field restores the speed limit imposed by special relativity for the electric field, making all observable quantities consistent with relativity.

====Lorenz gauge condition====

A gauge that is often used is the [[Lorenz gauge condition]]. In this, the scalar function ''λ'' is chosen such that

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf \nabla \cdot \mathbf A' = - \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \varphi'}{\partial t} ,&lt;/math&gt;

meaning that ''λ'' must satisfy the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \lambda - \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \lambda }{\partial t^2}= - \mathbf \nabla \cdot \mathbf A - \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial t} .&lt;/math&gt;

The Lorenz gauge results in the following form of Maxwell's equations:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \varphi' - \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \varphi'}{\partial t^2} = \Box^2 \varphi' = - \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \mathbf A' - \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf A'}{\partial t^2} = \Box^2 \mathbf A' = - \mu_0 \mathbf J&lt;/math&gt;

The operator &lt;math&gt;\Box^2&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[d'Alembertian]] (some authors denote this by only the square &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;).  These equations are inhomogeneous versions of the [[wave equation]], with the terms on the right side of the equation serving as the source functions for the wave.  As with any wave equation, these equations lead to two types of solution: advanced potentials (which are related to the configuration of the sources at future points in time), and retarded potentials (which are related to the past configurations of the sources); the former are usually disregarded where the field is to analyzed from a causality perspective.

As pointed out above, the Lorenz gauge is no more valid than any other gauge since the potentials cannot be measured. Despite this, there are certain quantum mechanical phenomena in which potentials appear to affect particles in regions where the observable field vanishes throughout the region, for example as in the [[Aharonov–Bohm effect]]. However, these phenomena do not provide a means to directly measure the potentials nor to detect a difference between different but mutually [[#Potential formulation|gauge equivalent]] potentials.  The Lorenz gauge has the further advantage of the equations being [[Lorentz invariant]].

===Extension to quantum electrodynamics===

[[Canonical quantization]] of the electromagnetic fields proceeds by elevating the scalar and vector potentials; ''φ''('''x'''), '''A'''('''x'''), from fields to [[field operator]]s. Substituting {{nowrap|1=1/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} into the previous Lorenz gauge equations gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \mathbf A - \frac 1 {c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf A}{\partial t^2} = - \mu_0 \mathbf J&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \varphi - \frac 1 {c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial t^2} = - \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, '''J''' and ''ρ'' are the current and charge density of the ''[[matter]] [[Quantum field theory|field]]''. If the matter field is taken so as to describe the interaction of electromagnetic fields with the [[Dirac equation|Dirac electron]] given by the four-component [[Dirac spinor]] field ''ψ'', the current and charge densities have form:&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/QuantumElectrodynamics.html Quantum Electrodynamics, Mathworld]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}=-e\psi^{\dagger}\boldsymbol{\alpha}\psi\,\quad \rho=-e\psi^{\dagger}\psi \,,&lt;/math&gt;
where '''''α''''' are the first three [[Gamma matrices|Dirac matrices]]. Using this, we can re-write Maxwell's equations as:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Maxwell's equations''' ([[Quantum electrodynamics|''QED'']])
|equation=&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \mathbf A - \frac 1 {c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf A}{\partial t^2} = \mu_0 e \psi^{\dagger} \boldsymbol{\alpha} \psi &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \varphi - \frac 1 {c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial t^2} = \frac{1}{\varepsilon_0} e \psi^{\dagger} \psi&lt;/math&gt;

which is the form used in [[quantum electrodynamics]].

==Geometric algebra formulations==

Analogous to the tensor formulation, two objects, one for the field and one for the current, are introduced. In [[geometric algebra]] (GA) these are [[multivector]]s. The field multivector, known as the [[Riemann–Silberstein vector]], is

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \mathbf{E} + Ic\mathbf{B} = E^k\sigma_k + IcB^k\sigma_k&lt;/math&gt;
and the current multivector is
:&lt;math&gt; c \rho - \mathbf{J} = c \rho - J^k\sigma_k&lt;/math&gt;

where, in the [[algebra of physical space]] (APS) &lt;math&gt;C\ell_{3,0}(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; with the vector basis &lt;math&gt;\{\sigma_k\}&lt;/math&gt;. The unit [[pseudoscalar]] is &lt;math&gt;I=\sigma_1\sigma_2\sigma_3&lt;/math&gt; (assuming an [[orthonormal basis]]). Orthonormal basis vectors share the algebra of the [[Pauli matrices]], but are usually not equated with them.  After defining the derivative

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\nabla} = \sigma^k \partial_k&lt;/math&gt;

Maxwell's equations are reduced to the single equation&lt;ref&gt;Oersted Medal Lecture [[David Hestenes]] "Reforming the Mathematical Language of Physics" (Am. J. Phys. 71 (2), February 2003, pp. 104–121) Online:http://geocalc.clas.asu.edu/html/Oersted-ReformingTheLanguage.html p26&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Maxwell's equations ''' ''(APS formulation)''
|equation=&lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{1}{c}\dfrac{\partial }{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{\nabla}\right)\mathbf{F} = \mu_0 c (c \rho - \mathbf{J}). &lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding

In three dimensions, the derivative has a special structure allowing the introduction of a cross product:

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{F} = \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{F} + \boldsymbol{\nabla} \wedge \mathbf{F} = \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{F} + I \boldsymbol{\nabla} \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt;

from which it is easily seen that Gauss's law is the scalar part, the Ampère–Maxwell law is the vector part, Faraday's law is the pseudovector part, and Gauss's law for magnetism is the pseudoscalar part of the equation.  After expanding and rearranging, this can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
\left( \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E} - \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \right)- c \left( \boldsymbol{\nabla} \times \mathbf{B} - \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial {\mathbf{E}}}{\partial {t}} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J} \right)+ I \left( \boldsymbol{\nabla} \times \mathbf{E} + \frac{\partial {\mathbf{B}}}{\partial {t}} \right)+ I c \left( \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{B} \right)= 0 
&lt;/math&gt;

We can identify APS as a subalgebra of the [[spacetime algebra]] (STA) &lt;math&gt;C\ell_{1,3}(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt;, defining &lt;math&gt;\sigma_k=\gamma_k\gamma_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I=\gamma_0\gamma_1\gamma_2\gamma_3&lt;/math&gt;.  The &lt;math&gt;\gamma_\mu&lt;/math&gt;s have the same algebraic properties of the [[gamma matrices]] but their matrix representation is not needed.  The derivative is now

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla = \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

The Riemann–Silberstein becomes a bivector

&lt;math&gt;F = \mathbf{E} + Ic\mathbf{B} = E^1\gamma_1\gamma_0 + E^2\gamma_2\gamma_0 + E^3\gamma_3\gamma_0 -c(B^1\gamma_2\gamma_3 + B^2\gamma_3\gamma_1 + B^3\gamma_1\gamma_2),&lt;/math&gt;

and the charge and current density become a vector

:&lt;math&gt;J = J^\mu \gamma_\mu = c \rho \gamma_0 + J^k \gamma_k = \gamma_0(c \rho - J^k \sigma_k).&lt;/math&gt;

Owing to the identity

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_0 \nabla = \gamma_0\gamma^0 \partial_0 + \gamma_0\gamma^k\partial_k = \partial_0 + \sigma^k\partial_k = \frac{1}{c}\dfrac{\partial }{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{\nabla},&lt;/math&gt;

Maxwell's equations reduce to the single equation

==Differential forms approach==
{{see also|Differential form|Exterior algebra|}}

===Field 2-form===

In [[Vacuum|free space]], where {{nowrap|1=''ε'' = [[electric constant|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]}} and {{nowrap|1=''μ'' = [[magnetic constant|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]}} are constant everywhere, Maxwell's equations simplify considerably once the language of [[differential geometry]] and [[differential form]]s is used. In what follows, [[Gaussian units|cgs-Gaussian units]], not [[SI units]] are used. (To convert to SI, see [[Gaussian units|here]].) The electric and magnetic fields are now jointly described by a [[Differential form|2-form]] '''F''' in a 4-dimensional [[spacetime]] manifold. The Faraday tensor &lt;math&gt;F_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; ([[electromagnetic tensor]]) can be written as a 2-form in Minkowski space with metric signature {{math|(- + + +)}} as

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\mathbf{F} \equiv &amp; \frac{1}{2}F_{\mu\nu} \mathrm{d}x^{\mu} \wedge \mathrm{d}x^{\nu} \\
= &amp; B_x \mathrm{d}y \wedge \mathrm{d}z + B_y \mathrm{d}z \wedge \mathrm{d}x + B_z \mathrm{d}x \wedge \mathrm{d}y + E_x \mathrm{d}x \wedge \mathrm{d}t + E_y \mathrm{d}y \wedge \mathrm{d}t + E_z \mathrm{d}z \wedge \mathrm{d}t
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

which, as the [[curvature form]], is the [[exterior derivative]] of the [[electromagnetic four-potential]],

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \mathrm{d} \mathbf{A} = ( \partial_{\mu}  A_{\nu} ) \mathrm{d}x^{\mu} \wedge \mathrm{d}x^{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

The source free equations can be written by the action of the exterior derivative on this 2-form. But for the equations with source terms ([[Gauss's law]] and the [[Ampère-Maxwell equation]]), the [[Hodge dual]] of this 2-form is needed. The Hodge 'star' dual takes a ''p''-form to a ({{nowrap|''n'' &amp;minus; ''p''}})-form, where ''n'' is the number of dimensions. Here, it takes the 2-form (''F'') and gives another 2-form (in four dimensions, {{nowrap|1=''n'' &amp;minus; ''p'' = 4 &amp;minus; 2 = 2}}). For the basis cotangent vectors, the Hodge dual is given as (see [[Hodge dual#Four dimensions|here]])

:&lt;math&gt; {\star \mathrm{d}x} \wedge \mathrm{d}y = - \mathrm{d}z \wedge \mathrm{d}t ,\quad {\star \mathrm{d}x} \wedge \mathrm{d}t = \mathrm{d}y \wedge \mathrm{d}z, &lt;/math&gt;

and so on. Using these relations, the dual of the Faraday 2-form is the Maxwell tensor,

:&lt;math&gt;
{\star \mathbf{F}} = - B_x \mathrm{d}x \wedge \mathrm{d}t - B_y \mathrm{d}y \wedge \mathrm{d}t - B_z \mathrm{d}z \wedge \mathrm{d}t + E_x \mathrm{d}y \wedge \mathrm{d}z + E_y \mathrm{d}z \wedge \mathrm{d}x + E_z \mathrm{d}x \wedge \mathrm{d}y
&lt;/math&gt;

===Current 3-form, dual current 1-form===

Here, the 3-form '''J''' is called the ''electric current form'' or ''[[differential form#Applications in physics|current 3-form]]'':

:&lt;math&gt; 
\mathbf{J} = \rho\, \mathrm{d}x \wedge \mathrm{d}y \wedge \mathrm{d}z - j_x \mathrm{d}t \wedge \mathrm{d}y \wedge \mathrm{d}z - j_y \mathrm{d}t \wedge \mathrm{d}z \wedge \mathrm{d}x - j_z \mathrm{d}t \wedge \mathrm{d}x \wedge \mathrm{d}y
&lt;/math&gt;

with the corresponding dual 1-form:

:&lt;math&gt; 
{{\star}\mathbf{J}} = -\rho\, \mathrm{d}t + j_x \mathrm{d}x + j_y \mathrm{d}y + j_z \mathrm{d}z 
&lt;/math&gt;

Maxwell's equations then reduce to the [[Bianchi identity]] and the source equation, respectively:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Maxwell's equations''' (''current 3-form'')
|equation=&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\mathbf{F}=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}{\star}\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4}}

where d denotes the [[exterior derivative]] – a natural coordinate- and metric-independent differential operator acting on forms, and the (dual) [[Hodge star]] operator &lt;math&gt;{\star}&lt;/math&gt; is a linear transformation from the space of 2-forms to the space of (4 − 2)-forms defined by the metric in [[Minkowski space]] (in four dimensions even by any metric [[conformal geometry|conformal]] to this metric). The fields are in [[natural units]] where {{nowrap|1=1/4π''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1}}.

Since d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0, the 3-form '''J''' satisfies the conservation of current ([[Continuity equation#Electromagnetism|continuity equation]]):
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}{\mathbf{J}}=\mathrm{d}^2{\star}\mathbf{F}=0.&lt;/math&gt;
The current 3-form can be integrated over a 3-dimensional space-time region. The physical interpretation of this integral is the charge in that region if it is spacelike, or the amount of charge that flows through a surface in a certain amount of time if that region is a spacelike surface cross a timelike interval.
As the exterior derivative is defined on any [[manifold]], the differential form version of the Bianchi identity makes sense for any 4-dimensional manifold, whereas the source equation
is defined if the manifold is oriented and has a Lorentz metric. In particular the differential form version of the Maxwell equations are a convenient and intuitive formulation of the
Maxwell equations in general relativity.

''Note:'' In much of the literature, the notations &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\star}\mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt; are switched, so that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt; is a 1-form called the current and &lt;math&gt;{\star}\mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt; is a 3-form called the dual current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Charles W. Misner|Misner, Charles W.]]|page=81 |author2=[[Kip Thorne|Thorne, Kip]] |author3=[[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler, John Archibald]]|year=1973|title=Gravitation|publisher=W. H. Freeman|isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Linear macroscopic influence of matter====

In a linear, macroscopic theory, the influence of matter on the electromagnetic field is described through more general linear transformation in the space of 2-forms. We call
:&lt;math&gt; C:\Lambda^2\ni\mathbf{F}\mapsto \mathbf{G}\in\Lambda^{(4-2)}&lt;/math&gt;
the constitutive transformation. The role of this transformation is comparable to the Hodge duality transformation. The Maxwell equations in the presence of matter then become:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}\mathbf{F} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}\mathbf{G} = \mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt;
where the current 3-form '''J''' still satisfies the continuity equation {{nowrap|1=d'''J''' = 0}}.

When the fields are expressed as linear combinations (of [[exterior product]]s) of basis forms ''θ''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \frac{1}{2}F_{pq}\mathbf{\theta}^p\wedge\mathbf{\theta}^q.&lt;/math&gt;
the constitutive relation takes the form
:&lt;math&gt; G_{pq} = C_{pq}^{mn}F_{mn}&lt;/math&gt;
where the field coefficient functions are antisymmetric in the indices and the constitutive coefficients are antisymmetric in the corresponding pairs. In particular, the Hodge duality transformation leading to the vacuum equations discussed above are obtained by taking
:&lt;math&gt; C_{pq}^{mn} = \frac{1}{2}g^{ma}g^{nb} \epsilon_{abpq} \sqrt{-g} &lt;/math&gt;
which up to scaling is the only invariant tensor of this type that can be defined with the metric.

In this formulation, electromagnetism generalises immediately to any 4-dimensional oriented manifold or with small adaptations any manifold.

==Curved spacetime==
{{anchor|Curved spacetime}}

===Traditional formulation===
Matter and energy generate curvature of [[spacetime]]. This is the subject of [[general relativity]]. Curvature of spacetime affects electrodynamics. An electromagnetic field having energy and momentum also generates curvature in spacetime. Maxwell's equations in curved spacetime can be obtained by replacing the derivatives in the equations in flat spacetime with [[covariant derivative]]s. (Whether this is the appropriate generalization requires separate investigation.) The sourced and source-free equations become ([[Gaussian units|cgs-Gaussian units]]):

:&lt;math&gt; { 4 \pi \over c   }j^{\beta} = \partial_{\alpha} F^{\alpha\beta} + {\Gamma^{\alpha}}_{\mu\alpha} F^{\mu\beta} + {\Gamma^{\beta}}_{\mu\alpha} F^{\alpha \mu} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \nabla_{\alpha} F^{\alpha\beta} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  {F^{\alpha\beta}}_{;\alpha} \, \!&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;0 = \partial_{\gamma} F_{\alpha\beta} + \partial_{\beta} F_{\gamma\alpha} + \partial_{\alpha} F_{\beta\gamma} = \nabla_{\gamma} F_{\alpha\beta} + \nabla_{\beta} F_{\gamma\alpha} + \nabla_{\alpha} F_{\beta\gamma}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Here,

:&lt;math&gt;{\Gamma^{\alpha}}_{\mu\beta} \!&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[Christoffel symbol]] that characterizes the curvature of spacetime and ∇&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt; is the covariant derivative.

===Formulation in terms of differential forms===
The formulation of the Maxwell equations in terms of [[differential form]]s can be used without change in general relativity. The equivalence of the more traditional general relativistic formulation using the covariant derivative with the differential form formulation can be seen as follows. Choose local coordinates ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt; which gives a basis of 1-forms d''x''&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt; in every point of the open set where the coordinates are defined. Using this basis and [[Gaussian units|cgs-Gaussian units]] we define

*The antisymmetric field tensor ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''αβ''&lt;/sub&gt;, corresponding to the field 2-form '''F'''
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \frac{1}{2}F_{\alpha\beta} \,\mathrm{d}x^{\alpha} \wedge \mathrm{d}x^{\beta}.&lt;/math&gt;
*The current-vector infinitesimal 3-form '''J'''
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J} = {4 \pi \over c } \left ( \frac{1}{6} j^{\alpha} \sqrt{-g} \, \epsilon_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta} \mathrm{d}x^{\beta} \wedge \mathrm{d}x^{\gamma} \wedge \mathrm{d}x^{\delta}. \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The epsilon tensor contracted with the differential 3-form produces 6 times the number of terms required.

Here ''g'' is as usual the [[determinant]] of the matrix representing the [[metric tensor]], ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''αβ''&lt;/sub&gt;. A small computation that uses the symmetry of the [[Christoffel symbols]] (i.e., the torsion-freeness of the [[Levi-Civita connection]]) and the covariant constantness of the [[Hodge star operator]] then shows that in this coordinate neighborhood we have:

*the Bianchi identity
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}\mathbf{F} = 2(\partial_{\gamma} F_{\alpha\beta} + \partial_{\beta} F_{\gamma\alpha} + \partial_{\alpha} F_{\beta\gamma})\mathrm{d}x^{\alpha}\wedge \mathrm{d}x^{\beta} \wedge \mathrm{d}x^{\gamma} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
*the source equation

==Classical electrodynamics as the curvature of a line bundle==
An elegant and intuitive way to formulate Maxwell's equations is to use complex [[line bundle]]s or [[principal bundle]]s with fibre [[U(1)]]. The [[connection (mathematics)|connection]] ∇ on the line bundle has a [[Curvature form|curvature]] '''F''' = ∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which is a two-form that automatically satisfies {{nowrap|1=d'''F''' = 0}} and can be interpreted as a field-strength. If the line bundle is trivial with flat reference connection ''d'' we can write ∇ = d + '''A''' and {{nowrap|1='''F''' = d'''A'''}} with '''A''' the [[differential form|1-form]] composed of the [[electric potential]] and the [[magnetic vector potential]].

In quantum mechanics, the connection itself is used to define the dynamics of the system. This formulation allows a natural description of the [[Aharonov–Bohm effect]]. In this experiment, a static magnetic field runs through a long magnetic wire (e.g., an iron wire magnetized longitudinally). Outside of this wire the magnetic induction is zero, in contrast to the vector potential, which essentially depends on the magnetic flux through the cross-section of the wire and does not vanish outside. Since there is no electric field either, the Maxwell tensor {{nowrap|1='''F''' = 0}} throughout the space-time region outside the tube, during the experiment. This means by definition that the connection ∇ is flat there.

However, as mentioned, the connection depends on the magnetic field through the tube since the [[holonomy]] along a non-contractible curve encircling the tube is the magnetic flux through the tube in the proper units. This can be detected quantum-mechanically with a double-slit electron diffraction experiment on an electron wave traveling around the tube. The holonomy corresponds to an extra phase shift, which leads to a shift in the diffraction pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Discussion==

Following are the reasons for using each of such formulations.

===Potential formulation===

In advanced classical mechanics it is often useful, and in quantum mechanics frequently essential, to express Maxwell's equations in a ''potential formulation'' involving the [[electric potential]] (also called [[scalar potential]]) ''φ'', and the [[magnetic potential]] (also called [[vector potential]]) '''A'''. For example, the analysis of radio antennas makes full use of Maxwell's vector and scalar potentials to separate the variables, a common technique used in formulating the solutions of differential equations. The potentials can be introduced by using the [[Poincaré lemma]] on the homogeneous equations to solve them in a universal way (this assumes that we consider a [[topology|topologically]] simple, e.g. [[contractible space]]). The potentials are defined as in the table above. Alternatively, these equations define '''E''' and '''B''' in terms of the electric and magnetic potentials which then satisfy the homogeneous equations for '''E''' and '''B''' as identities. Substitution gives the non-homogeneous Maxwell equations in potential form.

Many different choices of '''A''' and ''φ'' are consistent with given observable electric and magnetic fields '''E''' and '''B''', so the potentials seem to contain more, ([[classical physics|classically]]) unobservable information. The non uniqueness of the potentials is well understood, however. For every scalar function of position and time {{nowrap|''λ''(''x'', ''t'')}}, the potentials can be changed by a [[gauge transformation]] as 
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi' = \varphi - \frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial t}, \quad \mathbf A' = \mathbf A + \mathbf \nabla \lambda&lt;/math&gt;
without changing the electric and magnetic field. Two pairs of gauge transformed potentials {{nowrap|(''φ'', '''A''')}} and {{nowrap|(''φ''′, '''A'''′)}} are called ''gauge equivalent'', and the freedom to select any pair of potentials in its gauge equivalence class is called [[Gauge fixing#Gauge freedom|gauge freedom]]. Again by the Poincaré lemma (and under its assumptions), gauge freedom is the only source of indeterminacy, so the field formulation is equivalent to the potential formulation if we consider the potential equations as equations for gauge equivalence classes.

The potential equations can be simplified using a procedure called [[gauge fixing]]. Since the potentials are only defined up to gauge equivalence, we are free to impose additional equations on the potentials, as long as for every pair of potentials there is a gauge equivalent pair that satisfies the additional equations (i.e. if the gauge fixing equations define a [[Gauge Theory#slice|slice]] to the gauge action).  The gauge-fixed potentials still have a gauge freedom under all gauge transformations that leave the gauge fixing equations invariant. Inspection of the potential equations suggests two natural choices. In the [[Coulomb gauge]], we impose {{nowrap|1='''∇''' &amp;sdot; '''A''' = 0}} which is mostly used in the case of magneto statics when we can neglect the ''c''&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;∂&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''A'''/∂''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; term. In the [[Lorenz gauge]] (named after the Dane [[Ludvig Lorenz]]), we impose 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf \nabla \cdot \mathbf A + \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial t} = 0\,.&lt;/math&gt;
The Lorenz gauge condition has the advantage of being Lorentz invariant and leading to Lorentz-invariant equations for the potentials.

===Manifestly covariant (tensor) approach===

Maxwell's equations are exactly consistent with [[special relativity]]—i.e., if they are valid in one inertial reference frame, then they are automatically valid in every other inertial reference frame. In fact, Maxwell's equations were crucial in the historical development of special relativity. However, in the usual formulation of Maxwell's equations, their consistency with special relativity is not obvious; it can only be proven by a laborious calculation.

For example, consider a [[Moving magnet and conductor problem|conductor moving in the field of a magnet]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert Einstein (1905) ''On the electrodynamics of moving bodies''&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[inertial frame|frame]] of the magnet, that conductor experiences a ''magnetic'' force. But in the frame of a conductor moving relative to the magnet, the conductor experiences a force due to an ''electric'' field. The motion is exactly consistent in these two different reference frames, but it mathematically arises in quite different ways.

For this reason and others, it is often useful to rewrite Maxwell's equations in a way that is "manifestly covariant"—i.e. ''obviously'' consistent with special relativity, even with just a glance at the equations—using [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant and contravariant four-vectors and tensors]]. This can be done using the [[EM tensor]] '''F''', or the [[4-potential]] '''A''', with the [[4-current]] '''J''' – see [[covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism]].

===Differential forms approach===

Gauss's law for magnetism and the Faraday–Maxwell law can be grouped together since the equations are homogeneous, and be seen as [[Differential geometry|geometric]] ''identities'' expressing the ''field'' '''F''' (a 2-form), which can be derived from the ''4-potential'' '''A'''. Gauss's law for electricity and the Ampere–Maxwell law could be seen as the ''dynamical [[equations of motion]]'' of the fields, obtained via the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] principle of [[least action]], from the "interaction term" '''AJ''' (introduced through [[gauge theory|gauge]] [[covariant derivative]]s), coupling the field to matter. For the field formulation of Maxwell's equations in terms of a principle of extremal [[Action (physics)|action]], see [[Electromagnetic tensor#Lagrangian formulation of classical electromagnetism without charges and currents|electromagnetic tensor]].

Often, the time derivative in the Faraday–Maxwell equation motivates calling this equation "dynamical", which is somewhat misleading in the sense of the preceding analysis. This is rather an artifact of breaking [[special relativity|relativistic]] [[covariance]] by choosing a preferred time direction. To have physical degrees of freedom propagated by these field equations, one must include a [[kinetic term]] {{nowrap|'''F''' ⋆'''F'''}} for '''A''', and take into account the non-physical degrees of freedom that can be removed by [[gauge transformation]] {{nowrap|'''A''' ↦ '''A''' − d''α''}}. See also [[gauge fixing]] and [[Faddeev–Popov ghost]]s.

===Geometric calculus approach===

This formulation uses the algebra that [[spacetime]] generates through the introduction of a distributive, associative (but not commutative) product called the [[geometric algebra|geometric product]]. Elements and operations of the algebra can generally be associated with geometric meaning. The members of the algebra may be decomposed by grade (as in the formalism of differential forms) and the (geometric) product of a vector with a ''k''-vector decomposes into a {{nowrap|(''k'' − 1)}}-vector and a {{nowrap|(''k'' + 1)}}-vector. The {{nowrap|(''k'' − 1)}}-vector component can be identified with the inner product and the {{nowrap|(''k'' + 1)}}-vector component with the outer product. It is of algebraic convenience that the geometric product is invertible, while the inner and outer products are not. The derivatives that appear in Maxwell's equations are vectors and electromagnetic fields are represented by the Faraday bivector '''F'''. This formulation is as general as that of differential forms for manifolds with a metric tensor, as then these are naturally identified with ''r''-forms and there are corresponding operations. Maxwell's equations reduce to one equation in this formalism. This equation can be separated into parts as is done above for comparative reasons.

In [[computer science]], '''model checking''' or '''property checking''' refers to the following problem:
Given a model of a system, exhaustively and automatically check whether this model meets a given specification. Typically, one has hardware or software systems in mind, whereas the specification contains safety requirements such as the absence of [[deadlock]]s and similar critical states that can cause the system to [[Crash (computing)|crash]]. Model checking is a technique for automatically verifying correctness properties of ''finite-state'' systems.

In order to solve such a problem [[algorithm]]ically, both the model of the system and the specification are formulated in some precise mathematical language. To this end, the problem is formulated as a task in [[logic]], namely to
check whether a given [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] satisfies a given logical formula.
This general concept applies to many kinds of logics and suitable structures. A simple model checking problem is verifying whether a given formula in the [[Propositional calculus|propositional logic]] is satisfied by a given structure.

== Overview ==

Property checking is used for [[Software verification|verification]] instead of [[equivalence checking]] when two descriptions are not functionally equivalent. Particularly, during [[Refinement (computing)|refinement]], the specification is complemented with the details that are [[don't care|unnecessary]] in the higher level specification. Yet, there is no need to verify the newly introduced properties against the original specification. It is not even possible. Therefore, the strict bi-directional equivalence check is relaxed to one-way property checking. The implementation or design is regarded a model of the circuit whereas the specifications are properties that the model must satisfy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lam K.|first=William |year=2005 |title=Hardware Design Verification: Simulation and Formal Method-Based Approaches |url=http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/electrical-engineering/semiconductor-technology/0131433474/an-invitation-to-design-verification/ch01lev1sec1#X2ludGVybmFsX0h0bWxWaWV3P3htbGlkPTAxMzE0MzM0NzQlMkZjaDAxbGV2MXNlYzEmcXVlcnk9 |accessdate=December 12, 2012|chapter=Chapter 1.1: What Is Design Verification?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important class of model checking methods have been developed for checking models of [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]] designs
where the specification is given by a [[temporal logic]] formula.
Pioneering work in temporal logic specification was done by [[Amir Pnueli]], who received the 1996 Turing award for "[...] seminal work introducing temporal logic into computing science",.&lt;ref&gt;http://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/pnueli_4725172.cfm/&lt;/ref&gt;  Model checking began with

Model checking is most often applied to hardware designs. For software, because of undecidability (see [[Computability theory (computer science)|computability theory]]) the approach cannot be fully algorithmic; typically it may fail to prove or disprove a given property. In embedded systems hardware designs it is possible to validate (verify against some specified requirements) a specification delivered i.e. by means of UML activity diagrams&lt;ref&gt;I. Grobelna, M. Grobelny, M. Adamski, "Model Checking of UML Activity Diagrams in Logic Controllers Design", Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Dependability and Complex Systems DepCoS-RELCOMEX, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing Volume 286, Springer International Publishing Switzerland, pp. 233-242, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; or control interpreted Petri nets.&lt;ref&gt;I. Grobelna, "Formal verification of embedded logic controller specification with computer deduction in temporal logic", Przeglad Elektrotechniczny, Vol.87, Issue 12a, pp.47-50, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure is usually given as a source code description in an industrial [[hardware description language]] or a special-purpose language.  Such a program corresponds to a [[finite state machine]] (FSM), i.e., a [[directed graph]] consisting of nodes (or [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]]) and [[edge (graph theory)|edges]]. A set of atomic propositions is associated with each node, typically stating which memory elements are one. The [[Node (computer science)|nodes]] represent states of a system, the edges represent possible transitions which may alter the state, while the atomic propositions represent the basic properties that hold at a point of execution.

Formally, the problem can be stated as follows: given a desired property, expressed as a temporal logic formula ''p'', and a structure ''M'' with initial state ''s'', decide if &lt;math&gt;M,s \models p&lt;/math&gt;.  If M is finite, as it is in hardware, model checking reduces to a graph search.

=== Symbolic model checking ===
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}

Instead of enumerating reachable states one at a time, the state space can sometimes be traversed more efficiently by considering large numbers of states at a single step.
When such state space traversal is based on representations of set of states and transition relations as logical formulas, [[binary decision diagrams]] (BDD) or other related data structures,
the model-checking method is symbolic.

Historically, the first symbolic methods used [[Binary decision diagram|BDD]]s.
After the success of [[propositional satisfiability]] in solving the [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]] problem in [[artificial intelligence]] (see [[satplan]]) in 1996,
the same approach was generalized to model checking for the [[Linear Temporal Logic]] LTL (the planning problem corresponds to model-checking for safety properties).
This method is known as bounded model checking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = E. | last2 = Biere | first2 = A. | last3 = Raimi | first3 = R. | last4 = Zhu | first4 = Y. | journal = Formal Methods in System Design | volume = 19 | pages = 7 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1023/A:1011276507260|title=Bounded Model Checking Using Satisfiability Solving}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of [[Boolean satisfiability problem|Boolean satisfiability solvers]] in bounded model checking led to the widespread use of satisfiability solvers in symbolic model checking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vizel | first1 = Y. | last2 = Weissenbacher | first2 = G. | last3 = Malik | first3 = S. | journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 103 | issue = 11 | year = 2015 | doi = 10.1109/JPROC.2015.2455034|title=Boolean Satisfiability Solvers and Their Applications in Model Checking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==
Model checking tools face a combinatorial blow up of the state-space, commonly known as the [[state explosion problem]], that must be addressed to solve most real-world problems.  There are several approaches to combat this problem.

# Symbolic algorithms avoid ever explicitly constructing the graph for the finite state machines (FSM); instead, they represent the graph implicitly using a formula in quantified propositional logic.  The use of binary decision diagrams (BDDs) was made popular by the work of Ken McMillan&lt;ref&gt;* ''Symbolic Model Checking'', Kenneth L. McMillan, Kluwer, {{ISBN|0-7923-9380-5}}, [http://www.kenmcmil.com/thesis.html also online].&lt;/ref&gt; and development of open-source BDD manipulation libraries such as [http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~fabio/CUDD/ CUDD] and [http://vlsicad.eecs.umich.edu/BK/Slots/cache/www.itu.dk/research/buddy/ BuDDy].
# Bounded model checking algorithms unroll the FSM for a fixed number of steps &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and check whether a property violation can occur in &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; or fewer steps. This typically involves encoding the restricted model as an instance of [[Boolean satisfiability problem|SAT]]. The process can be repeated with larger and larger values of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; until all possible violations have been ruled out (cf. [[Iterative deepening depth-first search]]).
# [[Partial order reduction]] can be used (on explicitly represented graphs) to reduce the number of independent interleavings of concurrent processes that need to be considered. The basic idea is that if it does not matter, for the kind of things one intends to prove, whether A or B is executed first, then it is a waste of time to consider both the AB and the BA interleavings.
# [[abstract interpretation|Abstraction]] attempts to prove properties on a system by first simplifying it.  The simplified system usually does not satisfy exactly the same properties as the original one so that a process of refinement may be necessary. Generally, one requires the abstraction to be ''sound'' (the properties proved on the abstraction are true of the original system); however, most often, the abstraction is not ''complete'' (not all true properties of the original system are true of the abstraction). An example of abstraction is, on a program, to ignore the values of non boolean variables and to only consider boolean variables and the control flow of the program; such an abstraction, though it may appear coarse, may in fact be sufficient to prove e.g. properties of [[mutual exclusion]].
#  Counterexample guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR) begins checking with a coarse (imprecise) abstraction and iteratively refines it. When a violation ([[counterexample]]) is found, the tool analyzes it for feasibility (i.e., is the violation genuine or the result of an incomplete abstraction?). If the violation is feasible, it is reported to the user; if it is not, the proof of infeasibility is used to refine the abstraction and checking begins again.&lt;ref name=Clarke2000&gt;{{citation

Model checking tools were initially developed to reason about the logical correctness of [[Discrete system|discrete state]] systems, but have since been extended to deal with real-time and limited forms of [[hybrid system]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1845">In the [[mathematics]] of [[social science]], and especially [[game theory]], a '''moving-knife procedure''' is a type of solution to the [[fair division]] problem. The canonical example is the division of a [[cake]] using a [[knife]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest example is a moving-knife equivalent of the [[I cut, you choose]] scheme, first described by A.K.Austin as a prelude to [[Austin moving-knife procedure|his own procedure]]:&lt;ref name=austin&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3616548| jstor = 3616548| title = Sharing a Cake| journal = The Mathematical Gazette| volume = 66| issue = 437| pages = 212| year = 1982| last1 = Austin | first1 = A. K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* One player moves the knife across the cake, conventionally from left to right.  
* The cake is cut when ''either'' player calls "stop".  
* If each player calls stop when he or she perceives the knife to be at the 50-50 point, then the first player to call stop will produce an [[envy-free]] division if the caller gets the left piece and the other player gets the right piece. 
(This procedure is not necessarily [[efficiency (economics)|efficient]].)

Generalizing this scheme to more than two players cannot be done by a discrete procedure without sacrificing envy-freeness.

Examples of moving-knife procedures include

* The [[Stromquist moving-knives procedure]]
* The [[Austin moving-knife procedures]]
* The [[Levmore–Cook moving-knives procedure]]
* The [[Robertson–Webb rotating-knife procedure]]
* The [[Dubins–Spanier moving-knife procedure]]
* The [[Webb moving-knife procedure]]

The information in real world usually comes as different modalities. For example, images are usually associated with tags and text explanations; texts contain images to more clearly express the main idea of the article. Different modalities are characterized by very different statistical properties. For instance, images are usually represented as [[pixel]] intensities or outputs of [[Feature extraction|feature extractors]], while texts are represented as discrete word count vectors. Due to the distinct statistical properties of different information resources, it is very important to discover the relationship between different modalities. '''Multimodal learning''' is a good model to represent the joint representations of different modalities. The '''multimodal learning model''' is also capable to fill missing modality given the observed ones. The multimodal learning model combines two [[Deep Boltzmann Machines|deep Boltzmann machines]] each corresponds to one modality. An additional hidden layer is placed on top of the two Boltzmann Machines to give the joint representation.

==Motivation==
A lot of models/algorithms have been implemented to retrieve and classify a certain type of data, e.g. image or text (where humans who interacts with machines can extract images in a form of pictures and text that could be any message etc). However, data usually comes with different modalities (it is the degree to which a system's components may be separated or combined) which carry different information. For example, it is very common to caption an image to convey the information not presented by this image. Similarly, sometimes it is more straightforward to use an image to describe the information which may not be obvious from texts. As a results, if some different words appear in similar images, these words are very likely used to describe the same thing. Conversely, if some words are used in different images, these images may represent the same object. Thus, it is important to invite a novel model which is able to jointly represent the information such that the model can capture the correlation structure between different modalities. Moreover, it should also be able to recover missing modalities given observed ones, e.g. predicting possible image object according to text description. The '''Multimodal Deep Boltzmann Machine model''' satisfies the above purposes.

==Background: Boltzmann machine==
A [[Boltzmann machine]] is a type of stochastic neural network invented by [[Geoffrey Hinton]] and [[Terry Sejnowski]] in 1985.  Boltzmann machines can be seen as the [[stochastic process|stochastic]], [[generative model|generative]] counterpart of [[Hopfield net]]s. They are named after the [[Boltzmann distribution]] in statistical mechanics. The units in Boltzmann machines are divided into two groups-visible units and hidden units. General Boltzmann machines allow connection between any units. However, learning is impractical using general Boltzmann Machines because the computational time is exponential to the size of the machine. A more efficient architecture is called '''[[restricted Boltzmann machine]]''' where connection is only allowed between hidden unit and visible unit, which is described in the next section.

===Restricted Boltzmann machine===
A restricted Boltzmann machine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bhiksha/courses/deeplearning/Fall.2014/pdfs/Smolensky.1986.pdf|title=Restricted Boltzmann Machine  |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is an undirected graphical model with stochastic visible variable and stochastic hidden variables. Each visible variable is connected to each hidden variable. The energy function of the model is defined as 
:&lt;math&gt; E(\mathbf v,\mathbf h;\theta) =  -\sum_{i=1}^D\sum_{j=1}^{F}W_{ij}v_ih_j -\sum_{i=1}^Db_iv_i -\sum_{j=1}^Fa_jh_j&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\theta = \{\mathbf v,\mathbf h;
\theta\}&lt;/math&gt; are model parameters: &lt;math&gt;W_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; represents the symmetric interaction term between visible unit &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and hidden unit &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_j&lt;/math&gt; are bias terms. The joint distribution of the system is defined as 
:&lt;math&gt; P(\mathbf{v};\theta) = \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}(\theta)}\sum_{\mathbf h}\mathrm{exp}(-E(\mathbf v,\mathbf h;\theta)) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z}(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is a normalizing constant.
The conditional distribution over hidden &lt;math&gt;\mathbf h&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf v &lt;/math&gt; can be derived as logistic function in terms of model parameters.
:&lt;math&gt;P(\mathbf h|\mathbf v;\theta) = \prod_{j=1}^Fp(h_j|\mathbf v)&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;p(h_j=1|\mathbf v) = g(\sum_{i=1}^DW_{ij}v_i + a_j)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P(\mathbf v|\mathbf h;\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^Dp(v_i|\mathbf v)&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;p(v_i=1|\mathbf h) = g(\sum_{j=1}^FW_{ij}h_j + b_i)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;g(x) = \frac{1}{(1+\mathrm{exp}(-x))}&lt;/math&gt; is the logistic function.
 
The derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to the model parameters can be decomposed as the difference between the ''model's expectation'' and ''data-dependent expectation''.

===Gaussian-Bernoulli RBM===
'''Gaussian-Bernoulli RBMs'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~yfreund/papers/freund94unsupervised.pdf|title=Gaussian-Bernoulli RBM  |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  are a variant of restricted Boltzmann machine used for modeling real-valued vectors such as pixel intensities. It is usually used to model the image data. The energy of the system of the Gaussian-Bernoulli RBM is defined as 
:&lt;math&gt; E(\mathbf v,\mathbf h;\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^D\frac{(v_i-b_i)^2}{2\sigma_i^2} -\sum_{i=1}^D\sum_{j=1}^{F}\frac{v_i}{\sigma_i}W_{ij}v_ih_j -\sum_{i=1}^Db_iv_i -\sum_{j=1}^Fa_jh_j&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\theta = \{\mathbf a,\mathbf b,\mathbf w,\mathbf \sigma\}&lt;/math&gt; are the model parameters. The joint distribution is defined the same as the one in [[#Restricted Boltzmann machine|restricted Boltzmann machine]]. The conditional distributions now become 
:&lt;math&gt;P(\mathbf h|\mathbf v;\theta) = \prod_{j=1}^Fp(h_j|\mathbf v)&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;p(h_j=1|\mathbf v) = g(\sum_{i=1}^DW_{ij}\frac{v_i}{\sigma_i} + a_j)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P(\mathbf v|\mathbf h;\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^Dp(v_i|\mathbf h)&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;p(v_i|\mathbf h) \sim \mathcal{N}(\sigma_i\sum_{j=1}^FW_{ij}h_j + b_i,\sigma_i^2)&lt;/math&gt;
In Gaussian-Bernoulli RBM, the visible unit conditioned on hidden units is modeled as a Gaussian distribution.

===Replicated Softmax Model===
The '''Replicated Softmax Model'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3856-replicated-softmax-an-undirected-topic-model.pdf|title=Replicated Softmax Model  |year=2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also an variant of restricted Boltzmann machine and commonly used to model word count vectors in a document. In a typical text mining problem, let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be the dictionary size, and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be the number of words in the document. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf V&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;M \times K&lt;/math&gt; binary matrix with &lt;math&gt;v_{ik} = 1&lt;/math&gt; only when the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; word in the document is the &lt;math&gt;k^{th}&lt;/math&gt; word in the dictionary. &lt;math&gt;\hat v_k&lt;/math&gt; denotes the count for the &lt;math&gt;k^{th}&lt;/math&gt; word in the dictionary. The energy of the state &lt;math&gt;\{\mathbf V,\mathbf h\}&lt;/math&gt; for a document contains &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; words is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;E(\mathbf V,\mathbf h) = -\sum_{j=1}^{F}\sum_{k=1}^{K}W_{jk}\hat v_kh_j - \sum_{k=1}^Kb_k\hat v_k - M\sum_{j=1}^{F}a_jh_j&lt;/math&gt;
The conditional distributions are given by 
:&lt;math&gt;p(h_j=1|\mathbf V) = g(Ma_j + \sum_{k=1}^K\hat v_kW_{jk})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p(v_{ik} = 1|\mathbf h) = \frac{\mathrm{exp}(b_k + \sum_{j=1}^Fh_jW_{jk}}{\sum_{q=1}^{K}\mathrm{exp}(b_q + \sum_{j=1}^Fh_jW_{jq}})&lt;/math&gt;

==Deep Boltzmann machines==
A '''deep Boltzmann machine'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utstat.toronto.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/dbm.pdf|title=Deep Boltzmann Machine |year=2009b}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a sequence of layers of hidden units.There are only connections between adjacent hidden layers, as well as between visible units and hidden units in the first hidden layer. The energy function of the system adds layer interaction terms to the energy function of general restricted Boltzmann machine and is defined by 
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
E({\mathbf v, \mathbf h; \theta} )  = &amp; -\sum_{i=1}^D\sum_{j=1}^{F_1}W_{ij}^{(1)}v_ih_j^{(1)} -\sum_{j=1}^{F_1}\sum_{l=1}^{F_2}W_{jl}^{(2)}h_j^{(1)}h_{l}^{(2)}\\ 
&amp; -\sum_{l=1}^{F_2}\sum_{p=1}^{F_3}W_{lp}^{(3)}h_l^{(2)}h_p^{(3)}
 - \sum_{i = 1}^Db_iv_i - \sum_{j=1}^{F_1}b_j^{(1)}h_j^{(1)} - \sum_{l=1}^{F_2}b_l^{(2)}h_l^{(2)} - \sum_{p=1}^{F_3}b_p^{(3)}h_p^{(3)}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The joint distribution is 
:&lt;math&gt;P(\mathbf{v};\theta) = \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}(\theta)}\sum_{\mathbf h}\mathrm{exp}(-E(\mathbf v,\mathbf h^{(1)},\mathbf h^{(2)},\mathbf h^{(3)};\theta))&lt;/math&gt;

==Multimodal deep Boltzmann machines==
'''Multimodal deep Boltzmann machine'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4683-multimodal-learning-with-deep-boltzmann-machines.pdf|title=Multimodal Learning with Deep Boltzmann Machine  |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume15/srivastava14b/srivastava14b.pdf|title=Multimodal Learning with Deep Boltzmann Machine  |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses an image-text bi-modal DBM where the image pathway is modeled as Gaussian-Bernoulli DBM and text pathway as Replicated Softmax DBM, and each DBM has two hidden layers and one visible layer. The two DBMs join together at an additional top hidden layer. The joint distribution over the multi-modal inputs defined as 
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P(\mathbf v^m,\mathbf v^t;\theta) &amp; =  \sum_{\mathbf h^{(2m)},\mathbf h^{(2t)},\mathbf h^{(3)}}P(\mathbf h^{(2m)},\mathbf h^{(2t)},\mathbf h^{(3)})(\sum_{\mathbf h^{(1m)}}P(\mathbf v_m,\mathbf h^{(1m)}|\mathbf h^{(2m)}))(\sum_{\mathbf h^{(1t)}}P(\mathbf v^t,\mathbf h^{(1t)}|\mathbf h^{(2t)}))\\
&amp; =  \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}_M(\theta)}\sum_{\mathbf h}\mathrm{exp}(\sum_{kj}W_{kj}^{(1t)}v_k^th_j^{(1t)} \\
&amp;+ \sum_{jl}W_{jl}^{(2t)}h_j^{(1t)}h_l^{(2t)}+\sum_kb_k^tv_k^t+M\sum_jb_j^{(1t)}h_j^{(1t)}+\sum_lb_l^{(2t)}h_l^{(2t)}\\
&amp; -  \sum_i\frac{(v_i^m-b_i^m)^2}{2\sigma^2} + \sum_{ij}\frac{v_i^m}{\sigma_i}W_{ij}^{(1m)}h_j^{(1m)} \\
&amp;+ \sum_{jl}W_{jl}^{(2m)}h_j^{(1m)}h_l^{(2m)}+\sum_jb_j^{(1m)}h_j^{(1m)}+\sum_lb_l^{(2m)}h_l{(2m)}\\
&amp; + \sum_{lp}W^{(3t)}h_l^{(2t)}h_p^{(3)} + \sum_{lp}W^{(3m)}h_l^{(2m)}h_p^{(3)} + \sum_pb_p^{(3)}h_p^{(3)}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The conditional distributions over the visible and hidden units are 
:&lt;math&gt;p(h_j^{(1m)}=1|\mathbf v^m,\mathbf h^{(2m)}) =  g(\sum_{i=1}^DW_{ij}^{(1m)}\frac{v_i^m}{\sigma_i} + \sum_{l=1}^{F_2^m}W_{jl}^{(2m)}h_l^{(2m)}+b_j^{(1m)})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p(h_l^{(2m)}=1|\mathbf h^{(1m)},\mathbf h^{(3)})  =  g(\sum_{j=1}^{F_1^m}W_{jl}^{(2m)}h_j^{(1m)} + \sum_{p=1}^{F_3}W_{lp}^{(3m)}h_p^{(3)}+b_l^{(2m)})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p(h_j^{(1t)}=1|\mathbf v^t,\mathbf h^{(2t)})  =  g(\sum_{k=1}^{K}W_{kl}^{(1t)}v_k^{(t)} + \sum_{l=1}^{F_2^t}W_{jl}^{(2t)}h_l^{(2t)}+Mb_j^{(1t)})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p(h_l^{(2t)}=1|\mathbf h^{(1t)},\mathbf h^{(3)})  =  g(\sum_{j=1}^{F_1^t}W_{jl}^{(2t)}h_j^{(1t)} + \sum_{p=1}^{F_3}W_{lp}^{(3t)}h_p^{(3)}+b_l^{(2t)})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p(h_p^{3)}=1|\mathbf h^{(2)})  =  g(\sum_{l=1}^{F_2^m}W_{lp}^{(3m)}h_l^{(2m)} + \sum_{l=1}^{F_2^t}W_{lp}^{(3t)}h_l^{(2t)}+b_p^{(3)})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p(v_{ik}^t = 1|\mathbf h^{(1t)})  =  \frac{\mathrm{exp}(\sum_{j=1}^{F_1^t}h_j^{(1t)}W_{jk}^{(1t)} + b_k^t)}{\sum_{q=1}^K\mathrm{exp}(\sum_{j=1}^{F_1^t}h_j^{(1t)}W_{jq}^{(1t)} + b_k^t)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p(v_i^m|\mathbf h^{(1m)})  \sim  \mathcal{N}(\sigma_i\sum_{j=1}^{F_1^m}W_{ij}^{(1m)}h_j^{(1m)} + b_i^m,\sigma_i^2)&lt;/math&gt;

===Inference and learning===
Exact maximum likelihood learning in this model is intractable, but approximate learning of DBMs can be carried out by using a variational approach, where mean-field inference is used to estimate data-dependent expectations and an MCMC based stochastic approximation procedure is used to approximate the model’s expected sufficient statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://icml2008.cs.helsinki.fi/papers/638.pdf
|title= Approximations to the Likelihood Gradient  |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Multimodal deep Boltzmann machines is successfully used in classification and missing data retrieval. The classification accuracy of multimodal deep Boltzmann machine outperforms [[support vector machine]]s, [[latent Dirichlet allocation]] and [[deep belief network]], when models are tested on data with both image-text modalities or with single modality. Multimodal deep Boltzmann machine is also able to predict the missing modality given the observed ones with reasonably good precision.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5261">In [[combinatorics]], the '''Narayana numbers''' ''N''(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''k''), ''n'' = 1, 2, 3 ..., 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''n'', form a [[triangular array]] of [[natural number]]s, called '''Narayana triangle,''' that occur in various [[Combinatorial enumeration|counting problems]]. They are named after [[Canadian ]][[mathematician]] [[Tadepalli Venkata Narayana|T. V. Narayana]] (1930–1987).

== Formula ==
The Narayana numbers can be expressed in terms of [[binomial coefficient]]s:

: &lt;math&gt;N(n,k) = \frac{1}{n}{n\choose k}{n\choose k-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Numerical values ==
The first eight rows of the Narayana triangle read:

 ''k'' =      1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
 ''n'' = 1    1
     2    1   1
     3    1   3   1
     4    1   6   6   1

     8    1  28 196 490 490 196  28   1

{{OEIS|id=A001263}}

== Combinatorial interpretations ==
An example of a counting problem whose solution can be given in terms of the Narayana numbers ''N''(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''k''), is the number of expressions containing ''n'' pairs of parentheses, which are correctly matched and which contain ''k'' distinct nestings. For instance, ''N''(4,&amp;nbsp;2) = 6 as with four pairs of parentheses six sequences can be created which each contain two times the sub-pattern '()':

 ()((()))  (())(())  (()(()))  ((()()))  ((())())  ((()))()

From this example it should be obvious that ''N''(''n'',&amp;nbsp;1) = 1, since the only way to get a single sub-pattern '()' is to have all the opening parentheses in the first n positions, followed by all the closing parentheses. Also ''N''(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''n'') = 1, as distinct nestings can be achieved only by the repetitive pattern ()()() ... (). More generally, it can be shown that the Narayana triangle is symmetric: ''N''(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''k'') = ''N''(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''1'').

The sum of the rows in this triangle equal the [[Catalan numbers]]:

:&lt;math&gt;N(n,1) + N(n,2) + N(n,3) + \cdots + N(n,n) = C_n.&lt;/math&gt;

To illustrate this relationship, the Narayana numbers also count the number of paths from (0,&amp;nbsp;0) to (2''n'',&amp;nbsp;0), with steps only northeast and southeast, not straying below the ''x''-axis, with ''k'' peaks.

The following figures represent the Narayana numbers ''N''(4,&amp;nbsp;''k''):

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ''N''(4,&amp;nbsp;''k'')
! Paths
|-
| ''N''(4,&amp;nbsp;1) = '''1''' path with 1 peak:

|-

The sum of ''N''(4,&amp;nbsp;''k'') is 1 + 6 + 6 + 1, or 14, which is the same as Catalan number ''C''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. This sum coincides with the interpretation of Catalan numbers as the number of monotonic paths along the edges of an ''n'' × ''n'' grid that do not pass above the diagonal.

== Partitions ==
[[File:Noncrossing partitions 4; Hasse.svg|thumb|The 1,6,6,1 [[noncrossing partition]]s with 1,2,3,4 blocks of a 4-element set]]
In the study of partitions, we see that in a set containing '''n''' elements, we may partition that set in &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt; different ways, where &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt; is the '''n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;''' [[Bell number]].  Furthermore, the number of ways to partition a set into exactly '''k''' blocks we use the [[Stirling numbers of the second kind|Stirling number]]s &lt;math&gt;S(n,k)&lt;/math&gt;.  Both of these concepts are a bit off-topic, but a necessary foundation for understanding the use of the Narayana numbers.  In both of the above two notions crossing partitions are accounted for.

To reject the crossing partitions and count only the [[noncrossing partition]]s, we may use the [[Catalan number]]s to count the non-crossing partitions of all '''n''' elements of the set, &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt;.  To count the non-crossing partitions in which the set is partitioned in exactly '''k''' blocks, we use the Narayana number &lt;math&gt;N(n,k)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Generating function ==
The generating function of the Narayana numbers is{{sfn|Petersen|2015|p=25}}
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^n N(n,k) z^n t^{k-1} = \frac{1+z(t-1) - \sqrt{1-2z(t+1)+z^2(t-1)^2}}{2z} \;.
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- Petersen is indexing the k from 0 to n-1 --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="808">In mathematics, especially in [[topology]], a [[topological group]] ''G'' is said to have '''no small subgroup''' if there exists a neighborhood ''U'' of the identity that contains no nontrivial subgroup of ''G''. An abbreviation '"NSS"' is sometimes used. A basic example of a topological group with no small subgroup is the [[general linear group]] over the complex numbers.

A locally compact, separable metric, [[locally connected space|locally connected]] group with no small subgroup is a [[Lie group]]. (cf. [[Hilbert's fifth problem]].)

"Pre-math skills" (referred to in [[British English]] as '''pre-maths skills''') is a term used in some countries to refer to math skills learned by [[preschool]]ers and [[kindergarten]] students, including learning to count [[number]]s (usually from 1 to 10 but occasionally including 0), learning the proper sequencing of numbers, learning to determine which [[shape]]s are bigger or smaller, and learning to count objects on a screen or book. Pre-math skills are also tied into [[literacy]] skills to learn the correct pronunciations of numbers.

[[File:Pulse evaluation.JPG|thumb|Pulse evaluation at the radial artery.]]
[[File:2110 Pulse Sites.jpg|thumb|Recommended points to evaluate pulse]]
In [[medicine]], a '''pulse''' represents the tactile [[arterial]] [[palpation]] of the [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]] by trained fingertips. The pulse may be palpated in any place that allows an [[artery]] to be compressed near the surface of the body, such as at the [[neck]] ([[carotid artery]]), [[wrist]] ([[radial artery]]), at the [[groin]] ([[femoral artery]]), behind the [[knee]] ([[popliteal artery]]), near the [[ankle joint]] ([[posterior tibial artery]]), and on foot ([[dorsalis pedis artery]]). Pulse (or the count of arterial pulse per minute) is equivalent to measuring the heart rate. The heart rate can also be measured by listening to the heart beat by [[auscultation]], traditionally using a [[stethoscope]] and counting it for a minute. The radial pulse is commonly measured using three fingers. This has a reason: the finger closest to the heart is used to occlude the pulse pressure, the middle finger is used get a crude estimate of the blood pressure, and the finger most distal to the heart (usually the ring finger)  is used to nullify the effect of the ulnar pulse as the two arteries are connected via the palmar arches ([[Superficial palmar arch|superficial]] and [[Deep palmar arch|deep]]). 
The study of the pulse is known as sphygmology.

== Physiology ==
Claudius [[Galen]] was perhaps the first [[physiologist]] to describe the pulse.&lt;ref&gt;Temkin 165;BBC[a]&lt;/ref&gt;  The pulse is an expedient [[Touch|tactile]] method of determination of [[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] [[blood pressure]] to a trained observer. [[Diastolic]] [[blood pressure]] is non-palpable and unobservable by tactile methods, occurring between heartbeats.

[[Pressure wave]]s generated by the heart in [[Systole (medicine)|systole]] move the arterial walls. Forward movement of [[blood]] occurs when the boundaries are pliable and compliant. These properties form enough to create a palpable pressure wave.

{{Anchor|Pulse deficit}} The [[heart rate]] may be greater or lesser than the [[pulse rate]] depending upon physiologic demand. In this case, the heart rate is determined by [[auscultation]] or audible [[sounds]] at the heart apex, in which case it is not the pulse. The ''pulse deficit'' (difference between heart beats and pulsations at the periphery) is determined by simultaneous [[palpation]] at the [[radial artery]] and auscultation [[apex beat|at the PMI, near the heart apex]]. It may be present in case of [[Premature ventricular contraction|premature beats]] or [[atrial fibrillation]].

Pulse velocity, pulse deficits and much more physiologic data are readily and simplistically visualized by the use of one or more [[arterial catheter]]s connected to a [[transducer]] and [[oscilloscope]]. This invasive technique has been commonly used in [[intensive care]] since the 1970s.

The rate of the pulse is observed and measured by tactile or visual means on the outside of an artery and is recorded as beats per minute or BPM.

The pulse may be further indirectly observed under [[light]] absorbances of varying wavelengths with assigned and inexpensively reproduced mathematical ratios. Applied capture of variances of light signal from the [[blood]] component [[hemoglobin]] under oxygenated vs. deoxygenated conditions allows the technology of [[pulse oximetry]].

==Characteristics of pulse==

===Rate===
{{main|Heart rate}}
Normal pulse rates [[Heart rate#At rest|at rest]], in beats per minute (BPM):&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003399.htm U.S. Department of Health and Human Services - National Ites of Health] Pulse&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

The pulse rate can be used to check overall heart health and fitness level. Generally lower is better, but [[bradycardia]]s can be dangerous. Symptoms of a dangerously slow heartbeat include weakness, loss of energy and fainting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pulse Rate Measurement|url=http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/pulse-measurement|work=Healthwise|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhythm===
A normal pulse is regular in rhythm and force. An irregular pulse may be due to [[sinus arrhythmia]], [[ectopic beats]], [[atrial fibrillation]], [[Paroxysmal Atrial Tachycardia|paroxysmal atrial tachycardia]], [[atrial flutter]], [[Second-degree atrioventricular block|partial heart block]] etc. Intermittent dropping out of beats at pulse is called "intermittent pulse". Examples of ''regular'' intermittent (regularly irregular) pulse include [[pulsus bigeminus]], [[second-degree atrioventricular block]]. An example of ''irregular'' intermittent (irregularly irregular) pulse is [[atrial fibrillation]].

===Volume===
The degree of expansion displayed by artery during diastolic and systolic state is called volume. It is also known as amplitude, expansion or size of pulse.

====Hypokinetic pulse====
A weak pulse signifies narrow [[pulse pressure]]. It may be due to low [[cardiac output]] (as seen in [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], [[congestive cardiac failure]]), [[hypovolemia]], [[valvular heart disease]] (such as [[aortic stenosis|aortic outflow tract obstruction]], [[mitral stenosis]], [[aortic arch syndrome]]) etc.

====Hyperkinetic pulse====
A bounding pulse signifies high pulse pressure. It may be due to low [[peripheral resistance]] (as seen in [[fever]], [[anemia]], [[thyrotoxicosis]], {{Interlanguage link multi|hyperkinetic heart syndrome|de|3=hyperkinetisches Herzsyndrom}}, [[Arteriovenous fistula|A-V fistula]], [[Paget's disease of bone|Paget's disease]], [[beriberi]], [[liver cirrhosis]]), increased cardiac output, increased [[stroke volume]] (as seen in anxiety, exercise, [[complete heart block]], [[aortic regurgitation]]), decreased distensibility of arterial system (as seen in [[atherosclerosis]], [[hypertension]] and [[coarctation of aorta]]).

The strength of the pulse can also be reported:&lt;ref name="urlwww.meddean.luc.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/Medicine/pulmonar/pd/step5b.htm |title=www.meddean.luc.edu |work=|accessdate=2009-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlVascular Surgery, University of Kansas School of Medicine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kumc.edu/vsurg/eval.htm |title=Vascular Surgery, University of Kansas School of Medicine |work=|accessdate=2009-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 0 = Absent
* 1 = Barely palpable
* 2 = Easily palpable
* 3 = Full
* 4 = Aneurysmal or [[bounding pulse]]

===Force===
Also known as compressibility of pulse. It is a rough measure of [[systolic blood pressure]].

===Tension===
It corresponds to [[diastolic blood pressure]]. A low tension pulse (pulsus mollis), the vessel is soft or impalpable between beats. In high tension pulse (pulsus durus), vessels feel rigid even between pulse beats.

===Form===
A form or contour of a pulse is palpatiory estimation of [[arteriogram]]. A quickly rising and quickly falling pulse (pulsus celer) is seen in aortic regurgitation. A slow rising and slowly falling pulse (pulsus tardus) is seen in aortic stenosis.

===Equality===
Comparing pulses and different places gives valuable clinical information.

A discrepant or unequal pulse between left and right radial artery is observed in anomalous or aberrant course of artery, coarctation of aorta, [[aortitis]], [[dissecting aneurysm]], [[peripheral embolism]] etc. An unequal pulse between upper and lower extremities is seen in coarctation to aorta, aortitis, block at [[Aortic bifurcation|bifurcation of aorta]], [[dissection of aorta]], [[iatrogenic]] trauma and [[arteriosclerotic]] obstruction.

===Condition of arterial wall===
A normal artery is not palpable after flattening by [[Finger|digital]] pressure. A thick radial artery which is palpable 7.5–10&amp;nbsp;cm up the forearm is suggestive of arteriosclerosis.

===Radio-femoral delay===
In coarctation of aorta, femoral pulse may be significantly delayed as compared to radial pulse (unless there is coexisting aortic regurgitation). The delay can also be observed in [[supravalvar aortic stenosis]].

==Patterns==
Several pulse patterns can be of clinically significance. These include:
* Dicrotic pulse: is characterized by two beats per cardiac cycle, one systolic and the other diastolic.  Physiologically, the dicrotic wave is the result of reflected waves from the lower extremities and aorta. Conditions associated with low cardiac output and high systemic vascular resistance can produce a dicrotic pulse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dennis|first1=Mark|last2=Bowen|first2=William Talbot|last3=Cho|first3=Lucy|title=Mechanisms of Clinical Signs - EPub3|date=2016|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780729585613|page=177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2lj_DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA177|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McGee2016&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGee|first1=Steven|title=Evidence-Based Physical Diagnosis E-Book|date=2016|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780323508711|pages=105-106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k_sTDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA105|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pulsus alternans]]: an ominous medical sign that indicates progressive systolic heart failure. To trained fingertips, the examiner notes a pattern of a strong pulse followed by a weak pulse over and over again. This pulse signals a flagging effort of the heart to sustain itself in systole.
* [[Pulsus bigeminus]]: indicates a pair of hoofbeats within each heartbeat. Concurrent [[auscultation]] of the heart may reveal a [[gallop rhythm]] of the native heartbeat.
* [[Pulsus bisferiens]]: is characterized by two beats per cadiac cycle, both systolic, unlike the dicrotic pulse. It's an unusual physical finding typically seen in patients with aortic valve diseases if the aortic valve does not normally open and close. Trained fingertips will observe two pulses to each heartbeat instead of one.
* ''Pulsus tardus et parvus'', also ''pulsus parvus et tardus'', slow-rising pulse and anacrotic pulse, is weak (parvus), and late (tardus) relative to its expected characteristics. It is caused by a stiffened aortic valve that makes it progressively harder to open, thus requiring increased generation of blood pressure in the left ventricle.  It is seen in [[aortic valve stenosis]].&lt;ref name=McGee2016/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17384038"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Li JC, Yuan Y, Qin W, etal |title=Evaluation of the tardus-parvus pattern in patients with atherosclerotic and nonatherosclerotic renal artery stenosis |journal=J Ultrasound Med |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=419–26 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17384038 |doi= |url=http://www.jultrasoundmed.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17384038}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CFIM"&gt;Toy, Eugene, et al.

* [[Pulsus paradoxus]]: a condition in which some heartbeats cannot be detected at the radial artery during the inspiration phase of respiration. It is caused by an exaggerated decrease in blood pressure during this phase, and is diagnostic of a variety of cardiac and respiratory conditions of varying urgency.
* [[Tachycardia]]: an elevated resting heart rate. In general an [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) is required to identify the type of tachycardia.
* [[Pulsatile]] This description of the pulse implies the intrinsic physiology of [[Systole (medicine)|systole]] and [[diastole]]. Scientifically, systole and diastole are [[force]]s that expand and contract the pulmonary and systemic circulations.
*A collapsing pulse is a sign of [[hyperdynamic circulation]].

== Common palpable sites ==
{{anchor|Sites|Pulse sites}}

===Upper limb===
[[Image:Gray1235.png|thumb|Front of right upper extremity]]
*'''Axillary pulse''': located inferiorly of the lateral wall of the [[axilla]]
*'''Brachial pulse''': located on the inside of the upper arm near the elbow, frequently used in place of carotid pulse in infants ([[brachial artery]])
*'''Radial pulse''': located on the lateral of the wrist ([[radial artery]]).   It can also be found in the [[anatomical snuff box]].
*'''Ulnar pulse''': located on the medial of the wrist ([[ulnar artery]]).
[[Culture of China|Chinese]] medicine has focused on the pulse in the upper limbs for several centuries. The concept of [[pulse diagnosis]] is essentially based on palpation and observations of the radial and ulnar volar pulses at the readily accessible wrist.

===Lower limb===
*'''[[Femoral pulse]]''': located in the inner thigh, at the mid-inguinal point, halfway between the pubic symphysis and anterior superior iliac spine ([[femoral artery]]).
*'''Popliteal pulse''': Above the knee in the popliteal fossa, found by holding the bent knee. The patient bends the knee at approximately 124°, and the physician holds it in both hands to find the popliteal artery in the pit behind the knee ([[Popliteal artery]]).
*'''Dorsalis pedis pulse''': located on top of the foot, immediately lateral to the extensor of hallucis longus ([[dorsalis pedis artery]]).
*'''Tibialis posterior pulse''': located on the medial side of the ankle, 2&amp;nbsp;cm inferior and 2&amp;nbsp;cm posterior to the medial malleolus ([[posterior tibial artery]]). It is easily palpable over [[Pimenta's Point]].

===Head and neck===
[[Image:Gray513.png|thumb|Arteries of the neck.]]
*'''[[Carotid pulse]]''': located in the neck ([[carotid artery]]). The carotid artery should be palpated gently and while the patient is sitting or lying down. Stimulating its baroreceptors with low palpitation can provoke severe [[bradycardia]] or even stop the heart in some sensitive persons. Also, a person's two carotid arteries should not be palpated at the same time. Doing so may limit the flow of blood to the head, possibly leading to [[fainting]] or brain [[ischemia]].  It can be felt between the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, above the hyoid bone and lateral to the thyroid cartilage.
*'''Facial pulse''': located on the mandible (lower jawbone) on a line with the corners of the mouth ([[facial artery]]).
*'''Temporal pulse''': located on the [[Temple (anatomy)|temple]] directly in front of the ear ([[superficial temporal artery]]).

Although the pulse can be felt in multiple places in the head, people should not normally hear their heartbeats within the head.  This is called [[pulsatile tinnitus]], and it can indicate several medical disorders.

===Torso===
*'''Apical pulse''': located in the 5th left intercostal space, 1.25&amp;nbsp;cm lateral to the [[mid-clavicular line]]. In contrast with other pulse sites, the apical pulse site is unilateral, and measured not under an artery, but below the [[heart]] itself (more specifically, the apex of the heart). See also [[apex beat]].

==History==
The first person to accurately measure the pulse rate was [[Santorio Santorii]] who invented the ''pulsilogium'', a form of [[pendulum]], based on the work by [[Galileo Galilei]]. A century later another physician, [[François Boissier de Sauvages de Lacroix|de Lacroix]], used the pulsilogium to test cardiac function.

In March 2008, physicists at [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] described an experimental quantum logic clock based on individual [[ion]]s of [[beryllium (element)|beryllium]] and [[aluminium]]. This clock was compared to NIST's [[mercury (element)|mercury]] ion clock. These were the most accurate clocks that had been constructed, with neither clock gaining nor losing time at a rate that would exceed a second in over a billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Swenson|first1=Gayle|title=Press release: NIST 'Quantum Logic Clock' Rivals Mercury Ion as World's Most Accurate Clock|url=https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2008/03/nist-quantum-logic-clock-rivals-mercury-ion-worlds-most-accurate-clock-0|publisher=NIST|language=en|date=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, NIST physicists described a second, enhanced version of the quantum logic clock based on individual [[ion]]s of [[magnesium]] and [[aluminium]]. Considered the world's most precise clock in 2010 with a fractional frequency inaccuracy of {{nowrap|8.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt;}}, it offers more than twice the precision of the original.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/physlab/div847/logicclock_020410.cfm NIST's Second 'Quantum Logic Clock' Based on Aluminum Ion is Now World's Most Precise Clock], NIST, 4 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of [[standard deviation]], the quantum logic clock deviates one second every 3.68 billion ({{nowrap|3.68 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;}}) years, while the then current international standard NIST-F1 [[caesium fountain]] atomic clock uncertainty was about 3.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−16&lt;/sup&gt; expected to neither gain nor lose a second in more than 100 million ({{nowrap|100 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;}}) years.&lt;ref&gt;

==More accurate experimental clocks==
The accuracy of quantum clocks has since been superseded by [[Atomic clock#Optical clocks|optical lattice clocks]] based on [[Isotopes of strontium|strontium-87]] and [[ytterbium-171]]. An experimental optical lattice clock was described in a 2014 Nature paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = An optical lattice clock with accuracy and stability at the 10−18 level|date = 22 January 2014|journal = Nature|volume = 506|issue = 7486|pages = 71–5|accessdate = |doi = 10.1038/nature12941|pmid = 24463513|arxiv = 1309.1137 |bibcode = 2014Natur.506...71B |last1 = Bloom|first1 = B.

In 2015 [[JILA]] evaluated the absolute frequency uncertainty of their latest [[Isotopes of strontium|strontium-87]] optical lattice clock at {{nowrap|2.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which corresponds to a measurable [[gravitational time dilation]] for an elevation change of {{convert|2|cm|abbr=on}} on planet Earth that according to JILA/NIST Fellow [[Jun Ye]] is "getting really close to being useful for relativistic [[geodesy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13566">In [[mathematics]], '''quasi-isometry''' is an [[equivalence relation]] on [[metric space]]s that ignores their small-scale details in favor of their [[coarse structure]]. The concept is especially important in [[geometric group theory]] following the work of [[Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov|Gromov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Martin R.|last=Bridson|authorlink=Martin Bridson|contribution=Geometric and combinatorial group theory|pages=431–448|title=[[The Princeton Companion to Mathematics]]|editor1-first=Timothy|editor1-last=Gowers|editor1-link=Timothy Gowers|editor2-first=June|editor2-last=Barrow-Green|editor3-first=Imre|editor3-last=Leader|editor3-link=Imre Leader|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-11880-2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Equilateral_Triangle_Lattice.svg|thumb|350px|This [[lattice (group)|lattice]] is quasi-isometric to the plane.]]

==Definition==
Suppose that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a (not necessarily continuous) function from one metric space &lt;math&gt;(M_1,d_1)&lt;/math&gt; to a second metric space &lt;math&gt;(M_2,d_2)&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''quasi-isometry'' from &lt;math&gt;(M_1,d_1)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(M_2,d_2)&lt;/math&gt; if there exist constants &lt;math&gt;A\ge 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B\ge 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; such that the following two properties both hold:&lt;ref name= "Topics" &gt;P. de la Harpe, ''Topics in geometric group theory''. Chicago Lectures in Mathematics. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL, 2000. {{isbn|0-226-31719-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#For every two points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt;, the distance between their images is (up to the additive constant &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;) within a factor of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of their original distance. More formally:
#:&lt;math&gt;\forall x,y\in M_1: \frac{1}{A}\; d_1(x,y)-B\leq d_2(f(x),f(y))\leq A\; d_1(x,y)+B.&lt;/math&gt;
#Every point of &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; is within the constant distance &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of an image point. More formally:
#:&lt;math&gt;\forall z\in M_2:\exists x\in M_1: d_2(z,f(x))\le C.&lt;/math&gt;

The two metric spaces &lt;math&gt;(M_1,d_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(M_2,d_2)&lt;/math&gt; are called '''quasi-isometric''' if there exists a quasi-isometry &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;(M_1,d_1)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(M_2,d_2)&lt;/math&gt;.

A map is called a '''quasi-isometric embedding''' if it satisfies the first condition but not necessarily the second (i.e. it is coarsely [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz]] but may fail to be coarsely surjective).

==Examples==
The map between the [[Euclidean plane]] and the plane with the [[Manhattan distance]] that sends every point to itself is a quasi-isometry: in it, distances are multiplied by a factor of at most &lt;math&gt;\sqrt 2&lt;/math&gt;.

The map &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{Z}^n\mapsto\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; (both with the [[Euclidean metric]]) that sends every &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-tuple of integers to itself is a quasi-isometry: distances are preserved exactly, and every real tuple is within distance &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n/4}&lt;/math&gt; of an integer tuple. In the other direction, the discontinuous function that [[Rounding|rounds]] every tuple of real numbers to the nearest integer tuple is also a quasi-isometry: each point is taken by this map to a point within distance &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n/4}&lt;/math&gt; of it, so rounding changes the distance between pairs of points by adding or subtracting at most &lt;math&gt;2\sqrt{n/4}&lt;/math&gt;.

Every pair of finite or bounded metric spaces is quasi-isometric. In this case, every function from one space to the other is a quasi-isometry.

==Equivalence relation==
If &lt;math&gt;f:M_1\mapsto M_2&lt;/math&gt; is a quasi-isometry, then there exists a quasi-isometry &lt;math&gt;g:M_2\mapsto M_1&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; may be defined by letting &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; be any point in the image of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; that is within distance &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and letting &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; be any point in &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the [[identity function|identity map]] is a quasi-isometry, and the [[functional composition|composition]] of two quasi-isometries is a quasi-isometry, it follows that the relation of being quasi-isometric is an [[equivalence relation]] on the class of metric spaces.

==Use in geometric group theory==
Given a finite [[generating set of a group|generating set]] ''S'' of a finitely generated [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'', we can form the corresponding [[Cayley graph]] of ''S'' and ''G''. This graph becomes a metric space if we declare the length of each edge to be 1. Taking a different finite generating set ''T'' results in a different graph and a different metric space, however the two spaces are quasi-isometric.&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Sher and R.J. Daverman (2002), ''Handbook of Geometric Topology'', North-Holland. {{isbn|0-444-82432-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This quasi-isometry class is thus an [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] of the group ''G''. Any property of metric spaces that only depends on a space's quasi-isometry class immediately yields another invariant of groups, opening the field of group theory to geometric methods.

More generally, the '''[[Švarc–Milnor lemma]]''' states that if a group ''G'' acts [[Properly discontinuous action|properly discontinuously]] with compact quotient on a proper geodesic space ''X'' then ''G'' is quasi-isometric to ''X'' (meaning that any Cayley graph for ''G'' is). This gives new examples of groups quasi-isometric to each other: 
* If ''G' '' is a subgroup of finite [[Index of a subgroup|index]] in ''G'' then ''G' '' is quasi-isometric to ''G''; 
* If ''G'' and ''H'' are the fundamental groups of two compact [[hyperbolic manifold]]s of the same dimension ''d'' then they are both quasi-isometric to the hyperbolic space '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; and hence to each other; on the other hand there are infinitely many quasi-isometry classes of fundamental groups of finite-volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | ref=harv | last=Schwartz | first=Richard | title=The Quasi-Isometry Classification of Rank One Lattices | journal=I.H.E.S. Publications Mathematiques | date=1995 | volume=82 | pages=133&amp;ndash;168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quasigeodesics and the Morse lemma ==

A ''quasi-geodesic'' in a metric space &lt;math&gt;(X, d)&lt;/math&gt; is a quasi-isometric embedding of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. More precisely a map &lt;math&gt;\phi: \mathbb R \to X&lt;/math&gt; such that there exists &lt;math&gt;C,K &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; so that 
:&lt;math&gt;\forall s, t \in \mathbb R : C^{-1} |s - t| - K \le d(\phi(t), \phi(s)) \le C|s - t| + K&lt;/math&gt;
is called a &lt;math&gt;(C,K)&lt;/math&gt;-quasi-geodesic. Obviously geodesics (parametrised by arclength) are quasi-geodesics. The fact that in some spaces the converse is coarsely true, i.e. that every quasi-geodesic stays within bounded distance of a true geodesic, is called the ''Morse Lemma'' (not to be confused with the perhaps more widely known [[Morse lemma]] in differential topology). Formally the statement is:

:''Let &lt;math&gt;\delta, C, K &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; a proper [[δ-hyperbolic space]]. There exists &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; such that for any &lt;math&gt;(C, K)&lt;/math&gt;-quasi-geodesic there exists a geodesic &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d(\phi(t), L) \le M&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t \in \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;. ''

It is an important tool in geometric group theory. An immediate application is that any quasi-isometry between proper hyperbolic spaces induces a homeomorphism between their boundaries. This result is the first step in the proof of the [[Mostow rigidity theorem]].

==Examples of quasi-isometry invariants of groups==
The following are some examples of properties of group Cayley graphs that are invariant under quasi-isometry:&lt;ref name = "Topics" /&gt;

===Hyperbolicity===
{{main article|Hyperbolic group}}
A group is called ''hyperbolic'' if one of its Cayley graphs is a δ-hyperbolic space for some δ. When translating between different definitions of hyperbolicity, the particular value of δ may change, but the resulting notions of a hyperbolic group turn out to be equivalent.

Hyperbolic groups have a solvable [[word problem for groups|word problem]]. They are [[biautomatic group|biautomatic]] and [[automatic group|automatic]].:&lt;ref name=charney&gt;{{citation | last=Charney | first=Ruth | title=Artin groups of finite type are biautomatic | journal=Mathematische Annalen | volume= 292 | year=1992 | doi=10.1007/BF01444642 | pages=671–683}}&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, they are [[automatic group|strongly geodesically automatic]], that is, there is an automatic structure on the group, where the language accepted by the word acceptor is the set of all geodesic words.

===Growth===
{{main article|Growth rate (group theory)}}
The '''growth rate''' of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] with respect to a symmetric [[generating set of a group|generating set]] describes the size of balls in the group.  Every element in the group can be written as a product of generators, and the growth rate counts the number of elements that can be written as a product of length ''n''.

According to [[Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth|Gromov's theorem]], a group of polynomial growth is [[virtually nilpotent]], i.e. it has a [[nilpotent group|nilpotent]] [[subgroup]] of finite [[Index of a subgroup|index]].  In particular, the order of polynomial growth &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; has to be a [[natural numbers|natural number]] and in fact &lt;math&gt;\#(n)\sim n^{k_0}&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\#(n)&lt;/math&gt; grows more slowly than any exponential function, ''G'' has a '''subexponential growth rate'''. Any such group is [[amenable group|amenable]].

===Ends===
{{main article|End (topology)}}
The '''ends''' of a [[topological space]] are, roughly speaking, the [[connected component (topology)|connected components]] of the “ideal boundary” of the space.  That is, each end represents a topologically distinct way to move to [[infinity]] within the space.  Adding a point at each end yields a [[Compactification (mathematics)|compactification]] of the original space, known as the '''end compactification'''.

The ends of a [[finitely generated group]] are defined to be the ends of the corresponding [[Cayley graph]]; this definition is insensitive to the choice of generating set.  Every finitely-generated infinite group has either 1, 2, or infinitely many ends, and [[Stallings theorem about ends of groups]] provides a decomposition for groups with more than one end.

===Amenability===
{{main article|Amenable group}}
An '''amenable group''' is a [[locally compact]] [[topological group]] ''G'' carrying a kind of averaging operation on bounded functions that is [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under translation by group elements. The original definition, in terms of a finitely additive invariant measure (or mean) on subsets of ''G'', was introduced by [[John von Neumann]] in 1929 under the [[German language|German]] name "messbar" ("measurable" in English) in response to the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]]. In 1949 Mahlon M. Day introduced the English translation "amenable", apparently as a pun.&lt;ref&gt;Day's first published use of the word is in his abstract for an AMS summer meeting in 1949, [http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?view=body&amp;id=pdf_1&amp;handle=euclid.bams/1183514222 ''Means on semigroups and groups'', Bull. A.M.S. 55 (1949) 1054–1055]. Many text books on amenabilty, such as Volker Runde's, suggest that Day chose the word as a pun.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[discrete group theory]], where ''G'' has the [[discrete topology]], a simpler definition is used.  In this setting, a group is amenable if one can say what proportion of ''G'' any given subset takes up.

If a group has a [[Følner sequence]] then it is automatically amenable.

===Asymptotic cone===
{{main article|Ultralimit#Asymptotic_cones}}
An '''ultralimit''' is a geometric construction that assigns to a sequence of [[metric space]]s ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' a limiting metric space. An important class of ultralimits are the so-called ''asymptotic cones'' of metric spaces. Let (''X'',''d'') be a metric space, let ''&amp;omega;'' be a non-principal ultrafilter on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb N &lt;/math&gt; and let ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'' be a sequence of base-points. Then the ''&amp;omega;''&amp;ndash;ultralimit of the sequence &lt;math&gt;(X, \frac{d}{n}, p_n)&lt;/math&gt; is called the asymptotic cone of ''X'' with respect to ''&amp;omega;'' and &lt;math&gt;(p_n)_n\,&lt;/math&gt; and is denoted &lt;math&gt;Cone_\omega(X,d, (p_n)_n)\,&lt;/math&gt;. One often takes the base-point sequence to be constant, ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''p'' for some ''p &amp;isin; X''; in this case the asymptotic cone does not depend on the choice of ''p &amp;isin; X'' and is denoted by  &lt;math&gt;Cone_\omega(X,d)\,&lt;/math&gt; or just &lt;math&gt;Cone_\omega(X)\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The notion of an asymptotic cone plays an important role in [[geometric group theory]] since asymptotic cones (or, more precisely, their [[homeomorphism|topological types]] and [[Lipschitz continuity|bi-Lipschitz types]]) provide quasi-isometry invariants of metric spaces in general and of finitely generated groups in particular.&lt;ref name="Roe"&gt;John Roe. ''Lectures on Coarse Geometry.'' [[American Mathematical Society]], 2003. {{isbn|978-0-8218-3332-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asymptotic cones also turn out to be a useful tool in the study of [[relatively hyperbolic group]]s and their generalizations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cornelia Druţu]] and Mark Sapir (with an Appendix by [[Denis Osin]] and [[Mark Sapir]]), ''Tree-graded spaces and asymptotic cones of groups.'' [[Topology (journal)|Topology]], Volume 44 (2005), no. 5, pp. 959&amp;ndash;1058.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1782">The '''refinement calculus''' is a formalized approach to stepwise [[program refinement|refinement]] for program construction. The required behaviour of the final executable program is specified as an abstract and perhaps non-executable "program", which is then refined by a series of correctness-preserving transformations into an efficiently executable program.

Proponents include [[Ralph-Johan Back]], who originated the approach in his 1978 PhD thesis ''On the Correctness of Refinement Steps in Program Development'', and [[Carroll_Morgan_(academic)|Carroll Morgan]], especially with his book ''[http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/publications/books/PfS/ Programming from Specifications]'' (Prentice Hall, 2nd edition, 1994, {{ISBN|0-13-123274-6}}). In the latter case, the motivation was to link [[Jean-Raymond Abrial|Abrial]]'s specification notation [[Z notation|Z]], via a rigorous relation of behaviour-preserving [[program refinement]], to an executable programming notation based on [[Edsger W. Dijkstra|Dijkstra]]'s language of [[guarded commands]]. ''Behaviour-preserving'' in this case means that any [[Hoare triple]] satisfied by a program should also be satisfied by any refinement of it, which notion leads directly to ''[http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~mjb/refcalc-tut/home.html#morgan specification statements]'' as pre- and postconditions standing, on their own, for any program that could soundly be placed between them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3097">In computational statistics, '''reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo''' is an extension to standard [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] (MCMC) methodology that allows [[simulation]] of the [[posterior distribution]] on [[space]]s of varying [[dimension]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, the simulation is possible even if the number of [[parameter]]s in the [[Mathematical model|model]] is not known. 

Let 

:&lt;math&gt;n_m\in N_m=\{1,2,\ldots,I\} \, &lt;/math&gt;

be a model [[indicator variable|indicator]] and &lt;math&gt;M=\bigcup_{n_m=1}^I \R^{d_m}&lt;/math&gt; the parameter space whose number of dimensions &lt;math&gt;d_m&lt;/math&gt; depends on the model &lt;math&gt;n_m&lt;/math&gt;. The model indication need not be [[Wikt:finite|finite]]. The stationary distribution is the joint posterior distribution of &lt;math&gt;(M,N_m)&lt;/math&gt; that takes the values &lt;math&gt;(m,n_m)&lt;/math&gt;. 

The proposal &lt;math&gt;m'&lt;/math&gt; can be constructed with a [[map (mathematics)|mapping]] &lt;math&gt;g_{1mm'}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is drawn from a random component
&lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; with density &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\R^{d_{mm'}}&lt;/math&gt;. The move to state &lt;math&gt;(m',n_m')&lt;/math&gt; can thus be formulated as

:&lt;math&gt;
  (m',n_m')=(g_{1mm'}(m,u),n_m') \, 
&lt;/math&gt;

The function

:&lt;math&gt;
  g_{mm'}:=\Bigg((m,u)\mapsto \bigg((m',u')=\big(g_{1mm'}(m,u),g_{2mm'}(m,u)\big)\bigg)\Bigg) \, 
&lt;/math&gt;

must be ''one to one'' and differentiable, and have a non-zero support:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{supp}(g_{mm'})\ne \varnothing \, &lt;/math&gt;

so that there exists an [[inverse function]] 

:&lt;math&gt;g^{-1}_{mm'}=g_{m'm} \, &lt;/math&gt;

that is differentiable. Therefore, the &lt;math&gt;(m,u)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(m',u')&lt;/math&gt; must be of equal dimension, which is the case if the dimension criterion 

:&lt;math&gt;d_m+d_{mm'}=d_{m'}+d_{m'm} \, &lt;/math&gt;

is met where &lt;math&gt;d_{mm'}&lt;/math&gt; is the dimension of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;. This is known as ''dimension matching''. 

If &lt;math&gt;\R^{d_m}\subset \R^{d_{m'}}&lt;/math&gt; then the dimensional matching
condition can be reduced to 

:&lt;math&gt;d_m+d_{mm'}=d_{m'} \, &lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;(m,u)=g_{m'm}(m). \, &lt;/math&gt;

The acceptance probability will be given by

:&lt;math&gt;
  a(m,m')=\min\left(1,
  \frac{p_{m'm}p_{m'}f_{m'}(m')}{p_{mm'}q_{mm'}(m,u)p_{m}f_m(m)}\left|\det\left(\frac{\partial g_{mm'}(m,u)}{\partial (m,u)}\right)\right|\right),
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;|\cdot |&lt;/math&gt; denotes the absolute value and &lt;math&gt;p_mf_m&lt;/math&gt; is the joint posterior probability

:&lt;math&gt;
  p_mf_m=c^{-1}p(y|m,n_m)p(m|n_m)p(n_m), \, 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the normalising constant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2088">'''Rudin's conjecture''' is a mathematical hypothesis (in [[additive combinatorics]] and [[elementary number theory]]) concerning an upper bound for the number of squares in finite [[arithmetic progression]]s. The conjecture, which has applications in the theory of [[trigonometric series]], was first stated by [[Walter Rudin]] in his 1960 paper ''Trigonometric series with gaps''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Granville, Andrew|editor2=Nathanson, Melvyn Bernard|editor3=Solymosi, József|editor3-link= József Solymosi |author=Cilleruelo, Javier|author2=Granville, Andrew|chapter=Lattice points on circles, squares in arithmetic progressions and sumsets of squares|title=Additive combinatorics|year=2007|series=CRM Proceedings &amp; Lecture Notes, vol. 43|publisher=American Mathematical Society|pages=241–262|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9q6_O6AwAhQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA241}} [https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0608109 arXiv.org preprint]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=24900534|author=Rudin, Walter|title=Trigonometric series with gaps|journal=Journal of Mathematics and Mechanics|year=1960|pages=203–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LMS&gt;{{cite journal|journal=LMS Journal of Computation and Mathematics|volume=17|issue=1|year=2014|pages=58–76|title=On a conjecture of Rudin on squares in arithmetic progressions|author=González-Jiménez, Enrique|author2=Xarles, Xavier|doi=10.1112/S1461157013000259}} [https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.5122 arXiv.org preprint]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13551">The '''STEM pipeline''' is a term used to describe the educational pathway for students in the [[STEM fields]], (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). The start and end of this STEM pipeline are disputed, but it is often considered to begin in early education and extend into graduation or an adult career in STEM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bu.edu/stem/files/2015/02/The-STEM-Pipeline-booklet1.3-36.pdf|title=The STEM Pipeline|last=Inside Higher Ed|first=|date=2015-02-09|website=Boston University STEM Education Initiatives|publisher=Inside Higher Ed|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The "pipeline" metaphor is based on the idea that having sufficient graduates requires both having sufficient input of students at the beginning of their studies, and retaining these students through completion of their academic program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Educational Pipeline FAQ| accessdate = 2015-03-02| url = http://www.highereducation.org/reports/pipeline/faq.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; The STEM pipeline is a key component of [[Diversity (business)|workplace diversity]] and of [[Workforce|workforce development]] that ensures sufficient qualified candidates are available to fill scientific and technical positions.

The STEM pipeline was promoted in the United States from the 1970s onwards, as “the push for STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education appears to have grown from a concern for the low number of future professionals to fill STEM jobs and careers and economic and educational competitiveness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Ryan|last2=Brown|first2=Joshua|last3=Reardon|first3=Kristin|last4=Merrill|first4=Chris|title=Understanding STEM: Current Perceptions|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ918930|journal=Technology and Engineering Teacher|language=en|volume=70|issue=6|pages=5–9|issn=2158-0502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, this metaphor is commonly used to describe retention problems in STEM fields, called “leaks” in the pipeline. For example, the White House reported in 2012 that 80% of minority groups and women who enroll in a STEM field switch to a non-STEM field or drop out during their undergraduate education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waldrop|first=M. Mitchell|date=2015-07-16|title=Why we are teaching science wrong, and how to make it right|url=http://www.nature.com/news/why-we-are-teaching-science-wrong-and-how-to-make-it-right-1.17963|journal=Nature|volume=523|issue=7560|pages=272–274|doi=10.1038/523272a}}&lt;/ref&gt; These leaks often vary by field, gender, ethnic and racial identity, socioeconomic background, and other factors, drawing attention to structural inequities involved in STEM education and careers.

==Current efforts==
The STEM pipeline concept is a useful tool for programs aiming at increasing the total number of graduates, and is especially important in efforts to increase the number of underrepresented minorities and women in STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ihep.org/sites/default/files/uploads/docs/pubs/report_diversifying_the_stem_pipeline_report.pdf|title=Diversifying the STEM pipeline: the Model Replication Institutions Program|last=Institute for Higher Education Policy|accessdate=2015-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using STEM methodology, educational policymakers can examine the quantity and retention of students at all stages of the K&amp;ndash;12 educational process and beyond, and devise programs and interventions to improve educational processes and outcomes. STEM programs focus on increasing social and academic supports for students. STEM programs may also focus on bringing students together with professionals in their field, to provide mentoring, [[role model]]s and learning opportunities in industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stempipelineinstitute.com/?page_id=9|title=STEM Methodology - Teachers in teams, STEM Innovation at work|work=STEM Pipeline Institute|accessdate=2015-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maintaining a healthy and diverse STEM pipeline has been a concern in several developed countries, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sciencecampaign.org.uk/CaSEDiversityinSTEMreport2014.pdf|title=Improving Diversity in STEM: A report by the Campaign for Science and Engineering (CaSE)|last=King's College, London|work=Campaign for Science and Engineering (CaSE)|accessdate=2015-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elsevier.com/connect/stem-diversity-initiatives-what-works-what-doesnt|title=STEM diversity initiatives—what works, what doesn't|last=Larkin|first=Marilynn|date=2014-02-12|work=Elsevier Connect|accessdate=2015-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-launches-educate-innovate-campaign-excellence-science-technology-en|title=President Obama Launches "Educate to Innovate" Campaign for Excellence in Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Math (Stem) Education|date=2009-11-23|work=The White House|accessdate=2015-03-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150308185543/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-launches-educate-innovate-campaign-excellence-science-technology-en|archivedate=2015-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the [[United States]], although efforts to increase the number of [[women]] and [[African Americans]] in STEM fields have been ongoing, as recently as 2010 the results have been evaluated as "poor".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Robelin| first = Erik W.| title = U.S. Gets Poor Grades in Nurturing STEM Diversity| work = Education Week| accessdate = 2015-03-02| date = 2010-03-22| url = http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2010/03/22/27stem.h29.html?tkn=NWVFcgAJIKVsbeYl2%2BToW1DL8nSEuQXi5ytU&amp;cmp=clp-edweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Davis-Lowe| first = OPAS Diversity Committee| title = Fostering STEM Diversity| work = Elsevier Connect| accessdate = 2015-03-02| date = November 2007| url = http://www.elsevier.com/connect/stem-diversity-initiatives-what-works-what-doesnt}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, one report declared that "traditionally underrepresented groups remain underrepresented",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Stem pipeline problems to aid STEM diversity| work = Phys.org| accessdate = 2015-03-02| date = 2014-06-18| url = http://phys.org/news/2014-06-stem-pipeline-problems-aid-diversity.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another article commented, "You can go through your entire scholarly trajectory in [[computer science]] without seeing one face of color", where "of color" refers to African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Institute for African American Mentoring in Computing Sciences| title = Creating a Computer Science Pipeline for African Americans| work = Wisconsin Center for Education Research| accessdate = 2015-03-02| date = 2014-04-28| url = http://www.wcer.wisc.edu/news/coverStories/2014/Creating_a_Computer_Science_Pipeline_for_African_%20Americans.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

STEM pipeline programs in the US have been created at various levels. Examples include: the Technology Leadership Institute at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] at the college and university level,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Lack of diversity part of equation in STEM fields| work = Pittsburgh Post-Gazette| accessdate = 2015-03-02| date = 2009-02-10| url = http://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2009/02/10/Lack-of-diversity-part-of-equation-in-STEM-fields/stories/200902100187}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Nevada STEM pipeline at the state level &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Nevada STEM Pipeline, Your Resource for Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics Programs| accessdate = 2015-03-02| url = http://www.nvstempipeline.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Broadening Participation in Computing Alliances at the national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 28| issue = 1| pages = –2014| last = Charleston| first = LaVar J| title = Creating a Pipeline for African American Computing Science Faculty: An Innovative Faculty/Research Mentoring Program Model| journal = Journal of Faculty Development| accessdate = 2015-03-02| url = http://weilab.wceruw.org/documents/Creating%20a%20Pipeline%20for%20African%20American%20Computing%20Science%20Faculty%20-%20An%20Innovative%20Faculty-Research%20Mentoring%20Program%20Model.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational attainment factors ==
High Schools in the United States implement a STEM pipeline program that combines a dual pathway that enhances mathematical, engineering, and scientific skills along with a supportive group that aims to help underrepresented students aspire to become leaders in the STEM field. Students benefit from the moral support and motivational skills that mentors implement for their correct academic preparation. Teachers, and college mentors become in the life of the students in the program a guidance in their path to be the next generation of leaders. Furthermore, staff members aid students to feel integrated and cared for their well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://grants.nih.gov/training/minority_participation.pdf|title=Expanding underrepresented minority participation|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their path to pursue higher education in the STEM fields, underrepresented students are awarded scholarships that aid them throughout their college years. Scholarships are a factor that allows underrepresented to focus on their academic and allows them to be persistent throughout their years in college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cue.usc.edu/files/2016/01/DC_Testimony.pdf|title=BROADENING PARTICIPATION IN STEM|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The STEM pipeline program provides a multitude of workshops, and extracurricular activities to work on social and professional development. Moreover, it arranges networking with minorities that went through the program and now currently work in the science, or health field. In addition, to the benefits as an alumnus of the program, every student is invited to become advocates within their community with the goal of increasing the amount of underrepresented students in STEM fields &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.uncfsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&amp;context=jri|title=The STEM Pipeline: Recruiting and Retaining African American Female Engineers|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The support of programs such as the STEM pipeline program aims to increase diversity in the workplace with the ambition to create an inclusive safe area where all the members of the team can contribute to the development of innovative ideas in their respective field. Additionally, the diversity of collaborating with different ideas enhances the outcome of the team's desired goal, and facilitates better planning of the timeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stelar.edc.org/sites/stelar.edc.org/files/ITEST_Preparing_Workforce_FINAL_hires.pdf|title=Preparing Tomorrow’s STEM Workforce Through Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public reactions==
The concept of the STEM pipeline has been met with resistance for its pragmatic overtones. National Science Board Vice Chairman Kelvin Droegemeier calls for a movement away from thinking about the necessary number of STEM workers, in favor of considering the necessary knowledge and skills for the success of all workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=134866|title=Revisiting the STEM workforce {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The linearity of the STEM pipeline concept has been criticized as neglecting the wide variety of possible career pathways, including interdisciplinary studies, intermittent careers, and STEM-informed work in non-technical fields. A 2015 commentary in Inside Higher Ed suggested that the "leaky pipeline" metaphor may be viewed as pejorative towards individuals who leave the academic track for employment, or use their technical background as the basis for a career in a non-technical field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2015/03/03/essay-calls-ending-leaky-pipeline-metaphor-when-discussing-women-science#.VPXuS0yfvkw.twitter|title=Essay calls for ending the 'leaky pipeline' metaphor when discussing women in science|last=Miller|first=David|date=2015-03-03|work=@insidehighered|accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 commentary in ''Science'' observed that [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Angela Merkel]] could be considered two "leaks" in the pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Penner|first=A.&amp;nbsp;M.|date=2015-01-16|title=Gender inequality in science|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aaa3781|journal=Science|volume=347|issue=6219|pages=234–235|doi=10.1126/science.aaa3781|issn=0036-8075|accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have said that increasing the STEM pipeline is not enough to promote workplace diversity. Women and minorities in STEM such as [[Tracy Chou]] have argued that STEM companies must also focus on internal reforms, such as reevaluating inequitable hiring practices and unsupportive workplace culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@triketora/where-are-the-numbers-cb997a57252|title=Where are the numbers?|last=Chou|first=Tracy|date=2013-10-11|website=Medium|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6205">'''Sard's theorem''', also known as '''Sard's lemma''' or the '''Morse&amp;ndash;Sard theorem''', is a result in [[mathematical analysis]] that asserts that the set of [[critical value]]s (that is, the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of the set of [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]s) of a [[smooth function]] ''f'' from one [[Euclidean space]] or [[manifold]] to another is a [[null set]], i.e., it has [[Lebesgue measure]] 0. This makes the set of critical values "small" in the sense of a [[generic property]]. The theorem is named for [[Anthony Morse]] and [[Arthur Sard]].

== Statement ==
More explicitly ({{harvtxt|Sternberg|1964|loc=Theorem II.3.1}}; {{harvtxt|Sard|1942}}), let

:&lt;math&gt;f\colon \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;

be &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt;, (that is, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; times [[continuously differentiable]]), where &lt;math&gt;k\geq \max\{n-m+1, 1\}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; denote the ''[[critical point mathematics|critical set]]'' of &lt;math&gt;f,&lt;/math&gt; which is the set of points &lt;math&gt;x\in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; at which the [[Jacobian matrix]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has [[rank of a matrix|rank]] &lt;math&gt;&lt;\min\{m,n\}&lt;/math&gt;.  Then the [[image]] &lt;math&gt;f(X)&lt;/math&gt; has Lebesgue measure 0 in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;.

Intuitively speaking, this means that although &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; may be large, its image must be small in the sense of Lebesgue measure: while &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; may have many critical ''points'' in the domain &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, it must have few critical ''values'' in the image &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;.

More generally, the result also holds for mappings between [[second-countable space|second countable]] [[differentiable manifold]]s &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of dimensions &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. The critical set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of a &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt; function 
:&lt;math&gt;f:N\rightarrow M&lt;/math&gt; 
consists of those points at which the [[pushforward (differential)|differential]] 
:&lt;math&gt;df:TN\rightarrow TM&lt;/math&gt; 
has rank less than &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; as a linear transformation. If &lt;math&gt;k\geq \max\{n-m+1,1\}&lt;/math&gt;, then Sard's theorem asserts that the image of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has measure zero as a subset of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.  This formulation of the result follows from the version for Euclidean spaces by taking a [[countable set]] of coordinate patches.  The conclusion of the theorem is a local statement, since a countable union of sets of measure zero is a set of measure zero, and the property of a subset of a coordinate patch having zero measure is invariant under [[diffeomorphism]].

== Variants ==
There are many variants of this lemma, which plays a basic role in [[singularity theory]] among other fields. The case &lt;math&gt;m=1&lt;/math&gt; was proven by [[Anthony P. Morse]] in 1939 {{harv|Morse|1939}}, and the general case by [[Arthur Sard]] in 1942 {{harv|Sard|1942}}.

A version for infinite-dimensional [[Banach manifold]]s was proven by [[Stephen Smale]] {{harv|Smale|1965}}.

The statement is quite powerful, and the proof involves analysis. In topology it is often quoted — as in the [[Brouwer fixed point theorem]] and some applications in [[Morse theory]] — in order to prove the weaker corollary that “a non-constant smooth map has '''at least one''' regular value”.

In 1965 Sard further generalized his theorem to state that if &lt;math&gt;f:N\rightarrow M&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k\geq \max\{n-m+1, 1\}&lt;/math&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;A_r\subseteq N&lt;/math&gt; is the set of points &lt;math&gt;x\in N&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;df_x&lt;/math&gt; has rank strictly less than &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, then the r-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]] of &lt;math&gt;f(A_r)&lt;/math&gt; is zero. In particular the [[Hausdorff dimension]] of &lt;math&gt;f(A_r)&lt;/math&gt; is at most r. Caveat: The Hausdorff dimension of &lt;math&gt;f(A_r)&lt;/math&gt; can be arbitrarly close to r.&lt;ref&gt;http://math.stackexchange.com/a/446049/62443&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The definition presented here is different from that of the "semi-inner product" in standard functional analysis textbooks,&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Conway. A Course in Functional Analysis. 2nd Edition, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1990, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; where a "semi-inner product" satisfies all the properties of inner products (including conjugate symmetry) except that it is not required to be strictly positive.

A '''semi-inner-product''' for a [[linear vector space]] &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; over the [[Number field|field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; of complex numbers is a function from &lt;math&gt;V\times V&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;[\cdot,\cdot]&lt;/math&gt;, such that
# &lt;math&gt;[f+g,h]=[f,h]+[g,h]\quad \forall f,g,h\in V&lt;/math&gt;,
# &lt;math&gt;[\alpha f,g]=\alpha[f,g]\quad \forall \alpha\in\mathbb{C},\ \forall f,g\in V,&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;[f,\alpha g]=\overline{\alpha}[f,g] \quad \forall \alpha\in\mathbb{C},\ \forall f,g\in V,&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;[f,f]\ge 0,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\left|[f,g]\right|\le [f,f]^{1/2}[g,g]^{1/2}\quad \forall f,g\in V.&lt;/math&gt;

==Difference from inner products==

A semi-inner-product is different from inner products in that it is in general not conjugate symmetric, i.e.,

::&lt;math&gt;[f,g]\ne \overline{[g,f]}&lt;/math&gt;
generally. This is equivalent to saying that &lt;ref&gt;S. V. Phadke and N. K. Thakare, When an s.i.p. space is a Hilbert space?, The Mathematics Student 42 (1974), 193–194.&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;[f,g+h]\ne [f,g]+[f,h]. \, &lt;/math&gt;

In other words, semi-inner-products are generally nonlinear about its second variable.

==Semi-inner-products for Banach spaces==
* If &lt;math&gt;[\cdot,\cdot]&lt;/math&gt; is a semi-inner-product for a [[linear vector space]] &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; then

::&lt;math&gt;\|f\|:=[f,f]^{1/2},\quad f\in V&lt;/math&gt;

defines a [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.

* Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a [[normed vector space]] with the [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|&lt;/math&gt; then there always exists a (not necessarily unique) semi-inner-product on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; that is '''consistent''' with the norm on &lt;math&gt; V&lt;/math&gt; in the sense that

::&lt;math&gt;\|f\|=[f,f]^{1/2},\ \ \forall f\in V.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
*The [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt; with the &lt;math&gt;\ell^p&lt;/math&gt; norm (&lt;math&gt;1\le p&lt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt;)

::&lt;math&gt;\|x\|_p:=\biggl(\sum_{j=1}^p |x_j|^p\biggr)^{1/p}&lt;/math&gt;

has the consistent semi-inner-product:

::&lt;math&gt;[x,y]:=\frac{\sum_{j=1}^n x_j\overline{y_j}|y_j|^{p-2}}{\|y\|_p^{p-2}},\quad x,y\in\mathbb{C}^n\setminus\{0\},\ \ 1&lt;p&lt;+\infty,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;[x,y]:=\sum_{j=1}^nx_j\operatorname{sgn}(\overline{y_j}),\quad x,y\in\mathbb{C}^n,\ \ p=1,&lt;/math&gt;

where

::&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{sgn}(t):=\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\frac{t}{|t|},&amp;t\in \mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\},\\
0,&amp;t=0.
\end{array}
\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

*In general, the space &lt;math&gt;L^p(\Omega,d\mu)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-integrable functions on a [[measure space]] &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\mu)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;1\le p&lt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt;, with the norm

::&lt;math&gt;\|f\|_p:=\left(\int_\Omega |f(t)|^pd\mu(t)\right)^{1/p}&lt;/math&gt;

possesses the consistent semi-inner-product:

::&lt;math&gt;[f,g]:=\frac{\int_\Omega f(t)\overline{g(t)}|g(t)|^{p-2}d\mu(t)}{\|g\|_p^{p-2}},\ \ f,g\in L^p(\Omega,d\mu)\setminus\{0\},\ \ 1&lt;p&lt;+\infty,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;[f,g]:=\int_\Omega f(t)\operatorname{sgn}(\overline{g(t)})d\mu(t),\ \ f,g\in L^1(\Omega,d\mu).&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8862">In [[statistical mechanics]], the '''Temperley–Lieb algebra''' is an algebra from which are built certain [[transfer matrix|transfer matrices]], invented by [[Harold Neville Vazeille Temperley|Neville Temperley]] and [[Elliott H. Lieb|Elliott Lieb]]. It is also related to  [[integrable model]]s, [[knot theory]] and the [[braid group]], [[quantum groups]] and [[subfactor]]s of [[von Neumann algebra]]s.

==Definition==

Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be a [[commutative ring]] and fix &lt;math&gt;\delta \in R&lt;/math&gt;. The Temperley–Lieb algebra &lt;math&gt;TL_n(\delta)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[algebra (ring theory)|&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-algebra]] generated by the elements &lt;math&gt;U_1, U_2, \ldots, U_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;, subject to the Jones relations: 
*&lt;math&gt;U_i^2 = \delta U_i&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq n-1&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;U_i U_{i+1} U_i = U_i&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq n-2&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;U_i U_{i-1} U_i = U_i&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;2 \leq i \leq n-1&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;U_i U_j = U_j U_i&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i,j \leq n-1&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|i-j| \neq 1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;TL_n(\delta)&lt;/math&gt; may be represented diagrammatically as the vector space over noncrossing pairings on a rectangle with ''n'' points on two opposite sides.  The five basis elements of &lt;math&gt;TL_3(\delta)&lt;/math&gt; are the following:

[[File:Temperley-lieb (horizontal).svg|340px|Basis of the Temperley–Lieb algebra &lt;math&gt;TL_3(\delta)&lt;/math&gt;]].

Multiplication on basis elements can be performed by placing two rectangles side by side, and replacing any closed loops by a factor of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, for example:

[[File:Factor-a.svg|50px]]  ×  [[File:Factor-b.svg|50px]]  =  [[File:Factor-a.svg|50px]][[File:Factor-b.svg|50px]]  =  &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;  [[File:Concatenation-ab.svg|50px]].

The identity element is the diagram in which each point is connected to the one directly across the rectangle from it, and the generator &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt; is the diagram in which the ''i''th point is connected to the ''i+1''th point, the ''2n − i + 1''th point is connected to the ''2n − i''th point, and all other points are connected to the point directly across the rectangle.  The generators of &lt;math&gt;TL_5(\delta)&lt;/math&gt; are:

[[File:Temperley-Lieb (generateurs).svg|340px|Generators of the Temperley–Lieb algebra &lt;math&gt;TL_5(\delta)&lt;/math&gt;]]

From left to right, the unit 1 and the generators U&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, U&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

The Jones relations can be seen graphically:

[[File:E 2 Temperley.svg|50px]] [[File:E 2 Temperley.svg|50px]]  =  &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;  [[File:E 2 Temperley.svg|50px]]

[[File:E 2 Temperley.svg|50px]] [[File:E 3 Temperley.svg|50px]] [[File:E 2 Temperley.svg|50px]]  =  [[File:E 2 Temperley.svg|50px]]

[[File:E 1 Temperley.svg|50px]] [[File:E 4 Temperley.svg|50px]]  =  [[File:E 4 Temperley.svg|50px]] [[File:E 1 Temperley.svg|50px]]

==The Temperley-Lieb Hamiltonian==

Consider an interaction-round-a-face model e.g. a square [[Lattice model (physics)|lattice model]] and let &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be the number of sites on the lattice. Following Temperley and Lieb&lt;ref&gt;Temperley N. and Lieb E., (1971), ''Relations between the 'Percolation' and 'Colouring' Problem and other Graph-Theoretical Problems Associated with Regular Planar Lattices: Some Exact Results for the 'Percolation' Problem'', Proc. R. Soc. A 322 251.&lt;/ref&gt; we define the Temperley-Lieb [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|hamiltonian]] (the TL hamiltonian) as

&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{H} = \sum_{j=1}^{L-1} (1 - e_j) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e_j =  U(\lambda)/\sin\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, for some spectral parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in R&lt;/math&gt;.

===Applications===

We will firstly consider the case &lt;math&gt;L = 3&lt;/math&gt;. The TL hamiltonian is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H} = 2 - e_1 - e_2 &lt;/math&gt;, namely 

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;  =  2  [[File:Unit 3 Temperley.svg|50px]]  -  [[File:E 1 3 Temperley.svg|50px]]  -  [[File:E 2 3 Temperley.svg|50px]].

We have two possible states,

[[File:BS1-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]] and [[File:BS2-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]].

In acting by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; on these states, we find

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; [[File:BS1-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]]  =  2  [[File:Unit 3 Temperley.svg|50px]][[File:BS1-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]]  -  [[File:E 1 3 Temperley.svg|50px]][[File:BS1-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]]  -  [[File:E 2 3 Temperley.svg|50px]][[File:BS1-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]]  =  [[File:BS1-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]]  -  [[File:BS2-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]],

and

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; [[File:BS2-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]]  =  2  [[File:Unit 3 Temperley.svg|50px]][[File:BS2-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]]  -  [[File:E 1 3 Temperley.svg|50px]][[File:BS2-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]]  -  [[File:E 2 3 Temperley.svg|50px]][[File:BS2-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]]  =  -  [[File:BS1-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]]  +  [[File:BS2-Temperley-Lieb.svg|40px]].

Writing &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; as a matrix in the basis of possible states we have,

&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{H} = \left(\begin{array}{rr}
1 &amp; -1\\
-1 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

The eigenvector of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; with the ''lowest'' [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue]] is known as the [[ground state]]. In this case, the lowest eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;. The corresponding [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvector]] is &lt;math&gt;\psi_0 = (1, 1)&lt;/math&gt;. As we vary the number of sites &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; we find the following table&lt;ref name="bach"&gt;Batchelor M., de Gier J. and Nienhuis B., (2001), The quantum symmetric &lt;math&gt;XXZ&lt;/math&gt; chain at &lt;math&gt;\Delta = -1/2&lt;/math&gt;, alternating-sign matrices and plane partitions, J. Phys. A 34, L265-L270.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combinatorial Properties===
An interesting observation is that the largest components of the ground state of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; have a combinatorial enumeration as we vary the number of sites,&lt;ref&gt;de Gier J., (2005), Loops, matchings and alternating-sign matrices, Discrete Mathematics Volume 298, Issues 1-3, Pages 365-388.&lt;/ref&gt; as was first observed by [[Murray Batchelor]], Jan de Gier and Bernard Nienhuis.&lt;ref name="bach"&gt;Batchelor M., de Gier J. and Nienhuis B., (2001), The quantum symmetric &lt;math&gt;XXZ&lt;/math&gt; chain at &lt;math&gt;\Delta = -1/2&lt;/math&gt;, alternating-sign matrices and plane partitions, J. Phys. A 34, L265-L270.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the resources of the [[on-line encyclopedia of integer sequences]], Batchelor ''et al.'' found, for an even numbers of sites 

&lt;math&gt;
1, 2, 11, 170, \ldots = \prod_{j=0}^{n-1} \left( 3j + 1\right)\frac{ (2j)!(6j)!}{(4j)!(4j + 1)!}
&lt;/math&gt;

and for an odd numbers of sites 

&lt;math&gt;
1, 3, 26, 646, \ldots = \prod_{j=0}^{n-1} (3j+2)\frac{ (2j + 2)!(6j + 3)!}{(4j + 2)!(4j + 3)!}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Surprisingly, these sequences corresponded to well known combinatorial objects. For &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; even, this {{OEIS|id=A051255}} corresponds to cyclically symmetric transpose complement plane partitions and for &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; odd, {{OEIS|id=A005156}}, these correspond to &lt;math&gt;(2n+1)\times(2n+1)&lt;/math&gt; [[Alternating sign matrix|alternating sign matrices]] symmetric about the vertical axis.

In [[cryptography]], a '''transposition cipher''' is a method of encryption by which the positions held by units of [[plaintext]] (which are commonly characters or groups of characters) are shifted according to a regular system, so that the [[ciphertext]] constitutes a [[permutation]] of the plaintext. That is, the order of the units is changed (the plaintext is reordered). Mathematically a [[bijective]] function is used on the characters' positions to encrypt and an [[inverse function]] to decrypt.

Following are some implementations.

== Rail Fence cipher ==
The [[rail fence|Rail Fence]] cipher is a form of transposition cipher that gets its name from the way in which it is encoded. In the rail fence cipher, the plaintext is written downwards on successive "rails" of an imaginary fence, then moving up when we get to the bottom. The message is then read off in rows. For example, using three "rails" and a message of 'WE ARE DISCOVERED. FLEE AT ONCE', the cipherer writes out:

 W . . . E . . . C . . . R . . . L . . . T . . . E
 . E . R . D . S . O . E . E . F . E . A . O . C .
 . . A . . . I . . . V . . . D . . . E . . . N . .

Then reads off:

 WECRL TEERD SOEEF EAOCA IVDEN

(The cipherer has broken this ciphertext up into blocks of five to help avoid errors. This is a common technique used to make the cipher more easily readable. The spacing is not related to spaces in the plaintext and so does not carry any information about the plaintext.)

The rail fence cipher was used by the [[ancient Greeks]] in the [[scytale]], a mechanical system of producing a transposition cipher. The system consisted of a cylinder and a ribbon that was wrapped around the cylinder. The message to be encrypted was written on the coiled ribbon. The letters of the original message would be rearranged when the ribbon was uncoiled from the cylinder. However, the message was easily decrypted when the ribbon was recoiled on a cylinder of the same diameter as the encrypting cylinder.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Laurence Dwight|last=Smith|title=Cryptography / The Science of Secret Writing|year=1955|origyear=1943|publisher=Dover|place=New York|pages=16, 92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Route cipher ==
In a route cipher, the plaintext is first written out in a grid of given dimensions, then read off in a pattern given in the key. For example, using the same plaintext that we used for [[rail fence]]:
 W R I O R F E O E 
 E E S V E L A N J 
 A D C E D E T C X 
The key might specify "spiral inwards, clockwise, starting from the top right". That would give a cipher text of:

 EJXCTEDECDAEWRIORFEONALEVSE

Route ciphers have many more keys than a rail fence. In fact, for messages of reasonable length, the number of possible keys is potentially too great to be enumerated even by modern machinery. However, not all keys are equally good. Badly chosen routes will leave excessive chunks of plaintext, or text simply reversed, and this will give cryptanalysts a clue as to the routes.

A variation of the route cipher was the Union Route Cipher, used by Union forces during the [[American Civil War]]. This worked much like an ordinary route cipher, but transposed whole words instead of individual letters. Because this would leave certain highly sensitive words exposed, such words would first be concealed by [[code (cryptography)|code]]. The cipher clerk may also add entire null words, which were often chosen to make the ciphertext humorous. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

== Columnar transposition ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Substitution cipher]] --&gt;
In a columnar transposition, the message is written out in rows of a fixed length, and then read out again column by column, and the columns are chosen in some scrambled order. Both the width of the rows and the permutation of the columns are usually defined by a keyword. For example, the keyword &lt;tt&gt;ZEBRAS&lt;/tt&gt; is of length 6                                                                          (so the rows are of length 6), and the permutation is defined by the alphabetical order of the letters in the keyword. In this case, the order would be "6 3 2 4 1 5".

In a regular columnar transposition cipher, any spare spaces are filled with nulls; in an irregular columnar transposition cipher, the spaces are left blank. Finally, the message is read off in columns, in the order specified by the keyword. For example, suppose we use the keyword &lt;tt&gt;ZEBRAS&lt;/tt&gt; and the message &lt;tt&gt;WE ARE DISCOVERED. FLEE AT ONCE&lt;/tt&gt;. In a regular columnar transposition, we write this into the grid as follows:
 6 3 2 4 1 5
 W E A R E D
 I S C O V E 
 R E D F L E 
 E A T O N C 
 E Q K J E U 
providing five nulls (&lt;tt&gt;QKJEU&lt;/tt&gt;), these letters can be randomly selected as they just fill out the incomplete columns and are not part of the message. The ciphertext is then read off as:
 EVLNE ACDTK ESEAQ ROFOJ DEECU WIREE

In the irregular case, the columns are not completed by nulls:
 6 3 2 4 1 5
 W E A R E D 
 I S C O V E 
 R E D F L E 
 E A T O N C 
 E 
This results in the following ciphertext:
 EVLNA CDTES EAROF ODEEC WIREE

To decipher it, the recipient has to work out the column lengths by dividing the message length by the key length. Then he can write the message out in columns again, then re-order the columns by reforming the key word.

In a variation, the message is blocked into segments that are the key length long and to each segment the same permutation (given by the key) is applied. This is equivalent to a columnar transposition where the read-out is by rows instead of columns.

Columnar transposition continued to be used for serious purposes as a component of more complex ciphers at least into the 1950s.

== Double transposition ==
A single columnar transposition could be attacked by guessing possible column lengths, writing the message out in its columns (but in the wrong order, as the key is not yet known), and then looking for possible [[anagram]]s. Thus to make it stronger, a double transposition was often used. This is simply a columnar transposition applied twice. The same key can be used for both transpositions, or two different keys can be used.

As an example, we can take the result of the irregular columnar transposition in the previous section, and perform a second encryption with a different keyword, &lt;tt&gt;STRIPE&lt;/tt&gt;, which gives the permutation "564231":
 5 6 4 2 3 1 
 E V L N A C
 D T E S E A
 R O F O D E
 E C W I R E
 E

As before, this is read off columnwise to give the ciphertext:

 CAEEN SOIAE DRLEF WEDRE EVTOC

If multiple messages of exactly the same length are encrypted using the same keys, they can be anagrammed simultaneously.  This can lead to both recovery of the messages, and to recovery of the keys (so that every other message sent with those keys can be read).

During [[World War I]], the German military used a double columnar transposition cipher, changing the keys infrequently. The system was regularly solved by the French, naming it Übchi, who were typically able to quickly find the keys once they'd intercepted a number of messages of the same length, which generally took only a few days. However, the French success became widely known and, after a publication in ''[[Le Matin (France)|Le Matin]]'', the Germans changed to a new system on 18 November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, pp. 301-304.&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, the double transposition cipher was used by [[Netherlands in World War II#Oppression and resistance|Dutch Resistance]] groups, the French [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]] and the British [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE), which was in charge of managing underground activities in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, pp. 535 and 539.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used by agents of the American [[Office of Strategic Services]]&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, p. 539.&lt;/ref&gt; and as an emergency cipher for the German Army and Navy.

Until the invention of the [[VIC cipher]], double transposition was generally regarded as the most complicated cipher that an agent could operate reliably under difficult field conditions.

=== Cryptanalysis ===


The double transposition cipher can be treated as a single transposition with a key as long as the product of the lengths of the two keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barker |first1=Wayne |title=Cryptanalysis of the Double Transposition Cipher: Includes Problems and Computer Programs |date=1995 |publisher=Aegean Park Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2013, a double transposition challenge, regarded by its author as undecipherable, was solved by George Lasry using  a divide-and-conquer approach where each transposition was attacked individually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01611194.2014.915269 |first=George |last=Lasry |author= |authorlink= |title=Solving the Double Transposition Challenge with a Divide-and-Conquer Approach |date=2014-06-13 |work= |publisher=Cryptologia, Volume 38, 2014 Issue 3|location= |page= |pages=197-214 |at= |language= |trans-title=|format= |doi=10.1080/01611194.2014.915269 |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2017-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Myszkowski transposition ==

A variant form of columnar transposition, proposed by Émile Victor Théodore Myszkowski in 1902, requires a keyword with recurrent letters.  In usual practice, subsequent occurrences of a keyword letter are treated as if the next letter in alphabetical order, ''e.g.,'' the keyword TOMATO yields a numeric keystring of "532164."

In Myszkowski transposition, recurrent keyword letters are numbered identically, TOMATO yielding a keystring of "432143."

 4 3 2 1 4 3
 W E A R E D
 I S C O V E
 R E D F L E
 E A T O N C
 E

Plaintext columns with unique numbers are transcribed downward;
those with recurring numbers are transcribed left to right:

 ROFOA CDTED SEEEA CWEIV RLENE

== Disrupted transposition ==
In a disrupted transposition, certain positions in a grid are blanked out, and not used when filling in the plaintext. This breaks up regular patterns and makes the cryptanalyst's job more difficult.

== Grilles ==
{{Main|Grille (cryptography)}}

Another form of transposition cipher uses ''grilles'', or physical masks with cut-outs. This can produce a highly irregular transposition over the period specified by the size of the grille, but requires the correspondents to keep a physical key secret. Grilles were first proposed in 1550, and were still in military use for the first few months of World War One.

== Scytale ==
{{Main article|Scytale}}
A cipher from ancient Greek times that was used to make encryptions. The device used to make these ciphers was a rod with a polygon base, which was wrapped in paper. People then, could write on the paper horizontally. When the paper was removed from the device, it would make a strip of letters that seemed randomized. The only way to read the message would be to have a Scytale machine of your own.

== Detection and cryptanalysis ==
Since transposition does not affect the frequency of individual symbols, simple transposition can be easily detected by the [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]] by doing a frequency count. If the ciphertext exhibits a [[frequency distribution]] very similar to plaintext, it is most likely a transposition. This can then often be attacked by [[anagram]]ming—sliding pieces of ciphertext around, then looking for sections that look like anagrams of English words, and solving the anagrams. Once such anagrams have been found, they reveal information about the transposition pattern, and can consequently be extended.

Simpler transpositions also often suffer from the property that keys very close to the correct key will reveal long sections of legible plaintext interspersed by gibberish. Consequently, such ciphers may be vulnerable to optimum seeking algorithms such as [[genetic algorithm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;DOI:10.1080/0161-119391867863 Robert A. J. Matthews pages 187-201&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed description of the cryptanalysis of a German transposition cipher
can be found in chapter 7 of Herbert Yardley's "The American Black Chamber."

== Combinations ==
Transposition is often combined with other techniques such as evaluation methods. For example, a simple [[substitution cipher]] combined with a columnar transposition avoids the weakness of both. Replacing high frequency ciphertext symbols with high frequency plaintext letters does not reveal chunks of plaintext because of the transposition. Anagramming the transposition does not work because of the substitution. The technique is particularly powerful if combined with fractionation (see below). A disadvantage is that such ciphers are considerably more laborious and error prone than simpler ciphers.

== Fractionation ==
Transposition is particularly effective when employed with fractionation - that is, a preliminary stage that divides each plaintext symbol into several ciphertext symbols. For example, the plaintext alphabet could be written out in a grid, then every letter in the message replaced by its co-ordinates (see [[Polybius square]] and [[Straddling checkerboard]]). Another method of fractionation is to simply convert the message to [[Morse code]], with a symbol for spaces as well as dots and dashes.

When such a fractionated message is transposed, the components of individual letters become widely separated in the message, thus achieving [[Claude E. Shannon]]'s [[confusion and diffusion|diffusion]]. Examples of ciphers that combine fractionation and transposition include the [[bifid cipher]], the [[trifid cipher]], the [[ADFGVX cipher]] and the [[VIC cipher]].

Another choice would be to replace each letter with its binary representation, transpose that, and then convert the new binary string into the corresponding ASCII characters. Looping the scrambling process on the binary string multiple times before changing it into ASCII characters would likely make it harder to break. Many modern [[block cipher]]s use more complex forms of transposition related to this simple idea.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8940">In [[computer science]], a '''type signature''' or '''type annotation''' defines the inputs and outputs for a function, [[subroutine]] or [[Method (computer programming)|method]]. A type signature includes the number of arguments, the types of arguments and the order of the arguments contained by a function. A type signature is typically used during [[Type polymorphism|overload]] resolution for choosing the correct definition of a function to be called among many overloaded forms.

==Examples==
===C/C++===
In [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]], the type signature is [[Declaration (computer programming)|declared]] by what is commonly known as a [[function prototype]]. In C/C++, a function [[declaration reflects use|declaration reflects its use]]; for example, a [[function pointer]] that would be invoked as:
&lt;source lang=C&gt;
char c;
double d;
int retVal = (*fPtr)(c, d);
&lt;/source&gt;

has the signature:

&lt;source lang=C&gt;
(int) (char, double);
&lt;/source&gt;

===Erlang===
In [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]], type signatures may be optionally declared, as:
&lt;source lang=Erlang&gt;
-spec(function_name(type1(), type2(), ...) -&gt; out_type()).
&lt;/source&gt;

For example:
&lt;source lang=Erlang&gt;
-spec(is_even(number()) -&gt; boolean()).
&lt;/source&gt;

===Haskell===
A type signature in the [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell programming language]] is generally written in the following format:
&lt;source lang=Haskell&gt;
functionName :: arg1Type -&gt; arg2Type -&gt; ... -&gt; argNType
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that the type of the result can be regarded as everything past the first supplied argument. This is a consequence of [[currying]], which is made possible by Haskell's support for [[first-class function]]s; this function requires two inputs where one argument supplied and the function is "curried" to produce a function for the argument not supplied. Thus calling {{Haskell|f x}}, where {{Haskell|f :: a -&gt; b -&gt; c}}, yields a new function {{Haskell|f2 :: b -&gt; c}} that can be called {{Haskell|f2 b}} to produce {{Haskell|c}}.

The actual type specifications can consist of an actual type, such as {{Haskell|Integer}}, or a general [[type variable]] that is used in [[type polymorphism|parametric polymorphic]] [[function (programming)|functions]], such as {{Haskell|a}}, or {{Haskell|b}}, or {{Haskell|anyType}}. So we can write something like:
{{Haskell|functionName :: a -&gt; a -&gt; ... -&gt; a}}

Since Haskell supports [[higher-order function]]s, functions can be passed as arguments. This is written as:
{{Haskell|functionName :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a}}

This function takes in a function with type signature {{Haskell|a -&gt; a}} and returns data of type {{Haskell|a}} out.

===Java===
In the [[Java virtual machine]], ''internal type signatures'' are used to identify methods and classes at the level of the virtual machine code.

Example: The method {{Java|String String.substring(int, int)}} is represented in [[Java bytecode|bytecode]] as {{Java|Ljava/lang/String.substring(II)Ljava/lang/String;}}. The signature of &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method looks like this:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
&lt;/source&gt;

And in the disassembled bytecode, it takes the form of {{Java|Lsome/package/Main/main:([Ljava/lang/String;)V}}

The method signature for the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method contains three modifiers:

* &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method can be called by any object.
* &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method is a class method.
* &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method has no return value.

==Signature==
{{tone|section|date=October 2013}}
A function signature consists of the function prototype.  It specifies the general information about a function like the name, scope and parameters.  Many programming languages use [[name mangling]] in order to pass along more semantic information from the compilers to the linkers.  In addition to mangling, there is an excess of information in a function signature (stored internally to most compilers) which is not readily available, but may be accessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C++ Reference: Programming terms|url=http://www.cs.unm.edu/~storm/C++/ProgrammingTerms/FunctionSignatures.html|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding the notion of a function signature is an important concept for all computer science studies.
* Modern object orientation techniques make use of [[Java interface|interfaces]], which are essentially templates made from function signatures.
* C/C++ uses function overloading with various signatures.

The practice of [[multiple inheritance]] requires consideration of the function signatures to avoid unpredictable results.

Computer science theory, and the concept of [[Polymorphism in object-oriented programming|polymorphism]] in particular, make much use of the concept of function signature.

In the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] signature is roughly equivalent to its [[Function prototype|prototype definition]].

The term "signature" may carry other meanings in computer science. For example:
* [[File signature]]s can identify or verify the content of a file.
* Database signatures can identify or verify the schema or a version of a database.
* In the [[ML programming language|ML]] family of [[programming language]]s, "signature" is used as a keyword referring to a construct of the module system that plays the role of an [[interface (computer science)|interface]].

==Method signature==
{{See also|Function prototype}}

In [[computer programming]], especially [[object-oriented programming]], a [[Method (computer programming)|method]] is commonly identified by its unique '''method signature''', which usually includes the method name, and the number, types and order of its [[Parameter (computer programming)|parameters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title = Method Signature
| quote = A method signature is part of the method declaration. It is the combination of the method name and the parameter list.
| url = http://java.about.com/od/m/g/methodsignature.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A method signature is the smallest [[datatype|type]] of a method.

==Examples==
===C/C++===
In [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]], the method signature is the method name and the number and type of its [[parameter]]s, but it is possible to have a last parameter that consists of an array of values:
&lt;source lang=C&gt;
int printf(const char*, ... );
&lt;/source&gt;

Manipulation of these parameters can be done by using the routines in the standard library header [[stdarg.h|{{C-lang|&lt;stdarg.h&gt;}}]].

===C#===
Similar to the C syntax, [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] sees as the method signature its name and the number and type of its parameters, where the last parameter may be an array of values:&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=Csharp&gt;
void Add(out int sum, params int[] value);
[...]
Add(out sum, 3, 5, 7, 11, -1);  // sum == 25
&lt;/source&gt;

===Java===
In the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]], a method signature is the method name and the number, type and order of its parameters. Return types and thrown exceptions are not considered to be a part of the method signature. 
&lt;source lang=Java&gt;
methodName(parameters) {...};
break;
&lt;/source&gt;

For example, the following two methods have distinct signatures:
&lt;source lang=Java&gt;
doSomething(String[] y);
doSomething(String y);
&lt;/source&gt;

The following three methods do have the same signatures and are considered the same, as only the return value differs. The name of the parameter is not part of the method signature and is ignored by the compiler for checking method uniqueness.
&lt;source lang=Java&gt;
int doSomething(int y) 
String doSomething(int x)
int doSomething(int z) throws java.lang.Exception
&lt;/source&gt;

===Objective-C===
In the [[Objective-C]] programming language, method signatures for an object are declared in the interface header file. For example,
&lt;source lang=ObjC&gt;
- (id)initWithInt:(int)value;
&lt;/source&gt;

defines a method {{ObjC|initWithInt}} that returns a general object (an {{ObjC|id}}) and takes one integer argument. Objective-C only requires a type in a signature to be explicit when the type is not {{ObjC|id}}; this signature is equivalent:
&lt;source lang=ObjC&gt;
- initWithInt:(int)value;
&lt;/source&gt;

Physicists often uses various lattices to apply their favorite models in them. For instance, the most favorite lattice is perhaps the square lattice. There are 14 Bravais space lattice where every cell has exactly the same number of nearest, next nearest, nearest of next nearest etc neighbors and hence they are called regular lattice. Often physicists and mathematicians studies phenomena which requires disordered lattice where each cell do not have exactly the same number of neighbors rather the number of neighbors can vary wildly. For instance, if one want to study spread of disease, viruses, rumors etc then the last thing one would look for is the square lattice. In such cases a disordered lattice is necessary. One way of constructing a disordered lattice is by doing the following.

Starting with a square, say of unit area, and dividing randomly at each step only one block, after
picking it preferentially with respect to ares, into four smaller blocks creates '''weighted planar stochastic lattice (WPSL)'''. Essentially it is a disordered planar lattice as its block size and their coordination number are random.

==Description==
In applied mathematics, a '''weighted planar stochastic lattice (WPSL)''' is a structure that has properties in common with those of [[lattice (group)|lattices]] and those of [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]]. In general, space-filling planar cellular structures can be useful in a wide variety of seemingly disparate physical and biological systems.
Examples include grain in [[polycrystalline]] structures, cell texture and tissues in biology, acicular texture in [[martensite]] growth, [[tessellated pavement]] on ocean shores, soap froths
and agricultural land division according to ownership etc.&lt;ref&gt;M. Rao, S. Sengupta and H. K. Sahu Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 75}, 2164 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Okabe, B. Boots, K. Sugihara and S. N. Chiu, {\it Spatial Tessellations - 
Concepts and Applications of Voronoi Diagrams} (Chicester: Wiley, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Ben-Naim and P. L. Krapivsky,
Phys. Rev. Lett. '''76,''' 3234 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; The question of how these structures appear and the understanding of their topological and geometrical properties have always been an interesting proposition among scientists in general and physicists in particular.
Several models prescribe how to generate cellular structures. Often these
structures can mimic directly the structures found in nature and they are able to capture the essential properties that we find in natural structures. 
In general, cellular structures appear through random [[tessellation]], tiling, or 
subdivision of a plane into contiguous and non-overlapping cells. For instance, [[Voronoi diagram]] and [[Apollonian]] packing are 
formed by partitioning or tiling of a plane into contiguous and non-overlapping convex polygons and disks respectively.&lt;ref&gt;A. Okabe, B. Boots, K. Sugihara and S. N. Chiu, {\it Spatial Tessellations - 
Concepts and Applications of Voronoi Diagrams} (Chicester: Wiley, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Delaney, S. Hutzler and T. Aste,  Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 101} 120602 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular planar lattices like square lattices, triangular lattices, honeycomb lattices, etc., are the simplest example of the cellular structure in which every cell has exactly the same size and the same coordination number. The planar [[Voronoi diagram]], on the other hand, has neither a fixed cell size nor a fixed coordination number. Its coordination number distribution is rather [[Poisson distribution|Poissonian]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;M. M. de Oliveira, S. G. Alves, S. C. Ferreira, and R. Dickman, "Contact process on a Voronoi triangulation", Phys. Rev. E '''78''' 031133 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the distribution is peaked about the mean where it is almost impossible to find cells which have significantly higher or fewer coordination number than the mean. Recently, Hassan ''et al'' proposed a lattice, namely the weighted planar stochastic lattice. For instance, unlike a network or a graph, it has properties of lattices as its sites are spatially embedded. On the other hand, unlike lattices, its dual (obtained by considering the center of each block of the lattice as node and the common border between blocks as links) display the property of networks as its degree distribution follows a [[power law]]. Besides, unlike regular lattices, the sizes of its cells are not equal; rather, the distribution of the area size of its blocks obeys [[dynamic scaling]],&lt;ref&gt;F. R. Dayeen and M. K. Hassan “Multi-multifractality, dynamic scaling and neighbourhood statistics in weighted planar stochastic lattice” Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals '''91''' 228 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; whose coordination number distribution follows a power-law.&lt;ref&gt;M.

== Construction of WPSLs ==

The construction process of the WPSL can be described as follows. It starts with a square of unit area which we regard as an initiator. The generator then divides the initiator, in the first step, randomly with uniform probability into four smaller blocks. In the second step and thereafter, the generator is applied to only one of the blocks. The question is: How do we pick that block when there is more than one block? The most generic choice would be to pick preferentially according to their areas so that the higher the area the higher the probability to be picked. For instance, in step one, the generator divides the initiator randomly into four smaller blocks. Let us label their areas starting from the top left corner and moving clockwise as &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2, a_3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_4&lt;/math&gt;. But of course the way we label is totally arbitrary and will bear no consequence to the final results of any observable quantities. Note that &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; is the area of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th block which can be well regarded as the probability of picking the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th block. These probabilities are naturally normalized &lt;math&gt;\sum_i a_i=1&lt;/math&gt; since we choose the area of the initiator equal to one. In step two, we pick one of the four blocks preferentially with respect to their areas. Consider that we pick the block &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; and apply the generator onto it to divide it randomly into four smaller blocks. Thus the label &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; is now redundant and hence we recycle it to label the top left corner while the rest of three new blocks are labelled  &lt;math&gt;a_5, a_6&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_7&lt;/math&gt; in a clockwise fashion. In general, in the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th step, we pick one out of &lt;math&gt;3j-2&lt;/math&gt; blocks preferentially with respect to area and divide randomly into four blocks. The detailed algorithm can be found in Dayeen and Hassan&lt;ref&gt;F. R. Dayeen and M. K. Hassan “Multi-multifractality, dynamic scaling and neighbourhood statistics in weighted planar stochastic lattice” Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals '''91''' 228 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; and Hassan, Hassan, and Pavel.&lt;ref&gt;M. K. Hassan, M. Z. Hassan and N. I. Pavel, Scale-free coordination number disorder and multifractal size disorder in weighted planar stochastic lattice, J. Phys: Conf. Ser, '''297''' 012010 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

This process of lattice generation can also be described as follows. Consider that the substrate is a square of unit area and at each time step a seed is nucleated from which two orthogonal partitioning lines parallel to the sides of the substrate are grown until intercepted by existing lines. It results in partitioning the square into ever smaller mutually exclusive rectangular blocks. Note that the higher the area of a block, the higher is the probability that the seed will be nucleated in it to divide that into four smaller blocks since seeds are sown at random on the substrate. It can also describes kinetics of fragmentation of two-dimensional objects.&lt;ref&gt;P. L. Krapivsky, E. Ben-Naim, "Scaling and multiscaling in models of fragmentation", Phys. Rev. E '''50''' 3502 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. L. Krapivsky, S. Redner and E. Ben_naim, ''A kinetic View of Statistical Physics'' (Cambridge University Press, New York, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties of WPSLs ==

* The dynamics of the growth of this lattice is governed by infinitely many conservation laws, one of which is the trivial conservation of total area.
* Each of the non-trivial conservation laws can be used as a multifractal measure and hence it is also a multi-multifractal ([[multifractal system]]).
* The area size distribution function of its blocks obeys [[dynamic scaling]].
* It can be mapped as a network if we consider the center of each block as a node and the common border between block as the link between the center of the corresponding nodes. The [[degree distribution]] of the resulting network exhibits power-law ([[scale-free network]]). In 1999 Barabasi and Albert argued that growth and preferential attachment (PA) rule are the two basic ingredients behind power-law degree distribution. In the case of WPSL, presence of one of the ingredients is obvious. What about the PA rule. A closer look at the growth process of the WPSL suggest that a block gain new neighbor only if one of its neighbor is picked and divided. Thus the higher the number of neighbors a block has, the higher is the chances that it will gain more neighbors. In fact, the ([[Mediation-driven attachment model]]) embodies exactly this idea. In this model too PA rule is present but in disguise!
* It exhibits multiscaling.

Before 2000 [[epidemic models]], for instance, were studying by applying them on regular lattices like square lattice assuming that everyone can infect everyone else in the same way.
The emergence of a network-based framework has brought a fundamental change, offering a much much better pragmatic skeleton than any time before. Today epidemic models is one of the most active applications of network science, being used to foresee the spread of influenza or to contain Ebola. The WPSL can be a good candidate for applying epidemic like models since it has the properties 
of graph or network and the properties of traditional lattice as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10033">In [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]], '''Wigner's classification'''
is a classification of the [[nonnegative]] (''E'' ≥ 0) [[energy]] [[Irreducible representation|irreducible unitary representation]]s of the [[Poincaré group]] which have sharp{{definition|date=October 2016}} mass [[eigenvalue]]s. (Since this group is noncompact, these unitary representations are infinite-dimensional.)
It was introduced by [[Eugene Wigner]], to classify particles and fields in physics—see the article [[particle physics and representation theory]]. It relies on the stabilizer subgroups of that group, dubbed the '''[[Group action#Fixed points and stabilizer subgroups|Wigner little groups]]''' of various mass states.

The [[Casimir invariant]]s of the Poincaré group are {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''P''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;''P''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where {{mvar|P}} is the [[4-momentum operator]], and {{math|1=''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''W''&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt;''W''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where {{mvar|W}} is the [[Pauli&amp;ndash;Lubanski pseudovector]]. The eigenvalues of these operators serve to label the representations. The first is associated with mass-squared and the second with [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]] or [[spin (physics)|spin]]. 

The physically relevant representations may thus be classified according to whether {{math|''m'' &gt; 0}} ;  {{math|''m''  {{=}} 0}}  but {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0}};  and {{math|''m'' {{=}} 0}} with {{math| ''P''&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 0}}. Wigner found that massless particles are fundamentally different from massive particles.

*For the first case, note that the [[eigenspace]] (see [[generalized eigenspaces of unbounded operators]]) associated with {{math|''P'' {{=}}(''m,0,0,0'')}}  is a [[Representations of Lie groups/algebras|representation]] of [[Special orthogonal group|SO(3)]]. In the [[Projective representation|ray interpretation]], one can go over to [[Spin group|Spin(3)]] instead. So, massive states are classified by an irreducible Spin(3) [[Unitary representation|unitary]] representation that characterizes their [[spin (physics)|spin]], and a positive mass, {{mvar|m}}.
*For the second case, look at the [[stabilizer (group theory)|stabilizer]] of   {{math|''P'' {{=}}(''k,0,0,-k'')}}. This is the [[Double covering group|double cover]] of [[Euclidean group|SE(2)]] (see [[unit ray representation]]). We have two cases, one where [[irrep]]s are described by an integral multiple of 1/2 called the [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]], and the other called the "continuous spin" representation.
*The last case describes the [[vacuum]]. The only finite-dimensional unitary solution is the [[trivial representation]] called the vacuum.

==Massive scalar fields ==

As an example, let us visualize the irreducible unitary representation with {{math|''m'' &gt; 0}} and {{math|''s'' {{=}} 0}}. It corresponds to the space of [[scalar field|massive scalar field]]s.

Let {{mvar|M}} be the hyperboloid sheet defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;P_0^2-P_1^2-P_2^2-P_3^2 = m^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P_0&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

The Minkowski metric restricts to a [[Riemannian metric]] on {{mvar|M}}, giving {{mvar|M}} the metric structure of a [[hyperbolic space]], in particular it is the [[hyperboloid model]] of hyperbolic space,  see [[Minkowski space#Geometry|geometry of Minkowski space]] for proof. The Poincare group {{mvar|''P''}} acts on {{mvar|M}} because (forgetting the action of the translation subgroup {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} with addition inside {{mvar|P}}) it preserves the [[Minkowski inner product]], and an element {{mvar|x}} of the translation subgroup {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} of the Poincare group acts on {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(M)}} by multiplication by suitable phase multipliers {{math|exp(−''i'' ''p''·''x'')}}, where {{math|''p'' ∈ ''M''}}. These two actions can be combined in a clever way using [[induced representations]] to obtain an action    
of {{mvar|P}} on {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(M)}} that combines motions of {{mvar|M}} and phase multiplication.

This yields an action of the Poincare group on the space of square-integrable functions defined on the hypersurface {{mvar|M}} in Minkowski space. These may be viewed as measures defined on Minkowski space that are concentrated on the set {{mvar|M}} defined by

:&lt;math&gt;E^2-P_1^2-P_2^2-P_3^2 = m^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E\equiv P_0&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;

The Fourier transform (in all four variables) of such measures yields positive-energy,{{clarify|reason=What does this mean?|date=October 2016}} finite-energy solutions of the [[Klein–Gordon equation]] defined on Minkowski space, namely

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} \psi - \nabla^2 \psi + m^2 \psi = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

without physical units. In this way, the {{math|''m'' &gt; 0, ''s'' {{=}} 0}} irreducible representation of the Poincare group is realized by its action on a suitable space of solutions of a linear wave equation.

==The theory of projective representations==
Physically, one is interested in irreducible [[projective representation|''projective'' unitary representations]] of the Poincaré group. After all, two vectors in the quantum Hilbert space that differ by multiplication by a constant represent the same physical state. Thus, two unitary operators that differ by a multiple of the identity have the same action on physical states. Therefore the unitary operators that represent Poincaré symmetry are only defined up to a constant—and therefore the group composition law need only hold up to a constant. 

According to [[Projective_representation#Infinite-dimensional_projective_unitary_representations:_Bargmann's_theorem|Bargmann's theorem]], every projective unitary representation of the Poincaré group comes for an ordinary unitary representation of its universal cover, which is a double cover. (Bargmann's theorem applies because the double cover of the [[Poincaré group]] admits no non-trivial one-dimensional [[Group extension#Central extension|central extension]]s.) 

Passing to the double cover is important because it allows for fractional spin cases. In the positive mass case, for example, the little group is SU(2) rather than SO(3); the representations of SU(2) then include both integer and fractional spin cases.

Since the general criterion in Bargmann's theorem was not known when Wigner did his classification, he needed to show by hand (Section 5 of the paper) that the phases can be chosen in the operators to reflect the composition law in the group, up to a sign, which is then accounted for by passing the to double cover of the Poincaré group.

==Further information==
Left out from this classification are [[tachyon]]ic solutions, solutions with no fixed mass, [[infraparticle]]s with no fixed mass, etc. Such solutions are of physical importance, when considering virtual states. A celebrated example is the case of [[Deep inelastic scattering]], in which a virtual space-like [[photon]] is exchanged between the incoming [[lepton]] and the incoming [[hadron]]. This justifies the introduction of transversely and longitudinally-polarized photons, and of the related concept of transverse and longitudinal structure functions, when considering these virtual states as effective probes of the internal quark and gluon contents of the hadrons. From a mathematical point of view, one considers the SO(2,1) group instead of the usual [[SO(3)]] group encountered in the usual massive case discussed above. This explain the occurrence of two transverse polarization vectors &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_T^{\lambda=1,2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_L&lt;/math&gt;
which satisfy &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_T^2=-1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_L^2=+1&lt;/math&gt;, to be compared with the usual case of a free &lt;math&gt;Z_0&lt;/math&gt; boson which has three polarization vectors &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_T^{\lambda=1,2,3}&lt;/math&gt;, each of them satisfying &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_T^2=-1&lt;/math&gt;.
