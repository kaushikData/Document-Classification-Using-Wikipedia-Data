'''Abu Ali ibn Muhammad''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: ابو علی بن محمد) was the king of the [[Ghurid dynasty]]. He succeeded his father [[Muhammad ibn Suri]] in 1011, after the latter was deposed by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], who then sent teachers to teach about [[Islam]] in [[Ghor]]. Abu Ali was one of those who converted to Islam during that period. After his conversion to Islam from [[Buddhism]],&lt;ref name="Chandra"&gt;Medieval India Part 1 Satish Chandra Page 22&lt;/ref&gt; he began constructing [[mosques]] and [[madrassas]]. In ca. 1035, Abu Ali was overthrown by his nephew [[Abbas ibn Shith]].&lt;ref&gt;''History of Civilizations of Central Asia'', C.E. Bosworth, M.S. Asimov, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]], '''action at a distance''' is the concept that an object can be moved, changed, or otherwise affected without being physically touched (as in mechanical contact) by another object. That is, it is the nonlocal interaction of objects that are separated in space.

This term was used most often in the context of early theories of [[gravity]] and [[electromagnetism]] to describe how an object responds to the influence of distant objects. For example, [[Coulomb's law]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] are such early theories. 

More generally "action at a distance" describes the failure of early [[atomism|atomistic]] and [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic theories]] which sought to reduce all physical interaction to collision. The exploration and resolution of this problematic phenomenon led to significant developments in physics, from the concept of a field, to descriptions of [[quantum entanglement]] and the [[gauge boson|mediator particle]]s of the [[Standard Model]].&lt;ref name="Hesse"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Action at a Distance in Classical Physics |author=Hesse, Mary B. |authorlink=Mary Hesse |jstor=227576 |date=December 1955 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electricity and magnetism==
Efforts to account for action at a distance in the theory of electromagnetism led to the development of the concept of a [[field (physics)|field]] which mediated interactions between currents and charges across empty space. According to field theory we account for the [[Coulomb]] (electrostatic) interaction between charged particles through the fact that charges produce around themselves an [[electric field]], which can be felt by other charges as a force. [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] directly addressed the subject of action-at-a-distance in chapter 23 of his [[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]] in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Clerk Maxwell|Clerk Maxwell]] (1873) [https://archive.org/details/atreatiseonelec00maxwgoog A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism], pages 426 to 38, link from [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt; He began by reviewing the explanation of [[Ampere's force law|Ampere's formula]] given by [[Gauss]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Weber]]. On page 437 he indicates the physicists' disgust with action at a distance. In 1845 Gauss wrote to Weber desiring "action, not instantaneous, but propagated in time in a similar manner to that of light." This aspiration was developed by Maxwell with the theory of an [[electromagnetic field]] described by [[Maxwell's equations]], which used the field to elegantly account for all electromagnetic interactions, as well as light (which, until then, had been seen as a completely unrelated phenomenon). In Maxwell's theory, the field is its own physical entity, carrying momenta and energy across space, and action-at-a-distance is only the apparent effect of local interactions of charges with their surrounding field.

Electrodynamics was later described without fields (in [[Minkowski space]])  as the direct interaction of particles with [[Lightlike#Causal structure|lightlike]] separation vectors {{Dubious|date=August 2015}}. This resulted in the Fokker-Tetrode-Schwarzschild action integral. This kind of electrodynamic theory is often called "direct interaction" to distinguish it from field theories where action at a distance is mediated by a localized field (localized in the sense that its dynamics are determined by the nearby field parameters).&lt;ref&gt;Barut, A. O. "Electrodynamics and Classical Theory of Fields and Particles"&lt;/ref&gt; This description of electrodynamics, in contrast with Maxwell's theory, explains apparent action at a distance not by postulating a mediating entity (the field) but by appealing to the natural geometry of special relativity.

Direct interaction electrodynamics is explicitly symmetrical in time, and avoids the infinite energy predicted in the field immediately surrounding point particles.  Feynman and Wheeler have shown that it can account for radiation and [[radiative damping]] (which had been considered strong evidence for the independent existence of the field). However, various proofs, beginning with that of [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]], have shown that direct interaction theories (under reasonable assumptions) do not admit [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] or [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formulations (these are the so-called [[No Interaction Theorems]]). Also significant is the measurement and theoretical description of the [[Lamb shift]]  which strongly suggests that charged particles interact with their own field.  Fields, because of these and other difficulties, have been elevated to the fundamental operators in [[Quantum Field Theory|QFT]] and modern physics has thus largely abandoned direct interaction theory.

==Gravity==
{{Main article|Speed of gravity}}

===Newton===
[[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s classical theory of gravity offered no prospect of identifying any mediator of gravitational interaction. His theory assumed that gravitation acts instantaneously, regardless of distance. &lt;!--Newton had shown mathematically that if the gravitational interaction is not instantaneous, [[angular momentum]] is not conserved,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} and--&gt; [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s observations gave strong evidence that in planetary motion angular momentum is conserved. (The mathematical proof is only valid in the case of a [[Euclidean geometry]].) Gravity is also known as a force of attraction between two objects because of their mass.

From a Newtonian perspective, action at a distance can be regarded as: "a phenomenon in which a change in intrinsic properties of one system induces a change in the intrinsic properties of a distant system, independently of the influence of any other systems on the distant system, and without there being a process that carries this influence contiguously in space and time" (Berkovitz 2008).&lt;ref name="sep-qm-action-distance"/&gt;

A related question, raised by [[Ernst Mach]], was how rotating bodies know how much to bulge at the equator. This, it seems, requires an action-at-a-distance from distant matter, informing the rotating object about the state of the universe. Einstein coined the term [[Mach's principle]] for this question.

{{quote|It is inconceivable that inanimate Matter should, without the Mediation of something else, which is not material, operate upon, and affect other matter without mutual Contact…That Gravity should be innate, inherent and essential to Matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance thro' a Vacuum, without the Mediation of any thing else, by and through which their Action and Force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an Absurdity that I believe no Man who has in philosophical Matters a competent Faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an Agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this Agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the Consideration of my readers.&lt;ref name="sep-qm-action-distance"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Joseph |last=Berkovitz |editor=Edward N. Zalta |year=2008 |title=Action at a Distance in Quantum Mechanics |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Winter 2008 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/qm-action-distance/#ActDisCoExiNonSepHol}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Isaac Newton|Letters to Bentley, 1692/3}}

For further discussion see Ducheyne, S. Newton on Action at a Distance. Journal of the History of Philosophy vol. 52.4 (2014): 675-702.

===Einstein===
According to [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[special relativity]], ''instantaneous action at a distance'' violates the relativistic [[Speed of light#Upper limit on speeds|upper limit on speed]] of propagation of information. If one of the interacting objects were to suddenly be displaced from its position, the other object would feel its influence instantaneously, meaning information had been transmitted faster than the [[speed of light]].

One of the conditions that a relativistic theory of gravitation must meet is that gravity is mediated with a speed that does not exceed {{math|'''''c'''''}}, the speed of light in a vacuum. From the previous success of electrodynamics, it was foreseeable that the relativistic theory of gravitation would have to use the concept of a field, or something similar.

This has been achieved by Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]], in which gravitational interaction is mediated by deformation of space-time geometry. Matter warps the geometry of space-time, and these effects are—as with electric and magnetic fields—propagated at the speed of light. Thus, in the presence of matter, space-time becomes [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]], resolving the apparent conflict between Newton's proof of the conservation of angular momentum and Einstein's theory of [[special relativity]].

Mach's question regarding the bulging of rotating bodies is resolved because local space-time geometry is informing a rotating body about the rest of the universe. In Newton's theory of motion, space acts on objects, but is not acted upon. In Einstein's theory of motion, matter acts upon space-time geometry, deforming it; and space-time geometry acts upon matter, by affecting the behavior of [[geodesic]]s.

As a consequence, and unlike the classical theory, general relativity predicts that accelerating masses emit [[gravitational wave]]s, i.e. disturbances in the curvature of spacetime that propagate outward at lightspeed. Their existence (like [[Tests of general relativity|many other aspects of relativity]]) has been [[Gravitational wave#Detection|experimentally confirmed]] by astronomers—most dramatically in the [[First observation of gravitational waves|direct detection of gravitational waves]] originating from a [[black hole merger]] when they passed through [[LIGO#Advanced LIGO|LIGO]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.mit.edu/2016/ligo-first-detection-gravitational-waves-0211&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantum mechanics==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Time travel]] --&gt;
{{See also|Quantum nonlocality}}
Since the early twentieth century, [[quantum mechanics]] has posed new challenges for the view that physical processes should obey [[Principle of locality|locality]]. Whether [[quantum entanglement]] counts as action-at-a-distance hinges on the nature of the [[wave function]] and [[decoherence]], issues over which there is still considerable debate among scientists and philosophers. One important line of debate originated with Einstein, who challenged the idea that quantum mechanics offers a complete description of reality, along with [[Boris Podolsky]] and [[Nathan Rosen]]. They proposed a [[thought experiment]] involving an entangled pair of observables with non-commuting operators (e.g. position and momentum).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.47.777 |title=Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete? |year=1935 |last1=Einstein |first1=A. |last2=Podolsky |first2=B. |last3=Rosen |first3=N. |journal=Physical Review |volume=47 |issue=10 |pages=777–780|bibcode = 1935PhRv...47..777E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This thought experiment, which came to be known as the [[EPR paradox]], hinges on the principle of locality. A common presentation of the paradox is as follows: two particles interact and fly off in opposite directions. Even when the particles are so far apart that any classical interaction would be impossible (see [[principle of locality]]), a measurement of one particle nonetheless determines the corresponding result of a measurement of the other.

After the EPR paper, several scientists such as [[de Broglie]] studied [[hidden variable theory|local hidden variables theories]]. In the 1960s [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] derived an inequality that indicated a testable difference between the predictions of quantum mechanics and local [[hidden variable theory|hidden variables]] theories.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, J.S. (1966). On the problem of hidden variables in quantum mechanics. Reviews of Modern Physics. 38(3). 447-452.&lt;/ref&gt;  To date, all [[Bell test experiments|experiments]] testing Bell-type inequalities in situations analogous to the EPR thought experiment have results consistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics, suggesting that local hidden variables theories can be ruled out. Whether or not this is interpreted as evidence for [[quantum nonlocality|nonlocality]] depends on one's [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref name="sep-qm-action-distance"/&gt;

Non-standard interpretations of quantum mechanics vary in their response to the EPR-type experiments. The [[Bohm interpretation]] gives an explanation based on nonlocal hidden variables for the correlations seen in entanglement. Many advocates of the [[many-worlds interpretation]] argue that it can explain these correlations in a way that does not require a violation of locality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rubin |title=Locality in the Everett Interpretation of Heisenberg-Picture Quantum Mechanics |year=2001 |pages=301–322 |volume=14 |journal=Found. Phys. Lett. |arxiv=quant-ph/0103079 |doi=10.1023/A:1012357515678 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; by allowing measurements to have non-unique outcomes.

'''''Aftermath: Population Zero''''' (also titled '''''Aftermath: The World After Humans''''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ca/ontv/titledetails.aspx?titleid=114079 ''Aftermath: The World After Humans''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719201916/http://www.history.ca/ontv/titledetails.aspx?titleid=114079 |date=July 19, 2011 }} on [[History Television]]&lt;/ref&gt; is a two-hour Canadian [[TV special|special]] [[documentary film]] that premiered on Sunday, March 9, 2008 (at 8:00 PM ET/PT) on the [[National Geographic Channel]]. The program was produced by [[Cream Productions]].

Similar to the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]'s special ''[[Life After People]]'', ''Aftermath'' features what [[scientist]]s and others speculate the [[earth]], [[fauna|animal life]], and [[flora|plant life]] might be like if [[human extinction|humanity no longer existed]], as well as the effect that humanity's disappearance would have on the artifacts of [[civilization]].
Both documentaries are inspired by Alan Weisman's ''[[The World Without Us]]''.

A follow-up 4-part TV series was created, ''[[Aftermath (History TV)|Aftermath]]'', following different scenarios and what happens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/aftermath |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329164957/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/aftermath |archivedate=2010-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Timeline ==
The story begins on Friday, June 13, in an unspecified year. The nature of the show and the appearance of certain vehicles suggest that it takes place in 2008, the year the program was first aired (and when June 13 of that year did indeed [[Friday the 13th|fall on a Friday]]).

A.H. = After Humans

The story speculates that humanity has disappeared instantly.

===(1 second-1 minute A.H.)===
Millions of empty cars spin out of control and crash, while others swerve off roads and highways. Other vehicles crash, including buses in Trafalgar Square. All empty vehicles eventually crash, causing accidents all across the globe. The highways are blocked with smashed and burning vehicles. Stationary cars continue to release exhaust fumes into the air until their fuel supplies run out. Cities have begun to cool down by a fraction of a degree. Small aircraft fall out of the sky, while larger ones remain in the air until their fuel runs out.

===(10 minutes A.H.)===
Computer systems and machines stay operational. Satellites in orbit communicate with super-computers and continue to transmit information around the globe. The machines will keep going as long as the electricity stays on. But all the fuel is used up in coal power plants. The electricity runs out and the power plants shut down. Billions of buildings supplied that get their energy from them, such as [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] [[casino]]s, fall into darkness. Entire suburbs go dark. Homes, schools, hospitals and cafes are now all without power.

===(55 minutes A.H.)===
Certain regions rely on alternative energy sources, like [[Pennsylvania]], which is powered by [[wind turbine]]s. The turbines are still running, but at the local power station, the controls are unmanned. Computers detect a problem and shut down the system. Pennsylvania is now without electricity.

===(85 minutes A.H.)===
At Niagara Falls, Canada, water from the river is diverted into tunnels to turn massive wheels to create power, but now, the tunnels flood with excessive water and the power station goes offline. Parts of Ontario and New York lose all of their power. Televisions, computers, lights and other machines stop running. Mass blackouts sweep across the globe.

===(96 minutes A.H.)===
Within just one day, only [[nuclear power plant]]s remain operational. The permanent loss of power reaches the nuclear power plants. Computers shut off the reactors and stop the reactions inside, but the nuclear power plants could cause a potential catastrophe.

===(6 hours A.H.)===
The last power plants in Europe fail, and the last houses go dark as lights fail. Chemical plants now have no power. Many stored gases require electricity to be cold enough to stay in liquid form. Gas storage tanks heat up until pressure release valves are activated, sending toxic gases into the surrounding environment. Hundreds of thousands of venting tanks cause many animals in the affected regions to die of suffocation.

===(1-2 days A.H.)===
Houses and apartments are still inhabited by family pets The domestic animals are getting hungry. Chained [[dog]]s try to get free. [[Cat]]s and dogs raid refrigerators and cupboards for food and drink water from toilets. The global power loss reaches the world's zoos and safari parks, and starving animals test the fences. Without electric fencing to contain them, predators escape and explore this new world.

Also, liquefied natural gas plants are venting gases which reach stationary cars. Eventually, sparks ignite petrol in fuel tanks and the fuel catches fire. This causes huge explosions, igniting multiple fires that will rage for days.

===(3-5 days A.H.)===
In [[London]], England, [[Big Ben]] rings for the last time. The clock tower needs to be wound every three days to remain ticking, but with no one to wind it, it finally grinds to a halt. In homes and apartments, domestic pets are starving. Now they must break out of their homes or starve to death.

Pet dogs and cats exhaust all the food in their homes and break out to search for more in the streets. Cats adapt quickly to hunting. Sewage treatment facilities fail without electricity, leaving sewage treatment plants useless. Raw sewage begins polluting rivers and lakes. Abandoned dogs struggle to survive.

In farms and pastures all over the world, [[Dairy cattle|dairy cows]] are struggling to survive as their food and water supplies begin to end. In a cruel twist of fate, 90,000 dairy cows are saved from the slaughterhouse, but most of their numbers will die of dehydration. Zoo animals face a similar fate as many will die trapped in their enclosures.

Some exotic animals break out of their enclosures through disabled electric fences. [[Elephant]]s start pruning the suburbs of vegetation in a desperate search for food, whilst hardier animals like [[camel]]s browse on all available vegetation. [[Lion]]s and [[tiger]]s fan out into the streets to hunt but find hunting challenging in the city as they are not adapted for life in an urban setting.

Migratory birds find travelling easier now since electric lights from office towers and skyscrapers do not confuse them anymore.

===(5-10 days A.H.)===
As days pass, domestic dogs eat all easily available food and begin to fight amongst each other for supremacy. The bigger dogs make packs and attack and eat the small ones. Within a week, all [[toy dog]]s disappear from Earth. Large packs of dogs also feed on dead penned up cattle.

Security measures in power plants fail. The equipment in the spent fuel buildings adjoining nuclear power plants that maintain the temperature level of the spent nuclear fuel rods will shut down. [[Spent nuclear fuel]] for [[nuclear power plants]] is generally stored in pools in on-site facilities. Because the fossil fuel powered back up, power generators will run out. At that time, the cooling pools that prevent the spent nuclear fuel from overheating will start to boil since this water is not replenished.

Radioactive steam will vent into the atmosphere due to the water eventually evaporating. The spent fuel will eventually set fire to the building, and the [[steam]] pressure will cause the storage facilities to explode, causing a (non nuclear) explosion, emitting radiation not only in the immediate area of the plant but around the globe due to winds.  The resulting [[nuclear disaster]]s spread fallout over large areas. This is repeated dozens of times as shutdown nuclear plants and spent fuel houses explode. [[Radioactive cloud]]s cross the skies and [[rain]] carries the [[radiation]] to the ground. Most plants and smaller animals within the affected zones die. Larger animals (like [[deer]]) flee to unaffected regions, not because they notice the radiation, but because of the lack of food.

===(10 days-1 month A.H.)===
Hungry dogs from cities flee to the countryside to feast on dead dairy cows. Six days after their water and food supplies began ending, dairy cows have completely finished them and died. Now, their rotting carcasses will do nothing more than sustain hungry dogs. On the other hand, not all cows are dead. [[Beef cattle]] survive and form herds that thrive in places like the [[North America]]n [[Great Plains]] and the open pastures in the middle-eastern U.S.

The last domestic [[chicken]]s are exterminated by predators, while fowl such as some domestic game, [[Guineafowl|guineas]], and [[peafowl]] are still alive. [[Mice]] and [[rat]]s take over abandoned [[supermarket]]s, where their population explodes thanks to the abundance of food. This pattern will continue for the next few months until the reduction of food and the action of [[predator]]s like [[cat]]s regulates their populations again. [[Squirrel]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[coyote]]s and [[skunk]]s begin to colonize human buildings.

===(3 Months A.H.)===
Radiation disappears from the air. In cities, air quality and visibility is improved. Packs of [[feral|feral dogs]] roam the countryside. Desperate for food, they attack anything, even escaped elephants, but they don't have any success. Without humans, elephants have no real predators anymore. Meanwhile, the descendants of pet cats are thriving in supermarkets and grocery stores by feasting on mice and rats.

===(6 Months A.H.)===
Winter begins in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Zoo animals that cannot survive it, such as elephants, must migrate to southern latitudes or die. Meanwhile, without artificial heating, [[cockroach]]es die by the billions. Animals from the forests seek refuge in human homes. During their stay, they damage furniture in the buildings while constructing their own temporary homes to shelter from the cold.

===(10-12 months A.H.)===
Spring rains wash away the radioactive particles from the surface and carry it further into the ground, cleaning plants and objects. Meanwhile, new plants and trees remove the artificial [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] from the atmosphere as the new plants and flowers sprout in ruined cities and clean up greenhouses faster than in the human time. Without [[hunting season]]s, animals breed undisturbed. Some species in areas with no natural predators, like the [[white tail deer]], see [[population boom]]s and expand their distribution to new areas, including former cities. [[Moss]] starts to grow over roads.
Large carnivores are human shy, but without the lights or noise made by humans they would penetrate urban areas from the nearby hills or reserves and hunt the domesticated animals. Also the houses may make wonderful dens, which means that animals like [[Cougar|puma]]s and tigers would have population explosions. Depending on the area many common species, such as the White tailed deer would have population decreases due to loss of maintained food supply (e.g. lawns, golf courses, gardens) and increased predation.

===(3 to 15 years A.H.)===
With no maintenance and the ice of multiple winters, roads appear degraded and cracked. Moss covers their surfaces, and grass grows in the cracks. New trees grow in home gardens. Vehicles and other metallic structures begin to succumb to corrosion that strips away paint and protective coatings, resulting in rust that eats through metal. Many of the 1 billion automobiles will soon degrade into hollow husks.

===(30 years A.H.)===
Devastated by [[solar wind]]s, [[artificial satellites]] return to Earth in the form of shooting stars. Some of their pieces make it to the ground and start some fires. These satellites have been spiralling to Earth for the last 30 years but now, with the batteries dead and any stationkeeping fuel expended, atmospheric drag causes them to plummet to the ground.

Roofs on houses collapse, allowing trees to grow in their interior. Many homes begin to collapse and fall apart as rotting walls and timbers succumb to rot and rain damage. Broken window panes that blew out long ago allow in dust and debris. Scoured by [[hurricane]] after hurricane, the [[East Coast of the United States]] is slowly cleaned of buildings. Southern states like [[Florida]] are completely swept away. In the [[ocean]], the remains of former [[ship]]s serve as foundations for the formation of [[coral reefs]].

[[Cereal]] fields are turned into grasslands or overrun by expanding forests. The same happens to cities as grass and trees take root on streets and buildings. In New York City, [[Central Park]] is getting bigger, taking over [[Times Square]] where layers of mounting soil and plant growth cover up automobiles and the surrounding buildings. Panes of window glass fall from buildings to the streets as the clips holding the windows in their frames rust and crack.

[[Birds of prey]] such as [[hawk]]s and [[eagle]]s make their [[nest]]s and hunt [[rodent]]s in [[skyscraper]]s. Paint is weathered away after years of exposure to rain. [[Metal]] in cars and other human structures is exposed to [[oxidation]] and disintegration. Packs of feral dogs roam the crumbling cities whilst more exotic additions, such as tigers, return and thrive. Large animals are thriving once more in the ruins of cities. Moisture causes concrete to collapse.

In northern cities, gutted skyscrapers and buildings are filled with rainwater and snow. Rain pours through floors and rots ceilings. The changing seasons only adds pressure to the buildings. Rainwater seeps into cracks in concrete columns, pillars, and walls, and then it freezes in winter before thawing again in spring. These repeated freeze-thaw cycles split and crack concrete. Metal bars inside concrete gave it its strength, but when water reaches the bars, they expand and crack the concrete. Finally, the support columns give way and the buildings topple. The upper floors rain down, smashing lower floors until the buildings crumble to the ground. Most buildings suffer the same fate. [[Skyscrapers]] around the world begin to collapse. Concrete structures such as train stations begin to fall down as the roofs give way and the support columns break.

===(60 years A.H.)===
Sea life has completely recovered from [[overfishing]] and thrives. Though there are still dogs, specific [[dog breeds]] do not exist anymore, erased by generations of free reproduction, with a wide variety of mixed-breeds and [[mongrel]]s taking their place. In [[Europe]], the largely decreased [[wolf]] population expands into the countries where it was completely exterminated. Upon reaching the ruins of cities, wolves come into contact with feral dogs, competing with them for food and breeding with them, erasing the last traces of [[domestication]]. There they hunt deer that are expanding their territories into cities now overtaken by grasses and tree growth.

===(75 years A.H.)===
Most cars have now fallen apart. Synthetic plastic and rubber tires could last for centuries, whilst the body rusts, and the interior and seats disintegrate and fall apart.

===(120 years A.H.)===
The oceans and plants begin scrubbing the Earth clean of anthropogenic carbon dioxide.

===(150 years A.H.)===
Winters are colder than in the last days of the human race. Northern cities like Vancouver are slowly buried under layers of building snow and ice. Remains of ships and bridges form [[dam]]s in the [[Thames]], flooding the ruins of [[London]] and turning the British capital back into the [[swamp]] it was before [[Roman Empire|Roman times]]. The [[Houses of Parliament]] and the Clock Tower of [[Big Ben]] still stand amongst the marshy ruins. Cattle and frogs thrive. [[Imperial Valley]], once the biggest producer of fruits in the [[United States]], returns to a sandy desert. The fruits and vegetable crops grown here were irrigated with water pumped in through a pipe system from the Colorado River, but now the piping has been dry for over a century and the crop fields have been lost. The buildings in the region still stand, but all the wheat crops have withered away. Dry winds still maintain most of [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]'s buildings intact. After the power went off, the fountains, taps, and pools ran dry, and with only a few inches of rainfall a year, desert sands are beginning to sweep in and engulf the city. They serve as a refuge for [[vulture]]s and desert [[lizard]]s now.

===(200 years A.H.)===
Excessive water pressure destroys most of the dams on the [[Colorado River]]. The [[Hoover Dam]] still survives. Over 300 miles behind it, lies the [[Glen Canyon Dam]]. In spring, rising temperatures trigger surging floodwater from melting snow and ice that races towards the dam. It reaches the Glen Canyon Dam, the spillways let some of the water out, but the tunnels built into the dam fill with high pressure bubbles that cause high pressure explosions and eat through the dam. Concrete ramps once prevented this, but now they have rusted into wrecks combined with water seeping through the cracks causing erosion. This causes the dam to ultimately collapse. the flood races downstream towards the Hoover Dam. The flood simply flows over the dam, forming a roaring cascade of water that thunders downstream, sweeping away other dams and overwhelming everything in the way. For the first time in centuries, the Colorado River once again reaches the [[Gulf of California]] as a flood, not a stream, and revitalizes to a vast [[estuary]] full of animal life.

The coast of Louisiana is reshaped as the Mississippi River is freed from the dams' grip. Old [[codfish]] reach six feet long. All [[whale]] species have recovered to their pre-human populations. Without the interference of noisy naval alarms, they can hear the mating calls of other whales from 2000 miles away. Remains of large ships appear on beaches all over the world after two centuries of errant journeys over (and under) the waves. Plants and trees completely eliminate the excess CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere.

===(230 years A.H.)===
Corrosion from rainwater, ice and lightning strikes has completely ravaged the upper half of the [[Eiffel Tower]], and the iron is rusted through and teetering. A strong wind collapses it, and falls into the new marsh on the River [[Seine]] that has flooded the remnants of Paris. Thousands of wild boar (descendants of both the [[domestic pig]] and [[wild boar]]) live under the Tower's legs. The right arm of the [[Statue of Liberty]] falls to the ground. The head cracks off and follows the arm some time later. The iron that makes up its skeleton has rusted through, and both parts were too weak to stay up, but its skin of copper plates is cleaner now than before due to cleaner skies and less tarnishing.

Thick forests of trees over 90 feet tall completely cover the eastern half of North America. Human structures still survive under forest [[humus]]. From time to time rains and rivers wash away humus, uncovering concrete beams, [[plastic]]s, [[cellphone]]s and [[stainless steel]] objects. Tens of millions of reindeer, [[bison]], [[cattle]] and [[horse]]s make up gigantic herds in the Western North American plains. The [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] is buried again in the sands of the [[Sahara]] to survive for thousands of years in preservation, just as it had done for thousands of years before it was rediscovered for the first time.

===(500 years A.H.)===
Forests return to the state they had 10,000 years ago.

===(1,000 years A.H.)===
The [[Eiffel Tower]] has lost all but its four legs. The rest of it has fallen down and been covered by soil and vegetation. The [[Statue of Liberty]] has fallen to pieces, and only its pedestal still stands, but this concrete pedestal could last thousands of years.

===(25,000 years A.H)===
Earth enters a new [[Ice Age]], and [[glacier]]s expand south covering most of the Northern Hemisphere. The last traces of [[New York City]] are completely erased. Most species however adapt and thrive; sea lions, ducks, camels, fish, ostriches, lions, tigers, bison, baboons, deer, wolves, horses, cattle, and elephants all adapt alongside many other species. However, evidence left by [[Moon exploration]] missions and certain plastic items will survive intact for not only thousands, but millions of years after mankind has vanished. They will be the last legacy of the human race.

== Comparison to ''Life After People'' ==
As with ''[[Life After People]]'', the similar special feature on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]], ''Aftermath'' does not explain how humanity disappeared but rather what would happen to the Earth after we disappeared. It also shows that humans have disappeared instantly, not a few at a time. Both series depict the possible fates of famous pieces of infrastructure and buildings. It, too, uses [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] dramatizations to depict the possible fate of such icons as the [[Statue of Liberty]] and, in both programs, the [[Eiffel Tower]] and [[Hoover Dam]]. However, it does not emphasize this as much as ''Life After People'' does, following much more closely the effects on the natural world and its recovery after mankind departs the scene.

In addition, unlike ''Life After People'', ''Aftermath'' depicts what would happen if various modes of transportation, such as automobiles, planes, and trains, are abandoned in mid-motion when their passengers and operators instantly disappear, not unlike the [[Rapture]] in [[Christian eschatology]]. ''Life After People'', on the other hand, allows the possibility that instead of mysteriously vanishing the human race disappears with a mundane explanation, for example a pandemic or a global evacuation of Earth.

''Aftermath'' also shows what would happen if a [[nuclear power plant]]'s spent fuel rods are left without the cooling equipment governing its condition. ''Life After People'' suggest that nuclear power plants would safely shut down with no ill effects, with no mention of what would happen to spent fuel rods in storage. However, in an episode of ''Life After People: The Series'', "Toxic Revenge", spent fuel rods are shown heating up and exploding the reactors containing it within ten days of humanity's disappearance. ''Aftermath'' also shows that the nuclear power plants themselves would shut down without incident, but the spent fuel rod storage in separate buildings would eventually blow up and spread radiation into the air and the surrounding countryside after the backup safety devices fail. ''Life After People'' also does not mention the release of poisonous gas from chemical plants when their safety features fail, lacking the fuel to run them. ''Life After People'' does talk about the Hoover Dam still generating power after people, but neither show talks about the things powered by batteries and solar power. In the ''Life After People'' episode, "Crypt of Civilization", watches with batteries are shown to last at least a year after us. In another episode, "Waves of Devastation", one of the landmarks the episode centers around is the [[ferris wheel]] on the [[Santa Monica Pier]] that features LED lights that run automatically at night.  In another episode, "Sin City Meltdown", Springs Preserve's visitor center in Las Vegas is powered by the sun, and so the recorded voices of man still echo until ten years after people, when silt accumulated on the solar panels causes them to malfunction and shut off the voice of humans for good.

''Aftermath'' does not talk about the [[International Space Station]] while ''Life After People'' discusses the fate of the [[Immortality Drive]] aboard the ISS. Both documentaries make reference to objects on the Moon, although ''Life After People'' does this as part of the miniseries episode "Roads to Nowhere". Unlike ''Life After People'', ''Aftermath'' does not comment on the [[Voyager 2]] spacecraft. The ''Life After People'' episode "Sky's The Limit" mentions the [[Cassini–Huygens]] Space orbiter. However no other space probes were noted. It should however be noted that the original ''Life After People'' documentary made reference to humanity's radio communications in space.

'''Anne Perry''' (born '''Juliet Marion Hulme'''; 28 October 1938) is an English author of [[historical mystery|historical detective fiction]], best known for her [[Thomas Pitt (character)|Thomas Pitt]] and [[William Monk]] series.  In 1954, at the age of fifteen, she was convicted of participating in the [[Parker–Hulme murder case|murder of her friend's mother]]. She changed her name after serving her five-year sentence.

==Early life==
Born in [[Blackheath, London]], the daughter of [[physics|physicist]] [[Henry Rainsford Hulme|Dr. Henry Rainsford Hulme]], Perry was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] as a child and sent to the [[Caribbean]] and South Africa in hopes that a warmer climate would improve her health. A 1948 ''Auckland Star'' photograph of Juliet arriving in New Zealand was discovered by Auckland Libraries staff and written about in the Heritage et AL blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heritageetal.blogspot.co.nz/2012/06/juliet-hulme.html |title=Juliet Hulme |last1=Graves |first1=Joanne |date=29 June 2012 |website=heritageetal.blogspot.co.nz |publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] |access-date=23 August 2015 |quote=Whilst scrolling through microfilms on a job for a customer, I came across an interesting photo in a 1948 copy of the Auckland Star.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She rejoined her family when she was 13 after her father took a position as [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of [[Canterbury University College]] in New Zealand. She attended [[Christchurch Girls' High School]], located in what became the [[Cranmer Centre]].&lt;ref name="NZ History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pauline Parker|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/people/pauline-parker|publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]|accessdate=20 May 2011|date=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder and trial==
{{main|Parker–Hulme murder case}}
In June 1954, at the age of 15, Hulme and her best friend [[Pauline Parker]] murdered Parker's mother, Honorah Rieper.&lt;ref&gt;Honora used the surname Rieper although she was never legally married to Herbert Rieper.&lt;/ref&gt; Hulme's parents were in the process of separating and she was supposed to go to South Africa to stay with a relative. The two teenage friends, who had created a rich [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]] life together populated with famous actors such as [[James Mason]] and [[Orson Welles]], did not want to be separated.

On 22 June 1954, the girls and Honorah Rieper went for a walk in Victoria Park in their hometown of [[Christchurch]]. On an isolated path Hulme dropped an ornamental stone so that Rieper would lean over to retrieve it. Parker had planned to hit her mother with half a brick wrapped in a stocking. The girls presumed that one blow would kill her but it took more than 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|last=Gillies
 |first=Abby |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10765998 |title=The Parker-Hulme murder: Why it still matters to us |publisher=[[Nzherald.co.nz]] |date=14 November 2011 |accessdate=2013-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker and Hulme stood trial in Christchurch in 1954 and were found guilty on 29 August that year. As they were too young to be considered for the [[death penalty]] under New Zealand law at the time, they were convicted and sentenced to be "detained [[at Her Majesty's pleasure]]". In practice they were detained at the discretion of the Minister of Justice. They were released separately five years later.

Parker and Hulme are not believed to have had any contact since the trial.&lt;ref name="Herald interview"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;ObjectID=10371147|title=We were not lesbians, says former Juliet Hulme|date=5 March 2006|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| accessdate = 21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The events formed the basis for the 1994 film ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'', in which [[Melanie Lynskey]] portrayed a teenage Pauline Parker and [[Kate Winslet]] the teenaged Juliet Hulme.  At the time of the film's release, it was not generally known that  [[mystery author]] "Anne Perry" was Juliet Hulme, whose identity was made public some months after the film's release. Although some presumed Hulme and Parker's relationship to be sexual, Perry stated in 2006 that, while the relationship was obsessive, the two "were never lesbians".&lt;ref name="Herald interview" /&gt;

==Later life==
After being released from prison in November 1959, Hulme returned to England and became a [[flight attendant]]. For a period she lived in the United States, where she joined [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in 1968. She later settled in the Scottish village of [[Portmahomack]] where she lived with her mother. Her father had a distinguished scientific career, heading the British [[hydrogen bomb]] programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode = 1991QJRAS..32..313T | title=Henry Rainsford Hulme, 9 August 1908 – 8 January 1991. | journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume=32 | page=313 | year=1991 | authors=Tayler, R. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hulme took the name Anne Perry, using her stepfather's surname. Her first novel, ''[[The Cater Street Hangman]]'', was published under this name in 1979. Her works generally fall into one of several categories of [[genre fiction]], including historical murder mysteries and [[detective fiction]]. Many feature [[recurring character]]s, most importantly [[Thomas Pitt (fictional character)|Thomas Pitt]], who appeared in her first novel, and amnesiac private investigator [[William Monk]], who first appeared in her 1990 novel ''The Face of a Stranger''. By 2003 she had published 47 novels, and several collections of short stories.  Her story "Heroes", which first appeared in the 1999 anthology ''Murder and Obsession'', edited by [[Otto Penzler]], won the 2001 [[Edgar Award]] for Best Short Story.

In 2005, Perry appeared on the ''[[Trisha Goddard (TV Series)|Trisha]]'' show to discuss the crime on a special themed show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/817932 Film &amp; TV Database]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 documentary film, ''Anne Perry Interiors'', gave a snapshot of her life and the people close to her.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1403119/ IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bibliography==
Each series is listed in internal chronological order, according to the author's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anneperry.net/booklist/6 |title=Pitt |publisher=anneperry.net |accessdate=2013-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117180234/http://www.anneperry.net/booklist/6 |archivedate=2013-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two main series each feature a male and a female protagonist. Thomas Pitt is matched with Charlotte; her female society relatives help in the mysteries out of boredom. William Monk is matched with Hester Latterly, a Crimean War nurse. The Monk mysteries are set earlier in the Victorian era (1850s–1860s) than the Pitt books (1880s–1890s). Hester plays a very strong role in these stories; in some cases she is a better investigator than Monk. The Christmas stories involve minor characters such as sisters, bosses, or grandmothers in a personal crisis at a later Christmas time with a strongly enforced redemption message at the end.

'''Avalon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|v|ə|ˌ|l|ɒ|n}}; {{lang-la|Insula Avallonis}}, [[Old French]] ''Avalon'', {{lang-cy|Ynys Afallon, Ynys Afallach}}; literally meaning "the isle of fruit [or apple] trees") is a legendary island featured in the [[Arthurian legend]]. It first appears in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s 1136 pseudo-historical account ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' ("The History of the Kings of Britain") as the place where [[King Arthur]]'s sword [[Excalibur]] was forged and later where Arthur was taken to recover from his wounds after the [[Battle of Camlann]]. Avalon was associated from an early date with mystical practices and figures such as [[Morgan le Fay]]. It is traditionally identified as the former island of [[Glastonbury Tor]].

==Etymology==
[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] referred to it in [[Latin]] as ''Insula Avallonis'' in ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (c. 1136). In the later ''[[Vita Merlini]]'' (c. 1150) he called it ''Insula Pomorum'' the "isle of fruit trees" (from Latin ''pōmus'' "fruit tree"). The name is generally considered to be of [[Welsh language|Welsh]] origin (though an [[Cornish Language|Old Cornish]] or [[Breton language|Old Breton]] origin is also possible), derived from [[Old Welsh]], [[Old Cornish]], or [[Old Breton]] ''aball'' or ''avallen(n)'', "apple tree, fruit tree" (cf. ''afall'' in [[Modern Welsh]], derived from [[Common Celtic]] *''abalnā'', literally "fruit-bearing (thing)").&lt;ref&gt;Matasović, Ranko, Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic, Brill, 2008, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koch, John 2006, p. 146"&gt;Koch, John. Celtic Culture:a historical encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO 2006, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Savage, John J. H. "Insula Avallonia", Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association, Vol. 73, (1942), pp. 405–415.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nitze, William Albert, Jenkins, Thomas Atkinson. Le Haut Livre du Graal, Phaeton Press, 1972, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer, Heinrich. Bretonische Elemente in der Artursage des Gottfried von Monmouth, Zeitschrift für französische Sprache und Literatur, Volume 12, 1890, pp. 246–248.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that the tradition of an "apple" island among the British was related to [[Irish legends]] concerning the [[Celtic Otherworld|otherworld]] island home of [[Manannán mac Lir]] and [[Lugh]], [[Emain Ablach]] (also the [[Old Irish]] poetic name for the [[Isle of Man]]),&lt;ref name="Koch, John 2006, p. 146"/&gt; where ''Ablach'' means "Having Apple Trees"&lt;ref&gt;Marstrander, Carl Johan Sverdrup (ed.), Dictionary of the Irish Language, Royal Irish Academy, 1976, letter A, column 11, line 026.&lt;/ref&gt; – derived from Old Irish ''aball'' ("apple")—and is similar to the Middle Welsh name ''Afallach'', which was used to replace the name Avalon in medieval Welsh translations of French and Latin Arthurian tales. All are etymologically related to the Gaulish root *''aballo'' "fruit tree" - (as found in the place name [[Avallon|Aballo/Aballone]]) and are derived from a Common Celtic *''abal''- "apple", which is related at the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] level to English ''apple'', Russian ''яблоко'' (''jabloko''), Latvian ''ābols'', et al.&lt;ref&gt;Hamp, Eric P. The north European word for ‘apple’, Zeitschrift für Celtische Philologie, 37, 1979, pp. 158–166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Douglas Q. The Indo-European Word for 'apple' Again. Indogermanische Forschungen, 90, 1985, pp. 79–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geoffrey of Monmouth==
According to Geoffrey in ''Historia'', and much subsequent literature which he inspired, Avalon is the place where [[King Arthur]] is taken after fighting [[Mordred]] at the [[Battle of Camlann]] to recover from his wounds. [[Wales|Welsh]], [[Cornwall|Cornish]] and [[Breton people|Breton]] tradition claimed that Arthur had never really died, but [[King Arthur's messianic return|would return to lead his people against their enemies]]. ''Historia'' also states that Avalon is where his sword [[Excalibur]] was forged.

Geoffrey dealt with Avalon in more detail in ''Vita Merlini'', in which he describes for the first time in Arthurian legend the enchantress [[Morgan le Fay|Morgan]] (''Morgen'') as the chief of [[Nine sorceresses|nine sisters]] (Moronoe, Mazoe, Gliten, Glitonea, Gliton, Tyronoe, Thiten and Thiton)&lt;ref&gt;Berthelot, Anne, “Apprivoiser la merveille”, in: Mélanges en l’honneur de Francis Dubost, Paris: Champion, 2005, pp. 49–66.&lt;/ref&gt; who rule Avalon. Geoffrey's description of the island indicates a sea voyage was needed to get there. His description of Avalon here, which is heavily indebted to the early medieval Spanish scholar [[Isidore of Seville]] (being mostly derived from the section on famous islands in Isidore's famous work ''[[Etymologiae]]'', XIV.6.8 "''[[Fortunate Isles|Fortunatae Insulae]]''"),&lt;ref&gt;Walter, Philippe; Berthet, Jean-Charles; Stalmans, Nathalie; Le devin maudit: Merlin, Lailoken, Suibhne : textes et étude, ELLUG, 1999, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lot, Ferdinand, Nouvelles études sur le cycle arthurien", in: Romania, vol. 177, 1918, pp. 1-22 (p. 14).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faral, Edmond, La Légende arthurienne, études et documents, Premiere partie: Les plus anciens textes, vol. II, H. Champion, 1993 (reprint), pp. 382-383&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cons, Louis, "Avallo", in: Modern Philology, Vol. 28, No. 4 (May, 1931), pp. 385-394.&lt;/ref&gt; shows the magical nature of the island:

:"The island of apples which men call the Fortunate Isle (''Insula Pomorum quae Fortunata uocatur'') gets its name from the fact that it produces all things of itself; the fields there have no need of the ploughs of the farmers and all cultivation is lacking except what nature provides. Of its own accord it produces grain and grapes, and apple trees grow in its woods from the close-clipped grass. The ground of its own accord produces everything instead of merely grass, and people live there a hundred years or more. There nine sisters rule by a pleasing set of laws those who come to them from our country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/vm/index.htm|title=Vita Merlini Index|work=sacred-texts.com|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|By comparison, Isidore's description of the [[Fortunate Isles]] reads: "The Fortunate Isles ''(Fortunatarum insulae)'' signify by their name that they produce all kinds of good things, as if they were happy and blessed with an abundance of fruit. Indeed, well-suited by their nature, they produce fruit from very precious trees [''Sua enim aptae natura pretiosarum poma silvarum parturiunt'']; the ridges of their hills are spontaneously covered with grapevines; instead of weeds, harvest crops and garden herbs are common there. Hence the mistake of pagans and the poems by worldly poets, who believed that these isles were Paradise because of the fertility of their soil. They are situated in the Ocean, against the left side of [[Mauretania]], closest to where the sun sets, and they are separated from each other by the intervening sea."&lt;ref&gt;Barney, S., Lewis, W.J., Beach, J.A., Berghof, O (eds.), The Etymologies of Isidore of Seville, Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient and medieval geographies and maps, the Fortunate Isles were typically identified with the [[Canary Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;Tilley, Arthur Augustus, Medieval France: A Companion to French Studies, Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sobecki, Sebastian I., The Sea and Medieval English Literature, DS Brewer, 2008, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Callaghan, J., Kagay, D., Vann, T.

==Later medieval literature==
[[File:The Death of King Arthur by James Archer (1860).jpg|thumb|300px|''Le Morte d'Arthur'' by [[James Archer (artist)|James Archer]] (1860)]]

In ''[[Erec and Enide]]'' by [[Chrétien de Troyes]], the consort of Morgan is the Lord of the Isle of Avalon, Arthur's nephew named Guinguemar (a derivative of the legendary Breton hero [[Guingamor]]&lt;ref&gt;Pérez, Kristina ''The Myth of Morgan la Fey''. Palgrave Macmillan (2014), p 91.&lt;/ref&gt;). In [[Layamon]]'s [[Layamon's Brut|''Brut'']], Arthur is taken to Avalon to be healed there (by means of magic water) by a more supernatural and distinctively [[Anglo-Saxon]] redefinition of Geoffrey's Morgen: an [[elf]] queen of Avalon named Argante.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://etd.ohiolink.edu/rws_etd/document/get/ohiou1307121254/inline|title=Argante of Areley Kings: Regional Definitions of National Identity in Layamon's Brut|publisher=Ohio State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some later versions of the Arthurian legend (including the best-known, ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' by [[Thomas Malory]]) have Morgan (by this time Arthur's sister in the narrative) and some other ladies (magical queens or enchantresses, sometimes with the [[Lady of the Lake]] among them; other may include the Queens of Eastland, the Northgales, the Outer Isles, and the [[Wasteland (mythology)|Wasteland]]) arrive after the battle to take the mortally wounded Arthur from Camlann to Avalon on a black boat. In the Spanish summary of the [[Post-Vulgate]] ''Roman du Graal'' by Lope Garcia de Salazar, Morgan then uses her magic to hide Avalon in mist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crossingtheoceansea.com/OceanSeaPages/OS-23-MythicalAtlanticIslands.html|title=Crossing the Ocean Sea - The Mythical Atlantic Islands|website=www.crossingtheoceansea.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur's fate is usually left untold; in the [[Stanzaic Morte Arthur|Stanzaic ''Morte Arthur'']], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] later receives Arthur's dead body and buries it at [[Glastonbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/benson-and-foster-king-arthurs-death-stanzaic-morte-arthur-part-iii|title=Stanzaic Morte Arthur, Part 3|publisher=Robbins Library Digital Projects}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, [[Stephen of Rouen]]'s chronicle ''[[Draco Normannicus]]'' contains a fictional letter from King Arthur to [[Henry II of England]], in which Arthur claims that he has been healed of his wounds and made immortal by his "deathless/eternal [[nymph]]" sister Morgan on Avalon, using the island's restorative herbs.&lt;ref name=blr&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Twomey |url=https://www.academia.edu/11688947/Morgan_le_Fay_Empress_of_the_Wilderness_A_Newly_Recovered_Arthurian_Text_in_London_BL_Royal_12.C.ix |title='Morgan le Fay, Empress of the Wilderness': A Newly Recovered Arthurian Text in London, BL Royal 12.C.ix &amp;#124; Michael Twomey |publisher=Academia.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-IY-zIn5VHUC&amp;pg=PT40&amp;lpg=PT40|title=Morgan le Fay, Shapeshifter|first=Jill M.|last=Hebert|date=12 March 2013|publisher=Springer|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan also features as an immortal ruler of a fantastic Avalon, sometimes alongside the still alive Arthur, in some subsequent and otherwise non-Arthurian [[chivalric romance]]s such as ''[[Tirant lo Blanch]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://repositori.udl.cat/handle/10459.1/59590|title=La desaparición de Morgana: de Tirant lo Blanch (1490) y Amadís de Gaula (1508) a Tyrant le Blanch (1737)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the tales of [[Huon of Bordeaux]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8T0hy0wg0KEC&amp;pg=PT836|title=The Spenser Encyclopedia|first=A.

==Connection to Glastonbury==
Around 1190, Avalon became associated with Glastonbury, when monks at [[Glastonbury Abbey]] claimed to have discovered the bones of Arthur and Guinevere. The works of [[Gerald of Wales]] make the first known connection:

:"What is now known as Glastonbury was, in ancient times, called the Isle of Avalon. It is virtually an island, for it is completely surrounded by marshlands. In Welsh it is called ''Ynys Afallach'', which means the Island of Apples and this fruit once grew in great abundance. After the Battle of Camlann, a noblewoman called Morgan, later the ruler and patroness of these parts as well as being a close blood-relation of King Arthur, carried him off to the island, now known as Glastonbury, so that his wounds could be cared for. Years ago the district had also been called ''Ynys Gutrin'' in Welsh, that is the Island of Glass, and from these words the invading Saxons later coined the place-name 'Glastingebury'."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannia.com/history/docs/debarri.html|title=Two Accounts of the Exhumation of Arthur's Body: Gerald of Wales|work=britannia.com|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though no longer an island in the 12th century, the high conical bulk of [[Glastonbury Tor]] had been surrounded by marsh before the surrounding [[fen]]land in the [[Somerset Levels]] was drained. In ancient times, [[Ponter's Ball Dyke]] would have guarded the only entrance to the island. The [[Roman Britain|Romans]] eventually built another [[Roman roads|road]] to the island.&lt;ref name="eoe-69"&gt;{{Citation|title=Earthwork of England: Prehistoric, Roman, Saxon, Danish, Norman and Mediæval|publisher=Nabu Press|pages=69&amp;ndash;70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X14TAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA496&amp;dq=Ponter's%20Ball%20Dyke&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q=Ponter's%20Ball%20Dyke&amp;f=false|last=Allcroft|first=Arthur Hadrian|year=1908|isbn=978-1-178-13643-2|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald wrote that Glastonbury's earliest name in Welsh was ''Ineswitrin'' (or ''Ynys Witrin''), the Isle of Glass, a name noted by earlier historians which suggests that the location was at one point seen as an island.

The discovery of the burial is described by chroniclers, notably Gerald, as being just after King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]'s reign when the new abbot of Glastonbury, [[Henry de Sully (died 1195)|Henry de Sully]], commissioned a search of the abbey grounds. At a depth of 5&amp;nbsp;m (16&amp;nbsp;feet) the monks were said to have discovered a massive [[treetrunk coffin]] and a lead cross bearing the inscription:

[[File:Glastonbury cross-camden-1607edition-p166.jpg|thumb|upright|Lead cross inscribed with Arthur's epitaph, published in [[William Camden]]'s ''Britannia'' (1607)]]

{{quote|''Hic jacet sepultus inclitus rex Arturius in insula Avalonia.'' &lt;br /&gt;("Here lies entombed the renowned king Arthur in the island of Avalon.")}}

Accounts of the exact inscription vary, with five different versions existing. The earliest is by Gerald in ''Liber de Principis instructione'' c.&amp;nbsp;1193, who wrote that he viewed the cross in person and traced the lettering. His transcript reads: "Here lies buried the famous ''Arthurus'' with ''Wenneveria'' his second wife in the isle of Avalon." Inside the coffin were two bodies, whom Giraldus refers to as Arthur and "his queen"; the bones of the male body were described as being gigantic. The account of the burial by the chronicle of [[Margam Abbey]] says three bodies were found, the other being that of [[Mordred]]: [[Richard Barber]] argues that his name was airbrushed out of the story once his reputation as a traitor was appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Barber]], "Was Mordred buried at Glastonbury?: Arthurian tradition at Glastonbury in the middle ages", in {{Harvnb|Carley|2001|pp=145–59, 316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1278, the remains were reburied with great ceremony, attended by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] and his queen, before the High Altar at Glastonbury Abbey.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Parsons, "The second exhumation of King Arthur's remains at Glastonbury, 19 April 1278", in {{Harvnb|Carley|2001|pp=179–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were moved again in 1368 when the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] was extended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Julian |last=Luxford |title=King Arthur's tomb at Glastonbury: the relocation of 1368 in context |journal=Arthurian Literature |volume=29 |year=2012 |pages=41–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site became the focus of pilgrimages until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution]] of the abbey in 1539.

The story is today seen as an example of [[pseudoarchaeology]]. Historians generally dismiss the authenticity of the find, attributing it to a publicity stunt performed to raise funds to repair the Abbey, which was mostly burned in 1184.&lt;ref&gt;Modern scholarship views the Glastonbury cross as the result of a late 12th-century fraud. See {{Harvnb|Rahtz|1993}}; {{Harvnb|Carey|1999}}; {{Harvnb|Harris|2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Long before this [[William of Malmesbury]], a 12th-century historian interested in Arthur, wrote in his history of England: "But Arthur's grave is nowhere seen, whence antiquity of fables still claims that he will return."&lt;ref&gt;[[O. J. Padel]].  (1994). "The Nature of Arthur" in ''Cambrian Medieval Celtic Studies'', ''27'', pp.&amp;nbsp;1–31, at p.&amp;nbsp;10&lt;/ref&gt; It is known for certain the monks later added forged passages discussing Arthurian connections to William's comprehensive history of Glastonbury ''De antiquitae Glatoniensis ecclesie'' (''On Antiquity of Glastonbury Church''), written around 1130.&lt;ref&gt;"Glastonbury", in Norris J. Lacy (ed.) (1986). ''The Arthurian Encyclopedia''. New York: Peter Bedrick Books.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}

The fact that the search for the body is connected to Henry&amp;nbsp;II and Edward&amp;nbsp;I, both kings who fought major [[List of Anglo-Welsh wars|Anglo-Welsh wars]], has had scholars suggest that propaganda may have played a part as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rahtz|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald was a constant supporter of royal authority; in his account of the discovery clearly aims to destroy the idea of the possibility of [[King Arthur's messianic return]]:

:"Many tales are told and many legends have been invented about King Arthur and his mysterious ending. In their stupidity the British [i.e. Welsh, Cornish and Bretons] people maintain that he is still alive. Now that the truth is known, I have taken the trouble to add a few more details in this present chapter. The fairy-tales have been snuffed out, and the true and indubitable facts are made known, so that what really happened must be made crystal clear to all and separated from the myths which have accumulated on the subject."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[File:Gloomy Glastonbury Tor.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A view from [[Glastonbury Tor]] in 2014]]

The burial discovery ensured that in later romances, histories based on them and in the popular imagination Glastonbury became increasingly identified with Avalon, an identification that continues strongly today. The later development of the legends of the [[Holy Grail]] and [[Joseph of Arimathea]] by [[Robert de Boron]] interconnected these legends with Glastonbury and with Avalon, an identification which also seems to be made in ''[[Perlesvaus]]''. The popularity of Arthurian romances has meant this area of the Somerset Levels has today become popularly described as the Vale of Avalon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/1990/jun/25/glastonbury2003.glastonbury |title=Treadmill in the Vale of Avalon |author=John Ezard |work=the Guardian|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent times, writers such as [[Dion Fortune]], [[John Michell (writer)|John Michell]], [[Nicholas Mann (occult writer)|Nicholas Mann]] and [[Geoffrey Ashe]] have formed theories based on perceived connections between Glastonbury and Celtic legends of the [[Celtic Otherworld|Otherworld]] in attempts to link the location firmly with Avalon, drawing on the various legends based on Glastonbury Tor as well as drawing on ideas like [[Earth mysteries]], [[Ley lines]] and even the myth of [[Atlantis]]. Arthurian literature also continues to use Glastonbury as an important location as in ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'', ''[[A Glastonbury Romance]]'', and ''[[The Bones of Avalon]]''. Even the fact that [[Somerset]] has many apple orchards has been drawn in to support the connection.

Glastonbury's connection to Avalon continues to make it a site of tourism and the area has great religious significance for [[Modern Paganism|Neo-Pagans]], [[Neo-Druidism|Neo-Druids]] and as a [[New Age communities|New Age community]], as well as Christians. [[Hippy]] identification of Glastonbury with Avalon seen in the work of Michell and in [[Gandalf's Garden]] also helped inspire the [[Glastonbury Festival]].&lt;ref name="Hutton"&gt;"Glastonbury: Alternative Histories", in Ronald Hutton, ''Witches, Druids and King Arthur''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{-}}

==Other locations for Avalon==
{{see also|Locations associated with Arthurian legend}}

In medieval times suggestions for the location of Avalon ranged far beyond Glastonbury. They included [[Paradise|paradisal]] [[underworld]] realms equated with the other side of the Earth at the [[antipodes]], [[Mount Etna|Mongibel]] in  [[Sicily]],&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, Roger Sherman ''Wales and the Arthurian Legend'', pub. University of Wales Press, Cardiff 1956 and reprinted by Folcroft Press 1973, Chapter 5 ''King Arthur and the Antipodes'', pps. 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt; and other unnamed locations in the [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref name="Lacy"&gt;Avalon in Norris J. Lacy, Editor, The Arthurian Encyclopedia (1986 Peter Bedrick Books, New York).&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent times, just like in the quest for Arthur's mythical capital [[Camelot]], a large number of locations have been put forward as being the real "Avalon". Ashe suggests an association of Avalon with the town of [[Avallon]] in [[Burgundy (French region)|Burgundy]], as part of a theory connecting King Arthur to the [[Romano-British]] leader [[Riothamus]] who campaigned in that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Discovery of King Arthur|author=Geoffrey Ashe|pages=95–96|publisher=Guild Publishing|location=London|year=1985|quote=(p. 95) In Welsh it is ''Ynys Avallach''. Geoffrey's Latin equivalent is ''Insula Avallonis''. It has been influenced by the spelling of a real place called Avallon. Avallon is a Gaulish name with the same meaning, and the real Avalon is in Burgundy&amp;mdash;where Arthur's Gallic career ends. Again, we glimpse an earlier and different passing of Arthur, on the Continent and not in Britain. (p. 96) Riothamus too led an army of Britons into Gaul, and was the only British King who did. He too advanced to the neighbourhood of Burgundy. He too was betrayed by a deputy ruler who treated with barbarian enemies. He, too, is last located in Gaul among the pro-Roman Burgundians. He, too, disappears after a fatal battle, without any recorded death. The line of his retreat, prolonged on a map, shows that he was going in the direction of the real Avalon.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Barkworth''''' was launched in 1811 and began her career as a [[West Indiaman]]. She then made one voyage for the British [[East India Company]] (EIC). Thereafter she traded with India. She disappeared without a trace in 1824 on her way to [[Mumbai|Bombay]].

==Career==
''Barkworth'' appears in ''[[Lloyd's Register]]'' for 1812 with T. Forest, master, and trade Hull—London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044105233563?urlappend=%3Bseq=611 ''Lloyd's Register'' (1812), Supple. Seq.№6.]&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Register of Shipping'' has her sailing to the West Indies.

'''EIC voyage (1816–1817):''' Captain Thomas Lynn sailed from [[The Downs (ship anchorage)|the Downs]] on 24 March 1816, bound for [[Saint Helena|St Helena]] and China. ''Barkworth'' was at St Helena on 10 June, reached [[Batavia (Dutch East Indies)|Batavia]] on 30 September, and arrived at [[Whampoa Anchorage]] on 7 January 1817. Homeward bound, she was off North Island (the northernmost of three islands in the bay that formed the principle anchorage of [[Enggano Island]]), on 23 March and reached St Helena on 7 June. ''Barkworth'' arrived at Northfleet on 11 August.

On 28 October 1818 ''Barkworth'' was in [[Chennai|Madras]] [[Roadstead|Roads]] when a gale drove her and a number of other vessels out.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015005778181?urlappend=%3Bseq=106 ''[[Lloyd's List]]'' №5372.]&lt;/ref&gt; She then stopped at [[Trincomalee]] to refit and was expected to sail to [[Mumbai|Bombay]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015005778181?urlappend=%3Bseq=149 ''Lloyd's List'' №5383.]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lloyd's Register'' carries ''Barkworth'' as continuing to trade with India. ''Lloyd's Register'' for 1823 has Pedler as master and owner, and her trade as London—Bombay.&lt;ref name=LR1823&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044105233639?urlappend=%3Bseq=70 ''Lloyd's Register'' (1823), Seq.№B50.]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lloyd's Register'' for 1824 has ''Barkworth''{{'}}s master as Green, her owner as Taylor and Co., and her trade as London-Bombay.&lt;ref name=LR1824&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044105233647?urlappend=%3Bseq=70 ''Lloyd's Register'' (1824), Seq.№B53.]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Register of Shipping'' still has Pedler as master and owner, but agrees with the trade London—Bombay. It also notes that ''Barkworth'' underwent a thorough repair in 1823.&lt;ref name=RS1824&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015006563160?urlappend=%3Bseq=78 ''Register of Shipping'' (1824), Seq.№51.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fate==
On 29 September 1824, off the Cape Verde Islands, {{ship||Cumberland|1800 ship|2}} spoke with ''Barkworth'', which was bound for Bombay. ''Cumberland'' arrived at Rio de Janeiro 20 October, but ''Barkworth'' was never heard from again.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015006563186?urlappend=%3Bseq=382 ''Lloyd's List'' №5973.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Hackman quotes a clearly incorrect report that has ''Barkworth'' spoken to "while outward bound from London to the West Indies by the Cumberland West Indiaman, Captain Cairns, then bound for Botany Bay with convicts."&lt;ref name=Hackman/&gt; Bateson (1959), the definitive work on convict ships to Australia, has no record of any vessel named ''Cumberland'' delivering convicts to either New South Wales or Van Dieman's Land. Also, ''Lloyd's List'' for 1824 has no vessel named ''Cumberland'' sailing on a route that would take them to Rio or via Rio, nor are the two vessels with Cairns as master on such a route. However, the ''Register of Shipping'' has a ''Cumberland'', that had been a [[whaler]] for [[Samuel Enderby &amp; Sons]], but that now had a new master, Cairnes, and a new trade, London—New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015006563160?urlappend=%3Bseq=142 ''Register of Shipping'' (1824), Seq.№C942.]&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11259">In [[Christian theology]], the '''beatific vision''' ({{lang-la|visio beatifica}}) is the ultimate direct self-communication of [[God]] to the individual [[person]]. A person possessing the beatific vision reaches, as a member of redeemed humanity in the [[Communion of Saints|communion of saints]], perfect [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] in its entirety, i.e. [[heaven]]. The notion of vision stresses the intellectual component of salvation, though it encompasses the whole of human experience of joy, happiness coming from seeing God finally face to face and not imperfectly through [[Faith in Christianity|faith.]] ([[1 Corinthians 13|1 Cor 13]]:11–12).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = K.

In [[Christianity]], the [[Bible]] teaches that God "dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has even seen or can see"  ([[First Epistle to Timothy|1 Timothy]] 6:16), but when God reveals Himself to us in heaven we will then see Him ''face to face'' ([[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] 13:12).&lt;ref name="LCMS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=6948 |title=God in Heaven |publisher=Lutheran Church Missouri Synod |accessdate=2007-10-31 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511173949/http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=6948 |archive-date=11 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been termed "the beatific vision of God" by theologians of the [[Catholic Church]] as well as various [[Christian denominations|Protestant denominations]], including the [[Lutheran Church]] and the [[Methodist Church]].&lt;ref name="LCMS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SLUMC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.springlakeumc.org/beliefs/index.html |title=What United Methodists Believe |publisher=Spring Lake United Methodist Church |accessdate=2007-10-31 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927112100/http://www.springlakeumc.org/beliefs/index.html |archive-date=27 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wesley, Charles.

[[Cyprian|Saint Cyprian]] wrote of the saved's seeing God in the Kingdom of Heaven.
&lt;blockquote&gt;How great will your glory and happiness be, to be allowed to see God, to be honored with sharing the joy of salvation and eternal light with Christ your Lord and God... to delight in the joy of immortality in the Kingdom of Heaven with the righteous and God's friends!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Monsignor [[Edward A. Pace]] in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (1907) defined the Beatific Vision:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The immediate knowledge of God which the angelic spirits and the souls of the just enjoy in Heaven. It is called "vision" to distinguish it from the mediate knowledge of God which the human mind may attain in the present life. And since in beholding God face to face the created intelligence finds perfect happiness, the vision is termed "beatific."&lt;ref&gt;Pace, Edward. "Beatific Vision." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 5 Jan. 2011 &lt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02364a.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Methodist]] co-founder [[Charles Wesley]], in his 1747 hymn "Maker, in Whom We Live," described union with God through the Holy Spirit as "beatific sight":
&lt;blockquote&gt;Spirit of Holiness, let all thy saints adore / thy sacred energy, and bless thine heart-renewing power. / No angel tongues can tell thy love's ecstatic height, / the glorious joy unspeakable, the beatific sight.&lt;ref&gt;Wesley, Charles. "Maker, in Whom We Live." The United Methodist Hymnal. Nashville: The United Methodist Publishing House, 1989. 28 May 2018. &lt;https://hymnary.org/hymn/UMH/88&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In the Catholic church==

In Catholic theology, the [[intercession of saints]] is valid because those who have died in the Faith are with God in Heaven and enjoy the Beatific Vision, i.e., unmediated access to God's Presence, actually in Paradise itself, seeing God.

===Thomas Aquinas===

[[Thomas Aquinas]] defined the beatific vision as the human being's "final end" in which one attains to a perfect happiness.  Thomas reasons that one is perfectly happy only when all one's desires are perfectly satisfied, to the degree that happiness could not increase and could not be lost. "Man is not perfectly happy, so long as something remains for him to desire and seek."[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2003.htm#article8 STh I–II, q., 3, a. 8.] But this kind of perfect happiness cannot be found in any physical pleasure, any amount of worldly power, any degree of temporal fame or honor, or indeed in any finite reality. It can only be found in something that is infinite and perfect&amp;nbsp;– and this is God. [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2002.htm#article8 STh I–II, q. 2, a. 8.] And since God is not a material thing but is pure spirit, we are united to God by knowing and loving him. Consequently, the most perfect union with God is the most perfect human happiness and the goal of the whole of the human life. But we cannot attain to this happiness by our own natural powers; it is a gift that must be given us by God, who strengthens us by the "light of glory" so that we can see him as he is, without any intermediary. (Thomas quotes [[Psalm 36]]:9 on this point: "In your light we shall see light.")[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1012.htm#article4 STh I, q. 12, a. 4.] Further, since every created image or likeness of God (including even the most perfect "ideas" or "images" of God we might generate in our minds) is necessarily finite, it would thus be infinitely less than God himself.[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1012.htm#article2 STh I, q. 12, a. 2.] The only perfect and infinite good, therefore, is God himself, which is why Aquinas argues that our perfect happiness and final end can only be the direct union with God himself and not with any created image of him. This union comes about by a kind of "seeing" perfectly the divine essence itself, a gift given to our intellects when God joins them directly to himself without any intermediary. And since in seeing this perfect vision of what (and who) God is, we grasp also his perfect goodness, this act of "seeing" is at the same time a perfect act of loving God as the highest and infinite goodness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]], I–II, qq. 2–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aquinas, the Beatific Vision surpasses both [[faith]] and [[reason]]. Rational knowledge does not fully satisfy humankind's innate desire to know God, since reason is primarily concerned with sensible objects and thus can only infer its conclusions about God indirectly. [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/101212.htm ''Summa Theologiae'']

The Theological virtue of faith, too, is incomplete, since Aquinas thinks that it always implies some imperfection in the understanding. The believer does not wish to remain merely on the level of faith but to grasp directly the object of faith, who is God himself. [http://www2.nd.edu/Departments//Maritain/etext/gc3_40.htm ''Summa Contra Gentiles'']

Thus only the fullness of the Beatific Vision satisfies this fundamental desire of the human soul to know God. Quoting [[Paul the Apostle|St Paul]], Aquinas notes "We see now in a glass darkly, but then face to face" (i Cor. 13:12). The Beatific Vision is the final reward for those saints elect by God to partake in and "enjoy the same happiness wherewith God is happy, seeing Him in the way which He sees Himself" in the next life. [http://www2.nd.edu/Departments//Maritain/etext/gc3_51.htm ''Summa Contra Gentiles'']

===Pope John XXII and the Beatific Vision controversy===

[[Pope John XXII]] (1316–1334) caused a controversy involving the Beatific Vision.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Dykmans, Les sermons de Jean XXII sur la vision béatifique, Rome, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; He said not as Pope but as a private theologian that the saved do not attain the [[Beatific Vision]] until [[Judgment Day]], a view more consistent with [[Christian mortalism|soul sleep]].&lt;ref&gt;Louise Bourdua, Anne Dunlop ''Art and the Augustinian order in early Renaissance Italy''&lt;/ref&gt; The general understanding at the time was that the saved attained Heaven after being purified and before Judgment Day. He never proclaimed his belief as doctrine but rather as an opinion (see [[First Vatican Council|''ex cathedra'']], as defined at the First Vatican Council in 1870).

The Sacred College of Cardinals held a [[papal consistory|consistory]] on the problem in January 1334, and Pope John backed away from his novel views to the more standard understanding.

His successor, [[Pope Benedict XII]], [[Benedictus Deus (Benedict XII)|declared]] it doctrine that the saved see Heaven (and thus, God) before Judgment Day.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bronze statue of Blackie the Horse.jpg|thumb|250px|Statue of Blackie erected in his long-time pasture, located in [[Tiburon, California]]]] --&gt;
'''Blackie''' was a swaybacked horse who, for twenty-eight years, was a well-known fixture in [[Tiburon, California]].  He not only stood in the same spot in a pasture at the corner of Tiburon Boulevard and Trestle Glen Road, rarely moving, day after day, but he faced in the same direction, becoming the local mascot of several generations. Born in [[Kansas]], Blackie was brought to California to become a [[cutting horse]] at rodeos. After his rodeo career, he was sold to the Army and became a [[cavalry]] horse. He was retired when he was 12 years old.

A short time later, Anthony Connell, his new owner, put him in the Tiburon pasture where he found his spot and stood, day after day in the same place, for 28 years. When Blackie collapsed and died while standing in “his” spot on February 27, 1966, the [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] Health Department approved his burial in the pasture. His grave was marked by a simple cross and a memorial plaque made possible by contributions from citizens of the peninsula. In June 1995, the [[Tiburon Peninsula Foundation]] erected a life-sized sculpture of Blackie in what is now known as Blackie’s Pasture.

Tiburon Blackie was not the horse who made history swimming San Francisco Bay. Tiburon Blackie had three white socks not found on the film of the bay swimmer. Tiburon Blackie was a cavalry horse at the Presidio of San Francisco and was later owned by local retired military man.

Contrary to some reports, neither did Blackie accompany the Army horses stabled at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]] which the "Buffalo Soldiers," the famous African-American cavalry and infantry troops, rode to the Sierra Nevada Mountains each spring to patrol the National Parks there. Blackie died at age forty in 1966. Although the U.S. Army stationed cavalry units at the Presidio of San Francisco through the end of World War II, it ceased patrolling the National Parks in 1913, long before Blackie was born.

The '''''Caleuche''''' is a [[Mythology|mythical]]  [[List of ghost ships|ghost ship]] of the north [[Chilote mythology]] and local [[folklore]] of the [[Chiloé Island]], in [[Chile]]. It is one of the most important [[myth]]s of the [[culture of Chile]].

==Legend==
According to Chilean [[legend]], the ''Caleuche'' is a large [[ghost ship]] sailing the seas around Chiloé (a small island off the coast of Chile) at night. The ''Caleuche'' is said to be a being who is conscious and sentient. The ship appears as a beautiful and bright white sailing ship, with 3 masts of 5 sails each, always full of lights and with the sounds of a party on board, but quickly disappears again, leaving no evidence of its presence. The ghost ship is also known to be able to navigate under water, just like another well known ghost ship, the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]''.

===Versions===
There are various versions of the legend of the ''Caleuche''.

One version claims that it is crewed by the drowned, who are brought to the ship by three Chilote mythological figures, two sisters: the ''[[sirena chilota]]'' (a type of [[mermaid]]) and the [[Pincoya]] and their brother, the [[Pincoy]]. Once aboard, the dead can resume an existence as if they were alive again.

A similar version of the legend is that the mythical ship appears in the sea of the [[Chiloé Archipelago]] where it captivates fishermen and sailors with its enchanting music to enslave them as part of their crew for eternity. These slaves are defined as eternally having a leg folded over their back, similar to the [[Imbunche]] of Chilote mythology.

Another common version is that it is the magic ship that the [[Warlock of Chiloé|Warlocks of Chiloé]] use to have parties and transport their goods. It is also used by the warlocks every three months when they go on a journey to improve their magical abilities. The warlocks are only able to reach the ship by summoning ''[[caballo marino chilote]]''. This is because [[Millalobo]] (the king of the seas) has prohibited any other people from boarding the ship or getting to it by any other means.

Another version is that the crew of the ''Caleuche'' makes magical pacts with certain traders ensuring them prosperity in exchange for favors such as using their houses for parties or other illegal or dark purposes. Because of this version of the legend when a person in Chiloé gets rich quickly, it is often attributed to his having made a pact with the crew of the ''Caleuche''. Rumors like these were rampant following the [[1960 Valdivia earthquake]] because some houses were untouched by the fires that swept through Chiloé afterwards. In that same decade there were stories that the sounds of a ship dropping anchor could be heard around the houses of many prosperous merchants in the Chiloé archipelago. These were supposedly the sounds of the ''Caleuche'' stealthily delivering goods and treasures to those with whom it had a pact. However, most people rejected this supernatural explanation and instead blamed the merchant's prosperity on mortal, rather than supernatural, smugglers.

==In media==
The legend of the ''Caleuche'' is referred to in [[Alastair Reynolds]]' 2001 novel [[Chasm City]], when the Chilean crewmembers of a [[generation ship]] discover a "ghost ship" trailing the flotilla of colony vessels and dub the ship ''Caleuche''.

The ''Caleuche'' is a living vessel which travels the world, carrying a crew of monster hunters in [[The Luke Coles Book Series]] by [[Josh Walker (author)|Josh Walker]].

In film and television, [[Raúl Ruiz (director)|Raúl Ruiz]]'s ''[[Three Crowns of the Sailor]]'' (1983) and ''[[Litoral (film)|Litoral]]'' (2008) and [[Jorge Olguín (director)|Jorge Olguín]]'s ''Caleuche: The Call of the Sea'' (2012) are all loosely inspired by the legend.

'''Carlo Biffi''' (1605–1675) was an [[Italy|Italian]] painter of the [[Baroque]] period. He was born in [[Milan]], where he trained with [[Camillo Procaccini]].
==Life and Work==
He was born in [[Milan]] in 1605 probably in the parish of St. Giovanni in Laterano. He was a son and pupil of Gianandrea the Elder.  In 1621 he was admitted to the [[Ambrosian Academy]]. His activity in the cathedral of Milan - the only one certified so far - was remembered in the ''Annals'' only starting from 1631, just after the death of Gianandrea. The execution of an ''Angel'' started by his father was entrusted to Biffi, for which he still received payments in 1638, but which would then be finished by [[Vismara]]. In 1632 he obtained the money for the effigy of the ''Eternal'' started by Gianandrea for the chapel of the Madonna of the Tree and sent by him. From that year until 1635 he worked around the relief of Ester and Assuero for a lunette of the facade, already designed and started by the father according to the design of [[Giovanni Battista Crespi|Cerano]]. The angels are also recognized in the cathedral in the niches of the internal piers on the sides of the Main Cross.

More interesting must have been the activity of Biffi as an engraver: the ''portrait of [[Francesco Gabrielli]]'', signed and dated 1633, was cited with praise by Bartsch; we still know a print with four caricature heads, signed "Biffius" and by Le Blanc referring to it, and four plates he drew and engraved by Cesare Laurenti, with allegorical fights, published in the book ''Amore and Glory''.

Biffi died in 1675. In 1691 his sons Filippo and Giuseppe dedicated a funeral monument to him in the church of [[Sant'Antonio Abate, Milan|St. Antonio Abate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bossaglia|first1=Rossana|title=- Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 10 (1968)|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/carlo-biffi_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|website=Treccani|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

York was born in [[Vineland, New Jersey]] on November 24, 1867, and moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1887.&lt;ref name=GreenBag/&gt;

In June 1889, York graduated with a [[Bachelor of law|LL.B.]] from [[National University School of Law]] (now the [[George Washington University Law School]]) in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The National Law School, Graduates Who Will Receive Degrees Saturday Night|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1889-06-05/ed-1/seq-8/#date1=1873&amp;sort=date&amp;date2=1925&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;index=0&amp;words=Clarence+M+York&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;state=District+of+Columbia&amp;rows=20&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=&amp;phrasetext=Clarence+M.+York&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1|accessdate=September 27, 2017|work=Evening Star (Washington, D.C.)|publisher=Library of Congress Historic Newspapers|date=June 5, 1889|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=National Law School Graduates|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1889-06-10/ed-1/seq-8/#date1=1873&amp;sort=date&amp;date2=1925&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;index=1&amp;words=Clarence+M+York&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;state=District+of+Columbia&amp;rows=20&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=&amp;phrasetext=Clarence+M.+York&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1|accessdate=September 27, 2017|work=Evening star.

'''Computer simulation''' is the reproduction of the behavior of a system using a [[computer]] to simulate the outcomes of a [[mathematical model]] associated with said system. Since they allow to check the reliability of chosen mathematical models, computer simulations have become a useful tool for the mathematical modeling of many natural systems in [[physics]] ([[computational physics]]), [[astrophysics]], [[climatology]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]] and [[manufacturing]], human systems in [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[social science]], [[health care]] and [[engineering]]. Simulation of a system is represented as the running of the system's model. It can be used to explore and gain new insights into new [[technology]] and to estimate the performance of systems too complex for [[analytical solution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Computer simulations are realized by running [[computer program]]s that can be either small, running almost instantly on small devices, or large-scale programs that run for hours or days on network-based groups of computers. The scale of events being simulated by computer simulations has far exceeded anything possible (or perhaps even imaginable) using traditional paper-and-pencil mathematical modeling. Over 10 years ago, a desert-battle simulation of one force invading another involved the modeling of 66,239 tanks, trucks and other vehicles on simulated terrain around [[Kuwait]], using multiple supercomputers in the [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] High Performance Computer Modernization Program.&lt;ref name="JPLsim"&gt;" [http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/97/military.html "Researchers stage largest Military Simulation ever"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122123958/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/97/military.html |date=2008-01-22 }}, [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], [[Caltech]], December 1997,&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the computational cost of simulation, [[computer experiment]]s are used to perform inference such as [[uncertainty quantification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author1=Santner, Thomas J| author2=Williams, Brian J| author3=Notz, William I| title=The design and analysis of computer experiments| year=2003| publisher=Springer Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Simulation versus model ==
A [[computer model]] is the algorithms and equations used to capture the behavior of the system being modeled. By contrast, computer simulation is the actual running of the program that contains these equations or algorithms. Simulation, therefore, is the process of running a model. Thus one would not "build a simulation"; instead, one would "build a model", and then either "run the model" or equivalently "run a simulation".

== History ==
Computer simulation developed hand-in-hand with the rapid growth of the computer, following its first large-scale deployment during the [[Manhattan Project]] in [[World War II]] to model the process of [[nuclear weapon|nuclear detonation]]. It was a simulation of 12 [[hard spheres]] using a [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo algorithm]]. Computer simulation is often used as an adjunct to, or substitute for, modeling systems for which simple [[closed-form solution|closed form analytic solutions]] are not possible. There are many types of computer simulations; their common feature is the attempt to generate a sample of representative scenarios for a model in which a complete enumeration of all possible states of the model would be prohibitive or impossible.

== Data preparation ==
The external data requirements of simulations and models vary widely. For some, the input might be just a few numbers (for example, simulation of a waveform of AC electricity on a wire), while others might require terabytes of information (such as weather and climate models).

Input sources also vary widely:
* Sensors and other physical devices connected to the model;
* Control surfaces used to direct the progress of the simulation in some way;
* Current or historical data entered by hand;
* Values extracted as a by-product from other processes;
* Values output for the purpose by other simulations, models, or processes.

Lastly, the time at which data is available varies:
* "invariant" data is often built into the model code, either because the value is truly invariant (e.g., the value of π) or because the designers consider the value to be invariant for all cases of interest;
* data can be entered into the simulation when it starts up, for example by reading one or more files, or by reading data from a [[preprocessor (CAE)|preprocessor]];
* data can be provided during the simulation run, for example by a sensor network.

Because of this variety, and because diverse simulation systems have many common elements, there are a large number of specialized [[simulation language]]s. The best-known may be [[Simula]] (sometimes called Simula-67, after the year 1967 when it was proposed). There are now many others.

Systems that accept data from external sources must be very careful in knowing what they are receiving. While it is easy for computers to read in values from text or binary files, what is much harder is knowing what the [[accuracy]] (compared to [[Graphic display resolutions|measurement resolution]] and [[Accuracy and precision|precision]]) of the values are. Often they are expressed as "error bars", a minimum and maximum deviation from the value range within which the true value (is expected to) lie. Because digital computer mathematics is not perfect, rounding and truncation errors multiply this error, so it is useful to perform an "error analysis"&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Error Analysis: The Study of Uncertainties in Physical Measurements |author=John Robert Taylor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=giFQcZub80oC&amp;pg=PA128 |pages=128–129 |isbn=0-935702-75-X |year=1999 |publisher=University Science Books |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316103343/http://books.google.com/books?id=giFQcZub80oC&amp;pg=PA128 |archivedate=2015-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to confirm that values output by the simulation will still be usefully accurate.

Even small errors in the original data can accumulate into substantial error later in the simulation. While all computer analysis is subject to the "GIGO" ([[garbage in, garbage out]]) restriction, this is especially true of digital simulation. Indeed, observation of this inherent, cumulative error in digital systems was the main catalyst for the development of [[chaos theory]].

== Types ==
Computer models can be classified according to several independent pairs of attributes, including:
* [[stochastic process|Stochastic]] or [[Deterministic algorithm|deterministic]] (and as a special case of deterministic, chaotic) – see external links below for examples of stochastic vs. deterministic simulations
* Steady-state or dynamic
* [[Continuous function|Continuous]] or [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] (and as an important special case of discrete, [[Discrete event simulation|discrete event]] or DE models)
* [[Dynamic simulation|Dynamic system simulation]], e.g. electric systems, hydraulic systems or multi-body mechanical systems (described primarely by DAE:s) or dynamics simulation of field problems, e.g. CFD of FEM simulations (described by PDE:s).
* Local or [[distributed computing|distributed]].

Another way of categorizing models is to look at the underlying data structures. For time-stepped simulations, there are two main classes:
* Simulations which store their data in regular grids and require only next-neighbor access are called [[stencil code]]s. Many [[Computational fluid dynamics|CFD]] applications belong to this category.
* If the underlying graph is not a regular grid, the model may belong to the [[meshfree method]] class.

Equations define the relationships between elements of the modeled system and attempt to find a state in which the system is in equilibrium. Such models are often used in simulating physical systems, as a simpler modeling case before dynamic simulation is attempted.
*Dynamic simulations model changes in a system in response to (usually changing) input signals.
*''[[stochastic process|Stochastic]]'' models use ''[[random number generator]]s'' to model chance or random events;
*A ''[[discrete event simulation]]'' (DES) manages events in time. Most computer, logic-test and fault-tree simulations are of this type. In this type of simulation, the simulator maintains a queue of events sorted by the simulated time they should occur. The simulator reads the queue and triggers new events as each event is processed. It is not important to execute the simulation in real time. It is often more important to be able to access the data produced by the simulation and to discover logic defects in the design or the sequence of events.
*A ''continuous dynamic simulation'' performs numerical solution of [[Differential algebraic equation|differential-algebraic equations]] or [[differential equations]] (either [[partial differential equation|partial]] or [[ordinary differential equation|ordinary]]). Periodically, the simulation program solves all the equations and uses the numbers to change the state and output of the simulation. Applications include flight simulators, [[construction and management simulation games]], [[chemical process modeling]], and simulations of [[electrical circuit]]s. Originally, these kinds of simulations were actually implemented on [[analog computer]]s, where the differential equations could be represented directly by various electrical components such as [[op-amp]]s. By the late 1980s, however, most "analog" simulations were run on conventional [[digital computer]]s that [[emulator|emulate]] the behavior of an analog computer.
*A special type of discrete simulation that does not rely on a model with an underlying equation, but can nonetheless be represented formally, is [[agent-based model|agent-based simulation]]. In agent-based simulation, the individual entities (such as molecules, cells, trees or consumers) in the model are represented directly (rather than by their density or concentration) and possess an internal state and set of behaviors or rules that determine how the agent's state is updated from one time-step to the next.
*[[Distributed computing|Distributed]] models run on a network of interconnected computers, possibly through the [[Internet]]. Simulations dispersed across multiple host computers like this are often referred to as "distributed simulations". There are several standards for distributed simulation, including [[Aggregate Level Simulation Protocol]] (ALSP), [[Distributed Interactive Simulation]] (DIS), the [[High Level Architecture (simulation)]] (HLA) and the [[Test and Training Enabling Architecture]] (TENA).

== Visualization ==
Formerly, the output data from a computer simulation was sometimes presented in a table or a matrix showing how data were affected by numerous changes in the simulation [[Parameter (computer programming)|parameters]]. The use of the matrix format was related to traditional use of the matrix concept in [[mathematical model]]s. However, psychologists and others noted that humans could quickly perceive trends by looking at graphs or even moving-images or motion-pictures generated from the data, as displayed by [[computer generated imagery|computer-generated-imagery]] (CGI) animation. Although observers could not necessarily read out numbers or quote math formulas, from observing a moving weather chart they might be able to predict events (and "see that rain was headed their way") much faster than by scanning tables of rain-cloud [[coordinate]]s. Such intense graphical displays, which transcended the world of numbers and formulae, sometimes also led to output that lacked a coordinate grid or omitted timestamps, as if straying too far from numeric data displays. Today, [[weather forecasting]] models tend to balance the view of moving rain/snow clouds against a map that uses numeric coordinates and numeric timestamps of events.

Similarly, CGI computer simulations of [[CAT scan]]s can simulate how a [[brain cancer|tumor]] might shrink or change during an extended period of medical treatment, presenting the passage of time as a spinning view of the visible human head, as the tumor changes.

Other applications of CGI computer simulations are being developed to graphically display large amounts of data, in motion, as changes occur during a simulation run.

Generic examples of types of computer simulations in science, which are derived from an underlying mathematical description:
* a numerical simulation of [[differential equation]]s that cannot be solved analytically, theories that involve continuous systems such as phenomena in [[physical cosmology]], [[fluid dynamics]] (e.g., [[climate model]]s, [[roadway noise]] models, [[roadway air dispersion model]]s), [[continuum mechanics]] and [[chemical kinetics]] fall into this category.
* a [[stochastic]] simulation, typically used for discrete systems where events occur [[probabilistic]]ally and which cannot be described directly with differential equations (this is a ''discrete'' simulation in the above sense). Phenomena in this category include [[genetic drift]], [[biochemistry|biochemical]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Ankur|last2=Rawlings|first2=James B.|date=April 2014|title=Comparison of Parameter Estimation Methods in Stochastic Chemical Kinetic Models: Examples in Systems Biology|journal=AIChE Journal |volume=60|issue=4|pages=1253–1268|doi=10.1002/aic.14409|issn=0001-1541|pmc=4946376|pmid=27429455}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[gene regulatory network]]s with small numbers of molecules. (see also: [[Monte Carlo method]]).
* multiparticle simulation of the response of nanomaterials at multiple scales to an applied force for the purpose of modeling their thermoelastic and thermodynamic properties. Techniques used for such simulations are [[Molecular dynamics]], [[Molecular mechanics]], [[Monte Carlo method]], and [[Multiscale Green's function]].

Specific examples of computer simulations follow:
* statistical simulations based upon an agglomeration of a large number of input profiles, such as the forecasting of equilibrium [[temperature]] of [[receiving waters]], allowing the gamut of [[meteorological]] data to be input for a specific locale. This technique was developed for [[thermal pollution]] forecasting.
* agent based simulation has been used effectively in [[ecology]], where it is often called "individual based modeling" and is used in situations for which individual variability in the agents cannot be neglected, such as [[population dynamics]] of [[salmon]] and [[trout]] (most purely mathematical models assume all trout behave identically).
* time stepped dynamic model. In hydrology there are several such [[hydrology transport model]]s such as the [[SWMM]] and [[DSSAM Model]]s developed by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] for river water quality forecasting.
* computer simulations have also been used to formally model theories of human cognition and performance, e.g., [[ACT-R]].
* computer simulation using [[molecular modeling]] for [[drug discovery]].&lt;ref&gt;Atanasov AG, Waltenberger B, Pferschy-Wenzig EM, Linder T, Wawrosch C, Uhrin P, Temml V, Wang L, Schwaiger S, Heiss EH, Rollinger JM, Schuster D, Breuss JM, Bochkov V, Mihovilovic MD, Kopp B, Bauer R, Dirsch VM, Stuppner H. {{doi|10.1016/j.biotechadv.2015.08.001}} Discovery and resupply of pharmacologically active plant-derived natural products: A review.] Biotechnol Adv. 2015, {{PMID|26281720}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*computer simulation to model viral infection in mammalian cells.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* computer simulation for studying the selective sensitivity of bonds by mechanochemistry during grinding of organic molecules.&lt;ref&gt;Mizukami, Koichi ; Saito, Fumio ; Baron, Michel.

* [[Computational fluid dynamics]] simulations are used to simulate the behaviour of flowing air, water and other fluids. One-, two- and three-dimensional models are used. A one-dimensional model might simulate the effects of [[water hammer]] in a pipe. A two-dimensional model might be used to simulate the drag forces on the cross-section of an aeroplane wing. A three-dimensional simulation might estimate the heating and cooling requirements of a large building.
* An understanding of statistical thermodynamic molecular theory is fundamental to the appreciation of molecular solutions. Development of the [[Potential Distribution Theorem]] (PDT) allows this complex subject to be simplified to down-to-earth presentations of molecular theory.

Notable, and sometimes controversial, computer simulations used in science include: [[Donella Meadows]]' [[World3]] used in the ''[[Limits to Growth]]'', [[James Lovelock|James Lovelock's]] [[Daisyworld]] and Thomas Ray's [[Tierra (computer simulation)|Tierra]].

In social sciences, computer simulation is an integral component of the five angles of analysis fostered by the data percolation methodology,&lt;ref&gt;Mesly, Olivier 
(2015). ''Creating Models in Psychological Research.'' United States: Springer Psychology: 126 pages. {{ISBN|978-3-319-15752-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also includes qualitative and quantitative methods, reviews of the literature (including scholarly), and interviews with experts, and which forms an extension of data triangulation.

=== Simulation environments for physics and engineering ===
[[Graphical environment]]s to design simulations have been developed. Special care was taken to handle events (situations in which the simulation equations are not valid and have to be changed). The open project [[Open Source Physics]] was started to develop reusable libraries for simulations in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], together with [[EJS|Easy Java Simulations]], a complete graphical environment that generates code based on these libraries.

=== Simulation environments for linguistics ===
Taiwanese Tone Group Parser&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Y. C. (2017). A Knowledge Representation Method to Implement A Taiwanese Tone Group Parser [In Chinese]. International Journal of Computational Linguistics &amp; Chinese Language Processing; 22:2 2017.12 pp. 73-86&lt;/ref&gt; is a simulator of Taiwanese tone sandhi acquisition.
In practical, the method using linguistic theory to implement the Taiwanese tone group parser is a way to apply [[knowledge engineering]] technique to build the experiment environment of computer simulation for language acquisition. A work-in-process version of artificial tone group parser that includes a [[knowledge base]] and an executable program file for Microsoft Windows system (XP/Win7) can be [http://vikon.myweb.hinet.net/ttgpe.htm download] for evaluation.

== Computer simulation in practical contexts ==
Computer simulations are used in a wide variety of practical contexts, such as:
* analysis of [[air pollutant]] dispersion using [[atmospheric dispersion modeling]]

The reliability and the trust people put in computer simulations depends on the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the simulation [[model (abstract)|model]], therefore [[verification and validation]] are of crucial importance in the development of computer simulations. Another important aspect of computer simulations is that of reproducibility of the results, meaning that a simulation model should not provide a different answer for each execution. Although this might seem obvious, this is a special point of attention in [[stochastic simulation]]s, where random numbers should actually be semi-random numbers. An exception to reproducibility are human-in-the-loop simulations such as flight simulations and [[computer games]]. Here a human is part of the simulation and thus influences the outcome in a way that is hard, if not impossible, to reproduce exactly.

[[Vehicle]] manufacturers make use of computer simulation to test safety features in new designs. By building a copy of the car in a physics simulation environment, they can save the hundreds of thousands of dollars that would otherwise be required to build and test a unique prototype. Engineers can step through the simulation milliseconds at a time to determine the exact stresses being put upon each section of the prototype.&lt;ref&gt;Baase, Sara. A Gift of Fire: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for Computing and the Internet. 3. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2007. Pages 363–364. {{ISBN|0-13-600848-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Computer graphics]] can be used to display the results of a computer simulation. [[Animations]] can be used to experience a simulation in real-time, e.g., in [[Training Simulation|training simulations]]. In some cases animations may also be useful in faster than real-time or even slower than real-time modes. For example, faster than real-time animations can be useful in visualizing the buildup of queues in the simulation of humans evacuating a building. Furthermore, simulation results are often aggregated into static images using various ways of [[scientific visualization]].

In debugging, simulating a program execution under test (rather than executing natively) can detect far more errors than the hardware itself can detect and, at the same time, log useful debugging information such as instruction trace, memory alterations and instruction counts. This technique can also detect [[buffer overflow]] and similar "hard to detect" errors as well as produce performance information and [[Performance tuning|tuning]] data.

== Pitfalls ==
Although sometimes ignored in computer simulations, it is very important to perform a [[sensitivity analysis]] to ensure that the accuracy of the results is properly understood. For example, the probabilistic risk analysis of factors determining the success of an oilfield exploration program involves combining samples from a variety of statistical distributions using the [[Monte Carlo method]]. If, for instance, one of the key parameters (e.g., the net ratio of oil-bearing strata) is known to only one significant figure, then the result of the simulation might not be more precise than one significant figure, although it might (misleadingly) be presented as having four significant figures.

=== Model calibration techniques ===
The following three steps should be used to produce accurate simulation models: calibration, verification, and validation. Computer simulations are good at portraying and comparing theoretical scenarios, but in order to accurately model actual case studies they have to match what is actually happening today. A base model should be created and calibrated so that it matches the area being studied. The calibrated model should then be verified to ensure that the model is operating as expected based on the inputs. Once the model has been verified, the final step is to validate the model by comparing the outputs to historical data from the study area. This can be done by using statistical techniques and ensuring an adequate R-squared value. Unless these techniques are employed, the simulation model created will produce inaccurate results and not be a useful prediction tool.

Model calibration is achieved by adjusting any available parameters in order to adjust how the model operates and simulates the process. For example, in traffic simulation, typical parameters include look-ahead distance, car-following sensitivity, discharge headway, and start-up lost time. These parameters influence driver behavior such as when and how long it takes a driver to change lanes, how much distance a driver leaves between his car and the car in front of it, and how quickly a driver starts to accelerate through an intersection. Adjusting these parameters has a direct effect on the amount of traffic volume that can traverse through the modeled roadway network by making the drivers more or less aggressive. These are examples of calibration parameters that can be fine-tuned to match characteristics observed in the field at the study location. Most traffic models have typical default values but they may need to be adjusted to better match the driver behavior at the specific location being studied.

Model verification is achieved by obtaining output data from the model and comparing them to what is expected from the input data. For example, in traffic simulation, traffic volume can be verified to ensure that actual volume throughput in the model is reasonably close to traffic volumes input into the model. Ten percent is a typical threshold used in traffic simulation to determine if output volumes are reasonably close to input volumes. Simulation models handle model inputs in different ways so traffic that enters the network, for example, may or may not reach its desired destination. Additionally, traffic that wants to enter the network may not be able to, if congestion exists. This is why model verification is a very important part of the modeling process.

The final step is to validate the model by comparing the results with what is expected based on historical data from the study area. Ideally, the model should produce similar results to what has happened historically. This is typically verified by nothing more than quoting the R-squared statistic from the fit. This statistic measures the fraction of variability that is accounted for by the model. A high R-squared value does not necessarily mean the model fits the data well. Another tool used to validate models is graphical residual analysis. If model output values drastically differ from historical values, it probably means there is an error in the model. Before using the model as a base to produce additional models, it is important to verify it for different scenarios to ensure that each one is accurate. If the outputs do not reasonably match historic values during the validation process, the model should be reviewed and updated to produce results more in line with expectations. It is an iterative process that helps to produce more realistic models.

Validating traffic simulation models requires comparing traffic estimated by the model to observed traffic on the roadway and transit systems. Initial comparisons are for trip interchanges between quadrants, sectors, or other large areas of interest. The next step is to compare traffic estimated by the models to traffic counts, including transit ridership, crossing contrived barriers in the study area. These are typically called screenlines, cutlines, and cordon lines and may be imaginary or actual physical barriers. Cordon lines surround particular areas such as a city's central business district or other major activity centers. Transit ridership estimates are commonly validated by comparing them to actual patronage crossing cordon lines around the central business district.

Three sources of error can cause weak correlation during calibration: input error, model error, and parameter error. In general, input error and parameter error can be adjusted easily by the user. Model error however is caused by the methodology used in the model and may not be as easy to fix. Simulation models are typically built using several different modeling theories that can produce conflicting results. Some models are more generalized while others are more detailed. If model error occurs as a result, in may be necessary to adjust the model methodology to make results more consistent.

In order to produce good models that can be used to produce realistic results, these are the necessary steps that need to be taken in order to ensure that simulation models are functioning properly. Simulation models can be used as a tool to verify engineering theories, but they are only valid if calibrated properly. Once satisfactory estimates of the parameters for all models have been obtained, the models must be checked to assure that they adequately perform the intended functions. The validation process establishes the credibility of the model by demonstrating its ability to replicate actual traffic patterns. The importance of model validation underscores the need for careful planning, thoroughness and accuracy of the input data collection program that has this purpose. Efforts should be made to ensure collected data is consistent with expected values. For example, in traffic analysis it is typical for a traffic engineer to perform a site visit to verify traffic counts and become familiar with traffic patterns in the area. The resulting models and forecasts will be no better than the data used for model estimation and validation.

Death – particularly the death of [[human]]s – has commonly been considered a [[sadness|sad]] or unpleasant occasion, due to the [[affection]] for the being that has died and the termination of social and familial [[human bonding|bonds]] with the deceased. Other concerns include [[death anxiety (psychology)|fear of death]], [[necrophobia]], [[anxiety]], [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]], [[grief]], [[emotional pain]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[sympathy]], [[compassion]], [[solitude]], or [[saudade]]. Many cultures and religions have the idea of an [[afterlife]], and also hold the idea of [[Heaven|reward]] or [[Judgement (afterlife)|judgement]] and [[Hell|punishment for past sin]].

== Etymology ==
The word death comes from [[Old English]] ''dēaþ'', which in turn comes from Proto-Germanic *''dauþuz'' (reconstructed by etymological analysis). This comes from the Proto-Indo-European stem *''dheu-'' meaning the "process, act, condition of dying".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=death |title=Death |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013162848/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=death |archivedate=13 October 2016 |deadurl=no |accessdate=5 November 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leonardo Skeleton 1511.jpg|thumb|''Study of Skeletons'', c. 1510, by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]]]
The concept and symptoms of death, and varying degrees of delicacy used in discussion in public forums, have generated numerous scientific, legal, and socially acceptable terms or euphemisms for death.  When a person has died, it is also said they have ''passed away'', ''passed on'', ''expired'', or are ''gone'', among numerous other socially accepted, religiously specific, slang, and irreverent terms. Bereft of life, the dead person is then a ''corpse'', ''[[cadaver]]'', a ''body'', a ''set of remains'', and when all flesh has rotted away, a [[skeleton]]. The terms ''[[carrion]]'' and ''carcass'' can also be used, though these more often connote the remains of non-human animals.  As a polite reference to a dead person, it has become common practice to use the [[participle]] form of "decease", as in ''the deceased''; another noun form is ''decedent''.  The ashes left after a [[cremation]] are sometimes referred to by the [[neologism]] ''cremains'', a [[portmanteau]] of "cremation" and "remains".

== Senescence ==
[[File:Dead magpie.jpg|thumb|alt=A dead magpie|A dead [[Eurasian magpie]]]]

[[Senescence]] refers to a scenario when a living being is able to survive all calamities, but eventually dies due to causes relating to old age. Animal and plant cells normally reproduce and function during the whole period of natural existence, but the aging process derives from deterioration of cellular activity and ruination of regular functioning. Aptitude of cells for gradual deterioration and mortality means that cells are naturally sentenced to stable and long-term loss of living capacities, even despite continuing metabolic reactions and viability. In the United Kingdom, for example, nine out of ten of all the deaths that occur on a daily basis relates to senescence, while around the world it accounts for two-thirds of 150,000 deaths that take place daily (Hayflick &amp; Moody, 2003).

Almost all [[animal]]s who survive external hazards to their biological functioning eventually die from [[Senescence|biological aging]], known in life sciences as "senescence". Some organisms experience [[negligible senescence]], even exhibiting [[biological immortality]].  These include the jellyfish ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jellyfishfacts.net/turritopsis-nutricula-immortal-jellyfish.html |title=Turritopsis nutricula (Immortal jellyfish) |publisher=Jellyfishfacts.net |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013163459/http://www.jellyfishfacts.net/turritopsis-nutricula-immortal-jellyfish.html |archivedate=13 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Hydra (genus)|hydra]], and the [[planarian]]. Unnatural causes of death include [[suicide]] and [[homicide]]. From all causes, roughly 150,000 people die around the world each day.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aubrey D.N.J |first=de Grey |authorlink=Aubrey de Grey |title=Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations |journal=Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology |volume=1 |issue=1, Article 5 |year=2007 |url=http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.2202/1941-6008.1011 |accessdate=20 March 2009 |ref=harv |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013163622/http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf |archivedate=13 October 2016|citeseerx=10.1.1.395.745 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, two thirds die directly or indirectly due to senescence, but in industrialized countries – such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany – the rate approaches 90%, i.e., nearly nine out of ten of all deaths are related to senescence.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt;

[[Physiological]] death is now seen as a process, more than an event: conditions once considered indicative of death are now reversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crippen |first=David |website=Scientific American Surgery, Critical Care, April 2005 |url=http://www.sciamsurgery.com/sciamsurgery/institutional/payPerAdd.action?chapterId=part08_ch10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624132446/http://www.acssurgery.com/abstracts/acs/acs0812.htm |archivedate=24 June 2006 |title=Brain Failure and Brain Death |accessdate=9 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where in the process a dividing line is drawn between life and death depends on factors beyond the presence or absence of [[vital signs]]. In general, [[clinical death]] is neither necessary nor sufficient for a determination of [[legal death]].

===Signs===
Signs of death or strong indications that a [[endotherm|warm-blooded animal]] is no longer alive are:
* [[Respiratory arrest]] (no [[breathing]])
* [[Cardiac arrest]] (no [[heart rate|pulse]])
* [[Brain death]] (no neuronal activity)
* {{lang|la|[[Pallor mortis]]}}, paleness which happens in the 15–120 minutes after death
* {{lang|la|[[Livor mortis]]}}, a settling of the blood in the lower (dependent) portion of the body
* {{lang|la|[[Algor mortis]]}}, the reduction in body temperature following death. This is generally a steady decline until matching ambient temperature
* {{lang|la|[[Rigor mortis]]}}, the limbs of the corpse become stiff (Latin ''rigor'') and difficult to move or manipulate
* [[Decomposition]], the reduction into simpler forms of matter, accompanied by a strong, unpleasant odor.

One of the challenges in defining death is in distinguishing it from [[life]]. As a point in time, death would seem to refer to the moment at which life ends. Determining when death has occurred is difficult, as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Crossing Over: How Science Is Redefining Life and Death |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/04/dying-death-brain-dead-body-consciousness-science/ |author=Henig, Robin Marantz |authorlink=Robin Marantz Henig |publisher=''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' |date=April 2016 |accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such determination therefore requires drawing precise conceptual boundaries between life and death. This is difficult, due to there being little consensus on how to define life. This general problem applies to the particular challenge of defining death in the context of medicine.

It is possible to define life in terms of consciousness. When consciousness ceases, a living organism can be said to have died. One of the flaws in this approach is that there are many organisms which are alive but probably not conscious (for example, single-celled organisms). Another problem is in defining consciousness, which has many different definitions given by modern scientists, psychologists and philosophers.  Additionally, many religious traditions, including [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] and [[Dharmic religions|Dharmic]] traditions, hold that death does not (or may not) entail the end of consciousness.  In certain cultures, death is more of a process than a single event. It implies a slow shift from one spiritual state to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1991 |last=Metcalf |first=Peter |last2=Huntington |first2=Richard |title=Celebrations of Death: The Anthropology of Mortuary Ritual |publisher=Cambridge Press |place=New York}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other definitions for death focus on the character of cessation of something.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary{{clarify|date=January 2014|reason=This is not a proper reference citation. Use Template:Cite web or similar to provide source details.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=January 2014|reason=&lt;nowiki&gt;This is not a proper reference citation. Use Template:Cite web or similar to provide source details. Use &lt;ref...&gt; inline in the article (see WP:CITE) to source the specific facts provided by this reference.&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} In this context "death" describes merely the state where something has ceased, for example, life. Thus, the definition of "life" simultaneously defines death.

Historically, attempts to define the exact moment of a human's death have been subjective, or imprecise. Death was once defined as the cessation of [[heart]]beat ([[cardiac arrest]]) and of [[breath]]ing, but the development of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and prompt [[defibrillation]] have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted. Events which were [[causality|causally]] linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances; without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of [[life support]] devices, [[organ transplants]] and [[artificial pacemaker]]s.

Today, where a definition of the moment of death is required, doctors and coroners usually turn to "brain death" or "biological death" to define a person as being dead; people are considered dead when the electrical activity in their brain ceases. It is presumed that an end of electrical activity indicates the end of [[consciousness]]. Suspension of consciousness must be permanent, and not transient, as occurs during certain [[non-rapid eye movement sleep|sleep]] stages, and especially a [[coma]]. In the case of sleep, [[electroencephalography|EEGs]] can easily tell the difference.

The category of "brain death" is seen as problematic by some scholars. For instance, Dr. Franklin Miller, senior faculty member at the Department of Bioethics, National Institutes of Health, notes: "By the late 1990s... the equation of brain death with death of the human being was increasingly challenged by scholars, based on evidence regarding the array of biological functioning displayed by patients correctly diagnosed as having this condition who were maintained on mechanical ventilation for substantial periods of time. These patients maintained the ability to sustain circulation and respiration, control temperature, excrete wastes, heal wounds, fight infections and, most dramatically, to gestate fetuses (in the case of pregnant "brain-dead" women)."&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller |first=F.G. |title=Death and organ donation: back to the future |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |date=October 2009 |volume=35 |issue=10 |pages=616–620 |doi=10.1136/jme.2009.030627 |pmid=19793942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those people maintaining that only the [[neo-cortex]] of the brain is necessary for consciousness sometimes argue that only electrical activity should be considered when defining death. Eventually it is possible that the criterion for death will be the permanent and irreversible loss of [[cognition|cognitive]] function, as evidenced by the death of the [[cerebral cortex]]. All hope of recovering human thought and [[personality psychology|personality]] is then gone given current and foreseeable medical technology. At present, in most places the more conservative definition of death&amp;nbsp;– irreversible cessation of electrical activity in the whole brain, as opposed to just in the neo-cortex&amp;nbsp;– has been adopted (for example the [[Uniform Determination Of Death Act]] in the United States). In 2005, the [[Terri Schiavo case]] brought the question of brain death and artificial sustenance to the front of [[Politics of the United States|American politics]].

Even by whole-brain criteria, the determination of brain death can be complicated. EEGs can detect spurious electrical impulses, while certain [[drugs]], [[hypoglycemia]], [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], or [[hypothermia]] can suppress or even stop brain activity on a temporary basis. Because of this, hospitals have protocols for determining brain death involving EEGs at widely separated intervals under defined conditions.

The death of a person has legal consequences that may vary between different jurisdictions.
A [[death certificate]] is issued in most jurisdictions, either by a doctor, or by an administrative office upon presentation of a doctor's declaration of death.

[[File:Wiertz burial.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine Wiertz]]'s painting of a man buried alive]]
There are many anecdotal references to people being declared dead by physicians and then "coming back to life", sometimes days later in their own coffin, or when [[embalming]] procedures are about to begin. From the mid-18th century onwards, there was an upsurge in the public's fear of being mistakenly buried alive,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before [[burial]], ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet or into the [[rectum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|pp=56,&amp;nbsp;71.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1895, the physician J.C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700 people were buried prematurely each year in [[England]] and [[Wales]], although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases of [[electric shock]], [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) for an hour or longer can allow stunned [[nerve]]s to recover, allowing an apparently dead person to survive. People found unconscious under icy water may survive if their faces are kept continuously cold until they arrive at an [[emergency department|emergency room]].&lt;ref name=Limmer&gt;{{cite book|title=Brady Emergency Care AHA |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-159390-9 |author=Limmer, Dan; O'Keefe, Michael F.; Bergeron, J.

As medical technologies advance, ideas about when death occurs may have to be re-evaluated in light of the ability to restore a person to vitality after longer periods of apparent death (as happened when CPR and defibrillation showed that cessation of heartbeat is inadequate as a decisive indicator of death). The lack of electrical brain activity may not be enough to consider someone scientifically dead. Therefore, the concept of information-theoretic death&lt;ref name="InfoDeath"&gt;{{cite web

{{See also|List of causes of death by rate|List of preventable causes of death}}

The leading cause of human death in [[developing countries]] is [[infectious disease]]. The leading causes in [[developed countries]] are [[atherosclerosis]] ([[heart disease]] and [[stroke]]), [[cancer]], and other diseases related to [[obesity]] and [[aging]]. By an extremely wide margin, the largest unifying cause of death in the developed world is biological aging,&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt; leading to various complications known as [[aging-associated diseases]]. These conditions cause loss of [[homeostasis]], leading to [[cardiac arrest]], causing loss of [[oxygen]] and nutrient supply, causing irreversible deterioration of the [[Human brain|brain]] and other [[tissue (biology)|tissues]]. Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds die of age-related causes.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt; In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, approaching 90%.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt; With improved medical capability, dying has become [[respite care|a condition to be managed]]. Home deaths, once commonplace, are now rare in the developed world.

According to [[Jean Ziegler]] ([[United Nations]] Special Reporter on the Right to Food, 2000 – Mar 2008), mortality due to [[malnutrition]] accounted for 58% of the total mortality rate in 2006.

Many leading developed world causes of death can be postponed by [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and [[physical fitness|physical activity]], but the accelerating incidence of disease with age still imposes limits on human [[longevity]]. The [[evolution of aging|evolutionary cause of aging]] is, at best, only just beginning to be understood. It has been suggested that direct intervention in the aging process may now be the most effective intervention against major causes of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olshansky |first=S.

[[Hans Selye|Selye]] proposed a unified non-specific approach to many causes of death. He demonstrated that [[Stress (biology)|stress]] decreases adaptability of an organism and proposed to describe the adaptability as a special resource, ''adaptation energy''. The animal dies when this resource is exhausted.&lt;ref name="SelyeAE2"&gt;Selye, H. (1938). Experimental evidence supporting the conception of "adaptation energy", Am. J. Physiol. 123 (1938), 758–765.&lt;/ref&gt; Selye assumed that  the adaptability is a finite supply, presented at birth. Later on, Goldstone proposed the concept of a production or income of adaptation energy which may be stored (up to a limit), as a capital reserve of adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goldstone B |year=1952 |title=The general practitioner and the general adaptation syndrome |journal=South African Medical Journal |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=106–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent works,  adaptation energy is considered as an internal coordinate on the "dominant path" in the model of adaptation. It is demonstrated that oscillations of well-being appear when the reserve of adaptability is almost exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gorban A.N. |author2=Tyukina T.A. |author3=Smirnova E.V. |author4=Pokidysheva L.I. |year=2016 |title=Evolution of adaptation mechanisms: adaptation energy, stress, and oscillating death|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287251014 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2015.12.017 |pmid=26801872 |journal=J.

In high-income and middle income countries nearly half up to more than two thirds of all people live beyond the age of 70 and predominantly die of chronic diseases.

=== Autopsy ===
[[File:Rembrandt - The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp.jpg|thumb|alt=A painting of an autopsy, by Rembrandt, entitled "The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp"|An autopsy is portrayed in ''[[The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'', by [[Rembrandt]]]]
An [[autopsy]], also known as a ''postmortem examination'' or an ''obduction'', is a [[medical procedure]] that consists of a thorough [[Medical examination|examination]] of a human [[dead body|corpse]] to determine the cause and manner of a person's death and to evaluate any [[disease]] or [[injury]] that may be present. It is usually performed by a specialized [[physician|medical doctor]] called a [[pathologist]].

Autopsies are either performed for legal or medical purposes. A forensic autopsy is carried out when the cause of death may be a criminal matter, while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death, or for research purposes. Autopsies can be further classified into cases where external examination suffices, and those where the body is dissected and an internal examination is conducted. Permission from [[next of kin]] may be required for internal autopsy in some cases. Once an internal autopsy is complete the body is generally reconstituted by sewing it back together. Autopsy is important in a medical environment and may shed light on mistakes and help improve practices.

A "necropsy" is an older term for a postmortem examination, unregulated, and not always a medical procedure. In modern times the term is more often used in the postmortem examination of the corpses of animals.

== Cryonics ==
[[File:Cryo surgery.jpg|thumb|Technicians prepare a body for cryopreservation in 1985.]]
{{Main|Cryonics}}

[[Cryonics]] (from Greek κρύος 'kryos-' meaning 'icy cold') is the [[cryopreservation|low-temperature preservation]] of animals and humans who cannot be sustained by contemporary medicine, with the hope that healing and [[wikt:resuscitate|resuscitation]] may be possible in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McKie|first=Robin |title=Cold facts about cryonics |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/jul/14/medicalscience.science |newspaper=[[The Oalobserver]] |date=13 July 2002 |accessdate=1 December 2013 |quote="Cryonics, which began in the Fifties, is the freezing – usually in liquid nitrogen – of human beings who have been legally declared dead.

== Life extension ==
{{Main|Life extension}}

Life extension refers to an increase in [[maximum life span|maximum]] or [[life expectancy|average lifespan]], especially in humans, by slowing down or reversing the [[senescence|processes of aging]]. Average lifespan is determined by vulnerability to [[accident]]s and age or lifestyle-related afflictions such as [[cancer]], or [[cardiovascular disease]]. Extension of average lifespan can be achieved by good [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[exercise]] and avoidance of hazards such as [[tobacco smoking|smoking]]. Maximum lifespan is also determined by the rate of [[aging]] for a species inherent in its [[gene]]s. Currently, the only widely recognized method of extending maximum lifespan is [[calorie restriction]]. Theoretically, extension of maximum lifespan can be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage, by [[tissue engineering|periodic replacement of damaged tissues]], or by [[nanobiotechnology|molecular repair]] or [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] of deteriorated cells and tissues.

A United States poll found that religious people and irreligious people, as well as men and women and people of different economic classes have similar rates of support for life extension, while Africans and Hispanics have higher rates of support than white people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |title=Living to 120 and Beyond: Americans' Views on Aging, Medical Advances and Radical Life Extension |date=6 August 2013 |publisher=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project |website=Pew Research Center |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130816050024/http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |archivedate=16 August 2013 |accessdate=19 September 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 38 percent of the polled said they would desire to have their aging process cured.

Researchers of life extension are a subclass of biogerontologists known as "biomedical [[gerontologist]]s". They try to understand the nature of aging and they develop treatments to reverse aging processes or to at least slow them down, for the improvement of health and the maintenance of youthful vigor at every stage of life. Those who take advantage of life extension findings and seek to apply them upon themselves are called "life extensionists" or "longevists". The primary life extension strategy currently is to apply available anti-aging methods in the hope of living long enough to benefit from a complete cure to aging once it is developed.

In society, the nature of death and humanity's [[Mortality salience|awareness of its own mortality]] has for millennia been a concern of the world's [[religious traditions]] and of [[philosophy|philosophical inquiry]]. This includes belief in [[resurrection]] or an [[afterlife]] (associated with [[Abrahamic religions]]), [[reincarnation]] or rebirth (associated with [[Dharmic religions]]), or that consciousness permanently ceases to exist, known as [[eternal oblivion]] (associated with [[atheism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fuKB8MPMdG4C&amp;pg=PA18 |title=Handbook to the Afterlife |last1=Heath |first1=Pamela Rae |last2=Klimo |first2=Jon |publisher=North Atlantic Books |year=2010 |page=18 |isbn=978-1-55643-869-1 |accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commemoration ceremonies after death may include various [[mourning]], [[funeral]] practices and ceremonies of honouring the deceased. The physical remains of a person, commonly known as a ''corpse'' or ''body'', are usually [[burial|interred]] whole or [[cremated]], though among the world's cultures there are a variety of other methods of [[Disposal of human corpses|mortuary disposal]]. In the English language, blessings directed towards a dead person include ''[[rest in peace]]'', or its [[initialism]] RIP.

Death is the center of many traditions and organizations; customs relating to death are a feature of every culture around the world. Much of this revolves around the care of the dead, as well as the [[afterlife]] and the disposal of bodies upon the onset of death. The [[disposal of human corpses]] does, in general, begin with the [[last offices]] before significant time has passed, and ritualistic ceremonies often occur, most commonly interment or [[cremation]]. This is not a unified practice; in [[Tibet]], for instance, the body is given a [[sky burial]] and left on a mountain top. Proper preparation for death and techniques and ceremonies for producing the ability to transfer one's spiritual attainments into another body ([[reincarnation]]) are subjects of detailed study in Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mullin|1999|p=}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mummification]] or [[embalming]] is also prevalent in some cultures, to retard the rate of [[Decomposition|decay]].

Legal aspects of death are also part of many cultures, particularly the settlement of the deceased [[estate (law)|estate]] and the issues of [[inheritance]] and in some countries, [[inheritance tax]]ation.

[[File:Grave stone2.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=Gravestones in Japan|Gravestones in [[Kyoto]], Japan]]
[[Capital punishment]] is also a culturally divisive aspect of death. In most jurisdictions where capital punishment is carried out today, the death penalty is reserved for premeditated [[murder]], [[espionage]], [[treason]], or as part of [[military justice]]. In some countries, sexual crimes, such as [[adultery]] and [[sodomy]], carry the death penalty, as do religious crimes such as [[apostasy]], the formal renunciation of one's religion. In many [[Use of capital punishment by nation|retentionist]] countries, [[drug trafficking]] is also a capital offense. In China, [[Trafficking in human beings|human trafficking]] and serious cases of [[political corruption|corruption]] are also punished by the death penalty. In militaries around the world [[courts-martial]] have imposed death sentences for offenses such as [[cowardice]], [[desertion]], [[insubordination]], and [[mutiny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |title=Shot at Dawn, campaign for pardons for British and Commonwealth soldiers executed in World War I |publisher=Shot at Dawn Pardons Campaign |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004030535/http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |archivedate=4 October 2006 |accessdate=20 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death in warfare and in [[suicide attack]] also have cultural links, and the ideas of [[dulce et decorum est pro patria mori]], [[mutiny]] punishable by death, grieving relatives of dead soldiers and [[death notification]] are embedded in many cultures. Recently in the western world, with the increase in terrorism following the [[September 11 attacks]], but also further back in time with suicide bombings, [[kamikaze]] missions in [[World War II]] and suicide missions in a host of other conflicts in history, death for a cause by way of suicide attack, and [[martyrdom]] have had significant cultural impacts.

[[Suicide]] in general, and particularly [[euthanasia]], are also points of cultural debate. Both acts are understood very differently in different cultures. In [[Japan]], for example, ending a life with honor by [[seppuku]] was considered a desirable death, whereas according to traditional Christian and Islamic cultures, suicide is viewed as a sin. [[Death (personification)|Death is personified]] in many cultures, with such symbolic representations as the [[Grim Reaper]], [[Azrael]], the [[Hindu]] God [[Yama]] and [[Father Time]].

In [[Brazil]], a human death is counted officially when it is registered by existing family members at a cartório, a government-authorized registry.  Before being able to file for an official death, the deceased must have been registered for an official birth at the cartório.  Though a Public Registry Law guarantees all Brazilian citizens the right to register deaths, regardless of their financial means, of their family members (often children), the Brazilian government has not taken away the burden, the hidden costs and fees, of filing for a death. For many impoverished families, the indirect costs and burden of filing for a death lead to a more appealing, unofficial, local, cultural burial, which in turn raises the debate about inaccurate [[mortality rates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nations |first=Marilyn K. |last2=Amaral |first2=Mara Lucia |title=Flesh, Blood, Souls, and Households: Cultural Validity in Mortality Inquiry |journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly |date=September 1999 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=204–220 |doi=10.1525/maq.1991.5.3.02a00020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talking about death and witnessing it is a difficult issue with most cultures. Western societies may like to treat the dead with the utmost material respect, with an official embalmer and associated rites. Eastern societies (like India) may be more open to accepting it as a ''fait accompli'', with a funeral procession of the dead body ending in an open air burning-to-ashes of the same.

== Consciousness ==
{{Main|Consciousness after death}}

Much interest and debate surround the question of what happens to one's consciousness as one's body dies. The belief in the permanent loss of consciousness after death is often called ''[[eternal oblivion]]''. Belief that the [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]] is preserved after physical death is described by the term ''[[afterlife]]''.

== In biology ==
[[File:Earthworm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Earthworm]]s are a good example of soil-dwelling detritivores.]]
After death the remains of an organism become part of the [[biogeochemical cycle]]. Animals may be [[necrophagy|consumed]] by a [[predator]] or a [[scavenger]]. [[Organic material]] may then be further decomposed by [[detritivore]]s, organisms which recycle [[detritus]], returning it to the environment for reuse in the [[food chain]], where these chemicals may eventually end up being consumed and assimilated into the cells of a living organism. Examples of detritivores include [[earthworm]]s, [[woodlice]] and [[dung beetle]]s.

[[Microorganism]]s also play a vital role, raising the temperature of the decomposing matter as they break it down into yet simpler molecules. Not all materials need to be decomposed fully. [[Coal]], a [[fossil fuel]] formed over vast tracts of time in [[swamp]] ecosystems, is one example.

=== Natural selection ===
{{Main|Competition (biology)|Natural selection|Extinction}}

Contemporary [[history of evolutionary thought|evolutionary theory]] sees death as an important part of the process of [[natural selection]]. It is considered that organisms less [[adaptation|adapted]] to their environment are more likely to die having produced fewer offspring, thereby reducing their contribution to the [[gene pool]]. Their genes are thus eventually bred out of a population, leading at worst to [[extinction]] and, more positively, making the process possible, referred to as [[speciation]]. Frequency of [[biological reproduction|reproduction]] plays an equally important role in determining species survival: an organism that dies young but leaves numerous offspring displays, according to [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] criteria, much greater [[Darwinian fitness|fitness]] than a long-lived organism leaving only one.

=== Extinction ===
{{Main|Extinction}}
[[File:ExtinctDodoBird.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Painting of a dodo|A [[dodo]], the bird that became a [[byword (saying)|byword]] in the English language for the extinction of a species&lt;ref name="Diamond"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diamond |first=Jared M. |authorlink=Jared Diamond |title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies |edition=illustrated, reprint |publisher=[[W.W. Norton]] |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-393-31755-8 |pages=43–44 |chapter=Up to the Starting Line|title-link=Guns, Germs, and Steel }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Extinction is the cessation of existence of a species or group of [[Taxon|taxa]], reducing [[biodiversity]]. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of that species (although the [[population bottleneck|capacity to breed and recover]] may have been lost before this point). Because a species' potential [[range (biology)|range]] may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as [[Lazarus taxon|Lazarus taxa]], where species presumed extinct abruptly "reappear" (typically in the [[fossil]] record) after a period of apparent absence. New species arise through the process of [[speciation]], an aspect of [[evolution]]. New varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an [[ecological niche]] – and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition.

=== Evolution of aging and mortality ===
{{Main|Evolution of aging}}

Inquiry into the evolution of aging aims to explain why so many living things and the vast majority of animals weaken and die with age (exceptions include ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and the already cited jellyfish ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'', which research shows to be [[biological immortality|biologically immortal]]). The evolutionary origin of [[senescence]] remains one of the fundamental puzzles of biology. [[Gerontology]] specializes in the science of human aging processes.

Organisms showing only [[asexual reproduction]] (e.g. [[bacteria]], some [[protist]]s, like the [[euglenoid]]s and many [[amoebozoan]]s) and [[unicellular]] organisms with [[sexual reproduction]] ([[Colony (biology)|colonial]] or not, like the [[Volvocales|volvocine]] algae ''[[Pandorina]]'' and ''[[Chlamydomonas]]'') are "immortal" at some extent, dying only due to external hazards, like being eaten or meeting with a fatal accident. In [[multicellular]] organisms (and also in [[multinucleate]] [[ciliates]]),&lt;ref&gt;Beukeboom, L. &amp; Perrin, N. (2014). ''The Evolution of Sex Determination''. Online Chapter 2: [http://global.oup.com/booksites/content/9780199657148/ The diversity of sexual cycles], p. 12. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[Weismann barrier|Weismannist development]], that is, with a division of labor between mortal [[somatic cells|somatic (body) cells]] and "immortal" [[germ cell|germ (reproductive) cells]], death becomes an essential part of life, at least for the somatic line.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert |first=S.F. |year=2003 |title=Developmental biology |edition=7th |place=Sunderland, Mass |publisher=Sinauer Associates |pages=34–35 |isbn=978-0-87893-258-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Volvox]]'' algae are among the simplest organisms to exhibit that division of labor between two completely different cell types, and as a consequence include death of somatic line as a regular, genetically regulated part of its [[Biological life cycle|life history]].&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00497-010-0158-4 |pmid=21174128 |pmc=3098969 |title=Evolution of reproductive development in the volvocine algae |last=Hallmann |first=A. |journal=Sexual Plant Reproduction |date=June 2011 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=97–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious views ==
Death is an important subject of religious doctrine.

=== Buddhism ===
{{See also|Anussati#The ten recollections}}

In Buddhist doctrine and practice, death plays an important role. Awareness of death was what motivated [[Gautama Buddha|Prince Siddhartha]] to strive to find the [[amrta#Theravada Buddhism|"deathless"]] and finally to attain [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]]. In Buddhist doctrine, death functions as a reminder of the value of [[Human beings in Buddhism|having been born as a human being]]. Being reborn as a human being is considered the only state in which one can attain  enlightenment, therefore death helps remind oneself that one should not that for granted. The belief in rebirth among Buddhists does not necessarily remove [[existential angst|death anxiety]], since all existence in the [[samsara (Buddhism)|cycle of rebirth]] is considered filled with [[dukkha|suffering]], and being reborn many times does not necessarily mean that one progresses.&lt;ref name="Blum 2004"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|last=Blum|first=Mark L.|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|volume=1|title=Death|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference, [[Thomson Gale]]|location=New York |isbn=978-0-02-865720-2|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death is part of several key Buddhist tenets, such as the [[Four Noble Truths]] and [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]].&lt;ref name="Blum 2004" /&gt;

=== Judaism ===
[[File:Yahrtzeit candle.JPG|thumb|A [[yahrtzeit candle]] lit in memory of a loved one on the anniversary of the death]]
{{see also|Bereavement in Judaism}}
Death is seen in Judaism as tragic and intimidating.  Persons who come into contact with corpses are [[Tumah and taharah|ritually impure]].  There are a [[Jewish eschatology#The world to come|variety of beliefs about the afterlife]] within Judaism, but none of them contradict the preference of life over death.  This is partially because death puts a cessation to the possibility of fulfilling any [[Mitzvah|commandments]].&lt;ref&gt;Soloveitchik, Joseph B.  ''Halakhic Man.'' Qtd. in [https://elmad.pardes.org/2018/04/tazria-metzora-understanding-purity/ Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|dignity as a matter of philosophy, religion, human rights, law and medicine}}

'''Dignity''' is the [[Rights|right]] of a person to be valued and respected for their own sake, and to be treated ethically. It is of significance in [[morality]], [[ethics]], [[law]] and [[politics]] as an extension of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-era concepts of [[Inalienable right#Debate|inherent, inalienable rights]]. The term may also be used to describe personal conduct, as in "behaving with dignity".

== Etymology ==
The English word "dignity", attested from the early 13th century, comes from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''dignitas'' (worthiness)&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

by way of [[French language|French]] ''dignité''.&lt;ref name = "DIC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dignity|title=Dignity - Define Dignity at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern use ==
English-speakers often use the word "dignity" in proscriptive and cautionary ways: for example, in politics it can be used to critique the treatment of oppressed and [[social vulnerability|vulnerable]] groups and peoples, but it has also been applied to cultures and sub-cultures, to religious beliefs and ideals, and even to animals used for food or research.

"Dignity" also has descriptive meanings pertaining to the ''worth'' of human beings. In general, the term has various functions and meanings depending on how the term is used and on the context.&lt;ref name="Shultziner, D. Human Dignity - Functions and Meanings. Global Jurist"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shultziner|first1=Doron|title=Human Dignity - Functions and Meanings|journal=Global Jurist|date=2003|volume=3|issue=3|pages=1–21|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Doron_Shultziner/publication/241002874_Human_Dignity_Functions_and_Meanings/links/00b7d522ad17e53070000000.pdf|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ordinary modern usage, the word denotes "respect" and "status", and it is often used to suggest that someone is not receiving a proper degree of respect, or even that they are failing to treat themselves with proper self-respect. There is also a long history of special [[philosophical]] use of this term. However, it is rarely defined outright in political, legal, and scientific discussions.  International proclamations have thus far left dignity undefined,&lt;ref&gt;
"Those provisions concerning human dignity have not been authoritatively interpreted or applied by any of the competent, independent, international institutions." Bartha Maria Knoppers, ''Human Dignity and Genetic Heritage: Study Paper'' (Law Reform Commission of Canada, 1991), note, at 23. None of the international proclamations make dignity the rare quality that some commentators say it should be.

&lt;/ref&gt;
and scientific commentators, such as those arguing against genetic research and [[algeny]], cite dignity as a reason but are ambiguous about its application.&lt;ref&gt;

== Violations ==

=== Categories ===
Human dignity can be violated in multiple ways.  The main categories of violations are:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book | title=Humiliation, Degradation, Dehumanization: Human Dignity Violated | isbn=9789048196616 | editors=Paulus Kaufmann, Hannes Kuch, Christian Neuhäuser, and Elaine Webster | publisher=Springer }} &lt;!-- Entire book, but especially pages 51–52, 151, 168 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Humiliation]]
Violations of human dignity in terms of humiliation refer to acts that humiliate or diminish the self-worth of a person or a group. Acts of humiliation are context dependent but we normally have an intuitive understanding where such a violation occurs. As Schachter noted, “it has been generally assumed that a violation of human dignity can be recognized even if the abstract term cannot be defined. ‘I know it when I see it even if I cannot tell you what it is’”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schachter|first1=Oskar|title=Human dignity as a normative concept|journal=American Journal of International Law|date=1983|volume=77|issue=4|page=849|doi=10.2307/2202536|jstor=2202536}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, etymology of the word “humiliation” has a universal characteristic in the sense that in all languages the word involves “downward spatial orientation” in which “something or someone is pushed down and forcefully held there”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Linder|first1=Evelin|title=Making enemies: Humiliation and international conflict|date=2006|publisher=Praeger Security International|location=Westport, CT|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is common in judicial decisions where judges refer to violations of human dignity as injuries to people's self-worth or their self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shultziner|first1=Doron|last2=Rabinovici|first2=Itai|title=Human Dignity, Self-Worth and Humiliation: A Comparative Legal–Psychological Approach|journal=Psychology, Public Policy, and Law|date=2012|volume=18|issue=1|pages=105|doi=10.1037/a0024585}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Instrumentalization or [[objectification]]
This aspect refers to treating a person as an instrument or as means to achieve some other goal. This approach builds on [[Immanuel Kant]]'s moral imperative stipulating that we should treat people as ends or goals in themselves, namely as having ultimate moral worth which should not be instrumentalized.  
* Degradation
Violations of human dignity as degradation refer to acts that degrade the value of human beings. These are acts that, even if done by consent, convey a message that diminishes the importance or value of all human beings. They consist of practices that human beings should not be subjected to, regardless of whether subjective humiliation is involved, such as selling oneself to slavery, or when a state authority deliberately puts prisoners in inhuman living conditions. 
* [[Dehumanization]]
These are acts that strip a person or a group of their human characteristics. It may involve describing or treating them as animals or as a lower type of human beings. This has occurred in genocides such as the Holocaust and in Rwanda where the minority were compared to insects.

=== Examples ===
Some of the practices that violate human dignity include [[torture]], [[rape]], [[social exclusion]], [[labor exploitation]], [[bonded labor]], and [[slavery]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  &lt;!-- If you add something to this list, please also add a source for it. --&gt;

Both absolute and relative poverty are violations of human dignity, although they also have other significant dimensions, such as social injustice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  [[Absolute poverty]] is associated with overt exploitation and connected to humiliation (for example, being forced to eat food from other people's garbage), but being dependent upon others to stay alive is a violation of dignity even in the absence of more direct violations. [[Relative poverty]], on the other hand, is a violation because the cumulative experience of not being able to afford the same clothes, entertainment, social events, education, or other features of typical life in that society results in subtle humiliation; social rejection; marginalization; and consequently, a diminished self-respect.

Another example of violation of human dignity, especially for women in developing countries, is lack of [[sanitation]]. Having no access to [[toilet]]s leaves currently about 1 billion people of the world with no choice other than to [[open defecation|defecation in the open]], which has been declared by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations as an affront to personal dignity.&lt;ref&gt;JMP (2014). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2036 Progress on drinking water and sanitation, 2014 Update]. WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP), {{ISBN|978 92 4 150724 0}}, page 11&lt;/ref&gt; Human dignity is also violated by the practice of employing people in India for "[[manual scavenging]]" of [[human excreta]] from unsanitary toilets{{snd}}usually by people of a lower [[caste]], and more often by women than men.&lt;ref name="HRW2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/india0814_ForUpload_0.pdf|title=Cleaning Human Waste: "manual scavenging", Caste and Discrimination in India|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=23 June 2015|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further example of violation of human dignity, affecting women mainly in developing countries, is [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM).

The movie ''[[The Magic Christian (film)|The Magic Christian]]'' depicts a wealthy man ([[Peter Sellers]]) and his son ([[Ringo Starr]]) who test the limits of dignity by forcing people to perform self-degrading acts for money.  The ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Homer vs. Dignity]]" has a similar plot.

==Philosophical history==
[[File:Ripa dignity allegory.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Statue Depicting Dignity|Woodcut from [[Cesare Ripa|Cesare Ripa's]] Iconologia depicting the Allegory of Dignity]]

===Pico della Mirandola===
A philosopher of the Renaissance, [[Mirandola, Giovanni Francesco Pico della|Pico della Mirandola]], granted dignity to ideas and to beings. In his "[[Oration on the Dignity of Man]]", he told hostile clerics about the dignity of the liberal arts and about the dignity and the glory of [[angel]]s. His comments implied the dignity of philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/Mirandola/|title=Redirection|work=umich.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; This oration is commonly seen as one of the central texts of the [[Renaissance]], intimately tied with the growth of humanist philosophies.&lt;ref name="CrossLamm1984"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cross|first1=Neal Miller|author2=Robert Carson Lamm|author3=Rudy H.

===Kant===
A philosopher of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] (18th century), [[Immanuel Kant]] held that there were things that should not be discussed in terms of value, and that these things could be said to have dignity.  '[[Value (ethics)|Value]]' is necessarily relative, because the value of something depends on a particular observer's judgment of that thing. Things that are ''not'' relative{{snd}}that are ''"ends in themselves"'', in Kant's terminology{{snd}}are by extension beyond all value, and a thing is an ''end in itself'' only if it has a moral dimension; if it represents a choice between right and wrong. In Kant's words: "[[Morality]], and [[human nature|humanity]] as capable of it, is that which alone has dignity."&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals'', trans. by Thomas Kingsmill Abbott (Second Section: Transition From Popular Moral Philosophy To The Metaphysic Of Morals).&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically with respect to human dignity, which his writings brought from relative obscurity in Western philosophy into a focal point for philosophers, Kant held that "free will" is essential; human dignity is related to human agency, the ability of humans to choose their own actions.&lt;ref name="O'Hara1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Hara|first=Phillip Anthony|title=Encyclopedia of political economy|chapter=Human dignity|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-18717-6|page=471}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 June 2010--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mortimer Adler and Alan Gewirth===
Philosophers of the late 20th century who have written significant works on the subject of dignity include [[Mortimer Adler]] and [[Alan Gewirth]].&lt;ref name="O'Hara1999"/&gt; Gewirth's views on human dignity are typically compared and contrasted with Kant's, for like Kant he theorizes that human dignity arises from agency.&lt;ref name="Peil2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Mark D.|chapter=Dignity|editor=Jan Peil|title=Handbook of Economics and Ethics|date=1 May 2009|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84542-936-2|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BeyleveldBrownsword2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beyleveld|first1=Deryck|author2=Roger Brownsword|title=Human dignity in bioethics and biolaw|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-826826-0|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; But while sharing Kant's view that rights arise from dignity, Gewirth focused far more than Kant on the positive obligations that dignity imposed on humans, the moral requirement not only to avoid harming but to actively assist one another in achieving and maintaining a state of "well being".&lt;ref name="Peil2009"/&gt;

Among other topics, including the dignity of labor,&lt;ref name="AdlerWeismann2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adler|first1=Mortimer Jerome|author2=Max Weismann|title=How to think about the great ideas: from the great books of western civilization|date=1 March 2000|publisher=Open Court Publishing|isbn=978-0-8126-9412-3|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adler extensively explored the question of human equality and equal right to dignity.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|last=Adler |first=Mortimer |url=http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/adler-mortimer_dignity-of-man.html |title=The Dignity of Man and the 21st century |date=1952-10-10 |accessdate=2010-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620172623/http://cooperativeindividualism.org/adler-mortimer_dignity-of-man.html |archivedate=2010-06-20 |df= }}; {{cite book|author=Mortimer Jerome Adler|title=The Difference of Man and the Difference It Makes|year=1993|publisher=Fordham Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8232-1535-5}}, {{cite book|author=Mortimer Jerome Adler|title=Six Great Ideas|date=1 December 1997|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-82681-3}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 June 2010--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to Adler, the question of whether humans have equal right to dignity is intrinsically bound in the question of whether human beings are truly equal, which itself is bound in the question of whether human beings are a distinct class from all things, including animals, or vary from other things only by degree. Adler wrote that the only sense in which it is true that all human beings are equal is that they are equally distinct from animals.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (1997), 165-166.&lt;/ref&gt; "The dignity of man," he said, "is the dignity of the human being as a person—a dignity that is not possessed by things."&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (1993), 17.&lt;/ref&gt; To Adler, failure to recognize the distinction challenged the right of humans to equal dignity and equal treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (1993), 271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (1997), 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
Dan Egonsson, followed by Roger Wertheimer, argued that while it is conventional for people to equate dignity with 'being human' (Egonsson's 'Standard Attitude', Wertheimer's 'Standard Belief'), people generally also import something other than mere humanness to their idea of dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Egonsson, ''Dimensions of Dignity: The Moral Importance of Being Human'' (Dordrecht, Sweden: Kluwer Academic, 1998) 132,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Wertheimer, "Philosophy on Humanity," in ''Abortion: Pro and Con'', R. L. Perkins ed. (Cambridge, Mass.: Schenkman, 1974) 107-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Egonsson suggested that an entity must be both human and ''alive'' to merit an ascription of dignity, while Wertheimer states "it is not a definitional truth that human beings have human status."

According to [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], dignity is opinion of others about our worth and subjective definition of dignity is our fear from this opinion of others.&lt;ref&gt;A. Schopenhauer. Essays and Aphorisms&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Philippe-André Rodriguez has argued that human dignity is best understood as an essentially contested concept. As he argues, "it seems that it is this very nature of the concept that has allowed, on the one hand, human rights to receive such international acceptance as a theoretical enterprise and, on the other hand, has led the concept to be constantly challenged by different cultures worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Philippe-André|title=Human dignity as an essentially contested concept|journal=Cambridge Review of International Affairs|date=2015|volume=28|issue=2|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Human dignity is a central consideration of [[Christian philosophy]]&lt;ref name="O'Hara1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Gal|3:28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Matthew|25:35-40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] insists the "dignity of the human person is rooted in his or her creation in the image and [[Image of God|likeness]] of [[God]]." "All human beings," says the Church, "in as much as they are created in the image of God, have the dignity of a person." The catechism says, "The right to the exercise of freedom belongs to everyone because it is inseparable from his or her dignity as a human person."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/index.htm|title=Vatican|website=www.vatican.va|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church's view of human dignity is like Kant's insofar as it springs from human agency and free will,&lt;ref name="Peil2009"/&gt; with the further understanding that free will in turn springs from human creation in the image of God.&lt;ref name="ccc1705"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3sect1.shtml|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|work=usccb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human dignity, or ''kevod ha-beriyot'', is also a central consideration of [[Judaism]].&lt;ref name="WaxmanGinor1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waxman|first1=Mordecai|authorlink1=Mordecai Waxman|author2=Tseviyah Ben-Yosef Ginor|author3=Zvia Ginor|title=Yakar le'Mordecai|date=November 1998|publisher=KTAV Publishing House, Inc.|isbn=978-0-88125-632-1|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Talmud]]'' cautions against giving charity publicly rather than in private to avoid offending the dignity of the recipient.&lt;ref name="Sicker2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Sicker|title=The political culture of Judaism|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-97257-8|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]] in his codification of ''[[Halakha]]'' cautioned judges to preserve the self-respect of people who came before them: "Let not human dignity be light in his eyes; for the respect due to man supersedes a negative rabbinical command".&lt;ref name="Sicker2001"/&gt;

An [[Islam]]ic view of dignity is crystallized in the Quran through the selected biographies of Noah, Abraham, Joseph, David, Moses, Mary, Jesus and others (differing from the narratives in the Bible, which the Quran claims were corrupted). Individuals such as these are presented as role-models of dignity because they did not abandon their self-respect by bowing to social pressures. When faced with the fear of disapproval, poverty, hunger, death etc. these individuals held firm in their sense of right and wrong, which was in-line with Divine ordinances. ''"The right course is that on which one keeps his attitudes, ambitions and requirements subjected to the Divine Laws; and in this way leads a balanced and graceful life. Such a person has grasped the most trustworthy support which will never fail him"'' (Quran 31:22)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tolueislam.org/Parwez/expo/expo_031.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405162608/http://www.tolueislam.org/Parwez/expo/expo_031.htm |archivedate=2013-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such individuals are given the title of Muhsineen, who faced immense pressures but held firm in their positive actions. God awarded these individuals with authority and status in the land, and this reward is open to anyone who proves themselves worthy: ''"We bestow such honour and position on all those who lead their lives according to Our Laws."'' (Quran 37:80)&lt;ref name="tolueislam.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tolueislam.org/Parwez/expo/expo_037.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405163507/http://www.tolueislam.org/Parwez/expo/expo_037.htm |archivedate=2013-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who fall into this category are also afforded Divine protection from their mistakes: ''"Therefore We have saved you and your son from this.  We have done so because We keep those who lead their lives according to Divine guidance safe from such mishaps."'' (37:104-105)&lt;ref name="tolueislam.org"/&gt; The Quranic State that Muhammad began in Medinah sought to protect human dignity, since in a Quranic Welfare State individuals are free to work and live without the pressures faced by the threat of poverty, and thus can obey God's Laws as free individuals, contributing as part of a unified brotherhood working towards achieving humanity's full potential. Elaborations on dignity have been made by many scholars of Islam, such as [[Mohammad-Ali Taskhiri]], head of the Islamic Culture and Communications Organization in [[Iran]], in 1994. According to Taskhiri, dignity is a state to which all humans have equal ''potential'', but which can only be actualized by living a life pleasing to the eyes of God.&lt;ref name="HafezKenny2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hafez|first1=Kai|author2=Mary Ann Kenny|title=The Islamic world and the West: an introduction to political cultures and international relations|year=2000|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-11651-1|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in keeping with the 1990 [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]], which states that "True faith is the guarantee for enhancing such [basic human] dignity along the path to human perfection".&lt;ref name="MAYER2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mayer|first=Ann Elizabeth|title=Islam and Human Rights: Tradition and Politics|date=30 August 2006|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-4335-8|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human dignity is considered as Buddhahood in Mahayana Buddhism in which it is rooted in the idea that we are able to choose the path of self-perfection as a human being.&lt;ref name="Buddhism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgi.org/buddhism/buddhist-concepts/buddhism-and-human-dignity.html|title=Buddhism and Human Dignity|work=sgi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine==
In the 20th century, dignity became an issue for physicians and medical researchers. It has been invoked in questions of the [[bioethics]] of [[human genetic engineering]], [[human cloning]], and [[end-of-life care]] (particularly in such situations as the [[Terri Schiavo case]], a controversial situation in which life support was withdrawn from a woman diagnosed in a [[persistent vegetative state]]).&lt;ref name="Bernan2008"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The Irreducably Religious Character of Human Dignity|last = Gelernter | first= David | editor = Bernan|title=Human Dignity and Bioethics: Essays Commissioned by the President's Council on Bioethics|date=April 2008|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=978-0-16-080071-9|pages=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International bodies===
In June 1964, the [[World Medical Association]] issued the ''[[Declaration of Helsinki]]''. The Declaration says at article 11, "It is the duty of physicians who participate in medical research to protect the life, health, dignity, [[integrity]], right to [[autonomy|self-determination]], [[privacy]], and confidentiality of personal information of research subjects."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wma.net/e/policy/b3.htm Declaration of Helsinki by World Medical Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220183350/http://www.wma.net/e/policy/b3.htm |date=2009-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council of Europe]] invoked dignity in its effort to govern the progress of biology and medicine. On 4 April 1997, the Council, at Oviedo, approved the ''[[Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine]]''. The convention's preamble contains these statements, among others:
{{quote|Conscious of the accelerating developments in biology and medicine;

Convinced of the need to respect the human being both as an individual and as a member of the human species and recognising the importance of ensuring the dignity of the human being;

Conscious that the misuse of biology and medicine may lead to acts endangering human dignity;

Resolving to take such measures as are necessary to safeguard human dignity and the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual with regard to the application of biology and medicine.}}
The Convention states, "Parties to this Convention shall protect the dignity and identity of all human beings and guarantee everyone, without discrimination, respect for their integrity and other rights and fundamental freedoms with regard to the application of biology and medicine."

In 1998, the United Nations mentioned dignity in the ''UNESCO Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights''. At Article 2, the declaration states, "Everyone has a right to respect for their dignity." At Article 24, the declaration warns that treating a person to remove a genetic defect "could be contrary to human dignity." The ''Commentary'' that accompanies the declaration says that, as a consequence of the possibility of germ-line treatment, "it is the very dignity of the human race which is at stake."

===Canada===
In 1996, the Government of Canada issued a report entitled ''New Reproductive and Genetic Technologies''. The report used "the principles of respect for human life and dignity" as its reason for recommending that various activities associated with genetic research and human reproduction be prohibited. The report said the prohibited activities were "contrary to Canadian values of equality and respect for human life and dignity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=2329538&amp;Language=e&amp;Mode=1&amp;File=28|title=House Government Bill - C-47, Second Reading (35-2)|work=parl.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
The Ministry of Health enacted the ''Danish Council Act 1988'', which established the Danish Council of Ethics. The Council advises the Ministry on matters of medicine and genetic research on humans. In 2001, the Council condemned "reproductive cloning because it would violate human dignity, because it could have adverse consequences for the cloned person and because permitting research on reproductive cloning would reflect a disregard for the respect due to the moral status of embryos."&lt;ref&gt;Gratton, Brigitte. [http://www.etiskraad.dk/sw293.asp ''Survey on the National Regulations in the European Union regarding Research on Human Embryos'' (July 2002), 16.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In 1984, France set up the National Consultative Committee for Ethics in the Life and Health Sciences (CCNE) to advise the government about the regulation of medical practices and research. In 1986, the CCNE said, "Respect for human dignity must guide both the development of knowledge and the limits or
rules to be observed by research." The CCNE said that research on human embryos must be subject to "the rule of reason" and must have regard for "undefined dignity in its practical consequences."&lt;ref name=avis008&gt;[http://www.ccne-ethique.fr/docs/en/avis008.pdf CCNE Opinion no. 8.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113231959/http://ccne-ethique.fr/docs/en/avis008.pdf |date=2008-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCNE insisted that, in research on human embryos, the ethical principles that should apply are "respecting human dignity" and respecting "the dignity of science."&lt;ref name=avis008/&gt;

===Portugal===
The National Council of Ethics of Portugal published its ''Opinion on the Ethical Implications of Cloning'' in 1997. The opinion states, "the cloning of human beings, because of the problems it raises concerning the dignity of the human person, the equilibrium of the human species and life in society, is ethically unacceptable and must be prohibited."&lt;ref&gt;Gratton, Brigitte. [http://www.etiskraad.dk/sw293.asp ''Survey on the National Regulations in the European Union regarding Research on Human Embryos'' (July 2002), 53.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
Sweden's ''The Genetic Integrity Act'' (2006:351), ''The Biobanks in Medical Care Act'' (2002:297), ''Health and Medical Services (Professional Activities) Act'' (1998:531), and ''The Health and Medical Services Act'' (1982:763) all express concern for "the integrity of the individual" or "human dignity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smer.se/Bazment/266.aspx Swedish statutes.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818061730/http://www.smer.se/Bazment/266.aspx |date=2010-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In 2008, [[The President's Council on Bioethics]] tried to arrive at a consensus about what dignity meant but failed. Edmund D. Pellegrino, M.D., the Council's Chairman, says in the Letter of Transmittal to the President of The United States, "… there is no universal agreement on the meaning of the term, human dignity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioethics.gov|title=Home Page - Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues|work=bioethics.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916023939/http://www.bioethics.gov/|archivedate=2008-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==
McDougal, Lasswell, and Chen studied dignity as a basis for international law.&lt;ref&gt;Myres S. McDougal, Harold D. Lasswell, and Lung-chu Chen, ''Human Rights and World Public Order: The Basic Policies of an International Law of Human Dignity'' (New Haven: Yale UP, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; They said that using dignity as the basis for laws was a "[[natural law]] approach."&lt;ref&gt;McDougal et al, note, at 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The natural law approach, they said, depends upon "exercises of faith."&lt;ref&gt;McDougal et al, note, at 69.&lt;/ref&gt; McDougal, Lasswell, and Chen observed:&lt;ref&gt;McDougal et al, note, at 71.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The abiding difficulty with the natural law approach is that its assumptions, intellectual procedures, and modalities of justification can be employed equally by the proponents of human dignity and the proponents of human indignity in support of diametrically opposed empirical specifications of rights . . . .}}

===Canada===
In 2004, Canada enacted the ''[[Assisted Human Reproduction Act]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowFullDoc/cs/A-13.4///en|title=Page not Found - Page non trouvé|date=5 June 2011|website=archive.org|accessdate=22 October 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605063723/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowFullDoc/cs/A-13.4///en|archivedate=5 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 2(b) of the Act states, "the benefits of assisted human reproductive technologies and related research for individuals, for families and for society in general can be most effectively secured by taking appropriate measures for the protection and promotion of human health, safety, dignity and rights in the use of these technologies and in related research." The Act prescribes a fine not exceeding $500,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or both, if someone undertakes a proscribed activity such as the creation of a [[Chimera (genetics)|chimera]].

=== European Union ===

Article 1 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] affirms the inviolability of human dignity.

===France===
In 1997, the National Consultative Committee for Ethics in the Life and Health Sciences, as well as other observers, noted that France's dignity-based laws on bio-medical research were paradoxical. The law prohibited the willful destruction of human embryos but directed that human embryos could be destroyed if they were more than five years old.&lt;ref name=avis053&gt;[http://www.ccne-ethique.fr/docs/en/avis053.pdf CCNE Opinion no. 053.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113231600/http://ccne-ethique.fr/docs/en/avis053.pdf |date=2008-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law prohibited research on human embryos created in France but permitted research on human embryos brought to France.&lt;ref name=avis053/&gt; The law prohibited researchers from creating embryos for research but allowed researchers to experiment with embryos that were superfluous after ''in vitro'' fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;Cazeau, Bernard. {{fr icon}} [http://www.senat.fr/senfic/cazeau_bernard98029w.html Senat.fr] Retrieved 2009-04-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Human dignity is the fundamental principle of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]]. Article 1, paragraph 1 reads: ''"Human dignity is inviolable. To respect and protect it is the duty of all state authority." ''Human dignity is thus mentioned even before the [[right to life]]. This has a significant impact on German law-making and jurisdiction in both serious and trivial items:

*Human dignity is the basis of § 131 [[StGB]], which prohibits the depiction of cruelty against humans in an approving way. § 131 has been used to confiscate [[horror movies]] and to ban [[video game]]s like ''[[Manhunt (video game)|Manhunt]]'' and the ''[[Mortal Kombat (series)|Mortal Kombat]]'' series.
*A decision&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/dfr/bv045187.html|title=DFR - BVerfGE 45, 187 - Lebenslange Freiheitsstrafe|work=unibe.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Bundesverfassungsgericht|German Federal Constitutional Court]] in 1977 said [[life imprisonment]] without the possibility of [[Parole#Criminal justice|parole]] is unconstitutional as a violation of human dignity (and the ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'' principle). Today, a prisoner serving a life term can be granted parole on good behavior as early as 15 years after being incarcerated, provided that his release is held to constitute little danger to the public. Note that persons deemed still dangerous can be incarcerated indefinitely on a life term, if this judgment is regularly reaffirmed.
*§ 14(3) of the [[Luftsicherheitsgesetz]], which would have allowed the [[Bundeswehr]] to shoot down airliners if they are used as weapons by terrorists, was declared unconstitutional mainly on the grounds of human dignity: killing a small number of innocent people to save a large number cannot be legalized since it treats dignity as if it were a measurable and limited quantity.
*A [[Benetton Group|Benetton]] advertisement showing human buttocks with an "[[H.I.V.]] positive" stamp was declared a violation of human dignity by some courts, but in the end found legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bverfg.de/entscheidungen/rs20030311_1bvr042602.html|title=Bundesverfassungsgericht|work=bverfg.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stern.de/presse/stern/:25.03.2003-Benetton-Werbung:/505780.html Stern.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202172716/http://www.stern.de/presse/stern/%3A25.03.2003-Benetton-Werbung%3A/505780.html |date=2009-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The first German law legalizing [[abortion]] in 1975 was declared unconstitutional because the court held that [[embryo]]s had human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gkpn.de/singer2.htm German law about abortion.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202111015/http://www.gkpn.de/singer2.htm |date=2009-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new law on abortion was developed in the 1990s. This law makes all abortions ''de jure'' illegal, except if preceded by counseling (§ 219 I GERMAN CRIMINAL CODE).
*In a decision from 1981-12-15, the ''Bundesverwaltungsgericht'' declared that [[peep show]]s violated the human dignity of the performer, regardless of her feelings. The decision was later revised. Peep shows where the performer cannot see the persons who are watching her remain prohibited as a matter of dignity.

===Iran===
The need to respect human dignity has been written in the Iranian constitution law. Article 2 of the Iranian Constitution Law mentions six principles and infrastructures as basic to the governing system which in Article 1 is called the Islamic Republic of Iran. The sixth principle of this Article concerns human dignity and stipulates that “the Islamic Republic of Iran is a system founded on faith in ….6) Human dignity and high value and his/her freedom as well as his responsibility before God”[3]. Besides, in the prelude to the Constitution, human dignity is referred to concerning the mass media.&lt;ref&gt;Salehi, Hamid Reza. Human Dignity From the Viewpoint of Iranian Law, Journal of Bioethical Inquiry, Volume 10, Issue 2, June 2013, 135-136. DOI:10.1007/s11673-013-9437-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
The [[Constitution of South Africa]] lists ''"human dignity, the achievement of equality and the advancement of human rights and freedoms"'' as one of the founding values of the South African state, and the [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]] is described as affirming the ''"democratic values of human dignity, equality and freedom"''. Section 10 of the Constitution explicitly states that ''"Everyone has inherent dignity and the right to have their dignity respected and protected."'' In jurisprudence, the right to dignity is often seen as underlying more specific rights, such as equality, security of the person or privacy, but it has been directly applied in a number of cases relating to [[criminal punishment]], the law of [[defamation]], and the right to marriage and family life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Iain |last1=Currie |first2=Johan |last2=de Waal |title=The Bill of Rights Handbook |edition=5th |year=2005 |location=Cape Town |publisher=Juta |isbn=978-0-7021-5923-7 |chapter=Chapter Ten: Human dignity |pages=272–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
The [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] provides in article 7 that "Human dignity must be respected and protected."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/rs/101/a7.html Official translation] of art. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; It also provides, in art. 120, that the state must "take account of the dignity of living beings as well as the safety of human beings, animals and the environment" when legislating on the use of reproductive and genetic material;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/rs/101/a120.html Official translation] of art. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; consequently the Federal Ethics Commission on Non-Human Biotechnology (ECNH) issued, in 2008, a publication entitled "The dignity of living beings with regard to plants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekah.admin.ch/fileadmin/ekah-dateien/dokumentation/publikationen/e-Broschure-Wurde-Pflanze-2008.pdf|title=English language publication|website=admin.ch|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''emerging church''' is a [[Christian]] movement of the late 20th and early 21st centuries that crosses a number of theological boundaries: participants are variously described as [[Protestantism|Protestant]], post-Protestant, [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]],&lt;ref name="christiantoday.com"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.christiantoday.com/article/catholics.join.emerging.church.conversation/22770.htm |title=Catholics join Emerging Church conversation |work=christiantoday.com |author=Lillian Kwon, |date=March 14, 2009 |accessdate=August 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[post-evangelical]], [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]], [[post-liberal theology|post-liberal]],  [[conservative]], post-conservative, [[anabaptist]],  [[reformed]], [[Charismatic (Christians)|charismatic]], [[neocharismatic]], and post-charismatic.

Proponents believe the movement transcends the "modernist" labels of "conservative" and "liberal," calling the movement a "conversation" to emphasize its developing and decentralized nature, its vast range of standpoints, and its commitment to dialogue. Participants seek to live their faith in what they believe to be a "[[postmodern]]" society.  What those involved in the conversation mostly agree on is their disillusionment with the organized and institutional church and their support for the [[deconstruction]] of modern Christian [[worship]], modern [[evangelism]], and the nature of modern Christian community.

==Definitions==

===Terminology===
Emerging churches are fluid, hard to define, and varied; they contrast themselves with what has gone before in referring to the latter as the "inherited church."&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Murray, Church After Christendom, (London: Paternoster Press, 2004), 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Mobsby, Emerging &amp; Fresh Expressions of Church: How are they authentically Church and Anglican, (London: Moot Community Publishing, 2007), 20&lt;/ref&gt; Key themes of the emerging church are couched in the language of reform, [[Christian theological praxis|praxis]]-oriented lifestyles, [[post-evangelical]] thought, and incorporation or acknowledgment of [[Christianity and politics|political]] and [[Postmodern Christianity|postmodern]] elements.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski, D. (2007). [http://www.apologeticsindex.org/612-emergent-epistemology "Surrender is not an Option: An Evaluation of Emergent Epistemology."] Apologetics Index. Retrieved on: August 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
Terminological confusion has occurred because of the use of words with similar etymology. When used as descriptors, "emerging" and "emergent" can be interchangeable. However, when used as names, they are different. In this case "Emerging" refers to the whole informal, church-based, global movement, whilst "Emergent" to a formal, organisational subset associated with [[Tony Jones (theologian)|Tony Jones]], [[Brian McLaren]], [[Doug Pagitt]], and others: the "Emergent stream."&lt;ref name = Mcknight&gt;McKnight, S. (February 2007).

===Variety and debate===
[[Mark Driscoll (pastor)|Mark Driscoll]] and [[Ed Stetzer]] described three categories within the movement: ''Relevants'', ''Reconstructionists'', and ''Revisionists.''&lt;ref name="Driscoll PPE"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Driscoll|first=Mark|title=A Pastoral Perspective on the Emergent Church|journal=Criswell Theological Review|year=2006|volume=3/2 (Spring 2006) 87-93|url=http://bobfranquiz.typepad.com/bobfranquizcom/files/32_apastoralperspectiveontheemergentchurchdriscoll.PDF|accessdate=Oct 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|89}}

''Relevants'' are theological conservatives who are interested in updating to current culture.&lt;ref name="Driscoll PPE" /&gt;{{rp|89}} They look to people like [[Dan Kimball]] and [[Donald Miller (author)|Donald Miller]].&lt;ref name="Driscoll PPE" /&gt;{{rp|89–90}}

''Reconstructionists'' are generally theologically evangelical, and speak of new forms of church that result in transformed lives.&lt;ref name="Driscoll PPE" /&gt;{{rp|90}} They look to Neil Cole, [[Michael Frost (minister)|Michael Frost]] and [[Alan Hirsch]].&lt;ref name="Driscoll PPE" /&gt;{{rp|90}}

''Revisionists'' are theologically liberal, and openly question whether evangelical doctrine is appropriate for the postmodern world.&lt;ref name="Driscoll PPE" /&gt;  They look to leaders such as [[Brian McLaren]], [[Rob Bell]] and [[Doug Pagitt]].&lt;ref name="Driscoll PPE" /&gt;{{rp|90}}

Driscoll has subsequently identified a fourth stream, the [[house church]] movement, which he previously included under the Reconstructionist label.&lt;ref name="Driscoll PPE" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.christianpost.com/news/mars-hill-pastor-ditches-emerging-label-for-jesus-31344/|title = Mars Hill Pastor Ditches 'Emerging' Label for Jesus|date = February 27, 2008|accessdate = May 13, 2014|website = [[The Christian Post]]|publisher = The Christian Post Company|last = Kwon|first = Lillian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Driscoll and [[Scot McKnight]] have now voiced concerns over [[Brian McLaren]] and the "emergent thread."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/article_print.html?id=86862 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605055032/http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/article_print.html?id=86862 |archivedate=2011-06-05 |title=Review: Brian McLaren's ''A New Kind of Christianity'' |last1=McKnight |first1=Scot |date=2010-02-26 |work=Christianity Today |accessdate=2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some evangelical leaders such as [[Shane Claiborne]] have also sought to distance themselves from the emerging church movement, its labels and the "emergent brand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Falsani |first=Cathleen |url=http://blog.sojo.net/2010/04/13/the-emerging-church-brand-the-good-the-bad-and-the-messy/ |title=The Emerging Church Brand: The Good, the Bad, and the Messy&amp;nbsp;– Shane Claiborne &amp;#124; God's Politics Blog &amp;#124; Sojourners |publisher=Blog.sojo.net |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021064907/http://blog.sojo.net/2010/04/13/the-emerging-church-brand-the-good-the-bad-and-the-messy/ |archivedate=2011-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to Mobsby{{cn|date=March 2016}} the term "emerging church" was first used in 1970, when Larson and Osborne predicted a movement characterised by: contextual and experimental mission; new forms of church; the removal of barriers and division; a blend of evangelism and social action; attention to both experience and tradition; the breakdown of clergy/laity distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;B Larson, R Osbourne, The emerging church, (London: Word Books, 1970), 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Compare: https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=emerging+church%2C+emergent+church&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cemerging%20church%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cemergent%20church%3B%2Cc0 &lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic political theologian, [[Johann Baptist Metz]], used the term ''emergent church'' in 1981 in a different{{which?|date=March 2016}} context.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Baptist Metz, ''The Emergent Church'' (New York, NY: Crossroad, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcus Borg]] says: "The emerging paradigm has been visible for well over a hundred years. In the last twenty to thirty years, it has become a major grassroots movement among both laity and clergy in 'mainline' or 'old mainline' Protestant denominations."  He describes it as: "a way of seeing the Bible (and the Christian tradition as a whole) as ''historical'', ''metaphorical'', and ''sacramental'', [and] a way of seeing the Christian life as ''relational'' and ''transformational''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Heart of Christianity |last= Borg |first= Marcus J. |authorlink= |year= 2003 |publisher= HarperSanFrancisco |location= |isbn= 0-06-073068-4 |pages= 6, 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the emerging church that preceded the US Emergent organization began with [[Mike Riddell]] and [[Mark Pierson]] in New Zealand from 1989, and with a number of practitioners in the UK including Jonny Baker, [[Ian Mobsby]], Kevin, Ana and Brian Draper, and Sue Wallace amongst others, from around 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.alternativeworship.org/definitions_awec.html |title= Alternative worship &amp; emerging church&amp;nbsp;– The same or different? |publisher= Alternativeworship.org |date= |accessdate= 2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of the [[Nine O'Clock Service]] has been ignored{{by whom?|date=March 2016}} also, owing to its notoriety, yet much that was practised there was influential on early proponents of [[alternative worship]].&lt;ref&gt;Tony Jones ''The New Christians: Dispatches from the Emergent Frontier'' (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2008) 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Common to the identity of many of these emerging-church projects that began in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, is their development with very little central planning on behalf of the established denominations.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Mobsby, Emerging &amp; Fresh Expressions of Church, (London: Moot Community Publishing, 2007), 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt; They occurred as the initiative of particular groups wanting to start new contextual church experiments, and are therefore very "bottom up." Murray says that these churches began in a spontaneous way, with informal relationships formed between otherwise independent groups&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Murray, Church After Christendom, (as above), 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt; and that many became churches as a development from their initial more modest beginnings.&lt;ref&gt;Stuary Murray, Church After Christendom, (as above), 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Mobsby, Emerging &amp; Fresh Expressions of Church, (London: Moot Community Publishing, 2007), 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Values and characteristics==

===Trinitarian based values===
Gibbs and Bolger&lt;ref&gt;E Gibbs, R Bolger, Emerging Churches: Creating Christian Communities in Postmodern Cultures, (London: SPCK, 2006), 44-5.&lt;/ref&gt; interviewed a number of people involved in leading emerging churches and from this research have identified some core values in the emerging church, including desires to imitate the life of Jesus; transform secular society; emphasise communal living; welcome outsiders; be generous and creative; and lead without control. [[Ian Mobsby]] suggests Trinitarian Ecclesiology is the basis of these shared international values.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Mobsby, The Becoming of G-d, (Oxford: YTC Press, 2008),65-82.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Mobsby, Emerging &amp; Fresh Expressions of Church, (London:Moot Community Publishing, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobsby also suggests that the Emerging Church is centred on a combination of models of Church and of Contextual Theology that draw on this Trinitarian base: the Mystical Communion and Sacramental models of Church,&lt;ref&gt;Ian Mobsby, Emerging &amp; Fresh Expressions of Church, (London: Moot Community Publishing, 2007),54-60&lt;/ref&gt; and the Synthetic and Transcendent models of Contextual Theology.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Mobsby, Emerging &amp; Fresh Expressions of Church, (London: Moot Community Publishing), 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Mobsby, The Becoming of G-d, (Cambridge: YTC Press, 2008), 98-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mobsby, the Emerging Church has reacted to the missional needs of postmodern culture and re-acquired a Trinitarian basis to its understanding of Church as Worship, Mission and Community. He argues this movement is over and against some forms of conservative evangelicalism and other reformed ecclesiologies since the enlightenment that have neglected the Trinity, which has caused problems with certainty, judgementalism and fundamentalism and the increasing gap between the Church and contemporary culture.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Mobsby, The Becoming of G-d, (Oxford: YTC Press, 2008), 15-18, 32-35, 37-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Christendom mission and evangelism===
Members of the movement often place a high value on good works or social activism, including [[missional living]].&lt;ref&gt;McLaren, Brian, Finding our Way Again (Nashville, Tenn: Thomas Nelson, 2008). {{ISBN|978-0-8499-0114-0}}. dedication.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stuart Murray, [[Christendom]] is the creation and maintenance of a Christian nation by ensuring a close relationship of power between the Christian Church and its host culture.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Murray ''Post Christendom: Church and Mission in a Strangle Land'' (Carlisle: Paternoster Press, 2004) 83-88.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, churches may still attempt to use this power in mission and evangelism.&lt;ref name="Murray2004"&gt;Stuart Murray ''Post Christendom: Church and Mission in a Strangle Land'' (Carlisle: Paternoster Press, 2004) 83-88, 200-202.&lt;/ref&gt;  The emerging church considers this to be unhelpful. Murray summarizes Christendom values as: a commitment to hierarchy and the status quo; the loss of lay involvement; institutional values rather than community focus; church at the centre of society rather than the margins; the use of political power to bring in the Kingdom; religious compulsion; punitive rather than restorative justice; marginalisation of women, the poor, and dissident movements; inattentiveness to the criticisms of those outraged by the historic association of Christianity with patriarchy, warfare, injustice and patronage; partiality for respectability and top-down mission; attractional evangelism; assuming the Christian story is known; and a preoccupation with the rich and powerful.&lt;ref name="Murray2004" /&gt;

The emerging church seeks a post-Christendom approach to being church and mission through: renouncing imperialistic approaches to language and cultural imposition; making 'truth claims' with humility and respect; overcoming the public/private dichotomy; moving church from the center to the margins; moving from a place of privilege in society to one voice amongst many; a transition from control to witness, maintenance to mission and institution to movement. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In the face of criticism, some in the emerging church respond that it is important to attempt a "both and" approach to redemptive and incarnational theologies. Some [[Evangelicals]] and [[Fundamentalists]] are perceived as "overly redemptive" and therefore in danger of condemning people by communicating the Good News in aggressive and angry ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emergingchurch.info/reflection/ianmobsby/theology.htm |title=&gt; reflection &gt; ianmobsby |publisher=emergingchurch.info |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more loving and affirming approach is proposed in the context of post-modernity where distrust may occur in response to power claims.  It is suggested that this can form the basis of a [[constructive engagement]] with 21st-century post-industrial western cultures. According to [[Ian Mobsby]], the suggestion that the emerging church is mainly focused on deconstruction and the rejection of current forms of church should itself be rejected.&lt;ref&gt;I Mobsby, Emerging &amp; Fresh Expressions of Church, (London: Moot Community Publishing, 2007)  .&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postmodern worldview and hermeneutics===
The emerging church is a response to the perceived influence of [[modernism]] in Western Christianity. As some sociologists commented on a cultural shift that they believed to correspond to [[postmodern]] ways of perceiving reality in the late 20th century, some Christians began to advocate changes within the church in response. These Christians saw the contemporary church as being culturally bound to [[modernism]]. They changed their practices to relate to the new cultural situation. Emerging Christians began to challenge the modern church on issues such as: institutional structures, [[systematic theology]], propositional teaching methods, a perceived preoccupation with buildings, an attractional understanding of mission, professional [[clergy]], and a perceived preoccupation with the political process and unhelpful jargon ("Christian-ese").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perry|first=Simon|title=Emerging Worship|url=http://www.simonperry.org.uk/#/emerging-worship/4537335309|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, some in the emerging church believe it is necessary to [[Deconstruction|deconstruct]] modern Christian dogma. One way this happens is by engaging in dialogue, rather than proclaiming a predigested message, believing that this leads people to Jesus through the Holy Spirit on their own terms. Many in the movement embrace the missiology that drives the movement in an effort to be like Christ and make disciples by being a good example. The emerging church movement contains a great diversity in beliefs and practices, although some have adopted a preoccupation with sacred rituals, good works, and political and social activism. Much of the Emerging Church movement has also adopted the approach to evangelism which stressed peer-to-peer dialogue rather than dogmatic proclamation and proselytizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perry|first=Simon|title=What is So Holy About Scripture|year=2003|publisher=Wipf and Stock|location=Eugene, Oregon|url=http://www.simonperry.org.uk/#/publications/4549831951|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A plurality of Scriptural interpretations is acknowledged in the emerging church movement. Participants in the movement exhibit a particular concern for the effect of the modern ''reader's'' cultural context on the act of interpretation echoing the ideas of postmodern thinkers such as [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Stanley Fish]]. Therefore a [[Narrative theology|narrative]] approach to Scripture, and history are emphasized in some emerging churches over exegetical and dogmatic approaches (such as that found in [[systematic theology]] and systematic exegesis), which are often viewed as [[reductionist]]. Others embrace a multiplicity of approaches.

===Generous orthodoxy===
Spearheaded by [[Brian McLaren]], some emerging church leaders see interfaith dialogue as a means to share their narratives as they learn from the narratives of others.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sudworth, ''Distinctly Welcoming'', Oxford: SUP, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Emerging Church Christians believe there are radically diverse perspectives within Christianity that are valuable for humanity to progress toward truth and a better resulting relationship with God, and that these different perspectives deserve Christian charity rather than condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.generousgiving.org/page.asp?sec=28&amp;page=300 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209061015/http://www.generousgiving.org/page.asp?sec=28&amp;page=300 |archivedate=2009-02-09 |title=E Gibbs, R Bolger, Emerging Church: Creating Christian Community in Postmodern Cultures, (USA: Baker) |publisher=GenerousGiving.org |date=2009-02-09 |accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reformed and evangelical opponents, like [[John MacArthur (Pastor)|John MacArthur]], do not believe that such generosity is appropriate, citing the movement's shift away from traditional [[evangelical]] beliefs such as eternal punishment and [[penal substitution]] towards a reintroduction of, for example, elements of ancient mysticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MacArthur|first=John|title=MacArthur: The Emergent Church is a Form of Paganism|url=http://www.crosswalk.com/11560481/|accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Centered set===
Movement leaders such as Rob Bell appropriate [[set theory]] as a means of understanding a basic change in the way the Christian church thinks about itself as a group. ''Set theory'' is a concept in mathematics that allows an understanding of what numbers belong to a group, or set.  A bounded set would describe a group with clear "in" and "out" definitions of membership.  The Christian church has largely organized itself as a bounded set, those who share the same beliefs and values are in the set and those who disagree are outside.&lt;ref name="Paul Hiebert 1994"&gt;[[Paul Hiebert (missiologist)|Paul Hiebert]], ''Anthropological Reflections on Missiological Issues'', Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Books (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

The centered set does not limit membership to pre-conceived boundaries. Instead a centered set is conditioned on a centered point.  Membership is contingent on those who are moving toward that point. Elements moving toward a particular point are part of the set, but elements moving away from that point are not. As a centered-set Christian membership would be dependent on moving toward the central point of Jesus.  Christians are then defined by their focus and movement toward Christ rather than a limited set of shared beliefs and values.&lt;ref name="Paul Hiebert 1994"/&gt;

John Wimber utilized the centered set understanding of membership in his Vineyard Churches. The centered set theory of Christian Churches came largely from missional anthropologist [[Paul Hiebert (missiologist)|Paul Hiebert]]. The centered set understanding of membership allows for a clear vision of the focal point, the ability to move toward that point without being tied down to smaller diversions, a sense of total egalitarianism with respect for differing opinions, and an authority moved from individual members to the existing center.&lt;ref&gt;[[Phyllis Tickle]], ''The Great Emergence: How Christianity Is Changing and Why'', Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Books (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authenticity and conversation===
The movement favors the sharing of experiences via testimonies, prayer, group recitation, sharing meals and other communal practices, which they believe are more personal and sincere than propositional presentations of the Gospel. Teachers in the emerging church tend to view the Bible and its stories through a lens which they believe finds significance and meaning for their community's social and personal stories rather than for the purpose of finding cross-cultural, propositional absolutes regarding salvation and conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YaXbkD1sgs&amp;eurl=http://missiodeiscandia.wordpress.com/category/emerging-church/|title=Intriguing Michael Frost video|last=Frost|first=Michael|date=2007-09-14|work=[[Michael Frost (minister)|Michael Frost]], Founding Director of Centre for Evangelism &amp; Global Mission at Morling Theological College in Sydney, speaks to authenticity as bringing a "living among them" type of Christianity rather than cross-cultural absolutes regarding salvation and conduct|accessdate=2008-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emerging church claims they are creating a safe environment for those with opinions ordinarily rejected within modern conservative evangelicalism and fundamentalism. Non-critical, interfaith dialog is preferred over dogmatically-driven evangelism in the movement.&lt;ref&gt;I Mobsby, ''The Becoming of G-d'', (Oxford: YTC Press, 2008),97-111.&lt;/ref&gt; Story and narrative replaces the dogmatic:

{{quotation|The relationship between words and images has changed in contemporary culture.  In a post-foundational world, it is the power of the image that takes us to the text.  The bible is no longer a principal source of morality, functioning as a rulebook.  The gradualism of postmodernity has transformed the text into a guide, a source of spirituality, in which the power of the story as a moral reference point has superseded the didactic.  Thus the meaning of the Good Samaritan is more important than the Ten Commandments&amp;nbsp;– even assuming that the latter could be remembered in any detail by anyone.  Into this milieu the image speaks with power.&lt;ref&gt;M Percy, ''The Salt of the Earth: Religious resilience in a Secular Age'', (London, Continuum, 2002), 165.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

Those in the movement do not engage in aggressive apologetics or confrontational evangelism in the traditional sense, preferring to encourage the freedom to discover truth through conversation and relationships with the Christian community.&lt;ref&gt;I Mobsby, ''The Becoming of G-d'', (Oxford: YTC Press, 2008), 113-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

The limits of interreligious conversation were tested in 2006 Emergent Village coordinator [[Tony Jones (theologian)|Tony Jones]] co-convened the first encounter of [[Emergent church]] and "Jewish emergent" leaders in a meeting co-hosted by Synagogue 3000, a Jewish nonprofit group.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Winston, D.

Emerging faith boundaries: bridge-building, inclusion, and the emerging church movement in America (Doctoral dissertation, University of Missouri--Columbia).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Missional living===
While some Evangelicals emphasize [[Christian soteriology|eternal salvation]], many in the emerging church emphasize the here and now.&lt;ref&gt;Webber, Robert, John Burke, Dan Kimball, Doug Pagitt, Karen M. Ward, and Mark Driscoll. Listening to the Beliefs of Emerging Churches: Five Perspectives. (Grand Rapids, Mich: Zondervan, 2007) p. 102. {{ISBN|978-0-310-27135-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in this movement assert that the incarnation of Christ informs their theology. They believe that as God entered the world in human form, adherents enter (individually and communally) into the context around them and aim to transform that culture through local involvement. This holistic involvement may take many forms, including social activism, hospitality and acts of kindness. This beneficent involvement in culture is part of what is called [[missional living]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensourcetheology.net/node/1116 |title=An Incarnational Missiology for the Emerging Church |last=Griffiths |first=Rev Dr. Steve |date=2007-01-30 |work=Rev Dr. Steve Griffiths speaks about the Emerging Church and how they view and approach missions |accessdate=2008-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704215055/http://www.opensourcetheology.net/node/1116 |archivedate=2008-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Missional living leads to a focus on temporal and social issues, in contrast with a perceived evangelical overemphasis on salvation. Drawing on research and models of [[Inculturation|contextual theology]], Mobsby asserts that the emerging church is using different models of contextual theology than conservative evangelicals, who tend to use a "translation" model of contextual theology&lt;ref&gt;SB Bevans, ''Models of Contextual Theology'', New York:Orbis, 2002),3-46.&lt;/ref&gt; (which has been criticized for being colonialist and condescending toward other cultures); the emerging church tends to use a "synthetic" or "transcendent" model of contextual theology.&lt;ref&gt;SB Bevans, ''Models of Contextual Theology'', New York:Orbis, 2002),81-96.&lt;/ref&gt;  The emerging church has charged many conservative evangelical churches with withdrawal from involvement in contextual mission and seeking the contextualization of the gospel.&lt;ref&gt;I Mobsby, ''Emerging &amp; Fresh Expressions of Church'', (London: Moot Community Publishing, 2007),28-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Christian communities must learn to deal with the problems and possibilities posed by life in the "outside" world.  But of more importance, any attempt on the part of the church to withdraw from the world would be in effect a denial of its mission.&lt;ref&gt;BA Harvey, ''Another City'', (Harrisburg: Trinity Press International, 1999), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

Many emerging churches have put a strong emphasis on contextualization and, therefore, contextual theology.  Contextual theology has been defined as "A way of doing theology in which one takes into account: the spirit and message of the gospel; the tradition of the Christian people; the culture in which one is theologising; and social change in that culture."&lt;ref&gt;SB Bevans, ''Contextual Theology'', (New York:Orbis, 2002),1.&lt;/ref&gt; Emerging churches, drawing on this synthetic (or transcendent) model of contextual theology, seek to have a high view towards the Bible, the Christian people, culture, humanity and justice.  It is this "both...and" approach that distinguishes contextual theology.&lt;ref&gt;I Mobsby, ''The Becoming of G-d'', (Oxford: YTC Press, 2008), 67-82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I Mobsby, ''Emerging &amp; Fresh Expressions of Church'', (London:Moot Community Publishing, 2007), 28-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emerging communities participate in social action, community involvement, global justice and sacrificial hospitality in an effort to know and share God's grace. At a conference entitled "The Emerging Church Forum" in 2006, John Franke said “The Church of Jesus Christ is not the goal of the Gospel, just the instrument of the extension of God’s mission.” “The Church has been slow to recognize that missions isn’t (sic) a program the Church administers, it is the very core of the Church’s reason for being.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weblog.wyclif.net/index.php/2006/10/28/notes-from-the-emerging-church-forum-john-franke/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112221411/http://weblog.wyclif.net/index.php/2006/10/28/notes-from-the-emerging-church-forum-john-franke/|archivedate=2007-11-12|title=Notes of John Franke at the Emerging Church Forum|year=2006|accessdate=2008-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This focus on missional living and practicing radical hospitality has led many emerging churches to deepen what they are doing by developing a rhythm of life, and a vision of missional loving engagement with the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Mobsby, The Becoming of G-d, (Oxford: YTCPress, 2008), 65-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|A mixture of emerging Churches, Fresh Expressions of Church and mission initiatives arising out of the charismatic traditions, have begun describing themselves as new monastic communities.  They again draw on a combination of the Mystical Communion Model and Sacramental Models, with a core concern to engage with the question of how we should live.  The most successful of these have experimented with a combination of churches centred on place and network, with intentional communities, cafes and centres to practice hospitality.  Many also have a rhythm, or rule of life to express what it means to be Christian in a postmodern context.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Mobsby, The Becoming of G-d, (Oxford: YTC Press, 2008), 30-1.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

===Communitarian or egalitarian ecclesiology===
Proponents of the movement communicate and interact through fluid and open networks because the movement is decentralized with little institutional coordination. Because of the participation values named earlier, being community through participation affects the governance of most Emerging Churches. Participants avoid power relationships, attempting to gather in ways specific to their local context. In this way some in the movement share with the house church movements a willingness to challenge traditional church structures/organizations though they also respect the different expressions of traditional Christian denominations.&lt;ref name=EVillageValues&gt;and a significant number of emerging church proponents remain in denominationally identified communities. There is also a significant presence within the movement that remains within traditional denominational structures. (Missional)

International research suggests that some Emerging Churches are utilizing a Trinitarian basis to being church through what Avery Dulles calls 'The Mystical Communion Model of Church'.&lt;ref&gt;A Dulles, ''Models of Church'', (New York: Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Ltd, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Not an institution but a fraternity (or sorority).
* Church as interpersonal community.
* Church as a fellowship of persons&amp;nbsp;– a fellowship of people with God and with one another in Christ.
* Connects strongly with the mystical 'body of Christ' as a communion of the spiritual life of faith, hope and charity.
* Resonates with Aquinas' notion of the Church as the principle of unity that dwells in Christ and in us, binding us together and in him.
* All the external means of grace, (sacraments, scripture, laws etc.) are secondary and subordinate; their role is simply to dispose people for an interior union with God effected by grace.&lt;ref&gt;I Mobsby, ''Emerging &amp; Fresh Expressions of Church'', (London: Moot Community Publishing, 2007), 54-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dulles sees the strength in this approach being acceptable to both Protestant and Catholic:

{{quotation|In stressing the continual mercy of God and the continual need of the Church for repentance, the model picks up Protestant theology... [and] in Roman Catholicism... when it speaks of the church as both holy and sinful, as needing repentance and reform...&lt;ref&gt;A Dulles, ''Models of Church''  (New York: Bantam Doubleday Dell, 1991) 46&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

{{quotation|The biblical notion of Koinonia, ... that God has fashioned for himself a people by freely communicating his Spirit and his gifts ... this is congenial to most Protestants and Orthodox ... [and] has an excellent foundation in the Catholic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;A Dulles, ''Models of Church'', 50-1.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

===Creative and rediscovered spirituality===
This can involve everything from expressive, [[neocharismatic]] style of worship and the use of [[contemporary music]] and films to more ancient liturgical customs and eclectic expressions of spirituality, with the goal of making the church gathering reflect the local community's tastes.

Emerging church practitioners are happy to take elements of worship from a wide variety of historic traditions, including traditions of the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Anglican]] churches, the [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches, and [[Celtic Christianity]]. From these and other religious traditions emerging church groups take, adapt and blend various historic church practices including [[liturgy]], [[prayer beads]], [[icon]]s, [[spiritual direction]], the [[labyrinth]], and [[lectio divina]]. The Emerging Church is also sometimes called the "Ancient-Future" church.&lt;ref&gt;Webber, Robert, John Burke, Dan Kimball, Doug Pagitt, Karen M. Ward, and Mark Driscoll. Listening to the Beliefs of Emerging Churches: Five Perspectives. (Grand Rapids, Mich: Zondervan, 2007) Appendix 2&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key social drives in Western Post-industrialised countries, is the rise in new/old forms of mysticism.&lt;ref&gt;E Davis, ''Techgnosis'', (London:Serpents Tail, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J Caputo, ''On Religion'', (London:Routledge, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; This rise in spirituality appears to be driven by the effects of consumerism, globalisation and advances in information technology.&lt;ref&gt;I Mobsby, ''Emerging &amp; Fresh Expressions of Church'', (London:Moot Community Publishing, 2007), Chapter Two and Three.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, the Emerging Church is operating in a new context of postmodern spirituality, as a new form of mysticism.  This capitalizes on the social shift in starting assumptions from the situation that most are regarded as materialist/atheist (the modern position), to the fact that many people now believe in and are searching for something more spiritual (postmodern view).  This has been characterised as a major shift from religion to spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Taylor, ''Entertainment Theology'', (Grand Rapids:Baker, 2008), 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

So, in the new world of 'spiritual tourism', the Emerging Church Movement is seeking to missionally assist people to shift from being spiritual tourists to Christian pilgrims.  Many are drawing on ancient Christian resources recontextualised into the contemporary such as [[contemplation]] and contemplative forms of prayer, symbolic multi-sensory worship, story telling and many others.&lt;ref&gt;I Mobsby, ''The Becoming of G-d'', (Oxford: YTC Press, 2008), 83-96.&lt;/ref&gt;  This again has required a change in focus as the majority of unchurched and dechurched people are seeking 'something that works' rather than something that is 'true'.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Taylor, ''Entertainment Theology'', (Grand Rapids:Baker, 2008), 96-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of new technologies===
Emerging-church groups use the Internet as a medium of decentralized communication.  Church websites are used as announcement boards for community activity, and they are generally a hub for more participation based new technologies such as blogs, Facebook groups, Twitter accounts, etc.  The use of the blog is an especially popular and appropriate means of communication within the Emerging church.  Through blogs, members converse about theology, philosophy, art, culture, politics, and social justice, both among their local congregations and across the broader Emerging community.  These blogs can be seen to embrace both sacred and secular culture side-by-side as an excellent example of the church's focus on contextual theology.

===Morality and justice===
Drawing on a more 'Missional Morality' that again turns to the synoptic gospels of Christ, many emerging-church groups draw on an understanding of God seeking to restore all things back into restored relationship.  This emphasises God's graceful love approach to discipleship, in following Christ who identified with the socially excluded and ill, in opposition to the Pharisees and Sadducees and their purity rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/ci_9495041 |title='Emerging church' seeks the justice Jesus sought |publisher=ContraCostaTimes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this movement, traditional Christians' emphasis on either individual salvation, end-times theology or the [[prosperity gospel]] have been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brianmclaren.net/archives/imported/reflections-on-amahoroafrica-may.html |title=Brian McLaren in Africa |publisher=Brianmclaren.net |date= |accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLaren |first=Brian |url=https://www.amazon.ca/dp/0849901839 |title=Everything must change |publisher=Amazon.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people in the movement express concern for what they consider to be the practical manifestation of God's kingdom on earth, by which they mean [[social justice]]. This concern manifests itself in a variety of ways depending on the local community and in ways they believe transcend "modernist" labels of "conservative" and "liberal." This concern for justice is expressed in such things as feeding the poor, visiting the sick and prisoners, stopping contemporary slavery, critiquing systemic and coercive power structures with "[[postcolonial]] [[hermeneutics]]," and working for environmental causes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian McLaren]] "Church Emerging: Or Why I Still Use the Word Postmodern But with Mixed Feelings" in ''[https://www.amazon.com/dp/080106807X An Emergent Manifesto of Hope]'' eds.

==Parallels in other religions==
Drawing on the success of Christian emerging church movements, a '[[Jewish Emergent]]' movement has come into being, often conducting dialogue with evangelical Christian emergent movements. [[Synagogue 3000]] describes its mission as "challenging and promising alternatives to traditional synagogue structures"—participants in the movement conduct worship outside of a traditional synagogue environment and attempt to engage with younger non-practising Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/parse/2008/may/emerging-synagogue.html|title=The Emerging Synagogue?|date=9 May 2008|journal=Parse, Christianity Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Emergent-Jews-consult-evangelicals-on-staying-relevant|title='Emergent Jews' consult evangelicals on staying relevant|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|date=22 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Emerging Patterns of Interreligious Conversation: A Christian-Jewish Experiment|author1=J.

The '''''Fortuyn''''' (also spelled '''''Fortuin''''') was a ship owned by the Chamber of Amsterdam of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) which was lost on its maiden voyage in 1723.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Lost VOC Ships at VOC Historical Society | url = http://www.voc.iinet.net.au/lostships.html | accessdate = 2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It set sail for [[Jakarta|Batavia]] from [[Texel]] in the [[Netherlands]] on 27 September 1723. The ship reached the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on 2 January 1723, and continued on its voyage on 18 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = VOC Shipwrecks - Fortuin | url = http://www.vocshipwrecks.nl/out_voyages7/fortuin.html | accessdate = 2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Fortuyn'' was never seen again and its fate is a matter of speculation. 

It was approximately 800 tons with a carrying capacity of 280 tons and 145 feet long.  On its maiden voyage it was commanded by [[Pieter Westrik]] and had a crew of 225 men.

== Location ==
Although VOC ships were not supposed to run within sight of the South Land ([[Australia]]) at that time of the year, it may have inadvertently sailed too far east and been wrecked off the [[Western Australia]]n coast. Wreckage sighted in the [[Houtman Abrolhos]] by survivors of the ''[[Zeewijk]]'' in 1727, and by the [[HMS Beagle|''Beagle'']] in 1840, could have been from the ''Fortuyn'', or alternatively from the [[Ridderschap van Holland (1682)|''Ridderschap van Holland'']], which disappeared in 1694, or less likely the ''[[Aagtekerke (ship)| Aagtekerke]]'' which disappeared in 1726. 

The Australian National Shipwrecks Database records the ship as "possibly wrecked near [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Cocos Island]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = National Shipwrecks database - Fortuyn | url = http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/heritage/nsd/nsd_form.pl?search_id=6792 | accessdate = 2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Ernest Thompson Edalji''' (22 January 1876 – 17 June 1953) was an [[English people|English]] solicitor of [[Parsi]] descent and son of a [[Vicar (Anglicanism)|vicar]] in a [[South Staffordshire]] village who served three years' hard labour after being convicted on a charge of injuring a pony. He was pardoned after a campaign in which Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] took a prominent role.

The difficulty in overturning the conviction of Edalji was cited as showing that a better mechanism was needed for reviewing unsafe verdicts, and it was a factor in the 1907 creation of the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]] for England.

==Background==
Edalji was the eldest of the three children. His mother was Charlotte Edalji (''née'' Stoneham), the daughter of a Shropshire vicar. His father was the Reverend [[Shapurji Edalji]], a convert from a Bombay [[Parsi people|Parsi]] family. He had served as the curate in several parishes before being given the [[Benefice|living]] as [[Vicar (Anglicanism)|vicar]] of [[St Mark's Church, Great Wyrley|St.&amp;nbsp;Mark's]], [[Great Wyrley]]. The right to make this appointment lay with the bishop, and the Reverend Edalji obtained the position through the previous incumbent, his wife's uncle, who arranged it as a wedding present. Livings were much sought after because they were scarce and conferred valuable emoluments.&lt;ref name=Risinger06/&gt;

The Reverend Edalji moved into the vicarage in late 1875, a large house with its own grounds; George, the first child, was born there soon after. The Reverend Edalji was more assertive than his predecessor and was sometimes involved in controversy about parish business.&lt;ref name=Risinger06/&gt; Many modern writers on the case express the opinion that rural English society was infected with backward racialist attitudes, and that this would have been particularly true of a village like [[Great Wyrley]].&lt;ref name=Christian13&gt;Christian, Paul. (2013). ‘Sherlock Holmes’ and the curious case of Welwyn Garden City man George Edalji. ''Welwyn Hatfield Times'' (online), 17&amp;nbsp;June, see [http://www.whtimes.co.uk/news/sherlock_holmes_and_the_curious_case_of_welwyn_garden_city_man_george_edalji_1_2232724], accessed 20 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; An aristocratic former army officer named Captain the Honorable G.A.&amp;nbsp;Anson was the Chief Constable of Staffordshire during the case. He is widely seen as having expressed a racist attitude toward the Edaljis.&lt;ref name=Costello06&gt;Costello, Peter. (2006). Persecution of George Edalji.

Accessed 20&amp;nbsp;September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anonymous Letters of 1888===
Anonymous threatening letters were sent to the vicarage in 1888, when George Edalji was twelve and a half, demanding that the Reverend order&lt;!---subscribe to?---&gt; a particular newspaper and threatening to break windows if this was not done. He ignored them. Windows were broken and a threat was made&lt;!---by whom??---&gt; to shoot the Reverend; he became alarmed and called in the police. Graffiti was written slandering the Edaljis on the inside and outside walls of the vicarage. Pseudonymous letters were sent to the vicarage maid-of-all-work, 17&amp;nbsp;year-old Elizabeth Foster, threatening to shoot her when her "Black master" was out. One was found inside the hall with the envelope wet; the letter was written on pages from the exercise books of the Edalji children.&lt;ref name=Weaver06&gt;Weaver, G. (2006). ''Conan Doyle and the Parson's Son: The George Edalji Case''. Cambridge, GBR: Vanguard, {{ISBN|1843862417}}, see [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1843862417], accessed 20&amp;nbsp;September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30f}}

The circumstances made it clear that either Foster or Edalji was responsible. Foster was implicated by assertions made by Edalji; the Reverend, his wife, and police Sergeant Upton thought that they perceived similarities between Foster's handwriting and that of the pseudonymous threatening letters.&lt;ref name=Weaver06/&gt;{{rp|30}} The Reverend prosecuted Foster for writing the letters, which she denied doing. He offered to drop the case if Foster confessed, but she refused and went to live with an aunt. Foster, unable to pay for a defense at trial, pleaded guilty in front of the magistrates in exchange for being given probation, but continued maintaining her innocence thereafter. The Reverend congratulated Upton for his performance.&lt;ref name=Risinger06/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weaver06/&gt;{{rp|32}}&lt;ref&gt;Weaver asserts that Captain Anson disapproved of Upton obtaining the conviction of Foster, which may have affected the way in which Upton dealt with the later 1892 letters, but apparently does not cite his source for that information. Weaver also says that Anson later "disingenuously" denied that he had been aware of the 1888 letters at the time that they happened. Weaver (2006), op. cit. p.&amp;nbsp;34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Letters and malicious mischief of 1892===
In 1892, a member of the parish council named W.H.&amp;nbsp;Brookes received obscene letters that included accounts of his adult daughter sexually abusing her 10&amp;nbsp;year-old sister. The letters mentioned Edalji among others at first, but increasingly concentrated on Edalji and the Reverend, sometimes using a phrase ("the blackman") that had occurred in 1888 letters attributed to Elizabeth Foster. One letter was made in two distinctly different handwritings. The letters to Brookes accused his son of writing the 1888 letters to the vicarage which had been attributed to Elizabeth Foster, and of giving them to George Edalji to post. Reverend Edalji and a vicarage servant also got letters, in which the Reverend was accused of "gross immorality with persons using Vaseline in the same way as did Oscar Wilde".{{cite quote|date=September 2015}} Letters purporting to be from the Reverend Edalji were sent to other vicars. Brookes and Reverend Edalji called in the police, and Sergeant Upton again found himself investigating poison pen letters to the vicar. Attempts to get the post office to identify the sender failed as the mailed letters ceased. Notes began appearing at the vicarage (a total of over&amp;nbsp;70), and various objects were left on the doorstep, including a bag of excrement. Police kept watch and claimed to have established that a stolen key had appeared on the doorstep in a time frame when only George Edalji had used the entrance. Following this, excrement was smeared on the outside of upstairs windows, and Upton decided that George had been responsible for the letters.&lt;ref name=Risinger06/&gt;

A police ploy was unsuccessful which was clearly aimed at getting Edalji to incriminate himself as the note writer, and it brought forth protests from his mother at the way the investigation was focusing on him. She and her husband demanded that Foster be arrested. A campaign of hoax ordering of goods and services for the vicarage lasted for 3&amp;nbsp;years. Police largely ceased investigating the incidents. In response to her protests, Chief Constable of the county Captain Anson told Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Edalji that she should make a serious effort to help catch the culprit if she wanted his men to spend more time on the matter, as it was obviously either her husband or son. Reverend Edalji threatened to complain to higher authority about the conduct of Anson. The notes and hoaxes ceased in December&amp;nbsp;1895.&lt;ref name=Risinger06/&gt;

===Perceptions of Edalji===
Brookes came to believe that Edalji was the author of the 1892 poison pen letters. He said that Edalji had smiled at him in the railway station, to which Brookes had responded with a disagreeable look; therefore, Brookes asserted, the letters began to refer to him as "sour face". Brookes also said that the letters to him stopped after he got out of a train and swung punches at Edalji on the platform, because he was peering in the compartments.&lt;ref name=Costello06/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weaver06/&gt;{{rp|44f}}

Edalji was hired at a legal firm as a trainee solicitor and scored exceptionally high marks in his professional examinations. In 1899, his family helped him set up on his own as a newly qualified solicitor, working out of an office in [[Birmingham]] and sometimes from the vicarage.

He was described as looking younger than his age, of a rather peculiar appearance, and solitary, being given to taking evening strolls by himself.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} A couple of roughs were fined for hitting him while he was walking three miles from his house one night in 1900; the assailants were not from [[Great Wyrley]] or known to Edalji.

His book ''Railway Law for the ‘Man in the train’'' was published in 1901.{{full citation needed|date=September 2015}} In the same year, solicitor and clerk to the court C.A.&amp;nbsp;Loxton accused Edalji of writing "immoral and offensive" allegations on walls about Loxton and his fiancée.&lt;ref name=Risinger06/&gt;

Most present-day comment on the case takes the view that the traditional culture in a Staffordshire village of the time would make George Edalji an object of suspicion because of his racial heritage &amp;ndash; yet Edalji's younger brother Horace does not seem to have encountered any difficulties with locals or the authorities.&lt;ref name=Risinger06/&gt;&lt;ref name=Costello06/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerr15/&gt;{{verification needed|date=September 2015}} &lt;ref name=Christian13/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nash08/&gt;

==1903 letters and animal maiming==
When Edalji was 27&amp;nbsp;years old in 1903, a series of slashings occurred against horses and other livestock, known as the [[Great Wyrley#The 'Great Wyrley Outrages'|'Great Wyrley Outrages']]. A horse was maimed on 1 February 1903, then two horses were similarly wounded on 29&amp;nbsp;June 1903, and a number of other animals received injuries resulting in their being put down.&lt;ref name=Weaver06/&gt;{{rp|17}} Isolated cases of livestock maiming were not unheard of as a way of settling scores in farming communities, but the series of attacks provoked a public outcry far beyond the area.

Police received pseudonymous letters purporting to be from one of a gang of culprits, and the letters named real people as members of the gang, including Edalji. Several others named in the letters were schoolboys whom Edalji regularly commuted with in the same train compartment.&lt;ref name=Star1903&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff writers |title=Cattle Maiming.

===Investigation===
Staffordshire Chief Constable Captain Anson was an administrator without experience of investigatory police work. He believed that Edalji was the author of the letters, but that he had no involvement in the animal maimings due to his professional status.&lt;ref name=Weaver06/&gt;{{rp|96}} Inspector Campbell headed enquiries into the maimings and, from an early stage, considered Edalji a person of particular interest, although there were a number of suspects.

The exact nature is not known regarding the circumstantial evidence that led to suspicion falling on Edalji; according to what Anson privately alleged years later, Edalji was seen 'prowling' the area at night and, on two occasions, trails of footprints from attack locations seemed to lead to the vicarage, and most of the crimes had occurred within a half mile radius of the vicarage. On 29&amp;nbsp;June, two horses were mutilated. Following this, the seventh attack, Campbell felt sure that Edalji was responsible for the maimings because he reportedly had been seen late on that night in the field where it took place.&lt;ref name=Weaver06/&gt;{{rp|96}}

Inspector Campbell began to focus on Edalji for the mutilations. Then a July&amp;nbsp;1903 letter threateningly predicted that "little girls" would be the target of the next attacks. Anson agreed to a watch being kept on the vicarage and nearby countryside.&lt;ref name=Risinger06/&gt; There were rumours that Edalji was going to be arrested for the attacks, and he offered a reward for information about who was spreading them. His habit of taking walks continued, and he returned from one at around 9&amp;nbsp;pm on 17&amp;nbsp;August.&lt;ref name=FeildingStar1903/&gt;

Early on 18&amp;nbsp;August, a wounded pony was discovered, half a mile from the scene of the first attack. Inspector Campbell sent a constable to the railway station where Edalji was waiting to catch his train, asking him to help with inquiries, but he declined and left for [[Birmingham]]. Inspector Campbell went to the vicarage with a sergeant and constable, and asked to see any weapons in the house; a small trowel was the only thing shown to them. Edalji's clothing was also asked for; it included muddy boots as well as mud-stained [[serge (fabric)|serge]] trousers and a housecoat—both of which the police said were damp. The inspector said that there was a hair on the housecoat, whereupon there was a dispute between the Inspector and the Reverend over whether something visible on the housecoat was a hair or a loose thread.&lt;ref name=Risinger06/&gt;&lt;ref name=Costello06/&gt;&lt;ref name=Star1903/&gt;&lt;ref name=FeildingStar1903/&gt;

The next day, police searched the vicarage and found a case with four razors in the bedroom that Edalji shared with his father. Reverend Edalji said that the razors were old ones not in use. According to the police, they pointed out that one razor was wet; the Reverend took it and wiped the blade with his thumb; he later said that this was not true.&lt;ref name=Star1903/&gt; Police said that a heel on the boots was worn down in an unusual way and left a distinctive pattern on the ground that matched heel impressions in an alleged trail of footprints between the vicarage and the scene of the crime. A local doctor who examined the housecoat for the police said that it was bloodstained, and there were 29&amp;nbsp;hairs on it similar to ones from the pony's hide near the wound. The doctor said that the hairs were small and difficult to see.&lt;ref name=Risinger06/&gt;&lt;ref name=Costello06/&gt;

Home Office officials later considered it highly unlikely that police would have gone on to fabricate evidence by planting the hairs after the Edaljis had vehemently drawn attention to the absence of hairs on the housecoat while it was handed over.&lt;ref name=Weaver06/&gt;{{rp|193}}

== Conviction and campaign for pardon==
Edalji consistently maintained that he was innocent of all charges. He pleaded not guilty to injuring the pony; an indictment was not tried for sending a letter threatening to kill a policeman. The trial was moved out of the village, which meant that the jury was of people who did not know Edalji. The prosecution accused Edalji of having left the house and attacked the pony in the early hours of the morning. The Reverend said that he had hardly slept that night and knew that Edalji could not have left the bedroom which they shared, the door of which he had locked as usual. According to [[Richard Davenport-Hines]], writing in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The case arrayed against young Edalji was preposterous. As an [[astigmatism|astigmatic myopic]] he was incapable of complicated nocturnal excursions; the vicarage was surrounded on the night of 17&amp;nbsp;August by a cordon of men through which he could not have penetrated; apparently incriminating dirty razors found in a police search of the vicarage were stained with rust, not blood; putatively incriminating mud found on his clothes and boots did not come from the field where the horse was slaughtered; horse hairs which police claimed to have found on his coat were probably threads; his father’s sworn oath that they had slept the night in the same room behind a locked door was disregarded. After George Edalji was condemned to seven years’ penal servitude, his family was brutally baited.&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=57480|title=Edalji, Shapurji (1841/2–1918), Church of England clergyman and victim of racial harassment|first= Richard |last= Davenport-Hines|authorlink=Richard Davenport-Hines}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Edalji was convicted and sentenced to seven years hard labour. Edalji’s defence did not mention his eyesight; Edalji later said that he had been told by his lawyers that the prosecution case was so weak that he was sure to be acquitted, and thus it was unnecessary to bring up how poor his vision was.&lt;ref name=Risinger06/&gt; Some 10,000&amp;nbsp;signatures, including hundreds from lawyers, were on petitions that protested the conviction. Some legal figures thought that it was improper under English evidence law for Edalji to be sent for trial charged with separate offences of sending a threatening letter and a pony maiming, and then having evidence about letters used to help convict him of the maiming, which was the sole offence for which he was tried.

R.D. Yelverton, former Chief Justice in the Bahamas, thought that the case for the prosecution had been conclusively disproved. He asked: “How could a gentleman in the position and of the education of Mr.&amp;nbsp;Edalji, be supposed to write the following, put by the Prosecution before the Jury, as written by him. (They were sent either to the Police or to himself). ‘You great hulking blackguard and coward I have got you fixed you dirty Cad &amp;ndash; bloody monkey!’”&lt;ref name=Birmingham15lttr&gt;Yelverton, R.D. (1906). Letter Written by R.D.&amp;nbsp;Yelverton in Support of George Edalji. ''Birmingham City Council'' (online), at "Things to do: Libraries, Archives, and Heritage"; The George Edalji Case, see [http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/cs/Satellite?c=Page&amp;childpagename=Lib-Central-Archives-and-Heritage%2FPageLayout&amp;cid=1223092759550&amp;pagename=BCC%2FCommon%2FWrapper%2FWrapper], accessed 20 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Senior civil servants at the Home Office reviewed the case and reported that there were no serious flaws in the trial and conviction of Edalji. He was paroled after serving three years.&lt;ref name=Risinger06/&gt;&lt;ref name=Costello06/&gt;

===Conan Doyle===
[[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], then second only to [[Rudyard Kipling]] as a celebrated British writer, became the most influential supporter of the public campaign for Edalji’s pardon. The weight that Conan Doyle’s opinion on the case carried with the public stemmed from the appeal of his fictional master detective [[Sherlock Holmes]], which associated the author with Holmesian traits of close attention to detail and drawing logical inferences. These were valid principles that outlined the scientific method, according to [[Maria Konnikova]].&lt;ref name=Konnikova13&gt;Konnikova, M. (2013). The Scientific Method of the Mind. [In] ''Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes'', pp.&amp;nbsp;9-24, Westminster, LND, GBR: Penguin, {{ISBN|014312434X}} and 1101606231, see [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1101606231]. Accessed 20&amp;nbsp;September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Boiled down, the idea was that cool reflection on what “an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his way” enabled one “to use observation to deduce meaning from an otherwise meaningless fact.”{{cite quote|date=September 2015}} In contrast, the natural human tendency was to “spontaneously construct narratives, and firmly believe in their veracity”, which &amp;ndash; as Konnikova writes &amp;ndash; is exemplified by the cognitive style of Dr.&amp;nbsp;Watson, in which “it is incredibly difficult to resist our desire to form narratives, to tell stories even if they may not be altogether correct, or correct at all.”&lt;ref name=Risinger06/&gt;&lt;ref name=Konnikova13/&gt; As his creator admitted, Holmes was an idealised reasoner without light or shade.&lt;ref name=Risinger06/&gt;

Conan Doyle arrived to meet with Edalji at a hotel after becoming interested in the case, and he recalled that he paused to study Edalji, who was passing the time reading a newspaper while waiting in the lobby. On observing how Edalji held the paper at an angle inches from his face, Conan Doyle was convinced that Edalji was innocent; he believed it impossible for someone with eyesight as bad as Edalji’s to have moved through the countryside after nightfall attacking animals and successfully evading the police.&lt;ref name=Risinger06/&gt;&lt;ref name=Costello06/&gt;&lt;ref name=Konnikova13/&gt;

Anson corresponded with Conan Doyle and met with him in January&amp;nbsp;1907 to discuss the case, but relations became acrimonious between them two days later when Anson was informed by Conan Doyle that he intended to campaign for Edalji to be given a pardon. Anson thought that a firm conclusion could not have been reached from a neutral standpoint in that amount of time, and that Conan Doyle had obtained his co-operation and an interview by misrepresenting himself as having no settled opinion about the case. Conan Doyle wrote to the Home Office saying that Anson had implied homosexual incest between the Reverend and Edalji. Anson insisted that he did no such thing.&lt;ref name=Risinger06/&gt;&lt;ref name=Costello06/&gt;

====1907 letters====
The same day that Conan Doyle wrote his letter of intent to Captain Anson, a long pseudonymous letter was sent to Conan Doyle, Edalji, and Anson with apparent inside knowledge of the arguments which Conan Doyle intended to publish, the first of a spate about the case that they received. It purported to be by a private detective who had been summoned to the vicarage; this was similar to an ingenious deception perpetrated during the hoax campaign of 1892, when a female private detective was led to believe that she was working for Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Edalji to investigate suspected infidelity by the Reverend. It has been questioned whether the detailed knowledge of incidents at the vicarage and Edaji’s professional life that were demonstrated in the letter could have come from anyone not at the center of those events or part of the investigation into them. Attribution of the letters is further complicated by police having used the ploy of sending pseudonymous letters to Edalji on a couple of occasions before his arrest.&lt;ref name=Risinger06/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weaver06/&gt;

The “private detective” letter of 1907 ostensibly offered to help Edalji, but seemed to be an obvious trap. It has been suggested that the letters were aimed at disrupting the campaign to have him granted a pardon.&lt;ref name=Weaver06/&gt;{{rp|30}} &lt;ref&gt;See footnote&amp;nbsp;32 in Weaver (2006), op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; The police handwriting consultant said that the letter was by Edalji in his ‘Greatorex’ hand. Police believed that such letters had ceased while Edalji was in prison, and they attributed those pseudonymous or anonymous letters about the case received when Edalji was in gaol to persons other than the author of the 1903 pseudonymous ‘Greatorex’ letters, which police believed was Edalji. [[Poison pen letter]]s in the name of the “Wyrley Gang” continued until the 1930s, by an offender who also wrote to people connected to other crimes in the news.&lt;ref name=Risinger06/&gt;&lt;ref name=Costello06/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weaver06/&gt;{{rp|7}} &lt;ref name=Times1934&gt;Anon. (1934). Labourer Sent to Penal Servitude. ''The Times'' (London), 7&amp;nbsp;November 1934 [at ''Casebook: Jack the Ripper'' (online)], see [http://www.casebook.org/press_reports/times/19341107.html]. Accessed 20&amp;nbsp;September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Campaign====
Conan Doyle became an active investigator, going to the crime scenes, interviewing participants, and critiquing the reliability of the witness who testified that peculiarities found in the handwriting of Edalji also occurred in the 1903 pseudonymous ‘Greatorex’ letters to police, which named Edalji as a culprit in the animal mutilations. Legal technicalities made the evidence controversial concerning the letters being used to convict Edalji, because he was not tried on the charge of sending a threatening letter. Opinion within the Home Office was split on the matter. Conan Doyle thought that he had identified the person as a certain Royden Sharp who was behind the pseudonymous letters of 1892 and 1903 and the maimings. There have been a variety of opinions since about whether he was justified in his belief, although [[Peter Costello]] wrote a modern book on Conan Doyle’s investigations and concurred with his conclusion.&lt;ref name=Risinger06/&gt;&lt;ref name=Costello06/&gt;

====Pardon====
Newspapers suggested that visual impairment would have made it impossible for Edalji to have committed the crime. Captain Anson told the Home Office that he thought that Edalji was physically more than capable of the nocturnal maiming, asserting that Edalji had a panther-like gait and eyes that “came out with a strange sort of glow, like a cat’s eyes” in a low light.&lt;ref name=Risinger06&gt;Risinger, D. Michael. (2006). Boxes in Boxes: Julian Barnes, Conan Doyle, Sherlock Holmes and the Edalji Case. ''International Commentary on Evidence'', ''4''&amp;nbsp;(2), Article&amp;nbsp;3, pp.&amp;nbsp;1-90, see [http://shulawold.wsits.com/uploads/risinger_ICE.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Accessed 20&amp;nbsp;September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Anson's communications with the Home Office about the case, an assertion was “indisputably false” that Edalji made in a letter published in a newspaper to the effect that he was not abroad after nightfall.&lt;ref name=Weaver06/&gt;{{rp|258}} Anson said that several people remembered coming across Edalji very late at night and miles from his house during 1903.&lt;ref name=Weaver06/&gt;{{rp|258}}

Conan Doyle’s articles in support may have been a key factor in getting the authorities to commission a committee of inquiry. Edalji was granted a pardon for the maiming conviction in May&amp;nbsp;1907, though the inquiry found that he had brought prosecution upon himself by sending the pseudonymous ‘Greatorex’ letters to police during the summer of 1903, which meant that he was not given compensation.&lt;ref name=Risinger06/&gt;&lt;ref name=Costello06/&gt;

====Aftermath====
Edalji’s case and the associated campaign were factors in the creation of England’s [[Court of Criminal Appeal]] in 1907.&lt;ref name=Risinger06/&gt; A June&amp;nbsp;1907 memo by Home secretary [[Herbert Gladstone]] was discovered 80&amp;nbsp;years later, which revealed that one of the lawyers who had represented Edalji had privately told Gladstone of suppressing a letter by Edalji, which his brother Horace had brought as a specimen of Edalji’s handwriting, because it was damaging to the defence’s case. It consisted of obscenities similar to ones that Edalji was accused of sending. When the 1907 letters started, the lawyer’s colleague remarked “He is at it again.”&lt;ref name=Risinger06/&gt;

In November&amp;nbsp;1907, Edalji was accepted back on to the roll of solicitors in good standing and allowed to practice, despite the Committee of Inquiry’s conclusion that he had written some of the 1903 letters. His sister Maud moved in with him, and they lived together in [[Welwyn Garden City]] until his death in 1953.&lt;ref name=Costello06/&gt; In 2013 [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor-General]] [[Oliver Heald]] said that the trial of Edalji had been a farce.&lt;ref name=Christian13/&gt;

==In popular culture==

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An announcement in the back of one edition of ''[[Earth (Brin novel)|Earth]]'' is for a novel titled ''Stratos'', to be released in the spring of 1992.  It seems likely that this was delayed, and renamed ''Glory Season''.

==Plot summary==
Three thousand years before the story starts, Lysos founds a human colony on the isolated planet of Stratos in an effort to radically re-engineer human life into a happier, more pastoral form. She developed a strain of human beings that conceives clones in winter (always female), while those conceived in summer (variants or "vars") obtain their genes through sexual reproduction just in case biological adaptation becomes necessary. Further, males and females have opposed seasons of sexual receptivity: men in summer and women in winter.  This scheme is said to be stable over evolutionary time because women gain an advantage from self-cloning, while men only reproduce in summer.  Finally, men have been made far less aggressive during the times that they are less sexually receptive and are much less numerous. The social result is that the vast majority of the population of Stratos consists of groups of female clones, each in its own social or economic niche.  Over the centuries, these groups have come to dominate society.  Men are confined to relatively few professions (such as sailing) and have a lower social status than clones, but higher than vars. In each generation, a few women vars become successful enough to found their own clan or "hive" of clones.

As is customary, clones are trained to carry on their clan's business, while vars leave as young adults to seek their fortune. It is time for identical twins Maia and Leie to enter the outside world. They plan to work as sailors to gain experience and explore Stratos, find their niche, and found a clan. Almost immediately, they hit a snag. The only two ship's captains willing to take them on at that time insist they split up, because they cannot have it appear to their clone passengers that clones are doing lowly ship's work. The ships are traveling together. Aboard, Maia meets Naroin, a highly competent female bosun's mate. Later, Leie's ship is lost in a storm. Maia is heartbroken and seriously injured, but eventually recuperates and finds a job on a railroad.

On the railroad, Maia discovers her var temporary assistant is actually a clone courier and courtesan running illegal drugs.  The drugs are designed to shift a man's period of sexual interest.  They are part of a plot by reactionary "Perkinites" (named after [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], author of ''[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]'') to minimize the role of men in an isolated valley, and perhaps later all of Stratos.

Maia notifies the "Planetary Equilibrium Authority", but is kidnapped and imprisoned by the Perkinites.  She discovers that Renna, a prisoner in another cell, is transmitting messages electrically.  She talks with Renna by code and develops a friendship with her unseen fellow inmate. When she discovers that Renna is being transferred somewhere else, Maia engineers her escape, only to find that idealistic radicals ("rads") and their allies have already freed Renna, who is actually the "Visitor," a ''male'' envoy from the rest of humanity whose arrival has triggered great debate among the leaders of Stratos as to how to respond to the renewed - and unwanted - contact. She tags along with Renna and the rads.

A platonic friendship develops between Renna and Maia.  Their group, which includes Naroin, is later overtaken at sea by pirates (pirating being a tolerated, legal activity). During the ensuing boarding fight, Maia is shocked when she encounters her sister, one of the pirates. The pirates win, with the help of traitors planted in the rads' group. They strand many of their female prisoners, including Maia and Naroin, and one young male sailor named Brod on a deserted island and take Renna, their prize, to a secret base.

After the castaways manage to ambush pirates sent to eliminate all witnesses, they sail off to alert the authorities, but Maia, accompanied only by Brod, sets out to try to rescue Renna.  They inadvertently stumble upon the pirate base. While secretly reconnoitering it, Maia helps free more prisoners, including the rads and the crew of her ship. She also learns that Renna has somehow escaped. More fighting breaks out when their enemies learn the rest of their prisoners are loose. In the turmoil, Maia and her allies are cornered, but she finds a secret exit which leads to the long-lost "Jellicoe Former", an advanced manufacturing facility that can produce anything.  Renna is killed when the spaceship he found and completed at Jellicoe Former explodes soon after its launch. Maia is severely injured in the battle. The police and other interested parties arrive to save the survivors of Maia's side.

While recuperating, Maia is dragged into politics and kept a prisoner discreetly by one clan because she has become a symbol. She tells her story to a group of male heads of sailing clans. One of them turns out to be the father she had never known. For her actions, they offer her "clan" an alliance. At the end, with Renna dead, Maia becomes an embarrassment to her captors, so she is allowed to walk away free. She decides that she will not found a clan of clones, but rather have offspring the old way.

==Major themes==
The nature of the novel is a subject of some contention, some believing that the setting is a [[feminism|feminist]] [[utopian|utopia]], others holding it to be a [[dystopia]]n work functioning as a [[post-feminism|post-feminist]] critique of [[feminist|feminism]]. The structure of the society is complex enough to make either interpretation possible, though the society's origin and structure is based on an extreme of [[separatist feminism]].  Also, the structure of the society as seen within the narrative supports the view of [[biological determinism]] when it comes to the relationship between genetics and gender roles.

The author, in the novel's afterword, explains that the idea for the society in which the story takes place originated from a study of [[Aphid#Reproduction|reproductive cycle of aphids]], which is [[Heterogamy|heterogamous]].  Aphids alternate between [[asexual reproduction]] in the Summer, i.e., when the environment is favorable and there is plenty of food, and sexually in the Fall when the organism is stressed by its environment.  This has the biological advantage of ensuring identical copies of the parent will be well suited to take advantage of the favorable conditions, and variation in offspring in a stressful environment in hopes some of the offspring will find the environment favorable, even when the parents do not.  The entire social construct in the novel is therefore an extrapolation of this idea onto a human culture, where successful female clans (female, because only they can produce offspring) can take advantage of their sociological niches by producing exact copies, and unsuccessful females produce variable offspring sexually.  One could argue that successful human organizations such as the clans require a variety of personality types and individuals of complementary skill sets to be successful as an organization.  While this criticism is not directly addressed, it might act as a limiter on how large a particular clan could grow, since inevitably a large organizational structure would require specialization of tasks for which none of the clan members may be suited.

}}'''Maharani Ayilyom Thirunal Gouri Lakshmi Bayi''' (1791–1815) was the [[Maharani]] of the Indian state of [[Travancore]] from 1810 till 1813 and Regent from 1813 till her death in 1815 for her son [[Swathi Thirunal]] Rama Varma. She was the only Queen of Travancore to have reigned in her own right which she did for two years before becoming a regent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gauri Lakshmi Bai|first=Aswathi Thirunal|title=SREE PADMANABHA SWAMY KSHETRAM|year=1998|publisher=The State Institute Of Languages|location=Thiruvananthapuram|isbn=978-81-7638-028-7|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Gouri Lakshmi Bayi was born in the year 1791 to Princess Attham Thirunal, Senior Rani of [[Attingal]] of the [[Travancore Royal Family]], adopted sister of Maharajah [[Balarama Varma]]. Attham Thirunal was adopted into the [[Travancore]] family from [[Kolathunad]] in 1788. The Maharanis of [[Travancore]] were styled as the "Ranis of Attingal". Gowri Lakshmi Bayi was one of [[Travancore|Travancore']]s most popular Queens and introduced several reforms in the state.

==Accession==
The unpopular Maharajah Bala Rama Varma, during whose reign Travancore faced a number of internal and external problems, revolts and unnecessary battles and conspiracies, including the most important revolt of [[Velu Thampi Dalawa]], died in 1811. At the death of the Maharajah, Gowri Lakshmi Bayi, the senior Rani of Attingal, was barely twenty years of age. There were no eligible male members in the family which meant she would have to take over [[Travancore]] and rule it as regent till such an heir would be born to her. However her accession was not easy because a member from the [[Mavelikara]] branch of the royal family, a distant cousin, Prince Kerala Varma, who was the pet of the previous ruler, staked a claim on the throne which was anything but substantiated. The Princess placed in the hands of the British Resident Col. John Munro, one of [[Travancore]]'s most loved British Residents, a document asserting her claim and proving the claim of Kerala Varma untenable. This irked Kerala Varma who resorted to tact and tried to convince the Princess to give up her claim. However the Resident sided with Gowri Lakshmi Bayi and she was made the Regent Maharani of [[Travancore]] in 1811. Kerala Varma was permitted to reside at [[Trivandrum]], the capital; but when he tried to create further troubles, he was imprisoned and banished from [[Travancore]].

==Colonel Munro Dewan==
One of the earliest acts of Regent Gowri Lakshmi Bayi was to dismiss the existing [[Dewan]] or Prime Minister, Ummini Thampi. Ummini Thampi was accused of squandering money and acquiring all the property of the vanquished rebel freedom fighter [[Velu Thampi Dalawa]] and others. He was dismissed and when he tried to cause further trouble he was imprisoned and punished after being found guilty of conspiracy against the Regent Maharani Gowri Lakshmi Bayi. The Maharani was now asked to nominate some individual for the post of [[Dewan]], to which she stated that she found no eligible individual and would like to appoint the Resident Colonel John Munro as her [[Dewan]]. Accordingly, Munro became Dewan of [[Travancore]] in 1811.

==Government reforms==
* The [[Dewan]] Col. Munro informed the Maharani of the widespread corruption in her Government owing to the practice of giving all power, administrative and judicial, to a single officer right from village level to district level. To end this the Proverticars (village officers), Kariakkars ([[Taluka]] officers) and the district officials were all deprived of their judicial powers and instead a Court of Appeal and five District Courts at [[Padmanabhapuram]], [[Mavelikara]], [[Trivandrum]], Vaikam and Alwaye were established and modern judicial system was introduced in [[Travancore]]. The Courts had each two judges and a [[Brahmin]] Sastri.  For the trial of Government servants another court known as the ''Huzhur'' court was also established.
* The Police was reorganised in [[Travancore]] during the reign of Maharani Gowri Lakshmi Bayi at the suggestion of Col. John Munro [[Dewan]].
* Deprived of magisterial and judicial power, the district and village officials now could concentrate their attention on the collection of revenue alone, curtailing their power greatly and making them subject to judicial trial in case of misconduct. The revenue department was cleaned of corruption and revenue collection became smoother and organised.

==Social reforms==
* Taxes on festivals, taxes on inheritance of property were abolished.
* [[Travancore]] contained a large number of ''Devaswoms'' or Temple Corporations that held vast areas of land and controlled most of the important and wealthy temples in the country. These corporations had fallen prey to corruption and mismanagement and they next engaged the [[Dewan|Dewan']]s attention. More than three hundred of the biggest temples of [[Travancore]] were appropriated by the Government under a Devaswom Board and cleared of corruption and mismanagement.
* By a Royal Proclamation in 1812 5th December, Her Highness Maharani Gowri Lakshmi Bayi abolished the purchase and sale of all slaves and granted them independence excepting those attached to the soil for agricultural purposes.
* Castes like the [[Ezhava]]s, Kaniyans etc. were given independence from their Lords. A restriction put on the Sudras and others regarding the wearing of gold and silver ornaments was removed.
* A vaccination department was started in [[Travancore]] in 1813 under her regency. Finding orthodox reservations amongst her subjects with regard to vaccination, the Queen first vaccinated herself and other members of the Royal family to reassure her people.

==Change in Dewanship==
In 1814, [[Colonel]] John Munro resigned his Dewanship as it was not a permanent arrangement for the Resident to take that post. In his stead the Judge of the Appeal Court, Devan Padmanabhan was appointed as [[Dewan]]. However he soon after died from [[smallpox]].  In his place, one of Col. Munro's assistants, Bappu Rao, was appointed as [[Dewan]] of [[Travancore]] in that same year.

==Family and demise==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Gpb.JPG|thumbnail|Padmanabha Sevini Vanchi Dharma Dyumini Raja Rajeshwari Maharani [[Gowri Parvati Bayi]] of [[Travancore]], who succeeded Gowri Lakshmi Bayi.]] --&gt;
The Maharani was married to a Koil Thampuran, Prince Rajaraja Varma Avargal of the [[Changanassery]] Royal Family. From this marriage Gowri Lakshmi Bayi had issue two sons and a daughter. Her daughter was Maharani Gowri Rukmini Bayi born in 1809. Her eldest son was born on 16 April 1813, the famous King [[Swathi Thirunal]] who was a musician and artist and ruled independently from 1829-1846. He married a lady who belonged to the Thiruvattar [[Ammaveedu]] family. The Maharani next had a son in 1814, Maharajah [[Uthram Thirunal]] who ruled from 1846-1860. The Maharani Gowri Lakshmi Bayi started losing her health after giving birth to [[Uthram Thirunal]] and died in 1815. She was succeeded as Regent Maharani by her sister, [[Gowri Parvati Bayi]]. Her only daughter, who was now the only female in the matriarchal Travancore Royal Family, Gowri Rukmini Bayi married Rama Varma Koil Thampuran of [[Thiruvalla]] Royal Family in 1819 and had seven children, five sons and two daughters. One of these daughters died soon while the other married and had two sons, including [[Moolam Thirunal]] Sir Rama Varma. She too died in 1857 after the birth of [[Moolam Thirunal]] and so in 1858 two princesses were adopted from the [[Mavelikara]] Royal family into Travancore.

A memorial service was held in the Capitol on July 28, 1998.  Among those in attendance were President [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Al Gore]]. The [[coffin]]s of Gibson and Chestnut were displayed in the [[United States Capitol rotunda]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aoc.gov/nations-stage/lying-state-honor |title= "Lying in State or in Honor" |publisher=US Architect of the Capitol (AOC) |accessdate=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, an [[Lying in state|honor usually reserved]] for former Presidents, members of Congress, or military heroes.

==Life==
Pass was an established [[Intaglio printing|copper plate]] engraver in [[Pentonville]], London.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard Adams|title=London Illustrated, 1604-1851: A Survey and Index of Topographical Books and Their Plates|date=1 January 1983|publisher=Oryx Press|isbn=978-0-85365-734-7|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made plates for ''The History, Civil and Ecclesiastical, and Survey of the Antiquities of Winchester'' (1798–1801) by [[John Milner (bishop)|John Milner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Upcott|title=A Bibliographical Account of the Principal Works Relating to English Topography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6cgKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA288|year=1818|publisher=R. and A.

John Paas (name used legally) was murdered in [[Leicester]] by James Cook, in a criminal case that attracted wide attention. He was aged 49, a partner in the firm Paas &amp; Co. of [[High Holborn]], London, engravers. He was in Leicester as a travelling salesman of specialist hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben Beazley|title=Leicester Murders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=soc7AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT13|date=29 February 2012|publisher=History Press|isbn=978-0-7524-8423-5|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cook, a printer and bookbinder, was exhibited on a [[gibbet]] after being hanged, the last British criminal to be so treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeremy Beadle|author2=Ian Harrison|title=Firsts, Lasts and Onlys: Crime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CQdOF2zxlGgC&amp;pg=PA55|year=2007|publisher=Pavilion Books|isbn=978-1-905798-04-9|pages=55–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paas &amp; Co.==
The firm of C. and A. Paas &amp; Co. was in business at various Holborn addresses in the second half of the 18th century.

Brewer attended Bar Harbor High School in [[Bar Harbor, Maine]].&lt;ref name=bdn/&gt; In 1968, Brewer and his friend and former high school football teammate, Father [[James Gower]], conceived the idea of a four-year college to be located on Mount Desert Island.&lt;ref name=wmtv/&gt; Mount Desert Island residents had wanted a four-year college, with an environmental focus, to stimulate the island's [[economy]] during the off-season, when revenue from [[tourism]] declined.&lt;ref name=bdn/&gt; Brewer and Gower founded the school in 1969.&lt;ref name=bdn/&gt; Three other Mount Desert residents were also involved in the establishment of the college: Bernard K. "Sonny" Cough, Richard Lewis and Robert Smith.&lt;ref name=bdn/&gt; 

The College of the Atlantic began offering its first classes in 1972 with an enrollment of just 32 students.&lt;ref name=wmtv/&gt;&lt;ref name=bdn/&gt; The institution now has approximately 300 students, as of the 2012-2013 school year.&lt;ref name=bdn/&gt; Since its establishment, the College of the Atlantic has offered only one [[academic major]], [[human ecology]].&lt;ref name=wmtv/&gt;

This '''list of Formula One fatalities''' includes drivers who have died during a [[Formula One#Distinction between Formula One and World Championship races|FIA World Championship race]] weekend, and those who have died while driving modern or vintage [[Formula One car]]s outside the World Championship.  [[Motorsport marshal|Track marshals]] and other race attendees who have died as a result of these accidents are not included in the list.  Fifty-two drivers have died from incidents that occurred at a FIA World Championship event or while driving a Formula One car at another event, with [[Cameron Earl]] being the first in {{F1|1952}}.  Thirty-two of the drivers died from incidents during Grand Prix race weekends which formed part of the World Championship, seven during test sessions and twelve during non-championship Formula One events.  The [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] has seen the most fatalities; seven drivers have died there during the time that the [[Indianapolis 500]] formed part of the world championship.  Fifteen drivers died in the 1950s; fourteen in the 1960s; twelve in the 1970s; four in the 1980s and two in the 1990s.  Following the deaths of [[Roland Ratzenberger]] and [[Death of Ayrton Senna|Ayrton Senna]] at [[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari|Imola]] on consecutive days in {{F1|1994}}, there were no driver fatalities caused during world championship events for more than 20 years until [[Jules Bianchi]]'s death in 2015, from injuries sustained during the [[2014 Japanese Grand Prix]],&lt;ref name="Bianchi" /&gt; although three drivers died in the intervening years while driving former Formula One cars (two from the 1960s, one from the 1990s) in vintage racing and other events not associated with World Championship Grands Prix.&lt;ref name="Dawson-Damer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glatz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Welch" /&gt;

Two Formula One [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Champions]] have died while racing or practising in Formula One, [[Jochen Rindt]] in {{F1|1970}}, and Senna in 1994.  Rindt is the only driver to win the championship posthumously.&lt;ref name="Rindt" /&gt;

[[File:Maria Malibran.jpg|thumb|220px|Maria Malibran]]

'''Maria Felicia Malibran''' (24 March 1808 – 23 September 1836) was a Spanish [[mezzo-soprano]] who commonly sang both [[contralto]] and [[soprano]] parts, and was one of the best-known opera singers of the 19th century. Malibran was known for her stormy personality and dramatic intensity, becoming a legendary figure after her death at age 28. Contemporary accounts of her voice describe its range, power and flexibility as extraordinary.

==Life and career==
Malibran was born in Paris as '''María Felicitas García Sitches''' into a famous Spanish musical family. Her father, [[Manuel del Pópulo Vicente García|Manuel García]], was a celebrated [[tenor]] much admired by [[Gioacchino Rossini|Rossini]], having created the role of Count Almaviva in his ''[[The Barber of Seville]]''. García was also a composer and an influential vocal instructor, and he was her first voice teacher. He was described as inflexible and tyrannical; the lessons he gave his daughter became constant quarrels between two powerful egos.

===Early career===
[[Image:La Malibran (Maria) par F. Bouchot.jpg|thumb|180px|&lt;center&gt;''La Malibran'', [[François Bouchot]] (1834). musée de la Vie romantique, dépôt du Louvre, Paris&lt;/center&gt;]]
Malibran first appeared on stage in [[Naples]] with her father in [[Ferdinando Paër|Paër]]’s ''Agnese'', when she was 8 years old. When she was 17, she was a singer in the choir of the King's Theatre in London. When prima donna [[Giuditta Pasta]] became indisposed, García suggested that his daughter take over in the role of Rosina in ''[[The Barber of Seville]]''. The audience loved the young mezzo, and she continued to sing this role until the end of the season.

===Later career===
When the season closed, García immediately took his operatic troupe to New York. The troupe consisted primarily of the members of his family: Maria, her brother, [[Manuel Patricio Rodríguez García|Manuel]], and their mother, [[Joaquina Sitchez]], also called "la Briones". Maria's younger sister, [[Pauline Viardot|Pauline]], who would later become a famous singer in her own right under the name of [[Pauline Viardot]], was then only four years old.

This was the first time that Italian opera was performed in New York. Over a period of nine months, Maria sang the lead roles in eight operas, two of which were written by her father. In New York, she met and hastily married a banker, Francois Eugene Malibran, who was 28 years her senior. It is thought that her father forced Maria to marry him in return for the banker's promise to give Manuel García 100,000 francs. However, according to other accounts, she married simply to escape her tyrannical father. A few months after the wedding, her husband declared bankruptcy, and Maria was forced to support him through her performances. After a year, she left Malibran and returned to Europe.
[[File:Charles-Auguste de Bériot by Charles Baugniet 1838.jpg|left|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Belgian violinist [[Charles Auguste de Bériot|Charles-Auguste de Bériot]] next to Malibran's bust (Library of the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
In Europe, Malibran sang the title role at the premiere of [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]'s ''[[Maria Stuarda]]''. The opera was based on [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s play ''[[Mary Stuart (play)|Mary Stuart]]'', and as it portrayed [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] in a sympathetic light, censors demanded textual amendments, which Malibran often ignored. The Library of the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]] conserves a series of interesting coloured costume projects&lt;ref&gt;Maria Malibran, ''La Réforme du Théâtre'', (Library of the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]], B-Bc, Maria Malibran fund, FC-2-MM-073).&lt;/ref&gt; for this play, created by Malibran, revealing her unsuspected drawing talent.

Malibran became romantically involved with the Belgian violinist, [[Charles Auguste de Bériot]]. The pair lived together as a [[common-law marriage|common-law]] couple for six years and a child was born to them in 1833 (the piano pedagogue [[Charles-Wilfrid de Bériot]]), before Maria obtained an [[annulment]] of her marriage to Malibran. [[Felix Mendelssohn]] wrote an [[aria]] accompanied by a solo violin especially for the couple. Malibran sang at the [[Paris Opera]] among other major opera houses. In Paris, she met and performed with [[Michael William Balfe|Michael Balfe]].

===Last years and death&lt;ref&gt;The Library of The [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]] conserves, amongst others, the death mask, the poignant 4-page funerary report of Dr. Belluomini as well as the authorisation of the Manchester ecclesiastical authority to have Malibran's body transferred to Brussels ([[Maria Malibran fund]], B-Bc; FC-2-MM-006 sq.).&lt;/ref&gt;===
In 1834, Malibran moved to England and began to perform in London. In late May 1836, she starred in ''[[The Maid of Artois]]'', written for her by Balfe. Earlier that year she had returned to Milan to sing the title role in the premiere of Vaccai's ''[[Giovanna Gray]]''. In July 1836, Malibran [[List of horse accidents|fell from her horse]] and suffered injuries from which she never recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Radomski, [http://www.harmonicorde.com/Radomski%20Australian%20Voice.pdf "Manuel García (1805–1906): A bicentenary reflection"], ''Australian Voice'', Vol. 11, 2005, ({{pp.|25–41}}). Accessed 28 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; She refused to see a physician and continued to perform. In September 1836 Malibran was in [[Manchester]] participating in a music festival at the [[Manchester Cathedral|collegiate church]] and Theatre Royal on Fountain Street. She collapsed on stage while performing encores at the theatre, but insisted on performing in the church the following morning and died after a week of agony, attended by her private physician. Her body was temporarily buried in the church after a public funeral before being moved to a mausoleum in [[Laeken Cemetery]], near Brussels in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Shanks p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles and vocal style==
[[File:App0067.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Malibran's Hotel, Brussels,1899 – a town hall today&lt;/center&gt;]]

Malibran is most closely associated with the operas of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]. The composer extolled her virtues:
:Ah! That wonderful creature! With her disconcerting musical genius she surpassed all who sought to emulate her, and with her superior mind, her breadth of knowledge and unimaginable fieriness of temperament she outshone all other women I have known....&lt;ref&gt;Giachino Rossini, in Bartoli 2007, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other operas, she sang the title role in ''[[Tancredi]]'' and in ''[[Otello (Rossini)|Otello]]'', in which it appears that she sang both the roles of Desdemona and of Otello.&lt;ref name=MALI&gt;Letter from Carlo Severini to Éduard Robert (Co-Director of the Théâtre-Italien), 1829: "She will do three jobs for us...", in Bartoli, ''Maria'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Other appearances included those in ''[[Il turco in Italia]]'', ''[[La Cenerentola]]'', and ''[[Semiramide]]'' (both Arsace and the title role).&lt;ref name=MALI/&gt;

She also sang in [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]'s ''[[Il crociato in Egitto]]'' in Paris in September 1825, an opera which Rossini, as director of the Théâtre-Italien, introduced to the French capital and "which launched Meyerbeer's European reputation".&lt;ref&gt;Servadio 2003, ({{p.|127}})&lt;/ref&gt; Malibran enjoyed great success in [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]]'s operas ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'', ''[[La sonnambula]]'' and ''[[I Capuleti e i Montecchi]]'' (as Romeo). She also sang the Romeo role in two other then-famous operas: ''[[Giulietta e Romeo]]'' by [[Niccolò Antonio Zingarelli|Zingarelli]] and ''[[Giulietta e Romeo (Vaccai)|Giulietta e Romeo]]'' by [[Nicola Vaccai|Vaccai]]. Bellini wrote a new version of his ''[[I puritani]]'' to adapt it to her mezzo-soprano voice and even promised to write a new opera especially for her, but he died before he was able to do so.

Malibran's [[tessitura]] (comfortable [[vocal range]]) was remarkably wide, from G below [[middle C]] to high E (G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; – E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;),&lt;ref name="GSBMalibran"&gt;Saint Bris, pp. 37 and 104&lt;/ref&gt; and her extreme range extended from D3 to F6 in ''altissimo'',&lt;ref&gt;Riggs, pp. 137–141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashbrook, p. 634.&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed her easily to sing roles for contralto as well as high soprano. Her contemporaries admired Malibran's emotional intensity on stage. Rossini, Donizetti, [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], Mendelssohn and [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] were among her fans. The painter [[Eugène Delacroix]] however, accused her of lacking refinement and class and of trying to "appeal to the masses who have no artistic taste." Describing her voice and technique, French critic [[Castil-Blaze]] wrote, "Malibran's voice was vibrant, full of brightness and vigor. Without ever losing her flattering timbre, this velvet tone that has given her so much seduction in tender and passionate arias. [...] Vivacity, accuracy, ascending chromatics runs, [[arpeggio]]s, vocal lines dazzling with strength, grace or coquetry, she possessed all that the art can acquire."&lt;ref name="GSBMalibran"/&gt;

=== Maria Malibran fund ===
The Library of the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]] possesses an important collection of scores, documents and objects from the diva, assembled in the [[Maria Malibran fund]].

===Film===
Several films depict the life of Maria Malibran:
*''Maria Malibran'' (1943) directed by Italian director Guido Brignone and starring Moldovan-born Austrian soprano and actress [[Maria Cebotari]].&lt;ref name="IMDB"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035038/ IMBD page on the film]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[La Malibran]]'' (1944) directed by French director [[Sacha Guitry]] starring Géori Boué, celebrated singer of the [[Opéra de Paris]].&lt;ref name="IMDB"/&gt;
*''[[Malibran's Song]]'' (1951) a Spanish film directed by [[Luis Escobar Kirkpatrick]]
*''The Death of Maria Malibran'' (1971) directed by German filmmaker [[Werner Schroeter]]. It starred [[Candy Darling]].&lt;ref name="IMDB"/&gt;

===In other media===
In 1982, soprano [[Joan Sutherland]] did a recital tour called "Malibran" in order to revive Malibran's memory, singing pages from the singer's favourites in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|iOZv6ic5qHQ|Sutherland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mezzo-soprano [[Cecilia Bartoli]] dedicated her 2007 album ''Maria'' to the music composed for Malibran and her most famous roles, as well as an extensive tour and DVD concert dedicated to La Malibran. In 2008 Decca released a recording Bellini's ''La Sonnambula'' with Cecilia Bartoli in the lead role using many cadenzas that la Malibran herself used and which restored the tessitura of the role to the high mezzo-soprano range (as [[Giuditta Pasta]] and Maria Malibran had sung it).

She appears as a character in a poem by [[William McGonagall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGonagall|first=William|title=Little Pierre's Song|url=http://www.mcgonagall-online.org.uk/gems/little-pierres-song}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maternal fetal stress transfer''' describes the physiological phenomenon by which psychosocial stress experienced by a mother during her [[pregnancy]] can be transferred to the [[fetus]]. Psychosocial stress (or simply [[social stress]]) describes the brain's physiological response to perceived social threat. Because of a link in blood supply between a mother and fetus, it has been found that stress can leave lasting effects on a developing fetus, even before a child is born. According to recent studies, these effects are mainly the result of two particular stress biomarkers circulating in the maternal blood supply: [[cortisol]] and [[catecholamine]]s.

== Mechanism of action ==
[[Cortisol]] is type of hormone called a [[glucocorticoid]], which glucose usage in the body and tends to be activated during a fight-or-flight response. Cortisol is produced in the adrenal gland, whose activity is mediated by the hypothalamus and pituitary glands of the brain. Together, the collective signaling of the [[hypothalamus]], [[pituitary gland]], and [[adrenal gland]] is known as the [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis|hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis]]. During a period of psychosocial stress, cortisol is released, leading to physiological manifestations of stress such as increased maternal blood pressure (MBP) and maternal heart rate (MHR).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rakers|first1=Florian|last2=Bischoff|first2=Sabine|last3=Schiffner|first3=Rene|last4=Haase|first4=Michelle|last5=Rupprecht|first5=Sven|last6=Kiehntopf|first6=Michael|last7=Kühn-Velten|first7=W. Nikolaus|last8=Schubert|first8=Harald|last9=Witte|first9=Otto W.|last10=Nijland|first10=Mark J.|last11=Nathanielsz|first11=Peter W.|last12=Schwab|first12=Matthias|title=Role of catecholamines in maternal-fetal stress transfer in sheep|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=November 2015|volume=213|issue=5|pages=684.e1–684.e9|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2015.07.020|pmid=26212181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of a pregnant woman, the release of cortisol from the adrenal glands also has an effect on the fetus being carried in the womb. Cortisol is a [[steroid hormone]], and, like all steroid hormones, the receptors for cortisol are located intracellularly. In other words, cortisol does not need an extracellular receptor in order to enter the nucleus of cells and affect their gene expression. Because of this feature of steroid hormones, cortisol diffuses directly across the [[placenta]], the barrier that separates the fetus from the mother. Luckily, the fetus has a protective mechanism against the inundation of cortisol from a stressed mother. There is an enzyme in the placenta called 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 that is capable of inactivating the vast majority of the cortisol passing through the placental barrier to the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duthie|first1=Leanne|last2=Reynolds|first2=Rebecca M.|title=Changes in the Maternal Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis in Pregnancy and Postpartum: Influences on Maternal and Fetal Outcomes|journal=Neuroendocrinology|date=2013|volume=98|issue=2|pages=106–115|doi=10.1159/000354702|pmid=23969897|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/354702}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In cases of very high levels of maternal cortisol, this placental enzyme’s expression and activity are greatly reduced, thus buffering the fetus less from the mother’s high cortisol levels. There are detrimental effects to this loss of placental enzymatic activity. One such effect is a change in the set point for the HPA axis.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Myriad studies in animal models indicate that, if fetal cortisol levels are high, then the HPA axis will be more active postnatally.&lt;ref name="liy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Yong|last2=Gonzalez|first2=Pablo|last3=Zhang|first3=Lubo|title=Fetal stress and programming of hypoxic/ischemic-sensitive phenotype in the neonatal brain: Mechanisms and possible interventions|journal=Progress in Neurobiology|date=August 2012|volume=98|issue=2|pages=145–165|doi=10.1016/j.pneurobio.2012.05.010|pmc=3404248}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

High levels of fetal cortisol induce higher CRH expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) and the central nucleus of the amygdala.&lt;ref name="liy"/&gt; In other words, excessive cortisol crossing the placental barrier causes the hypothalamus and amygdala to increase transcription of CRH, which in turn stimulates HPA axis activity early in postnatal life. With such an overactive HPA axis, glucocorticoid receptor expression in the brain increases,&lt;ref name="liy"/&gt; making it so that the release of minimal levels of cortisol elicit a substantial response at developing synapses. It is speculated that the HPA axis will more rapidly develop its neural circuitry as a result.

'''Anoxic depolarization''' is a progressive and uncontrollable [[depolarization]] of [[neurons]] during [[stroke]] or [[brain ischemia]] in which there is an inadequate supply of blood to the [[Brain#Metabolism|brain]].&lt;ref name="Ionotropic receptors"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Weilinger NL, Maslieieva V, Bialecki J, Sridharan SS, Tang PL, Thompson RJ | title=Ionotropic receptors and ion channels in ischemic neuronal death and dysfunction | journal=Acta Pharmacol Sin | year= 2013 | volume= 34 | issue= 1 | pages= 39–48 | pmid=22864302 | doi=10.1038/aps.2012.95 | pmc= 4086487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anoxic depolarization is induced by the loss of neuronal selective [[membrane permeability]] and the ion gradients across the membrane that are needed to support neuronal activity.  Normally, the [[Na+/K+-ATPase]] pump maintains the [[Electrochemical gradient|transmembrane gradients]] of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, but with anoxic brain injury, the supply of energy to drive this pump is lost.&lt;ref name=Stys&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stys|first=P.|title=Anoxic and ischemic injury of myelinated axons in CNS white matter: from Mechanistic Concepts to Therapeutics|journal=Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism|year=1998|volume=18|pages=2–25|doi=10.1097/00004647-199801000-00002 |issue=1|pmid=9428302}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The hallmarks of anoxic depolarization are increased concentrations of [[extracellular]] K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, [[intracellular]] Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, and extracellular [[glutamate]] and [[aspartate]].  Glutamate and aspartate are normally present as the brain's primary excitatory [[neurotransmitter]]s, but high concentrations activate a number of downstream  [[apoptotic]] and [[necrotic]] [[signal transduction|pathways]].

E. |title=Neuroscience intelligence unit: The Brain Without Oxygen |year=1997 |edition=2nd |pages=1–207 |location=Austin, TX |publisher=Landes Bioscience and Chapman &amp; Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a neuron depolarizes due to Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion influx through the sodium channels,  the membrane reaches a [[threshold potential]] and then fires an [[all-or-none law|all or none]] [[action potential]], which either propagates down the [[axon]] or passes on to the other neurons via several [[gap junctions]] that link them.&lt;ref name=Purves /&gt;

[[File:SynapseSchematic en.svg|thumb|left|Illustration of a synapse]]

A chemical signal ([[synaptic transmission]]) begins with the action potential that propagates down the axon of so-called [[presynaptic terminal]] to trigger Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx, which causes the [[synaptic vesicles]] to fuse and release [[neurotransmitters]], via [[exocytosis]], to the [[synaptic cleft]].&lt;ref name="Lutz P" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Koch&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kochlamazashvili|first=G|author2=Haucke, V|title=A dual role of SNAP-25 as carrier and guardian of synaptic transmission|journal=EMBO Reports|year=2013|volume=14|pages=579–580|doi=10.1038/embor.2013.74|pmid=23732543|issue=7|pmc=3701241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released neurotransmitters then bind their specific [[neuroreceptors]] at the [[postsynaptic membrane]], or activate their specific [[ligand-gated ion channels]], to fire an action potential that can be either [[excitatory]] or [[inhibitory]], depending on the nature of the ligand-gated ion channel. Neurotransmitters are removed from the synaptic cleft by either enzymatic degradation or re-uptake by the same [[presynaptic neuron]], via [[endocytosis]] or specific [[neurotransmitter transporters]].&lt;ref name=Purves /&gt;

== Brain energy crisis ==

=== Stroke onset ===
Within a few seconds of stroke onset, the brain responds by entering a state of [[Metabolism|metabolic]] [[depression (physiology)|depression]], in which energy consumption is reduced to compensate for the reduction in energy production. Metabolic depression occurs as a result of suppressed synaptic transmission and [[hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]].

The suppression of synaptic transmission occurs because the presynaptic impulse temporarily fails to trigger the release of neurotransmitters, which, coupled with the altered ion conductance and a change in postsynaptic neuroreceptors, makes synapses unresponsive to neurotransmitter binding, thereby inhibiting postsynaptic excitation.&lt;ref name="Lutz P" /&gt;

Hyperpolarization, on the other hand, is employed to reduce neuronal activity by establishing a high threshold potential for firing across an action potential. This energy-conserving response is due to the continuous inward current of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, which help maintain the membrane [[ion gradient]] until the resistance is broken and anoxic depolarization begins.&lt;ref name="Lutz P" /&gt;

=== Imbalance in ion-homeostasis ===
Maintaining a balance between the intracellular and extracellular ionic concentrations at the postsynaptic terminal is critical to normal neuronal function. During oxygen depletion to the [[brain]], two events that initiate, as well as propagate, anoxic depolarization involve excessive cationic influxes, as well as the outflow of ATP, at the [[postsynaptic]] terminal.&lt;ref name="Ionotropic receptors" /&gt; The receptors that allow this influx and outflow are the [[ionotropic receptors]], which are ligand-gated ion channels that bind specific neurotransmitters, released from the synaptic vesicles of the presynaptic terminal, to trigger the opening of the channels, which serve as conduits for cations that, in turn, initiate action potential across the post synaptic terminals of normally functioning neurons.&lt;ref name=Goyal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goyal|first=R|author2=Chaudhury, A|title=Structure activity relationship of synaptic and junctional neurotransmission|journal=Autonomic Neuroscience: Basic and Clinical|year=2013|volume=176|pages=11–31|doi=10.1016/j.autneu.2013.02.012|pmid=23535140|issue=1–2|pmc=3677731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key player in the dramatic process of cationic influx is glutamate, an [[excitatory]] neurotransmitter that triggers [[excitotoxicity]] during anoxic depolarization.&lt;ref name=Madry&gt;{{cite journal|last=Madry|first=C|author2=Haglerød, C |author3=Attwell, D |title=The role of pannexin hemichannels in the anoxic depolarization of hippocampal pyramidal cells|journal=Brain|year=2010|volume=133|pages=3755–3763|doi=10.1093/brain/awq284|pmid=20940167|issue=Pt 12|pmc=2995884}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of ionotropic receptors have been identified as contributing to anoxic depolarization of [[nerve]] [[cell membrane]]s. They include the [[N-methyl-D-aspartate|NMDA receptors]], [[AMPA|AMPA receptors]], [[P2X7]] [[purinergic receptors]], [[pannexin]] channels (Panx1), [[transient receptor potential]] (TRP) channels, and [[acid-sensing ion channel]]s (ASICs).&lt;ref name="Ionotropic receptors" /&gt;

During brain ischemia, glutamate is released in excess from the presynaptic terminal, leading to the uncontrollable opening of the [[glutamate receptors]], including the NMDA and AMPA receptors, which allows for an excessive influx of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into the intracellular environment. Purinergic and NMDA receptors activate the pannexin-1 channels, which become hyperactive and allow the release of ATP from the intracellular environment. As the extracellular glutamate and ATP increase, several complexes are activated and converge into apoptotic and necrotic cascade pathways, which cause neuronal damage and death.&lt;ref name="Ionotropic receptors" /&gt;

=== Post-anoxic depolarization: downstream neuronal damage  ===
[[File:Low Ca2+ buffering and excitotoxicity under physiological stress and pathophysiological conditions in motor neuron (MNs).jpg|thumb|left|Low Ca2+ buffering and excitotoxicity under physiological stress and pathophysiological conditions in motor neuron (MNs)]]

In the aftermath of anoxic depolarization, at the region of [[infarction]], the release of glutamate and aspartate into the [[extracellular space]] causes an uncontrollable intracellular mobilization of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, mainly through the NMDA receptors.&lt;ref name=Zhao&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhao|first=H|author2=Steinberg, G. |author3=Sapolsky, R |title=General versus specific actions of mild-moderate hypothermia in attenuating cerebral ischemic damage|journal=Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism|year=2007|volume=27|pages=1879–1894|doi=10.1038/sj.jcbfm.9600540|issue=12|pmid=17684517}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a critical stage in the development of neuronal damage, because it is the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; overload that gives rise to several downstream cascades of events that lead to necrotic neuronal death, or to apoptosis, including [[free radical]] and [[nitric oxide]] productions that cause damage to the membrane.&lt;ref name=Huang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huang|first=B|author2=Castillo, M|title=Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury: imaging findings from birth to adulthood|journal=Radiographics|year=2008|volume=28|pages=417–439|doi=10.1148/rg.282075066|issue=2|pmid=18349449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another [[cytotoxic]] event that follows anoxic depolarization is [[Lactic acid|lactate]] accumulation and [[acidosis]] as a result of glycolysis, which causes damage to the [[mitochondria]].&lt;ref name=Huang /&gt; Ischemic insult also causes [[blood-brain barrier]] disruption.&lt;ref name=Zhao /&gt; Other consequential damage that occurs includes [[lipolysis]], [[proteolysis]], cell swelling, [[microtubule]] disaggregation, and [[Deoxyribonucleic acid|DNA]] fragmentation.&lt;ref name="Lutz P" /&gt;

== Selective vulnerability ==
Neurons are more susceptible to brain ischemia than the supporting [[glial cells]], because neurons have higher energy demand, conduct an action potential, and produce glutamate, whereas glial cells lack those properties. Yet neurons differ among themselves in their sensitivity to [[ischemia]], depending on the specific properties they exhibit, relating to their locations in the brain.&lt;ref name=Aga&gt;{{cite web|last=Agamanolis|first=D|title=Chapter 2: Cerebral Ischemia and Stroke|url=http://neuropathology-web.org/chapter2/chapter2aHIE.html|website=Neuropathology|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Selective vulnerability'' is the term used to describe how some parts of the brain are more sensitive to [[Cerebral hypoxia|anoxia]] than others, and thus to [[ischemic]] [[insult (medical)|insult]].&lt;ref name=Huang /&gt; Anoxia-prone cells in the brain include the [[hippocampal]] [[pyramidal cells]] of [[Cornu Ammonis area 1#Hippocampus proper|CA1]], [[cerebellar]] [[purkinje cells]], pyramidal [[neocortical]] neurons in some layers, [[basal ganglia]], [[thalamic reticular nucleus|reticular neurons]] of the [[thalamus]], and [[brainstem]] neurons.&lt;ref name=Busl&gt;{{cite journal|last=Busl|first=K|author2=Greer, D|title=Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury: pathophysiology, neuropathology and mechanisms|journal=Neurorehabilitation|year=2010|volume=26|pages=5–13|doi=10.3233/NRE-2010-0531|issue=1|pmid=20130351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While basal ganglia, cerebellar purkinje cells, hippocampal, and neocortical cells are more vulnerable to [[transient ischemic attack]] (TIA), brainstem and thalamic reticular neurons are more vulnerable to prolonged ischemic attack (stroke proper).&lt;ref name=Aga /&gt; Meanwhile, the hippocampal pyramidal cells have been identified as the most vulnerable cells to ischemia.&lt;ref name=Busl /&gt; One possible explanation for why selective vulnerability exists attributes the phenomenon to the different amounts of glutamate produced by different neurons, since it is glutamate release to the synaptic cleft that triggers Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx, which in turn triggers biochemical processes that damage the neurons.&lt;ref name=Aga /&gt; In other research, variation in the expression of [[immediate early gene]] and [[heat shock protein]] was identified as causing selective vulnerability.&lt;ref name=Busl /&gt;

== Anoxic-tolerance mechanisms ==

=== Metabolic depression ===
The [[painted turtle]] (''Chrysemys picta'') uses the mechanism of metabolic depression to combat oxygen depletion.&lt;ref name=LP&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lutz|first=P. L|title=Mechanisms for Anoxic Survival in the Vertebrate Brain|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|year=1992|volume=54|pages=601–618|doi=10.1146/annurev.ph.54.030192.003125|pmid=1348613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few minutes of anoxia onset in the turtle's brain there is decreased cerebral blood flow that eventually ceases. Meanwhile, [[glycolysis]] is stimulated to maintain a near optimum [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production.&lt;ref name=Nilsson /&gt; This compensatory stimulation of glycolysis occurs because, in the turtle's brain, [[cytochrome]] a and a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; have a low affinity for oxygen.&lt;ref name=LP /&gt; [[Glycolysis#Anaerobic glycolysis|Anaerobic glycolysis]] leads to lactate overload, which the turtle buffers to some extent by increased shell and bone CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production.&lt;ref name=Nilsson /&gt;

However, glycolysis is not efficient for ATP production, and in order to maintain an optimum ATP concentration, the turtle's brain reduces its ATP consumption by suppressing its neuronal activity and gradually releasing [[adenosine]]. This re-establishes the ATP consumption/production balance, which is then maintained by reducing ion conductance and releasing [[gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA]]. The decrease in neuronal activity renders the turtle comatose for the duration of anoxia.&lt;ref name=John&gt;{{cite book|title=Innate Tolerance in the CNS: Translational Neuroprotection by Pre- and Post-Conditioning|year=2013|publisher=Springer New York|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-9694-7|pages=19–35|author=John W. Thompson|author2=Göran E. Nilsson |author3=Miguel A. Perez-Pinzon |editor=Jeffrey M. Gidday |editor2=Miguel A. Perez-Pinzon |editor3=John H. Zhang|chapter=2: Anoxia Resistance in Lower and Higher Vertebrates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pasteur effect ===
Another [[Hypoxia (environmental)#Aquatic hypoxia|anoxia-tolerant]] animal that is commonly used as a model to study anoxia in the mammalian brain is the [[crucian carp]], which can survive at even more extreme anoxic conditions than the painted turtle can. Unlike ''C. picta'', which takes such drastic measures in becoming comatose to maintain an optimum ATP concentration, the crucian carp does not become comatose in anoxia. Instead, it stays active by maintaining its normal [[Heart#In fish|cardial output]] as well as increasing its cerebral blood flow.&lt;ref name="Lutz P" /&gt; Even though glycolysis is stimulated early in anoxia in both the crucian carp and ''C. picta'', the crucian carp is able to stay active because of its capability to re-route the glycolytic pathway such that lactate is converted into [[ethanol]], which can then be released into the water via the [[gills]], thus preventing lactate overload and acidosis.&lt;ref name=Nilsson /&gt;

Since the crucian carp has a more efficient strategy to prevent lactate buildup than ''C. picta'', the initial glycolysis continues without ceasing, a process called the [[Pasteur effect]].&lt;ref name=John /&gt; In order to keep up with this fast glucose metabolism via glycolysis, as well as maintain the balance between ATP production and consumption, the crucian carp moderately suppresses its motor activities, releases GABA, and selectively suppresses some unnecessary sensory functions.&lt;ref name=John /&gt; Crucian carp also counteracts the damaging effects of anoxia by swimming into cooler water, a phenomenon known as ''voluntary hypothermia''.&lt;ref name=Nilsson /&gt;

=== Tolerance in mammalian neonates ===
The brains of several mammalian neonates have been identified as able to confer resistance to anoxia in a fashion similar to that of the anoxic-tolerant aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name=LP /&gt; This is still a relatively new area of study that could have a clinical significance in combating stroke in humans. A study that looked into anoxic-tolerance in newborn mammals identified two main ways in which they cope with acute [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. While most newborns, preferentially, depress their metabolic rate to conserve energy during anoxia, some mammalian newborns—such as the pig, the deer, and other animals in their class, which are capable of a high degree of independent activity from birth—employ [[hyperpnoea]] (abnormally rapid or deep breathing).&lt;ref name=Mortola&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mortola|first=J|title=How newborn mammals cope with hypoxia|journal=Respiration Physiology|year=1999|volume=116|pages=95–103|doi=10.1016/S0034-5687(99)00038-9|issue=2–3|pmid=10487295}}&lt;/ref&gt; Why metabolic depression is less effective in adult mammals, compared to neonates, is unclear at the moment. Due to ethical issues, anoxic-tolerance has not been tested in human neonates.

== Research: neuroprotective agents ==
[[File:NMDA receptor activation and antagonists.PNG|thumb|right|NMDA receptor activation and antagonists]]

Currently, there is no effective way to combat stroke. The only FDA-[[approved drug]] to treat stroke is a [[Thrombus#Treatment|clot-dissolving]], [[Genetic engineering|genetically-engineered]] [[enzyme]] called [[tissue plasminogen activator]], which must be administered within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms, in order to be effective in reducing damage following [[ischemic stroke]].&lt;ref name=Behensky&gt;{{cite journal|last=Behensky|first=A|author2=Cortes-Salva, M. |author3=Seminerio, M. |author4=Matsumoto, R. |author5=Antilla, J. |author6=Cuevas, J. |title=In vitro evaluation of guanidine analogs as sigma receptor ligands for potential anti-stroke therapeutics|journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics|year=2013|volume=344|pages=155–166|doi=10.1124/jpet.112.199513|pmid=23065135|issue=1|pmc=3533416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[clinical trials]] have failed in an attempt to develop effective [[Neuroprotection|neuroprotective drugs]] to combat stroke, perhaps because those drugs only deal with one aspect of stroke, and therefore neglect the fact that stroke is a multifaceted problem. Some of the potential treatments for stroke that have been tested by a number of researchers, using several animal models, involve [[sigma-1 receptor]] [[ligands]], to modulate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release, [[NMDA receptor antagonists]], to prevent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; overload, and [[Channel blocker|ion channel blockers]], to prevent excessive ion fluxes.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

[[File:Michael J. Kennedy (New York Congressman) 2.jpg|thumb|Michael J. Kennedy, New York Congressman.]]
'''Michael Joseph Kennedy''' (October 25, 1897 – November 1, 1949) was an [[United States|American]] businessman and politician. He was a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from the state of [[New York State|New York]] from 1939 to 1943.

==Biography==
Kennedy was born in [[New York City]] in 1897 and attended Sacred Heart Parochial School before becoming a clerk for the [[New York City Board of Elections]] in 1921. He was appointed a [[New York City Marshal]] in 1923 and served until 1938, when he became active in the [[insurance]] business.

Kennedy was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1938 as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and reelected in 1940. He served from January, 1939 to January, 1943 (the [[76th United States Congress|76th]] and [[77th United States Congress|77th]] Congresses). He was not a candidate for reelection in 1942, and returned to the insurance business. Kennedy had been active in the [[Tammany Hall]] organization, and was the organization's leader from 1942 to 1944.

On November 1, 1949, Kennedy was killed in the crash of [[Eastern Airlines Flight 537]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] His remains were interred at the [[Gate of Heaven Cemetery (Hawthorne, New York)|Gate of Heaven Cemetery]] in [[Hawthorne, New York]].

==Family==
In 1928, Kennedy married Sally Fischer, who had been his secretary in the city marshal's office.{{sfn|"Kennedy Named Tammany Head"|page=2}}

'''Oskar Baudisch''' (3 June 1881 &amp;ndash; 29 March 1950) was an [[Austrian American]] [[biochemist]] and [[Radiologic technologist|radiographer]]. He is mainly known for a [[chemical reaction]] that bears his name, the [[Baudisch reaction]].

==Early life and education==
Baudisch was born to Joseph and Julie Baudisch in Maffersdorf, Austria, which is today [[Vratislavice nad Nisou]], now part of the [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref name="web"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.maffersdorf.de/chronik/band_04-1/maffersdorf_menschen-und-schicksale_04-1_14.htm | title = Prof. Dr. Oskar Baudisch - Ein Biochemiker | publisher = maffersdorf.de | first = Inge | last = Schwarz    | year =1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mikro"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feigl | first1 = Fritz | title = Oskar Baudisch | journal = Mikrochemie Vereinigt mit Mikrochimica Acta | volume = 36–37 | pages = 33–37 | year = 1951 | doi = 10.1007/BF01427419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received his first education in chemistry at the Staatsgewerbeschule in [[Liberec|Reichenberg]]. Since this kind of school was not sufficient to be allowed to start a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph. D.]] thesis in Austria, he went abroad. Baudisch studied chemistry in [[Zurich]], where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1904.&lt;ref name="web"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mikro"/&gt;

==Career in Europe==
After a year of military service in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], he worked for his former chemistry teacher, [[Ferdinand Breinl]], in [[Liberec|Reichenberg]]. There he published a paper on the oxidation of proteins by [[hydrogen peroxide]]. He then joined the group of [[Eugen Bamberger]] at the [[University of Zurich]] as a private assistant.&lt;ref name="web"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mikro"/&gt;

In 1907 he joined the [[University of Manchester]] where he worked with [[William Henry Perkin, Jr.]]. During this time he published his work on [[Cupferron]], a [[complex (chemistry)|complexation]] agent later used for the quantitative analysis of copper and iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lundell | first1 = G.

In 1911, he worked with [[Alfred Werner]] in Zurich, and obtained his [[habilitation]].&lt;ref name="web"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mikro"/&gt;

Just before the outbreak of World War I, he became director of the Strahlenforschungsinstitut (radiation research institute) in [[Hamburg]]. During the war, Baudisch served in the Austria-Hungary army in the fields of medicine and [[epidemic control]]. After the war he joined the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] for Physics in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name="web"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mikro"/&gt;

==In America==
In 1920, he went to [[Yale University]], where he was professor of photochemistry for two years. He then worked at the [[Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research]] where he concentrated his research on trace minerals in soil and water. In 1933 he was asked to head the New York State Institute of Balneology and Hydrotherapy at [[Saratoga Springs, New York]].&lt;ref name="chemical"/&gt; During his time at this institute he also worked on the impact of trace minerals in water on health.&lt;ref name="web"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mikro"/&gt;

===Baudisch reaction===
In 1939 Baudisch discovered a reaction in an aqueous mixture of  [[hydroxylamine hydrochloride]] and [[benzene]] or [[phenol]] to give ''o''-nitrosophenols. The reaction needs [[copper(II)]] as catalyst. This reaction is today known as the [[Baudisch reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Oskar Baudisch | title = A New Chemical Reaction With The Nitrosyl Radical NOH | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 92 | issue = 2389 | pages = 336–7  | year = 1940 | doi = 10.1126/science.92.2389.336|bibcode = 1940Sci....92..336B | pmid=17783392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Baudisch drowned on 28 March 1950 near [[La Jolla, California]] in a boating accident.&lt;ref name="web"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mikro"/&gt; He had been working on a research project on trace elements in the sea for the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], La Jolla.&lt;ref name = "chemical"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/cen-v028n017.p1413 | title = Oscar Baudisch | date = 24 April 1950 | pages = 1413 | issue = 17 | volume = 28 | journal = [[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]|publisher=[[American Chemical Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10486">'''Pam Reynolds Lowery''' (1956 – May 22, 2010), from [[Atlanta, Georgia]], was an American singer-songwriter.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{citation|author=J.E. Geshwiler |url=http://www.ajc.com/news/pam-reynolds-lowery-noted-537512.html|title=Pam Reynolds Lowery, noted for near-death episode|publisher=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=May 28, 2010|accessdate=July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, at the age of 35, she stated that she had a [[near-death experience]] (NDE) during a brain operation performed by [[Robert F. Spetzler]] at the [[Barrow Neurological Institute]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. Her experience is one of the most widely documented in [[near-death studies]] because of the circumstances under which it happened. Reynolds was under close medical monitoring during the entire operation. During part of the operation she had no brain-wave activity and no blood flowing in her brain, which rendered her [[clinical death|clinically dead]]. She claimed to have made several observations during the procedure which later medical personnel reported to be accurate.

This near-death experience claim has been considered by some to be evidence of the survival of consciousness after death, and of a life after death. However, others have pointed to prosaic and conventional means as possible explanations.&lt;ref name="French 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author=French, Chris |title=Near-Death Experiences in Cardiac Arrest Survivors|journal=[[Progress in Brain Research]]|pages=150: 351–367.|pmid=16186035|doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(05)50025-6|volume=150|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds died from heart failure, on Saturday May 22, 2010, age 53 at [[Emory University Hospital]], in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].

==Diagnosis and operation==
Pam Reynolds reported to her physician that she was experiencing symptoms of [[dizziness]], [[aphasia|loss of speech]] and [[paralysis|difficulty in moving]] parts of her body. Her physician referred her to a neurologist and a [[CAT scan]] later revealed that Reynolds had a large [[aneurysm]] in her brain, close to the [[brain stem]]. Because of the difficult position of the aneurysm, Reynolds was predicted to have no chance of surviving surgery for its removal. As a last resort, [[Robert F. Spetzler]] &amp;mdash; a neurosurgeon of the [[Barrow Neurological Institute]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] &amp;mdash; decided that a rarely performed procedure, known as [[standstill operation|hypothermic cardiac arrest]], could improve Reynolds's chances of surviving surgical removal of the aneurysm. During this procedure, also known as a [[standstill operation]], Reynolds's body temperature was lowered to 50&amp;nbsp;°F (10&amp;nbsp;°C), her breathing and heartbeat stopped, and the blood drained from her head. Her eyes were closed with tape and small ear plugs with speakers were placed in her ears. These speakers emitted audible clicks which were used to check the function of the brain stem to ensure that she had a flat [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] &amp;mdash; or a non-responsive brain &amp;mdash; before the operation proceeded. The operation was a success and Reynolds recovered completely. The total surgery lasted about seven hours with a few complications along the way.

==Claimed NDE==
Reynolds reported that during the operation she heard a sound like a [[natural sign|natural]] 'D' that seemed to pull her out of her body and allowed her to "float" above the operating room and watch the doctors perform the operation. Reynolds claims that during this time she felt "more aware than normal" and her vision was more focused and clearer than normal vision. She reported seeing the surgical "saw" but said it looked like an [[electric toothbrush]], and this is in fact true. She said she could hear conversations between operating room staff, even though she had [[Headphones#Earphones|earphones]] in her ears which were making a loud clicking noise many times per second in order to monitor her brain function.&lt;ref name="KellyKelly2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edward F. Kelly|author2=Emily Williams Kelly|author3=Adam Crabtree|author4=Alan Gauld|author5=Michael Grosso|author6=Bruce Greyson|title=Irreducible Mind: Toward a Psychology for the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2oV61CeDx-YC|accessdate=29 July 2013|year=2007|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-4792-6|pages=392-393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point during the operation, she says she noticed a presence and was pulled towards a light. (Cardiologist [[Michael Sabom]] in his book ''Light and Death'' says that this occurred during a period in which her brain had completely ceased to function,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michael Sabom|title=Light and Death: One Doctor's Fascinating Account of Near-Death Experiences|isbn=0-310-21992-2|pages=43, 49|date=1998|publisher=Zondervan|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=xqAg4b71NLsC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=0310219922&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q=Pam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is not clear that it occurred during this period.) She says she began to discern figures in the light, including her grandmother, an uncle, other deceased relatives and people unknown to her. According to Reynolds, the longer she was there, the more she enjoyed it, but at some point she was reminded that she had to go back. She says her uncle brought her back to her body, but she didn't want to go, so he pushed her in accompanied by a sensation like that of jumping into ice water.&lt;ref name=obit /&gt;

==Reception==
Reynolds' [[Near-death experience#Afterlife claims|near-death experience]] has been put forward as evidence supporting an [[afterlife]] by proponents such as cardiologist [[Michael Sabom]] in his book ''Light and Death''. Critics say that the amount of time which Reynolds was 'flatlined' is generally misrepresented and suggest that her NDE occurred while under [[general anaesthesia]] when the brain was still active, hours before Reynolds underwent hypothermic cardiac arrest.&lt;ref name="Miller2012"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Neuroimaging and Spiritual Practice|first=Mario|last=Beauregard|editor-first=Lisa J. |editor-last=Miller|title=The Oxford Handbook of Psychology and Spirituality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GcJpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA509|date=6 July 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-997864-9|pages=509–510}}{{Request quotation|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Keith Augustine |year=2007 |title=Does paranormal perception occur in near-death experiences? |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc799110/m2/1/high_res_d/vol25-no4-203.pdf |journal=[[Journal of Near-Death Studies]] |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=203–236, pages 217-218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Robert Todd|title=The Skeptic's Dictionary|url=http://www.skepdic.com/nde.html|website=www.skepdic.com|publisher=Robert Todd Carroll|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anesthesiologist Gerald Woerlee analyzed the case, and concluded that Reynolds' ability to perceive events during her surgery was the result of "anesthesia awareness".&lt;ref name="Thompson2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Evan Thompson|title=Waking, Dreaming, Being: Self and Consciousness in Neuroscience, Meditation, and Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_vpBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT371|date=11 November 2014|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-53831-2|pages=371–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the psychologist [[Chris French]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Woerlee, an anesthesiologist with many years of clinical experience, has considered this case in detail and remains unconvinced of the need for a paranormal explanation... [He] draws attention to the fact that Reynolds could only give a report of her experience some time after she recovered from the anesthetic as she was still intubated when she regained consciousness. This would provide some opportunity for her to associate and elaborate upon the sensations she had experienced during the operation with her existing knowledge and expectations. The fact that she described the small pneumatic saw used in the operation also does not impress Woerlee. As he points out, the saw sounds like and, to some extent, looks like the pneumatic drills used by dentists.&lt;ref name="French 2005"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Passive leg raise''', also known as '''shock position''', is a treatment for [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] or a test to evaluate the need for further [[fluid resuscitation]] in [[Intensive care medicine|critically ill]]person.&lt;ref name="pmid18214429"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Monnet X, Teboul JL |title=Passive leg raising|journal=Intensive Care Med |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=659–63 |date=April 2008 |pmid=18214429|doi=10.1007/s00134-008-0994-y |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This test involves raising the legs of a person's (without their active participation), which causes [[gravity]] to pull [[blood]] from the legs, thus increasing [[Volume status|circulatory volume]] available to the [[heart]] ([[Preload (cardiology)|cardiac preload]]) by around 150-300 [[milliliter]]s, depending on the amount of venous reservoir.&lt;ref name="pmid18214429"/&gt; The real-time effects of this maneuver on [[hemodynamic]] parameters such as [[blood pressure]] and [[heart rate]] are used to guide the decision whether or not more fluid will be beneficial.&lt;ref name="pmid11948060"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boulain T, Achard JM, Teboul JL, Richard C, Perrotin D, Ginies G |title=Changes in BP induced by passive leg raising predict response to fluid loading in critically ill patients |journal=Chest |volume=121 |issue=4 |pages=1245–52 |date=April 2002 |pmid=11948060 |doi= 10.1378/chest.121.4.1245|url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11948060}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17508202"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maizel J, Airapetian N, Lorne E, Tribouilloy C, Massy Z, Slama M|title=Diagnosis of central hypovolemia by using passive leg raising |journal=Intensive Care Med |volume=33|issue=7 |pages=1133–8 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17508202 |doi=10.1007/s00134-007-0642-y |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assessment is easier when [[Invasive (medical)|invasive]] monitoring is present (such as an [[arterial catheter]]).

The maneuver might be reinforced in a clinical setting by moving the patient's bed from a semi-recumbent position to a recumbent position with the legs raised. This is theorised to cause an additional mobilisation of blood from the [[splanchnic circulation|gastrointestinal circulation]].&lt;ref name="pmid18795254"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Jabot J, Teboul JL, Richard C, Monnet X |title=Passive leg raising for predicting fluid responsiveness: importance of the postural change |journal=Intensive Care Med |volume= 35|issue= 1|pages= 85–90|date=September 2008 |pmid=18795254 |doi=10.1007/s00134-008-1293-3 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18467896"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Teboul JL, Monnet X |title=Prediction of volume responsiveness in critically ill patients with spontaneous breathing activity |journal=Curr Opin Crit Care |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=334–9 |date=June 2008|pmid=18467896 |doi=10.1097/MCC.0b013e3282fd6e1e |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Direct measurement of cardiac output is the more reliable comparing to the measurement of blood pressure or pulse pressure because of pulse pressure amplification during this procedure. Cardiac output can be measured by arterial pulse contour analysis, echocardiography, esophageal Doppler, or contour analysis of the volume clamp-derived arterial pressure. Any bronchial secretions must be aspirated before performing this test. The legs should not be elevated manually because it may provoke pain, discomfort, or awakening that can cause adrenergic stimulation, giving false readings of cardiac output by increasing heart rate. After the maneuver, the bed should be placed back into semi-recumbent position with cardiac output measured again.  The cardiac output should return to the values measured before the initiation of this maneuver. This test can be can used to access fluid responsiveness without any fluid challenge, where the latter can lead to fluid overload.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xavier|first1=Monnet|title=Passive leg raising: five rules, not a drop of fluid!|journal=Critical Care|date=14 January 2015|volume=19|issue=18|page=237|doi=10.1186/s13054-014-0708-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compression stockings should be removed before the test so that adequate volume of blood will return to the right heart during the maneuver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacob Chakco|first1=Cyril|last2=P Wise|first2=Matt|last3=J Frost|first3=Paul|title=Passive leg raising and compression stockings: a note of caution|journal=Critical Care|date=1 June 2015|volume=19|issue=237|doi=10.1186/s13054-015-0955-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physiology of assessing fluid responsiveness via passive leg raise requires increasing systemic venous return without altering cardiac function - a form of functional hemodynamic monitoring.&lt;ref name=MMT&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Monnet|first1=X|last2=Marik|first2=PE|last3=Teboul|first3=JL|title=Prediction of fluid responsiveness: an update.|journal=Annals of intensive care|date=December 2016|volume=6|issue=1|pages=111|doi=10.1186/s13613-016-0216-7|pmid=27858374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[neuroscience]], a '''population vector''' is the sum of the preferred directions of a population of [[neuron]]s, weighted by the respective spike counts.

The formula for computing the (normalized) population vector, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, takes the following form:

&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{\sum_j m_j F_j}{\sum_j m_j}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;m_j&lt;/math&gt; is the activity of cell &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;F_j&lt;/math&gt; is the preferred input for cell &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the vector &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; encodes the input direction, &lt;math&gt;F_j&lt;/math&gt;, in terms of the activation of a population of neurons.

'''Reggie Lewis''' (November 21, 1965 – July 27, 1993) was an American professional [[basketball]] player for the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Boston Celtics]] from [[1987–88 NBA season|1987]] to [[1992–93 NBA season|1993]].

==Biography==

===Personal life===
Born in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], Lewis attended high school at Dunbar High School, where he played basketball alongside NBA players [[Muggsy Bogues]], [[David Wingate (basketball)|David Wingate]], and [[Reggie Williams (basketball, born 1964)|Reggie Williams]]. The 1981–82 Dunbar Poets finished the season at 29-0 during Lewis' junior season and finished 31-0 during his senior season, and were ranked first in the nation by USA Today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|deadurl=no|url=http://slamonline.com/online/high-school/2007/09/dunbar-high-brick-house/|title=Dunbar High: Brick House|publisher=SLAM Online|date=September 21, 2007|accessdate=December 9, 2008|archivedate=June 3, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603025147/http://slamonline.com/online/high-school/2007/09/dunbar-high-brick-house/|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis attended [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]] in [[Boston]]. Over his four years at Northeastern, Lewis scored 2,708 points, still the all-time record at the university. His Northeastern teams won the [[ECAC North]] in each of his four seasons, and played in the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament every year. The 1983–84 Huskies advanced to the second round of the [[1984 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], falling one point shy of the Sweet 16 when Rolando Lamb scored at the buzzer to lift [[Virginia Commonwealth University|VCU]] over the Huskies.

His uniform number was retired and hangs in tribute in [[Matthews Arena]] (the home of Northeastern University's men's basketball team and the Celtics' original home arena in 1946). As a Celtic, he and his family lived in [[Dedham, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://articles.philly.com/1993-07-29/sports/25978291_1_gilbert-mudge-waltham-weston-hospital-reggie-lewis | title = The Reggie Lewis Aftermath Boston Mourns, Puzzles And Opines Over Celtics Star's Death | date = July 29, 1993 | first = Gwen | last = Knapp | newspaper = Philadelphia Inquirer | accessdate = May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a second cousin of current [[Boston Celtics]] player [[P. J. Dozier]], who wore the jersey number 35 as a member of the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] in honor of Lewis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Doxy |first1=Andrew |title=Celtics sign PJ Dozier to a two-way contract |url=https://www.celticsblog.com/2018/8/3/17648526/celtics-sign-pj-dozier-to-a-two-way-contract |website=CelticsBlog |accessdate=August 5, 2018 |date=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boston Celtics===
Lewis was drafted in the first round, 22nd overall, by the Boston Celtics in the [[1987 NBA draft]]. The Celtics were looking to add some youth to the team, especially for the aging "Big 3" of [[Larry Bird]], [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]], and [[Robert Parish]]. This need became more urgent after [[Len Bias]], the 2nd overall pick in the [[1986 NBA draft]], died of a [[cocaine]] overdose.

As a rookie, Lewis played sporadically, averaging only 8.3 minutes per game under coach [[K.C. Jones]]. By his second season, thanks in part to a [[Jimmy Rodgers (basketball)|new coach]] (and an injury to Celtics star [[Larry Bird]]) Lewis averaged over 30 minutes per game and scored 18.5 points per game. Lewis was selected to play in his first and only [[1992 NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star Game]] held in [[Orlando, Florida]], [[1991–92 NBA season|1992]]. He played 15 minutes, scoring 7 points and grabbing 4 rebounds.

He averaged 20.8 points per game in each of his last two seasons with the Celtics, and finished with a career average of 17.6 points per contest.

His #35 jersey was retired by the Celtics as a memorial to him, making him one of only two Celtics to have a retired number without winning a championship. The other was [[Ed Macauley]], who did win a championship with the [[St. Louis Hawks]] in 1958 and is a member of the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]].

===Death and legacy===
Lewis suffered [[sudden cardiac death]] on the basketball court at an off-season practice on July 27, 1993, at [[Brandeis University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]]. He was 27 years old. Lewis had shown symptoms of heart problems in the preceding months (including collapsing during the opening game&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxO8koWxZMQ|title=Reggie Lewis collapsed during the match with Charlotte|time=4:06|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Celtics' [[1993 NBA Playoffs|first-round playoff series]] with the [[Charlotte Hornets]]), and the cause of his death was subsequently attributed to [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]], a structural heart defect that is considered the most common cause of death in young athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Christine Gorman|title=Did Reggie Lewis Have to Die?|date=August 9, 1993|accessdate=May 22, 2010|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979014,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/preps/2008-05-22-lewis-screening_N.htm |work=[[USA Today]]|title=Young athletes urged to get screened for heart trouble|first=Jim|last=Halley|date=May 22, 2008|accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Crowley (police officer)|James Crowley]], a Brandeis University police officer who happened upon the gym on a routine patrol, and another Brandeis University police officer attempted to revive Lewis by using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but they were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Officer Defends Arrest of Harvard Professor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/24/us/24cambridge.html?pagewanted=all|date=July 23, 2009|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|first=Liz|last=Robbins|accessdate=June 3, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603025147/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/24/us/24cambridge.html?pagewanted=all|archivedate=June 3, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Lewis' death, it was alleged that Lewis had used cocaine, and that drug use may have been a contributing factor in his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press|AP]]|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950309&amp;slug=2109213|title=Report: Doctors Suspected That Cocaine Killed Celtics' Lewis|date=March 9, 1995|archivedate=September 26, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926175512/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950309&amp;slug=2109213|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=3514|author=Alicia C.

The ''Journal'' added the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whether Mr. Lewis died from a heart damaged by cocaine -- as many doctors suspected then and now -- cannot be definitively shown. What is evident: The official cause of death, a heart damaged by a common-cold virus, is a medically nonsensical finding by a coroner who was under intense pressure from the Lewis family to exclude any implication of drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=March 9, 1995|url=http://www.ronsuskind.com/articles/000038.html|last=Suskind|first=Ron|title=Deadly Silence: How the Inner Circles, Of Medicine and Sports, Failed a Stricken Star|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=February 15, 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104122043/http://www.ronsuskind.com/articles/000038.html|archivedate=January 4, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Boston Celtics responded by expressing sadness about the "vicious attack on Reggie Lewis and his family", and threatened "to file a $100 million lawsuit against the reporter, ''The Wall Street Journal'' and its parent company, Dow Jones and Co. Inc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Report: Doctors Suspected That Cocaine Killed Celtics' Lewis|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950309&amp;slug=2109213|newspaper=The Seattle Times|agency=AP|date=March 9, 1995|accessdate=November 26, 2012|archivedate=September 26, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926175512/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950309&amp;slug=2109213|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Gilbert Mudge, a doctor who treated Lewis, was sued for malpractice in connection with Lewis' death; in written responses to questions from the attorneys for Donna Harris-Lewis, Mudge said that "16 days before Lewis collapsed from a heart attack in 1993, he acknowledged having used cocaine, but said he had stopped."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Report: Doctors Suspected That Cocaine Killed Celtics' Lewis|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doctor-knew-lewis-used-cocaine/|work=CBS News|date=February 5, 1999|accessdate=February 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the doctor who performed the autopsy on Lewis testified that the [[scarring]] on his heart was inconsistent with cocaine use, and other doctors reached the same conclusion though they "stopped short of saying he never used drugs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No signs of drug use|date=May 17, 1999|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/news/1999/05/17/lewis_doctors/|agency=[[CNN]]|archivedate=June 3, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603025147/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/news/1999/05/17/lewis_doctors/|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=March 29, 1995|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-29/sports/sp-48268_1_reggie-lewis|title=Doctors: Drugs Did Not Kill Reggie Lewis|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603025147/http://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-29/sports/sp-48268_1_reggie-lewis|archivedate=June 3, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Lewis's heart tissue tested positive for adenovirus during his autopsy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ronsuskind.com/articles/000038.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104122043/http://www.ronsuskind.com/articles/000038.html|date=January 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his son has a heart condition very similar to his father's.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

After Lewis' death, the [[Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center]] was opened in [[Roxbury, Boston]]. The center was funded partially by Lewis and routinely hosts major indoor track and field competitions, the [[Boston Indoor Games]], home basketball games for Roxbury Community College, and [[Northeastern University]] track and field events.

On March 22, 1995, the [[Boston Celtics]] retired Lewis' jersey. Lewis had worn the number 35 for his entire career. During the ceremony, former teammate [[Dee Brown (basketball, born 1968)|Dee Brown]] made a speech while two other former teammates, [[Sherman Douglas]] and [[Xavier McDaniel]], held up Lewis' framed jersey. Lewis' contract remained on the Celtics' salary cap for two full seasons after his death because at the time the NBA did not have a provision to void contracts in the event an active player died; NBA Commissioner [[David Stern]] said that the remaining NBA teams should approve an exemption for Lewis' contract but the rest of the league, many of whom had spent years or even decades losing to the Celtics on the court, said that they would do no such thing to help Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new|title=At Face Value, Board Makes Celtics Pay For Their Success|url=http://articles.courant.com/1993-11-14/sports/0000001963_1_reggie-lewis-lewis-case-salary-cap|agency=Hartford Courant|date=November 14, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules have since been changed so that a similar case would result in a deceased player's contract being paid by league insurance, with the entirety of the remaining balance immediately erased from a team's salary cap charges (similar conditions are now part of contracts for players with career-ending medical issues, as was shown when the [[Miami Heat]] and the NBA's insurance carrier reached a deal to jointly pay [[Chris Bosh]] the full balance of his contract and removed 100% of the contract from the Heat's salary cap).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bosh, Heat part ways over year after last game|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/19830424/chris-bosh-miami-heat-formally-part-ways|work=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis is buried in an unmarked grave in [[Forest Hills Cemetery]] in [[Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{findagrave|6525322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''self-tiling tile set''', or ''setiset'', of order ''n'' is a set of ''n'' shapes or pieces, usually planar, each of which can be tiled with smaller replicas of the complete set of ''n'' shapes. That is, the ''n'' shapes can be assembled in ''n'' different ways so as to create larger copies of themselves, where the increase in scale is the same in each case. Figure 1 shows an example for ''n'' = 4 using distinctly shaped [[decominoes]]. The concept can be extended to include pieces of higher dimension. The name setisets was coined by [[Lee Sallows]] in 2012,&lt;ref name=mathmag&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sallows |first1=Lee |title=On Self-Tiling Tile Sets |journal=[[Mathematics Magazine]] |date=December 2012 |volume=85 |issue=5 |pages=323–333 |doi=10.4169/math.mag.85.5.323}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=erickson&gt;[http://alejandroerickson.com/home/blog/blog.php?entry=15 Alejandro Erickson on Self-tiling tile sets]&lt;/ref&gt; but the problem of finding such sets for ''n'' = 4 was asked decades previously by C. Dudley Langford, and examples for [[polyabolo]]es (discovered by [[Martin Gardner]], Wade E. Philpott and others) and [[polyomino]]es (discovered by Maurice J.

[[File:A setiset with duplicated piece.png|thumb|300px|Figure 2:  {{pad|.2em}}  A setiset with duplicated piece.]]
From the above definition it follows that a setiset composed of ''n'' identical pieces is the same thing as a 'self-replicating tile' or [[rep-tile]], of which setisets are therefore a generalization.&lt;ref name=mathmag2&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sallows |first1=Lee |title=More On Self-Tiling Tile Sets |journal=Mathematics Magazine |date=April 2014 |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=100–112 |doi=10.4169/math.mag.87.2.100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Setisets using ''n'' distinct shapes, such as Figure 1, are called ''perfect''. Figure 2 shows an example for ''n'' = 4 which is ''imperfect'' because two of the component shapes are the same.
{{clear}}

The shapes employed in a setiset need not be ''connected'' regions. Disjoint pieces composed of two or more separated islands are also permitted. Such pieces are described as ''disconnected'', or ''weakly-connected'' (when islands join only at a point), as seen in the setiset shown in Figure 3.

The fewest number of pieces in a setiset is two. Figure 4 encapsulates an infinite family of order 2 setisets each composed of two triangles, ''P'' and ''Q''. As shown, the latter can be hinged together to produce a compound triangle that has the same shape as ''P'' or ''Q'', depending upon whether the hinge is fully open or fully closed. This unusual specimen thus provides an example of a [[hinged dissection]].

==Inflation and Deflation==
[[File:A setiset of order 4 showing two stages of inflation.png|thumb|left|300px|Figure 5:  {{pad|.2em}}  A setiset of order 4 using octominoes. Two stages of inflation are shown.]]

The properties of setisets mean that their pieces form [[substitution tiling]]s, or [[tessellations]] in which the [[prototile]]s can be dissected or combined so as to yield smaller or larger duplicates of themselves. Clearly, the twin actions of forming still larger and larger copies (known as inflation), or still smaller and smaller dissections (deflation), can be repeated indefinitely. In this way, setisets can produce non-periodic tilings. However, none of the non-periodic tilings thus far discovered qualify as [[Aperiodic tiling|aperiodic]], because the prototiles can always be rearranged so as to yield a periodic tiling. Figure 5 shows the first two stages of inflation of an order 4 set leading to a non-periodic tiling.

==Loops==
[[File:A loop of length 2 using decominoes.png|thumb|300px|Figure 6:  {{pad|.2em}}  A loop of length 2 using decominoes.]]
Besides self-tiling tile sets, which can be interpreted as loops of length 1, there exist longer loops, or closed chains of sets, in which every set tiles its successor.&lt;ref name=delahaye&gt;[http://www.scilogs.fr/complexites/pepites-geometriques-cachees/ ''Geometric Hidden Gems'' by Jean-Paul Delahaye in Scilogs], April 07, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Figure 6 shows a pair of mutually tiling sets of [[decominoes]], in other words, a loop of length 2. Sallows and Schotel did an exhaustive search of order 4 sets that are composed of [[octominoes]]. In addition to seven ordinary setisets (i.e., loops of length 1) they found a bewildering variety of loops of every length up to a maximum of 14. The total number of loops identified was nearly one and a half million. More research in this area remains to be done, but it seems safe to suppose that other shapes may also entail loops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leesallows.com/index.php?page_menu=Self-Tiling%20Tile%20Sets Self-Tiling Tile Sets website]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

==Methods of construction==
To date, two methods have been used for producing setisets. In the case of sets composed of shapes such as [[polyomino]]es, which entail integral piece sizes, a brute force search by computer is possible, so long as ''n'', the number of pieces involved, is not prohibitive. It is easily shown that ''n'' must then be a [[Square number|perfect square]].&lt;ref name=mathmag2/&gt; Figures 1,2,3,5 and 6 are all examples found by this method.

Alternatively, there exists a method whereby multiple copies of a rep-tile can be dissected in certain ways so as to yield shapes that create setisets. Figures 7 and 8 show setisets produced by this means, in which each piece is the union of 2 and 3 rep-tiles, respectively. In Figure 8 can be seen how the 9 pieces above together tile the 3 rep-tile shapes below, while each of the 9 pieces is itself formed by the union of 3 such rep-tile shapes. Hence each shape can be tiled with smaller duplicates of the entire set of 9.&lt;ref name=mathmag2/&gt;

'''''The Amber Time Machine''''' is a BBC documentary written and presented by [[David Attenborough]]. It was first transmitted in 2004 and later became part of the ''[[Attenborough in Paradise and Other Personal Voyages]]'' collection of seven documentaries.

The documentary shows Attenborough searching for the identities of preserved creatures inside a piece of [[Baltic amber]] that was given to him by his adoptive sister when he was twelve years old. It then shows how a group of scientists can reconstruct an entire twenty million-year-old ecosystem through pieces of [[Dominican amber]]. Examples include a tadpole preserved in amber after falling from a [[Bromeliad]].

Attenborough then discusses the scientific feasibility of [[DNA]] being preserved in amber, and the science behind the 1993 hit techno-thriller ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', in which his elder brother [[Richard Attenborough]] starred as [[John Hammond (Jurassic Park)|John Hammond]]. Several attempts were tried, with DNA eventually being recovered from a [[weevil]] that was several million years older than [[Tyrannosaurus rex]]. Attenborough reasons that a few old, rare pieces of amber may contain DNA.

{{Spirituality-sidebar}}
'''Transcendentalism''' is a philosophical movement that developed in the late 1820s and 1830s in the eastern United States.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite web |first=Russell |last=Goodman |year=2015 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/transcendentalism/ |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title=Transcendentalism}} "Transcendentalism is an American literary, political, and philosophical movement of the early nineteenth century, centered around Ralph Waldo Emerson."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Transcendentalism |editor-first=Tiffany K. |editor-last=Wayne |year=2006 |publisher=Facts On File's Literary Movements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hckauAdkix0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Encyclopedia+of+Transcendentalism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBvpKTveDPAhUE6CYKHX21AD8Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Transcendentalism |publisher=Merriam Webster |year=2016 |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/transcendentalism}}"a philosophy which says that thought and spiritual things are more real than ordinary human experience and material things"&lt;/ref&gt;  It arose as a reaction to protest against the general state of [[intellectualism]] and [[spirituality]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Finseth|first=Ian|title=American Transcendentalism|url=http://thoreau.eserver.org/amertran.html|publisher=Excerpted from "Liquid Fire Within Me": Language, Self and Society in Transcendentalism and Early Evangelicalism, 1820-1860, - M.A. Thesis, 1995.|accessdate=18 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416154939/http://thoreau.eserver.org/amertran.html|archivedate=16 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The doctrine of the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church as taught at [[Harvard Divinity School]] was of particular interest.

Transcendentalism emerged from "English and German Romanticism, the Biblical criticism of [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], the skepticism of [[David Hume]]",&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; and the transcendental philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[German Idealism]]. Miller and Versluis regard [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] as a pervasive influence on transcendentalism.{{sfn|Miller|1950|p=49}}{{sfn|Versluis|2001|p=17}} It was also strongly influenced by Hindu texts on philosophy of the mind and spirituality, especially the [[Upanishads]].

A core belief of transcendentalism is in the inherent goodness of people and nature. Adherents believe that society and its institutions have corrupted the purity of the individual, and they have faith that people are at their best when truly "[[self-Reliance|self-reliant]]" and independent.

Transcendentalism emphasizes subjective intuition over objective empiricism. Adherents believe that individuals are capable of generating completely original insights with little attention and deference to past masters.

==Origin==

Transcendentalism is closely related to [[Unitarianism]], the dominant religious movement in Boston in the early nineteenth century. It started to develop after Unitarianism took hold at Harvard University, following the elections of [[Henry Ware (Unitarian)|Henry Ware]] as the Hollis Professor of Divinity in 1805 and of [[John Thornton Kirkland]] as President in 1810. Transcendentalism was not a rejection of Unitarianism; rather, it developed as an organic consequence of the Unitarian emphasis on free conscience and the value of intellectual reason. The transcendentalists were not content with the sobriety, mildness, and calm rationalism of Unitarianism. Instead, they longed for a more intense spiritual experience. Thus, transcendentalism was not born as a counter-movement to Unitarianism, but as a parallel movement to the very ideas introduced by the Unitarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Finseth|first1=Ian Frederick|title=The Emergence of Transcendentalism|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma95/finseth/trans.html|website= American Studies @ The University of Virginia|publisher=[[The University of Virginia]]|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transcendental Club==

[[File:Ralph Waldo Emerson ca1857.jpg|thumb|[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]]]
Transcendentalism became a coherent movement and a sacred organization with the founding of the [[Transcendental Club]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], on September 8, 1836 by prominent New England intellectuals, including [[George Putnam (minister)|George Putnam]] (1807–78, the Unitarian minister in [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/Heralds/George-Putnam.php |title=Heralds |contribution=George Putnam |publisher=Harvard Square Library |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305153702/http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/Heralds/George-Putnam.php |archivedate=March 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], and [[Frederic Henry Hedge]]. From 1840, the group frequently published in their journal ''[[The Dial]]'', along with other venues.

==Second wave of transcendentalists==

By the late 1840s, Emerson believed that the movement was dying out, and even more so after the death of [[Margaret Fuller]] in 1850. "All that can be said," Emerson wrote, "is that she represents an interesting hour and group in American cultivation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Rose | first = Anne C | title = Transcendentalism as a Social Movement, 1830–1850 | place = New Haven, CT | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1981 | page = 208 | isbn = 0-300-02587-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There was, however, a second wave of transcendentalists, including [[Moncure Conway]], [[Octavius Brooks Frothingham]], [[Samuel Longfellow]] and [[Franklin Benjamin Sanborn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Gura | first = Philip F | title = American Transcendentalism: A History | place = New York | publisher = Hill and Wang | year = 2007 | page = 8 | isbn = 0-8090-3477-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Notably, the transgression of the spirit, most often evoked by the poet's prosaic voice, is said to endow in the reader a sense of purposefulness. This is the underlying theme in the majority of transcendentalist essays and papers—all of which are centered on subjects which assert a love for individual expression.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Martin K. "Empirical Analysis of the American Transcendental movement". New York, NY: Penguin, 2012:303.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the group was mostly made up of struggling [[aestheticism|aesthetes]], the wealthiest among them was [[Samuel Gray Ward]], who, after a few contributions to ''The Dial'', focused on his banking career.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne, Tiffany. ''Encyclopedia of Transcendentalism: The Essential Guide to the Lives and Works of Transcendentalist Writers''. New York: Facts on File, 2006: 308. {{ISBN|0-8160-5626-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
Transcendentalists are strong believers in the power of the individual. It focuses primarily on personal freedom. Their beliefs are closely linked with those of the [[Romantics]], but differ by an attempt to embrace or, at least, to not oppose the empiricism of science.

===Transcendental knowledge===
Transcendentalists desire to ground their religion and philosophy in principles based upon the German [[Romanticism]] of Herder and Schleiermacher. Transcendentalism merged "English and German Romanticism, the Biblical criticism of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and [[Schleiermacher]], and the skepticism of [[David Hume|Hume]]",&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; and the transcendental philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] (and of [[German Idealism]] more generally), interpreting Kant's a priori categories as a priori knowledge. Early transcendentalists were largely unacquainted with [[German philosophy]] in the original and relied primarily on the writings of [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Victor Cousin]], [[Germaine de Staël]], and other English and French commentators for their knowledge of it. The transcendental movement can be described as an American outgrowth of English Romanticism.

===Individualism===
Transcendentalists believe that society and its institutions—particularly organized religion and political parties—corrupt the purity of the individual. They have faith that people are at their best when truly "self-reliant" and independent. It is only from such real individuals that true community can form.
Even with this necessary individuality, transcendentalists also believe that all people are outlets for the "[[Over-soul]]." Because the Over-soul is one, this unites all people as one being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Emerson|first1=Ralph Waldo|title=The Over-Soul|url=http://transcendentalism-legacy.tamu.edu/authors/emerson/essays/oversoul.html|website=American Transcendentalism Web|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=July 2015}} Emerson alludes to this concept in the introduction of the ''American Scholar'' address, "that there is One Man, - present to all particular men only partially, or through one faculty; and that you must take the whole society to find the whole man."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://transcendentalism-legacy.tamu.edu/authors/emerson/essays/amscholar.html|title=EMERSON--"THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR"|website=transcendentalism-legacy.tamu.edu|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an ideal is in harmony with Transcendentalist individualism, as each person is empowered to behold within him or herself a piece of the divine Over-soul.

===Indian religions===
Transcendentalism has been directly influenced by [[Indian religions]].{{sfn|Versluis|1993}}{{sfn|Versluis|2001|p=3}}{{refn|group=note|Versluis: "In ''American Transcendentalism and Asian religions'', I detailed the immense impact that the Euro-American discovery of Asian religions had not only on European Romanticism, but above all, on American Transcendentalism. There I argued that the Transcendentalists' discovery of the [[Bhagavad-Gita]], the [[Vedas]], the [[Upanishads]], and other world scriptures was critical in the entire movement, pivotal not only for the well-known figures like Emerson and Thoreau, but also for lesser known figures like Samuel Johnson and William Rounsville Alger. That Transcendentalism emerged out of this new knowledge of the world's religious traditions I have no doubt."{{sfn|Versluis|2001|p=3}}}}  Thoreau in ''[[Walden]]'' spoke of the Transcendentalists' debt to Indian religions directly:
[[File:Henry David Thoreau 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henry David Thoreau]]]]
{{quote|In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the [[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavat Geeta]], since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed, and in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial; and I doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence, so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions. I lay down the book and go to my well for water, and lo! there I meet the servant of the [[Brahmin]], priest of [[Brahma]], and [[Vishnu]] and [[Indra]], who still sits in his temple on the Ganges reading the [[Vedas]], or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water-jug. I meet his servant come to draw water for his master, and our buckets as it were grate together in the same well. The pure Walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the Ganges.&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau, Henry David. ''[[Walden]]''. Boston: Ticknor&amp;Fields, 1854.p.279. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}
In 1844, the first English translation of the [[Lotus Sutra]] was included in ''[[The Dial]]'', a publication of the New England Transcendentalists, translated from French by [[Elizabeth Peabody|Elizabeth Palmer Peabody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lopez Jr.|first1=Donald S.|title=The Life of the Lotus Sutra|journal=Tricycle Magazine|date=2016|issue=Winter|URL=https://tricycle.org/magazine/lotus-sutra-history/}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=|first1=|title=The Preaching of Buddha|journal=The Dial|date=1844|volume=4|page=391|URL=https://books.google.com/books?id=VnsAAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Idealism===
Transcendentalists differ in their interpretations of the practical aims of will. Some adherents link it with utopian social change; [[Orestes Brownson|Brownson]], for example, connected it with early socialism, but others consider it an exclusively individualist and idealist project. Emerson believed the latter; in his 1842 lecture "[[The Transcendentalist]]", he suggested that the goal of a purely transcendental outlook on life was impossible to attain in practice:  
{{quote|You will see by this sketch that there is no such thing as a transcendental ''party''; that there is no pure transcendentalist; that we know of no one but prophets and heralds of such a philosophy; that all who by strong bias of nature have leaned to the spiritual side in doctrine, have stopped short of their goal. We have had many harbingers and forerunners; but of a purely spiritual life, history has afforded no example. I mean, we have yet no man who has leaned entirely on his character, and eaten angels' food; who, trusting to his sentiments, found life made of miracles; who, working for universal aims, found himself fed, he knew not how; clothed, sheltered, and weaponed, he knew not how, and yet it was done by his own hands.  ...Shall we say, then, that transcendentalism is the [[Saturnalia]] or excess of Faith; the presentiment of a faith proper to man in his integrity, excessive only when his imperfect obedience hinders the satisfaction of his wish.}}

==Influence on other movements==
{{NewThought}}
{{further information|History of New Thought}}

Transcendentalism is, in many aspects, the first notable American intellectual movement. It has inspired succeeding generations of American intellectuals, as well as some literary movements.&lt;ref&gt;Coviello, Peter. "Transcendentalism" ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of American Literature''. Oxford University Press, 2004. ''Oxford Reference Online''. Web. 23 Oct. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Transcendentalism influenced the growing movement of "Mental Sciences" of the mid-19th century, which would later become known as the [[New Thought]] movement. New Thought considers Emerson its intellectual father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761571544/New_Thought.html | contribution = New Thought | title = MSN Encarta | accessdate = Nov 16, 2007 | publisher = Microsoft | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5kx6eOYRz?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761571544/New_Thought.html | archivedate = 2009-11-01 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emma Curtis Hopkins]] "the teacher of teachers", [[Ernest Holmes]], founder of [[Religious Science]], the Fillmores, founders of [[Unity Church|Unity]], and [[Malinda Cramer]] and [[Nona L. Brooks]], the founders of [[Divine Science]], were all greatly influenced by Transcendentalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.websyte.com/alan/intachrt.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20000824113817/http://websyte.com/alan/intachrt.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2000-08-24 | title = INTA New Thought History Chart | publisher = Websyte }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Transcendentalism also influenced [[Hinduism]]. [[Ram Mohan Roy]] (1772–1833), the founder of the [[Brahmo Samaj]], rejected Hindu mythology, but also the Christian trinity.{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=268}} He found that [[Unitarianism]] came closest to true Christianity,{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=268}} and had a strong sympathy for the Unitarians,{{sfn|Kipf|1979|p=3}} who were closely connected to the Transcendentalists.{{sfn|Versluis|1993}} Ram Mohan Roy founded a missionary committee in Calcutta, and in 1828 asked for support for missionary activities from the American Unitarians.{{sfn|Kipf|1979|p=7-8}} By 1829, Roy had abandoned the Unitarian Committee,{{sfn|Kipf|1979|p=15}} but after Roy's death, the Brahmo Samaj kept close ties to the Unitarian Church,{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=268-269}} who strived towards a rational faith, social reform, and the joining of these two in a renewed religion.{{sfn|Kipf|1979|p=3}} Its theology was called "[[neo-Vedanta]]" by Christian commentators,{{sfn|Halbfass|1995|p=9}}{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=192}} and has been highly influential in the modern popular understanding of Hinduism,{{sfn|King|2002}} but also of modern western spirituality, which re-imported the Unitarian influences in the disguise of the seemingly age-old Neo-Vedanta.{{sfn|King|2002}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}

==Major figures==

Early in the movement's history, the term "Transcendentalists" was used as a [[wikt:pejorative|pejorative]] term by critics, who were suggesting their position was beyond sanity and reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Loving | first = Jerome | title = Walt Whitman: The Song of Himself | publisher = University of California Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-520-22687-9 | page = 185}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] wrote a novel, ''[[The Blithedale Romance]]'' (1852), satirizing the movement, and based it on his experiences at [[Brook Farm]], a short-lived utopian community founded on transcendental principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = McFarland | first = Philip | title = Hawthorne in Concord | place = New York | publisher = Grove Press | year = 2004 | page = 149 | isbn = 0-8021-1776-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edgar Allan Poe]] wrote a story, "[[Never Bet the Devil Your Head]]" (1841), in which he embedded elements of deep dislike for transcendentalism, calling its followers "Frogpondians" after the pond on [[Boston Common]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Royot | first = Daniel | contribution = Poe's humor | title = The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe | editor-first = Kevin J | editor-last = Hayes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2002 | pages = 61–2 | isbn = 0-521-79727-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The narrator ridiculed their writings by calling them "metaphor-run" lapsing into "mysticism for mysticism's sake",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ljunquist | first = Kent | contribution = The poet as critic | title = The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe | editor-first = Kevin J | editor-last = Hayes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2002 | page = 15 | isbn = 0-521-79727-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called it a "disease." The story specifically mentions the movement and its flagship journal ''The Dial'', though Poe denied that he had any specific targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sova | first = Dawn B | title = Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z | place = New York | publisher = Checkmark Books | year = 2001 | page = 170 | isbn = 0-8160-4161-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Poe's essay "[[The Philosophy of Composition]]" (1846), he offers criticism denouncing "the excess of the suggested meaning... which turns into prose (and that of the very flattest kind) the so-called poetry of the so-called transcendentalists."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Norton Anthology of American Literature | volume = B | edition = 6th | editor1-first = Nina | editor1-last = Baym | place = New York | publisher = Norton | year = 2007|display-editors=etal}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Triops cancriformis''''', or '''tadpole shrimp''', is a species of [[Notostraca|tadpole shrimp]]s found in [[Europe]] to the [[Middle East]] and [[India]].&lt;ref name="invertebrates1"/&gt;

Due to habitat destruction, many populations have recently been lost across its European range, so, the species is considered [[endangered]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and in several European countries.&lt;ref name="invertebrates1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkive.org/species/ARK/invertebrates_terrestrial_and_freshwater/Triops_cancriformis/more_info.html |title=Tadpole shrimp - ''Triops cancriformis'' |publisher=[[ARKive]] |date= |accessdate=April 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In captivity they commonly grow up to {{convert|6|cm}}; in the wild they can achieve sizes of {{convert|11|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="invertebrates1"/&gt;

In the UK, there are just two known populations: in a pool and adjacent area in the [[WWT Caerlaverock|Caerlaverock Wetlands]] in [[Scotland]], and a temporary pond in the [[New Forest]].&lt;ref name="location"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planetearth.nerc.ac.uk/features/story.aspx?id=212 |title=''Triops'', the 300 million year-old living fossil |publisher=Planet Earth online |date=22 December 2008 |accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species is legally protected under Schedule 5 of the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981]] (as amended).

This species is considered to be one of the oldest living species on the planet at around 200 million years old. Fossils of this species from the [[Upper Triassic]] ([[Norian]]) period appear virtually unchanged compared to modern day members of the species.&lt;ref name="Kelber"&gt;[http://www.equisetites.de/kelber.html#triops Klaus-Peter Kelber - Triops]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life cycle==
''Triops cancriformis'' has a very fast life cycle, and individuals become mature in about two weeks after hatching. Their populations can be [[Gonochorism|gonochoric]], [[Hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] or [[androdioecious]]. The latter is a very rare reproductive mode in animals, in which populations are made of hermaphrodites, with a small proportion of males. Due to this lack of males, early researchers thought Triops were [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenetic]]. The presence of testicular lobes scattered amongst their ovaries confirmed they were in fact hermaphroditic. Fertilized females or hermaphrodites produce [[Diapause|diapausing]] eggs or cysts, able to survive decades in the sediment of the ponds and lakes they inhabit. These eggs are resistant to drought and temperature extremes.

==Taxonomic history==
In 1801, [[Louis Augustin Guillaume Bosc]] made the first officially recognised species description of ''Triops cancriformis''.&lt;ref name="Møller"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ole S. Møller, Jørgen Olesen &amp; Jens T. Høeg |year=2003 |title=SEM studies on the early larval development of ''Triops cancriformis'' (Bosc) (Crustacea: Branchiopoda, Notostraca) |journal=[[Acta Zoologica: Morphology and Evolution|Acta Zoologica]] |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=267–284 |doi=10.1046/j.1463-6395.2003.00146.x |url=http://www.zmuc.dk/inverweb/staff/Ole_S_M%F8ller/PDF/M%F8ller_et_al(2003).pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He named this species ''Apus cancriformis''. Other authors used the name ''Apus cancriformis'' over the years but often with the wrong original author of this name.&lt;ref name="Møller"/&gt;

In 1909, [[Ludwig Keilhack]] used the correct name "''Triops cancriformis'' (Bosc)" in a [[field guide|field identification]] [[Single-access key|key]] of the freshwater fauna of [[Germany]]. He took up the [[genus]] name proposed by [[Franz Paula von Schrank|Schrank]] and suggested that the genus name ''Apus'' be replaced with ''[[Triops]]'' Schrank since ''[[Apus_(genus)|Apus]]'' had been used since 1777 as the genus name of some birds (commonly known as [[swifts]]). However, other authors disagreed with him and the controversy continued until the 1950s&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | editor-last=Hemming | editor-first=Francis | year=1958 | chapter=Opinion 502 | title=Opinions and Declarations Rendered by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature | publisher=International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature | volume=Volume 18 | issue=3 | place=London | pages=65–120 | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/34986782 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1955, [[Alan Longhurst]] provided the original author of ''T. cancriformis'' as "''Triops cancriformis'' (Bosc, 1801)" with a full history of synonymy to support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Alan R. Longhurst |year=1955 |title=A review of the Notostraca |journal=[[Bulletin of the British Museum (Natural History)]] |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1–57 |url=http://biostor.org/reference/1299}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in a taxonomic review of the [[Notostraca]] that also supported using the genus name ''Triops'' instead of ''Apus''. In 1958, the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN) recognised the name ''Triops cancriformis'' (Bosc, 1801–1802) (ICZN name no. 1476) as officially the oldest. They also recognised the genus name ''Triops'' Schrank instead of ''Apus''. They followed Longhurst in these decisions.&lt;ref name="Møller"/&gt;

==Human uses==
[[File:Beni-KabutoEbiAlbino1.jpg|300px|thumbnail|''Triops cancriformis'' Beni-Kabuto Ebi Albino feeding on a piece of rehydrated dried shrimp, ultra closeup showing how transparent the carapace is.]]

Although members of the genus ''Triops'' usually have no economic importance, the Beni-kabuto ebi albino variant of ''Triops cancriformis'' has been used to control mosquitoes and weeds in Asian rice fields.

''Triops cancriformis'' is the second most common species raised by hobbyists next to ''[[Triops longicaudatus]]''. They are particularly valued for their lower hatching temperature and somewhat longer lifespan as well as potentially larger size.

'''Widow conservation''' was a [[Types of marriages|type of marriage]] in Protestant Europe in the [[early modern age]], when the widow of a [[parish church|parish vicar]] was married to her husband's successor to ensure her economic support. This practice was common in Scandinavia (''Änkekonservering''/''Enkekonservering'') and the Protestant parts of Germany (''Konservierung von Pfarrwitwen''). It is related to other forms of [[widow inheritance]], including the [[levirate marriage]] known in the [[Old Testament]] as ''[[yibbum]]''.

At the introduction of the [[Protestant Reformation]], priests were [[Clerical_marriage#Protestant_Churches|allowed to marry]]. However, as they [[tied accommodation|did not own the vicarage]] and property attached to his profession, his spouse and issue were left without a home and means to support themselves after his death. The future support of the widows and children of vicars thereby became a concern for the various churches. The most common solution was that the successor of a vicar married the widow (or perhaps the daughter) of his predecessor, thereby "conserving" her.

==Denmark-Norway==
In the [[Denmark-Norway|United Kingdoms of Denmark and Norway]], the ''Kirkeordinansen'' or Church charter of 1537, issued by [[Christian III of Denmark]] after the [[Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein]], secured the widows of priests the right to a ''Naadensaar'' (Year of Grace), during which they were secured an income from the parish of their late spouses and residence at the vicarage.  Other than that, however, nothing was done to provide for priests' widows, and when the year was over, they were left to support themselves as well as they could, often as midwives or by some small business enterprise in the closest town.  In 1566, a recommendation was issued in which priests were lectured to show mercy to the widows of their predecessors and let them stay in the vicarage, and some vicarages established a widow's house adjoining their vicarage.&lt;ref name=PiDoN&gt;Præstegaardsliv i Danmark og Norge i Tidsrummet fra Reformationen til det syttende Aarhundredes Slutning Af Vilhelm Bang (1891)&lt;/ref&gt;

This proved to be insufficient, and by the early 17th-century, it had become customary for a parish to elect a vicar on condition that he marry the widow of his predecessor.  There was never any formal law to require this, and if the parish protested to the authorities against a vicar who broke his promise after having been elected, their complaints were given no support by the crown: however, in practice this was an accepted custom which vicars adjusted to, and during the 17th century it was not uncommon for a woman to have been married to four priests in succession.&lt;ref name=PiDoN /&gt;

In 1659, the first local pension fund for vicars' widows was established. This gradually became a more popular option, but some parishes continued to practise widow conservation until the late 18th century.&lt;ref name=PiDoN /&gt;

==Germany==
[[File:Ännchen von Tharau - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Ännchen von Tharau]]
===Brandenburg===
In Mark Brandenburg, widow conservation was common practice in the 17th century.

In 1698, Frederick III of Brandenburg banned widow conservation by the ''Juramentum simoniae'' as being a form of purchase of the vicarage office.&lt;ref&gt;Würth: Pfarrwitwenversorgung. S. 180ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Prussia===
Widow conservation was common practice in East Prussia. The practice is here the center of the legend of ''[[Ännchen von Tharau]]'', which was inspired by the case of [[Anna Neander]] (1615–1689).

===Mecklenburg===
The first widow conservation of the kind is documented from 1551, and by 1580, it had become a common practice, which was recommended by the church order of 1602. By 1704, one third of all vicars' wives were the widow of the predecessor of her spouse.

From 1623 onward, however, there was also an increasing number of widow funds, which made widow conservation less necessary. The last widow conservation took place in the mid-19th century.

===Pomerania===
In [[Pomerania]], the church [[synod]] of 1545 saw no other choice but to tolerate the practice, and in 1572, the conservation of the widow or daughter of a vicar was officially declared the duty of his successor. An attempt to replace it with a dowry provided by the congregations in 1575 failed.

During the 18th century, the practice started to decrease because of more alternatives, such as the foundation of a fund for vicars' widows in Swedish Pomerania in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Würth: Pfarrwitwenversorgung. S. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saxony===
In the Duchy of Saxony, a strong policy to prevent widow conservation was enforced already when it occurred in the 16th century, and attempts of having a successor of a vicar marry the widow or daughter of his predecessor were actually prevented and contested when it did occur.

==Sweden-Finland==
[[File:Margaretha Burea - Stormor i Dalom.jpg|thumb|''[[Stormor i Dalom]]''.]]
In Sweden and Finland ([[Sweden-Finland|then a Swedish province]]), the parish vicars were given permission to marry after the [[Swedish Reformation]] of 1527. The support of vicars' widows quickly became a concern: while priests and their families were being provided for by the income from their parish, this income was attached to their office, and the widow had no right to it after the death of the priest, which could place her in a difficult situation unless she, or her late spouse, had a personal fortune, which was normally not the case. After the death of a vicar, his widow was entitled to a ''Nådeår'' or ''Nådår'' (Year of Grace) to live on the vicarage while preparing support for herself and her children. During that year, the parish were to select the next vicar. As the parish and church considered it their duty to support the widow of their former vicar, they normally chose a priest who expressed himself willing to marry the widow of his predecessor. The vicar's widow herself also seems to have played a part in electing the next vicar by using the influence she had in the parish by her position as vicar's wife. Another way to arrange the support of the widow was for the next vicar to marry her adult daughter, if she had one, or that the son of a vicar succeeded him.&lt;ref name=Karin&gt;Karin Tegenborg Falkdalen: Kyrkomiljö på Jamtli (2007) Östersund (Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Swedish Church Ordinance 1571]], the rules stated that the son or the son-in-law of the former vicar were to be considered first when a new parish vicar was chosen. During the 17th century, widow conservation was common practice and the majority of the vicar's wives were the widow or daughter of her husband's predecessor. The [[Swedish Church Law 1686]] stated that when a new parish vicar was to be elected, the candidates who expressed themselves willing to marry the widow or daughter of his predecessor should be favored. This regulation was dropped in 1739, when the education of the vicars became the formal qualification to the office, but informally, the practice continued the entire 18th century, as the parishes continued to regard it their responsibility to support the vicars' wives, who were often locals and had strong positions in their parishes.&lt;ref name=Karin /&gt;

There were also parishes which were formally inherited this way. In 1591, King [[John III of Sweden]] granted the [[Annerstad]] parish in [[Småland]] to vicar [[Georgius Marci]], to be inherited on both the male and female line by his descendants: either by a son, or by a successor married to a daughter or a widow of his predecessor. Upon the death of Marci in 1613, his parish was inherited by his son-in-law by marriage to his daughter, Kerstin Marca (1585–1653), who has been referred to as the first Swedish female to have formally inherited the right to a vicar's parish. The Annerstad parish was on several occasions inherited by females in the same fashion - such as for example by Gunilla Osængius in 1685 - until the year of 1780, when king [[Gustav III of Sweden]] refused the request of a vicars candidate to marry the 12-year-old daughter of the recently deceased vicar Anders Osængius.&lt;ref name=Karin /&gt;

By the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century, however, widow conservation quickly came out of use. The reasons were several: a different view upon marriage as more of a love union than a practical arrangement; that the education of the candidates, who were less often the sons of vicars, had become more important; and because the recently established retirement funds for vicar's widows made the solution less needed.&lt;ref name=Karin /&gt; The first retirement fund was ''[[Allmänna Änke- och Pupillkassan i Sverige]]'' from 1740, granting pensions to destitute widows of civil servants; this was not sufficient, and during the 19th-century, the ''Nådår'' was often prolonged upon application, until the more efficient retirement fund ''[[Prästerskapets Änke- och Pupillkassa]]'' exclusively for vicar's widows was established in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;Nordisk familjebok / Uggleupplagan. 22.

[[Colonel]] '''William Paterson''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (17 August 1755 – 21 June 1810) was a Scottish soldier, [[exploration|explorer]], [[Lieutenant governor (Australia)|Lieutenant governor]] and [[botanist]] best known for leading early settlement in [[Tasmania]]. {{botanist|Paterson|Paterson, William|border=0|inline=1}}

==Biography==

===Early years===
A native of [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]], [[Scotland]], Paterson was interested in [[botany]] as a boy and trained in horticulture at Syon in London.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, N., 'William Paterson: amateur colonial botanist, 1755–1810’, ''Australian Garden History'', 17 (1), 2005, pp. 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Paterson was sent to the [[Cape Colony]] by the wealthy and eccentric [[Mary Bowes, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Countess of Strathmore]] to collect plants, he arrived in [[Table Bay]] on board the "''Houghton''" in May 1777. He made four trips into the interior between May 1777 and March 1780, when he departed. In 1789 Paterson published [https://archive.org/details/narrativeoffourj1789pate ''Narrative of Four Journeys into the Country of the Hottentots and Caffraria''], which he dedicated to [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]].

===Career===
Paterson was originally commissioned as an [[ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the [[98th Regiment of Foot (disambiguation)|98th Regiment of Foot]] and served in [[India]]. He later transferred to the [[73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot|73rd Regiment of Foot]] after the 98th's disbandment in 1787. In 1789, he was promoted to [[Captain (land)|captain]] in the [[New South Wales Corps]], serving under Major [[Francis Grose]].&lt;ref&gt;"Officers of His Majesty's New South Wales Corps of Foot" in Bladen (ed.) 1978, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; After some time spent recruiting, he arrived in Sydney in October 1791. From November 1791 until March 1793 he served in command on [[Norfolk Island]]. Whilst there he collected botanical, geological and insect specimens and sent them to Banks. He also provided seed to the [[Lee and Kennedy]] and Colvill nurseries.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, N., 'William Paterson: amateur colonial botanist, 1755–1810’, ''Australian Garden History'', 17 (1), 2005, pp. 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in May 1798.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/Lists-of-Royal-Society-Fellows-1660-2007/|title=Lists of Royal Society Fellows 1660–2007|publisher=The Royal Society|accessdate=15 July 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1794 he served for a year as [[Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales]]. In 1800 he was re-appointed to the post and served a second term until 1808.
 
He led an expedition to the [[Hunter Region]] in 1801 and up the [[Paterson River]] (later named in his honour by [[Philip Gidley King|Governor King]]) and in 1804 led an expedition to [[Port Dalrymple]], in what is now Tasmania, exploring the [[Tamar River]] and going up the [[North Esk River]] farther than European had previously gone.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1804 and 1808 Paterson was also appointed [[Lieutenant Governor of Van Diemen's Land|Commandant at Port Dalrymple]], the administrator of the colony in the north of Van Diemen's Land. In 1806, Paterson's duties as commander of the [[New South Wales Corps]] required him to return to Sydney, but he went back to Van Diemen's Land in 1807, and stayed until December 1808. During this time he corresponded regularly with the eminent naturalist Sir Joseph Banks, sending a number of specimens.

The New South Wales Corps selected Paterson as acting [[Governor of New South Wales]] on 1 January 1809 after the deposition of Governor Captain [[William Bligh]] in the so-called "[[Rum Rebellion]]." He was replaced by the newly arrived [[Lachlan Macquarie]] by the end of the year. He left Sydney for England on 12 May 1810, but died on board [[HMS Howe (1805)|HMS ''Dromedary'']] while off [[Cape Horn]] just a few weeks later.

His widow Elizabeth married [[Francis Grose (British Army officer)|Francis Grose]] in April 1814, but he died a month later. Elizabeth died in Liverpool, England in 1839.

[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Life of Lt. Gen. Yitzhak Rabin, 7th IDF Chief of Staff in photos (11).jpg|alt=Yitzhak Rabin was an Israeli politician, statesman and general. He was the fifth Prime Minister of Israel|thumb|Yitzhak Rabin was an Israeli politician, statesman and general. He was the fifth Prime Minister of Israel]]
'''Yitzhak Rabin assassination conspiracy theories''' arose almost immediately following [[Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|the assassination of]] [[Yitzhak Rabin]], the [[Israel]]i Prime Minister, on November 4, 1995. The gunman [[Yigal Amir]], a [[Jew]]ish Israeli student, was apprehended within seconds by people in the crowd. Rabin died later on the operating table of [[Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center|Ichilov Hospital]]. Amir confessed to the assassination of Rabin.

The matter has been reported as clear cut in the media, and the Shamgar national inquiry commission and the court all drew the same conclusion that Amir was guilty of murder. Nevertheless, some inconsistencies in the evidence have been alleged, both in the medical records and in the inquiry testimony. These allegations and other suspicions have been included in occasional left-wing, and more prevalent right-wing [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]].

==Conspiracy claims==

Conspiracy theories have made some or all of the following claims.  Others have been strident in opposing these conclusions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/books/1998/9812.brook.death.html|title=TWM – Death of a Peacemaker/Brook|work=washingtonmonthly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Police reports state that [[gunpowder]] was found on Rabin's body and clothing, suggesting that he had been shot at [[point-blank range]], as gunpowder travels only a few inches before dispersing.  According to the official version, Amir shot from a distance at which no powder traces could have settled on Rabin's body and clothing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yigalamir.com/html_he/yitzhak_yitchak_rabin_gladstein.html|title=יגאל עמיר ירה סרק|work=yigalamir.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yitchakrabin.com/Barry%20Chamish/html/yigal_amir_no_gunpowder.html|title=No gunpowder on Yigal Amir`s Hands "Yigal Amir did not murder Yitzhak Rabin"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|work=yitchakrabin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Surgery reports describe a bullet wound with the bullet entrance in the chest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tisanim.com/Web/Sites/hadar/PAGE20.asp|title=כך פיענחנו את רצח רבין|website=www.tisanim.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; are inconsistent with the eyewitness reports and the [[Kempler video]], which suggests that Rabin was shot in the back while walking away from Yigal Amir. Source of this provides link to a video in Hebrew and a written, inaccurate translation to English. Both versions, however, contain no hint that there was a chest '''entry''' wound, merely that there was a wound in the chest (can equally be an exit wound). Both versions report '''two''' gunshots rather than three.
* Rabin would have walked after Amir's shots in a manner inconsistent with gunshot, an impossibility if they shattered the vertebrae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yitzhakrabin.co.il/html_he/yitzhak_yitchak_rabin_third_shot.html|title=הירייה השלישית ביצחק רבין נעלמה בועדת שמגר&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yitchakrabin.com/Barry%20Chamish/html/yitzhak_rabin_thirdwound.html|title=Yitzhak Rabin`s third wound – "The Rabin Murder Fraud"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|work=yitchakrabin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Each medical record describes wounds which are "completely different" in nature to those concluded by the official [[Shamgar Commission]]. Medical descriptions of Rabin's condition are described as suddenly appearing to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tisanim.com/Web/Sites/hadar/PAGE17.asp|title=כך פיענחנו את רצח רבין|website=www.tisanim.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An anonymous physician who consulted Barry Chamish opined that "[t]he first two wounds, to the chest and abdomen occurred before Rabin's arrival. The third, frontal chest wound, had to have been inflicted after he entered the hospital," and that "it is inconceivable that Rabin had no spinal damage. The six members of the operating team were too skilled to have all been wrong about that."&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;
* Three police officers who had been present testified that "when Yitzhak Rabin was placed in the car, he showed no visible wounds."&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;http://yigalamir.com/html_he/eduyot.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yitchakrabin.com/Barry%20Chamish/html/yitzhak_rabin_testemonies.html|title=The Yitzhak Rabin murder – Eye Witnesses -"Yigal Amir did not murder Yitzhak Rabin"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|work=yitchakrabin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon Thomas in his book "Gideon's Spies" adds: "The surgeons insisted there was no possible gunshot wound that would have allowed Rabin to leave the attack site showing no evidence of a wound and arrive at the hospital with multiple damage ... subsequently the doctors have refused to discuss the matter."&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;
* Rabin's motorcade took 22 minutes to arrive at the hospital, even though he had a highly experienced chauffeur, and the streets were cordoned off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yitzhakrabin.co.il/html_he/yitzhak_yitchak_rabin_murder_time.html|title=? אז מתי בדיוק נרצח יצחק רבין&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distance between the crime scene and the hospital is a five-minute walk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tel-aviv-insider.com/maps-tel-aviv.php|title=MapsTel Aviv Insider Tour Travel Guide|work=tel-aviv-insider.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Police ballistics tests on shell casings found at the scene did not match Amir's gun.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yitchakrabin.com/Barry%20Chamish/html/yitzhak_rabin_baruch.html|title=The Yitzhak Rabin murder-TESTIMONY OF CHIEF LIEUTENANT BARUCH GLADSTEIN&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|work=yitchakrabin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* No gunpowder residue was found on Amir's hands, clothing, or hair. Gunpowder residue would inevitably have been present if Amir had shot genuine bullets, as opposed to blanks.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yigalamir.com/html_he/yigal_amir_clean_hands.html|title=הידיים הנקיות של יגאל עמיר|work=yigalamir.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* No blood was seen coming from Rabin at the scene, despite wounds to his lung and spleen, nor was any found later at that location.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; By contrast witnesses describe blood "gushing" from a chest wound upon arriving at hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yigalamir.com/videos/yitzhak-rabin-murder-doctor.htm|title=Ichilov Hospital takes part in the cover up of the murder of Yitzhak Rabin|work=yigalamir.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A [[Shin Bet]] (secret service) agent testified that "I heard a policeman shout to people to calm down. The shot is a blank."&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;
* Policeman Moshe Ephron stated: "The shots didn't sound natural. If they were real shots, they should have sounded much louder."&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;
* [[Leah Rabin]] stated that a security guard told her immediately after the incident that the bullets shot at her husband were "blanks".  She further stated that she was told by an Israeli security chief that she "should not worry as the whole thing had been staged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yigalamir.com/html_he/yitzhak_yitchak_rabin_dalia.html|title=...יגאל עמיר לא ירה ביצחק רבין|work=yigalamir.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Amir, who was employed by the Shin Bet in Latvia about two years before the murder,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tisanim.com/Web/Sites/hadar/PAGE18.asp|title=כך פיענחנו את רצח רבין|website=www.tisanim.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; commented at a court hearing, "If I were to tell the whole truth, the entire system would collapse. I know enough to destroy this country."&lt;ref&gt;[http://planet.nana.co.il/ntn/id19.htm "יגאל עמיר ידע מראש על "בימוי הרצח&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=israelinsider.com| url=http://web.israelinsider.com/Articles/Politics/6924.htm|title=Politics: Discredited Shin Bet chief's comment resurrects Rabin conspiracy questions|accessdate=2008-06-30|date=2005-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yigalamir.com/videos/amir-yitzhak-rabin-murder.htm|title=Yigal Amir blames Shimon Peres for the murder of Yitzhak Rabin|work=yigalamir.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nahum Shahaf]], an Israeli physicist who went on to play a major role in the [[Muhammad al-Durrah]] affair, has asserted that he had photographic evidence that the wrong man was being held for the assassination. He blamed the assassination on a conspiracy headed by [[Shimon Peres]], who took over from Rabin as Prime Minister and later became the [[President of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Loughlin|first=Ed|title=Truth is sometimes caught in crossfire|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/truth-is-sometimes-caught-in-crossfire/2007/10/05/1191091362085.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=October 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Authorizing Appropriation for Fiscal Years 2002 and 2003 for the Department of State and the Broadcasting Board of Governors, and for Other Purposes: Hearings and Markup Before the Committee on International Relations, House of Representatives and the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, One Hundred Seventh Congress, First Session, February 14, February 28, March 1, and March 7, 2001 and Markup of H.R. 1646 on May 2, 2001.|author=United States Congress House of Representatives Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights|volume=8–16|page=192|year=2001|publisher=US G.P.O.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of the conspiracy theories==
There are three types of criticisms  of the conspiracy theories. The most common type refutes and relativizes claims made in the conspiracy theories or by the conspiracy theorists &lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/page.do/18367/Israel%27s_Plague_of_Conspiracism.html|title=Israel's Plague of Conspiracism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and points out that the theories are detached from Israeli political culture, social relations and historic events. This criticism is not necessarily politically "coloured" and may refer to both the right wing and left wing conspiracy theories. The other criticism focuses entirely on the more common, right wing theories.

A second, mostly Israeli left-wing criticism, attacks the very existence of such theories as a denial of what they consider to be right wing "responsibility" for the murder.{{Citation needed|reason=The left-wing criticism section does not seems to be a verifiable claim.|date=June 2018}}This "responsibility" for the murder would have been by creating an extreme hostile environment to the late Prime Minister, in which Yigal Amir and his immediate accomplices [[Hagai Amir]] and [[Dror Adani]] were just a small group of the actors.

A third type of criticism, by right-wing activists, claims that the mostly Israeli right-wing conspiracy supporters embarrass the Israeli right by supporting fringe theories for which no proof exists. The conspiracy theorists, according to this criticism, move the debate away from the responsibility of what they call the "perpetrators of the Oslo crimes". These right-wing critics conclude that the right-wing conspiracy theorists serve the goals of the Israeli left.&lt;ref name=Judea&gt;[http://www.voiceofjudea.com/eng/news.asp?news=90&amp;type=breaking "Rudstein – the man suing Peres admits he was FBI plant against right"], Voice of Judea TV, February 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

{{other uses|Elan Vital (disambiguation)}}

'''''Élan vital''''' ({{IPA-fr|elɑ̃.vital}}) is a term coined by [[France|French]] [[philosopher]] [[Henri Bergson]] in his 1907 book ''[[Creative Evolution (book)|Creative Evolution]]'', in which he addresses the question of self-organisation and spontaneous morphogenesis of things in an increasingly complex manner. ''Elan vital'' was translated in the English edition as "vital impetus", but is usually translated by his detractors as "vital force".  It is a hypothetical explanation for [[evolution]] and [[developmental biology|development]] of [[organisms]], which Bergson linked closely with [[consciousness]] – with the intuitive perception of experience and the flow of inner time.&lt;ref&gt;S. Atkinson ed., ''The Philosophy Book'' (2011) p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precursors==
Distant anticipations of Bergson can be found in the work of the pre-Christian [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Posidonius]], who postulated a "vital force" emanated by the sun to all living creatures on the Earth's surface, and in that of [[Zeno of Elea]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Benre, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (1976) p. 98-9&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of ''élan vital'' is also similar to [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s concept of the will-to-live.&lt;ref&gt;L. Vikka, ''The Intrinsic Value of Nature'' (1997) p. 56-7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later developments ==

It was believed by some that this essence (''élan vital'') could be harvested and embedded into an inanimate substance and activated with electricity, perhaps taking literally another of Bergson's metaphorical descriptions, the "current of life".{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The French philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]] attempted to recoup the novelty of Bergson's idea in his book ''Bergsonism'', though the term itself underwent substantial changes by Deleuze. No longer considered a [[mystical]], elusive force acting on brute matter, as it was in the [[vitalism|vitalist]] debates of the late 19th century, ''élan vital'' in Deleuze's hands denotes an internal force,&lt;ref&gt;K. Ansell-Pearson, ''Germinal Life'' (2012) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; a substance in which the distinction between organic and inorganic matter is indiscernible, and the emergence of life undecidable.

The notion of ''élan vital'' also had considerable influence on the psychiatrist and phenomenologist [[Eugène Minkowski]] and his own concept of a ''personal élan''&lt;ref&gt;H. Spiegelberg, ''Phenomenology in Psychology and Psychiatry'' (1972) p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; – the element which keeps us in touch with a feeling of life (and is lost in [[autism]]).&lt;ref&gt;J. Picchione, ''The New Avant-Garde in Italy'' (2004) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[French Army in World War I|French army]] incorporated the doctrine of ''élan vital'' into its thinking during the leadup to the [[First World War]] by arguing that the spirit of individual soldiers was more important for victory than weapons.&lt;ref name="MacMillan"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ZZapAQAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | title=The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914 | publisher=[[Random House]] | author=MacMillan, Margaret | authorlink=Margaret MacMillan | year=2013 | location=[[New York City|New York]] | pages=258 | isbn=978-1-4000-6855-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
* Current general consensus by geneticists is that they see no life force other than the organisational matrix contained in the [[genes]] themselves.&lt;ref&gt;R. F. Weir, ed., ''Genes and Human Self-Knowledge'' (1994) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[biologist]] [[Julian Huxley]] dryly remarked that Bergson’s ''élan vital'' is no better an explanation of life than is explaining the operation of a railway engine by its ''élan locomotif'' ("locomotive driving force"). The same alleged epistemological fallacy is parodied in [[Molière]]'s ''[[Le Malade imaginaire]]'', where a quack "answers" the question of "Why does [[opium]] cause sleep?" with "Because of its [[soporific]] power."&lt;ref&gt;'' Mihi a docto doctore / Demandatur causam et rationem quare / Opium facit dormire. / A quoi respondeo, / Quia est in eo / Vertus dormitiva, / Cujus est natura / Sensus assoupire.'' [[:s:fr:Le Malade imaginaire/3ème intermède|Le Malade imaginaire, (French Wikisource)]]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Huxley happily used the term ''élan vital'' in a more metaphorical sense, as may be seen from the following excerpt:
{{quote|"When I was just last in New York, I went for a walk, leaving Fifth Avenue and the Business section behind me, into the crowded streets near the Bowery. And while I was there, I had a sudden feeling of relief and confidence. There was Bergson’s ''élan vital''—there was assimilation causing life to exert as much pressure, though embodied here in the shape of men, as it has ever done in the earliest year of evolution: there was the driving force of progress"|lecture 1, n.p.,{{Citequote|date=August 2014}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20080806205313/http://library.rice.edu/collections/WRC/finding-aids/manuscripts/0050/ J. Huxley papers]}}

*Author and popular theologian [[C. S. Lewis|C.S. Lewis]] rejected Bergson's concept in his essay The Weight of Glory stating "...even if all the happiness they promised could come to man on earth, yet still each generation would lose it by death, including the last generation of all, and the whole story would be nothing, not even a story, for ever and ever. Hence all the nonsense that Mr. Shaw puts into the final speech of Lilith, and Bergson’s remark that the élan vital is capable of surmounting all obstacles, perhaps even death—as if we could believe that any social or biological development on this planet will delay the senility of the sun or reverse the second law of thermodynamics."&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis, Essay Collection'' (2000) p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;
