Today, he is best known for his expertise in [[tafsir|Qur'anic exegesis]], [[fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] and [[world history]], but he has been described as "an  impressively prolific [[polymath]].

==Biography==
[[image:قبر الامام الطبري 4.jpg|miniatur|thumb|upright=1|Tomb of at-Tabarīs in Bagdad, [[Iraq]]]]
Tabari was born in [[Amol]], [[Tabaristan]] (some 20&amp;nbsp;km south of the [[Caspian Sea]]) in the winter of 838–9.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Rosenthal, trans., ''The History of al-Ţabarī'' (State University of New York Press, 1989), Volume 1, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|He memorized the Qur'an]] at seven, was a qualified [[Imam|prayer leader]] at eight and began to study the [[hadith|prophetic traditions]] at nine. He left home to study in 236AH&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; (850–851AD) when he was twelve. He retained close ties to his home town. He returned at least twice, the second time in 290AH (903AD) when his outspokenness caused some uneasiness and led to his quick departure.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

He first went to [[Ray (city)|Rayy (Rhages)]], where he remained for some five years.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; A major teacher in Rayy was Abu Abdillah Muhammad ibn Humayd al-Razi, who had earlier taught in Baghdad but was now in his seventies.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal, p. 17"&gt;Rosenthal, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; While in Ray, he also studied Muslim [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]] according to the [[Hanafi]] school.&lt;ref name=devin325&gt;[[Devin J. Stewart]], "Muhammad b. Jarir al-Tabari's ''al-Bayan 'an Usul al-Ahkam'' and the Genre of Usul al-Fiqh in Ninth Century Baghdad," pg. 325. Taken from ''Abbasid Studies: Occasional Papers of the School of Abbasid Studies, Cambridge, 6–10 January 2002''. Edited by James Montgomery. [[Leuven]]: Peeters Publishers and the Department of Oriental Studies, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other material, ibn Humayd taught Jarir Tabari the historical works of [[ibn Ishaq]], especially ''[[Sirah Rasul Allah|al-Sirah]]'', his life of [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Tabari was thus introduced in youth to pre-Islamic and early Islamic history. Tabari quotes ibn Humayd frequently, but little is known about Tabari's other teachers in Rayy.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal, p. 17"/&gt;

Tabari then travelled to study in Baghdad under [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|ibn Hanbal]], who, however, had recently died (in late 855 or early 856).&lt;ref name="Rosenthal, p. 19"&gt;Rosenthal, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Tabari possibly made a pilgrimage prior to his first arrival in Baghdad.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal, p. 19"/&gt; He left Baghdad probably in 242 A.H. (856–7)&lt;ref name="Rosenthal, p. 20"&gt;Rosenthal, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; to travel through the southern cities of [[Basra]], [[Kufa]]h and [[Wasit]].&lt;ref name="Rosenthal, p. 19"/&gt; There, he met a number of eminent and venerable scholars.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal, p. 20"/&gt; In addition to his previous study of Hanafi law, Tabari also studied the [[Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Zahiri]] rites.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn al-Nadim]], ''al-Fihrist'', pg. 291. Ed. Rida Tajaddud. [[Tehran]]: Dar al-Masirah, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Tabari's study of the latter school was with the founder, [[Dawud al-Zahiri]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Melchert]], The Formation of the Sunni Schools of Law: 9th–10th Centuries C.E., pg. 185. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and Tabari hand-copied and transmitted many of his teacher's works.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yaqut al-Hamawi]], ''Irshad'', vol. 18, pg. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Tabari was, then, well-versed in four of the five remaining Sunni legal schools before founding his own independent, yet eventually extinct, school. His debates with his former teachers and classmates were known, and served as a demonstration of said independence.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, ''Tabari'', p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; Notably missing from this list is the [[Hanbali]] school, the fourth largest legal school within Sunni Islam in the present era. Tabari's view of Ibn Hanbal, the school's founder, became decidedly negative later in life. Tabari did not give Ibn Hanbal's dissenting opinion any weight at all when considering the various views of jurists, stating that Ibn Hanbal had not even been a jurist at all but merely a recorder of [[Hadith]].&lt;ref&gt;al-Hamawi, vol. 18, pg. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return to Baghdad, he took a tutoring position from the vizier, Ubaydallah ibn Yahya ibn Khaqan.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal, p. 21"&gt;Rosenthal, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; This would have been before A.H. 244 (858) since the vizier was out of office and in exile from 244 to 248 (858–9 to 862).&lt;ref name="Rosenthal, p. 21"/&gt; There is an anecdote told that Tabari had agreed to tutor for ten dinars a month, but his teaching was so effective and the boy's writing so impressive that the teacher was offered a tray of dinars and dirhams. The ever-ethical Tabari declined the offer saying he had undertaken to do his work at the specified amount and could not honourably take more.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal, p. 22"&gt;Rosenthal, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; That is one of a number of stories about him declining gifts or giving gifts of equal or greater amount in return.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal, p. 22"/&gt;

In his late twenties, he travelled to Syria, Palestine and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; In Beirut, he made the highly significant connection of al-Abbas b. al-Walid b. Mazyad al-'Udhri al-Bayruti (c.169-270/785-6 to 883–4). Al-Abbas instructed Tabari in the Syrian school's variant readings of the Qur'an and transmitted through his father al-Walid the legal views of [[Abd-al-Rahman al-Awzai|al-Awza'i]], Beirut's prominent jurist from a century earlier.{{Citation needed|date= February 2012}}

Tabari arrived in Egypt in 253AH (867),&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; and, some time after 256/870, he returned to Baghdad,&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; possibly making a pilgrimage on the way. If so, he did not stay long in the [[Hijaz]]. Tabari had a private income from his father while he was still living and then the inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; He took money for teaching. Among Tabari's students was [[Ibn al-Mughallis]], who was also a student of Tabari's own teacher [[Muhammad bin Dawud al-Zahiri]]; Ibn al-Mughallis lavished Tabari with almost excessive praise.&lt;ref&gt;History of the Prophets and Kings, trans. [[Franz Rosenthal]]. Vol. 1: General Introduction and From the Creation to the Flood, pg. 52. [[Albany, New York|Albany]]: [[SUNY Press]], 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boaz Shoshan, ''Poetics of Islamic Historiography: Deconstructing Ṭabarī's History'', introductio, pg. xxvi. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2004. {{ISBN|9004137939}}&lt;/ref&gt; He never took a government or a judicial position.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Tabari was some fifty years old when al-Mu'tadid became caliph. He was well past seventy in the year his ''History'' was published. During the intervening years, he was famous, if somewhat controversial, personality. Among the figures of his age, he had access to sources of information equal to anyone, except, perhaps, those who were directly connected with decision making within the government. Most, if not all, the materials for the histories of al-Mu'tadid, al-Muktafi, and the early years of al-Muqtadir were collected by him about the time the reported events took place. His accounts are as authentic as one can expect from that period.&lt;ref&gt;
Saliba, George. ''The History of Al-Ṭabarī = Taʻrīkh al-rusul wa ʻl-mulūk''. Vol. XXXVIII. New York: State University of New York, 1985. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tabari's final years were marked by conflict with the Hanbalite followers of [[Al-Hasan ibn 'Ali al-Barbahari]], a student of the students of Ibn Hanbal. Tabari was known for his view that Hanbalism was not a legitimate school of thought, as Ibn Hanbal was a compiler of traditions and not a proper jurist.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yaqut al-Hamawi]], Irshad, vol. 18, pg. 57-58.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hanbalites of Baghdad would often [[stoning|stone]] Tabari's house, escalating the persecution to the point where Abbasid authorities had to subdue them by force.&lt;ref&gt;History of the Prophets and Kings, General Introduction, And, From the Creation to the Flood, pg. 73. Trsn. Franz Rosenthal. SUNY Press, 1989. {{ISBN|9781438417837}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Baghdad chief of police tried to organize a debate between Tabari and the Hanbalites to settle their differences. While Tabari accepted, the Hanbalites did not show up but instead came later to pelt his house with stones again. The constant threat of violence from the Hanbalites hung over Tabari's head for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=frn78&gt;History, trns. Franz Rosenthal, pg. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal characteristics==
He is described as having a dark complexion, large eyes and a long beard. He was tall and slender&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; and his hair and beard remained black until he was very old. He was attentive to his health, avoiding red meat, fats and other foods he deemed unhealthy. He was seldom sick before his last decade when he suffered from bouts of pleurisy. When he was ill, he treated himself (to the approval of physicians).{{Citation needed|date= February 2012}} He had a sense of humour, though serious subjects he treated seriously. He had studied poetry when young and enjoyed writing, reciting and participating in poetic exchanges. It is said that he was asked in Egypt about al-Tirimmah and was able to recite this 7th century poet's work for Egyptians who had merely heard al-Tirimmah's name.&lt;ref&gt;The History of al-Tabari Vol. 1, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;
He was witty and urbane, clean and well mannered.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; He avoided coarse speech, instead displaying refined eloquence.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 4o&lt;/ref&gt; He had a good grounding in grammar, lexicography and philology. Such were considered essential for Qur'anic commentary. He knew Persian and was acquainted with the origins of various foreign loan words in Arabic from a number of other languages.

He died in [[Baghdad]] on February 17, 923.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
[[File:Qur'an Tabari.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Opening lines of the Quran from a Persian translation of Tabari's tafsir]]
&lt;!--No-source image [[Image:1-2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The first volume of the Persian translation of The commentary on the Qur'an]]--&gt;
Al-Tabari wrote [[history]], [[theology]] and [[Qur'an]]ic commentary. His legal writings were published first and then continued to appear throughout his life. Next were his commentaries on the Qur'an. Lastly, his history was published. His biographers stress his reverence for scholarship and  his keen intent to offer his readers hard fact.

He did not hesitate to express his independent judgement (''[[ijtihad]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; He stated his assessment as to which of the sources he cited was accurate. This was more understandably an aspect of his theology than of his history. This does not mean he saw himself as innovative. On the contrary, he was very much opposed to religious innovation. The story goes that when he was near death ibn Kamil suggested he forgive his enemies. He said he was willing to do so, except for the person who had described him as an innovator.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; In general Tabari's approach was conciliatory and moderate, seeking harmonious agreement between conflicting opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially he identified as a [[Shafi'ite]] in Fiqh law and Shafi'ites were happy to have him so considered. He was later seen {{By whom|date= February 2012}} as having established his own school. Although he had come to Baghdad in youth to study from Hanbal, he incurred the vehement wrath of the [[Hanbalite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Tabari's [[madhhab]] is usually designated by the name [[Jariri]] after his [[patronymic]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the keenly competitive atmosphere of the times, his school failed to endure.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

While we still lack a satisfactory scholarly biography of this remarkable scholar, interested readers now have access to a meticulous and well-annotated translation of the sections from al-Tabari's chronicle, which constitute the most important primary source for the
history of his reign. Anyone familiar with al-Tabari's chronicle knows what a formidable challenge it poses for a translator, especially for one attempting to make it accessible to an audience that includes non-specialists. There is, first of all, the obstacle of al-Tabari's Arabic prose, which varies greatly in style and complexity according to the source he is using (and apparently quoting verbatim). The sections in the McAuliffe translation, drawn mostly from [[al-Mada'ini]] and '[[Umar ibn Shabba]], do not represent the most obscure passages to be found in al-Tabari, but they are nonetheless full of linguistic ambiguities and difficulties for the translator.&lt;ref&gt;
The History of al-Tabari (Tarikh al-Rusul Walmuluk). Vol. XXVIII: Abbasid Authority Affirmed, the Early Years of al-Mansur A.D. 753-763/A.H. 136–145 by Al-Tabari (Abu Jafar Muhammad Ibn Jarir); Jane Dammen McAuliffe, Review by: {{cite journal | last1 = Daniel | first1 = Elton L. | year = 1997 | title = Review | journal = International Journal of Middle East Studies | volume = 29 | issue = 2| pages = 287–289 | jstor=164026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote extensively; his voluminous corpus containing three main titles:

*''[[History of the Prophets and Kings (book)|History of the Prophets and Kings]]'' – (Arabic: تاريخ الرسل والملوك, ''Tarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk'', commonly called ''Tarikh al-Tabari'')

The first of the two large works, generally known as the ''Annals'' (Arabic ''Tarikh al-Tabari''). This is a [[universal history]] from the time of Qur'anic [[Creation myth|Creation]] to 915, and is renowned for its detail and accuracy concerning [[Muslim]] and [[Middle East]]ern history. Tabari's work is one of the major primary sources for historians.

*''[[The commentary on the Qur'an (book)|The Commentary on the Qur'an]]'' – (Arabic: جامع البيان عن تأويل آي القرآن, ''Jami` al-bayan `an ta'wil 'ay al-Qur'an'', commonly called ''Tafsir al-Tabari'')

His second great work was the commentary on the [[Qur'an]], (Arabic ''Tafsir al-Tabari''), which was marked by the same fullness of detail as the ''Annals''. Abul-Qaasim Ibn 'Aqil Al-Warraq  (رحمه الله) says: " Imām Ibn Jarir (رحمه الله) once said to his students: “Are you all ready to write down my lesson on the Tafsir (commentary) of the entire Holy Quran?" They enquired as to how lengthy it would be. "30 000 pages"! he replied. They said: "This would take a long time and cannot be completed in one lifetime. He therefore made it concise and kept it to 3000 pages (note, this was in reference to the old days when they used ink and hard-paper which was a bit long format today). It took him seven years to finish it from the year 283 until 290. It is said {{By whom|date= February 2012}} that it is the most voluminous Athari Tafsir (i.e., based on hadith not intellect) existent today so well received by the Ummah that it survived to this day intact due to its popularity and widely printed copies available worldwide. Scholars such as [[Baghawi]] and [[Suyuti]] used it largely. It was used in compiling the [[Tafsir ibn Kathir]] which is often referred to as Mukhtasar Tafsir at-Tabari.

*''[[Tahdhib al-Athar|Tahdhīb al-Athār]]'' (تهذيب الآثار) was begun by Tabari. This was on the traditions transmitted from the [[Sahaba|Companions]] of [[Muhammad]]. It was not, however, completed.

A persual of Tabari shows that in fact he relied on a variety of historians and other authors such as Abu Mihnaf, Sayf b. 'Umar, Ibn al-Kalbi, 'Awana b. al-Hakam, Nasr b. Muzahim, al-Mada'ini, 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr, al-Zuhri, Ibn Ishaq, Waqidi, Wahb b. Munabbih, Ka'b al-Ahbar, Ibn al-Matni, al Haggag b. al-Minhal, Hisham b. 'Urwa, al-Zubayr b. Bakkar and so forth, in addition to oral accounts that were circulating at the time.
In recounting his history, Tabari used numerous channels to give accounts. These are both channels that are given by the same author in a work, such as for example three different accounts that start with the isnad al-Harita.&lt;ref&gt;

==Texts relating to al-Tabari==
It is thus an extremely early witness to the reception of al-Tabari's text-indeed much earlier than the sources that are customarily pressed into service to improve our understanding of the ''Ta'rikh al-rusul wa-l-muluk'', e.g., Miskawayh, Ibn 'Asakir, Ibn al-Athir, and Ibn Khallikan. Second, since al-Azdi was writing in the decades following al-Tabari, his ''Ta'rikh'' can say something about the reception of al-Tabari's ''Ta'rikh'' among those who immediately followed the great master. That al-Tabari's history was immensely significant we can all agree; but as to precisely how he became so significant there is no clear consensus.8 Third-and returning to Forand's insight-al-Azdi frequently drew on the same authorities tapped by al-Tabari, but whose works are for the most part now lost, such as Abu Ma'shar (170/786), Abu Mikhnaf (157/774), al-Haytham ibn 'Adi (207/822), al-Mada'ini (around 228/843), and 'Umar ibn Shabba (262/878).&lt;ref&gt;A Local Historian's Debt to al-Ṭabarī: The Case of al-Azdī's ''Ta'rīkh al-Mawṣil'', Chase F. Robinson, ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 126, No. 4 (October – December 2006), pp. 521–535, Published by: American Oriental Society, Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/20064541.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 78.29 the Qur'an says "each thing we enumerate as [or in] a kitab", and al-Tabari appends to the verse by way of elaboration
"its number, its amount, and its extent-the knowledge of (any) thing does not escape us" (XXX: 10). This might suggest that al-Tabari considered kitab merely as a metaphor for Allah's knowledge. However, from al-Tabari's comments elsewhere on Allah's knowledge it is quite evident that he is not speaking metaphorically. For example, in 35.11 where the Qur'an states that the length or shortness of a person's life is in a kitab is explained by al-Tabari as "it is in a kitab with Allah, written (''maktab'') which he computes and knows" (XXII: 71-2).&lt;ref&gt;Ṭabarī's Exegesis of the Qur'ānic Term al-Kitāb, Herbert Berg, Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Vol. 63, No. 4 (Winter 1995), pp. 761–774, Published by: Oxford University Press, Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1465467&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Tabari reports that al-Mahdi was just about to promote Harun as heir apparent ahead of Musa when he died, and adds by way of corroboration another report that al-Mahdi set off for Masabadhan in a great hurry. However, it may be doubted that al-Mahdi at the time shared the reporter's subsequent knowledge of his imminent demise there, and none of the other reported circumstances of his death suggest that he was in a hurry to go anywhere. On the contrary, the sources in general make it clear that he had gone to Masabadhan for recreation, and they occasionally say so explicitly. Al-Tabari does say explicitly that envoys were sent to the provinces, where they obtained the oath of allegiance not only to al-Hadi as caliph but also to Harun as heir apparent (''wali l-'ahd'') (38). This was probably the first occasion on which Harun was so acknowledged. Harun himself, with the advice of al-Rabi', sent out these envoys, and all of this must have been presented to his brother on his return as a fait accompli.&lt;ref&gt;"The Succession to the Caliph Mūsā al-Hādī", Richard Kimber, ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 121, No. 3 (July – September 2001), pp. 428–448, Published by: American Oriental Society, Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/606671&lt;/ref&gt;

After so many exchanges of recrimination with his own men, and after various attempts to regroup what was becoming a progressively disorderly army, 'Ali is reported by Tabari in a most revealing passage to have explained his acceptance of the arbitration as such: "It is no sin but only a failure of judgement." Nothing sums up the moral and religious complexity of the situation better than this sentence. The group that made a big issue of 'Ali's dilemma were the Kharijites, who for reasons of their own could see clearly the religious and political issues involved, who agreed neither with 'Ali nor with his opponent but were in turn incapable of administering a polity of their own. Tabari's account also brings that out very clearly when he relates (p.&amp;nbsp;115) how the assembled Kharijites, who were quite willing to expound the reasons for their recession from 'Ali's forces, would one by one refuse to take the leadership of their own group, a situation quite characteristic of religious purists when confronted with "dirty" politics.&lt;ref&gt;''Tarikh al-rusul wa-l-muluk'' (History of Prophets and Kings), the History of al-Tabari, vol. XVII, the First Civil War by Abu Ja'far Jarir Ibn Muhammad al-Tabari; G. R. Hawting, Review by: George Saliba, International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 30, No. 1 (February  1998), pp. 125–127, Published by: Cambridge University Press, Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/164211&lt;/ref&gt;

Realistic depictions alternate with formalized and archetypal narrative.
Tabari is careful to give his reports of these conquests a religious frame (expressions such as "Nu'aym wrote to 'Umar about the victory that God had given him" [pp.&amp;nbsp;25–26] abound), though it is worth noting that Tabari describes the initiation of the campaign in pragmatic rather than ideological terms. He states that 'Umar's decision to invade came as a result of his realization "that Yazdajird was making war on him every year and when it was suggested to him that he would continue to do this until he was driven out of his kingdom" (p.&amp;nbsp;2). The religious frame in Tabari's account is therefore not inflexible or exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;The History of al-Tabari (Tarikh al-rusul wal-muluk). Vol. XIV: The Conquest of Iran by al-Tabari; G.

[[File:Roussillon - Carte de Nicolas de Fer (1706).jpg|thumb|Map of the province of Roussillon by Nicolas de Fer (1706)]]
  
The '''Angelets''', or “the Angelets of the Earth” (in Catalan, ''“els Angelets de la Terra”''), were peasants who rose up from 1667 to 1675 against the French authorities of the [[Roussillon]] province. The group of conflicts of the period is subsumed under the name of “the '''Revolt of the Angelets'''”. The cause was the instituting of the [[gabelle]] (salt tax) in 1661 — a measure contrary to traditional constitutions of the earldom (the earldom of Roussillon and [[Cerdanya]], the lands of the crown of [[Majorca]] from 1276 to 1344).

The revolt first concerned the county of [[Vallespir]], then it won those of [[Conflent]] and Roussillon.

== The name ==

[[File:Guido Reni 031.jpg|thumb|The archangel of Saint Michael]]
The reason why the revolts are referred to as “angelets” is unknown. One of the explanations advanced is the popular belief according to which the angels know the mountains well; another is the faculty that they have of appearing and disappearing.

As for the word ''“miquelets,”'' it refers primarily to Catalan mercenaries but sometimes to armed peasants. There is thus confusion among the ancient authors, particularly in relation to the war of Holland: They designate under the name “''miquelets''” all those who, in the province of Roussillon, oppose the king of France — though it be angelets or Catalan mercenaries in the service of the king of Spain.

[[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] is the patron saint of the miquelets and the wool-workers of [[Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste|Prats-de-Mollo]], he who gave a sacred tint to one revolt that reclaimed liberties with the patriotic cry of ''“Visca la terra!”'' (“Long live the Land!”)

== Context ==

On May 8, 1659, the [[Reapers' War|Catalan Revolt]] came to an end, and on November 7, the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] was signed between the Spanish and the French monarchies. The agreement notably foresaw a sharing of the principality of Catalonia between the two sovereigns. The crown of France annexed five [[Comarques of Catalonia|comarques]] (corresponding to the two [[Counts]], minus lower Cerdanya and [[Llívia]]):

* the comarque of Roussillon
* Vallespir
* Conflent
* [[Capcir]]
* the burghs and villages of [[French Cerdagne]], that is the east of the count of Cerdagne

[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] engaged himself with respecting the local customs.  But, since June 1660, he replaced Catalan institutions and agencies with his own political, judiciary, and fiscal structures.  He created a sovereign Council at [[Perpignan]]. Then he named a steward.

Resistance to the new master began in March 1661. Having come to settle a disagreement between the inhabitants of [[Ayguatébia-Talau|Ayguatébia]] and those of [[Oreilla]], the viguier (magistrate) Marsal was violently attacked.  He succeeded in escaping, but the notary and the domestic who accompanied him were killed.  Immediately, the comarque of Conflent was subjected to a tax intended to pay the sometent français (the militia).

=== The Gabelle ===

The [[gabelle]], a tax on salt, had been abolished by the Catalan courts since the time of King [[James II of Majorca]], in 1283. In 1661, the French reestablished it. Its revenue was intended to finance the maintenance and construction of fortresses, as well as the payment of French functionaries. The measure was very unpopular. The king of France’s misuse of this tax’s revenue — to the detriment of Perpignan, which was only cashing an insignificant part of it — was considered an abjuration of the royal oath to respect the capital privileges of the comarque of Roussillon. The consuls of Perpignan protested. But the sovereign Council’s decision rejected the municipal complaint and imposed the will of the Louvre.

In Vallespir, a country of pastures, salt was necessary for feeding livestock and preserving meat. The inhabitants sent for it from the other side of the wholly new border. The tax made its price rise inordinately. In 1667, the peasants of Vallespir refused to pay it.

== The First Revolt (1667–68) ==

Smuggling was organized. The inspectors tracked down the traffickers in order to try to put an end to this activity. The peasants reacted, transforming themselves into veritable guerrilla fighters, harassing the French soldiers and especially the functionaries of the salt tax. An armed resistance was organized under the leadership of Joseph of Trinxeria, a merchant of Prats-de-Mollo.

The insurgents spread themselves in the county of Vallespir. In 1667, they hid in the villages of [[Serralongue]] and [[Montferrer]]. The following year, they attacked the hotel of [[Amélie-les-Bains-Palalda|Amélie-les-Bains]], where the tax collectors are housed. They besieged the deputy provost Maniel in the church of [[Saint-Laurent-de-Cerdans]]. The repression did not rest: eight inhabitants were condemned to death and 51 put into slavery. This did nothing to discourage the smugglers.

The president of the sovereign Council, the collaborator Francesc de Segarra, offered a reward of 100 gold ''doubles tournois'' (coins) to whoever would give information against the leaders of the resistance. On September 14, 1668, he left with 300 soldiers to make base at [[Arles]] in order to begin a harsh suppression. The punitive expedition was routed at Llop pass and had to retreat to Arles.

For several years, the rebels, knowing the terrain well, inflicted substantial losses on the French troops.   From August 3, 1667 to June 30, 1668, they also pursued and eliminated a good number of salt tax inspectors.

The authorities of the salt tax resolved to negotiate: The armed struggle ceased and, in exchange, the townships of Vallespir could obtain smuggled salt. Through the “Compromise of [[Céret]],” the salt tax inspectors began to put an end to the controls and to coordinate with the council of each village, as to who would be charged from then on with the distribution of salt to the inhabitants.

== The Second Revolt (1670–74) ==

[[File:1674 - Plan bataille Maureillas.jpg|thumb|Battle plan near Maureillas in 1674]]
In 1669, in Conflent, Joan Miquel Mestre, called “the Righteous Heir,” demanded a similar arrangement for [[Baillestavy]]. From September to November, he kept track of the customs officers. It was at that moment that the revolts were referred to under the name of “angelets.”  Mestre was stopped by chance on the road from [[Camprodon]] on January 22, 1670 by the governor of Prats-de-Mollo. This set off a revolt on the part of the inhabitants, led by Josep de la Trinxeria and his lieutenant Damià Nohell, son of the mayor of Serralongue. They took the governor’s wife and children hostage and negotiated their release in return for that of the Righteous Heir. The exchange completed, the angelets returned via [[Tech (river)|the Tech]], seeing their troops grow to 1,500 men.

At this moment the revolt not only began again but also intensified considerably. The fighting stretched to all of Vallespir: On February 27, 1670, the insurgents seized Arles, from which they chased the garrison and killed the mayor. From March 31 to April 2, they besieged Céret, the capital of Vallespir.

The angelets held the high valley of Tech as well as Conflent. This was when the French sent an army of 4,000 soldiers. Avoiding offering an easy target on the route from the valley, they progressed through the mountains of Haut-Conflent that separated the two comarques, in order to take Vallespir from the rear. The technique of guerrilla warfare did not allow for maintaining a lined-up battle, on open terrain, facing a complete army: On May 5, the angelets were defeated at the Queen’s Pass, at the food of the Guillem Flat.   Some took refuge in the principality of Catalonia; others hid in the mountains.   The last bastion of the angelets having been defeated, the village of Py was sentenced to be razed.   Salt had to be scattered over its ruins.

=== Beginnings of the War of Holland ===

Hostilities were revived by the [[Franco-Dutch War]] (1672–78), of which the Spanish front became one of the theaters. The struggle of the population then took the character of an anti-French uprising. The angelets collaborated with the Spanish monarchy (1673).

The village and church of Ayguatébia were burned by French troops on February 7, 1673.

The year 1674 was particularly difficult for the French, in the province of Roussillon. They would face conspiracies (Villefranche and Perpignan) and an entry of Spanish troops.

=== The Villefranche Conspiracy ===

The angelets were involved in the Villefranche Conspiracy, which aimed to reunite the Counties at the principality of Catalonia, on “Holy Saturday” in 1674.

The conspiracy was discovered. Its leader, Manuel Descatllar, was arrested. He was transferred to Perpignan where, under terrible torture, he confessed all his activities. He was executed in the square of [[La Loge, Pas-de-Calais|La Loge]] on April 20, 1674. As for his companion Francesc Puig i Terrats, he was condemned to death and had his throat cut in public, in front of his own house, on May 16. His body was quartered. The four parts of him were exhibited at four points in the city. Many other conspirators paid for their involvement through the loss of their civic and patrimonial rights.

=== Repression and End of the Revolt ===

The population was always in question. The king of Spain’s troops crossed the frontier and took the fort of Bellegarde (beginning 1674). They controlled a great part of the province (Cerdagne and Vallespir, a part of Roussillon and of Conflent) after they won the [[Battle of Maureillas]] over the French army on July. It was only in 1675 that the [[Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg|Count of Schomberg]], taking advantage of the Spanish withdrawal of troops to face the recent [[Revolt of Messina]], took back Bellegarde and routed them once and for all.

The region was now overrun with the French troops. The repression reached the whole population: imprisonment, sentencing to the galleys, executions, confiscation of goods, and heavy fines imposed on the communes (that of Prats-de-Mollo was of 3,500 pounds, that of Saint-Laurent was of 1,600 pounds).

The revolt of the angelets was considered finished in 1675.

The hatreds were so exacerbated, and the cost of suppression was so high, that Louis XIV tried to exchange the Counties in return for Flanders. But [[Charles II of Spain]] refused.

The revolt being completely put out, the king of France renounced this exchange during negotiations of the [[Treaties of Nijmegen|Treaty of Nijmegen]], which put an end, in 1678, to the Franco-Dutch War.

'''Banknotes of Demerary and Essequibo''', issued from 1809{{Sfn|Hazlitt|1896|p=241}} through 1839{{Sfn|Royal Gazette Office|1863|p=9}} were dual-denominated in [[Guilder]]s and ''Joes'', a term used by the British colonists to refer to the Portuguese gold Johannes coin{{Sfn|Halliday|1837|p=192}} and the notes that eventually replaced them.{{Sfn|Dalton|1855|p=291}} Despite roughly 30 years of use, the only ''Joes'' known to exist are unissued remainders from the 1830s.{{Sfn| Cuhaj |2010|p=153}}

==History==

Dating back to at least 1798, the main unit of monetary exchange in the colonies of [[Demerara]] and [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]] was the Portuguese gold Johannes coin{{Sfn|Chalmers|1893|p=94}} which were valued at 22 Dutch guilders.{{Sfn|Royal Gazette Office|1863|p=9}} Exchange rates in the United States in 1797 valued the Portuguese Johannes at $16 (the Spanish [[doubloon]] at $14.93, and the English silver [[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]] at $0.22).{{Sfn|Bates|2015|p=674}} Due to clipping and boring (replaced with brass or copper){{Sfn|Dalton|1855|p=291}} these coins (colloquially referred to as a ''Joe''){{Sfn|Dalton|1855|p=290}} began to lose their intrinsic value. An initial attempt was made to counterstamp or [[chop mark]] valid coins.{{Sfn|Chalmers|1893|p=94}} Eventually (1809) the coins were recalled by the authorities and paper currency, denominated in both Guilders and ''Joes'' were issued.{{Sfn|Royal Gazette Office|1863|p=9}}

==Issuance==

The new paper issue of 1809 introduced 50,000 ''Joes'' equivalent to 1,100,000 guilders.{{Sfn|Dalton|1855|p=291}} This was followed by an additional 25,807 ''Joes'' in 1815–16,{{Sfn|Dalton|1855|p=292}} and 24,193 more in 1824 for a total circulation of just under 100,000 ''Joes''.{{Sfn|Dalton|1855|p=360}} Deemed to be a legal tender,{{Sfn|Dalton|1855|p=291}}{{Sfn|Royal Gazette Office|1863|p=9}} the notes were partially backed by securities in London,{{Sfn|Royal Gazette Office|1863|p=9}} though their ability to be redeemed for gold was questionable.{{Sfn|Chalmers|1893|p=135}}

By 1837, records indicate that 99,989 ''Joes'' had been issued in the following denominations: 1 ''Joe'' (13,258 notes), 2 ''Joes'' (8,189), 3 ''Joes'' (4,201), 5 ''Joes'' (3,150), 10 ''Joes'' (1,700), and 20 ''Joes'' (1,250).{{Sfn| Martin |1839|p=134}} By 1839, there had been reference to a ''half-Joe''.{{Sfn|M’Dermott|1870|p=242}}

==Currently known specimen==

The [[Standard Catalog of World Paper Money]] lists only the unissued remainders of the 1830s. The two issues are distinguished by several design features including an ornate D-E in the upper center (first issue) or a woman with an anchor in the upper left (second issue).{{Sfn| Cuhaj |2010|p=153}}  In addition, the wording of the denomination differs between the series. The first issue lists two denominations: 1 ''Joe'' or 22 Guilders and 10 ''Joes'' or 220 Guilders; the second issue lists four denominations: 1 ''Joe'' of 22 Guilders, 2 ''Joes'' of 22 Guilders each, 3 ''Joes'' of 22 Guilders each, and 10 ''Joes'' of 22 Guilders each.{{Sfn| Cuhaj |2010|p=153}} The illustrated 20 ''Joe'' note is a recent discovery (for the 1830s issue) in the [[National Numismatic Collection]].

'''Barbara Denise Craig''' (née '''Chapman'''; 22 October 1915 – 25 January 2005) was a British [[archaeologist]], [[classicist]], and academic, specialising in [[Classical antiquity|classical]] [[pottery]]. From 1967 to 1980, she was [[Principal (academia)|Principal]] of [[Somerville College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="obit - Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dauphin|first1=Claudine|title=Barbara Craig|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/feb/19/guardianobituaries.highereducation|accessdate=8 April 2015|work=The Guardian|date=19 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="obit - Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|title=Barbara Craig|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1482718/Barbara-Craig.html|accessdate=8 April 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=4 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="obit - Independent"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adams|first1=Pauline|title=Barbara Craig: Archaeologist Principal of Somerville|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/barbara-craig-9836.html|accessdate=8 April 2015|work=The Independent|date=7 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Barbara Denise Chapman was born on 22 October 1915 in [[Calcutta]], [[British Raj]].&lt;ref name="obit - Guardian" /&gt; Her father was [[librarian]] of the Imperial Library of Calcutta (now the [[National Library of India]]).&lt;ref name="obit - Telegraph" /&gt; In 1920, she moved to [[London]], England, with her mother and siblings; her father remained in India.&lt;ref name="obit - Independent" /&gt; She was educated at [[Haberdashers' Aske's School for Girls]], an [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent school]] in [[Acton, London]].&lt;ref name="obit - Telegraph" /&gt;

Having won a [[scholarship]] to the [[University of Oxford]], and under the influence of her uncle [[Robert William Chapman (scholar)|R. W. Chapman]], she [[matriculated]] into [[Somerville College, Oxford]] in 1934 to study [[classics]]. During her degree, she specialised in [[ancient history]] and [[classical archaeology]].&lt;ref name="obit - Guardian" /&gt; One of her lecturers was [[Theodore Wade-Gery|H. T. Wade Gery]], who encouraged her interest in ancient history rather than Latin or Greek.&lt;ref name="obit - Telegraph" /&gt; She graduated in 1938 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) degree, having gained [[first class honours]] in both ''[[Honour Moderations|Mods]]'' and ''[[Literae Humaniores|Greats]]''.&lt;ref name="obit - Independent" /&gt;

==Career==
Craig's early career suggested a future in academia. After her [[double first]], she was awarded the Craven fellowship and the Goldsmith's senior studentship to fund further study.&lt;ref name="obit - Guardian" /&gt; She then travelled to Italy to undertake research and further study at the [[British School in Rome]]. There, she studied the historical background to [[Greek lyric poetry]] and the [[Sicily#Greek and Roman period|ancient history of Sicily]].&lt;ref name="obit - Independent" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit - Times" /&gt; She spent some time travelling alone in Sicily looking at ancient sites. Having moved away from the regular tourist sites, she found herself in the interior of the island where a large number of Italy's arms factories were based. Unable to convince a police officer that an attractive, young woman with binoculars was not spying in the factories, she was arrested. Luckily for her, the local police chief believed her account of being a tourist and scholar with a passion for [[birdwatching]], and she was released.&lt;ref name="obit - Telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit - Independent" /&gt;

With the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, she had to return to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="obit - Telegraph" /&gt; For a year, she worked as a temporary [[civil servant]] in the [[Ministry of Supply]] and the [[Ministry of Labour (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Labour]].&lt;ref name="obit - Times" /&gt; She then had the opportunity to return to academia. Between 1940 and 1942, she was the assistant to the Professor of Greek at the [[University of Aberdeen]].&lt;ref name="obit - Independent" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit - Times" /&gt; She then once became a civil servant: she was assistant principal of the [[Ministry of Home Security]] and the [[Ministry of Production]]. By the end of the war, she held the position of principal.&lt;ref name="obit - Independent" /&gt;

In 1945, her husband joined the [[British Council]], an organisation that promotes British interests abroad through international education and other opportunities.&lt;ref name="obit - Guardian" /&gt; This was the beginning of two decades spent in various foreign countries, with Barbara acting as hostess at any official occasion.&lt;ref name="obit - Independent" /&gt; However, she did have time to continue her own interests, in addition to supporting her husband. From 1951 to 1956, while the couple were based in [[Iraq]], she was involved in [[Max Mallowan]]'s [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] at [[Nimrud]].&lt;ref name="obit - Guardian" /&gt; In 1954, she was elected to the Katharine and Leonard Woolley Fellowship in Archaeology at [[Somerville College, Oxford]], her [[alma mater]]. This gave her the funding to carry out research on the relations between [[Ancient Greece]] and the [[Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref name="obit - Independent" /&gt; From 1956, she was involved in excavations at [[Mycenae]] under [[Alan Wace|Sir Alan Wace]], then under Lord William Taylour.&lt;ref name="obit - Guardian" /&gt; As she was not a trained field archaeologist, her main contributions were the classification of pottery. She was greatly skilled at this and became an expert in [[Mycenaean pottery]].&lt;ref name="obit - Telegraph" /&gt;

In 1965, the couple finally returned to the United Kingdom and set up a permanent home in London.&lt;ref name="obit - Times" /&gt; She continued her involvement in archaeological excavations at Mycenae and in [[Laconia]], Greece, during the summer months.&lt;ref name="obit - Telegraph" /&gt; In February 1966, she was elected [[Principal (academia)|Principal]] of [[Somerville College, Oxford]]. She took up the appointment in October 1967, succeeding [[Janet Vaughan|Dame Janet Vaughan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Principal For Somerville|work=The Times|issue=56545|date=2 February 1966|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under her leadership, the college doubled in size and rose to the top of the [[Norrington Table]], the annual ranking of colleges by degree classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From strength to strength |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/3351/From%20strength%20to%20strength.html |website=Somerville College |publisher=University of Oxford |accessdate=9 April 2015 |date=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323102325/http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/3351/From%20strength%20to%20strength.html |archivedate=23 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The college celebrated its centenary in 1979, and she used the opportunity to fund raise.&lt;ref name="obit - Times" /&gt; She retired in 1980 and was appointed an [[honorary fellow]] of Somerville College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=University news|work=The Times|issue=60789|date=29 November 1980|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
She met her future husband, James Craig, when they were both at the [[British School at Rome]] in 1938;&lt;ref name="obit - Independent" /&gt; she was studying and he was the BSR's secretary and librarian. They married in 1942.&lt;ref name="obit - Guardian" /&gt; A serious road accident in 1986 left her husband disabled and using a wheelchair. She cared for him until his death in 1989.&lt;ref name="obit - Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Barbara Craig|work=The Times|issue=68305|date=8 February 2005|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not have any children.&lt;ref name="obit - Guardian" /&gt;

She was a [[Christian]] and a practising [[Anglican]].&lt;ref name="obit - Guardian" /&gt;

'''Benjamin Henri Isaac''' ({{lang-he|בנימין איזק}}; born May 10, 1945) is the Fred and Helen Lessing Professor of Ancient History Emeritus at [[Tel Aviv University]]. He is a member of the [[Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140820222427/http://www.academy.ac.il/English/asp/members/members_in.asp?person_id=133 Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities website]&lt;/ref&gt; and of the American Philosophical Society &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amphilsoc.org/members American Philosophical Society website]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life and education==
Isaac was born in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], where his parents settled in 1942 after fleeing the [[Netherlands]] during [[World War II]]. He grew up in [[Amsterdam]] and studied classics, ancient history and archaeology at [[Amsterdam University]]. In 1972, he moved to [[Israel]] and began teaching at [[Tel Aviv University]].  In 1980, he received his PhD (summa cum laude) for a thesis on the Greek settlements in [[Thrace]] until the Macedonian conquest. &lt;ref&gt;''The Greek Settlements in Thrace until the Macedonian Conquest'', (Brill, Leiden 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; He has held visiting appointments at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], Princeton, NJ (twice), [[All Souls College]], [[Oxford]], [[Dumbarton Oaks]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Churchill College]] [[Cambridge]], the [[National Humanities Center]], [[North Carolina]], [[Harvard University]] and the [[Collège de France]].

==Career==
Isaac’s research covers the period from the 6th century BCE until the 7th century CE.  It deals with Greek and Roman history and with Jewish history from the 2nd century BCE onward.  He has been member of a team surveying the [[Roman roads]] in [[Judaea]]/[[Syria Palaestina|Palaestina]] with [[Moshe Fischer]] and [[Israel Roll]],&lt;ref&gt;B. Isaac and I. Roll, ''Roman Roads in Judaea, I, The Scythopolis-Legio Road'', (Oxford, B.A.R., 1982); M.Fischer, B. Isaac and I. Roll, ''Roman Roads in Judaea, ii, The Jaffa - Jerusalem Roads'' (B.A.R. International Series, Oxford 1996),&lt;/ref&gt; and of a group preparing a corpus of ancient inscriptions in all relevant languages from the region, the [[Corpus Inscriptionum Iudaeae/Palaestinae]].

His work on the [[imperial Roman army]] and [[imperialism]] traces various functions of the provincial army.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Isaac ''The Limits of Empire: the Roman Army in the East'' (Oxford University Press, second ed. 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;  It was commonly assumed that the main function of the Roman army was the defence of the frontier provinces against foreign enemies.  Isaac argues that it had two different tasks, internal police functions and preparation for further expansion. Rome had an [[ideology]] of offence and expansion rather than preservation of the status quo and defence.  In this connection Isaac has argued that the concept of an imperial frontier was irrelevant in Roman terms.  The Empire was not a territorial concept, but one that expressed rule over peoples and cities.  Another topic of this book is the question whether Rome had a “[[Grand strategy]]” as had been argued.  Isaac has shown that this reflects a modern concept that could not apply to ancient reality.

His book on the ideological roots of [[racism]] argues that racism must be distinguished from other forms of [[prejudice]] and [[stereotypes]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity'' (Princeton University Press 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a rationalization and systematization of prejudice first encountered in the 5th century BCE in Greece as a result of the development of abstract thinking in contemporary philosophy and medical science.  The concept of [[environmental determinism]] was developed at this time and has been accepted as valid until very recently.  It assumes that geography, climate and other external realities impose definite and unchangeable qualities, physical and mental on entire groups of people.  As such it preceded [[social Darwinism]] as an attempt to rationalize group prejudice.  It played a role too in imperialist [[ideology]] because it was used to distinguish between superior and inferior peoples.  These concepts were taken over by Roman authors and by those who, in later times, used them for similar or related purposes.  Thus Isaac argues that the history and development of racism as an ideology has roots going back to Graeco-Roman antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;See the recent conference proceedings: Miriam Eliav-Feldon,  Benjamin Isaac and Joseph Ziegler (eds.),  ''The Origins of Racism in the West'' (Cambridge University Press, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaac is the author of numerous articles.&lt;ref&gt;''The Near East under Roman Rule: Selected Papers'' (Brill, Leiden 1998); ''Empire and Ideology in the Graeco-Roman World: Selected Papers'' (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;; He is also member of a team working on the publication of a corpus of all ancient inscriptions from [[Judaea]] / [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] &lt;ref&gt;The following volumes have come out so far: ''Corpus Inscriptionum Iudaeae/Palaestinae'' Volume I Jerusalem, Part I (Berlin: De Gruyter 2010), Part II (Berlin: De Gruyter 2012), Volume II Caesarea and the Middle Coast (Berlin: De Gruyter 2011), Volume III The South Coast (Berlin: De Gruyter 2014), Volume IV Parts 1 and 2 Iudaea / Idumaea (Berlin: De Gruyter 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;.  Since 2015 he is the Editor-in-Chief of the Israelic classics journal ''Scripta Classica Israelica.''

==Awards and recognition==

'''The Civic Trust''' of England was a [[charitable organization|charitable organisation]] founded in 1957. It ceased operations in 2009 and went into administration due to lack of funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civic Trust in administration|url=http://www.landscape.co.uk/news/601|work=Landscape Design Trust|accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The '''Civic Society Initiative''' was set up in 2009 with the support of [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|The National Trust]], [[Campaign to Protect Rural England|CPRE]] and other organisations to ensure a future for the civic society movement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | title = The National Trust Magazine
  | journal = News
  | issue = Autumn 2009
  |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was formally launched in April 2010 as '''Civic Voice'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New national civic charity launches in England|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8626676.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=9 January 2012|date=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Original function==
Civic Trust's prime purpose was to improve the quality of new and historic buildings and public spaces, and to help improve the general quality of urban life. The trust operated from two main offices, in [[London]] and [[Liverpool]] and supported a national network of [[civic society|civic societies]]. These were local groups in which volunteer members helped to improve their surroundings. It ran the Civic Trust Regeneration Unit, which supported urban renewal through programmes addressing issues of concern such as "the night time economy". It ran campaigns to influence and change thinking on civic matters, and change government policy. It helped establish [[conservation area]]s and coordinate [[Heritage Open Days]].

==Civic Trust Awards==
{{main|Civic Trust Awards}}
The [[Civic Trust Awards]] was established in 1959 to recognise outstanding architecture, urban design, landscape and public are which improve the quality of life for local communities. Whilst the Civic Trust as an umbrella organisation went into Administration in April 2009, the Civic Trust Awards have continued as an independent scheme operating on a not-for-profit basis as a [[Community Interest Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Civic Trust Awards|url=http://www.civictrustawards.org.uk/about/|work=Civic Trust Awards|accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Company of the Wolf''' is an Australian [[combat reenactment]] and [[living history]] group, re-enacting a [[mercenary]] company of the [[High Middle Ages]] to the [[Late Middle Ages]], portraying a timeline of the great warring periods of the Middle Ages, from the later Crusading period of 1250, through the [[Hundred Years' War]], to the end of the [[Wars of the Roses]] and [[Bosworth Field]] in 1485.  Portraying a collection of the finest hired blades in Europe, the Company's ranks include members representative of the landless nobility, grizzled professional campaigners and humble foot soldiers, as well as a variety of camp followers drawn from across Western Europe.

== Aims ==
The group's charter states that its intent is twofold;

"To be an accessible reenactment group, catering to anyone with an interest in mediaeval European history, a suitable place in the group will be found for anyone with any level of experience or interest, and;
To provide an accurate, interesting and fun educational experience to any institution or educational group interested in learning more about this interesting and largely misunderstood period of history.&lt;ref&gt;Company of the Wolf founding committee (2005). "Company of the Wolf Charter" Company of the Wolf letters of incorporation, University of New England Printery Service, Armidale, Australia&lt;/ref&gt; "

== Origins and history ==

The Company of the Wolf formed during 2005 to provide a vehicle for mediaeval historians and re-enactors living in and around the [[New England (Australia)|New England]] region of [[New South Wales]]. Traditionally the Company has retained
close links to other groups in Australia, frequently supplying members to reinforce the displays and shows of other groups. The Company is notable for its mascot Loupes De Guerre, or "war wolves". Historically, wolves, or other fierce breeds, would be unleashed before close quarters combat to break and demoralise enemy infantry formations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sheppardsoftware.com/content/animals/animals/breeds/dogtopics/dogs_war.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Company of the Wolf use the considerably friendlier [[Siberian Husky]] to represent these dogs of war, equipping them with historically accurate [[armour]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.florilegium.org/?http%3A//www.florilegium.org/files/ANIMALS/dogs-msg.html&lt;/ref&gt; While dogs are frequent attendants in historical re-enactment, Company of the Wolf claims to be the only reenactment group in Australia that fields a dedicated armoured [[war dog]] sub unit.

== Traditions and customs ==

The Company of the Wolf has a number of internal traditions and customs based on mediaeval practices.

=== Knighthood ===
Members of The Company of the Wolf who have attended three or more major events as members of the Company are awarded the rank of [[knight]]. This involves a traditional [[accolade]] or "dubbing" ceremony, where the newly elevated member is tapped on the shoulder with a [[sword]] and presented to his fellows, followed by a blow from a mailed fist. This represents the last blow that the new knight may ever take without responding to the challenge. The new knight is then presented with a small token of his or her new rank, often a badge. Once a knight, the member is referred to as "Sir" or "Lady", and has the right to wear [[spur]]s in the field to display his or her status to friends and foe alike. The knights of the Company of the Wolf are occasionally referred to collectively as "Knights of the Order of the Wolf". Unlike mediaeval orders of [[knighthood]], both male and female members who are granted membership in the order are referred to as "knights", although their pre-nominal honorifics are gender specific.

[[File:Company of the Wolf banner.JPG|thumb|The Company of the Wolf banner, displaying the arms of the Company and the individual arms of the senior members of the Company]]

=== The Wolf Banner ===
When the Company of the Wolf deploys as a group, the Wolf [[banner]] is displayed. This is a large black banner displaying the arms of the Company. When static, this banner remains in the campsite signifying the Company is present and deployed as a unit. On parade or for combat displays, the banner can be carried by two bearers to announce that members of the Company have taken the field. When a member of the Company of the Wolf achieves the rank of [[knight]], the [[armorial achievement]] of the member may be added to the banner in miniature. Children of knights, even when not knights themselves, are permitted to display their arms alongside their parents' with appropriate marks of [[cadency]]. As accessibility and inclusiveness are key components of the group's mission, children of members have always been encouraged to participate. When an existing member, male or female, becomes the parent of a new child, the baby is bestowed honorary membership until the age of 14, when they may decide for themselves if they wish to continue participation with the Company.

=== The Wolf's Tail Badge ===
Members of the Company of the Wolf will sometimes wear a "wolf's tail" hanging from their belts in both civilian and military attire as a form of group identification. As foxes are officially classed as vermin in Australia, members forgo the use of real wolves tails, and large fox tails are preferred. These "wolves' tails" are also sometimes hung from the poles of the Wolf Banner as a further embellishment of the Banner as the Company's rallying point.

== Events ==
The Company of the Wolf supplies displays, encampments and re-enactors to several high profile re-enactment events in Australia, including the Abbey Tournament&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abbeytournament.com/whos_who_of_reenactors.htm#wolf&lt;/ref&gt; at Caboolture in Queensland, and the Vikings! Exhibition &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aetaustralia.org/vikings.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022112727/http://www.aetaustralia.org/vikings.htm |archivedate=2008-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Australian National Maritime Museum]] in [[Sydney]]. The Company also provides educational or "interest" displays for schools, universities or social groups when requested. Company members cover a range of mediaeval interests, and the group is structured in such a way as to allow the widest range of participation possible. This gives the Company of the Wolf a high degree of versatility, and allows the group to display and educate in civilian and military aspects of mediaeval life. The Company is lucky to count among its members and associates experts in a range of combat styles, mediaeval fashion and clothes making, armouring, [[heraldry]] and even mediaeval [[midwifery]]. Company of the Wolf is also notable for being one of the few mediaeval living history groups in Australia to field historically accurate [[Black powder|black-powder]] weapons and crews. As well as public displays and shows, the Company of the Wolf also deploy privately to a number of immersive events for re-enactors along the East Coast of Australia.

'''''Critical Path''''' is a book written by US author and inventor [[R. Buckminster Fuller]] with the assistance of [[Kiyoshi Kuromiya]]. First published in 1981, it is alongside ''[[Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth]]'' one of Fuller's best-known works. Vast in its scope, it describes Fuller's own vision of the development of human [[civilization]], [[economic history]], and his highly original [[economic ideology]] based, amongst other things, on his detailed description of why [[scarcity]] of resources need no longer be a decisive factor in [[global politics]].

== Overview ==
The following is a list of the main claims and opinions presented in the book, reported without discussion or criticism.

=== Part One ===
The first part of the book explains the history and present state of the global economy.

=== Chapter 1 - Speculative Prehistory of Humanity ===
[[Human|Human life]] began in the atolls of the [[Oceania|South Pacific]], where the average sea temperature is closest to that of the human body (p.&amp;nbsp;6). Rather than [[evolution|evolving]] from simpler organisms, humanity was of extraterrestrial origin and other organisms evolved from us (p.&amp;nbsp;7). From this base, humanity developed [[boat-building]] in [[Southeast Asia]] and colonised the rest of the planet (p.&amp;nbsp;15). There is evidence that the [[Bronze Age]] began in Southeast Asia (p.&amp;nbsp;17). Fuller's [[Dymaxion map|Dymaxion World Map]] is used to show the distribution of humanity over the Earth's surface. Over half the population lives in the regions watered by the [[Himalaya]]n glaciers (p.&amp;nbsp;20).

=== Chapter 2 - Humans in Universe ===
Our knowledge of the [[spherical Earth|spherical shape of the Earth]] is central to our understanding of ecology (p.&amp;nbsp;34). This knowledge probably originated in prehistoric times, was certainly known to the [[Ancient Greeks]], but was then suppressed for centuries by organised religion because it was incompatible with the official story of a [[Heaven]] above and a [[Hell]] below (p.&amp;nbsp;43). There has been an evolution of religious ideas from those of the Egyptian pyramid-builders, whose ambition was to deliver a single individual, the [[pharaoh]], into the afterlife, to the modern belief that everybody has a right to enjoy life on Earth (p.&amp;nbsp;51).

=== Chapter 3 - Legally Piggily ===
{{quote|Fire is the Sun unwinding from the tree's log.|Fuller|p.62}}
Human history has been shaped by the continual growth and success of greed. [[City-state]]s were the first institutions to make organised use of extortion (p.&amp;nbsp;68). This was then followed by the growth of [[international trade]], which appropriates the wealth of the planet for its own ends. Corruption in the form of "lawyer-capitalism" has led the U.S.A. to become effectively bankrupt (p.&amp;nbsp;114). Government [[subsidies]] given to corporations amount to [[socialism]] (p.&amp;nbsp;101).

=== Chapter 4 - Self-Disciplines of Buckminster Fuller ===
Fuller's diary, the "[[Dymaxion Chronofile|Chronofile]]", is intended to show how much a single human being with little money can do to influence world affairs (p.&amp;nbsp;128). The mechanical principle of [[precession]] is used as a metaphor for the ability of a person to influence the world by applying pressure in an unconventional direction (p.&amp;nbsp;144). Fuller's religious beliefs are explained (p.&amp;nbsp;151).

Fuller observed that when he did things for the benefit of others, it had a positive effect on his life, but when he did things merely for his personal benefit, the outcome was negative. This eventually led him to the proposition that if he dedicated his life to the betterment of humanity, he would achieve the greatest positive outcome. So he decided to live his entire life as an experiment to prove or disprove this proposition. He writes (p.&amp;nbsp;145):

{{quote|I assumed that nature would "evaluate" my work as I went along. If I was doing what nature wanted done, and if I was doing it in promising ways, permitted by nature's principles, I would find my work being economically sustained—and vice versa, in which latter negative case I must quickly cease doing what I had been doing and seek logically alternative courses until I found the new course that nature signified her approval of by providing for its physical support. Wherefore, I concluded that I would be informed by nature if I proceeded in the following manner:

(A) committed myself, my wife, and our infant daughter directly to the design, production, and demonstration of artifact accommodation of the most evident but as-yet-unattended-to human-environment-advantaging physical evolutionary tasks, and (B) paid no attention to "earning a living" in humanity's established economic system, yet (C) found my family's and my own life's needs being unsolicitedly provided for by seemingly pure happenstance and always only "in the nick of time," and (D) being provided for "only coincidentally," yet found (E) that this only "coincidentally," unbudgetable, yet realistic support persisted, and did so (F) only so long as I continued spontaneously to commit myself unreservedly to the task of developing relevant artifacts, and if I (G) never tried to persuade humanity to alter its customs and viewpoints and never asked anyone to listen to me and spoke informatively to others only when they asked me so to do, and if I (H) never undertook competitively to produce artifacts others were developing, and attended only to that which no others attended

''then'' I could tentatively conclude that my two assumptions were valid: (1) that nature might economically sustain human activity that served directly in the "mainstream" realization of essential cosmic regeneration, which had hitherto been accomplished only through seeming "right-angled" side effects of the chromosomically focused biological creatures; and (2) that the generalized physical law of precessional behaviors does govern socioeconomic behaviors as do also the generalized laws of acceleration and ephemeralization.}}

=== Chapter 5 - The Geoscope ===
The Geoscope is a large-scale, animated globe of the Earth intended to help people visualise the spatial and temporal patterns of human activity, either in real time or replayed at different speeds. If the human mind is presented with all of this information at once, it should be able to use its visual pattern-detecting abilities to solve complex problems such as weather-forecasting, resource conflicts, and wars (p.&amp;nbsp;183). Data for the Geoscope can come from the world maps produced by the USA, using radio triangulation, during and after World War II (p.&amp;nbsp;184). Geodesic domes will be built to enclose entire cities (p.&amp;nbsp;179). [[Afghanistan]] was the heartland of the [[Cold War]] world, as it gave the [[USSR]] the potential of a route through [[Iran]] to the [[Indian Ocean]] (p.&amp;nbsp;194).

=== Chapter 6 - World Game ===
The [[World Game]] is a simulation of global economic activity. Computers can be used to calculate the optimal answer to any economic, technological or social question. The computers will tell us that the true cost to the environment of using fossil fuels is prohibitive, and renewable energy should be used instead. The true energy cost of a gallon of gasoline is more than one million (1980) US dollars. The amount of scrap metals in circulation means that no more mining is necessary (p.&amp;nbsp;205). A global electrical supply grid will enable more efficient use of energy, and make intermittent renewable energy more practical (p.&amp;nbsp;202).

=== Part Two ===
This part of the book explains Fuller's plan to set humanity on the path to a sustainable existence with no need to fight over resources.

=== Chapter 7 - Critical Path: Part One ===
Education is key to improving humanity's living conditions (p.&amp;nbsp;232). The USSR tried to destabilise the US education system by inciting its students to riot (p.&amp;nbsp;236). The [[Apollo Project]] had a [[Critical path method|critical path]] of two million tasks, one million of which required new technological solutions (p.&amp;nbsp;248). Fuller has applied a similar project-planning approach to the saving of humanity, and has created a list of critical-path items (p.&amp;nbsp;248).

{{quote|by 1985 we should be able to transmit humans around the globe by radio scanning or an equivalently unexpected means|Fuller|p.245}}
{{quote|We are being taught by all the foregoing to assume as closely as possible the viewpoint, the patience, and the competence of God.|Fuller|p.251}}

=== Chapter 8 - Critical Path: Part Two ===
Unlike the Apollo Project, the critical-path items in the project to save humanity can all be accomplished with existing technologies (p.&amp;nbsp;253). A global video education system must be developed (p.&amp;nbsp;265).
{{quote|I am certain that none of the world's problems...have any hope of solution except through total democratic society's becoming thoroughly...self-educated.|Fuller|p.266}}

=== Chapter 9 - Critical Path: Part Three ===
Corn is wasted in generating unnecessarily fatty but more profitable beef (p.&amp;nbsp;272). 
{{quote|Billions of dollars of government subsidies now go to the conglomerate farmland owners.|Fuller|p.274}}
{{quote|The drive to make money...seeks to monopolize order while leaving...disorder to overwhelm others.|Fuller|p.276}}
In Los Angeles, private-incinerator and later car-pollution laws were passed to shift the blame for smog from industry to citizens (p.&amp;nbsp;279). 
{{quote|Today, big business ... is completely transnational. Now only the world's people are left bound within their respective 150 national pens.|Fuller|p.285}}
In 1929 the USSR used its gold wealth relative to the USA's poverty to pay United States industry to set up industries in USSR, in USSR's first three [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|5-year plans]] (p.&amp;nbsp;289).

=== Chapter 10 - Critical Path: Part Four ===
{{quote|Having committed ourselves to solving humanity's problems with artifacts...|Fuller|p.309}}
The first task in humanity's critical path is to build a global electricity grid (p.&amp;nbsp;309). The second task is to provide movable dwellings for all - city-sized and family-sized domes (p.&amp;nbsp;310). Fuller has the following designs ready for production: the [[Fly's Eye Dome]] (p.&amp;nbsp;311); [[Old Man River's City project]], [[East St. Louis]] (p.&amp;nbsp;315); Raleigh cotton mill (p.&amp;nbsp;325); Growth House - sustainable greenhouse (p.&amp;nbsp;329); O-Volving shelves (p.&amp;nbsp;331); tetrahedral floating city (p.&amp;nbsp;333); Cloud Nines - spherical floating cities (p.&amp;nbsp;336); 8,000-foot Tokyo Tower (p.&amp;nbsp;338); containerised passenger air travel (p.&amp;nbsp;340).

== Concepts ==
* '''[[Critical path method|Critical path]].''' The title of the book is a term used in [[project planning]]. To estimate the completion date of a project, a chart is drawn showing all of the necessary sub-tasks and their durations, placed in chronological order. The last task cannot begin until all of tasks on which it depends have been completed. These tasks depend, in turn, on other tasks. It is usually possible to draw numerous paths through the chart from beginning to end, but it is the longest path, called the ''critical path'', that determines the time that the project will take to complete. The book refers frequently to the [[Apollo Project]], which was planned using this method. Fuller's plan to reorganise the global economy in a sustainable way also has a critical path, which is identified in the book.
* '''[[Spaceship Earth]].''' The Earth's material resources, like those of a spaceship, are finite. The book explains that early humans did not understand this, because the Earth seemed like a boundless flat surface. We now know that the Earth is a sphere, and this fact should inform all of our decisions.
* '''Personal integrity.''' ''Critical Path'' is part manifesto, part autobiography. Fuller admits in one place that this is "egostistical" (p.&amp;nbsp;378), but excuses this by saying that he wants to show not just his conclusions, but also the thought processes that led to them. He believes that every person must think for himself and take as little as possible on trust (p.xi).

== Criticism ==
{{quote|Mr. Fuller has always made himself easy to dismiss by wandering off the deep end of optimism, but a reading of ''Critical Path'' shows that the author, like Karl Marx, arrived at his vision of the ideal only after a serious attempt to understand the evolution of human affairs.|James Traub|"Nonfiction in Brief", ''[[The New York Times]]'', published April 19, 1981; accessed 2010-07-21}}

'''Defacement''', in [[heraldry]] and [[vexillology]], is the addition of a symbol or [[charge (heraldry)|charge]] to another flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flagspot.net/flags/vxt-dv-d.html#deface |title=Deface |work=Dictionary of Vexillology |publisher=Flags of the World}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nava.org/Flag%20Information/dictionary/index.html#D |title=Deface |work=Illustrated Dictionary of Vexillological Terms |publisher=North American Vexillological Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301211311/http://www.nava.org/Flag%20Information/dictionary/index.html |archivedate=2012-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Flag of New Zealand|New Zealand flag]] is the British [[Blue Ensign]] defaced with a [[Crux|Southern Cross]] in the [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|fly]]. In the context of [[vexillology]], the word "deface" carries no negative connotations, in contrast to general usage. It simply indicates differentiation of the flag from that of another owner by addition of elements. For example, many [[state flag]]s are formed by defacing the national flag with a coat of arms.
==History==
Where countries pass through changes of regime with contrasting ideological orientations (monarchist/republican, fascist/democratic, communist/capitalist, secular/religious etc.)—all of which, despite their differences, claim allegiance to a common national heritage expressed in a venerated national flag—it can happen that a new regime defaces that flag with its own specific emblem while keeping the basic flag design unchanged.{{cn|date=May 2016}} Such changing ideological emblems appeared over time, among others, on the flags of [[Italy]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[Germany]] (West and East, see illustration) [[Ethiopia]] and [[Iran]]. As a result, during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], insurgents tore out of the national flag the emblem of the regime which they opposed and waved the flag itself with which they identified.  

An already defaced flag can be further defaced. For example, the [[Flag of Australia|Australian flag]] is a defaced [[Blue Ensign]]. The [[Australian Border Force Flag]] is further defaced with the words "Australian border force" in block letters.

In the United States, it is against the [[United States Flag Code|Flag Code]] to deface the [[Flag of the United States|national flag]] with advertising or with any other [[Seal (emblem)| sigil]], image or insignia. Such flags are nevertheless commercially available, depicting the seals of various branches of the [[U.S. military]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] related objects such as [[tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]]s or [[war bonnet]]s, and the like.

It is common for [[association football]] supporters travelling abroad for a match to bring a national flag defaced with the name of their hometown or a similar local identifier.

==History==
{{Main|History of Florence|Timeline of Florence}}
[[File:Colored woodcut town view of Florence.jpg|thumb|View of Florence by Hartmann Schedel, published in 1493]]
Florence originated as a Roman city, and later, after a long period as a flourishing trading and banking [[medieval commune]], it was the birthplace of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', it was politically, economically, and culturally one of the most important cities in Europe and the world from the 14th to 16th centuries.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;

The language spoken in the city during the 14th century was, and still is, accepted as the [[Italian language]]. Almost all the writers and poets in Italian literature of the ''[[Golden Age|golden age]]'' are in some way connected with Florence, leading ultimately to the adoption of the Florentine dialect, above all the local dialects, as a literary language of choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://italian.about.com/library/weekly/aa060699a.htm |title=History of the Italian Language |publisher=italian.about.com |accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting from the late Middle Ages, Florentine money—in the form of the gold [[Florin (Italian coin)|florin]]—financed the development of industry all over Europe, from Britain to Bruges, to Lyon and Hungary. Florentine bankers financed the English kings during the [[Hundred Years War]]. They similarly financed the papacy, including the construction of their [[Avignon Papacy|provisional capital of Avignon]] and, after their return to Rome, the reconstruction and Renaissance embellishment of Rome.

Florence was home to the Medici, one of European history's most important noble families. [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] was considered a political and cultural mastermind of Italy in the late 15th century. Two members of the family were [[pope]]s in the early 16th century: [[Leo X]] and [[Clement VII]]. [[Catherine de Medici]] married king [[Henry II of France]] and, after his death in 1559, reigned as regent in France. [[Marie de' Medici]] married [[Henry IV of France]] and gave birth to the future king [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]. The Medici reigned as [[Grand Dukes of Tuscany]], starting with [[Cosimo I de' Medici]] in 1569 and ending with the death of [[Gian Gastone de' Medici]] in 1737.

The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] initially formed in 200&amp;nbsp;BC the small settlement of [[Fiesole]] (Faesulae in Latin),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/florence/history|title=History of Florence – Lonely Planet Travel Information|first=Lonely|last=Planet|date=|work=lonelyplanet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was destroyed by [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] in 80&amp;nbsp;BC in reprisal for supporting the [[populares]] faction in Rome. The present city of Florence was established by [[Julius Caesar]] in 59&amp;nbsp;BC as a settlement for his veteran soldiers and was named originally ''Fluentia'', owing to the fact that it was built between two rivers, which was later changed to ''Florentia'' ("flowering").&lt;ref&gt;Leonardo Bruni, ''History of the Florentine People'' I.1, 3&lt;/ref&gt; It was built in the style of an [[Military camp|army camp]] with the main streets, the ''[[cardo]]'' and the ''[[Decumanus Maximus|decumanus]]'', intersecting at the present ''[[Piazza della Repubblica (Florence)|Piazza della Repubblica]]''. Situated along the ''[[Via Cassia]]'', the main route between Rome and the north, and within the fertile valley of the [[Arno]], the settlement quickly became an important commercial centre.

In centuries to come, the city experienced turbulent periods of [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] rule, during which the city was often troubled by warfare between the [[Ostrogoths]] and the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], which may have caused the population to fall to as few as 1,000 people. Peace returned under [[Lombards|Lombard]] rule in the 6th century. Florence was conquered by [[Charlemagne]] in 774 and became part of the [[March of Tuscany|Duchy of Tuscany]], with [[Lucca]] as capital. The population began to grow again and commerce prospered. In 854, Florence and [[Fiesole]] were united in one county.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Explore the World Nelles Pocket: Florence - Fiesole, Prato, Pistoia, San Gimignano, Voltera, Siena|last=Bleek|first=Ulrike|publisher=Gunter Nelles|year=|isbn=|location=Munich|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second millennium===
[[File:Firenze-sanminiato01.jpg|thumb|right|The Basilica di [[San Miniato al Monte]]]]
[[Hugh, Margrave of Tuscany|Margrave Hugo]] chose Florence as his residency instead of [[Lucca]] at about 1000&amp;nbsp;AD. The [[Golden Age]] of Florentine art began around this time. In 1013, construction began on the Basilica di [[San Miniato al Monte]]. The exterior of the church was reworked in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]] between 1059 and 1128. In 1100, Florence was a "[[Commune]]", meaning a city state. The city's primary resource was the [[Arno|Arno river]], providing power and access for the industry (mainly textile industry), and access to the Mediterranean sea for international trade. Another great source of strength was its industrious merchant community. The Florentine merchant banking skills became recognised in Europe after they brought decisive financial innovation (e.g. bill of exchange,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/13484709|title=Cradle of capitalism|date=16 April 2009|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[double-entry bookkeeping system]]) to medieval fairs. This period also saw the eclipse of Florence's formerly powerful rival [[Pisa]] (defeated by [[Genoa]] in 1284 and subjugated by Florence in 1406), and the exercise of power by the [[mercantilism|mercantile]] elite following an anti-aristocratic movement, led by Giano della Bella, that resulted in a set of laws called the [[Ordinances of Justice]] (1293).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Middle Ages and Renaissance===
{{Main|Republic of Florence|Italian Renaissance}}

====Rise of the Medici====
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonardo da Vinci]] statue outside the [[Uffizi Gallery]]]]

Of a population estimated at 94,000 before the [[Black Death]] of 1348,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/dweb/plague/ Decameron Web, Boccaccio, Plague]". Brown University.&lt;/ref&gt; about 25,000 are said to have been supported by the city's [[wool]] industry: in 1345 Florence was the scene of an attempted strike by wool combers (''ciompi''), who in 1378 rose up in a brief revolt against oligarchic rule in the [[Ciompi|Revolt of the Ciompi]]. After their suppression, Florence came under the sway (1382–1434) of the [[House of Albizzi|Albizzi]] family, who became bitter rivals of the Medici.

In the 15th century, Florence was among the largest cities in Europe, considered rich and economically successful. Life was not idyllic for all residents though, among whom there were great disparities in wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pallanti, Giuseppe|title=Mona Lisa Revealed: The True Identity of Leonardo's Model|year=2006|publisher=Skira|location=Florence, Italy|pages=17, 23, 24|isbn=978-88-7624-659-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cosimo de' Medici]] was the first Medici family member to essentially control the city from behind the scenes. Although the city was technically a democracy of sorts, his power came from a vast [[patronage]] network along with his alliance to the new immigrants, the ''gente nuova'' (new people). The fact that the Medici were bankers to the pope also contributed to their ascendancy. Cosimo was succeeded by his son [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero]], who was, soon after, succeeded by Cosimo's grandson, [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo]] in 1469. Lorenzo was a great patron of the arts, commissioning works by [[Michelangelo]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]. Lorenzo was an accomplished poet and musician and brought composers and singers to Florence, including [[Alexander Agricola]], [[Johannes Ghiselin]], and [[Heinrich Isaac]]. By contemporary Florentines (and since), he was known as "Lorenzo the Magnificent" (Lorenzo il Magnifico).

Following Lorenzo de' Medici's death in 1492, he was succeeded by his son [[Piero II de' Medici|Piero&amp;nbsp;II]]. When the French king [[Charles VIII of France|Charles&amp;nbsp;VIII]] invaded [[northern Italy]], Piero&amp;nbsp;II chose to resist his army. But when he realised the size of the [[French Army|French army]] at the gates of Pisa, he had to accept the humiliating conditions of the French king. These made the Florentines rebel and they expelled Piero&amp;nbsp;II. With his exile in 1494, the first period of Medici rule ended with the restoration of a republican government.

====Savonarola, Machiavelli, and the Medici Popes====
[[File:Hanging and burning of Girolamo Savonarola in Florence.jpg|thumb|right|Girolamo Savonarola being burnt at the stake in 1498]]
During this period, the [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]] [[Girolamo Savonarola]] had become [[prior]] of the [[San Marco, Florence|San Marco]] monastery in 1490. He was famed for his penitential sermons, lambasting what he viewed as widespread immorality and attachment to material riches. He blamed the exile of the Medici as the work of God, punishing them for their decadence. He seized the opportunity to carry through political reforms leading to a more democratic rule. But when Savonarola publicly accused [[Pope Alexander VI]] of corruption, he was banned from speaking in public. When he broke this ban, he was excommunicated. The Florentines, tired of his extreme teachings, turned against him and arrested him. He was convicted as a heretic and [[Death by burning|burned at the stake]] on the [[Piazza della Signoria]] on 23 May 1498.

A second individual of unusually acute insight was [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], whose prescriptions for Florence's regeneration under strong leadership have often been seen as a legitimisation of political expediency and even malpractice. In other words, Machiavelli was a political thinker, perhaps most renowned for his political handbook, titled [[The Prince]], which is about ruling and the exercise of power. Commissioned by the Medici, Machiavelli also wrote the [[Florentine Histories]], the history of the city. Florentines drove out the Medici for a second time and re-established a republic on 16 May 1527. Restored twice with the support of both [[Emperor Charles V]] and [[Pope Clement VII]] (Giulio de Medici), the Medici in 1532 became hereditary dukes of Florence, and in 1569 [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Grand Dukes of Tuscany]], ruling for two centuries. In all Tuscany, only the Republic of Lucca (later a [[Duchy of Lucca|Duchy]]) and the Principality of [[Piombino]] were independent from Florence.

===18th and 19th centuries===
[[File:Wenceslaus Werlin-Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor and his family.jpg|thumb|[[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and his family. Leopold was, from 1765 to 1790, the [[Grand duke|Grand Duke]] of Tuscany]]
The extinction of the Medici dynasty and the accession in 1737 of [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis Stephen]], [[Lorraine (duchy)|duke of Lorraine]] and husband of [[Maria Theresa of Austria]], led to Tuscany's temporary inclusion in the territories of the Austrian crown. It became a [[secundogeniture]] of the [[House of Lorraine|Habsburg-Lorraine]] dynasty, who were deposed for the [[House of Bourbon-Parma]] in 1801. From 1801 to 1807 Florence was the capital of the [[Napoleon]]ic client state [[Kingdom of Etruria]]. Bourbon-Parma were deposed in December 1807 when Tuscany was annexed by [[First French Empire|France]]. Florence was the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the French département of [[Arno (department)|Arno]] from 1808 to the fall of [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] in 1814. The Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty was restored on the throne of Tuscany at the [[Congress of Vienna]] but finally deposed in 1859. Tuscany became a region of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861.

Florence replaced [[Turin]] as Italy's capital in 1865 and, in an effort to modernise the city, the old market in the Piazza del Mercato Vecchio and many medieval houses were pulled down and replaced by a more formal street plan with newer houses. The Piazza (first renamed Piazza [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Vittorio Emanuele&amp;nbsp;II]], then [[Piazza della Repubblica (Florence)|Piazza della Repubblica]], the present name) was significantly widened and a large triumphal arch was constructed at the west end. This development was unpopular and was prevented from continuing by the efforts of several British and American people living in the city.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} A museum recording the destruction stands nearby today.

The country's second capital city was superseded by Rome six years later, after the withdrawal of the French troops made its addition to the kingdom possible.

===20th century===
[[File:SanMiniatoAlMonte-Cimetiere.jpg|thumb|''Porte Sante'' cemetery, burial place of notable figures of Florentine history.]]
After doubling during the 19th century, Florence's population was to triple in the 20th, resulting from growth in tourism, trade, [[financial services]] and industry.

During [[World War II in Europe|World War II]] the city experienced a year-long German occupation (1943–1944) and was declared an [[open city]] in late July 1944 as troops of the [[British Eighth Army|British 8th Army]] closed in. In early August, the retreating Germans decided to demolish all the bridges along the [[Arno]] linking the district of Oltrarno to the rest of the city, making it difficult for troops of the 8th Army to cross. However, at the last moment Charles Steinhauslin, at the time consulate of 26 countries in Florence, convinced the German general in Italy that the [[Ponte Vecchio]] was not to be destroyed due to its historical value.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Instead, an equally historic area of streets directly to the south of the bridge, including part of the [[Vasari Corridor|Corridoio Vasariano]], was destroyed using mines. Since then the bridges have been restored to their original forms using as many of the remaining materials as possible, but the buildings surrounding the Ponte Vecchio have been rebuilt in a style combining the old with modern design. Shortly before leaving Florence, as they knew that they would soon have to retreat, the Germans executed many [[freedom fighter]]s and political opponents publicly, in streets and squares including the Piazza Santo Spirito.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Florence was liberated by [[2nd New Zealand Division|New Zealand]], [[6th Armoured Division (South Africa)|South African]] and British troops on 4 August 1944. The [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] soldiers who died driving the Germans from Tuscany are buried in cemeteries outside the city (Americans about {{convert|9|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} south of the city, British and Commonwealth soldiers a few kilometres east of the centre on the right bank of the Arno).

At the end of World War II in May 1945, the US Army's Information and Educational Branch was ordered to establish an overseas university campus for demobilised American service men and women in Florence, Italy. The first American University for service personnel was established in June 1945 at the School of Aeronautics in Florence, Italy. Some 7,500 soldier-students were to pass through the University during its four one-month sessions (see [[G. I. American Universities]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://giuniversity.wordpress.com/florence/ |title=University Study Center, Florence « The GI University Project |publisher=Giuniversity.wordpress.com |date= 2010-07-04|accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1966, the [[1966 Flood of the River Arno in Florence|Arno flooded]] parts of the centre, damaging many art treasures. Around the city there are tiny placards on the walls noting where the flood waters reached at their highest point.

=== 21st century ===
On 25 May 2016 the [[BBC]] reported that a [[sinkhole]], thought to have been caused by a bursting of a water pipe, opened up a  {{convert|200|m|adj=on}} hole on the [[Arno river]] bank in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36378289|title=Huge sinkhole swallows cars in Florence|author=|date=25 May 2016|website=Bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Florence view from Piazzale Michelangelo - Florence, Italy - panoramio.jpg|thumb|November 2005 view of the city and Arno valley, with the Apennine mountains in the background]]
Florence lies in a basin formed by the hills of [[Villa Medici at Careggi|Careggi]], [[Fiesole]], [[Settignano]], [[Arcetri]], [[Poggio Imperiale]] and Bellosguardo (Florence). The Arno river, three other minor rivers (Mugnone, Ema and Greve) and some streams flow through it.

===Climate===
[[File:Florence with snow cover in December 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Florence with snow cover in December 2009]]
Florence has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa''), tending to [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] (''Csa'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/pics/kottek_et_al_2006.gif |title=World map of Köppen – Geiger Climate Classification |date=April 2006 |publisher=koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at |accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has hot summers with moderate or light rainfall and cool, damp winters. As Florence lacks a prevailing wind, summer temperatures are higher than along the coast. Rainfall in summer is [[Precipitation types (meteorology)|convectional]], while relief rainfall dominates in the winter. Snow flurries happen almost every year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tutiempo.net/clima/Firenze_Peretola/161700.htm |title=Clima en Firenze / Peretola Históricos desde 1964 hasta 2016 (METAR)|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |language=Spanish |website=tutiempo.net |access-date=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but often result in no accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Borchi |first1=Emilio |last2=Macii |first2=Renzo |date=2011 |title=La neve a Firenze (1874-2010) |trans-title=Snow in Florence (1874–2010) |language=Italian |location=Florence |publisher=Pagnini Editore |isbn=978-88-8251-382-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest officially recorded temperature was {{convert|42.6|°C|01|abbr=on}} on 26 July 1983 and the lowest was {{convert|-23.2|°C|1|abbr=on}} on 12 January 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MeteoAM.it!

File:Quartieri di Firenze.gif|The 5 administrative boroughs of the whole ''comune'' of Florence
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The legislative body of the [[Italian communes|municipality]] is the City Council (''Consiglio Comunale''), which is composed of 36 councillors elected every five years with a proportional system, contextually to the mayoral elections. The executive body is the City Committee (''Giunta Comunale''), composed by 7 [[Assessor (Italy)|assessors]], that is nominated and presieded over by a directly elected [[List of mayors of Florence|Mayor]]. The current mayor of Florence is [[Dario Nardella]].

The municipality of Florence is subdivided into five administrative Boroughs (''Quartieri''). Each Borough is governed by a Council (''Consiglio'') and a President, elected contextually to the city Mayor. The urban organisation is governed by the Italian Constitution (art. 114). The Boroughs have the power to advise the Mayor with nonbinding opinions on a large spectrum of topics (environment, construction, public health, local markets) and exercise the functions delegated to them by the City Council; in addition they are supplied with an autonomous founding in order to finance local activities. The Boroughs are:
* [[Historic Centre of Florence|Centro storico]] (Historic Centre); population: 67,170;
* [[Campo di Marte]]; population: 88,588;
* Gavinana-[[Galluzzo]]; population: 40,907;
* Isolotto-[[Legnaia]]; population: 66,636;
* Rifredi; population: 103,761.

All of the five boroughs are governed by the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]].

The former Italian Prime Minister (2014-2016), [[Matteo Renzi]], served as mayor from 2009 to 2014.

[[File:Ponte Vecchio Firenze.jpg|thumb|[[Ponte Vecchio]], which spans the [[Arno river]]]]
Florence is known as the "cradle of the Renaissance" (''la culla del Rinascimento'') for its monuments, churches, and buildings. The best-known site of Florence is the domed cathedral of the city, [[Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore|Santa Maria del Fiore]], known as ''The Duomo'', whose dome was built by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]. The nearby [[Campanile]] (partly designed by [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]]) and the [[Baptistery of Florence Cathedral|Baptistery]] buildings are also highlights. The dome, 600 years after its completion, is still the largest dome built in brick and mortar in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ross King, ''Brunelleschi's Dome, The Story of the great Cathedral of Florence'', Penguin, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, the '''[[Historic Centre of Florence|historic centre of Florence]]''' (Italian: ''centro storico di Firenze'') was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by the [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Historic Centre of Florence – UNESCO World Heritage Centre|url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/174|website = whc.unesco.org|accessdate = 8 July 2015|first = UNESCO|last = Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre of the city is contained in [[Defensive wall|medieval walls]] that were built in the 14th century to defend the city. At the heart of the city, in [[Piazza della Signoria]], is [[Bartolomeo Ammannati]]'s [[Fountain of Neptune, Florence|Fountain of Neptune]] (1563–1565), which is a masterpiece of [[marble sculpture]] at the terminus of a still functioning Roman [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]].

The layout and structure of Florence in many ways harkens back to the Roman era, where it was designed as a [[garrison]] settlement.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; Nevertheless, the majority of the city was built during the Renaissance.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; Despite the strong presence of Renaissance architecture within the city, traces of [[medieval architecture|medieval]], [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]], [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] and [[modern architecture]] can be found. The [[Palazzo Vecchio]] as well as the Duomo, or the city's Cathedral, are the two buildings which dominate Florence's skyline.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;

The river Arno, which cuts through the old part of the city, is as much a character in Florentine history as many of the people who lived there. Historically, the locals have had a love-hate relationship with the Arno – which alternated between nourishing the city with commerce, and destroying it by flood.

[[File:Palazzo Pitti Florence.jpg|alt=Palazzo Pitti|left|thumb|[[Palazzo Pitti]]]]
One of the bridges in particular stands out — the Ponte Vecchio (''Old Bridge''), whose most striking feature is the multitude of shops built upon its edges, held up by stilts. The bridge also carries [[Vasari Corridor|Vasari's elevated corridor]] linking the Uffizi to the Medici residence ([[Palazzo Pitti]]). Although the original bridge was constructed by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], the current bridge was rebuilt in the 14th century. It is the only bridge in the city to have survived World War&amp;nbsp;II intact. It is the first example in the western world of a bridge built using segmental [[arch]]es, that is, arches less than a semicircle, to reduce both span-to-rise ratio and the numbers of pillars to allow lesser encumbrance in the riverbed (being in this much more successful than the Roman [[Alconétar Bridge]]).

[[File:Vechio Ponte Santa Trinita with the Oltrarno district.jpg|thumb|[[Ponte Santa Trinita]] with the [[Oltrarno]] district]]
The church of [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence|San Lorenzo]] contains the [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence|Medici Chapel]], the [[mausoleum]] of the [[House of Medici|Medici family]]—the most powerful family in Florence from the 15th to the 18th century. Nearby is the Uffizi Gallery, one of the finest art museums in the world – founded on a large bequest from the last member of the Medici family.
[[File:Florence Duomo from Michelangelo hill.jpg|thumb|left|Florence Duomo as seen from Michelangelo hill.]]
The Uffizi is located at the corner of [[Piazza della Signoria]], a site important for being the centre of Florence's civil life and government for centuries. The [[Palazzo della Signoria]] facing it is still home of the municipal government. Many significant episodes in the [[history of art]] and political changes were staged here, such as:
* In 1301, [[Dante Alighieri]] was sent into exile from here (commemorated by a plaque on one of the walls of the Uffizi).
* On 26 April 1478, [[Jacopo de' Pazzi]] and his retainers tried to raise the city against the Medici after the plot known as ''La congiura dei Pazzi'' (''[[Pazzi conspiracy|The Pazzi conspiracy]]''), murdering [[Giuliano de' Medici (1453–1478)|Giuliano di Piero de' Medici]] and wounding his brother Lorenzo. All the members of the plot who could be apprehended were seized by the Florentines and hanged from the windows of the palace.
* In 1497, it was the location of the [[Bonfire of the Vanities]] instigated by the Dominican friar and preacher [[Girolamo Savonarola]]
* On 23 May 1498, the same Savonarola and two followers were hanged and burnt at the stake. (A round plate in the ground marks the spot where he was hanged)
* In 1504, [[David (Michelangelo)|Michelangelo's David]] (now replaced by a replica, since the original was moved in 1873 to the [[Galleria dell'Accademia]]) was installed in front of the Palazzo della Signoria (also known as Palazzo Vecchio).

The [[Loggia dei Lanzi]] in Piazza della Signoria is the location of a number of statues by other sculptors such as [[Donatello]], [[Giambologna]], Ammannati and [[Benvenuto Cellini|Cellini]], although some have been replaced with copies to preserve the originals.

===Monuments, museums and religious buildings===
{{see also|List of churches in Florence|Theatres in Florence}}
[[File:Galeri.jpg|thumb|upright|upright=1.15|Piazzale degli Uffizi]]
Florence contains several palaces and buildings from various eras. The Palazzo Vecchio is the [[City and town halls|town hall]] of Florence and also an art museum. This large [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[Battlement|crenellated]] fortress-palace overlooks the [[Piazza della Signoria]] with its copy of Michelangelo's David statue as well as the gallery of statues in the adjacent [[Loggia dei Lanzi]]. Originally called the ''Palazzo della Signoria'', after the [[Signoria of Florence]], the ruling body of the [[Republic of Florence]], it was also given several other names: ''Palazzo del Popolo'', ''Palazzo dei Priori'', and ''Palazzo Ducale'', in accordance with the varying use of the palace during its long history. The building acquired its current name when the Medici duke's residence was moved across the Arno to the Palazzo Pitti. It is linked to the Uffizi and the Palazzo Pitti through the [[Corridoio Vasariano]].

[[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]], designed by [[Michelozzo|Michelozzo di Bartolomeo]] for [[Cosimo de' Medici|Cosimo il Vecchio]], of the Medici family, is another major edifice, and was built between 1445 and 1460. It was well known for its stone masonry that includes rustication and ashlar. Today it is the head office of the Metropolitan City of Florence  and hosts museums and the [[Biblioteca Riccardiana|Riccardiana Library]]. The [[Palazzo Strozzi]], an example of civil architecture with its rusticated stone, was inspired by the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi|Palazzo Medici]], but with more harmonious proportions. Today the palace is used for international expositions like the annual antique show (founded as the Biennale dell'Antiquariato in 1959), fashion shows and other cultural and artistic events. Here also is the seat of the Istituto Nazionale del Rinascimento and the noted [[Gabinetto Vieusseux]], with the library and reading room.&lt;br /&gt;
There are several other notable places, including the [[Palazzo Rucellai]], designed by Leon Battista Alberti between 1446 and 1451 and executed, at least in part, by [[Bernardo Rossellino]]; the [[Palazzo Davanzati]], which houses the museum of the Old Florentine House; the [[Palazzo delle Assicurazioni Generali (Florence)|Palazzo delle Assicurazioni Generali]], designed in the [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] style in 1871; the [[Palazzo Spini Feroni]], in [[Piazza Santa Trinita]], a historic 13th-century private palace, owned since the 1920s by shoe-designer [[Salvatore Ferragamo]]; as well as various others, including the Palazzo Borghese, the Palazzo di Bianca Cappello, the [[Palazzo Antinori]], and the Royal building of Santa Maria Novella.

In 1200 the city was home to 50,000 people.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sovereign State and Its Competitors: An Analysis of Systems Change|author=Spruyt, H.|date=1996|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691029108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jx2Q4hxT5HAC|page=132|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1300 the population of the city proper was 120,000, with an additional 300,000 living in the [[Contado]].&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ecologies and Economies in Medieval and Early Modern Europe: Studies in Environmental History for Richard C.

{{As of|2010|10|31}}, the population of the city proper is 370,702, while [[Eurostat]] estimates that 696,767 people live in the [[Larger Urban Zones|urban area]] of Florence. The Metropolitan Area of Florence, Prato and Pistoia, constituted in 2000 over an area of roughly {{convert|4800|km2|0|abbr=out}}, is home to 1.5&amp;nbsp;million people. Within Florence proper, 46.8% of the population was male in 2007 and 53.2% were female. Minors (children aged 18 and less) totalled 14.10 percent of the population compared to pensioners, who numbered 25.95 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners). The average age of Florence resident is 49 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Florence grew by 3.22 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demo.istat.it/bil2007/index.html |title=Statistiche demografiche ISTAT |publisher=Demo.istat.it |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[birth rate]] of Florence is 7.66 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.

{{As of|2009}}, 87.46% of the population was Italian. An estimated 6,000 [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] live in the city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090201181239/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-090102-italy-china%2C0%2C1337042.story Chinese immigrants to Italy build no ordinary Chinatown], [[Chicago Tribune]], 1 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The largest immigrant group came from other European countries (mostly [[Romanians]] and [[Albanians]]): 3.52%, East Asia (mostly [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] and [[Filipino people|Filipino]]): 2.17%, the Americas: 1.41%, and North Africa (mostly [[Morocco|Moroccan]]): 0.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demo.istat.it/str2006/index.html |title=Statistiche demografiche ISTAT |publisher=Demo.istat.it |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Tourism is, by far, the most important of all industries and most of the Florentine economy relies on the money generated by international arrivals and students studying in the city.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web |work=Britannica Concise Encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/210642/Florence# |title=Florence (Italy) |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value tourism to the city totalled some €62.5 billion in 2015 and the number of visitors had increased by 5.5% from the previous year.&lt;ref name="theflorentine.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theflorentine.net/news/2016/05/florence-economy-double-nations/|title=Economy of Florence twice the national average - The Florentine|date=27 May 2016|website=Theflorentine.net|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Florence was listed as the second best world city by ''Condé Nast Traveler''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/16/travel/cn-traveler-top-cities/ |title=The world best cities are... |publisher=CNN |date= |accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturing and commerce, however, still remain highly important. Florence is also Italy's 17th richest city in terms of average workers' earnings, with the figure being €23,265 (the overall city's income is €6,531,204,473), coming after [[Mantua]], yet surpassing [[Bolzano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/speciali/redditi_comuni_08/ |title=La classifica dei redditi nei comuni capoluogo di provincia |publisher=Il Sole 24 ORE |accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry, commerce and services===
Florence is a major production and commercial centre in Italy, where the Florentine industrial complexes in the suburbs produce all sorts of goods, from furniture, rubber goods, chemicals, and food.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; However, traditional and local products, such as antiques, handicrafts, glassware, leatherwork, art reproductions, jewellery, souvenirs, elaborate metal and iron-work, shoes, accessories and high fashion clothes also dominate a fair sector of Florence's economy.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; The city's income relies partially on services and commercial and cultural interests, such as annual fairs, theatrical and lyrical productions, art exhibitions, festivals and fashion shows, such as the [[Calcio Fiorentino]]. Heavy industry and machinery also take their part in providing an income. In Nuovo Pignone, numerous factories are still present, and small-to medium industrial businesses are dominant. The Florence-Prato-Pistoia industrial districts and areas were known as the 'Third Italy' in the 1990s, due to the exports of high-quality goods and automobile (especially the [[Vespa]]) and the prosperity and productivity of the Florentine entrepreneurs. Some of these industries even rivalled the traditional industrial districts in [[Emilia–Romagna|Emilia-Romagna]] and [[Veneto]] due to high profits and productivity.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;

In the fourth quarter of 2015, manufacturing increased by 2.4% and exports increased by 7.2%. Leading sectors included mechanical engineering, fashion, pharmaceutics, food and wine. During 2015, permanent employment contracts increased by 48.8 percent, boosted by nationwide tax break.&lt;ref name="theflorentine.net"/&gt;

===Tourism===
[[File:Florencja Il Porcelino RB.jpg|thumb|left|Tourists flock to the [[Porcellino|Fontana del Porcellino]].]]
Tourism is the most significant industry in central Florence. From April to October, tourists outnumber local population. Tickets to the Uffizi and Accademia museums are regularly sold out and large groups regularly fill the basilicas of [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Santa Croce]] and [[Basilica of Santa Maria Novella|Santa Maria Novella]], both of which charge for entry. Tickets for The Uffizi and Accademia can be purchased online prior to visiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Florence, Italy: Tourist Travel Guide for Holidays in Florence, Firenze, Italy|url = http://www.visitflorence.com/|website = www.visitflorence.com|accessdate = 28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, readers of ''[[Travel + Leisure]]'' magazine ranked the city as their third favourite tourist destination.&lt;ref name="travelandleisure.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/worldsbest/2010/cities |title=Travel + Leisure |publisher=Travelandleisure.com |accessdate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Condé Nast Travel readers voted Florence as the best city in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2016-07-01/best-things-to-do-in-florence-italy |title=15 Best Things to Do in Florence, Italy |website=Cntraveler.com |accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies by Euromonitor International have concluded that cultural and history-oriented tourism is generating significantly increased spending throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euromonitor.com/Tourists_spend_more_than_ever_before_on_cultural_destinations Tourists spend more than ever before on cultural destinations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209035854/http://www.euromonitor.com/Tourists_spend_more_than_ever_before_on_cultural_destinations |date=9 February 2010 }} (for 2004–2005) at Euromonitor International&lt;/ref&gt;

Florence is believed to have the greatest concentration of art (in proportion to its size) in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://florenceart.net/studyabroad/ |title=Study Abroad in Florence Italy – Florentine artisan courses for school groups |publisher=Florenceart.net |accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, cultural tourism is particularly strong, with world-renowned museums such as the Uffizi selling over 1.93&amp;nbsp;million tickets in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italy24.ilsole24ore.com/art/arts-and-leisure/2015-08-18/museums-by-the-numbers-184743.php?uuid=AC5dGMj|title=Florence's Uffizi leading the pack in terms of visitors' numbers, after the Colosseum and Pompeii|website=Florence’s Uffizi leading the pack in terms of visitors’ numbers, after the Colosseum and Pompeii|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's convention centre facilities were restructured during the 1990s and host exhibitions, conferences, meetings, social forums, concerts and other events all year.

[[File:Restaurant in the Piazza del Duomo, Florence, Italy.jpg|thumb|Tourists and restaurant in the Piazza del Duomo]]

In 2016, Florence had 20,588 hotel rooms in 570 facilities. International visitors use 75% of the rooms; some 18% of those were from the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;https://hvs.com/Print/In-Focus-Florence-Italy?id=7942&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the city had 8.5 million overnight stays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism-review.com/florence-a-record-year-for-the-tourism-industry-news4438#SFAqOL1Wp75gEeRq.99|title=Florence: A Record Year for the Tourism Industry - .TR|first=Bill Alen,|last=Bill.Alen@tourism-review.com|website=Tourism-review.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Euromonitor report indicates that in 2015 the city ranked as the world's 36th most visited in the world, with over 4.95&amp;nbsp;million arrivals for the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.euromonitor.com/Top-100-Cities-Destinations_Thank-You.html?aliId=115886864|title=Euromonitor International's Top City Destinations Ranking |publisher=Euromonitor.com |date=2016|accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism brings revenue to Florence, but it creates certain problems. The Ponte Vecchio, The [[Mercato Centrale (Florence)|San Lorenzo Market]] and Santa Maria Novella are plagued by pickpockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourcoffeebreak.co.uk/lifestyle/26338763698/where-in-europe-are-you-most-likely-to-be-a-victim-of-pickpocketing/|title=Where in Europe are you Most Likely to be a Victim of Pickpocketing?|website=Yourcoffeebreak.co.uk|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The province of Florence receives roughly 13 million visitors per year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism-review.com/florence-a-record-year-for-the-tourism-industry-news4438|title=Florence: A Record Year for the Tourism Industry - .TR|first=Bill Alen,|last=Bill.Alen@tourism-review.com|website=Tourism-review.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in peak seasons, that can lead to over crowding at popular locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thelocal.it/20160718/italys-holiday-hotspots-struggling-with-too-many-tourists|title=Italian hotspots struggling with 'too many tourists'|date=18 July 2016|website=Thelocal.it|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor Dario Nardella is particularly concerned about visitors who arrive on buses, stay only a few hours, spend little money but contribute significantly to overcrowding. "No museum visit, just a photo from the square, the bus back and then on to Venice... We don’t want tourists like that," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/06/florence-risk-tourists-buildings|title=Florence seeks a better class of tourist to share its besieged medieval treasures|first=Stephanie|last=Kirchgaessner|date=6 December 2015|accessdate=28 October 2017|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some tourists are less than respectful of the city's cultural heritage, according to Nardella. In June 2017, he instituted a programme of spraying church steps with water to prevent tourists from using such areas as picnic spots. While he values the benefits of tourism, there has been "an increase among those who  sit down on church steps, eat their food and leave rubbish strewn on them," he explained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/31/florence-mayor-dario-nardella-hosepipes-basilica-santa-croce|title=Florence mayor aims to keep picnicking tourists at bay with hosepipes|first=Angela|last=Giuffrida|date=31 May 2017|accessdate=28 October 2017|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; To boost the sale of traditional foods, the mayor had introduced legislation (enacted in 2016) that requires restaurants to use typical Tuscan products and rejected McDonald's application to open a location in the  Piazza del Duomo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/florence-church-tourists-water-wet-hose-santa-croce-basilica-picnics-eating-food-italy-a7767111.html|title=Florence is hosing down monuments to deter tourists|date=1 June 2017|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food and wine production===
[[File:Fiaschi of basic Chianti.jpg|right|thumb|''Fiascos'' of basic Chianti.]]
Food and wine have long been an important staple of the economy. The [[Chianti]] region is just south of the city, and its [[Sangiovese]] grapes figure prominently not only in its [[Chianti|Chianti Classico]] wines but also in many of the more recently developed Supertuscan blends. Within {{convert|32|km|abbr=on}} to the west is the Carmignano area, also home to flavourful sangiovese-based reds. The celebrated Chianti Rufina district, geographically and historically separated from the main Chianti region, is also few kilometres east of Florence. More recently, the Bolgheri region (about {{convert|150|km|0|abbr=on}} southwest of Florence) has become celebrated for its "[[Super Tuscan]]" reds such as [[Sassicaia]] and [[Ornellaia]].&lt;ref name=OCW-bol&gt;{{cite web|last=Oxford Companion to Wine |title=Bolgheri |url=http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=369 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808193907/https://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=369 |archivedate=8 August 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Uffizi Hallway.jpg|thumb|[[Uffizi]] hallway]]
Florentine architects such as Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1466) and Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472) were among the fathers of both Renaissance and [[Neoclassical architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studymode.com/essays/Why-Was-Florence-Considered-Important-For-74009.html |title=Why Was Florence Considered Important For Culture And Arts? – Essay – Michellekim |publisher=StudyMode.com |accessdate=14 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cathedral, topped by Brunelleschi's dome, dominates the Florentine skyline. The Florentines decided to start building it – late in the 13th century, without a design for the dome. The project proposed by Brunelleschi in the 14th century was the largest ever built at the time, and the first major dome built in Europe since the two great domes of Roman times – the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome, and [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]]. The dome of Santa Maria del Fiore remains the largest brick construction of its kind in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tripleman.com/index.php?showimage=737 |title=The Duomo of Florence &amp;#124; Tripleman |publisher=www.tripleman.com |accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brunelleschisdome.com/ |title=brunelleschi's dome – Brunelleschi's Dome |publisher=Brunelleschisdome.com |accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In front of it is the medieval Baptistery. The two buildings incorporate in their decoration the transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance. In recent years, most of the important works of art from the two buildings – and from the nearby [[Giotto's Campanile]], have been removed and replaced by copies. The originals are now housed in the Museum dell'Opera del Duomo, just to the east of the Cathedral.

Florence has large numbers of art-filled churches, such as San Miniato al Monte, San Lorenzo, Santa Maria Novella, Santa Trinita, Santa Maria del Carmine, Santa Croce, Santo Spirito, the Annunziata, Ognissanti and numerous others.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;

===Language===
{{Main|Florentine dialect}}
{{See also|Tuscan language}}

Florentine (''fiorentino''), spoken by inhabitants of Florence and its environs, is a [[Tuscan Language|Tuscan dialect]] and the immediate [[Proto-language|parent language]] to modern Italian.

Its vocabulary and pronunciation are largely identical to standard Italian, though the hard ''c'' {{IPA|[k]}} between two vowels (as in ''ducato'') is pronounced as a [[Voiceless glottal fricative|fricative]] {{IPA|[h]}}, similar to an English ''h''. This gives Florentines a highly recognisable accent (the so-called [[Tuscan gorgia|gorgia toscana]]). Other traits include using a form of the [[subjunctive mood]] last commonly used in medieval times,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} a frequent usage in everyday speech of the modern subjunctive, and a shortened pronunciation of the [[article (grammar)|definite article]], {{IPA|[i]}} instead of "il".

Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio pioneered the use of the vernacular&lt;ref name="florenceholidays.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.florenceholidays.com/florence-vacation-literature-in-florence.html |title=Literature in Florence, Florentine Writers and Poets |publisher=Florenceholidays.com |accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of the Latin used for most literary works at the time.

===Literature===
[[File:Decamaron intro.jpg|thumb|The introduction of the ''Decameron'' (1350–1353) by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]].]]
Despite Latin being the main language of the courts and the Church in the Middle Ages, writers such as Dante Alighieri&lt;ref name="florenceholidays.com"/&gt; and many others used their own language, the Florentine vernacular descended from Latin, in composing their greatest works. The oldest literary pieces written in Florentine go as far back as the 13th century. Florence's literature fully blossomed in the 14th century, when not only Dante with his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' (1306–1321) and Petrarch, but also poets such as [[Guido Cavalcanti]] and [[Lapo Gianni]] composed their most important works.&lt;ref name="florenceholidays.com"/&gt; Dante's masterpiece is the ''Divine Comedy'', which mainly deals with the poet himself taking an allegoric and moral tour of Hell, Purgatory and finally Heaven, during which he meets numerous mythological or real characters of his age or before. He is first guided by the Roman poet [[Virgil]], whose non-Christian beliefs damned him to Hell. Later on he is joined by [[Divine Comedy|Beatrice]], who guides him through Heaven.&lt;ref name="florenceholidays.com"/&gt;

In the 14th century, [[Petrarch]]&lt;ref name="florenceholidays"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.florenceholidays.com/florence-vacation-literature-in-florence-petrarch-boccaccio.html |title=Literature in Florence – Petrarch and Boccaccio, Florentine Writers and Poet: Petrarch and Boccaccio |publisher=Florenceholidays.com |accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]&lt;ref name="florenceholidays"/&gt; led the literary scene in Florence after Dante's death in 1321. Petrarch was an all-rounder writer, author and poet, but was particularly known for his ''[[Il Canzoniere|Canzoniere]]'', or the Book of Songs, where he conveyed his unremitting love for Laura.&lt;ref name="florenceholidays"/&gt; His style of writing has since become known as ''Petrarchism''.&lt;ref name="florenceholidays"/&gt; Boccaccio was better known for his ''[[The Decameron|Decameron]]'', a slightly grim story of Florence during the 1350s bubonic plague, known as the [[Black Death]], when some people fled the ravaged city to an isolated country mansion, and spent their time there recounting stories and novellas taken from the medieval and contemporary tradition. All of this is written in a series of 100 distinct novellas.&lt;ref name="florenceholidays"/&gt;

In the 16th century, during the Renaissance, Florence was the home town of political writer and philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli, whose ideas on how rulers should govern the land, detailed in ''The Prince'', spread across European courts and enjoyed enduring popularity for centuries. These principles became known as ''[[Machiavellianism]]''.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Florence}}
{{See also|Music of Tuscany}}
[[File:Teatro della Pergola, Firenze 1.JPG|thumb|The Teatro della Pergola.]]
Florence became a musical centre during the Middle Ages and music and the performing arts remain an important part of its culture. The growth of Northern Italian Cities in the 1500s likely contributed to its increased prominence. During the Renaissance, there were four kinds of musical patronage in the city with respect to both sacred and secular music: state, corporate, church, and private.[73] It was here that the [[Florentine Camerata]] convened in the mid-16th century and experimented with setting tales of Greek mythology to music and staging the result—in other words, the first operas, setting the wheels in motion not just for the further development of the operatic form, but for later developments of separate "classical" forms such as the symphony and concerto.  After the year 1600, Italian trends prevailed across Europe, by 1750 it was the primary musical language. The genre of the [[Madrigal]], born in Italy, gained popularity in Britain and elsewhere. Several Italian cities were "larger on the musical map than their real-size for power suggested. Florence, was once such city which experienced a fantastic period in the early seventeenth Century of musico-theatrical innovation, including the beginning and flourishing of opera.&lt;ref name="Hanning, Barbara Russano 2010. pg. 182"&gt;.Hanning, Barbara Russano, J. Peter Burkholder, Donald Jay Grout, and Claude V. Palisca. Concise History of Western Music. New York: W.W. Norton, 2010.pg. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opera was invented in Florence in the late 16th century when Jacobo Peri's ''Dafne'' an opera in the style of [[monody]], was premiered.[74]  Opera spread from Florence throughout Italy and eventually Europe.  Vocal Music in the choir setting was also taking new identity at this time.  At the beginning of the 17th century, two practices for writing music were devised, one the first practice or ''[[Stile Antico]]/Prima Prattica'' the other the ''[[Stile Moderno]]/Secondo Prattica''.  The Stile Antico was more prevalent in Northern Europe and Stile Moderno was practiced more by the Italian Composers of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Grout, Donald Jay, Donald Jay Grout, and Claude V. Palisca. A History of Western Music. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

Composers and musicians who have lived in Florence include Piero Strozzi (1550 – after 1608), Giulio Caccini (1551–1618) and Mike Francis (1961–2009). Giulio Caccini's book ''Le Nuove Musiche'' was significant in performance practice technique instruction at the time.&lt;ref name="Hanning, Barbara Russano 2010. pg. 182"/&gt;  The book specified a new term, in use by the 1630s, called [[monody]] which indicated the combination of voice and [[basso continuo]] and connoted a practice of stating text in a free, lyrical, yet speech-like manner.  This would occur while an instrument, usually a keyboard type such as [[harpsichord]], played and held chords while the singer sang/spoke the monodic line.&lt;ref&gt;Bonds, Mark E.,Etd. Kassell, Richard. A History of Music in Western Culture. Combined Volume.3rd edition. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ. {{ISBN|0-205-64531-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinema===
Florence has been a setting for numerous works of fiction and movies, including the novels and associated films, such as ''[[The Light in the Piazza (novel)|Light in the Piazza]]'', ''[[Calmi Cuori Appassionati]]'', ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]'', ''[[A Room with a View (1986 film)|A Room with a View]]'', ''[[Tea with Mussolini]]'', ''[[Virgin Territory]]'' and ''[[Inferno (2016 film)|Inferno]]''. The city is home to renowned Italian actors and actresses, such as [[Roberto Benigni]], [[Leonardo Pieraccioni]] and [[Vittoria Puccini]].

===Cuisine===
[[File:Bistecca alla fiorentina-01.jpg|thumb|Florentine steak in Florence]]
Florentine food grows out of a tradition of peasant eating rather than rarefied high cooking. The majority of dishes are based on meat. The whole animal was traditionally eaten; [[tripe]] (''trippa'') and stomach (''[[lampredotto]]'') were once regularly on the menu and still are sold at the food carts stationed throughout the city. [[Antipasto|Antipasti]] include ''crostini toscani'', sliced bread rounds topped with a chicken liver-based [[pâté]], and sliced meats (mainly [[prosciutto]] and [[salame]], often served with melon when in season). The typically saltless Tuscan bread, obtained with natural [[levain]] frequently features in Florentine courses, especially in its soups, ''[[ribollita]]'' and ''[[pappa al pomodoro]]'', or in the salad of bread and fresh vegetables called ''[[panzanella]]'' that is served in summer. The ''[[T-bone steak|bistecca alla fiorentina]]'' is a large (the customary size should weigh around {{convert|1.2|to|1.5|kg|oz|-1|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) – the "date" steak – [[T-bone steak]] of [[Chianina]] beef cooked over hot charcoal and served very rare with its more recently derived version, the ''tagliata'', sliced rare beef served on a bed of [[Eruca sativa|arugula]], often with slices of [[Parmigiano-Reggiano|Parmesan cheese]] on top. Most of these courses are generally served with local [[olive oil]], also a prime product enjoying a worldwide reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=welcometuscany.it|url=http://www.welcometuscany.it/special_interest/wine_food_olive_oil/olive_oil.htm |title=Tuscany italy tuscany tourists guide, travel tips extra virgin olive oil wines and foods of the most beautiful land in the world |publisher=welcometuscany.it |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Among the desserts, ''schiacciata alla fiorentina'', a white flatbread cake, is one of the most popular; it is a very soft cake, prepared with extremely simple ingredients as typical  of  Florentine cuisine, and  is especially eaten at [[Carnival]].

===Science and discovery===
[[File:Museo di Storia Naturale di Firenze - paleontology.JPG|thumb|left|A display of [[proboscidean]]s in the [[Museo di Storia Naturale di Firenze]], or the Natural History Museum of Florence]]
Florence has been an important scientific centre for centuries, notably during the Renaissance with scientists such as Leonardo da Vinci.

Florentines were one of the driving forces behind the [[Age of Discovery]]. Florentine bankers financed Henry the Navigator and the Portuguese explorers who pioneered the route around Africa to India and the Far East. It was a map drawn by the Florentine [[Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli]], a student of Brunelleschi, that [[Christopher Columbus]] used to sell his "enterprise" to the Spanish monarchs, and which he used on his first voyage. Mercator's "Projection" is a refined version of Toscanelli's – taking into account the Americas, of which the Florentine was, obviously, ignorant.

[[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and other scientists pioneered the study of optics, ballistics, astronomy, anatomy, and so on. Pico della Mirandola, Leonardo Bruni, Machiavelli, and many others laid the groundwork for our understanding of science.

By the year 1300 Florence had become a centre of textile production in Europe.

''Dressing Renaissance Florence: Families, Fortunes, and Fine Clothing''. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Florence is regarded by some as the birthplace and earliest centre of the modern (post World War Two) fashion industry in Italy. The Florentine "soirées" of the early 1950s organised by Giovanni Battista Giorgini were events where several Italian designers participated in group shows and first garnered international attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gbgiorgini.it/italianfashion.htm |title=The birth of italian fashion |publisher=Gbgiorgini.it |date= |accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florence has served as the home of the Italian fashion company [[Salvatore Ferragamo Italia S.p.A.|Salvatore Ferragamo]] since 1928. [[Gucci]], [[Roberto Cavalli]], and [[Emilio Pucci]] are also headquartered in Florence. Other major players in the fashion industry such as [[Prada]] and [[Chanel]] have large offices and stores in Florence or its outskirts. Florence's main upscale shopping street is [[Via de' Tornabuoni]], where major luxury fashion houses and jewellery labels, such as [[Armani]] and [[Bulgari]], have their elegant boutiques. Via del Parione and Via Roma are other streets that are also well known for their high-end fashion stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cntraveller.com/guides/europe/italy/florence/where-to-shop |title=Conde Nast Traveller's guide to shopping in Florence |publisher=Cntraveller.com |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical evocations===

====''Scoppio del Carro''====
The ''[[Scoppio del carro|Scoppio del Carro]]'' ("Explosion of the Cart") is a celebration of the [[First Crusade]]. During the day of Easter, a cart, which the Florentines call the ''Brindellone'' and which is led by four white oxen, is taken to the [[Piazza del Duomo, Florence|Piazza del Duomo]] between the Baptistery of [[John the Baptist|St. John the Baptist]] (''Battistero di San Giovanni'') and the [[Florence Cathedral]] (''Santa Maria del Fiore''). The cart is connected by a rope to the interior of the church. Near the cart there is a model of a dove, which, according to legend, is a symbol of good luck for the city: at the end of the Easter mass, the dove emerges from the nave of the Duomo and ignites the fireworks on the cart.

====''Calcio Storico''====
[[File:Calcio Storico Corteo.jpg|thumb|Calcio Storico]]
{{See also|Calcio Fiorentino}}

''Calcio Storico Fiorentino'' ("Historic Florentine [[Association football|Football]]"), sometimes called ''Calcio in costume'', is a traditional sport, regarded as a forerunner of soccer, though the actual gameplay most closely resembles rugby. The event originates from the [[Middle Ages]], when the most important Florentine nobles amused themselves playing while wearing bright costumes. The most important match was played on 17 February 1530, during the [[Siege of Florence (1529–1530)|siege of Florence]]. That day [[Papal States|Papal troops]] besieged the city while the Florentines, with contempt of the enemies, decided to play the game notwithstanding the situation. The game is played in the Piazza di [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Santa Croce]]. A temporary arena is constructed, with bleachers and a sand-covered playing field. A series of matches are held between four teams representing each ''quartiere ''(quarter) of Florence during late June and early July.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calciostorico.it/ Calcio Storico Fiorentino (Official site)] {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four teams: Azzurri (light blue), Bianchi (white), Rossi (red) and Verdi (green). The Azzurri are from the quarter of Santa Croce, Bianchi from the quarter of Santo Spirito, Verdi are from San Giovanni and Rossi from Santa Maria Novella.

=== Sport ===
[[File:Soccer in Florence, Italy, 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Stadio Artemio Franchi]]]]
In [[association football]] Florence is represented by [[ACF Fiorentina]], which plays in [[Serie A]], the top league of [[Football in Italy|Italian league system]].
[[ACF Fiorentina]] has won two Italian Championships since their formation in 1926. They play their games at the [[Stadio Artemio Franchi]], which currently holds 47,282.
The female squad of ACF Fiorentina have won the women's association football Italian Championship of the 2016-17 season.

The city is home of [[Coverciano]], the main training ground of the [[Italy national football team|Italian national team]], and the technical department of the [[Italian Football Federation]].

Florence was selected to host the 2013 UCI World Road Cycling Championships.

Since 2017 Florence is also represented in Eccellenza, the top tier of [[rugby union]] league system in Italy, by I Medicei, which is a club established in 2015 by the merging of the senior squads of I Cavalieri (of [[Prato]]) and Firenze Rugby 1931.
I Medicei won the Serie A Championship in 2016-17 and were promoted to Eccellenza for the 2017-18 season.

[[RN Florentia|Rari Nantes Florentia]] is a successful [[water polo]] club based in Florence; both its male and female squads have won several Italian championships and the female squad has also European titles in their palmarès.

The principal public transit network in the city is run by the [http://www.ataf.net/Default.aspx?LN=en-US ATAF and Li-nea] bus company. Individual tickets, or a pass called Carta Agile with multiple rides, should be purchased in advance and are available at local tobacconists, bars and newspaper stalls and must be validated once on board. These tickets may be used on ATAF and Li-nea buses, Tramvia and second-class local trains only within city railway stations. Train tickets must be validated before boarding.The main bus station is next to Santa Maria Novella [[railway station]]. [[Trenitalia]] runs trains between the railway stations within the city, and to other destinations around Italy and Europe. The central railway station, [[Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station|Santa Maria Novella]], is about {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} northwest of the Piazza del Duomo. There are two other important stations: [[Firenze Campo di Marte railway station|Campo di Marte]] and [[Firenze Rifredi railway station|Rifredi]]. Most bundled routes are Firenze—Pisa, Firenze—Viareggio and Firenze-Arezzo (along the main line to Rome). Other local railways connect Florence with [[Borgo San Lorenzo]] in the Mugello area (Faentina railway) and [[Siena]].

Long distance {{convert|10|km|2|abbr=on}} buses are run by the SITA, Copit, CAP companies. The transit companies also accommodate travellers from the [[Amerigo Vespucci Airport]], which is {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of the city centre, and which has scheduled services run by major European carriers.

=== Trams ===
In an effort to reduce air pollution and car traffic in the city, a multi-line tram network called ''Tramvia'' is under construction. The first line began operation on 14 February 2010 and connects Florence's primary intercity railway station ([[Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station|Santa Maria Novella]]) with the southwestern suburb of [[Scandicci]]. This line is {{convert|7.4|km|1|abbr=on}} long and has 14 stops. The construction of a second line began on 5 November 2011, construction was stopped due to contractors' difficulties and restarted in 2014, completion is now scheduled for 2018. This second line will connect Florence's airport with the city centre. A third line (from [[Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station|Santa Maria Novella]] to the Careggi area, where are the most important hospitals of Florence) is also under construction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arriva La Tramvia (in Italian)|url=http://www.gestramvia.it/home.html|publisher=GEST|accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.firenze.it/opencms/export/sites/retecivica/amm/piani_e_progetti/Tramvia.html |title=Tramvia – Il Sistema Tramviario Fiorentino |accessdate=11 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202152941/http://www.comune.firenze.it/opencms/export/sites/retecivica/amm/piani_e_progetti/Tramvia.html |archivedate=2 February 2012 }}, Tramvia page of Florence's city government web site (in Italian).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Trams in Florence]], Wikipedia article "Florence tramway"&lt;/ref&gt;

He curated the major exhibit "Facing History: The Black Image in American Art 1710-1940" which dealt with the image of African-Americans in American art.

==Early life and education==
Guy C. McElroy was the son of Geraldine (née Woods) and George E. McElroy, Sr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geraldine McElroy  Obituary  - Fairmont, West Virginia - Tributes.com|url=http://www.tributes.com/obituary/show/Geraldine-McElroy-89243121|website=www.tributes.com|accessdate=27 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raised in his native Fairmont, West Virginia McElroy earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from local [[Fairmont State University|Fairmont State College]] in 1970. After he earned a master's degree in art history from the [[University of Cincinnati]] in 1972, he acquired a second Master's in Mass Communications from Boston's [[Emerson College]] in 1975.

He held the position of [[Rockefeller Fellow]] in Museum Studies at the [[Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco]] from 1974 to 1975. He followed that position with several assistant curator roles in West and East Coast public galleries and museums. Beginning in 1978 McElroy spent 10 years at Washington, DC's [[Mary McLeod Bethune Council House National Historic Site|Bethune Museum-Archive]], first as curator and then as assistant director. It was as adjunct curator of the Corcoran Gallery where he completed his work on "Facing History."

Becoming a quadriplegic after a 1987 New Mexico automobile accident, McElroy began using a wheelchair.

He died at 44, only five months after initial publication of the catalog for "Facing History,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McElroy|first1=Guy C.|last2=Gates|first2=Henry Louis|last3=Art|first3=Corcoran Gallery of|last4=Museum|first4=Brooklyn|title=Facing history: the Black image in American art, 1710-1940|publisher=Bedford Arts|isbn=9780938491385|page=vi|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Facing_history.html?id=1d1PAAAAMAAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;" from a pulmonary embolism at [[George Washington University Hospital]] in Washington, DC having nearly completed a Ph.D. in art history from the [[University of Maryland]].

==Facing History==
"Facing History: The Black Image in American Art, 1710-1940," was the first public display by a major museum to showcase depictions of [[African-Americans]] in American art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kastor|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Kastor|first2=Elizabeth|title=GUY MCELROY, FACING HIS FUTURE|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1990/01/14/guy-mcelroy-facing-his-future/77b55f94-9116-4a11-92ff-905e3bc2c852/|accessdate=25 February 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=14 January 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show examined ways in which American artists "reinforced a number of largely restrictive stereotypes of black identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guy C.

Both works by approximately 80&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=BOLLE|first1=SONJA|title=FACING HISTORY  by Guy C. McElroy (Bedford Arts/The Corcoran Gallery of Art: $50; 141 pp.)|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-02-18/books/bk-1702_1_visual-image|accessdate=25 February 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=18 February 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; African American and European American artists were featured in the exhibition of drawing, painting and sculpture. In McElroy's view these works depict the attitude of society toward African-Americans through the works themselves and the response they received in the marketplace. The works make overt political statements, as well as, address contemporary issues. Stereotypes, slavery and violence dominate the images. But as McElroy states in the show's catalog:

{{quote frame |quote=Depictions of black people can no longer rely on gross distortions of physiognomy or character to achieve racially motivated humor, but the symbolic power of visual images remains insidious. Jim Crow, Uncle Tom, Mammy, the Comic Darkey and Zip Coon no longer dominate images of African-Americans in painting and sculpture, but their ghosts live on in a host of popular mediums, most notably in the violence of action serials and the stereotyped behavior of television sitcoms.|author=Guy C. McElroy|source="Introduction: Race and Representation", ''Facing History'', 1990}}

'''Han Mahmud''' (Khan Mahmud) was a 19th-century [[Kurd]]ish Lord.

He was born in [[Mukus]] (now [[Van, Turkey]]), and after his father Abdi Beg's death, he became Lord (Mir) of the Mukus Kurdish Emirate.

In 1847, he fought in a Kurdish revolt against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], which was organized with Bedirhan Beg, the Lord of Cizır-Botan.  The revolt was quashed, Bedirhan Beg was exiled to Crete, and Han Mahmud was exiled to [[Rousse]] (now a [[Bulgaria]]n city). Han Mahmud died in Rousse in 1866.

In 2011 Robinson published ''A Force to be Reckoned With'', a history of the [[Women's Institute]]; she says in the introduction that "the WI members I've come across - past as well as present - have had more humour, courage, spirit, eccentricity and common sense than any other individuals I've ever written about.

Mısırlıoğlu, "Shakespeare İngiliz değildi. İngiltere'de bu isimde bir adam gelmemişti. Shakespeare'in aslı Şeyh Pir'dir, üstad, ihtiyar. Ve Shakespeare gizli bir Müslüman'dı. 500 yıl önce yazdığı bir tiyatro oyununu bugün İngiliz bir çocuk okusa bugün  yazılmış gibi anlar" dedi." (translation: Mısırlıoğlu also claimed that Shakespeare was actually a Muslim. Mısırlıoğlu said, "Shakespeare was not English, a man of this name did not come from England, Shakespeare's original name means Sheikh Pir, master, old man, and Shakespeare was a secret Muslim."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beeston's Boys''' was the popular and colloquial name of '''The King and Queen's Young Company''', a troupe of [[boy player|boy actors]] of the [[Literature in English#Caroline and Cromwellian literature|Caroline]] period, active mainly in the years 1637–1642.

==Origin==
The troupe was formed in early 1637, under a royal warrant, by the theatre manager and impresario [[Christopher Beeston]], during a time of disorder and reorganisation in the theatre profession; the London playhouses had been closed since the summer of 1636 because of [[bubonic plague]]. The creation of a company of boy actors was a return to a practice of the early 17th century, the era of companies like the [[Children of Paul's]] and the [[Children of the Chapel]]. Those companies, while controversial in their time, had been effective at developing and educating young talent, to the eventual benefit of the adult companies and the theatrical profession as a whole. Beeston's formation of the Young Company was an attempt to recover that training function – as well as to provide effective drama while paying relatively less in actors' salaries.

(A similar attempt to form a boy's company had been made eight years previously, in 1629, by [[Richard Gunnell]], who built the [[Salisbury Court Theatre]]. But it was not a success, because of a long theatre closure due to plague.)&lt;ref&gt;Gurr, ''Shakespearean Stage'', pp. 63–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The King and Queen's Young Company was onstage in early 1637, and was a hit; they and their reputation quickly entered public consciousness under their popular nickname. Yet the theatrical profession, in a time of plague and looming revolution, remained challenging; when Christopher Beeston died in 1638, his control of acting troupes and theatres (the [[Cockpit Theatre|Cockpit]] and the [[Red Bull Theatre|Red Bull]]) passed to his son and successor [[William Beeston]], who was notably less successful than his father. (This period of crisis would likely have been difficult to navigate, even for a very resourceful individual.) William Beeston inherited the Phoenix theatre from his father and everything that went with it, which included the young company Beeston’s Boys. While Beeston had none of the experience that his father had, he still took on the mantle of managing the company since he had “a one-twelfth interest in the King and Queen’s young company” &lt;ref&gt;Bentley, Gerald Eades. The Jacobean and Caroline Stage. Vol. 2. Oxford: Clarendon, 1941. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The owner==
Christopher Beeston was a very talented man that "managed five Phoenix companies: Queen Anne's (1617–19), Prince Charles’s (1619–22), Lady Elizabeth’s (1622–5), Henrietta Maria’s (1625–37) and the King and Queen’s Young company".&lt;ref&gt;Sturgess, Keith. ''Jacobean Private Theatre''. Vol. 6. London: Routledge &amp; K. Paul, 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Beeston already had an immense amount of experience in the theatre profession from managing these companies and he also had the copyright to many of the plays performed at the Phoenix, which was very unordinary at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Sturgess, Keith. ''Jacobean Private Theatre''. Vol. 6. London: Routledge &amp; K. Paul, 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Beeston’s Boys performed plays including ''Cupid's Revenge'', ''The Knight of the Burning Pestle'' and ''The Court Beggar''.&lt;ref&gt;Munro, Lucy. ''Children of the Queen's Revels: A Jacobean Theatre Repertory.'' Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The last play, ''The Court Beggar'', got Beeston's Boys in a severe amount of trouble that resulted in [[William Davenant]] taking over the theatre for an interim time. By possessing such a large repertoire, the Beeston's Boys were able to quickly get up and running and compete with such acting companies like the Queen's Men. William Beeston was then sworn as governor of the company to succeed his father on 5 April 1639 (Bentley 1:330)

==Personnel==
Beeston's boys were older than the pre-pubescent actors of the previous generation; they tended to be adolescents and young men in their 20s, and included some older Shareholders in the company. The company was one of the first hybrid acting companies of young adults and already established actors. Some veterans from [[Queen Henrietta's Men]], the previous occupants of Beeston's [[Cockpit Theatre]], joined the new group: [[Queen Henrietta's Men#Personnel|Ezekiel Fenn]], a [[boy player]] experienced in female roles; [[Theophilus Bird]]; [[Queen Henrietta's Men#Personnel|Robert Axell]]; [[Queen Henrietta's Men#Personnel|John Page]]; and [[Queen Henrietta's Men#Personnel|George Stutfield]], who apparently moved from performance to management.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; These older men were also believed to act as the instructors of the younger members, and the title of "teacher" was not vested entirely in one man. It was instead given to anyone answerable to the authority and who were also shareholders in the company. In 1638, [[King's Men personnel|Nicholas Burt]] came from the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], and stayed with Beeston's Boys until the theatres closed in 1642.

A roster of the troupe from 1639 also lists [[Robert Cox (actor)|Robert Cox]],  Edward Davenport, Edward Gibbes, [[John Lacy (playwright)|John Lacy]], Samuel Mannery, [[Michael Mohun]], [[Robert Shatterell]], [[King's Men personnel|William Trigg]], and John Wright.&lt;ref&gt;Gurr, ''Shakespearian Playing Companies'', p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Mannery and Wright had played female roles in ''[[Holland's Leaguer]]'' in 1631, with [[Prince Charles's Men]]. Edward Gibbes had been with the [[King's Revels Men]], and was an accomplished fencer. Upon Charles' Death in 1639, his son William took charge. Williams first move, as manager, was to have Richard Brome, a poet and dramatist for the Salisbury Court, secured for seven years as the chief poet for the Cockpit.

==The opening==
During the long hiatus of theatre due to the bubonic plague, Beeston was planning a new company to inhabit the Phoenix, without
the permission of the Lord Chamberlain. The opening performance of Beeston’s Boys did get Beeston into trouble; however he
received a ratification of the company which was post-dated to after the first performance. This leads scholars to believe
that the Lord Chamberlain was stepping in to help the company because of Beeston's favour with the higher ups.

The relationship between Lord Chamberlain Pembroke and Christopher Beeston was so close that it greatly advantaged the company. “Now running a company of youths...enjoying the Lord Chamberlain’s direct support, and retaining all the old Queen’s Men’s rich repertoire, Beeston’s position was strong indeed” (Butler 113). Beeston had many orders go in his favor, including one which happened a month after his incident of performing a play illegally. The order was that “no plays must be published without the permission of Beeston as manager of the King and Queen’s young company, or his successors in management”.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, Gerald Eades. The Jacobean and Caroline Stage. Vol. 2. Oxford: Clarendon, 1941. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In 1640 Beeston's Boys acted a play that offended King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] personally, by referring to his failure to suppress the Scottish Presbyterians during his recent expedition to the north. (Though the identity of the play is not known with certainty, [[Richard Brome]]'s ''[[The Court Beggar]]'' is perhaps the best candidate. The offending passages did not survive into the printed text.)

William Beeston was sent to the [[Marshalsea]] prison on 4 May 1640; Sir [[Henry Herbert (Master of the Revels)|Henry Herbert]], the [[Master of the Revels]], gave control of the theatres and their associated actors' companies to Sir [[William Davenant]], playwright and manager. During this time Beeston’s boys were not nearly as successful due to William Davenant's being busy with other endeavours at the time. Most of his time was possessed by something called “the Army Plot”.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, Gerald Eades. ''The Jacobean and Caroline Stage''. Vol. 1. Oxford: Clarendon, 1941. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord Chamberlain did not predict this when he gave the governor position to Davenant, so when Davenant fled the country the Lord Chamberlain was forced to bring William Beeston back. Due to this turn of events, Beeston was released on bail from the prison and reclaimed his position as governor of the Phoenix in 1641.

Also in 1640, Beeston's Boys were combined with adult actors to form the King and Queen's Company.

==Repertory==
Thanks to the decades-long career of their founder, the Beeston's Boys had a rich repertory of stage plays to draw upon, including works by the best playwrights of the Caroline age. In their short heyday, the boys acted:

{{col-end}}

This repertoire of plays was interesting considering most of the Beeston's Boys plays were placed in the charge of the Cockpit Theatre, and many of these plays also showed up in the repertoire of the Old Queen Henrietta’s Company. Suggesting that many of the members of the Beeston's Boys were formerly members of that company, or associated with them in some way. Christopher Beeston had an order passed that placed the repertoire of plays in the charge of the Cockpit Theatre. This strengthened the Beeston Boys ties to the Cockpit Theatre. Making it impossible for them to continue to produce plays if ever asked to leave the cockpit, and ensured them a theatre to perform at.

==Aftermath==

Beeston’s Boys were disbanded along with every other theatre in London when the Coup d’etat led by Oliver Cromwell happened. September 2, 1642 was the day that every theatre company was outlawed from performing.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, Gerald Eades. The Jacobean and Caroline Stage. Vol. 1. Oxford: Clarendon, 1941. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; There is not much else that is mentioned about Beeston’s Boys after this time, but it is suspected that the company continued acting in the 1650s since there is a reference of William Beeston training another group of boys to take the stage. Beeston made repairs to the theatre in 1650 in the hopes that the company could start anew.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, Gerald Eades. The Jacobean and Caroline Stage. Vol. 2. Oxford: Clarendon, 1941. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the [[London theatre closure 1642|London theatres were closed in 1642]], William Beeston maintained a long-term commitment to re-establishing the Beeston's Boys company. He made a significant effort in 1650, during the [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]]. Contrary to popular opinion, all dramatic activity in London did not cease with the 1642 closing of the theatres; there was a notable burst of activity in the late 1640s – players would perform plays for audiences, the London authorities would suppress them, and players would try again, whenever they thought they could get away with it. In the midst of this activity, William Beeston paid for repairs to the Cockpit Theatre and attempted to gather together a group of "apprentices and covenant servants" to train them for the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Shapiro, "The Introduction of Actresses in England: Delay or Defensiveness?," in Comensoli and Russell, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; The effort, unfortunately, came to nothing in a new and harsher round of suppression by local authorities.

Beeston had better luck at the start of the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], when he was able to recruit a new troupe of Beeston's Boys for a time. They played at the Cockpit and the [[Salisbury Court Theatre]] in the first few years of the Restoration era.

[[File:Primary Human Language Families Map.png|550px|thumb|Contemporary distribution (2005 map) of the world's major language families (in some cases geographic groups of families).&lt;br&gt;''For greater detail, see [[:Template:Distribution of languages in the world|Distribution of languages on Earth]].'']] 
A '''language family''' is a group of [[language]]s related through [[Genetic (linguistics)|descent]] from a common ''ancestral language'' or ''parental language'', called the [[proto-language]] of that family. The term "family" reflects the [[tree model]] of language origination in [[historical linguistics]], which makes use of a metaphor comparing languages to people in a biological [[family tree]], or in a subsequent modification, to species in a [[phylogenetic tree]] of evolutionary [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]. Linguists therefore describe the ''daughter languages'' within a language family as being ''genetically related''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Bruce M. |last1=Rowe |first2=Diane P. |last2=Levine|title=A Concise Introduction to Linguistics|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1317349288|pages=340–341|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePQ5CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA340|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "living language" is simply one that is used as the primary form of communication of a group of people. There are also many [[Language death|dead]] and [[Extinct language|extinct]] languages, as well as some that are still insufficiently studied to be classified, or are even unknown outside their respective speech communities.

Membership of languages in a language family is established by [[comparative linguistics]]. [[Sister language]]s are said to have a "genetic" or "genealogical" relationship. The latter term is older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lectures on the science of language: delivered at the Royal institution of Great Britain in April, May and June, 1861|first=Max |last=Müller |authorlink=Max Müller |location=London|publisher=Longman, Green, Longman and Roberts|year=1862|
edition=3rd|page=216|quote=The genealogical classification of the Aryan languages was founded, as we saw, on a close comparison of the grammatical characteristics of each;....}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers of a language family belong to a common [[speech community]]. The divergence of a proto-language into daughter languages typically occurs through geographical separation, with the original speech community gradually evolving into distinct linguistic units. Individuals belonging to other speech communities may also adopt languages from a different language family through the [[language shift]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dimmendaal|first1=Gerrit J.|title=Historical Linguistics and the Comparative Study of African Languages|date=2011|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=9027287228|page=336|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-PxyCpnnzEC&amp;pg=PA336|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genealogically related languages present shared retentions; that is, features of the proto-language (or reflexes of such features) that cannot be explained by chance or [[loanword|borrowing]] ([[Language convergence|convergence]]). Membership in a branch or group within a language family is established by shared innovations; that is, common features of those languages that are not found in the common ancestor of the entire family. For example, [[Germanic languages]] are "Germanic" in that they share vocabulary and grammatical features that are not believed to have been present in the [[Proto-Indo-European language]]. These features are believed to be innovations that took place in [[Proto-Germanic]], a descendant of Proto-Indo-European that was the source of all Germanic languages.

==Structure of a family==
Language families can be divided into smaller phylogenetic units, conventionally referred to as ''branches'' of the family because the history of a language family is often represented as a [[Phylogenetic tree|tree diagram]]. A family is a [[monophyly|monophyletic]] unit; all its members derive from a common ancestor, and all [[Attested language|attested]] descendants of that ancestor are included in the family. (Thus, the term ''family'' is analogous to the biological term ''[[clade]]''.) 

Some [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomists]] restrict the term ''family'' to a certain level, but there is little consensus in how to do so. Those who affix such labels also subdivide branches into ''groups'', and groups into ''complexes''. A top-level (i.e., the largest) family is often called a ''phylum'' or ''stock''. The closer the branches are to each other, the closer the languages will be related. This means if a branch off of a [[proto-language]] is 4 branches down and there is also a [[sister language]] to that fourth branch, than each of the two sister languages are more closely related to each other than to that common ancestral proto-language.

The term ''[[macrofamily]]'' or ''superfamily'' is sometimes applied to proposed groupings of language families whose status as phylogenetic units is generally considered to be unsubstantiated by accepted [[historical linguistics|historical linguistic]] methods. For example, the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Italic languages|Italic]], and [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] language families are branches of a larger [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family. There is a remarkably similar pattern shown by the linguistic tree and the genetic tree of human ancestry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henn |first=B. M. |last2=Cavalli-Sforza |first2=L. L. |authorlink2=Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza |last3=Feldman |first3=M.

===Dialect continua===
{{main|Dialect continuum}}

Some closely knit language families, and many branches within larger families, take the form of [[dialect continuum|dialect continua]] in which there are no clear-cut borders that make it possible to unequivocally identify, define, or count individual languages within the family. However, when the differences between the speech of different regions at the extremes of the continuum are so great that there is no [[mutual intelligibility]] between them, as occurs in [[Arabic]], the continuum cannot meaningfully be seen as a single language. 

A speech variety may also be considered either a language or a dialect depending on social or political considerations. Thus, different sources, especially over time, can give wildly different numbers of languages within a certain family. [[Classification of the Japonic languages|Classifications of the Japonic family]], for example, range from one language (a language isolate with dialects) to nearly twenty—until the classification of [[Ryukyuan language|Ryukyuan]] as separate languages within a [[Japonic language family]] rather than dialects of Japanese, the [[Japanese language]] itself was considered a [[language isolate]] and therefore the only language in its family.

===Isolates===
{{main|Language isolate}}
Most of the world's languages are known to be related to others. Those that have no known relatives (or for which family relationships are only tentatively proposed) are called [[language isolate]]s, essentially language families consisting of a single language. An example is [[Basque language|Basque]]. In general, it is assumed that language isolates have relatives or had relatives at some point in their history but at a time depth too great for linguistic comparison to recover them.

A language isolated in its own branch within a family, such as [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]] within Indo-European, is often also called an isolate, but the meaning of the word "isolate" in such cases is usually clarified with a [[Grammatical modifier|modifier]]. For instance, Albanian and Armenian may be referred to as an "Indo-European isolate". By contrast, so far as is known, the [[Basque language]] is an absolute isolate: it has not been shown to be related to any other language despite numerous attempts. Another well-known isolate is [[Mapudungun]], the Mapuche language from the [[Araucanian languages|Araucanían language family]] in Chile. A language may be said to be an isolate currently but not historically if related but now extinct relatives are attested. The [[Aquitanian language]], spoken in Roman times, may have been an ancestor of Basque, but it could also have been a sister language to the ancestor of Basque. In the latter case, Basque and Aquitanian would form a small family together. (Ancestors are not considered to be distinct members of a family.)

===Proto-languages===
{{main|Proto-language}}
A proto-language can be thought of as a mother language (not to be confused with a [[mother tongue]], which is one that a specific person has been exposed to from birth&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, Leonard. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gfrd-On5iFwC&amp;dq Language] {{ISBN|81-208-1196-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;), being the root which all languages in the family stem from. The common ancestor of a language family is seldom known directly since most languages have a relatively short recorded history. However, it is possible to recover many features of a proto-language by applying the [[comparative method]], a reconstructive procedure worked out by 19th century linguist [[August Schleicher]]. This can demonstrate the validity of many of the proposed families in the [[list of language families]]. For example, the reconstructible common ancestor of the Indo-European language family is called ''[[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]''. Proto-Indo-European is not attested by written records and so is conjectured to have been spoken before the invention of writing.

==Other classifications of languages==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}

=== Sprachbund ===
{{Main|Sprachbund}}

Shared innovations, acquired by borrowing or other means, are not considered genetic and have no bearing with the language family concept. It has been asserted, for example, that many of the more striking features shared by [[Italic languages]] ([[Latin]], [[Oscan language|Oscan]], [[Umbrian language|Umbrian]], etc.) might well be "[[areal feature]]s". However, very similar-looking alterations in the systems of long vowels in the [[West Germanic languages]] greatly postdate any possible notion of a proto-language innovation (and cannot readily be regarded as "areal", either, since English and continental West Germanic were not a linguistic area). In a similar vein, there are many similar unique innovations in Germanic, [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] that are far more likely to be areal features than traceable to a common proto-language. But legitimate uncertainty about whether shared innovations are areal features, coincidence, or inheritance from a common ancestor, leads to disagreement over the proper subdivisions of any large language family.

A [[sprachbund]] is a geographic area having several languages that feature common linguistic structures. The similarities between those languages are caused by language contact, not by chance or common origin, and are not recognized as criteria that define a language family. An example of a sprachbund would be the [[Indian subcontinent]].

===Contact languages===
{{main|Mixed language|Creole language}}
The concept of language families is based on the historical observation that languages develop [[dialect]]s, which over time may diverge into distinct languages. However, linguistic ancestry is less clear-cut than familiar biological ancestry, in which species do not crossbreed.&lt;ref name="ListNelson-Sathi2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=List|first1=Johann-Mattis|last2=Nelson-Sathi|first2=Shijulal|last3=Geisler|first3=Hans|last4=Martin|first4=William|title=Networks of lexical borrowing and lateral gene transfer in language and genome evolution|journal=BioEssays|volume=36|issue=2|year=2014|pages=141–150|issn=0265-9247|doi=10.1002/bies.201300096|pmid=24375688|pmc=3910147}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is more like the evolution of microbes, with extensive [[lateral gene transfer]]: Quite distantly related languages may affect each other through [[language contact]], which in extreme cases may lead to languages with no single ancestor, whether they be [[creole language|creoles]] or [[mixed language|mixed languages]]. In addition, a number of [[sign language|sign languages]] have developed in isolation and appear to have no relatives at all. Nonetheless, such cases are relatively rare and most well-attested languages can be unambiguously classified as belonging to one language family or another, even if this family's relation to other families is not known.

'''Marxism''' is a method of [[socioeconomic]] analysis that views [[Social class|class]] relations and [[social conflict]] using a [[Historical materialism|materialist interpretation of historical development]] and takes a [[dialectic]]al view of social transformation. It originates from the works of 19th-century German philosophers [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]].

Marxism uses a methodology, now known as [[historical materialism]], to analyze and critique the development of [[capitalism]] and the role of [[class struggle]]s in systemic economic change.

According to Marxist theory, class conflict arises in [[Capitalism|capitalist societies]] due to contradictions between the material interests of the oppressed [[proletariat]]—a class of wage labourers employed to produce goods and services—and the [[bourgeoisie]]—the [[ruling class]] that owns the [[means of production]] and extract their wealth through appropriation of the [[surplus product]] ([[Profit (economics)|profit]]) produced by the proletariat.

This class struggle that is commonly expressed as the revolt of a society's [[productive forces]] against its [[relations of production]], results in a period of short-term crises as the bourgeoisie struggle to manage the intensifying [[alienation of labor]] experienced by the proletariat, albeit with varying degrees of [[class consciousness]]. This crisis culminates in a [[proletarian revolution]] and eventually leads to the establishment of [[socialism]]—a socioeconomic system based on [[social ownership]] of the means of production, [[To each according to his contribution|distribution based on one's contribution]] and [[Production for use|production organized directly for use]]. As the productive forces continued to advance, Marx hypothesized that socialism would ultimately transform into a [[communist society]]; a classless, stateless, humane society based on [[common ownership]] and the underlying principle: "[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs]]".

Marxism has developed into many different branches and schools of thought, though now there is no single definitive Marxist theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolff and Resnick|first=Richard and Stephen|title=Economics: Marxian versus Neoclassical|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|date=August 1987|isbn=978-0-8018-3480-6|page=130|quote=The German Marxists extended the theory to groups and issues Marx had barely touched. Marxian analyses of the legal system, of the social role of women, of foreign trade, of international rivalries among capitalist nations, and the role of parliamentary democracy in the transition to socialism drew animated debates&amp;nbsp;... Marxian theory (singular) gave way to Marxian theories (plural).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different Marxian schools place a greater emphasis on certain aspects of [[classical Marxism]] while rejecting or modifying other aspects. Many schools of thought have sought to combine Marxian concepts and non-Marxian concepts, which has then led to contradictory conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Hara|first=Phillip|title=Encyclopedia of Political Economy, Volume 2|publisher=[[Routledge]]|date=September 2003|isbn=978-0-415-24187-8|page=107|quote=Marxist political economists differ over their definitions of capitalism, socialism and communism. These differences are so fundamental, the arguments among differently persuaded Marxist political economists have sometimes been as intense as their oppositions to political economies that celebrate capitalism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, lately there is movement toward the recognition that [[historical materialism]] and [[dialectical materialism]] remains the fundamental aspect of all [[Marxist schools of thought]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communism: The Great Misunderstanding|last=Ermak|first=Gennady|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=978-1533082893}}&lt;/ref&gt; which should result in more agreement between different schools.

== Etymology ==
The term "Marxism" was popularized by [[Karl Kautsky]], who considered himself an "orthodox" Marxist during the dispute between the orthodox and revisionist followers of Marx.&lt;ref name="Georges Haupt 2010. pp. 18–19"&gt;Georges Haupt, Peter Fawcett, Eric Hobsbawm. ''Aspects of International Socialism, 1871–1914: Essays by Georges Haupt''. Paperback Edition. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2010. pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Kautsky's revisionist rival [[Eduard Bernstein]] also later adopted use of the term.&lt;ref name="Georges Haupt 2010. pp. 18–19"/&gt; Engels did not support the use of the term "Marxism" to describe either Marx's or his views.&lt;ref name="Georges Haupt 2010. Pp. 12"&gt;Georges Haupt, Peter Fawcett, Eric Hobsbawm. ''Aspects of International Socialism, 1871–1914: Essays by Georges Haupt''. Paperback Edition. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2010. pp. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Engels claimed that the term was being abusively used as a rhetorical qualifier by those attempting to cast themselves as "real" followers of Marx while casting others in different terms, such as "Lassallians".&lt;ref name="Georges Haupt 2010. Pp. 12"/&gt; In 1882, Engels claimed that Marx had criticized self-proclaimed "Marxist" [[Paul Lafargue]], by saying that if Lafargue's views were considered "Marxist", then "one thing is certain and that is that I am not a Marxist".&lt;ref name="Georges Haupt 2010. Pp. 12"/&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|[[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883)]]
Marxism analyzes the material conditions and the economic activities required to fulfill human material needs to explain [[social phenomena]] within any given society.

It assumes that the form of economic organization, or [[mode of production]], influences all other social phenomena—including social relations, political institutions, legal systems, cultural systems, aesthetics, and ideologies. The economic system and these social relations form a [[base and superstructure]].

As [[forces of production]], i.e. [[technology]], improve, existing forms of social organization become obsolete and hinder further progress. As [[Karl Marx]] observed: "At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or—this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms—with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution".&lt;ref&gt;''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'' (1859). Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; These inefficiencies manifest themselves as social contradictions in society in the form of [[class struggle]].&lt;ref name="ComparingEconomic"&gt;''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'' (2003) by Gregory and Stuart. p. 62. ''Marx's Theory of Change''. {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], this struggle materializes between the minority (the [[bourgeoisie]]) who own the [[means of production]] and the vast majority of the population (the [[proletariat]]) who produce goods and services. Starting with the conjectural premise that [[social change]] occurs because of the struggle between different [[Social class|classes]] within society who are under contradiction against each other, a Marxist would conclude that [[capitalism]] exploits and oppresses the proletariat, therefore capitalism will inevitably lead to a [[proletarian revolution]].

[[Marxian economics]] and its proponents view capitalism as economically unsustainable and incapable of improving the living standards of the population due to its need to compensate for [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|falling rates of profit]] by cutting employee's wages, social benefits and pursuing military aggression. The [[Socialist mode of production|socialist system]] would succeed capitalism as humanity's mode of production through workers' [[revolution]]. According to Marxian [[crisis theory]], [[socialism]] is not an inevitability, but an economic necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Free will, non-predestination and non-determinism are emphasized in Marx's famous quote "Men make their own history". ''The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte'' (1852).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a socialist society, [[private property]]—in the form of the means of production—would be replaced by co-operative ownership. A socialist economy would not base production on the creation of private profits, but on the criteria of satisfying human needs—that is, [[Production for use|production would be carried out directly for use]]. As [[Friedrich Engels]] said: "Then the capitalist mode of appropriation in which the product enslaves first the producer, and then appropriator, is replaced by the mode of appropriation of the product that is based upon the nature of the modern means of production; upon the one hand, direct social appropriation, as means to the maintenance and extension of production on the other, direct individual appropriation, as means of subsistence and of enjoyment".&lt;ref&gt;''Socialism, Utopian and Scientific'' (1882). Chapter three.&lt;/ref&gt;

The materialist theory of history&lt;ref&gt;Evans, p. 53; Marx's account of the theory is the Preface to ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' (1859). [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/index.htm]. Another exposition of the theory is in ''The German Ideology''. It, too, is available online from [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology marxists.org].&lt;/ref&gt; analyses the underlying causes of societal development and change from the perspective of the collective ways that humans make their living. All constituent features of a society (social classes, political pyramid, ideologies) are assumed to stem from economic activity, an idea often portrayed with the metaphor of the [[base and superstructure]].

The base and superstructure metaphor describes the totality of social relations by which humans produce and re-produce their social existence. According to Marx: "The sum total of the forces of production accessible to men determines the condition of society" and forms a society's economic base. The base includes the material forces of production, that is the labour and material means of production and relations of production, i.e., the social and political arrangements that regulate production and distribution. From this base rises a superstructure of legal and political "forms of social consciousness" of political and legal institutions that derive from the economic base that conditions the superstructure and a society's dominant ideology. Conflicts between the development of material productive forces and the relations of production provokes social revolutions and thus the resultant changes to the economic base will lead to the transformation of the superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' (1859), [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm Preface], Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977, with some notes by R. Rojas and Engels: ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'' (1877), Introduction [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/introduction.htm General]
&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship is reflexive, as at first the base gives rise to the superstructure and remains the foundation of a form of social organization, hence that formed social organization can act again upon both parts of the base and superstructure so that the relationship is not static but a [[dialectic]], expressed and driven by conflicts and contradictions. As Engels clarified: "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes".&lt;ref&gt;''The Communist Manifesto'' (1847). Chapter one.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx considered class conflicts as the driving force of human history since these recurring conflicts have manifested themselves as distinct transitional stages of development in Western Europe. Accordingly, Marx designated human history as encompassing four stages of development in relations of production:&lt;ref&gt;Marx does not claim to have produced a master-key to history as historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the ''marche generale'', imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself". Letter to editor of the Russian newspaper paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'' (1877). He explains that his ideas are based upon a concrete study of the actual conditions in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Primitive communism]]: as in co-operative tribal societies.
# [[Slave]] society: a development of tribal to city-state; aristocracy is born.
# [[Feudalism]]: aristocrats are the ruling class; merchants evolve into capitalists.
# [[Capitalism]]: capitalists are the ruling class, who create and employ the proletariat.

=== Criticism of capitalism ===
{{further|Opposition to capitalism|Criticism of capitalism}}
According to the Marxist theoretician and [[revolutionary]] [[Vladimir Lenin]], "the principal content of Marxism" was "Marx's economic doctrine".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Len67|Lenin 1967 (1913)]]. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx believed that the capitalist bourgeois and their economists were promoting what he saw as the lie that "the interests of the capitalist and of the worker are&amp;nbsp;... one and the same", therefore he believed that they did this by purporting the concept that "the fastest possible growth of productive [[Capital (economics)|capital]]" was best not only for the wealthy capitalists but also for the workers because it provided them with employment.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mar49|Marx 1849]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploitation is a matter of [[surplus labour]]—the amount of labour one performs beyond what one receives in goods. Exploitation has been a socioeconomic feature of every class society and is one of the principal features distinguishing the social classes. The power of one social class to control the [[means of production]] enables its exploitation of the other classes.

In capitalism, the [[labor theory of value|labour theory of value]] is the operative concern; the [[Value (economics)|value]] of a [[Commodity (Marxism)|commodity]] equals the socially necessary labour time required to produce it. Under that condition, [[surplus value]] (the difference between the value produced and the value received by a labourer) is synonymous with the term "surplus labour", thus capitalist exploitation is realised as deriving surplus value from the worker.

In pre-capitalist economies, exploitation of the worker was achieved via physical coercion. In the capitalist mode of production, that result is more subtly achieved and because workers do not own the means of production, they must voluntarily enter into an exploitive work relationship with a capitalist in order to earn the necessities of life. The worker's entry into such employment is voluntary in that they choose which capitalist to work for. However, the worker must work or starve, thus exploitation is inevitable and the "voluntary" nature of a worker participating in a capitalist society is illusory.
&lt;!-- Production, not circulation. Marx emphasised that capitalism (''per se'') does not cheat the worker. --&gt;

[[Marx's theory of alienation|Alienation]] is the estrangement of people from their humanity (&lt;small&gt;German:&lt;/small&gt; ''Gattungswesen'', "species-essence", "species-being"), which is a systematic result of capitalism. Under capitalism, the fruits of production belong to the employers, who expropriate the surplus created by others and so generate alienated labourers.&lt;ref&gt;"Alienation" entry, ''A Dictionary of Sociology''&lt;/ref&gt; In Marx's view, alienation is an objective characterization of the worker's situation in capitalism—his or her self-awareness of this condition is not prerequisite.

=== Social classes ===
{{main|Marxian class theory}}
{{see also|Social class|Class conflict|Classless society|Three-component theory of stratification}}
Marx distinguishes social classes on the basis of two criteria: ownership of [[means of production]] and control over the [[labour power]] of others. Following this criterion of class based on property relations, Marx identified the [[social stratification]] of the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] with the following social groups:
* [[Proletariat]]: "[...] the class of modern wage labourers who, having no means of production of their own, are reduced to selling their [[labour power]] in order to live."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Engels|first1=Friedrich|authorlink1=Friedrich Engels|title=Manifesto of the Communist Party|date=1888|location=London|pages=Footnote|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm#a1|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capitalist mode of production establishes the conditions enabling the bourgeoisie to [[Exploitation (Marxism)|exploit]] the proletariat because the workers' labour generates a [[surplus value]] greater than the workers' [[wages]].
* [[Bourgeoisie]]: those who "own the means of production" and buy labour power from the proletariat, thus exploiting the proletariat. They subdivide as bourgeoisie and the petite bourgeoisie.
** [[Petite bourgeoisie]] are those who work and can afford to buy little labour power i.e. small business owners, peasant landlords, trade workers and the like. Marxism predicts that the continual reinvention of the means of production eventually would destroy the petite bourgeoisie, degrading them from the middle class to the proletariat.
* [[Lumpenproletariat]]: the outcasts of society such as the criminals, vagabonds, beggars, or prostitutes without any [[Political consciousness|political]] or [[class consciousness]]. Having no interest in international or national economics affairs, Marx claimed that this specific sub-division of the proletariat would play no part in the eventual social revolution.
* [[Landlords]]: a historically important social class who retain some wealth and power.
* [[Peasantry]] and [[farmers]]: a scattered class incapable of organizing and effecting socio-economic change, most of whom would enter the proletariat while some would become landlords.

[[Class consciousness]] denotes the awareness—of itself and the social world—that a social class possesses and its capacity to rationally act in their best interests, hence class consciousness is required before they can effect a successful revolution and thus the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].

Without defining [[Ideology#Ideology as an instrument of social reproduction|ideology]],&lt;ref&gt;Joseph McCarney: ''[http://marxmyths.org/joseph-mccarney/article.htm Ideology and False Consciousness]'', April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Marx used the term to describe the production of images of social reality. According to Engels, "ideology is a process accomplished by the so-called thinker consciously, it is true, but with a [[false consciousness]]. The real motive forces impelling him remain unknown to him; otherwise it simply would not be an ideological process. Hence he imagines false or seeming motive forces".&lt;ref&gt;Engels: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1893/letters/93_07_14.htm Letter] to [[Franz Mehring]], (London 14 July 1893), Donna Torr, translator, in ''Marx and Engels Correspondence'', International Publishers, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ruling class controls the society's means of production, the superstructure of society (the ruling social ideas), are determined by the best interests of the ruling class. In ''The German Ideology'', he says "[t]he ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e., the class which is the ruling material force of society, is, at the same time, its ruling intellectual force."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01b.htm|title=Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, ''The German Ideology''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[political economy]]" initially referred to the study of the material conditions of economic production in the capitalist system. In Marxism, political economy is the study of the means of production, specifically of capital and how that manifests as economic activity.

This new way of thinking was invented because socialists believed that common ownership of the "means of production" (that is the industries, the land, the wealth of nature, the trade apparatus, the wealth of the society, etc.) will abolish the exploitative working conditions experienced under capitalism. Through working class revolution, the state (which Marxists see as a weapon for the subjugation of one class by another) is seized and used to suppress the hitherto ruling class of capitalists and by implementing a commonly-owned, democratically controlled workplace create the society of communism, which Marxists see as true democracy. An economy based on co-operation on human need and social betterment, rather than competition for profit of many independently acting profit seekers, would also be the end of class society, which Marx saw as the fundamental division of all hitherto existing history.

Marx saw work, the effort by humans to transform the environment for their needs, as a fundamental feature of human kind. [[Capitalism]], in which the product of the worker's labor is taken from them and sold at market rather than being part of the worker's life, is therefore alienating to the worker. Additionally, the worker is compelled by various means (some nicer than others) to work harder, faster and for longer hours. While this is happening, the employer is constantly trying to save on labor costs: pay the workers less, figure out how to use cheaper equipment, etc. This allows the employer to extract the largest mount of work (and therefore potential wealth) from their workers. The fundamental nature of capitalist society is no different from that of slave society: one small group of society exploiting the larger group.

Through [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]], the [[profit motive]] is eliminated and the motive of furthering human flourishing is introduced. Because the surplus produced by the workers is property of the society as whole, there are no classes of producers and appropriators. Additionally, the state, which has its origins in the bands of retainers hired by the first ruling classes to protect their economic privilege, [[Withering away of the state|will disappear as its conditions of existence have disappeared]].&lt;ref name="Origins of the Family- Chapter IX"&gt;{{cite web|author=Frederick Engels|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/ch09.htm |title=Origins of the Family- Chapter IX|publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ZhaoDickson2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jianmin Zhao|author2=Bruce J.

== Revolution, socialism and communism ==
[[File:Madrid may day375.jpg|thumb|Leftist protester wielding a [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] with a [[raised fist]], both are symbols of revolutionary socialism.]]
According to [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxist theory]], the overthrow of capitalism by a [[Revolutionary socialism|socialist revolution]] in contemporary society is inevitable. While the inevitability of an eventual socialist revolution is a controversial debate among many different Marxist schools of thought, all Marxists believe socialism is a necessity, if not inevitable. Marxists believe that a socialist society is far better for the majority of the populace than its capitalist counterpart. Prior to the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian revolution]] of 1917, Lenin wrote: "The socialization of production is bound to lead to the conversion of the means of production into the property of society&amp;nbsp;... This conversion will directly result in an immense increase in productivity of labour, a reduction of working hours, and the replacement of the remnants, the ruins of small-scale, primitive, disunited production by collective and improved labour".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Len67|Lenin 1967 (1913)]]. p. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of the 1905 revolution and the failure of socialist movements to resist the outbreak of World War One led to renewed theoretical effort and valuable contributions from Lenin and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] towards an appreciation of Marx's [[crisis theory]] and efforts to formulate a theory of imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;Samezo Kuruma (September 1929).

== Classical Marxism ==
{{main|Classical Marxism}}
"Classical Marxism" denotes the collection of socio-eco-political theories expounded by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. "Marxism", as [[Ernest Mandel]] remarked, "is always open, always critical, always self-critical". As such, classical Marxism distinguishes between "Marxism" as broadly perceived and "what Marx believed", thus in 1883 Marx wrote to the French labour leader [[Jules Guesde]] and to Marx's son-in-law [[Paul Lafargue]]—both of whom claimed to represent Marxist principles—accusing them of "revolutionary phrase-mongering" and of denying the value of reformist struggle.

From Marx's letter derives the paraphrase:&lt;blockquote&gt;"If that is Marxism, then I am not a Marxist".&lt;ref&gt;"Accusing Guesde and Lafargue of 'revolutionary phrase-mongering' and of denying the value of reformist struggles, Marx made his famous remark that, if their politics represented Marxism, 'ce qu'il y a de certain c'est que moi, je ne suis pas Marxiste' ('what is certain is that I myself am not a Marxist')". See [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/05/parti-ouvrier.htm "Programme of the French Worker's Party"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hall|first=Stuart|author2=Dave Morely|author3=Kuan-Hsing Chen|title=Stuart Hall: Critical Dialogues in Cultural Studies|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-08803-9|page=418|accessdate=4 March 2013|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EPENAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA418|quote=I have no hesitation in saying that this represents a gigantic crudification and simplification of Marx's work – the kind of simplification and reductionism which once led him, in despair, to say "if that is marxism, then I am not a marxist"}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;American Marxist scholar [[Hal Draper]] responded to this comment by saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;"There are few thinkers in modern history whose thought has been so badly misrepresented, by Marxists and anti-Marxists alike".&lt;ref&gt;Not found in search function at [http://www.marxists.org/archive/draper/index.htm Draper Arkiv].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;On the other hand, the book ''Communism: The Great Misunderstanding'' argues that the source of such misrepresentations lies in ignoring the philosophy of Marxism, which is dialectical materialism. In large, this was due to the fact that ''[[The German Ideology]]'', in which Marx and Engels developed this philosophy, did not find a publisher for almost one hundred years.

[[File:Gordon Childe.jpg|thumb|One of the 20th century's most prominent Marxist academics, the Australian archaeologist [[V. Gordon Childe]]]]
Marxism has been adopted by a large number of academics and other scholars working in various disciplines.

The [[Archaeological theory|theoretical development]] of [[Marxist archaeology]] was first developed in the Soviet Union in 1929, when a young archaeologist named Vladislav I. Ravdonikas (1894–1976) published a report entitled "For a Soviet history of material culture". Within this work, the very discipline of archaeology as it then stood was criticised as being inherently bourgeois, therefore anti-socialist and so, as a part of the academic reforms instituted in the Soviet Union under the administration of Premier [[Joseph Stalin]], a great emphasis was placed on the adoption of Marxist archaeology throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tri07|Trigger 2007]]. pp. 326–40.&lt;/ref&gt; These theoretical developments were subsequently adopted by archaeologists working in capitalist states outside of the Leninist bloc, most notably by the Australian academic [[V. Gordon Childe]] (1892–1957), who used Marxist theory in his understandings of the development of human society.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre81|Green 1981]]. p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marxist sociology]] is the study of [[sociology]] from a Marxist perspective.&lt;ref name="black"&gt;Allan G. Johnson, ''The Blackwell dictionary of sociology: a user's guide to sociological language'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2000, {{ISBN|0-631-21681-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V1kiW7x6J1MC&amp;pg=PA183 p. 183-84 (Google Books)].&lt;/ref&gt; Marxist sociology is "a form of [[conflict theory]] associated with&amp;nbsp;... Marxism's objective of developing a [[Positivism (sociology)|positive]] ([[empirical]]) science of [[capitalist]] [[society]] as part of the mobilization of a revolutionary [[working class]]".&lt;ref name="encofsoc"&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/research/marxist-sociology-eos-03/ "Marxist Sociology"], ''Encyclopedia of Sociology'', Macmillan Reference, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Sociological Association]] has a section dedicated to the issues of Marxist sociology that is "interested in examining how insights from Marxist [[methodology]] and Marxist analysis can help explain the complex dynamics of modern society".&lt;ref name="section"&gt;[http://www2.asanet.org/sectionmarxist/about.html About the Section on Marxist Sociology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109001255/http://www2.asanet.org/sectionmarxist/about.html |date=2009-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the thought of [[Karl Marx]], Marxist sociology emerged during the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. As well as Marx, [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]] are considered seminal influences in [[History of sociology|early sociology]]. The first Marxist school of sociology was known as [[Austro-Marxism]], of which [[Carl Grünberg]] and [[Antonio Labriola]] were among its most notable members. During the 1940s, the [[Western Marxist]] school became accepted within Western academia, subsequently fracturing into several different perspectives such as the [[Frankfurt School]] or [[critical theory]]. Due to its former state-supported position, there has been a backlash against Marxist thought in [[post-communist]] states (see [[sociology in Poland]]) but it remains dominant in the sociological research sanctioned and supported by those communist states that remain (see [[sociology in China]]).

[[Marxian economics]] refers to a school of economic thought tracing its foundations to the critique of classical [[political economy]] first expounded upon by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolff and Resnick|first=Richard and Stephen|title=Economics: Marxian versus Neoclassical|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|date=August 1987|isbn=978-0801834806|page=130|quote=Marxian theory (singular) gave way to Marxian theories (plural).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marxian economics concerns itself with the analysis of [[Crisis theory|crisis]] in [[capitalism]], the role and distribution of the [[surplus product]] and [[surplus value]] in various types of [[economic system]]s, the nature and origin of [[Value (economics)|economic value]], the impact of class and class struggle on economic and political processes, and the process of [[Evolutionary economics|economic evolution]]. Although the Marxian school is considered [[heterodox economics|heterodox]], ideas that have come out of Marxian economics have contributed to mainstream understanding of the global economy. Certain concepts of Marxian economics, especially those related to [[capital accumulation]] and the [[business cycle]], such as [[creative destruction]], have been fitted for use in capitalist systems.

[[Marxist historiography]] is a school of [[historiography]] influenced by Marxism.  The chief tenets of Marxist historiography are the centrality of [[social class]] and [[economic]] constraints in determining historical outcomes. Marxist historiography has made contributions to the history of the [[working class]], oppressed nationalities, and the [[methodology]] of [[People's history|history from below]]. [[Friedrich Engels]]' most important historical contribution was ''Der deutsche Bauernkrieg'' (''The [[German Peasants' War]]''), which analysed social warfare in early Protestant Germany in terms of emerging capitalist classes. ''The German Peasants' War'' indicate the Marxist interest in [[People's history|history from below]] and class analysis, and attempts a dialectical analysis. Engels' short treatise ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' (1870s) was salient in creating the [[socialist]] impetus in British politics. Marx's most important works on social and political history include ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'', ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', ''[[The German Ideology]]'', and those chapters of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' dealing with the historical emergence of [[Capitalism|capitalists]] and [[Proletariat|proletarians]] from [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial]] English society. Marxist historiography suffered in the [[Soviet Union]], as the government requested overdetermined historical writing. Notable histories include the ''Short Course History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ([[Bolshevik]])'', published in the 1930s to justify the nature of Bolshevik party life under [[Joseph Stalin]]. A circle of historians inside the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) formed in 1946. While some members of the group (most notably [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] and [[E. P. Thompson]]) left the CPGB after the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. Thompson's ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'' is one of the works commonly associated with this group. [[Eric Hobsbawm]]'s ''Bandits'' is another example of this group's work. [[C. L. R. James]] was also a great pioneer of the 'history from below' approach. Living in Britain when he wrote his most notable work ''[[The Black Jacobins]]'' (1938), he was an [[Anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]] Marxist and so outside of the CPGB. In India, B. N. Datta and [[Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi|D. D. Kosambi]] are considered the founding fathers of  Marxist historiography. Today, the senior-most scholars of Marxist historiography are [[Ram Sharan Sharma|R. S. Sharma]], [[Irfan Habib]], [[Romila Thapar]], [[D. N. Jha]] and [[K. N. Panikkar]], most of whom are now over 75 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Bottomore, T. B. 1983. A Dictionary of Marxist thought. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marxist literary criticism]] is a loose term describing [[literary criticism]] based on socialist and dialectic theories. Marxist criticism views literary works as reflections of the social institutions from which they originate. According to Marxists, even literature itself is a social institution and has a specific ideological function, based on the background and ideology of the author. Notable marxist literary critics include [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Terry Eagleton]] and [[Fredric Jameson]]. [[Marxist aesthetics]] is a theory of [[aesthetics]] based on, or derived from, the theories of [[Karl Marx]]. It involves a [[dialectical]] and [[materialist]], or [[dialectical materialist]], approach to the application of Marxism to the cultural sphere, specifically areas related to taste such as art, beauty, etc. Marxists believe that economic and social conditions, and especially the class relations that derive from them, affect every aspect of an individual's life, from religious beliefs to legal systems to cultural frameworks. Some notable Marxist aestheticians include [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], [[Mikhail Lifshitz]], [[William Morris]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Georg Lukács]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Jacques Rancière]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Raymond Williams]].

According to a 2007 survey of American professors by [[Neil Gross]] and Solon Simmons, 17.6% of social science professors and 5.0% of humanities professors identify as Marxists, while between 0 and 2% of professors in all other disciplines identify as Marxists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gross |first1=Neil |last2=Simmons |first2=Solon |title=The Social and Political Views of American Professors |date=2007 |citeseerx=10.1.1.147.6141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels ===
{{main|Karl Marx|Friedrich Engels}}
[[File:Engels.jpg|thumb|[[Friedrich Engels]]]]
Karl Marx (5 May 1818 – 14 March 1883) was a [[German philosopher]], political economist and socialist revolutionary who addressed the matters of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of the working class, the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] and historical materialism. He is famous for analysing history in terms of class struggle, summarised in the initial line introducing ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848): "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles".&lt;ref&gt;''The Communist Manifesto (1847). Chapter one.&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich Engels (28 November 1820 – 5 August 1895) was a German [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]] who together with Marx co-developed communist theory. Marx and Engels first met in September 1844. Discovering that they had similar views of philosophy and socialism, they collaborated and wrote works such as ''Die heilige Familie'' (''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]''). After Marx was deported from France in January 1845, they moved to Belgium, which then permitted greater [[freedom of expression]] than other European countries. In January 1846, they returned to Brussels to establish the Communist Correspondence Committee.

In 1847, they began writing ''The Communist Manifesto'' (1848), based on Engels' ''The Principles of Communism''. Six weeks later, they published the 12,000-word pamphlet in February 1848. In March, Belgium expelled them and they moved to [[Cologne]], where they published the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]'', a politically [[Political radicalism|radical]] newspaper. By 1849, they had to leave Cologne for London. The Prussian authorities pressured the British government to expel Marx and Engels, but Prime Minister [[Lord John Russell]] refused.

After Marx's death in 1883, Engels became the editor and translator of Marx's writings. With his ''[[Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State]]'' (1884)&amp;nbsp;– analysing [[Monogamy|monogamous]] [[marriage]] as guaranteeing male social domination of women, a concept analogous, in communist theory, to the capitalist class's economic domination of the working class—Engels made [[intellectual]]ly significant contributions to [[feminist theory]] and [[Marxist feminism]].

=== Late 20th century===
[[File:Fidel Castro - UN General Assembly 1960.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fidel Castro]] at the UN General Assembly, 1960]]
In 1959, the [[Cuban Revolution]] led to the victory of [[Fidel Castro]] and his [[July 26 Movement]]. Although the revolution was not explicitly [[socialist]], upon victory Castro ascended to the position of Prime Minister and adopted the [[Leninist]] model of socialist development, forging an alliance with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Col03|Coltman 2003]] and [[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]].&lt;/ref&gt; One of the leaders of the revolution, the Argentine Marxist revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] (1928–1967), subsequently went on to aid revolutionary socialist movements in [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo-Kinshasa]] and Bolivia, eventually being killed by the Bolivian government, possibly on the orders of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), though the CIA agent sent to search for Guevara, Felix Rodriguez, expressed a desire to keep him alive as a possible bargaining tool with the Cuban government. He would posthumously go on to become an internationally recognised icon.

In the People's Republic of China, the [[Maoist]] government undertook the [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 through to 1976 to ameliorate capitalist elements of Chinese society and achieve socialism. However, upon [[Mao Zedong]]'s death, his rivals seized political power and under the Premiership of [[Deng Xiaoping]] (1978–1992), many of Mao's Cultural Revolution era policies were revised or abandoned and much of the state sector privatised.

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the collapse of most of those socialist states that had professed a [[Marxist–Leninist]] ideology. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the emergence of the [[New Right]] and [[neoliberal]] capitalism as the dominant ideological trends in western politics—championed by U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and U.K. Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]—led the west to take a more aggressive stand against the Soviet Union and its Leninist allies. Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union the reformist [[Mikhael Gorbachev]] became Premier in March 1985 and sought to abandon Leninist models of development towards [[social democracy]]. Ultimately, Gorbachev's reforms, coupled with rising levels of popular [[ethnic nationalism]] in the Soviet Union, led to the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|state's dissolution]] in late 1991 into a series of constituent nations, all of which abandoned Marxist–Leninist models for socialism, with most converting to capitalist economies.

[[File:VISITA DE ESTADO - XI JINPING (30930224182).jpg|thumb|right|[[Xi Jinping]] in 2016]]
At the turn of the 21st century, China, Cuba, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam remained the only officially Marxist–Leninist states remaining, although a Maoist government led by [[Prachanda]] was elected into power in Nepal in 2008 following a long guerrilla struggle.

The early 21st century also saw the election of socialist governments in several Latin American nations, in what has come to be known as the "[[pink tide]]". Dominated by the Venezuelan government of [[Hugo Chávez]], this trend also saw the election of [[Evo Morales]] in Bolivia, [[Rafael Correa]] in Ecuador and [[Daniel Ortega]] in Nicaragua. Forging political and economic alliances through international organisations like the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]], these socialist governments allied themselves with Marxist–Leninist Cuba and although none of them espoused a Leninist path directly, most admitted to being significantly influenced by Marxist theory.

For Italian Marxist Gianni Vattimo in his 2011 book ''[[Hermeneutic Communism]]'', "this new weak communism differs substantially from its previous Soviet (and current Chinese) realization, because the South American countries follow democratic electoral procedures and also manage to decentralize the state bureaucratic system through the [[Bolivarian missions]]. In sum, if weakened communism is felt as a specter in the West, it is not only because of media distortions but also for the alternative it represents through the same democratic procedures that the West constantly professes to cherish but is hesitant to apply".&lt;ref&gt;Gianni Vattimo and Santiago Zabala. ''Hermeneutic Communism: From Heidegger to Marx'' Columbia University Press. 2011. p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chinese President]] [[Xi Jinping]] has announced a deepening commitment of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] to the ideas of Marx. At an event celebrating the 200th anniversary of Marx's birth, Xi said “We must win the advantages, win the initiative, and win the future. We must continuously improve the ability to use Marxism to analyse and solve practical problems...” also adding “powerful ideological weapon for us to understand the world, grasp the law, seek the truth, and change the world,”. Xi has further stressed the importance of examining and continuing the tradition of the [[Communist Party of China|CPC]] and embrace its revolutionary past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-marx-china/no-regrets-xi-says-marxism-still-totally-correct-for-china-idUSKBN1I50ET|title=No regrets: Xi says Marxism still 'totally correct' for China|first=Christian|last=Shepherd|publisher=|newspaper=Reuters|date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/17/asia/xi-jinping-marxism-china-intl/index.html|title=At the height of his power, China's Xi Jinping moves to embrace Marxism|first=Steven Jiang|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1270109/chinas-communist-party-and-xi-jinping-are-celebrating-the-200th-birthday-of-karl-marx-with-a-vengeance/|title=China's huge celebrations of Karl Marx are not really about Marxism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticisms of Marxism have come from various political ideologies and academic disciplines. These include general criticisms about lack of internal consistency, criticisms related to historical materialism, that it is a type of historical determinism, the necessity of suppression of individual rights, issues with the implementation of communism and economic issues such as the distortion or absence of price signals and reduced incentives. In addition, empirical and epistemological problems are frequently identified.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Howard and J. E. King, 1992, ''A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=popper&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Karl|title =Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=978-0-415-28594-0|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Maynard Keynes. Essays in Persuasion. W. W. Norton &amp; Company. 1991. p. 300 {{ISBN|978-0-393-00190-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Marxists have criticised the academic [[institution]]alisation of Marxism for being too shallow and detached from political action. For instance, Zimbabwean [[Trotskyist]] [[Alex Callinicos]], himself a professional academic, stated: "Its practitioners remind one of [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]], who in the Greek legend fell in love with his own reflection&amp;nbsp;... Sometimes it is necessary to devote time to clarifying and developing the concepts that we use, but indeed for Western Marxists this has become an end in itself. The result is a body of writings incomprehensible to all but a tiny minority of highly qualified scholars".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cal10|Callinicos 2010]]. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there are intellectual critiques of Marxism that contest certain assumptions prevalent in Marx's thought and Marxism after him, without exactly rejecting Marxist politics.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{cite book|last=Baudrillard|first=Jean|date=1973|title=The Mirror of Production}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other contemporary supporters of Marxism argue that many aspects of Marxist thought are viable, but that the corpus is incomplete or outdated in regards to certain aspects of economic, political or [[social theory]]. They may therefore combine some Marxist concepts with the ideas of other theorists such as [[Max Weber]]—the [[Frankfurt School]] is one example.&lt;ref&gt;Held, David (1980), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=Fredric|editor1-last=Nealon|editor1-first=Jeffrey|editor2-last=Irr|editor2-first=Caren|title=Rethinking the Frankfurt School: Alternative Legacies of Cultural Critique|date=2002|publisher=SUNY Press|location=Albany|pages=11–30|chapter=The Theoretical Hesitation: Benjamin's Sociological Predecessor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General criticisms ===
Philosopher and historian of ideas [[Leszek Kołakowski]] pointed out that "Marx's theory is incomplete or ambiguous in many places, and could be 'applied' in many contradictory ways without manifestly infringing its principles". Specifically, he considers "the laws of dialectics" as fundamentally erroneous, stating that some are "truisms with no specific Marxist content", others "philosophical dogmas that cannot be proved by scientific means" and some just "nonsense". He believes that some Marxist laws can be interpreted differently, but that these interpretations still in general fall into one of the two categories of error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Main Currents of Marxism|last=Kołakowski|first=Leszek|publisher=W. W. Norton and Company|year=2005|isbn=9780393329438|location=New York|pages=662, 909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Okishio's theorem]] shows that if capitalists use cost-cutting techniques and real wages do not increase, the rate of profit must rise, which casts doubt on Marx's view that the rate of profit would tend to fall.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Howard and J. E. King. (1992) A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990, chapter 7, sects. II–IV. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The allegations of inconsistency have been a large part of Marxian economics and the debates around it since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;See M. C. Howard and J. E. King, 1992, ''A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Kliman argues that this undermines Marx's critiques and the correction of the alleged inconsistencies, because internally inconsistent theories cannot be right by definition.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kliman states that "Marx’s value theory would be ''necessarily wrong'' if it were internally inconsistent. Internally inconsistent theories may be appealing, intuitively plausible and even obvious, and consistent with all available empirical evidence––but they cannot be right. It is necessary to reject them or correct them. Thus the alleged proofs of inconsistency trump all other considerations, disqualifying Marx’s theory at the starting gate. By doing so, they provide the principal justification for the suppression of this theory as well as the suppression of, and the denial of resources needed to carry out, present-day research based upon it. This greatly inhibits its further development. So does the very charge of inconsistency. What person of intellectual integrity would want to join a research program founded on (what he believes to be) a theory that is internally inconsistent and therefore false?" (Andrew Kliman, ''Reclaiming Marx's "Capital": A Refutation of the Myth of Inconsistency,'' Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2007, p. 3, emphasis in original). However, in his book, Kliman presents an interpretation where these inconsistencies can be eliminated. The connection between the inconsistency allegations and the lack of study of Marx’s theories was argued further by [[John Cassidy (journalist)|John Cassidy]] ("The Return of Karl Marx," ''The New Yorker'', Oct. 20 &amp; 27, 1997, p. 252): "His mathematical model of the economy, which depended on the idea that labor is the source of all value, was riven with internal inconsistencies and is rarely studied these days."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epistemological and empirical critiques ===
Marx's predictions have been criticized because they have allegedly failed, with some pointing towards the GDP per capita increasing generally in capitalist economies compared to less market oriented economics, the capitalist economies not suffering worsening economic crises leading to the overthrow of the capitalist system and communist revolutions not occurring in the most advanced capitalist nations, but instead in undeveloped regions.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Kliman, ''Reclaiming Marx's "Capital"'', Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, p. 208, emphases in original.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.ZG|title=GDP per capita growth (annual %)|date=2016|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his books ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' and ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]'', [[philosopher of science]] [[Karl Popper]], criticized the [[explanatory power]] and [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of historical materialism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org|title=Science as Falsification|last=Popper|first=Sir Karl|date=1963|website=stephenjaygould.org.|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper believed that Marxism had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a genuinely predictive theory. When these predictions were not in fact borne out, Popper argues that the theory avoided [[Falsifiability|falsification]] by the addition of ad hoc hypotheses that made it compatible with the facts. Because of this, Popper asserted, a theory that was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into [[pseudoscientific]] dogma.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge|last=Popper|first=Sir Karl|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=978-0-415-28594-0|pages=449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socialist critiques ===
[[Democratic socialist]]s and social democrats reject the idea that socialism can be accomplished only through extra-legal class conflict and a proletarian revolution. The relationship between Marx and other socialist thinkers and organizations—rooted in Marxism's "scientific" and anti-utopian socialism, among other factors—has divided Marxists from other socialists since Marx's life.

After Marx's death and with the emergence of Marxism, there have also been dissensions within Marxism itself—a notable example is the splitting of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] into [[Bolsheviks]] and [[Mensheviks]]. [[Orthodox Marxist]]s became opposed to a less dogmatic, more innovative, or even [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] Marxism.

=== Anarchist and libertarian critiques ===
{{main|Libertarian socialism|Libertarian Marxism}}
[[Anarchism]] has had a strained relationship with Marxism since Marx's life. Anarchists and many non-Marxist libertarian socialists reject the need for a [[Dictatorship of the proletariat|transitory state phase]], claiming that socialism can only be established through decentralized, non-coercive organization. Anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] criticized Marx for his authoritarian bent.&lt;ref name=Bakunin1872&gt;{{citation|last=Bakunin|first=Mikhail|authorlink=Mikhail Bakunin|title=Letter to ''La Liberté'', quoted in ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971|date=5 October 1872|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/la-liberte.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrases "barracks socialism" or "[[barracks communism]]" became a shorthand for this critique, evoking the image of citizens' lives being as regimented as the lives of [[conscript]]s in a [[barracks]].&lt;ref name="Sperber_2013"&gt;{{citation|last=Sperber|first=Jonathan|year=2013|title=Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBpSh9JYAKcC|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co|postscript=.|isbn=9780871403544}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noam Chomsky]] is critical of Marxism's dogmatic strains and the idea of Marxism itself, but still appreciates Marx's contributions to political thought. Unlike some anarchists, Chomsky does not consider Bolshevism "Marxism in practice", but he does recognize that Marx was a complicated figure who had conflicting ideas, while he also acknowledges the latent authoritarianism in Marx he also points to the libertarian strains that developed into the [[council communism]] of [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Anton Pannekoek]]. However, his commitment to libertarian socialism has led him to characterize himself as an anarchist with radical Marxist leanings (see [[political positions of Noam Chomsky]]).

Libertarian Marxism refers to a broad scope of economic and political philosophies that emphasize the [[anti-authoritarian]] aspects of Marxism. Early currents of libertarian Marxism, known as [[left communism]], emerged in opposition to [[Marxism–Leninism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Herman Gorter]], [[Anton Pannekoek]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]], Otto Ruhl ''Non-Leninist Marxism: Writings on the Workers Councils''. Red and Black, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and its derivatives such as [[Stalinism]], [[Ceaușism]] and [[Maoism]]. Libertarian Marxism is also often critical of [[reformist]] positions, such as those held by [[social democrats]]. Libertarian Marxist currents often draw from Marx and Engels' later works, specifically the ''[[Grundrisse]]'' and ''[[The Civil War in France]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Ernesto Screpanti, Libertarian communism: Marx Engels and the Political Economy of Freedom, Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizing the Marxist belief in the ability of the [[working class]] to forge its own destiny without the need for a revolutionary party or [[State (polity)|state]] to mediate or aid its liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Draper, Hal. [https://jps.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/srv/article/view/5333"The Principle of Self-Emancipation in Marx and Engels"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723070247/https://jps.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/srv/article/view/5333|date=23 July 2011}} ''Socialist Register''. Vol 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with anarchism, libertarian Marxism is one of the main currents of [[libertarian socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. [http://chomsky.info/audionvideo/19700216.mp3 "Government In The Future"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121062818/http://chomsky.info/audionvideo/19700216.mp3|date=21 November 2010}} Poetry Center of the New York YM-YWHA. Lecture.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic critiques ===
Other critiques come from an economic standpoint. [[Vladimir Karpovich Dmitriev]] writing in 1898,&lt;ref&gt;V. K. Dmitriev, 1974 (1898), ''Economic Essays on Value, Competition and Utility''. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ladislaus Bortkiewicz|Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz]] writing in 1906–1907&lt;ref&gt;Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz, 1952 (1906–1907), "Value and Price in the Marxian System", ''International Economic Papers'' 2, 5–60; Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz, 1984 (1907), "On the Correction of Marx's Fundamental Theoretical Construction in the Third Volume of ''Capital''". In Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk 1984 (1896), ''Karl Marx and the Close of his System'', Philadelphia: Orion Editions.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent critics have alleged that Marx's [[value theory]] and law of the [[tendency of the rate of profit to fall]] are internally inconsistent. In other words, the critics allege that Marx drew conclusions that actually do not follow from his theoretical premises. Once these alleged errors are corrected, his conclusion that aggregate price and profit are determined by and equal to aggregate value and surplus value no longer holds true. This result calls into question his theory that the exploitation of workers is the sole source of profit.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Howard and J. E. King. (1992) A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990, chapter 12, sect. III. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Marxism and socialism have received considerable critical analysis from multiple generations of [[Austrian School|Austrian economists]] in terms of scientific methodology, economic theory and political implications.&lt;ref&gt;Sennholz, Hans F. [https://mises.org/daily/3910/What-We-Can-Know-About-the-World "What We Can Know About The World"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Mises, Ludwig. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Omnipotent_Government.html?id=QoOMaqfdpT4C "Omnipotent Government"].&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Marginal utility#The Marginal Revolution|marginal revolution]], subjective value theory was rediscovered by [[Carl Menger]], a development that fundamentally undermined the British cost theories of value. The restoration of subjectivism and [[praxeological]] methodology previously used by classical economists including [[Richard Cantillon]], [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot]], [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] and [[Frédéric Bastiat]] led Menger to criticise [[historicist]] methodology in general. Second-generation Austrian economist [[Eugen Böhm von Bawerk]] used praxeological and subjectivist methodology to attack the law of value fundamentally. Non-Marxist economists have regarded his criticism as definitive, with [[Gottfried Haberler]] arguing that Böhm-Bawerk's critique of Marx's economics was so thorough and devastating that as of the 1960s no Marxian scholar had conclusively refuted it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gottfried Haberler]] in [[Milorad M. Drachkovitch]] (ed.), ''Marxist Ideology in the Contemporary World – Its Appeals and Paradoxes'' (New York: Praeger, 1966), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Third-generation Austrian [[Ludwig von Mises]] rekindled debate about the [[economic calculation problem]] by identifying that without price signals in capital goods, all other aspects of the market economy are irrational. This led him to declare that "rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist [[commonwealth]]".&lt;ref name="Mises"&gt;{{cite book|title=Economic calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth|accessdate=9 August 2008|last=Von Mises|first=Ludwig|authorlink=Ludwig von Mises|date=1990|format=PDF|publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]|url=https://mises.org/pdf/econcalc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daron Acemoglu]] and [[James A. Robinson (economist)|James A. Robinson]] argue that Marx's economic theory was fundamentally flawed because it attempted to simplify the economy into a few general laws that ignored the impact of institutions on the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Acemoglu |first1=Daron |last2=Robinson |first2=James A. |title=The Rise and Decline of General Laws of Capitalism |journal=NBER Working Paper Series |date=December 2014 |url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w20766.pdf |accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14052">In contemporary art, '''monumental sculpture''' is large sculpture regardless of purpose, carrying a sense of permanent, solid, objects, rather than the temporary or fragile assemblages used in much contemporary sculpture. In ancient and medieval sculpture, size is normally taken as the criterion for definition, although smaller architectural sculptures may also be labelled monumental sculpture. In the [[Early Modern period]] a specific funerary function may be attributed to monumental sculpture.

Historically monumental sculpture (using the size criterion) in a culture, is regarded as of great significance. A culture may cease to produce monumental sculpture due to [[societal collapse]] or [[aniconism]], usually religiously motivated.[[File:Moissac Abbaye portail sud.jpg|thumb|[[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] portal of [[Moissac]] Abbey; a classic example of what is meant by "monumental sculpture" in ancient and medieval art history.]]
[[File:Venezia - Chiesa dei SS. Giovanni e Paolo (S. Zanipolo) - Foto G. Dall'Orto 2 lug 2006 - 08.jpg|thumb|Medieval and Renaissance wall tombs in [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice]]. In discussing the [[Early Modern period]], the term may mean specifically sculptures that are [[memorial]]s.]]

==Defining ''monumental''==
The term ''monumental sculpture'' is often used in [[art history]] and [[Art criticism|criticism]], but not always consistently. It combines two concepts, one of function, and one of size, and may include an element of a third more subjective concept. It is often used for all sculptures that are large. Human figures that are perhaps half life-size or above would usually be considered monumental in this sense by art historians,&lt;ref&gt;For example, none of the figures in sculptures at the [[Santo Domingo de Silos Abbey]] are larger than this, and they are described by [[Meyer Schapiro]] as "one of the largest groups of monumental carving in Spanish [[Romanesque art]]". Schapiro, 29&lt;/ref&gt; although in [[contemporary art]] a rather larger overall scale is implied.  Monumental sculpture is therefore distinguished from small portable [[figurine]]s, small metal or [[ivory]] [[relief]]s, [[diptych]]s and the like.

It is also used of sculpture that is architectural in function, especially if used to create or form part of a [[monument]] of some sort, and therefore capitals and reliefs attached to buildings will be included, even if small in size. Typical functions of monuments are as grave markers, [[tomb monument]]s or [[memorial]]s, and expressions of the power of a ruler or community, to which churches and so religious statues are added by convention, although in some contexts monumental sculpture may specifically mean just [[funerary art|funerary]] sculpture for [[church architecture|church monuments]].  A related idea is that of permanence, emphasized in some discussions of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Gilibert, 2-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The third concept that may be involved when the term is used is not specific to sculpture, as the other two essentially are.  The entry for "Monumental" in "A Dictionary of Art and Artists" by [[Peter Murray (art historian)|Peter and Linda Murray]] describes it as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Monumental|title=A Dictionary of Art and Artists|edition=Revised|publisher=Penguin|year=1968|author=Peter and Linda Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The most overworked word in current art history and criticism.  It is intended to convey the idea that a particular work of art, or part of such a work, is grand, noble, elevated in idea, simple in conception and execution, without any excess of virtuousity, and having something of the enduring, stable, and timeless nature of great architecture. ... It is not a synonym for 'large'.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

However, this does not constitute an accurate or adequate description of the use of the term for sculpture, though many uses of the term that essentially mean either large or "used in a memorial" may involve this concept also, in ways that are hard to separate.  For example, when [[Meyer Schapiro]], after a chapter analysing the carved capitals at [[Moissac]], says: "in the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] of the south portal [''(right)''] the sculpture of Moissac becomes truly monumental.  It is placed above the level of the eye, and is so large as to dominate the entire entrance.  It is a gigantic semi-circular relief ...",&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro, 201&lt;/ref&gt; size is certainly the dominant part of what he means by the word, and Schapiro's further comments suggest that a lack of "excess of virtuousity" does not form part of what he intends to convey.  Nonetheless, parts of the Murray's concept ("grand, noble, elevated in idea") are included in his meaning, although "simple in conception and execution" hardly seems to apply.

==Meaning in different contexts==
The term 'Monumental Sculptures' has acquired various meanings over the years, but these different meanings have not caused much difficulty in classification, as the various interpretations incorporate the changing nature of sculptures through temporal and spacial landscapes in this category.&lt;ref&gt;The Getty [http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=monumental&amp;logic=AND&amp;note=&amp;english=N&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=300073760 Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus Online] definition only refers to "Very large, comparable to a typical monument in massiveness", but the notes below on the many reference works consulted give a range of different emphases on size and function.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term may be used differently for different periods in history, with breaks occurring around the [[Renaissance]] and the early 20th century. The ancient and medieval sculpture size is normally taken as the criterion for definition, although smaller architectural sculptures can also be addressed by the term. In the [[Early Modern period]] a specific funerary function may have been meant, but the meaning of size was once again adopted while referring to contemporary sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;For examples, concerned with funerary sculpture only are:''The Silent Rhetoric of the Body A History of Monumental Sculpture and Commemorative Art in England, 1720–1770'', by Matthew Craske, Yale UP, {{ISBN|0-300-13541-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-300-13541-1}} [http://www.yalebooks.co.uk/yale/display.asp?K=9780300135411&amp;bic=AFKB&amp;sort=SORT_DATE/d&amp;ds=Sculpture&amp;m=9&amp;dc=44]{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, and several of the titles covered on the [http://www.churchmonumentssociety.org/newfile30.htm bibliography page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101112536/http://www.churchmonumentssociety.org/newfile30.htm |date=2009-01-01 }} of the website of the Church Monuments Society.

==In art history==

===Appearance of monumental sculpture in a culture===
In [[archeology]] and art history the appearance, and sometimes disappearance, of monumental sculpture (using the size criterion) in a culture, is regarded as of great significance, though tracing the emergence is often complicated by the presumed existence of sculpture in wood and other perishable materials of which no record remains;&lt;ref&gt;See for example Martin Robertson, ''A shorter history of Greek art'', p. 9, Cambridge University Press, 1981, {{ISBN|0-521-28084-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-28084-6}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=BoUsvD1_VNQC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22monumental+sculpture%22&amp;ei=iiL3SbqpFZS6M8Hm0eQD Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[totem pole]] is an example of a tradition of monumental sculpture in wood that would leave no traces for archaeology.  The ability to summon the resources to create monumental sculpture, by transporting usually very heavy materials and arranging for the payment of what are usually regarded as full-time sculptors, is considered a mark of a relatively advanced culture in terms of social organization.
[[File:Nim Li Punit stela.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Maya stela]]]]

In [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] probably dates to the 3rd millennium BC and may be older than the [[Pyramids of Egypt]].  Recent unexpected discoveries of Ancient Chinese [[bronze age]] figures at [[Sanxingdui]], some more than twice human size, have disturbed many ideas held about early Chinese civilization, since only much smaller bronzes were previously known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/education/chinatp_san.shtm NGA, Washington] feature on exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some undoubtedly advanced cultures, such as the [[Indus Valley civilization]], appear to have had no monumental sculpture at all, though producing very sophisticated figurines and seals.  The [[Mississippian culture]] seems to have progressing towards its use, with small stone figures, when it collapsed.  Other cultures, such as Ancient Egypt and the [[History of Easter Island|Easter Island culture]], seem to have devoted enormous resources to very large-scale monumental sculpture from a very early stage&lt;ref&gt;Bruce G. Trigger, "Monumental Architecture: A Thermodynamic Explanation of Symbolic Behaviour Author", World Archaeology, vo.22, no.2, 1990, pp.119-132. &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Disappearance of monumental sculpture===
There may be a number of reasons why a culture ceases to produce monumental sculpture. The most common is [[societal collapse]], as occurred in Europe during the so-called [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] or the [[Classic Maya collapse]] in [[Mesoamerica]].  Another may be [[aniconism]], usually religiously motivated, as followed the [[Muslim conquests]].  Both the rise of Christianity (initially) and later the [[Protestant Reformation]] brought a halt to religious monumental sculpture in the regions concerned, and greatly reduced production of any monumental sculpture for several centuries.&lt;ref&gt; Post, Chandler Rathfon, A History of European and American Sculpture: From the Early Christian Period to the Present Day, Volume l, Harvard University Press, London, 1921 p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; [[Byzantine art]], which had largely avoided the societal collapse in the [[Western Roman Empire]], never resumed the use of monumental figurative sculpture, whether in religious or secular contexts, and was to ban even two-dimensional religious art for a period in the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]].

==Contemporary work==
Monumental sculpture is still used within the stoneworking and funeral trades to cover all forms of grave headstones and other funerary art, regardless of size.  In contemporary art, however, it is used to refer to all large sculptures regardless of purpose, and also carries a sense of permanent, solid, objects, rather than the temporary or fragile assemblages used in much contemporary sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, several uses of the term in [http://www.sculpture.org.uk/blog/monumentally-virtual-ephemerally-physical-directions-in-new-sculpture-and-new-media "Monumentally Virtual, Ephemerally Physical: Directions in new sculpture and new media"], blogpost by Joseph Taylor McRae, Lecturer in Computer Games Arts and editor of Art/Games Journal, published on May 25th, 2016, by the [[Cass Sculpture Foundation]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sculptures covered by the term in modern art are likely to be over two metres in at least one dimension, and sufficiently large not to need a high [[plinth]], though they may have one.  Many are still commissioned as [[public art]], often for placing at outdoor sites.

'''''Ordo Virtutum''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for ''Order of the Virtues'') is an [[allegory|allegorical]] [[morality play]], or [[liturgical drama]], by [[Hildegard of Bingen|St. Hildegard]], composed c. 1151, during the construction and relocation of her Abbey at Rupertsberg. It is the earliest morality play by more than a century, and the only [[Medieval]] musical drama to survive with an attribution for both the text and the music.

A short version of ''Ordo Virtutum'' without music appears at the end of ''[[Scivias]]'', Hildegard's most famous account of her visions. It is also included in some manuscripts of the ''Symphonia armoniae celestium revelationum'' ("Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations"), a cycle of more than 70 liturgical songs. It may have been performed by the convent nuns at the dedication of the St. [[Rupertsberg]] church in 1152&lt;ref&gt;Sabina Flanagan. ''Secrets of God: The Writings of Hildegard of Bingen''. Boston: Shambhala, 1996. Page 119.&lt;/ref&gt; or possibly before the Mass for the [[Consecrated virgin|Consecration of Virgins]] at the convent .&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Sheingorn.  "The Virtues of Hildegard’s Ordo Virtutum; or, It Was a Woman’s World".  ''The Ordo Virtutum of Hildegard of Bingen: Critical Studies''.  ed. Audrey Ekdahl Davidson.  Kalamazoo, Michigan: Medieval Institute Publications, 1992.  Page 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The subject of the play is typical for a musical drama. It shows no biblical events, no depiction of a saint's life, and no miracles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Potter|first=Robert|date=Fall 1986|title=The "Ordo Vitutum": Ancestor of the English Moralities?|jstor=41153244|journal=Comparative Drama|volume=20|pages=201–210|doi=10.1353/cdr.1986.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, ''Ordo Virtutum'' is about the struggle for a human soul, or Anima, between the Virtues and the Devil.  The idea that Hildegard is trying to develop in Ordo Virtutum is the reconnection between the "creator and creation"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://healthyhildegard.com/ordo-virtutum/.|title=Hildegard's Ordo Virtutum - HealthyHildegard.com|date=2016-10-22|work=HealthyHildegard.com|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The piece can be divided as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Audrey Ekdahl Davidson.  "Music and Performance: Hildegard of Bingen’s ''Ordo Virtutum''".   ''The Ordo Virtutum of Hildegard of Bingen: Critical Studies''.  ed. Audrey Ekdahl Davidson.  Kalamazoo, Michigan: Medieval Institute Publications, 1992.  Pages 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Part I: Prologue in which the Virtues are introduced to the Patriarchs and Prophets who marvel at the Virtues.

Part II: We hear the complaints of souls that are imprisoned in bodies.  The (for now) happy Soul enters and her voice contrasts with the unhappy souls.  However, the Soul is too eager to skip life and go straight to Heaven.  When the Virtues tell her that she has to live first, the Devil seduces her away to worldly things.

Part III:  The Virtues take turns identifying and describing themselves while the Devil occasionally interrupts and expresses opposing views and insults. This is the longest section by far and, although devoid of drama or plot, the musical elements of this section make it stand out.

Part IV: The Soul returns, repentant.  Once the Virtues have accepted her back, they turn on the Devil, whom they bind. Together they conquer the Devil and then God is praised.

Part V: A procession of all the characters.

==Roles==
*The Soul (female voice)
* The Virtues (sung by 17 solo female voices): Humility (Queen of the Virtues), Hope, Chastity, Innocence, Contempt of the World, Celestial Love, Discipline? (the name is scratched out in the manuscript) Modesty, Mercy, Victory, Discretion, Patience, Knowledge of God, Charity, Fear of God, Obedience, and Faith&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Sheingorn.

Kalamazoo, Michigan: Medieval Institute Publications, 1992. Page 48.&lt;/ref&gt; These Virtues were seen as role models for the women of the Abbey, who took joy in overcoming their weaknesses and defeating the Devil in their own lives. 
* Chorus of the Prophets and Patriarchs (sung by a male chorus)
* Chorus of Souls (sung by a women’s chorus)
* The Devil (a male voice --&lt;ref&gt;Maud Burnett McInerney.  ''Eloquent Virgins from Thecla to Joan of Arc''.  New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2003.  Page 137.&lt;/ref&gt; the Devil does not sing, he only yells or grunts: according to Hildegard, he cannot produce divine harmony).&lt;ref&gt;Audrey Ekdahl Davidson.  "Music and Performance: Hildegard of Bingen’s ''Ordo Virtutum''".   ''The Ordo Virtutum of Hildegard of Bingen: Critical Studies''.  ed. Audrey Ekdahl Davidson.  Kalamazoo, Michigan: Medieval Institute Publications, 1992.  Page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The meaning and emphasis of the Ordo Virtutum in Hildegard of Bingen's community is affected by which persons in the community played which roles, and how they related to each other at the time of the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medieval Monastic Education|last=Ferzoco|first=George|publisher=A&amp;C Black|year=2000|isbn=9780718502461|location=|pages=72–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the soul represents Richardis von Stade, Hildegard’s friend and fellow nun, who had left to become abbess of another convent.  Hildegard was upset by this appointment and tried to have it revoked, appealing even to [[Pope Eugene III]].  However, Hildegard was unsuccessful and Richardis departed, only to die shortly thereafter on October 29, 1151.  Other scholarship propose an allusion to Hildegard's brother Bruno.&lt;ref&gt;Heineich Schipperrges ''Hildegard of Bingen: Healing and the Nature of the Cosmo''s M. Weiner, 1997 p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Before dying Richardis told her brother that she wanted to return to Hildegard, not unlike the returning, repentant Soul of Ordo Virtutum.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Bolton Holloway.  "The Monastic Context of Hildegard’s ''Ordo Virtutum''".  ''The Ordo Virtutum of Hildegard of Bingen: Critical Studies''.  ed. Audrey Ekdahl Davidson.  Kalamazoo, Michigan: Medieval Institute Publications, 1992.  Pages 70-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the piece is called Ordo Virtutum, which is typically translated to " Virtue Play". Many people are not aware that Ordo Virtutum's translation from Latin actually serves as a double meaning can also be translated to "Rules by which the world works".&lt;sup&gt;[citation needed]&lt;/sup&gt;

== Composition ==
Hildegard of Bingen was never classically trained in composition, nor was she trained to play instruments. She was "self-taught", although not in a way that many people would expect. Her whole life Hildegard of Bingen claimed to be both Clairvoyant and Clairaudient. The music came to her in her trances and that is how she was able to compose that many pieces without any formal training. She also attempted to describe what she was going through in her works such as Ordo Virtutum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://healthyhildegard.com/hildegard-music/|title=Hildegard Music - HealthyHildegard.com|date=2016-11-28|work=HealthyHildegard.com|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life in the Abbey ==
The performance of music of any kind in the abbeys of the medieval era would be a cause for celebration. The majority of the life of [[nun]]s would have been lead without speaking due to their [[vow of silence]]. The sisters dedicate their lives to poverty and would not indulge in human wants. The lives of women in this life would have been dedicated to the service of their community and [[God the Father]]. Speaking any idle words would have been seen as offensive. The performance of Ordo Virtutum would be a chance to use the human voice as a vessel for praise. The play was seen as a spiritual celebration and the joy of overcoming human weakness. A moment of religious celebration, at the consecration of an abbey, would have allowed the women to enjoy the joy of music while still worshiping God.

== The Healing Properties ==
In addition to the use of the human voice as a vessel for praise, it was found that music and rhythm had healing properties and could be used for good. Hildegard of Bingen believed that music had a direct correlation with the opening of Dys&amp;shy;[[anaesthesia]] (which is also known as the Third State of Consciousness).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/discover/people/professor-jaideep-pandit/ Jaideep J. Pandit] at [[St John's College, Oxford|St. John’s College in Oxford]] uses this term in the same sense, but without reference to its medieval origin: {{cite journal |vauthors=Pandit JJ |collaboration=37 participants |date=2014-09-09 |title=5th National Audit Project (NAP5) on accidental awareness during general anaesthesia: summary of main findings and risk factors |url=https://academic.oup.com/bja/article/113/4/549/2920161 |journal=[[British Journal of Anaesthesia]] |volume=113 |issue=4 |pages=549–559 |doi=10.1093/bja/aeu313 |access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music was used as a way to enlighten yourself and bring joy and positivity into your soul. It was a type of meditation that promoted relaxation. The manner in which this was practiced highly resembles the way buddhist meditation techniques are performed. Up until 2015 neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] was researching Hildegard's 12th century belief that music can bring a whole brain connection between the two hemispheres, to heal and calm the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foxhall|first=Katherine|date=July 2014|title=Making Modern Migraine Medieval: Men of Science, Hildegard of Bingen and the Life of a Retrospective Diagnosis|journal=Medical History|volume=58|issue=3|pages=354–374|doi=10.1017/mdh.2014.28|issn=0025-7273|pmc=4103393|pmid=25045179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical elements==
''Ordo Virtutum'' is written in [[verse drama and dramatic verse|dramatic verse]] and contains 82 different melodies, which are set more [[syllable|syllabically]] than Hildegard's [[liturgy|liturgical]] songs. All parts are sung in [[plainchant]] except that of the [[Devil]].&lt;ref name="Palisca"&gt;Claude V. Palisca. ''Norton Anthology of Western Music''. Vol. 1, 3rd ed. New York: Norton, 1996. Page 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is an alternation between solo and chorus parts as well as [[melisma]]tic versus syllabic lines.&lt;ref&gt;Audrey Ekdahl Davidson.  "Music and Performance: Hildegard of Bingen’s ''Ordo Virtutum''".   ''The Ordo Virtutum of Hildegard of Bingen: Critical Studies''.  ed. Audrey Ekdahl Davidson.  Kalamazoo, Michigan: Medieval Institute Publications, 1992.  Page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main "acts" in the play are set in allegorical towers and the musical dimensions are driven by the architectural understanding, for example, the development of processional chants that link the action in one tower to that of the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fassler|first=Margot|date=Summer 2014|title=Allegorical Architecture in Scivias: Hildegard's Setting for the Ordo Virtutum.|url=http://search.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.uwindsor.ca/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=97787747&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Journal of the American Musicological Society|volume=67|pages=317–378|via=EBSCOhost|doi=10.1525/jams.2014.67.2.317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final verses of the play move into a mystical mode and describe the crucifixion of Christ, asking the audience to bend their knees so that God may "stretch out his hand to you" (''genua vestra ad patrem vestrum flectite / ut vobis manum suam  porrigat,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;36–37). The final word, ''porrigat'' ("stretch out"), is set to thirty-nine notes, it is the longest melisma in the play. It is meant to illustrate the stretch of a divine hand toward humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Potter|first=Robert|date=Fall 1986|title=The "Ordo Virtutum": Ancestor of the English Moralities?|jstor=41153244|journal=Comparative Drama|volume=20|pages=201–210|doi=10.1353/cdr.1986.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oruno Lara''' (1879 – 1924) was a [[Guadeloupe]]an poet, author and historian, not to be confused with his grandson Dr. [[Oruno D. Lara]], also a historian. Head of [[Pointe-à-Pitre]]'s  ''Guadeloupe Littéraire'' journal, he arrived in [[France]] in 1914 with hopes of further developing his project of a literary and political journal. He was soon engulfed in the [[first World War]] until 1919 and following  traumas caused by the inhalation of gases used during the  war, he was inspired  to become a historian. Upon his return from war, he published a history of Guadeloupe, a text which was used to teach several generations of  Guadeloupean school children. In 1919, he founded the monthly ''Le Monde Colonial'' (The Colonial World) which echoed [[W.E.B. Dubois]]' and the first Pan-African Congress' denunciations of the racism inherent to [[European colonialism]].  In 1923 he wrote the novel ''Question de Couleurs: Blanches et Noirs, Roman de Moeurs'' ( i.e. ''An issue of Colors: Whites and Blacks, a Novel'')&lt;ref name= "Schmidt"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmidt|first1=Nelly|title=Histoire du Métissage|date=2003|publisher=Editions de Lamartinière|location=France|isbn=2-7324-3047-1|pages=192–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Career as a typographer and pressman==
Born in [[Guadeloupe]], Oruno Lara worked from the age of 11 as an apprentice typographer at the press for the paper ''La Vérité'', which had been founded in 1888. He was then hired as a typographer at ''Courrier de la Guadeloupe'' and at ''La République'' in 1900. He went on to become an editor at ''L'Indépendant de la Pointe-à-Pitre'' (1901)  and at the papers ''La Démocratie'', ''La Vérité'', at ''L'émancipation'' and at ''[[Le Nouvelliste (Guadeloupe)|Le Nouvelliste]]'', founded by his brother Hildevert-Adolphe in 1909. Their brother Augereau founded ''L'Homme Enchaîné'' (aka ''The Chained Man'') and ''L'Action''.&lt;ref name = "tracées22"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lara|first1=Oruno D.|title=Tracées d'Historien|date=2007|publisher=L'Harmattan|location=Paris|isbn=978-2-296-04932-1|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Oruno Lara eventually created the journal ''La Guadeloupe Littéraire'', publishing the work of local poets.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RW_WtmS7igsC&amp;pg=PA472&amp;lpg=PA472&amp;dq=oruno+lara&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3QMOERytBP&amp;sig=roFBoiZX28ZQlvXwUPl8Q39rbDo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbrpHPicnZAhUpxVkKHa4xA7A4ChDoAQg6MAM#v=onepage&amp;q=oruno%20lara&amp;f=false|title=A History of Literature in the Caribbean: Hispanic and francophone regions|last=Arnold|first=Albert James|last2=Rodríguez-Luis|first2=Julio|last3=Dash|first3=J. Michael|date=1994|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|year=|isbn=9027234426|location=|pages=472|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Legacy as a historian==
Lara was the first Guadeloupean historian to break from the dominant historiography of French colonial planters and administrators by looking at the totality of influences on Guadeloupe, beyond just the French colonialist narrative. He was also the first to strive to transmit this history to Guadeloupean children, against great odds.  He wrote in the preface to his 1921 book ''La Guadeloupe physique, économique, agricole, commerciale, financière, politique et sociale de la découverte à nos jours (1492-1900)'':&lt;ref name= "Tracées2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lara|first1=Oruno D.|title=Tracées d'Historien|date=2007|publisher=|location=|isbn=|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"It is really the job of one of us to write our own history;  and when born of yesterday we seem to have neither past nor official identity, it behooves one of us to erect a more beautiful past... Ignorance of yesterday is a great weakness."

His ''La Guadeloupe de la Découverte à Nos Jours'' was the first history book about Guadeloupe written by a non-white.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VvfE0R8m_tUC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=oruno+lara&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjT3r_opcnZAhVErFMKHX0eD5o4ChDoAQhUMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=oruno%20lara&amp;f=false|title=L'esclave fugitif dans la littérature antillaise: sur la déclive du morne|last=Rochmann|first=Marie-Christine|date=2000|publisher=KARTHALA Editions|isbn=9782865379859|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing style and racial consciousness==
Despite emulating the writing style of white creole writers from his native Guadeloupe, Lara is noted as being among the first non-white Guadeloupean authors to assert black or mulatto consciousness and to write on race, racial tension and colorism. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gamwDtyXY0AC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=oruno+lara&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-_6vkncnZAhUQ0VMKHY1NBXQQ6AEIYDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=oruno%20lara&amp;f=false|title=Mapping a Tradition: Francophone Women's Writing from Guadeloupe|last=Haigh|first=Sam|date=2000|publisher=MHRA|year=|isbn=9781902653204|location=|pages=2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSEvDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT178&amp;dq=oruno+lara&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-_6vkncnZAhUQ0VMKHY1NBXQQ6AEIWjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=oruno%20lara&amp;f=false|title=Writing and Race|last=Youngs|first=Tim|date=2017-07-28|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781315504995|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancestors, siblings and spouse==
Oruno Lara's father Moïse Lara had been a slave until 1843. Moïse's mother Bertilde had been a slave until 1848.&lt;ref name = "Tracées"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lara|first1=Oruno D.|title=Tracées d'Historien|date=2007|publisher=|location=|isbn=|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moïse Lara was freed from slavery at the age of 21 in 1843 while he was a cook. Moïse Lara then moved to [[Pointe-à-Pitre]] where he worked as a carpenter while collaborating to the creation of the paper ''Le Progrès'' in 1849. That same year he participated in demonstrations against the  electoral campaign for the legislative Assembly of the candidate Bissette who was an ally of the French planters of Martinique. Moïse wrote a letter to the ''Progrès'' registering his disapproval.&lt;ref name = "tracées22" /&gt;

Born in 1822, Moïse Lara worked hard to leave his children extensive documentation of events that he witnessed, in addition to his convictions.&lt;ref name = "oubli"/&gt; Moïse married Oruno's mother Amélie Pédurand in 1879. They had four children: Hildevert-Adolphe (1876), Oruno (1879), Augereau and Ferlande.&lt;ref name="tracées22"/&gt; Amélie had been born in 1848 to a [[mulatto]] woman from Grands Fonds in [[Sainte-Anne, Guadeloupe]] who died of cholera in 1865. She often told stories from the times of her husband Moïse's demonstrations and political agitation against slavery and the colonial order.&lt;ref name = "oubli"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lara|first1=Oruno D.|title=De l'oubli à l'histoire. Espace et identité Caraïbes (Guadeloupe, Guyane, Haïti, Martinique)|date=1998|publisher=Maisonneuve et Larose|location=Paris|isbn=2-7068-1351-2|pages=180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oruno had another brother, Moïse's first son Sully Lara who wrote novels and essays.&lt;ref name = "tracées22" /&gt;

This legacy likely motivated Oruno Lara's publication of his book on Guadeloupean history in 1921 which he published with the help of his wife—teacher and poet Agathe Réache—against great odds: unemployment, archives far away in Europe, war and disease.&lt;ref name="oubli"/&gt;

===Origins of the name Lara===
Oruno Lara's father Moïse adopted the name Lara after he was emancipated from slavery. [[Oruno D. Lara]] has written that the name was likely inspired by the fact that Moïse's ancestors were from Venezuela.&lt;ref name = "Tracées"/&gt;

==Heirs==
Oruno Lara's grandson [[Oruno D. Lara]], a prolific historian, was born after his death.&lt;ref name = "lara"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lara|first1=Oruno D.|title=De l'oubli à l'histoire.|date=1998|publisher=|location=|isbn=|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Another grandson [[Christian Lara (film director)|Christian Lara]], is a noted filmmaker.

Oruna Lara's great-grandson is [[Kernan Heinz]], named after a well-known Spanish historian called Hernan Cortes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2891">The [[Early Pandyan Kingdom|earliest]] coins of the [[Pandyan Kingdom]] were copper squares and were struck with a die. The coins were with five distinct images on one side, often an image of an elephant on that side and a stylised fish on the other, seen typically in the coins found around [[Korkai]], their ancient capital and in Northern Lanka. These rectangular coins of the early Pandyans also featured the Nandi bull and contain Chakrams. The ”Chakram” consists of two lines forming an acute angle, the apex being uppermost ; with are two crossed lines parallel to the sides of the angle which they join. All four lines end at the bottom of the symbol on the same level. This symbol but with the outer lines somewhat shorter than the inner is used by certain Tamils in the Anuradhapura District as a brand-mark for cattle ; a variant with the outer lines continued beyond the apex in the form of a loop or of a pair of pincers occurs in the Northern Province and represents a makara. The symbol or brandmark on the coin being a conventional fish, the well-known Pandyans badge.

Upon the revival of the Kingdom in the 7th-10th centuries, the predominant image was one or two fish, and the Pandyan bull. Sometimes they were with other images like a "Chola standing figure" or the "Chalukyan boar." The inscription on the silver and gold coins is in [[Sanskrit]], and most of their copper coins have [[Tamil language|Tamil]] legends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Pandyan's coins figure prominently on the [[Pre-modern coinage in Sri Lanka|coins used in northern Sri Lanka]] during the early period, and large hoards of their coins have been found in [[Kandarodai]] and [[Anuradhapura]] from the [[Sangam period]].

'''Polybius''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|l|ɪ|b|i|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Πολύβιος}}, ''Polýbios''; {{circa|lk=no|200}}&amp;nbsp;– {{circa|lk=no|118}}&amp;nbsp;BC) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] historian of the [[Hellenistic period]] noted for his work {{nowrap|''[[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]]'',}} which covered the period of 264–146 BC in detail. The work describes the rise of the [[Roman Republic]] to the status of dominance in the ancient Mediterranean world and includes his eyewitness account of the [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|Sack of Carthage]] in 146 BC. 

Polybius is important for his analysis of the mixed constitution or the [[separation of powers]] in government, which was influential on [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' and the framers of the [[United States Constitution]].

==Origins==
Polybius was born around 200 BC in [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]], [[Arcadia]], when it was an active member of the [[Achaean League]]. His father, [[Lycortas]], was a prominent, land-owning politician and member of the governing class who became ''[[strategos]]'' (commanding general) of the [[Achaean League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0144:book=39:chapter=35&amp;highlight=lycortas|title=Titus Livius (Livy),  The History of Rome, Book 39, chapter 35|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Polybius was able to observe first hand the political and military affairs of Megalopolis. He developed an interest in horse riding and hunting, diversions that later commended him to his Roman captors. 

In 182 BC, he was given quite an honor when he was chosen to carry the funeral urn of [[Philopoemen]], one of the most eminent Achaean politicians of his generation. In either 169 BC or 170 BC, Polybius was elected [[hipparchus (cavalry officer)]], an event which often presaged election to the annual ''[[strategia]]'' (chief generalship). His early political career was devoted largely towards maintaining the independence of Megalopolis.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Personal experiences==
Polybius’ father, Lycortas, was a prominent advocate of neutrality during the Roman war against [[Perseus of Macedonia|Perseus]] of [[Macedon]]. Lycortas attracted the suspicion of the Romans, and Polybius subsequently was one of the 1,000 [[Achaea (ancient region)|Achaean]] nobles who were transported to Rome as hostages in 167 BC, and was detained there for 17 years. In Rome, by virtue of his high culture, Polybius was admitted to the most distinguished houses, in particular to that of [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus]], the conqueror in the [[Third Macedonian War]], who entrusted Polybius with the education of his sons, Fabius and [[Scipio Aemilianus Africanus|Scipio Aemilianus]] (who had been adopted by the eldest son of [[Scipio Africanus]]). Polybius remained on cordial terms with his former pupil Scipio Aemilianus and  was among the members of the [[Scipionic Circle]]. 

When Scipio defeated the [[Carthaginians]] in the [[Third Punic War]], Polybius remained his counsellor. The Achaean hostages were released in 150 BC, and Polybius was granted leave to return home, but the next year he went on campaign with Scipio Aemilianus to [[Africa]], and was present at the [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|Sack of Carthage]] in 146, which he later described. Following the destruction of Carthage, Polybius likely journeyed along the Atlantic coast of Africa, as well as Spain.

After the destruction of [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] in the same year, Polybius returned to Greece, making use of his Roman connections to lighten the conditions there. Polybius was charged with the difficult task of organizing the new form of government in the Greek cities, and in this office he gained great recognition.

==At Rome==
In the succeeding years, Polybius resided in [[Rome]], completing his historical work while occasionally undertaking long journeys through the Mediterranean countries in the furtherance of his history, in particular with the aim of obtaining firsthand knowledge of historical sites. He apparently interviewed veterans to clarify details of the events he was recording and was similarly given access to archival material. Little is known of Polybius' later life; he most likely accompanied Scipio to Spain, acting as his military advisor during the [[Numantine War]]. 

He later wrote about this war in a lost monograph. Polybius probably returned to Greece later in his life, as evidenced by the many existent inscriptions and statues of him there. The last event mentioned in his ''Histories'' seems to be the construction of the [[Via Domitia]] in southern France in 118 BC, which suggests the writings of [[Lucian#Pseudo-Lucian|Pseudo-Lucian]] may have some grounding in fact when they state, "[Polybius] fell from his horse while riding up from the country, fell ill as a result and died at the age of eighty-two".

==''The Histories''==
{{Main|The Histories (Polybius)}}

Polybius’ ''Histories'' cover the period from 264 BC to 146 BC. Its main focus is the period from 220 BC to 167 BC, describing Rome's efforts in subduing its arch-enemy, Carthage, and thereby becoming the dominant Mediterranean force. Books I through V of ''The Histories'' are the introduction for the years during his lifetime, describing the politics in leading Mediterranean states, including ancient Greece and Egypt, and culminating in their ultimate ''συμπλοκή'' or interconnectedness. In Book VI, Polybius describes the political, military, and moral institutions that allowed the Romans to succeed.  He describes the [[First Punic War|First]] and [[Second Punic War]]s. Polybius concludes the Romans are the pre-eminent power because they have customs and institutions which promote a deep desire for noble acts, a love of virtue, piety towards parents and elders, and a fear of the gods (''deisidaimonia''). 

He also chronicled the conflicts between Hannibal and Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus such as the [[Battle of Ticinus]], the [[Battle of the Trebia]], the [[Siege of Saguntum]], the [[Battle of Lilybaeum]], and the [[Battle of Rhone Crossing]]. In Book XII, Polybius discusses the worth of [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]]’ account of the same period of history. He asserts Timaeus' point of view is inaccurate, invalid, and biased in favor of Rome. Therefore, Polybius's ''Histories'' is also useful in analyzing the different Hellenistic versions of history and of use as a credible illustration of actual events during the Hellenistic period.

===Sources===
In the seventh volume of his ''Histories'', Polybius defines the historian's job as the analysis of documentation, the review of relevant geographical information, and political experience. Polybius held that historians should only chronicle events whose participants the historian was able to interview, and was among the first to champion the notion of [[Journalism ethics and standards|factual integrity]] in historical writing. In Polybius' time, the profession of a historian required political experience (which aided in differentiating between fact and fiction) and familiarity with the geography surrounding one's subject matter to supply an accurate version of events. 

Polybius himself exemplified these principles as he was well travelled and possessed political and military experience. He did not neglect written sources that proved essential material for his histories of the period from 264 BC to 220 BC. When addressing events after 220 BC, he examined the writings of Greek and Roman historians to acquire credible sources of information, but rarely did he name those sources.

==As historian==
Polybius wrote several works, the majority of which are lost. His earliest work was a biography of the Greek statesman [[Philopoemen]]; this work was later used as a source by [[Plutarch]] when composing his ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', however the original Polybian text is lost. In addition, Polybius wrote an extensive treatise entitled ''Tactics'', which may have detailed Roman and Greek [[military tactics]]. Small parts of this work may survive in his major ''Histories'', but the work itself is lost, as well. Another missing work was a historical monograph on the events of the [[Numantine War]]. The largest Polybian work was, of course, his ''Histories'', of which only the first five books survive entirely intact, along with a large portion of the sixth book and fragments of the rest. Along with [[Cato the Elder]] (234–149 BC), he can be considered one of the founding fathers of Roman historiography.

[[Livy]] made reference to and uses Polybius' ''Histories'' as source material in his own narrative. Polybius was among the first historians to attempt to present history as a sequence of causes and effects, based upon a careful examination and criticism of tradition. He narrated his history based upon first-hand knowledge. ''The Histories'' capture the varied elements of the story of human behavior: nationalism, [[xenophobia]], duplicitous politics, war, brutality, loyalty, valour, intelligence, reason, and resourcefulness.

Aside from the narrative of the historical events, Polybius also included three books of digressions. Book 34 was entirely devoted to questions of geography and included some trenchant criticisms of [[Eratosthenes]], whom he accused of passing on popular preconceptions or ''laodogmatika''.  Book 12 was a disquisition on the writing of history, citing extensive passages of lost historians, such as [[Callisthenes]] and [[Theopompus]]. Most influential was Book 6, which describes Roman political, military, and moral institutions, which he considered key to Rome's success; it presented Rome as having a mixed constitution in which monarchical, aristocratic, and popular elements existed in stable equilibrium. This enabled Rome to escape, for the time being, the cycle of eternal revolutions (''[[anacyclosis]]'').  While Polybius was not the first to advance this view, his account provides the most cogent illustration of the ideal for later political theorists.

A key theme of ''The Histories'' is the good statesman as virtuous and composed. The character of the Polybian statesman is exemplified in that of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]]. His beliefs about Philip's character led Polybius to reject historian [[Theopompus]]' description of Philip's private, drunken debauchery. For Polybius, it was inconceivable that such an able and effective statesman could have had an immoral and unrestrained private life as described by Theopompus.&lt;ref&gt;Hannibal at New Carthage: Polybius 3. 15 and the Power of Irrationality
Author: A. M. Eckstein, Classical Philology, Vol. 84, No. 1 (January 1989), pp. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;
In recounting the [[Roman Republic]], Polybius stated that "the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] stands in awe of the multitude, and cannot neglect the feelings of the people".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234%3Aid%3Db6c16 Polybius on the Senate and People (6.16)] from [[Perseus Digital Library]] at [[Tufts University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important themes running through ''The Histories'' are the role of Fortune in the affairs of nations, his insistence that history should be demonstratory, or [[Apodicticity|''apodeiktike'']], providing lessons for statesmen, and that historians should be "men of action" ([[Pragmatics|''pragmatikoi'']]).

Polybius is considered by some to be the successor of [[Thucydides]] in terms of [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] and critical [[reasoning]], and the forefather of scholarly, painstaking historical research in the modern scientific sense. According to this view, his work sets forth the course of history's occurrences with clearness, penetration, sound judgment, and, among the circumstances affecting the outcomes, he lays especial emphasis on geographical conditions. Modern historians are especially impressed with the manner in which Polybius used his sources, particularly documentary evidence as well as his citation and quotation of sources. Furthermore, there is some admiration of Polybius's meditation on the nature of historiography in Book 12. His work belongs, therefore, amongst the greatest productions of ancient historical writing.  The writer of the ''Oxford Companion to Classical Literature'' (1937) praises him for his "earnest devotion to truth" and his systematic pursuit of causation.

It has long been acknowledged that Polybius's writings are prone to a certain [[hagiographic]] tone when writing of his friends, such as Scipio, and subject to a vindictive tone when detailing the exploits of his enemies, such as Callicrates, the Achaean statesman responsible for his Roman exile.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Green, Alexander to Actium&lt;/ref&gt;

As a hostage in Rome, then as client to the Scipios, and after 146 BC, a collaborator with Roman rule, Polybius was probably in no position to freely express any negative opinions of Rome. [[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]] advises that Polybius was chronicling Roman history for a Greek audience, to justify what he believed to be the inevitability of Roman rule. Nonetheless, Green considers Polybius's ''Histories'' the best source for the era they cover. For [[Ronald J. Mellor|Ronald Mellor]], Polybius was a loyal partisan of [[Scipio Aemilianus|Scipio]], intent on vilifying his patron's opponents.&lt;ref&gt;The Historians of Ancient Rome, Ronald J. Mellor&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adrian Goldsworthy]], while using Polybius as a source for Scipio's generalship, notes Polybius' underlying and overt bias in Scipio's favour.  H. Ormerod considers that Polybius cannot be regarded as an 'altogether unprejudiced witness' in relation to his ''betes noires''; the Aetolians, the Carthaginians, and the Cretans.&lt;ref&gt;Piracy in the Ancient World, p141 H Ormerod&lt;/ref&gt;  Other historians perceive considerable negative bias in Polybius' account of [[Ancient Crete|Crete]];&lt;ref&gt;Mogens Herman Hansen 1995, ''Sources for the Ancient Greek City-State: Symposium'', August 24–27, 1994, Kgl. Danske, Videnskabernes Selskab, 376 pages {{ISBN|87-7304-267-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand, Hansen notes that the same work, along with passages from [[Strabo]] and [[Scylax]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Pashley]], ''Travels in Crete'', 1837, J. Murray&lt;/ref&gt; proved a reliable guide in the eventual  rediscovery of the lost city of [[Kydonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10881/cydonia.html#fieldnotes |title=C.

==Cryptography==
Polybius was responsible for a useful tool in [[telegraphy]] that allowed letters to be easily signaled using a numerical system (mentioned in [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/10*.html#45.6 Hist. X.45.6&amp;nbsp;ff.]).  This idea also lends itself to [[cryptography|cryptographic]] manipulation and [[steganography]].

This was known as the "[[Polybius square]]", where the letters of the alphabet were arranged left to right, top to bottom in a 5 x 5 square, (when used with the modern [[Latin alphabet|26 letter alphabet]], the letters "I" and "J" are combined). Five numbers were then aligned on the outside top of the square, and five numbers on the left side of the square vertically.  Usually these numbers were arranged 1 through 5.  By cross-referencing the two numbers along the grid of the square, a letter could be deduced.

In ''The Histories'', he specifies how this cypher could be used in fire signals, where long-range messages could be sent by means of torches raised and lowered to signify the column and row of each letter.  This was a great leap forward from previous fire signaling, which could send prearranged codes only (such as, 'if we light the fire, it means that the enemy has arrived').

Other writings of scientific interest include detailed discussions of the machines Archimedes created for the defense of Syracuse against the Romans, where he praises the 'old man' and his engineering in the highest terms, and an analysis of the usefulness of astronomy to generals (both in the ''Histories'').

[[File:Cicero - Musei Capitolini.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Marcus Tullius Cicero]]
Polybius was considered a poor stylist by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], writing of Polybius' history that "no one has the endurance to reach [its] end".&lt;ref&gt;Comp. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, clearly he was widely read by Romans and Greeks alike.  He is quoted extensively by [[Strabo]] writing in the 1st century BC and [[Athenaeus]] in the 3rd century AD.  

His emphasis on explaining causes of events, rather than just recounting events, influenced the historian [[Sempronius Asellio]]. Polybius is mentioned by [[Cicero]] and mined for information by [[Diodorus]], [[Livy]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Arrian]].  Much of the text that survives today from the later books of ''The Histories'' was preserved in Byzantine anthologies.

His works reappeared in the West first in Renaissance [[Florence]]. Polybius gained a following in Italy, and although poor Latin translations hampered proper scholarship on his works, they contributed to the city's historical and political discourse. [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] in his ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'' evinces familiarity with Polybius. Vernacular translations in French, German, Italian and English first appeared during the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Polybius |author2=Frank W. Walbank |author3=Ian Scott-Kilvert  | title = The Rise of the Roman Empire | publisher = [[Penguin Classics]] | year = 1979| isbn = 0-14-044362-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in the late 16th century, Polybius's works found a greater reading audience among the learned public. Study of the correspondence of such men as [[Isaac Casaubon]], [[Jacques Auguste de Thou]], [[William Camden]], and [[Paolo Sarpi]] reveals a growing interest in Polybius' works and thought during the period. Despite the existence of both printed editions in the vernacular and increased scholarly interest, however, Polybius remained an "historian's historian", not much read by the public at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Printings of his work in the [[vernacular]] remained few in number — seven in [[French language|French]], five in [[English language|English]], and five in [[Italian language|Italian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Polybius' political analysis has influenced republican thinkers from [[Cicero]] to [[Montesquieu|Charles de Montesquieu]] to the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Davies Lloyd, [http://mlloyd.org/mdl-indx/polybius/intro.htm ''Polybius and the Founding Fathers: the separation of powers''], Sept. 22, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Adams]], for example, considered him one of the most important teachers of constitutional theory. Since the [[Age of Enlightenment]], Polybius has in general held appeal to those interested in [[Hellenistic Greece]] and early Republican Rome, while his political and military writings have lost influence in academia. More recently, thorough work on the Greek text of Polybius, and his historical technique, has increased the academic understanding and appreciation of him as a historian.

According to [[Edward Tufte]], he was also a major source for [[Charles Joseph Minard]]'s figurative map of [[Hannibal]]'s overland journey into [[Italy]] during the [[Second Punic War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/minard-hannibal |title=Minard's figurative map of Hannibal's war |publisher=Edwardtufte.com |accessdate=2010-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Meditations On Hunting'', Spanish philosopher [[José Ortega y Gasset]] calls Polybius "one of the few great minds that the turbid human species has managed to produce", and says the damage to the ''Histories'' is "without question one of the gravest losses that we have suffered in our Greco-Roman heritage".

The Italian version of his name, Polibio, was used as a male first name - for example, the composer [[Polibio Fumagalli]] - though it never became very common.

The University of Pennsylvania has an intellectual society, the Polybian Society, which is named in his honor and serves as a non-partisan forum for discussing societal issues and policy.

== Belief ==
Providentialism was sometimes viewed by its adherents as differing between national providence and personal providence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some English and American Christians came to view personal providentialism as backward and superstitious, while continuing to believe in national providentialism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; National providentialism was described by the British historian [[Nicholas Guyatt]] as encompassing three broader beliefs: God judged nations on the virtues of its leaders, there is a special role for certain nations, and finally that God worked out a master plan through the role of various nations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 
Providentialism was frequently featured in discussions of European political and intellectual elites seeking to justify [[imperialism]] in the 19th century, on the grounds that the suffering caused by European conquest was justified under the grounds of furthering God's plan and spreading [[Christianity]] and [[civilization]] to distant nations.&lt;ref name="prov"&gt;{{cite book | title=Seers of God: Puritan Providentialism in the Restoration and Early Enlightenment| last=Winship| first=Michael P.| year=2000| publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press| isbn=0-8018-6376-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="popery"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Alexandra Walsham| title='The Fatall Vesper': Providentialism and [[Anti-Popery]] in Late Jacobean London| journal=Past and Present| date=Aug 1994| volume=144 | doi = 10.1093/past/144.1.36 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of historians, it was an ''interpretive framework'' of occurring natural, political and social events at a time when religious and secular were not clearly divided.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, James Frederick. Democratic Communications: Formations, Projects, Possibilities. Lanham: Lexington Books, 2008, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Providentialism may be understood as the acceptance of the belief that all that happens in the world is for the greater good, since, "God created the social order and appointed each individual in his place within it."&lt;ref&gt;Smuts, R. Malcolm. Culture and Power in England, 1585-1685. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1999, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quiverfull movement==
Providentialism is also a term sometimes used to refer to the general [[philosophy]] of [[Quiverfull]] adherents.  Quiverfull is a small movement among conservative [[evangelical Christians]].  Advocates oppose the general acceptance among [[Protestant]] Christians of deliberately limiting family size through use of [[birth control]]. Advocates believe God controls via providence how many children are conceived and born, pointing to Bible verses that describe God acting to "open and close the womb". Continual "openness to children", to [[conception (biology)|conception]] during routine [[sexual intercourse]], irrespective of timing of the month during the [[ovulation]] cycle, is considered by Quiverfull adherents as part of their Christian calling in submission to the lordship of Christ.&lt;ref name="open_embrace"&gt;{{cite book | title=Open Embrace: A Protestant Couple Rethinks Contraception| last=Torode| first=Sam and Bethany| year=2002| publisher=Wm.

'''Psychic archaeology''' is a loose collection of practices involving the application of [[paranormal]] phenomena to problems in [[archaeology]]. It is not considered part of mainstream archaeology, or taught in academic institutions. It is difficult to test scientifically, since archaeological sites are relatively abundant, and all of its verified predictions could have been made via educated guesses.&lt;ref name="feder"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cole, John R. (1978). ''Anthropology Beyond the Fringe: Ancient Inscriptions, Early Man and Scientific Method''. The Skeptical Inquirer 2(2): 62-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners of psychic archaeology utilize a variety of methods of [[divination]] ranging from [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] methods such as [[dowsing]] and [[mediumship|channeling]].&lt;ref&gt;Feder, Kenneth L. (1980). ''Psychic Archaeology: The Anatomy of Irrationalist Prehistoric Studies''. The Skeptical Inquirer 4(4): 32-43.&lt;/ref&gt; Some psychic archaeologists engage in fieldwork while others, such as [[Edgar Cayce]] (who claims to have had access to ancient [[Akashic records]]), exclusively engage in [[remote viewing]]. [[Frederick Bligh Bond]]'s research at [[Glastonbury Abbey]] is one of the first documented examples of psychic archaeology and remains a principal case in many discussions of psychic archaeology.&lt;ref name="Fantastic Archaeology"&gt;{{cite book | title=Fantastic Archaeology: The Wild Side of North American Prehistory| last=Williams| first=Stephen| year=1991| publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press| location=Philadelphia| isbn=0-8122-1312-2| chapter=Psychic Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Psychic archaeology is the use of [[extrasensory perception]] to locate sites for [[Archaeology|archaeological]] [[Excavation (archaeology)|digs]], or describe context of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]]. Psychic archaeology is alluring for several reasons, respective to the type of psychic archaeology employed. For instance, surveying techniques such as dowsing are less costly in terms of time and equipment than conventional noninvasive surveying techniques such as [[Ground penetrating radar survey (archaeology)|Ground Penetrating Radar]] or [[Geophysical survey (archaeology)|magnetometery surveys]]. Techniques for locating sites and [[Shovel test pit|test pits]] such as [[automatic writing]] and various [[scrying]] techniques are easy to perform. Psychic archaeologists claim that many of their techniques address lives of the past directly. Whereas accepted archaeologists make inferences about lives of the past based on [[material culture]], some psychic archaeologists say they have visions of non-material aspects of the lives they study.

==Methods==
There are several common methods employed by practitioners of psychic archaeologists including:

===Dowsing===
[[File:Allemanswiro.jpg|thumb|left|Dowsing rods]]

[[Dowsing]] in psychic archaeology can take on many forms. One of the better publicized methods and the subject of psychic archaeologist Karen Hunt’s 1981 masters thesis at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] involves dowsing for ''Electromagnetic Photo-Fields'' (EMPF) using two L-shaped [Ferrous] coat hangers bent about 17.8&amp;nbsp;cm from the end as electromagnetic photo sensors. Hunt stated that the electromagnetic photo sensors detect EMPF similar to a proton magnetometer detecting magnetic fields. Crossed dowsing rods indicated the crossing of an EMPF, which are said to be three-dimensional patterns generated by man-made objects left in place for at least six-months.&lt;ref name="Plummer"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Plummer, Mark| title=Locating Invisible Buildings| journal=The Skeptical Inquirer| year=1991| volume=15| issue=4| pages=386–397}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are other methods of dowsing employed in psychic archaeology with less inherent scientism than EMPF. Often conventional dowsers will offer their services to archaeologist with varying explanation for their methods.&lt;ref name="Van Leusen"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Van Leusen, Martijn| title=Dowsing and Archaeology| journal=The Skeptical Inquirer| year=1999| volume=23| issue=2| pages=33–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Straddling the border of dowsing and [[mediumship|channeling]] is a technique known as map dowsing, in which a medium or psychic dangles a [[pendulum]] over a map of the area of a potential dig to divine ideal locations for test pits or excavation.

===Psychometry===
[[File:Stefan Ossowiecki.jpg|thumb|right|200|Stefan Ossowiecki]]
An example of [[psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]] in psychic archaeology occurred at 17:45, 22 October 1941 when Professor Stanisław Poniatowski of the [[University of Warsaw]] handed Polish psychic [[Stefan Ossowiecki]] a projectile point from the [[Magdalenian]] culture. After holding the artifact Ossowiecki stated that it was a spear point from France or Belgium, belonging to round house dwelling people with brownish skin, black hair, short stature, large hands, feet and hips wearing skins. He describes a funeral [[pyre]], burial, and two domesticated dogs.&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;{{cite book | title=Psychic Archaeology: Time Machine to the Past| last=Goodman| first=Jeffrey| year=1977| publisher=Berkley Publishing| location=New York| isbn=978-0-425-05000-2| pages= 31–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffrey Goodman, author and psychic archaeologist, considers Ossowiecki’s psychometry validated for the following reasons: large hipped women are observed in Magdalenian [[Venus figurines]], bone needles associated with Magdalenian culture may have been used to sew skin clothing, and the bearded man on the funeral pyre “may have been one of the bearded Magdalenians who are found represented in Magdalenian cave art.”&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt;

==Sites==
===Chichén Itzá===

[[Augustus Le Plongeon]], an eccentric explorer who concentrated on [[Maya civilization|Maya]] sites in the northern [[Yucatan Peninsula]], was an early practitioner of psychic archaeology. In 1877, Juan Péon Contreras, director of the Museo Yucateco in [[Mérida, Yucatán|Mérida]], noted that Le Plongeon's discoveries of sculpture at [[Chichén Itzá]] resulted from the application of "abstruse archaeological reasoning and... [[meditation]].".&lt;ref name="Romancing the Maya"&gt;{{cite book | title=Romancing the Maya: Mexican Antiquity in the American Imagination 1820-1915| last=Evans| first=R. Tripp| year=2004| publisher=University of Texas Press| location=Austin| isbn=978-0-292-72221-7 }}, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;  R. Tripp Evans refers to this as "psychic archaeology," noting that Le Plongeon's wife [[Alice Dixon Le Plongeon]] had an avid interest in [[mesmerism]], [[séances|séance]], and the [[occult]].&lt;ref name="Romancing the Maya"/&gt;  [[Helena Blavatsky]], a co-founder of the [[Theosophical Society]], regarded the work of the Le Plongeons as proving the validity of "[[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] archaeology.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A Dream of Maya: Augustus and Alice Le Plongeon in Nineteenth-Century Yucatan| last=Desmond| first=Lawrence| last2=Phyllis| first2=Messenger| year=1988| publisher=University of New Mexico Press| location=Albuquerque}}, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;  However, professional archaeologists regard Le Plongeon as an obvious [[crank (person)|crank]].&lt;ref name="Romancing the Maya" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A Dream of Maya: Augustus and Alice Le Plongeon in Nineteenth-Century Yucatan| last=Desmond| first=Lawrence| last2=Phyllis| first2=Messenger| year=1988| publisher=University of New Mexico Press| location=Albuquerque}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glastonbury Abbey===
[[File:Glastonburyabbey.jpg|thumb|Glastonbury Abbey]]
[[Glastonbury Abbey]] was a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] religious complex located at Glastonbury, UK until 1539, when it was destroyed by edict of King [[Henry VIII]]. According to [[Frederick Bligh Bond]] the Abbey was founded in 166 [[Common Era|CE]], although this founding date is disputed by historians; the commonly accepted date is in the 7th Century when, according to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' King [[Ine of Wessex]] established a minster at Glastonbury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glastonburyabbey.com/history.php?&amp;dx=1&amp;ob=3&amp;rpn=index&amp;sid=0193bc3d360aac93e01c4a542ff9fe82. |title=History and Archaeology – Glastonbury Abbey |accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 17, 1907 F. Bligh Bond had his friend Captain John Bartlett (Given the [[Pseudonym]] John Alleyne in ''The Gate of Remembrance '') engage in communicating with spirits via [[Automatic writing]] for the purpose of learning about Glastonbury Abbey’s past. Captain Bartlett's communication with spirits produced two sketches of the abbey’s layout signed by "Gulielmus Monachus." The layouts showed a chapel to the east of the abbey that was unknown to F. Bligh Bond, he asked that Captain Bartlett’s source provide more information about this building. Accordingly, Captain Bartlett wrote that the chapel had been erected by [[Richard Beere|Abbot Beere]], completed by [[Richard Whiting (abbot)|Abbot Whiting]] and named in honor of [[Edgar the Peaceful|King Edgar]].

F. Bligh Bond began excavation at Glastonbury in the summer of 1909. While excavating he demonstrated the accuracy of Captain Bartlett’s sketches discovering Edgar Chapel in the location indicated by Captain Bartlett.&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt;

Bond didn't reveal that he was using psychic powers until 1917, when he had already presented his results. The Church of England officials were so embarrassed that they fired him.&lt;ref name="nickell"&gt;{{citation |title= Adventures in Paranormal Investigation |author= [[Joe Nickell]] |edition= illustrated |publisher= University Press of Kentucky |year= 2007 |isbn= 978-0-8131-2467-4 |pages= 48–49 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hSmW_I8nonkC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream archeologists are far from nonplussed about the discovery, reminding people that F. Bligh Bond was an expert in medieval church architecture, that most of the site had already been dug out, and that the location of the chapel could be easily guessed from the existing data.&lt;ref name="Fantastic Archaeology" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nickell" /&gt; Archaeologist [[Stephen Williams (archeologist)|Stephen Williams]] said that "Culture is a patterned behavior, and medieval cathedrals are some of the most patterned pieces of construction in our culture... All he had to do was turn to almost any nearby structure, such as [[Salisbury Cathedral]], less than fifty miles to the east, and see its Trinity Chapel behind the main altar and guess that Glastonbury would have one too.&lt;ref name="Fantastic Archaeology"/&gt;

===Point Cook===
[[Point Cook]] Australia {{Coord|37|55|33.6|S|144|47|30.7|E|display=inline}} was the location of a psychic archaeological survey by Karen A. B. Hunt M.A. in 1981. Hunt employed dowsing rods to detect ''Electromagnetic Photo-Fields'' (EMPF). Hunt mapped the locations of 129 buildings or cultural points including the house, outbuildings, a windmill, a tank stand, the fences and gates of the homestead. While the location of the windmill and tank stand match established facts, skeptic Mark Plummer considers Hunt’s survey dubious for several reasons, including architectural style, which he and a team of architects find more indicative of 1870-1900 American architecture than Australian Colonial architecture. 
&lt;ref name="Fantastic Archaeology"/&gt;

&lt;ref name="Plummer"/&gt;  In 1985, Hunt declined to participate in a proposed scientifically controlled test of EMPF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Frauds, Myths, and Mysteries: Science and Pseudoscience | publisher=McGraw-Hill | author=Feder, Kenneth L. | authorlink=Kenneth Feder | year=2002 | pages=256 | isbn=9780767427227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Validity==
Advocates of [[psychic]] archaeology believe that at best it possesses the power to answer questions about the lives in the past not answerable using the [[archaeological record]], and also to locating prime [[archaeological site]]s.&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt; They believe that, at worst, psychic archaeologists can locate and excavate important sites that may not be excavated without the motivation of psychic guidance.&lt;ref name="Varvoglis"/&gt; [[skepticism|Skeptics]], on the other hand, usually question the existence of psychic abilities, ascribing the occasional apparent successes of psychic archaeology to [[Informal fallacy|fallacious]] thinking on the part of practitioners and cite phenomena such as [[coincidence]], [[confirmation bias]], [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]] or outright [[Hoax|trickery]].&lt;ref name="Bad Archaeology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badarchaeology.net/method/psychic.php|title=Psychic Archaeology|accessdate=2010-10-28|publisher=Bad Archaeology|year=2008|author=Doeser, James}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptics compare psychic archaeologists to [[psychic detective]]s.

It is difficult to test psychic archaeology empirically, since archaeological discoveries are relatively abundant; anyone can predict the location of a site, using only a bit of archaeological knowledge and common sense.&lt;ref name="feder"&gt;{{citation |title= Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis to the Walam Olum |author= [[Kenneth L. Feder]] |edition= illustrated |publisher= ABC-CLIO |year= 2010 |pages= 6, 56–57, 103, 203, 221–223 |isbn= 978-0-313-37918-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same applies for finding objects inside an already identified site.&lt;ref name="feder" /&gt; Also, some sites, like the Alexandria harbor, are so rich in objects that one can dig in any random place and find at least one object.&lt;ref name="feder" /&gt; Predictions about the lifestyle of ancient civilizations can't be verified due to the lack of written records.&lt;ref name="feder" /&gt;

[[File:120512-F-UZ487-059 (7260391402).jpg|thumb|U.S. troops patrolling the walls of Qala-i-Jangi in 2008.]]

'''Qala-i-Jangi''' ([[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Dari]]/[[Pashto language|Pashto]]: {{Nastaliq|قلعهِ جنگی}}) is a 19th-century fortress located near [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] in northern [[Afghanistan]]. It is known for being the site of a bloody 2001 [[Taliban]] [[uprising]] named the [[Battle of Qala-i-Jangi]], in which at least 470 people were killed including [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent [[Johnny Micheal Spann|Johnny "Mike" Spann]]. It served as [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|Northern Alliance]] General [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]]'s military garrison during the opening stages of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)]].

==History==
The Afghans built the fort in 1889 for defense against potentially invading [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] after the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]]. It took 18,000 workers 12 years to complete it.&lt;ref name=12strong/&gt;

The Taliban occupied the fort for most of the time from 1994 to 2001. [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]], of the [[Northern Alliance]] held the fort briefly in 1997, with 20,000 militia.&lt;ref name=12strong/&gt;

&lt;ref name=12strong&gt;{{Cite book |first = Doug |last = Stanton |authorlink = Doug Stanton  |title = 12 Strong (previously published as "Horse Soldiers" |publisher = [[Pocket Books]] |date = 2018 |location = New York City |isbn = 978-1-5011-7995-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In 2001, the fort was {{convert|600|yds}} long, {{convert|300|yds}} wide. It was constructed out of wooden beams, mud and straw. At each corner a mud tower rose {{convert|80|feet}} high and {{convert|150|ft}} across. Rainfall of {{convert|4|in}} annually enabled the structure to avoid liquification.&lt;ref name=12strong/&gt;

It was a walled city, divided evenly into northern and southern courtyards by an {{convert|80|ft}} wall.&lt;ref name=12strong/&gt;

It contained a gold-domed mosque, a {{convert|75|ft}} square "Pink House," erected in the 1980s by the occupying [[Soviet Union]], as a medical facility.&lt;ref name=12strong/&gt;

'''Ramón Marrero Aristy Beltré''' (14 June 1912 &amp;ndash; 17 July 1959) was a [[Dominican people (Dominican Republic)|Dominican]] author, journalist and politician and historian.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encaribe.org/es/article/ramon-marrero-aristy/892&lt;/ref&gt; He is renowned as a writer of realist novels, especially those set around [[sugar-cane]]  which highlighted the abuse to which sugar industry workers subject.

==Early life and education==

Ramón Marrero Aristy Beltré was born in the town of [[San Rafael del Yuma]], [[La Altagracia]] Province, [[Dominican Republic]] to Juan Bautista Aristy Marrero and Olivia Beltré on the 14 June 1912. His family was quite affluent and so he spent his early years living a comfortable life in the countryside; however, due to the [[American Occupation of the Dominican Republic from 1916-1924]] he went into exile with his parents. His years in exile were spent in: [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]] and the [[Dutch Antilles]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buenastareas.com/ensayos/Ensayo-De-Over-Ram%C3%B3n-Marrero-Aristy/1216897.html&lt;/ref&gt; Finally in 1922 he returned along with his parents to the [[Dominican Republic]].

Upon their return the Aristy family were unable to once again establish themselves in their lands in the east of the country; instead they settled in the south western part of the country. Up till the year 1929 the Aristy family was lived in their south western holdings and went through rough times attempting to rebuild their destroyed fortune. Nevertheless, Ramón Marrero Aristy was able to find time for his education.

In 1928, at age 16 Marrero Aristy was a correspondent for two Dominican newspapers: 'El Diario' ([[Santiago de los Caballeros]] and 'El Nuevo Diario' ([[Santo Domingo]]) in addition to working at a [[laundry]].

The remaining part of his adolescence was spent in the Eastern town of [[La Romana Province|La Romana]] where he continued his education and worked at the Central Romana Corporation's food warehouse. While working at the warehouse he was a first-hand witness to the abuses the predominantly Haitian sugar labourers were subjected to.

He left the Central Romana's warehouse and moved to the capital, Santo Domingo where he graduated from secondary school and entered the [[University of Santo Domingo]] (now [[Autonomous University of Santo Domingo]]) pursuing a degree in [[Journalism]]. He left the university without graduating but became a frequent writer in nationwide newspapers such as: Listín Diario, El Caribe and La Nación.

==Literary career==

Three years after moving to Santo Domingo, in 1938 Marrero Aristy published his first book, Balsié. One year later, he published the novel Over&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dominicanaonline.org/bvdo/uploads/file/over/over.html&lt;/ref&gt; in which he detailed what he had witnessed while working at the Central Romana warehouse, especially how the sugar labourers were forced to over-pay for their food products (hence the title.)

==Biography==

===Early life===
Saadat Hassan Manto was born in Paproudi village of [[Samrala]], in the Ludhiana district of the Punjab in a Muslim family of barristers on 11 May 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie A. Flemming, ''Another Lonely Voice: The Urdu Short Stories of Saadat Hasan Manto'', Center for South and Southeast Asia Studies, University of California (1979), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abida Samiuddin, ''Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Urdu Literature'', Global Vision Publishing House (2007), p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a judge of a local court. He was ethnically a Kashmiri and proud of his Kashmiri roots. In a letter to [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Pandit Nehru]] he suggested that being 'beautiful' was the second meaning of being 'Kashmiri'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=254L0WM45VYC&amp;pg=PT5&amp;dq=manto+kashmiri&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1l47ItJbRAhXEjJQKHcaYASUQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=manto%20kashmiri&amp;f=false|title=Bombay Stories|last=Reeck|first=Matt|last2=Ahmad|first2=Aftab|publisher=Random House India|year=2012|isbn=9788184003611|location=|pages=|quote=He claimed allegiance not only to his native Punjab but also to his ancestors' home in Kashmir. While raised speaking Punjabi, he was also proud of the remnants of Kashmiri culture that his family maintained-food customs, as well as intermarriage with families of Kashmiri origin-and throughout his life he assigned special importance to others who had Kashmiri roots. In a tongue-in-cheek letter addressed to Pundit Jawaharlal Nehru, he went so far as to suggest that being beautiful was the second meaning of being Kashmiri|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kuY1glf2n0YC&amp;pg=PT133&amp;dq=manto+kashmiri&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1l47ItJbRAhXEjJQKHcaYASUQ6AEIRzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=manto%20kashmiri&amp;f=false|title=Our Moon Has Blood Clots: The Exodus of the Kashmiri Pandits|last=Pandita|first=Rahul|publisher=Random House India|year=2013|isbn=9788184003901|location=|pages=|quote=By virtue of his disposition, temperament, features and his spirit, Manto remains a Kashmiri Pandit.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The big turning point in his life came in 1933, at age 21, when he met Abdul Bari Alig, a scholar and polemic writer, in Amritsar. Abdul Bari Alig encouraged him to find his true talents and read Russian and French authors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pakpost.gov.pk/philately/stamps2005/saadat_manto.html Pakistan Post, 2005], Retrieved 12 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Within a matter of month Manto produced an Urdu translation of Victor Hugo's ''The Last Day of a Condemned Man'', which was published by Urdu Book Stall, Lahore as Sarguzasht-e-Aseer (A Prisoner's Story).&lt;ref name=book&gt;http://www.bookrags.com/studyguide-dogtithwal/bio.html#gsc.tab=0, Saadat Hasan Manto article on bookrags.com website, Retrieved 18 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards he joined the editorial staff of Masawat, a daily published from Ludhiana&lt;ref name=abhi&gt;http://www.abhivyakti-hindi.org/lekhak/m/manto.htm Author Profile, Profile of Saadat Hasan Manto, Retrieved 18 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

This heightened enthusiasm pushed Manto to pursue graduation at [[Aligarh Muslim University]] &lt;ref name=site&gt;https://www.amp/s/www.indiatoday.in/amp/education-today/gk-current-affairs/story/saadat-hasan-manto-best-short-story-writer-322865-2016-05-11&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; , which he joined in February 1934, and soon got associated with Indian Progressive Writers' Association (IPWA). It was here that he met writer Ali Sardar Jafri and found a new spurt in his writing. His second story, "Inqlaab Pasand", was published in Aligarh magazine in March 1935.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

Saadat Hasan Manto had accepted the job of writing for Urdu Service of All India Radio in 1941. This proved to be his most productive period as in the next eighteen months he published over four collections of radio plays, Aao (Come), Manto ke Drame (Manto's Dramas), Janaze (Funerals) and Teen Auraten (Three women). He continued to write short stories and his next short story collection Dhuan (Smoke) was soon out followed by Manto ke Afsane and his first collection of topical essays, Manto ke Mazamin. This period culminated with the publication of his mixed collection Afsane aur Dramey in 1943. Meanwhile, due to a quarrel with the director of the All India Radio, poet N. M. Rashid, he left his job and returned to Bombay in July 1942 and again started working with film industry. He entered his best phase in screenwriting giving films like Aatth Din, Shikari,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retrore.blogspot.com/2017/06/shikari.html|title=Shikari|publisher=Retrore|accessdate=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chal Chal Re Naujawan and Mirza Ghalib, which was finally released in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiaclub.com/s?defaultSearchTextValue=Search&amp;searchKeywords=Saadat+Hasan+Manto+&amp;Action=submit&amp;field_subjectbin=&amp;field_price=&amp;field_author-bin=&amp;searchRank=-product_site_launch_date&amp;searchSize=12&amp;searchPage=1&amp;searchBinNameList=subjectbin%2Cprice%2Cauthor-bin, Collection of Saadat Hasan Manto Books on India Club website, Retrieved 18 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his short stories also came from this phase including Kaali Shalwar (1941), Dhuan (1941) and Bu (1945), which was published in Qaumi Jang (Bombay) in February 1945. Another highlight of his second phase in Bombay was the publication of a collection of his stories, Chugad, which also included the story 'Babu Gopinath'.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; He stayed in Bombay until he moved to Pakistan in January 1948 after the partition of India in 1947.{{Citation needed|date= January 2018}}

=== Migration to Pakistan ===

Manto and his family were among the millions of Muslims who left present-day India for the Muslim-majority nation of Pakistan

=== Life in Lahore ===

When Manto arrived in Lahore from Bombay, he lived near and associated with several prominent intellectuals including [[Faiz Ahmad Faiz]], [[Nasir Kazmi]], [[Ahmad Rahi]] and [[Ahmad Nadeem Qasmi]].{{Citation needed|date= January 2018}} They all used to gather at Lahore's iconic [[Pak Tea House]], witness to some of the most fiery literary debates and passionate political arguments back in 1948–49. Pak Tea House holds a special place in the memories of those who know about Lahore's vibrant literary and cultural past. "There was absolutely no external influence and people would share their opinions on any subject without fear even during the military dictators' regimes."&lt;ref&gt;http://herald.dawn.com/news/1152781, Pak Tea House,19 March 2015, Herald-Dawn newspaper article, Retrieved 6 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on 18 January 1955, in an apartment located off [[Hall Road, Lahore|Hall Road]] in Lahore. His death was attributed to the effects of [[alcoholism]]. He was survived by his wife Safia and daughters Nighat, Nuzhat and Nusrat.

===Legacy===

Danish Iqbal's stage Play ''Ek Kutte Ki Kahani'' presented Manto in a new perspective on occasion of his birth centenary.

In 2015, Pakistani actor and director [[Sarmad Khoosat]] made and released a movie, ''[[Manto (2015 film)|Manto]]'', based on the life of Manto. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dawn.com/news/1205621, 'How Manto, the movie, came about', Dawn, Karachi newspaper- published 8 Sep 2015, Retrieved 19 Jan 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scipione Ammirato''' (October 7, 1531{{snd}}January 11, 1601) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[historian]].

Ammirato was born at [[Lecce]], in the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. His father, intending him for the profession of law, sent him to study at [[Naples]], but his own decided preference for literature prevented him from fulfilling his father's wishes. Entering the church, he resided for a time at [[Venice]], and afterwards engaged in the service of [[Pope Pius IV]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Ammirato, Scipione|volume=1|page=860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1569 he went to [[Florence]], where he was fortunate in securing the patronage and support of [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Duke Cosimo I]], who gave him a residence at the [[Medici]] Palace and the Villa Topaia on the understanding that he should write his ''[[Istorie Florentine]]'', the work by which he is best known. In 1595 he was made a canon of the cathedral of Florence.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17665">'''Sorelianism''' is advocacy for or support of the ideology and thinking of French revolutionary [[Syndicalism|syndicalist]] [[Georges Sorel]]. Sorelians oppose [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] [[democracy]], the developments of the 18th century, the [[secular]] spirit, and the [[French Revolution]], while supporting [[Classicism|classical]] tradition.&lt;ref name=sternhell78&gt;Sternhell et al., p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] of [[Marxism]],&lt;ref name=sternhell78/&gt; Sorel believed that the victory of the [[proletariat]] in [[Class conflict|class struggle]] could be achieved only through the power of [[myth]] and a [[general strike]].&lt;ref&gt;Sternhell et al., p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; To Sorel, the aftermath of class conflict would involve rejuvenation of both the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.&lt;ref name=christensen18/&gt; 

With the seeming failure of Syndicalism, in 1910 he announced his abandonment of [[Socialism|socialist]] literature and claimed in 1914, using an aphorism of [[Benedetto Croce]] that "socialism is dead" due to the "decomposition of Marxism".&lt;ref name=sternhell78/&gt; Sorel became a supporter of [[Maurrassisme|Maurrassian]] [[integral nationalism]] beginning in 1909, which he considered as having similar moral aims to syndicalism despite being enemies materially.&lt;ref name=sternhell78/&gt; In this sense, Sorelianism is considered to be a precursor to [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Sternhell et al., p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he became disillusioned with these ideas with the first world war, and from 1918 until his death in 1922 he would be a supporter of the then Russian revolution and Communism, which he considered a revival for Syndicalism.&lt;ref&gt;John Stanley 1981. p.20. The Sociology of Virtue: The Political &amp; Social Theories of George Sorel. https://books.google.com/books?id=aUc0z-dREk0C&amp;pg=PA21&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Concepts ==
=== General strike and syndicalist society ===
Rejecting the Marxist elevation of history as determined, Sorel considered the challenge of the new social sciences to be new moral criterion.&lt;ref&gt;John Stanley 1981. p.22. The Sociology of Virtue: The Political &amp; Social Theories of George Sorel. https://books.google.com/books?id=aUc0z-dREk0C&amp;pg=PA22&lt;/ref&gt; [[Proudhon]] had believed that a just society could only come about through action, and in particular opposition to an enemy;&lt;ref&gt;John Stanley 1981. p.14,22. The Sociology of Virtue: The Political &amp; Social Theories of George Sorel. https://books.google.com/books?id=aUc0z-dREk0C&amp;pg=PA14&lt;/ref&gt; following this line Sorel believed that [[Class conflict|class war]] between the [[proletariat]] and the [[bourgeoisie]] would result from a general strike,&lt;ref name=midlarsky93&gt;Midlarsky, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; which, together with the betterment of living conditions, he considered distinct from the mere aim of state distribution, and as the material and moral essence of Marxism and Socialism.&lt;ref&gt;John Stanley 1981. p.17. The Sociology of Virtue: The Political &amp; Social Theories of George Sorel. https://books.google.com/books?id=aUc0z-dREk0C&amp;pg=PA17&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, he had problems with Proudhon, and Sorel seems to have sought to detach it of its idealism, as Proudhon had detached justice from power play; that is, from class relations.&lt;ref&gt;John Stanley 1981. p.14. The Sociology of Virtue: The Political &amp; Social Theories of George Sorel. https://books.google.com/books?id=aUc0z-dREk0C&amp;pg=PA14&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise only minimally influencing him, in admiration of [[Nietzsche]] Sorel held that an imperialist working class would establish a new aristocracy, "organizing relations among men for the benefit of its sovereignty" and as a sole source of law.&lt;ref&gt;John Stanley 1981. p.54,244. The Sociology of Virtue: The Political &amp; Social Theories of George Sorel. https://books.google.com/books?id=aUc0z-dREk0C&amp;pg=PA244&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=midlarsky93/&gt; However, he believed that proletarian violence would strengthen the bourgeoisie,&lt;ref&gt;John Stanley 1981. p.245. The Sociology of Virtue: The Political &amp; Social Theories of George Sorel. https://books.google.com/books?id=aUc0z-dREk0C&amp;pg=PA245&lt;/ref&gt; and focused on the moral regeneration of society and the rescue of civilization rather than only the [[Working class|working-class]], considering socialism a means for revolutionary transformation of society rather than a movement of the proletariat or a movement with a specific social structure.&lt;ref name=sternhell17&gt;Sternhell, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Individualism and myth ===
Sorel believed there to be a close relation between conflict and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;John Stanley 1981. p.245. The Sociology of Virtue: The Political &amp; Social Theories of George Sorel. https://books.google.com/books?id=aUc0z-dREk0C&amp;pg=PA245&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by liberal institutions and the [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]] writings of [[William James]], Sorel denounced imitation of the military corps, extoling a warrior-individualism which he compared to the "American spirit", "animated with the spirit of liberty." He opposed the "splendid isolation" of totalitarian movements connecting all activities to party fronts.

Sorel considers the myth of the general strike a social basis for authority providing coherence to syndicalism. Against [[Nietzsche]]'s Superman he compares the general strike with the "apocalyptic myths" or "Yankee Protestantism" of the practical, individualistic American settler ready for any venture. He considered that neither the former nor the latter impinge upon the freedom of the individual.

Against the idea of centralized Imperium he espouses a [[Proudhon]]ian balance and devotion to the weak based on family love, which he believed needed to be part of the warrior ethic. Combined with an ethic of labour, it was this that would enable freedom.&lt;ref&gt;John Stanley 1981. p.245. The Sociology of Virtue: The Political &amp; Social Theories of George Sorel. https://books.google.com/books?id=aUc0z-dREk0C&amp;pg=PA245&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class conflict and class rejuvenation===
Sorel advocated the separation of groups in society, including support of the syndicalist model of a society where the proletariat workers would be autonomous and separate from bourgeois industrialists.&lt;ref name=midlarsky93/&gt; Sorel refused the idea of negotiation between the classes during the period of struggle between the proletariat against the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref name=midlarsky93/&gt; However, Sorel believed that it was the proletariat's task to awaken the bourgeoisie from intellectual stupor to recover its morality, "productive energy", and "feeling of its own dignity" that Sorel claimed had been lost because of democratic ideals.&lt;ref name=christensen18&gt;Christensen et al., p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, Sorel believed that both the end result of class conflict would in the end result in the rejuvenation of both the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.&lt;ref name=christensen18/&gt;

=== Revision of Marxism, claims of "decomposition of Marxism" by Blanquism and positivism===
Sorel focused on the ethical dimension of [[Marxism]], claiming its utility for historical analysis and a means for transforming society.&lt;ref name=sternhell17/&gt; However, Sorel criticized the deterministic, materialist, and mechanist components of Marxism.&lt;ref name=sternhell17/&gt; Sorel criticized vulgar interpretations of Marxism for being unfaithful to Marx's real intentions.&lt;ref name=sternhell17/&gt; Sorel claimed that Marx was not materialist at all, noting that Marx did not regard psychological developments of people as part of the economic process.&lt;ref name=stanley206&gt;Stanley, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; Sorel noted that Marx described the necessary ideological [[Base and superstructure|superstructure]] of societies: law, the organization of the state, religion, art, and philosophy.&lt;ref name=stanley206/&gt; As a result, Sorel claimed that "no great philosophy can be established without being based on art and on religion".&lt;ref name=stanley206/&gt;

Sorel claimed that although Marx had initially denounced [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] while supporting [[Blanquism]], that Marx later synthesized ideas from both Blanquism and Proudhonism together.&lt;ref name="John Stanley Pp. 106"&gt;John Stanley. The Sociology of Virtue: The Political &amp; Social Theories of George Sorel. Pp. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Sorel claimed that Marxism had undergone a crisis in the 1880s and the 1890s when major socialist parties were being founded in France.&lt;ref name="John Stanley Pp. 106"/&gt; Sorel viewed non-Proudhonian socialism as being wrong-headed and corrupt, as being inherently oppressive.&lt;ref name="John Stanley Pp. 106"/&gt; Sorel claimed that a "decomposition of Marxism", as referring to the major goals and themes of the ideology, was being caused by Marx's Blanquist elements and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]' [[Positivism|positivist]] elements.&lt;ref name="John Stanley Pp. 106"/&gt;

Proudhonism was in Sorel's view, more consistent with the goals of Marxism than Blanquism which had become popular in France, and Sorel claimed that Blanquism was a vulgar and rigidly deterministic corruption of Marxism.&lt;ref name="John Stanley Pp. 106"/&gt;

== Sorelianism and French integral nationalism ==
Interest in Sorelian thought arose in the French [[Right-wing politics|political right]], particularly by French [[Nationalism|nationalist]] [[Charles Maurras]] of ''[[Action Française]]'' and his supporters.&lt;ref name=sternhell82&gt;Sternhell et al., p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; While Maurras was a staunch opponent of Marxism, he was supportive of Sorelianism for its opposition to [[liberal democracy]].&lt;ref name=sternhell82/&gt; Maurras famously stated "a socialism liberated from the democratic and cosmopolitan element fits nationalism well as a well made glove fits a beautiful hand".&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1909, Sorel endorsed French integral nationalism and praised Maurras.&lt;ref name=sternhell78/&gt; Sorel was impressed by the significant numbers of "ardent youth" that enrolled in ''Action Française''.&lt;ref&gt;Sternhell et al., p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Sorel's turn to nationalism resulted in his disregarding of Marx in favour of the views of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]].&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, Sorel along with ''Action Française'' nationalists [[Édouard Berth]] and [[Georges Valois]] agreed to form a journal titled ''La Cité française'' that would promote a form of [[National socialism|national-socialism]], however this was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Sternhell et al., p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Sorel supported another nationalist newspaper, ''L'Indépendence'' and began writing anti-Semitic content claiming that France was under attack from "Jewish invaders".&lt;ref&gt;Sternhell et al., p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, on the issue of Sorelian syndicalism, Valois announced to the Fourth Congress of ''Action Française'' that "It was not a mere accident that our friends encountered the militants of syndicalism. The nationalist movement and the syndicalist movement, alien to another though they may seem, because of their present positions and orientations, have more than one common objective."&lt;ref name=sternhell82/&gt;

During his association with [[French nationalism]], Sorel joined Valois in the ''[[Cercle Proudhon]]'', an organization that Valois declared to provide "a common platform for nationalists and leftist antidemocrats".&lt;ref name=sternhell11&gt;Sternhell, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization recognized both Proudhon and Sorel as two great thinkers who had "prepared the meeting of the two French traditions that had opposed each other throughout the nineteenth century: nationalism and authentic socialism uncorrupted by democracy, represented by syndicalism".&lt;ref name=sternhell11/&gt; ''Cercle Proudhon'' announced that it supported the replacement of bourgeois ideology and [[democratic socialism]] with a new ethic of an alliance of nationalism with syndicalism, as those "two synthesizing and convergent movements, one at the extreme right and the other at the extreme left, that have begun the siege and assault on democracy".&lt;ref name=sternhell11/&gt; ''Cercle Proudhon'' supported the replacement of the liberal order with a new world that was "virile, heroic, pessimistic, and puritanical—based on the sense of duty and sacrifice: a world where the mentality of warriors and monks would prevail".&lt;ref&gt;Sternhell, pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The society would be dominated by a powerful [[avant-garde]] proletarian elite that would serve as an [[aristocracy]] of producers, and allied with intellectual youth dedicated to action against the decadent bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;Sternhell, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sorelianism and Fascism ==
Upon Sorel's death, an article in the [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist]] doctrinal review ''Gerarchia'' edited by [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Agostino Lanzillo]], a known Sorelian, declared "Perhaps fascism may have the good fortune to fulfill a mission that is the implicit aspiration of the whole oeuvre of the master of syndicalism: to tear away the proletariat from the domination of the Socialist party, to reconstitute it on the basis of spiritual liberty, and to animate it with the breath of creative violence. This would be the true revolution that would mold the forms of the Italy of tomorrow."&lt;ref&gt;Sternhell et al., p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable adherents ==
Aside from Sorel himself, there were a number of adherents of Sorelianism in the early 20th century. Sorel was a mentor to [[Hubert Lagardelle]] who, like Sorel, supported the segregation of social classes and who despised the bourgeoisie, democracy, democratic socialism, [[Parliamentary system|parliamentarism]], [[social democracy]], and [[universal suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;Hellman, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonio Gramsci]] was influenced by the Sorelian views of social [[myth]].&lt;ref&gt;Gill, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on influence from Sorel, Gramsci asserted that [[Italy]] and the [[Western world|West]] have suffered from crises of culture and authority due to the "wave of materialism" and the inability of liberalism to achieve consensus and hegemony over society.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen &amp; Arato, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Sorel influenced Greek philosopher [[Nikos Kazantzakis]] in Kazantzakis' belief of strife as being creative while viewing peace as decadent.&lt;ref&gt;Bien, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[José Carlos Mariátegui]] was a Sorelian who claimed that [[Vladimir Lenin]] was a Sorelian and Nietzschean hero.&lt;ref&gt;Schutte, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benito Mussolini]], when he was a Marxist, held various positions towards Sorelianism at times. Mussolini stated that he became a syndicalist during the [[1904 Italian general strike]]; his close contact with syndicalists dates to 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Sternhell et al., p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini reviewed Sorel's ''Reflections on Violence'' in 1909 and supported Sorel's view of consciousness as being a part of protracted struggle, where people display uplifting and self-sacrificing virtues akin to the heroes of antiquity.&lt;ref name=gregor96&gt;Gregor, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini also supported the Sorelian view of the necessity of violence in revolution.&lt;ref name=gregor96/&gt; He followed Sorel in denouncing [[humanitarianism]] and compromise between [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialists]] and [[Reformism|reformist]] socialists and bourgeois [[Democracy|democrats]].&lt;ref name=gregor96/&gt; By 1909, Mussolini supported elitism and anti-parliamentarism, and became a propagandist for the use of "regenerative violence".&lt;ref name=gregor96/&gt; When Sorelians initially began to come close to identifying themselves with nationalism and [[monarchism]] in 1911, Mussolini believed that such association would destroy their credibility as socialists.&lt;ref&gt;Gregor, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''State collapse''', '''breakdown''', or '''downfall''' is the complete failure of a mode of [[government]] within a [[sovereign state]]. Sometimes this brings about a [[failed state]], as in Somalia and the [[Yugoslav Wars|final decade]] of [[Yugoslavia]].  More often, there is an immediate process of transition to a new administration, and basic services such as tax collection, defence, police, civil service, and courts are maintained throughout, as in [[South Africa]] following the failure of the [[Apartheid|apartheid system]].

State collapse may coincide with [[economic collapse]].  State collapse is not always synonymous with [[societal collapse]], which often is a more prolonged process, as in the fall of the western Roman Empire. 

Not all attempts at [[regime change]] succeed in bringing about state collapse.  The 16th-century [[Babington plot]] to assassinate [[Queen Elizabeth I]] of England, the 19th-century [[Decembrist revolt]] in Russia, and the 20th-century [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] of Cuba failed.

==History of the concept==
For [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC), the inherent dangers of democracy were, first, that conflict between the aristocracy and the poor was inevitable; and second, that it would usher in "mischief and corruption". Both processes would lead to collapse unless independent controls and [[separation of powers]] were enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Przebowski, ''The Rise and Fall of the United States'', Ex Libris Corporation, 2009, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greek philosopher [[Polybius]] (c.200 – c.118 BC) asserted that all nations follow a cycle of; democracy, oligarchy, dictatorship, tyranny and collapse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Przebowski]], ''The rise and fall of the United States, ExLibris Corporation'', 2009, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic scholar [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332 – 1406) also produced a general theory of state collapse. A "theological rationalist", he transformed the study of history into a "new science".&lt;ref&gt;[[J.J. Saunders]], review of 'Ibn Khaldun's Philosophy of History' by [[Muhsin Mahdi]], [[History and Theory]] vol 5, no 3, (1966), pp. 322-347.&lt;/ref&gt; In his eyes, dynasties repeatedly become "sedentary, senile, coercive, pompous, subservient to desire ... liable to divisions in the dynasty." Group feeling ([[asabiyyah]], [[groupthink]]) disappears as the dynasty grows senile. Ibn Khaldun was fatalistic; "This senility is a chronic disease which cannot be cured because it is something natural".&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun, ''[[The Muqaddimah]]'' Routledge, 1978, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that dynasties last for three generations before a new invading clique, "restless, alert and courageous", will cause the old to collapse &lt;ref&gt;''The [[Muqaddimah]]'', Routledge, 1978, pp. 244-255.&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance with the principle in the [[Book of Exodus]], chapter 20, verse four: God "visits the sins of the fathers onto their children, even unto the third and fourth generation of those that hate Him". Professor [[Geoff Mulgan]] discusses Ibn Khaldun in detail and agrees on the timescale: "There are obvious parallels between the lifespans of individuals and those of ruling groups."&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Mulgan, ''Good and bad power'', Penguin, 2007, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J.J. Saunders]],&lt;ref&gt;[[J.J. Saunders]], review of 'Ibn Khaldun's Philosophy of History' by [[Muhsin Mahdi]], "[[History and Theory]]" vol 5, no 3, (1966), pp. 322-347.&lt;/ref&gt; claiming in 1966 that "our age, like his, is one of misery", regrets that Ibn Khaldun had "no predecessors and no successors ... not until four centuries after his death did he rise from his long sleep." In 1868 French Arabists translated the Muqaddimah; "the world was amazed, but he remained a lonely pioneer without followers ... the world has yet to prove that history can exist independently of the theological setting that gives it meaning".&lt;ref&gt;ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese philosopher [[Hajime Tanabe]] points to the quasi-religious role of the state to mediate between mortal individuals and the eternal universe, so that states regularly collapse; like religious figures, they must undergo a process of death and [[resurrection]]. In his view this may account for the perennial popularity of states because they regularly demonstrate their ability to transcend death.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Mcgreal, ''Great Thinkers of the Eastern World'', Harper Collins, 1995, p, 388.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to psychologist [[Erich Fromm]] it is possible for an entire nation, if they all share the same vices and errors, to become insane—a ''"folie a millions"''. Inhuman treatment by the rulers inevitably leads to collapse; &lt;blockquote&gt; Despots and ruling cliques can succeed in dominating and exploiting their fellow man ... but their subjects react ... with apathy, impairment of intelligence, initiative and skills ... or they react by the accumulation of such hate and destructiveness as to bring about an end to themselves, their rulers and their system. ... if man lives under conditions contrary to his nature and to human growth and sanity, he cannot help reacting.'&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm, ''The Sane Society'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1979, pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Mark Blyth]] alleges that a democracy can also collapse "if voters don't get what they want and merely affirm the status quo." In these circumstances, voters deprived of real choice may opt for the least democratic option.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Blyth]], "When Does Democracy Fail?", ''[[Washington Post]]'', 15 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marina Ottaway]]&lt;ref&gt;Marina Ottaway, "Rebuilding State Institutions in Collapsed States", ''[[Development and Change]]'', 33 (5), 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the collapse of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1918, [[British India]] in 1947, [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the collapse of [[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|South Africa's white supremacist government]] in 1993, of [[Czechoslovakia]] the following year, and of [[Yugoslavia]]. [[Harold Perkin]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Perkin]], "The Rise and Fall of Empires", ''[[History Today]]'', 4 April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; sees "an acceleration of the process of collapse ... the [20th century] saw the collapse of seven great empires: [[Imperial China]], Germany, Austria-Hungary, [[Ottoman Turkey]], the [[Japanese empire]], the British Empire, and Russia, twice". Furthermore, the 20th Century saw the collapse of the French and Portuguese Empires.

[[John Kenneth Galbraith]] regrets the "very slight" amount of research on political power in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenneth Galbraith]], ''The Anatomy of Power'', Hamish Hamilton, 1984, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Power regularly passes to those who "assert the unknown with the greatest conviction... not necessarily related to intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenneth Galbraith]], ''The Anatomy of Power'', Hamish Hamilton, 1984, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  What we call "power" is, "in practice, the illusion of power."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenneth Galbraith]], ''The Anatomy of Power'', Hamish Hamilton, 1984, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing how the "powerless" [[Mahatma Gandhi]] brought about the collapse of militarily "powerful" [[British India]], Galbraith reflects that power, mostly seen as a possession of states and their leaders, would be better viewed as a flow, into and away from "those instruments that enforce it".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenneth Galbraith]], ''The Anatomy of Power'', Hamish Hamilton, 1984, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Few political scientists credibly predicted the collapse of the Soviet Union or agreed on its causes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joshua S Goldstein]] and Jon C Pevehouse, ''International Relations'', Longman, 2007, p. 43; Richard K Hermann, ''Ending the Cold War'', Palgrave, 2004, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  No one predicted the [[Arab spring]].&lt;ref&gt;Chris Doyle, "The Arab Spring Didn't Fail", ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 17 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Though many writings study particular cases of state collapse in isolation,&lt;ref&gt;See [[William Shirer]], ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', Mandarin, 1960; [[Edward Crankshaw]], ''Fall of the House of Habsburg'', Cardinal, 1970; [[Dmitri Volkogonov]], ''The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire'', Harper Collins, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; there appears to be no contemporary text which compares events on a global historical basis and identifies common features.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Ludger Helms, ''Comparative Political Leadership'', Palgrave, 2012, which contains many references to present-day western leaders, but only passing or no mentions of Hitler, Saddam, Mussolini, South Africa, Iraq, Yugoslavia.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Wight]], like Saunders, deplored the "demonic concentrations of power" of the defeated countries in the two world wars. A devout Christian, he saw their "triumphant self-destruction" as "Antichrist moments".&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hall, ''The International Thought of Martin Wight'', Palgrave, 2006, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; He disliked the modern secular tendency to view politics as a succession of questions (the [[Eastern question]], the [[two-state solution]]) with "solutions" which are devoid of moral content,&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hall, ''The International Thought of Martin Wight'', Palgrave, 2006, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; because &lt;blockquote&gt; The members of international society are, on the whole, immortals. States do die or disappear occasionally, but mostly they outlive the span of human life. They are partnerships of the living with posterity ... A society of immortals will be looser than one of mortals ... there are moral difficulties about indicting a whole nation, because (to do so) would make the passive majority suffer for the acts of the criminal minority, and future generations for the sins of the fathers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Wight]], ''[[Power Politics (Wight book)|Power Politics]]'', Pelican, 1978, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding the idea of a state being immortal, the [[nation]] called [[Russia]] has survived the collapse of two different political systems:  [[Imperial Russia]], a monarchy, in 1917; and the [[Soviet Union]], a communist totalitarianism, in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dmitri Volkogonov]], ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire]]'', Harper Collins, 1998, chapters one and seven.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, though Germany, ruled by the [[Nazi Party]], was defeated in 1945 and the nation, Germany, was dismembered, it was [[German reunification|resurrected in 1990]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hall, quoting Martin Wight, ''The International thought of Martin Wight'', Palgrave, 2006, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Examples of state collapse through [[civil war]] include: the [[War of the Roses]] in 15th-century England; the [[Thirty years war]] (1618–48); the [[Irish Civil War]] (1916-22); the [[Chinese Communist Revolution]] (1949); and the [[Cuban Revolution]] (1958).  State collapses through revolutions, not featuring civil war, took place in [[Xinhai Revolution|Imperial China]] (1911), in [[Russian Empire|Russia]] (1917), and in [[Iranian Revolution|Iran]] (1979). Collapse through ''[[Coup d'etat|Coups d'etat]]'' occurred in [[History of the Republic of Egypt|Egypt]] (1952), in [[Iraqi Republic (1958–68)|Iraq]] (1958), and in [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]] (1969). Negotiated surrenders of power took place in the [[English Commonwealth]] (1660); and in the collapse of the Soviet Union (1991), when it fragmented into fifteen independent states.

Mediaeval England was the scene of several violent dynastic collapses:  the fall of the West Saxon kings, when [[William the Conqueror]] defeated [[Harold Godwinson]] in 1066;&lt;ref&gt;''Chambers Dictionary of World History'', Editor Hilary Marsden, Chambers Harrap, 2005, p 382-3&lt;/ref&gt; the [[civil war]] known as [[The Anarchy]] from 1139-1153 between [[Stephen]] and [[Empress Matilda]], a time when 'Christ and his saints were asleep', which ended the Norman line of kings;&lt;ref&gt;Jim Bradbury, ''[[Stephen and Matilda: the Civil War of 1139-53]]'', Stroud, 2009, p 215&lt;/ref&gt; the reign of the last [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin]], [[John, King of England]], known as 'Lackland' for his military incompetence in losing Anjou;&lt;ref&gt;Chambers Dictionary of World History, Editor Hilary Marsden, Chambers Harrap, 2005, p 36&lt;/ref&gt; the [[tyranny]] of the last [[Plantagenet]] monarch, [[Richard II]], who was defeated by Henry, duke of Lancaster, later [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]];&lt;ref&gt;Chambers Dictionary of World History, Editor Hilary Marsden, Chambers Harrap, 2005, p 696&lt;/ref&gt; the destruction of the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] dynasty during the [[Wars of the Roses]], and especially at the [[battle of Tewkesbury]] in 1471;&lt;ref&gt;''Chambers Dictionary of World History'', Editor Hilary Marsden, Chambers Harrap, 2005, p 498, 875&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[battle of Bosworth]], which saw the end of [[Richard III]] and the [[Yorkist]] line &lt;ref&gt;''Chambers Dictionary of World History'', Editor Hilary Marsden, Chambers Harrap, 2005, p 115, 966&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1850-1864) was a civil war in [[China]] between the established [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-led [[Qing dynasty]] and the Christian [[millenarian]] movement of the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom|Heavenly Kingdom of Peace]]. It was the second-worst conflict in history; 20-30 millions died over 15 years. In 1858-60 the [[Qing dynasty]] effectively collapsed as France and the UK invaded and imposed [[unequal treaties]]. In 1864 the Taiping regime also collapsed and the dynasty was reshaped in the [[Tongzhi Restoration]].

The [[partition of India]] in 1947 led to the creation of two independent nations, India and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Partition (n), 7. b |publisher=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=3rd |year=2005 |quote=The division of British India into India and Pakistan, achieved in 1947.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The partition displaced between 10 and 12 million Sikhs, Hindus and Moslems, creating overwhelming refugee crises; there was large-scale violence, with estimates of loss of life accompanying or preceding the partition disputed and varying between several hundred thousand and two million.{{sfn|Talbot|Singh|2009|p=2}}{{efn|"The death toll remains disputed with figures ranging from 200,000 to 2 million."{{sfn|Talbot|Singh|2009|p=2}}}}{{full citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Failed attempts at reform in the Soviet Union, a standstill economy, and defeat in the [[Soviet–Afghan War|war in Afghanistan]] led to a general feeling of discontent, especially in the [[Baltic states|Baltic republics]] and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;WorldBook online&lt;/ref&gt; Greater political and social freedoms, instituted by the last Soviet leader, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policies of [[Glasnost]] and [[Perestroika]] encouraged open criticism of the [[Communist state|communist regime]]. The dramatic drop of the [[1980s oil glut|price of oil in 1985 and 1986]] profoundly influenced actions of the Soviet leadership.&lt;ref name='AEI-Gaidar-Grain and Oil'&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaidar |first=Yegor |authorlink=Yegor Gaidar |title=The Soviet Collapse: Grain and Oil |work=On the Issues: AEI online |publisher=American Enterprise Institute |date=****-**-** |url=http://www.aei.org/issue/25991 |accessdate=2009-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722091512/http://www.aei.org/issue/25991 |archivedate=22 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }} (Edited version of a speech given November **, **** at the American Enterprise Institute.)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Reagan]] administration in the 1980s placed [[Pershing II]] missiles in western Europe in order to escalate the [[Cold War]], overstretch the USSR economy and bring about its downfall because 'they can't sustain military spending the way we can'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dmitri Volkogonov]], The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire, Harper Collins, 1997, p488&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union finally collapsed in 1991 when [[Boris Yeltsin]] seized power in the aftermath of a [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|failed coup]] that had attempted to topple Gorbachev. Soviet nuclear weapons were all reassigned to Russia; {{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] collapsed in the 1990s, when its six socialist republics broke apart to become separate countries; though [[Slovenia]] seceded peacefully, civil wars broke out in [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia]] and [[Kosovo]], then part of [[Serbia]]. [[Ethnic cleansing]] and [[genocide]] erupted, including the [[Srebrenica massacre]] and [[Bosnian genocide]].

The apartheid system in [[South Africa]] ended through [[negotiation]]s between the governing [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], the [[African National Congress]], and other political organizations, resulting in South Africa's first non-racial [[South African general election, 1994|election]], which was won by the [[African National Congress]].
Concerns were raised about the future of its nuclear weapons but they were dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Sampson]], ''Mandela'', QPD, 1999, p 468&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential for instability==
In a [[totalitarian]] state or an [[ideocracy]], individuals may develop a [[closed mind]] and an [[authoritarian personality]], making them more likely to resist threats to the incumbent regime.&lt;ref&gt;Piekalkiewicz and Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'', SUNY Press, 1995, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Alter]], "The Masada complex", ''[[Commentary magazine]]'', 1 July 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerrold M. Post]], editor, ''The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders'', University of Michigan Press, 2003, p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; speak of a "[[Masada]] complex" that may drive fanatics to a suicidal, violent last-ditch stand. Former [[British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] has commented that  "History teaches that dangers are never greater than when empires break up."&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Thatcher]], ''The Downing Street Years'', Harper Collins, 1993, p. 769.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new regime gains power, not through the truth of its doctrines and promises, but through its ability to organize and absorb the frustrated masses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 2010, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; As Pope Francis warned in 2017, "in times of crisis, we lack judgement".&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Osborne]], ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'', 22 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The timidity of the old regime contrasts with the boldness of those in rebellion against it;  "Where power is not joined with faith in the future, it is used mainly to ward off the new and preserve the status quo. On the other hand, extravagant hope, even when not backed by actual power, is likely to generate reckless daring."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 2010, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; "The frustrated see in a general downfall an approach to the brotherhood of all. Chaos, like the grave, is a haven of equality."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 2010, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to political scientists, in an [[ideocracy]] there must be a ruthless charismatic leader: "the leader is the movement",&lt;ref&gt;Piekalkiewicz and Penn, ''Politics of Ideocracy'', State University of New York, 1995, p133&lt;/ref&gt; and all individuals are required to submit to, and worship him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich Fromm]], ''The Sane Society'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1955, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; "Followers who lead barren, insecure, frustrated lives obey the leader, not through faith in his vision of a '[[Promised land]]', but because he leads them away from their unwanted selves".&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hoffer, ''The True Believer'', Harper Perennial 2010, p 100, 119&lt;/ref&gt; When collapse threatens he may insist on a "fight to the finish".

Hitler, according to [[Walter Langer]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Mind of Adolf Hitler]]'', Pan, 1972, p 33, 55&lt;/ref&gt; had a [[Messiah complex]] and saw himself as the "Saviour of Germany" who performed "miracles" with the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Haffner, The Meaning of Hitler, Phoenix 2002, p 27-30&lt;/ref&gt; He was unnaturally fond of his mother, to the extent that Germany became a "mother symbol".&lt;ref&gt;Walter Langer, ''[[The Mind of Adolf Hitler]]'', Pan 1972, p 155.&lt;/ref&gt; His drive to destroy (the Jews, communism, Europe) was an unconscious attempt to resolve his [[Oedipus complex]] and the injustices of his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Langer, ''[[The Mind of Adolf Hitler]]'', Pan 1972, p 157&lt;/ref&gt; He "dismantled the German state ... and replaced it with a war machine".&lt;ref&gt;[[Sebastian Haffner]], ''[[The Meaning of Hitler]]'', Pelican 2002, p. 40, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; He was swept along by a tide of events.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hall, ''The international thought of Martin Wight'', Palgrave 2006, p 47&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mussolini]], according to [[Denis Mack Smith]], "was an actor, playing the part that Italians wanted him to be".&lt;ref&gt;''Mussolini'', Phoenix, 1993, p112-15&lt;/ref&gt; He was vindictive, sadistic, impulsive, proud and cruel, full of "demonic wilfulness" and did not know right from wrong. When in 1944 he led a [[puppet state]] in northern Italy, he "divided Italy in two and initiated 18 months of terrible civil war."&lt;ref&gt;Denis Mack Smith, ''Mussolini'', Phoenix 1993, p 300&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Livingstone]] has compared [[Slobodan Milosevic]] to Hitler for his racism and expansionist goals.&lt;ref&gt;'Why we are not wrong to compare Milosevic to Hitler', ''Independent'', 20/4/1999&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saddam Hussein]], who also suffered from a Messiah complex,&lt;ref&gt;Jerrold M Post, ''The psychological assessment of political leaders'', University of Michigan Press, 2003, p 354&lt;/ref&gt; was similar: "Hitler was not one of a kind. As long as millions of people passionately long for his return, it is only a matter of time until their wish is fulfilled."&lt;ref&gt;Hans Enzensburger, "Perspective on Saddam Hussein", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 14 February 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] "went mad" as early as 1971 according to [[John Sweeney (journalist)|John Sweeney]], when, "blind to his own Messianism", he attempted to recreate [[North Korea]]n [[totalitarianism]] in [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;John Sweeney, ''The life and evil times of Nicolae Ceausescu'', Hutchinson, 1991, p99&lt;/ref&gt; He "played the king" and the role of "chosen one" and "saviour".&lt;ref&gt;John Sweeney, ''The life and evil times of Nicolae Ceausescu'', Hutchinson, 1991, p155&lt;/ref&gt; [[Czar Nicholas II]] by contrast was deferential. Acceding at an early age, 26, he was untrained in governance.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Van der Kiste]], ''The Romanovs'', Sutton, 1998, p154&lt;/ref&gt; Grand Duke Vladimir's son Cyril was a rival candidate for the throne.&lt;ref&gt;John Van der Kiste, ''The Romanovs'', Sutton, 1998, p 175&lt;/ref&gt; Liberals and revolutionaries challenged his autocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, ''The Romanovs'', Sutton, 1998, p 176&lt;/ref&gt; By 1916 he had become apathetic, dominated by the Czarina and [[Rasputin]],&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, ''The Romanovs'', Sutton, 1998, p 187&lt;/ref&gt; a "Christ in the image of the rejected and agonizing monarchy".&lt;ref&gt;[[Leon Trotsky]], ''The history of the Russian Revolution'', translated  by Max Eastman, Pluto Press 1977, p 84&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the USSR, a Marxist [[Revolutionary wave]] had formed in which several subordinate regimes in Eastern Europe and Africa collapsed almost simultaneously with the central power.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Katz, ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves'', St martin's Press, 1997, pp 83-87&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] saw the USSR as "on the way to civil war" and tried to conciliate both reformers and hardliners.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steve Rosenberg]], [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38289333 BBC online interview with Gorbachev], 2016-12-13&lt;/ref&gt; He and [[F.W. De Klerk]] in South Africa focused on acknowledging and managing decline, rather than "heroically" attempting to deny it. They have enjoyed better reputations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mary|last=Dejevsky|title=Two new faces of democracy; both Gorbachev and de Klerk tried to dismantle untenable regimes|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/two-new-faces-of-democracy-both-gorbachev-and-de-klerk-tried-to-dismantle-untenable-regimes-history-1434677.html|work=Independent|date=1994-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in China, Gorbachev is seen as a dismal failure who capitulated to the West.&lt;ref&gt;James Palmer, 'What China didn't learn from the collapse of the Soviet Union, Foreign Policy, 2016-12-24&lt;/ref&gt;

Collapse is often preceded externally by war, and internally by overpopulation and repression.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun, ''The Muqaddimah'' Routledge 1978, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[Paul Kennedy]] points out, 'Nations in decline instinctively spend more on "security" and thus compound their long-term dilemma.'&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The rise and fall of the Great Powers'', 1985, p. 486.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of a revolution the crisis is reached when 'the old regime is no longer able to mobilise force'.&lt;ref&gt;Crane Brinton, ''The Anatomy of Revolution'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regeneration===
Either the incumbent regime itself, or an extremist [[reactionary]] group dissatisfied with its performance, may attempt to postpone or avoid collapse by regenerating popular support; 'At the end of a dynasty there often appears some show of power giving the impression that the dynasty's senility has been made to disappear. It lights up brilliantly just before it is extinguished, like a candle which leaps up brilliantly just before it is put out.' &lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun, ''The Muqaddimah'', Routledge 1978, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
To do so they may have to take 'heroic' measures; 'Throughout history there have always been in the event of defeat two paths of action; the one aims at saving enough of the substance as possible. the other at leaving behind a stirring legend.'&lt;ref&gt;Sebastain Haffner, ''The meaning of Hitler'', Pelican, 2000, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Piekalkiewicz and Penn, they may rethink or adapt the ideology, or replace it by a completely new set of ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Piekalkiewicz and Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'', SUNY Press, 1995, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Poland, according to Piekalkiewicz and Penn, communist ideocracy failed in 1980; the recognition of [[Lech Walesa]]'s [[Solidarity]] Trade Union led to a military coup and authoritarian military rule.

According to [[Sabrina Ramet]], regenerative changes occurred in Yugoslavia in the 1980s when the communist ideology was replaced by a nationalist drive for a [[Greater Serbia]] and by an [[anti-bureaucratic revolution]] in support of [[Slobodan Milosevic]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Sabrina Ramet]], ''The three Yugoslavias'', Indiana UP, 2006, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Young Turk]] coup of 1908,&lt;ref&gt;Tony Barber, 'Decline and Fall', review of ''Shattering Empires'' by Michael Reynolds, ''Financial Times'', 4/4/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[1991 Soviet coup d'etat attempt]],&lt;ref&gt;Dmitri Volkogonov, ''The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire'', Harper Collins, 1997, pp. 485-7.&lt;/ref&gt; and the financial/industrial reforms of [[Sergei Witte]] in Imperial Russia,&lt;ref&gt;Tony Barber, 'Decline and Fall', review of ''Tales of Imperial Russia'' by [[Francis Wcislo]] (sic), ''Financial Times'', 4/4/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; were all aimed at regenerating causes which were nearing collapse.

===Crisis point===

When collapse - whether through civil war, revolution, [[coup d'état]], or military defeat and/or invasion - becomes unavoidable and immediate, law and order may break down. There may be [[Ethnic cleansing]] or [[Genocide]]. Hitler ordered the killing of invalids, Gypsies, Russians and Jews in the [[Final solution]].&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Haffner, ''The Meaning of Hitler'', Pelican 2002, chapter on 'Crimes'&lt;/ref&gt; In Ottoman Turkey, estimates for the death toll in the [[Armenian genocide]] vary between 300,000 and 1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Barber, 'Decline and Fall', Financial Times, 4/4/2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Pacific theatre of [[World War II]], [[Occupation of Japan|Japan's collapse]] was hastened by nuclear destruction of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]].
 
When [[Ottoman Turkey]] collapsed at the end of [[World War I]], it lost territory, including what became [[Syria]], [[Iraq]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]; the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire gave rise to [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]] and the Austrian Republic, while [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] became part of Yugoslavia]]. Nazi Germany in 1945 fragmented into East and West Germany, while [[Pomerania]] and [[Silesia]] became part of Poland

===Post-collapse===

In 1946, the Diet ratified a new [[Constitution of Japan]]&lt;ref&gt;Takemae, Eiji 2002, p. xxxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; The new constitution drafted by Americans allowed access and control over the Japanese military through MacArthur and the Allied occupation on Japan.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed:1945 to the Present|last=Hunt|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780199371020|location=|pages=86|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The political project drew much of its inspiration from the [[US Bill of Rights|U.S. Bill of Rights]], [[New Deal]] social legislation, the [[liberal constitution]]s of several European states and even the Soviet Union."&lt;ref&gt;Takemae, Eiji 2002, p. xxxix.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recovery from collapse is often improved by formal or informal efforts at justice, such as the [[Nuremberg trials]] and the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)]]. [[Slobodan Milosevic]] and [[Saddam Hussein]] were also tried in court, but [[Mussolini]] and [[Colonel Gaddafi]] were murdered by mobs.

The collapse of the Ottomans in 1918 had long-term consequences, 'triggering most of the problems that plague the Middle East today.' &lt;ref&gt;[[Ali A. Allawi]], 'The Ottoman Empire: the last great casualty of the first world war', [[The Spectator]], 2/5/2015&lt;/ref&gt; Hegemony in the Middle East has been subject to quarrels between British, French,&lt;ref&gt;[[Avi Shlaim]], 'The Balfour Declaration: A Study in British Duplicity', [[Middle East Eye]], 25/8/2017&lt;/ref&gt; Zionist,&lt;ref&gt;[[Israel Shahak]], 'Greater Israel: the Zionist Plan for the Middle East', [[Global Research Council|Global Research]], November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; American,&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Green, 'Why Western Democracy can never work in the Middle East', [[The Daily Telegraph]],16/8/2014&lt;/ref&gt; Arab nationalist,&lt;ref&gt;[[Adeed Dawisha]], 'Requiem for Arab Nationalism', [[Middle East Quarterly]], Winter 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi and Iranian interests &lt;ref&gt;Syed Mansur Hashim, 'Who will rule the Middle East?', The Daily Star, 12/1/2016&lt;/ref&gt; ever since.

Hitler, says [[Sebastian Haffner]], 'whether we like it or not', created many features of the postwar world, including the state of Israel, the end of European empires, the division of Germany, and the joint hegemony of the US and USSR.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Haffner, The Meaning of Hitler, Phoenix, 2000, p 100&lt;/ref&gt;

==States allegedly at risk of collapse==

Paul Stares and Helia Aghani suggest that [[Saudi Arabia]] could lapse into a succession crisis and civil war if [[Mohammed bin Salman]]'s accession is contested after the death of his aging father, [[king Salman]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Stares and Helia Aghani, "How Stable is Saudi Arabia?", [[Council on Foreign Relations]], 15 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]] could collapse following the influx of refugees from [[Syria]] and the resultant burden on infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Azeem Ibrahim]], 'Lebanon and Jordan may collapse under a new wave of refugees', [[Al Arabiya English]], 2016-06-26&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Colonel Gaddafi]] of Libya agreed to dismantle his nuclear and chemical weapons programme. In 2011 he was deposed and murdered. This is the reason, according to [[Forbes magazine]], for North Korea to seek to guarantee its security and invulnerability through continuing its nuclear weapons programme.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kaplan and Rodger Baker, 'Why North Korea needs nukes', Forbes, 2013-12-04&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Embury-Dennis claims that [[North Korea]] could collapse "within a year" as new US sanctions take effect.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Embury-Dennis, "North Korea Could Collapse within a Year", ''[[The Independent]]'', 17 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Venezuela]], protests and riots against the authoritarian rule of [[Nicolas Maduro]] have steadily increased since 2014, while the economy and social infrastructure have worsened.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Gillespie et al, 'Venezuela; how a rich country collapsed'. CNN, July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emmanuel Todd]], one of the first to predict the fall of the USSR, now predicts the collapse of the US in his book ''[[After the Empire: The Breakdown of the American Order]]''. According to Iranian general Reza Naqdi, the US will collapse by 2035 and the Trump presidency is hastening that process.&lt;ref&gt;anon, 'Israel will collapse within ten years', Israel Today, 2016-11-29&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret McMillan]] has compared [[President Trump]] to [[Mussolini]], on the grounds that President Trump similarly seeks attention, makes grand gestures, plays the 'strong man' and seeks out enemies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Olivia Gordon]], quoting [[Margaret McMillan]] in 'Trump is no Hitler - he's a Mussolini', [[Oxford Today]], 2017-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nigel Lawson]] predicts that the [[European Union]] will become a federal superstate;&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Lawson, '[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/02/the-eu-exists-only-to-become-a-superstate-britain-has-no-place-i/ The EU exists only to become a superstate]', Telegraph, 2016-05-02&lt;/ref&gt; also likely to collapse, according to the Polish president, [[Andrzej Duda]],&lt;ref&gt;James Shorter, '[https://www.ft.com/content/d18b8b56-9240-11e7-bdfa-eda243196c2c Polish president warns multispeed EU will collapse]', Financial Times, 2017-09-05&lt;/ref&gt; journalist [[Stephen Pollard]],&lt;ref&gt;'the EU will collapse within ten years', The Express, 2017-09-23&lt;/ref&gt; German economist [[Thorsten Polleit]],&lt;ref&gt;Nick Gutteridge, 'German economist predicts EU will collapse', Express, 2017-08-25&lt;/ref&gt; and a leaked German Government contingency plan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nick Mason]], '[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/06/the-germans-are-making-contingency-plans-for-the-collapse-of-europe-lets-hope-we-are-too The Germans are making contingency plans for the collapse of Europe. Let's hope we are too.]' [[The Guardian]], 2017-11-06&lt;/ref&gt;

S Daniel Abraham anticipates the collapse of [[Israel]], where Palestinians will soon outnumber Jews, if the [[History of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Palestinian problem]] is not resolved;&lt;ref&gt;S Daniel Abraham, 'How Israel will be destroyed without one shot being fired', [[Haaretz]], 2013-01-16&lt;/ref&gt; Iqbal Jassat compares the situation  to [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Iqbal Jassat, 'Israel faces inevitable collapse of its apartheid system', Middle East Monitor 2017-03-27&lt;/ref&gt; A secret CIA report sees the end of Israel by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan Jones, ''Israel today'', 'CIA sees end of Israel by 2022', 1st July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Pakistan]], Islamic militants are allegedly infiltrating the military and nuclear weapons systems. There are fears of collapse into nuclear war with India, or of chaos enabling extremists to seize [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Leigh (journalist)|David Leigh]], "Wikileaks Cables Expose Pakistan Nuclear Fears", [[The Guardian]], 30 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon G. Chang]], in editions of ''[[The Coming Collapse of China]]'', has made several predictions of collapse, none of which have materialised. [[Bruce Gilley]] sees a largely peaceful process unfolding.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Gilley]], ''China's Democratic Future'', Columbia University Press, 2004, chapter six: "The democratic breakthrough, extrication or overthrow?".&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Shambaugh]] says China must either liberalise to become a developed economy–as Taiwan and South Korea have–or else remain authoritarian and endure a stagnating economy.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Johnson , "Q and A David Shambaugh",  ''[[The New York Times]]'', 30 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; "We cannot predict when Chinese communism will collapse, but it is hard not to conclude that we are seeing its final phases."&lt;ref&gt;Xie Tao, quoting Shambaugh in "Why Do People Keep Predicting China's Collapse?', ''[[The Diplomat]]'', March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Katz&lt;ref&gt;Mark Katz, ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves'', St Martin's Press, 1997, p107-112&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the [[Islamic fundamentalist]] [[revolutionary wave]] led by [[Iran]] could collapse, but "must first expand significantly" and then experience a "crisis of confidence".

[[Geoff Mulgan]]&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Mulgan, ''Good and Bad Power'', Penguin 2007, p321&lt;/ref&gt; has called for; "new structures of [[government]] above the nation-state... this task is essential for Human survival".

==In popular culture==
There are many semi-fictional books and films, which dramatically demonstrate the turbulent effects of collapse upon innocent or naive individuals. [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s film, ''[[The Last Emperor]]'', showed the collapse of both Imperial China and [[Manchukuo]], as well as the post-collapse trial and rehabilitation of [[Pu Yi]]. [[Bruno Ganz]] played Hitler in ''[[Downfall (2004 film)|Downfall]]'', which depicts the final days of Germany's [[Third Reich]]. Events from the period,
as seen by prisoners at [[Auschwitz]], are shown in [[Primo Levi]]'s memoir, ''[[If This Is a Man]]'', and in the [[graphic novel]]s ''[[Maus]]'' and ''[[Maus II]]''. [[Kurt Vonnegut]] witnessed the [[bombing of Dresden]] and fictionalized the experience in ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]''.

[[Robert K. Massie]]'s book about the last Russian tsar, ''[[Nicholas and Alexandra]]'', was also filmed. ''[[Doctor Zhivago]]'' and ''[[And Quiet Flows the Don]]'' (filmed as ''War and Revolution'') relate stories of families caught up in the collapse of [[Russia]].  ''[[The House of the Mosque]]'' and ''[[Persepolis (comics)|Persepolis]]'' depict the collapse of [[Iran]].

The ''[[Left Behind]]'' series of novels by ''[[Tim LaHaye]]'' and ''[[Jerry B. Jenkins]]'' features the supposed role of [[Israel]] in the [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[End Times]]. In the spy novel, ''[[The Mask of Dimitrios (novel)|The Mask of Dimitrios]]'' (1939), [[Eric Ambler]] comments:  "In a dying civilization, political prestige goes not to the man with the shrewdest diagnosis, but to the one with the best bedside manner."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="136429">The '''timeline of the Kingdom of Jerusalem''' presents important events of the history of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]{{mdash}}a [[crusader state]]  in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]{{mdash}}in chronological order. The kingdom was established during the [[First Crusade]]. Its first ruler, [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], was not crowned king and swore fealty to the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Dagobert of Pisa|Daimbert]] in 1099. Godfrey's brother and successor, [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]], who did not acknowledge the patriarchs' sovereignty, was crowned the first [[king of Jerusalem]] in 1100. Baldwin I and his successors captured all towns on the coast with the support of [[Republic of Pisa|Pisan]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] fleets and also took control of the caravan routes between Egypt and Syria. The kings regularly administered other crusader states{{mdash}}the [[County of Edessa|Counties of Edessa]] and [[County of Tripoli|Tripoli]], and the [[Principality of Antioch]]{{mdash}}on behalf of their absent or minor rulers.

The polarisation of the Muslim world enabled the crusaders (or Franks) to consolidate their rule in Palestine. They could also appeal to the [[Pope]]s and the European rulers for help against their enemies. [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]] and [[Amalric of Jerusalem|Amalric]] maintained a close alliance with the [[Byzantine Empire]], but they could not prevent the ruler of Aleppo, [[Nur ad-Din (died 1174)|Nur ad-Din]] from uniting the Muslim states in Syria in the 1150s. Internal strives weakened the kingdom during the reigns of the leper [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]] and the unpopular [[Guy of Lusignan]], which enabled Nur ad-Din's former general, [[Saladin]] to unite Egypt and Syria in the 1180s. Saladin annihilated the crusader army in the [[Battle of Hattin]] on July 4, 1187 and occupied almost the whole kingdom during the following months.

An Italian crusader, [[Conrad of Montferrat]], saved [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and the [[Third Crusade]] forced Saladin to acknowledge the restoration of the Franks' rule in most coastal towns in his 1192 truce with [[Richard I of England]]. Further lands were recovered during the reigns of [[Henry II, Count of Champagne|Henry of Champagne]] and [[Aimery of Lusignan]], and [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], also restored the Franks' rule in Jerusalem in 1229. Frederick and his successors were absent monarchs and the kingdom was administered by regents (or baillifs) from 1229 to 1269. Due to conflicts between the kings' representatives and the powerful barons, and the [[War of Saint Sabas]] between Genoa and Venice, the kingdom disintegrated into autonomous towns and lordships by the 1260s. The personal union of Jerusalem and Cyprus could not prevent the Mameluks of Egypt from occupying the last Frank outposts in 1291.

Local Muslims and Christians made up the majority of the population in the countryside, but European{{mdash}}mainly French, Italian and Catalan{{mdash}}colonists also settled in the villages. [[Sugar refinery]], based on local [[sugarcane]] plantations, developed into an important industry.

From the confines of Jerusalem and the city of Constantinople a horrible tale has gone forth and very frequently has been brought to our ears, namely, that a race from the kingdom of the Persians, an accursed race, ... has invaded the lands of those Christians and has depopulated them by the sword, pillage and fire... . They destroy the altars, after having defiled them with their uncleanness. They circumcise the Christians, and the blood of the circumcision they either spread upon the altars or pour into the vases of the baptismal font. ... What shall I say of the abominable rape of the women? To speak of it is worse than to be silent. The kingdom of the Greeks is now dismembered by them... . On whom therefore is the labor of avenging these wrongs and of recovering this territory incumbent, if not upon you?"''

Because of this I am taking you as my adopted son, and I am putting everything I possess in your power, so that my empire and land can be freed and save through you from the present and future multitudes." The duke was pleased and beguilded by the emperor's peaceful and affectionate words, and he not only gave himself as a son, ... but even as a vassal with hands joined... ."''

Later, in Pope Eugene's time, it is said that both the knights and their humbler servants, called sergeants, began to affix crosses made of red cloth to their mantles, so as to distinguish themselves from others. ... They are said to have immense possessions..., so that there is now not a province in the Christian world which has not bestowed upon the aforesaid brothers a portion of its goods. It is said today that their wealth is equal to the treasures of kings. ... Although they maintained their establishment honorably for a long time and fulfilled their vocation with sufficient prudence, later, because of the neglect of humility..., they withdrew from the Patriarch of Jerusalem, by whom their Order was founded ... and to whom they denied the obedience which their predecessors rendered. They have also taken away tithes and first fruits from God's churches, have disturbed their possessions, and have made themselves exceedingly troublesome. "''

On her head she wore a golden diadem covered by a net of woven gold, and on her breast was a like arrangement. Proud she was in her ornaments and dress, walking with little steps of half a span, like a dove or in the manner of a wisp of cloud. God protect us from the seduction of the sight. Before her went Christian notables in their finest and most splendid clothing, their trains falling in behind them. ... The Muslims and other Christian onlookers formed two ranks along the route, and gazed upon them without reproof."''

Transportation of goods to factories, and of finished products from them, was limited by high transport costs along roads to their destinations.  This was not too severe in the case of light valuable materials such as [[textiles]] ([[Cloth production|woolen]] and [[linen]] cloth) but in the case of dense materials such as coal, it could be a limiting factor on the viability of an industry.  In contrast, freighting goods by water, whether on rivers or coastwise was much cheaper. Canals brought the first major change to transportation, and were usually built directly from the mines to city centres, such as the famous [[Bridgewater Canal]] in [[Manchester]]. [[Tramway (industrial)|Tramways]] were also common using horses locomotion.

==River navigations==
{{Main|History of the British canal system}}
Some rivers, such as the [[Thames]], [[River Severn|Severn]] and [[River Trent|Trent]] were naturally navigable, at least in their lower reaches. 

Other rivers were improved during the 17th and early 18th centuries, improving the transport links of towns such as [[Manchester]], [[Wigan]], [[Hereford]], and [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]] in England.  However these only provided links towards the coast, not across the heart of England. It was the canals which were to provide the vital links in the transport network.

==Turnpike trusts==
{{Main|Turnpike trusts}}
In England, the roads of each parish were maintained by compulsory labour from the parishioners, six days per year.  This proved inadequate in the case of certain heavily used roads, and from the 18th century (and in a few cases slightly earlier), statutory bodies of trustees began to be set up with power to borrow money to repair and improve roads, the loans being repaid from tolls collected from road users.  In the 1750s there was a boom in creating new turnpike trusts with the result that by the end of the 18th century almost all main roads were turnpike roads.  Each trust required an [[Act of Parliament]], both on its initial creation and to renew it when the term granted by the Act expired. Cars were invented in the 1800s.

==Railways==
{{Main|History of rail transport}}
[[File:Stephenson's Rocket.jpg|thumb|right|''Rocket'' as preserved in the [[Science Museum, London]]]]

These railways were all horse-drawn, though in many cases their slope meant that the horse was not required to draw the wagon downhill; instead it was necessary to apply a brake to slow the descent.  The wagon was emptied into a river [[barge]] (or keel or trow), and the horse drew the empty wagon back to the coal pit.  Steam engine haulage was tried by [[Richard Trevithick]] on the [[Merthyr Tramroad]] from [[Penydarren]] to [[Abercynon]] in 1804, but proved unsatisfactory, partly because the engine was too heavy for the rails.  It was only after the development of stronger rails made of rolled [[wrought iron]] in the 1820s that steam engine-hauled long-distance railways became feasible.  Like the early wagonways, these were (indeed are) edge railways, where the wheels of the engine and wagons (or carriages) are flanged.  Thus followed the [[Stockton and Darlington]] Railway, the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] and many more. People were able to use railways to get to factory work and jobs much more effectively than previous options.

[[File:Map of Croatia in 1791 by Reilly 002.jpg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Turkish Croatia (marked by green border line and words "Türkisch Kroatien") on a map from 1791 made by Austrian cartographer Franz J.J. von Reilly]]
'''Turkish Croatia''' or '''Ottoman Croatia''' ({{lang-hr|Turska Hrvatska}}, {{lang-de|Türkisch Kroatien}}, {{lang-it|Croazia turca}}, {{lang-fr|Croatie turque}}) was a part of the [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] of the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatian Kingdom]] occupied by the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the 15th and 16th century. By the 19th century, with the [[Croats|Croatian population]] mostly displaced, the name Turkish Croatia was replaced by cartographers in favor of [[Bosanska Krajina]] (Bosnian Frontier).

The territory of Turkish Croatia roughly comprised the land area between three rivers – [[Vrbas River|Vrbas]] in the east, [[Sava]] in the northeast, [[Una (Sava)|Una]] in the northwest – as well as [[Dinara]] mountain in the south, and including the ''[[Cazin]]ska krajina'' pocket in the far west. This area is a part of the present-day state of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].
Parts of [[Lika]], [[Banovina_(region)|Banovina]] and northern [[Dalmatia]] were also parts of Turkish Croatia, when its borders went further west.

==History==

During the [[Middle Ages]] and the very beginning of the [[Early modern period]], the territory of Turkish Croatia was situated in the central and eastern part of the independent medieval Croatian state (from 925 known as [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Kingdom of Croatia]]), which lasted until the beginning of the 12th century, when the country, following the [[Pacta conventa (Croatia)|Pacta conventa]] agreement, entered into a personal union with [[History of Hungary|Hungary]] in 1102. At that time the term „Bosnia“ was used for a relatively small area alongside the upper part of the [[Bosna (river)|Bosna river]] that barely reached the [[Drina]], which constituded eastern border of [[Croatia in union with Hungary|Croatia-Hungary state]]. 
It was only in the 14th century, at the time of civil war in [[Croatia in union with Hungary|Croatia and Hungary]], that the Ban and proclaimed King [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Stjepan Tvrtko I]] which had most of his estates in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Middle Ages|central Bosnia]]  grew in both, size and power, attracting local nobels as [[Hrvatinić family|Hrvatinići]] on his side trying to take the title of King in Croatia and Dalmatia.
This events made the borders more flexible (after his death there were numerous civil wars in Bosnia), and made the local nobility more important as [[Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić]], duke of Split and vice king of Bosnia became "real" king of Bosnia in everything, but in its name. 

The [[fall of Bosnia to the Ottomans]] in 1463 resulted in increasing pressure on Croatian borders and continual losses of the territory, little by little moving the border line to the west. Permanent [[warfare]] during the [[Hundred Years' Croatian–Ottoman War]] (1493-1593) drastically reduced Croatian population in affected southeastern regions. Until the end of the 16th century the whole area of Turkish Croatia was occupied by the mighty sultanate. The remaining Croats were either murdered or captured, converted to [[Islam]] and recruited as [[devsirme]] (''blood tax''). A part of the Croatian population managed to flee though, settling down in the northwestern regions of the country or abroad, in the neighbouring Hungary or [[Austria]]. [[Catholic Church|Catholic churches]] were destroyed by the Ottoman soldiers or reconstructed into [[mosque]]s; some [[priest]]s and [[bishop]]s were killed, some of them succeeded in escaping.
Parts of region were firstly organized as "Vilayet Croat", but later divided in sanjaks [[Sanjak of Krka|Krka]], [[Sanjak of Klis|Klis]] and Bihać.

From the 16th to 19th century Turkish Croatia bordered [[Croatian Military Frontier]] ({{lang-hr|Hrvatska vojna Krajina}}, {{lang-de|Kroatische Militärgrenze}}), a [[Habsburg Empire]]-controlled part of Croatia, which was administered directly from [[Vienna]]'s military headquarters. In the 19th century, following the [[Ottoman–Habsburg wars|Habsburg-Ottoman war]] in 1878 and the fall of the [[Bosnia Vilayet]], Turkish Croatia remained within the borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who 1908 became a new [[Crown land]] of the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina in Austria-Hungary|Habsburg Monarchy]]. Although the (recently renamed) old Croatian territory was liberated, there were very few Croatian population left, i.e. population who actually lived in it registered as [[Catholics]] and Croats.

'''Ware''' is an extinct [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]] near [[Lake Victoria]] in East Africa.

==ISO Removal==
When an SIL team failed to find any speakers, ''Ethnologue'' retired the ISO code, apparently not realizing the language was known to be extinct.
