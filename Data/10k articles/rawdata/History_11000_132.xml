'''Abdolhossein Zarrinkoub ''' ([[Luri language|Luri]]/[[Persian language|Persian]]: {{lang|fa|عبدالحسین زرین‌کوب}}, also [[Romanize]]d as ''Zarrinkoob'', ''Zarrinkub'') (March 17, 1923 – September 15, 1999) was a scholar of [[Iranian literature]], [[history of literature]], Persian culture and history.

He was born on March 19, 1923, in [[Borujerd]], [[Iran]], received his PhD from [[Tehran University]] in 1955 under the supervision of [[Badiozzaman Forouzanfar]], and held faculty positions at universities such as [[Oxford University]], [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], and [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://theprince.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/princeton?a=d&amp;d=Princetonian19691008-01. 2. 18&amp;cl=search&amp;srpos=20&amp;dliv=none&amp;st=1&amp;e=-------en-Logical-50--1-byTY-on--summer-ILLUSTRATION---1969 A. H. Zarrinkoub, visiting professor from the University of Tehran, will give the first of a series of weekly lectures on Persian Mystical Literature in its Historical Context.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Research works ==

Some of his works in English are:

* ''The Arab Conquest of Iran and its aftermath'': in ''[[Cambridge History of Iran]]'', Vol. 4, London, 1975.
* ''Persian Sufism in its historical background'', ''Iranian studies'' III, 1970
* ''Nizami, a Lifelong Quest for a Utopia'', 1977, Rome.

=== Literary criticism and comparative literature ===

Zarrinkoob wrote comparative literature and Persian literary criticism in his book "''Naqda Adabi''" ({{lang|fa|نقد ادبی}}, "Literary Criticism").

=== Rumi and Erfan ===

Zarrinkoub also researched the Persian poet [[Rumi|Molana Jalaleddin Balkhi]] (Rumi) and his works. Zarrinkoub's "''Serr-e Ney''" ({{lang|fa|سرّ نی}}, "Secret of the Reed") and "''Bahr dar Koozeh''" ({{lang|fa|بحر در کوزه}}, "Sea in a Jug") are critical and comparative analysis of Rumi's Masnavi. "''Pelleh-Pelleh ta Mulaqat-e Khuda''" ({{lang|fa|پله‌پله تا ملاقات خدا}}, "Step by Step until Visiting God") is also a work he carried out on the same line.

Zarrinkoub's research works on [[Hafez]] and Persian mysticism resulted in several books: "''Az Kooche-ye Rendan''" ({{lang|fa|از کوچهٔ رندان}}) and "''Arzeshe Miras-e Soofieh''" ({{lang|fa|ارزش میراث صوفیه}}) are a few examples.

=== History of Persia ===

Zarrinkoub wrote "''[[Two Centuries of Silence]]''" ({{lang|fa|دو قرن سکوت}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=ʻAbd al-Ḥusayn Zarrīnʹkūb|authorlink=Abdolhossein Zarinkoob|title=Dū qarn sukūt: sarguz̲asht-i ḥavādis̲ va awz̤āʻ-i tārīkhī dar dū qarn-i avval-i Islām (Two Centuries of Silence)|location=Tihrān|publisher=Sukhan|year=2000|oclc=46632917 |id= {{Listed Invalid ISBN|964-5983-33-6}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; on Islamic history and  ''Rouzegaran'', ({{lang|fa|روزگاران}}) (The Ages) (Iran's history from the beginning to the fall of the Pahlavi)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=ʻAbd al-Ḥusayn Zarrīnʹkūb |publisher=Elm Pub. |location=Tehran, Iran |edition=13th ed. 1391 |year=2012 |isbn=978-964-6961-11-1 |title=Ruzgaran: Tarikh-i Iran az aghaz ta suqut-i saltanat-i Pahlavi |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which covers the 3, 000-year history of Iran, since the Aryans migrated to the Iranian plateau.

[[File:Albert Harkavy.jpg|thumb|200px|Portrait of '''Albert (Abraham) Harkavy''', from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia.]]
'''Avraam/Albert Yakovlevich Harkavy''' ({{lang-ru|Авраа́м Я́ковлевич Гарка́ви}}), or '''Avraham Eliyahu ben Yaakov Harkavy''' (in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]) (17 October 1835 – 15 March 1919) was a [[Jew]]ish [[Russia]]n historian and [[orientalism|orientalist]].

== Biography ==
Harkavy was born in 1835 in [[Navahrudak]], [[Minsk Governorate]] (in present-day [[Belarus]]). He studied initially in the [[Volozhin yeshiva]] and graduated from the Teacher's Institute in [[Vilna]]. In 1863, he enrolled at the [[University of St Petersburg]], where he studied Oriental Languages and graduated with the degree of master of history in 1868. He continued his studies in [[Berlin]] and [[Paris]], receiving a doctorate in history in 1872.

Harkavy become involved in Jewish communal life in Russia, and was extremely active in various capacities. From 1864 Harkavy was secretary of the Society for the Promotion of Culture Among the Jews of Russia, and from 1873 he was one of the directors of the Jewish community of St. Petersburg.

In 1876 he was appointed head of the Oriental Division in the [[Imperial Public Library]], an astonishing achievement for a Jew under [[Czar]]ist society's anti-Semitic policies. He remained in this position for the rest of his life. He died in [[Petrograd]].

== Works ==
Harkavy was a prolific author, both as an individual and in collaboration with other Russian-Jewish scholars. He wrote in Russian, German, and most notably in Hebrew, which had only recently been revived as a language of common discourse. Among his theories, he speculated that certain groups of Eastern European [[Jew]]s, such as the [[Krymchaks]], [[Karaite Judaism|Karaims]] and even many [[Ashkenazim]], might be descended from the [[Khazars]]. This theory, largely debunked by modern genetic testing, inspired [[Arthur Koestler]]'s ''The Thirteenth Tribe'', which took Harkavy's hypothesis to an extreme. In the course of his Khazar research Harkavy refuted many of [[Avraham Firkovich]]'s theories and exposed some of his forgeries.

Among his numerous works in [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Hebrew]], [[German language|German]], and [[French language|French]], there should be mentioned his ''Ha-Yehudim u-Sefat ha-Slawim,'' studies in the early history of the [[Jews of Russia]], first published in Russian by the Imperial Russian Archeological Society under the title ''Ob Yazykye Yevreyev,'' etc. (St. Petersburg, 1865). Harkavy's aim here was to prove that the first Jews who settled in South Russia did not come from Germany, as was supposed by [[Heinrich Grätz|Grätz]] and other historians, but from [[Greece]] through the [[Black Sea]] region and the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]], and from the Orient by way of the [[Caucasus]]. He furthermore showed that [[Slavonic language|Slavonic]] was the language spoken by the Jews in the Slavonic countries until the arrival of German Jews in great numbers during the [[Crusades]]. He proved that the Jewish writers in Russia and other Slavonic countries used Slavonic words and phrases in their [[Biblical]] and [[Talmudic]] commentaries. The Slavonic names among the Slavonic Jews, the Slavonic inscriptions in Hebrew characters on Polish coins, the tradition among the Russian Jews that their ancestors spoke Slavonic,and the testimony of early writers, are effectively cited by him in support of his contention.

Besides this work he published:
* ''Skazaniya Yevreiskikh Pisatelei, o Chazarskom Tzarstvye'' St. Petersburg, 1874.
* ''Chazarskiya Pisma'' (in ''Yevreiskaya Biblioteka,'' 1881-82).
* ''Rus i Russkiye v Srednevyekovoi Yevreiskoi Literaturye'' (in ''Voskhod,'' 1881-82).
* ''Istoricheski Ocherk Sinoda Chetyriokh Stran'' (in ''Voskhod,'' 1884).
* ''Les Mots Egyptiens de la Bible'' (reprint from ''Journal Asiatique,'' Paris, 1870).
* ''Zikkaron la-Rishonim we-gam la-Aḥaronim. Studien und Mittheilungen aus der St. Petersburg Kaiserlichen Bibliothek.'' 5 vols. St. Petersburg, 1879-82. Contains biographies and works of [[Samuel ha-Nagid]], [[Samuel ben Hophni]], [[Saadia Gaon]], [[Hai Gaon]], and other [[geonim]], from manuscripts in the St. Petersburg library, annotated by Harkavy.
* ''Neuaufgefundene Hebräische Bibelhandschriften'' (paper read before the Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg, April, 1884; published in ''Zapiski . . . Akademii,'' series vii., vol. 32, No. 8).
* ''O Yazykye Yevreyev Zhivshikh v Drevneye Vremya na Russi.'' St. Petersburg. 1886.
* Notes to the Russian translation of [[Heinrich Graetz]]'s ''Geschichte.'' 2 vols., 1889-1902.
* Notes to the Russian translation of [[Gustav Karpeles]]'s ''History of Jewish Literature.'' St. Petersburg, 1889-90.
* Notes and additions to P. Rabinovich's [[Hebrew]] translation of Grätz's ''Geschichte,'' vols. iii.-viii. Warsaw. 1893-99.

Harkavy contributed many valuable articles on the early history of the Jews in Russia to:
* ''Meassef Niddaḥim'' (supplement to ''[[Ha-Meliẓ]]'', parts i. and ii.)
* ''Ha-Karmel,'' 1862 et seq.
* ''Monatsschrift,'' 1883 et seq.
* ''Russko-Yevreiski Arkhiv,'' 1883
* ''Brüll's "Jahrbücher,'' 1876
* ''Voskhod,'' 1881-84
* ''Ben 'Ammi,'' part i., St. Petersburg, 1887
* ''Ḥadashim gam Yeshanim,'' in ''Ha-Miẓpah,'' vol. i.
* ''Ha-Asif,'' vol.i.
* ''Keneset Yisrael,'' i. and iii.
* ''Ha-Karmel'' (Russian), 1865, etc.

In 1910 the scientific world celebrated Harkavy's 75th birthday by issuing a memorial book. The contributors were the world's best known scientists in Judaica and orientology. Attached to the book was a list of 399 works by Harkavy.

Among clothing construction professionals, a collar is differentiated from other [[neckline]]s such as [[revers]] and [[lapel]]s, by being made from a separate piece of fabric, rather than a folded or cut part of the same piece of fabric used for the main body of the garment.

A collar may be permanently attached to the main body of the garment (e.g. by stitching) or [[Detachable collar|detachable]].

== Word usage ==
The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] traces ''collar'' in its modern meaning to c. 1300, when collars served as [[gorget | neck-protecting armour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|collar}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Today's shirt collars descend from the [[ruffle]] caused by the drawstring at the [[neck]] of the [[medieval]] [[chemise]],{{cn|date=January 2018}} through the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] [[Ruff (clothing)|ruff]] and its successors, the whisk collar and [[bands (neckwear)|falling band]]. Separate collars exist alongside attached collars from the mid-16th century, usually to allow [[starch]]ing and other fine finishing,{{cn|date=January 2018}} or to make collar-laundering easier.&lt;ref&gt;

| quote = It is claimed by America that one of her citizens, a Mrs. Hannah Lord Montague, in the course of her domestic duties a hundred years ago, observed that collars (which in those days were part of the shirt) soiled much more quickly than the rest of the garment. She conceived the idea of making a collar which could be detached from the shirt and washed separately. Whether the detachable collar originated in America or not, the collar industry in England seems to have come into being in 1840, more or less about the same time as it did in America.

and the [[tee-shirt]] demonstrate the non-necessity of collars.

==Terminology==
* ''Band'' - a strip of fabric that fastens around the neck, [[perpendicular]] to the body of the garment, to which a collar proper may be attached.
* ''[[Collar stiffeners]]'', ''bones'' or ''stays'' - strips of [[baleen]], [[metal]], [[horn (anatomy)|horn]], [[mother of pearl]], or [[plastic]], rounded at one end and pointed at the other, inserted into a man's shirt collar to stiffen it and prevent the points from curling up; usually inserted into the underside of the collar through small slits but sometimes permanently sewn in place.
* ''Points'' - the corners of a collar; in a buttoned-down collar, the points are fitted with [[buttonhole]]s that attach to small buttons on the body of the shirt to hold the collar neatly in place.
* ''Spread'' - the distance between the points of a shirt collar.
* ''Stand'' - the band on a coat or shirt collar that supports the collar itself.

==Types of collars==
Collars can be categorized as:
* ''Standing or stand-up'', fitting up around the neck and not lying on the shoulders.
* ''Turnover'', standing around the neck and then folded or rolled over.
* ''Flat or falling'', lying flat on the shoulders.

Collars may also be ''stiffened'', traditionally with [[starch]]; modern wash-and-wear shirt collars may be stiffened with [[interfacing (textiles)|interfacing]] or may include metal or plastic [[collar stays]]. Shirt collars which are not starched are described as ''soft collars''. The shape of collars is also controlled by the shape of the [[neckline]] to which they are attached. Most collars are fitted to a [[jewel neck]], a neckline sitting at the base of the neck all around; if the garment opens down the front, the top edges may be folded back to form [[lapel]]s and a V-shaped opening, and the [[cut (clothing)|cut]] of the collar will be adjusted accordingly.

===Collar styles===
{{Original research|section|date=August 2008}}
Names for specific styles of collars vary with the vagaries of [[fashion]]. In the 1930s and 1940s, especially, historical styles were adapted by [[fashion designer]]s; thus, the [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] '''bertha''' collar — a cape-like collar fitted to a low scooping neckline  —  was adapted in the 1940s but generally attached to a V-neckline.

Some specific styles of collars include:

==Buttoning==
{{See also|Dress shirt#Shirt wearing}}
Conventions on fastening the buttons on a collar differ globally. In the United States and the United Kingdom, the top button is virtually always left unbuttoned, unless one is wearing a [[necktie]], but unbuttoning two or more buttons is seen as overly casual. By contrast, in Slavic countries, including at least [[Poland]], and [[Ukraine]], the top button is buttoned even in the absence of a tie.

==Extended meanings==
From the contrast between the starched white shirt collars worn by businessmen in the early 20th century and the blue chambray workshirts worn by laborers comes the use of collar colors in job designation, the "workforce colorwheel". Examples are ''[[blue-collar]]'', ''[[pink-collar]]'' and ''[[White-collar worker|white-collar]]''.

A '''commemorative plaque''', or simply '''plaque''', or in other places referred to as a '''historical marker''' or '''historic plaque''', is a plate of metal, ceramic, stone, wood, or other material, typically attached to a wall, stone, or other vertical surface, and bearing text or an image in [[relief]], or both, to commemorate one or more persons, an event, a former use of the place, or some other thing. Many modern plaques and markers are used to associate the location where the plaque or marker is installed with the person, event, or item commemorated as a place worthy of visit.&lt;ref name="george"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lat34north.com/HistoricMarkers/MarkerDefinition.cfm |title=Historic Markers Across Georgia |accessdate=2008-10-31 |publisher=Latitude 34 North }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A monumental plaque or tablet commemorating a deceased person or persons, can be a simple form of [[church monument]]. Most modern plaques affixed in this way are commemorative of something, but this is not always the case, and there are purely religious plaques, or those signifying ownership or affiliation of some sort. A [[plaquette]] is a small plaque, but in English, unlike many European languages, the term is not typically used for outdoor plaques fixed to walls.

 {{main|Benin Bronzes}}
The [[Benin Empire]], which flourished in present-day [[Nigeria]] between the thirteenth and nineteenth centuries, had an exceedingly rich sculptural tradition. One of the kingdom's chief sites of cultural production was the elaborate ceremonial court of the [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]] (divine king) at the palace in Benin. Among the wide range of artistic forms produced at the court were rectangular brass or bronze plaques. At least a portion of these plaques, which were mainly created from the thirteenth through sixteenth centuries, commemorate significant persons and events associated with the Oba's court,&lt;ref name=Ezra&gt;{{cite book|last=Ezra|first=Kate|title=Royal Art of Benin: The Perls Collection in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=1992|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|isbn=0810964147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=British&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aoa/b/benin_plaque_oba__europeans.aspx |title=Benin plaque: the oba with Europeans |accessdate=27 June 2015 |publisher=The British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; including important battles during Benin's sixteenth century expansionary period.&lt;ref name=Plankensteiner&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plankensteiner |first=Barbara |title=Benin—Kings and Rituals: Court Arts from Nigeria. |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/_/print/PrintArticle.aspx?id=171138749 |work=African Arts |publisher=University of California |date=22 December 2007 |accessdate=27 June 2015 |issn=0001-9933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval Europe ===
{{main|Monumental brass}}
Brass or bronze memorial plaques were produced throughout medieval Europe from at least the early thirteenth through the sixteenth centuries as a form of [[church monument|sepulchral memorial]] generally inset into the walls of churches or surfaces of tombs. Surviving in great numbers, they were manufactured from sheet brass or [[latten]], very occasionally coloured with enamels, and tend to depict highly conventional figures with brief inscriptions.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Brasses, Monumental|volume=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Badham&gt;{{cite book |author1-last=Badham |author1-first=Sally |author2-last=Norris |author2-first=Malcolm |title=Early Incised Slabs and Brasses |location=London |publisher=Society of Antiquaries |date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern ==

Historical markers are put on display by the owners of sites listed by national agencies concerned with [[historic preservation]] such as the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] and the [[National Register of Historic Places]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/faq.htm#plaque |title=National Register of Historic Places |accessdate=2008-10-31 |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080709051930/http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/research/nris.htm |archivedate = 2008-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in the [[United States]]), the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/ |title=The National Trust |accessdate=2008-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in the [[United Kingdom]]), [[An Taisce]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antaisce.org/ |title=''An Taisce'' |accessdate=2008-10-31 |publisher=[[National Trust for Ireland]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]), [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]] (in the [[Philippines]]), and the National Trusts of other countries.

Other historical markers are created by local [[municipality|municipalities]], [[non-profit organizations]], [[company|companies]], or individuals. In addition to geographically defined regions, individual organizations, such as [[E Clampus Vitus]] or the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]], can choose to maintain a national set of historical markers that fit a certain theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/105/story/464343.html |title=Making their markers |accessdate=2008-10-31 |publisher=[[The News &amp; Observer]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210120622/http://www.newsobserver.com/105/story/464343.html |archivedate=2009-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry Cole, Lock &amp; Whitfield woodburytype, 1876-84.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir [[Henry Cole]] helped set up the first historical marker scheme in 1866.]]
The [[Royal Society of Arts]] established the first scheme in the world for historical commemoration on plaques in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/ |publisher=English Heritage |title=Blue Plaques |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scheme was established under the influence of the British politician [[William Ewart (British politician)|William Ewart]] and the [[civil service|civil servant]] [[Henry Cole]].&lt;ref&gt;Hansard vol 172 17 July 1863 quoted in 'The commemoration of historians under the blue plaque scheme in London' by author
Howard Spencer&lt;/ref&gt; The first plaque was unveiled in 1867 to commemorate [[Lord Byron]] at his birthplace, 24 Holles Street, [[Cavendish Square]]. The earliest historical marker to survive, commemorates [[Napoleon III]] in King Street, [[St James's]], and was also put up in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/about/history/ |publisher=English Heritage |title=History of the Blue Plaques Scheme |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original plaque colour was blue, but this was changed by the manufacturer [[Mintons Ltd|Minton, Hollins &amp; Co]] to chocolate brown to save money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/vmblueplaques/general/about_blue_plaques.asp |title=About blue plaques |publisher=Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, the scheme was first taken over by the local government authority - the [[London County Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/about/design/ |publisher=English Heritage |title=The Blue Plaque Design |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Historical markers of the Philippines}}
Historical markers ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''panandang pangkasaysayan'') are cast-iron plaques installed all over the Philippines that commemorate people, places, personalities, structures, and events. They are installed by the [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]]. This practice started in 1933, with NHCP's predecessor, the Philippine Historical Research and Markers Committee, which initially only marked antiquities in [[Manila]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historical Markers Placed by the Philippine Historical Committee|last=|first=|publisher=Bureau of Printing|year=1958|isbn=|location=Manila|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial markers were placed in 1934.

Markers have their texts primarily in [[Filipino language|Filipino]], while there are also markers in the English language, especially for markers that were installed during the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American occupation]]. Markers in regional languages such as [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]], and [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]], are also available and issued by the NHCP. Markers are found all over the country, and there have been [[List of historical markers of the Philippines overseas|markers installed outside]] the country. The plaques themselves are permanent signs installed in publicly visible locations on buildings, monuments, or in special locations. There are more than 1,500 markers to date.  Most markers are located within [[Luzon]], especially in [[Metro Manila]], which has prompted the NHCP to install more markers in [[Visayas]] and [[Mindanao]], for their greater inclusion in the national historical narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9c6mrxI4zoYRHJGV0Jvd1lKdEk/view|title=2011-2012.pdf|work=Google Docs|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Historical markers of the Philippines#Issues|Issues and controversies]] have also been the concern of several individual markers, from the commemoration of the late dictator [[Ferdinand Marcos]] to the reaction of the Japanese embassy to the [[comfort women]] [[Filipina Comfort Women|statue and marker]]. There have also been some markers replaced by new ones because of rectified information, theft, or loss due to war or disasters. Many American-era markers have been destroyed or were lost as casualties of World War II.

Local municipalities and cities can also install markers of figures and events of local significance. Though they may have the permission of the NHCP, these markers are barred from using the [[Coat of arms of the Philippines|seal of the Republic of the Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9c6mrxI4zoYN0Ewdlk4WG9Ha28/view|title=GUIDELINES_IDENTIF CLASSIF AND RECOG OF HIST SITES &amp; STRUCTS IN THE PHIL.pdf|work=Google Docs|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===

[[File:PLAQUE.JPG|thumb|right|222px|This [[Greater London Council]] [[blue plaque]] at [[Alexandra Palace]] commemorates the launch of [[BBC Television]] there in 1936.]]
[[Blue plaque]]s are the principal type of historical markers found throughout [[England]] and are the closest thing there is to a historical marker system in that country. An example is the blue plaque scheme run by [[English Heritage]] in [[London]], although these were originally erected in a variety of shapes and colors. The [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] (which is a [[non-profit organization|non-profit charity organization]] unlike English Heritage and English Heritage properties) has its own similar markers as well.&lt;ref name="blue"&gt;[http://www.markeroni.com/lists/resource.php?division=ENG Markeroni.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115124105/http://www.markeroni.com/lists/resource.php?division=ENG |date=15 January 2016 }}, Information about historical markers and historical plaques, and historic preservation in England, British Isles.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eng"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.1494 |title=English Heritage |publisher=English Heritage |date=2011-10-26 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all historical markers in the United Kingdom are blue, and many are not ceramic. There are commemorative plaque schemes in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Brighton]], [[Liverpool]], [[Loughton]], and elsewhere—some of which differ from the familiar blue plaque. A scheme in [[Manchester]] uses color-coded plaques to commemorate figures, with each of the colors corresponding to the person's occupation. The [[Dead Comics' Society]] installs blue plaques to commemorate the former residences of well-known comedians, including those of [[Sid James]] and [[John Le Mesurier]]. In 2003, the [[London Borough]] of [[Southwark]] started a plaque scheme which included living people in the awards. Even in London, the [[Westminster City Council]] runs a green plaque scheme which is run alongside that of the blue plaque scheme administered by English Heritage. Other schemes are run by civic societies, district or town councils, or [[local history]] groups, and often operate with different criteria.&lt;ref name="blue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eng"/&gt; In 2010, British tabloid ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' placed a red coloured plaque outside the [[Snappy Snaps]] store in Hampstead, North London where singer [[George Michael]] crashed in the early hours of Sunday 4 July 2010. The newspaper stated it planned to put similar plaques in sites around the UK to mark events that had proved popular in the UK [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|Tabloid Press]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3143082/The-Sun-marks-the-dented-shop-front-where-stoned-George-Michael-crashed.html "The Sun marks the dented shop front where stoned George Michael crashed"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193924/http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3143082/The-Sun-marks-the-dented-shop-front-where-stoned-George-Michael-crashed.html |date=3 March 2016 }}, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', accessed 2010-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England]], the London [[blue plaque]]s scheme, which is administered by [[English Heritage]], has been running for over 140 years and is thought to be the oldest of its kind in the world. Plaques are attached to buildings to commemorate their association with important occupants or events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/about/history/ |title=History of the Blue Plaques Scheme |accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A range of other commemorative plaque schemes, which are typically run by local councils and charitable bodies, exists throughout the United Kingdom. These tend to use their own criteria for determining the eligibility to put up a plaque. A list of schemes currently operating in England is available on the English Heritage website.

{{main|Memorial Plaque (medallion)}} 
After the [[First World War]], the families of British and British Empire (now Commonwealth) service men and women killed during the conflict were presented with bronze [[Memorial Plaque (medallion)|Memorial Plaque]]s. The plaques, of about {{convert|125|mm|in}} in diameter, were designed by the eminent [[sculptor]] and [[medallist]], [[Edward Carter Preston]].

=== United States ===

In the [[United States]], various state governments have commemorative plaque schemes usually using the name [[historical marker]]s. The [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] or the U.S. Government, through the National Register of Historic Places, can bestow historical status.

State programmes, such as the [[California Register of Historical Resources]], allow designated sites to place their own markers.

The criteria and circumstances through which a party administers the distribution of historical markers varies. For example, the "Preservation Worcester" program in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], allows a person to register their house or other structure of least fifty years of age if the building is well preserved, with retention of its original character and importance to the architectural, cultural or historical nature of the local [[neighborhood]]. One then pays a fee ($185 to $225) to receive the historical marker itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.preservationworcester.org/pages/historic_marker.html |title=Preservationworcester.org |publisher=Preservationworcester.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106205509/http://www.preservationworcester.org/pages/historic_marker.html |archivedate=2011-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ParkmanHouse.jpg|thumb|222px|left|These historical markers indicate the location of [[Francis Parkman|Francis Parkman House]], a [[National Historic Landmark]] on [[Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts|Beacon Hill]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].]]
In the same state, the [[Boston]] [[neighborhood]] of [[Charlestown, Massachusetts]] has its own local association to administer historical markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charlestownpreservation.org/historicmarkers.html |title=Charlestownpreservation.org |publisher=Charlestownpreservation.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005042404/http://www.charlestownpreservation.org/historicmarkers.html |archivedate=2011-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other historical markers in and around Boston are administered by agencies such as [[The Bostonian Society]]&lt;ref name="phil"&gt;2007 Catalogue For Philanthropy&lt;/ref&gt; or are associated with sites such as those along the [[Freedom Trail]], the [[Black Heritage Trail]], and the [[Emerald Necklace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/bost/ |title=Boston National Historic Park |publisher=Nps.gov |date=2011-11-17 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of mostly locally generated historical markers in the United States include the plaque outside the [[Alaska Governor's Mansion]] made by the [[Alaska]] [[Centennial]] Commission's historical markers program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/cat/details.aspx?f=1&amp;guid=82f607f0-483e-4514-a4a9-bfeefaca17b0 |title=Alaska Historic Markers |publisher=Waymarking.com |date=2011-01-31 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the historical markers of State Historic Marker Council in [[Florida]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flheritage.com/preservation/compliance/laws/1a_48.pdf Florida Heritage &amp; Preservation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820004055/http://www.flheritage.com/preservation/compliance/laws/1a_48.pdf |date=20 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the markers placed by various agencies in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (of which one source mentions 3,292 different historical markers&lt;ref name="george"/&gt;), in [[Indiana]], where it is illegal to create a historical marker in the "state format" without first getting official approval from that state's historical bureau,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.in.gov/history/7363.htm |title=Historical Marker FAQs |publisher=In.gov |date=2009-06-16 |accessdate=2011-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215021947/http://www.in.gov/history/7363.htm |archivedate=2009-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; historical markers in [[Kansas]] erected by the Kansas Historical Society and the [[Kansas Department of Transportation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kshs.org/tourists/markers.htm |title=Kansas Historical Markers |publisher=Kshs.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Roadside Historic Marker Program in [[Maryland]] administered by the Maryland Historical Trust,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mht.maryland.gov/ Maryland Historical Trust]&lt;/ref&gt; the State Historic Marker Program of [[New York (state)|New York]] (begun in 1926 to commemorate the Sequicentennial of the [[American Revolution]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/services/marker/srvmarker.html |title=New York State Museum |publisher=Nysm.nysed.gov |date=1998-12-01 |accessdate=2011-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905155427/http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/services/marker/srvmarker.html |archivedate=2015-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the historic markers placed as recently as 2008 in [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex County]], [[New Jersey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sussex.nj.us/Cit-e-Access/news/index.cfm?NID=11011&amp;TID=7&amp;jump2=0 |title=Sussex County News and Information |publisher=Sussex.nj.us |date=2008-05-14 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[New Mexico]] historical markers printed in white letters on a brown background by the [[Department of Transportation|New Mexico Department of Transportation]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmshtd.state.nm.us/upload/images/District%202/PR4-HistoricMarkersReplaced-2008.pdf New Mexico Department of Transportation] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; the historical markers of [[North Carolina]] (the Historical Publications Section of the state Office of Archives and History publishes a ''Guide to North Carolina Highway Historical Markers''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsobserver.com/105/story/464343.html ''News Observer''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210120622/http://www.newsobserver.com/105/story/464343.html |date=10 February 2009 }} (26 July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; the more than 1200 historical markers of [[Ohio]] (all of which are now made in a [[Marietta, Ohio]] workshop),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.touring-ohio.com/history/state-markers.html |title=Manufacturing Ohio's Historic Markers |publisher=Touring-ohio.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002095436/http://www.touring-ohio.com/history/state-markers.html |archivedate=2011-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 550 official state markers in [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/hp/markers/faq.asp |title=Wisconsin Historical Society |publisher=Wisconsinhistory.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cornelius Ryan and Godfried Bomans 1966.jpg|thumb|Cornelius Ryan and [[Godfried Bomans]] in 1966]]
'''Cornelius Ryan''' (5 June 1920 – 23 November 1974) was an Irish journalist and author mainly known for his writings on popular [[military history]], especially his [[World War II]] books: [[The Longest Day (book)|''The Longest Day: 6 June 1944 D-Day'']] (1959), [[The Last Battle (Cornelius Ryan book)|''The Last Battle'']] (1966), and [[A Bridge Too Far (book)|''A Bridge Too Far'']] (1974).

==Early life==
Ryan was born in [[Dublin]] and educated at [[Synge Street CBS]], [[Portobello, Dublin|Portobello]], Ireland. He was an altar boy at [[St. Kevin's Church, Harrington Street, Dublin|St Kevin's Church]], Harrington Street and studied the violin at the Irish Academy of Music in Dublin. He was a boy scout in the 52nd Troop of the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland and travelled on their pilgrimage to Rome on the liner Lancastria in 1934.&lt;ref name=TIME-1974-12-9&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,908994,00.html Milestones]. – [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'']]. – 9 December 1974. – Retrieved: 22 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan moved to London in 1940, and became a war correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in 1941.

He initially covered the [[World War II#Course of the war|air war in Europe]], flew along on fourteen bombing missions with the [[Eighth Air Force|Eighth]] and [[Ninth Air Force|Ninth]] [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF), and then joined General [[George S. Patton]]'s [[Third United States Army|Third Army]] and covered its actions until the end of the European war. He transferred to the Pacific theater in 1945, and then to [[Jerusalem]] in 1946.

Ryan emigrated to the United States in 1947 to work for [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'']], where he reported on the postwar tests of atomic weapons carried out by the United States in the Pacific.&lt;ref name=TIME-1974-12-9 /&gt; He then reported for ''TIME'' on the Israeli war in 1948.&lt;ref name=TIME-1974-12-9 /&gt; This was followed by work for other magazines, including ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'' and ''[[Reader's Digest]]''.&lt;ref name=Another /&gt;

He married Kathryn Morgan (1925–1993), a novelist, and became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States in 1951.&lt;ref name=PGIL&gt;[http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/index.htm Cornelius Ryan: Life]. – Ricorso. – Retrieved: 23 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On a trip to Normandy in 1949 Ryan became interested in telling a more complete story of [[Operation Overlord]] than had been produced to date. He began compiling information and conducting over 1000 interviews as he gathered stories from both the Allies and the Germans, as well as the French civilians.&lt;ref name=TIME-1974-12-9 /&gt;

In 1956 he began to write down his World War II notes for [[The Longest Day (book)|''The Longest Day: 6 June 1944 D-Day'']], which tells the story of the [[D-Day]] [[Invasion of Normandy]], published three years later in 1959. It was an instant success, and Ryan helped in the writing of the screenplay for the [[The Longest Day (film)|1962 film of the same name]]. [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] paid the author US$175,000 for the screen rights to the book.&lt;ref name=TIME-1962-10-19&gt;"Operation Overblown". – [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'']]. – 19 October 1962. – Retrieved: 23 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Ryan's 1957 book ''One Minute to Ditch!'' is about the [[Pan Am Flight 6|successful ocean ditching]] of a [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American]] [[Boeing 377|Boeing 377 Stratocruiser]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Cornelius, (1957). – ''One Minute to Ditch!''. – New York: Ballantine. 158 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; He had written an article about the ditching for ''Collier's'' in their 21 December 1956, issue and then expanded it into the book.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Cornelius. – "One Minute to Ditch!". – ''[[Collier's Weekly]]''. – 21 December 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

His next work was [[The Last Battle (Cornelius Ryan book)|''The Last Battle'']] (1966), about the [[Battle of Berlin]]. The book contains detailed accounts from all perspectives: civilian, American, British, Russian and German. It deals with the fraught military and political situation in the spring of 1945, when the forces of the western allies and the Soviet Union contended for the chance to liberate Berlin and to carve up the remains of Germany.

This work was followed by ''[[A Bridge Too Far (book)|A Bridge Too Far]]'' (1974), which tells the story of [[Operation Market Garden]], the ill-fated assault by allied [[airborne forces]] on the Netherlands culminating in the [[Battle of Arnhem]]. This work was made into a [[A Bridge Too Far (film)|major 1977 film of the same name]].

Ryan was awarded the French [[Legion of Honour]], and an honorary Doctor of Literature degree from [[Ohio University]], where the Cornelius Ryan Collection is housed ([[Alden Library]]). He was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] in 1970, and struggled to finish ''A Bridge Too Far'' during his illness. He died in [[Manhattan]],&lt;ref name=TIME-1974-12-9 /&gt; while on tour promoting the book, only two months after publication.

Four years after his death, Ryan's struggle with prostate cancer was detailed in ''A Private Battle,'' written by his widow, from notes he had secretly left behind for that purpose. He is buried in the Ridgebury Cemetery in northern [[Ridgefield, Connecticut]], USA.

For many years Ryan's editor at [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] was [[Peter Schwed]] who was assisted by [[Michael Korda]].&lt;ref name=Another&gt;{{cite book|last1=Korda|first1=Michael|title=Another life : a memoir of other people|date=1999|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=0679456597|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan's literary agent was Paul Gitlin.&lt;ref name=Another /&gt;

'''Deforestation''', '''clearance''', or '''clearing''' is the removal of a [[forest]] or stand of trees where the land is thereafter [[land conversion|converted]] to a non-forest use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionaryofforestry.org/dict/term/deforestation SAFnet Dictionary|Definition For [deforestation&amp;#93;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725234528/http://dictionaryofforestry.org/dict/term/deforestation |date=25 July 2011 }}. Dictionary of forestry.org (29 July 2008). Retrieved 2011-05-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of deforestation include conversion of forestland to [[farm]]s, [[ranch]]es, or [[urban area|urban]] use. The most concentrated deforestation occurs in [[tropical rainforest]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, Alina. (4 March 2015) [http://www.livescience.com/27692-deforestation.html Deforestation: Facts, Causes &amp; Effects]. Livescience.com. Retrieved 2016-11-13.&lt;/ref&gt; About 31 percent of Earth's land surface is covered by forests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/deforestation Deforestation | Threats | WWF]. Worldwildlife.org. Retrieved 13 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deforestation occurs for multiple reasons: trees are cut down to be used for building or sold as fuel (sometimes in the form of [[charcoal]] or [[timber]]), while cleared land is used as [[pasture]] for [[livestock]] and [[plantation]]. The removal of trees without sufficient [[reforestation]] has resulted in [[Habitat destruction|habitat damage]], [[biodiversity loss]], and [[arid]]ity. It has adverse impacts on [[biosequestration]] of atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]]. Deforestation has also been used in [[war]] to [[sabotage|deprive]] the enemy of vital resources and cover for its forces. Modern examples of this were the use of [[Agent Orange]] by the British military in [[Peninsular Malaysia|Malaya]] during the [[Malayan Emergency]] and the United States military in Vietnam during the [[Vietnam War]].

In 2000 the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) found that "the role of population dynamics in a local setting may vary from decisive to negligible", and that deforestation can result from "a combination of population pressure and stagnating economic, social and technological conditions".&lt;ref name=population1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/sd/WPdirect/WPan0050.htm|title=Population and deforestation|author=Marcoux, Alain|date=August 2000|work=SD Dimensions|publisher=Sustainable Development Department, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628184520/http://www.fao.org/sd/WPdirect/WPan0050.htm|archivedate=28 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degradation of forest ecosystems has also been traced to economic incentives that make forest conversion appear more profitable than forest conservation.&lt;ref name=economicvalue&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/external/academic/forest-es-2003-en.pdf|last=Pearce|first=David W|title=The Economic Value of Forest Ecosystems|journal=Ecosystem Health|volume= 7|issue=4|date=December 2001|pages=284–296|doi=10.1046/j.1526-0992.2001.01037.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many important forest functions have no markets, and hence, no economic value that is readily apparent to the forests' owners or the communities that rely on forests for their well-being.&lt;ref name=economicvalue /&gt; From the perspective of the developing world, the benefits of forest as carbon sinks or biodiversity reserves go primarily to richer developed nations and there is insufficient compensation for these services. Developing countries feel that some countries in the developed world, such as the United States of America, cut down their forests centuries ago and benefited economically from this deforestation, and that it is hypocritical to deny developing countries the same opportunities, i.e. that the poor shouldn't have to bear the cost of preservation when the rich created the problem.&lt;ref name=costarica&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is there too much or too little natural forest in the Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica?|journal=Canadian Journal of Forest Research|volume=30|issue=3|doi=10.1139/x99-225|year=2000|pages=495–506|last1=Bulte|first1=Erwin H|last2=Joenje|first2=Mark|last3=Jansen|first3=Hans GP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The radiation converts to heat which causes global warming, which is better known as the greenhouse effect.&lt;ref&gt;Mumoki, Fiona (18 July 2006).

Only when actively growing can a tree or forest remove carbon, by storing it in plant tissues. Both the decay and burning of wood releases much of this stored carbon back to the atmosphere. Although an accumulation of wood is generally necessary for carbon sequestration, in some forests the network of symbiotic fungi that surround the trees' roots can store a significant amount of carbon, storing it underground even if the tree which supplied it dies and decays, or is harvested and burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.1231923| pmid=23539604|bibcode = 2013Sci...339.1615C|title = Roots and Associated Fungi Drive Long-Term Carbon Sequestration in Boreal Forest| journal=Science| volume=339| issue=6127| pages=1615–8|last1 = Clemmensen|first1 = K.

[http://www.grida.no/CLIMATE/IPCC_TAR/wg1/pdf/TAR-03.PDF "The Carbon Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide"]. IPCC&lt;/ref&gt; Deforestation may also cause carbon stores held in soil to be released. Forests can be either sinks or sources depending upon environmental circumstances. Mature forests alternate between being net sinks and net sources of carbon dioxide (see [[carbon dioxide sink]] and [[carbon cycle]]).

In deforested areas, the land heats up faster and reaches a higher temperature, leading to localized upward motions that enhance the formation of clouds and ultimately produce more rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2004/jun/HQ_04183_deforestation.html NASA Data Shows Deforestation Affects Climate In The Amazon].

===Hydrological===
The [[water cycle]] is also affected by deforestation. Trees extract [[groundwater]] through their roots and release it into the atmosphere. When part of a forest is removed, the trees no longer transpire this water, resulting in a much [[dry climate|drier climate]]. Deforestation reduces the content of water in the soil and groundwater as well as atmospheric moisture. The dry soil leads to lower water intake for the trees to extract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html|title=Underlying Causes of Deforestation|work=UN Secretary-General’s Report|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411092448/http://wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html|archivedate=11 April 2001|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deforestation reduces soil cohesion, so that [[Soil erosion|erosion]], flooding and [[landslide]]s ensue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://people.uwec.edu/jolhm/eh2/rogge/index.htm|author=Rogge, Daniel |work=University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire |title=Deforestation and Landslides in Southwestern Washington }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/413717.stm China's floods: Is deforestation to blame?] BBC News. 6 August 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shrinking [[forest cover]] lessens the landscape's capacity to intercept, retain and [[Transpiration|transpire]] precipitation. Instead of trapping precipitation, which then percolates to groundwater systems, deforested areas become sources of surface water runoff, which moves much faster than subsurface flows. Forests return most of the water that falls as precipitation to the atmosphere by transpiration. In contrast, when an area is deforested, almost all precipitation is lost as run-off.&lt;ref&gt;Raven, P. H. and Berg, L. R. (2006) ''Environment'', 5th ed, John Wiley &amp; Sons. p. 406. {{ISBN|0471704385}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That quicker transport of surface water can translate into [[flash flood]]ing and more localized floods than would occur with the forest cover. Deforestation also contributes to decreased [[evapotranspiration]], which lessens atmospheric moisture which in some cases affects precipitation levels downwind from the deforested area, as water is not recycled to downwind forests, but is lost in runoff and returns directly to the oceans. According to one study, in deforested north and northwest China, the average annual precipitation decreased by one third between the 1950s and the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Economic Costs of China's Environmental Degradation: Project on Environmental Scarcities, State Capacity, and Civil Violence, a Joint Project of the University of Toronto and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences|chapter-url = http://www.library.utoronto.ca/pcs/state/chinaeco/forest.htm|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091230071928/http://www.library.utoronto.ca/pcs/state/chinaeco/forest.htm|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 30 December 2009|publisher = Committee on Internat.

Trees, and plants in general, affect the [[water cycle]] significantly:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* their canopies intercept a proportion of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], which is then evaporated back to the atmosphere ([[Interception (water)|canopy interception]]);
* their litter, stems and trunks slow down [[surface runoff]];
* their roots create [[macropore]]s – large conduits – in the soil that increase [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] of water;
* they contribute to terrestrial evaporation and reduce [[Water content|soil moisture]] via [[transpiration]];
* their [[plant litter|litter]] and other organic residue change soil properties that affect the capacity of soil to store water.
* their leaves control the [[humidity]] of the atmosphere by [[transpiration|transpiring]]. 99% of the water absorbed by the roots moves up to the leaves and is transpired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/pubs/ageng/irrigate/eb66w.htm "Soil, Water and Plant Characteristics Important to Irrigation".] North Dakota State University.&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result, the presence or absence of trees can change the quantity of water on the surface, in the soil or groundwater, or in the atmosphere. This in turn changes erosion rates and the availability of water for either ecosystem functions or human services. Deforestation on lowland plains moves cloud formation and rainfall to higher elevations.&lt;ref name="InTech"/&gt;

The forest may have little impact on flooding in the case of large rainfall events, which overwhelm the storage capacity of forest soil if the soils are at or close to saturation.

[[Tropical rainforest]]s produce about 30% of our planet's [[fresh water]].&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"/&gt;

Deforestation disrupts normal weather patterns creating hotter and drier weather thus increasing drought, desertification, crop failures, melting of the polar ice caps, coastal flooding and displacement of major vegetation regimes.&lt;ref name="InTech"/&gt;

Due to surface [[plant litter]], forests that are undisturbed have a minimal rate of [[erosion]]. The rate of erosion occurs from deforestation, because it decreases the amount of litter cover, which provides protection from [[surface runoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Soil Erosion and Conservation|last=Morgan|first=R.P.C|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2009|isbn=9781405144674|location=|pages=343}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of erosion is around 2 metric tons per square kilometre.&lt;ref name =Homestead&gt;{{Cite book|title=21st Century Homestead: Sustainable Agriculture III: Agricultural Practices|last=Henkel|first=Marlon|publisher=Lulu.com|year=|isbn=9781312939752|location=|pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be an advantage in excessively leached tropical rain forest soils. Forestry operations themselves also increase erosion through the [[road building|development of]] ([[forest road|forest]]) [[road]]s and the use of mechanized equipment.

Deforestation in China's Loess Plateau many years ago has led to soil erosion; this erosion has led to valleys opening up. The increase of soil in the runoff causes the Yellow River to flood and makes it yellow colored.&lt;ref name=Homestead /&gt;

Greater erosion is not always a consequence of deforestation, as observed in the southwestern regions of the US. In these areas, the loss of grass due to the presence of trees and other shrubbery leads to more erosion than when trees are removed.&lt;ref name=Homestead /&gt;

Soils are reinforced by the presence of trees, which secure the soil by binding their roots to soil bedrock. Due to deforestation, the removal of trees causes sloped lands to be more susceptible to [[Landslide|landslides.]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamental Concept in Environmental Studies|last=Mishra|first=D.D.|publisher=S.

Today, developed countries continue to utilize timber for building houses, and wood pulp for [[paper]]. In developing countries almost three billion people rely on wood for heating and cooking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlas.aaas.org/pdf/63-66.pdf Forest Products]. (PDF). Retrieved 4 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The forest products industry is a large part of the economy in both developed and developing countries. Short-term economic gains made by conversion of forest to agriculture, or [[over-exploitation]] of wood products, typically leads to loss of long-term income and long-term biological productivity. [[West Africa]], [[Madagascar]], [[Southeast Asia]] and many other regions have experienced lower revenue because of declining timber harvests. Illegal logging causes billions of dollars of losses to national economies annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rainforests.mongabay.com/0905.htm|work=rainforests.mongabay.com|title=Destruction of Renewable Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forest area change may follow a pattern suggested by the [[forest transition]] (FT) theory,&lt;ref name="MeyfroidtLambin2011"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev-environ-090710-143732|title=Global Forest Transition: Prospects for an End to Deforestation|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|volume=36|pages=343|year=2011|last1=Meyfroidt|first1=Patrick|last2=Lambin|first2=Eric F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby at early stages in its development a country is characterized by high forest cover and low deforestation rates (HFLD countries).&lt;ref name=rud/&gt;

Then deforestation rates accelerate (HFHD, high forest cover – high deforestation rate), and forest cover is reduced (LFHD, low forest cover – high deforestation rate), before the deforestation rate slows (LFLD, low forest cover – low deforestation rate), after which forest cover stabilizes and eventually starts recovering. FT is not a "law of nature", and the pattern is influenced by national context (for example, human population density, stage of development, structure of the economy), global economic forces, and government policies. A country may reach very low levels of forest cover before it stabilizes, or it might through good policies be able to “bridge” the forest transition.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

FT depicts a broad trend, and an extrapolation of historical rates therefore tends to underestimate future BAU deforestation for counties at the early stages in the transition (HFLD), while it tends to overestimate BAU deforestation for countries at the later stages (LFHD and LFLD).

Countries with high forest cover can be expected to be at early stages of the FT. GDP per capita captures the stage in a country’s economic development, which is linked to the pattern of natural resource use, including forests. The choice of forest cover and GDP per capita also fits well with the two key scenarios in the FT:

(i) a forest scarcity path, where forest scarcity triggers forces (for example, higher prices of forest products) that lead to forest cover stabilization; and

(ii) an economic development path, where new and better off-farm employment opportunities associated with economic growth (= increasing GDP per capita) reduce profitability of frontier agriculture and slows deforestation.&lt;ref name=rud/&gt;

{{Further|Timeline of environmental history}}

===Prehistory===
The [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]]&lt;ref name=Benton/&gt; was an event that occurred 300 million years ago. Climate change devastated tropical rainforests causing the extinction of many plant and animal species. The change was abrupt, specifically, at this time climate became cooler and drier, conditions that are not favourable to the growth of rainforests and much of the biodiversity within them. Rainforests were fragmented forming shrinking 'islands' further and further apart. Populations such as the sub class [[Lissamphibia]] were devastated, whereas [[Reptile|Reptilia]] survived the collapse. The surviving organisms were better adapted to the drier environment left behind and served as legacies in succession after the collapse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Néolithique 0001.jpg|thumb|An array of Neolithic artifacts, including bracelets, axe heads, chisels, and polishing tools.]]

In Europe there is little solid evidence before 7000 BC. Mesolithic [[hunter-gatherer|foragers]] used fire to create openings for [[red deer]] and [[wild boar]]. In Great Britain, shade-tolerant species such as [[oak]] and [[Ash tree|ash]] are replaced in the [[palynology|pollen record]] by [[hazel]]s, brambles, grasses and nettles. Removal of the forests led to decreased [[transpiration]], resulting in the formation of upland [[peat bog]]s. Widespread decrease in [[elm]] [[pollen]] across Europe between 8400–8300 BC and 7200–7000 BC, starting in southern Europe and gradually moving north to Great Britain, may represent land clearing by fire at the onset of [[Neolithic]] agriculture.

They include the noted [[Langdale axe industry]] in the [[English Lake District]], quarries developed at [[Penmaenmawr]] in [[North Wales]] and numerous other locations. Rough-outs were made locally near the quarries, and some were polished locally to give a fine finish. This step not only increased the [[mechanical strength]] of the axe, but also made penetration of wood easier. [[Flint]] was still used from sources such as [[Grimes Graves]] but from many other mines across Europe.

Evidence of deforestation has been found in [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Crete]]; for example the environs of the [[Palace of Knossos]] were severely deforested in the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, C. Michael (22 December 2007). [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes "Knossos fieldnotes"], ''The Modern Antiquarian''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-industrial history===
[[File:Rano Raraku quarry.jpg|thumb|Easter Island, deforested. According to [[Jared Diamond]]: "Among past societies faced with the prospect of ruinous deforestation, Easter Island and Mangareva chiefs succumbed to their immediate concerns, but Tokugawa shoguns, Inca emperors, New Guinea highlanders, and 16th century German landowners adopted a long view and reafforested."&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared (2005) "The world as a polder: what does it all mean to us today?" pp. 522–523 in ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive]]'', Penguin Books. {{ISBN|978-0-241-95868-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Throughout prehistory, humans were hunter gatherers who hunted within forests. In most areas, such as the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]], the tropics, Central America, and the Caribbean,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.school.eb.com/comptons/article-9310969?query=deforestation&amp;ct= Encyclopćdia Britannica Online School Edition]. School.eb.com. Retrieved 29 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; only after shortages of wood and other forest products occur are policies implemented to ensure forest resources are used in a sustainable manner.

Three regional studies of historic erosion and alluviation in [[ancient Greece]] found that, wherever adequate evidence exists, a major phase of erosion follows the introduction of farming in the various regions of Greece by about 500-1,000 years, ranging from the later Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Land Use and Soil Erosion in Prehistoric and Historical Greece|journal=Journal of Field Archaeology|volume=17 |issue=4 |pages= 379–396|url=http://www.esf.edu/cue/documents/vanAndel-etal_LandUse-HistoricGreece_1990.pdf|doi=10.1179/009346990791548628|year=2013 |last1=Van Andel|first1=Tjeerd H.|last2=Zangger|first2=Eberhard|last3=Demitrack|first3=Anne}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thousand years following the mid-first millennium BC saw serious, intermittent pulses of soil erosion in numerous places. The historic [[silting]] of ports along the southern coasts of [[Asia Minor]] (''e.g.'' [[Clarus]], and the examples of [[Ephesus]], [[Priene]] and [[Miletus]], where harbors had to be abandoned because of the silt deposited by the Meander) and in coastal [[Syria]] during the last centuries BC.

[[Easter Island]] has suffered from heavy [[soil erosion]] in recent centuries, aggravated by agriculture and deforestation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/The_Mystery_of_Easter_Island.html "The Mystery of Easter Island"], ''Smithsonian Magazine'', 1 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jared Diamond]] gives an extensive look into the collapse of the ancient Easter Islanders in his book ''[[Collapse (book)|Collapse]]''. The disappearance of the island's trees seems to coincide with a decline of its civilization around the 17th and 18th century. He attributed the collapse to deforestation and over-exploitation of all resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mongabay.com/09easter_island.htm|title=Historical Consequences of Deforestation: Easter Island (Diamond 1995)|publisher=mongabay.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/24/042.html|title=Jared Diamond, Easter Island's End|publisher=hartford-hwp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous silting up of the harbor for [[Bruges]], which moved port commerce to [[Antwerp]], also followed a period of increased settlement growth (and apparently of deforestation) in the upper river basins. In early medieval [[Riez]] in upper [[Provence]], alluvial silt from two small rivers raised the riverbeds and widened the floodplain, which slowly buried the Roman settlement in alluvium and gradually moved new construction to higher ground; concurrently the headwater valleys above Riez were being opened to pasturage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Land Management: Challenges &amp; Strategies|last=Iyyer|first=Chaitanya|publisher=Global India Publications|year=2009|isbn=9789380228488|location=|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical [[progress trap]] was that cities were often built in a forested area, which would provide wood for some industry (for example, construction, shipbuilding, pottery). When deforestation occurs without proper replanting, however; local wood supplies become difficult to obtain near enough to remain competitive, leading to the city's abandonment, as happened repeatedly in Ancient [[Asia Minor]]. Because of fuel needs, mining and metallurgy often led to deforestation and city abandonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Ecological Degradation|last=Chew|first=Sing C.|publisher=AltaMira Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=Oxford, England|pages=69–70|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With most of the population remaining active in (or indirectly dependent on) the agricultural sector, the main pressure in most areas remained land clearing for crop and cattle farming. Enough wild green was usually left standing (and partially used, for example, to collect firewood, timber and fruits, or to graze pigs) for wildlife to remain viable. The elite's (nobility and higher clergy) protection of their own hunting privileges and game often protected significant woodland.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Natural Resources to Post-Human Resources: Towards a New Theory of Diversity and Discontinuity|last=Baofu|first=Peter|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2014|isbn=9781443867061|location=|pages=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major parts in the spread (and thus more durable growth) of the population were played by monastical 'pioneering' (especially by the [[Benedictine]] and [[commerce|Commercial]] orders) and some [[feudal]] lords' recruiting farmers to settle (and become tax payers) by offering relatively good legal and fiscal conditions. Even when speculators sought to encourage towns, settlers needed an agricultural belt around or sometimes within defensive walls. When populations were quickly decreased by causes such as the [[Black Death]] or devastating warfare (for example, [[Genghis Khan]]'s [[Mongol]] hordes in eastern and central Europe, [[Thirty Years' War]] in Germany), this could lead to settlements being abandoned. The land was reclaimed by nature, but the [[secondary forest]]s usually lacked the original [[biodiversity]].
[[File:Rugendas - Defrichement d une Foret.jpg|thumb|Deforestation of Brazil's [[Atlantic Forest]] c.1820–1825]]
From 1100 to 1500 AD, significant deforestation took place in [[Western Europe]] as a result of the [[Human overpopulation|expanding human population]]. The large-scale building of wooden sailing ships by European (coastal) naval owners since the 15th century for exploration, [[Colonialism|colonisation]], [[slave trade]]–and other trade on the high seas consumed many forest resources. [[Piracy]] also contributed to the over harvesting of forests, as in Spain. This led to a weakening of the domestic economy after Columbus' discovery of America, as the economy became dependent on colonial activities (plundering, mining, cattle, plantations, trade, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Natural Resources to Post-Human Resources: Towards a New Theory of Diversity and Discontinuity|last=Baofu|first=Peter|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2014|isbn=9781443867061|location=pg.309|pages=703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Changes In the Land'' (1983), [[William Cronon]] analyzed and documented 17th-century English colonists' reports of increased seasonal flooding in [[New England]] during the period when new settlers initially cleared the forests for agriculture. They believed flooding was linked to widespread forest clearing upstream.

The massive use of [[charcoal]] on an industrial scale in [[Early Modern Europe]] was a new type of consumption of western forests; even in Stuart England, the relatively primitive production of charcoal has already reached an impressive level. Stuart England was so widely deforested that it depended on the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] trade for ship timbers, and looked to the untapped forests of [[New England]] to supply the need. Each of Nelson's [[Royal Navy]] war ships at Trafalgar (1805) required 6,000 mature oaks for its construction. In France, [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]] planted [[oak]] forests to supply the French navy in the future. When the oak plantations matured in the mid-19th century, the masts were no longer required because shipping had changed.

[[Norman F. Cantor]]'s summary of the effects of late medieval deforestation applies equally well to Early Modern Europe:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cantor, Norman F. |title=The civilization of the Middle Ages: a completely revised and expanded edition of Medieval history, the life and death of a civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0qiYM2_HhJgC|accessdate=4 December 2011|date=9 June 1994|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-092553-6|page=564}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Europeans had lived in the midst of vast forests throughout the earlier medieval centuries. After 1250 they became so skilled at deforestation that by 1500 they were running short of wood for heating and cooking. They were faced with a nutritional decline because of the elimination of the generous supply of wild game that had inhabited the now-disappearing forests, which throughout medieval times had provided the staple of their carnivorous high-protein diet. By 1500 Europe was on the edge of a fuel and nutritional disaster [from] which it was saved in the sixteenth century only by the burning of soft coal and the cultivation of potatoes and maize.}}

==Industrial era==
In the 19th century, introduction of [[steamboat]]s in the United States was the cause of deforestation of banks of major rivers, such as the [[Mississippi River]], with increased and more severe flooding one of the environmental results. The steamboat crews cut wood every day from the riverbanks to fuel the steam engines. Between [[St. Louis]] and the confluence with the [[Ohio River]] to the south, the Mississippi became more wide and shallow, and changed its channel laterally. Attempts to improve navigation by the use of [[Snagboat|snag pullers]] often resulted in crews' clearing large trees 100 to {{convert|200|ft|m}} back from the banks. Several French colonial towns of the [[Illinois Country]], such as [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], [[Cahokia, Illinois|Cahokia]] and St. Philippe, [[Illinois]], were flooded and abandoned in the late 19th century, with a loss to the cultural record of their [[archeology]].&lt;ref&gt;Norris, F. Terry (1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HwH3kdOgvfAC&amp;pg=PA73 "Where Did the Villages Go? Steamboats, Deforestation, and Archaeological Loss in the Mississippi Valley"], in ''Common Fields: an environmental history of St. Louis'', Andrew Hurley, ed., St. Louis, MO: Missouri Historical Society Press, pp. 73–89. {{ISBN|978-1-883982-15-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The wholescale clearance of woodland to create agricultural land can be seen in many parts of the world, such as the [[Central forest-grasslands transition]] and other areas of the [[Great Plains]] of the [[United States]]. Specific parallels are seen in the 20th-century deforestation occurring in many developing nations.

A 2002 analysis of satellite imagery suggested that the rate of deforestation in the humid tropics (approximately 5.8 million hectares per year) was roughly 23% lower than the most commonly quoted rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year = 2002|title = Determination of deforestation rates of the world's humid tropical forests|journal = Science|volume = 297|issue = 5583| pages = 999–1003|pmid = 12169731|doi = 10.1126/science.1070656 |author1 = Achard|first1 = F|last2 = Eva|first2 = H.

Others claim that rainforests are being destroyed at an ever-quickening pace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwatch.org/node/4521 Worldwatch: Wood Production and Deforestation Increase &amp; Recent Content], [[Worldwatch Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; The London-based Rainforest Foundation notes that "the UN figure is based on a definition of forest as being an area with as little as 10% actual tree cover, which would therefore include areas that are actually savannah-like ecosystems and badly damaged forests".&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2005/1115-forests.html|title=World deforestation rates and forest cover statistics, 2000–2005|author=Butler, Rhett A. |work= mongabay.com|date=16 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics of the FAO data point out that they do not distinguish between forest types,&lt;ref&gt;The fear is that highly diverse habitats, such as tropical rainforest, are vanishing at a faster rate that is partly masked by the slower deforestation of less biodiverse, dry, open forests. Because of this omission, the most harmful impacts of deforestation (such as habitat loss) could be increasing despite a possible decline in the global rate of deforestation.&lt;/ref&gt; and that they are based largely on reporting from forestry departments of individual countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0629-deforestation.html|title=Remote sensing versus self-reporting}}&lt;/ref&gt; which do not take into account unofficial activities like illegal logging.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank estimates that 80% of logging operations are illegal in [[Bolivia]] and 42% in [[Colombia]], while in [[Peru]], illegal logging accounts for 80% of all logging activities.

==Control==

===Reducing emissions===
{{Main|Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation}}
Main international organizations including the United Nations and the World Bank, have begun to develop programs aimed at curbing deforestation. The blanket term [[Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation|Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation]] (REDD) describes these sorts of programs, which use direct monetary or other incentives to encourage developing countries to limit and/or roll back deforestation. Funding has been an issue, but at the [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties-15 (COP-15) in Copenhagen in December 2009, an accord was reached with a collective commitment by developed countries for new and additional resources, including forestry and investments through international institutions, that will approach USD 30 billion for the period 2010–2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Copenhagen Accord of 18 December 2009 |publisher=UNFCC |year= 2009 |url= http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/cop_15/application/pdf/cop15_cph_auv.pdf |accessdate=28 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant work is underway on tools for use in monitoring developing country adherence to their agreed REDD targets. These tools, which rely on remote forest monitoring using satellite imagery and other data sources, include the [[Center for Global Development]]'s FORMA (Forest Monitoring for Action) initiative&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cgdev.org/section/initiatives/_active/forestmonitoringforactionforma Forest Monitoring for Action (FORMA) : Center for Global Development : Initiatives: Active].

Climateprogress.org (16 December 2009). Retrieved 2010-08-29.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] and partners launched Open Foris – a set of open-source software tools that assist countries in gathering, producing and disseminating information on the state of forest resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/254098/icode/ |title=FAO sets standards to improve national forest monitoring systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tools support the inventory lifecycle, from needs assessment, design, planning, field data collection and management, estimation analysis, and dissemination. Remote sensing image processing tools are included, as well as tools for international reporting for [[Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation]] (REDD) and MRV (Measurement, Reporting and Verification)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Marc|last=Steininger|title=REDD+ MEASUREMENT, REPORTING AND VERIFICATION (MRV) MANUAL|url=http://www.conservation.org/publications/Documents/FCMC_REDD-MRV-Manual-Summary.pdf|website=Conservation.org|publisher=US Aid|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and FAO's [http://www.fao.org/forestry/fra/en/ Global Forest Resource Assessments].

In evaluating implications of overall emissions reductions, countries of greatest concern are those categorized as High Forest Cover with High Rates of Deforestation (HFHD) and Low Forest Cover with High Rates of Deforestation (LFHD). Afghanistan, Benin, Botswana, Burma, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, Guinea, [[Deforestation in Haiti|Haiti]], Honduras, Indonesia, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mongolia, Namibia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Paraguay, Philippines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Togo, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, Zimbabwe are listed as having Low Forest Cover with High Rates of Deforestation (LFHD). Brazil, Cambodia, Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, Equatorial Guinea, Malaysia, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Venezuela, Zambia are listed as High Forest Cover with High Rates of Deforestation (HFHD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD): An Options Assessment Report |publisher=Meridian Institute for the Government of Norway |year= 2009 |url= http://www.africaclimatesolution.org/features/REDD-Options_Assessment_Report.pdf|pages=75–77 |accessdate= 24 November 2011 |author=Angelsen, Arild|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Payments for conserving forests====

In Bolivia, deforestation in upper river basins has caused environmental problems, including soil erosion and declining water quality. An innovative project to try and remedy this situation involves landholders in upstream areas being paid by downstream water users to conserve forests. The landholders receive US$20 to conserve the trees, avoid polluting livestock practices, and enhance the biodiversity and forest carbon on their land. They also receive US$30, which purchases a beehive, to compensate for conservation for two hectares of water-sustaining forest for five years. Honey revenue per hectare of forest is US$5 per year, so within five years, the landholder has sold US$50 of honey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdkn.org/2013/12/payments-for-watershed-services-a-driver-of-climate-compatible-development/?loclang=en_gb ''Payments for watershed services: A driver of climate compatible development''], [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]], 30 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The project is being conducted by [[Fundación Natura Bolivia]] and Rare Conservation, with support from the [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]].

=== Land rights ===
[[File:Shennongjia virgin forest.jpg|thumb|Transferring [[land rights]] to indigenous inhabitants is argued to efficiently conserve forests.]]
Transferring rights over land from public domain to its indigenous inhabitants is argued to be a cost effective strategy to conserve forests.&lt;ref name=Guardian1&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/22/india-follow-china-saving-forest-people-land-rights|title=India should follow China to find a way out of the woods on saving forest people|publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=7 August 2016|date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the protection of such rights entitled in existing laws, such as India’s [[The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006|Forest Rights Act]].&lt;ref name=Guardian1/&gt; The transferring of such rights in [[China]], perhaps the largest [[land reform]] in modern times, has been argued to have increased forest cover.&lt;ref name=rightsandresources&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rightsandresources.org/en/publication/view/chinas-forest-tenure-reforms-impacts-and-implications-for-choice-conservation-and-climate-change/|title=China’s forest tenure reforms|publisher=rightsandresources.org |accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Brazil]], forested areas given tenure to indigenous groups have even lower rates of clearing than [[national park]]s.&lt;ref name=rightsandresources/&gt;

===Farming===
New methods are being developed to farm more intensively, such as high-yield [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] crops, [[greenhouse]], [[autonomous building]] gardens, and [[hydroponic]]s. These methods are often dependent on chemical inputs to maintain necessary yields. In cyclic [[agriculture]], cattle are grazed on farm land that is resting and rejuvenating. Cyclic agriculture actually increases the fertility of the soil. Intensive farming can also decrease soil nutrients by consuming at an accelerated rate the trace minerals needed for crop growth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The most promising approach, however, is the concept of [[forest gardening|food forests]] in [[permaculture]], which consists of agroforestal systems carefully designed to mimic natural forests, with an emphasis on plant and animal species of interest for food, timber and other uses. These systems have low dependence on [[fossil fuels]] and [[agro-chemicals]], are highly self-maintaining, highly productive, and with strong positive impact on soil and water quality, and [[biodiversity]].

===Monitoring deforestation===
There are multiple methods that are appropriate and reliable for reducing and monitoring deforestation. One method is the “visual interpretation of aerial photos or satellite imagery that is labor-intensive but does not require high-level training in computer image processing or extensive computational resources”.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Another method includes hot-spot analysis (that is, locations of rapid change) using expert opinion or coarse resolution satellite data to identify locations for detailed digital analysis with high resolution satellite images.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Deforestation is typically assessed by quantifying the amount of area deforested, measured at the present time.
From an environmental point of view, quantifying the damage and its possible consequences is a more important task, while conservation efforts are more focused on forested land protection and development of land-use alternatives to avoid continued deforestation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Deforestation rate and total area deforested, have been widely used for monitoring deforestation in many regions, including the Brazilian Amazon deforestation monitoring by INPE.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; A global satellite view is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest |title=Global Forest Change – Google Crisis Map|work=Google Crisis Map|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nature.com/news/warning-to-forest-destroyers-this-scientist-will-catch-you-1.20730 |title=Warning to forest destroyers: this scientist will catch you|work=Nature News &amp; Comment|date=4 October 2016|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forest management===
Efforts to stop or slow deforestation have been attempted for many centuries because it has long been known that deforestation can cause environmental damage sufficient in some cases to cause societies to collapse. In [[Tonga]], paramount rulers developed policies designed to prevent conflicts between short-term gains from converting forest to farmland and long-term problems forest loss would cause,&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared ''Collapse: How Societies Choose To Fail or Succeed''; Viking Press 2004, pp. 301–302 {{ISBN|0-14-311700-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while during the 17th and 18th centuries in [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]], Japan,&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared ''Collapse: How Societies Choose To Fail or Succeed''; Viking Press 2004, pp. 320–331 {{ISBN|0-14-311700-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the shōguns developed a highly sophisticated system of long-term planning to stop and even reverse deforestation of the preceding centuries through substituting timber by other products and more efficient use of land that had been farmed for many centuries. In 16th-century Germany, landowners also developed [[silviculture]] to deal with the problem of deforestation. However, these policies tend to be limited to environments with ''good rainfall'', ''no dry season'' and ''very young [[soil]]s'' (through [[volcano|volcanism]] or [[glaciation]]). This is because on older and less fertile soils trees grow too slowly for silviculture to be economic, whilst in areas with a strong dry season there is always a risk of forest fires destroying a tree crop before it matures.

In the areas where "[[slash-and-burn]]" is practiced, switching to "[[slash-and-char]]" would prevent the rapid deforestation and subsequent degradation of soils. The [[biochar]] thus created, given back to the soil, is not only a durable [[carbon sequestration]] method, but it also is an extremely beneficial [[Soil conditioner|amendment]] to the soil. Mixed with [[biomass]] it brings the creation of [[terra preta]], one of the richest soils on the planet and the only one known to regenerate itself.

====Sustainable practices====
[[File:Bamboo Feb09.jpg|thumb|Bamboo is advocated as a more sustainable alternative for cutting down wood for fuel.&lt;ref name=bamboo/&gt;]]
Certification, as provided by global certification systems such as [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification]] and [[Forest Stewardship Council]], contributes to tackling deforestation by creating market demand for timber from sustainably managed forests. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), "A major condition for the adoption of sustainable forest management is a demand for products that are produced sustainably and consumer willingness to pay for the higher costs entailed. Certification represents a shift from regulatory approaches to market incentives to promote sustainable forest management. By promoting the positive attributes of forest products from sustainably managed forests, certification focuses on the demand side of environmental conservation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/011/i0350e/i0350e00.HTM "State of the World's Forests 2009"]. United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rettet den Regenwald|Rainforest Rescue]] argues that the standards of organizations like FSC are too closely connected to [[timber industry]] interests and therefore do not guarantee environmentally and socially responsible forest management. In reality, monitoring systems are inadequate and various cases of fraud have been documented worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rainforest-rescue.org/topics/tropical-timber/faq Facts about Tropical Timber]. Rainforest Rescue. Retrieved 13 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some nations have taken steps to help increase the number of trees on Earth. In 1981, China created National Tree Planting Day Forest and forest coverage had now reached 16.55% of China's land mass, as against only 12% two decades ago.&lt;ref name=battling&gt;Gittings, John (20 March 2001). [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/20/worlddispatch.china "Battling China's Deforestation".] ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using fuel from [[bamboo]] rather than wood results in cleaner burning, and since bamboo matures much faster than wood, deforestation is reduced as supply can be replenished faster.&lt;ref name=bamboo&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/13/in-africas-vanishing-forests-the-benefits-of-bamboo/?ref=global-home|title=In Africa’s vanishing forests, the benefits of bamboo|work=New York Times|date=13 March 2012|accessdate=26 July 2012|first=Tina|last=Rosenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reforestation===
{{Main|Reforestation}}
In many parts of the world, especially in East Asian countries, reforestation and [[afforestation]] are increasing the area of forested lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year = 2005|title = Global Consequences of Land Use|volume = 309|issue = 5734| pages = 570–574|doi = 10.1126/science.1111772|pmid = 16040698|journal = Science|author1 = Foley|first1 = J.

K.|bibcode = 2005Sci...309..570F}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of woodland has increased in 22 of the world's 50 most forested nations. Asia as a whole gained 1 million [[hectare]]s of forest between 2000 and 2005. Tropical forest in El Salvador expanded more than 20% between 1992 and 2001. Based on these trends, one study projects that global forest will increase by 10%—an area the size of India—by 2050.&lt;ref name=Owen&gt;James Owen, [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/11/061113-forests.html "World's Forests Rebounding, Study Suggests"]. ''National Geographic News'', 13 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[People's Republic of China]], where large scale destruction of forests has occurred, the government has in the past required that every able-bodied citizen between the ages of 11 and 60 plant three to five trees per year or do the equivalent amount of work in other forest services. The government claims that at least 1 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] trees have been planted in China every year since 1982. This is no longer required today, but 12 March of every year in China is the Planting Holiday. Also, it has introduced the [[Green Wall of China]] project, which aims to halt the expansion of the Gobi desert through the planting of trees. However, due to the large percentage of trees dying off after planting (up to 75%), the project is not very successful.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} There has been a 47-million-hectare increase in forest area in China since the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Owen/&gt; The total number of trees amounted to be about 35 billion and 4.55% of China's land mass increased in forest coverage. The forest coverage was 12% two decades ago and now is 16.55%.&lt;ref name=battling/&gt;

An ambitious proposal for China is the Aerially Delivered Re-forestation and Erosion Control System and the proposed Sahara Forest Project coupled with the [[Seawater Greenhouse]].

In Western countries, increasing consumer demand for wood products that have been produced and harvested in a sustainable manner is causing forest landowners and [[Wood industry|forest industries]] to become increasingly accountable for their forest management and timber harvesting practices.

The [[Arbor Day Foundation]]'s Rain Forest Rescue program is a charity that helps to prevent deforestation. The charity uses donated money to buy up and preserve rainforest land before the [[lumber]] companies can buy it. The Arbor Day Foundation then protects the land from deforestation. This also locks in the way of life of the primitive tribes living on the forest land. Organizations such as [[Community Forestry International]], [[Cool Earth]], [[The Nature Conservancy]], [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], [[Conservation International]], [[African Conservation Foundation]] and [[Greenpeace]] also focus on preserving forest habitats. Greenpeace in particular has also mapped out the forests that are still intact&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090327183443/http://www.intactforests.org/publications/intactforests_poster_preview.pdf The world’s last intact forest landscapes]. intactforests.org&lt;/ref&gt; and published this information on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intactforests.org|work=intactforests.org|title=World Intact Forests campaign by Greenpeace}}&lt;/ref&gt; World Resources Institute in turn has made a simpler thematic map&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100724183523/http://www.wri.org/map/worlds-forests-restoration-perspective The World's Forests from a Restoration Perspective], WRI&lt;/ref&gt; showing the amount of forests present just before the age of man (8000 years ago) and the current (reduced) levels of forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.howstuffworks.com/gif/maps/pdf/WOR_THEM_Forests.pdf|title=Alternative thematic map by Howstuffworks; in pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; These maps mark the amount of afforestation required to repair the damage caused by people.

===Forest plantations===
In order to acquire the world’s demand for wood, it is suggested that high yielding forest plantations are suitable according to forest writers Botkins and [[Sedjo]]. Plantations that yield 10 cubic meters per hectare a year would supply enough wood for trading of 5% of the world’s existing forestland. By contrast, natural forests produce about 1–2 cubic meters per hectare; therefore, 5–10 times more forestland would be required to meet demand. Forester Chad Oliver has suggested a forest mosaic with high-yield forest lands interspersed with conservation land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Botkin, Daniel B. |title=No man's garden: Thoreau and a new vision for civilization and nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OvF40zunJR4C&amp;pg=PA246|accessdate=4 December 2011|year=2001|publisher=Island Press|isbn=978-1-55963-465-6|pages=246–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, planted forests increased from 4.1% to 7.0% of the total forest area between 1990 and 2015.&lt;ref name="Payn, T. 2015"&gt;Payn, T. et al. 2015. Changes in planted forests and future global implications, Forest Ecology and Management 352: 57–67&lt;/ref&gt; Plantation forests made up 280 million ha in 2015, an increase of about 40 million ha in the last ten years.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. 2015. Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015. How are the world’s forests changing?&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, planted forests consist of about 18% exotic or introduced species while the rest are species native to the country where they are planted. In South America, Oceania, and East and Southern Africa, planted forests are dominated by introduced species: 88%, 75% and 65%, respectively. In North America, West and Central Asia, and Europe the proportions of introduced species in plantations are much lower at 1%, 3% and 8% of the total area planted, respectively.&lt;ref name="Payn, T. 2015"/&gt;

In the country of Senegal, on the western coast of Africa, a movement headed by youths has helped to plant over 6 million mangrove trees. The trees will protect local villages from storm damages and will provide a habitat for local wildlife. The project started in 2008, and already the Senegalese government has been asked to establish rules and regulations that would protect the new mangrove forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stenstrup|first=Allen|title=Forests|year=2010|publisher=Morgan Reynolds Publishing|location=Greensboro, North Carolina|isbn=978-1-59935-116-2|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military context==
{{See also|Environmental impact of war}}

[[File:Attack on bloody ridge.jpg|thumb|American [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tanks]] knocked out by Japanese artillery on Okinawa.]]While demands for agricultural and urban use for the human population cause the preponderance of deforestation, military causes can also intrude. One example of deliberate deforestation played out in the U.S. [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|zone of occupation]] in Germany after [[World War II]] ended in 1945. Before the onset of the [[Cold War]], defeated Germany was still considered a potential future threat rather than a potential future ally. To address this threat, the victorious [[Allies of World War II | Allies]] made attempts to [[Industrial plans for Germany|lower German industrial potential]], of which forests were deemed{{by whom?|date=June 2018}} an element. Sources in the U.S. government admitted that the purpose of this was that the "ultimate destruction of the war potential of German forests". As a consequence of the practice of clear-felling, deforestation resulted which could "be replaced only by long forestry development over perhaps a century".&lt;ref&gt;Balabkins, Nicholas (1964) "Germany Under Direct Controls; Economic Aspects Of Industrial Disarmament 1945–1948, Rutgers University Press. p. 119. The two quotes used by Balabkins are referenced to, respectively: U.S. office of Military Government, ''A Year of Potsdam: The German Economy Since the Surrender'' (1946), p. 70; and U.S. Office of Military Government, ''The German Forest Resources Survey'' (1948), p. II. For similar observations see G.W. Harmssen, ''Reparationen, Sozialproduct, Lebensstandard'' (Bremen: F. Trujen Verlag, 1948), I, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Operations in [[war]] can also cause deforestation. For example, in the 1945 [[Battle of Okinawa]], [[bombardment]] and other [[Military operation|combat operations]] reduced a lush tropical landscape into "a vast field of mud, lead, decay and maggots".&lt;ref&gt;Higa, Takejiro. [http://nisei.hawaii.edu/object/11_takejiro.html Battle of Okinawa], The Hawaii Nisei Project&lt;/ref&gt;

Deforestation can also result from the intentional [[military tactics | tactics]] of [[military forces]]. Clearing forest became an element in the Russian Empire's successful [[Caucasian War | conquest of the Caucasus]] in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;

Deforestation eliminates a great number of species of plants and animals which also often results in an increase in disease.&lt;ref name=CHGE&gt;[http://www.chgeharvard.org/topic/biodiversity-and-infectious-diseases Biodiversity and Infectious Diseases], Center for Health and the Global Environment, [[Harvard T.H.

Often the destruction of predatory species can result in an increase in rodent populations which can carry [[Plague (disease)|plague]].

Deforestation is occurring all over the world and has been coupled with an increase in the occurrence of disease outbreaks. In [[Malaysia]], thousands of acres of forest have been cleared for pig farms. This has resulted in an increase in the zoonosis the Nipah virus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebulletin.org/deforestation-and-emerging-diseases Deforestation and emerging diseases | Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists].

Retrieved 2016-11-13.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 study in the ''[[The American Economic Review|American Economic Review]]'' found that deforestation substantially increased the incidence of malaria in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Julia|first=Berazneva|last2=S.|first2=Byker, Tanya|date=2017-05-01|title=Does Forest Loss Increase Human Disease?

Another pathway through which deforestation affects disease is the relocation and dispersion of disease-carrying hosts. This disease emergence pathway can be called "[[Colonisation (biology)|range expansion]]", whereby the host’s range (and thereby the range of pathogens) expands to new geographic areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Range Expansion and Population Dynamics of an Invasive Species: The Eurasian Collared-Dove (''Streptopelia decaocto'')|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=9|issue=10|pages=e111510|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0111510|pmid=25354270|year=2014|last1=Scheidt|first1=Spencer N.|last2=Hurlbert|first2=Allen H.|pmc=4213033|bibcode=2014PLoSO...9k1510S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through deforestation, hosts and reservoir species are forced into neighboring habitats. Accompanying the reservoir species are pathogens that have the ability to find new hosts in previously unexposed regions. As these pathogens and species come into closer contact with humans, they are infected both directly and indirectly.

A catastrophic example of range expansion is the 1998 outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/338818|pmid=11938496|title=Nipah Virus Encephalitis Outbreak in Malaysia|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|volume=34|pages=S48–51|year=2002|last1=Lam|first1=Sai Kit|last2=Chua|first2=Kaw Bing}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a number of years, deforestation, drought, and subsequent fires led to a dramatic geographic shift and density of [[Megabat|fruit bats]], a reservoir for Nipah virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/nipah/|title=Nipah Virus (NiV)|date=|website=|publisher=cdc.gov|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deforestation reduced the available fruiting trees in the bats’ habitat, and they encroached on surrounding orchards which also happened to be the location of a large number of pigsties. The bats, through proximity spread the Nipah to pigs. While the virus infected the pigs, mortality was much lower than among humans, making the pigs a virulent host leading to the transmission of the virus to humans. This resulted in 265 reported cases of [[encephalitis]], of which 105 resulted in death. This example provides an important lesson for the impact deforestation can have on human health.

Another example of range expansion due to deforestation and other [[Anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]] habitat impacts includes the [[Capybara]] rodent in [[Paraguay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.mongabay.com/2010/12/deforestation-sparks-giant-rodent-invasions/ Deforestation sparks giant rodent invasions]. News.mongabay.com (15 December 2010). Retrieved 2016-11-13.&lt;/ref&gt; This rodent is the host of a number of [[Zoonosis|zoonotic]] diseases and, while there has not yet been a human-borne outbreak due to the movement of this rodent into new regions, it offers an example of how habitat destruction through deforestation and subsequent movements of species is occurring regularly.

A now well-developed theory is that the spread of [[HIV]] it is at least partially due deforestation. Rising populations created a food demand and with deforestation opening up new areas of the forest the hunters harvested a great deal of primate bushmeat, which is believed to be the origin of HIV.&lt;ref name=CHGE/&gt;

Study of the '''environmental impact of war''' focuses on the modernization of [[warfare]] and its increasing effects on the [[Natural environment|environment]]. [[Scorched earth]] methods have been used for much of recorded history. However, methods of modern warfare cause far greater devastation on the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. The progression of warfare from [[chemical weapons]] to [[nuclear weapons]] has increasingly created stress on [[ecosystems]] and the [[Natural environment|environment]]. Specific examples of the environmental impact of war include: [[World War I]], [[World War II]], the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Rwandan Civil War]], the [[Kosovo War]] and the [[Gulf War]].

==Historical events==

=== Vietnam, Rwanda, and the environment ===
[[File:'Ranch Hand' run.jpg|thumb|Defoliant spray run, part of Operation Ranch Hand, during the Vietnam War by UC-123B Provider aircraft]]
The [[Vietnam War]] had significant environmental implications by the use of chemical agents to destroy military significant vegetation. Enemies found an advantage in remaining invisible by blending into a civilian population or by taking cover in dense vegetation and opposing armies targeted natural ecosystems.&lt;ref name=dw&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeWeerdt|first=Sarah|title=War and the Environment|journal=World Wide Watch|date=January 2008|volume=21|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US military used “more than 20 million gallons of [[herbicides]], were sprayed by the US to defoliate forests, clear growth along the borders of military sites and eliminate enemy crops."&lt;ref name=king&gt;{{cite news|last=King|first=Jessie|title=Vietnamese wildlife still paying a high price for chemical warfare|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/vietnamese-wildlife-still-paying-a-high-price-for-chemical-warfare-407060.html|accessdate=4 March 2015|newspaper=The Independent|date=8 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical agents gave the US an advantage in wartime efforts. However, the vegetation was unable to regenerate and left behind bare [[mudflats]] even years after spraying.&lt;ref name=dw /&gt; Not only was the vegetation affected, but also the wildlife: "a mid-1980s study by Vietnamese ecologists documented just 24 species of birds and 5 species of mammals present in sprayed forests and converted areas, compared to 145-170 bird species and 30-55 kinds of mammals in [[intact forest landscape|intact forest]]."&lt;ref name=dw /&gt; The uncertain long-term effects of these herbicides are now being discovered by looking at modified species distribution patterns through habitat degradation and loss in wetland systems, which absorbed the runoff from the mainland.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; 

The Rwandan genocide led to the killing of roughly 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The war created a massive migration of nearly 2 million Hutus fleeing [[Rwanda]] over the course of just a few weeks to [[refugee camps]] in [[Tanzania]] and now modern day [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].&lt;ref name=dw /&gt; This large displacement of people in refugee camps put pressure on the surrounding [[ecosystem]]. Forests were cleared in order to provide wood for building shelters and creating cooking fires:&lt;ref name=dw /&gt; “these people suffered from harsh conditions and constituted an important threat impact to natural resources.”&lt;ref name=sk /&gt; Consequences from the conflict also included the degradation of National Parks and Reserves. The population crash in Rwanda shifted personnel and capital to other parts of the country, making it hard to protect wildlife.&lt;ref name=sk&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kanyamibwa|first=Samuel|title=Impact of war on conservation: Rwandan environment and wildlife in agony|journal=Biodiversity and Conservation|year=1998|pages=1399–1406|doi=10.1023/a:1008880113990|volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

More broadly throughout Africa, war has been a major factor in the decline of wildlife populations inside national parks and other protected areas.&lt;ref name=DaskinPringle&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daskin|first1=Joshua H.|last2=Pringle |first2=Robert M. |title=Warfare and wildlife declines in Africa’s protected areas |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25194 |journal=Nature |volume=553 |pages=328–332 |year=2018 |PMID=29320475 |doi=10.1038/nature25194}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a growing number of ecological restoration initiatives, including in Rwanda's [[Akagera National Park]] and Mozambique's [[Gorongosa National Park]], have shown that wildlife populations and whole ecosystems can be successfully rehabilitated even after devastating conflicts.&lt;ref name=Pringle&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pringle|first1=Robert M. |title=Upgrading protected areas to conserve wild biodiversity |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22902 |journal=Nature |volume=546 |pages=91–99 |year=2017 |PMID=28569807 |doi=10.1038/nature22902}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts have emphasized that solving social, economic, and political problems is essential for the success of such efforts.&lt;ref name=sk /&gt;&lt;ref name=DaskinPringle /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pringle /&gt;

===World War II===
World War II (WW II) drove a vast increase in production, militarized the production and transportation of commodity, while introduced many new environmental consequences, which can still be seen today. World War II was wide ranging in its human, animals, and material destruction. The postwar effects of World War II, both ecological and social, are still visible decades after the conflict. 

During World War II, advanced technology was used to create aircraft, which were used in air raids. Aircraft during the war were used for transporting resources from different military bases and dropping bombs. These activities damaged habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evenden|first=Matthew|date=2011|title=Aluminum, commodity chain, and the environmental history of the second world war|url=|journal=Environmental History|volume=|pages=69 - 93|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to wildlife, ecosystems also suffer from the production of the [[noise pollution]] from military aircraft. During World War II, aircraft acted as a vector for the transportation of exotics whereby weeds and cultivated species were bought to oceanic island ecosystems by way of aircraft landing strips used for refueling and staging station during operations in the Pacific theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stoddart|first=|date=1968|title=Catastrophic human interference with coral atoll ecosystems|url=|journal=Geography|volume=|pages=25 - 40|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the war, the isolated islands around Europe were the habitat of a high number of anemic species. Aerial warfare during World War II had an enormous influence on fluctuating population dynamics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=Michael|date=2015|title=The effects of modern war and military activities on biodiversity and the environment|url=|journal=Environmental Review|volume=|pages=443 - 460|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After four years of World War II in August 1945, the United States of America dropped an atomic bomb over the city of Hiroshima in Japan. About 70,000 people died in nine seconds at the bombing in Hiroshima. Three days after the bombing in Hiroshima, United States of America dropped a second atomic bomb in Nagasaki, Japan with the same devastating outcomes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sjenvironmentaljustice.org/atomic-bombing-of-hiroshima-and-nagasaki/|title=Atomic Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nuclear weapon released a catastrophic load of energy. The temperature once the bombs were blasted reached about 7200°F.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With temperature that high, all the flora and fauna are destroyed along with the infrastructure and human life in the impact zone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When the atomic bomb was dropped, it released enormous quantity of energy and radioactive particles. The radioactive particles released contaminated the land and water for miles.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sciencing.com/environmental-effects-atomic-bomb-8203814.html|title=Environmental Effects of the Atomic Bomb|last=Lemon|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial blast increased the surface temperature, along with the crushing winds caused by the initial blast, trees and buildings in the path were all destroyed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Animals which were caught within the nuclear blast wave have been impacted in numerous ways.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tucker|first=Richard|date=2012|title=War and the Environment|url=|journal=A Companion to Global Environmental History|volume=|pages=319 - 339|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrestrial species are likely to experience more damages compared to aquatic species due to the overpressure injury.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Aquatic organisms are particularly sensitive to the effects of a blast.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The results from the atomic bomb caused a large die-off in the fish population and caused a cascade in the food web system.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

During World War II, the combat zones in European forests experienced traumatic impacts from fighting. Behind the combat zones, timber from cut down trees to clear up the path for fighting. The shattered forests in the battle zones faced exploitation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The use of heavily hazardous chemicals was first initiated during World War II.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The long-term effects of chemicals result from both their potential persistence and the poor disposal program of nations with stockpiled weapons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During World War I (WW I), German chemists had developed chlorine gas and mustard gas. The development of the gases led to many casualties, and poisoned lands on and near the battlefields.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Later in World War II, chemists developed even more harmful chemical bombs, which were packaged in barrels and directly deposited in the oceans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The disposal of the chemicals in ocean runs the risk of metal-based containers corroding and leaching the chemical contents of the vessel into the ocean.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through the chemical disposal in the ocean, the contaminates may be spread throughout the various components of the ecosystems damaging marine and terrestrial ecosystems.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Marine ecosystems during World War II were damaged not only from chemical contaminates, but also from wreckage from naval ships, which leaked oil into the water. Oil contamination in the Atlantic Ocean due to World War II shipwrecks is estimated at over 15 million tonnes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Oil spills are difficult to clean up and take many years to clean. To this day, traces of oil can still be found in the Atlantic Ocean from the naval shipwrecks which happened during World War II. 

The use of chemicals during war helped increase the scale of chemical industries and helped show the government the value of scientific research to the government. The development of chemical research during the war also lead to the postwar development of agricultural pesticides.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The creation of pesticides was an upside for the years after the war. 

The environmental impacts of World War II were very drastic, which allowed them to be seen in the Cold War and be seen today. The impacts of conflict, chemical contaminations, and aerial warfare all contribute to reduction in the population of global flora and fauna, as well as a reduction in species diversity&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Gulf War===
During the 1991 [[Gulf War]], the [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] were a result of the scorched earth policy of Iraqi military forces retreating from [[Kuwait]] in 1991 after conquering the country but being driven out by [[Coalition of Gulf War|Coalition]] military forces. The [[Gulf War oil spill]], regarded as the worst oil spill in history, was caused when Iraqi forces opened valves at the Sea Island oil terminal and dumped oil from several tankers into the [[Persian Gulf]].

Some American military personnel complained of [[Gulf War syndrome]], typified by symptoms including immune system disorders and birth defects in their children. Whether it is due to time spent in active service during the war or for other reasons remains controversial.

[[Resources]] are a key source of [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] between [[nation]]s: "after the end of the [[Cold War]] in particular, many have suggested that [[environmental degradation]] will exacerbate scarcities and become an additional source of armed conflict."&lt;ref name=gled&gt;{{cite book|last=Gledistch|first=Nils|title=Conflict and the Environment|year=1997|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; A nation’s survival depends on resources from the environment.&lt;ref name=gled /&gt; Resources that are a source of armed conflict include territory, strategic raw materials, sources of energy, water, and food.&lt;ref name=gled /&gt; In order to maintain resource stability, chemical and nuclear warfare have been used by nations in order to protect or extract resources, and during conflict.&lt;ref name=gled /&gt;&lt;ref name=rob /&gt; These agents of war have been used frequently: “about 125,000 tons of [[chemical agent]] were employed during World War I, and about 96,000 tons during the Viet-Nam conflict.”&lt;ref name=rob /&gt; [[Nerve gas]], also known as organophosphorous anticholinesterases, was used at lethal levels against human beings and destroyed a high number of nonhuman [[vertebrate]] and [[invertebrate]] populations.&lt;ref name=rob&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=J.P|title=The Effects of Weapons on Ecosystems|year=1979|publisher=Pergamon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, contaminated vegetation would mostly be spared, and would only pose a threat to herbivores.&lt;ref name=rob /&gt; The result of innovations in chemical warfare led to a broad range of different chemicals for war and domestic use, but also resulted in unforeseen environmental damage.

The progression of warfare and its effects on the environment continued with the invention of [[weapons of mass destruction]]. While today, [[weapons of mass destruction]] act as deterrents and the use of weapons of mass destruction during [[World War II]] created significant environmental destruction. On top of the great loss in human life, “natural resources are usually the first to suffer: forests and wild life animals are wiped out.”&lt;ref name=gled /&gt; [[Nuclear warfare]] imposes both direct and indirect effects on the environment. The physical destruction due to the blast or by the biospheric damage due to [[ionizing]] [[radiation]] or [[radiotoxicity]] directly effect [[ecosystems]] within the blast radius.&lt;ref name=rob /&gt; Also, the atmospheric or geospheric disturbances caused by the weapons can lead to weather and climate changes.&lt;ref name=rob /&gt;

===Unexploded ordnance===
{{Main|Unexploded ordnance}}

Military campaigns require large quantities of [[explosive weapon]]s, a fraction of which will not [[detonate]] properly and leave unexploded weapons. This creates a serious physical and chemical hazard for the civilian populations living in areas which were once war zones, due to the possibility of detonation after the conflict, as well as the leaching of chemicals into the soil and groundwater.

===Agent Orange===
{{Main|Agent Orange}}
[[File:Before and after spraying agent orange.jpg|thumb|Mangrove forests, like the top one east of Saigon, were often destroyed by herbicides.]]
[[Agent Orange]] was one of the [[herbicide]]s and [[defoliant]]s used by the [[British military]] during the [[Malayan Emergency]] and the [[United States armed forces|U.S. military]] in its [[herbicidal warfare]] program, [[Operation Ranch Hand]], during the [[Vietnam War]]. An estimated 21,136,000 gal. (80 000 m³) of Agent Orange were sprayed across South Vietnam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.va.gov/Agentorange/ |title=Agent Orange |publisher= United States Department of Veterans |date=January 9, 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; exposing 4.8 million Vietnamese people to Agent Orange, and resulting in 400,000 deaths and disabilities, and 500,000 children born with birth defects.&lt;ref&gt;The Globe and Mail, June 12, 2008. [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080711.worange1107/BNStory/Front/home/?pageRequested=all 'Last Ghost of the Vietnam War']&lt;/ref&gt; Many Commonwealth personnel who handled and/or used Agent Orange during and decades after the 1948-1960 Malayan conflict suffered from serious exposure of dioxin. Agent Orange also caused major [[soil erosion]] to areas in Malaya. An estimated 10,000 civilians and possibly insurgents in Malaya also suffered heavily from defoliant effects, though many historians likely agreed it was more than 10,000 given that Agent Orange was used on a large scale in the Malayan conflict and unlike the U.S., the British government manipulated the numbers and kept its secret very tight in fear of negative world public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pesticide Dilemma in the Third World: A Case Study of Malaysia |pages=23 |publisher=Phoenix Press |year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dioxins and Health |pages=145–160 |author=Arnold Schecter, Thomas A.

===Testing of nuclear armaments===
{{main|Nuclear weapons testing}}
Testing of [[nuclear armament]]s has been carried out at various places including [[Bikini Atoll]], the [[Marshall Islands]] [[Pacific Proving Grounds]], [[New Mexico]] in the US, [[Mururoa Atoll]], [[Maralinga, South Australia|Maralinga]] in Australia, and [[Novaya Zemlya]] in the former Soviet Union, among others.

[[Downwinders]] are individuals and communities who are exposed to [[radioactive contamination]] and/or [[nuclear fallout]] from atmospheric and/or underground [[nuclear weapons testing]], and [[nuclear accidents]].

===Strontium 90===
The United States government studied the post-war effects of a radioactive isotope found in nuclear fallout called [[Strontium 90]]. The Atomic Energy Commission discovered that “Sr-90, which is chemically similar to calcium, can accumulate in bones and possibly lead to cancer”.&lt;ref name=Lutts&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lutts|first=Ralph|title=Chemical Fallout: Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, Radioactive Fallout, and the Environmental Movement|journal=Environmental Review|year=1985|volume=9|series=3|pages=210–225|doi=10.2307/3984231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sr-90 found its way into humans through the ecological food chain as fallout in the soil, was picked up by plants, further concentrated in herbivorous animals, and eventually consumed by humans.&lt;ref name=Kulp&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kulp|first=J. Laurence|title=Strontium-90 in Man|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|year=1957|series=AEC Fifth Semiannual Report: Part II|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depleted uranium munitions===
{{main|Depleted uranium}}
The use of depleted uranium in [[munitions]] is controversial because of numerous questions about potential long-term health effects.&lt;ref name=MillerMcClain /&gt;  Normal functioning of the [[kidney]], [[brain]], [[liver]], [[heart]], and numerous other systems can be affected by uranium exposure, because in addition to being weakly radioactive, uranium is a [[toxic metal]].&lt;ref name=Craft04&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Craft |first1=Elena |last2=Abu-Qare |first2=Aquel |last3=Flaherty |first3=Meghan |last4=Garofolo |first4=Melissa |last5=Rincavage |first5=Heather |last6=Abou-Donia |first6=Mohamed |title=Depleted and natural uranium: chemistry and toxicological effects |journal=Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part B |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=297–317 |year=2004 |pmid=15205046 |doi=10.1080/10937400490452714}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains weakly radioactive because of its long [[half-life]]. The aerosol produced during impact and combustion of depleted uranium munitions can potentially contaminate wide areas around the impact sites or can be inhaled by civilians and military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mitsakou |first1=C. |last2=Eleftheriadis |first2=K. |last3=Housiadas |first3=C. |last4=Lazaridis |first4=M. |title=Modeling of the dispersion of depleted uranium aerosol |journal=Health Physics |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=538–44 |year=2003 |pmid=12705453 |doi=10.1097/00004032-200304000-00014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a three-week period of conflict in Iraq during 2003, it was estimated over 1000 tons of depleted uranium munitions were used mostly in cities.&lt;ref name="gaurdian2003"&gt;Paul Brown, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/apr/25/internationaleducationnews.armstrade Gulf troops face tests for cancer] ''guardian.co.uk'' 25 April 2003, Retrieved February 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Department of Defense]] claims that no human [[cancer]] of any type has been seen as a result of exposure to either natural or depleted uranium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, U.S. DoD studies using cultured cells and laboratory rodents continue to suggest the possibility of [[leukemia|leukemogenic]], [[gene]]tic, [[reproduction|reproductive]], and [[neurological]] effects from chronic exposure.&lt;ref name=MillerMcClain&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=AC |last2=McClain |first2=D |title=A review of depleted uranium biological effects: in vitro and in vivo studies. |journal=Reviews on environmental health |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=75–89 |year=2007 |pmid=17508699 |doi=10.1515/REVEH.2007.22.1.75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the UK Pensions Appeal Tribunal Service in early 2004 attributed [[birth defect]] claims from a February 1991 [[Gulf War]] combat veteran to depleted uranium [[poison]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, M. (February 9, 2004) [http://vitw.org/archives/405 "First Award for Depleted Uranium Poisoning Claim,"] ''The Herald Online,'' (Edinburgh: Herald Newspapers, Ltd.)&lt;/ref&gt; Campaign Against Depleted Uranium (Spring, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cadu.org.uk/news/17.htm#icbuw "MoD Forced to Pay Pension for DU Contamination,"] ''CADU News 17''&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a 2005 [[epidemiology]] review concluded: "In aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to DU."&lt;ref name="Hindin"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hindin |first1=Rita |last2=Brugge |first2=Doug |last3=Panikkar |first3=Bindu|title=Teratogenicity of depleted uranium aerosols: A review from an epidemiological perspective |journal=Environmental Health: A Global Access Science Source |volume=4 |pages=17 |year=2005 |doi=10.1186/1476-069X-4-17 |pmid=16124873 |pmc=1242351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fossil fuel use===
With the high degree of mechanization of the military large amounts of [[fossil fuel]]s are used. Fossil fuels are a major contributor to [[global warming]] and [[climate change]], issues of increasing concern. Access to oil resources is also a factor for instigating a war.

The [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) is a government body with the highest use of fossil fuel in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energybulletin.net/node/13199|title=The US military oil consumption|last=Karbuz|first=Sohbet |date=2006-02-25|publisher=Energy Bulletin|accessdate=2009-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2005 ''CIA World Factbook'', when compared with the consumption per country the DoD would rank 34th in the world in average daily oil use, coming in just behind Iraq and just ahead of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Colonel Gregory J. Lengyel, USAF, The Brookings Institution, Department of Defense Energy Strategy, August 2007, {{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/papers/2007/08defense_lengyel/lengyel20070815.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726045834/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/papers/2007/08defense_lengyel/lengyel20070815.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intentional flooding===
Flooding can be used as [[scorched earth]] policy through using water to render land unusable. It can also be used to prevent the movement of enemy combatants. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], dykes on the Yellow and the Yangtze Rivers [[1938 Yellow River flood|were breached to halt the advance of Japanese forces]].  Also during the [[Siege of Leiden]] in 1573 the dykes were breached to halt the advance of Spanish forces. During Operation Chastise in Germany during WW2 the Eder and Sorpe river dams were bombed flooding a large area and halting industrial manufacture used by the Germans in the war effort.

==Specific cases==
*[[1938 Yellow River flood]], created by the Nationalist Government in central China during the early stage of the Second Sino-Japanese War in an attempt to halt the rapid advance of the Japanese forces. It has been called the "largest act of environmental warfare in history".
*[[Beaufort's Dyke]], used as a dumping ground for bombs
*[[Jiyeh Power Station oil spill]],  bombed by the Israeli Air force during the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]].
*[[Formerly Used Defense Sites]], a U.S. military program which is responsible for environmental restoration
*[[K5 Plan]], an attempt between 1985 and 1989 by the government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea to seal Khmer Rouge guerrilla infiltration routes into Cambodia, resulted in environmental degradation.

== Militarism and the environment ==
Human security has traditionally been solely linked to military activities and defense.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;International Peace Bureau. (2002). The Military’s Impact on The Environment: A Neglected Aspect Of The Sustainable Development Debate A Briefing Paper For States And Non-Governmental Organisations, Retrieved from: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ipb.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/briefing-paper.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; Scholars and institutions like the International Peace Bureau are now increasingly calling for a more holistic approach to security, particularly including an emphasis on the interconnections and interdependencies that exist between humans and the environment.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jorgenson|first=Andrew K.|last2=Clark|first2=Brett|date=2016-05-01|title=The temporal stability and developmental differences in the environmental impacts of militarism: the treadmill of destruction and consumption-based carbon emissions|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11625-015-0309-5|journal=Sustainability Science|language=en|volume=11|issue=3|pages=505–514|doi=10.1007/s11625-015-0309-5|issn=1862-4065}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Military activity has significant impacts on the environment&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2014/07/25/us-department-defence-one-worlds-biggest-polluters-259456.html|title=The US Department of Defense Is One of the World's Biggest Polluters|date=2014-07-17|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradford|first=John Hamilton|last2=Stoner|first2=Alexander M.|date=2017-08-11|title=The Treadmill of Destruction in Comparative Perspective: A Panel Study of Military Spending and Carbon Emissions, 1960-2014|url=http://jwsr.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/jwsr/article/view/688|journal=Journal of World-Systems Research|language=en|volume=23|issue=2|pages=298–325|doi=10.5195/jwsr.2017.688|issn=1076-156X}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Not only can war be destructive to the socioenvironment, but military activities produce extensive amounts of greenhouse gases (that contribute to [[anthropogenic climate change]]), [[pollution]], and cause resource depletion, among other environmental impacts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Greenhouse gas emissions and pollution ===
Several studies have found a strong positive correlation between military spending and increased greenhouse gas emissions, with the impact of military spending on carbon emissions being more pronounced for countries of the Global North (ie: OECD developed countries)&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. Accordingly, the US military is estimated to be the number one fossil fuel consumer in the world&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Schwartz, M. et al. (2012) Department of Defense Energy Initiatives: Background and Issues for Congress. Congressional Research Service, [Online] Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R42558.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, military activities involve high emissions of pollution&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2014/07/25/us-department-defence-one-worlds-biggest-polluters-259456.html|title=The US Department of Defense Is One of the World's Biggest Polluters|last=Nazaryan|first=|date=2014-07-17|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Pentagon’s director of environment, safety and occupational health, Maureen Sullivan, has stated that they work with approximately 39 000 contaminated sites&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;. Indeed, the US military is also considered one of the largest generators of pollution in the world&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;. Combined, the top five US chemical companies only produce one fifth of the toxins produced by the Pentagon&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. In Canada, the Department of National Defence readily admits it is the largest energy consumer of the Government of Canada, and a consumer of “high volumes of hazardous materials”&lt;ref&gt;Department of National Defence Canada (2017). Defence Energy and Environment Strategy. Retrieved from the Government of Canada Website: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/dnd-mdn/documents/reports/2017/20171004-dees-en.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;.

Military pollution is a worldwide occurrence&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. Armed forces from around the world were responsible for the emission of two thirds of [[Chlorofluorocarbon|chlorofluorocarbons]] (CFCs) that were famously banned in the 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]] for causing damage to the [[Ozone depletion|ozone layer]]&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. In addition, naval accidents during the Cold War have dropped at minimum 50 nuclear warheads and 11 nuclear reactors into the ocean, they remain on the ocean floor&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. 

=== Land and resource use ===
Military land use needs (such as for bases, training, storage etc) often displace people from their lands and homes&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. Military activity uses solvents, fuels and other toxic chemicals which can leach toxins into the environment that remain there for decades and even centuries.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Furthermore, heavy military vehicles can cause damage to soil and infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Military-caused noise pollution can also diminish the quality of life for nearby communities as well as their ability to rear or hunt animals to support themselves.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Advocates raise concerns of environmental racism and/or environmental injustice as it is largely marginalized communities that are displaced and/or affected.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Lorincz, T. (2014). Demilitarization for Deep Decarbonization: Reducing Militarism and Military Expenditures to Invest in the UN Green Climate Fund and to Create Low-Carbon Economies and Resilient Communities. Retrieved from The International Peace Bureau Website: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ipb.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Green_Booklet_working_paper_17.09.2014.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Militaries are also highly resource intensive.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Weapons and military equipment make up the second largest international trade sector.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The International Peace Bureau says that more than fifty percent of the helicopters in the world are for military use, and approximately twenty-five percent of jet fuel consumption is by military vehicles.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These vehicles are also extremely inefficient, carbon intensive, and discharge emissions that are more toxic than those of other vehicles.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Activist responses ===
Military funding is, at present, higher than ever before, and activists are concerned about the implication for greenhouse gas emissions and climate change&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. They advocate for demilitarization, citing the high greenhouse gas emissions and support the redirection of those funds to climate action&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. Currently the world spends about 2.2% of global GDP on military funding according to the World Bank&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS|title=Military expenditure (% of GDP) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is estimated that it would cost approximately one percent of global GDP yearly until 2030 to reverse the climate crisis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ourworldindata.org/how-much-will-it-cost-to-mitigate-climate-change|title=How much will it cost to mitigate climate change?|website=Our World in Data|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Moreover, activists emphasize the need for prevention and the avoidance of costly clean up&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. Currently, the expense for cleaning up military contaminated site is at least $500 billion&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. Finally, activists point to social issues such as extreme poverty and advocate for more funding to be redirected from military expenses to these causes&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. 

Groups working for demilitarization and peace include the [[International Peace Bureau]], [[Canadian Voice of Women for Peace]], The Rideau Institute, Ceasefire.ca, [[Project Ploughshares]], and [[Code Pink|Codepink]]. See [[List of anti-war organizations]] for more groups.

==War and environmental law==
{{main|War and environmental law}}
From a legal standpoint, environmental protection during times of war and military activities is addressed partially by international environmental law.  Further sources are also found in areas of law such as general international law, the [[laws of war]], [[human rights law]] and local laws of each affected country.

'''Estotiland''' is a region that appeared on the [[Zeno map]], located where Labrador, Quebec, and Newfoundland are now situated on nautical charts.

== Zeno's description ==
&lt;span&gt;According to the letters that accompanied the Zeno map, Estotiland was discovered by fishermen who sailed in the North Atlantic during the 14th century. Zeno, in a report addressed to his brother, writes: ''the fishing vessel "Frise" was blown westward by a storm, and arrived at a land named "Estotiland," whose inhabitants traded with "Engroenelandt." This country, "Estotiland," was very fertile, and had mountains inland. The king of this country possessed books written in Latin, which he did not understand. The language that he spoke and his subjects shared no similarity to that of the Vikings. The king of Estotiland, seeing that his guests sailed safely with the aid of an instrument (the compass), persuaded them to make a maritime expedition to another land to the south called "Drogeo."'' &lt;/span&gt;

A number of historians have considered this map and these letters to be fakes since the 16th century. Nonetheless, a map created by French cartographer [[Nicolas Sanson]] around 1660 testifies to the existence of Estotiland and to its location north of New France.

== Etymology ==
Several hypotheses have been put forward pertaining to the origin of the word Estotiland.
# ''Estocafis'' or ''estocafic'', two words referring to cod used in Mediterranean recipes (stockfish in English), may be the term's origin, as cod has been fished in the area for centuries.
# A corruption of the word ''Escociland'', land of the Scottish (the Zeno brothers spoke of a welcoming population of Viking origin who had Latin Bibles).
# From the Germanic ''ost'', possibly meaning "east of the lands of beyond."

'''Francesco della Rossa Bartholi''' (died c. 1372) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Franciscan]] chronicler.

==Life==

Little is known of his life save what may be gathered from his own writings. A native of [[Assisi]], he is found in 1312 as a student in [[Perugia]], and in 1316 at [[Cologne]], whence he returned to Umbria bearing many relics, including those of [[Louis IX of France|St. Louis]], King of France, given him by the latter's daughter, [[Blanche of France (1253–1323)|Princess Blanche]], who had become a [[Poor Clare]].

In 1320 and in 1326, he was lector of theology at the [[Porziuncula]], in 1332 guardian at [[S. Damiano]] and in 1334 he was at the [[Sacro Convento]]. He appears to have lived to a great age.

He was acquainted with [[Marinus of Assis]]i, [[John of La Verna]], [[Alvarus Pelagius]] and other well-known Franciscans. Whether he is to be identified with the Francesco Rubea who is mentioned among the partisans of [[Michael de Cesena]] or with the Franciscus de Assisio who was long imprisoned at [[Florence]] on a charge of [[heresy]] is a matter of conjecture.

==Works==

Bartholi wrote several works including a history of [[Passion (Christianity)|the Passion]]. He is best known for his ''Tractatus de Indulgentiâ Sanctae Mariae de Portiunculâ'' composed about 1335. He spent many of his later years in retouching and completing this treatise, on the origin and evolution of the [[Indulgence of Portiuncula]]. It comprises a collection of the ecclesiastical information and popular legends then obtainable on the subject. It was first published by [[Paul Sabatier (theologian)|Paul Sabatier]] with a wealth of critical apparatus in the Collection d'Etudes" (Paris, 1900, Vol. II).

'''Halberstadt''' is a [[town]] in the [[Germany|German]] state of [[Saxony-Anhalt]], the capital of [[Harz (district)|Harz district]]. Located north of the [[Harz]] mountain range, it is known for its [[old town]] centre that was severely damaged in [[World War II]] and rebuilt in the following decades.

==Geography==
[[File:Halberstädter Domplatz.JPG|thumb|left|Cathedral square]]
Halberstadt is situated between the Harz in the south and the [[Huy (hills)|Huy]] hills in the north on the [[Holtemme]] and [[Goldbach (Bode)|Goldbach]] rivers, both left tributaries of the [[Bode (river)|Bode]]. The municipal area comprises the villages of [[Aspenstedt]], [[Athenstedt]], [[Langenstein, Saxony-Anhalt|Langenstein]], [[Sargstedt]], and [[Ströbeck]], all incorporated in 2010. Halberstadt is the base of the Department of Public Management of the [[Hochschule Harz]] University of Applied Studies and Research.

The town centre retains many important historic buildings and much of its ancient townscape. Notable places in Halberstadt include [[Halberstadt Cathedral]], the Church of Our Lady (''Liebfrauenkirche'') and St Martin's, churches built in the 12th and 13th centuries. Halberstadt is the site of the first documented large, permanent [[pipe organ]] installation in 1361.&lt;ref name="oxforddict"&gt;Kennedy, Michael (Ed.) (2002). "Organ". In ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', p. 644. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The cathedral is notable among those in northern European towns in having retained its medieval treasury in virtually complete condition. Among its treasures are the oldest surviving tapestries in Europe, dating from the 12th century. The town is also a stop on the scenic [[German Timber-Frame Road]]

The town can be reached via the [[Bundesstraße 6n]], 79, [[Bundesstraße 81|81]], and [[Bundesstraße 245|245]] federal highways. [[Halberstadt station]] is an important railway hub on the [[Magdeburg–Thale railway|Magdeburg–Thale]] and [[Halle–Vienenburg railway|Halle–Vienenburg]] lines, mainly served by [[Transdev Sachsen-Anhalt]]. The [[Trams in Halberstadt|Halberstadt tramway network]] currently operates two lines.

[[Germania Halberstadt]] is a football club which plays in Halberstadt.

==History==
[[File:Liebfrauenkirche in Halberstadt, Sachsen-Anhalt.JPG|thumb|left|Liebfrauenkirche]]
In 814 the [[Carolingians|Carolingian]] emperor [[Louis the Pious]] made the Christian mission in the German stem duchy of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] the [[episcopal see]] of the [[Bishopric of Halberstadt|Diocese of Halberstadt]]. It was vested with [[market town|market rights]] by King [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] in 989. The town became the administrative centre of the Saxon [[Harzgau]] and an important trading location. The Halberstadt bishops had the Church of Our Lady erected from about 1005 onwards. In his fierce conflict with Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]], the forces of the Saxon duke [[Henry the Lion]] devastated the town in 1179.

Upon Henry's downfall, the Halberstadt diocese was elevated to a [[prince-bishop]]ric about 1180. Its Cathedral was rebuilt from 1236 and consecrated in 1491. Halberstadt, [[Quedlinburg]] and [[Aschersleben]] joined a [[league of towns]] (''Halberstädter Dreistädtebund'') in 1326; from 1387, the city was also a member of the [[Hanseatic League|Hanse]].

From 1479, the diocese was administrated by the [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg|Archbishops of Magdeburg]]. While the Halberstadt citizens turned [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]] around 1540, the cathedral chapter elected Prince [[Henry Julius, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Henry Julius of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]] first Lutheran bishop in 1566. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], the town was occupied by the troops of [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]] in 1629 and temporarily re-Catholicized according to the imperial [[Edict of Restitution]]. According to the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]], the prince-bishopric was finally [[Secularization|secularized]] to the [[Principality of Halberstadt]] held by [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]. The first secular governor was [[Joachim Friedrich von Blumenthal]].

Halberstadt became part of the newly established [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1701. From 1747 [[Johann Wilhelm Ludwig Gleim]] worked here as a government official and made his home an intellectual centre of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] (''Aufklärung'') movement. Upon the 1807 [[Treaties of Tilsit|Treaty of Tilsit]], the town became part of the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], a [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleonic]] client-state, and administrative seat of the Westphalian [[Departments of France|Department]] of [[Saale (river)|Saale]]. On 29 July 1809, a Westphalian regiment was defeated by the [[Black Brunswickers]] under Prince [[Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Frederick William of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]] in the [[Battle of Halberstadt]].&lt;ref&gt;*Gill, John H (2010), ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3tqkAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA450&amp;dq=westphalia+%22Halberstadt%22+1809&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=26uFVfDJCI6p7Aa_sa7QCg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=westphalia%20%22Halberstadt%22%201809&amp;f=false With Eagles to Glory: Napoleon and His German Allies in the 1809 Campaign]'', Frontline Books, {{ISBN|978-1848325821}} (p. 450)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the defeat of Napoleon, the town was restored to Prussia and subsequently administered within the [[Province of Saxony]]. From 1815, Halberstadt was home of garrison of the Prussian [[7th (Magdeburg) Cuirassiers "von Seydlitz"]] regiment, with [[Otto von Bismarck]] in the rank of an officer [[à la suite]] from 1868. The town's economy was decisively promoted by the opening of the [[Magdeburg–Halberstadt Railway Company|Magdeburg–Halberstadt Railway]] in 1843. The tramway was inaugurated in 1903. 
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1980-121-23, Flugzeuge Junkers Ju 88, Montage.jpg|thumb|[[Junkers Ju 88]] wing production]]
In 1912 the [[Halberstädter Flugzeugwerke]] aircraft manufacturer was founded followed by the opening of a military airbase, providing the German ''[[Luftstreitkräfte]]'' in [[World War I]]. After the war it had to close down according to the regulations of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], until in the course of the [[German re-armament]], it opened again in 1935 as a branch of the [[Junkers]] company in [[Dessau]]. The aircraft factory was the site of a ''SS'' [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourer]] camp, one of several [[List of subcamps of Buchenwald|subcamps]] of [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]]; the production facilities and the nearby ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' airbase were targets of [[Air warfare of World War II|Allied bombing]] during the '[[Big Week]]' in February 1944.

In the last days of [[World War II]], in April 1945, US forces approached Halberstadt as they attacked remaining Nazi troops in the short-lived Harz pocket. They dropped leaflets instructing Halberstadt's Nazi ruler to fly a white flag on the town hall as a token of surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Winder. ''Germania : in wayward pursuit of the Germans and their history''. page 435. Picador 2010. {{ISBN|9781135963422}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He refused, no white flag was raised and on 8 April 1945, 218 [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|Flying Fortresses]] of the [[8th Air Force]], accompanied by 239 escort fighters, dropped 595 tons of bombs on the centre of Halberstadt. This killed about 2,500 people and converted most of the old town into some 1.5 million cubic metres of rubble, which American troops briefly occupied three days later.&lt;ref&gt;Roger A. Freeman: ''Mighty Eighth War Diary''. JANE´S. London, New York, Sydney 1981. {{ISBN|0 7106 00 38 0}}. page 483&lt;/ref&gt; By June 1945, the town and its garrison was handed over to the [[3rd Shock Army]] of the Soviet [[Red Army]] forces.

Halberstadt was part of newly established [[Saxony-Anhalt]] from 1945–1952, after which it was within [[Bezirk Magdeburg]] in [[East Germany]]. During the [[Peaceful Revolution]] in Autumn 1989, St Martin's Church was a centre of the [[Swords to ploughshares]] movement. After the [[reunification of Germany]], Halberstadt became part of the restored state of Saxony-Anhalt.

===Jewish culture===
In the 17th century, Halberstadt had one of the largest [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jewish]] communities in central Europe. At the time, nearly one in twelve of the town's inhabitants, almost 700 people, were Jewish. Notable amongst them was [[Issachar Berend Lehmann|Berend Lehmann]] (1661–1730). One example of Lehmann's work was the impressive [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] synagogue he financed, which was completed in 1712. In November 1938, after the ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' pogroms, the Nazi authorities forced the Jewish community to demolish the building, as the attack on it was said to have left it in danger of collapsing.

A short distance from the synagogue, Lehmann also had a house built for students of [[Judaism]], with a collection of [[theology|theological]] writings. This building, known as the "Klaus", was where many important students of the [[Talmud]] and [[rabbi]]s were taught.  The "Klaus" gave Halberstadt the reputation of being an important centre for the study of the [[Torah]]. Today the [[Moses Mendelssohn]] Academy is based there; this organises exhibitions, congresses and presentations and provides a wide range of information about the [[Jewish culture]] and way of life.

===World's slowest, longest concert===
[[File:Halberstadt St-Burchardi-Kirche.jpg|thumb|Sankt-Burchardi-Church]]
A performance of [[John Cage]]'s [[organ (music)|organ]] piece ''[[As Slow As Possible]]'' began in the Burchardikirche in Halberstadt in September 2001; the performance is scheduled to take 639 years. The concert began on 5 September 2001 with a rest lasting 17 months. On the dates of the sound changes the church is usually well visited.

}}
The '''history of the [[Khitan people|Khitans]]''' dates back to the 4th century. The Khitan people dominated much of [[Mongolia]] and modern [[Manchuria]] (Northeast China) by the 10th century, under the [[Liao dynasty]], and eventually collapsed by 1125 (or 1211).

&lt;!-- 2/ ante-388 : origins --&gt;
Originally from [[Xianbei]] origins they were part of the [[Kumo Xi]] tribe until 388 when the Kumo Xi-Khitan tribal grouping was defeated by the newly established [[Northern Wei]]. This allowed the Khitan to organize and consolidate their own tribe and entity which led to the beginning of Khitan written history.&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.258"&gt;Xu Elina-Qian, 258&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- 3/ 388-907 : Pre-Dynastic Khitan (own tribe, but always vassal) --&gt;
From the 5th to the 8th centuries the Khitan were dominated by the steppe powers to their West the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and then the [[Uyghurs]]. The [[Chinese people|Chinese]] also came from the south ([[Northern dynasties]] or [[Tang dynasty|Tang]]). In some cases they were under Korean domination (from the East, mainly [[Goguryeo]]) according to the balance of power at any given time. Under this triple domination the Khitan started to show growing power and independence. Their rise was slow compared to others because they were frequently crushed by neighbouring powers—each using the Khitan warriors when needed but ready to crush them when the Khitans became too powerful.&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.241"/&gt;

&lt;!-- 4/ 907-1125 : Dynastic Liao, the golden Age --&gt;
Enjoying the departure of the Uyghur people for the West and the collapse of the Tang dynasty in the early 10th century they established the Liao dynasty in 907. The [[Liao dynasty]] proved to be a significant power north of the [[Chinese plain]] as they were continuously moving south and West and gaining control over former Chinese and Turk-Uyghur's territories. They eventually fell to the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] of the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jurchen]] in 1125, who subordinated and absorbed the Khitans to their military benefit.&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.241"&gt;Xu Elina-Qian, p.241 and p.237&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- 5/ 1125-later : Errance and trivia --&gt;
Following the fall of the Liao Dynasty many Khitans moved further west and established the state of [[Qara Khitai]]. Their name survived in the Russian word for [[China]] (Китай, ''Kitay'') as well as the archaic [[English language|English]] ([[Cathay]]) [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (''Catai'') and the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (''Catay'') appellations of the name. They have been classified by [[China|Chinese]] [[historian]]s as one of the Eastern proto-[[Mongols|Mongolic]] ethnic groups – the [[Donghu people|Donghu]] ({{zh|s=东胡族|t=東胡族|p=Dōnghú zú}}).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

{{see also|Timeline of the Khitans}}
References to the [[Khitan people]] in [[China|Chinese]] sources date back to the 4th century. Ancestors of the Khitan were the [[Yuwen]] clan of the [[Xianbei]]; an [[ethnic group]] situated in the area covered by the modern [[Liaoning]] province. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} After their regime was conquered by the [[Murong]] clan the remnants scattered in the modern-day [[Inner Mongolia]] and mixed there with the original [[Mongols|Mongolic]] population.

== Pre-Dynastic Khitans (388–907) ==
They had been identified as a distinct [[ethnic group]] since paying tribute to the [[Northern Wei]] dynasty in the mid-6th century. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

During the time of the [[China|Chinese]] [[Tang dynasty]] the Khitan people were [[vassal]]s to the [[Suzerainty|suzerain]] Tang or Turks, depending on the balance of power between the two, or the suzerain [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] when they replaced the Turks as the main steppe power. Once the Uyghurs left their home in the Mongolian Plateau in 842 enough of a power vacuum was left to give the Khitan the opportunity to cast off the bonds of subordinacy. The Khitan occupied the areas vacated by the Uyghurs bringing them under their control.

=== Khitan's military activities from 388 to 618 ===
In the 5th century, the Khitan were under the Toba Wei influence.&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, military 388-618"&gt;To expand this section, please use Xu Elina-Qian, p.155–172, and CHOC-6, pp. 44–50&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 6th century, the Khitan tribes were still a weak confederation after being heavily defeated in 553 by the Northern Qi who enslaved many Khitans and seized a large part of their livestock,&lt;ref name="CHOC-6, p46"&gt;CHOC 6, p46&lt;/ref&gt; leading to harsh times for the Khitans. By that time the Khitan are still described as the lower level of nomadic civilization, their 'confederation' still being an anarchist system of isolated tribes, each tending his own sheep and horses and hunting on his private territory.&lt;ref name="CHOC-6, p46" /&gt; Some federal leaders were created after elections during a time of war after which it became a local power.&lt;ref name="CHOC-6, p47"&gt;CHOC-6, p47&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Sui dynasty was established in 581 when the Khitan were living in a period of internal military turmoil. Their tribes were fighting each other&lt;ref name="CHOC-6, p46" /&gt; perhaps as a result of Sui Wendi strategy to increase tensions between nomads in order to create internal divisions. In 586 some Khitans tribes submitted to the [[Eastern Tujue]] (Turks) while others submitted to the Sui.&lt;ref name="CHOC-6, p47" /&gt;

Notable Khitan raids on the Chinese Empire were record as early as the 7th century. In 605 they staged a large scale raid southward invading Sui territories (Northern modern Shanxi, Hebei).&lt;ref name="CHOC-6, p47" /&gt; They were eventually crushed by a [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] general leading 20,000 Turkish [[cavalry]].&lt;ref&gt;CIHofC, p.111&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military activities during the first half of the Tang dynasty (618–735) ===
====The Li-Sun Rebellion (696–697)====
[[File:Khitan Rebellion.png|thumb|500px|The rebellion of Li Jinzhong and Sun Wanrong]]
Under [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] (r. 626–649) the Khitans became vassals of Tang dynasty. Despite some occasional clashes, the Khitans remained Chinese vassals until the 690s when [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]] took the throne of China.&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.241"/&gt; According to the "[[Loose rein|Loose rein policy]]", the Khitan area was under Tang's control by Zhao Wenhui, the Governor-general of Yingzhou. Zhao was assisted by two local Khitan chieftains: [[Li Jinzhong]] ,the governor (Dudu) of Songmo protectorate, and Duke of Yongle County, [[Sun Wanrong]], who was the brother-in-law of Li Jinzhong.

Opposition rose because of the behaviour of Zhao Wenhui, who treated Khitan chieftains as his servants and refused to provide help during a famine that struck the Khitan area in 696. According to the "loose rein policy" the Tang Governor-general was supposed to provide famine relief. When Zhao Wenhui failed to do so, Li and Sun launched a Khitan rebellion in the fifth month of 696.&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.241" /&gt;

Li Jinzhong declared himself "Wushang Kehan" (無上可汗: "paramount khaghan") and killed Zhao Wenhui after capturing Yingzhou. Sun Wanrong assisted him as general who successfully led tens of thousands of troops marching southward and conquered several other towns of Tang dynasty.

The first significant Chinese response was to send an army led by twenty-eight generals, but they were defeated by Khitans in the Battle of Xiashi Gorge (near modern Lulong County of [[Hebei]] Province) in the eighth month of 696.&lt;!-- chief-generals Zhang Yuxuan and Ma Renjie were captured--&gt; Empress Wu was astonished by the announcement of the defeat and she quickly issued decrees to launch a new attack to the rebels. Khitans kept winning on the battlefields until Li Jinzhong died of disease. The rising power of the Khitans also threatened the newly established[[Göktürk|Later Turk Khanate]] (a.k.a. Second Tujue Empire, 682–745) and the khagan [[Ashina Mochuo]], who had supported the Khitan rebellion, switched to Empress Wu's side after the Chinese gave him several promises including an imperial marriage for his daughter, adoption as the son of Empress Wu, the relocating of his people to ([[Hexi Corridor]]) and the restoration of Turkish overlordship of the Khitans.&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.241" /&gt;

The second major counter-attack from Empress Wu to the Khitans came in October 696, taking advantage of the recent death of Li Jingzhong. This time, Tang forces planned to attack Khitan from the south and the Turks would also invade Khitan from north. The Khitans suffered heavy losses in this campaign, but Sun Wanrong managed to stand still and motivated the Khitan troops. The rebellion of Khitans continued and Sun Wanrong's men stormed into Jizhou and Yingzhou, shaking the whole region of [[Hebei]]. Empress Wu sent one of his best generals, [[Wang Xiaojie]], assisted by Su Honghui and some other top warriors, with a third army of 170,000 men, to put down the rebellon. Due to the unfamiliarity to the local geography and terrains, Wang Xiaojie's force was ambushed by Sun Wanrong at the Dongxia Rocky Valley (东峡石谷).&lt;!--''Not sure of the relevance +peacocking'': who were masters both on the battlefield and on ambuscades. --&gt; Wang Xiaojie was killed while Su Honghui fled away. After that, Khitans captured Youzhou (near today's [[Beijing]]), which was an important gateway to the northern plain of China.&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.241" /&gt;

In a fourth campaign during May 697, Empress Wu sent [[Lou Shide]] and Shatuo Zhongyi with 200,000 troops to stop Sun Wanrong's from going further south. Khitans tried to ask for reinforcement from Turks. However, Turks refused the proposed Khitan-Turk alliance. Instead, they somehow allied with Empress Wu and launched a massive attack on Khitans. Meanwhile, Kumo Xi, another minority group who initially allied with Khitan in this rebellion, switched to Tang. Khitans had to face devastating Turkish raids from the north while a 200,000-men Chinese and Xi allied force attacking from the south. In this critical situation, Sun Wanrong was assassinated by one of his own subordinates, and the Khitan force collapsed. After this rebellion, Khitans began a new allegiance with the Turks as Mochou Khaghan and the Empress Wu had planned early in 696. Empress Wu also appointed a new Khitan chieftain, whose name was Li Shihuo (697–717, [李]失活).&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.241" /&gt;

Consequently, Turks broke away with Empress Wu (who handed the crown back to the royal clan of Tang in 705). Tang launched several campaigns against them from 700 to 714 and eventually the khanate of Turks was overthrown by [[Uighurs]] who was supported by Tang dynasty.&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.241" /&gt;

====The Li-Sun rebellion and the Turks====
The Turks played a major role in crushing a rebellion in military actions and in a strategic role as well.&lt;!--''Not really encyclopaedic writing'' :  (attacking on the rear!). It is to understand the Turkish situation. --&gt; The Turks were to submit to China in 630 after their first Turkish Empire was crushed. In 679 during a period of Chinese internal political turmoil they revolted. They were defeated by Tang troops in 681 in a [[Pyrrhic victory]], also, the remaining Eastern Turks reunited under [[Ashina Guduolu]] (died 691) who was able to proclaim the rebirth of the Turkish empire without Tang's reaction.&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.243"&gt;Xu Elina-Qian, p.243–245&lt;/ref&gt;

When Li-Sun died his brother Mochuo replaced him and engaged the Turks in an aggressive policy of "plunder to strengthen" as the best way to revitalize his Empire. The Turks plundered all their neighbour, the Khitan and Chinese included, but encouraged the Khitans to rebel against Tang rule. Almost as soon as the Khitan rebelled and were successful the Turks proposed an alliance with China. The Turks, engaged in a war against China, were just asking the Khitans for a diversion in the east allowing them to be more free on their front. When the Khitans unexpectedly appeared to be successful they both were surprised and afraid at seeing a new power born on their East. Seeing the Khitans fighting hard against the Chinese seemed the perfect occasion to take advantage of both the busy Khitan and the downtrodden Tang. By attacking Khitan on their rear the Turks provided an inestimable help to Tang which also worked for themselves by crushing that eastern rising power.&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.243" /&gt;

While the fourth Chinese campaign was still not launched, and despite previous propositions of alliance, the Turks attacked the Chinese territories to show clearly they were strong  in the third month of 697. Along with the final victory they freed some Turkish prisoners held in six Chinese northern border prefectures since 670–674, gained the submission of both the Khitan and the Xi, plundered a large amount of [[Grain|seed-grain]], [[silk]], farming implements and [[iron]] as well as winning noble titles for the Mochou khaghan (such as General, Khaghan and other noble ranks) and the asked for imperial marriage.&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.243" /&gt;

====The Ketuyu rebellion (720–734)====
In the 710s the Khitan military chief [[Ketuyu]] (可突于) was so valiant and beloved by Khitan's commoners that the Khitan King Suogu (李娑固 Li Suogu, r. 718–720) became both jealous of him and in fear of a take-over. Accordingly, he plotted to assassinate Ketuyu. As is often the case the plot was disclosed and Ketuyu's troops attacked the King who fled to Yingzhou to get Chinese support.&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.245"&gt;Xu Elina-Qian, p.245–248&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Xu Qinzhan (許欽?&lt;ref&gt;Xu Elina-Qian, p.293a&lt;/ref&gt;), the Chinese Governor-General of Yingzhou, immediately called for a punitive military campaign ordering General Xue Tai assisted by 500 valiant soldier,&lt;ref&gt;XTS 43. 1119 and 37. 930. Xu Elena-Qian also talk about « a tens of thousand strong army was being mobilized from Guanzhong to reinforce this operation » (37. 930.). But did them were on the battlefield when Li Dapu (Xi King) and Li Suogu (Khitan dethroned King) were killed ?&lt;/ref&gt; Xi troops, and Suogu troops to go northwards. The Chinese-loyalist army was crushed and both Suogu (Khitan King) and Li Dapu (Xi King) were killed while Xue Tai was captured by Ketuyu. In hope of resuming good relations with the Chinese Tai was not executed and an envoy was sent to humbly apologize while Ketuyu enthroned Suogu's cousin Yuyu (李鬱于, 720-722/724).&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.245" /&gt;

Peaceful relations were restored and when Ketuyu made a second coup to face the new king Tuyu&lt;sup&gt;(or Yuyu?)&lt;/sup&gt; suspicions, the Tang court peacefully confirmed the newly enthroned king Shaogu (李邵固 Li Shaogu, 725–730) who on his side displayed respect for Tang's wishes of appeasement.&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.245" /&gt;

In 730 Ketuyu went to present tributes to [[Chang'an]] but was mistreated by [[Chancellor of the Tang dynasty|chancellor]] [[Li Yuanhong (Tang chancellor)|Li Yuanhong]]. Back in the Khitan territories Ketuyu assassinated the pro-Tang Shaogu in the fifth month of 730 and switched the allegiance of his subjects, and of the Xi tribes, from Tang to the Türks sending a clear message to Tang. Ketuyu then attacked Pinglu (part of Yingzhou&lt;!-- commandery ? prefecture ?--&gt;) where a defensive army of Tang's was stationed. The Chang'an officials were panicked by the vision of a new Khitan rebellion and ordered Prince of Zhong Jun, as commander in chief assisted by 18 generals, to go north with warriors recruited from as far as Guannei, [[Hedong Commandery|Hedong]], [[Henan]] and [[Hebei]] to crush this Khitan-Xi rebellion.&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.245" /&gt;&lt;!-- «Chinese general Wu Chengci in Mount Nalu». : what did he ?--&gt;

In the third month of 732 the Khitan-Xi troops were defeated by the Prince of Xin'an and Ketuyu had to flee while Li Shi Suogao, the Xi king, betrayed him submitting to Tang with his 5,000 subjects&lt;ref&gt;Note: what is this ? it was just 5,000 Xi at this time ?&lt;/ref&gt; getting the titles of the Prince of Guiyi (allegiance and righteousness) and prefect of Guiyi Zhou with the Xi allowed to settle in Youzhou under Chinese protection.

A second major campaign came in  the fourth month of 733 when Guo Yingjie was ordered to lead 10,000 troops, assisted by Xi warriors, to crush Khitan. Ketuyu came first with Turkish support putting the Chinese-Xi troops in difficulty forcing the Xi to flee to save themselves. Predictably Guo Yingjie and his men, left alone to face the Khitan-Turkish troops, lost with heavy casualties. Guo and most of his men were killed on the battlefield. One year later the Khitan were defeated by Zhang Shougui, regional commander of Youzhou in the second month of 734.&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.245" /&gt;

Ketuyu, seeing the Khitan forces exhausted by repetitive Tang campaigns, pretended to surrender in the twelfth month of 734 and was murdered, together with his puppet King Qulie (李屈列 Li Qulie 730–734), by his subordinate Li Guozhe (李過折). Li Guozhe was soon himself assassinated in favor of a Ketuyu clan restoration.

====Origins of the Ketuyu Rebellion====
While traditional scholars explain this Ketuyu Rebellion as a typically barbarian reaction modern historians are more cautious. Both the Chinese Liao expert Shu Fen and the Japanese Matsui Hitoshi are inclined to think that Chinese lenient policy encouraged Ketuyu's arrogance.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
In contrast, Xu Elian-Qian supports the theory that Chinese interferences in Khitan internal changes caused the aggression to Ketuyu's reactions. That may be true for the conflict of 720 and the aggressive Chinese behaviour&lt;!--''What does this mean?'': ingerence tentative --&gt;. But this opinion does not explain the Chinese appeasement policy in  725 where the Chinese let Ketuyu kill the Khitan king and enthrone a new one. When Ketuyu was personally mistreated, in Chang'an in 730, this resentment led him to choose the larger of consequence of diplomatic opposition by turning his submission to the Turks. This was predictably understood by Chang'an as a first magnitude treason which could not be tolerated and lead to the ensuing five years of war to recapture them. Shu and Matsui do not see this Chinese reaction as an aggressive interference but rather as a predictable interference caused by Ketuyu's arrogant reaction&lt;!--?: turn face --&gt; to the recent lenient policy.&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.245" /&gt;

Xu explains that the Khitans were at a turning point. The Dahe family collapsing as an after-shock of the Li-Sun Rebellion while the Yaonian family was growing by organizing a new confederation of alliances. Accordingly, this period was rich in turmoil. The opposition may have come from the respective perceived definition of the [[Loose rein]] agreement. In times of weakness in the central power, such as in the 680's, this loose rein policy meant largely independence for the subordinate population who chose their own chief etc. In times of strong central power, as under [[Tang Xuanzong]] (r. 712–756), the central Chinese power was inclined to impose pro-Chinese choices, including in choice of Kings and major chiefs, despite the previous loose rein agreement. Also in prosperous times such as Xuanzong's reign, and his courage in facing the 720's coup, Tang officials immediately sent an army to support the dethroned pro-Tang king clearly interfering in Khitan internal affairs.&lt;ref name="Xu Elina-Qian, p.245" /&gt;

The 730–734 war seems to have been the consequence of both Chinese revitalized foreign policy, Khitan internal turmoil and associated oppression of Ketuyu and the miscalculations made by him.&lt;!-- but how explain the [725 appaissement from Chinese ? I have difficulties to agree with Xu Elena-Qian's &lt;u&gt;contrary&lt;/u&gt; conclusions that the interventionist foreign policy of the Tang court not only provoked Ketuyu's revolt, but also intensified and escalated those conflicts during this period. --&gt;

=== An Lushan era (750s) ===

[[Image:China, 742.svg|thumb|300px|right|Tang China and [[History of the political divisions of China#Provinces under the Tang dynasty|Tang provinces]] by 742. The aggressive An Lushan harassed continuously the Khitan to up their own aggressiveness, get more support from [[Chang'an]], and strengthen himself.]]

====Rise of An Lushan and Chinese-on-Khitan hostilities====
By the 730s regional commanders already have largely autonomy of initiative to face neighbouring threats and accordingly boundary wars and rebellions are understood by many scholars as the full responsibility of local general commanders.

In the third month of 736 Zhang Shougui, the general commander of Youzhou, sent his protected [[An Lushan]], an officer of the Pinglu Army (平盧軍) based in modern Chaoyang who was said to know 6 languages of Chinese, to attack Khitan and the Xi rebels but An Lushan made an overtly audacious attack which cost him almost all of his troops. He escaped the usual execution for such disobedience cases in part because of Zhangs affection for him and in part thanks to Emperor Xuanzong who, overviewing [[death penalty]] cases, believed that his audacious and mid-barbarian character should not pay by death.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ214&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷214|vol. 214]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Youzhou soon became the ''Bingmashi'' (兵馬使) ''of the Pinglu Army'' in the seventh month of 741. He carefully cultivated relationships with other officials and generals to earn praises and bribed Imperial messengers to include him in their reports. As the consequence of this systematic bribery he was promoted to ''commandant at Yingzhou'' (Ying prefecture) and ''[[Jiedushi]]'' (''military governor'') of the Pinglu army&lt;ref&gt;The Pinglu Army under his leadership being promote to be a military circuit, is Bingmashi rank was upgraded to Jiedushi rank (military governor).&lt;/ref&gt; in 742 to face and defeat the northern threat from Khitans, Xi, [[Balhae]] and [[Heishui Mohe]].&lt;ref name=ZZTJ214/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZZTJ215&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷215|vol. 215]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was made military governor of Fanyang Circuit (范陽, headquartered in modern Beijing) in 744 plundering Khitan and Xi villages to display his military abilities. This continuous harassment of Khitan is understood by some scholars as provocation to the Khitan aggressiveness and the threat aimed to get more troops from Chang'an for his future rebellion as well as the reason for the 745 Khitan-Xi rebellion.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ215/&gt;

As commander of the northeastern frontier in 744–755 An Lushan organised military operations against the Khitan-Xi nomads. His motivation was to curry favour with the Tang court and probably also to obtain more troops. He needed these for his subsequent campaigns to defeat what he saw as the enormous threat presented by the northeastern "babarians" amongst who the Khitan were the most significant. He may also have been motivated by thoughts of preparing for his future rebellion of 755–763.

====745s Khitan rebellion====
In the third month of 745 several Tang princesses were married to Khitan's leaders in a sign of appeassment. But for some reason&lt;ref&gt;what?&lt;/ref&gt; the Khitans soon turned into an open rebellion against Tang in the ninth month of 745 killing the princesses and starting military operations. Huge previous pressures from An Lushan combined with the Chang'an courts praise for him may have been seen Khitan as presenting an impasse against which they eventually revolted.

The Khitans were quickly defeated by An Lushan's toops by punitive expeditions and traps. Sources report that Banquets for a peace declaration were set up by An Lushan and offered to Khitan and Xi who,happy to get both peace and free provisions, rushed to the buffet and drunk heavily. It turned out that the food and wine were poisoned by narcotics. An Lushan then led his warriors to kill all of those who were sleeping on the ground or drunk enough to be easy to kill and the Chiefs' heads were sent to the Tang court for display. Sources have said that each of such Banquets ended with the death of thousands of warriors. This claim is difficult to believe: can Khitan have been that naive to let An Lushan kill thousands of them, several times, in the same kind of "free food traps". The difficulty is that Chinese sources seem biased against An Lushan depicting him by this story as a terrible untrustable enemy. The final result was that Khitan's 745 rebellion was crushed.

====751–752s wars to 755s An Shi rebellion====
In 751–752, following [[An Lushan]]'s provocations and harassment, the Khitans moved south to attack the Chinese Tang Empire. Accordinglys Khitan were soon subject to a Chinese campaign in the  eighth month of 751: An Lushan assisted by 2,000 Xi guides leading 60,000 Chinese troops into Khitan territories. When the fighting started the Xi suddenly turned their support to Khitan and the Khitan-Xi army then quickly pushed against the Tang armies who were hampered by rains. The Khitan-Xi army killed almost all the enemy soldiers while An Lushan escaped to Shizhou with just twenty cavalrymen. The defending general Su Dingfang, a Tang general, was eventually able to stop the Khitan pursuit troops which retreated. They had their battlefield victory, although not An Lushan's head, and so they laid siege to the city which only Shi Siming (one An Lushan's general) was able to end. One of his generals was killed in action and, after retreating, he blamed and executed the other two for the defeat.

In 752, to punish this audacity and insult, a 200,000 strong army including both Chinese and barbarian infantry and cavalry went northwards to meet the Khitan. But while An Lushan requested that the ethnically Tujue general Li Xianzhong (李獻忠) accompany him Li feared An and, when compelled to, rebelled putting a halt to An's campaign.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ216/&gt; After three years in the  month fourth of 755 An announced his victory about which historical records are not very clear. By this time An Lushan was already engaged in an opposition to the Yang clan located in Chang'an which turned around his system of alliances. Put into an impasse [[An Shi Rebellion|he rose into rebellion]] and had to walk southwards to quickly beat the unprotected heartland of the Tang territories. In this movement he looked for assistance from the northern nomads: Tujue, Uighurs, Khitan, Xi and Shiwei. All, to some extent, assisted his troops and his rebellion, Khitan principally by his previously taken prisoners'. But the Khitan were exhausted and took little part in these campaigns.

;Background reasons of these oppositions
The continuous agitation of Khitans on the northeast of the Empire, maintained by An Lushan actions, provided An Lushan more and more support troops from [[Chang'an]] for his own power and ambitions growing to 160,000–200,000 men. This was caused by several factors:
* An Lushan seemed to be a clever military official especially skilled to set up good relationships with his superiors, whatever by systematic brides (as say sources) or by his possible real abilities;
* An Lushan was skilled to both: up Khitan's aggressivity, enlarge the threat in his rapports, and trap/crush them, getting large praises
* the time (740s) was an apogee of prosperity, the treasury was full, the Chinese Empire was at a maximum of extension, Xuanzong and Chang'an officials sur-estimated their own power and displayed growing mark of lazy behaviour and management: waste of financial resources, lack of troops in the Central area;
* in Chang'an, the high chancellor [[Li Linfu]], facing to the rise of the Yang clan in Chang'an, wanted both to resist the Khitans' pressure and counterbalance the growing influence of the Yang clan in Chang'an affairs.

Accordingly, An Lushan's power strengthened with associated pressure on the Khitan.

The turning point came when An became worried about the post of Xuanzong-Li Linfu (An Lushan add "get their favor", but at the cost of relations with other officials). Noticing that the heart of the empire was without defenses An considered to plan a rebellion. He selected a dozen able generals and some 8,000 soldiers from amongst the surrendered Khitan, Xi, and [[Tongluo]] (同羅) tribesmen organizing them into an elite corps known as the ''Yeluohe'' (曵落河, "the brave").&lt;ref name=ZZTJ216&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷216|vol. 216]]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Li Linfu died and [[Yang Guozhong]], a Yang clan member, replaced him as high chancellor An Lushan rose in rebellion with his armies and attacked the central power with Khitan, Xi and Turkish supporters.&lt;!--?:  Then only leaving Khitan. --&gt;

=== 2nd half of the Tang dynasty (763–907) ===
;Middle of Tang's dynasty
The Khitan were concentrating themselves on their own development and were relatively peaceful.

;Uighurs domination and Khitans state
When the Turks where overthrown by the Uighurs in 745 the war-loving power of the Turks was replaced by the commerce-loving Uighurs. The control that the Uighurs had on the Khitans were of a different kind. Uighurs were focusing on economic exchanges, were the protectors of the diplomatic stability and left large political and internal freedom to their vassals. The Khitans used this to keep a peaceful environment helping to strengthen all their demographic, economic and structural force.

For their demographic the main point was the choice to avoid foreign conflicts. The new "Steppe Lords" were relatively peaceful while the Tang dynasty was later greatly weakened by the An-Shi rebellion of 755–763 providing a new intra-China situation with a weak center and with provincial generals pacification and strengthening of their respective provinces. In this context the Khitans and their close-relatives the [[Kumo Xi|Xi]] had opposite strategies. Kumo Xi kept a relatively aggressive foreign policy slowly exhausting their forces. The Khitans chose to stay as a calm self-defensive power enjoying most of the Manchurian plain and working to improve their daily situation. While previous centuries had seen successive Turko-Chinese provocations or recall to obeisance, and the following wars had prevented Khitan gaining any notable expansion, the 8th-century situation eventually allowed one. This demographic growth would strongly support the other qualitative changes.
&lt;!--
Demographic.
Economic development: yaolian family, etc.
State building: centralisation of the powers, strengthen the military chief, stop the democratic heridity, set up administration and own prisons.

==Liao dynasty, The Golden Age (907–1125)==
[[File:Liao Dynasty in 1025.jpeg|thumb|left|300px|Liao dynasty in 1025]]
[[Image:LiaoMask10-12thcentury.jpg|thumb|[[Liao dynasty|Liao]] funerary mask, 10th–12th centuries]]
{{main|Liao dynasty}}

The Liao dynasty was founded in 907 when [[Abaoji]], posthumously known as [[Emperor Taizu of Liao|Emperor Taizu]], was named the leader of the Khitan nation. Even though the Great Liao dynasty was not declared until the 947 it is generally said to have begun with the elevation of Abaoji to emperor.

Though Abaoji died in 926 the dynasty would last nearly two more centuries. Five cities were designated as capitals during that dynasty. In addition to the supreme capital in the heartland of Khitan territory there were four regional capitals. One of which was [[Beijing]] which became a capital for the first time in its history. It was not the principle capital of the dynasty but rather was designated as the southern capital after the Khitan acquired the contentious [[Sixteen Prefectures]] in 935.

Abaoji introduced a number of innovations – some more successful than others. He divided the empire into two parts: one was governed based on nomadic models while the sedentary population was governed largely in accordance with Chinese techniques. Less successful was the attempted introduction of primogeniture in succession to the throne. Although he desired his eldest son to be heir he did not succeed Abaoji.

Abaoji was "afraid that their use of Chinese advisers and administrative techniques would blur their own ethnic identity, the Khitan made a conscious effort to retain their own tribal rites, food, and clothing and refused to use the [[Chinese language]], devising a [[Khitan script|writing system for their own language]] instead."&lt;ref&gt;2006 ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2016}} The first of these two scripts was created in 920. The second, based on alphabetic principles, was created five years later.

==Post Liao dynasty history==
{{Main|Qara Khitai}}
The Khitans were absorbed by the Jurchens and widely used in the following years of war to conquer the northern Song territories.

In contrast a number of the nobles of the Liao dynasty escaped the area towards the [[Western Regions]] establishing the short-lived Qara Khitai or Western Liao dynasty. They were in turn absorbed by the local Turkic and Iranian populations and left no influence of themselves. As the [[Khitan language]] is still almost completely illegible it is difficult to create a detailed history of their movements. The Khitans were mainly employed by the Mongols in military and civil services after they conquered most of Eurasia. [[Daur people]] and some Baarin people are direct descendants of the Khitans.&lt;ref&gt;Inner Mongolian "Odon" television&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Eastern front, Khitans elements fled the [[Mongols]] offensives toward Korea. In 1216 the [[Khitan people|Khitans]] invaded [[Goryeo]] and defeated the Korean armies multiple times, even reaching the gates of the capital and raiding deep into the south, but were defeated by Korean General [[Kim Chwi-ryeo]] who pushed them back north to [[Pyongan Province|Pyongan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kim Chwi-ryeo|url=http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Index?contents_id=E0010816|website=Encyclopedia of Korean Culture|publisher=Academy of Korean Studies|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Goryeosa: Volume 103|url=https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hant/%E9%AB%98%E4%B8%BD%E5%8F%B2103%E5%8D%B7|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the remaining Khitans were finished off by allied Mongol-Goryeo forces in 1219.&lt;ref name="EbreyWalthall2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patricia Ebrey|author2=Anne Walthall|title=Pre-Modern East Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History, Volume I: To 1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6F2XLmIVAaYC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=khitan+defeated+goryeo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAWoVChMIz_yL7Ny3xwIVwz4-Ch3Oyw1R#v=onepage&amp;q=khitan%20defeated%20goryeo&amp;f=false|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-133-60651-2|pages=177–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ki-Baik|title=A New History of Korea|date=1984|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=067461576X|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Khitans are possibly the origin of the [[Baekjeong]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3830">'''Hugh Williams''' (1843–1911) was a Welsh church historian and college tutor, known also as a Presbyterian minister.

==Life==
The son of Hugh Williams (d. 1905, aged ninety-two), carrier and small freeholder, of [[Menai Bridge]], [[Anglesey]], by his wife Jane, he was born at [[Porthaethwy]] in Anglesey on 17 September 1843. He had schooling there and at [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]], and for some years worked as a mason, while continuing studies.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB12|wstitle=Williams, Hugh|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864 Williams entered the [[Calvinistic Methodist College, Bala]], where he acted (1867–9) as one of the tutors. He graduated B.A. London in 1870 (first in second class honours in classics); M.A. London in 1871 (second in philosophy honours). He then ran a grammar school at Menai Bridge, at the same time ministering to Calvinistic Methodists in Anglesey, and was ordained without charge (1873) in the presbyterian church of Wales. Appointed professor of Greek and mathematics at Bala in August 1873, he entered on his duties in the following year. In the vacation of 1874 he visited Germany for the study of the language. When the Bala College became purely theological (1891), he was appointed professor of church history.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In 1903 Williams was moderator of the North Wales assembly of the presbyterian church. On 19 April 1904 he received the degree of D.D. in Glasgow University. He was for some time troubled with a form of laryngitis. He preached every Sunday, though not reckoned a popular preacher, and conducted a weekly bible class. He was a member of the theological board and court of the [[University of Wales]]; also of the council of the Bangor College.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

After suffering for nearly two years from arterial disease, Williams died at Bala on 11 May 1911, and was buried in the churchyard of [[Llanycil]], Merionethshire.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Williams made a reputation with his edition of ''Gildas, with English translation and notes'', pt. i. 1899; pt. ii. 1901 (Cymrodorion Record series). Magazine articles and papers prepared the way for his major work, ''Christianity in Early Britain'', which was issued by the Clarendon press in February 1912: ''Some Aspects of the Christian Church in Wales in the Fifth and Sixth Centuries'' (1895); ''The Four Disciples of Illtud'' (1897); the article on the Welsh church in the new edition (1889–96) of the ''Encyclopædia Cambrensis'' (''Gwyddoniadur Cymreig''); a review of [[Heinrich Zimmer]]'s ''Keltische Kirche'' (1901) and ''Pelagius in Irland'' (1901) in the ''Zeitschrift für Celtische Philologie'' (1903); and the article "Church (British)" in the ''[[Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics]]'' (1910). He had outlined his findings in his Davies lecture, delivered at [[Birkenhead]] on 8 June 1905.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Williams published in Welsh, including:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

* ''Yr Epistol at y Colossiaid'', Bala, 1886. 
* ''Yr Epistol at y Galatiaid: cyfiethiad newydd'' [together with that of 1620] ''… a nodiadau. Gyda map'', Bala, 1892 (this and the preceding were new and annotated versions for Sunday school use). 
* ''Y Sacramentau: anerchiad agoriadol'', Bala, 1894. 
* ''De Imitatione Christi … Rhagdraeth'', Bala, 1907 (the introduction only was by Williams).

He also edited [[Lewis Edwards]]'s ''Holiadau Athrawiaethol'', Bala, 1897.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

[[File:Humanzoogermany.jpg|upright|thumb|400px|An ad for a "Peoples Show" (''Völkerschau'') in [[Stuttgart]] (Germany), 1928]]
'''Human zoos''', also called '''ethnological expositions''', were 19th-, 20th-, and 21st-century public exhibitions of humans, usually in a so-called natural or primitive state. The displays often emphasized the cultural differences between Europeans of [[Western world|Western civilization]] and non-European peoples or with other Europeans who practiced a lifestyle deemed more primitive. Some of them placed [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] populations in a continuum somewhere between the [[great ape]]s and Europeans. Ethnological expositions have been extensively criticized and ascertained as highly degrading and [[Racism|racist]], depending on the show and individuals involved.

== Human zoos in Germany ==

{{refimprove section|date=June 2018}}
In the late 19th century German ethnographic museums&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Objects of Culture Ethnology and Ethnographic Museums in Imperial Germany|last=H. Glenn|first=Penny|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were an attempt at empirical study of human culture. They contained artifacts from cultures around the world organized by continent allowing visitors to see the similarities and differences between the groups and form their own ideas. The ethnographic museums of Germany were explicitly designed to steer away from projecting certain principles or instructing its viewers to interpret the material in a particular manner. They were instead left open for museum guests to form their own opinions.

The directors of Germany's ethnographic museums intended to create a unifying history of mankind,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to show how humans had progressed to the cosmopolitan creatures that walked the halls of these museums. Imperialism influenced the supporters, visitors, and collectors of these museums, the displays, directions, and political rhetoric.

Ethnology studies in Germany took a new approach in the 1870s as human displays were incorporated into zoos. These exhibits were lauded as educational to the general population by the scientific community of the time, because they were informing of the way people lived across the world. Very quickly the exhibits were used as a way to show that Europeans had evolved into a superior cosmopolitan life.

As Ethnogenic expositions were discontinued in Germany around 1931,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/human-zoos-when-people-were-the-exhibits/a-37748193 Ethnogenic expositions were discontinued in Germany around 1931]&lt;/ref&gt; there were many repercussions for the performers. Many of the people brought from their homelands to work in the exhibits had created families in Germany, and there were many children that had been born in Germany. Once they no longer worked in the zoos or for performance acts these people were stuck living in Germany where they had no rights and were harshly discriminated against. During the rise of the Nazi party the foreign actors in these stage shows were typically able to stay out of concentration camps because there were so few of them that the Nazis did not see them as a real threat.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;“‘You Better Go Back to Africa’| Interview.” ''"You Better Go Back to Africa"| Interview'', DW English, 18 June 2017, www.youtube.com/watch?v=baGXUsOKBcU.&lt;/ref&gt; Although they were able to avoid concentration camps, they were not able to participate in German life as citizens of ethnically German origin could. The [[Hitler Youth]] did not allow children of foreign parents to participate, and adults were rejected as German soldiers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many ended up working in war industry factories or foreign laborer camps.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After [[World War II|WWII]] ended, racism in Germany became more concealed or invisible but did not go away. Many people of foreign descent intended to leave after the war, but because of their German nationality, it was difficult for them to emigrate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Key influences ===
[[Carl Hagenbeck]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Savages and Beasts: The Birth of the Modern Zoo|last=Rothfels|first=Nigel|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a German exotic animal businessman, who became famous for his conquering of the animal trade market during the mid to late 1800’s. Due to the costs of acquiring and keeping animals, the financial implications started to worry Hagenbeck, and he began looking for other ways to alleviate the company’s monetary strains. [[Heinrich Leutemann]], an old friend of Hagenbeck suggested bringing along the people from the foreign lands to accompany the animals. The idea struck Hagenbeck as brilliant and he had a group of [[Sami people|Laplander]]s accompany his next shipment of Reindeer. They set up traditional houses and went about their business as usual on the Hagenbeck property. The display was so successful that Carl was organizing his second show before the first was over. Although the concept of parading peoples captured from conquered lands goes back to the Romans, Hagenbeck claimed to have the first show’s displaying “cultures” from foreign lands. Carl Hagenbeck continued to bring indigenous people along with the animals he was importing from across the globe. The people would come with their hunting equipment, homes, and other facets of their daily life. Hagenbeck’s displays evolved in complexity as the years went by. In 1876 Hagenbeck had a group of 6 [[Sami people|Sami]] accompany a herd of reindeer, and by 1874 his acts included close to 67 men, women, and children in his ''Ceylon'' show performing with 25 elephants. The performances also expanded from showing every day activities such as milking reindeer and building huts, to displaying some of the more extravagant parts of the cultures such as magicians, jugglers, and devil dancers.

The notion of the human curiosity has a history at least as long as [[History of colonialism|colonialism]]. For instance, in the [[Western Hemisphere]], one of the earliest-known [[zoo]]s, that of [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuma]] in Mexico, consisted not only of a vast collection of animals, but also exhibited humans, for example, dwarves, albinos and hunchbacks.&lt;ref&gt;Mullan, Bob and Marvin Garry, ''Zoo culture: The book about watching people watch animals'', [[University of Illinois Press]], [[Urbana, Illinois]], Second edition, 1998, p.32. {{ISBN|0-252-06762-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]], the [[Medici]] developed a large [[menagerie]] in the Vatican.
In the 16th century, Cardinal [[Ippolito de' Medici|Hippolytus Medici]] had a collection of people of different races as well as exotic animals.
He is reported as having a troupe of so-called Savages, speaking over twenty languages; there were also Moors, Tartars, Indians, Turks and Africans.&lt;ref&gt;Mullan, Bob and Marvin Garry, ''Zoo culture: The book about watching people watch animals'', [[University of Illinois Press]], [[Urbana, Illinois]], Second edition, 1998, p.98. {{ISBN|0-252-06762-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maximo and Bartola CDV by Edmonds of Southampton, c1867.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Maximo and Bartola, c. 1867]] One of the first modern public human exhibitions was [[P. T. Barnum|P.T. Barnum]]'s exhibition of [[Joice Heth]] on February 25, 1835&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/joiceheth.html|title=The Museum of Hoaxes|work=Museum of Hoaxes|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, subsequently, the [[Conjoined twins|Siamese twins]] [[Chang and Eng Bunker]]. These exhibitions were common in [[freak show]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://migs.concordia.ca/occpapers/zoo.htm "On A Neglected Aspect Of Western Racism"] by Kurt Jonassohn, December 2000, Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies&lt;/ref&gt; Another famous example was that of [[Saartjie Baartman]] of the [[Nama people|Namaqua]], often referred to as the Hottentot Venus, who was displayed in London and France until her death in 1815.

During the 1850s, [[Maximo and Bartola]], two [[microcephalic]] children from El Salvador, were exhibited in the US and Europe under the names Aztec Children and Aztec Lilliputians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberto Aguirre]], ''Informal Empire: Mexico And Central America In Victorian Culture'', Univ. of Minnesota Press, 2004, ch. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  However, human zoos would become common only in the 1870s in the midst of the [[New Imperialism]] period.

== 1870s to the 1930s ==

In the 1870s, exhibitions of exotic populations became popular in various countries. Human zoos could be found in [[Paris]], [[Hamburg]], [[Antwerp]], [[Barcelona]], [[London]], [[Milan]], and [[New York City]]. [[Carl Hagenbeck]], a merchant in wild animals and future entrepreneur of many zoos in Europe, decided in 1874 to exhibit [[Samoans|Samoan]] and [[Sami people]] as "purely natural" populations. In 1876, he sent a collaborator to the Egyptian [[Sudan]] to bring back some wild beasts and [[Nubians]]. The Nubian exhibit was very successful in Europe and toured Paris, London, and [[Berlin]]. In 1880, Hagenbeck dispatched an agent to Labrador to secure a number of Esquimaux (Eskimo / [[Inuit]]) from the moravian mission of Hebron; these Inuit were exhibited in his [[Hamburg Tierpark]]. Other ethnological expositions included Egyptian and Bedouin mock settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Belvedere: Zeitschrift für bildende Kunst, Volume 12|date=2006|publisher=Österreichische Galerie Belvedere|page=102|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=nChMAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagenbeck would also employ agents to take part in his ethnological exhibits, with the aim of exposing his audience to various different subsistence modes and lifestyles. Among these hired workers were Hersi Egeh and his lineage from Berbera in present-day northwestern Somalia, who in the process accumulated much wealth, which they later reinvested in real estate in their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Africana Publishing Company|journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies|date=1985|page=20|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=NXgMAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The viceroy of India likewise gave Hagenbeck permission to hire local inhabitants for an exhibit, on the condition that Hagenbeck would first have to deposit funds into the royal treasury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Janet M.|title=The Circus Age: Culture and Society under the American Big Top|date=2003|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=0807861499|page=198|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=FDzqCQAAQBAJ|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy de Saint-Hilaire]], director of the [[Jardin d'acclimatation]], decided in 1877 to organize two ethnological spectacles that presented Nubians and [[Inuit]]. That year, the audience of the Jardin d'acclimatation' doubled to one million. Between 1877 and 1912, approximately thirty ethnological exhibitions were presented at the ''Jardin zoologique d'acclimatation''.

Both the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878]] and the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 Parisian World's Fair]] presented a Negro Village (''village nègre''). Visited by 28 million people, the 1889 World's Fair displayed 400 indigenous people as the major attraction. The 1900 World's Fair presented the famous [[diorama]] living in [[Madagascar]], while the [[Colonial exhibition|Colonial Exhibitions]] in [[Marseille]]s (1906 and 1922) and in Paris (1907 and 1931) also displayed humans in cages, often nude or semi-nude. The [[Paris Colonial Exposition|1931 exhibition in Paris]] was so successful that 34 million people attended it in six months, while a smaller counter-exhibition entitled ''The Truth on the Colonies'', organized by the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]], attracted very few visitors—in the first room, it recalled [[Albert Londres]] and [[André Gide]]'s critiques of [[unfree labour|forced labour]] in the colonies. Nomadic [[Senegal|Senegalese Villages]] were also presented.

In 1883, native people of [[Suriname]] were displayed in the [[Internationale Koloniale en Uitvoerhandel Tentoonstelling|International Colonial and Export Exhibition]] in Amsterdam, held behind the [[Rijksmuseum]].

In the late 1800s, Hagenbeck organized exhibitions of indigenous populations from various parts of the globe. He staged a public display in 1886 of [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] autochthones from the [[Sri Lanka]]. In 1893/1894, he also put together an exhibition of [[Sami people|Sami]]/Lapps in [[Hamburg]]-Saint Paul.

In 1896, to increase the number of visitors, the [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden|Cincinnati Zoo]] invited one hundred Sioux Native Americans to establish a village at the site. The Sioux lived at the zoo for three months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=685 Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden], Ohio Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, [[Apache]]s and [[Igorot]]s (from the Philippines) were displayed at the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|Saint Louis World Fair]] in association with the [[1904 Summer Olympics]]. The US had just acquired, following the [[Spanish–American War]], new territories such as [[Guam]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Puerto Rico]], allowing them to "display" some of the native inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remembering St. Louis, 1904: A World on Display and Bontoc Eulogy|publisher=[[Syracuse University]]|author=Jim Zwick|date=March 4, 1996|accessdate=2007-05-25|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/Bontoc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Rev. [[Sequoyah Ade]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To further illustrate the indignities heaped upon the [[Philippines|Philippine]] people following their eventual loss to the Americans, the United States made the Philippine campaign the centrepoint of the 1904 World's Fair held that year in St. Louis, MI [sic]. In what was enthusiastically termed a "parade of evolutionary progress," visitors could inspect the "primitives" that represented the counterbalance to "Civilisation" justifying [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'s poem "[[The White Man's Burden]]". [[Pygmy|Pygmies]] from New Guinea and Africa, who were later displayed in the Primate section of the [[Bronx Zoo]], were paraded next to American Indians such as Apache warrior [[Geronimo]], who sold his autograph. But the main draw was the Philippine exhibition complete with full size replicas of Indigenous living quarters erected to exhibit the inherent backwardness of the Philippine people. The purpose was to highlight both the "civilising" influence of American rule and the economic potential of the island chains' natural resources on the heels of the [[Philippine–American War]]. It was, reportedly, the largest specific Aboriginal exhibition displayed in the exposition. As one pleased visitor commented, the human zoo exhibition displayed "the race narrative of odd peoples who mark time while the world advances, and of savages made, by American methods, into civilized workers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Passions of Suzie Wong Revisited, by Rev. Sequoyah Ade|publisher=[[Aboriginal Intelligence]]|date=January 4, 2004|url=http://www.modelminority.com/article750.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928140712/http://www.modelminority.com/article750.html|archivedate=September 28, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1906, [[Madison Grant]]—socialite, [[eugenics|eugenicist]], amateur [[anthropology|anthropologist]], and head of the [[New York Zoological Society]]—had [[Congo Pygmies|Congolese pygmy]] [[Ota Benga]] put on display at the Bronx Zoo in New York City alongside [[ape]]s and other animals. At the behest of Grant, the zoo director [[William Temple Hornaday|William Hornaday]] placed Benga displayed in a cage with the chimpanzees, then with an [[orangutan]] named Dohong, and a parrot, and labeled him ''The Missing Link'', suggesting that in [[evolution]]ary terms Africans like Benga were closer to apes than were Europeans. It triggered protests from the city's clergymen, but the public reportedly flocked to see it.&lt;ref name=NYTBenga/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, Phillips Verner and Blume, Harvey. ''Ota Benga: The Pygmy in the Zoo''. St. Martins Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Friedländer.plakat.8.jpg|thumb|upright|Ad for a [[Carl Hagenbeck]] show (1886)]]

Benga shot targets with a bow and arrow, wove twine, and wrestled with an orangutan. Although, according to ''The New York Times'', "few expressed audible objection to the sight of a human being in a cage with monkeys as companions", controversy erupted as black clergymen in the city took great offense. "Our race, we think, is depressed enough, without exhibiting one of us with the apes", said the Reverend James H. Gordon, superintendent of the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum in Brooklyn. "We think we are worthy of being considered human beings, with souls."&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/06/nyregion/thecity/06zoo.html?ex=1155009600&amp;en=c2cc9b84edc068cd&amp;ei=5087%0A|title=The Scandal at the Zoo|last=Keller|first=Mitch|date=2006-08-06|work=New York Times|accessdate=2008-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mayor of New York City|New York City Mayor]] [[George B. McClellan Jr.]] refused to meet with the clergymen, drawing the praise of Hornaday, who wrote to him: "When the history of the Zoological Park is written, this incident will form its most amusing passage."&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

As the controversy continued, Hornaday remained unapologetic, insisting that his only intention was to put on an ethnological exhibition. In another letter, he said that he and Grant—who ten years later would publish the racist tract ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]''—considered it "imperative that the society should not even seem to be dictated to" by the black clergymen.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

On Monday, September 8, 1906, after just two days, Hornaday decided to close the exhibition, and Benga could be found walking the zoo grounds, often followed by a crowd "howling, jeering and yelling."&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

In 1925, a display at [[Belle Vue Zoo]] in [[Manchester]], England, was entitled "Cannibals" and featured black Africans depicted as savages.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Rees, ''An Introduction to Zoo Biology and Management'', [[Wiley-Blackwell]], John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd., [[Chichester]] ([[West Sussex]]), 2011, p.44. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-9349-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1930s, a new kind of human zoo appeared in America, nude shows masquerading as education. These included the [[Zoro Garden Nudist Colony]] at the Pacific International Exposition in San Diego, California (1935-6) and the Sally Rand Nude Ranch at the [[Golden Gate International Exposition]] in San Francisco (1939). The former was supposedly a real [[nudist colony]], which used hired performers instead of actual nudists. The latter featured nude women performing in western attire. The Golden Gate fair also featured a "Greenwich Village" show, described in the Official Guide Book as “Model artists’ colony and revue theatre.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfmuseum.org/bio/rand.html "Sally Rand and The Music Box", Virtual Museum of San Francisco]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Adelaide Zoo]] ran a Human Zoo exhibition which consisted of a group of people who, as part of a study exercise, had applied to be housed in the former ape enclosure by day, but then returned home by night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Humans on display at Adelaide Zoo |publisher=[[tvnz]] |date=January 12, 2007 |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/957918/3362663.xhtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222070938/http://tvnz.co.nz/content/957918/3362663.xhtml |archivedate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inhabitants took part in several exercises, and spectators were asked for donations towards a new ape enclosure.

Also in 2007, pygmy performers at the Festival of Pan-African Music (Fespam) were housed at a zoo in [[Brazzaville]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]].  Although members of the group of twenty people - among them an infant, age three-months - were not officially on display, it was necessary for them to "collect firewood in the zoo to cook their food, and [they] were being stared at and filmed by tourists and passers-by".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6898241.stm|title=Pygmy artists housed in Congo zoo|author=[[BBC News]]|date=2007-07-13|accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Huế''' ({{IPA-vi|hwě|lang|Hue Northern.ogg}} is a city in central [[Vietnam]] that was the seat of [[Nguyễn Dynasty]] emperors from 1802 to 1945, and capital of the protectorate of [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]]. A major attraction is its vast, 19th-century [[Imperial City, Huế|citadel]], surrounded by a moat and thick stone walls. It encompasses the Imperial City, with palaces and shrines; the Forbidden Purple City, once the emperor's home; and a replica of the Royal Theater.
The city was also the battleground for the [[Battle of Huế]], which was one of the longest and bloodiest battles of the [[Vietnam War]].

==History==
Huế originally rose to prominence as the capital of the [[Nguyễn lords]], a feudal dynasty that dominated much of southern Vietnam from the 17th to the 19th century. In 1775 when [[Trịnh lords|Trịnh lord]] [[Trịnh Sâm]] captured it, it was known as '''[[Phú Xuân|Phú Xuân (富春)]]'''.  The city's current name is likely a non-[[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] reading of the Chinese [[wikt:化|化]] (Sino-Vietnamese: [[wikt:hoá|hoá]]), as in the historical name [[Thuận Hoá]] ([[wikt:順化|順化]]).

[[File:Enthronement of Emperor Bảo Đại 010.jpg|thumb|left|Enthronement of Emperor Bảo Đại in the Imperial City in 1926]]
In 1802, Nguyễn Phúc Ánh (later Emperor [[Gia Long]]) succeeded in establishing his control over the whole of [[Vietnam]], thereby making Huế the national capital.&lt;ref&gt;Woodside, Alexander (1988). ''Vietnam and the Chinese model: a comparative study of Vietnamese and Chinese government in the first half of the nineteenth century.'' Harvard Univ Asia Center. p. 127. {{ISBN|978-0-674-93721-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Minh Mạng]] (r. 1820-40) was the second emperor of the Nguyễn Dynasty, reigning from 14 February 1820 (his 29th birthday) until his death, on 20 January 1841. He was a younger son of Emperor [[Gia Long]], whose eldest son, Crown Prince Cảnh, had died in 1801. Minh Mạng was well known for his opposition to French involvement in Vietnam, and for his rigid [[Confucian]] [[orthodoxy]].

During the [[French Indochina|French colonial period]], Huế was in the [[Annam (French protectorate)|protectorate of Annam]]. It remained the seat of the Imperial Palace until 1945, when Emperor [[Bảo Đại]] abdicated and the [[North Vietnam|DRV]] government was established with its capital at Hà Nội ([[Hanoi]]), in the north.&lt;ref&gt;Boobbyer, Claire; Spooner, Andrew; O'Tailan, Jock (2008). ''Vietnam, Cambodia &amp; Laos.'' Footprint Travel Guides. p. 122. {{ISBN|978-1-906098-09-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Bảo Đại was proclaimed "Head of the [[State of Vietnam]]" with the help of the returning French colonialists in 1949 (although not with recognition from the communists or the full acceptance of the Vietnamese people), his new capital was Sài Gòn ([[Saigon]]), in the south.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, Peter N.; Langer, William Leonard (2001). ''The Encyclopedia of world history: ancient, medieval, and modern, chronologically arranged.'' Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. p. 1036.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Republic of Vietnam]], Huế, being very near the border between the North and South, was vulnerable in the [[Vietnam War]]. In the [[Tet Offensive|Tết Offensive]] of 1968, during the [[Battle of Huế]], the city suffered considerable damage not only to its physical features, but its reputation as well, due to a combination of the American military bombing of historic buildings held by the North Vietnamese, and the [[massacre at Huế]] committed by the communist forces.

After the war's conclusion, many of the historic features of Huế were neglected because they were seen by the victorious communist regime and some other Vietnamese as "relics from the feudal regime"; the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Vietnamese Communist Party]] doctrine officially described the Nguyễn Dynasty as "feudal" and "reactionary." There has since been a change of policy, however, and many historical areas of the city are currently being restored.

[[File:Aster Hue City.jpg|thumb|Satellite picture of the city and the Perfume River]]

== Geography ==
The city is located in central Vietnam on the banks of the [[Perfume River]], just a few miles inland from the [[South China Sea|East Sea]]. It is about {{convert|700|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Hanoi]] and about {{convert|1100|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Hồ Chí Minh City]].

== Climate ==
Huế features a [[tropical monsoon climate]] under the [[Köppen climate classification]]. Failling short of a [[tropical rainforest climate]]. The dry season is from March to August, with high temperatures of {{convert|35|to|40|C|F}}. The rainy season is from August to January, with a flood season from October, onwards. The average rainy season temperature is {{convert|20|°C|°F}}, sometimes as low as {{convert|9|°C|°F}}. Spring lasts from January to late February.&lt;ref&gt;Ishizawa, Yoshiaki; Kōno, Yasushi; Rojpojchanarat, Vira; Daigaku, Jōchi; Kenkyūjo, Ajia Bunka (1988). ''Study on Sukhothai: research report.''

== Culture ==
In the center of Vietnam, Huế was the capital city of Vietnam for approximately 150 years during feudal times (1802–1945),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nguyễn|first=Đắc Xuân|title=700 năm Thuận Hóa-Phú Xuân-Huế|year=2009|publisher=Nhà xuất bản Trẻ|location=Việt Nam}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the royal lifestyle and customs have had a significant impact on the characteristics of the people of Huế. That impact can still be felt today.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

=== Name-giving ===
{{see also|Minh Mạng#Imperial succession poem}}
Historically, the qualities valued by the royal family were reflected in its name-giving customs, which came to be adopted by society at large.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} As a rule, royal family members were named after a poem written by Minh Mạng, the second emperor of [[Nguyễn Dynasty]]. The poem, Đế hệ thi",&lt;ref&gt;[[:vi:Minh Mạng]]{{Third-party-inline|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been set as a standard frame to name every generation of the royal family, through which people can know the family order as well as the relationship between royal members. More importantly, the names reflect the essential personality traits that the royal regime would like their offspring to uphold. This name-giving tradition is proudly kept alive and nowadays people from Huế royal family branches (normally considered 'pure' Huế) still have their names taken from the words in the poem.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

=== Clothing ===
[[File:Festival Huế 2008-3.JPG|thumb|Festival in Huế]]
The design of the modern-day ''[[ao dai|áo dài]]'', a Vietnamese [[national costume]], evolved from an outfit worn at the court of the [[Nguyễn Lord]]s at Huế in the 18th century. A court historian of the time described the rules of dress as follows:
{{quote|Thường phục thì đàn ông, đàn bà dùng áo cổ đứng ngắn tay, cửa ống tay rộng hoặc hẹp tùy tiện. Áo thì hai bên nách trở xuống phải khâu kín liền, không được xẻ mở. Duy đàn ông không muốn mặc áo cổ tròn ống tay hẹp cho tiện khi làm việc thì được phép.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside court, men and women wear gowns with straight collars and short sleeves. The sleeves are large or small depending on the weather. There are seams on both sides running down from the sleeve, so the gown is not open anywhere. Men may wear a round collar and a short sleeve for more convenience.|''[[Đại Nam thực lục]]''&lt;ref group=nb&gt;''[[Đại Nam thực lục]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This outfit evolved into the ''áo ngũ thân'', a five-paneled [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] [[gown]] worn in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Inspired by Paris fashions, Nguyễn Cát Tường and other artists associated with [[Hanoi University]] redesigned the ''ngũ thân'' as a modern dress in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{Citation | last = Ellis | first = Claire | title = Ao Dai: The National Costume | newspaper = Things Asian | year = 1996 | url = http://www.thingsasian.com/stories-photos/1083 | accessdate = 2 July 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080705105011/http://www.thingsasian.com/stories-photos/1083 | archivedate = 5 July 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the ''áo dài'' and ''[[Asian conical hat|nón lá]]'' are generally seen as a symbol of Vietnam as a whole, the combination is seen by Vietnamese as being particularly evocative of Huế. Violet-coloured ''áo dài'' are especially common in Huế, the color having a special connection to the city's heritage as a former capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bửu|first=Ý|title=Xứ Huế Người Huế|url=http://tuoitre.vn/Van-hoa-Giai-tri/38127/Xu-Hue-nguoi-Hue.html|accessdate=29 April 2011|newspaper=Tuổi Trẻ|date=19 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/news/2004/06/162188/ |title=Ao dai – Hue's piquancy |accessdate=1 June 2011 |date=18 June 2004 |newspaper=VietnamNet |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204025846/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/news/2004/06/162188/ |archivedate=4 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- One typical example of the spread of royal character has to do with the charming traditional dress of Vietnamese women – the ao dai. It is said that back in the 1970s, ao dai, which, previously, used to be worn daily by the royal family members and yet only on special occasions by ordinary people, became an everyday outfit of almost all Hue women, from office workers and school girls to sellers in markets, even street vendors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bửu|first=Ý|title=Xứ Huế Người Huế|url=http://tuoitre.vn/Van-hoa-Giai-tri/38127/Xu-Hue-nguoi-Hue.html|accessdate=29 April 2011|newspaper=Tuoi Tre|date=19 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the subtlety and delicacy of the ao dai, the people who wear it frequently have been seen to invariably develop the same characteristics. This is also one of the reasons why until now, the image of an innocent-looking Hue girl in her charming ao dai has become a unanimous human symbol of Hue. --&gt;

=== Cuisine ===
[[File:Bun Bo Hue 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bún bò Huế]], a typical noodle dish]]

The cuisine of Huế forms the heart of Central Vietnamese cuisine, but one of the most striking differences is the prominence of vegetarianism in the city. Several all-vegetarian restaurants are scattered in various corners of the city to serve the locals who have a strong tradition of eating vegetarian twice a month, as part of their Buddhist beliefs. Another feature of Huế dishes that sets them apart from other regional cuisines in Vietnam is the relatively small serving size with refined presentation, a vestige of its royal cuisine. Huế cuisine is notable for often being very spicy.&lt;ref&gt;Ngoc, Huu; Borton, Lady (2006). ''Am Thuc Xu Hue: Hue Cuisine.'' Vietnam.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hue cuisine has both luxurious and popular rustic dishes. With such a rich history, Hue's royal cuisine combines both taste and aesthetics. It consists of several distinctive dishes from small and delicate creations, originally made to please the appetites of Nguyen feudal lords, emperors, and their hundreds of concubines and wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiamarvels.com/hue-panoramic-view-ancient-capital-vietnam/#tab-con-10|title=Hue – A Panoramic View Of The Ancient Capital – Asia Travel Blog|date=30 November 2017|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
[[File:Chùa Thiên Mụ ở Huế.jpg|thumb|[[Pagoda of the Celestial Lady]]]]
The imperial court practiced various religions such as Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism. The most important altar was the [[Esplanade of Sacrifice to the Heaven and Earth]], where the monarch would offer each year prayers to the Heaven and Earth.

In Huế, [[Buddhism]] enjoyed stronger support than elsewhere in Vietnam, with more monasteries than anywhere else in the country serving as home to the nation's most famous monks.

In 1963, [[Thích Quảng Đức]] drove from Hue to [[Saigon]] to protest anti-Buddhist policies of the South Vietnamese government, setting himself on fire on a Saigon street. Photos of the self-immolation became some of the enduring images of the Vietnam conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gonomad.com/1718-hue-vietnam-try-the-food |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703140806/http://www.gonomad.com/1718-hue-vietnam-try-the-food |dead-url=no |archive-date=2013-07-03 |title=Hue, Vietnam: Try The Food - GoNOMAD Travel |author=rpcpost |work=gonomad.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thich Nhat Hanh]], world-famous [[Zen]] master now living in France, originates from Huế.

Huế is well known for its historic monuments, which have earned it a place in [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Sites]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tuoitrenews.vn/lifestyle/21120/vietnams-eight-world-heritage-sites Vietnam's eight World Heritage Sites]. ''[[Tuoi Tre]] News''. 22 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The seat of the Nguyễn emperors was the [[Imperial City, Huế|Imperial City]], which occupies a large, walled area on the north side of the [[Perfume River]]. Inside the citadel was a forbidden city where only the emperors, concubines, and those close enough to them were granted access; the punishment for trespassing was death. Today, little of the forbidden city remains, though reconstruction efforts are in progress to maintain it as a historic tourist attraction.

Roughly along the Perfume River from Huế lie myriad other monuments, including the tombs of several emperors, including [[Minh Mạng]], [[Khải Định]], and [[Tự Đức]]. Also notable is the [[Thiên Mụ Pagoda]], the largest pagoda in Huế and the official symbol of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Pham, Sherrise; Emmons, Ron; Eveland, Jennifer; Lin-Liu, Jen (2009). ''Frommer's south-east Asia.'' Frommer's. p. 318. {{ISBN|978-0-470-44721-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of French-style buildings lie along the south bank of the [[Perfume River]]. Among them are [[Quoc Hoc High School|Quốc Học High School]], the oldest high school in Vietnam, and Hai Ba Trung High School.

The [[Huế Museum of Royal Fine Arts]] on 3 Le Truc Street also maintains a collection of various artifacts from the city.

In addition to the various touristic attractions in Hué itself, the city also offers day-trips to the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarized Zone]] lying approximately {{convert|70|km|abbr=on}} north, showing various war settings like [[The Rockpile]], [[Khe Sanh Combat Base]] or the [[Vinh Moc tunnels]].

In the first 11 months of 2012, Huế received 2.4 million visitors, an increase of 24.6% from the same period of 2011. 803,000 of those 2.4 million visitors were foreign guests, an increase of 25.7%. Although tourism plays a key role in the city's socioeconomic development, it also has negative impacts on the environment and natural resource base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hue; Information &amp; Statistics, |url=http://travel-tourist-information-guide.com/vietnam-hue|website=Travel-Tourist-Information-Guide.com|accessdate=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, services associated with tourism, such as travel, the development of infrastructure and its operation, and the production and consumption of goods, are all energy-intensive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdkn.org/2014/05/report-advancing-green-growth-in-the-tourism-sector%E2%80%A8-the-case-of-hue-vietnam/ Advancing green growth in the tourism sector: The case of Hue, Vietnam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714165655/http://cdkn.org/2014/05/report-advancing-green-growth-in-the-tourism-sector%E2%80%A8-the-case-of-hue-vietnam/ |date=14 July 2014 }}, Kyoko Kusakabe, Pujan Shrestha, S.

'''Jean François Foppens''', sometimes Latinized '''Johannes Franciscus Foppens''' (1689–1761), was a Belgian ecclesiastical historian, and [[biography in literature|literary biographer]] and bibliographer. He is best known for his ''Bibliotheca belgica, sive virorum in Belgio vita scriptisque illustrium catalogus'' (2 vols., Brussels, 1739), a catalogue of Belgian authors and their works.&lt;ref&gt;H. Helbig, "Foppens (Jean-François)", ''[[Biographie Nationale de Belgique]]'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20161220100824/http://www.academieroyale.be/academie/documents/FichierPDFBiographieNationaleTome2048.pdf vol. 7] (Brussels, 1883), 193–195.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Foppens was born in [[Brussels]] on 17 November 1689, the son of a family of printers. He was sent to [[Old University of Leuven|Leuven University]] in 1704 and graduated Master of Arts in 1706, at the age of 17. Around 1713 he began lecturing on Philosophy at the university while studying Theology. In 1715 he graduated [[Licentiate of Theology]] and began a clerical career, holding a canonry of the church of St Martin in [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]], then [[St. Salvator's Cathedral]] in [[Bruges]], and finally [[St. Rumbold's Cathedral]] in [[Mechelen]]. He died in Mechelen on 16 July 1761 and was buried in the cathedral.

'''John Farquhar Fulton''' (November 1, 1899 – May 29, 1960) was an American [[neurophysiologist]] and science writer. He received numerous degrees from [[Oxford University]] and [[Harvard University]]. He taught at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]] School of Medicine at Oxford and later became the youngest [[Sterling Professor]] of [[Physiology]] at [[Yale University]]. His main contributions were in [[primate]] neurophysiology and [[history of science]].

==Early life and education==
John Farquhar Fulton was born in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] as the youngest of 6 children &lt;ref name = Gariepy&gt;Gariepy, Thomas P. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/238004 "John Farquhar Fulton and the History of Science Society"], ''Isis'' Vol. 90, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|S7}} to Edith Stanley Wheaton and John Farquhar Fulton, an [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]] who helped found the [[University of Minnesota]].&lt;ref name = Leake/&gt;{{rp|561}} He studied at the [[University of Minnesota]] from 1917–18 and then transferred to Harvard University, receiving a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in 1921.&lt;ref name="Gariepy" /&gt;{{rp|S7-S8}} Starting in 1921, he studied neurophysiology at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] as a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]], earning a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] with first class honors in 1923.&lt;ref name="Gariepy" /&gt;{{rp|S8}} Then, as a Christopher Welch Scholar at Magdalen College, he received an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil.]] in 1925.&lt;ref name="Gariepy" /&gt;{{rp|S8}} He then received an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] from Harvard in 1927.&lt;ref name="Gariepy" /&gt;{{rp|S8}} After his time at Harvard, he focused his studies on neurosurgery at the [[Brigham and Women's Hospital|Peter Bent Brigham Hospital]] in Boston under [[Harvey Williams Cushing|Harvey Cushing]].&lt;ref name="Gariepy" /&gt;{{rp|S8}} He later returned to Oxford to receive a [[Doctor of Science|D.Sc.]] in 1941 and [[Doctor of Letters|D.Litt.]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="Leake" /&gt;{{rp|561}} He was hospitalized for [[diabetes mellitus]] in 1950 and for cardiac difficulties in 1957. He died at the age of 60 due to heart failure.&lt;ref name="Gariepy" /&gt;{{rp|S25-S26}}

==Leadership==
Fulton taught as a demonstrator in [[physiology]] for two years at Oxford University starting in 1923.&lt;ref name="Leake" /&gt;{{rp|561}} He taught briefly at the Magdalen College School of Medicine from 1928–29,&lt;ref name="Gariepy" /&gt;{{rp|S9}} then transferred to [[Yale University]], becoming the youngest [[Sterling Professor]] of Physiology.&lt;ref name="Leake" /&gt;{{rp|561}}

His leadership extended outside the classroom. His positions included editor for the ''[[Journal of Neurophysiology]]'';&lt;ref name="Leake" /&gt;{{rp|561}} creator of the Yale Aeromedical Research Unit in 1940;&lt;ref name="Leake" /&gt;{{rp|561}} chairman of the Subcommittee on Historical Records of the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]],&lt;ref name="Leake" /&gt;{{rp|562}} member of the Committee on Aviation Medicine;&lt;ref name="Leake" /&gt; trustee for the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] at [[Princeton University]] in 1942;&lt;ref name="Leake" /&gt;{{rp|562}} president of the [[History of Science Society]] from 1947 to 1950;&lt;ref name="Gariepy" /&gt;{{rp|S12}} first chairman of the Yale Department of History and Medicine in 1951,&lt;ref name = Library&gt;Yale University Medical Historical Library [http://historical.medicine.yale.edu/us/founders/fulton "John Farquhar Fulton"], accessed 2 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Harvey Williams Cushing]] and [[Arnold Klebs]],&lt;ref name="Leake" /&gt;{{rp|560}} and head of the ''[[Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences]]'' from 1951-60.&lt;ref name="Leake" /&gt;{{rp|562}}

==Contributions==

===History of science===
Fulton strongly encouraged the addition of humanities into the scientific fields by placing the history of sciences into general education.&lt;ref name="Gariepy" /&gt;{{rp|S12-S13}} His passion for this topic landed him the role of president of the [[History of Science Society]] from 1947-50.&lt;ref name="Gariepy" /&gt;{{rp|S12}} He aided in the founding of institutions such as the [[Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library|Medical Historical Library at Yale]] (1941),&lt;ref name="Library" /&gt; the Logan Clendening Lectures in the History of Medicine at the [[University of Kansas]] in 1950,&lt;ref name = Fulton1&gt;Fulton, John F. [http://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/bitstream/1808/6347/1/upk.vesalius_four_centuries_later.pdf "Logan Clendening Lectures on the History of Science and Philosophy of Medicine, First Series"], University of Kansas Press, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; the Yale Department of History of Medicine (with [[Harvey Williams Cushing]] and [[Arnold Klebs]] in 1951),&lt;ref name="Library" /&gt; and the Yale Department of the History of Science and Medicine in 1959.&lt;ref name="Leake" /&gt;{{rp|561}}

During his time as president of the History of Science Society, he was a member of the editorial board of its historical journal [[Isis (journal)|''Isis'']]&lt;ref name="Leake" /&gt;{{rp|560}} and helped stabilize it so it could grow in popularity.&lt;ref name="Gariepy" /&gt;{{rp|S13}} He also organized meetings in 1947 for the Committee on the History of Science in General Education, which created a project to collect materials to use in the teaching of history of science.&lt;ref name="Gariepy" /&gt;{{rp|S16}}

He argued for the English translation of historical texts that traced the history of the sciences.&lt;ref name="Gariepy" /&gt;{{rp|S17}} He had a hobby as an avid book collector, and he donated much of his collection to the [[Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library|Yale Medical Historical Library]]. He also added his own work to these collections. He wrote biographies for [[Harvey Williams Cushing|Harvey Cushing]], [[Benjamin Silliman]], [[Robert Boyle]], [[Girolamo Fracastoro]], [[Richard Lower (physician)|Richard Lower]], [[John Mayow]], [[Kenelm Digby]], and [[Joseph Priestley]].&lt;ref name="Leake" /&gt;{{rp|562}} Fulton also discovered early publications of [[Ambroise Paré]], a surgeon who lived in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Leake" /&gt;{{rp|562}}

===Primate physiology===
Fulton created the first primate research laboratory in the United States. Through the 1930s, he and other scientists did [[comparative psychology|comparative studies]] on [[functional specialization (brain)|functional localization]] in the [[cerebral cortex]]. They found that [[lesion]]ing the [[prefrontal cortex]] created calming effects in the monkeys.&lt;ref name = Todman/&gt; Fulton proposed, but did not implement, the idea of using this technique on humans to relieve mental diseases.&lt;ref name = Fulton2&gt;Fulton, John Farquhar "Frontal Lobotomy and Affective Behavior: A Neurophysiological Analysis", W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; Fulton's team's findings influenced Portuguese [[neurologist]] [[António Egas Moniz|Egas Moniz]], who developed the medical practice of the [[lobotomy|frontal lobotomy]] in humans and who won the [[Nobel Prize]] for his work in 1949.&lt;ref name="Leake" /&gt;{{rp|561}}

Fulton's work in the field of neurophysiology brought about the creation of the ''[[Journal of Neurophysiology]]'' in 1938.&lt;ref name="Leake" /&gt;{{rp|561}}

===World War II===
The impact of Fulton's studies in neurophysiology extended to the military during [[World War II]]. Fulton created the Yale Aero-Medical Research Unit, which lasted from 1940-1951. It made great progress in the fields of [[aviation medicine]] as well as [[high-altitude flying]], which caused Fulton to be awarded various honors (below).&lt;ref name="Leake" /&gt;{{rp|561}}

'''Juan Antonio Llorente''' (March 30, 1756 in [[Rincón de Soto]] ([[La Rioja (autonomous community)|La Rioja]]), [[Spain]] – February 5, 1823 in [[Madrid]]) was a Spanish [[historian]].

== Biography ==
Llorente was raised by an uncle after his parents died.&lt;ref name=kamen&gt;{{cite book | last = Kamen | first = Henry | title = The disinherited : exile and the making of Spanish culture, 1492-1975 | publisher = HarperCollins | location = New York, N.Y | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-06-073086-4 | pages = 180–184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He studied at the [[University of Zaragoza]], and, having been ordained priest, became [[vicar-general]] to the [[bishop of Calahorra]] in 1782.  In 1785, he became commissary of the [[Holy Office]] (Inquisition) at [[Logroño]] and, in 1789, its general secretary at Madrid.

[[Image:Map Spain 1810.png|left|thumb|The prefectures of 1810.]]
In the [[Peninsular War|crisis of 1808]], Llorente [[afrancesado|identified himself]] with the [[Joseph I of Spain|Bonaparte regime]] and was engaged for a few years in superintending the execution of the decree for the suppression of the monastic orders, in examining the archives of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] and in arguing for the submission of the Spanish church to the Bonaparte monarch.

His 1810 project for a division of Spain in [[prefecture]]s and subprefectures ([[Departments of France|under the French revolutionary inspiration]]) was never brought into practice because of the war.  On the return of King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] to Spain in 1814, he retreated to [[France]], where he published his great work, ''Histoire critique de l'Inquisition espagnole'' ([[Paris]], 1817-1818).  His works "were the first fully documented accounts of the Inquisition to have seen the light of day in over three hundred years of the tribunal's existence."&lt;ref name=kamen/&gt;

Translated into English, German, Dutch and Italian, it attracted much attention in [[Europe]] and involved its author in considerable persecution.  While Llorente was in France, the mob destroyed his Spanish residence and his library of over 8,000 rare books and manuscripts (some irreplaceable).&lt;ref name=kamen/&gt;  After the coup of [[Rafael de Riego]] (1820), he supported the new Liberal government.  The discovery of his [[Carbonari]]an activities{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} and the publication of his ''Portraits politiques des papes'' in 1822 culminated in a peremptory order to leave France.

Both the personal character and the literary accuracy of Llorente have been assailed, but, although he was not an exact historian, there is no doubt, according to the ''Encyclopædia Britannica (11th ed.)'', that he made an honest use of documents relating to the Inquisition&lt;ref&gt;Entry "''Juan Antonio Llorente''", in ''Encyclopædia Britannica (11th ed.)'', 1911&lt;/ref&gt; which, in part, are no longer extant.

The English translation of the ''Historia'' ([[London]], 1826) is abridged.  Llorente also wrote ''Memorias para la historia de la revolución de España'' (Paris, 1814-1816), translated into French (Paris, 1815-1819); ''Noticias históricas de las tres provincias vascongadas'' (Madrid, 1806-1808); an autobiography, ''Noticia biográfica'' (Paris, 1818), and other works.  Llorente's unpublished notes contributed a century later to the most reliable biography (by [[Gregorio Marañón]]) of Philip II's infamous secretary, [[Antonio Pérez (statesman)|Antonio Pérez]].&lt;ref name=kamen/&gt;

[[File:LCALEIIH.tif|thumb|Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]]
'''''Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew''''' is a scholarly book written by linguist [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], published in 2003 by [[Palgrave Macmillan]]. The book proposes a socio-philological framework for the analysis of "camouflaged borrowing" such as [[phono-semantic matching]]. It introduces for the first time a classification for "multisourced [[neologism]]s", new words that are based on two or more sources at the same time. 

== Overview ==
The book was the first monograph published within the series ''Palgrave Studies in Language History and Language Change''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.palgrave.com/in/series/14617 |title=Palgrave Studies in Language History and Language Change |accessdate=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It provides new perspectives on [[etymology]], [[word formation]], [[language change]], [[loanwords]] and [[language contact|contact linguistics]]. It establishes a principled classification of neologisms, their semantic fields, the roles of source languages, and the attitudes of [[Linguistic purism|purists]] and ordinary native speakers towards multi-factorial coinage. It analyses the tension between linguistic creativity and cultural flirting on the one hand, and the preservation of a distinct language identity on the other hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zuckermann.org/enrichment.html |title=Professor Ghil'ad Zuckermann, D.Phil. (Oxon.), Ph.D. (Cantab.), Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment |date= |accessdate=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis presented in this book challenges [[Einar Haugen]]'s classic typology of lexical borrowing. Whereas Haugen categorizes borrowing into either substitution or importation, this book explores cases of "simultaneous substitution and importation" in the form of camouflaged borrowing. Examples of such mechanisms are phonetic matching, semanticized phonetic matching, phono-semantic matching and [[Calque|calquing]].

The book examines words and phrases in [[Modern Hebrew|Israeli]] (Modern Hebrew),&lt;ref&gt;“Israeli” is the name used throughout the book for "Revived Hebrew" (despite the book title).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turkish Language|Revolutionized Turkish]], [[Modern Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Arabic]], [[Yiddish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[pidgin language|pidgins]] and [[creole language|creoles]].

== Format ==
The book has two ISBNs: {{ISBN|978-1-4039-3869-5}} and {{ISBN|1-4039-1723-X}}. It consists of 304 pages, including an index. The cover of the book features three [[Israeli Hebrew]] words, all finally-stressed:

* מילים ''milim'' means "words".
* מגע ''maga'' means "contact". 
* העשרה ''haashara'' means "enrichment".

==Reviews==
The book was commended by [[Geoffrey Lewis (scholar)|Geoffrey Lewis]] ([[University of Oxford]]), [[James A. Matisoff]] ([[University of California, Berkeley]]), [[Jeffrey Heath]] ([[University of Michigan]]), and Shmuel Bolozky ([[University of Massachusetts]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linguistlist.org/issues/15/15-469.html |title=LINGUIST List 15.469: Sociolinguistics: Zuckermann |website=Linguistlist.org |date=2004-02-04 |accessdate=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Joseph T. Farquharson ([[Linguistlist]]):

{{bq|The book is an outstanding piece of scholarship which undoubtedly represents a milestone in the field of lexicology. Zuckermann's attention to details has made the work a mini-encyclopaedia, much in the tradition of Jewish scholarship. Generally, his etymologies are well thought out and set a standard for current and future research [...] It would be foolhardy for any lexicographer, lexicologist, etymologist, language planner, morphologist not to have a copy of this book handy. The work is accessible to a general audience though. Zuckermann set himself an ambitious task which he has achieved with astounding brilliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linguistlist.org/issues/16/16-1399.html |title=LINGUIST List 16.1399: Historical Ling/Socioling/Semitic Ling: Zuckermann |website=Linguistlist.org |date=2005-05-02 |accessdate=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Famed quote===
In a 1976 scholarly article about little-studied [[Puritan]] funeral services, Ulrich included the phrase "well-behaved women seldom make history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://scholar.harvard.edu/laurelulrich/publications/vertuous-women-found-new-england-ministerial-literature-1668-1735| website= scholar.harvard.edu| publisher= Harvard University| title= Laurel Thatcher Ulrich: Publications: Vertuous Women Found: New England Ministerial Literature, 1668-1735| accessdate= April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Foster |first= David |url= http://www.hamilton.edu/news/more_news/display.cfm?id=13646 |title= Well-Behaved Women?

It continues to be seen on greeting cards, T-shirts, mugs, plaques, and bumper stickers. She recounted how her now-famous quote has taken on a life of its own in an October 2007 interview: "It was a weird escape into popular culture. I got constant e-mails about it, and I thought it was humorous. Then I started looking at where it was coming from. Once I turned up as a character in a novel—and a tennis star from India wore the T-shirt at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]. It seemed like a teaching moment—and so I wrote a book using the title."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Deseret Morning News]] |date=21 October 2007 |page=E10 |title=Ulrich touts women in history |first=Dennis |last=Lythgoe |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/695220185/Ulrich-touts-women-in-history.html?pg=allby |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927120101/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/695220185/Ulrich-touts-women-in-history.html?pg=allby |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Well-Behaved Women'' examines the ways in which women shaped history, citing examples from the lives of [[Rosa Parks]], [[Christine de Pizan]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Harriet Tubman]], and [[Virginia Woolf]].

[[File:A Midwife's Tale by Laurel Thatcher Ulrich.jpg|A Midwife's Tale by Laurel Thatcher Ulrich]]
===''A Midwife's Tale''===
''A Midwife's Tale'' examines the life of Northern New England [[midwife]] [[Martha Ballard]], and provides a vivid examination of ordinary life in the early American republic, including the role of women in the household and local market economy, the nature of marriage and sexual relations, aspects of medical practice, and the prevalence of violence and crime.

Ulrich's revelatory history was honored with the [[Pulitzer Prize]]. ''A Midwife's Tale'' also received the [[Bancroft Prize]], the [[John H. Dunning Prize]], the Joan Kelly Memorial Prize, the [[Berkshire Conference of Women Historians]] Book Prize, the Society for Historians of the Early Republic Book Prize, the William Henry Welch Medal of the American Association for the History of Medicine, and the New England Historical Association Award. ''A Midwife's Tale'' was later developed into a documentary film for the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] series ''[[American Experience]]'', with Ulrich serving as a consultant, script collaborator, and narrator. The book also helped her secure a "Genius Grant" from the [[MacArthur Fellows Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prince|first1=Gregory A.|title=Leonard Arrington and the Writing of Mormon history|date=2016|publisher=University of Utah Press|location=Salt Lake City, UT|page=433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book became a landmark in women's labor history since it provides scholars with rich insights into the life of a lay American rural healer around 1800.&lt;ref name=Tunc2010 /&gt; It rests not on the observations of outsiders, but on the words of the woman herself. At first glance, Ballard's encoded, repetitive, and quotidian diary often appears trivial, but as Ulrich found, "it is in the very dailiness, the exhaustive, repetitious dailiness, that the real power of Martha Ballard's book lies... For her, living was to be measured in doing."&lt;ref name=Tunc2010 /&gt;{{rp|9}} By knitting together "ordinary" sources to produce a meaningful, extraordinary socio-cultural narrative, Ulrich shows how a skilled practitioner functioned within the interstices of the private and public spheres.

''A Midwife's Tale'' was not only methodologically influential for scholars, but also theoretically important. By showing clearly the economic contributions that midwives made to their households and local communities, and demonstrating the organizational skill of multitasking as a source of female empowerment, the book revises the understanding of prescribed gender roles. While ''A Midwife's Tale'' is obviously limited in terms of time (1785–1812) and place (rural Maine), it has attracted sustained attention of historians—especially those interested in gender relations and wage-earning, the economic value of domestic labor, and women's work before industrialization.&lt;ref name=Tunc2010&gt;{{citation |first= Tanfer Emin |last= Tunc |title= Midwifery and Women's Work in the Early American Republic: A Reconsideration of Laurel Thatcher Ulrich's 'A Midwife's Tale' |journal= [[The Historical Journal]] |date=June 2010 |volume= 53 |issue= 2 |pages= 423–428 |url= http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=7614948&amp;fulltextType=RV&amp;fileId=S0018246X10000105 |format= [[paywall]] |doi=10.1017/s0018246x10000105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other work===
In January 2017, Ulrich's book ''A House Full of Females: Plural Marriage and Women's Rights in Early Mormonism,'' was released. This text explores Mormon women living in Utah during the 19th century who had entered into plural marriages. Ulrich argues that this system was both complicated and empowering for the women in these relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/01/17/510246850/how-mormon-polygamy-in-the-19th-century-fueled-womens-activism|title=How Mormon Polygamy In The 19th Century Fueled Women's Activism|last=Gross|first=Terry|date=17 January 2017|website=www.NPR.org|publisher=|access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mormonism===
Ulrich self-identifies as an active [[Feminism|feminist]] and [[Mormon]], and has written about her experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Ulrich |first=Laurel Thatcher |date=June 2002 |title=A Pail of Cream |journal=[[The Journal of American History]] |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=43–47 |url=http://www.journalofamericanhistory.org/issues/891/ |doi=10.2307/2700782 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015161550/http://www.journalofamericanhistory.org/issues/891/ |archivedate=2012-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also co-edited (with [[Emma Lou Thayne]]) ''All God's Critters Got a Place in the Choir'', a collection of essays about the lives of Mormon women. Ulrich was a founding member of the [[Exponent II]], an independent publication on the experience of Mormon women.

In late 1992, [[Brigham Young University]]'s board of trustees vetoed without comment a BYU proposal to invite Ulrich to address the annual [[BYU Division of Continuing Education#BYU Women's Conference|BYU Women's Conference]]. Ulrich did give addresses at BYU in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Wilson |first= Robin |date= March 24, 2006 |title= A Well-Behaved Scholar Makes History |newspaper= [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |volume= 52 |issue= 29 |page= A12 |url= http://chronicle.com/weekly/v52/i29/29a01201.htm |format= [[paywall]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mi.byu.edu/bushman/|title=Richard L. Bushman Colloquium|newspaper=Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Harvard]], Ulrich is actively involved in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. She is the adviser for the undergraduate [[Latter-day Saint Student Association]], the Mormon campus club, and teaches an [[Institute of Religion]] class.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

'''&lt;big&gt;Personal life&lt;/big&gt;'''

While she was an undergraduate student, she married Gael Ulrich, now emeritus professor of chemical engineering at the University of New Hampshire.&lt;ref name="AHA" /&gt; Together they had five children: Karl (b. 1960), Melinda (b. 1963), Nathan (b. 1964), Thatcher (b. 1969), and Amy (b. 1975).&lt;ref name="AHA" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5077">'''Early dukes of Lithuania''' (including [[Eldership of Samogitia|Samogitia]]) reigned before [[Lithuanians]] were unified by [[Mindaugas]] into a state, the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. While the [[Palemonids]] legend provides genealogy from the 10th century, only few dukes were mentioned by contemporary historical sources. All of them were mentioned in written sources the 13th century. Data about them is extremely scarce and is usually limited to few brief sentences. The primary sources are the [[Chronicle of Henry of Livonia]] and [[Hypatian Codex]].

'''Lord Strange's Men''' was an [[Elizabethan]] [[playing company]], comprising retainers of the household of [[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby|Ferdinando Stanley, Lord Strange]] (pronounced "strang").&lt;ref&gt;[[F. E. Halliday]], ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564-1964,'' Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; pp. 133-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Kerchever Chambers|E. K. Chambers]], ''The Elizabethan Stage'', 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 2, pp. 118-27.&lt;/ref&gt; They are best known in their final phase of activity in the late 1580s and early 1590s. After 25 September 1593, they were known as the Earl of Derby's Men, that being the date of Stanley's accession to his father's title.

==History==
Early iterations of the company were active in the 1560s and 1570s; Henry Stanley, 4th Earl of Derby, kept players both before and after his accession to the title in 1572. A later iteration was active throughout the 1580s, playing at Court in 1580-1, 1583, and 1585-6. And "active" was the key word: they were a troupe of acrobats, led by John Symons "the Tumbler." In 1588 the company went through a re-organization: Symons and the other tumblers left for a competing troupe, [[Queen Elizabeth's Men]]. Lord Strange's became a company more devoted to acting; [[William Kempe]], [[Thomas Pope (16th-century actor)|Thomas Pope]], and [[George Bryan (16th-century actor)|George Bryan]], all future [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]], may have joined the company at this time. &lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 118-20.&lt;/ref&gt;   

In November 1589, the [[Lord Mayor of London]] ordered the company not to stage any performances within the city. In response, Strange's Men immediately went to the Cross Keys Inn to mount a performance.

Lord Strange's Men were associated with the Lord [[Admiral's Men]] from 1590 to 1594; in the winter of 1591 Strange's Men gave six performances at Court. They were also performing at [[The Theatre]], and perhaps at the [[Curtain Theatre|Curtain]] as well. The "plot" of one of their plays, ''The Seven Deadly Sins'', survives from this era, with a cast list that includes [[Richard Burbage]], [[William Sly]], [[Richard Cowley]], and [[Augustine Phillips]], more Lord Chamberlain's Men of the future.

Between February and June 1592 they were at Henslowe's [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose Theatre]], where they acted a repertory of 23 plays that included one or more of Shakespeare's ''[[Henry VI, Part 1|Henry VI]]'' trilogy. It has been argued that during that season  William Shakespeare was a member of the  company and  had a [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Why+Greene+was+angry+at+Shakespeare.-a0304726829 hand] in one of their plays, ''[[A Knack To Know A Knave|A Knack to Know a Knave]].''&lt;ref&gt;Born Hanspeter, "Why Greene was Angry at Shakespeare“, ''Medieval and Renaissance Drama'' 25 (2012), 133-173.&lt;/ref&gt; They gave three more Court performances in the winter of 1592-3; but on 28 January 1593 [[bubonic plague]] broke out again in London, an outbreak so severe that it would disrupt the entire framework of professional theatre in the capital. A combination of Strange's and Admiral's actors, led by [[Edward Alleyn]], toured the countryside in 1593-4, visiting Kent, Southampton, Bath, Bristol, Shrewsbury, and perhaps to York and Chester before turning south again to Leicester and Coventry. 

When Ferdinando Stanley died in April 1594, the company was still touring, in East Anglia and Hampshire. They returned to London in June, after the plague had abated. The company endured a radical re-organization at this time; many members left to join a new version of another troupe, under the patronage in [[Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon|Lord Hunsdon]], the [[Lord Chamberlain]] &amp;mdash; which became famous as the company of [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Richard Burbage]], the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]].&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 127, 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derby's Men==
A company of actors continued to function as Derby's Men, under the patronage of the [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby|sixth Earl]]; this organization probably included men who did not make the move to the Chamberlain's company.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 126-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Derby's Men concentrated on touring the provincial towns outside London for the remainder of their career, down to 1618 &amp;mdash; though they enjoyed one flurry of London activity under the leadership of [[Robert Browne (Elizabethan actor)|Robert Browne]] around the turn of the century, including four performances at Court in 1600 and 1601.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3891">'''Louis-Sébastien Le Nain de Tillemont''' (30 November 1637 &amp;ndash; 10 January 1698) was a French ecclesiastical [[historian]].

==Life==
He was born in [[Paris]] into a wealthy [[Jansenism|Jansenist]] family, and was educated at the ''Petites écoles'' of [[Port-Royal-des-Champs|Port-Royal]], where his historical interests were formed and encouraged. At the age of twenty, he began his two monumental works, the ''Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire ecclésiastique des six premiers siècles'' and the ''Histoire des empereurs et autres princes qui ont régné pendant les six premiers siècles de l'Église''. The first is a history of the first six centuries of the Christian Church. The second is a history of the Roman emperors during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Tillemont, Sébastien le Nain de|volume=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tillemont became a priest at the age of thirty-nine and settled at Port-Royal. When Port-Royal was dissolved in 1679, he moved to his family estate at Tillemont, where he spent the rest of his life, pursuing his historical work with great devotion. His ''Histoire'' began to issue from the press in 1690 and his ''Mémoires'' in 1693. The publication of both works was not complete at the time of his death. The final volumes were completed and published posthumously by his secretary [[Michel Tronchay]]. Tronchay also published a biography of Tillemont in 1706 titled ''Idee de la vie et de l'esprit de M. L. de Tillemont''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O4c8AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA153&amp;dq=%22Michel+Tronchay%22+1666&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAmoVChMIoZGqka6OyAIVJf1yCh2z0QIN#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Michel%20Tronchay%22%201666&amp;f=false |title=Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire ecclésiastique pendant le 18e siècle, ''Volumes 3-4'' |publisher=Felix de Pachtere |author=Michel-Joseph-Pierre Picot |year=1825 |page=153 |accessdate=September 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tillemont is cited frequently by [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] in his ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''. 
His works were among the first to provide critical surveys of the full range of source material. 
His prose style is considered dry, but he had a reputation for accuracy, detail and conscientiousness. His work was attacked on a large scale by [[Honoratus a Sancta Maria]] in his ''Réflexions sur les règles et l'usage de la critique'', three volumes (1712-1720).&lt;ref&gt;{{CE1913|wstitle=Honoratus a Sancta Maria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16506">'''Mary Ann Adams Maverick''' (March 16, 1818 &amp;ndash; February 24, 1898), was an early [[Texas]] [[Settler|pioneer]] and author of [[memoir]]s which form an important source of information about daily life in and around [[San Antonio]] during the [[Republic of Texas]] period through the [[American Civil War]].

==Early life==
''Note: There is some ambiguity here as far as her father's name: William or Robert? Was it her father or a brother/uncle Robert Adams who fought at the Battle of New Orleans? A brother named William is also mentioned.  &amp;ndash; 07 Sept 2015''

Mary Ann Adams was born in [[Tuscaloosa County, Alabama]], to William Lewis Adams, a [[lawyer]], and Agatha Strother (Lewis) Adams.  Her maternal grandmother was a cousin of [[James Madison]], while her father's family had founded [[Lynchburg, Virginia]].  Her parents lived along the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] in [[Virginia]], where her father exported flour and tobacco.  During the [[War of 1812]] her father left Virginia for what is now Alabama and bought a [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] near the site of Tuscaloosa.  While purchasing supplies in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], Robert Adams answered [[Andrew Jackson]]'s call for [[Military volunteer|volunteers]] to help defend [[New Orleans]] and raised a company which he led at the  [[Battle of New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=marks64&gt;Marks (1989), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1816, her mother came to live permanently in Alabama as well.&lt;ref name="marks64"/&gt;

In Alabama, Robert Adams [[Practice of law|practiced law]], and in 1827 he served as an agent of [[U.S. Treasury Department]].  He died in June 1827, leaving his widow to raise their six surviving children, all under the age of 12.&lt;ref name=marks65&gt;Marks (1989), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mary attended boarding school in Tuscaloosa to meet her father's wish that his children be appropriately educated.&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1989), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 4, 1836, Mary Adams married [[Samuel Maverick|Samuel Augustus Maverick]],&lt;ref name="marks64" /&gt; a [[Yale University|Yale]] graduate who had been the [[Battle of the Alamo|Alamo garrison's]] delegate to the [[Convention of 1836]] declaring [[Texas Revolution|Texas' independence]] from Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1989), pp. 53&amp;ndash;54.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sam Maverick sold his Alabama plantation at the beginning of 1837, and Mary Maverick accompanied her husband to New Orleans so that he could conduct business and be closer to news of Texas.  While she was in New Orleans, her brother William Adams left for Texas.&lt;ref name=marks69&gt;Marks (1989), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 1837, she and her husband visited his father in [[South Carolina]], where they refused the elder Maverick's gift of his plantation.  On May 14, 1837, she gave birth to her first child, [[Samuel Maverick, Jr.]] in South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1989), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment in San Antonio==
[[File:Alamo 1838 Maverick.jpg|right|thumb|In 1838, Maverick drew this sketch of the [[Alamo Mission]] in San Antonio de Bexar.]]
In October 1837, Mary Maverick, her brother, son, and seven&amp;nbsp;slaves left South Carolina.  After a brief stop in Tuscaloosa, they left for the [[Republic of Texas]] on December 7, accompanied by her fifteen-year-old brother, Robert Adams, and three additional slaves.  The party crossed into Texas near New Year's Day 1838.&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1989), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  On February 4, they rented rooms at the home of George Sutherland, and for four months Maverick remained there while her husband continued on to [[San Antonio]].&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1989), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maverick and the rest of her party reached San Antonio on June 15, 1838.&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1989), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;  In her memoirs, she claims to have been the first U.S.-born female to settle in San Antonio, but letters to her mother mentioned another American lady, married to an Irishman, who died shortly after the Mavericks arrived.  The family rented rooms at the same home where her brother William resided.&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1989), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after moving into a new home along the [[San Antonio River]], Maverick gave birth to her second child, Lewis Antonio Maverick, who became the first [[English American|Anglo-American]] child to be born in and grow up in San Antonio.&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1989), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the next few years, more Anglo families moved to San Antonio.&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1989), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her brothers returned to Alabama, but William came back to Texas in 1839 with another brother, Andrew, to begin farming.&lt;ref name=marks87&gt;Marks (1989), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary was often left alone, as her husband spent months traveling for business or combing the Texas wilderness on surveying missions.&lt;ref name=marks87/&gt;

The Mavericks participated in the so-called [[Council House Fight]] on March 19, 1840 when half of a peace-delegation of sixty-five Comanches, consisting of men, women and children, was slaughtered and the other half taken hostage. The Comanche delegation arrived in San Antonio, a traditional safe haven for peace talks,  to negotiate a peace treaty and a demarcation line and bargain for the ransom of white captives.  The army had ordered prior to the meeting that, if not all Anglo-Texans believed to be Comanche captives at that time were  returned at the beginning of the talks, all the negotiators of the band be held until the captives were returned, and then the ransom would be paid.&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1989), pp.90&amp;ndash;91.&lt;/ref&gt; Maverick and a female neighbor had been watching several Indian children playing when they heard gunfire within the council house and saw Indians fleeing from the building.  She alerted her husband and brother Andrew, and, while Samuel Maverick rushed outside to chase down the Indians, Maverick and Andrew hurried outside to find the children.  They discovered three of the fugitive Indians in the back yard, while their slave cook, Jinny, tried to protect the two Maverick children and her own four children by threatening the Indians with a large rock.  Andrew Adams shot two of the three Indians and joined the main fight.  Maverick hid her children in the house and watched the battle through the windows.  At one point she was curious enough to go outside for a closer look, but was ordered to return indoors by a soldier.  The skirmish continued until all of the Indians were dead or captured.&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1989), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;  In her diary, Maverick wrote that "'All [Indians] had a chance to surrender ... and every one who offered or agreed to give up was taken prisoner and protected.'"&lt;ref name=marks92&gt;Marks (1989), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two&amp;nbsp; days after the battle, Samuel Maverick again left his wife and children alone, under the protection of her two&amp;nbsp;brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1989), p, 93.&lt;/ref&gt; During his business trip, Sam sold many of his lands in South Carolina and Alabama, and bought two&amp;nbsp;years worth of provisions, which he had shipped to [[Linnville, Calhoun County, Texas|Linville, Texas]].  Before he could escort the goods on to San Antonio, Linville was raided by a party led by [[Buffalo Hump]], during the [[Great Raid of 1840]], and all of their provisions were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1989), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1840, Maverick's aunt and uncle, John and Ann Bradley, arrived in Texas from Alabama along with their young children.  Happy to be surrounded by family again, Maverick expanded her own family in April 1841 with the birth of her daughter Agatha.&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1989), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that year, Maverick's mother, Agatha Adams, planned a journey to visit them and to consider settling in Texas.  She fell ill days before she was scheduled to leave, however, and died on October 2.&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1989), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Runaway of '42==
The citizens of San Antonio received word in February 1842 that Mexican president [[Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna]] was again sending troops into Texas, which Mexico still did not recognize as a separate country.  The Mavericks left some of their possessions with Mexican neighbors and joined their other Anglo neighbors in the Runaway of '42.  With her brothers William and Andrew, Maverick and her immediate family travelled east, the first time Maverick had left San Antonio since her arrival.&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1989), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;  For several days, she and the children boarded with a rancher outside of [[Seguin, Texas|Seguin]] while her husband and brothers returned to San Antonio to fight.  On March 6, the sixth anniversary of the fall of the [[Battle of the Alamo|Alamo]], Maverick received word that San Antonio had fallen to Santa Anna.  She worried about her men for several days until they appeared, having turned back before reaching San Antonio.  The Mavericks moved on to [[Gonzales, Texas|Gonzales]], where they squatted in a house left empty when its residents had fled in the Runaway.&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1989), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The men accompanied Texas army troops to retake San Antonio, and the Mexican army retreated without a fight, although they caused a great deal of damage to the homes of American citizens.   Samuel Maverick returned to his wife and moved her to [[LaGrange, Texas|LaGrange]] so that she would be farther from the threat of Indian attacks.  On April 30 he left Maverick alone there while he returned to Alabama to get her younger sister, Elizabeth, who had been living as a boarder since her mother died the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1989), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Samuel Maverick returned to San Antonio without his family in late August 1842 to argue a case before the district court.  The Mexican army, under General [[Adrian Woll]], surrounded San Antonio and captured the small number of Anglo-American men in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1989), p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 15, Samuel Maverick and his countrymen were forced to march toward Mexico.  Mary Maverick's brothers participated in the Battle of the Salado on September 18, where their company ambushed some of the Mexican soldiers, killing 60 of them.  Her uncle John Bradley joined another company, and Maverick sent her slave Griffin to go with him.  She instructed Griffin to pose as a runaway slave bound for Mexico in the hope that he would be able to help free Samuel Maverick.  As an extra assurance, she gave Griffin funds that could be used to ransom back her husband.  This band of Texans was surprised by a Mexican cavalry detachment.&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1989), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Griffin was killed in the battle, and Bradley was taken captive and marched to join Samuel Maverick and the other prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1989), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  Maverick continued to receive letters from her husband during his captivity, so that she could be comforted that he was still alive.&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1989), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other==
Mary Maverick bore ten children over a span of 21 years.  Four died of illness before the age of eight, which led Mary to seek solace in the [[spiritualism]] which was increasingly popular in mid-19th-century America. As her surviving children grew up, she became active in the public sphere. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], while four of her sons served in the [[Confederate States Army]], she was active in San Antonio relief efforts. Her memoirs relate her attempts to revive the then-dying art of homespun cloth production to supply the needs of the Confederate cause.  A devout [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]], she was instrumental in establishing St. Mark's Church in San Antonio and served as president of the Ladies' Parish Aid Society.

==Later life==
After Sam's death in 1870, as San Antonio grew, Mary Maverick made efforts to see that the pioneer past was not forgotten. She was a prominent member of the [[San Antonio Historical Society]] and the [[Daughters of the Republic of Texas]]. She helped promote the annual [[Fiesta San Antonio|Battle of Flowers]] celebration, and devoted effort to the restoration and preservation of [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|the Alamo as an historic site]].

Her watercolor sketch of the Alamo, completed during her first residence in San Antonio, is one of the earliest-known depictions after the battle.  Although she did not herself immigrate to [[Republic of Texas|Texas]] until two years after the [[Battle of the Alamo|fall of the Alamo]], in 1889 she wrote a brief account of the battle based on the recollections of witnesses. She died on February 24, 1898, and was buried beside her husband at [[San Antonio City Cemetery]] Number 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|16319678|Mary Ann Adams Maverick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memoirs==
Throughout her life, Mary had kept [[Diary|diaries]] of her experiences. In 1895, with the help of her son George Madison Maverick, she published these as her memoirs. They provide an engrossing and vivid picture of life on the Texas frontier and mid-19th-century [[San Antonio]], including household management, child-rearing and family life, medical practices, and social and political observations. Mary Maverick's writings, in particular her eyewitness account of the [[Council House Fight]] in San Antonio in 1840, are often cited in studies of Texas pioneer life.

In particular, she claimed that Matilda Lockhart, the white captive who was returned by the [[Comanche]]s to [[White people|white]] authorities on that day, had been beaten, raped and had suffered burns to her body. Allegedly, her face was severely disfigured, with her nose entirely burned away, a detail which has been commonly included in Texas history descriptions of the incident since the publications of the Maverick memoirs in 1895.&lt;ref name=matildalockhart&gt;{{Citation|title=Matilda Lockhart|publisher=[[Handbook of Texas]]|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/flo02|accessdate=2007-11-02|last=Upchurch|first=Alice Gray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports of abuse are, however, conspicuously missing in primary documents authored by eyewitnesses immediately after the event. Neither Col. Hugh McLeod mentioned any abuse in his report of March 20, 1840 (commenting on the intelligence of the girl but nothing like a missing nose), nor any other Texas officials at the time nor Matilda Lockhart's own sister-in-law, who was in San Antonio, in a letter written to her own mother shortly after the release. Anderson writes: "While published in the 1890s, this description has been used by historians to claim that the massacre came about as a result of the justifiable rage of Texas men. Yet none of the Texas officials claimed this to be the case at the time; evidence of abuse is conspicuously missing in the primary documents. Maverick may have exaggerated Lockhart's condition because of the growing criticism of Texas in the American and European Press. The most significant source on Matilda's condition is a brief statement made in a letter by her sister-in-law, Catherine Lockhart, who was in San Antonio. Catherine describes Matilda's release but says nothing of abuse."&lt;ref&gt;Anderson(2005) pp. 181 f.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Matthaus 19 years.jpg|thumb|Matthäus Schwarz at the age of 19. A typical page from the Trachtenbuch.]]

'''Matthäus Schwarz''' (19 February 1497 - c.1574) was a German accountant, best known for compiling his ''Klaidungsbüchlein'' or ''Trachtenbuch'' (usually translated as "Book of Clothes"), a book cataloguing the clothing that he wore between 1520 and 1560.  The book has been described as "the world's first fashion book".&lt;ref name=grauniad&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22766029 Fashion: The accountant who created the first book of fashion], BBC News, 9 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Schwarz was born in [[Augsburg]], the son of Ulrich Schwartz the Younger, a wine merchant.  His family were originally carpenters from [[Gersthofen|Rettenbergen]] in Bavaria, but moved to Augsburg in the 15th century.  His grandfather, also Ulrich Schwarz, became master of the carpenters' guild in Augsburg, and served as mayor of Augsburg from 1469 to 1477, but fell from power after disputes with the leading families in the city and was executed in 1478.

Schwartz was educated in Augsburg and [[Heidenheim, Bavaria|Heidenheim]].  His mother died in 1502.  His Latin was not good enough for him to emulate his brother by becoming a monk, so he worked for his father and then became a merchant's apprentice in Milan and Venice, where he learned accounting techniques.

==Professional career==
He began to work for the wealthy Augsburg merchant [[Jakob Fugger]] in 1516, and wrote manuscript on accounting entitled ''Dreierlay Buchhaltung'' (three-fold bookkeeping) in 1518.  The work remained unpublished but was rewritten by Schwartz in 1550 and eventually published in the early 20th century.  Fugger, known as Fugger of the Lily or Fugger the Rich, was a member of the [[Fugger]] family of bankers and merchants, who accumulated great wealth as banker for the [[Habsburg]] dynasty before his death in 1525.  Fugger bequeathed assets worth over 2 million [[guilders]] to his nephew, [[Anton Fugger]], for whom Schwartz also worked.

Schwartz's father died in 1519.  The same year, Schwartz started an autobiography, ''De Wellt lauff'' ("The way of the world"), which has not survived.

==Book of Clothes==
Schwarz was fascinated by clothing, spent a large part of his income on clothes, and documented his appearance and outfits throughout his adult life. He would have needed a servant to enable him to dress. This was from a time in history when it was in recent times generally thought that interest in fashion and sumptuous dressing was for the high ranks of society and [[aristocracy]] only, and when [[sumptuary law]]s stipulated the dress and jewellery appropriate for a person's [[Social class|social rank]] and [[social status|station]]; Schwarz dressed carefully not to break the law,  for example wearing fancy sleeves if fancy [[Hose (clothing)|hose]] were forbidden.&lt;ref name=grauniad/&gt;

From 1520 to 1560, he commissioned artists to make accurate watercolour paintings of him on parchment, showing him in his fashionable dress, possibly as an appendix to his autobiography.  The works includes 36 images by [[Narziss Renner]] in 1520 which reconstruct Schwartz's life to that point, from his birth, as an infant, schoolboy, and apprentice.  Schwartz commissioned 101 more images over the next 40 years, mostly by Renner until 1536 and then by artists from the studio of [[Christoph Amberger]].  The portraits include front and rear nude portraits of Schwartz in 1526 aged 29 (when he had become "fat and large" - some of the earliest fully naked male images in Northern European art), and his recovery from a stroke aged 52, as well as pictures of his festive clothing for the visit of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] for the [[Diet of Augsburg]] in 1518, for Anton Fugger's wedding in 1527, and for a visit of the [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand, Duke of Austria]] in 1530, the sombre black mourning robes for his father's death in 1519, and ending with a picture of Schwartz as an old man mourning the death of Anton Fugger in 1560.  Schwartz added manuscript comments to the images explaining when each outfit was worn, and his Latin motto, ''Omne quare suum quia'' (every because has a why).

Schwartz had the completed work was bound into a book chronicling his life that he called his ''Klaidungsbüchlein'' (literally, "clothing booklet"), but also known now as his ''Trachtenbuch'' ("Book of Clothes").  Parallels can be drawn with the Emperor Maximilian's heavily illustrated semi-autobiographical works, ''[[Theuerdank]]'', ''[[Weisskunig]]'' and ''[[Freydal]]''.  Schwartz encouraged his son to continue the project, but the latter soon lost interest.   Schwartz has been nicknamed "Kleidernarr" (literally "clothes-fool"), although Groebner speculates that the meticulous cataloguing of his clothing may be an extension of his accountant's desire to document everything.

The original book of clothes is conserved by the [[Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum]] in [[Braunschweig]].  There are also two copies, made in 1740, one in the [[Bibliothèque nationale]] in Paris and the other in the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Bibliothek]] in [[Hanover]].  A detailed account of the work was published by art historian [[August Fink]] in ''Die Schwarz'schen Trachtenbücher'' (Berlin, 1963).

He married Barbara Mangold in 1538.  A pair of portraits of Schwartz and his wife in 1542 by [[Christoph Amberger]] are held by the [[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]] and the [[Kisters Collection]] respectively.

He was ennobled by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1541, and died in Augsburg in c.1574.

'''Max Farrand''' (March 29, 1869&amp;nbsp;– June 17, 1945) was an [[United States|American]] historian, who taught at several universities and was the first director of the [[Huntington Library]].

==Early life==
He was born in [[Newark, New Jersey]], [[United States]]. He graduated from [[Princeton University|Princeton]] (A. B., 1892; Ph.D., 1896).

==Career==
Farrand taught at [[Wesleyan University]], then after several years at [[Leland Stanford Junior University|Stanford University]], and a year at [[Cornell University]], he became a professor of history at [[Yale University]] (1908-1925).  His particular area of interest and expertise was the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], the organization of the United States after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Farrand was also director of the [[Commonwealth Fund]], founded in 1918 by [[Anna M. Harkness]], widow of [[Stephen V. Harkness]] investor in [[Standard Oil]], who wanted to “do something for the welfare of mankind.”

Max Farrand also assisted philanthropist [[Henry E. Huntington]] to establish the [[Huntington Library]], which is located on the historic '[[Rancho Huerta de Cuati]]' in [[San Marino, California|San Marino]] near [[Pasadena, California]]. After Huntington's death in 1927, Farrand became the library's first director, serving until 1941.

Professor Farrand made many contributions to historical publications during his lifetime, as well as wrote the following books:
* ''Legislation of Congress for the Government of the Organized Territories of the United States, 1789-1895'' (1896)
* ''Translation of Jellinek's Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizens'' (Translation from German to English) (1901)
* ''Records of Federal Convention of 1787'' (three volumes, 1911) (vol. IV, published in 1937, remains under copyright; also reprinted in 1923, 1927 and 1934)
* ''The Framing of the Constitution of the United States'' (1913)
* ''Development of the United States'' (1918)
* ''The Fathers of the Constitution'' (1921)
* ''The Founders Of The Union'' (1926)

In 1940, Farrand, as President of the [[American Historical Society]] delivered an address describing his views on history and the war then beginning, which he saw as a clash of civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/presidential-addresses/max-farrand&lt;/ref&gt;

Max Farrand's final work, an examination of the letters of [[Benjamin Franklin]] (removing transcription errors of its first editor, [[John Bigelow]]), was published posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;Vernor W. Crane, Max Farrand and Benjamin Franklin's Memoirs, ''Modern Philology'' Vol 47, no. 2 (November, 1949) p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
In 1913, while chairman of the history department at Yale University, Farrand married the renowned [[landscape architect]] [[Beatrix Farrand]], the niece of the novelist and socialite [[Edith Wharton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beatrixfarrandsociety.org/beatrix-farrand Beatrix Farrand profile], beatrixfarrandsociety.org; accessed September 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; They remodeled her family's home, [[Reef Point Estate]] in [[Bar Harbor, Maine|Bar Harbor]] on [[Mount Desert Island]] in [[Maine]], where they spent summers while Farrand held positions in California and lived in [[Montecito, California|Montecito]] near [[Santa Barbara, California]]. They had no children. His brother was the researcher [[Livingston Farrand]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Death and legacy==
The Farrands retired to [[Reef Point Estate|Reef Point estate]] in [[Bar Harbor, Maine|Bar Harbor]], which they planned to establish as an independent and self-perpetuating educational corporation. Max Farrand died there in 1945 and Beatrix Farrand established the foundation as they had planned. However, she came to realize in 1955, after a wildfire destroyed part of those gardens, that their plan for the foundation was impractical. She demolished the main house and uprooted the garden ([[John D. Rockefeller]] purchasing the azaleas for his own Asticou Azalea Garden in [[Northeast Harbor, Maine]] where they continue to flower),&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, David, Beatrix. The Gardening Life of Beatrix Farrand, 1872-1959. (Viking, Penguin Group,1995), p. 90. {{ISBN|0-670-83217-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; donated their extensive library and herbarium specimens to the [[University of California at Berkeley]] where researchers could more readily access it than in Maine, and lived the final three years of her life at Garland Farm nearby.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beatrixfarrandsociety.org/beatrix-farrand/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Farrands are buried at [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in New York City.

During the Bicentennial Celebrations, James Hutson, head of the Manuscripts Division of the Library of Congress, edited a revised edition of Farrand's four volume, The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787 (Yale University Press, 1976).&lt;ref&gt;https://journals.psu.edu/pmhb/article/viewFile/44290/44011&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22416">'''Menander of Ephesus''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Μένανδρος}}; fl. c. early 2nd century BC) was the historian whose [[lost work]]  on the history of [[Tyre, Lebanon#History|Tyre]] was used by [[Josephus]], who quotes Menander's [[list of kings of Tyre]] in his [[apologia]] for the Jews, ''[[Against Apion]]'' (1.18). "This Menander wrote the Acts that were done both by the Greeks and Barbarians&lt;ref&gt;The reference to the acts of "both by the Greeks and Barbarians" is a clear allusion to [[Herodotus]], who uses the same expression in the introduction to his own work.&lt;/ref&gt;, under every one of the Tyrian kings, and had taken much pains to learn their history out of their own records." All records having been lost, this second-hand report is the basis for the traditional king-list. Menander, living in a city with a considerable population of [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenized Jews]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=400&amp;letter=E ''Jewish Encyclopedia'': "Ephesus"].&lt;/ref&gt; also seems to have written on the history of the [[Jews]], often cited by Josephus.{{dubious|Considering this: any source speculating that Menander took his inf. on Hiram I from the Bible? That would mean: NO mention of Hiram from extra-biblical sources.|date=July 2016}}

==Sources==
The only extant sources for the writing of Menander are citations of his work found in Josephus’s two works ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' and ''[[Against Apion]]'', or in extracts from Josephus's works found in later writers. These later writers were [[Theophilus of Antioch]], [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], and [[George Syncellus]]. William Barnes&lt;ref&gt;William H. Barnes, ''Studies in the Chronology of the Divided Monarchy of Israel'' (Atlanta, GA: Scholars Press, 1991) 40.&lt;/ref&gt; lists the following sources that scholars use to reconstruct the text of Menander:
*''Codex Laurentianus'', 10th or 11th centuries AD, has the earliest Greek manuscript for ''Against Apion'', but Barnes (p.&amp;nbsp;70) says it is "faulty in many respects."
*There is an Old Latin version of Josephus's citations of Menander in the writings of [[Cassiodorus]].
*Menander's list of kings from [[Abibaal]], father of [[Hiram I]], to [[Pygmalion of Tyre|Pygmalion]], as taken from ''Against Apion'' 1.18, is found in the "To Autolycus" of [[Theophilus of Antioch]].
*All Greek manuscripts of Eusebius's ''Chronography'' have been lost, but an Armenian translation has virtually the entire text.
*Fragments of Eusebius's ''Chronography'' are found in later Greek writers.
*Greek excerpts from the ''Chronography'' are found in [[George Syncellus|Syncellus]].

==Contents of surviving extracts of Menander==
The exact title borne by Menander's lost work is not made clear by Josephus, who gives the following descriptions when he cites Menander: “Menander also, one who translated the Tyrian archives out of the dialect of the Phoenicians into the Greek language&amp;#133;” (''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Ant]]''. 8.5.3). “Menander&amp;#133;when he wrote his Chronology, and translated the Archives of Tyre into the Greek language&amp;#133;” ''Ant''. 9.14.2. “Menander wrote the Acts that were done both by the Greeks and Barbarians, under every one of the Tyrian Kings” (''[[Against Apion]]'' 1.18).

Josephus only cited Menander as a means to authenticate themes of his own writings. One such theme was the antiquity of the Jewish people, for which Josephus summoned Menander and several other non-Jewish historians to support his case. In terms of chronology, the earliest event to which Josephus calls Menander as his witness is the reign of Solomon. In ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Ant.]]'' 8.5.3, Josephus describes the help that [[Hiram I|Hiram]], king of Tyre, provided for the building of Solomon's Temple. A description of Hiram's building projects in Tyre is then quoted from Menander in order to show the historicity of the Hiram mentioned in the Bible. A few other details about Hiram are added, including an exchange of riddles between Solomon and Hiram. In ''Ant.'' 8.13.2, the drought in Israel in the days of Elijah (1 Kings 17 and 18) is equated, by Josephus, with a drought that Menander said occurred in the days of Ethbaal ([[Ithobaal I]], 878-847 BC), king of the Tyrians. In ''Ant.'' 9.14.2, after relating that [[Shalmaneser V]] was responsible for the destruction of Samaria (2 Kings 17:3-6), Menander is cited as bearing witness to the existence of Shalmaneser. Here Menander says that the king of Tyre during this time was named Eluleus, who reigned 36 years, and who successfully endured a siege of five years started by Shalmaneser. 

To historians, the most interesting portion of Menander's writing that has been preserved in found in ''[[Against Apion]]'' 1.18. Here Josephus again demonstrates the antiquity of his nation, as attested by historians outside his own national tradition. Bringing up Solomon and his contemporary [[Hiram I|Hiram]], Josephus cites Menander's list of the kings of Tyre from Abibalus (''[[Abibaal]]''), father of Hiram, down to Pygmalion, with the years of reign of each king, as well as the years of their life. For Pygmalion, it is related that “he lived fifty-eight years&lt;ref&gt;Some manuscripts give 56 years (Barnes, ''Studies'' 42,43).&lt;/ref&gt; and reigned forty-seven. It was in the seventh year of his reign that his sister took flight, and built the city of Carthage in Libya."&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Against Apion'' in Loeb Classical Library, tr. H. St. John Thackeray (Cambridge, MA: Harvard Univ. Press, 1956). Some manuscripts give 56 years for Hiram's lifespan instead of 58.&lt;/ref&gt; After ending his quotation from Menander with this sentence, Josephus summarizes Menander’s list of kings as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The whole period from the accession of Hirom (Hiram) to the foundation of Carthage thus amounts to 155 years and eight months; and, since the temple at Jerusalem was built in the twelfth year of King Hirom's reign, 143 years and eight months elapsed between the erection of the temple and the foundation of Carthage.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For a discussion of the importance of this passage in establishing the chronology of the kings of Tyre, see below, and also the [[Pygmalion of Tyre|Pygmalion]] and [[Hiram I|Hiram]] articles.

==Modern evaluations of Menander’s writings==

===Evaluations based on literary analysis===
Some modern historians have considered Josephus’s ostensible citations of Menander from a literary-analysis standpoint. The important question that they were addressing was whether Josephus’s quotations were just that, or were another example of his putting his own ideas and words into someone else’s mouth (pen). Josephus was frequently bold to do just this, notably in cases such as when a general, addressing his troops, provided an opportunity for Josephus to display his own eloquence. However, three lines of evidence indicate that this was not the case with the texts purporting to come from Menander. The first line of evidence is literary.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dius [another Hellenistic historian cited by Josephus] calls Solomon “the sovereign of Jerusalem” (''ho turannos Ierosolumon'')  while Menander refers to him as “the king of Jerusalem” (''ho Ierosolumon basileus''). This appellation is clear proof of the Tyrian source of these passages, for the kings of the Phoenician coast, who ruled principally over one city, looked upon Solomon as a monarch of a city, like themselves; nor did Josephus correct this “flaw”, even in an account where he endeavors to exalt the greatness of Solomon. Great weight must be attached to the testimony of Dius and Menander as cited by Josephus, for these are the only mentions of Solomon’s name in a foreign source—perhaps a Tyrian source that stems from the time of Solomon himself!&lt;ref&gt;H. Jacob Katzenstein, ''The History of Tyre'' (Jerusalem: Goldberg’s Press, 1973) 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The author of this passage, Jacob Katzenstein, makes two other comments that suggest that Josephus was not merely putting forth his own writing and ideas under Menander's name:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The regnal years and the life-spans of the rulers are not given in round numbers, so there is no reason to doubt the veracity of this tradition. Moreover, Josephus does not digress from listing the kings of Tyre even to comment on Ethbaal (Ithobal), the father-in-law of Ahab, although he is mentioned in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Katzenstein, ''History of Tyre'' 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Commenting further on the form in which Josephus presents the years of the kings in the ''[[Against Apion]]'' passage, William Barnes writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt; Indeed, the numbers appear to be taken directly from some sort of formulaic archival source or king list, which gave only the life span and regnal total for each king of Tyre plus brief remarks pertaining to his dynastic status (cf. the seemingly superfluous retention [at least for Josephus’ purposes] of the numbers for the life spans of the various kings).&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Studies'' 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The literary conventions mentioned by these historians have therefore led them to the position that Menander’s actual words, not just Josephus’s own ideas, are to be found in the various texts where Josephus says he is citing Menander.

===Evaluations based on inscriptional evidence===
Josephus’s citations of Menander contain references to Shalmaneser (V), Sennacherib, and Esarhaddon, kings of Assyria that are well known both from Biblical texts and also from numerous Assyrian inscriptions. More important, however, for the question of the historicity of the Menander texts is his mention of kings who were not so famous, especially those for whom there had been no evidence outside Menander until fairly recent times. 
*In ''[[Against Apion]]'' 1.18, Menander names Balazeros as the grandfather of Pygmalion. [[Frank Moore Cross]]&lt;ref&gt;F. M. Cross, “An Interpretation of the Nora Stone,” ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'' 208 (Dec. 1972) 17 n. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and other scholars have equated this Balazeros ([[Baal-Eser II]]) with (Ba‘l-mazzer) who gave tribute to Shalmaneser III in 841 BC (see the [[Baal-Eser II]] article for details).
*''Against Apion'' 1.18 also mentions Pygmalion as a ruler of Tyre, relating that his sister [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] fled from him in his seventh year, 155 years after the beginning of the reign of [[Hiram I]]. A 9th-century BC inscription found on Sardinia apparently names Pygmalion, as described in the [[Pygmalion of Tyre|Pygmalion]] article.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, ''Nora Stone'' 13-19.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''Ant.'' 9.14.2, Menander, as cited by Josephus, mentions Eluleus as refusing to pay tribute to [[Sennacherib]] (725-722 BC), whereupon the Assyrians unsuccessfully besieged Tyre for five years. The conflict with Sennacherib with "Luli," king of Tyre, is corroborated by at least three inscriptions of the Assyrian monarch.&lt;ref&gt;James B. Pritchard, ed., ''Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament'' (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1969) 287-288.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians generally equate the name “Luli”, in Sennacherib’s [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], with the Greek form Eluleus.

These inscriptional evidences for lesser-known kings not mentioned in the Hebrew Bible have therefore been taken as lending credence to Menander’s writings. For each of them, the time frame that Menander assigns to them is in agreement with the time assigned to their inscriptional evidence by modern historians.

===Evaluations based on the time from Hiram to Pygmalion===
As cited above from ''Ant''. 1.18, Menander gave 155 years from the first year of Hiram's reign until the seventh year of Pygmalion, at which time Pygmalion's sister [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]], also known as Elissa, fled from Tyre, after which she founded [[Carthage]] in North Africa. This reference in Menander is unique not only for its chronological correlation of the time between Hiram and Pygmalion, but also because virtually all texts of Josephus/Menander that have come down to us, including the citations of Josephus's work in other writers, have preserved this total of 143 years and eight months from the start of construction of Solomon's Temple, in the 12th year of the reign of Hiram (''Against Apion'' 1.18/126), until Dido's flight. This is in contrast with the lengths of reign for the individual monarchs between Hiram and Pygmalion, for which there is considerable variance in the copies of the various texts. But the overall figure of 143 years has been preserved by a fortuitous circumstance: it is repeated in three instances in Josephus, and in one of these instances it is not given as simply 143 years, but as 155 years from the start of Hiram's reign until the time that construction began for the Temple, which was in Hiram's 12th year (''[[Against Apion]]'' 1.17,18). This triple redundancy has preserved the total of years from Hiram to Dido as originally recorded, even though the various extracts of Menander found in Josephus, Eusebius, Syncellus, and Theodotion disagree in other matters, due to the error of copyists through the centuries of written transmission. Modern historians therefore have generally given considerable credibility to this figure, using it to measure back 155 years from the date for the founding of Carthage in order to arrive at the regnal years of Hiram.

====Menander’s date for construction of Temple====
The problem with this calculation, however, lay in determining which date to use for the founding of Carthage. Here, classical authors gave two years: 825 BC as given by [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus|Pompeius Trogus]], or 814 BC as given by [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]]. Although earlier historians generally preferred the 814 date, the publication of an inscription of [[Shalmaneser III]] relating the receipt of tribute from Ba’li-manzer of Tyre (apparently [[Baal-Eser II]], grandfather of Pygmalion) in 841 BC has caused many scholars such as [[Frank Moore Cross|Frank M. Cross]] to favor the 825 date, because that date was consistent with the best texts of Menander for the reign lengths of Baal-Eser and his son [[Mattan I]], whereas the 814 date was in conflict with these texts. Joachim Peñuela has argued that the 825 B.C. date of Pompeius Trogus and the 814 B.C. date of Timaeus and other writers are both correct when properly understood.  Based on a citation from Strabo (17.3.14-15) plus a fragmentary ancient Greek text describing Dido’s various time-consuming activities after she left Tyre but before the people of North Africa granted her permission to build a city, Peñuela contends that eleven years elapsed between her flight and the foundation (or possibly, dedication) of the city, thus explaining the apparent discrepancy between Trogus and Timaeus in this matter.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Peñuela, “La Inscripción Asiria IM 55644 y la cronología de los reyes de Tiro,” ''Sefarad'' 14 (1954): 28-29 and nn. 164-67.&lt;/ref&gt; For a fuller discussion, see the [[Pygmalion of Tyre|Pygmalion]] article.

Accepting that 825 BC was Pygmalion's seventh year and the ending point of the 155 years, Hiram's first year becomes 825 + 155 = 980 BC. His twelfth year, the year in which Temple construction began, would then be 968 BC. There is some slight uncertainty here because neither Josephus, Menander, or Pompeius Trogus, in the texts that have come down to us, relate which calendar they were using for reckoning the years: Roman, Macedonian, or Phoenician. But this consideration would not make a difference of more than a year or two, so that Barnes states,
&lt;blockquote&gt;[F]or the present we may conclude quite confidently that the Tyrian king list of Menander as preserved in Josephus' ''Contra Apionem'' [Latin for ''Against Apion''], 1:117-26, coupled with the dated reference in Shalmaneser's annals to the Tyrian king ''Ba'li-manzer'' and the date of Pompeius Trogus for the founding of Carthage, provide a firm external synchronism for biblical chronology, and particularly for the dating of the founding of Solomon's temple in 968 (the twelfth year of Hiram of Tyre), as well as the dating of Solomon's accession to 971. A variation of a year or two is possible, of course, especially in the light of our ignorance of Phoenician dating practices, but I seriously doubt that an error of more than two years either way is likely.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Studies'' 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Biblical date for construction of Temple====
First Kings 6:1 says that Temple construction began in the spring month of Ziv (Iyyar in the modern Jewish calendar) in the fourth year of the reign of Solomon. Assigning a date to this in modern terms depends on determining a date for the death of Solomon and the subsequent division of the kingdom. The date of the division of the kingdom was calculated by [[Edwin R. Thiele|Edwin Thiele]] as occurring some time between the first of Nisan (roughly April) of 931 BC and the day before Nisan 1 of 930 BC. Thiele's logic in this matter was based on fixed dates for the presence of [[Ahab]] at the [[Battle of Qarqar]] in 853 BC and Jehu's tribute to [[Shalmaneser III]] in 841 BC. Thiele showed that when non-accession years were assumed for the northern kingdom of Israel and accession years were assumed for the southern kingdom (Judah), the regnal lengths of both kingdoms, as measured back from the Battle of Qarqar, produced the same result of 931 BC for the first year of the divided kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin R. Thiele, ''The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings'' (3rd ed.; Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan/Kregel, 1981) 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the extensive cross-synchronisms between the two kingdoms for these 78 years all worked out exactly, giving extra support for the credibility of the Biblical records that allowed this calculation of 931/930 for the division of the kingdom. Thiele's logic in this matter has been acknowledged by a broad spectrum of historians of the Bible and the ancient Near East, and is accepted in the ''Cambridge Ancient History'' and in much of recent scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;T. C. Mitchell, “Israel and Judah until the Revolt of Jehu (931-841 B.C.),” ''Cambridge Ancient History'' 3, Part 1, 445-446. For a partial list of other scholars who accept 931/30 for the division of the kingdom, see the [[Edwin R. Thiele]] article in Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thiele established that the northern kingdom of Judah measured its regnal years from the fall month of Tishri, the month in which [[Rosh Hashanah]], the Jewish New Year, continues to be celebrated in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Thiele, ''Mysterious Numbers'' 51-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Thiele's logic for determining the year of the division of the kingdom was built on reckoning in Nisan-based years, such as were used in the northern kingdom. Solomon's 40th or last year, then, since it was reckoned according to a Tishri-based year, could have begun either in Tishri of 932 or Tishri of 931 BC. Thiele assumed the latter, which led him into conflicts with the later reigns of Ahaziah and Athaliah that he never resolved. These conflicts disappear when it is assumed that Solomon's 40th year began in Tishri of 932. Leslie McFall, a foremost interpreter of Thiele's work, now accepts the results of a 2003 study by Rodger Young&lt;ref&gt;Rodger C. Young, “When Did Solomon Die?” ''Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society'' 46:4 (2003) 589-603.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating that the Biblical data require that Solomon's last year began in Tishri of 932 BC instead of Tishri of 931 as given by Thiele.&lt;ref&gt;Link to McFall's web site that indicates this change from his previous reckoning that followed Thiele for the reign of Solomon: [http://lmf12.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/hebrew_revised_kings.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Moore Cross|F. M. Cross]] and his student Wm. H. Barnes had also arrived at the date of 968/67 BC for the beginning of construction of the Temple, based solely on the Tyrian data of Menander. Unknown to Moore and Barnes, in the 1920s the Belgian scholar [[Valerius Coucke]] had likewise deduced that construction on Solomon's Temple began in 968/67 BC, based on the same Tyrian data used by Moore and Barnes, but also utilizing information from the [[Parian Chronicle|Parian Marble]] and other classical sources to confirm and refine this date.&lt;ref&gt;V. Coucke, “Chronologie biblique” in ''Supplément au Dictionnaire de la Bible'', ed. Louis Pirot, vol. 1 (Paris: Librairie Letouzey et Ané, 1928), cols. 1245–79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodger C. Young, “The Parian Marble and Other Surprises from Chronologist V. Coucke,” ''Andrews University Seminary Studies'' 48 (2010): 225-49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodger C. Young and Andrew E. Steinmann, "Correlation of Select Classical Sources Related to the Trojan War with Assyrian and Biblical Chronologies," ''Journal for the Evangelical Study Study of the Old Testament,'' 1:2 (2012) 2-8 [http://jesot.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/JESOT-1.2-Young-Steinmann.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; 

These chronological considerations date Solomon's fourth year as beginning in the fall of 968 BC, so that Temple construction began in the following spring, 967 BC. This is an additional demonstration of the trustworthiness that can be assigned to Josephus's citations of Menander, whose writings were used by the scholars listed above to date the beginning of Temple construction in 968/67 BC. In particular, it authenticates the 155 years measured back from Dido's flight to the start of the reign of Hiram, since the method of determining the date for the start of construction of Solomon's Temple as derived from Menander of Ephesus is "wholly independent"&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Studies'' 31.&lt;/ref&gt; of the means of deriving this date from the Biblical data. For many modern scholars, the agreement of these two methods, exact within one year, has caused a new appreciation of the works of the ancient historian Menander, as preserved in the writings of Josephus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9161">{{nihongo|'''Minoru Kitamura'''|北村稔|Kitamura Minoru|extra=born 1948}} is a Japanese historian. He is a professor at [[Ritsumeikan University]] whose academic speciality is modern Chinese history.

== Life and career ==
He was born in [[Kyoto Prefecture]]. He completed his bachelor's degree with a major in modern history at the Department of Humanities at [[Kyoto University]] in 1973. He initially dropped out of a doctorate program at the same university but in 1999 finally attained his doctorate in law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research-db.ritsumei.ac.jp/Profiles/34/0003325/profile.html |title=立命館大学 文学部 東洋研究学域 北村 稔 |publisher=Research-db.ritsumei.ac.jp |date= |accessdate=2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as an assistant professor at [[Mie University]] before taking up his current post at the humanities department of Ritsumeikan University. He is also a member of the Japan Association for Nanjing Studies and an associate researcher at the [[Japan Institute for National Fundamentals]].

== The Politics of Nanjing: An Impartial Investigation ==
In 2001 his book ''Nankin Jiken no Tankyū: Sono Jitsuzō wo Motomete'' was published by [[Bungeishunju]], later translated into English as ''The Politics of Nanjing: An Impartial Investigation''. In the book he analyzes the [[Nanjing Massacre]] in an attempt to use historical methods to verify the "war crime" verdict pronounced at the [[Tokyo Trials]] and the [[Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal]]. Though on the one hand he confirms using newly discovered data the massacre of less than 20,000 Chinese POWs by the Japanese army, he concludes through analysis of many types of Chinese and Allied wartime propaganda that the perception of the war crimes tribunals, that a huge massacre of ordinary civilians had occurred reaching hundreds of thousands of deaths, was gradually invented after 1937. He undertook his research asking the question of how false perceptions about the massacre arose while seeking "a return to the basics of historical research".&lt;ref&gt;Minoru Kitamura, The Politics of Nanjing: An Impartial Investigation, trans. Hal Gold (Lanham, Maryland: University Press of America, 2007), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

He alleges that [[Harold Timperley]], a journalist stationed in China who accused the Japanese army of committing atrocities in Nanking and in many other places in China, engaged in international propaganda work for the [[Kuomintang|KMT]] Central Information Department from immediately after the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and published the edited volume "What War Means" with the KMT's financial support. Kitamura cites "A Biographical Dictionary of Foreigners in China in the Modern Age" written in 1981 by the Chinese Social Sciences Publishing Co., which states that "in 1937, after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, the KMT dispatched [Timperley] to Europe and the United States to engage in propaganda activities", as well as the memoirs of Zeng Xubai, the head of the Kuomintang Central Information Department, who is quoted by Wang Lingxiao, the author of "The KMT's News Administration Policy", as saying, "we decided that our first step would be to make payment to Timperley, and also, through his coordination, to [[Lewis S.C. Smythe|Smythe]], and commission both of them to write and publish two books for us as witnesses to the Nanking Massacre".&lt;ref&gt;Kitamura, 21, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Praise ===
In the January 2002 issue of ''[[Shokun|Shokun!]]'' magazine Kitamura's thesis was reviewed favorably by [[Yoshiko Sakurai]], [[Akira Suzuki (writer)|Akira Suzuki]], Mizuho Ishikawa, and [[Kenichi Ara]].&lt;ref&gt;"発掘「新史料」が証かす「南京虐殺」の虚構," Shokun!, January 2002, 26-37. "「南京事件」の探求』をどう読むか," Shokun!, January 2002, 38-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shudo Higashinakano]] bolstered Kitamura's argument in 2003 following the discovery of a top-secret document written in 1941 called "An Overview of Propaganda Operations of the International Information Division of the Central Information Department of the Nationalist Party: from 1938 to April 1941". The document lists Timperley's "What War Means" as a KMT propaganda book.&lt;ref&gt;Shudo Higashinakano, [http://www.sdh-fact.com/CL02_1/9_S4.pdf The Nanking Massacre: Fact Versus Fiction] (Tokyo: Sekai Shuppan Inc, 2005), 256-258.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
The August 2, 2002, edition of ''Shūkan Kin'yōbi'' presented the criticisms and negative opinions of [[Hisashi Inoue (historian)|Hisashi Inoue]], Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi, Haruki Watanabe, and of [[Tokushi Kasahara]], who labelled Kitamura as a "denier of the Nanjing Massacre".&lt;ref&gt;Kasahara Tokushi, "文春がまた担ぎ出した南京虐殺否定論者のおそまつぶり," Shūkan Kin'yōbi, August 2, 2002, 66–67. Hisashi Inoue, "「常識」という用語を利用した非常識," Shūkan Kin'yōbi, August 2, 2002, 68–69. Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi, "狡猾な引用をされた例として," Shūkan Kin'yōbi, August 2, 2002, 68–69. Haruki Watanabe, "事実を明らかにする姿勢はどこに？," Shūkan Kin'yōbi, August 2, 2002, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hisashi Watanabe criticized Kitamura's thesis in the official bulletin of the [[Association of Returnees from China]], acknowledging problems with the testimony of Zeng Xubai who, for instance, mistakenly reminisced that Timperley was present in Japanese-occupied Nanjing, and also suggesting that Zeng Xubai did not explicitly state a working relationship between Timperley and the KMT Central Information Department, which was only Wang Lingxiao's interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Hisashi Watanabe, "求めているのは実像か虚像か," Chūkiren, summer 2002, 69-72.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Hisashi Inoue has argued that Zeng Xubai's claim to have commissioned Timperley was an error. A document of the KMT Central Information Department from the [[Second Historical Archives of China]] in Nanjing instead reads "We bought up as well as printed first-hand accounts of the Japanese army's massacre at Nanjing, one by Timperley himself and, by means of him, another by Smythe."&lt;ref&gt;Hisashi Inoue, "南京大虐殺と中国国民党国際宣伝処", in 現代歴史学と南京事件, eds. Tokushi Kasahara and Yutaka Yoshida (Tokyo: Kashiwa Shobo, 2006), 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the essays written by Watanabe and Inoue, in 2007 Tokushi Kasahara concluded that "The autobiography of Zeng Xubai is self-serving and unreliable",&lt;ref&gt;Tokushi Kasahara, 南京事件論争史 (Tokyo: Heibonsha Shinsho, 2007), 259.&lt;/ref&gt; and he furthermore pointed to Kitamura's greatest "trick" as his attempt to make his readers think that Timperley wrote the 1938 volume "What War Means" as a Chinese spy before he had actually become a KMT agent in 1939. He also attacked Kitamura on the matter that "He doesn't have a clue about how legal trials work, and he thought that the judges wrote their verdict while quoting from Timperley's book without even being able to distinguish the difference between an indictment and a verdict".&lt;ref&gt;Kasahara, 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other works ==
Kitamura's book ''Daiichiji Kokkyōgassaku no Kenkyū: Gendai Chūgoku wo Keisei Shita Nidai Seiryoku no Shutsugen'' ("Research on the [[First United Front]]: The Emergence of the Two Great Powers that Constitute Modern China") was published by [[Iwanami Shoten, Publishers|Iwanami Shoten]] in 1998. He explains in detail the trends of the [[Chinese Nationalist Party]] and the [[Chinese Communist Party]] that have moved modern China, centering on the establishment, development, and collapse of the cooperative relationship which they forged over the course of the Nationalist Party's unification of China which was tentatively completed in 1928.

In his book ''Chūgoku wa Shakaishugi de Shiawase ni Natta no ka'' ("Has Socialism Made China Happy?"), published by the PHP Institute in 2005, he argues that "The essence of the People's Republic of China is a feudalistic dynasty socialist in name only."

In 2008 the PHP Institute published a book he co-wrote with Lin Siyun entitled ''Nicchū Sensō: Sensō wo Nozonda Chūgoku, Nozomanakatta Nihon'', translated into English as "The Reluctant Combatant: Japan and the Second Sino-Japanese War".

The '''Mobile Guards''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: ''Mishmarot Nayim''; '''המשמר הנע'''), also known as the '''Manim''' from the initials of the Hebrew words, were a branch of the [[Notrim]] in [[Mandatory Palestine]] established at the beginning of the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]] to ambush Arab terrorists and to protect Jewish settlements and workers in their orchards and fields.&lt;ref name=noter&gt;[http://www.historama.com/online-resources/online-gallery/eretz_israel_palestine_noter_jewish_settlement_police_uniform.html Uniform (and History) of Jewish Palestine Police "Noter"]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were about 60 units comprising 400 men. The manim travelled in armoured vehicles.&lt;ref name=noter/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3669">'''Norwegianization''' (''Fornorsking av samer'') was an official policy carried out by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] government directed at the [[Sami people|Sami]] and later the [[Kven people|Kven]] people of northern Norway to assimilate non-Norwegian-speaking native populations into an ethnically and culturally uniform Norwegian population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skuvla.info/skolehist/minde-n.htm ''Fornorskinga av samene'' (Samisk skolehistorie  Davvi Girji 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice has roots in missionary programs of the 1700s, but formally began as official government policy in the late 1800s. Laws were passed prohibiting schooling in the Sami language, and restricting the rights of Sami speakers to purchase land. The laws were motivated by Norwegian nationalism and also by religious differences between Sami and the Norwegian population (Sami practicing [[Sami religion|animism and polytheism]], while the Lutheran [[Church of Norway]] is the official state religion).&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz Khazaleh (2011). "[https://www.uio.no/english/research/interfaculty-research-areas/culcom/news/2008/persen.html The Norwegianization of the Samis was religiously motivated]" accessed 13 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt; As late as the 1950s, Sami people were widely regarded as [[mentally handicapped]], thus justifying [[paternalist]] laws and policy: 'In the folk consensus from 1950, Samis were classified in the same category as the “mentally disabled” and “insane”.'&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz Khazaleh (2011). "[https://www.uio.no/english/research/interfaculty-research-areas/culcom/news/2008/persen.html The Norwegianization of the Samis was religiously motivated]" accessed 13 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norwegianization policy was discontinued in the 1980s and reparations were made in the form of financial support for  [[Sámediggi]], the Sami Parliament of Norway, and other related programs.  In 1997, the King of Norway, [[Majesty|HM]] [[King Harald V]] made an official apology on behalf of the government to the Sami and Kven People because of this government program:&lt;ref&gt;[http://at.yorku.ca/c/a/m/m/60.htm Kristin Strømsnes ''Multicultural Citizenship as Sami in Norway'' (ISTR Sixth International Conference)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|
The state of Norway was founded on the territory of two peoples - the Sámi people and the Norwegians. Sámi history is closely intertwined with Norwegian history. Today, we express our regret on behalf of the state for the injustice committed against the Sámi people through its harsh policy of Norwegianization.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4477">'''Paul-Louis Huvelin''' (1873–1924), generally known as '''Paul Huvelin''', was a French [[Legal history|legal historian]].

He was a specialist in the study of the earliest forms of [[Roman law]].

==Biography==
Huvelin spent almost all his career teaching in the law faculty of the [[University of Lyon]] which he joined in 1899. That year he made contact with the anthropologist [[Marcel Mauss]] and, as a result, gradually became involved with the group of pioneer French sociologists organised by Mauss' uncle [[Emile Durkheim]]. Huvelin, as a respected jurist, was welcomed into the Durkheim group and contributed regularly to Durkheim's famous [[L'Année Sociologique]] yearbook, from its sixth volume, published in 1906, until the series was suspended on the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. Huvelin made important contributions to the sociological study of the earliest forms of [[Western law]]. His imaginative if sometimes speculative scholarship explored links between magic and the emergence of ideas of private rights. He also tried to reformulate Durkheim's own ideas of law to make them more compatible with the instrumental legal outlook of jurists.

Towards the end of his life he became involved with efforts to shore up waning French influence in the [[Middle East]]. As an offshoot of the Lyon law faculty's involvement with legal education in territories associated with France, he was instrumental in the founding of the law school of the [[Université Saint-Joseph]] in [[Beirut]] in 1913. In 1919 he led a mission to [[Syria]] to assess the growing threats to French interests in the region. He died after a short illness in 1924.

A street in Beirut, is named after him, the [[Rue Huvelin]].

'''Pauper apprentices''' in [[England]] and [[Wales]] were the children of [[Pauperism|pauper]]s who were bound out by the local parish overseers and churchwardens. Some had to travel long distances to serve in the factories of the [[industrial revolution]], but the majority served their terms within a few miles of their homes.

'''Peng Xinwei''' 彭信威 (P'eng Hsin-wei) (1907-1967) was a Chinese economic historian, and author of  ''A Monetary History of China''.

==Life==
Peng was born in Yantian, Xixiang, [[Jiangxi]] province, in 1907. After studying in Japan, he became a banker in Shanghai. His approach to economic history was influenced by the work of [[Carl Menger]] and [[Ludwig von Mises]]. Peng also taught at [[Fudan University]] in Shanghai. He died in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Peng Xinwei, A Monetary History of China (Zhongguo huobi shi), translated by Edward H.

==''A Monetary History of China''==
This pioneering work is acclaimed internationally.

"It is a classic in the field of Chinese monetary history and numismatics" - Hans Ulrich Vogel, University of Tuebingen.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel's review of A Monetary History of China (Zhonqguo huobi shi) by Peng Xinwei, Edward H. Kaplan, in the Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 56, No. 4 (Nov., 1997), pp. 1073-1075. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2658318 &lt;/ref&gt;

"His monumental two-volume work, ''A Monetary History of China'', is much more than a history of money. It is a comprehensive history of Chinese economic thought."  - William N. Goetzmann&lt;ref&gt; Goetzmann, in ''Money Changes Everything: how finance made everything possible'' (Princeton University Press, 2017), p.159. &lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Przegląd Tomistyczny: Filozofia - Teologia - Kultura Duchowa Średniowiecza''''' (''Thomistic Review: Philosophy - Theology - Spiritual Culture of the Middle Ages'') is a [[Poland|Polish]] [[Academic journal|journal]] published by [http://www.it.dominikanie.pl/en/ Instytut Tomistyczny] (Thomistic Institute) with its seat in the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[priory]] in [[Warsaw]], [[Służew]]. This review publishes fruits of studies on intellectual and spiritual [[Christian tradition]] with a particular emphasis on Polish heritage, research on [[Middle Ages]], and philosophical and theological quest in the tradition of [[Thomism]].

This review was established in 1984 in continuity with ''Polski Przegląd Tomistyczny'' (''Polish Thomistic Review'') founded by Dominican Friars in January 1939. The calamities of [[World War II]] and crooked history of post-war Poland made this 75 years gap inevitable.

''Przegląd Tomistyczny'' prints original articles and [[book review]]s in [[Polish language|Polish]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], and [[Italian language|Italian]]. It publishes also editions of short historical Latin texts as well as Polish translations of short source texts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3284">'''Thomas Ellis''' (1625 &amp;ndash; April 1673) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] clergyman and [[antiquarian]].

==Life==
Ellis was born at [[Ystumllyn]], near [[Criccieth]], [[Caernarvonshire]]. He [[matriculation|matriculated]] at [[Jesus College, Oxford]] in 1640, graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in 1644, and taking his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] degree in 1646.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8712|title=Ellis, Thomas (1625&amp;ndash;1673)|last=Vian|first=Alsager|author2=Rees, D. Ben |year=2004|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] (online edition, subscription access)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1648, when the [[Parliamentary visitation of the University of Oxford|Parliamentary visitors]] came to the college, and Ellis was asked whether he meant to submit to the authority of Parliament, he replied that he could not "without the hazard of shipwrackinge of my soule".&lt;ref name="WBO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-ELLI-THO-1625.html|title=ELLIS, THOMAS (1625&amp;ndash;1673), cleric and antiquary|last=Richards|first=Thomas|work=Welsh Biography Online|publisher=[[National Library of Wales]]|accessdate=2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later submitted and was appointed [[Fellow#Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin|Fellow]] of the College in 1649, although he was a critic of the Parliamentary-appointed Principal, [[Michael Roberts (college principal)|Michael Roberts]]. Ellis kept his fellowship on the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], becoming vice-principal under [[Francis Mansell]].  He hoped to be appointed to succeed Mansell in 1661, but the position went to [[Leoline Jenkins]] and Ellis then gave up his teaching duties (although he retained his fellowship until 1667).&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;

Ellis had a particular interest in the study of [[Welsh history]]. However, his publication record was not without difficulty. [[Robert Vaughan (Hengwrt)|Robert Vaughan of Hengwrt]] intended to publish a new edition of ''[[Cronica Walliae|The Historie of Cambria]]'' by [[David Powel]] and asked Ellis to complete the work, using Vaughan's notes as well as his own. However, in 1663, after 128 sheets of the book had been printed, Ellis complained that all of Vaughan's material had been published in 1661 by [[Percie Enderbie]] and refused to continue. ''Memoirs of Owen Glendowr'', published in 1775, was attributed to Ellis, but [[John Edward Lloyd|Sir John Edward Lloyd]] later showed that Vaughan had written it, with Ellis simply being the copyist.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;

In 1665, [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], his court and Parliament moved to Oxford to escape the plague, and Ellis's fortunes improved. He succeeded his kinsman [[John Ellis (clergyman died 1665)|John Ellis]] as [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of St Mary's, [[Dolgellau]], [[Merionethshire]].  He died in April 1673 in Ystumllyn, and was buried there.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8078">'''Transferred intent''' (or '''transferred malice''' in [[English law]]) is a legal doctrine that holds that, when the [[intention (criminal law)|intention]] to harm one individual inadvertently causes a second person to be hurt instead, the perpetrator is still held responsible. To be held legally responsible under the law, usually the court must demonstrate that the person has criminal intent, that is, that the person knew another would be harmed by his or her actions and wanted this harm to occur. If a murderer intends to kill John, but accidentally kills George instead, the intent is transferred from John to George, and the killer is held to have had criminal intent.

Transferred intent also applies to tort law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/study/outlines/html/torts/torts01.htm|title=LexisNexis® for Law Schools – Sign In – LexisNexis|website=www.lexisnexis.com|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[tort law]], there are generally five areas in which transferred intent is applicable: [[battery (tort)|battery]], [[assault]], [[false imprisonment]], [[trespass to land]], and [[trespass to chattels]].  Generally, any ''intent'' to cause any one of these five torts which results in the completion of any of the five tortious acts will be considered an intentional act, even if the actual target of the tort is one other than the intended target of the original tort.

See cases of ''Carnes v. Thompson'', (1932) Supreme Court of Missouri. 48 S.W. 2d 903 and ''Bunyan v. Jordan'' (1937), 57 C.L.R. 1, 37 S.R.N.S.W. 119 for examples.

==Discussion==

=== In the United States ===
In US criminal law, transferred intent is sometimes explained by stating that "the intent follows the bullet."  That is, the intent to kill ''person A'' with a bullet will apply even when the bullet kills the unintended victim, ''person B'' (''see [[mens rea]]''). Thus, the ''intent'' is ''transferred'' between victims.  However, intent only transfers between harms of a similar nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Model Penal Code, 2.03(2)|url=http://www1.law.umkc.edu/suni/CrimLaw/MPC_Provisions/model_penal_code_default_rules.htm|accessdate=May 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if the defendant shoots at "Person A" intending to kill "A" but the bullet misses and instead hits a vase, causing it to break, the defendant is not deemed to have intended to break the vase.  This is because destruction of property is a kind of harm different from that contemplated by defendant.  The rationale underlying this distinction is that the defendant has only one intent.  If the law were to deem that the defendant intended to destroy property, it would be placing on him an intent he never had—he would now have both the intent to kill and the intent to destroy property.  In contrast, where the defendant intends to kill one person but ends up killing another, there's still only one intent—the intent to kill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regina v. Faulkner Case Brief|url=http://homepage.mac.com/johnpell/LWSO100/regina%20v.%20faulkner.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is interesting to compare the principle underlying the [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act]] 2004 in the [[United States]] which applies only to offenses over which the U.S. government has jurisdiction, namely crimes committed on [[Federal Government of the United States|Federal]] properties, against certain [[Federal Government of the United States|Federal]] officials and employees, and by members of the military, but treats the [[fetus]] as a separate person for the purposes of all levels of [[assault]] including [[murder]] and [[attempted murder]]:
"Sec. 1841. Protection of unborn children
:(a)(1) Whoever engages in conduct that violates any of the provisions of law listed in subsection (b) and thereby causes the death of, or bodily injury (as defined in section 1365) to, a child, who is in utero at the time the conduct takes place, is guilty of a separate offense under this section.
:(2)(A) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the punishment for that separate offense is the same as the punishment provided under Federal law for that conduct had that injury or death occurred to the unborn child's mother.
:2(B) An offense under this section does not require proof that–
::(i) the person engaging in the conduct had knowledge or should have had knowledge that the victim of the underlying offense was pregnant; or
::(ii) the defendant intended to cause the death of, or bodily injury to, the unborn child.
:2(C) If the person engaging in the conduct thereby intentionally kills or attempts to kill the unborn child, that person shall instead of being punished under subparagraph (A), be punished as provided under sections 1111, 1112, and 1113 of this title for intentionally killing or attempting to kill a human being."

=== In the United Kingdom ===
In the UK the transferred malice doctrine is not without controversy. The [[House of Lords]] in ''Attorney General's Reference  No  3  of  1994''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII
 | litigants = Attorney General's Reference No 3 of 1994

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reversed the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] decision (reported at (1996) 2 WLR 412), holding that the doctrine of transferred malice could not apply to convict an accused of [[murder in English law]] when the defendant had stabbed a pregnant woman in the face, back and abdomen. Some days after she was released from hospital in an apparently stable condition, she went into labour and gave birth to a premature child, who died four months later. The child had been wounded in the original attack but the more substantial cause of death was her prematurity. It was argued that the [[fetus]] was part of the mother so that any intention to cause [[grievous bodily harm]] (GBH) to the mother was also an intent aimed at the fetus. Lord Mustill criticised the doctrine as having no sound intellectual basis, saying that it was related to the original concept of malice, i.e. that a wrongful act displayed a malevolence which could be attached to any adverse consequence, and this had long been out of date. Nevertheless, it would sometimes provide a justification to convict when that was a common sense outcome and so could sensibly be retained. The present case was not a simple "transfer" from mother to uterine child, but sought to create an intention to cause injury to the child after birth. This would be a double transfer: first from the mother to the fetus, and then from the fetus to the child when it was born. Then one would have to apply the fiction which converts an intention to commit GBH into the ''mens rea'' of murder. That was too much. But the accused could be convicted of [[manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]].

In ''[[R v Gnango]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] controversially held that under the doctrines of joint enterprise and transferred malice D2 is guilty of V's murder if D1 and D2 voluntarily engage in fighting each other, each intending to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to the other and each foreseeing that the other has the reciprocal intention, and if D1 mistakenly kills V in the course of the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Regina v Armel Gnango|link=R v Gnango|court=UKSC|reporter=|scotcase=|year=2011|volume=|firstpage=|num=59|format=|parallelcite=|date=14 December 2011|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Umberto Meoli''' (26 August 1920 &amp;ndash; 17 May 2002)&lt;ref&gt;"Umberto Meoli; Obituary; The Register", in ''[[The Times]]'', May 31, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[historian]] of [[economics]], known as a maverick of the Italian Left who eschewed [[Marxism]] in favour of [[Pragmatism|British pragmatism]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Meoli was born in [[Padua]], one of nineteen brothers; his father was a [[pharmacist]] from a small town near [[Benevento]], and his mother was from Padua.

=== Education ===
In 1940, at age 20, Meoli began his service in the [[Italian Army]] fighting in [[World War II]], and, three years later, with the [[Italian resistance movement|Resistance]] after the [[Armistice with Italy|1943 armistice]] between Italy and the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] armed forces.  As a result, Meoli was imprisoned by the [[Benito Mussolini]] [[Fascism in Italy|Fascist]] government, and spent several months in the Palazzo Giusti detention center in Padua.&lt;ref&gt;"Umberto Meoli; Obituary; The Register", in ''The Times'', May 31, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The Palazzo Giusti detention center was notorious for the cruelty of some Fascists in Padua during the [[Italian Social Republic]].  For example, Giovanni Gonelli, a barely [[literate]] jail keeper at Palazzo Giusti in Padua and a member of the [[Banda Carità]], apparently enjoyed dehumanizing his prisoners by refusing their requests for food or blankets.  The sentence of the Appellate Court of 8 January 1946 states that Gonelli would tell prisoners who asked for water to "piss and drink."&lt;ref&gt;A. Robert Lauer, ''[http://clcwebjournal.lib.purdue.edu/clcweb02-1/lauer02.html ''CLCWeb Library of Research and Information. Comparative Literature and Culture: A WWWeb Journal]'', March 2002,  {{ISSN|1481-4374}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no doubt that Meoli experienced such cruelty while imprisoned in Palazzo Giusti, and that this cruelty affected his thoughts.

=== Marriage and children ===
In 1961 Meoli married Rachel Toulmin, an Englishwoman and lecturer at [[University of Padua|Padua University]]. Rachel Toulmin was the younger sister of [[Stephen Toulmin]], a historian and philosopher of science at the [[University of Southern California]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/CMTS/Toulmin.html |title={title} |access-date=2006-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104092955/http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/CMTS/Toulmin.html |archive-date=2006-11-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/ealc/NEHfaculty.html |title={title} |access-date=2006-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105225229/http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/ealc/NEHfaculty.html |archive-date=2006-11-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academia ===
Meoli was briefly a [[Communism|Communist]], and after graduating, he worked for a time in the [[trade union]]s (''[[Camera del Lavoro]]'') in [[Vicenza]], but he was soon at odds with the rigid militancy of organized labor.  He found his vocation in the late 1950s, when he obtained a teaching post at the [[University of Parma]].

It was during his time at ''Camera del Lavoro'' that Meoli became influenced by the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Harry Gordon Johnson]], one of the most active and prolific economists of all time.  Gordon's main research was in the area of [[international trade]], international finance, and monetary policy. In 1961, Meoli made a special journey to the [[University of Manchester]] in [[England]] to meet Johnson. He quickly became a close friend of both [[Philip Walter Sawford Andrews|Philip Andrews]], A former President of the Royal Economic Society,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2565791|title = Sir Henry Phelps Brown, 1906-1994|journal = The Economic Journal|volume = 108|issue = 448|pages = 757–778|last1 = Hancock|first1 = Keith|last2 = Isaac|first2 = J.

In 1961, Meoli published the first book in steady flow of books, in which would increasingly concentrate on the history of economic thought and ideas.

By 1970, Meoli became Professor of the History of Economic Thought at Camera del Lavoro, and shortly afterwards was invited to occupy a similar chair at the [[University of Venice]].

== Italian academic circles ==
In addition to his [[Chair (official)|chair]] positions, from 1992 to 1998 Umberto Meoli was president of the Italian Association for the History of Economic Thought (''L'Associazione Italiana per la Storia del Pensiero Economico'', AISPE).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aispe.org/Presidenti.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Meoli always thought of himself as a man of the [[Left-wing politics|Left]].  However, he early became convinced of the unacceptable limitations of [[Marxian economics|Marxist economic theory]], and his books and articles struck many of his leftist colleagues as a kind of [[apostasy]]. Meoli's writings exhibited an ever-growing respect for British pragmatism, and the [[economic liberalism]] of [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]], and [[Alfred Marshall]]. As an example of his unconventional approach, the figure of [[Gustav von Schmoller]] has been highlighted by authors like [[Francesco Traniello]],&lt;ref&gt;http://hal9000.cisi.unito.it/wf/DIPARTIMEN/Storia1/Ricerca/Bollettino/censimento-ricerca-traniello.doc_cvt.htm&lt;/ref&gt; who has indicated the importance that Schmoller, like [[Gustav von Schönberg]], [[Adolph Wagner]] and [[Albert Schäffle]], among others, gave the ethical element of the political Economy, whereas Umberto Meoli associates the figure of Schmoller to those of [[Lujo Brentano]] and [[Karl Bücher]] as the most representative authors of the development of the Economic [[Historiography]].&lt;ref&gt;Gomez Rojo, María E. Denis, Henri, [https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php%3Fscript%3Dsci_arttext%26pid%3DS0716-54552000002200036%26lng%3Den%26nrm%3Diso&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=20&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DUmberto%2BMeoli%26num%3D100%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26safe%3Doff%26rls%3DGGLG,GGLG:2006-20,GGLG:en '' Histoire de la pensée économique ''], [[Presses Universitaires de France]], Paris, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually seen in Italian academic circles as a maverick and a great [[Anglophile]], Meoli's leftist friends tolerated the irony, largely because Meoli would comment on their dismay with sudden eruptions of laughter.&lt;ref&gt;"Umberto Meoli; Obituary; The Register", in ''The Times'', May 31, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in Dublin, 8 January 1825, he was nephew of [[Sir Maziere Brady, 1st Baronet]], [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]], and youngest son of Sir Nicholas W. Brady who, whilst Lord Mayor of Dublin, was knighted by George IV during his visit to that city. William Maziere Brady entered [[Trinity College, Dublin]], in 1842, received the degree of B.A. in 1848, B. D. in 1858, and D. D. in 1863. In 1848 he was appointed Anglican curate of Maynooth and in 1849, curate of Kilkeedy, Limerick. In 1851 he became curate of St. Dolough's, Dublin, and in the same year Rector of Farrahy, County Cork. In this year, also, he married a lineal descendant, on the maternal side, of [[Jeremy Taylor]]. Brady acted as chaplain to several successive viceroys, and in 1861 became Vicar of [[Clonfert]], County Cork.

When the Church Disestablishment act was passed, Brady went to Rome, where he examined the Vatican archives for information touching the ecclesiastical affairs of England, Ireland, and Scotland. He shortly resigned his benefices as Vicar of Donoughpatrick, and Rector of Kilbery, Meath, to which he had been promoted from Cork, and in May, 1873, was received into the Catholic Church by Monsignor Kirby, Rector of the [[Irish College at Rome]].  During his stay in Rome, he acted as correspondent of the London ''Tablet'', and issued a pamphlet on ''The Pope's Anti-Parnellite Circular'' (London, 1883). He had a share in the political controversies of the day and corresponded with [[William Ewart Gladstone]] and other statesmen. He died of apoplexy in Rome, 19 March 1894, and was buried in the [[Campo Verano]].

==Works==
While at Clonfert he published in three volumes the "Clerical and Parochial Records of Cork, Cloyne and Ross" (Dublin, 1863), which he compiled from diocesan and parish registries and manuscripts in the principal libraries and public offices of Oxford, Dublin, and London, and from private and family papers. These "Records" are mainly those of the Protestant [[Diocese of Cork, Cloyne and Ross]].

Brady published several works in favour of the disestablishment of the Irish Protestant Church, such as: "Remarks on the Irish Church Temporalities" (1865); "Facts or Fiction; The alleged Conversion of the Irish Bishops to the Reformed Religion at the Accession of Queen Elizabeth and the Assumed Descent of the Present Established Hierarchy from the Ancient Irish Church Disproved" (1866), which went through five editions; "State Papers concerning the Irish Church in the time of Queen Elizabeth" (1868); "Some Remarks on the Irish Church Bill" (1869); and "Essays on the English State Church in Ireland" (1869). On the Irish Church question he also contributed numerous letters to the newspaper press, and articles to "Fraser's" and "The Contemporary", many of which were subsequently reprinted in pamphlet or book form. Some interesting articles from his pen appeared in the "Catholic World" on "Ireland's Mission" (May, 1870); "The Ancient Irish Churches" (July, 1870), written while yet a Protestant, and "Pius IX and Mr. Gladstone's Misrepresentations" (May, 1875).

His Vatican researches led to the publication of two volumes on "Episcopal Succession in England, Scotland, and Ireland, A.D. 1400 to 1875, with Appointments to Monasteries, and Extracts from Manuscripts in Public and Private Libraries in Rome, Florence, Bologna, Vienna, and Paris" (Rome, 1876–77). He also brought out, "Annals of the Catholic Hierarchy in England and Scotland, A.D. 1585-1876, with a Dissertation on Anglican Orders" (Rome, 1877; London, 1883). The last of his works was the "Anglo-Roman Papers", published in 1890.

His only work of a purely secular character is "The McGillicuddy Papers; a Selection from the Family Archives of the McGillicuddy of the Reeks, with an Introductory Memoir" (1867).
