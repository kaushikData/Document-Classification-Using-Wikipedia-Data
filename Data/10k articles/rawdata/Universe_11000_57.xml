The '''1990 Clinic of Zaragoza radiotherapy accident''' was a [[radiological]] accident that occurred from December 10–20, 1990, at the Clinic of [[Zaragoza]], in [[Spain]].

In the accident, at least 27 patients were [[radiation injury|injured]], and 11 of them died, according to [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull413/article1.pdf|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5hO7gbe9a?url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull413/article1.pdf|archivedate= June 8, 2009|title= IAEA Bulletin 413}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the injured were [[cancer]] patients receiving [[radiotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= El accidente del Clínico de Zaragoza, una cadena de fallos humanos única en el mundo, según los expertos|language= Spanish|newspaper= [[El País]]|date= October 12, 1991|url= http://elpais.com/diario/1991/10/12/sociedad/687222014_850215.html| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121010170257/http://elpais.com/diario/1991/10/12/sociedad/687222014_850215.html | archivedate = October 10, 2012| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 7, 1990, a technician performed maintenance on an [[electron accelerator]] at the Clinic of Zaragoza. On December 10, it returned to service after the repairs. On December 19,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= El CSN no controló el aparato radiactivo del Clínico de Zaragoza en un año y medio|first1= Josep|last1= Garriga|first2= Javier|last2= Ortega|language= Spanish|trans-title=|newspaper= [[El País]]|date= February 23, 1991|url= http://elpais.com/diario/1991/02/23/sociedad/667263601_850215.html| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121010170314/http://elpais.com/diario/1991/02/23/sociedad/667263601_850215.html | archivedate = October 10, 2012| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Spanish Nuclear Safety Board]] was scheduled to make its annual review to the device, but due to bureaucratic reasons this review was delayed. The Spanish Nuclear Safety Board found the electron accelerator power was too high. On December 20, 1990, the unit was stopped, and was restarted on March 8, 1991.

==Chronology==
Affected patients immediately suffered [[beta burn|burns]] on the skin of the irradiated area, as well as [[inflammation]] of the internal organs and [[bone marrow]]. The first patient died on February 16, 1991, two months after irradiation. Fatalities increased until, on December 25, 1991, the last of a total of 25 patients died.  However, the [[IAEA]] established that eleven of the deaths were due to the faulty maintenance.

The number affected might have been higher, because 31 other cancer patients were receiving treatment with the accelerator, but the other unit at the clinic was in perfect working condition.

==The accident==
The radiotherapy unit was repaired without following the correct instructions. The unit, in service 14 years at the time of the failure, had a breakdown in the electron beam accelerator control system ('[[deviator]]'). Repairs incorrectly increased output power, so patients that should have received therapy at 7 [[Electronvolt|MeV]] were instead treated at 40 MeV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Un técnico revisó el acelerador del Clínico de Zaragoza tres días antes del accidente|language= Spanish|trans-title=|first= Sebastian|last= Serrano|newspaper= [[El País]]|date= February 26, 1991|url= http://elpais.com/diario/1991/02/26/sociedad/667522801_850215.html| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121010170327/http://elpais.com/diario/1991/02/26/sociedad/667522801_850215.html | archivedate = October 10, 2012| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
Initially, the hospital was thought responsible for the accident, and specifically, the management of the radiological unit. The manager of the hospital said that the maintenance technician was responsible, and the [[Health Minister]] blamed [[General Electric]] (GE), the makers of the radiological unit, who had contracted out the maintenance.

Finally, on April 6, 1993, the hospital, its staff, and the [[Spanish National Institute of Health]] were acquitted. The [[court]] found the technician who performed the repair guilty, and secondarily, found General Electric guilty.  GE had to compensate the affected families with 400 million pesetas (around 2.4 million euros).

==Out of service==
The device continued working until December 1996, when it was switched off and scrapped. This was done discreetly to avoid publicity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8311">'''Adverse yaw''' is the natural and undesirable tendency for an [[aircraft]] to [[Aircraft principal axes#Vertical axis .28yaw.29|yaw]] in the opposite direction of a [[Aircraft principal axes#Longitudinal axis .28roll.29|roll]]. It is caused by the difference in lift and drag of each wing. The effect can be greatly minimized with ailerons deliberately designed to create drag when deflected upward and/or mechanisms which automatically apply some amount of coordinated [[rudder]].  As the major causes of adverse yaw vary with lift, any fixed-ratio mechanism will fail to fully solve the problem across all flight conditions and thus any manually operated aircraft will require some amount of [[rudder]] input from the pilot in order to maintain [[coordinated flight]].

==History==
Adverse yaw was first experienced in 1901 and later described by Orville Wright, following their unability to control a turn with their glider lacking directionnal control&lt;ref&gt; "How we invented the airplane", Orville Wright, page 16&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Causes ==
Adverse yaw is a secondary effect of the inclination of the [[Lift (force)|lift]] vectors on the wing due to its rolling velocity and of the application of the ailerons.&lt;ref name=perkins-hage&gt;Perkins, Courtland; Hage, Robert (1949). ''Airplane performance, stability and control''. John Wiley and Sons. {{ISBN|0-471-68046-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|327}} Some pilot training manuals focus mainly on the additional drag caused by the downward-deflected aileron&lt;ref name=langewiesche&gt;Langewiesche, Wolfgang (1944). ''Stick and Rudder''. McGraw-Hill. pp. 163–165. {{ISBN|0-07-036240-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=faa-phoan&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/library/manuals/aviation/pilot_handbook/media/PHAK%20-%20Chapter%2005.pdf ''Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge Ch. 5''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101185310/http://www.faa.gov/library/manuals/aviation/pilot_handbook/media/PHAK%20-%20Chapter%2005.pdf |date=November 1, 2012 }}, Federal Aviation Administration, 2008, p. 5-3, retrieved 2012-12-12&lt;/ref&gt; 
and make only brief{{#tag:ref
|'An expert will object here and point out that the ailerons cannot be held wholly responsible for the adverse yaw effect; that some of this adverse yawing tendency is due simply to the rolling motion of the wings and would persist no matter what device might cause the wings to roll. But the explanation just given answers the purposes of the pilot. Even though it does not tell the whole truth, it tells truth, and it has the advantage that it can be "shown."'&lt;ref name=langewiesche/&gt;
}} or indirect{{#tag:ref
|'The adverse yaw is a result of differential drag and the slight difference in the velocity of the left and right wings.'&lt;ref name=faa-phoan/&gt;
}} mentions of roll effects. In fact the rolling of the wings usually causes a greater effect than the ailerons.{{#tag:ref
|'for normal wing plan forms with aspect ratios above about 6, adverse yaw is actually dominated by the aerodynamic yawing moment due to rolling'&lt;ref name=azbug/&gt;
}} Assuming a roll rate to the right, as in the diagram, the causes are explained as follows:

[[Image:Adverse yaw.png|right]]

===Lift vectors===
By definition, lift is perpendicular to the oncoming flow.&lt;ref name="perkins-hage" /&gt;{{rp|18}} As the left wing moves up, its effective [[angle of attack]] is decreased,&lt;ref name="perkins-hage" /&gt;{{rp|361}} so its lift vector tilts back. Conversely, as the right wing descends, its lift vector tilts forward. The result is an adverse yaw moment to the left, opposite to the intended right turn.

===Induced drag===
Initiating a roll to the right requires a briefly greater lift on the left than the right. This also causes a greater [[induced drag]] on the left than the right, which further adds to the adverse yaw, but only briefly.  Once a steady roll rate is established the left/right lift imbalance dwindles,&lt;ref name="perkins-hage" /&gt;{{rp|351}} while the other mechanisms described above persist.

===Profile drag===
The downward aileron deflection on the left increases the [[airfoil]] camber, which will typically increase the [[profile drag]]. Conversely, the upward aileron deflection on the right will decrease the camber and profile drag. The profile drag imbalance adds to the adverse yaw. A Frise aileron reduces this imbalance drag, as described further below.


== Minimizing the adverse yaw ==
There are a number of aircraft design characteristics which can be used to reduce adverse yaw to ease the pilot workload:

=== Yaw stability===
A strong directional stability is the first way to reduce adverse yaw.&lt;ref name=azbug&gt;Airplane Stability and Control, Abzug and  Larrabee, page 64. "Adverse yaw must be overcome by good directional stability complemented by rudder deflection".&lt;/ref&gt; This is influenced by the vertical tail moment (area and lever arm about gravity center).

===Lift coefficient===
As the tilting of the left/right lift vectors is the major cause to adverse yaw, an important parameter is the magnitude of these lift vectors, or the aircraft's [[lift coefficient]] to be more specific. Flight at low lift coefficient (or high speed compared to minimum speed) produces less adverse yaw.&lt;ref name=perkins-hage/&gt;{{rp|365}}
===Aileron to rudder mixing===
As intended, the rudder is the most powerful and efficient means of managing yaw but mechanically coupling it to the ailerons is impractical.  Electronic coupling is commonplace in fly-by-wire aircraft.

=== Differential aileron deflection ===
[[Image:DifferentialAileron.svg|right|thumb|300px|Illustration of a Differential aileron]]

The geometry of most aileron linkages can be configured so as to bias the travel further upward than downward.  By excessively deflecting the upward aileron, profile drag is increased rather than reduced and [[Flow separation|separation drag]] further aids in producing drag on the inside wing, producing a yaw force in the direction of the turn.  Though not as efficient as rudder mixing, aileron differential is very easy to implement on almost any airplane and offers the significant advantage of reducing the tendency for the wing to [[Stall (flight)|stall]] at the tip first by limiting the downward aileron deflection and its associated effective increase in angle of attack.

Most airplanes use this method of adverse yaw mitigation — particularly noticeable on one of the first well-known aircraft to ever use them, the [[de Havilland Tiger Moth]] training biplane of the 1930s — due to the simple implementation and safety benefits.

=== Frise ailerons ===
[[Image:FriseAileron.svg|right|thumb|300px|Illustration of a Frise aileron]]

Frise ailerons are designed so that when up aileron is applied, some of the forward edge of the aileron will protrude downward into the airflow, causing increased drag on this (down-going) wing. This will counter the drag produced by the other aileron, thus reducing adverse yaw.

Unfortunately, as well as reducing adverse yaw, Frise ailerons will increase the overall drag of the aircraft much more than applying rudder correction.  Therefore, they are less popular in aircraft where minimizing drag is important (e.g. in a [[Glider (sailplane)|glider]]).

Note: Frise ailerons were  primarily designed to reduce roll control forces. Contrary to the illustration, the aileron leading edge is in fact rounded to prevent flow separation and [[aeroelasticity|flutter]] at negative deflections.&lt;ref&gt;Wind-tunnel tests of ailerons at various speeds, W. Letko and W.B. Kemp, NACA WR-L 325&lt;/ref&gt; That prevents important differential drag forces.

{{clear}}

=== Roll spoilers ===
On large aircraft where rudder use is inappropriate at high speeds or ailerons are too small at low speeds, roll spoilers (also called [[spoileron]]s) can be used to minimise adverse yaw or increase roll moment.  To function as a lateral control, the spoiler is raised on the down-going wing (up aileron) and remains retracted on the other wing.  The raised spoiler increases the drag, and so the yaw is in the same direction as the roll.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Aviation Academy (2007), JAA ATPL 13: Principles of Flight, Transair&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ecology]], '''allogenic succession''' is [[Ecological succession|succession]] driven by the [[abiotic component]]s of an [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref name="ORO" /&gt; In contrast, [[autogenic succession]] is driven by the [[biotic component]]s of the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="ORO" /&gt; An allogenic succession can be brought about in a number of ways which can include:
*[[Volcanic eruptions]]
*Meteor or comet strike
*Flooding
*Drought
*Earthquakes
*Non-anthropogenic [[climate change]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9i.html 9(i) Plant Succession&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Allogenic succession can happen on a time scale that is proportionate with the disturbance. For example, allogenic succession that is the result of climate change can happen over thousands of years. &lt;ref name="biotic_community_4698"/&gt;

'''Backfeeding''' is flow of electrical energy in the reverse direction from its normal flow. For example, backfeeding may occur when [[electrical power]] is injected into the local power grid from a source other than a utility company generator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.electricianslibrary.com/what-is-backfeeding/|title=What is Backfeeding? – Electricians Library|website=www.electricianslibrary.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Description==
By definition, backfeeding causes [[electrical power]] to flow in the opposite direction from its usual flow. When studying backfeeding, engineers must understand the ''transfer of electrical power'', and not confuse this with momentary AC voltages or current flows viewed in isolation from the overall situation.
&lt;!-- Following is technically misleading and confusing, because normal AC voltage always alternates positive and negative. What matters is the flow of *power*, not the momentary flow of current.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- An alternating current (AC) [[power station]] typically delivers power to the [[power grid]] by inducing a [[current (electricity)|current]] to flow into the power grid when the voltage is positive, and inducing it to flow out of the power grid when the voltage is negative, and a typical power grid load (e.g. factory or home) induces current to flow out of the power grid when the voltage is positive and into the power grid when the voltage is negative.  If either of these types of facilities starts inducing current like the other, then backfeeding is occurring. --&gt;

Power grid ''generators'' normally pump energy into the grid, making it available for others to use. A power station will typically backfeed (and thus ''consume'' power) when it is shut down, due to its own local loads (e.g. lights or repair equipment).  

Power grid ''loads'' may backfeed if they also have [[distributed generation]] installed, such as a grid-connected [[photovoltaic]] [[solar power]] system or a [[microturbine]]-based power generator.  It is also possible for an electric motor to temporarily backfeed if it is mechanically driven (see [[regenerative braking]]).

==Design considerations==
For cost reasons, many of the circuit (overcurrent) protection and power quality control (voltage regulation) devices used by electric utility companies are designed with the assumption that power always flows in one direction. An interconnection agreement can be arranged for equipment designed to backfeed between an electric utility customer with distributed generation and their power company.  This type of interconnection can involve nontrivial engineering, and possibly equipment upgrade costs to keep the distribution circuit properly protected.  Such costs may be minimized by limiting distributed generation capacity to less than is locally consumed, and guaranteeing this condition by installing a reverse-power cutoff relay that opens if backfeeding occurs.

==Hazards==
Because it involves transfer of significant amounts of energy, backfeeding must be carefully controlled and monitored. Personnel working on equipment subject to backfeeding must be aware of all possible power sources, and follow systematic protocols to ensure that equipment is fully de-energized before commencing work, or use special equipment and techniques suitable for working on live equipment.

&lt;!--  Following personal observations might have useful ideas, but needs complete rewrite
There are also hazards created by backfeeding. When the grid goes down, like in a storm, and you are STILL generating into the grid, now you have created a dangerous situation. Because when the grid goes down and the linemen need to work on it, they disconnect the SOURCE of the voltage potential from the nearest substation. But of you are still pumping potential INTO the grid when they think it is going to be dead, you can kill them. Or if not that and they detect live voltage potential on the line after they have opened the substation connection, how are they going to know where the voltage is coming from? They can find it, EVENTUALLY, but it takes time to trace it back and isolate it. In the mean time thousands of people are screaming at them to get their power back.

{{infobox beryllium}}
'''Beryllium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Be''' and [[atomic number]] 4. It is a [[Abundance of the chemical elements#Universe|relatively rare]] element in the [[universe]], usually occurring as a product of the [[spallation]] of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with [[cosmic ray]]s. Within the cores of stars beryllium is depleted as it is fused and creates larger elements. It is a [[divalent]] element which occurs naturally only in combination with other elements in minerals. Notable [[gemstones]] which contain beryllium include [[beryl]] ([[Aquamarine (gemstone)|aquamarine]], [[emerald]]) and [[chrysoberyl]]. As a free [[Chemical element|element]] it is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle [[alkaline earth metal]].

Beryllium improves many physical properties when added as an [[alloy]]ing element to [[aluminium]], [[copper]] (notably the alloy [[beryllium copper]]), [[iron]] and [[nickel]].&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt; Beryllium does not form oxides until it reaches very high temperatures. Tools made of [[beryllium copper]] [[alloy]]s are strong and hard and do not create sparks when they strike a steel surface. In structural applications, the combination of high [[flexural rigidity]], [[thermal stability]], [[thermal conductivity]] and low [[density]] (1.85 times that of water) make beryllium metal a desirable [[aerospace]] material for aircraft components, [[missile]]s, [[spacecraft]], and [[satellites]].&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt; Because of its low density and [[atomic mass]], beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays and other forms of [[ionizing radiation]]; therefore, it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment and components of [[particle detector]]s.&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt; The high thermal conductivities of beryllium and [[beryllium oxide]] have led to their use in thermal management applications.

The commercial use of beryllium requires the use of appropriate dust control equipment and industrial controls at all times because of the [[toxicity]] of inhaled beryllium-containing dusts that can cause a chronic life-threatening allergic disease in some people called [[berylliosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nchem.1033|title=A brighter beryllium|date=2011|last1=Puchta|first1=Ralph|journal=Nature Chemistry|volume=3|issue=5|pages=416|pmid=21505503|bibcode=2011NatCh...3..416P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
Beryllium is a steel gray and hard [[metal]] that is brittle at room temperature and has a close-packed hexagonal [[crystal structure]].&lt;ref name=deGruyter&gt;{{cite book
 | others=trans. rev. Eagleson, Mary

 | location=Berlin
 | date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has exceptional [[stiffness]] ([[Young's modulus]] 287 GPa) and a reasonably high [[melting point]]. The [[modulus of elasticity]] of beryllium is approximately 50% greater than that of steel. The combination of this modulus and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast [[speed of sound|sound conduction speed]] in beryllium – about 12.9&amp;nbsp;km/s at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|ambient conditions]]. Other significant properties are high specific heat (1925 J·kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and thermal conductivity (216 W·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), which make beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight. In combination with the relatively low coefficient of linear [[thermal expansion]] (11.4×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading.&lt;ref name=Be&gt;{{Cite book| title=Landolt-Börnstein&amp;nbsp;– Group VIII Advanced Materials and Technologies: Powder Metallurgy Data.

===Nuclear properties===
Naturally occurring beryllium, save for slight contamination by the cosmogenic radioisotopes, is isotopically pure beryllium-9, which has a [[spin (physics)|nuclear spin]] of {{sfrac|3|2}}. Beryllium has a large scattering cross section for high-energy neutrons, about 6 [[barn (unit)|barns]] for energies above approximately 10&amp;nbsp;keV. Therefore, it works as a neutron reflector and [[neutron moderator]], effectively slowing the neutrons to the [[neutron temperature|thermal energy]] range of below 0.03&amp;nbsp;eV, where the total cross section is at least an order of magnitude lower – exact value strongly depends on the purity and size of the crystallites in the material.

The single primordial beryllium isotope &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Be also undergoes a (n,2n) neutron reaction with neutron energies over about 1.9&amp;nbsp;MeV, to produce &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Be, which almost immediately breaks into two alpha particles. Thus, for high-energy neutrons, beryllium is a neutron multiplier, releasing more neutrons than it absorbs. This nuclear reaction is:&lt;ref name ="BeMelurgy"/&gt;
:{{nuclide|Beryllium|9}} + n → 2 {{nuclide|Helium|4}} + 2 n

Neutrons are liberated when beryllium [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] are struck by energetic [[alpha particle]]s&lt;ref name=Be/&gt; producing the nuclear reaction
:{{nuclide|Beryllium|9}} + {{nuclide|Helium|4}} → {{nuclide|Carbon|12}} + n, where {{nuclide|Helium|4}} is an alpha particle and {{nuclide|Carbon|12}} is a [[carbon-12]] nucleus.&lt;ref name ="BeMelurgy"&gt;{{Cite book| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=FCnUN45cL1cC&amp;pg=PA239|page=239|chapter=Nuclear Properties|title=Beryllium its Metallurgy and Properties|publisher=University of California Press|first=Henry H.|last=Hausner| date=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Beryllium also releases neutrons under bombardment by gamma rays. Thus, natural beryllium bombarded either by alphas or gammas from a suitable radioisotope is a key component of most radioisotope-powered [[nuclear reaction]] [[neutron source]]s for the laboratory production of free neutrons.

Small amounts of [[tritium]] are liberated when {{nuclide|Beryllium|9}} nuclei absorb low energy neutrons in the three-step nuclear reaction
:{{nuclide|Beryllium|9}} + n → {{nuclide|Helium|4}} + {{nuclide|Helium|6}},&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {{nuclide|Helium|6}} → {{nuclide|Lithium|6}} + β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {{nuclide|Lithium|6}} + n → {{nuclide|Helium|4}} + {{nuclide|Hydrogen|3}} 
Note that {{nuclide|Helium|6}} has a half-life of only 0.8 seconds, β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is an electron, and {{nuclide|Lithium|6}} has a high neutron absorption cross-section.  Tritium is a radioisotope of concern in nuclear reactor waste streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tomberlin|first1=T.

As a metal, beryllium is [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] to most wavelengths of [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s, making it useful for the output windows of [[X-ray tube]]s and other such apparatus.

===Isotopes and nucleosynthesis===
{{Main|Isotopes of beryllium}}
Both stable and unstable isotopes of beryllium are created in stars, but the radioisotopes do not last long. It is believed that most of the stable beryllium in the universe was originally created in the interstellar medium when [[cosmic rays]] induced fission in heavier elements found in interstellar gas and dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ILQ7sTrRixMC&amp;pg=PA172|title=Physics: 1981–1990|author=Ekspong, G. |publisher=World Scientific|date=1992|pages=172 ff|isbn=978-981-02-0729-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primordial beryllium contains only one stable isotope, &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Be, and therefore beryllium is a [[monoisotopic element]].

[[File:Solar Activity Proxies.png|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Plot showing variations in solar activity, including variation in sunspot number (red) and &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be concentration (blue). Note that the beryllium scale is inverted, so increases on this scale indicate lower &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be levels]]
Radioactive [[cosmogenic]] &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be is produced in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere of the Earth]] by the [[cosmic ray spallation]] of [[oxygen]]&lt;!-- NEEDS CITE and [[nitrogen]]--&gt;.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=56}} &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be accumulates at the [[soil]] surface, where its relatively long [[half-life]] (1.36 million years) permits a long [[residence time (fluid dynamics)|residence time]] before decaying to [[boron]]-10. Thus, &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural [[soil erosion]], [[soil formation]] and the development of [[laterite|lateritic soils]], and as a [[Proxy (climate)|proxy]] for measurement of the variations in [[solar variation|solar activity]] and the age of [[ice core]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.sahra.arizona.edu/programs/isotopes/beryllium.html|title=Beryllium: Isotopes and Hydrology|publisher=University of Arizona, Tucson |accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be is inversely proportional to solar activity, because increased [[solar wind]] during periods of high solar activity decreases the flux of [[galactic cosmic ray]]s that reach the Earth.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=56}} Nuclear explosions also form &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of the indicators of past activity at [[nuclear weapon test]] sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2007.07.016|date=Feb 2008|author=Whitehead, N|author2=Endo, S|author3=Tanaka, K|author4=Takatsuji, T|author5=Hoshi, M|author6=Fukutani, S|author7=Ditchburn, Rg|author8=Zondervan, A|title=A preliminary study on the use of (10)Be in forensic radioecology of nuclear explosion sites|volume=99|issue=2|pages=260–70 |pmid=17904707|journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The isotope &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Be (half-life 53 days) is also cosmogenic, and shows an atmospheric abundance linked to sunspots, much like &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be.

&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Be has a very short half-life of about 7{{e|-17}}&amp;nbsp;s that contributes to its significant cosmological role, as elements heavier than beryllium could not have been produced by nuclear fusion in the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boyd |first1=R. N. |last2=Kajino |first2= T. |date=1989 |title=Can Be-9 provide a test of cosmological theories? |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=336|bibcode=1989ApJ...336L..55B |pages=L55 |doi=10.1086/185360}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the lack of sufficient time during the Big Bang's [[nucleosynthesis]] phase to produce carbon by the fusion of &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He nuclei and the very low concentrations of available [[beryllium-8]]. The British [[astronomer]] Sir [[Fred Hoyle]] first showed that the energy levels of &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Be and &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C allow carbon production by the so-called [[triple-alpha process]] in helium-fueled stars where more nucleosynthesis time is available. This process allows carbon to be produced in stars, but not in the Big Bang. Star-created carbon (the basis of [[carbon-based life]]) is thus a component in the elements in the gas and dust ejected by [[AGB star]]s and [[supernova]]e (see also [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]), as well as the creation of all other elements with [[atomic number]]s larger than that of carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PXGWGnPPo0gC&amp;pg=PA223|page=223|title=Supernovae and nucleosynthesis|author=Arnett, David |publisher=Princeton University Press|date=1996|isbn=978-0-691-01147-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2s electrons of beryllium may contribute to chemical bonding. Therefore, when &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Be decays by L-[[electron capture]], it does so by taking electrons from its [[atomic orbital]]s that may be participating in bonding. This makes its decay rate dependent to a measurable degree upon its chemical surroundings&amp;nbsp;– a rare occurrence in nuclear decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/decay_rates.html|title=How to Change Nuclear Decay Rates|first=Bill|last=Johnson|publisher=University of California, Riverside|accessdate =30 March 2008 |date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shortest-lived known isotope of beryllium is &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;Be which decays through [[neutron emission]]. It has a half-life of 2.7&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−21&lt;/sup&gt; s. &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Be is also very short-lived with a half-life of 5.0&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−21&lt;/sup&gt; s.&lt;ref name=crc&gt;Hammond, C.

==Production==
The extraction of beryllium from its compounds is a difficult process due to its high affinity for oxygen at elevated temperatures, and its ability to reduce water when its oxide film is removed. The United States, China and Kazakhstan are the only three countries involved in the industrial-scale extraction of beryllium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://beryllium.com/About-Beryllium/Sources%20of%20Beryllium.aspx |title=Sources of Beryllium |publisher=Materion Corporation |accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beryllium production technology is in early stages of development in Russia after a 20-year hiatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurasianbusinessbriefing.com/russia-restarts-beryllium-production-after-20-years/ |title=Russia restarts beryllium production after 20 years |date=20 February 2015 |publisher=Eurasian Business Briefing |access-date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beryllium is most commonly extracted from the mineral [[beryl]], which is either [[sintering|sintered]] using an extraction agent or melted into a soluble mixture. The sintering process involves mixing beryl with [[sodium fluorosilicate]] and soda at {{convert|770|C|F}} to form [[Tetrafluoroberyllate|sodium fluoroberyllate]], [[aluminium oxide]] and [[silicon dioxide]].&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt; [[Beryllium hydroxide]] is precipitated from a solution of sodium fluoroberyllate and [[sodium hydroxide]] in water. Extraction of beryllium using the melt method involves grinding beryl into a powder and heating it to {{convert|1650|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt; The melt is quickly cooled with water and then reheated {{convert|250|to|300|C|F}} in concentrated [[sulfuric acid]], mostly yielding [[beryllium sulfate]] and [[aluminium sulfate]].&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt; Aqueous [[ammonia]] is then used to remove the aluminium and sulfur, leaving beryllium hydroxide.

Beryllium hydroxide created using either the sinter or melt method is then converted into [[beryllium fluoride]] or [[beryllium chloride]]. To form the fluoride, aqueous ammonium hydrogen fluoride is added to beryllium hydroxide to yield a precipitate of ammonium tetrafluoroberyllate, which is heated to {{convert|1000|C|F}} to form beryllium fluoride.&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt; Heating the fluoride to {{convert|900|C|F}} with [[magnesium]] forms finely divided beryllium, and additional heating to {{convert|1300|C|F}} creates the compact metal.&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt; Heating beryllium hydroxide forms the oxide, which becomes beryllium chloride when combined with carbon and chlorine. [[Electrolysis]] of molten beryllium chloride is then used to obtain the metal.&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt;

Beryllium's chemical behavior is largely a result of its small [[atomic radius|atomic]] and [[ionic radius|ionic]] radii. It thus has very high [[ionization potential]]s and strong polarization while bonded to other atoms, which is why all of its compounds are [[Covalent bond|covalent]].&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt; It is more chemically similar to aluminium than its close neighbors in the periodic table due to having a similar charge-to-radius ratio.&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt;
An oxide layer forms around beryllium that prevents further reactions with air unless heated above 1000&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenwood"&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once ignited, beryllium burns brilliantly forming a mixture of [[beryllium oxide]] and [[beryllium nitride]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood"/&gt; Beryllium dissolves readily in non-[[oxidizing acid]]s, such as HCl and diluted H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, but not in [[nitric acid]] or water as this forms the oxide.&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt; This behavior is similar to that of aluminium metal. Beryllium also dissolves in alkali solutions.&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt;

The beryllium atom has the electronic configuration [He] 2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The two valence electrons give beryllium a +2 [[oxidation state]] and thus the ability to form two [[covalent bond]]s; the only evidence of lower valence of beryllium is in the solubility of the metal in [[beryllium dichloride|BeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]],&lt;ref name="Wiberg&amp;Holleman"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Wiberg, Egon|author2=Holleman, Arnold Frederick|date=2001|title=Inorganic Chemistry|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-12-352651-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in two neutral beryllium bis(carbene) compounds in which the Be center bears a formal oxidation state of zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arrowsmith|first=Merle|last2=Braunschweig|first2=Holger|last3=Celik|first3=Mehmet Ali|last4=Dellermann|first4=Theresa|last5=Dewhurst|first5=Rian D.|last6=Ewing|first6=William C.|last7=Hammond|first7=Kai|last8=Kramer|first8=Thomas|last9=Krummenacher|first9=Ivo|title=Neutral zero-valent s-block complexes with strong multiple bonding|journal=Nature Chemistry|language=en|volume=8|issue=9|pages=890–894|doi=10.1038/nchem.2542|pmid=27334631|bibcode=2016NatCh...8..890A|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the [[octet rule]], atoms tend to seek a valence of 8 in order to resemble a [[noble gas]]. Beryllium tries to achieve a [[coordination number]] of 4 because its two covalent bonds fill half of this octet.&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt; Tetracoordination allows beryllium compounds, such as the fluoride or chloride, to form polymers.

This characteristic is employed in analytical techniques using [[EDTA]] as a ligand. EDTA preferentially forms [[Octahedral molecular geometry|octahedral complexes]]&amp;nbsp;– thus absorbing other cations such as Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; which might interfere – for example, in the [[Liquid-liquid extraction|solvent extraction]] of a complex formed between Be&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and [[acetylacetone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Determination of a trace amount of beryllium in water samples by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry after preconcentration and separation as a beryllium-acetylacetonate complex on activated carbon|author=Okutani, T.|author2=Tsuruta, Y.|author3=Sakuragawa, A. |journal=Anal.

There have been extensive studies of these complexes which show the stability of the O-Be bond.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Solutions of beryllium salts, e.g. [[beryllium sulfate]] and [[beryllium nitrate]], are acidic because of hydrolysis of the [Be(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion.
:[Be(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} [Be(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
Other products of hydrolysis include the [[trimer (chemistry)|trimeric]] ion [Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Beryllium hydroxide]], Be(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is insoluble even in acidic solutions with pH less than 6, that is at biological pH. It is [[Amphoterism|amphoteric]] and dissolves in strongly [[Alkalinity|alkaline]] solutions.

Beryllium forms [[binary compound]]s with many non-metals. [[Anhydrous]] [[halide]]s are known for [[fluorine|F]], [[chlorine|Cl]], [[bromine|Br]] and [[iodine|I]]. [[beryllium fluoride|BeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] has a [[silica]]-like structure with corner-shared BeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra. [[beryllium chloride|BeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[beryllium bromide|BeBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] have chain structures with edge-shared tetrahedra. All beryllium halides have a linear monomeric molecular structure in the gas phase.&lt;ref name="Greenwood"/&gt;

[[Beryllium difluoride]], BeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is different than the other [[difluoride]]s.  In general, beryllium has a tendency to bond covalently, much more so than the other [[alkaline earth metal|alkaline earths]] and its fluoride is partially covalent (although still more ionic than its other halides).  BeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has many similarities to [[Silicon dioxide|SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] ([[quartz]]) a mostly covalently bonded [[network solid]].  BeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has tetrahedrally coordinated metal and forms glasses (is difficult to crystallize).  When crystalline, beryllium fluoride has the same room temperature crystal structure as quartz and shares many higher temperature structures also.  Beryllium difluoride is very soluble in water,&lt;ref name="dissolve"&gt;{{cite book|pages=278–80|title=First Outlines of a Dictionary of Solubilities of Chemical Substances| author= Storer, Frank Humphreys| publisher= Cambridge| date=1864| isbn=978-1-176-62256-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; unlike the other alkaline earth difluorides. (Although they are strongly ionic, they do not dissolve because of the especially strong [[Madelung constant|lattice energy]] of the fluorite structure.)

[[Beryllium oxide]], BeO, is a white [[refractory]] solid, which has the [[zinc sulfide|wurtzite]] crystal structure and a thermal conductivity as high as in some metals. BeO is [[amphoteric]]. Salts of beryllium can be produced by treating Be(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with acid.&lt;ref name="Greenwood"/&gt; Beryllium [[sulfide]], [[selenide]] and [[telluride (chemistry)|telluride]] are known, all having the [[Cubic crystal system#Zincblende structure|zincblende structure]].&lt;ref name="Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt;

[[Beryllium nitride]], Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a high-melting-point compound which is readily hydrolyzed. Beryllium azide, BeN&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is known and beryllium phosphide, Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a similar structure to Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Basic beryllium nitrate and [[basic beryllium acetate]] have similar tetrahedral structures with four beryllium atoms coordinated to a central oxide ion.&lt;ref name="Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt; A number of beryllium [[boride]]s are known, such as Be&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;B, Be&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;B, Be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B, BeB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, BeB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and BeB&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. [[Beryllium carbide]], Be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C, is a refractory brick-red compound that reacts with water to give [[methane]].&lt;ref name="Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt; No beryllium [[silicide]] has been identified.&lt;ref name="Greenwood"/&gt;

==History==
The mineral [[beryl]], which contains beryllium, has been used at least since the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] of Egypt.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=535}} In the first century [[Common Era|CE]], Roman naturalist [[Pliny the Elder]] mentioned in his encyclopedia ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' that beryl and [[emerald]] ("smaragdus") were similar.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=536}} The [[Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis]], written in the third or fourth century CE, contains notes on how to prepare artificial emerald and beryl.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=536}}

[[File:Louis Nicolas Vauquelin.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin]] discovered beryllium]]
Early analyses of emeralds and beryls by [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]], [[Torbern Olof Bergman]], [[Franz Karl Achard]], and Johann Jakob Bindheim always yielded similar elements, leading to the fallacious conclusion that both substances are [[aluminium silicate]]s.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=537}} Mineralogist [[René Just Haüy]] discovered that both crystals are geometrically identical, and he asked chemist [[Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin]] for a chemical analysis.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=535}}

In a 1798 paper read before the [[Institut de France]], Vauquelin reported that he found a new "earth" by dissolving [[aluminium hydroxide]] from emerald and beryl in an additional [[alkali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Annales de Chimie| first=Louis-Nicolas|last=Vauquelin|title=De l'Aiguemarine, ou Béril; et découverie d'une terre nouvelle dans cette pierre|trans-title=Aquamarine or beryl; and discovery of a new earth in this stone | date=1798| volume=26|pages=155–169|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dB8AAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editors of the journal ''Annales de Chimie et de Physique'' named the new earth "glucine" for the sweet taste of some of its compounds.&lt;ref&gt;In a footnote on [https://books.google.com/books?id=dB8AAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA169#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 169] of (Vauquelin, 1798), the editors write:  "(1)  La propriété la plus caractéristique de cette terre, confirmée par les dernières expériences de notre collègue, étant de former des sels d'une saveur sucrée, nous proposons de l'appeler ''glucine'', de γλυχυς, ''doux'', γλυχύ, ''vin doux'', γλυχαιτω, ''rendre doux'' … ''Note des Rédacteurs''."  ((1)  The most characteristic property of this earth, confirmed by the recent experiments of our colleague [Vauquelin], being to form salts with a sweet taste, we propose to call it ''glucine'' from γλυχυς, ''sweet'', γλυχύ, ''sweet wine'', γλυχαιτω, ''to make sweet'' … ''Note of the editors''.)&lt;/ref&gt; Klaproth preferred the name "beryllina" due to the fact that [[yttria]] also formed sweet salts.&lt;ref&gt;Klaproth, Martin Heinrich, ''Beitrage zur Chemischen Kenntniss der Mineralkörper'' (Contribution to the chemical knowledge of mineral substances), vol. 3, (Berlin, (Germany):  Heinrich August Rottmann, 1802), [https://books.google.com/books?id=8A8KAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 78-79]:  "Als Vauquelin der von ihm im Beryll und Smaragd entdeckten neuen Erde, wegen ihrer Eigenschaft, süsse Mittelsalze zu bilden, den Namen ''Glykine'', ''Süsserde'', beilegte, erwartete er wohl nicht, dass sich bald nachher eine anderweitige Erde finden würde, welche mit völlig gleichem Rechte Anspruch an diesen Namen machen können.  Um daher keine Verwechselung derselben mit der Yttererde zu veranlassen, würde es vielleicht gerathen seyn, jenen Namen ''Glykine'' aufzugeben, und durch Beryllerde (''Beryllina'') zu ersetzen; welche Namensveränderung auch bereits vom Hrn. Prof. Link, und zwar aus dem Grunde empfohlen worden, weil schon ein Pflanzengeschlecht ''Glycine'' vorhanden ist."  (When Vauquelin conferred -- on account of its property of forming sweet salts -- the name ''glycine'', ''sweet-earth'', on the new earth that had been found by him in beryl and smaragd, he certainly didn't expect that soon thereafter another earth would be found which with fully equal right could claim this name.  Therefore, in order to avoid confusion of it with yttria-earth, it would perhaps be advisable to abandon this name ''glycine'' and replace it with beryl-earth (''beryllina''); which name change was also recommended by Prof. Link, and for the reason that a genus of plants, ''Glycine'', already exists.)&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=538}}  The name "beryllium" was first used by Wöhler in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wöhler | first1 = F. | date = 1828 | title = Ueber das Beryllium und Yttrium |trans-title=On beryllium and yttrium | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3iAAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA577#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| journal = Annalen der Physik und Chemie | volume = 13 | issue = 89| pages = 577–582 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:BeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 K → 2 KCl + Be
Using an alcohol lamp, Wöhler heated alternating layers of beryllium chloride and potassium in a wired-shut platinum crucible. The above reaction immediately took place and caused the crucible to become white hot. Upon cooling and washing the resulting gray-black powder he saw that it was made of fine particles with a dark metallic luster.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=539}} The highly reactive potassium had been produced by the [[electrolysis]] of its compounds, a process discovered 21 years before. The chemical method using potassium yielded only small grains of beryllium from which no ingot of metal could be cast or hammered.

The direct electrolysis of a molten mixture of [[beryllium fluoride]] and [[sodium fluoride]] by [[Paul Lebeau]] in 1898 resulted in the first pure (99.5 to 99.8%) samples of beryllium.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=539}} However, industrial production started only after the First World War. The original industrial involvement included subsidiaries and scientists related to the Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation in Cleveland OH and Siemens &amp; Halske AG in Berlin. In the US, the process was ruled by Hugh S. Cooper, director of The Kemet Laboratories Company. In Germany, the first commercially successful process for producing beryllium was developed in 1921 by [[Alfred Stock]] and [[Hans Goldschmidt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boillat|first=Johann|date=2016-08-27|title=From Raw Material to Strategic Alloys. The Case of the International Beryllium Industry (1919-1939)|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309154800|journal=N.N.|volume=|pages=|doi=10.13140/rg.2.2.35545.11363|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sample of beryllium was bombarded with [[alpha ray]]s from the decay of [[radium]] in a 1932 experiment by [[James Chadwick]] that uncovered the existence of the [[neutron]].{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=58}} This same method is used in one class of radioisotope-based laboratory [[neutron source]]s that produce 30 neutrons for every million α particles.&lt;ref name=Merck/&gt;

Beryllium production saw a rapid increase during World War II, due to the rising demand for hard beryllium-copper alloys and [[phosphor]]s for [[fluorescent light]]s. Most early fluorescent lamps used [[zinc orthosilicate]] with varying content of beryllium to emit greenish light. Small additions of magnesium [[tungstate]] improved the blue part of the spectrum to yield an acceptable white light. Halophosphate-based phosphors replaced beryllium-based phosphors after beryllium was found to be toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=A Review of Early Inorganic Phosphors|chapter-url =https://books.google.com/books?id=klE5qGAltjAC&amp;pg=PA98|page=98|title=Revolution in lamps: a chronicle of 50 years of progress|isbn=978-0-88173-378-5|author1=Kane, Raymond|author2=Sell, Heinz|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrolysis of a mixture of [[beryllium fluoride]] and [[sodium fluoride]] was used to isolate beryllium during the 19th century. The metal's high melting point makes this process more energy-consuming than corresponding processes used for the [[alkali metals]]. Early in the 20th century, the production of beryllium by the thermal decomposition of [[beryllium iodide]] was investigated following the success of a similar process for the production of [[zirconium]], but this process proved to be uneconomical for volume production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/08827508808952633|title=Beryllium Extraction&amp;nbsp;– A Review|date=1988|author=Babu, R. S.|journal=Mineral Processing and Extractive Metallurgy Review|volume=4|pages=39–94|last2=Gupta|first2=C. K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pure beryllium metal did not become readily available until 1957, even though it had been used as an alloying metal to harden and toughen copper much earlier.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=58}} Beryllium could be produced by reducing beryllium compounds such as [[beryllium chloride]] with metallic potassium or sodium. Currently most beryllium is produced by reducing beryllium fluoride with purified [[magnesium]]. The price on the American market for [[Casting (metalworking)|vacuum-cast]] beryllium ingots was about $338 per pound ($745 per kilogram) in 2001.&lt;ref name="USGS"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/beryllium/|title=Beryllium Statistics and Information|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate =18 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1998 and 2008, the world's production of beryllium had decreased from 343 to about 200 [[tonne]]s, of which 176 tonnes (88%) came from the United States.&lt;ref name="USGSMCS2000"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/beryllium/100300.pdf|title=Commodity Summary 2000: Beryllium |publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate =16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USGSMCS2010"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/beryllium/mcs-2010-beryl.pdf|title=Commodity Summary 2000: Beryllium |publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate =16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
Early precursors of the word ''beryllium'' can be traced to many languages, including [[Latin]] {{lang|la|beryllus}}; [[French language|French]] {{lang|fr|béry}}; [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|βήρυλλος}}, {{lang|grc-Latn|bērullos}}, 'beryl'; [[Prakrit]] {{lang|pra|वॆरुलिय‌}} ({{lang|pra-Latn|veruliya}}); [[Pāli]] {{lang|pi|वेलुरिय}} ({{lang|pi-Latn|veḷuriya}}), {{lang|pi|भेलिरु}} ({{lang|pi-Latn|veḷiru}}) or {{lang|pi|भिलर्}} ({{lang|pi-Latn|viḷar}}) – "to become pale", in reference to the pale semiprecious gemstone beryl. The original source is probably the [[Sanskrit]] word {{lang|sa|वैडूर्य}} ({{lang|sa-Latn|vaidurya}}), which is of [[Dravidian languages|South Indian]] origin and could be related to the name of the modern city of [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|beryl}}&lt;/ref&gt; For about 160 years, beryllium was also known as {{anchor|Glucinium}} '''glucinum''' or '''glucinium''' (with the accompanying chemical symbol "'''Gl'''",&lt;ref&gt;Black, The Macmillan Company, New York, 1937&lt;/ref&gt; or "'''G'''" &lt;ref&gt;John Newlands' [[c:File:Newlands periodiska system 1866.png|table of octaves]]&lt;/ref&gt;), the name coming from the Ancient Greek word for sweet: {{wikt-lang|grc|γλυκύς}}, due to the sweet taste of beryllium [[salt (chemistry)|salts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/4.shtml |title=Beryllium |date=2010 |work=Periodic Table of Elements |publisher=[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] |accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Radiation windows===
[[File:Beryllium target.jpg|thumb|left|Beryllium target which "converts" a proton beam into a neutron beam]]
[[File:Be foil square.jpg|thumb|right|A square beryllium foil mounted in a steel case to be used as a window between a vacuum chamber and an [[X-ray microscope]]. Beryllium is highly transparent to X-rays owing to its low [[atomic number]].]]
Because of its low atomic number and very low absorption for X-rays, the oldest and still one of the most important applications of beryllium is in radiation windows for [[X-ray tube]]s.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=58}} Extreme demands are placed on purity and cleanliness of beryllium to avoid artifacts in the X-ray images. Thin beryllium foils are used as radiation windows for X-ray detectors, and the extremely low absorption minimizes the heating effects caused by high intensity, low energy X-rays typical of [[synchrotron]] radiation. Vacuum-tight windows and beam-tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons are manufactured exclusively from beryllium. In scientific setups for various X-ray emission studies (e.g., [[energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]]) the sample holder is usually made of beryllium because its emitted X-rays have much lower energies (~100&amp;nbsp;eV) than X-rays from most studied materials.&lt;ref name=Be/&gt;

Low [[atomic number]] also makes beryllium relatively transparent to energetic [[Elementary particle|particles]]. Therefore, it is used to build the [[beamline|beam pipe]] around the collision region in [[particle physics]] setups, such as all four main detector experiments at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] ([[A Large Ion Collider Experiment|ALICE]], [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]], [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]], [[LHCb]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Installation and commissioning of vacuum systems for the LHC particle detectors|publisher=CERN|first1 =R.|last1=Veness|first2 =D.|last2 =Ramos|first3 =P.|last3 =Lepeule|first4 =A.|last4=Rossi|first5 =G.|last5 =Schneider|first6 =S.|last6 =Blanchard|url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/PAC2009/papers/mo6rfp010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Tevatron]] and the [[SLAC]]. The low density of beryllium allows collision products to reach the surrounding detectors without significant interaction, its stiffness allows a powerful vacuum to be produced within the pipe to minimize interaction with gases, its thermal stability allows it to function correctly at temperatures of only a few degrees above [[absolute zero]], and its [[diamagnetic]] nature keeps it from interfering with the complex multipole magnet systems used to steer and [[strong focusing|focus]] the [[particle beam]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0168-9002(01)01149-4|title=A new inner vertex detector for STAR|date=2001|author=Wieman, H|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A|volume=473|issue=1–2|pages=205|bibcode=2001NIMPA.473..205W|last2=Bieser|first2=F.|last3=Kleinfelder|first3=S.|last4=Matis|first4=H.

===Mechanical applications===
Because of its stiffness, light weight and dimensional stability over a wide temperature range, beryllium metal is used for lightweight structural components in the defense and [[aerospace]] industries in high-speed [[aircraft]], [[guided missile]]s, [[spacecraft]], and [[satellite]]s. Several [[liquid-fuel rocket]]s have used [[rocket engine nozzle|rocket nozzles]] made of pure beryllium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=IpEnvBtSfPQC&amp;pg=PA690| title=Metals handbook|chapter=Beryllium|first=Joseph R.|last=Davis|publisher=ASM International|date=1998|isbn=978-0-87170-654-6|pages=690–691}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6fdmMuj0rNEC&amp;pg=PA62|page=62|title=Encyclopedia of materials, parts, and finishes|author=Schwartz, Mel M. |publisher=CRC Press|date=2002|isbn=978-1-56676-661-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beryllium powder was itself studied as a [[rocket fuel]], but this use has never materialized.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=58}} A small number of extreme high-end [[bicycle frame]]s have been built with beryllium.&lt;ref name=museum&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mombat.org/American.htm|title=Museum of Mountain Bike Art &amp; Technology: American Bicycle Manufacturing|access-date=26 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720022521/http://mombat.org/American.htm|archive-date=20 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1998 to 2000, the [[McLaren]] [[Formula One]] team used [[Mercedes-Benz]] engines with beryllium-aluminium-[[alloy]] pistons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ward|first=Wayne|title=Aluminium-Beryllium|url=http://www.ret-monitor.com/articles/967/aluminium-beryllium/?|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801083918/http://www.ret-monitor.com/articles/967/aluminium-beryllium/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 August 2010|publisher=Ret-Monitor|accessdate=18 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of beryllium engine components was banned following a protest by [[Scuderia Ferrari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Collantine|first=Keith|title=Banned! – Beryllium|url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2007/02/08/banned-beryllium/|accessdate=18 July 2012|date=2007-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixing about 2.0% beryllium into [[copper]] forms an [[alloy]] called [[beryllium copper]] that is six times stronger than copper alone.&lt;ref name="McGraw-Hill2004"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beryllium alloys are used in many applications because of their combination of elasticity, high [[electrical conductivity]] and [[thermal conductivity]], high strength and [[hardness (materials science)|hardness]], nonmagnetic properties, as well as good [[corrosion]] and [[fatigue (material)|fatigue resistance]].{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=58}}&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt; These applications include&lt;!-- the making of [[spot welding]] electrodes,--&gt; non-sparking tools that are used near flammable gases ([[beryllium nickel]]), in [[spring (device)|springs]] and membranes (beryllium nickel and [[beryllium iron]]) used in surgical instruments and high temperature devices&lt;!-- and [[electrical contact]]s--&gt;.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=58}}&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt; As little as 50 parts per million of beryllium alloyed with liquid [[magnesium]] leads to a significant increase in oxidation resistance and decrease in flammability.&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt;

The high elastic stiffness of beryllium has led to its extensive use in precision instrumentation, e.g. in  [[inertial guidance]] systems and in the support mechanisms for optical systems.&lt;ref name=Be/&gt; Beryllium-copper alloys were also applied as a hardening agent in "Jason pistols", which were used to strip the paint from the hulls of ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=1 February 2005|accessdate=8 August 2009|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Defence-forces-face-rare-toxic-metal-exposure-risk/2005/02/01/1107228681666.html|title=Defence forces face rare toxic metal exposure risk|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beryllium was also used for cantilevers in high performance phonograph cartridge styli, where its extreme stiffness and low density allowed for tracking weights to be reduced to 1 gram, yet still track high frequency passages with minimal distortion.&lt;ref&gt;Shure V15VxMR user's guide, Page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier major application of beryllium was in [[brake]]s for military [[airplane]]s because of its hardness, high melting point, and exceptional ability to [[heat dissipation|dissipate heat]]. Environmental considerations have led to substitution by other materials.&lt;ref name=Be/&gt;

To reduce costs, beryllium can be [[alloy]]ed with significant amounts of [[aluminium]], resulting in the [[AlBeMet]] alloy  (a trade name). This blend is cheaper than pure beryllium, while still retaining many desirable properties.

===Mirrors===
Beryllium [[mirror]]s are of particular interest. Large-area mirrors, frequently with a [[honeycomb mirror|honeycomb support structure]], are used, for example, in [[meteorological satellite]]s where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in [[control system|optical guidance]] systems and in [[fire-control system]]s, e.g. in the German-made [[Leopard 1]] and [[Leopard 2]] [[main battle tank]]s. In these systems, very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard [[electroless nickel plating]] which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to [[cryogenic]] operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle.&lt;ref name=Be/&gt;

The [[James Webb Space Telescope]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/mirror.html|title=Beryllium related details from NASA|accessdate =18 September 2008|publisher =NASA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529052057/http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/mirror.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=29 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; will have 18 hexagonal beryllium sections for its mirrors.

===Magnetic applications===
[[File:BERYLLIUM - KUGEL 1.JPG|thumb|Sphere Beryllium B52 - [[Gyrocompass]]]]

Beryllium is non-magnetic. Therefore, tools fabricated out of beryllium-based materials are used by naval or military [[explosive ordnance disposal]] teams for work on or near [[naval mine]]s, since these mines commonly have [[fuze|magnetic fuzes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0263919|title=The selection of low-magnetic alloys for EOD tools|publisher=Naval Weapons Plant Washington DC|author=Kojola, Kenneth|author2=Lurie, William|date=9 August 1961|access-date=28 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823130608/http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0263919|archive-date=23 August 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also found in maintenance and construction materials near [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) machines because of the high magnetic fields generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EqtlqFNkWwQC&amp;pg=PT891|page=891|title=Understanding anesthesia equipment|author=Dorsch, Jerry A.|author2=Dorsch, Susan E.|last-author-amp=yes|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|date=2007|isbn=978-0-7817-7603-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fields of [[radio communication]]s and powerful (usually military) [[radar]]s, hand tools made of beryllium are used to tune the highly magnetic [[klystron]]s, [[magnetron]]s, [[traveling wave tube]]s, etc., that are used for generating high levels of [[microwave]] power in the [[transmitter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yZ786vEild0C&amp;pg=PA7|page=7|title=Encyclopedia of the Alkaline Earth Compounds|isbn=9780444595539|author1=Ropp|first1=Richard C.|date=2012-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear applications===
Thin plates or foils of beryllium are sometimes used in [[nuclear weapon design]]s as the very outer layer of the [[plutonium pit]]s in the primary stages of [[thermonuclear bomb]]s, placed to surround the [[fissile]] material. These layers of beryllium are good "pushers" for the [[implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]] of the [[plutonium-239]], and they are good [[neutron reflector]]s, just as in beryllium-moderated [[nuclear reactors]].&lt;ref name=weapons/&gt;

Beryllium is also commonly used in some [[neutron source]]s in laboratory devices in which relatively few neutrons are needed (rather than having to use a nuclear reactor, or a [[particle accelerator]]-powered [[neutron generator]]). For this purpose, a target of beryllium-9 is bombarded with energetic alpha particles from a [[radioisotope]] such as [[polonium]]-210, [[radium]]-226, [[plutonium]]-238, or [[americium]]-241. In the nuclear reaction that occurs, a beryllium nucleus is [[Nuclear transmutation|transmuted]] into carbon-12, and one free neutron is emitted, traveling in about the same direction as the alpha particle was heading. Such [[alpha decay]] driven beryllium neutron sources, named [[Modulated neutron initiator|"urchin"]] neutron initiators, were used in some early [[atomic bomb]]s.&lt;ref name=weapons&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yTIOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA35|page=35|title=How nuclear weapons spread|author=Barnaby, Frank |publisher=Routledge|date=1993|isbn=978-0-415-07674-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neutron sources in which beryllium is bombarded with [[gamma ray]]s from a [[gamma decay]] radioisotope, are also used to produce laboratory neutrons.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, J.

Beryllium is also used in fuel fabrication for [[CANDU]] reactors.  The fuel elements have small appendages that are resistance brazed to the fuel cladding using an induction brazing process with Be as the braze filler material.  Bearing pads are brazed in place to prevent fuel bundle to pressure tube contact, and inter-element spacer pads are brazed on to prevent element to element contact.

Beryllium is also used at the [[Joint European Torus]] [[nuclear fusion|nuclear-fusion research laboratory]], and it will be used in the more advanced [[ITER]] to condition the components which face the plasma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9ngHTkC8hG8C&amp;pg=PA15|page=15|title=Nuclear fusion research|author=Clark, R.

In critical electronic applications, beryllium is both a structural support and [[heat sink]]. The application also requires a coefficient of [[thermal expansion]] that is well matched to the alumina and [[glass-reinforced plastic|polyimide-glass]] [[Substrate (materials science)|substrates]]. The beryllium-beryllium oxide [[metal matrix composite|composite]] "[[E-Material]]s" have been specially designed for these electronic applications and have the additional advantage that the thermal expansion coefficient can be tailored to match diverse substrate materials.&lt;ref name=Be/&gt;

[[Beryllium oxide]] is useful for many applications that require the combined properties of an [[electrical insulator]] and an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, and a very high melting point. Beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in [[power semiconductor device|high-power]] [[transistor]]s in [[radio frequency]] [[transmitter]]s for telecommunications.

The toxicity of finely divided beryllium (dust or powder, mainly encountered in industrial settings where beryllium is produced or machined) is very well-documented. Solid beryllium metal does not carry the same hazards as airborne inhaled dust, but any hazard associated with physical contact is poorly documented. Workers handling finished beryllium pieces are routinely advised to handle them with gloves, both as a precaution and because many if not most applications of beryllium cannot tolerate residue of skin contact such as fingerprints.

Acute beryllium disease in the form of [[chemical pneumonitis]] was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. A survey found that about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing [[fluorescent lamp]]s in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=5}} Chronic berylliosis resembles [[sarcoidosis]] in many respects, and the [[differential diagnosis]] is often difficult. It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as [[Herbert L. Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/Photos/CP1/image5.shtml|title=Photograph of Chicago Pile One Scientists 1946|date=19 June 2006|publisher=Office of Public Affairs, Argonne National Laboratory|accessdate =18 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beryllium may be found in coal slag. When the slag is formulated into an abrasive agent for blasting paint and rust from hard surfaces, the beryllium can become airborne and become a source of exposure.&lt;ref name="shapiro"&gt;[http://articles.dailypress.com/2013-08-31/business/dp-nws-shipyard-beryllium-20130831_1_beryllium-shipyard-workers-slag Newport News Shipbuilding Workers Face a Hidden Toxin], [[Daily Press (Virginia)]], Michael Welles Shapiro, 31 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Early researchers tasted beryllium and its various compounds for sweetness in order to verify its presence. Modern diagnostic equipment no longer necessitates this highly risky procedure and no attempt should be made to ingest this highly toxic substance.&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt; Beryllium and its compounds should be handled with great care and special precautions must be taken when carrying out any activity which could result in the release of beryllium dust ([[lung cancer]] is a possible result of prolonged exposure to beryllium-laden dust). Although the use of beryllium compounds in fluorescent lighting tubes was discontinued in 1949, potential for exposure to beryllium exists in the nuclear and aerospace industries and in the refining of beryllium metal and melting of beryllium-containing alloys, the manufacturing of electronic devices, and the handling of other beryllium-containing material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc106.htm |title=Beryllium: ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH CRITERIA 106 |author=International Programme On Chemical Safety |date= 1990 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A successful test for beryllium in air and on surfaces has been recently developed and published as an international voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202. The procedure uses dilute [[ammonium bifluoride]] for dissolution and fluorescence detection with beryllium bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline, allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration in the workplace. Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration. The new procedure has been successfully tested on a variety of surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and ultratrace detection of refractory beryllium oxide and siliceous beryllium (ASTM D7458).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/D7458.htm|title=ASTM D7458&amp;nbsp;–08|accessdate=8 August 2009|publisher=American Society for Testing and Materials}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1520/JAI13168|title=Development of a New Fluorescence Method for the Detection of Beryllium on Surfaces|date=2005|last1=Minogue|first1 =E.

The '''crude oil engine''' is a type of [[internal combustion engine]] similar to the [[hot bulb engine]]. A crude oil engine could be driven by all sorts of oils such as engine waste oil and vegetable oils. Even peanut oil and butter could be used as fuel if necessary. Like hot bulb engines, crude oil engines were mostly used as stationary engines or in boats/ships. They can run for a very long time; for instance, at the [[Milan International (1906)|world fair]] in [[Milan]] in 1906, a FRAM engine was started and ran until the exhibition was over one month later. A crude oil engine is a low RPM engine dimensioned for constant running and can last for a very long time if maintained properly. It was later replaced by the [[diesel engine]].

==Modern crude oil engines==
Many modern diesel engines are capable of running on pure crude oil. They are often used in the oil and gas exploration and production industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mandieselturbo.com/0000600/Products/Power-Plant-Engines/Fuels.html |title=MAN Diesel &amp; Turbo SE - FUELS |publisher=Mandieselturbo.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many large diesel engines, such as those used on large container ships, can also run directly off crude oil.

A '''cumulonimbus incus''' (Latin ''incus'', "[[anvil]]") also known as an '''anvil cloud''' is a [[cumulonimbus cloud]] which has reached the level of [[tropopause|stratospheric stability]] and has formed the characteristic flat, anvil-top shape.  It signifies the [[thunderstorm]] in its mature stage, succeeding the [[cumulonimbus calvus]] stage. Cumulonimbus incus  is a sub-form of [[Cumulonimbus capillatus]].

==Hazards==
A '''cumulonimbus incus''' is a mature thunderstorm cloud generating many dangerous elements.

*[[Lightning]]; this storm cloud is capable of producing bursts of cloud to ground lightning.
*[[Hail]]; hailstones may fall from this cloud if it's a highly unstable environment (which favors a more vigorous storm [[updraft]]).
*Heavy [[rain]]; this cloud may drop several inches of rain in a short amount of time. This can cause [[flash flood]]ing
*Strong [[wind]]; gale-force winds from a [[downburst]] may occur under this cloud.
*[[Tornadoes]]; in severe cases (most commonly with [[supercell]]s), it can produce tornadoes.

==Classification==
Cumulonimbus clouds can be powerful. If the correct atmospheric conditions are met, they can grow into a [[supercell]] storm. This cloud may be a [[single-cell thunderstorm]] or one cell in a [[multicellular thunderstorm]]. They are capable of producing severe storm conditions for a short amount of time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4072">In [[atomic physics|atomic]], [[molecular physics|molecular]], and [[solid-state physics]], the '''electric field gradient''' ('''EFG''') measures the rate of change of the [[electric field]] at an [[atomic nucleus]] generated by the [[electron]]ic [[charge distribution]] and the other nuclei. The EFG couples with the nuclear electric [[quadrupole moment]] of quadrupolar nuclei (those with spin quantum number greater than one-half) to generate an effect which can be measured using several [[spectroscopic]] methods, such as [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR), [[microwave spectroscopy]], [[electron paramagnetic resonance]] (EPR, ESR), [[nuclear quadrupole resonance]] (NQR), [[Mössbauer spectroscopy]] or [[perturbed angular correlation]] (PAC). The EFG is non-zero only if the charges surrounding the nucleus violate [[cubic symmetry]] and therefore generate an inhomogeneous electric field at the position of the nucleus.

EFGs are highly sensitive to the [[electronic density]] in the immediate vicinity of a nucleus. This is because the EFG [[Operator (physics)|operator]] scales as ''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''r'' is the distance from a nucleus. This sensitivity has been used to study effects on charge distribution resulting from substitution, weak interactions, and charge transfer.

==Definition==

A given charge distribution of electrons and nuclei, ''&amp;rho;''('''r'''), generates an [[electrostatic potential]] ''V''('''r'''). The derivative of this potential is the negative of the [[electric field]] generated. The first derivatives of the field, or the second derivatives of the potential, is the electric field gradient. The nine components of the EFG are thus defined as the second partial derivatives of the electrostatic potential, evaluated at the position of a nucleus:

:&lt;math&gt;V_{ij} = \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}.&lt;/math&gt;

For each nucleus, the components ''V&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' are combined as a symmetric 3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;3 matrix. Under the assumption that the charge distribution generating the electrostatic potential is external to the nucleus, the matrix is [[traceless]], for in that situation [[Laplace's equation]], &amp;nabla;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''V''('''r''')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, holds. Relaxing this assumption, a more general form of the EFG tensor which retains the symmetry and traceless character is

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{ij}=V_{ij}-\frac{1}{3}\delta_{ij}\nabla^2V,&lt;/math&gt;

where &amp;nabla;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''V''('''r''') is evaluated at a given nucleus.

As ''V'' (and ''&amp;phi;'') is symmetric it can be [[diagonalized]]. The principal tensor components are usually denoted ''V&lt;sub&gt;zz&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''V&lt;sub&gt;yy&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''V&lt;sub&gt;xx&lt;/sub&gt;'' in order of decreasing [[absolute value|modulus]]. Given the traceless character, only two of the principal components are independent. Typically these are described by ''V&lt;sub&gt;zz&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the '''asymmetry parameter''', ''&amp;eta;'', defined as

:&lt;math&gt;
\eta = \frac{V_{xx} - V_{yy}}{V_{zz}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\vert V_{zz} \vert \geq \vert V_{yy} \vert \geq \vert V_{xx} \vert&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_{zz} + V_{yy} + V_{xx}=0&lt;/math&gt;, thus &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \eta \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;.

An '''[[Energy conservation]] measure''' (ECM) is any type of project conducted, or technology implemented, to reduce the consumption of energy in a building. The types of projects implemented can be in a variety of forms but usually are designed to reduce utility costs: water, electricity and gas being the main three for industrial and commercial enterprises. The aim of an ECM should be to achieve a savings, reducing the amount of [[energy]] used by a particular process, technology or facility.

Energy conservation measures are often combined into larger guaranteed [[Energy Savings Performance Contract]]s to maximize energy savings while minimizing disruption to building occupants by coordinating renovations.  Some ECMs cost less to implement yet return a higher energy savings.  Traditionally, lighting projects were a good example of “low hanging fruit”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publicpower.org/Media/magazine/ArticleDetail.cfm?ItemNumber=40476&lt;/ref&gt; that could be used to drive implementation of more substantial upgrades to HVAC systems in large facilities.  Smaller buildings might combine window replacement with modern insulation using advanced building foams to improve energy performance.  Energy dashboard projects&lt;ref&gt;http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/08/an-energy-dashboard-for-buildings/&lt;/ref&gt; are a new kind of ECM which relies on the behavioral change of building occupants to save energy.  When implemented as part of a program, case studies  (such as that for the DC Schools) report energy savings up 30%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dcgreenschoolschallenge.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the right circumstances, open energy dashboards can even be implemented for free&lt;ref&gt;https://www.drupal.org/project/bacnet&lt;/ref&gt; to improve upon these savings even more.

On a global basis [[energy conservation|energy efficiency]] works behind the scenes to improve our energy security, lower our energy bills and move us closer to reaching our climate goals.  According to the IEA, some 40% of the global energy efficiency market is financed with debt and equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iea.org/newsroomandevents/pressreleases/2014/october/global-energy-efficiency-market-an-invisible-powerhouse-at-least-usd-310byr.html | title= Global Energy Efficiency}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Energy Performance Investment]] are one financing mechanism by which ECMs can be implemented now and paid for by the savings realized over the life of the project. While all 50 states, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., have statutes allowing companies to offer energy savings performance contracts, success varies because of variations in the approach, the state’s degree of involvement and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncsl.org/research/energy/state-energy-savings-performance-contracting.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/guaranteed_energy_savings_act/14339&lt;/ref&gt; Homes and businesses are implementing energy-efficiency measures that include low-energy lighting, insulation and even high tech energy dashboards to cut bills by avoiding waste and boosting productivity.

Businesses implementing ECMs in their commercial buildings often employ [[Energy service company|Energy Service Companies]] (ESCOs) experienced in energy performance contracting . This industry has been around since the 1970s and is more prevalent than ever today. The US-based organization EVO (Efficiency Valuation Organization)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.evo-world.org | title= Efficiency Valuation Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; has created a set of guidelines for ESCOs to adhere to in evaluating the savings achieved by ECMs. These guidelines are called the [[IPMVP|International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol]] (IPMVP).

Homeowners implementing ECMs in their residential buildings often start with an [[energy audit]].  This is a way homeowners look at what areas of their homes are using, and possibly losing energy. Residential energy auditors are accredited by the [[Building Performance Institute]] (BPI)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bpi.org/professionals.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; or the Residential Energy Services Network ([[RESNET]]).&lt;ref name="energy.ca.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/HERS/index.html |title=Home Energy Rating System Program (HERS) |publisher=Energy.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Southface"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southface.org/learning-center/trainings/home-energy-rating-system |title=Home Energy Rating System |publisher=Southface.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homeowners can hire a professional or do it themselves&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, B. , Carter, E. , Gall, E. , Earnest, C. , Walsh, E. , et al.

==Types of energy conservation measures==

===Energy Dashboards===
Energy Dashboards combine smart metering and Internet technologies to provide real-time data on energy use.  Their success is based on the premise that real-time feedback drives behavior change and improves operational efficiency. Energy Dashboards are used to enable energy reduction competitions, showcase real-time building performance and [[green building]] features, and empower occupants to become active participants in energy management. [[Sustainability]] teams from major corporations, governments, universities and K–12 public schools use energy dashboards as an effective communication tool that creates transparency.

===Lighting===
One of the simplest ways consumers save a copious amount of energy is switching [[incandescent light bulb]] to a [[compact fluorescent]] lamp (CFL). A 15W [[Compact fluorescent lamp|CFL]] is capable of providing just as much light as a 60W incandescent, while consuming just one fourth of the amount of energy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/translating-uncle-sam/stories/cfl-vs-incandescent-battle-of-the-bulb&lt;/ref&gt;

In a typical power distribution grid, electric [[transformer]] power loss typically contributes about 40-50% of the total transmission and distribution loss. Energy efficient transformers are therefore an important means to reduce transmission and distribution loss.&lt;ref&gt;B. Kennedy, “Energy Efficient Transformers” McGraw-Hill, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; With the improvement of [[electrical steel]] (silicon steel) properties, the losses of a transformer in 2010 can be half that of a similar transformer in the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} With new magnetic materials, it is possible to achieve even higher efficiency.

*guaranteed [[grid access]]
*long-term contracts 
*cost-based purchase prices

Under a feed-in tariff, eligible [[renewable electricity]] generators, including homeowners, business owners, farmers and private investors, are paid a cost-based price for the renewable electricity they supply to the grid. This enables diverse technologies (wind, solar, biogas, etc.) to be developed and provides investors a reasonable return. This principle was explained in Germany's 2000 [[German Renewable Energy Sources Act|Renewable Energy Sources Act]]:

{{quote|The compensation rates ... have been determined by means of scientific studies, subject to the provision that the rates identified should make it possible for an installation – when managed efficiently – to be operated cost-effectively, based on the use of [[state-of-the-art]] technology and depending on the renewable energy sources naturally available in a given geographical environment.|2000 Renewable Energy Sources Act&lt;ref name="eeg-2000"&gt;

As a result, the tariff (or rate) may differ by technology, location (e.g. rooftop or ground-mounted for [[solar PV]] projects), size (residential or commercial scale) and region.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The tariffs are typically designed to decline over time to track and encourage technological change.&lt;ref name="Couture, T. 2010"&gt;Couture, T., Gagnon, Y., (2010).

{{As of|2010}}, feed-in tariff policies had been enacted in over 50 countries, including Algeria, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iran, Republic of Ireland, Israel, Italy, Kenya, the Republic of Korea, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Tanzania, Thailand, Turkey and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="ren21_2010"&gt;[http://www.ren21.net/REN21ProductsServices/Publications/GlobalStatusReport/Renewables2010GlobalStatusReport/tabid/5824/Default.aspx REN21 Global Status Report, 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618132050/http://www.ren21.net/REN21ProductsServices/Publications/GlobalStatusReport/Renewables2010GlobalStatusReport/tabid/5824/Default.aspx |date=18 June 2012 }}, pp.37-8, Tab.2&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2012 in Spain, the Rajoy administration suspended the feed-in tariff for new projects.&lt;ref name="ren21_2012"&gt;[http://www.map.ren21.net/GSR/GSR2012.pdf REN21 Global Status Report, 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215215616/http://www.map.ren21.net/GSR/GSR2012.pdf |date=15 December 2012 }}, p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

A feed-in tariff can differentiate on the basis of marginal cost. This is a theoretical alternative which is based on the concept of price differentiation (Finon). Under such a policy the tariff price ranges from some level slightly above the spot rate to the price required to obtain the optimal level of production determined by the government. Firms with lower marginal costs receive prices on the lower end of the spectrum that increase their revenue but not by as much as under the uniform feed-in tariff. The more marginal producers face the higher tariff price. This version of the policy has two objectives. The first is to reduce the profitability of certain production sites.

Many renewable sources are highly dependent on their location. For example, windmills are most profitable in windy locations, and solar plants are best at sunny locations. This means that generators tend to be concentrated at these most profitable sites. The differentiated tariff seeks to make less naturally productive sites more profitable and so spread out the generators which many consider to be an undesirable good in the area (Finon). Imagine cutting down all the forests to build wind farms; this would not be good for the environment. This, however, leads to a less cost-effective production of renewable electricity as the most efficient sites are under-utilized. The other goal of tariffs differentiated by marginal cost is to reduce the cost of the program (Finon). Under the uniform tariff all producers receive the same price which is at times in gross excess of the price needed to incentivize them to produce. The additional revenue translates into profit. Thus, the differentiated tariff attempts to give each producer what it requires to maintain production so that the optimal market quantity of renewable energy production can be reached (Finon).&lt;ref&gt;Finon, Dominique and Menanteau, Philippe (2004) "The Static and Dynamic Efficiency of Instruments of Promotion of Renewables," Energy Studies Review: Vol. 12: Iss. 1, Article 3. Available at: &lt;http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/esr/vol12/iss1/3&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, and in light of incipient globalization, feed-in tariffs are posing increasing problems from the point of view of trade, as their implementation in one country can easily affect industries and policies of others, thus requiring an ideally global coordination of treatment and imposition of such policy instrument, which could be reached at the World Trade Organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|last2=Cima|first2=Elena|title=World Trade Organization, Renewable Energy Subsidies and the Case of Feed-In Tariffs: Time for Reform Toward Sustainable Development?|journal=Georgetown International Environmental Law Review (GIELR)|date=2015|volume= 27|issue= 1|ssrn=2704398|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Feed-in Tariff meter connections.png|thumb|Understanding Feed-in Tariff and Power Purchase Agreement meter connections]]
There are three methods of compensation.
*Feed-in tariff&amp;nbsp;– compensation is above retail, and as the percentage of adopters increases, the FIT is reduced to the retail rate.
*[[Net metering]]&amp;nbsp;– allows producers to consume electricity from the grid, e.g., when the wind stops. Credits typically roll over to future periods. Payments (to the utility or the consumer) depend on net consumption.
*[[Power Purchase Agreement]]&amp;nbsp;– pays for the generation of electricity and is normally below the retail rate, although in the case of solar can in some countries be higher, because solar in many countries generates at times of peak demand.

==History==

=== United States ===
The first form of feed-in tariff (under another name) was implemented in the US in 1978 under President [[Jimmy Carter]], who signed the [[National Energy Act]] (NEA). This law included five separate Acts, one of which was the [[Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act]] (PURPA). The purpose of the National Energy Act was to encourage [[energy conservation]] and develop new energy resources, including [[renewable]]s such as wind, solar and geothermal power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.gsm.uci.edu/~navarro/windfinal110899.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080909231828/http://web.gsm.uci.edu/~navarro/windfinal110899.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 September 2008 |title=Policy Options for Promoting Wind Energy Development in California: A Report to the Governor and State Legislature |publisher= |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirsh, R. F. 1999 pp. 60-72"&gt;Hirsh, R. F. (1999). " PURPA: The Spur to Competition and Utility Restructuring," The Electricity Journal, Vol. 12, Issue 7, pp. 60–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within PURPA was a provision that required utilities to purchase electricity generated from qualifying independent power producers at rates not to exceed their avoided cost.&lt;ref name="Hirsh, R. F. 1999 pp. 60-72"/&gt; Avoided costs were designed to reflect the cost that a utility would incur to provide that same electrical generation. Different interpretations of PURPA prevailed in the 1980s: some utilities and state utility commissions interpreted avoided costs narrowly to mean avoided fuel costs, while others chose to define "avoided costs" as the "avoided long-run marginal cost" of generation.&lt;ref name="Hirsh, R. F. 1999 pp. 60-72"/&gt; The long-run costs referred to the anticipated cost of electricity in the years ahead. This last approach was adopted by California in its Standard Offer Contract No. 4.&lt;ref&gt;Guey Lee, L. (1999). Korean Energy Economics Institute (KEEI). Retrieved 19 August 2009 [http://www.keei.re.kr/keei/download/ef0505_60.pdf Renewable electricity purchases: History and recent developments]&lt;/ref&gt; Another provision included in the PURPA law was that utilities were prevented from owning more than 50% of projects, to encourage new entrants.&lt;ref name="Hirsh, R. F. 1999 pp. 60-72"/&gt;

To comply with PURPA, some states began offering Standard Offer Contracts to producers. California's Public Utility Commission established a number of Standard Offer Contracts, including Standard Offer No.4 (SO4), which made use of fixed prices, based on the expected long-run cost of generation. The long-run estimates of electricity costs were based on the belief (widely held at the time) that oil and gas prices would continue to increase.&lt;ref name="boell.org"&gt;Rickerson, W.; Grace, R.C. (March 2007). Washington, DC: Heinrich Boll Foundation. Retrieved 16 March 2009 [http://www.boell.org/docs/Rickerson_Grace_FINAL.pdf The Debate over Fixed Price Incentives for Renewable Electricity in Europe and the United States: Fallout and Future Directions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925201817/http://www.boell.org/docs/Rickerson_Grace_FINAL.pdf |date=25 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to an escalating schedule of fixed purchase prices, designed to reflect the long-run avoided costs of new electrical generation. By 1992, private power producers had installed approximately 1,700 MW of wind capacity in California, some of which is still in service today. The adoption of PURPA also led to significant renewable energy generation in states such as Florida, and Maine.&lt;ref name="Hirsh, R. F. 1999 pp. 60-72"/&gt;

This notwithstanding, PURPA retains negative connotations in the U.S. electricity industry. When oil and gas prices plummeted in the late 1980s, the Standard Offer Contracts that were signed to encourage new renewable energy development seemed high by comparison. As a result, PURPA contracts came to be seen as an expensive burden on electricity ratepayers.&lt;ref name="boell.org"/&gt;

Another source of opposition to PURPA stemmed from the fact that it was designed to encourage non-utility generation. This was interpreted as a threat by many large utilities, particularly monopolistic suppliers. As a result of its encouragement of non-utility generation, PURPA has also been interpreted as an important step toward increasing competition.&lt;ref name="Hirsh, R. F. 1999 pp. 60-72"/&gt;

=== Europe ===
In 1990, Germany adopted its "Stromeinspeisungsgesetz" (StrEG), or "Law on Feeding Electricity into the Grid".&lt;ref name="Germany, Stromeinspeisungsgesetz 1990"&gt;Germany, Stromeinspeisungsgesetz (StrEG) (1990). Germany's Act on Feeding Renewable Energies into the Grid of 7 December 1990," Federal Law Gazette I p.2663, unofficial translation. Retrieved 9 July 2009 at: {{cite web|url=http://wind-works.org/FeedLaws/Germany/ARTsDE.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713154349/http://www.wind-works.org/FeedLaws/Germany/ARTsDE.html |archivedate=13 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The StrEG required utilities to purchase electricity generated from renewable energy suppliers at a percentage of the prevailing retail price of electricity. The percentage offered to solar and wind power was set at 90% of the residential electricity price, while other technologies such as hydro power and biomass sources were offered percentages ranging from 65–80%. A project cap of 5 MW was included.&lt;ref name="Germany, Stromeinspeisungsgesetz 1990"/&gt;

While Germany's StrEG was insufficient to encourage costlier technologies such as photovoltaics, it proved relatively effective at encouraging lower-cost technologies such as wind, leading to the deployment of 4,400 MW of new wind capacity between 1991 and 1999, representing approximately one third of the global capacity at the time.&lt;ref name="eeg-2000"/&gt;

An additional challenge that StrEG addressed was the right to interconnect to the grid. The StrEG guaranteed renewable electricity producers grid access.&lt;ref name="eeg-2000"/&gt; Similar percentage-based feed-in laws were adopted in Spain,&lt;ref&gt;del Río Gonzalez, P. (2008).

=== Germany's Renewable Energy Sources Act ===

{{main article|German Renewable Energy Sources Act}}

Germany's feed-in law underwent a major restructuring in 2000 to become the [[German Renewable Energy Sources Act|Renewable Energy Sources Act (2000)]] ({{lang-de|Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz}} or ''EEG'').&lt;ref name="eeg-2000"/&gt;  The long title is an act on granting priority to renewable energy sources.  In its new form, the act proved to be a highly effective policy framework for accelerating the deployment of renewables.&lt;ref name="Jacobsson, S. 2006 pp. 256"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Important changes included:&lt;ref name="Jacobsson, S. 2006 pp. 256"/&gt;

* purchase prices were based on generation cost – this led to different prices for different technologies and for projects of varying sizes
* utilities were allowed to participate
* rates were designed to decline annually based on expected cost reductions, known as 'tariff degression'

Since it was very successful, the German policy (amended in 2004, 2009, and 2012) was often used as the benchmark against which other feed-in tariff policies were considered.  Other countries followed the German approach.  Long-term contracts are typically offered in a non-discriminatory manner to all renewable energy producers.  Because purchase prices are based on costs, efficiently operated projects yield a reasonable rate of return.&lt;ref name="Lipp, J. 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="feed-in-cooperation.org"&gt;

This principle was stated in the act:

{{quote|"The compensation rates ... have been determined by means of scientific studies, subject to the proviso that the rates identified should make it possible for an installation – when managed efficiently – to be operated cost-effectively, based on the use of state-of-the-art technology and depending on the renewable energy sources naturally available in a given geographical environment."|Renewable Energy Sources Act (2000)&lt;ref name="eeg-2000"/&gt;{{rp|16}}}}

Feed-in tariff policies typically target a 5–10% return.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}  The success of photovoltaics in Germany resulted in a drop in electricity prices of up to 40% during peak output times, with savings between €520 million and €840 million for consumers.&lt;ref name="Parkinson13022012"&gt;

Often all power produced is fed to the grid, which makes the system work rather like a PPA according to the disambiguation above, however, there is no need for a purchase agreement with a utility, but the feed-in tariff is state-administered, so the term "feed-in tariff" (German "Einspeisetarif") is usually used. Since around 2012, other types of contracts became more usual, because PPAs were supported and for small-scale solar projects, direct use of power became more attractive when the feed-in tariff became lower than prices for power bought.

On 1 August 2014, a revised Renewable Energy Sources Act entered into force.  Specific deployment corridors now stipulate the extent to which renewable energy is to be expanded in the future and the funding rates (feed-in tariffs) for new capacity will gradually no longer be set by the government, but will be determined by auction; starting with ground-mounted solar plant.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015-a"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  This represented a major change in policy and will be further extended as of 2017 with tender processes for onshore and offshore wind.

== Effects on electricity rates ==
FiTs have both increased and decreased electricity prices.&lt;ref name=PURC&gt;{{cite web|author=kstemper |url=http://regulationbodyofknowledge.org/renewable-energy-and-energy-efficiency/ |title=Frequently Asked Questions on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, Body of Knowledge on Infrastructure Regulation |publisher=Regulationbodyofknowledge.org |date=2013-05-04 |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increases in electricity rates occurred when the funding for the feed-in tariff scheme is provided by ratepayers via a surcharge in their electricity bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/defining-features-renewable-energy-act-eeg|title=Defining features of the Renewable Energy Act (EEG)|date=2014-10-08|work=Clean Energy Wire|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, this approach to funding the feed-in tariff added 6.88 cEUR per kWh to the electricity rate for residential consumers in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/germany-set-miss-climate-goals-think-tank/eeg-surcharge-2017&lt;/ref&gt; However, renewable energy can reduce spot market prices via the [[merit order|merit order effect]], the practice of using higher-cost fossil fuel facilities only when demand exceeds the capacity of lower cost facilities.&lt;ref name="Sensfuss, F. 2009"&gt;Sensfuss, F., Ragwitz, M., Genoese, M.

== Grid parity ==

Grid parity occurs when the cost of an alternative technology for electricity production matches the existing average for the area. Parity can vary both in time (i.e. during the course of the day and over the course of years) and in space (i.e. geographically). The price of electricity from the grid varies widely from high-cost areas such as Hawaii and California, to lower-cost areas such as Wyoming and Idaho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/fuelelectric.html |title=Electricity - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) |publisher=Eia.doe.gov |date=|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In areas with time-of-day pricing, rates vary over the course of the day, rising during high-demand hours (e.g. 11 AM–8 PM) and declining during low-demand hours.

In some areas wind power, [[landfill gas]] and biomass generation are already lower-cost than grid electricity. Parity has already been achieved in areas that use feed-in tariffs. For example, generation cost from landfill gas systems in Germany are currently{{when|date=September 2014}} lower than the average electricity spot market price.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erneuerbare-energien.de/files/pdfs/allgemein/application/pdf/eeg_verguetungsregelungen_en.pdf Grid parity in Germany]{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In remote areas, electricity from solar photovoltaics can be cheaper than building new distribution lines to connect to the transmission grid.

==Policy alternatives and complements==
[[Renewable Portfolio Standard]]s (RPS) and subsidies create protected markets for renewable energy. RPS require utilities to obtain a minimum percentage of their energy from renewable sources. In some states, utilities can purchase [[Renewable Energy Certificate (United States)|Renewable Energy Certificates]] (USA), [[Renewable Energy Certificate System]] (EU), [[Renewable Energy Certificates Registry]] (AUS) to meet this requirement. These certificates are issued to renewable energy producers based on the amount of energy they feed into the grid. Selling the certificates is another way for the renewable producer to supplement its revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Certificate prices fluctuate based on overall energy demand and competition among renewable producers. If the amount of renewable energy produced exceeds the required amount, certificate prices may crash, as happened with carbon trading in Europe. This can damage the economic viability of the renewable producers.&lt;ref&gt;Kildegaard, A. (2008). "Green Certificate Markets, the Risk of Over-Investment, and the Role of Longterm Contracts."

"Comparison of Feed-in Tariff, Quota and Auction Mechanisms to Support Wind Power Development." Renewable Energy 33; pp. 1854–1867.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quota systems favor large, vertically integrated generators and multinational electric utilities, if only because certificates are generally denominated in units of one megawatt-hour. They are also more difficult to design and implement than an FIT.&lt;ref name="wind-works.org"&gt;[http://www.wind-works.org/FeedLaws/RenewableEnergyPolicyMechanismsbyPaulGipe.pdf Renewable Energy Policy Mechanisms by Paul Gipe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510072741/http://www.wind-works.org/FeedLaws/RenewableEnergyPolicyMechanismsbyPaulGipe.pdf |date=10 May 2012 }}(1.3MB)&lt;br/&gt;Lauber, V.

To cover the additional costs of producing electricity from renewables and for the costs of diversification, producers of electricity from renewables receive a bonus for each kWh produced, marketed or consumed.{{clarify|date=July 2013}} For electricity generated from solar or radiant heat only, the bonus is 300% of the price per kWh of electricity produced by the market operator defined by Law 02-01 of 22 Dhu El Kaada 1422 corresponding to 5 February 2002 until the minimum contribution of solar energy represents 25% of all primary energy. For electricity generated from facilities using solar thermal systems solar-gas hybrid, the bonus is 200% of the price per kWh.

For contributions of solar energy below 25%, said bonus is paid in the following conditions:
{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Solar Share !! Bonus
|-
| &gt;25% || 200%
|-
| 20% to 25% || 180%
|-
| 15% to 20% || 160%
|-
| 10% to 15% || 140%
|-
| 5% to 10% || 100%
|-
| 0 to 5% || 0
|}

The price of electricity is fixed by the CREG (Gas and Electricity Regulatory Commission). According to the last decision which fixed it, the consumer pays his electricity as below:

* 1.77 DZD/kWh for a consumption which is lower than 41.6 kWh/month.
* 4.17 DZD/kWh for a consumption which is higher than 41.6 kWh/month.

The other consumers (industry, agriculture...etc.), they pay 4.17 DZD/kWh.

The feed-in tariff provides bonuses for electricity generated by cogeneration of 160%, taking into account thermal energy use of 20% of all primary energy used. The bonuses for solar generated electricity and cogeneration are cumulative. Remuneration of the generated electricity is guaranteed over the whole plant lifetime.

{{Main article|Feed-in tariffs in Australia}}
Feed-in tariffs were introduced in 2008 in [[South Australia]] and [[Queensland]], 2009 in the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and 2010 in [[New South Wales]], [[Tasmania]] and [[Western Australia]]. The [[Northern Territory]] offers only local feed-in tariff schemes. A uniform federal scheme to supersede all State schemes was proposed by Tasmanian Greens Senator [[Christine Milne]], but not enacted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/climatechange/governance/domestic/national/feed.htm Parliament of Australia: ''Feed-in tariffs''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526193031/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/climatechange/governance/domestic/national/feed.htm |date=26 May 2011 }}. Retrieved 20 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-2011, Feed-in tariff in NSW and ACT had been closed to new generators, as the installed capacity cap had been reached. In NSW, both the Feed-in tariff and the cap were cut, due to the overly generous original settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resourcesandenergy.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/360141/Solar-Bonus-Scheme-Review-Report.pdf |title=Report to NSW Minister for Energy: NSW Solar Bonus Scheme Statutory Review |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new conservative Victorian government replaced the original Feed-in tariff with a less generous transitional Feed-in tariff of 25 cents per kilowatt-hour for any power generated excess to the generator's usage, pending the outcome of an inquiry by the Victorian Competition and Efficiency Commission. This does not meet the normal definition and has been referred to as a "fake feed-in tariff". It is actually net metering with a payment for any kilowatt credit, instead of the normal roll over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metering.com/node/12433 |title=Solar feed-in tariff meets with mixed reviews |publisher=Metering.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528194314/http://www.metering.com/node/12433 |archivedate=28 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
As of August 2011 a national solar tariff was issued at about US$0.15 per kWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/cwire/2011/09/14/14climatewire-china-uses-feed-in-tariff-to-build-domestic-25559.html |title=China Uses Feed-In Tariff to Build Domestic Solar Market (by Coco Liu)| publisher=nytimes.com |date=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China set a tariff for new onshore wind power plants in a move to help struggling project operators to realise profits. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the country's economic planning agency, announced four categories of onshore wind projects, which according to region will be able to apply for the tariffs. Areas with better wind resources will have lower tariffs, while those with lower outputs will be able to access more generous tariffs.

The tariffs are set at 0.51 yuan (US 0.075, GBP 0.05), 0.54 yuan, 0.58 yuan and 0.61 yuan. These represent a significant premium on the average rate of 0.34 yuan per kilowatt-hour paid to coal-fired electricity generators.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130122035133/http://www.environmental-expert.com/resultEachPressRelease.aspx?cid=31242&amp;codi=59097&amp;lr=1] "China sets feed-in tariff for wind power plants ", BusinessGreen, 27 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Czech Republic===
[[Czech Republic]] introduced a tariff with law no. 180/2005 in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=RenewableEnergyWorld.com |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2005/05/czech-republic-passes-feed-in-tariff-law-30844 |title=Czech Republic Passes Feed-in Tariff Law |publisher=Renewableenergyworld.com |date=2005-05-25 |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tariff is guaranteed for 15–30 years (depending on source). Supported sources are small hydropower (up to 10 MW), biomass, biogas, wind and photovoltaics. {{As of|2010}} the highest tariff was 12.25 [[CZK]]/kWh for small photovoltaic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eru.cz/user_data/files/cenova%20rozhodnuti/CR%20elektro/OZ/ER%20CR%205_2009_slunce.pdf |title=Cenové rozhodnutí Energetického regulačního úřadu č. 5/2009 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718172214/http://www.eru.cz/user_data/files/cenova%20rozhodnuti/CR%20elektro/OZ/ER%20CR%205_2009_slunce.pdf |archivedate=18 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 over 1200 MW of photovoltaics were installed, but at the end of the year the FiT was eliminated for larger systems, and reduced by 50% for smaller systems. In 2011, no photovoltaic systems were installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pv-tech.org/tariff_watch/czech_republic |title=Czech Republic |publisher=Pv-tech.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===

On 20 September 2014, The Ministry of Electricity announced the new feed-in tariff (FIT) pricing for electricity generated from new and renewable energy sources for households and private sector companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2014/09/20/electricity-ministry-sets-new-energy-feed-tariffs/&lt;/ref&gt; The FIT will be applied in two phases, the official date for applying the first phase is 27 October 2014 and the second phase to be applied after two years from the first phase (which was launched on 28 October 2016).

The energy tariff during the first phase has been divided into five categories; The purchase price per kilowatt-hour (KWh) for residential solar generation is EGP 0.848. For non-residential installations of less than 200 kilowatts of installed generation capacity, the price rises to 0.901 EGP/KWh. The third category, between 200 and 500 kilowatts, will be paid 0.973 EGP/KWh. The fourth and fifth categories of non-residential installations are paid in USD, to attract foreign investments, with the fourth category, ranging from 500 kilowatts to 20 megawatts, paid 0.136 USD/KWh (with 15% of tariff pegged at the exchange rate of 7.15 EGP per USD). The last category, which stretches between 20-50MW, will be paid 0.1434 USD/KWh. On the other hand, the purchase price for power generated from wind is based on the number of operating hours and is more elaborate than the solar tariff. It covers operating hours ranging from 2500 up through 4000 hours, with decreasing purchase rates ranging from 0.1148 USD/KWh down to 0.046 USD/KWh.

In the second phase, the categories of solar generation were reduced to four, with the residential category tariff increased to 1.0288 EGP/KWh. The second category, non-residential installations of less than 500 KW has a purchase price of 1.0858 EGP/KWh. The third and fourth categories, non-residential installations between 500 KW and 20 MW and between 20 MW and 50 MW, have a purchase tariff of 0.0788 USD/KWh and 0.084 USD/KWh, respectively (with 30% of tariff pegged at the exchange rate of 8.88 EGP per USD).&lt;ref&gt;http://shahidlaw.com/2016/09/06/egyptian-feed-in-tariff-programme-update-on-06-september-2016/&lt;/ref&gt;

The government will purchase the electricity generated by investors, taking inflation into account, while consumption will be paid in local currency and depreciation rates reviewed after two years. The Ministry of Finance will provide concessional subsidized bank financing for households and institutions using less than 200 KW at a rate of 4%, and 8% for 200-500KW. The government is preparing a law that would allow for state-owned lands to be made available for new energy production projects under a usufruct system in exchange for 2% of the energy produced. The electricity companies will be obligated to purchase and transport the energy.  The new tariff system also includes a reduction in customs on new and renewable energy production supplies by 2% while the proportion of bank financing has been set at 40-60%.
The government hopes for new and renewable energy to account for 20% Egypt’s total energy mix by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moee.gov.eg/english_new/EEHC_Rep/2011-2012.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060855/http://www.moee.gov.eg/english_new/EEHC_Rep/2011-2012.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union ===

The [[European Union]] does not operate or necessarily encourage feed-in tariff schemes, this being a matter for member countries.

However feed-in tariff schemes in Europe have been challenged under European law for constituting illegal [[state aid]].  [[PreussenElektra]] brought a case concerning the German Electricity Feed-in Act (''Stromeinspeisungsgesetz'').  In 2001, the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) ruled that the German arrangements did not constitute state aid.&lt;ref name="german-energy-blog-1"&gt;

 | website = German Energy Blog

 | access-date = 2016-06-27
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The court concluded that:

{{quote|Statutory provisions of a Member State which, first, require private electricity supply undertakings to purchase electricity produced in their area of supply from renewable energy sources at minimum prices higher than the real economic value of that type of electricity, and, second, distribute the financial burden resulting from that obligation between those electricity supply undertakings and upstream private electricity network operators do not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 92(1) of the EC Treaty.|European Court of Justice, Luxembourg, 13 March 2001&lt;ref name="preussenelektra-case-2001"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29–30}}}}

The proposed [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership]] (TTIP) [[trade agreement]] now threatens to overturn feed-in tariff schemes throughout the Europe Union.  The draft energy chapter of the TTIP, leaked to The Guardian in July 2016, mandates that operators of energy networks grant access to gas and electricity "on commercial terms that are reasonable, transparent and non-discriminatory, including as between types of energy".&lt;ref name="neslen-2016"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  This would open feed-in tariff schemes to commercial challenge, including [[German Renewable Energy Sources Act|that]] used by Germany.  The [[The Greens (Luxembourg)|Green]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Claude Turmes]] stated: "These [TTIP] proposals are completely unacceptable. They would sabotage EU legislators' ability to privilege renewables and energy efficiency over unsustainable fossil fuels. This is an attempt to undermine democracy in Europe."&lt;ref name="neslen-2016"/&gt;

===France===
The administrative procedure for ground-mounted PV systems was significantly modified in late 2009. The distinction between segments was essentially based on capacity, which determines the complexity of the administrative process. A call for tenders for PV projects above 250&amp;nbsp;kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; was launched on 15 September 2011. The projects were to be analysed on multiple criteria, including the tariff rate requested by the applicant.

First introduced in 2000, the [[German Renewable Energy Sources Act|Renewable Energy Sources Act]] ({{lang-de|Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz}}) is reviewed on a regular basis.  Its predecessor was the 1991 ''Stromeinspeisegesetz''.  As of May 2008, the cost of the program added about €1.01 (USD1.69) to each monthly residential electric bill.&lt;ref&gt;

Tariff rates for PV electricity vary depending on system size and location.  In 2009, tariffs were raised for electricity immediately consumed rather than supplied to the grid with increasing returns if more than 30% of overall production is consumed on-site.  This is to incentivise demand-side management and help develop solutions to the intermittency of solar power.&lt;ref&gt;

Tariff duration is usually 20 calendar years plus the year of installation.  Systems receive the tariff in effect at the time of installation for the entire period.

The feed-in tariff, in force since 1 August 2004, was modified in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;

In view of the unexpectedly high growth rates, the depreciation was accelerated and a new category (&gt;1000&amp;nbsp;kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) was created with a lower tariff.  The facade premium was abolished.  In July 2010, the Renewable Energy Sources Act was again amended to reduce the tariffs by a further 16% in addition to the normal annual depreciation, as the prices for PV panels had dropped sharply in 2009.  The contract duration is 20 years.

===India===
India inaugurated its latest solar power program to date on 9 January 2010. The [[Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission]] (JNNSM) was officially announced by Prime Minister of India on 12 January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/01/12/stories/2010011260911100.htm |title=Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission inauguration |publisher=Hindu.com |date=2010-01-12 |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program aimed to install 20 GW of solar power by 2022. The first phase of this program targeted 1000 MW, by paying a tariff fixed by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission [[Central Electricity Regulatory Commission|(CERC)]] of India. While in spirit this is a feed in tariff, several conditions affect project size and commissioning date. The tariff for solar PV projects is fixed at Rs. 17.90 (USD 0.397)/kWh. Tariff for solar thermal projects is fixed Rs. 15.40 (USD 0.342/kWh). Tariff will be reviewed periodically by the CERC. In 2015, the feed in tariff is about Rs. 7.50 (USD 0.125)/kWh and is mostly applicable at utility level. The feed-in tariff for roof top PV plants is still not applicable..

===Indonesia===
The Indonesian government, operating mainly through the [[Perusahaan Listrik Negara|State Electricity Corporation]] (''Perusahaan Listrik Negara, or PLN''), encouraged independent power producers (IPPs) to invest in the electric power sector.  Numerous IPPs are investing in large plants (over 500 MW) and many smaller plants (such as 200 MW and smaller). To support this investment, power purchase agreement (PPA) arrangements are agreed with the PLN.  Prices vary widely from relatively low prices for large coal-based plants such as the [[Cirebon Steam Power Plant|Cirebon coal plant]] which began operations in late 2012 to higher prices for smaller geothermal plants producing more expensive power from distant locations such as the [[Wayang Windu Geothermal Power Station|Wayang Windu]] geothermal plant in [[West Java]]. Indonesia has made a range of different FIT Regulations for different forms of renewable electricity generation, for example geothermal energy and solar photovoltaic electricity generation. These regulations mandate the price that should be paid by PLN to the IPP in various different circumstances, provided that preconditions are met.

===Iran===
The Renewable Energy Organization of Iran (SUNA; [[سانا]]) first introduced a feed-in tariff in 2008. A purchase price of 1300 [[Iranian Rial|Rial]]s/kWh (900 Rial/kWh for 4 night-time hours) was set for electricity from all types of renewable resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wind-works.org/cms/index.php?id=283&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=694&amp;cHash=9198fae89553cb783f64a3d52d71a48e |title=Basic Feed-In Tariff in Iran}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the Ministry of Energy introduced new feed-in tariffs, which was set at 4442 [[Iranian Rial|Rial]]s/kWh (0.15 USD). The government-set conditions are getting better and there are high feed-in tariffs [FiTs]. FiTs were recently raised and are now set at a reasonable US$0.18 per kWh for wind. The FiTs for solar panels (below 10 MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) has been decreased by 27% from 4/2016. It is now 4900 Rls/kWh= $0.14/kWh. In 2016, Governments modified the tariff&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://privatesectors.suna.org.ir/fa/statesments|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005065036/http://privatesectors.suna.org.ir/fa/statesments|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-10-05|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and differentiate tariff for each type of renewable technology.

REFIT III supports the medium and large scale production of Electricity from bioenergy sources such as Biomass, Biomass CHP and Anaerobic Digestion CHP. The REFIT scheme is administered by the Department of Communications Energy and Natural Resources (DCENR). The scheme was put in place following extensive lobbying by industrial representative bodies such as the Irish BioEnergy Association and the Micro Energy Generation Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/NR/rdonlyres/3B13ECAA-9351-41E0-8B44-7C02E98E4F50/0/AdditionalREFITcetegories.pdf |title=Irish REFIT categories |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720000848/http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/NR/rdonlyres/3B13ECAA-9351-41E0-8B44-7C02E98E4F50/0/AdditionalREFITcetegories.pdf |archivedate=20 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residential and Micro scale Solar, Wind, Hydro and CHP receives no grant aid, no subsidy and no tax deductions are available. No Feed-In tariffs are available for these customers and net-metering is similarly unavailable. Co-operative and privately shared electricity between separate properties is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seai.ie/Renewables/Microgeneration/Microgeneration_FAQ/#exported&lt;/ref&gt; A 9c/kWh Feed-In tariff was available from [[Electric Ireland]] until December 2014, when it was withdrawn without replacement. Income from this feed-in tariff was subject to income tax at up to 58%. No other Micro-scale Feed-In tariffs are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/esb-ends-scheme-for-homeowners-who-want-to-sell-power-30706655.html|title=ESB ends scheme for homeowners who want to sell power - Independent.ie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 June 2008, the Israeli Public Utility Authority approved a ''feed-in tariff'' for solar plants. The [[tariff]] is limited to a total installation of 50MW during 7 years, whichever is reached first, with a maximum of 15&amp;nbsp;kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; installation for [[residential]] and a maximum of 50&amp;nbsp;kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; for [[commerce|commercial]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eng.shirasol.co.il/Approved-Feed-in-tariff-in-Israel.htm Approved – Feed-in tariff in Israel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603195611/http://eng.shirasol.co.il/Approved-Feed-in-tariff-in-Israel.htm |date= 3 June 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bank Hapoalim]] offered 10 year loans for the installation of solar panels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://new.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000357924&amp;fid=942 Hapoalim offers loans for domestic solar panels], 3 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Infrastructures Ministry announced that it would expand the ''feed-in tariff'' scheme to include medium-sized solar-power stations ranging from 50 [[Kilowatts#Kilowatt|kilowatts]] to 5 [[megawatt]]s. The new [[tariff]] scheme caused solar company [[Sunday Solar Energy]] to announce that it would invest $133&amp;nbsp;million to install [[photovoltaic solar arrays]] on [[kibbutzim]], which are social communities that divide revenues amongst their members.&lt;ref name=Sunday&gt;[http://www.cleantech.com/news/3715/sunday-solar-powers-kibbutzim Sunday Solar powers Israeli kibbutzim] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224192937/http://www.cleantech.com/news/3715/sunday-solar-powers-kibbutzim |date=24 December 2008 }}, Cleantech.com news, 17 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy introduced a feed-in tariff in February 2007. By 2011 Italy installed 7128 MW,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gse.it/it/Conto%20Energia/Risultati%20incentivazione/Pages/default.aspx |title=Risultati incentivazione |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420164407/http://www.gse.it/it/Conto%20Energia/Risultati%20incentivazione/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=20 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; behind only Germany (7500 MW),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sela-photovoltaik.de/neuer-rekordzubau-von-photovoltaik-anlagen-im-jahr-2011/ Germany 2011 FiT Results] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224081923/http://www.sela-photovoltaik.de/neuer-rekordzubau-von-photovoltaik-anlagen-im-jahr-2011/ |date=24 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and reduced the FiT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2010/06/italy-surpasses-us-in-solar-pv|title=Italy Surpasses US in Solar PV|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To secure the second round price of 37.8 yen/kWh for a 20-year PPA term, foreign investors must complete the following actions by 31 March 2014:
# (1) acquire firm rights to a project site (by either purchasing land, entering into a lease or obtaining a firm written commitment from a landowner to make a project site available);
# (2) submit an application for consultation and grid connection to the electricity utility that will purchase power from the relevant renewable energy project (i.e. the utility that operates in the geographical area in which the project is based); and
# (3) obtain approval for their generation facility from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry ("METI") under Article 6 of the Renewable Energy Law.

Projects that complete the above steps by 31 March 2014 will be eligible to enter into a 20-year PPA with the relevant electricity utility at a price of 37.8 yen/kWh for 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bakermckenzie.co.jp/e/material/dl/supportingyourbusiness/newsletter/emi/ClientAlert_EMI_131009_JapaneseSolarProjects.pdf]&lt;br/&gt;[http://www.bakermckenzie.co.jp/e/material/dl/supportingyourbusiness/newsletter/emi/ClientAlert_EMI_131009_JapaneseSolarProjects.pdf Japanese Solar Projects – a new deadline to develop approved projects?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Netherlands===
The Dutch Cabinet agreed on 27 March 2009 to implement some parts of a feed-in tariff in response to the global financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnvhb.nl/fileadmin/bestanden/hbbcnv/overige_pdf/09_03_26_crisispakket_kabinet.pdf |title=Crisispakket Kabinet (Dutch) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305183540/http://www.cnvhb.nl/fileadmin/bestanden/hbbcnv/overige_pdf/09_03_26_crisispakket_kabinet.pdf |archivedate= 5 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed regulation may adjust the quota incentive system.
As of the summer of 2009, The Netherlands operated a subsidy system. The subsidy budget has a quota for diverse types of energy, at several tens of million euros. The wind budget for wind was hardly used, because the tariffs are too low. The 2009 budget for Wind on Land was 900 MW (incl unused 400 MW from 2008); only 2.5 MW was used. Dutch utilities have no obligation to buy energy from windparks. The tariffs change annually. This created uncertain investment conditions.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The subsidy system was introduced in 2008. The previous 2003 subsidy scheme ''Ministeriële regeling milieukwaliteit elektriciteitsproductie'' (Ministerial regulation for environmental electricity production) which was funded by charging 100 euro per household annually on top of energy taxes stopped in 2006 because it was seen as too expensive.&lt;ref&gt;((Dutch))[http://www.milieuloket.nl/9353000/1/j9vvhurbs7rzkq9/vh0dksj6t6ry 12-5-2005 Subsidie windmolenparken op zee aan eigen succes tenonder]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Dutch wind parks were still being built with grants from the old scheme. The old and new subsidy scheme was funded from the general budget.

A feed-in tariff was briefly adopted in 2011, but ended a month later, in February.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

=== Portugal ===
Under the Portuguese energy policy, feed-in tariffs are offered to renewable sources (except large hydro) as well as micro distributed generation (e.g. solar PV, wind), waste and co-generation, and CHP generation from renewable and non-renewable sources, with the oldest tariffs dating back to 1998.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amorim|first=F.|last2=Vasconcelos|first2=J.|last3=Abreu|first3=I.

===The Philippines===
Under the [[Renewable Energy Act of 2008]], the Philippine [[Energy Regulatory Commission]] can "(guarantee) fixed rate per kilowatt-hour – the FIT rates – for power producers harnessing renewable energy under the FIT system."&lt;ref name=InqFeb2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rivera|first1=Danessa O.|title=ERC clears EDC wind farm for FIT incentives|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/441491/economy/companies/erc-clears-edc-wind-farm-for-fit-incentives|accessdate=20 February 2015|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2015, the ERC agreed to give a FIT rate of P8.69 per kilowatt hour for 20 years to the [[Burgos Wind Farm]] of the [[Energy Development Corporation]].&lt;ref name=InqFeb2015 /&gt;

===South Africa===
South Africa's National Energy Regulator (NERSA) announced 31 March 2009 a system of feed-in tariffs designed to produce 10 tw-h of electricity per year by 2013. The tariffs were substantially higher than those in NERSA's original proposal. The tariffs, differentiated by technology, were to be paid for 20 years.

NERSA said in its release that the tariffs were based on the cost of generation plus a reasonable profit. The tariffs for wind energy and concentrating solar power were among the most attractive worldwide.

The tariff for wind energy, 1.25 ZAR/kWh (€0.104/kWh) was greater than that offered in Germany and more than proposed in Ontario, Canada.

The tariff for concentrating solar, 2.10 ZAR/kWh, was less than that in Spain. NERSA's revised program followed extensive public consultation.

Stefan Gsänger, Secretary General of the World Wind Energy Association said, "South Africa is the first African country to introduce a feed-in tariff for wind energy. Many small and big investors will now be able to contribute to the take-off of the wind industry in the country. Such decentralised investment will enable South Africa to overcome its current energy crisis. It will also help many South African communities to invest in wind farms and generate electricity, new jobs and new income. We are especially pleased as this decision comes shortly after the first North American feed-in law has been proposed by the Government of the Canadian Province of Ontario".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/04/south-africa-introduces-aggressive-feed-in-tariffs] "South Africa Introduces Aggressive Feed-in Tariffs", Paul Gipe, Contributing Writer, 10 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the tariff was abandoned before it began in favor of a competitive bidding process launched on 3 August 2011. Under this bidding process, the South African government planned to procure 3,750MW of renewable energy: 1,850MW of onshore wind, 1,450MW of solar PV, 200MW of CSP, 75MW of small hydro, 25MW of landfill gas, 12.5MW of biogas, 12.5MW of biomass and 100MW of small projects. The bidding process comprised two steps:
* Qualification phase. Projects are assessed based on structure of the project, legal, land acquisition and use, financial, environmental consent, technical, economic development and bid guarantee
* Evaluation phase. Compliant bids are then evaluated based on: (1) price relative to a ceiling provided in bid documentation, accounting for 70% of the decision, and (2) economic development, accounting for 30% of the decision.

The first round of bids was due on 4 November 2011. PPA's were expected to be in place by June 2012. Projects should be commissioned by June 2014, except CSP projects expected by June 2015.

===Spain===
Spanish feed-in legislation was set by Royal decree 1578/2008 (''Real Decreto 1578/2008''), for photovoltaic installations, and Royal decree 661/2007 for other renewable technologies injecting electricity to the public grid. Originally under the 661/2007, photovoltaic tariffs were developed under a separate law due to its rapid growth.

The decree 1578/2008 categorized installations in two main groups with differentiated tariffs:
# Building Integrated installations; with 34c€/kWh in systems up to 20&amp;nbsp;kW of nominal power, and for systems above 20&amp;nbsp;kW with a limit of nominal power of 2MW tariff of 31c€/kWh
# Non integrated installations; 32c€/kWh for systems up to 10MW of nominal power.

For other technologies decree 661/2007 setd up:

===Switzerland===
Switzerland introduced the so-called "Cost-covering remuneration for feed-in to the electricity grid (CRF)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfe.admin.ch/themen/00612/02073/index.html?lang=en |title=Swiss Federal Office of Energy SFOE - Feed-in remuneration at cost |publisher=Bfe.admin.ch |date=|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 1 May 2008.

CRF applies to hydropower (up to 10 megawatts), photovoltaics, wind energy, geothermal energy, biomass and waste material from biomass and will be applicable for 20 and 25 years, depending on the technology. The implementation is done through the national grid operator SWISSGRID.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissgrid.ch/services/renewable_energies/index.html SwissGrid] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930102253/http://www.swissgrid.ch/services/renewable_energies/index.html |date=30 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While high by appearance, CRF has had little effect, as the total amount of "extra" cost to the system was capped. Since about 2009, no more projects could be financed. About 15'000 projects awaited allocation of monies. If all those projects were implemented, Switzerland could mothball all its nuclear power plants, which currently supply 40% of its power.

In 2011, after Fukushima, some local power companies, mostly owned by villages and cantons/provinces, selectively started offering their own tariff, thereby creating a mini-boom.

As of March 2012 the KEV-FIT for Solar PV had been lowered several times to CHF 0.30-0.40/kWh (USD 0.33-0.44/kWh) depending on size, but was higher than in Germany and most of the rest of the world.

===Taiwan===
The feed-in tariff for renewable energy generation in Taiwan is set by the [[Bureau of Energy]]. It applies to most of the renewable energy sources, namely solar, wind, hydraulic, geothermal, biomass, waste etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20161005PD200.html|title=Login to DIGITIMES archive &amp; research|first=|last=DIGITIMES|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thailand===
In 2006, the Thai government enacted a tariff paid on top of utility avoided costs, differentiated by technology type and generator size and guaranteed for 7–10 years. Solar received the highest amount, 8 baht/kWh (about US cents 27/kWh). Large biomass projects received the lowest at 0.3 baht/kWh (at about 1 US cent per kWh). Additional per-kWh subsidies were provided for projects that offset diesel use in remote areas.&lt;ref&gt;Amranand, P. (2008) Alternative energy, cogeneration and distributed generation: crucial strategy for sustainability of Thailand's energy sector.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010 March 1364 MW of private sector renewable energy was online with an additional 4104 MW in the pipeline with signed PPAs. Biomass made up the bulk of this capacity: 1292 MW (online) and 2119 MW (PPA only). Solar electricity was second but growing more rapidly, with 78 MW online and signed PPAs for an additional 1759 MW.&lt;ref&gt;EPPO (2010).

===Ukraine===
Ukraine introduced the law 'On feed-in tariff' on 25 September 2008. The law guaranteed grid access for renewable energy producers (small hydro up to 10 MW, wind, biomass, photovoltaic and geothermal). The tariffs for renewable power producers are set by the national regulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nerc.gov.ua/ |title=Ukraine regulator |publisher=Nerc.gov.ua |date=2013-11-27 |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|February 2013}} the following tariffs per kWh were applied: biomass – UAH 1.3446 (EUR 0.13), wind – UAH 1.2277 (EUR 0.12), small hydro – UAH 0.8418 (EUR 0.08), solar - UAH 5.0509 (EUR 0.48). In case of significant fluctuations of the national currency against Euro the feed-in tariff adjusts.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|Feed-in tariffs in the United Kingdom}}
In October 2008 the United Kingdom announced that Britain would implement a scheme by 2010, in addition to its current renewable energy quota scheme ([[Renewable Obligation Certificates|ROCS]]). In July 2009 Britain's then-Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, [[Ed Miliband]], presented details of the scheme, which began in early April 2010.&lt;ref name="renewableenergyworld.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=RenewableEnergyWorld.com |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/07/britain-to-launch-innovative-feed-in-tariff-program-in-2010 |title=Gipe, P, Britain to Launch Innovative Feed-in Tariff Program in 2010 |publisher=Renewableenergyworld.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than a year into the scheme, in March 2011 the new [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition government]] announced that support for large-scale [[photovoltaic]] installations (greater than 50&amp;nbsp;kW) would be cut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenbang.com/feed-in-tariff-cut-shocks-uk-pv-market_17123.html Feed-in tariff cut shocks UK PV market] ''greenbang.com'', published 2011-03-18.

The fast track review was based on the long term plan to reach an annual installation of 1.9GW in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Department of Energy &amp;amp; Climate Change |url=http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/pn11_47/pn11_47.aspx |title=Renewables study published by DECC website |publisher=Decc.gov.uk |date=2011-06-10 |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011 DECC announced dramatic cuts of around 55% to tariff rates, with additional reductions for community or group schemes. The cuts were to be effective from 12 December 2011, with a consultation exercise to end on 23 December 2011. This was successfully challenged in the high court by an application for judicial review, jointly made by environmental pressure group [[Friends of the Earth]] (FoE) and two solar companies - [[Solarcentury]] and HomeSun. The judgment, made by Mr Justice Mitting after a two-day court hearing, was hailed as a major victory by green campaigners and the solar industry. Lawyers for the Department of Energy and Climate Change immediately moved to appeal the ruling. The appeal was unanimously rejected by the Supreme Court, allowing anyone who installed their systems before 3 March 2012 to receive the higher rate of 43.3 p/kWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=RenewableEnergyWorld.com |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2012/03/uk-fit-adjustments-back-on-track-after-supreme-court-rejection |title=UK FiT Adjustments Back On Track After Supreme Court Rejection |publisher=Renewableenergyworld.com |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 30.7 p/kWh rate was available for solar systems up to 5 MW, and consequently no larger systems were built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitariffs.co.uk/eligible/levels/history/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704194833/http://www.fitariffs.co.uk/eligible/levels/history/ |archivedate= 4 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Feed-In-Tariff Payments are Tax-Free in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="H2-ecO"&gt;{{cite web|title=H2-ecO|url=http://www.h2-eco.co.uk|website=H2-ecO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 2012, 263,274 systems, totaling 1,152.835 MW, were receiving FiT payments. Of these, 260,041 were solar photovoltaic, totaling 1,057.344 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitariffs.co.uk/statistics/ |title=What has been registered for FiTs? |publisher=Fitariffs.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Payments are for 25 years. A typical photovoltaic system costing £7,500 pays for itself in 7 years 8 months, and generates £23,610 over 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discoversolar.co.uk/ |title=Solar Panel Systems |publisher=Discoversolar.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Further information|Renewable energy in the United States}}

In April 2009, 11 [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] were considering adopting a FiT as a complement to their renewable electricity mandates.&lt;ref name="Transatlantic Climate Policy Group"/&gt;

====California====
The [[California Public Utilities Commission]] (CPUC) approved a feed-in tariff on 31 January 2008 effective immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/word_pdf/NEWS_RELEASE/78824.pdf |title=CPUC tariff announcement |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Marin Energy Authority launched the first Community Choice Aggregate Feed-in Tariff program. The program was updated in November 2012, and now offers 20-year fixed-price contracts, with prices varying by energy source (peak, base-load, intermittent) and progress towards the current program cap of 10-MW.

Municipal utility companies enacted feed in tariff pilot programs in Palo Alto and Los Angeles:
Palo Alto CLEAN (Clean Local Energy Accessible Now) is a program to purchase up to 4MW of electricity generated by solar electric systems located in CPAU's service territory. In 2012 the minimum project size was 100&amp;nbsp;kW. Rates of purchase are between 12.360 ¢/kWh to 14.003 ¢/kWh depending on the length of the contract. The City began accepting applications on 2 April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/news/displaynews.asp?NewsID=1877&amp;targetid=223 |title=City of Palo Alto Website - Palo Alto CLEAN |publisher=Cityofpaloalto.org |date=|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 April 2012, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power's Board of Water and Power Commissioners approved a 10MW FiT Demonstration Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ladwp.com/ladwp/faces/ladwp/partners/p-gogreen/p-gg-localrenewableenergyprogram |title=Solar Feed-in Tariff (FiT) Program |publisher=Ladwp.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1 January 2010 state laws allowed homeowners to sell excess power to the utility. Previously the homeowner would get no credit for over-production over the course of the year. In order to get the [[California Solar Initiative]] (CSI) rebate the customer was not allowed to install a system that deliberately over-produces thereby, encouraging efficiency measures to be installed after solar installation. This over-production credit was not available to certain municipal utility customers namely Los Angeles Water and Power.

====Florida====
In February 2009, city commissioners in [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]], Florida, approved the nation's first solar feed-in tariff.&lt;ref name="Transatlantic Climate Policy Group"/&gt; The program was capped at 4 MW per year. As of 2011, Gainesville had increased solar generated electricity from 328&amp;nbsp;kW to 7,391&amp;nbsp;kW, approximately 1.2% of peak load energy (610&amp;nbsp;MW).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clean-coalition.org/storage/references/Letter%20from%20CLEAN%20Gainesville%20administrator%20John%20Crider%205%20Jul%202011.pdf Implementing the Gainesville Feed-In Tariff] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426000640/http://www.clean-coalition.org/storage/references/Letter%20from%20CLEAN%20Gainesville%20administrator%20John%20Crider%205%20Jul%202011.pdf |date=26 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was suspended in 2014 after more than 18 MW of capacity had been installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20140426/ARTICLES/140429694|title=As feed-in tariff takes a backseat, solar industry adjusts|first=Anthony Clark Business|last=editor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hawaii====
In September 2009 the [[Hawaii Public Utilities Commission]] required [[Hawaiian Electric Company]] (HECO &amp; MECO &amp; HELCO) to pay above-market prices for renewable energy fed into the electric grid. The policy offers projects a set price and standard 20-year contract. The PUC planned to review the initial feed-in tariff two years after the program started and every three years thereafter.

Project size was limited to five megawatts (MW) for the island of {{okina}}[[Oahu]] and 2.72 MW for [[Maui]] and [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]] island. The Commission's decision capped the total amount of feed-in tariff projects brought onto the electricity grid at 5% of the system peak on Oahu, Maui, and Hawaii Island for the first two years. Tier 3 was still pending a Decision and Order based on the findings of the Reliability Standards Working Group (a "docket within the docket").

Tier 2 and 3 project size caps varied by island and by technology. Tier 2 includes larger systems that are less than or equal to: 100&amp;nbsp;kW-AC for on-shore wind and in-line hydropower on all islands; 100&amp;nbsp;kW-AC for PV and CSP on Lanai and Molokai; 250&amp;nbsp;kW-AC for PV on Maui and Hawaii; 500&amp;nbsp;kW-AC for CSP on Maui and Hawaii; and 500&amp;nbsp;kW-AC for PV and CSP on Oahu. Tier 3 covers systems larger than the Tier 2 caps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsireusa.org/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=OR134F&amp;re=1&amp;ee=1 Hawaii Rates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104060604/http://www.dsireusa.org/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=OR134F&amp;re=1&amp;ee=1 |date= 4 November 2013 }}&lt;br/&gt;[http://www.hawaiirenewable.com/business-resources/policy/ Hawaii Policy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211183517/http://www.hawaiirenewable.com/business-resources/policy/ |date=11 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Maine====
In 2009 a "Feed-In" Tariff bill failed to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://janus.state.me.us/legis/LawMakerWeb/summary.asp?LD=1450&amp;SessionID=8 |title=Summary |publisher=Janus.state.me.us |date=|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.midcoastgreencollaborative.org/Feed_in_tariff_info.html Feed-in Tariff Legislation/Midcoast Green Collaborative] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404040718/http://www.midcoastgreencollaborative.org/Feed_in_tariff_info.html |date=4 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2009 a pilot program was initiated however, and was available for projects up to 10MW in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsireusa.org/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=ME13F&amp;re=1&amp;ee=0 |title=Maine Community Based Renewable Energy Production Incentive (Pilot Program) |publisher=Dsireusa.org |date= |accessdate=23 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508142101/http://dsireusa.org/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=ME13F&amp;re=1&amp;ee=0 |archivedate= 8 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 April 2013, the Maine Utility and Energy Committee was to consider a new bill: LD1085 "An Act to Establish the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/display_ps.asp?paper=SP0367&amp;PID=1456&amp;snum=126 |title=An Act to Establish the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff |date=|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New York====
The [[Long Island Power Authority]] (LIPA) adopted a feed-in tariff on 16 July 2012, for systems from 50&amp;nbsp;kW (AC) to 20 MW (AC), and was limited to 50 MW (AC). As customers cannot use their own electricity, it is actually a 20-year fixed rate power purchase agreement and LIPA retains the SRECs. The 2012 NY legislature failed to pass legislation which would have opened a New York market for SRECs starting in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srectrade.com/blog/srec-markets/ny-srec-market-put-on-hold |title=NY SREC market put on hold |publisher=Srectrade.com |date=2011-06-28 |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Payment is 22.5¢/kWh,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=NY107F&amp;re=1&amp;ee=1 Long Island Feed-in Tariff] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020004027/http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=NY107F&amp;re=1&amp;ee=1 |date=20 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; less than what LIPA paid for peak generation at various times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyiso.com/public/markets_operations/market_data/graphs/index.jsp |title=NYISO |publisher=NYISO |date= |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an estimated avoided cost of $0.075/kWh, the program added about $0.44/month to the average household electric bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lipower.org/pdfs/company/tariff/proposal_feedin.pdf |title=Feed in Tariff Proposal |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oregon====
In June 2009, Oregon established a pilot solar volumetric incentive rate and payment program. Under this incentive program, systems are paid for the kilowatt-hours (kWh) generated over a 15-year period, at a rate set at the time a system is enrolled in the program. The Oregon Public Utility Commission (PUC) established rates and rules in May 2010. This program was offered by the three investor-owned utilities in Oregon and administered by the utilities. The PUC planned to periodically re-evaluate rates. Program costs were recoverable in utility rates and utility-owned systems were not eligible for the incentive.

The pilot program installation cap was limited to an aggregate cap of 25 megawatts (MW) of solar photovoltaics (PV), with a maximum system size cap of 500 kilowatts (kW). The aggregate program cap was to be spread equally over four years, with 6.25 MW of capacity being eligible to receive the incentive each year. The aggregate cap was divided, based on 2008 retail sales revenue. PGE had a cap of 14.9 MW, Pacific Power 9.8 MW, and Idaho Power 0.4 MW. Idaho Power's program was limited to residential installations. Rates differed by system size and geographic zone. Small- and medium-scale systems participated in a program modeled after net metering. Larger-scale systems were competitively bid. Participating PV systems must be grid-connected, metered and meet all applicable codes and regulations. Systems must be "permanently installed".

Systems sized 100&amp;nbsp;kW or less could participate based on net metering. Generating capacity of 20 MW of the aggregate cap was reserved for the net metering portion, with 12 MW available for residential and 8 MW available for small commercial systems. These residential and small commercial systems were paid for the amount of electricity generated, up to the amount of electricity consumed. In essence, customers were paid for the amount of utility electric load consumption that is offset by onsite generation. Unlike typical feed-in tariffs, customers can consume the electricity generated on-site and receive a production incentive – or a volumetric incentive payment – for the amount of electricity generated and consumed. To remove a [[perverse incentive]] to increase electricity consumption to receive a greater payment, the system had to be appropriately sized to meet average electricity consumption. Rates were determined by the PUC based on annual system cost and annual energy output, differentiated by geographic zones. The cost estimates were based on installation data from [[Energy Trust of Oregon]]. The actual rates paid to the customer-generator were the volumetric incentive rate minus the retail rate. The volumetric incentive rates were to be re-evaluated every six months. The rates for the performance-based incentive program ranged from $0.25/kWh to $0.411/kWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsireusa.org/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=OR134F&amp;re=1&amp;ee=1 |title=Oregon |publisher=Dsireusa.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104060604/http://www.dsireusa.org/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=OR134F&amp;re=1&amp;ee=1 |archivedate= 4 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vermont====
Vermont adopted feed-in tariffs on 27 May 2009 as part of the Vermont Energy Act of 2009. Generators must possess a capacity of no more than 2.2 MW, and participation is limited to 50 MW in 2012, a limit that increased by 5 to 10 MW/year to a total of 127.5 MW in 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c2es.org/node/6558 |title=Vermont Implements Feed-in Tariff &amp;#124; Center for Climate and Energy Solutions |publisher=C2es.org |date=27 May 2009 |accessdate=23 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223234510/http://www.c2es.org/node/6558 |archivedate=23 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Payments were 24¢/kWh for solar, which was increased to 27.1¢/kWh in March 2012, and 11.8¢/kWh for wind over 100&amp;nbsp;kW and 25.3¢/kWh for wind turbines up to 100&amp;nbsp;kW.

===Puerto Rico===

The territory operated a net metering program that paid the energy fed back to the grid at the retail rate. The rate varied monthly around 23 cents per kilowatt. The program credited the provider's account each month rather than making actual payments. At the end of the fiscal year (June) any excess was paid at a fixed 10 cents per KW of which 25% was retained for public schools. To participate in the program insurance and means for disconnecting the system accessible outside of the building and specific brands of equipment dictated by the government were required.{{refimprove section|ate=August 2013|date=August 2013}}

[[File:Concorde on Bristol.jpg|thumb|[[Concorde]] in its final flight. The extremely high fineness ratio of the fuselage is evident.]]
[[File:Questair Venture.jpg|thumb|right|[[Questair Venture]], with an egg-shaped, very-low-fineness-ratio fuselage]]

In [[naval architecture]] and [[aerospace engineering]], the '''fineness ratio''' is the ratio of the length of a body to its maximum width. Shapes that are short and wide have a low fineness ratio, those that are long and narrow have high fineness ratios. Aircraft that spend time at [[supersonic]] speeds, e.g. the [[Concorde]], generally have high fineness ratios.

At speeds below [[critical mach]], one of the primary forms of drag is [[skin friction]]. As the name implies, this is drag caused by the interaction of the airflow with the aircraft's skin.  To minimize this drag, the aircraft should be designed to minimize the exposed skin area, or "wetted surface". One solution to this problem is constructing an "egg shaped" fuselage, for example as used on the home-built [[Questair Venture]].

Theoretical ideal fineness ratios in subsonic aircraft are typically found at about 6:1, however this may be compromised by other design considerations such as seating or freight size requirements. Because a higher fineness fuselage can have reduced tail surfaces, this ideal ratio can practically be increased to 8:1.&lt;ref name="GBooksf"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=_FBLtC3qpr4C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=fineness+ratio&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=fineness%20ratio&amp;f=false|title = Airplane Design, Part 3|accessdate = 14 June 2016|last = Roskam|first = Jan|year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most aircraft have fineness ratios significantly greater than this, however. This is often due to the competing need to place the tail control surfaces at the end of a longer [[moment arm]] to increase their effectiveness. Reducing the length of the fuselage would require larger controls, which would offset the drag savings from using the ideal fineness ratio. An example of a high-performance design with an imperfect fineness ratio is the [[Lancair]]. In other cases, the designer is forced to use a non-ideal design due to outside factors such as seating arrangements or cargo pallet sizes. Modern [[airliner]]s often have fineness ratios much higher than ideal, a side effect of their cylindrical cross-section which is selected for strength, as well as providing a single width to simplify seating layout.

As an aircraft approaches the [[speed of sound]], [[shock wave]]s form on areas of greater curvature. These shock waves radiate away energy that the engines must supply, energy that does not go into making the aircraft go faster. This appears to be a new form of drag—referred to as [[wave drag]]—which peaks at about three times the drag at speeds even slightly below the [[critical mach]]. In order to minimize the wave drag, the curvature of the aircraft should be kept to a minimum, which implies much higher fineness ratios. This is why high-speed aircraft have long pointed noses and tails, and cockpit canopies that are flush to the fuselage line.

More technically, the best possible performance for a supersonic design is typified by two "perfect shapes", the [[Sears-Haack body]] which is pointed at both ends, or the [[von Kármán ogive]], which has a blunt tail. Examples of the latter design include the [[Concorde]], [[F-104 Starfighter]] and [[XB-70 Valkyrie]], although to some degree practically every post-World War II [[interceptor aircraft]] featured such a design. Missile designers are even less interested in low-speed performance, and missiles generally have higher fineness ratios than most aircraft.

The introduction of aircraft with higher fineness ratios also introduced a new form of instability, [[inertial coupling]]. As the engines and cockpit moved away from the aircraft's [[center of mass]], the roll inertia of these masses grew to be able to overwhelm the power of the aerodynamic surfaces. A variety of methods are used to combat this effect, including oversized controls and [[stability augmentation system]]s.

'''Finnish Nature Heritage Foundation''' is a foundation founded in 1995 by Finnish ecological activist [[Pentti Linkola]]. It has founded to preserve the remaining [[old-growth forest]]s. The foundation gets donations from private individuals and companies, and then buys the forest areas seemed unique enough to deserve the protection. The protection of forests is double guaranteed - the forests are protected by Finnish nature protection laws, but also by being legally in ownership of Finnish Nature Heritage Foundation.

[[File:Yaw Axis Corrected.svg|right|325px]]

'''Flight dynamics''' is the science of [[aircraft|air]] vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. The three critical flight dynamics parameters are the [[angles of rotation]] in three [[dimensions]] about the vehicle's  [[center of mass]], known as ''pitch'', ''roll'' and ''yaw''.

[[Aerospace engineer]]s develop [[control system]]s for a vehicle's orientation (attitude) about its [[center of mass]]. The control systems include actuators, which exert forces in various directions, and generate rotational forces or [[moment (physics)|moment]]s about the [[aerodynamic center]] of the aircraft, and thus rotate the aircraft in pitch, roll, or yaw.  For example, a [[pitching moment]] is a vertical force applied at a distance forward or aft from the aerodynamic center of the [[aircraft]], causing the aircraft to pitch up or down.

Roll, pitch and yaw refer to rotations about the respective axes starting from a defined [[steady flight]] equilibrium state.  The equilibrium roll angle is known as wings level or zero bank angle, equivalent to a level [[Heeling (sailing)|heeling]] angle on a ship. Yaw is known as "heading".  The equilibrium [[pitch angle (engineering)|pitch angle]] in submarine and airship parlance is known as "trim", but in aircraft, "trim" usually refers to the equilibrium [[angle of attack]], rather than orientation.  However, common usage ignores this distinction between equilibrium and dynamic cases.

The most common aeronautical convention defines the roll as acting about the longitudinal axis, positive with the starboard (right) wing down.  The yaw is about the vertical body axis, positive with the nose to starboard. Pitch is about an axis perpendicular to the longitudinal plane of symmetry, positive nose up.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

A [[fixed-wing aircraft]] increases or decreases the lift generated by the wings when it pitches nose up or down by increasing or decreasing the [[angle of attack]] (AOA). The roll angle is also known as bank angle on a fixed-wing aircraft, which usually "banks" to change the horizontal direction of flight. An aircraft is usually streamlined from nose to tail to reduce [[Drag (physics)|drag]] making it typically advantageous to keep the sideslip angle near zero, though there are instances when an aircraft may be deliberately "sideslipped" for example a [[Slip (aerodynamic)|slip]] in a fixed-wing aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

== Introduction ==

=== Reference frames ===
{{main|axes conventions}}
Three [[Right-hand rule|right-handed]], [[Cartesian coordinate systems]] see frequent use in flight dynamics. The first coordinate system has an origin fixed in the reference frame of the Earth:
*Earth frame
** Origin - arbitrary, fixed relative to the surface of the Earth
** ''x&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis - positive in the direction of [[north]]
** ''y&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis - positive in the direction of [[east]]
** ''z&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis - positive towards the center of the Earth
In many flight dynamics applications, the Earth frame is assumed to be inertial with a flat ''x&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'',''y&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;''-plane, though the Earth frame can also be considered a [[spherical coordinate system]] with origin at the center of the Earth.

The other two reference frames are body-fixed, with origins moving along with the aircraft, typically at the center of gravity. For an aircraft that is symmetric from right-to-left, the frames can be defined as:
*Body frame
** Origin - airplane center of gravity
** ''x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis - positive out the nose of the aircraft in the plane of symmetry of the aircraft
** ''z&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis - perpendicular to the ''x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis, in the plane of symmetry of the aircraft, positive below the aircraft
** ''y&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis - perpendicular to the ''x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'',''z&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''-plane, positive determined by the [[right-hand rule]] (generally, positive out the right wing)
*Wind frame
** Origin - airplane center of gravity
** ''x&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis - positive in the direction of the velocity vector of the aircraft relative to the air
** ''z&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis - perpendicular to the ''x&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis, in the plane of symmetry of the aircraft, positive below the aircraft
** ''y&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis - perpendicular to the ''x&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'',''z&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''-plane, positive determined by the right hand rule (generally, positive to the right)

Asymmetric aircraft have analogous body-fixed frames, but different conventions must be used to choose the precise directions of the ''x'' and ''z'' axes.

The Earth frame is a convenient frame to express aircraft translational and rotational kinematics. The Earth frame is also useful in that, under certain assumptions, it can be approximated as inertial. Additionally, one force acting on the aircraft, weight, is fixed in the +''z&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' direction.

The body frame is often of interest because the origin and the axes remain fixed relative to the aircraft. This means that the relative orientation of the Earth and body frames describes the aircraft attitude. Also, the direction of the force of thrust is generally fixed in the body frame, though some aircraft can vary this direction, for example by [[thrust vectoring]].

The wind frame is a convenient frame to express the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on an aircraft. In particular, the net [[aerodynamic force]] can be divided into components along the wind frame axes, with the [[Aerodynamic drag|drag force]] in the −''x&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' direction and the [[Lift (force)|lift force]] in the −''z&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' direction.

In addition to defining the reference frames, the relative orientation of the reference frames can be determined. The relative orientation can be expressed in a variety of forms, including:
* [[rotation matrix|Direction cosine or rotation matrices]]
* [[Euler angles]]
* [[Quaternion]]s
The various Euler angles relating the three reference frames are important to flight dynamics. Many Euler angle conventions exist, but all of the rotation sequences presented below use the ''z-y'-x"'' convention. This convention corresponds to a type of [[Euler angles#Tait–Bryan angles|Tait-Bryan angles]], which are commonly referred to as Euler angles. This convention is described in detail below for the roll, pitch, and yaw Euler angles that describe the body frame orientation relative to the Earth frame. The other sets of Euler angles are described below by analogy.

To transform from the Earth frame to the body frame using Euler angles, the following rotations are done in the order prescribed. First, rotate the Earth frame axes ''x&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''y&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' around the ''z&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis by the yaw angle ''ψ''. This results in an intermediate reference frame with axes denoted ''x{{'}}'',y{{'}}'',z{{'}}'', where ''z'=z&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;''. Second, rotate the ''x{{'}}'' and ''z{{'}}'' axes around the ''y{{'}}'' axis by the pitch angle ''θ''. This results in another intermediate reference frame with axes denoted ''x",y",z"'', where ''y"=y{{'}}''. Finally, rotate the ''y"'' and ''z"'' axes around the ''x"'' axis by the roll angle ''φ''. The reference frame that results after the three rotations is the body frame.

Based on the rotations and axes conventions above, the yaw angle ''ψ'' is the angle between north and the projection of the aircraft longitudinal axis onto the horizontal plane, the pitch angle ''θ'' is the angle between the aircraft longitudinal axis and horizontal, and the roll angle ''φ'' represents a rotation around the aircraft longitudinal axis after rotating by yaw and pitch.

To transform from the Earth frame to the wind frame, the three Euler angles are the bank angle ''μ'', the flight path angle ''γ'', and the heading angle ''σ''. When performing the rotations described above to obtain the wind frame from the Earth frame, (''μ'',''γ'',''σ'') are analogous to (''φ'',''θ'',''ψ''), respectively. The heading angle ''σ'' is the angle between north and the horizontal component of the velocity vector, which describes which direction the aircraft is moving relative to cardinal directions. The flight path angle ''γ'' is the angle between horizontal and the velocity vector, which describes whether the aircraft is climbing or descending. The bank angle ''μ'' represents a rotation of the lift force around the velocity vector, which may indicate whether the airplane is [[Banked turn#Banked turn in aeronautics|turning]].

To transform from the wind frame to the body frame, the two Euler angles are the [[angle of attack]] ''α'' and the [[Slip (aerodynamic)|sideslip angle]] ''β''. When performing the rotations described earlier to obtain the body frame from the wind frame, (''α'',''β'') are analogous to (''θ'',''ψ''), respectively; the angle analogous to ''φ'' in this transformation is always zero. The sideslip angle ''β'' is the angle between the velocity vector and the projection of the aircraft longitudinal axis onto the ''x&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'',''y&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''-plane, which describes whether there is a lateral component to the aircraft velocity, also known as sideslip.  The angle of attack ''α'' is the angle between the ''x&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'',''y&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''-plane and the aircraft longitudinal axis and, among other things, is an important variable in determining the magnitude of the force of lift.

===Design cases===
In analyzing the stability of an aircraft, it is usual to consider perturbations about a nominal [[steady flight]] state. So the analysis would be applied, for example, assuming:
::Straight and level flight
::Turn at constant speed
::Approach and landing
::[[Takeoff]]

The speed, height and trim angle of attack are different for each flight condition, in addition, the aircraft will be configured differently, e.g. at low speed [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] may be deployed and the [[Landing gear|undercarriage]] may be down.

Except for [[asymmetric designs]] (or [[symmetric designs]] at significant sideslip), the longitudinal equations of motion (involving pitch and lift forces) may be treated independently of the lateral motion (involving roll and yaw).

The following considers perturbations about a nominal straight and level flight path.

To keep the analysis (relatively) simple, the control surfaces are assumed fixed throughout the motion, this is stick-fixed stability. Stick-free analysis requires the further complication of taking the motion of the control surfaces into account.

Furthermore, the flight is assumed to take place in still air, and the aircraft is treated as a [[rigid body]].

== Forces of flight ==

Three forces act on an aircraft in flight: [[weight]], [[thrust]], and the [[aerodynamic force]].

=== Aerodynamic force ===

{{main|Aerodynamic force}}

==== Components of the aerodynamic force ====

The expression to calculate the aerodynamic force is:

::&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_A = \int_\Sigma (-\Delta p \mathbf{n} + \mathbf{f}) \,d\sigma  &lt;/math&gt;

where:
::&lt;math&gt; \Delta p \equiv &lt;/math&gt; Difference between static pressure and free current pressure
::&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{n} \equiv &lt;/math&gt; outer normal vector of the element of area
::&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{f} \equiv &lt;/math&gt; tangential stress vector practised by the air on the body
::&lt;math&gt; \Sigma \equiv &lt;/math&gt; adequate reference surface

projected on wind axes we obtain:

::&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_A = -(\mathbf{i}_w D + \mathbf{j}_w Q + \mathbf{k}_w L) &lt;/math&gt;

where:
::&lt;math&gt; D \equiv &lt;/math&gt; Drag
::&lt;math&gt; Q \equiv &lt;/math&gt; Lateral force
::&lt;math&gt; L \equiv &lt;/math&gt; Lift

==== Aerodynamic coefficients ====

[[Dynamic pressure]] of the free current &lt;math&gt; \equiv q = \tfrac12\, \rho\, V^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Proper reference [[flight control surface|surface]] ([[wing]] surface, in case of [[airplane|plane]]s) &lt;math&gt; \equiv S &lt;/math&gt;

[[Pressure coefficient]] &lt;math&gt; \equiv C_p = \dfrac{p-p_\infty}{q}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Friction coefficient]] &lt;math&gt; \equiv C_f = \dfrac{f}{q}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Drag coefficient]] &lt;math&gt; \equiv C_d = \dfrac{D}{qS} = - \dfrac{1}{S} \int_\Sigma [ (-C_p) \mathbf{n} \bullet \mathbf{i_w} + C_f \mathbf{t} \bullet \mathbf{i_w}] \,d\sigma &lt;/math&gt;

Lateral force coefficient &lt;math&gt; \equiv C_Q = \dfrac{Q}{qS} = - \dfrac{1}{S} \int_\Sigma [ (-C_p) \mathbf{n} \bullet \mathbf{j_w} + C_f \mathbf{t} \bullet \mathbf{j_w}] \,d\sigma &lt;/math&gt;

[[Lift coefficient]] &lt;math&gt; \equiv C_L = \dfrac{L}{qS} = - \dfrac{1}{S} \int_\Sigma [ (-C_p) \mathbf{n} \bullet \mathbf{k_w} + C_f \mathbf{t} \bullet \mathbf{k_w}] \,d\sigma &lt;/math&gt;

It is necessary to know C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; in every point on the considered surface.

==== Dimensionless parameters and aerodynamic regimes ====

In absence of thermal effects, there are three remarkable dimensionless numbers:

* Compressibility of the flow:
:[[Mach number]] &lt;math&gt; \equiv M = \dfrac{V}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
* Viscosity of the flow:
:[[Reynolds number]] &lt;math&gt; \equiv Re = \dfrac{\rho V l}{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;
* Rarefaction of the flow:
:[[Knudsen number]] &lt;math&gt; \equiv Kn = \dfrac{\lambda}{l}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

::&lt;math&gt; a = \sqrt{k R \theta} \equiv &lt;/math&gt; speed of [[sound]]
:::&lt;math&gt; R\equiv &lt;/math&gt; [[gas constant]] by mass unity
:::&lt;math&gt; \theta \equiv &lt;/math&gt; absolute [[temperature]]
::&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \dfrac{\mu}{\rho} \sqrt{\dfrac{\pi}{2 R \theta}} = \dfrac{M}{Re} \sqrt{\dfrac{k \pi}{2}} \equiv &lt;/math&gt; [[mean free path]]

According to λ there are three possible rarefaction grades and their corresponding motions are called:
* Continuum current (negligible rarefaction): &lt;math&gt; \dfrac{M}{Re} \ll 1&lt;/math&gt;
* Transition current (moderate rarefaction): &lt;math&gt; \dfrac{M}{Re} \approx 1&lt;/math&gt;
* Free molecular current (high rarefaction): &lt;math&gt; \dfrac{M}{Re} \gg 1&lt;/math&gt;

The motion of a body through a flow is considered, in flight dynamics, as continuum current. In the outer layer of the space that surrounds the body [[viscosity]] will be negligible. However viscosity effects will have to be considered when analysing the flow in the nearness of the [[boundary layer]].

Depending on the compressibility of the flow, different kinds of currents can be considered:
* [[Incompressible flow|Incompressible subsonic current]]: &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt; M &lt;  0.3 &lt;/math&gt;
* [[Compressible flow|Compressible subsonic current]]: &lt;math&gt; 0.3 &lt; M &lt;  0.8 &lt;/math&gt;
* [[Transonic|Transonic current]]: &lt;math&gt; 0.8 &lt; M &lt;  1.2 &lt;/math&gt;
* [[Supersonic|Supersonic current]]: &lt;math&gt; 1.2 &lt; M &lt;  5 &lt;/math&gt;
* [[Hypersonic|Hypersonic current]]: &lt;math&gt; 5 &lt; M &lt;/math&gt;

==== Drag coefficient equation and aerodynamic efficiency ====

If the geometry of the body is fixed and in case of symmetric flight (β=0 and Q=0), pressure and friction coefficients are functions depending on:
::&lt;math&gt; C_p = C_p ( \alpha , M , Re , P) &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; C_f = C_f ( \alpha , M , Re , P) &lt;/math&gt;
where:
::&lt;math&gt; \alpha \equiv  &lt;/math&gt; [[angle of attack]]
::&lt;math&gt; P \equiv  &lt;/math&gt; considered point of the surface

Under these conditions, [[Drag coefficient|drag]] and [[lift coefficient]] are functions depending exclusively on the [[angle of attack]] of the body and [[Mach number|Mach]] and [[Reynolds number]]s. Aerodynamic efficiency, defined as the relation between lift and drag coefficients, will depend on those parameters as well.

::&lt;math&gt; \begin{cases}
C_D = C_D ( \alpha , M , Re) \\
C_L = C_L ( \alpha , M , Re) \\
E = E ( \alpha , M , Re) = \dfrac{C_L}{C_D} \\
\end{cases}
 &lt;/math&gt;

It is also possible to get the dependency of the [[drag coefficient]] respect to the [[lift coefficient]]. This relation is known as the drag coefficient equation:
::&lt;math&gt; C_D = C_D ( C_L , M , Re ) \equiv &lt;/math&gt; drag coefficient equation
The aerodynamic efficiency has a maximum value, E&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, respect to C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; where the tangent line from the coordinate origin touches the drag coefficient equation plot.

The drag coefficient, C&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;, can be decomposed in two ways. First typical decomposition separates pressure and friction effects:
::&lt;math&gt; C_D = C_{Df} + C_{Dp} \begin{cases} C_{Df} = \dfrac{D}{qS} = - \dfrac{1}{S} \int_\Sigma C_f \mathbf{t} \bullet \mathbf{i_w} \,d\sigma \\ C_{Dp} = \dfrac{D}{qS} = - \dfrac{1}{S} \int_\Sigma (-C_p) \mathbf{n} \bullet \mathbf{i_w} \,d\sigma \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

There's a second typical decomposition taking into account the definition of the drag coefficient equation. This decomposition separates the effect of the [[lift coefficient]] in the equation, obtaining two terms C&lt;sub&gt;D0&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;Di&lt;/sub&gt;. C&lt;sub&gt;D0&lt;/sub&gt; is known as the parasitic drag coefficient and it is the base draft coefficient at zero lift. C&lt;sub&gt;Di&lt;/sub&gt; is known as the induced drag coefficient and it is produced by the body lift.
::&lt;math&gt; C_D = C_{D0} + C_{Di} \begin{cases} C_{D0} = (C_D)_{C_L = 0} \\ C_{Di} \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

==== Parabolic and generic drag coefficient ====

A good attempt for the induced drag coefficient is to assume a parabolic dependency of the lift

:&lt;math&gt; C_{Di} = k C_L^2 \Rightarrow C_D = C_{D0} + k C_L^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Aerodynamic efficiency is now calculated as:

:&lt;math&gt; E = \dfrac{C_L}{C_{D0} + k C_L^2} \Rightarrow \begin{cases} E_{max} = \dfrac{1}{2 \sqrt{k C_{D0}}} \\ (C_L)_{Emax} = \sqrt{ \dfrac{C_{D0}}{k} } \\ (C_{Di})_{Emax} = C_{D0} \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

If the configuration of the plane is symmetrical respect to the XY plane, minimum drag coefficient equals to the parasitic drag of the plane.

:&lt;math&gt; C_{Dmin} = (C_D)_{CL=0} = C_{D0} &lt;/math&gt;

In case the configuration is asymmetrical respect to the XY plane, however, minimum flag differs from the parasitic drag. On these cases, a new approximate parabolic drag equation can be traced leaving the minimum drag value at zero lift value.

:&lt;math&gt; C_{Dmin} = C_{DM} \neq (C_D)_{CL=0} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; C_D = C_{DM} + k (C_L - C_{LM})^2 &lt;/math&gt;

==== Variation of parameters with the Mach number ====
The [[Coefficient of pressure]] varies with [[Mach number]] by the relation given below:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=John D.|title=Introduction to flight|year=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston [u.a.]|isbn=9780071238182|edition=5. ed., internat.|pages=274–275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;C_{p} = \frac {C_{p0}} {\sqrt {|1-{M_{\infty}}^2|}}&lt;/math&gt;
where
*  C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the compressible [[pressure coefficient]]
*  C&lt;sub&gt;p0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[incompressible]] [[pressure coefficient]]
*  ''M&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the freestream Mach number.
This relation is reasonably accurate for 0.3 &lt; M &lt; 0.7 and when ''M = 1'' it becomes ∞ which is impossible physical situation and is called [[Prandtl–Glauert singularity]].

===Directional stability===
{{main|Directional stability}}
Directional or weathercock stability is concerned with the [[static margin|static stability]] of the airplane about the z axis. Just as in the case of longitudinal stability it is desirable that the aircraft should tend to return to an equilibrium condition when subjected to some form of yawing disturbance. For this the slope of the yawing moment curve must be positive.
An airplane possessing this mode of stability will always point towards the relative wind, hence the name weathercock stability.

===Longitudinal modes===
It is common practice to derive a fourth order [[characteristic polynomial|characteristic equation]] to describe the longitudinal motion, and then factorize it approximately into a high frequency mode and a low frequency mode. The approach adopted here is using qualitative knowledge of aircraft behavior to simplify the equations from the outset, reaching the result by a more accessible route.

The two longitudinal motions (modes) are called the [[short period]] pitch oscillation (SPPO), and the [[phugoid]].

====Short-period pitch oscillation====

A short input (in [[control systems]] terminology an [[impulse (physics)|impulse]]) in pitch (generally via the elevator in a standard configuration fixed-wing aircraft) will generally lead to overshoots about the trimmed condition. The transition is characterized by a damped [[simple harmonic motion]] about the new trim. There is very little change in the trajectory over the time it takes for the oscillation to damp out.

Generally this oscillation is high frequency (hence short period) and is damped over a period of a few seconds. A real-world example would involve a pilot selecting a new climb attitude, for example 5° nose up from the original attitude. A short, sharp pull back on the control column may be used, and will generally lead to oscillations about the new trim condition. If the oscillations are poorly damped the aircraft will take a long period of time to settle at the new condition, potentially leading to [[Pilot-induced oscillation]]. If the short period mode is unstable it will generally be impossible for the pilot to safely control the aircraft for any period of time.

This [[Damping|damped]] [[Simple harmonic motion|harmonic motion]] is called the [[short period]] pitch oscillation, it arises from the tendency of a stable aircraft to point in the general direction of flight. It is very similar in nature to the [[weathercock]] mode of missile or rocket configurations. The motion involves mainly the pitch attitude &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; (theta) and incidence &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (alpha). The direction of the velocity vector, relative to inertial axes is &lt;math&gt;\theta-\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. The velocity vector is:
[[File:Longitudinal.svg]]

::&lt;math&gt;u_f=U\cos(\theta-\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;w_f=U\sin(\theta-\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u_f&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt; w_f&lt;/math&gt; are the inertial axes components of velocity. According to [[Newton's Second Law]], the [[acceleration]]s are proportional to the [[force]]s, so the forces in inertial axes are:

::&lt;math&gt;X_f=m\frac{du_f}{dt}=m\frac{dU}{dt}\cos(\theta-\alpha)-mU\frac{d(\theta-\alpha)}{dt}\sin(\theta-\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;Z_f=m\frac{dw_f}{dt}=m\frac{dU}{dt}\sin(\theta-\alpha)+mU\frac{d(\theta-\alpha)}{dt}\cos(\theta-\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the [[mass]].
By the nature of the motion, the speed variation &lt;math&gt;m\frac{dU}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; is negligible over the period of the oscillation, so:

::&lt;math&gt;X_f= -mU\frac{d(\theta-\alpha)}{dt}\sin(\theta-\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;Z_f=mU\frac{d(\theta-\alpha)}{dt}\cos(\theta-\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

But the forces are generated by the [[pressure]] distribution on the body, and are referred to the velocity vector. But the velocity (wind) axes set is not an [[inertial]] frame so we must resolve the fixed axes forces into wind axes.  Also, we are only concerned with the force along the z-axis:

::&lt;math&gt;Z=-Z_f\cos(\theta-\alpha)+X_f\sin(\theta-\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;
Or:
::&lt;math&gt;Z=-mU\frac{d(\theta-\alpha)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

In words, the wind axes force is equal to the [[centripetal]] acceleration.

The moment equation is the time derivative of the [[angular momentum]]:
::&lt;math&gt;M=B\frac{d^2 \theta}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where M is the pitching moment, and B is the [[moment of inertia]] about the pitch axis.
Let: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\theta}{dt}=q&lt;/math&gt;, the pitch rate.
The equations of motion, with all forces and moments referred to wind axes are, therefore:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\alpha}{dt}=q+\frac{Z}{mU}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dq}{dt}=\frac{M}{B}&lt;/math&gt;
We are only concerned with perturbations in forces and moments, due to perturbations in the states &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and q, and their time derivatives.  These are characterized by [[stability derivatives]] determined from the flight condition.  The possible stability derivatives are:

::&lt;math&gt;Z_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; Lift due to incidence, this is negative because the z-axis is downwards whilst positive incidence causes an upwards force.

::&lt;math&gt;Z_q&lt;/math&gt; Lift due to pitch rate, arises from the increase in tail incidence, hence is also negative, but small compared with &lt;math&gt;Z_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

::&lt;math&gt;M_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; [[Pitching moment]] due to incidence - the static stability term.  [[Longitudinal static stability|Static stability]] requires this to be negative.

::&lt;math&gt;M_q&lt;/math&gt;  Pitching moment due to pitch rate - the pitch damping term, this is always negative.

Since the tail is operating in the flowfield of the wing, changes in the wing incidence cause changes in the downwash, but there is a delay for the change in wing flowfield to affect the tail lift, this is represented as a moment proportional to the rate of change of incidence:

::&lt;math&gt;M_\dot\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

The delayed downwash effect gives the tail more lift and produces a nose down moment, so &lt;math&gt;M_\dot\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is expected to be negative.

The equations of motion, with small perturbation forces and moments become:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\alpha}{dt}=\left(1+\frac{Z_q}{mU}\right)q+\frac{Z_\alpha}{mU}\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dq}{dt}=\frac{M_q}{B}q+\frac{M_\alpha}{B}\alpha+\frac{M_\dot\alpha}{B}\dot\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

These may be manipulated to yield as second order linear [[differential equation]] in &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2\alpha}{dt^2}-\left(\frac{Z_\alpha}{mU}+\frac{M_q}{B}+(1+\frac{Z_q}{mU})\frac{M_\dot\alpha}{B}\right)\frac{d\alpha}{dt}+\left(\frac{Z_\alpha}{mU}\frac{M_q}{B}-\frac{M_\alpha}{B}(1+\frac{Z_q}{mU})\right)\alpha=0 &lt;/math&gt;

This represents a [[Damping|damped]] [[simple harmonic motion]].

We should expect &lt;math&gt;\frac{Z_q}{mU}&lt;/math&gt; to be small compared with unity, so the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (the 'stiffness' term) will be positive, provided &lt;math&gt;M_\alpha&lt;\frac{Z_\alpha}{mU}M_q&lt;/math&gt;. This expression is dominated by &lt;math&gt;M_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, which defines the [[longitudinal static stability]] of the aircraft, it must be negative for stability.  The damping term is reduced by the downwash effect, and it is difficult to design an aircraft with both rapid natural response and heavy damping. Usually, the response is underdamped but stable.

====Phugoid====
{{main|Phugoid}}

If the stick is held fixed, the aircraft will not maintain straight and level flight, but will start to dive, level out and climb again. It will repeat this cycle until the pilot intervenes. This long period oscillation in speed and height is called the [[phugoid]] mode. This is analyzed by assuming that the [[short period|SSPO]] performs its proper function and maintains the angle of attack near its nominal value. The two states which are mainly affected are the climb angle &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; (gamma) and speed. The small perturbation equations of motion are:

::&lt;math&gt;mU\frac{d\gamma}{dt}=-Z&lt;/math&gt;

which means the centripetal force is equal to the perturbation in lift force.

For the speed, resolving along the trajectory:

::&lt;math&gt;m\frac{du}{dt}=X-mg\gamma&lt;/math&gt;

where g is the [[standard gravity|acceleration due to gravity at the earths surface]]. The acceleration along the trajectory is equal to the net x-wise force minus the component of weight. We should not expect significant aerodynamic derivatives to depend on the climb angle, so only &lt;math&gt;X_u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z_u&lt;/math&gt; need be considered. &lt;math&gt;X_u&lt;/math&gt; is the drag increment with increased speed, it is negative, likewise &lt;math&gt;Z_u&lt;/math&gt; is the lift increment due to speed increment, it is also negative because lift acts in the opposite sense to the z-axis.

The equations of motion become:
::&lt;math&gt; mU\frac{d\gamma}{dt}=-Z_u u&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; m\frac{du}{dt}=X_u u -mg\gamma&lt;/math&gt;

These may be expressed as a second order equation in climb angle or speed perturbation:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2u}{dt^2}-\frac{X_u}{m}\frac{du}{dt}-\frac{Z_ug}{mU}u=0&lt;/math&gt;
Now lift is very nearly equal to weight:
::&lt;math&gt;Z=\frac{1}{2}\rho U^2 c_L S_w=W&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the air density, &lt;math&gt;S_w&lt;/math&gt; is the wing area, W the weight and &lt;math&gt;c_L&lt;/math&gt; is the lift coefficient (assumed constant because the incidence is constant), we have, approximately:

::&lt;math&gt;Z_u=\frac{2W}{U}=\frac{2mg}{U}&lt;/math&gt;

The period of the phugoid, T, is obtained from the coefficient of u:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{2\pi}{T}=\sqrt{\frac{2g^2}{U^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
Or:
::&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{2\pi U}{\sqrt{2}g}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the lift is very much greater than the drag, the phugoid is at best lightly damped. A [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] with fixed speed would help. Heavy damping of the pitch rotation or a large [[rotational inertia]] increase the coupling between short period and phugoid modes, so that these will modify the phugoid.

===Lateral modes===
With a symmetrical rocket or missile, the [[directional stability]] in yaw is the same as the pitch stability; it resembles the short period pitch oscillation, with yaw plane equivalents to the pitch plane stability derivatives.  For this reason, pitch and yaw directional stability are collectively known as the "weathercock" stability of the missile.

Aircraft lack the symmetry between pitch and yaw, so that directional stability in yaw is derived from a different set of stability derivatives. The yaw plane equivalent to the short period pitch oscillation, which describes yaw plane directional stability is called Dutch roll. Unlike pitch plane motions, the lateral modes involve both roll and yaw motion.

====Dutch roll====
{{main|Dutch roll}}
It is customary to derive the equations of motion by formal manipulation in what, to the engineer, amounts to a piece of mathematical sleight of hand. The current approach follows the pitch plane analysis in formulating the equations in terms of concepts which are reasonably familiar.

Applying an impulse via the rudder pedals should induce [[Dutch roll]], which is the oscillation in roll and yaw, with the roll motion lagging yaw by a quarter cycle, so that the wing tips follow elliptical paths with respect to the aircraft.

The yaw plane translational equation, as in the pitch plane, equates the centripetal acceleration to the side force.

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\beta}{dt}=\frac{Y}{mU}-r&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; (beta) is the [[sideslip angle]], Y the side force and r the yaw rate.

The moment equations are a bit trickier. The trim condition is with the aircraft at an angle of attack with respect to the airflow. The body x-axis does not align with the velocity vector, which is the reference direction for wind axes. In other words, wind axes are not [[Aircraft principal axes|principal axes]] (the mass is not distributed symmetrically about the yaw and roll axes). Consider the motion of an element of mass in position -z, x in the direction of the y-axis, i.e. into the plane of the paper.
[[File:Product of inertia.png|thumb]]

If the roll rate is p, the velocity of the particle is:

:::&lt;math&gt;v=-pz+xr&lt;/math&gt;

Made up of two terms, the force on this particle is first the proportional to rate of v change, the second is due to the change in direction of this component of velocity as the body moves. The latter terms gives rise to cross products of small quantities (pq, pr,qr), which are later discarded.  In this analysis, they are discarded from the outset for the sake of clarity. In effect, we assume that the direction of the velocity of the particle due to the simultaneous roll and yaw rates does not change significantly throughout the motion.  With this simplifying assumption, the acceleration of the particle becomes:

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dt}=-\frac{dp}{dt}z+\frac{dr}{dt}x&lt;/math&gt;

The yawing moment is given by:

:::&lt;math&gt;\delta m x \frac{dv}{dt}=-\frac{dp}{dt}xz\delta m + \frac{dr}{dt}x^2\delta m &lt;/math&gt;

There is an additional yawing moment due to the offset of the particle in the y direction:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dr}{dt}y^2\delta m&lt;/math&gt;

The yawing moment is found by summing over all particles of the body:

:::&lt;math&gt;N=-\frac{dp}{dt}\int xz dm +\frac{dr}{dt}\int x^2 + y^2 dm =-E\frac{dp}{dt}+C\frac{dr}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

where N is the yawing moment, E is a product of inertia, and C is the moment of inertia about the [[yaw axis]].
A similar reasoning yields the roll equation:

:::&lt;math&gt;L=A\frac{dp}{dt}-E\frac{dr}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

where L is the rolling moment and A the roll moment of inertia.

==== Lateral and longitudinal stability derivatives ====
The states are &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; (sideslip), r (yaw rate) and p (roll rate), with moments N (yaw) and L (roll), and force Y (sideways).  There are nine stability derivatives relevant to this motion, the following explains how they originate. However a better intuitive understanding is to be gained by simply playing with a model airplane, and considering how the forces on each component are affected by changes in sideslip and angular velocity:
[[File:LowWing.png]]

:::&lt;math&gt;Y_\beta&lt;/math&gt; Side force due to side slip (in absence of yaw).

Sideslip generates a sideforce from the fin and the fuselage.  In addition, if the wing has dihedral, side slip at a positive roll angle increases incidence on the starboard wing and reduces it on the port side, resulting in a net force component directly opposite to the sideslip direction.  Sweep back of the wings has the same effect on incidence, but since the wings are not inclined in the vertical plane, backsweep alone does not affect &lt;math&gt;Y_\beta&lt;/math&gt;.  However, anhedral may be used with high backsweep angles in high performance aircraft to offset the wing incidence effects of sideslip. Oddly enough this does not reverse the sign of the wing configuration's contribution to &lt;math&gt;Y_\beta&lt;/math&gt; (compared to the dihedral case).

:::&lt;math&gt;Y_p&lt;/math&gt; Side force due to roll rate.

Roll rate causes incidence at the fin, which generates a corresponding side force.  Also, positive roll (starboard wing down) increases the lift on the starboard wing and reduces it on the port. If the wing has dihedral, this will result in a side force momentarily opposing the resultant sideslip tendency. Anhedral wing and or stabilizer configurations can cause the sign of the side force to invert if the fin effect is swamped.

:::&lt;math&gt;Y_r&lt;/math&gt; Side force due to yaw rate.

Yawing generates side forces due to incidence at the rudder, fin and fuselage.

:::&lt;math&gt;N_\beta&lt;/math&gt; Yawing moment due to sideslip forces.

Sideslip in the absence of rudder input causes incidence on the fuselage and [[empennage]], thus creating a yawing moment counteracted only by the directional stiffness which would tend to point the aircraft's nose back into the wind in horizontal flight conditions. Under sideslip conditions at a given roll angle &lt;math&gt;N_\beta&lt;/math&gt; will tend to point the nose into the sideslip direction even without rudder input, causing a downward spiraling flight.

:::&lt;math&gt;N_p&lt;/math&gt; Yawing moment due to roll rate.

Roll rate generates fin lift causing a yawing moment and also differentially alters the lift on the wings, thus affecting the induced drag contribution of each wing, causing a (small) yawing moment contribution.  Positive roll generally causes positive &lt;math&gt;N_p&lt;/math&gt; values unless the [[empennage]] is anhedral or fin is below the roll axis. Lateral force components resulting from dihedral or anhedral wing lift differences has little effect on &lt;math&gt;N_p&lt;/math&gt; because the wing axis is normally closely aligned with the center of gravity.

:::&lt;math&gt;N_r&lt;/math&gt; Yawing moment due to yaw rate.

Yaw rate input at any roll angle generates rudder, fin and fuselage force vectors which dominate the resultant yawing moment. Yawing also increases the speed of the outboard wing whilst slowing down the inboard wing, with corresponding changes in drag causing a (small) opposing yaw moment. &lt;math&gt;N_r&lt;/math&gt; opposes the inherent directional stiffness which tends to point the aircraft's nose back into the wind and always matches the sign of the yaw rate input.

:::&lt;math&gt;L_\beta&lt;/math&gt; Rolling moment due to sideslip.

A positive sideslip angle generates empennage incidence which can cause positive or negative roll moment depending on its configuration.  For any non-zero sideslip angle dihedral wings causes a rolling moment which tends to return the aircraft to the horizontal, as does back swept wings.  With highly swept wings the resultant rolling moment may be excessive for all stability requirements and anhedral could be used to offset the effect of wing sweep induced rolling moment.
[[File:Planform.png]]

:::&lt;math&gt;L_r&lt;/math&gt; Rolling moment due to yaw rate.

Yaw increases the speed of the outboard wing whilst reducing speed of the inboard one, causing a rolling moment to the inboard side.  The contribution of the fin normally supports this inward rolling effect unless offset by anhedral stabilizer above the roll axis (or dihedral below the roll axis).

:::&lt;math&gt;L_p&lt;/math&gt; Rolling moment due to roll rate.

Roll creates counter rotational forces on both starboard and port wings whilst also generating such forces at the empennage. These opposing rolling moment effects have to be overcome by the aileron input in order to sustain the roll rate. If the roll is stopped at a non-zero roll angle the &lt;math&gt;L_\beta&lt;/math&gt; ''upward'' rolling moment induced by the ensuing sideslip should return the aircraft to the horizontal unless exceeded in turn by the ''downward'' &lt;math&gt;L_r&lt;/math&gt; rolling moment resulting from sideslip induced yaw rate. Longitudinal stability could be ensured or improved by minimizing the latter effect.

====Equations of motion====
Since [[Dutch roll]] is a handling mode, analogous to the short period pitch oscillation, any effect it might have on the trajectory may be ignored.  The body rate ''r'' is made up of the rate of change of sideslip angle and the rate of turn. Taking the latter as zero, assuming no effect on the trajectory, for the limited purpose of studying the Dutch roll:

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\beta}{dt}= -r&lt;/math&gt;

The yaw and roll equations, with the stability derivatives become:

::&lt;math&gt;C\frac{dr}{dt}-E\frac{dp}{dt}=N_\beta \beta - N_r \frac{d\beta}{dt} + N_p p&lt;/math&gt; (yaw)

::&lt;math&gt;A\frac{dp}{dt}-E\frac{dr}{dt}=L_\beta \beta - L_r \frac{d\beta}{dt} + L_p p&lt;/math&gt; (roll)

The inertial moment due to the roll acceleration is considered small compared with the aerodynamic terms, so the equations become:

::&lt;math&gt;-C\frac{d^2\beta}{dt^2} = N_\beta \beta - N_r \frac{d\beta}{dt} + N_p p&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;E\frac{d^2\beta}{dt^2} = L_\beta \beta - L_r \frac{d\beta}{dt} + L_p p&lt;/math&gt;

This becomes a second order equation governing either roll rate or sideslip:

::&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{N_p}{C}\frac{E}{A}-\frac{L_p}{A}\right)\frac{d^2\beta}{dt^2}+
\left(\frac{L_p}{A}\frac{N_r}{C}-\frac{N_p}{C}\frac{L_r}{A}\right)\frac{d\beta}{dt}-
\left(\frac{L_p}{A}\frac{N_\beta}{C}-\frac{L_\beta}{A}\frac{N_p}{C}\right)\beta = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The equation for roll rate is identical. But the roll angle, ''&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;'' (phi) is given by:

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\phi}{dt}=p&lt;/math&gt;

If ''p'' is a damped simple harmonic motion, so is ''&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;'', but the roll must be in [[Quadrature phase|quadrature]] with the roll rate, and hence also with the sideslip.  The motion consists of oscillations in roll and yaw, with the roll motion lagging 90 degrees behind the yaw.  The wing tips trace out elliptical paths.

Stability requires the "[[stiffness]]" and "damping" terms to be positive. These are:

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\frac{L_p}{A}\frac{N_r}{C}-\frac{N_p}{C}\frac{L_r}{A}}
{\frac{N_p}{C}\frac{E}{A}-\frac{L_p}{A}}&lt;/math&gt; (damping)

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\frac{L_\beta}{A}\frac{N_p}{C}-\frac{L_p}{A}\frac{N_\beta}{C}}
{\frac{N_p}{C}\frac{E}{A}-\frac{L_p}{A}}&lt;/math&gt;  (stiffness)

The denominator is dominated by &lt;math&gt;L_p&lt;/math&gt;, the roll damping derivative, which is always negative, so the denominators of these two expressions will be positive.

Considering the "stiffness" term: &lt;math&gt;-L_p N_\beta&lt;/math&gt; will be positive because &lt;math&gt;L_p&lt;/math&gt; is always negative and &lt;math&gt;N_\beta&lt;/math&gt; is positive by design.  &lt;math&gt;L_\beta&lt;/math&gt; is usually negative, whilst &lt;math&gt;N_p&lt;/math&gt; is positive.  Excessive dihedral can destabilize the Dutch roll, so configurations with highly swept wings require anhedral to offset the wing sweep contribution to &lt;math&gt;L_\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

The damping term is dominated by the product of the roll damping and the yaw damping derivatives, these are both negative, so their product is positive.  The Dutch roll should therefore be damped.

The motion is accompanied by slight lateral motion of the center of gravity and a more "exact" analysis will introduce terms in &lt;math&gt;Y_\beta&lt;/math&gt; etc. In view of the accuracy with which stability derivatives can be calculated, this is an unnecessary pedantry, which serves to obscure the relationship between aircraft geometry and handling, which is the fundamental objective of this article.

====Roll subsidence====
Jerking the stick sideways and returning it to center causes a net change in roll orientation.

The roll motion is characterized by an absence of natural stability, there are no stability derivatives which generate moments in response to the inertial roll angle. A roll disturbance induces a roll rate which is only canceled by pilot or [[autopilot]] intervention. This takes place with insignificant changes in sideslip or yaw rate, so the equation of motion reduces to:

::&lt;math&gt;A\frac{dp}{dt}=L_p p.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;L_p&lt;/math&gt; is negative, so the roll rate will decay with time. The roll rate reduces to zero, but there is no direct control over the roll angle.

====Spiral mode====
Simply holding the stick still, when starting with the wings near level, an aircraft will usually have a tendency to gradually veer off to one side of the straight flightpath.  This is the (slightly unstable)  '''spiral mode'''.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

=====Spiral mode trajectory=====
In studying the trajectory, it is the direction of the velocity vector, rather than that of the body, which is of interest.  The direction of the velocity vector when projected on to the horizontal will be called the track, denoted ''&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;'' ([[Mu (letter)|mu]]).  The body orientation is called the heading, denoted ''&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;'' (psi).  The force equation of motion includes a component of weight:{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mu}{dt}=\frac{Y}{mU} + \frac{g}{U}\phi&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g'' is the gravitational acceleration, and ''U'' is the speed.

Including the stability derivatives:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mu}{dt}=\frac{Y_\beta}{mU}\beta + \frac {Y_r}{mU}r + \frac{Y_p}{mU}p + \frac{g}{U}\phi&lt;/math&gt;

Roll rates and yaw rates are expected to be small, so the contributions of &lt;math&gt;Y_r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y_p&lt;/math&gt; will be ignored.

The sideslip and roll rate vary gradually, so their time [[derivative]]s are ignored. The yaw and roll equations reduce to:

::&lt;math&gt;N_\beta \beta + N_r\frac{d\mu}{dt} + N_p p = 0&lt;/math&gt;  (yaw)

::&lt;math&gt;L_\beta \beta + L_r\frac{d\mu}{dt} + L_p p = 0&lt;/math&gt; (roll)

Solving for ''&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;'' and ''p'':

:::&lt;math&gt;\beta=\frac{(L_r N_p - L_p N_r)}{(L_p N_\beta - N_p L_\beta)}\frac{d\mu}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;p=\frac{(L_\beta N_r - L_r N_\beta)}{(L_p N_\beta - N_p L_\beta)}\frac{d\mu}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting for sideslip and roll rate in the force equation results in a first order equation in roll angle:

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\phi}{dt}=mg\frac{(L_\beta N_r - N_\beta L_r)}{mU(L_p N_\beta - N_p L_\beta)-Y_\beta(L_r N_p - L_p N_r)}\phi&lt;/math&gt;

This is an [[Exponential growth|exponential]] growth or decay, depending on whether the coefficient of ''&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;'' is positive or negative.  The denominator is usually negative, which requires &lt;math&gt;L_\beta N_r &gt; N_\beta L_r&lt;/math&gt; (both products are positive).  This is in direct conflict with the Dutch roll stability requirement, and it is difficult to design an aircraft for which both the Dutch roll and spiral mode are inherently stable.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Since the [[spiral divergence|spiral mode]] has a long time constant, the pilot can intervene to effectively stabilize it, but an aircraft with an unstable Dutch roll would be difficult to fly.  It is usual to design the aircraft with a stable Dutch roll mode, but slightly unstable spiral mode.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

'''Ghislenghien''' ({{lang-nl|Gellingen}}) is a small town near [[Ath]] in [[Hainaut province]], part of the Francophone [[Walloon region]] of [[Belgium]]. It has about 3000 inhabitants.

==Gas explosion==
On July 30, 2004 a high-pressure natural gas [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] operated at a pressure of 70 bar ruptured following recent third party damage. Twenty-four people died as a result and 150 survivors were hospitalised, most with severe burns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Katastrophenalarm in Belgien: Drei Fabriken in Flammen – Viele Tote und Verletzte|trans-title=Catastrophe alarm in Belgium: Three factories in flames – Many deaths and injuries|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/katastrophenalarm-in-belgien-drei-fabriken-in-flammen-viele-tote-und-verletzte-a-310969.html|publisher=[[Spiegel Online]]|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that damage to the pipeline occurred during the final stages of a car park construction project. Notice of the work had been given to the pipeline operator, [[Fluxys]], and one of their operatives had regularly attended the site through the course of the project. Damage to the pipeline probably occurred as a mechanical soil stabiliser was driven over it or near by. This resulted in several evenly spaced (but not full depth) gouges in the steel wall of the pipeline. Two weeks after the completion of the car park gas pressure was increased in the pipeline, which then ruptured with the fault centred on a 350 mm long gouge. Other contributing factors to the accident may have been a reduced cover over the pipeline as a result of levelling, the way information was passed down the sub-contracting chain to workers and the frequency and adequacy of supervision by the pipeline operator at the site.

'''Glidcop''' is the registered [[trademark]] name of [[Höganäs AB|North American Höganäs]], that refers to a family of [[copper]]-based [[metal matrix composite]] (MMC) [[alloys]] mixed primarily with [[aluminum oxide]] [[ceramic]] particles. The addition of small amounts of aluminum oxide has minuscule effects on the performance of the copper at room temperature (such as a small decrease in thermal and electrical conductivity), but greatly increases the copper's resistance to thermal softening and enhances high elevated temperature strength. The addition of aluminum oxide also increases resistance to radiation damage. As such, the alloy has found use in applications where high [[thermal conductivity]] or electrical conductivity is required while also maintaining strength at elevated temperatures or radiation levels.&lt;ref name=scm/&gt;

== Properties ==

=== Composition and physical properties ===

Glidcop is available in several grades which have varying amounts of aluminum oxide content.

Additional materials and elements can be added if lower [[thermal expansion]] is required, or higher room temperature and elevated temperature strengths. The hardness can also be increased. A composite material of Glidcop&amp;nbsp;AL-60 and 10&amp;nbsp;% [[Niobium]] provides high strength and high conductivity. The hardness is comparable to many [[Beryllium copper|copper-beryllium]] and copper-[[tungsten]] alloys, while the electrical conductivity is comparable to [[Resistance Welding Manufacturing Alliance|RWMA]] Class&amp;nbsp;2 alloy. Other additives for specialized applications include [[molybdenum]], tungsten, [[Kovar]], and [[Alloy 42]].&lt;ref name=scm/&gt;

At elevated temperatures, Glidcop maintains its strength much better than oxygen-free copper. The aluminum oxide particles in the copper block [[Dislocation_creep#Dislocation_movement|dislocation movement]], which retards [[recrystallization (metallurgy)|recrystallization]] and prevents [[grain growth]]. At {{convert|500|C|F|adj=on}} Glidcop&amp;nbsp;AL-15 has a yield strength of over 29&amp;nbsp;[[kilopounds per square inch|ksi]] (200 MPa). Glidcop also has exceptional elevated temperature stress rupture strength when compared to oxygen-free copper.&lt;ref name=scm/&gt;

Glidcop also has excellent resistance to softening after exposure to elevated temperatures.&lt;ref name=scm/&gt;

=== Post-neutron-irradiation properties ===

Glidcop is resistant to degradation by [[neutron]] irradiation. For samples irradiated by neutrons at {{convert|411|C|F|adj=on}} and cooled to room temperature, the tensile strengths and electrical conductivity were greater than that of pure copper while the swelling was lower. For samples irradiated from 0 to 150&amp;nbsp;dpm (displacements per atom), the tensile strength was nearly consistent, while the pure copper experienced a linear decrease in tensile strength on the range from 0 to 50&amp;nbsp;dpm. For sample swelling, the Glidcop had no noticeable swelling to 150&amp;nbsp;dpm while the pure copper had a linear growth to approximately 50&amp;nbsp;dpm, where swelling was 30&amp;nbsp;% of the original. For electrical conductivity, both the pure copper and Glidcop experienced linear drops in performance, though the Glidcop was less affected by the radiation.&lt;ref name="scm"/&gt;

=== Workability ===

Glidcop material is often acquired with a layer of [[Cladding (metalworking)|cladding]], typically 10-15&amp;nbsp;% of the cross-sectional area of the stock piece, though this varies depending on the production process. The cladding, which is a remnant of the [[extrusion]] process often used with Glidcop, must be machined (usually by milling or grinding) off the stock piece in order to take full advantage of the Glidcop properties. After the cladding is removed, machining and working with Glidcop is similar to that of pure copper.&lt;ref name=swogger/&gt;

Joining Glidcop material through [[brazing]] can be somewhat difficult. Brazing with silver based braze alloys can lead to problems due to the excessive diffusion of silver along grain boundaries. This is often circumvented by first [[electroplating]] the Glidcop part with either copper or [[nickel]].&lt;ref name=samal/&gt; The copper plating is often done in a [[Copper(I) cyanide|copper cyanide]] solution since other solutions were found to be problematic. Brazing alloys used include 3565&amp;nbsp;AuCu and 5050&amp;nbsp;AuCu, which are used in a dry hydrogen atmosphere.&lt;ref name=slac/&gt;&lt;ref name=argonne/&gt;

Glidcop also has excellent [[Work hardening|cold workability]]. Cold working by [[Drawing (manufacturing)|drawing]], cold [[Heading (metalworking)|heading]], or [[cold forming]] increase strength while reducing [[ductility]].&lt;ref name="scm"/&gt;

== Applications ==

Glidcop has been successfully applied to [[resistance welding]] electrodes to reduce stick to [[Galvanization|galvanized]] and other coated steels, and in [[incandescent light bulb]] leads by resisting softening after exposure to high temperatures. Likewise, Glidcop has found used in [[relay]] blades and [[contactor]] supports. The alloy's ability to maintain strength after high temperature brazing has led to use in [[Hybrid integrated circuit|hybrid circuit]] packages. Furthermore, it has found use in other high temperature applications such as [[x-ray tube]] components, and [[heat exchanger]] sections for [[fusion power]] and [[synchrotron]] units. Other uses include high field [[Electromagnetic coil|magnetic coils]], sliding electrical contacts, [[Arc welding|arc welder]] electrodes, electronic leadframes, [[Gas metal arc welding|MIG]] contact tips, [[Commutator (electric)|commutators]], high speed motor and generator components, and microwave power tube components.&lt;ref name="scm"/&gt;

One of the more intensive uses of Glidcop has been in particle accelerator components, where the alloy may be subjected to high temperatures and high radiation simultaneously. Examples include Radio Frequency Quadrupoles (RFQs) and Compact Absorbers for High-Heat-Load X-ray Undulator Beamlines.&lt;ref name=ratti/&gt;&lt;ref name = mochizuki/&gt;

{{Condensed matter physics|expanded=Soft matter}}

A '''granular material''' is a conglomeration of discrete [[solid]], [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] [[particle]]s characterized by a loss of energy whenever the particles interact (the most common example would be [[friction]] when [[granulation|grains]] collide).&lt;ref&gt;Duran, J., ''Sands, Powders, and Grains: An Introduction to the Physics of Granular Materials'' (translated by A. Reisinger). November 1999, Springer-Verlag New York, Inc., New York, {{ISBN|0-387-98656-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The constituents that compose granular material are large enough such that they are not subject to thermal motion fluctuations. Thus, the lower size limit for grains in granular material is about 1 [[micrometre|µm]]. On the upper size limit, the physics of granular materials may be applied to ice floes where the individual grains are [[iceberg]]s and to [[asteroid belt]]s of the [[Solar System]] with individual grains being [[asteroid]]s.

Some examples of granular materials are [[snow]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[coal]], [[sand]], [[rice]], [[coffee]], [[corn flakes]], [[fertilizer]], and [[ball (bearing)|bearing balls]].  Research into granular materials is thus directly applicable and goes back at least to [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]], whose [[Friction|law of friction]] was originally stated for granular materials.&lt;ref&gt;Rodhes, M (editor), ''Principles of powder technology'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1997 {{ISBN|0-471-92422-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Granular materials are commercially important in applications as diverse as [[pharmaceutical]] industry, [[agriculture]], and [[energy production]].

[[powder (substance)|Powders]] are a special class of granular material due to their small particle size, which makes them more [[cohesion (chemistry)|cohesive]] and more easily [[suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] in a [[gas]]. 

The [[soldier]]/[[physicist]] Brigadier [[Ralph Alger Bagnold]] was an early pioneer of the physics of granular matter and whose book ''[[The Physics of Blown Sand and Desert Dunes]]''&lt;ref&gt;Bagnold, R.A. 1941. ''The physics of blown sand and desert dunes''. London: Methuen,&lt;/ref&gt; remains an important reference to this day.  According to [[material science|material scientist]] Patrick Richard, "Granular materials are ubiquitous in [[nature]] and are the second-most manipulated material in industry (the first one is [[water]])".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Richard, P.|title= Slow relaxation and compaction of granular systems|doi=10.1038/nmat1300|year=2005|last2=Nicodemi|first2=Mario|last3=Delannay|first3=Renaud|last4=Ribière|first4=Philippe|last5=Bideau|first5=Daniel|journal=Nature Materials|volume=4|issue=2|pages=121–8|pmid=15689950|bibcode = 2005NatMa...4..121R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some sense, granular materials do not constitute a single [[phases of matter|phase of matter]] but have characteristics reminiscent of [[solid]]s, [[liquid]]s, or [[gas]]es depending on the average energy per grain. However, in each of these states granular materials also exhibit properties which are unique.

Granular materials also exhibit a wide range of pattern forming behaviors when excited (e.g. vibrated or allowed to flow). As such granular materials under excitation can be thought of as an example of a [[complex system]].

== Granular solids ==
{{Main|Force chain}}
[[File:Stress transmision.svg|thumb|right|150px|Chain of transmission of stress forces in a granular media]]
When the average energy of the individual grains is low and the grains are fairly stationary relative to each other, the granular material acts like a solid. In general, stress in a granular solid is not distributed uniformly but is conducted away along so-called [[force chain]]s which are networks of grains resting on one another. Between these chains are regions of low stress whose grains are shielded for the effects of the grains above by [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]] and [[arch]]ing.

== Granular gases ==
If the granular material is driven harder such that contacts between the grains become highly infrequent, the material enters a gaseous state.  Correspondingly, one can define a granular temperature equal to the root mean square of grain velocity fluctuations that is analogous to [[thermodynamic temperature]].
Unlike conventional gases, granular materials will tend to cluster and clump due to the [[Dissipation|dissipative]] nature of the collisions between grains. This clustering has some interesting consequences. For example, if a partially partitioned box of granular materials is vigorously shaken then grains will over time tend to collect in one of the partitions rather than spread evenly into both partitions as would happen in a conventional gas. This effect, known as the granular [[Maxwell's demon]], does not violate any thermodynamics principles since energy is constantly being lost from the system in the process.

== Jamming transition ==
[[File:Granular jamming.svg|thumb|right|150px|Jamming during discharge of granular material is due to arch formation (red spheres)]]
Granular systems are known to exhibit [[Jamming (physics)|jamming]] and undergo a jamming transition which is thought of as a thermodynamic phase transition to a jammed state.&lt;ref&gt;Haye Hinrichsen, Dietrich E. Wolf (eds), ''The Physics of Granular Media''. 2004, Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. {{ISBN|978-3-527-60362-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Lubachevsky-Stillinger algorithm]] of jamming allows one to produce simulated jammed granular configurations.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://cherrypit.princeton.edu/papers/paper-202.pdf|doi=10.1063/1.1511510|title= Computer Generation of Dense Polydisperse Sphere Packings|year=2002|last1=Kansal|first1=Anuraag R.|last2=Torquato|first2=Salvatore|last3=Stillinger|first3=Frank H.|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics|volume=117|issue=18|pages=8212|bibcode = 2002JChPh.117.8212K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pattern formation ==
Excited granular matter is a rich pattern-forming system.  Some of the pattern-forming behaviours seen in granular materials are:
* The un-mixing or segregation of unlike grains under vibration and flow. An example of this is the so-called [[Brazil nut effect]] where Brazil nuts rise to the top of a packet of mixed nuts when shaken.The cause of this effect is that when shaken, granular (and some other) materials move in a circular pattern. some larger materials (Brazil nuts) get stuck while going down the circle and therefore stay on the top.
* The formation of structured surface or bulk patterns in vibrated granular layers.  These patterns include but are not limited to stripes, squares and hexagons.  These patterns are thought to be formed by fundamental excitations of the surface known as [[oscillon]]s. The formation of ordered volumetric structures in granular materials is known as Granular Crystallisation, and involves a transition from a random packing of particles to an ordered packing such as hexagonal close-packed or body-centred cubic. This is most commonly observed in granular materials with narrow size distributions and uniform grain morphology.
* The formation of sand [[ripple marks|ripples]], [[dune]]s, and [[sandsheet]]s
Some of the pattern-forming behaviours have been possible to reproduce in computer simulations.
&lt;ref&gt;John J. Drozd, [http://imaging.robarts.ca/~jdrozd/thesisjd.pdf Computer Simulation of Granular Matter: A Study of An Industrial Grinding Mill] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818102135/http://imaging.robarts.ca/~jdrozd/thesisjd.pdf |date=2011-08-18 }}, Thesis, Univ. Western Ontario, Canada, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alex Wissner-Gross|A. D. Wissner-Gross]], "[http://www.alexwg.org/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alexwg.org%2Fpublications%2FMaterResSocSympProc_1152-TT03-01.pdf Intruder dynamics on vibrofluidized granular surfaces]", ''Materials Research Society Symposium Proceedings'' 1152E, TT03-01 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
There are two main computational approaches to such simulations, [[time-stepped]] and [[Event-driven programming|event-driven]], the former being the most efficient for a higher density of the material and the motions of a lower intensity, and the latter for a lower density of the material and the motions of a higher intensity.

=== Acoustic effects ===
[[File:Flickr - Argenberg - Sand dunes (2007-05-226).jpg|thumb|150px|Sand dunes]]

Some beach sands, such as those of the aptly named [[Tidal River (Victoria)|Squeaky Beach]], exhibit squeaking when walked upon. Some desert dunes are known to exhibit [[booming dunes|booming]] during avalanching or when their surface is otherwise disturbed. Granular materials discharged from silos produce loud acoustic emissions in a process known as [[silo honking]].

== Granulation ==
{{Main|Granulation}}
'''Granulation''' is the act or process in which primary [[powder (substance)|powder]] [[particle]]s are made to adhere to form larger, multiparticle entities called ''granules.''

== Modeling of granular materials ==
{{anchor|Granular materials modeling|Modeling}}
Several methods are available for '''modeling of granular materials'''. Most of these methods consist of the statistical methods by which various statistical properties, derived from either point data or an image, are extracted and used to generate stochastic models of the granular medium. A recent and comprehensive review of such methods is available in [https://authors.library.caltech.edu/77130/4/bdc7eca0b0d59f71cccedfa9c809632059955b6cd6e2af8f9db0b87070dfcc64.pdf Tahmasebi and other (2017)].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tahmasebi|first=Pejman|last2=Sahimi|first2=Muhammad|last3=Andrade|first3=José E.|date=2017-01-01|title=Image-Based Modeling of Granular Porous Media|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL073938/abstract|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|pages=2017GL073938|doi=10.1002/2017GL073938|issn=1944-8007|bibcode=2017GeoRL..44.4738T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another alternative for building a pack of granular particles that recently has been [http://www.uwyo.edu/pejman/assets/packingcomputersgeotech_tahmasebi2018.pdf presented] is based on the [[Level-set method|level-set]] algorithm by which the real shape of the particle can be captured and reproduced through the extracted statistics for particles' morphologies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tahmasebi |first1=Pejman |title=Packing of discrete and irregular particles |journal=Computers and Geotechnics |date=August 2018 |volume=100 |pages=52–61 |doi=10.1016/j.compgeo.2018.03.011 |url=http://www.uwyo.edu/pejman/assets/packingcomputersgeotech_tahmasebi2018.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Horná Orava Protected Landscape Area''' ({{lang-sk|Chránená krajinná oblasť Horná Orava}}) is one of the [[Protected areas of Slovakia#Protected Landscape Areas|14 protected landscape areas]] in [[Slovakia]]. It is situated in the [[Námestovo District|Námestovo]] and [[Tvrdošín District|Tvrdošín]] districts, within the [[Orava (region)|Orava]] region.

==History==
The park was created on 24 September 1979 and the law creating it was amended on 29 September 2003.

==Geography, geology and biology==
It is made of [[Oravská Magura]], [[Podbeskydská vrchovina]] and [[Oravské Beskydy]] mountains, and the [[Orava Basin]], as well as the [[Orava (reservoir)|Orava Dam]], in the northernmost Slovakia.
Much of the PLA's territory is made from sandstone mountain ranges. More than half of the area is covered by forests. Beech and fir trees grow in the area, along with strong presence of the spruce monoculture. Exceptions are the areas under [[Babia Góra|Babia hora]], [[Paráč]] and [[Pilsko]] mountains, with old growth spruce with rowan trees being represented. A specific phenomenon of the park are the peat bogs, represented by the pine woods, providing shelter for many threatened species. The Orava Dam is a nesting place for many rare species of birds. The highest mountain is Babia hora at the border with [[Poland]] at {{convert|1722.9|m|ft|abbr=on}}

[[File:Julian Schwinger, 1965.jpg|thumb|Julian Schwinger, winner of the 1965 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]. Original caption: "His laboratory is his ballpoint pen." ]]
'''Julian Seymour Schwinger''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|w|ɪ|ŋ|ər}}; February 12, 1918 – July 16, 1994) was a [[Nobel Prize]] winning [[United States|American]] [[theoretical physicist]]. He is best known for his work on the [[theory]] of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED), in particular for developing a relativistically invariant [[perturbation theory]], and for renormalizing QED to one loop order. Schwinger was a   physics professor at several universities.

Schwinger is recognized as one of the greatest physicists of the twentieth century, responsible for much of modern quantum field theory, including a [[Schwinger's quantum action principle|variational approach]], and the equations of motion for quantum fields. He developed the first [[electroweak]] model, and the first example of confinement in 1+1 dimensions. He is responsible for the theory of multiple neutrinos, Schwinger terms, and the theory of the spin 3/2 field.

==Biography==
Julian Seymour Schwinger was born in New York City, to [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish]] parents originally from Poland, Belle (née Rosenfeld) and Benjamin Schwinger, a garment manufacturer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Climbing the mountain: the scientific biography of Julian Schwinger |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |first=Jagdish |last=Mehra |pages=1–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who had migrated to America.  Both his father and his mother's parents were prosperous clothing manufacturers, although the family business declined after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]]. The family followed the [[Orthodox Jewish]] tradition. Schwinger attended the [[Townsend Harris High School]] and then the [[City College of New York]] as an undergraduate before transferring to [[Columbia University]], where he received his B.A. in 1936 and his Ph.D. (overseen by [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]]) in 1939 at the age of 21. He worked at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (under [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]), and was later appointed to a position at [[Purdue University]].

===Career===
After having worked with Oppenheimer, Schwinger's first regular academic appointment was at [[Purdue University]] in 1941. While on leave from Purdue, he worked at the [[Radiation Laboratory]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] instead of at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] during [[World War II]]. He provided theoretical support for the development of [[radar]]. After the war, Schwinger left Purdue for [[Harvard University]], where he taught from 1945 to 1974. In 1966 he became the Eugene Higgins professor of physics at Harvard.

Schwinger developed an affinity for [[Green's function]]s from his radar work, and he used these methods to formulate quantum field theory in terms of local Green's functions in a relativistically invariant way. This allowed him to calculate unambiguously the first corrections to the electron magnetic moment in [[quantum electrodynamics]]. Earlier non-covariant work had arrived at infinite answers, but the extra symmetry in his methods allowed Schwinger to isolate the correct finite corrections.

Schwinger developed [[renormalization]], formulating [[quantum electrodynamics]] unambiguously to one-loop order.

In the same era, he introduced non-perturbative methods into quantum field theory, by calculating the rate at which [[electron]]-[[positron]] pairs are created by [[quantum tunneling|tunneling]] in an electric field, a process now known as the "Schwinger effect". This effect could not be seen in any finite order in perturbation theory.

Schwinger's foundational work on quantum field theory constructed the modern framework of field correlation functions and their [[Schwinger-Dyson equation|equations of motion]]. His approach started with a [[Schwinger's quantum action principle|quantum action]] and allowed bosons and fermions to be treated equally for the first time, using a differential form of [[Grassman variable|Grassman integration]]. He gave elegant proofs for the [[spin-statistics theorem]] and the [[CPT theorem]], and noted that the field algebra led to anomalous [[Schwinger terms]] in various classical identities, because of short distance singularities. These were foundational results in field theory, instrumental for the proper understanding of [[anomaly (physics)|anomalies]].

In other notable early work, Rarita and Schwinger formulated the abstract [[Wolfgang Pauli|Pauli]] and [[Markus Fierz|Fierz]] theory of the spin 3/2 field in a concrete form, as a vector of Dirac spinors. In order for the spin-3/2 field to interact consistently, some form of supersymmetry is required, and Schwinger later regretted that he had not followed up on this work far enough to discover supersymmetry.

Schwinger discovered that [[neutrino]]s come in multiple varieties, one for the [[electron]] and one for the [[muon]]. Nowadays there are known to be three light neutrinos; the third is the partner of the [[tau lepton]].

In the 1960s, Schwinger formulated and analyzed what is now known as the [[Schwinger model]], quantum electrodynamics in one space and one time dimension, the first example of a [[Color confinement|confining theory]]. He was also the first to suggest an electroweak gauge theory, an SU(2) gauge group spontaneously broken to electromagnetic U(1) at long distances. This was extended by his student [[Sheldon Glashow]] into the accepted pattern of electroweak unification. He attempted to formulate a theory of quantum electrodynamics with point [[magnetic monopoles]], a program which met with limited success because monopoles are strongly interacting when the quantum of charge is small.

Having supervised 73 doctoral dissertations
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.nus.edu.sg/~jsf/phd.pdf|title=Julian Schwinger Foundation|author=|date=|website=nus.edu.sg|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326204209/http://www.physics.nus.edu.sg/~jsf/phd.pdf|archivedate=26 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwinger is known as one of the most prolific graduate advisors in physics. Four of his students won Nobel prizes: [[Roy Glauber]], [[Benjamin Roy Mottelson]], [[Sheldon Glashow]] and [[Walter Kohn]] (in chemistry).

Schwinger had a mixed relationship with his colleagues, because he always pursued independent research, different from mainstream fashion. In particular, Schwinger developed the source theory,&lt;ref&gt;J.S. Schwinger, ''Particles, Sources, and Fields.'' Vol. 1 (1970), Vol. 2 (1973), Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley&lt;/ref&gt; a phenomenological theory for the physics of elementary particles, which is a predecessor of the modern [[effective field theory]]. It treats quantum fields as long-distance phenomena and uses auxiliary 'sources' that resemble currents in classical field theories. The source theory is a mathematically consistent field theory with clearly derived phenomenological results. The criticisms by his Harvard colleagues led Schwinger to leave the faculty in 1972 for [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]].  It is a story widely told that [[Steven Weinberg]], who inherited Schwinger's paneled office in Lyman Laboratory, there found a pair of old shoes, with the implied message, "think you can fill these?". At UCLA, and for the rest of his career, Schwinger continued to develop the source theory and its various applications.

After 1989 Schwinger took a keen interest in the non-mainstream research of [[cold fusion]]. He wrote eight theory papers about it. He resigned from the [[American Physical Society]] after their refusal to publish his papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title=Climbing the Mountain: The Scientific Biography of Julian Schwinger|author=[[Jagdish Mehra]], K. A. Milton, Julian Seymour Schwinger|edition=illustrated|editor=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2000|isbn=0-19-850658-9|page=550|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9SmZSN8F164C&amp;pg=PA550&amp;vq=resigned+american+physical+society+cold+fusion&amp;dq=Julian+Schwinger+cold+fusion|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}, Also {{harvnb|Close|1993|pp=197–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that cold fusion research was being suppressed and academic freedom violated. He wrote: "The pressure for conformity is enormous. I have experienced it in editors' rejection of submitted papers, based on venomous criticism of anonymous referees. The replacement of impartial reviewing by censorship will be the death of science."

In his last publications, Schwinger proposed a theory of [[sonoluminescence]] as a long distance quantum radiative phenomenon associated not with atoms, but with fast-moving surfaces in the collapsing bubble, where there are discontinuities in the dielectric constant. The [[mechanism of sonoluminescence]] now supported by experiments focuses on superheated gas inside the bubble as the source of the light.&lt;ref name="Brenner2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Brenner|first1=M. P.|last2= Hilgenfeldt|first2= S.|last3= Lohse|first3= D.|title= Single-bubble sonoluminescence|journal= Reviews of Modern Physics|volume= 74|issue= 2|year= 2002|pages= 425–484|doi= 10.1103/RevModPhys.74.425|bibcode= 2002RvMP...74..425B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwinger was jointly awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1965 for his work on [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED), along with [[Richard Feynman]] and [[Shin'ichirō Tomonaga]]. Schwinger's awards and honors were numerous even before his Nobel win. They include the first [[Albert Einstein Award]] (1951), the U.S. [[National Medal of Science]] (1964), honorary D.Sc. degrees from Purdue University (1961) and Harvard University (1962), and the Nature of Light Award of the U.S. [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (1949).

===Schwinger and Feynman===
As a famous physicist, Schwinger was often compared to another legendary physicist of his generation, [[Richard Feynman]]. Schwinger was more formally inclined and favored symbolic manipulations in [[quantum field theory]]. He worked with local field operators, and found relations between them, and he felt that physicists should understand the algebra of local fields, no matter how paradoxical it was. By contrast, Feynman was more intuitive, believing that the physics could be extracted entirely from the [[Feynman diagram]]s, which gave a particle picture. Schwinger commented on Feynman diagrams in the following way,

{{quote|Like the silicon chips of more recent years, the Feynman diagram was bringing computation to the masses.&lt;ref&gt;J. Schwinger, "Quantum Electrodynamics-An Individual View," J. Physique 43, Colloque C-8, Supplement au no. 12, 409 (1982) and ''Renormalization Theory of Quantum Electrodynamics: An Individual View,'' in '' The Birth of Particle Physics'', Cambridge University Press, 1983, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Schwinger disliked Feynman diagrams because he felt that they made the student focus on the particles and forget about local fields, which in his view inhibited understanding. He went so far as to ban them altogether from his class, although he understood them perfectly well. The true difference is however deeper, and it was expressed by Schwinger in the following passage, 

{{quote|Eventually, these ideas led to Lagrangian or action formulations of quantum mechanics, appearing in two distinct but related forms, which I distinguish as ''differential and integral''. The latter, spearheaded by Feynman has had all the press coverage, but I continue to believe that the differential viewpoint is more general, more elegant, more useful.&lt;ref&gt;J.Schwinger (1973). "A report on quantum electrodynamics". In J. Mehra (ed.), ''The Physicist's Conception of Nature.'' Dordrecht: Reidel.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Despite sharing the Nobel Prize, Schwinger and Feynman had a different approach to quantum electrodynamics and to quantum field theory in general. Feynman used a [[regularization (physics)|regulator]], while Schwinger was able to formally renormalize to one loop without an explicit regulator. Schwinger believed in the formalism of local fields, while Feynman had faith in the particle paths. They followed each other's work closely, and each respected the other. On Feynman's death, Schwinger described him as

{{quote|An honest man, the outstanding intuitionist of our age, and a prime example of what may lie in store for anyone who dares to follow the beat of a different drum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amasci.com/feynman.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070507053519/http://amasci.com/feynman.html |archivedate=2007-05-07 |df= }}; "A Path to Quantum Electrodynamics," Physics Today, February 1989&lt;/ref&gt; }}

===Death===
[[File:Julian Schwinger headstone.JPG|thumb|The headstone of Julian Schwinger at Mt Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, MA.]]
Schwinger died of pancreatic cancer. He is buried at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]]; &lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha}{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt; is engraved above his name on his tombstone. These symbols refer to his calculation of the [[anomalous magnetic dipole moment|correction ("anomalous") to the magnetic moment of the electron]].

'''Kinetic energy metamorphosis (KEM)''' is a recently discovered [[tribology|tribological]] process of gradual crystal re-orientation and [[foliation]] of component minerals in certain rocks. It is caused by very high, localized application of [[kinetic energy]]. The required energy may be provided by prolonged battery of fluvially propelled [[bed load]] of cobbles, by glacial [[abrasion (geology)|abrasion]], tectonic deformation, and even by human action. It can result in the formation of laminae on specific metamorphic rocks that, while being chemically similar to the [[protolith]], differ significantly in appearance and in their resistance to weathering or deformation. These [[tectonite]] layers are of whitish color and tend to survive granular or mass exfoliation much longer than the surrounding protolith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bednarik|first1=Robert G.|title=The tribology of cupules|journal=Geological Magazine|date=5 March 2015|volume=152|issue=04|pages=758–765|doi=10.1017/S0016756815000060|bibcode=2015GeoM..152..758B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==KEM in cupules==

The products of KEM were first identified in 2015 in [[cupules]], a form of rock art consisting of spherical cap or dome-shaped depressions created by percussion with hammer-stones. KEM laminae, caused by solid state re-metamorphosis of [[metamorphic rock]], have been observed in cupules on three rock types:

# On [[quartzite]] at Indragarh Hill, Bhanpura, India; Nchwaneng, Korannaberg site complex, South Africa; and Inca Huasi, Mizque, central Bolivia.
# On [[sandstone]] at Jabal al-Raat, Shuwaymis site complex, northern Saudi Arabia; Umm Singid and Jebel as-Suqur, Sudan; Tabrakat, Acacus site complex, Libya; and Inca Huasi, Mizque, central Bolivia.
# On [[schist]] at Condor Mayu 2, Santivañez site complex, Cochabamba, Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bednarik|first1=R. G.|title=The Science of Cupules|journal=Archaeometry|date=December 2016|volume=58|issue=6|pages=899–911|doi=10.1111/arcm.12216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Replication has established that cupules produced on very hard rocks, such as quartzite, require many tens of thousands of blows with hammer-stones to make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kumar |first1=G. |last2=Kishna |first2=R. |year=2014 |title=Understanding the technology of the Daraki-Chattan cupules: the cupule replication project |journal=Rock Art Research |volume=31 |number=2 |pages=177–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the cumulative force applied to very small surface areas (&lt;15 cm2) is in the order of tens of kN (kilo Newtons). In one extreme case, the KEM lamina has been developed to a thickness of c. 10&amp;nbsp;mm, but the most commonly observed thickness is about 1–2&amp;nbsp;mm. The [[tectonite]] layer is always thickest in the central part of the cupule, i.e. where the greatest amount of energy was applied.

==Geological KEM phenomena==

These phenomena have since also been observed in geological contexts, generally of three types:

# On the bedrock of [[paleochannels]] (geologically ancient river courses) that has been heavily impacted by battering with [[fluvial]] detrital loads in places of high kinetic energy, such as ancient rapids. It can even occur on the transported [[cobbles]] and [[boulders]] found deposited in such palaeochannels.
# On glacially abraded pavements of quartzite, caused by the tribological action of the lithic load of ancient glaciers.
# In the form of whitish sheets of planar or curvi-planar tectonite contained in sandstone that has been subjected to tectonic foliation.

Kinetic energy metamorphosis products are tribological&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report| author=Jost, P |year=1966 |title=Lubrication (tribology): a report on the present position an industry’s needs |publisher=Department of Education and Science - Her Majesty’s Stationery Office |place=London |oclc=3751788}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bhushan|first1=Bharat|title=Principles and applications of tribology|date=2013|isbn=9781118403020|edition=Second |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |place=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Czesław Kajdas |year=2013 |chapter=General Approach to Mechanochemistry and Its Relation to Tribochemistry |title=Tribology in Engineering |editor=Hasim Pihtili |publisher=InTech |doi=10.5772/50507 |url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/tribology-in-engineering/general-approach-to-mechanochemistry-and-its-relation-to-tribochemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; phenomena, caused by very focused, localized cumulative effect of kinetic energy on the syntaxial silica (and the voids it contains) that forms the cement of such rocks as sandstones and quartzites. The conversion to tectonite does not appear to be reversible, and the high resistance of that product to [[weathering]] processes protects the parent rock it conceals from both granular and mass exfoliation. Its susceptibility to dating techniques needs to be explored.

Overlay: lanthanum/strontium (blue), manganese (purple), oxygen (red).]]

'''Lanthanum strontium manganite''' (LSM or LSMO) is an [[oxide]] ceramic material with the general formula La&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''x'' describes the doping level.

It has a [[perovskite]]-based crystal structure, which has the general form ABO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  In the crystal, the 'A' sites are occupied by [[lanthanum]] and [[strontium]] atoms, and the 'B' sites are occupied by the smaller [[manganese]] atoms.  In other words, the material consists of [[lanthanum manganite]] with some of the [[lanthanum]] atoms substitutionally [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] with [[strontium]] atoms. The strontium (valence 2+) doping on lanthanum (valence 3+) introduces extra holes in the valence band and thus increases electronic conductivity.

LSMO has a rich electronic phase diagram, including a doping-dependent [[metal-insulator transition]], [[paramagnetism]] and [[ferromagnetism]].&lt;ref name="UrushibaraMoritomo1995"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Urushibara A, Moritomo Y, Arima T, Asamitsu A, Kido G, Tokura Y|title=Insulator-metal transition and giant magnetoresistance in La&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;|journal=Physical Review B|volume=51|issue=20|year=1995|pages=14103–14109|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.51.14103|bibcode=1995PhRvB..5114103U}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of a Griffith phase has been reported as well.&lt;ref name="DeisenhoferBraak2005"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors =Deisenhofer J, Braak D, Krug von Nidda HA, Hemberger J, Eremina RM, Ivanshin VA, Balbashov M, Jug G, Loidl A, Kimura T, Tokura Y|title=Observation of a Griffiths Phase in Paramagnetic La&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=95|issue=25|year=2005|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.257202|display-authors=6|bibcode=2005PhRvL..95y7202D|arxiv=cond-mat/0501443}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors = Dagotto E| date= 2003 | title = Nanoscale Phase Separation and Colossal Magnetoresistance.

LSM is primarily an electronic conductor, with transference number close to 1.

This material is commonly used as a [[cathode]] material in commercially produced [[solid oxide fuel cell]]s (SOFCs) because it has a high [[electrical conductivity]] at higher temperatures, and its [[thermal expansion coefficient]] is well matched with [[yttria-stabilized zirconia]] (YSZ), a common material for SOFC [[electrolytes]].

In research, LSM is one of the perovskite manganites that show the [[colossal magnetoresistance]] (CMR) effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramirez AP | year = 1997 | title = Colossal magnetoresistance | journal = J.

LSM behaves like a [[half-metal]], suggesting its possible use in [[spintronics]]. It displays a [[colossal magnetoresistance]] effect. Above its [[Curie temperature]] (about 350 K) Jahn-Teller [[polaron]]s are formed; the material's ability to conduct electricity depends on the presence of the polarons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Publications/Currents/Archive/Apr-29-2005.html|title=Berkeley Lab View – April 29, 2005|work=lbl.gov|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monocrystalline silicon''' (also called "single-crystal silicon", "single-crystal Si", "mono c-Si", or '''mono-Si''') is the base material for [[silicon chip]]s used in virtually all electronic equipment today. Mono-Si also serves as a [[photovoltaic]], light-absorbing material in the manufacture of [[solar cell]]s.

It consists of [[silicon]] in which the [[crystal lattice]] of the entire solid is continuous, unbroken to its edges, and free of any [[grain boundaries]]. Mono-Si can be prepared as an [[intrinsic semiconductor]] that consists only of exceedingly pure silicon, or it can be [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] by the addition of other elements such as [[boron]] or [[phosphorus]] to make [[P-type semiconductor|p-type]] or [[N-type semiconductor|n-type]] silicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Monkowski, J.

Lett.|volume=35|pages=410–412|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its [[Semiconductor|semiconducting]] properties, single-crystal silicon is perhaps the most important technological material of the last few decades—the "silicon era",&lt;ref&gt;W.Heywang, K.H.Zaininger, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ATFo8Pr67uIC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=%22silicon+era%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tGdFTMrmK8Oblgfi763tAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi Silicon: the semiconductor material]'', in ''Silicon: evolution and future of a technology'', P.Siffert, E.F.Krimmel eds., Springer Verlag, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; because its availability at an affordable cost has been essential for the development of the electronic devices on which the present-day [[electronics]] and [[information technology|IT]] revolution is based.

Monocrystalline silicon differs from other [[allotropic]] forms, such as  non-crystalline [[amorphous silicon]]—used in [[thin-film solar cells]]—and [[polycrystalline silicon]], which consists of small crystals also known as [[crystallite]]s.

== Production ==
Monocrystalline silicon is generally created by one of several methods that involve melting high-purity, semiconductor-grade silicon (only a few parts per million of impurities) and the use of a [[Seed crystal|seed]] to initiate the formation of a continuous single crystal. This process is normally performed in an inert atmosphere, such as [[argon]], and in an inert crucible, such as [[quartz]], to avoid impurities that would affect the crystal uniformity.

The most common production method is the [[Czochralski process]], which dips a precisely oriented rod-mounted [[seed crystal]] into the molten silicon. The rod is then slowly pulled upwards and rotated simultaneously, allowing the pulled material to solidify into a monocrystalline cylindrical ingot up to 2 meters in length and weighing several hundred kilograms. Magnetic fields may also be applied to control and suppress turbulent flow, further improving the uniformity of the crystallization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wang |first=C. |last2=Zhang |first2=H. |last3=Wang |first3=T.

Compared to the casting of polycrystalline ingots, the production of monocrystalline silicon is very slow and expensive. However, the demand for mono-Si continues to rise due to the superior electronic properties—the lack of grain boundaries allows better charge carrier flow and prevents electron [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombination]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/122927906 |title=Applied photovoltaics |authors=Wenham, S.

== In electronics ==
{{Main|Semiconductor device fabrication}}
The primary application of monocrystalline silicon is as mechanical support for [[integrated circuit]]s. Ingots made from the Czochralski process are sliced into wafers about 0.75&amp;nbsp;mm thick and polished to obtain a regular, flat substrate, onto which [[microelectronic]] devices are built through various [[microfabrication]] processes, such as [[Doping (semiconductors)|doping]] or [[ion implantation]], [[Etching (microfabrication)|etching]], [[Thin-film deposition|deposition]] of various materials, and [[Photolithography|photolithographic]] patterning.

A single continuous crystal is critical for electronics, since grain boundaries, [[impurity|impurities]], and [[crystallographic defect]]s can significantly impact the local electronic properties of the material, which in turn affects device performance by interfering with circuit paths. For example, without crystalline perfection, it would be virtually impossible to build [[very large-scale integration]] (VLSI) devices, in which billions&lt;ref&gt;Peter Clarke, [http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=172301051 ''Intel enters billion-transistor processor era''], EE Times, 14 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; of transistor-based circuits, all of which must function reliably, are combined into a single chip to form a microprocessor. As such, the electronics industry has invested heavily in facilities to produce large single crystals of silicon.

== In solar cells ==
[[File:Global Market Share by PV Technology from 1990 to 2013.svg|thumb|Global market-share in terms of annual production by PV technology since 1990]]
Monocrystalline silicon is also used for high-performance [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] (PV) devices. Since there are less stringent demands on structural imperfections compared to microelectronics applications, lower-quality solar-grade silicon (Sog-Si) is often used for solar cells. Despite this, the monocrystalline-silicon photovoltaic industry has benefitted greatly from the development of faster mono-Si production methods for the electronics industry.

=== Market share ===
Being the second most common form of PV technology, monocrystalline silicon is ranked behind only its sister, [[polycrystalline silicon]]. Due to the significantly higher production rate and steadily decreasing costs of poly-silicon, the market share of mono-Si has been decreasing: in 2013, monocrystalline solar cells had a market share of 36%, which translated into the production of 12.6&amp;nbsp;GW of photovoltaic capacity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/downloads-englisch/pdf-files-englisch/photovoltaics-report-slides.pdf Photovoltaics Report], Fraunhofer ISE, July 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; but the market share had dropped below 25% by 2016. Despite the lowered market share, the equivalent mono-Si PV capacity produced in 2016 was 20.2&amp;nbsp;GW, indicating a significant increase in the overall production of photovoltaic technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/downloads-englisch/pdf-files-englisch/photovoltaics-report-slides.pdf Photovoltaics Report], Fraunhofer ISE, February 26, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Efficiency ===
With a recorded single-junction cell lab efficiency of 26.7%, monocrystalline silicon has the highest confirmed conversion efficiency out of all commercial PV technologies, ahead of poly-Si (22.3%) and established [[thin-film solar cell|thin-film technologies]], such as [[Copper indium gallium selenide solar cells|CIGS cells]] (21.7%), [[Cadmium telluride photovoltaics|CdTe cells]] (21.0%), and [[Amorphous silicon|a-Si cells]] (10.2%). [[Solar module]] efficiencies for mono-Si—which are always lower than those of their corresponding cells—finally crossed the 20% mark for in 2012 and hit 24.4% in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Green |first=Martin A. |last2=Hishikawa |first2=Yoshihiro |last3=Dunlop |first3=Ewan D. |last4=Levi |first4=Dean H. |last5=Hohl-Ebinger |first5=Jochen |last6=Ho-Baillie |first6=Anita W.

Since they are more expensive than their polycrystalline counterparts, mono-Si cells are useful for applications where the main considerations are limitations on weight or available area, such as in spacecraft or satellites powered by solar energy, where efficiency can be further improved through combination with other technologies, such as [[multi-junction solar cell|multi-layer solar cells]].

=== Manufacturing ===
Besides the low production rate, there are also concerns over wasted material in the manufacturing process. Creating space-efficient solar panels requires cutting the circular wafers (a product of the cylindrical ingots formed through the Czochralski process) into octagonal cells that can be packed closely together. The leftover material is not used to create PV cells and is either discarded or recycled by going back to ingot production for melting. Furthermore, even though mono-Si cells can absorb the majority of photons within 20&amp;nbsp;μm of the incident surface, limitations on the ingot sawing process mean commercial wafer thickness are generally around 200&amp;nbsp;μm. However, advances in technology are expected to reduce wafer thicknesses to 140&amp;nbsp;μm by 2026.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.canadiansolar.com/media/canadian_solar-solar_industry_technology_report_2015-2016.pdf Solar Industry Technology Report 2015–2016], Canadian Solar, October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other manufacturing method are being researched, such as direct wafer [[epitaxial growth]], which involves growing gaseous layers on reusable silicon substrates. Newer processes may allow growth of square crystals that can then be processed into thinner wafers without compromising quality or efficiency, thereby eliminating the waste from traditional ingot sawing and cutting methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nrel.gov/news/features/2014/14393.html |title=Crystal Solar and NREL Team Up to Cut Costs |last=Scanlon |first=Bill |date=August 27, 2014 |website=NREL |language=en |access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''nuclear holocaust''', '''nuclear apocalypse''' or '''atomic holocaust''' is a theoretical scenario involving widespread destruction and  [[radioactive]] fallout causing the [[Global catastrophic risks|collapse of civilization]], through the use of [[nuclear weapons]]. Under such a scenario, some of the Earth is made uninhabitable by [[nuclear warfare]] in [[World War III|future world wars]].

Besides the immediate destruction of cities by nuclear blasts, the potential aftermath of a nuclear war could involve firestorms, a [[nuclear winter]], widespread [[Acute radiation syndrome|radiation sickness]] from [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]], and/or the temporary loss of much modern technology due to [[electromagnetic pulse]]s. Some scientists, such as [[Alan Robock]], have speculated that a thermonuclear war could result in the end of modern civilization on [[Earth]], in part due to a long-lasting nuclear winter. In one model, the average temperature of Earth following a full thermonuclear war falls for several years by 7 to 8 degrees Celsius on average.&lt;ref name="RobockSAD"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robock|first1=Alan|last2=Toon|first2=Owen B|title=Self-assured destruction: The climate impacts of nuclear war|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|date=2012|volume=68|issue=5|pages=66–74|doi=10.1177/0096340212459127|url=http://thebulletin.org/2012/september/self-assured-destruction-climate-impacts-nuclear-war|accessdate=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early [[Cold War]]-era studies suggested that billions of humans would nonetheless survive the immediate effects of nuclear blasts and radiation following a global thermonuclear war.&lt;ref name="bmartin.cc"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/82jpr.html |doi=10.1177/002234338201900401 |title=Critique of Nuclear Extinction |author= Martin, Brian| journal=Journal of Peace Research|volume=19|issue=4|year= 1982|pages=287–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/nuclearwar1.html The Effects of a Global Thermonuclear War].

Additionally, it has been argued that even a relatively small-scale nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan involving 100 [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]] yield (15 kilotons) weapons, could cause a nuclear winter and kill more than a billion people.&lt;ref name="IPPNWStudy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Helfand|first1=Ira|title=Nuclear Famine: Two Billion People at Risk?|url=http://www.ippnw.org/pdf/nuclear-famine-two-billion-at-risk-2013.pdf|website=International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War|accessdate=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1947, the [[Doomsday Clock]] of the [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] has visualized how close the world is to a nuclear war.

The threat of a nuclear holocaust plays an important role in the [[Nuclear weapons in popular culture|popular perception of nuclear weapons]]. It features in the security concept of [[Mutual assured destruction|mutually assured destruction (MAD)]]{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} and is a common scenario in [[survivalism]]. Nuclear holocaust is a [[List of nuclear holocaust fiction|common feature in literature and film]], especially in [[speculative fiction|speculative genres]] such as [[science fiction]], [[dystopia]]n and [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic fiction]].

==Etymology and usage==
The English word "holocaust", derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] term "holokaustos" meaning "completely burnt", refers to great destruction and loss of life, especially by fire.&lt;ref name="AmHeritage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/holocaust|title=holocaust|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2018|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/holocaust|title=holocaust - Definition of holocaust in US English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One early use of the word "holocaust" to describe an imagined nuclear destruction appears in Reginald Glossop's 1926 novel ''The Orphan of Space'': "Moscow ... beneath them  ... a crash like a crack of Doom! The echoes of this Holocaust rumbled and rolled ... a distinct smell of sulphur ... atomic destruction."&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Glossop, The Orphan of Space (London: G. MacDonald, 1926), pp. 303–306.&lt;/ref&gt; In the novel, an atomic weapon is planted in the office of the Soviet dictator, who, with German help and Chinese mercenaries, is preparing the takeover of Western Europe.

References to nuclear destruction often speak of "atomic holocaust" or "nuclear holocaust.” For instance, U.S. President Bush stated in August 2007: "Iran's active pursuit of technology that could lead to nuclear weapons threatens to put a region already known for instability and violence under the shadow of a nuclear holocaust".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1561535/Bush-warns-of-Iran-nuclear-holocaust.html|title=Bush warns of Iran 'nuclear holocaust'|first1=Damien|last1=McElroy|first2=Alex|last2=Spillius|date=28 August 2007|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John F. Kennedy estimated the probability of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] escalating to nuclear conflict as between 33% and 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allison |first=Graham |year=2012 |title=The Cuban Missile Crisis at 50 |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137679/graham-allison/the-cuban-missile-crisis-at-50 |journal=[[Foreign Affairs]] |volume=91 |issue=4 |accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vzglyad.ru/opinions/2013/11/22/660828.html|title= ВЗГЛЯД / «США и Россия: кризис 1962–го»|publisher=vzglyad.ru|date=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a poll of experts at the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference in Oxford (17‐20 July 2008), the [[Future of Humanity Institute]] estimated the probability of complete human extinction by nuclear weapons at 1% within the century, the probability of 1 billion dead at 10% and the probability of 1 million dead at 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.global-catastrophic-risks.com/docs/2008-1.pdf|title=Global Catastrophic Risks Survey|last=|first=|last2=Bostrom|first2=Nick|date=|website=Future of Humanity Institute|publisher=Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford University|access-date=|last1=Sandberg|first1=Anders|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results reflect the median opinions of a group of experts, rather than a probabilistic model; the actual values may be much lower or higher.

==Moral importance of human extinction risk==
{{Main|Human extinction#Moral importance of existential risk}}

In his book ''[[Reasons and Persons]]'', philosopher [[Derek Parfit]] posed the following question:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Reasons and Persons]] |first=Derek |last=Parfit |authorlink=Derek Parfit |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1986 |chapter=154. How both human history, and the history of ethics, may be just beginning}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Compare three outcomes:
#Peace.
#A nuclear war that kills 99% of the world’s existing population.
#A nuclear war that kills 100%.
(2) would be worse than (1), and (3) would be worse than (2). Which is the greater of these two differences?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He continues that "Most people believe that the greater difference is between (1) and (2). I believe that the difference between (2) and (3) is ''very much'' greater." Thus, he argues, even if it would be bad if massive numbers of humans died, human extinction would itself be much worse because it prevents the existence of all future generations. And given the magnitude of the calamity were the human race to become extinct, [[Nick Bostrom]] argues that there is an overwhelming moral imperative to reduce even small risks of human extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1758-5899.12002 |first=Nick |last=Bostrom |authorlink=Nick Bostrom |title=Existential Risk Prevention as Global Priority |journal=[[Global Policy]] |volume=4 |issue=1 |year=2013 |pages=15–31 |url=http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Likelihood of complete human extinction==

[[File:US and USSR nuclear stockpiles.svg|thumb|The United States and [[Soviet Union]]/Russia nuclear stockpiles, in [[Historical nuclear weapons stockpiles and nuclear tests by country|total number of nuclear bombs/warheads in existence]] throughout the [[Cold War]] and post-Cold War era.]]
Many scholars have posited that a global thermonuclear war with Cold War-era stockpiles, or even with the current smaller stockpiles, may lead to human extinction. This position was bolstered when nuclear winter was first conceptualized and modelled in 1983. However, models from the past decade consider total extinction very unlikely, and suggest parts of the world would remain habitable.&lt;ref name=tonn&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tonn, Bruce |author2=MacGregor, Donald |last-author-amp=yes |doi=10.1016/j.futures.2009.07.009 |title=A singular chain of events |journal=Futures |volume=41 |issue=10 |year=2009 |pages=706–714}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technically the risk may not be zero, as the climactic effects of nuclear war are uncertain and could theoretically be larger than current models suggest, just as they could theoretically be smaller than current models suggest.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=bostrom2002/&gt; "(i) For there to be an existential risk it suffices that we can't be sure that it wouldn't. (ii) The climatic effects of a large nuclear war are not well known (there is the possibility of a nuclear winter)" --&gt; There could also be indirect risks, such as a societal collapse following nuclear war that can make humanity much more vulnerable to other existential threats.&lt;ref name=bostrom2002&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bostrom, Nick |title=Existential risks |journal=Journal of Evolution and Technology |volume=9 |issue=1 |year=2002 |pages=1–31, §4.2 |url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related area of inquiry is: if a future nuclear arms race someday leads to larger stockpiles or more dangerous nuclear weapons than existed at the height of the Cold War, at what point could a war with such weapons result in human extinction?&lt;ref name=bostrom2002/&gt; Physicist Leo Szilard warned in the 1950s that a deliberate "doomsday device" could be constructed by surrounding powerful hydrogen bombs with a massive amount of cobalt. Cobalt has a half-life of five years, and its global fallout might, some physicists have posited, be able to clear out all human life via lethal radiation intensity. The main motivation for building a cobalt bomb in this scenario is its reduced expense compared with the arsenals possessed by superpowers; such a doomsday device does not need to be launched before detonation, and thus does not require expensive missile delivery systems, and the hydrogen bombs do not need to be miniaturized for delivery via missile. The system for triggering it might have to be completely automated, in order for the deterrent to be effective. A modern twist might be to also lace the bombs with aerosols designed to exacerbate nuclear winter. A major caveat is that nuclear fallout transfer between the northern and southern hemispheres is expected to be small; unless a bomb detonates in each hemisphere, the effect of a bomb detonated in one hemisphere on the other is diminished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Max Tegmark|author-link=Max Tegmark|title=[[Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence]]|date=2017|publisher=Knopf|location="Doomsday Devices"|isbn=9780451485076|edition=1st|chapter=Chapter 5: Aftermath: The Next 10,000 Years}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of nuclear war ==
Historically, it has been difficult to estimate the total number of deaths resulting from a global nuclear exchange because scientists are continually discovering new effects of nuclear weapons, and also revising existing models.

Early reports considered direct effects from nuclear blast and radiation and indirect effects from economic, social, and political disruption. In a 1979 report for the U.S. Senate, the [[Office of Technology Assessment]] estimated casualties under different scenarios. For a full-scale [[countervalue]]/[[counterforce]] nuclear exchange between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, they predicted U.S. deaths from 35 to 77 percent (70 million to 160 million dead at the time), and Soviet deaths from 20 to 40 percent of the population.&lt;ref name="Report1979"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johns|first1=Lionel S|last2=Sharfman|first2=Peter|last3=Medalia|first3=Jonathan|last4=Vining|first4=Robert W|last5=Lewis|first5=Kevin|last6=Proctor|first6=Gloria|title=The Effects of Nuclear War|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~ota/disk3/1979/7906/7906.PDF|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=13 February 2016|date=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this report was made when nuclear stockpiles were at much higher levels than they are today, it also was made before the risk of nuclear winter was discovered in the early 1980s. Additionally, it did not consider other secondary effects, such electromagnetic pulses (EMP), and the ramifications they would have on modern technology and industry.

=== Nuclear winter ===
{{Main|Nuclear winter}}
In the early 1980s, scientists began to consider the effects of smoke and soot arising from burning wood, plastics, and petroleum fuels in nuclear-devastated cities. It was speculated that the intense heat would carry these particulates to extremely high altitudes where they could drift for weeks and block out all but a fraction of the sun's light.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuclear winter|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/nuclear-winter|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A landmark 1983 study by the so-called TTAPS team ([[Richard P. Turco]], [[Owen Toon]], Thomas P. Ackerman, [[James B. Pollack]] and [[Carl Sagan]]) was the first to model these effects and coined the term "nuclear winter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nuclear Winter: Global Consequences of Multiple Nuclear Explosions |journal=Science |volume=222 |issue=4630 |pages=1283–92 |date=23 December 1983 |pmid=17773320 |doi=10.1126/science.222.4630.1283|bibcode = 1983Sci...222.1283T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent studies make use of modern global circulation models and far greater computer power than was available for the 1980s studies. A 2007 study examined consequences of a global nuclear war involving moderate to large portions of the current global arsenal.&lt;ref name="Robock2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robock|first1=Alan|last2=Oman|first2=Luke|last3=Stenchikov|first3=Georgiy L.|title=Nuclear winter revisited with a modern climate model and current nuclear arsenals: Still catastrophic consequences|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|date=2007|volume=112|issue=D13107|pages=14|doi=10.1029/2006JD008235|url=http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/RobockNW2006JD008235.pdf|accessdate=13 February 2016|bibcode=2007JGRD..11213107R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found cooling by about 12–20&amp;nbsp;°C in much of the core farming regions of the US, Europe, Russia and China and as much as 35&amp;nbsp;°C in parts of Russia for the first two summer growing seasons. The changes they found were also much longer lasting than previously thought, because their new model better represented entry of soot aerosols in the upper stratosphere, where precipitation does not occur, and therefore clearance was on the order of 10 years.&lt;ref name="ToonandRobock2010" /&gt; In addition, they found that global cooling caused a weakening of the global hydrological cycle, reducing global [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] by about 45%.

The authors did not discuss the implications for agriculture in depth, but noted that a 1986 study which assumed no food production for a year projected that "most of the people on the planet would run out of food and starve to death by then" and commented that their own results show that, "This period of no food production needs to be extended by many years, making the impacts of nuclear winter even worse than previously thought."&lt;ref name="Robock2007" /&gt;

In contrast to the above investigations of global nuclear conflicts, studies have shown that even small-scale, regional nuclear conflicts could disrupt the global climate for a decade or more. In a regional nuclear conflict scenario where two opposing nations in the [[subtropics]] would each use 50 [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]]-sized nuclear weapons (about 15 kiloton each) on major populated centres, the researchers estimated as much as five million tons of soot would be released, which would produce a cooling of several degrees over large areas of [[North America]] and [[Eurasia]], including most of the grain-growing regions.&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RobockRegional2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ToonandRobock2010"/&gt; The cooling would last for years, and according to the research, could be "catastrophic". Additionally, the analysis showed a 10% drop in average global precipitation, with the largest losses in the low latitudes due to failure of the monsoons.

Regional nuclear conflicts could also inflict significant damage to the ozone layer. A 2008 study found that a regional nuclear weapons exchange could create a near-global ozone hole, triggering human health problems and impacting agriculture for at least a decade.&lt;ref name=Mills2008&gt;{{cite journal |title=Massive global ozone loss predicted following regional nuclear conflict |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |date=2008 |pmid=18391218 |pmc=2291128 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0710058105 |last1=Mills |first1=M. J. |last2=Toon |first2=O. B. |last3=Turco |first3=R. P. |last4=Kinnison |first4=D.

These high temperatures and nitrogen oxides would reduce ozone to the same dangerous levels we now experience below the ozone hole above Antarctica every spring.&lt;ref name="ToonandRobock2010"/&gt;

=== Nuclear famine ===
{{Main|Nuclear famine}}
It is difficult to estimate the number of casualties that would result from nuclear winter, but it is likely that the primary effect would be global famine (known as Nuclear Famine), wherein mass starvation occurs due to disrupted agricultural production and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Harwell, M., and C. Harwell. (1986). "Nuclear Famine: The Indirect Effects of Nuclear War", pp. 117–135 in Solomon, F. and R. Marston (Eds.). ''The Medical Implications of Nuclear War''. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press. {{ISBN|0309036925}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 report, the [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]] (IPPNW) concluded that more than two billion people, about a third of the world's population, would be at risk of starvation in the event of a regional nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan, or by the use of even a small proportion of nuclear arms held by the U.S. and Russia.&lt;ref name="IPPNWStudy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IPPNWPress"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loretz|first1=John|title=Nobel Laureate Warns Two Billion at Risk from Nuclear Famine|url=http://www.ippnw.org/pdf/nuclear-famine-2013-press-release-english.pdf|website=IPPNW|accessdate=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several independent studies show corroborated conclusions that agricultural outputs will be significantly reduced for years by climatic changes driven by nuclear wars. Reduction of food supply will be further exacerbated by rising food prices, affecting hundreds of millions of vulnerable people, especially in the poorest nations of the world.

=== Electromagnetic pulse ===
{{See also|Nuclear electromagnetic pulse|High-altitude nuclear explosion}}

An [[electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP) is a burst of electromagnetic radiation. Nuclear explosions create a pulse of electromagnetic radiation called a nuclear EMP or NEMP. Such EMP interference is known to be generally disruptive or damaging to electronic equipment. If a single nuclear weapon "designed to emit EMP were detonated 250 to 300 miles up over the middle of the country it would disable the electronics in the entire United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kessler|first1=Ronald|title=EMP Attack Would Send America into a Dark Age|url=http://www.newsmax.com/RonaldKessler/emp-electromagnetic-pulse/2009/09/23/id/335160/|website=Newsmax|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that many of the comforts and necessities we enjoy in the 21st century are predicated on electronics and their functioning, an EMP would disable hospitals, water treatment facilities, food storage facilities, and all electronic forms of communication. An EMP blast threatens the foundation which supports the existence of the modern human condition.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Certain EMP attacks could lead to large loss of power for months or years.&lt;ref name="EMP report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack|url=http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/security/has204000.000/has204000_0.HTM|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, failures of the power grid are dealt with using support from the outside. In the event of an EMP attack, such support would not exist and all damaged components, devices, and electronics would need to be completely replaced.

In 2013, the US House of Representatives considered the "Secure High-voltage Infrastructure for Electricity from Lethal Damage Act" that would provide surge protection for some 300 large transformers around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McCormack|first1=John |title=Lights out: House plan would protect nation's electricity from solar flare, nuclear bomb |date=2013-06-17 |url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/lights-out-house-plan-would-protect-nations-electricity-from-solar-flare-nuclear-bomb/article/2532038 |website=[[Washington Examiner]] |accessdate=2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of protecting civilian infrastructure from electromagnetic pulse has also been intensively studied throughout the European Union, and in particular by the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons
Defence Committee, [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmdfence/1552/1552.pdf "Developing Threats: Electro-Magnetic Pulses (EMP)"]. Tenth Report of Session 2010–12.&lt;/ref&gt; While precautions have been taken, James Woolsey and the EMP Commission suggested that an EMP is the most significant threat to the U.S.&lt;ref name="EMP report"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Woosley|first1=R. James |last2=Pry|first2=Peter Vincent |title=The Growing Threat From an EMP Attack |date=2014-08-12 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/james-woolsey-and-peter-vincent-pry-the-growing-threat-from-an-emp-attack-1407885281 |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=2016-01-16 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest threat to human survival in the aftermath of an EMP blast would be the inability to access clean drinking water. For comparison, in the aftermath of the 2010 Haitian earthquake, the water infrastructure had been devastated and led to at least 3,333 deaths from cholera in the first few months after the earthquake. Other countries would similarly see the resurgence of previously non-existent diseases as clean water becomes increasingly scarce.

The risk of an EMP, either through solar or atmospheric activity or enemy attack, while not dismissed, was suggested to be overblown by the news media in a commentary in ''[[Physics Today]]''.&lt;ref name="PT2016"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Steven T. |last1=Corneliussen |title=Conservative media sustain alarm about a possible electromagnetic-pulse catastrophe |date=2016-06-23 |doi=10.1063/PT.5.8178 |journal=[[Physics Today]] |url=http://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.5.8178/full |accessdate=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the weapons from rogue states were still too small and uncoordinated to cause a massive EMP, underground infrastructure is sufficiently protected, and there will be enough warning time from continuous solar observatories like [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] to protect surface transformers should a devastating solar storm be detected.&lt;ref name="PT2016"/&gt;

=== Nuclear fallout ===
{{Main|Nuclear fallout}}

Nuclear fallout is the residual radioactive dust and ash propelled into the upper atmosphere following a nuclear explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/Effects/effects17.shtml|title=Radioactive Fallout {{!}} Effects of Nuclear Weapons {{!}} atomicarchive.com|website=www.atomicarchive.com|access-date=2016-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fallout is usually limited to the immediate area, and can only spread for hundreds of miles from the explosion site if the explosion is high enough in the atmosphere. Fallout may get [[Entrainment (meteorology)|entrained]] with the products of a [[pyrocumulus]] cloud and fall as black rain&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://atomicbombmuseum.org/3_radioactivity.shtml|title=AtomicBombMuseum.org - Destructive Effects|website=atomicbombmuseum.org|access-date=2016-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; (rain darkened by soot and other particulates).

This radioactive dust, usually consisting of [[fission product]]s mixed with bystanding atoms that are [[neutron activation|neutron activated by exposure]], is a highly dangerous kind of [[radioactive contamination]]. The main radiation hazard from fallout is due to short-lived radionuclides external to the body.&lt;ref name="AtomicArchive"&gt;{{cite web|title=Radioactive Fallout|url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/Effects/effects17.shtml|website=Atomic Archive|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most of the particles carried by nuclear fallout decay rapidly, some radioactive particles will have half-lives of seconds to a few months. Some radioactive isotopes, like strontium 90 and cesium 137, are very long lived and will create radioactive hot spots for up to 5 years after the initial explosion.&lt;ref name="AtomicArchive"/&gt; Fallout and black rain may contaminate waterways, agriculture, and soil. Contact with radioactive materials can lead to radiation poisoning through external exposure or accidental consumption. In acute doses over a short amount of time radiation will lead to prodromal syndrome, bone marrow death, central nervous system death and gastrointestinal death.&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"&gt;Coggle, J.E., Lindop, Patricia J. "Medical Consequences of Radiation Following a Global Nuclear War." The Aftermath (1983): 60-71.&lt;/ref&gt; Over longer periods of exposure to radiation, cancer becomes the main health risk. Long term radiation exposure can also lead to in utero effects on human development and transgenerational genetic damage.&lt;ref name = "Coggle &amp; Lindop"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rerf.jp/radefx/genetics_e/birthdef.html|title=公益財団法人 放射線影響研究所 RERF|website=www.rerf.jp|accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and analysis of extinction hypotheses==
As a result of the extensive [[nuclear fallout]] of the 1954 [[Castle Bravo]] nuclear detonation, author [[Nevil Shute]] wrote the popular novel ''[[On the Beach (novel)|On the Beach]]'' which was released in 1957, in this novel so much fallout is generated in a nuclear war that all human life is extinguished. However the premise that all of humanity would die following a nuclear war and only the "cockroaches would survive" is critically dealt with in the 1988 book ''[[Philip J. Dolan#Unclassified publications|Would the Insects Inherit the Earth and Other Subjects of Concern to Those Who Worry About Nuclear War]]'' by nuclear weapons expert [[Philip J. Dolan]].

In 1982 [[nuclear disarmament]] activist [[Jonathan Schell]] published ''[[The Fate of the Earth]]'', which is regarded by many to be the first carefully argued presentation that concluded that extinction is a significant possibility from nuclear war. However, the assumptions made in this book have been thoroughly analyzed and determined to be "quite dubious".&lt;ref name="The fate of extinction arguments"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/83fea.html |title=The fate of extinction arguments|date=March 1983|author=Martin, Brian|publisher=Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science, Australian National University }}&lt;/ref&gt; The impetus for Schell's work, according to physicist Brian Martin, was to argue that "if the thought of 500 million people dying in a nuclear war is not enough to stimulate action, then the thought of extinction will. Indeed, Schell explicitly advocates use of the fear of extinction as the basis for inspiring the "complete rearrangement of world politics".&lt;ref name="The fate of extinction arguments"/&gt;

The belief in "overkill" is also commonly encountered, with an example being the following statement made by nuclear disarmament activist [[Philip Noel-Baker]] in 1971 – "Both the US and the Soviet Union now possess nuclear stockpiles large enough to exterminate mankind three or four – some say ten – times over". Brian Martin suggested that the origin of this belief was from "crude linear extrapolations", and when analyzed it has no basis in reality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Similarly, it is common to see stated that the combined explosive energy released in the entirety of [[World War II]] was about 3 megatons, while a nuclear war with warhead stockpiles at Cold War highs would release 6000 WWII's of explosive energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Willens, Harold |url=http://c-g-i.info/images/nuclear-weapons-chart.jpg |title=The Trimtab factor, 1984 |year=1990 |journal=Alternatives |volume=16|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimate for the necessary amount of fallout to begin to have the potential of causing human extinction is regarded by physicist and disarmament activist [[Joseph Rotblat]] to be 10 to 100 times the megatonnage in nuclear arsenals as they stood in 1976; however, with the world megatonnage decreasing since the Cold War ended this possibility remains hypothetical.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

According to the 1980 [[United Nations]] report ''General and Complete Disarmament: Comprehensive Study on Nuclear Weapons: Report of the Secretary-General'', it was estimated that there were a total of about 40,000 [[Historical nuclear weapons stockpiles and nuclear tests by country|nuclear warheads in existence]] at that time, with a potential combined explosive yield of approximately 13,000 [[TNT equivalent|megatons]].

By comparison, in the [[Timeline of volcanism on Earth]] when the volcano [[Mount Tambora]] erupted in 1815 – turning 1816 into the [[Year Without A Summer]] due to the levels of [[global dimming]] [[sulfate]] aerosols and ash expelled – it exploded with a force of roughly 800 to 1,000 megatons,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and ejected {{convert|160|km3|cumi|abbr=on}} of mostly rock/[[tephra]],&lt;ref name="Stothers1984"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The explosive energy of the eruption may have been as high as equivalent to 20,000,000 megatons (Mt) of TNT, while the [[Chicxulub impact]], connected with the extinction of the dinosaurs, corresponds to at least 70,000,000&amp;nbsp;Mt of energy, which is roughly 7000 times the maximum arsenal of the US and Soviet Union.

However, it must be noted that comparisons with [[supervolcanos]] are more misleading than helpful due to the different [[aerosol]]s released, the likely [[air burst]] fuzing height of nuclear weapons and the globally scattered location of these potential nuclear detonations all being in contrast to the singular and subterranean nature of a supervolcanic eruption.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Margulis, Lynn (1999). ''Symbiotic Planet: A New Look At Evolution''. Houston: Basic Book.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, assuming the entire world stockpile of weapons were grouped together, it would be difficult due to the [[nuclear fratricide]] effect to ensure the individual weapons would detonate all at once. Nonetheless, many people believe that a full-scale nuclear war would result, through the nuclear winter effect, in the [[human extinction|extinction of the human species]], though not all analysts agree on the assumptions inputted into these nuclear winter models.&lt;ref name="bmartin.cc"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4200">In mathematics, the '''Poincaré–Miranda theorem''' is a generalization of the [[intermediate value theorem]], from a single function in a single dimension, to {{mvar|n}} functions in {{mvar|n}} dimensions. It says as follows:

::Consider &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; continuous functions of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables, &lt;math&gt;f_1,\ldots, f_n&lt;/math&gt;. Assume that for each variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; is constantly negative when &lt;math&gt;x_i=-1&lt;/math&gt; and constantly positive when &lt;math&gt;x_i=1&lt;/math&gt;. Then there is a point in the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[cube]] &lt;math&gt;[-1,1]^n&lt;/math&gt; in which all functions are ''simultaneously'' equal to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

The theorem is named after [[Henri Poincaré]], who conjectured it in 1883, and [[Carlo Miranda]], who in 1940 showed that it is equivalent to the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Kulpa|1997|p=545}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intuitive description==
{{Plain image with caption|image=PoincareMiranda.png|caption=A graphical representation of Poincaré–Miranda theorem for {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;2}}|width=350px|align=right|caption position=bottom|triangle=triangle}}
The picture on the right shows an illustration of the Poincaré–Miranda theorem for {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;2}} functions. Consider a couple of functions {{math|(''f'',''g'')}} whose [[Domain of a function|domain of definition]] is the {{math|[-1,+1]{{sup|2}}}} square. The function {{mvar|f}} is negative on the left boundary and positive on the right boundary (green sides of the square), while the function {{mvar|g}} is negative on the lower boundary and positive on the upper boundary (red sides of the square). When we go from left to right along ''any'' path, we must go through a point in which {{mvar|f}} is {{math|0}}. Therefore, there must be a "wall" separating the left from the right, along which {{mvar|f}} is {{math|0}} (green curve inside the square). Similarly, there must be a "wall" separating the top from the bottom, along which {{mvar|g}} is {{math|0}} (red curve inside the square). These walls must intersect in a point in which both functions are {{math|0}} (blue point inside the square).

==Generalizations==
The simplest generalization, as a matter of fact a [[corollary]], of this theorem is the following one. 
For every variable {{math|''x{{sub|i}}''}}, let {{math|''a{{sub|i}}''}} be any value in the range
{{math|[sup{{sub|''x{{sub|i}}''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;0}}&amp;nbsp;''f{{sub|i}}'',&amp;nbsp;inf{{sub|''x{{sub|i}}''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;1}}&amp;nbsp;''f{{sub|i}}'']}}.
Then there is a point in the unit cube in which for all {{mvar|i}}: 
:&lt;math&gt;f_i=a_i&lt;/math&gt;.  

The this statement can be reduced to the original one by a simple [[translation of axes]],
:&lt;math&gt;x^\prime_i=x_i\qquad y^\prime_i=y_i-a_i\qquad \forall i\in\{1,\dots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;
where
*{{math|''x{{sub|i}}''}} are the [[coordinates]] in the domain of the function
*{{math|''y{{sub|i}}''}} are the coordinates in the [[codomain]] of the function

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2588">The '''Pontiac Hispanic History Project''' is the result of a committee’s effort to gather and catalog the Latino history of the city of [[Pontiac, Michigan]].

&lt;/ref&gt;

The project actively documents and researches the earliest Puerto Rican and Mexican immigrants that came to Pontiac in the 1940s and 1920s respectively. They maintain a growing library of newspaper clippings, personal photographs, and audio and video recordings, as well as acquisitions from the defunct Pontiac Latin Affairs Office. Plans encompass cataloging the archives of the Azteca Boxing Center, a local boxing training facility.

==Origins==
Martha says she was prompted to begin the project after trying to organize her husband’s old papers. [[H. Tomàs Padilla|Hector Padilla]], a native Puerto Rican, had passed on and she felt that the history contained in papers from his tenure as the first Latino city commissioner, as well as lobbying for migrant worker conditions and his efforts in forming the [[Hispanic Congressional Caucus]], were important to the community and needed to be put somewhere.

The effort of Martha was expanded as she realized that others in the Latino community deserve recognition. Fear that the records of who has done what would be lost spurred Willie Martinez and others to join Padilla in gathering stories and history of the Pontiac Latino community at large.

==Location==
The findings will be presented to the Burton Historical Collection at the Detroit Public Library on 08 Oct. 2008.&lt;ref name="Presentation"&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasis was given to making sure any findings were collected and presented to Burton Collection rather than being "...stored in someone's garage or basement".&lt;ref name="Presentation" /&gt;

[[File:HRDiagram.png|thumb|upright=1.4|The red clump is the prominent group of [[red giant]] stars at about 5,000 K and {{solar luminosity|75}}.]]
The '''red clump''' is a clustering of [[red giant]]s in the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] at around 5,000 K and [[absolute magnitude]] (M&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;) +0.5, slightly hotter than most [[red giant branch|red-giant-branch]] stars of the same luminosity.  It is visible as a more dense region of the red giant branch or a bulge towards hotter temperatures.  It is most distinct in many, but not all, galactic [[open cluster]]s, but it is also noticeable in many intermediate-age [[globular cluster]]s and in nearby field stars (e.g. the Hipparcos stars).

The red clump giants are cool [[horizontal branch]] stars, stars originally similar to the Sun which have undergone a [[helium flash]] and are now [[helium fusion|fusing helium]] in their cores.

==Properties==
Red clump stellar properties vary depending on their origin, most notably on the [[metallicity]] of the stars, but typically they have early K spectral types and [[effective temperature]]s around 5,000 K.  The absolute [[visual magnitude]] of red clump giants near the sun has been measured at an average of +0.81 with metallicities between &amp;minus;0.6 and +0.4 dex.&lt;ref name=soubirain&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20021615|title=Vertical distribution of Galactic disk stars|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=398|pages=141|year=2003|last1=Soubiran|first1=C.|last2=Bienaymé|first2=O.|last3=Siebert|first3=A.|arxiv = astro-ph/0210628 |bibcode = 2003A&amp;A...398..141S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a considerable spread in the properties of red clump stars even within a single population of similar stars such as an open cluster.  This is partly due to the natural variation in temperatures and luminosities of horizontal branch stars when they form and as they evolve, and partly due to the presence of other stars with similar properties.&lt;ref name=girardi&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1999MNRAS.308..818G|arxiv=astro-ph/9901319|title=A secondary clump of red giant stars: Why and where|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=308|issue=3|pages=818|author1=Girardi|first1=Léo|year=1999|doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.1999.02746.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although red clump stars are generally hotter than red-giant-branch stars, the two regions overlap and the status of individual stars can only be assigned with a detailed chemical abundance study.&lt;ref name=ree/&gt;&lt;ref name=nataf&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2010ApJ...721L..28N|arxiv=1007.5065|title=The Split Red Clump of the Galactic Bulge from OGLE-III|journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters|volume=721|pages=L28|author1=Nataf|first1=D.

==Evolution==
{{main article|Horizontal branch}}
[[File:Open cluster HR diagram ages.gif|thumb|upright=1.0|Old open clusters showing barely detectable red clumps&lt;ref name=WIYN&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1999AJ....118.2321S|title=WIYN Open Cluster Study. III. The Observed Variation of the Red Clump Luminosity and Color with Metallicity and Age|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=118|issue=5|pages=2321|author1=Sarajedini|first1=Ata|year=1999|doi=10.1086/301112}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Modelling of the horizontal branch has shown that stars have a strong tendency to cluster at the cool end of the zero age horizontal branch (ZAHB).  This tendency is weaker in low metallicity stars, so the red clump is usually more prominent in metal-rich clusters.  However, there are other effects, and there are well-populated red clumps in some metal-poor globular clusters.&lt;ref name=zhao&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2001ApJ...551L..85Z|title=High-Resolution Spectroscopic Observations of Hipparcos Red Clump Giants: Metallicity and Mass Determinations|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=551|pages=L85|author1=Zhao|first1=G.|last2=Qiu|first2=H. M.|last3=Mao|first3=Shude|year=2001|doi=10.1086/319832}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dantona&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2004ApJ...611..871D|arxiv=astro-ph/0405016|title=The Early Evolution of Globular Clusters: The Case of NGC 2808|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=611|issue=2|pages=871|author1=d'Antona|first1=Francesca|last2=Caloi|first2=Vittoria|year=2004|doi=10.1086/422334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stars with a similar mass to the sun evolve towards the tip of the red giant branch with a [[degenerate matter|degenerate]] helium core.  More massive stars leave the red giant branch early and perform a blue loop, but all stars with a degenerate core reach the tip with very similar core masses, temperatures, and luminosities.  After the helium flash they lie along the ZAHB, all with helium cores just under {{solar mass|0.5}} and their properties determined mostly by the size of the hydrogen envelope outside the core.  Lower envelope masses result in weaker [[CNO cycle|hydrogen shell fusion]] and give hotter and slightly less luminous stars strung along the horizontal branch.  Different initial masses and natural variations in mass loss rates on the red giant branch cause the variations in the envelope masses even though the helium cores are all the same size.  Low-metallicity stars are more sensitive to the size of the hydrogen envelope, so with the same envelope masses they are spread further along the horizontal branch and fewer fall in the red clump.

Although red clump stars lie consistently to the hot side of the red giant branch that they evolved from, red clump and red-giant-branch stars from different populations can overlap.  This occurs in [[Omega Centauri|ω Centauri]] where metal-poor red-giant-branch stars have the same or hotter temperatures as more metal-rich red clump giants.&lt;ref name=ree&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2002ASPC..265..101R|title=Synthetic Color-Magnitude Diagrams for ω Centauri and Other Massive Globular Clusters with Multiple Populations|journal=Omega Centauri|volume=265|pages=101|author1=Ree|first1=C. H.|last2=Yoon|first2=S.-J.|last3=Rey|first3=S.-C.|last4=Lee|first4=Y.-W.|year=2002|arxiv = astro-ph/0110689 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other stars, not strictly horizontal branch stars, can lie in the same region of the H-R diagram.  Stars too massive to develop a degenerate helium core on the red giant branch will ignite helium before the [[tip of the red giant branch]] and perform a blue loop.  For stars only a little more massive than the sun, around {{solar mass|2}}, the blue loop is very short and at a luminosity similar to the red clump giants.  These stars are an order of magnitude less common than sun-like stars, even rarer compared to the sub-solar stars that can form red clump giants, and the duration of the blue loop is far less than the time spent by a red clump giant on the horizontal branch.  This means that these imposters are much less common in the H-R diagram, but still detectable.&lt;ref name=girardi/&gt;

Stars with {{solar mass|2 - 3}} will also pass through the red clump as they evolve along the [[subgiant branch]].  This is again a very rapid phase of [[stellar evolution|evolution]], but stars such as [[OU Andromedae]] are found in the red clump region (5,500&amp;nbsp;K and {{solar luminosity|100}}) even though it is thought to be a subgiant crossing the [[Hertzsprung gap]].&lt;ref name=girardi/&gt;

==Standard candles==
In theory, the [[bolometric luminosity|absolute luminosities]] of stars in the red clump are fairly independent of stellar composition or age so that consequently they make good [[standard candle]]s for estimating astronomical distances both within our galaxy and to nearby galaxies and clusters.  Variations due to metallicity, mass, age, and [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinctions]] affect visual observations too much for them to be useful, but the effects are much smaller in the infrared.  [[Near infrared]] [[Photometric system#Photometric letters|I band]] observations in particular have been used to establish red clump distances.  Absolute magnitudes for the red clump at solar metallicity have been measured at &amp;minus;0.22 in the [[UBVRI|I band]] and &amp;minus;1.54 in the [[K band (infrared)|K band]].&lt;ref name=groenewegen&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:200810201|title=The red clump absolute magnitude based on revised Hipparcos parallaxes|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=488|issue=3|pages=935|year=2008|last1=Groenewegen|first1=M. A. T.|arxiv = 0807.2764 |bibcode = 2008A&amp;A...488..935G }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The distance to the [[galactic centre]] has been measured in this way, giving a result of 7.52 kpc in agreement with other methods.&lt;ref name=nishiyama&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2006ApJ...647.1093N|arxiv=astro-ph/0607408|title=The Distance to the Galactic Center Derived from Infrared Photometry of Bulge Red Clump Stars|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=647|issue=2|pages=1093|author1=Nishiyama|first1=Shogo|last2=Nagata|first2=Tetsuya|last3=Sato|first3=Shuji|last4=Kato|first4=Daisuke|last5=Nagayama|first5=Takahiro|last6=Kusakabe|first6=Nobuhiko|last7=Matsunaga|first7=Noriyuki|last8=Naoi|first8=Takahiro|last9=Sugitani|first9=Koji|last10=Tamura|first10=Motohide|year=2006|doi=10.1086/505529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Red bump==
The red clump should not be confused with the "red bump" or red-giant-branch bump, which is a less noticeable clustering of giants partway along the [[red giant branch]], caused as stars ascending the red giant branch temporarily decrease in luminosity because of internal convection.&lt;ref name=alves&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1999ApJ...511..225A|title=The Age-dependent Luminosities of the Red Giant Branch Bump, Asymptotic Giant Branch Bump, and Horizontal Branch Red Clump|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=511|pages=225|author1=Alves|first1=David R.|last2=Sarajedini|first2=Ata|year=1999|doi=10.1086/306655|arxiv = astro-ph/9808253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

'''Salsabil''' ({{lang-ar|سلسبيل}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Salsabīl}}'') is an [[Islam]]ic [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term referring to a [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] in [[paradise]] ([[Jannah]]). It can also mean river or fountain in paradise. The sole [[Qur'an]]ic reference is in [[sura]] [[Al-Insaan]]. Salsabil can also be written as Salsabiil or even Salsabeel but "Salsabiil" is the most common name.

{{quote|"And there they will be given a cup whose mixture is of Zanjabil (ginger). A fountain there, called Salsabil."| Qur'an, sura 76 (Al-Insaan), [[ayat]] 17-18&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|76|17|e=18|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The verse may be in reference to the previous verse concerning the drink provided to those who enter paradise.

Salsabil is also the name of one of the old neighborhoods in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12628">'''Strain engineering''' refers to a general strategy employed in [[semiconductor]] manufacturing to enhance device performance.  Performance benefits are achieved by modulating [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] in the [[transistor]] channel, which enhances [[electron mobility]] (or hole mobility) and thereby [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] through the channel.

==Strain engineering in CMOS manufacturing==

The use of various strain engineering techniques has been reported by many prominent [[microprocessor]] manufacturers, including [[AMD]], [[IBM]], and [[Intel]], primarily with regards to sub-130&amp;nbsp;nm technologies.  One key consideration in using strain engineering in CMOS technologies is that PMOS and NMOS respond differently to different types of strain.  Specifically, PMOS performance is best served by applying compressive strain to the channel, whereas NMOS receives benefit from tensile strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realworldtech.com/page.cfm?ArticleID=RWT123005001504&amp;p=6|title=IEDM 2005: Selected Coverage|date=30 December 2005|last=Wang|first=David|website=Real World Technologies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many approaches to strain engineering induce strain locally, allowing both n-channel and p-channel strain to be modulated independently.

One prominent approach involves the use of a strain-inducing capping layer.  CVD silicon nitride is a common choice for a strained capping layer, in that the magnitude and type of strain (e.g. tensile vs compressive) may be adjusted by modulating the deposition conditions, especially temperature.&lt;ref name="Martyniuk"&gt;Martyniuk, M, Antoszewski, J. Musca, C.A., Dell, J.M.,  Faraone, L.  Smart Mater. Struct.  '''15''' (2006)  S29-S38)&lt;/ref&gt;  Standard lithography patterning techniques can be used to selectively deposit strain-inducing capping layers, to deposit a compressive film over only the PMOS, for example.

Capping layers are key to the ''Dual Stress Liner'' (DSL) approach reported by IBM-AMD.  In the DSL process, standard patterning and [[lithography]] techniques are used to selectively deposit a tensile silicon nitride film over the NMOS and a compressive silicon nitride film over the PMOS.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

A second prominent approach involves the use of a silicon-rich solid solution, especially silicon-[[germanium]], to modulate channel strain.  One manufacturing method involves epitaxial growth of silicon on top of a relaxed silicon-germanium underlayer.  Tensile strain is induced in the silicon as the lattice of the silicon layer is stretched to mimic the larger [[lattice constant]] of the underlying silicon-germanium.  Conversely, compressive strain could be induced by using a solid solution with a smaller lattice constant, such as silicon-carbon.  See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 7,023,018.  Another closely related method involves replacing the source and drain region of a [[MOSFET]] with silicon-germanium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20040228/bob8.asp|title=Straining for Speed|date=28 February 2004|last=Weiss|first=Peter|work=Science News Online|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050912072126/http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20040228/bob8.asp|archive-date=12 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
Strain engineering in CMOS processes falls into two major categories{ref|Ghyselen, Bruno Mat Sci Eng B  124-125 (2005) 16-23}:
*Localized Approaches
Localized strain engineering introduces strain to the transistor channel via manufacturing steps. 
Prominent approaches include capping layer deposition (especially silicon nitride) and SiGe or SiC source/drain formation.  One advantage of localized approaches is that strain engineering may be applied to NMOS and PMOS devices independently, as in the [[dual stress]] liner approach engineered by IBM-AMD.  
*Global Approaches
Global strain engineering modulates strain by inducing strain in bulk silicon.  One common approach to bulk strained silicon formation is via heteroepitaxial growth on a relaxed SiGe layer.  Other alternatives include the strained-layer on insulator approaches such as SiGe-on-insulator.--&gt;

==Strain engineering in thin films==
Epitaxial strain in thin films generally arises due to lattice mismatch between the film and its substrate, and can arise either during film growth or due to thermal expansion mismatch. Tuning this epitaxial strain can be used to moderate the properties of thin films and induce phase transitions. The misfit parameter (&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;) is given by the equation below:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bertoli|first=B.|last2=Sidoti|first2=D.|last3=Xhurxhi|first3=S.|last4=Kujofsa|first4=T.|last5=Cheruku|first5=S.|last6=Correa|first6=J. P.|last7=Rago|first7=P. B.|last8=Suarez|first8=E. N.|last9=Jain|first9=F. C.|date=2010|title=Equilibrium strain and dislocation density in exponentially graded Si(1-x)Gex/Si (001)|url=|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=108|pages=11325|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f=(a_s - a_e)/a_e&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_e &lt;/math&gt; is the lattice parameter of the epitaxial film and &lt;math&gt;a_s&lt;/math&gt; is the lattice parameter of the substrate. After some critical film thickness, it becomes energetically favorable to relieve some mismatch strain through the formation of misfit dislocations or microtwins. Misfit dislocations can be interpreted as a dangling bond at an interface between layers with different lattice constants. This critical thickness (&lt;math&gt;h_c&lt;/math&gt;) was computed by Mathews and Blakeslee to be:

&lt;math&gt;h_c = \frac{b(2-\nu cos^2\alpha)[ln(h_c/b)+1]}{8\pi |f|(1+\nu)cos\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the Burgers vector, &lt;math&gt;\nu
&lt;/math&gt; is the Poisson ratio, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the Burgers vector and misfit dislocation line, and &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the Burgers vector and the vector normal to the dislocation's glide plane. The equilibrium in-plane strain for a thin film with a thickness (&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;) that exceeds &lt;math&gt;h_c&lt;/math&gt; is then given by the expression:

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{||} = \frac{f}{|f|}\frac{b(1-\nu cos^2(\alpha)[ln(h/b) +1]}{8\pi |f| (1+\nu)cos\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

Strain relaxation at thin film interfaces via misfit dislocation nucleation and multiplication occurs in three stages which are distinguishable based on the relaxation rate. The first stage is dominated by glide of pre-existing dislocations and is characterized by a slow relaxation rate. The second stage has a faster relaxation rate, which depends on the mechanisms for dislocation nucleation in the material. Finally, the last stage represents a saturation in strain relaxation due to strain hardening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Zhmakin|first=A. I.|date=2011|title=Strain relaxation models|eprint=1102.5000|volume=|pages=|via=|class=cond-mat.mtrl-sci}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strain engineering has been well-studied in complex oxide systems, in which epitaxial strain can strongly influence the coupling between the spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom, and thereby impact the electrical and magnetic properties. Epitaxial strain has been shown to induce metal-insulator transitions and shift the Curie temperature for the antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition in &lt;chem&gt;La_{1-x}Sr_{x}MnO_{3}&lt;/chem&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Razavi|first=F.

This is explained as a coupling between the imposed epitaxial strain and the system’s composition-dependent elastic properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/09500839.2014.968652|last=Lahiri|first=A.|last2=Abinandanan|first2=T.

The '''Subansiri Lower Dam''', officially named '''Subansiri Lower Hydroelectric Project''' (SLHEP), is an under construction [[gravity dam]] on the [[Subansiri River]] in NorthEastern India. It is located {{convert|2.3|km|abbr=on}} upstream of Gerukamukh village in [[Dhemaji]] District and [[Lower Subansiri District]] on the border of [[Assam]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. Described as a [[run-of-the-river]] project by [[NHPC Limited]], the Project is expected to supply 2,000&amp;nbsp;MW of power when completed.&lt;ref name=NHPCIndia/&gt; The project has experienced several problems during construction to include landslides, re-design and opposition. It was expected to be complete in 2018. It is notable that, if completed as planned, it will be the largest hydroelectric project in India.&lt;ref name="TNN"&gt;

The concrete [[gravity dam]] is designed to be {{convert|116|m|abbr=on}} tall, measured from the river bed and{{convert|130|m|abbr=on}} from foundation. Its length will be {{Convert|284|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and the dam will have a structural volume of {{Convert|2250000|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}}. The reservoir created by the dam will have a gross storage capacity of {{Convert|1.37|km3|acre.ft|0|abbr=on|lk=out}}, of which {{Convert|.44|km3|acre.ft|0|abbr=on|lk=out}} can be used for power generation or irrigation. At normal level, the reservoir's surface will cover {{Convert|33.5|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. The surface [[power station|powerhouse]], located on the left bank, will contain eight 250&amp;nbsp;MW [[Francis turbine]] generators.&lt;ref name=register/&gt;&lt;ref name=NHPCIndia&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to Subansiri (Lower) Project|url=http://www.nhpcindia.com/Projects/english/Scripts/Prj_Introduction.aspx?Vid=23|publisher=NHPC India|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There will be eight horse shoe shaped [[Tailrace#Headrace.2C tailrace|head race]] tunnels, each being {{convert|9.5|m|abbr=on}} in diameter and having a length from {{convert|608|-|1168|m|abbr=on}}.

==Construction==
Construction of Subansiri Lower Project involves many challenges. These include land not being available when construction was scheduled to commence, a limited annual construction time because of monsoons (from mid-April to mid-October), the need to handle high flood flows and poor rock conditions. The design of the dam has undergone drastic and repeated revisions that have affected the schedule and planning of the construction work.&lt;ref name="HW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hydroworld.com/index/display/article-display/9303458802/articles/hydro-review-worldwide/Vol-20/issue-1/articles/dam-design/Planning-and-Building.html|title=Planning and Building the Subansiri Lower Dam and Hydro Project|author= Biswajit Das|publisher=PennWell Corporation|accessdate=7 March 2012|work=HydroWorld|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2003 the contract to build the dam and its associated structures was awarded to a consortium of Boguchandgesstroy, Soyuzgidrosptsstry and Soma Enterprise Ltd. Due to difficulties acquiring land around the site, construction could not begin in earnest until 13 months after the contract was awarded. Unexpected geological conditions at the dam site led to landslides and slower tunnel excavation. By November 2007, the river was successfully diverted and in April of the next year, the foundation was clear for construction. Before the foundation was fully prepared it was discovered that bedrock was reached {{Convert|10|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} sooner than expected. This led to an alteration in the dam's design for stability. While the dam was being re-designed, concrete was placed over the foundation to protect it from the upcoming monsoon floods as the [[cofferdam]]s stood a good chance of not protecting the foundation from the strong floods. The re-design was completed in October 2008 and soon after the foundation was once again cleared. In May 2009, work was suspended because of the monsoon season and re-commenced in November of that year.&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt;

As of November 2011, the dam reached an elevation of {{convert|138|m|abbr=on}}, just below the spillway elevation of {{convert|145|m|abbr=on}}. On 16 December 2011, construction equipment was halted by protests.&lt;ref name="CD"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction cost has gone up by about {{INR}}1,200 crore owing to forced suspension of work since December 2011. NHPC has already spent about {{INR}}6,600 crore, according to a status report prepared by the company.&lt;ref name="bp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Subansiri Project dispute to be resolved through negotiations|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/07/subansiri-project-dispute-to-be-resolved-through-negotiations/|work=IANS|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commissioning of the first generator is loosely expected to occur in 2016 with the final generator in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cea.nic.in/reports/proj_mon/status_he_execution.pdf | title=Status of Hydro Electric Projects under Execution for 12th Plan &amp; beyond | publisher=Central Electric Authority - India | date=31 March 2014 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715003433/http://www.cea.nic.in/reports/proj_mon/status_he_execution.pdf | archivedate=15 July 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==
Some [[environmental impact of reservoirs|environmental impacts]] unique to very large dams will result from completion of the Subansiri Project, both upstream and downstream of the dam site. These impacts will include [[Hydroelectricity#Ecosystem damage though nominal and loss of land|ecosystem damage and loss of land]].

The reservoir of the Subansiri Project will submerge a {{convert|47|km|abbr=on}} length of the Subansiri river and occupy {{convert|37.5|-|40|km2|abbr=on}} which includes [[Himalayan subtropical pine forests]], [[Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests]], part of the Tale Valley Wildlife Sanctuary, an [[wildlife corridor|elephant corridor]] and some [[subsistence agriculture]] fields.&lt;ref name="DRP"&gt;

[[File:Hazy Crazy Sunrise.jpg|thumb|300px|Hazy summer sunrise over the [[Mojave Desert]]]]

'''Sunrise''' or '''sun up''' is the moment when the upper limb of the [[Sun]] appears on the [[horizon]] in the [[morning]].&lt;ref name="Navy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/RST_defs.php |publisher=[[U.S. Naval Observatory]] |title=Rise, Set, and Twilight Definitions}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term can also refer to the entire process of the solar disk crossing the horizon and its accompanying [[atmospheric optics|atmospheric effects]].&lt;ref name="mw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sunrise |title=Sunrise |work=[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==

==="Rise"===
Although the Sun appears to "rise" from the horizon, it is actually the ''Earth's'' motion that causes the Sun to appear. The illusion of a moving Sun results from Earth observers being in a [[rotating reference frame]]; this apparent motion is so convincing that most cultures had mythologies and religions built around the [[geocentric]] model, which prevailed until astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] first formulated the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.discovery.com/top-ten/2009/science-mistakes/science-mistakes-02.html The Earth Is the Center of the Universe: Top 10 Science Mistakes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Architect [[Buckminster Fuller]] proposed the terms "sunsight" and "sunclipse" to better represent the heliocentric model, though the terms have not entered into common language.

===Beginning and end===
Astronomically, sunrise occurs for only an instant: the moment at which the upper limb of the Sun appears tangent to the horizon.&lt;ref name="Navy"/&gt; However, the term ''sunrise'' commonly refers to periods of time both before and after this point:
*[[Twilight]], the period in the morning during which the sky is [[sky brightness|brightening]], but the Sun is not yet visible. The beginning of morning twilight is called ''astronomical [[dawn]]''.
*The period after the Sun rises during which striking colors and atmospheric effects are still seen.&lt;ref name="mw"/&gt;

==Measurement==
[[File:Sunrise-Sunset angle.svg|right|thumb|400px|This diagram of the Sun at [[false sunrise|sunrise]] (or [[false sunset|sunset]]) shows the effects of [[atmospheric refraction]].]]

===Angle===
[[false sunrise|Sunrise]] actually occurs ''before'' the Sun truly reaches the horizon because [[Earth's atmosphere]] [[atmospheric refraction|refracts]] the Sun's image. At the horizon, the average amount of refraction is 34 [[arcminute]]s, though this amount varies based on atmospheric conditions.&lt;ref name="Navy"/&gt;

Also, unlike most other solar measurements, sunrise occurs when the Sun's ''upper limb'', rather than its center, appears to cross the horizon. The apparent radius of the Sun at the horizon is 16 arcminutes.&lt;ref name="Navy"/&gt;

These two angles combine to define sunrise to occur when the Sun's center is 50 arcminutes below the horizon, or 90.83° from the [[zenith]].&lt;ref name="Navy"/&gt;

===Time of day===
The timing of sunrise varies throughout the year and is also affected by the viewer's longitude and latitude, altitude, and time zone. These changes are driven by the [[axial tilt]] of Earth, daily rotation of the Earth, the planet's movement in its annual [[ellipse|elliptical]] orbit around the Sun, and the Earth and Moon's paired revolutions around each other. The [[analemma]] can be used to make approximate predictions of the time of sunrise.

[[File:Sunrise - Libreville, Gabon - 2008.svg|thumb|left|350px|Time of sunrise in 2008 for [[Libreville]], [[Gabon]]. Near the equator, the variation of the time of sunrise is mainly governed by the variation of the [[equation of time]]. See [[:File:Sunrise - Dakar, Senegal - 2008.svg|here]] for the sunrise chart of a different location.]]

In late winter and spring, sunrise as seen from temperate latitudes occurs earlier each day, reaching its earliest time near the [[summer solstice]]; although the exact date varies by latitude. After this point, the time of sunrise gets later each day, reaching its latest sometime around the [[winter solstice]]. The offset between the dates of the solstice and the earliest or latest sunrise time is caused by the eccentricity of Earth's orbit and the tilt of its axis, and is described by the [[analemma]], which can be used to predict the dates.

Variations in atmospheric refraction can alter the time of sunrise by changing its apparent position. Near the poles, the time-of-day variation is exaggerated, since the Sun crosses the horizon at a very shallow angle and thus rises more slowly.&lt;ref name="Navy"/&gt;

Accounting for atmospheric refraction and measuring from the leading edge slightly increases the average duration of [[daylight|day]] relative to [[night]]. The [[sunrise equation]], however, which is used to derive the time of sunrise and sunset, uses the Sun's physical center for calculation, neglecting atmospheric refraction and the non-zero angle subtended by the solar disc.

===Location on the horizon===
Neglecting the effects of refraction and the Sun's non-zero size, whenever sunrise occurs, in temperate regions it is always in the northeast quadrant from the March equinox to the September equinox and in the southeast quadrant from the September equinox to the March equinox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/our-solar-system/the-moon/46-our-solar-system/the-moon/observing-the-moon/128-how-does-the-position-of-moonrise-and-moonset-change-intermediate |title=Curious About Astronomy: How does the position of Moonrise and Moonset change? |work=Curious About Astronomy? Ask an Astronomer |publisher=Cornell University Astronomy Department |author=Karen Masters |date=October 2004 |accessdate=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sunrises occur approximately due east on the March and September equinoxes for all viewers on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://solar-center.stanford.edu/AO/sunrise.html |publisher=Stanford Solar Center |title=Where Do the Sun and Stars Rise? |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exact calculations of the [[azimuth]]s of sunrise on other dates are complex, but they can be estimated with reasonable accuracy by using the [[analemma]].

{{see also|Atmospheric optics}}
Air molecules and [[Aerosol|airborne particles]] scatter white sunlight as it passes through the Earth's atmosphere. This is done by a combination of [[Rayleigh scattering]] and [[Mie scattering]].&lt;ref name=saha&gt;{{cite book
|author=K. Saha
|title=The Earth's Atmosphere – Its Physics and Dynamics
|date=2008
|publisher=Springer
|isbn=978-3-540-78426-5
|page=107
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a ray of white sunlight travels through the atmosphere to an observer, some of the colors are scattered out of the beam by air molecules and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particles]], changing the final color of the beam the viewer sees.
Because the shorter wavelength components, such as blue and green, scatter more strongly,
these colors are preferentially removed from the beam.&lt;ref name=saha/&gt;

At sunrise and sunset, when the path through the atmosphere is longer, the blue and green components are removed almost completely leaving the longer wavelength orange and red [[hue]]s seen at those times. The remaining reddened sunlight can then be scattered by cloud droplets and other relatively large particles to light up the horizon red and orange.&lt;ref name=guenther&gt;{{cite book

Sunset colors are typically more brilliant than sunrise colors, because the evening air contains more particles than morning air.&lt;ref name="saha"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guenther"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bohren/&gt;&lt;ref name="hecht"/&gt;

[[Image:Unrest_Sea_During_Sunrise_In_Sydney.jpg|right|thumb|Peach sunrise over the sea, Sydney, Australia]]
Ash from volcanic eruptions, trapped within the [[troposphere]], tends to mute sunset and sunrise colors, while volcanic ejecta that is instead lofted into the [[stratosphere]] (as thin clouds of tiny sulfuric acid droplets), can yield beautiful post-sunset colors called [[afterglow]]s and pre-sunrise glows. A number of eruptions, including those of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in 1991 and [[Krakatoa]] in 1883, have produced sufficiently high stratospheric sulfuric acid clouds to yield remarkable sunset afterglows (and pre-sunrise glows) around the world. The high altitude clouds serve to reflect strongly reddened sunlight still striking the stratosphere after sunset, down to the surface.

===Optical illusions and other phenomena===
[[Image:False Sunrise.jpg|thumb|right|This is a [[False sunrise|''False Sunrise'']], a very particular kind of [[Parhelion]]]]
*[[Atmospheric refraction]] causes the Sun to be seen while it is still below the horizon.
* Light from the lower edge of the Sun's disk is refracted more than light from the upper edge. This reduces the apparent height of the Sun when it appears just above the horizon. The width is not affected, so the Sun appears wider than it is high.
*The Sun appears larger at sunrise than it does while higher in the sky, in a manner similar to the [[moon illusion]].
*The Sun appears to rise above the horizon and circle the Earth, but it is actually the Earth that is rotating, with the Sun remaining fixed. This effect results from the fact that an observer on Earth is in a [[rotating reference frame]].
*Occasionally a ''[[false sunrise]]'' occurs, demonstrating a very particular kind of [[Parhelion]] belonging to the optical phenomenon family of [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]]s.
*Sometimes just before sunrise or after sunset a [[green flash]] can be seen. This is an optical phenomenon in which a green spot is visible above the sun, usually for no more than a second or two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/redsun.html|title=Red Sunset, Green Flash}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This page documents the '''[[tornado]]es and [[tornado outbreak]]s of 1965''', primarily in the United States. Most tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally. Tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes.

[[Image:CV100f (2).JPG|thumb|upright|Trigatron CV100, with wire mesh to contain any explosion]]
A '''trigatron''' is a type of triggerable [[spark gap]] switch designed for high current and high voltage, (usually 10-100 kV and 20-100 kA, though devices in the mega-ampere range exist as well). It has very simple construction and in many cases is the lowest cost high energy switching option. It may operate in open air, it may be sealed, or it may be filled with a [[dielectric gas]] other than air or a [[liquid dielectric]]. The dielectric gas may be pressurized, or a liquid dielectric (e.g. [[mineral oil]]) may be substituted to further extend the operating voltage. Trigatrons may be rated for repeated use (over 10,000 switching cycles), or they may be single-shot, destroyed in a single use.

A trigatron has three electrodes. The heavy main electrodes are for the high current switching path, and a smaller third electrode serves as the trigger. During normal operation, the voltage between the main electrodes is somewhat lower than the [[breakdown voltage]] corresponding to their distance and the dielectric between them (usually [[air]], [[argon]]-[[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], or [[sulfur hexafluoride]]).  To switch the device, a high voltage pulse is delivered to the triggering electrode. This ionizes the medium between it and one of the main electrodes, creating a [[Electrostatic_discharge#Sparks|spark]] which shortens the thickness of non-ionized medium between the electrodes. The triggering spark also generates [[ultraviolet light]] and free electrons in the main gap. These lead to the rapid [[electrical breakdown]] of the main gap, culminating in a low resistance [[electric arc]] between the main electrodes. The arc will continue to conduct until current flow drops sufficiently to extinguish it.

The triggering electrode is most often mounted through a hole in the center of the positive main electrode. The undrilled main electrode is the negative electrode. When switching high currents, the electrodes undergo considerable heat stress, as they are directly involved in the electric arc. This causes the surfaces to undergo gradual vaporization, so some designs incorporate methods to easily adjust the distance between the electrodes or to actually replace the electrodes. The main electrodes are typically fabricated from [[brass]], or alloys of [[copper]] and [[tungsten]] for longer electrode life. 

Glass trigatrons are often enclosed in a woven wire mesh, to provide protection from fragmentation if the device explodes due to internal overpressure.

Trigatrons find many different uses in [[pulsed power]] applications. For example, they were used in early [[radar]] [[modulator]]s to feed the high-power pulses into the [[magnetron]]s, for use with [[slapper detonator]]s, or for triggering a [[Marx generator]].

A '''truss''' is a tight bundle of [[hay]] or [[straw]].  It would usually be [[cuboid]], for storage or shipping, and would either be harvested into such bundles or cut from a large rick.

==Markets and law==
[[File:Robert Polhill Bevan - Hay Carts, Cumberland Market - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Hay carts in [[Cumberland Market]], painted by [[Robert Polhill Bevan]] in 1915]]
Hay and straw were important commodities in the pre-industrial era.  Hay was required as [[fodder]] for animals, especially horses, and straw was used for a variety of purposes including [[palliasse|bedding]].  In London, there were established markets for hay at [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]], [[Whitechapel]] and by the village of [[Charing (London)|Charing]], which is still now called the [[Haymarket, London|Haymarket]].&lt;ref name=trusler&gt;{{citation |page=186 |title=The London Adviser and Guide|author=Rev. Dr. John Trusler |year=1790 |publisher=Literary Press |location=[[Wardour Street]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The weight of trusses was regulated by law and statutes were passed in the reigns of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] and [[George III]].  The latter act of 1796 established the weights as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |pages=428–438 |title=The Statutes |volume=Vol. 3 |publisher=[[Eyre and Spottiswoode]] |year=1872 |chapter=LXXXVIII An Act to Regulate the Buying and Selling of Hay and Straw}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |pages=71–80 |title=The Country Gentlemen's Lawyer |author=William Marriott |publisher=W. Stratford |year=1801 |location=Holborn}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|... And be it further enacted that no hay or straw whatever shall be sold in any market or place within the cities of London or Westminster, or the weekly [[bills of mortality]], or within thirty [[mile]]s thereof, other than except in what is made up in bundles or trusses; ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;... that each and every bundle or truss of hay sold in any market or place within the cities or limits aforesaid, between the last day of August in any year and the first day of June in the succeeding year, shall contain and be of the full weight of fifty-six pounds at least; and that every bundle or truss of hay sold within the cities or limits aforesaid, between the first day of June and the last day of August in any year, being new hay, of the summer's growth of that year, shall be and contain the full weight of sixty pounds, and being old hay of any former year's growth, the weight of fifty-six pounds, as aforesaid; and that each and every bundle or truss of straw sold within the cities or limits aforesaid, shall contain and be of the full weight of thirty-six pounds; and that every load of hay or straw shall contain thirty-six bundles or trusses; ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...that the pair of bands with which any bundle or truss of hay shall be bound shall not exceed the weight of five pounds, ... }}In summary then, the standard weights of a truss were:

[[File:WFD implement 01.jpg|thumb|right|254px|The [[56 pound weight]] was used in early [[Olympic Games]] and is still used in [[Highland Games]]]]    
A detailed description was provided in ''British Husbandry'', sponsored by the [[Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=British Husbandry |year=1834 |publisher=Baldwin and Cradock |chapter=ch. XXXII Haymaking |location=[[Paternoster Row]] |pages=500–501 |author=John French Burke |volume=vol. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|The operation of trussing is in England performed with great nicety, and is so well deserving of imitation, that a description of it cannot be considered misplaced. The cutting is commenced at that end which is the least exposed to the weather, and should be begun at the left-hand corner. The binder begins by forming "thumb-bands" of the most inferior hay for tying up the trusses; in making which he is assisted by a boy, who holds both ends of a wisp of damped hay between his hands. He then catches the wisp with the crook of an implement called in different places, a "twiner", a "throw-crook", or a "windle" which is made, like ''fig. 1.'', of a circular piece of iron about a [[foot (unit)|foot]] and a half long, inclosed in a hollow tube of wood as at ''a''. This he grasps with his left hand, and then turning the handle ''b'', the crook revolves in the tube, and the band is instantaneously twisted.

This done, he measures the cut to be made in the stack, which is decided by the usual size of the trusses — each being as nearly as possible three feet by two and a half, and thick in proportion to the fineness and closeness of the hay; those of the best quality being the thinnest. He then mounts the ladder and cuts [[perpendicular]]ly through the [[thatch]], as far down as will produce the requisite number of trusses. This he does with a very strong and sharp knife, about thirty [[inch]]es in length by nearly six in breadth of the blade, and formed as in ''fig. 2.'' The handle is however often made short and straight from the blade, but the form above represented allows of more power being exerted by the workman in cutting through the stack, and it is an operation which demands considerable strength.

Having cut the necessary quantity, he next uses an iron spike, nearly three feet in length, with a small handle at the top, as at ''fig. 3.'' which he thrusts into the truss, and thus separates it in nearly its exact weight from the stack; afterwards laying it upon two of the bands, which have been previously stretched upon a [[weighing machine]], of the annexed form, and furnished with a 56 lb. weight, though [[steelyard]]s are sometimes used, but are not more convenient, while they are more expensive. The machine can be made by any common [[carpenter]] of a size to hold a truss of hay, the height about four feet, and of proportionate length, for less than fifty shillings.

The truss is then encircled by the bands, at about 10 inches from each end, being afterwards turned under, as a tie, in the same manner as those of [[sheaf (agriculture)|sheaves]] of corn. An expert hay-binder can thus truss two loads in his day's work; and the common price, if done by the job, is 2[[shilling|s]]. 6[[penny|d]]. per load. It will be readily conceived that this mode is preferable to that of delivering hay loose; for although it occasions the charge of binding, it yet secures it from every kind of waste: it is accurately weighed, securely loaded upon the cart, occupies the smallest space, and can be easily carried or delivered, without difficulty, through a [[loft]] window.}}

==Carriage==
[[File:London hay-cart.png|thumb|right|300px|The London hay-[[cart]].]]
The London hay-[[cart]] may have been purpose-made to carry a load of 36 trusses.  John French Burke wrote in 1834,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=British Husbandry |year=1834 |publisher=Baldwin and Cradock |chapter=ch. VII Cartage |location=[[Paternoster Row]] |pages=163–164 |author=John French Burke |volume=vol. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|...a more clumsy, ill-constructed vehicle cannot be imagined. With the occasional exception of a waggon, containing an additional half-load, it is the only vehicle used for the conveyance of hay and straw, and the return of [[feces#Manure and fertilizer|dung]], round the roads of the metropolis, and seems calculated to carry just a load, consisting of 18 [[hundredweight|cwt.]], divided into thirty-six trusses of hay, or the same number of straw, containing 36 [[pound (mass)|lbs.]] each. The weight being light, and occupying a great deal of room, fills up the body of the cart, with the tail and fore ladders and iron arms; and the wheel-horse runs under head-rails. It requires very considerable exactitude in placing so bulky an article with regard to the [[centre of gravity]]; but the carters are so habituated to the load, that an accident but rarely occurs.}}

==Consumption==
British army regulations in 1799 specified standard rations of trusses. These were one truss of straw for each two soldiers, to stuff their [[palliasse]]s.  Half a truss was provided after sixteen days to refresh this and the whole was then changed after 32 days.  Five trusses of straw were provided for each company every sixteen days for the batmen and washerwomen, who did not have palliasses.  Thirty trusses of straw were provided per company when they took the field to thatch the huts of the washerwomen.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A Military Dictionary |author=William Duane |location=Philadelphia |year=1810 |page=660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vertical penetration''' is a [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] measurement of [[distance]], of the maximum altitude an object, most often an [[aircraft]] can gain at any particular moment in time, thereby converting all of its energy from [[Kinetic Energy|kinetic]] to [[Potential Energy|gravitational potential]].

It is worth noting that when listing an aircraft's technical specifications, ''vertical penetration'' can be appropriately used in substitution of ''maximum vertical penetration''.

==Calculation==
Assume an aircraft has the same [[mechanical energy]] at two separate points in its flight - one when the aircraft is straight and level, holding a constant [[airspeed]], and negligible [[altitude]] (''near'' zero potential energy) and the other, following a sudden 90 degree [[Flight dynamics|pitch]] increase in attitude, when the aircraft has noticeable [[altitude]], and negligible airspeed (zero kinetic energy). Assuming the aircraft can 100% efficiently convert all of its kinetic energy to potential (theoretically have a radius of 0 in the turn, refer to [[centripetal force]]), the aircraft has the same mechanical energy in both points, the kinetic energy of the first point equaling the potential energy of the second:

&lt;math&gt;\,mgh_2 = \frac{1}{2}mv_1^2&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the mass, ''v'' is the speed, ''h'' is the height of the body, and ''g'' is [[standard gravity]]. In [[SI]] units (used for most modern scientific work), mass is measured in [[kilogram]]s, speed in metres per [[second]], height is in metres, standard gravity in [[Metre per second squared]], and the resulting energy is in [[joule]]s.

Notice that neither mass nor standard gravity were given subscripts indicating which point they correspond to. This is because both are assumed constant. This is mildly incorrect for both. As an aircraft operates, it consumes fuel, oil, etc., which slightly decreases mass. And since the standard gravity is inversely [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the distance between the body and Earth, and the aircraft is gaining altitude (increasing said distance), slightly decreasing standard gravity.

By dividing by standard gravity and mass, and rewriting &lt;math&gt;\,h_2&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\, \Delta h&lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt;\,h_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; shows that:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta h = \frac{\frac{1}{2}mv_1^2}{mg}&lt;/math&gt;

by canceling out mass, and rewriting &lt;math&gt;\,v_1&lt;/math&gt; as simply &lt;math&gt;\,v&lt;/math&gt; as point two has no velocity, and moving the &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; to the denominator, the formula for vertical penetration has yielded:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta h = \frac{v^2}{2g}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:James Callaghan.JPG|thumb|[[James Callaghan]], the serving [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] during the Winter of Discontent]]
The '''Winter of Discontent''' was the winter of 1978–79 in the United Kingdom, during which there were widespread strikes by public sector [[trade union]]s demanding larger pay rises, following the ongoing pay caps of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government led by [[James Callaghan]] against [[Trades Union Congress]] opposition to control inflation, during the coldest winter for 16 years.&lt;ref&gt; Colin Hay, "The winter of discontent thirty years on." ''The Political Quarterly'' 80:4 (2009): 545–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strikes were a result of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government's attempt to control inflation by a forced departure from their social contract with the unions by imposing rules on the [[public sector]] that pay rises be kept below 5%, to control inflation in itself and as an example to the private sector. However, some employees' unions conducted their negotiations within mutually agreed limits above this limit with employers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/28/newsid_2531000/2531007.stm  On This Day: 1979: Early election as Callaghan defeated], [[BBC]]. Retrieved 17 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; While the strikes were largely over by February 1979, the government's inability to contain the strikes earlier helped lead to [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]] and legislation to restrict unions. Public sector employee strike actions included an unofficial strike by [[gravedigger]]s working in [[Liverpool]] and [[Tameside]], and strikes by refuse collectors. Additionally, [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] ancillary workers formed picket lines to blockade hospital entrances with the result that many hospitals were reduced to taking emergency patients only.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

The phrase "Winter of Discontent" is from the opening line of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'': "Now is the winter of our discontent / Made glorious summer by this sun [or son] of [[House of York|York]]", and was first applied to the events of the winter by Robin Chater, a writer at ''Incomes Data Report''. It was subsequently used in a speech by [[James Callaghan]] and translated to define a crisis by [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]s – including ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''.&lt;ref name= "books.google.co.uk"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zypBsOadOx8C&amp;pg=PA480&amp;dq=phrase+%22winter+of+discontent%22+Larry+Lamb&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=A8P3TJ7UM9GahQeH0LHGDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=phrase%20%22winter%20of%20discontent%22%20Larry%20Lamb&amp;f=false |title=Unreliable sources: how the 20th… |publisher= Google Books |accessdate=2 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2fb76vADw4QC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=phrase+%22winter+of+discontent%22+Larry+Lamb&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=A8P3TJ7UM9GahQeH0LHGDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Popular newspapers, the Labour Party… | publisher = Google Books |accessdate=2 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The weather turned very cold in the early months of 1979 with [[blizzard]]s and deep snow, the coldest since 1962–63, rendering some jobs impossible, reducing retail spending and worsening the economy.&lt;ref name=weather&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/weather/article5408160.ece |title=Weather Eye: the Winter of Discontent 1978  |work=The Times Online|location=London |accessdate=2 December 2010  |first=Fiona |last=Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1969, Labour politician [[James Callaghan]] led a cabinet revolt which led to the abandonment of a proposed reform of trade union law outlined in a [[Barbara Castle]] [[white paper]] called ''[[In Place of Strife]]''; had Castle's white paper been implemented, most of the action during the Winter of Discontent would have been illegal.

Britain's economy during the 1970s was so weak that Callaghan warned his fellow Cabinet members in 1974 of the possibility of "a breakdown of democracy", telling them that "If I were a young man, I would emigrate."&lt;ref name="beckett2010"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-NURERF4hb8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA175#v=onepage&amp;f=false | title=When the Lights Went Out; Britain in the Seventies | publisher=Faber &amp; Faber | author=Beckett, Andy | year=2010 | pages=175 | isbn=978-0-571-22137-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour governments of [[Harold Wilson]] and Callaghan continued a fight begun in 1972 against inflation upon election in February 1974. Inflation had peaked at 26.9% in the 12 months to August 1975, but while demonstrating to markets [[fiscal responsibility]] they wished to avoid large increases in unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Colin Hay |title=Chronicles of a Death Foretold: the Winter of Discontent and Construction of the Crisis of British Keynesianism |journal=Parliamentary Affairs |year=2010 |volume=63 |pages=446–70 |doi=10.1093/pa/gsp056 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the campaign to bring down inflation, the government had agreed a '[[Social Contract (Britain)|social contract]]' with the [[Trades Union Congress]] which allowed for a voluntary [[incomes policy]] in which the pay rises for workers were held down to limits set by the government. Previous governments had brought in incomes policies backed by [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]], but the social contract agreed that this would not happen.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

===Phases I and II===

Phase I of the pay policy was announced on 11 July 1975 with a [[white paper]] entitled ''The Attack on Inflation''. This proposed a limit on wage rises of [[Pound sterling|£]]6 per week for all earning below £8,500 annually.  The [[TUC General Council]] had accepted these proposals by 19 votes to 13. On 5 May 1976 the TUC accepted a new policy for 1976 increases, beginning 1 August, of between £2.50 and £4 per week with further years outlined.  At the Annual Congress on 8 September 1976 the TUC rejected a motion which called for a return to free [[collective bargaining]] (which meant no incomes policy at all) once Phase I expired on 1 August 1977. This new policy was Phase II of the incomes policy.&lt;ref&gt; Hay, "The winter of discontent thirty years on." &lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase III===
On 15 July 1977, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]] announced Phase III of the incomes policy in which there was to be a phased return to free collective bargaining, without "a free-for-all."  After prolonged negotiations, the TUC agreed to continue with the modest increases recommended for 1977–78 under Phase II limits and not to try to reopen pay agreements made under the previous policy, while the Government agreed not to intervene in pay negotiations. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] criticised the power of the unions and lack of any stronger policy to cover the period from the summer of 1978. The inflation rate continued to fall through 1977 and by 1978 the annual rate fell below 10%.&lt;ref&gt; Hay, "The winter of discontent thirty years on." &lt;/ref&gt;

===The 5% limit===
Having prepared for the imminent end of the [[incomes policy]], global inflation supervened and was coming towards [[Interest rate#Historical interest rates|record levels during the 1978–82 period]]{{refn|And therefore a second trigger for a rise in [[inflation]]|group= n}} on 21 July 1978 Denis Healey introduced a new White Paper which set a guideline for pay rises of 5% in the year from 1 August.{{refn|Callaghan's initial preference had been for 3%, but other cabinet ministers considered this totally unachievable|group= n}} The TUC voted overwhelmingly on 26 July to reject the limit and insist on a return to [[collective bargaining|free collective bargaining]] as they were promised. Unexpectedly, on 7 September, Prime Minister James Callaghan announced that he would not be calling a general election that autumn but seeking to go through the winter with continued pay restraint so that the economy would be in a better state in preparation for a spring election. The pay limit was officially termed 'Phase IV' but most referred to it as 'the 5% limit.'  Although the government did not make the 5% limit a legal requirement, it decided to impose penalties on private and public government contractors who broke the limit.&lt;ref&gt; Hay, "The winter of discontent thirty years on." &lt;/ref&gt;

==The Ford negotiations==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Fordstrikers.jpg|right|thumb|Striking Ford workers demonstrate outside the negotiations over the company's pay offer in November 1978]] --&gt;
Although not an official guideline, the pay rise set by [[Ford of Britain]] was accepted throughout private industry as a benchmark for negotiations.  Ford had enjoyed a good year, and could afford to offer a large pay rise to its workers.  The company was, however, also a major government contractor.  Ford's management therefore made a pay offer within the 5% guidelines. In response, 15,000 Ford workers, mostly from the [[Transport and General Workers Union]] (TGWU), began an unofficial strike on 22 September, which subsequently became an official TGWU action on 5 October.  The number of participants grew to 57,000.

During the strike, [[Vauxhall Motors]] employees accepted an 8.5% rise.  After long negotiation in which they weighed the chances of suffering from government sanctions against the continued damage of the strike, Ford eventually revised their offer to 17% and decided to accept the sanctions; Ford workers accepted the rise on 22 November.

==Political difficulties==
As the Ford strike was starting, the Labour Party conference began at [[Blackpool]]. Terry Duffy, the delegate from [[Liverpool Wavertree (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Wavertree]] Constituency Labour Party and a supporter of the [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] group, moved a motion on 2 October which demanded "that the Government immediately cease intervening in wage negotiations". Despite a plea from [[Michael Foot]] not to put the motion to the vote, the resolution was carried by 4,017,000 to 1,924,000. The next day, the Prime Minister accepted the fact of defeat by saying "I think it was a lesson in democracy yesterday", but insisted that he would not let up on the fight against inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Labour Party|title=Report of the Annual Conference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sjCNAAAAMAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Labour Representation Committee|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the government's situation in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] was increasingly difficult; through by-elections it had lost its majority of 3 in 1976 and had been forced to put together a [[Lab-Lib pact#1977|pact]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in 1977 in order to keep winning votes on legislation; the pact lapsed in July 1978.  A decision to grant extra Parliamentary seats to [[Northern Ireland]] afforded temporary support from the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], but the Unionists were clear that this support would be withdrawn immediately after the Bill to grant extra seats had been passed &amp;ndash; it was through the Ulster Unionists agreeing to abstain that the government defeated a [[motion of no confidence]] by 312 to 300 on 9 November.&lt;ref&gt; Hay, "The winter of discontent thirty years on." &lt;/ref&gt;

===Further negotiation at the TUC===
By the middle of November it was clear that Ford would offer an increase substantially over the 5% limit. The government subsequently entered into intense negotiations with the TUC, hoping to produce an agreement on pay policy that would prevent disputes and show political unity in the run-up to the general election. A limited and weak formula was eventually worked out and put to the General Council of the TUC on 14 November, but its General Council vote was tied 14–14, with the formula being rejected on the Chair's casting vote. One important personality on the TUC General Council had changed earlier in 1978 with [[Moss Evans]] replacing [[Jack Jones (trade union leader)|Jack Jones]] at the TGWU. Evans proved a weak leader of his union, although it is doubtful whether Jones could have restrained the actions of some of the TGWU shop stewards.

After Ford settled, the government announced on 28 November that sanctions{{clarify|date=August 2013}} would be imposed on Ford, along with 220 other companies, for breach of the pay policy. The announcement of actual sanctions produced an immediate protest from the [[Confederation of British Industry]] which announced that it would challenge their legality. The Conservatives put down a motion in the House of Commons to revoke the sanctions. A co-ordinated protest by left-wing Labour MPs over spending on defence forced the debate set for 7 December to be postponed; however on 13 December an anti-sanctions amendment was passed by 285 to 279. The substantive motion as amended was then passed by 285 to 283. James Callaghan put down a further motion of confidence for the next day, which the government won by 10 votes (300 to 290), but accepted that his government could not use sanctions. In effect this deprived the government of any means of enforcing the 5% limit on private industry.

==Lorry drivers==
With the government having no way of enforcing its pay policy, unions which had not yet put in pay claims began to increase their aim. The first to take extreme action were [[truck|lorry]] drivers, members of the TGWU. Large numbers of the lorry drivers worked on oil tankers, and drivers working for [[BP]] and [[Esso]] began an overtime ban in support of rises of up to 40% on 18 December. With supplies of oil being disrupted, the [[Cabinet Office]] prepared 'Operation Drumstick', by which the [[British Army|Army]] were put on standby to take over from the tanker drivers. However, the Operation would need the declaration of a [[state of emergency]] in order to allow conscription of the assets of the oil companies, and the government drew back from such a step. Before the situation developed into a crisis the oil companies settled on wage rises of around 15%.

From 3 January 1979 an unofficial strike of all TGWU lorry drivers began. With petrol distribution held up, petrol stations closed across the country. The strikers also [[Picketing (protest)|picketed]] the main ports. The strikes were made official on 11 January by the TGWU and 12 January by the United Road Transport Union. With 80% of the nation's goods transported by road, essential supplies were put in danger as striking drivers picketed those firms that continued to work. While the oil tanker drivers were working, the main refineries were also targeted and the tanker drivers let the strikers know where they were going, allowing for flying pickets to turn them back at their destination. More than 1,000,000 UK workers were laid off temporarily during the disputes.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tgwuemergencygoods.jpg|right|thumb|Alec Kitson, Executive Officer of the TGWU, sent this [[Telex]] to branch officers to warn them to allow emergency supplies through.]] --&gt;
A further plan was drawn up to call a state of emergency and safeguard essential supplies through the Army, regarding which the government warned the TGWU leadership, which resulted in the union accepting (12 January 1979) a list of emergency supplies which were officially exempt from action. In practice, what counted as an emergency was left up to local officials of the TGWU to determine, and practice across the country varied according to the views of the local shop stewards who established 'dispensation committees' to decide. When strikers in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] did not allow the correct mix of animal feed through to local farms, the farmers dropped the bodies of dead piglets and chickens outside the union offices; the union contended that the farmer had actually wrung the chicken's necks to kill them, and the piglets had been killed when the sow rolled over and crushed them.

On 29 January, lorry drivers in the south west accepted a deal awarded by an [[Arbitration|Arbitration Panel]] of a rise of up to 20%, just £1 per week less than the union had been striking for; this settlement proved a model which was accepted throughout the country.

=='Crisis? What crisis?'==
On 10 January, James Callaghan arrived back from a [[Guadeloupe Conference|summit in Guadeloupe]] in the middle of the lorry drivers' strike. Having been tipped off that the press were present, his press secretary Tom McCaffrey advised him to say nothing and return immediately to work, but his political adviser [[Thomas McNally, Baron McNally|Tom McNally]] thought that the image of Callaghan returning and declaring his intent to take control of the situation would be reassuring. Callaghan therefore decided to give a press conference at [[Heathrow Airport]]. To McNally's dismay Callaghan was jocular and referred to having had a swim in the Caribbean during the summit. He was then asked (by a reporter from the ''[[Evening Standard]]'') "What is your general approach, in view of the mounting chaos in the country at the moment?" and replied:

{{Quote|Well, that's a judgment that you are making. I promise you that if you look at it from outside, and perhaps you're taking rather a parochial view at the moment, I don't think that other people in the world would share the view that there is mounting chaos.}}

The next day's edition of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' featured the famous headline "Crisis? What crisis?" with a subheading "Rail, lorry, jobs chaos – and Jim blames Press", condemning Callaghan as being "out of touch" with British society.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge79.shtml BBC News – History of the Winter of Discontent]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public sector employees==
22 January 1979 was the biggest individual day of strike action since the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike]] of 1926, and many workers stayed out indefinitely afterwards.  With many in the private sector having achieved substantial rises, the public sector unions became increasingly concerned to keep pace in terms of pay. The government had already announced a slight weakening of the policy on 16 January, which gave the unions cause for hope that they might win and use free collective bargaining. Train drivers belonging to [[ASLEF]] and the [[National Union of Railwaymen]] had already begun a series of 24-hour strikes, and the [[Royal College of Nursing]] conference on 18 January decided to ask that the pay of nurses be increased to the same level in real terms as 1974, which would mean a 25% average rise.  The public sector unions labelled the date the "Day of Action", in which they held a 24-hour strike and marched to demand a £60 per week minimum wage.

With the succession of strikes having been called and then won, many groups of workers began to take unofficial action – often without the consent or support of the union leaderships. Ambulance drivers began to take strike action in mid-January, and in parts of the country (London, West Midlands, [[Cardiff]], [[Glasgow]] and the west of Scotland) their action included refusing to attend 999 emergency calls. In these areas, the Army was drafted in to provide a skeleton service. Ancillary hospital staff also went on strike.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; On 30 January, the [[Secretary of State for Social Services]] [[David Ennals]] announced that 1,100 of 2,300 [[National Health Service|NHS]] hospitals were only treating emergencies, that practically no ambulance service was operating normally, and that the ancillary health service workers were deciding which cases merited treatment. The media reported with scorn that [[cancer]] patients were being prevented from getting essential treatment.

===Gravediggers' strike===
A notorious industrial action during the winter, and one which was later frequently referred to by Conservative politicians, was the strike by gravediggers, members of the [[GMWU]] in [[Liverpool]] and in [[Tameside]] near [[Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore (2014), p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt; Eighty gravediggers being on strike, [[Liverpool City Council]] hired a factory in [[Speke]] to store the corpses until they could be buried. The Department of Environment noted that there were 150 bodies stored at the factory at one point, with 25 more added every day. The reports of unburied bodies caused concern with the public.&lt;ref name="Travis"&gt;{{cite news|last=Travis|first=Alan|title=National archives: Fear of fights at cemetery gates during 1979 winter of discontent|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/dec/30/liverpool-gravedigger-strikes|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 1 February a persistent journalist asked the Medical Officer of Health for Liverpool, Dr Duncan Bolton, what would be done if the strike continued for months, Bolton speculated that [[burial at sea]] would be considered. Although his response was hypothetical, in the circumstances it caused great alarm. Other alternatives were considered, including allowing the bereaved to dig their own funeral's graves, deploying troops, and engaging private contractors to inter the bodies.  The main concerns were said to be aesthetic because bodies could be safely stored in heat-sealed bags for up to six weeks.&lt;ref name="Travis"/&gt; Bolton later reported being 'horrified' by the sensationalised reportage of the strike in the mass media.&lt;ref&gt;James Thomas, '"Bound by History": The Winter of Discontent in British Politics 1979–2004', ''Media, Culture and Society'', 29 (2007), p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; The gravediggers eventually settled for a 14% rise after a fortnight's strike.

===Waste collectors===
With many collectors having been on strike since 22 January, local authorities began to run out of space for storing waste and used local parks under their control. The Conservative controlled [[Westminster City Council]] used [[Leicester Square]] in the heart of London's West End for piles of rubbish and, as the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' reported, this attracted [[rat]]s.

On 21 February, a settlement of the local authority workers' dispute was agreed, whereby workers got an 11% rise, plus £1 per week, with the possibility of extra rises, should a pay comparability study recommend them. Some left-wing local authorities, among them the [[London Borough of Camden]], conceded the union demands in full (known as the 'Camden surplus') and then saw an investigation by the [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|District Auditor]], which eventually ruled it a breach of [[Fiduciary|fiduciary duty]]{{refn|Owed to the payers, the ratepayers of the area|group= n}} and therefore illegal.  Camden Borough councillors, among them [[Ken Livingstone]], avoided [[Surcharge (sanction on public servant)|surcharge]]. Livingstone was Leader of the [[Greater London Council]] at the time the decision not to impose a surcharge was made.

==International Monetary Fund==
Prior to the "Winter of Discontent", the Callaghan government had sought (in 1976) an [[International Monetary Fund]] loan of £2.3bn&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4553464.stm 1975 economic fears are laid bare]&lt;/ref&gt; to combat the rampant inflation at that time. Although the media reported this as a humiliation for a former imperial power working to rebuild its economy after [[World War II]] and the nadir of the post-war economic period, this in itself led to only a narrow lead for [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s party in October 1978 in opinion polls.&lt;ref name=calruns/&gt;

==The end of the strikes==
Strikes by essential services dismayed many senior ministers in the Labour government who had been close to the trade union movement, who had thought it unlikely that trade unionists would take such action. Among these was Prime Minister James Callaghan himself, who had built his political career on his connection to the trade unions, and had practically founded one, the [[Inland Revenue Staff Federation]].

The government was negotiating with the senior union leaders and on 11 February came to agreement on a proposal to be put to the TUC General Council. On 14 February the General Council agreed the concordat, published under the title 'The Economy, the Government, and Trade Union Responsibilities'.{{refn|The significance of a comprehensive agreement on [[Valentine's Day]] was remarked upon by the press{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}|group= n}} By this stage union executives had limited control over their members and strikes did not immediately cease, although they began to wind down from this point. In total in 1979, 29,474,000 working days were lost in industrial disputes, compared with 9,306,000 in 1978.

==Political fallout==
In the summer before the Winter of Discontent, the minority Labour government's fortunes in the opinion polls had been improving and suggested that they could gain an overall majority in the event of a general election being held. However, on 7 September 1978, Callaghan announced that no general election would be held that year. Callaghan's failure to call an election would ultimately prove to be a costly mistake for his government.&lt;ref name=calruns&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/7/newsid_2502000/2502781.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=1978: Callaghan accused of running scared | date=7 September 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thatcher-loc.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Margaret Thatcher]], who won the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]] and became Prime Minister]]
The strikes appeared to have a profound effect on voting intention. According to [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]], Labour had a lead of 5 percentage points over the Conservatives in November 1978, which turned to a Conservative lead of 7.5 percentage points in January 1979, and of 20 percentage points in February. On 1 March, referendums on [[devolution]] to Scotland and Wales were held. That in Wales went strongly against devolution; that in Scotland produced a small majority in favour which did not reach the threshold set by Parliament of 40% of the electorate. The government's decision not to press ahead with devolution immediately led the [[Scottish National Party]] to withdraw support from the government and on 28 March in a [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|motion of no confidence the government lost by one vote]], precipitating a [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|general election]].

[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader [[Margaret Thatcher]] had already outlined her proposals for restricting trade union power in a [[party political broadcast]] on 17 January in the middle of the lorry drivers' strike. During the election campaign the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] made extensive use of the disruption caused during the strike. One broadcast on 23 April began with the Sun's headline "Crisis? What Crisis?" being shown and read out by an increasingly desperate voiceover interspersed with film footage of piles of rubbish, closed factories, picketed hospitals and locked graveyards. The scale of the Conservatives' victory in the general election has often been ascribed to the effect of the strikes, as well as their [[Labour Isn't Working]] campaign, and the party used film of the events of the winter in election campaigns for years to come.

Following Thatcher's election win, she brought the [[post-war consensus]] to a halt and made drastic changes to trade union laws (most notably the regulation that unions had to hold a ballot among members before calling strikes) and as a result strikes were at their lowest level for 30 years by the time of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]], which the Conservatives won by a landslide.&lt;ref name="83electionyoutube"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7noHkLaZ5VI|title=Conservative Party Election Broadcast (1983)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
