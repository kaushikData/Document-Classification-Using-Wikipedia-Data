      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4192">The '''1918 Anglo–French Modus Vivendi''' was a [[modus vivendi]] agreement regarding the creation of the [[Occupied Enemy Territory Administration]] in the area of modern-day [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], [[Israel]], [[Lebanon]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]. The agreement was built on the basis of the previous Anglo-French agreement relating to the area, known as the 1916 [[Sykes-Picot agreement]].{{sfn|Paris|2003|p=48}}

While the agreement was ostensibly focused on the French goal to take responsibility over their allotted areas of responsibility, now under Allenby’s military command, the British used the agreement to begin the revision of the Sykes-Picot allocations.{{sfn|Lieshout|2016|p=303-304}}{{sfn|Hurewitz|1979|p=118-127}}

In practice, the agreement resulted in the creation of the three OETA territories: South (Palestine) with a British-led administration, West (the north Mediterranean coast including Lebanon), with a French-led administration, and East (inland Syria including Transjordan), with an Arab-led administration.{{sfn|Lieshout|2016|p=303-304}}{{sfn|Hurewitz|1979|p=118-127}}

==The agreement==

The key terms of the agreement were as follows; the map references related to the 1916 Sykes-Picot map:{{sfn|Lieshout|2016|p=303-304}}{{sfn|Hurewitz|1979|p=118-127}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the areas of special French interest, as described in the Anglo–French Agreement of 1916, which are or may be occupied by the Allied forces of the Egyptian expeditionary force, the Commander- in-Chief will recognise the representative of the French government as his Chief Political Adviser. The functions of the Chief Political Adviser will be as follows:

1. Subject to the supreme authority of the Commander-in-Chief, the Chief Political Adviser will act as sole intermediary on political and administrative questions between the Commander- in-Chief and any Arab government or governments, permanent or provisional, which may be set up in Area ‘A’, and recognised under the terms of clause 1 of the Agreement of 1916.

2. At the request of the Commander-in-chief, and subject to his supreme authority, the Chief Political Adviser will be charged by the Commander- in-Chief with the establishment of such provisional administration in the towns of the Syrian littoral situated in the blue area, and in the blue area in general.

3. Subject to the approval of the Commander- in-Chief, the Chief Political Adviser will provide […] Such European advisory staff and assistants as the Arab government or governments set up in Area ‘A’ may require under clause 1 of the Anglo–French Agreement of 1916 […] Such personnel as may be necessary for civil duties in the littoral towns or other parts of the blue area.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3258">'''AF/91''' was a [[hoax]] about a [[computer virus]] which was allegedly used in the [[First Gulf War]]; its name refers to [[April Fool's Day]].

The original article appeared in ''[[InfoWorld]]'' magazine on April 1, 1991, in article named "Meta-Virus Set to Unleash Plague on Windows 3.0 Users" by John Gantz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0FAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=Virus+AF+91&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZygnpUz-XZ&amp;sig=ndjx0hthBv2xdSP0PcniA7zNKVo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xLjcSsm0FImnlAf2zq2hAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Virus%20AF%2091&amp;f=false|title=Tech Street|first=John|last=Gantz|publisher=[[InfoWorld]]|date=April 1, 1991|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was purported to be an extremely early example of [[cyber warfare]] between 2 countries. In fact it was an April Fools Joke that was misunderstood by the public and media, creating a huge frenzy of media activity about the virus.

==History==
"Before the [[1st Gulf War]] the U.S. drew up plans to take down an Iraqi anti-aircraft system with "specially designed computer viruses [to] infect the system from within. Agents inserted the virus in a printer shipped to an Iraqi air defense site."&lt;ref name="SecurityFocus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securityfocus.com/columnists/147|title=Iraqi Cyberwar: an Ageless Joke|first=George|last=Smith|publisher=SecurityFocus|date=March 10, 2003|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tscm.com/tscm-l/021003.txt|title=Email|publisher=Granite Island Group|date=February 12, 2003|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/03/10/one_printer_one_virus_one|title=One printer, one virus, one disabled Iraqi air defence|first=George|last=Smith|publisher=[[The Register]]|date=March 10, 2003|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special Forces men were also said to have infiltrated Iraq, where they dug up a fiber-optic cable and jammed a computer virus into it. "It remained dormant until the opening moments of the air war, when it went active..." wrote the columnist. Iraq's air defense system was vanquished."&lt;ref name="SecurityFocus" /&gt; The story went on to say that the [[National Security Agency]] had developed the computer virus to disable Iraqi air defense computers by eating windows and that it was smuggled into Iraq through Jordan, hidden in a chip in a printer.&lt;ref name="SecurityFocus" /&gt;

==Media stir==
After this article was written and published by ''InfoWorld'', other major media sources such as ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'', Associated Press, CNN, ABC Nightline, and newspapers across the country quickly reported the supposed virus without even checking to see if the story was true.&lt;ref name="SecurityFocus" /&gt; When the story appeared, it captured the public imagination, with forums everywhere all over the internet imagining what the virus would look like.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The '''Abhidhānappadīpikā''' is a Pali thesaurus composed in the twelfth century by the Sri Lankan grammarian Moggallāna Thera. It is based on the Sanskrit thesaurus [[Amarakosha|''Amarakośa'']], and closely follows its style and method. 

Like the ''Amarakośa'', the ''Abhidhānappadīpikā'' consists of three parts: celestial objects, terrestrial objects and miscellaneous objects. Each part consists of several sections. The work is a thesaurus or dictionary of synonyms, grouping together the names of a particular thing in verse form for easy memorization.&lt;ref&gt;''Abhidhānappadīpikā'' in Malalasekera, G. P. ''[http://www.vipassana.info/dic_idx.html Dictionary of Pali Proper Names]'', London, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentaries==
A commentary was written by a Burmese minister under King Kittisīhasūra in the 14th century. A Burmese translation was made in the eighteenth century. A paraphrase (''sanna'') and a subcommentary (''ṭīkā'') were composed in Sri Lanka. According to Malalasekera, the sanna is the older and more valuable work.&lt;ref&gt;''Abhidhānappadīpikā'' in Malalasekera, G. P. ''[http://www.vipassana.info/dic_idx.html Dictionary of Pali Proper Names]'' London, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Editions==
''Abhidhānappadīpikā; or, Dictionary of the Pali language'' by Vaskaduve Subhuti, Colombo, 1865, A Sinhala script edition with English explanations. Available on [https://archive.org/details/abhidhnappadpik00saddgoog Archive.org].

A fully Romanized edition of this, input by the Sri Lanka Tripitaka Project,  is available on [http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/2_pali/9_phil/lex/abhidh_u.htm GRETIL].

'''''Actor Ichikawa Shikō as Katō Yomoshichi from the series Tales of Retainers of Unswerving Loyalty''''' is an ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' [[woodblock print]] by Osaka-based late [[Edo period]] print designer {{Nihongo|[[Konishi Hirosada|Gosōtei Hirosada]]| 五粽亭廣貞|}} ([[floruit|fl.]] c. 1819-1863). Each of the three sheets contains a different version of the same image, reflecting progressive stages in the woodblock printing process.
The print is a portrait of a contemporary ''[[kabuki]]'' actor in the role of a [[samurai]], and belongs to a series of images of heroes. The print belongs to the permanent collection of the [[Prince Takamado]] Gallery of Japanese Art in the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], Canada.

==Artist==
Despite his status as "the most important and prolific mid-nineteenth century Osaka designer,"&lt;ref&gt;Keyes &amp; Mizushima 1973, 210&lt;/ref&gt; little is known of Hirosada's personal details. The few biographies listing his life dates identify his birth year as unknown and that of his death as 1864&lt;ref&gt;Gerstle 2005, 302&lt;/ref&gt; or 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 1980, 44; Keyes &amp; Mizushima 1973, 210&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians link his activity to between 1810 and 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Ronin Gallery: 1810-1864, Faulkner: 1819-1865, Keyes &amp; Mizushima: 1826?-1863 (210), Gerstle: c.1819?-1863 (2002, 346) and c.1823?-(2005, 302)&lt;/ref&gt; He has been acknowledged as "the central figure of mid-nineteenth century Osaka printmaking."&lt;ref&gt;Fiorillo "Konishi Hirosada"&lt;/ref&gt; He was very prolific, producing predominantly ''kabuki-e'' and ''yakusha-e'' ''chūban'' prints. He is particularly known for his ''ōkubi-e'' (lit. "large head") portraits of leading Osaka actors such as this print.

Hirosada used a number of [[gō (art-name)|''gō'']] art names throughout his career, including {{Nihongo|Gosōtei Hirosada|五粽亭廣貞|}}, {{Nihongo|[[Konishi Hirosada]]|小西廣貞|}} and {{Nihongo|Utagawa Hirosada|歌川廣貞|}}. He apparently began his career as {{Nihongo|Hirokuni|廣國/ 広国|}}, switching to Hirosada in mid-1847.&lt;ref&gt;Fiorillo "Konishi Hirosada"&lt;/ref&gt; Some have suggested that Hirosada and his contemporary {{Nihongo|Utagawa Sadahiro|歌川貞廣|}} (fl. 1830-1847) were the same person; however, this remains unproven.&lt;ref&gt;Keyes 1973,210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject==

===Ichikawa Shikō III===
As with Hirosada, little is known about the personal life of {{Nihongo|Ichikawa Shikō|市川市紅|}}. He was born the son of a carpenter, but became the student then adopted son of kabuki actor {{Nihongo|Ichikawa Danzō V|市川団蔵|}}. He was known by various names during his career including the following:
* '''Stage names'''
** {{Nihongo|Ichikawa Morinosuke II|市川森之助|}}
** {{Nihongo|Ichikawa Danzaburō VI|市川段三郎|}} (1/1844-1/1846)
** {{Nihongo|Ichikawa Shikō III|市川市紅|}} (1/1846-8/1850)
** {{Nihongo|Ichikawa Tōshō|市川当升/ 市川當升|}} (8/1850-?)
* '''''[[Yagō]]'' guild name'''
** {{Nihongo|Mikawaya|三河屋|}}
* '''''[[Haimyō]]'' poetry name'''
** {{Nihongo|Shikō|市紅|}}
** {{Nihongo|Tōshō|当升/ 當升|}}
The last known mention of his name in print is in 1851, so it is presumed that he died in this year or soon after.&lt;ref&gt;Shōriya "Ichikawa Danzaburō"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kanadehon Chūshingura===
This print and the several others in the series from which it is taken depict characters from a staging of the play {{Nihongo|''Kanadehon [[Chūshingura]]''|仮名手本忠臣蔵|}} performed in Osaka in the third month of 1848. The play was originally written for the ''[[bunraku]]'' puppet theatre by Takeda Izumo II, Miyoshi Shōraku and Namiki Senryū I in 1748, and adapted for kabuki later that year.&lt;ref&gt;Shōriya "Kanadehon Chūshingura"&lt;/ref&gt; It remains one of the most famous and popular plays in the kabuki repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2003, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[jidaimono]]'' historical drama, the play tells the ostensibly true and pervasively enduring story of a 1702 incident known as the [[Akō Incident|Akō Affair]], in which 47 loyal retainers of a wronged lord avenged his death then committed ritual ''[[seppuku]]'' suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Blomberg 2006, 167&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the 47 ''[[ronin]]'' has long been repeated and romanticized as an idealization of the ''[[bushido]]'' ethos, and held particular appeal during the latter half of the Tokugawa era &lt;ref&gt;Bell 2001, 2&lt;/ref&gt; despite, or perhaps in part due to, strict censorship imposed on re-tellings of the incident by the shogunate.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2003, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Series==
The print belongs to a series of six known prints translated as ''Tales of Retainers of Unswerving Loyalty'' or ''The Exemplary Loyalty of the Faithful Samurai''. Like the characters from the play depicted in each image from the series, Katō Yomoshichi is one of the loyal retainers of the provincial lord Enya Hangan.&lt;ref&gt;Bell 2001, 148&lt;/ref&gt; The others are as follows:

Hirosada produced multiple albums of this type portraying popular actors of the day as heroic warriors, including 忠孝武勇伝 (''Chūka buyūden'') ("Tales of Loyalty and Filial Devotion") and 高名武勇伝 (''Kōmei buyūden'') ("Tales of Brave Warriors of Renown" or "Tales of Renowned Heroes"), both issued in 1848. Doesburg has argued that such collections are attempts to circumvent censorship of kabuki-themed ''ukiyo-e'' under the [[Tenpō Reforms]] by cloaking the dramatic content within titles suggesting the promotion of moral values and "suggesting that the portraits were actually representations of famous men and women from history and legend".

==Medium and genre==
[[File:Actor Ichikawa Shiko as Kato Yomoshichi (Gosotei Hirosada) 02.jpg|thumb|Character name cartouche (l) and series title (r) detail]]

===''Kamigata-e''===
Gosōtei Hirosada's works are categorized as {{Nihongo|''kamigata-e''|上方絵|}}, a term used to distinguish prints produced in the Kamigata area (Kyoto and Osaka) from those produced in Edo.&lt;ref&gt;JAANUS, "Kamigata-e"&lt;/ref&gt; Gaining prominence about a century after the emergence of ''ukiyo-e'' in Edo,&lt;ref&gt;Kitagawa 2005, 229&lt;/ref&gt; ''kamigata-e'' were predominantly {{Nihongo|''kabuki-e''|歌舞伎絵|}} (images of ''kabuki'' actors),&lt;ref&gt;Other names for this genre are: {{Nihongo|''shibai-e''|芝居絵|}}, {{Nihongo|''gekijou-e''|劇場絵|}}, {{Nihongo|''gekiga''|劇画|}}.(JAANUS "yakusha-e")&lt;/ref&gt; and were produced almost exclusively by amateur “talented kabuki fans” promoting their favourite actors.&lt;ref&gt;Kitagawa 2005, 230&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Kabuki-e''===
Literally 'kabuki pictures', ''kabuki-e'' began to be produced in Edo in the late seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;JAANUS "kabuki-e"&lt;/ref&gt; As kabuki grew in popularity, stars emerged, which in turn led to the {{Nihongo|''yakusha-e''|役者絵|}} (actor print) subgenre.&lt;ref&gt;JAANUS "yakusha-e"&lt;/ref&gt; Further subgenres of ''yakusha-e'' include {{Nihongo|''ōkubi-e''|大首絵|}} bust portraits, {{Nihongo|''zenshin-zu''|全身図|}} full-length portraits, {{Nihongo|''mitate-e''|見立絵|}} parody pictures, and {{Nihongo|''[[shini-e]]''|死に絵|}} death portraits.&lt;ref&gt;JAANUS "kabuki-e"&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ōkubi-e''===
''Ōkubi-e'' prints, also known as {{Nihongo|''ōgao-e''|大顔絵|}}, are close-up ukiyo-e head shots of actors or beautiful women. Hirosada's print bears many of the typical marks of this genre including the plain background, the dramatic posing of the hands and arms, and the emphasis on facial features and make-up.&lt;ref&gt;JAANUS "ookubi-e"&lt;/ref&gt; Hirosada is particularly associated with this genre of print due to both the number and quality of works of this type that he produced.

== Biography ==
Agathias was a native of [[Myrina (Mysia)]]. His father was Memnonius. His mother was presumably Pericleia. A brother of Agathias is mentioned in primary sources, but his name has not survived. Their probable sister Eugenia is known by name. The ''[[Suda]]'' clarifies that Agathias was active in the reign of the Roman emperor [[Justinian I]], mentioning him as a contemporary of [[Paul the Silentiary]], [[Macedonius of Thessalonica]] and [[Tribonian]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Suda]] s.lem. Agathias (Alpha, 112: Ἀγαθίας)&lt;/ref&gt;

Agathias mentions being present in [[Alexandria]] as a law student at the time when an earthquake destroyed Berytus ([[Beirut]]).&lt;ref name="PLRE"/&gt; [[Law School of Beirut|The law school of Berytus]] had been recognized as one of the three official law schools of the empire (533). Within a few years, as the result of the [[551 Beirut earthquake|disastrous earthquake of 551]],&lt;ref name=LebEmbU.S.&gt;[http://www.lebanonembassyus.org/country_lebanon/history.html Profile of Lebanon: History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128123851/http://www.lebanonembassyus.org/country_lebanon/history.html |date=January 28, 2011 }} Lebanese Embassy of the U.S.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DTBcom&gt;[http://www.downtownbeirut.com/AboutBeirut.html About Beirut and Downtown Beirut], DownTownBeirut.com.

Retrieved November 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; the students were transferred to [[Sidon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikamalebanon.com/national_heritage/south_nh/sth_cities_nh/saida.htm |title=Saida (Sidon) |publisher=Ikamalebanon.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628084129/http://www.ikamalebanon.com/national_heritage/south_nh/sth_cities_nh/saida.htm |archivedate=2009-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dating of the event to 551: as a law student, Agathias could be in his early twenties, which would place his birth to {{circa|lk=no|530}}.&lt;ref name="PLRE"/&gt;

He mentions leaving Alexandria for [[Constantinople]] shortly following the earthquake. Agathias visited the island of [[Kos]], where "he witnessed the devastation caused by the earthquake". At the fourth year of his legal studies, Agathias and fellow students Aemilianus, John and Rufinus are mentioned making a joint offering to [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] the [[Archangel]] at Sosthenium, where they prayed for a "prosperous future".&lt;ref name="PLRE"/&gt;

He returned to [[Constantinople]] in 554 to finish his training, and practised as an [[advocatus]] (''scholasticus'') in the courts. [[John of Epiphania]] reports that Agathias practiced his profession in the capital. [[Evagrius Scholasticus]] and [[Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos]] describe Agathias as a [[Rhetoric|rhetor]] ("public speaker"). The ''Suda'' and a passage of [[John of Nikiû]] call him "Agathias the scholastic".&lt;ref name="PLRE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2392385 Perseus.Tufts.edu], Rhetor, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; He is known to have served as pater civitatis ("Father of the City", effectively a [[Roman Magistrates|magistrate]]) of [[Smyrna]]. He is credited with constructing public [[latrine]]s for the city. While Agathias mentions these buildings, he fails to mention his own role in constructing them.&lt;ref name="PLRE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/ifa/zpe/downloads/1989/079pdf/079103.pdf|format=PDF|first=H.S. |last=Sivan|title=Town, country and province in Late Roman Gaul|year=1989|website=uni-koeln.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myrina is known to have erected statues to honor Agathias, his father Memnonius, and Agathias' unnamed brother. He seems to have been known to his contemporaries more as an advocatus and a poet. There are few mentions of Agathias as a historian.&lt;ref name="PLRE"/&gt;

Few details survive of his personal life – mainly in his extant poems. One of them tells the story of his pet cat eating his [[partridge]]. Another (Gr.Anth. 7.220) responds to his seeing the tomb of the courtesan [[Lais of Corinth]], implying a visit to that city, which he refers to using the poetic name Ephyra. No full account of his life survives.&lt;ref name="PLRE"/&gt;

==Writings==
Literature, however, was Agathias' favorite pursuit, and he remains best known as a poet. Of his ''Daphniaca'', a collection of short poems in [[hexameter]] on 'love and romance' in nine books, only the introduction has survived.&lt;ref name="PLRE"/&gt; But he also composed over a hundred [[epigram]]s, which he published together with  epigrams by friends and contemporaries in a ''[[Cycle of New Epigrams]]'' or ''Cycle of Agathias'', probably early in the reign of emperor [[Justin II]] (r. 565–578). This work largely survives in the ''[[Greek Anthology]]''—the edition by [[Maximus Planudes]] preserves examples not found elsewhere.&lt;ref name="PLRE"/&gt; Agathias's poems exhibit considerable taste and elegance.

He also wrote marginal notes on the ''Description of Greece'' ({{lang|grc|Ἑλλάδος περιήγησις}}) of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].

Almost equally valued are Agathias's ''Histories'', which he started in the reign of Justin II. He explains his own motivation in writing it, as simply being unwilling to let "the momentous events of his own times" go unrecorded. He credits his friends with encouraging him to start this endeavor, particularly one Eutychianus.&lt;ref name="PLRE"/&gt; This work in five books,  ''On the Reign of Justinian'', continues the history of [[Procopius]], whose style it imitates, and is the chief authority for the period 552–558. It deals chiefly with the struggles of the Imperial army, under the command of general [[Narses]], against the [[Goths]], [[Vandals]], [[Franks]] and [[Persian people|Persians]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Agathias|volume=1|page=370}} This cites as authorities:
*''Editio princeps'', by [[Bonaventura Vulcanius|B. Vulcanius]] (1594)
*the Bonn ''Corpus Scriptorum Byz. Hist.'', by [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr|B. G. Niebuhr]] (1828)
*[[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]], ''Patrologia Graeca'', lxxxviii.
*L. Dindorf, ''Historici Graeci Minores'' (1871)

*[[Karl Krumbacher|C. Krumbacher]], ''Geschichte der byzantinischen Litteratur'' (2nd ed. 1897).&lt;/ref&gt;

The work survives, but seems incomplete. Passages of his history indicate that Agathias had planned to cover both the final years of Justin II and the fall of the [[Huns]] but the work in its known form includes neither. [[Menander Protector]] implies that Agathias died before having a chance to complete his history. The latest event mentioned in the Histories is the death of the Persian king [[Khosrau I]] (r. 531–579);  which indicates that Agathias was still alive in the reign of [[Tiberius II Constantine]] (r. 578–582). The emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] (r. 582–602) is never mentioned, suggesting that Agathias was dead by 582.&lt;ref name="PLRE"/&gt;

[[Menander Protector]] continued the history of Agathias, covering the period from 558 to 582. [[Evagrius Scholasticus]] alludes to Agathias' work, but he doesn't seem to have had access to the full History.

== Assessment as a historian ==
:"His pages abound in philosophic reflection. He is able and reliable, though he gathered his information from eye- witnesses, and not, as Procopius, in the exercise of high military and political offices. He delights in depicting the manners, customs, and religion of the foreign peoples of whom he writes; the great disturbances of his time, earthquakes, plagues, famines, attract his attention, and he does not fail to insert "many incidental notices of cities, forts, and rivers, philosophers, and subordinate commanders." Many of his facts are not to be found elsewhere, and he has always been looked on as a valuable authority for the period he describes." —''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''.

According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]], "The author prides himself on his honesty and impartiality, but he is lacking in judgment and knowledge of facts; the work, however, is valuable from the importance of the events of which it treats". Britannica also noted that [[Edward Gibbon]] contrasted Agathias as "a poet and rhetorician" with Procopius, "a statesman and soldier."&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Christian commentators note the superficiality of Agathias' nominal Christianity: "There are reasons for doubting that he was a Christian, though it seems improbable that he could have been at that late date a genuine pagan" (''Catholic Encyclopedia''). "No overt pagan could expect a public career during the reign of Justinian, yet the depth and breadth of Agathias' culture was not Christian" ([[Anthony Kaldellis|Kaldellis]]).

Agathias (''Histories'' 2.31) is the only authority for the story of Justinian's closing of the re-founded Platonic (actually [[Neoplatonism|neoplatonic]]) [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] in Athens (529), which is sometimes cited as the closing date of "[[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Greek Literature |last=Hadas |first=Moses |year=1950 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=0-231-01767-7 |page=273|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dOht3609JOMC&amp;pg=PA273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dispersed neo-Platonists, with as much of their library as could be transported, found temporary refuge in the [[Sasanian Empire|Persian]] capital of [[Ctesiphon]], and afterwards— under treaty guarantees of security that form a document in the history of [[freedom of thought]]— at [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], which just a century later became one of the places where Muslim thinkers encountered ancient Greek culture and took an interest in its science and medicine.

Agathias's ''Histories'' are also a source of information about pre-Islamic Iran, providing&amp;mdash;in summary form&amp;mdash;"our earliest substantial evidence for the Khvadhaynamagh tradition",&lt;ref&gt;Averil Cameron, "Agathias on the Sasanians" in ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'', 23 (1969) p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; that later formed the basis of [[Ferdowsi]]'s ''[[Shahname]]'' and provided much of the Iranian material for [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]]'s ''History''.

[[File:Tabula - boardgame - Zeno game.svg|thumb|300px|A game of [[tabula (game)|τάβλι (tabula)]] played by Zeno in 480 and recorded by Agathias in ''circa''  530 because of a very unlucky dice result for Zeno. The game is nearly identical to [[backgammon]].&lt;ref name="austin-zeno"&gt;Austin, Roland G. "Zeno's Game of τάβλη", ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' 54:2, 1934. p. 202-205.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Agathias recorded the earliest description of the rules of backgammon, which he calls ''[[Tabula (game)|τάβλη (tabula)]]'' as it is still called in Greece, in a story relating an unlucky game played by the emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]]. Zeno had a stack of seven checkers, three stacks of two checkers and two ''blots'', checkers that stand alone on a point and are therefore in danger of being put outside the board by an incoming opponent checker. Zeno threw the three dice with which the game was played and obtained 2, 5 and 6. The white and black checkers were so distributed on the points that the only way to use all of the three results, as required by the game rules, was to break the three stacks of two checkers into blots, thus exposing them to capture and ruining the game for Zeno.&lt;ref name="austin-zeno"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bell"&gt;Robert Charles Bell, ''Board and table games from many civilizations'', Courier Dover Publications, 1979, {{ISBN|0-486-23855-5}}, p. 33–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The_Chess_Game.jpg|thumb|right|Chess game between Tha'ālibī and Bakhazari, by [[Ludwig Deutsch]] (1855–1935)]]
'''Al-Tha'ālibī''' (Abu Manşūr 'Abd ul-Malik ibn Mahommed ibn Isma'īl) (961–1038), Arabic: الثعالبي, was an Iranian writer, born in [[Nishapur]], [[Iran|Persia]]. It is not clear that he was ethnically a [[Persian people|Persian]] or [[Iranian Arabs|Arab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abu Manşūr Tha'ālibī|url=http://www.cgie.org.ir/fa/publication/entryview/2322|publisher=[[Center for the Great Islamic Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he wrote prose and verse of his own, he was most famous for his [[anthologies]] and collections of [[epigram]]s. Like many other [[Arabic Language|Arabic]] writers of his time, he does not always distinguish between his own and other people's work. Of the twenty-nine works known to have been written by him, the most famous is his ''Kitāb Yatīmat ud-Dahr'', on the poets of his own and earlier times, arranged according to the countries of the poets, and containing valuable extracts (published at [[Damascus]], 4 vols., 1887). Another of his works, the ''Kitāb Fiqh ul-Lugha'', is lexicographical, a dictionary, the words being arranged in semantic subject classes. It has been published at [[Paris]] (1861), [[Cairo]] (1867), and [[Beirut]] (1885, incomplete).{{sfn|Thatcher|1911|page=716}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thatcher|1911|page=716}} notes: For his other works see {{harvnb|Brockelmann|1898|pp=284–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; His "Book of curious and entertaining information" (Lata'if al-ma'arif) was translated into English by [[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]] ([[Edinburgh University Press]], 1968).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4059">'''Alfredo Augusto Lopes Pimenta ''' (3 December 1882, [[Guimarães]] &amp;ndash; 15 October 1950, [[Lisbon]]) was a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] historian, poet and writer.

==Biography==

Alfredo Pimenta, son of José Manuel Lopes Pimenta and Silvina Rosa, was born at Penouços in [[São Mamede de Alda]], Guimarães. In 1890, living at [[Braga]] with his parents, he attended the [[Colégio Académico de Guadalupe]]. In 1893 he returned to Guimaraes and studied at the College of St. Nicholas. In 1910, he graduated in Law from the [[University of Coimbra]] and was a professor at the [[Escola Secundária Sá de Miranda|Liceu Passos Manuel]] in [[Lisbon]] from 1911 to 1913. On 22 December 1931 he became director of the Municipal Archive of Guimarães. He was a founding member of the Portuguese Institute of Archaeology, History and Ethnography in 1953 and the [[Portuguese Academy of History]] in 1937.

Initially a militant [[anarchist]], he later moved toward [[republicanism]]. After the founding of the Republic, he joined the Partido Republicano Evolucionista. In 1915 he appeared as a contributor of the [[Portuguese Nation]] magazine, organ of the political philosophy of [[Integralismo Lusitano]], and ended up becoming a militant monarchist and became a prominent counselor. This passage toward the monarchy occurred soon after the coup of 14 May 1915, which overthrew the government of [[Pimenta de Castro]], supported by evolutionists. He later converted to [[Roman Catholicism]].

He suggested a reconciliation between the theses of [[Auguste Comte]] and the [[neo-Thomist]]s. He founded the [[Acção Realista Portuguesa]] in 1923, breaking ideologically with ''Integralismo Lusitano'', to which had never formally belonged. He come to admire [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]], and praised [[fascism]] and [[Nazism]]. After the [[Second World War]], he complained of the harassment of the Nazis, implying the existence of [[concentration camp]]s among the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. He joined The Voice, which advocated the restoration of the monarchy but as a sort of crowning of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]], which contrasted with the time he wrote ''Mentira Monarchica'' (''Monarchist Lies'') in 1906.

He was a renowned political theorist and historian, and his most enduring contribution was in the field of history, especially of the [[Middle Ages]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1663">The '''Private Subscription Theatre''' more commonly known as the '''Chowringhee Theatre''', was an historic theatre in [[Calcutta]] (now named Kolkata) in India, founded in 1813 and closed in 1839.

The Chowringhee Theatre was situated on [[Chowringhee]] Road. A number of short-lived theatres had been founded in the city since the [[Calcutta Theatre]], but the Chowringhee Theatre was to be first permanent professional public theatre. The theatre was built on funds by private donations on subscriptions by shares of 100 Rs each. It was able to accommodate 300 people and was thereby the most spacious theatre in Calcutta at the time. The theater was protected by the Governor-General and became one of the leading theatres in Calcutta and India. Reviews of the performances at the theatre was regularly published in the press. One of the star attractions of the theatre was the hugely popular actor [[Esther Leach]].  Chowringhee Theatre was the first English theatre more frequented also by Indians, and inspired the development of English style theatre among Indians.  The theatre was destroyed by fire in May 1839 and replaced by the [[Sans Souci Theatre (Calcutta)|Sans Souci Theatre]].

'''Chrematistics''' (from Greek: ''χρηματιστική''), or the study of wealth or a particular theory of wealth as measured in money, has historically had varying levels of acceptability in Western culture.  This article will summarize historical trends.  

== Ancient Greece ==

[[Aristotle]] established a difference between economics and chrematistics that would be foundational in medieval thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=von Reden|first=Sitta|editor1-last=Cancik|editor1-first=Hubert|editor2-last=Schneider|editor2-first=Helmuth|editor3-last=Landfester|editor3-first=Manfred|editor4-last=Salazar|editor4-first=Christine F.|editor5-last=Gentry|editor5-first=Francis G.|encyclopedia=Brill's New Pauly|title=Chrematistike|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/chrematistike-e233430|access-date=13 November 2016|publisher=J. B. Metzler Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For Aristotle, the [[Capital accumulation|accumulation]] of money itself is an unnatural activity that dehumanizes those who practice it.  [[Exchange (organized market)|Trade Exchanges]], money for goods, and [[usury]] creates money from money, but do not produce useful goods.  Hence, Aristotle, like [[Plato]],{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} condemns these actions from the standpoint of their philosophical ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=Andrew|editor1-last=Borkowski|editor1-first=Peter S.|editor2-last=Hurst|editor2-first=Dena|editor3-last=Jasso|editor3-first=Sean|title=Aristotle and Locke on the Moral Limits of Wealth|journal=Philosophy for Business|date=28 April 2010|issue=59|url=http://www.isfp.co.uk/businesspathways/issue59.html|accessdate=14 November 2016|at=Section 3|publisher=University of Sheffield|language=English|format=E-journal|issn=2043-0736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aristotle, the "necessary" chrematistic economy is licit if the sale of goods is made directly between the producer and buyer at the right price; it does not generate a value-added product. By contrast, it is illicit if the producer purchases for resale to consumers for a higher price, generating added value. The money must be only a medium of exchange and measure of [[Labor theory of value|value]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Aristotle|title=Politics|translator-last=Jowett|translator-first=Benjamin|translator-link=Benjamin Jowett|place=I.1257a-1258a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Middle Ages ==
The Catholic Church maintained this economic doctrine throughout the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=Chrematistic_SLC&gt;{{cite web|title=Second Lateran Council (1139 A.D.)|publisher = Papal Encyclicals Online|url = http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Councils/ecum10.htm|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Aquinas|Saint Thomas Aquinas]] accepted capital accumulation if it served for virtuous purposes as charity.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

== Modern ==
Although [[Martin Luther]] raged against usury and [[extortion]], modern sociologists have argued that he inspired doctrines that assisted in the spread of capitalistic practices in early modern Europe.  [[Max Weber]] argued that Protestant sects emphasized frugality, sobriety, deferred consumption, and saving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weber|first1=Max|title=The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism|date=1992|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-25559-7|translator1-last=Parsons|translator1-first=Talcott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Das Kapital]]'', Marx developed a labor theory of value inspired by Aristotle's notions of exchange&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Das Kapital|last=Marx|first=Karl|date=1903|publisher=S. Sonnenschein|editor-last=Engels|editor-first=Frederick|edition=3rd German|pages=28–29|trans-title=Capital: A Critical Analysis of Capitalist Production|translator1-last=Moore|translator1-first=Samuel|translator2-last=Aveling|translator2-first=Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt; and highlighting the consequences of what he also calls ''Auri Sacra Fames'' (damned thirst for gold), a Latin reference of [[Virgil]] to the passion of money for money itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3859">'''Digital interview''', also referred to as a video [[interview]] or virtual interview, enables prospective employers to conduct digital based video interviews in an automated fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Digital Interview|url=https://www.tastaffing.com/news/posts/best-practices---completing-a-digital-interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interviews are conducted via websites or internet-enabled devices using digital interviewing applications and can be 'OnDemand', live interviews, one-way&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introductory Guide To Video Interviews|url=https://www.sparkhire.com/video-interviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; or recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On Demand Video Interviewing: Make Video Interviews Work for You|url=https://www.hirevue.com/blog/video-interviewing-guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital interviewing is becoming the standard method for first round of screening providing interviewers with an efficient, fair, and structured method for conducting interviews. Digital interviews utilize technology to equip hiring personnel to interview candidates who are not able to do a traditional face-to-face interview or candidates that align with a prospective position that may be a full or part-time [[telecommuting]] opportunity. These types of interview also allow interviews to that are restrained by time and place making the [[Recruitment|recruiting]] process more efficient in discovering and employing talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sullivan|first=John|title=Live Video Interviews Are Now a Best Practice|url=http://www.ere.net/2009/06/29/interview-from-anywhere-live-video-interviews-are-now-a-best-practice-part-i-of-ii/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interview process ==
*The interviewer creates questions in text format, records their interview questions, or prepares sample scenarios/coding challenges for the online interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Digital Interview|url=https://www.tastaffing.com/news/posts/best-practices---completing-a-digital-interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The interviewer invites candidates for the online interview via [[email]] (a link to the interview is sent in the email)
*The candidate opens the link to the online interview in a web browser, application or records their responses. The candidate then reads and answers each question using a webcam, mobile phone camera or other device that gathers audio and video.
*The interviewers reviews the answers and grades candidates.
*Finally, the interviewer invites selected candidates for the face to face interview.

== Traditional interviews and resumes versus digital interviews ==
Traditional interviews continue to be the top choice of many individuals, but many employers are moving to video interview platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenfield|first1=Rebecca|title=The rise of the webcam job interview: 'It honestly was pretty horrible'|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-careers-webcam-job-interview-20161017-story.html|accessdate=18 March 2018|agency=Bloomberg|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the prevalence of '[[work from home]]' positions, technology, and telecommuting continue to increase/improve, virtual interviews become a more acceptable method for identifying ideal hires.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32779">The '''disposable soma theory of aging''' states that organisms age due to an evolutionary trade-off between growth, reproduction, and [[DNA repair|DNA repair maintenance]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kirkwood, T. | year = 1977 | title = Evolution of ageing | journal = Nature | volume = 270 | issue = | pages = 301–304 | doi=10.1038/270301a0| bibcode = 1977Natur.270..301K }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Formulated by [[Thomas Kirkwood]], the disposable soma theory explains that an organism only has a limited amount of resources or "soma" that it can allocate to its various [[cellular processes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Gavrilov LA, Gavrilova NS | year = 2002 | title = Evolutionary theories of aging and longevity | journal = ScientificWorldJournal | volume = 7 | issue =2 | pages = 339–356 | doi=10.1100/tsw.2002.96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a greater investment in growth and reproduction would result in reduced investment in DNA repair maintenance, leading to increased [[Cell damage|cellular damage]], [[telomere#shortening|shortened telomeres]], accumulation of [[mutation#harmful mutations|mutations]], compromised [[stem cells]], and ultimately, [[senescence]]. Although many models, both animal and human, have appeared to support this theory, parts of it are still controversial. 
Specifically, while the [[evolutionary trade-off]] between [[Mechanistic target of rapamycin#Aging|growth and aging]] has been well established, 
the relationship between reproduction and aging is still without [[scientific consensus]], and the cellular mechanisms largely undiscovered.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Blagosklonny, MV | year = 2010| title = Why the disposable soma theory cannot explain why women live longer and why we age | journal = Aging | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 884–887 | doi=10.18632/aging.100253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and history ==

British biologist Thomas Kirkwood first proposed the disposable soma theory of aging in a 1977 [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] review article.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The theory was inspired by [[Leslie Orgel|Leslie Orgel's]] [[Error catastrophe|Error Catastrophe Theory of Aging]], which was published fourteen years earlier, in 1963. Orgel believed that the process of aging arose due to mutations acquired during the replication process, and Kirkwood developed the disposable soma theory in order to mediate Orgel's work with [[evolutionary genetics]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==Principles==
The disposable soma theory of aging acts on the premise that there is a tradeoff in [[resource allocation]] between [[Maintenance of an organism|somatic maintenance]] and [[Parental investment|reproductive investment]]. Too low an investment in self-repair would be evolutionarily unsound, as the organism would likely die before reproductive age. However, too high an investment in self-repair would also be [[Fitness (biology)|evolutionarily unsound]] due to the fact that one's [[Survivorship curve|offspring would likely die before reproductive age]]. Therefore, there is a compromise and resources are partitioned accordingly. However, this compromise is thought to damage somatic repair systems, which can lead to [[DNA damage theory of aging|progressive cellular damage and senescence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Drenos F, Kirkwood, TB | year = 2005| title = Modelling the disposable soma theory of ageing | journal = Mech Ageing Dev. | volume = 126 | issue = 1 | pages = 99–103| doi=10.1016/j.mad.2004.09.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repair costs can be categorized into three groups: (1) the costs of increased [[Regeneration (biology)#Tissues|durability of nonrenewable parts]]; (2) the costs of maintenance involving [[Autophagy|cell renewal]], and (3) the costs of intracellular maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kirkwood, TB, Rose MR | year = 1991| title = Evolution of senescence: late survival sacrificed for reproduction.| journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 332 | issue = 1262 | pages = 15–24| doi=10.1098/rstb.1991.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a nutshell, [[Antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis|aging and decline is essentially a tradeoff]] for increased reproductive robustness in youth.

== Mechanisms == 
[[File:IGF-1Pathway.png|thumb|The [[IGF-1|IGF-1 pathway]], which represses [[FOXO]], thus preventing [[gene expression]] of longevity-inducing proteins.]]

=== Growth and somatic maintenance === 
{{main|Mechanistic target of rapamycin#Aging}}
Much research has been done on the antagonistic effects of increased growth on lifespan. Specifically, the hormone [[insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF-1), binds to a cell receptor, leading to a [[phosphorylation cascade]]. This cascade results in kinases phosphorylating [[FOX proteins|forkhead transcription factor]] (FOXO), deactivating it. Deactivation of FOXO results in an inability to express genes involved in responding to [[oxidative stress |oxidative stress response]], such as [[antioxidants]], [[Chaperone (protein)|chaperones]], and [[heat-shock proteins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=O'Neill BT, Lee KY, Klaus K, Softic S; et al. | year = 2016 | title = Insulin and IGF-1 receptors regulate FoxO-mediated signaling in muscle proteostasis | journal = J Clin Invest | volume = 126 | issue = 9 | pages = 3433-3346 | doi=10.1172/JCI86522| pmc = 5004956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Additionally, uptake of IGF-1 stimulates the [[Mechanistic target of rapamycin|mTOR]] pathway, which activates protein synthesis (and therefore growth) through upregulation of the translation-promoting [[P70-S6 Kinase 1|S6K1]], and also inhibits [[autophagy]], a process necessary for recycling of damaged cellular products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Johnson SC, Rabinovitch PS, Kaeberlein M| year = 2013 | title = mTOR is a key modulator of ageing and age-related disease| journal = Nature | volume = 493 | issue = | pages = 338–345 | doi=10.1038/nature11861| bibcode = 2013Natur.493..338J| pmc = 3687363}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Decline of autophagy causes [[neurodegeneration]], [[protein aggregation]] and [[premature aging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Komatsu M, Waguri S, Chiba T, Murata S; et al. | year = 2006 | title = Loss of autophagy in the central nervous system causes neurodegeneration in mice | journal = Nature | volume = 441 | issue = | pages = 880–884 | doi=10.1038/nature04723| bibcode = 2006Natur.441..880K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, studies have also indicated that the mTOR pathway also alters [[immune responses]] and  stimulates [[cyclin-dependent kinase]] (CDK) inhibitors such as [[p16]] and [[p21]]. This leads to alteration of the [[stem-cell niche]] and results in [[Stem cell theory of aging|stem cell exhaustion]], another theorized mechanism of aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Castilho RM1, Squarize CH, Chodosh LA, Williams BO; et al. | year = 2009| title = mTOR mediates Wnt-induced epidermal stem cell exhaustion and aging.| journal = Cell Stem Cell | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 279–289. | doi=10.1016/j.stem.2009.06.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproduction and somatic maintenance===
The mechanism of why reproduction inhibits lifespan with regards to multicellular organisms is still unclear. Although many models do illustrate an inverse relationship, and the theory makes sense from an evolutionary perspective, [[Cell signaling|the cellular mechanisms]] have yet to be explored. However, with regards to [[cellular replication]], the progressive shortening of telomeres is a mechanism which [[Hayflick limit|limits the amount of generations of a single cell may undergo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Shay JW, Wright WE | year = 2011 | title = Role of telomeres and telomerase in cancer | journal = Semin Cancer Biol. | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 349–353 | doi=10.1016/j.semcancer.2011.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, in unicellular organisms like ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', the formation of [[extrachromosomal rDNA circle]]s (ERCs) in mother cells (but not daughter cells) upon every subsequent division is an identifiable type of DNA damage that is associated with replication. These ERCs accumulate over time and eventually trigger replicative senescence and death of the mother cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kaeberlein M, McVey M, Guarente L | year = 1999 | title = The SIR2/3/4 complex and SIR2 alone promote longevity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by two different mechanisms| journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 13 | issue = 19| pages = 2570–2580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==

===Growth and aging===
There is a large body of evidence indicating the negative effects of growth on longevity across many species. As a general rule, individuals of a smaller size generally live longer than larger individuals of the same species.

==== Animal models ====
In [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] models of [[Mus musculus|mice]], such Snell or Ames mice, mutations have arisen, either rendering them incapable of producing IGF-1 or unable to have adequate receptors for IGF-1 uptake. Furthermore, mice injected with growth hormone have been shown to have progressive weight loss, roughing of the coat, [[Scoliosis|curvature of the spine]], [[Hypertrophy|enlargement of the organs]], kidney lesions and [[Cancer|increased cancer risk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Bartke A1, Brown-Borg H | year = 2004 | title = Life extension in the dwarf mouse | journal = Curr Top Dev Biol. | volume = 63 | issue =  | pages = 189–225| doi=10.1016/j.semcancer.2011.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is also seen in different breeds of [[dogs]], where smaller breeds of dogs typically live significantly longer compared to their larger counterparts. Selectively bred for their small size, smaller dog breeds like the [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] (average lifespan of 15–20 years) have the B/B genotype for the IGF-1 [[haplotype]], reducing the amount of IGF-1 produced. Conversely, large dogs like the [[Great Dane]] (average lifespan of 6–8 years) are [[homozygous]] for the IGF-1 I [[allele]], which increases the amount of IGF-1 production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Sutter NB, Bustamante CD, Chase K, Gray MM | year = 2007| title =A Single IGF1 Allele Is a Major Determinant of Small Size in Dogs| journal = Science | volume = 316 | issue = 5821 | pages = 112–115 | doi=10.1126/science.1137045| bibcode =2007Sci...316..112S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Human models====
Initially, it was believed that growth hormone actually prolonged lifespan due to a 1990 study that indicated that injection of [[growth hormone]] to men over 60 years of age appeared to reverse various [[biomarkers]] implicated in aging, such as [[Sarcopenia|decreased muscle mass]], bone density, skin thickness, and increased adipose tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Rudman D1, Feller AG, Nagraj HS, Gergans GA; et al. | year = 1990| title =Effects of human growth hormone in men over 60 years old| journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 323 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–6 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199007053230101}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 1999 study found that administering growth hormone also significantly increased [[mortality rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Takala J1, Ruokonen E, Webster NR, Nielsen MS, Zandstra DF, et al. | year = 1999| title =
Increased mortality associated with growth hormone treatment in critically ill adults| journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 341 | issue = 11 | pages = 785–792 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199909093411102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[Genome Sequencing|genomic studies]] have confirmed that the genes involved in growth hormone uptake and signaling are largely conserved across a plethora of species, such as yeast, nematodes, fruit flies, mice and humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Longo VD, Finch CE.| year = 2003| title =Evolutionary medicine: from dwarf model systems to healthy centenarians?| journal = Science | volume = 299 | issue = 5611 | pages = 1342–1346 | doi=10.1126/science.1077991}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies have also shown that individuals with [[Laron syndrome]], an [[autosomal recessive]] disorder resulting in dwarfism due to defects in growth hormone receptors, have increased lifespan. Additionally, these individuals have much lower [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidences]] of age-related diseases such as [[type 2 diabetes]] and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Guevara-Aguirre J, Balasubramanian P, Guevara-Aguirre M, Wei M; et al. | year = 2011| title = Growth hormone receptor deficiency is associated with a major reduction in pro-aging signaling, cancer, and diabetes in humans | journal = Sci. Transl. Med. | volume = 3 | issue = 70 | pages = 70–83 | doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3001845}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lastly, human [[centenarians]] around the world are disproportionately of [[short stature]], and have low levels of IGF-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Govindaraju D, Atzmon G, Barzilai N. | year = 2015| title =Genetics, lifestyle and longevity: Lessons from centenarians.| journal = Appl Transl Genom.  | volume = 4| issue =  | pages = 23–32 | doi=10.1016/j.atg.2015.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction and aging===
Numerous studies have found that lifespan is inversely correlated with both the total amount of offspring birthed, as well as the age at which females first gives birth, also known as primiparity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Descamps S, Boutin S, Berteaux D, Gaillard JM.| year = 2006| title =Best squirrels trade a long life for an early reproduction| journal = Proc Biol Sci   | volume = 273| issue = 1599 | pages = 2369–2374 | doi= 10.1098/rspb.2006.3588}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it has been found that [[Sexual reproduction|reproduction]] is a costly mechanism that alters the [[Fatty acid metabolism|metabolism of fat]]. [[Lipids]] invested in reproduction would be unable to be allocated to support mechanisms involved in somatic maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hansen M, Flatt T, Aguilaniu H.| year = 2013| title =Reproduction, fat metabolism, and life span: what is the connection?| journal = Cell Metab.| volume = 17| issue = 1 | pages = 10–19 | doi= 10.1016/j.cmet.2012.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==== Animal models ====

The disposable soma theory has been consistent with the majority of animal models. It was found in numerous animal studies that [[castration]] or [[Genetic disorder|genetic deformities]] of [[Reproductive system|reproduction organs]] was [[correlated]] with increased lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Drori D, Folman Y.| year = 1976| title =Environmental effects on longevity in the male rat: exercise, mating, castration and restricted feeding| journal = Exp Gerontol.| volume = 11| issue = 1 | pages = 25–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Flatt T| year = 2011| title =Survival costs of reproduction in ''Drosophila''.| journal = Exp Gerontol.| volume = 46| issue = 5 | pages = 369–375 | doi= 10.1016/j.exger.2010.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hsin H, Kenyon C| year = 1999| title =Signals from the reproductive system regulate the lifespan of ''C. elegans''| journal =Nature| volume =399| issue = 6734 | pages = 362–366 | doi= 10.1038/20694| bibcode =1999Natur.399..362H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in [[red squirrels]], it was found that females with an early primiparity achieved the highest immediate and lifetime reproductive success. However, it was also found that these same individuals had a decreased median and maximum lifespan. Specifically squirrels who mated earlier had a 22.4% rate of mortality until two years of age compared to a 16.5% rate of mortality in late breeders. In addition, these squirrels had an average maximum lifespan of 1035 days compared to an average maximum lifespan of 1245 days for squirrels that bred later.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

In another study, researchers selectively bred [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] over three years to develop two different [[strain (biology)|strain]]s, an early-reproducing strain and a late-reproducing strain. The late-reproducing line had a significantly longer lifespan than the early-reproducing line. Even more telling was that when the researchers introduced a mutation in the [[Ovarian|ovarian-associated]] gene ''ovoD1'', resulting in defective [[oogenesis]], the differences in lifespan between the two lines disappeared. The researchers in this case concluded that "aging has evolved primarily because of the damaging effects of reproduction earlier in life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Sgrò CM, Partridge L| year = 1999| title = A delayed wave of death from reproduction in Drosophila.| journal =Science| volume =286| issue =5449 | pages = 2521–2524 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent aging researcher [[Steven N. Austad|Steven Austad]] also performed a large-scale [[ecological]] study on the [[coast]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1993. Austad isolated two [[opossum]] populations, one from the [[predator]]-infested mainland and one from the predator-absent nearby island of [[Sapelo]]. According to the disposable soma theory, a [[Genetic isolate|genetically isolated]] population subject to low environmentally-induced mortality would evolve delayed reproduction and aging. This is because without the pressure of predation, it would be evolutionarily advantageous to allocate more resources to somatic maintenance than reproduction, as early offspring mortality would be low. As predicted, even after controlling for predation, the isolated population had a longer lifespan, delayed primiparity, and reduced aging biomarkers such as tail [[collagen]] [[Cross linking|cross-linking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Austad, SN| year = 1993| title =Retarded senescence in an insular population of Virginia opossums (''Didelphis virginiana'')| journal = Journal of Zoology| volume = 229| issue = 4 | pages = 695–708 | doi= 10.1111/j.1469-7998.1993.tb02665.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Human models ====

In general, only a few studies exist in human models. It was found that [[Eunuch|castrated men]] live longer than their [[fertile]] counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hamilton JB, Mestler GE| year = 1969| title =Mortality and survival: comparison of eunuchs with intact men and women in a mentally retarded population)| journal = J. Gerontol.| volume = 24| issue = 4 | pages = 395–411 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies found that in British women, primiparity was earliest in women who died early and latest in women who died at the oldest ages. Furthermore, increased number of children birthed was associated with a decreased lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Westendorp RG, Kirkwood TB| year = 1998| title =Human longevity at the cost of reproductive success |journal = Nature| volume = 396| issue = 6713 | pages = 743–746 | doi= 10.1038/25519}}&lt;/ref&gt; A final study found that female centenarians were more likely to have children in later life compared average, especially past the age of 40. The researchers discovered that 19.2% of female centenarians had their first child after the age of 40, compared to 5.5% of the rest of the female population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Perls TT, Alpert L, Fretts RC| year = 1997| title =Middle-aged mothers live longer |journal = Nature| volume = 389| issue = 6647 | pages = 133 | doi= 10.1038/38148| bibcode = 1997Natur.389..133P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship between cell damage and aging===
{{main|Free radical theory}}{{main|DNA damage theory of aging}}
[[File:Naked Mole Rat Eating.jpg|thumb|The [[naked mole rat]] has a [[naked mole rat#Longevity|disproportionately long life of 30 years]] through efficient cellular repair mechanisms.]]
There are numerous studies that support cellular damage, often due to a lack of somatic maintenance mechanisms, as a primary determinant for aging, and these studies have given rise to the [[free radical theory of aging]] and the [[DNA damage theory of aging]]. One study found that the cells of short-living rodents ''[[in vitro]]'' show much greater [[mutation]] rates and a general lack of genome surveillance compared to human cells and are far more susceptible to [[oxidative stress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Lorenzini A, Stamato T, Sell C. | year = 2011| title = The disposable soma theory revisited: time as a resource in the theories of aging | journal = Cell Cycle| volume = 10 | issue = 22 | pages = 3853–3856 | doi=10.4161/cc.10.22.18302}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Other studies have been conducted on the [[naked mole rat]], a rodent species with remarkable longevity (30 years), capable of outliving the [[brown rat]] (3 years) by [[Fold (higher-order function)|ten-fold]]. Additionally, almost no incidence cancer has ever been detected in naked mole rats. Nearly all of the differences found between these two organisms, which are otherwise rather genetically similar, was in somatic maintenance. Naked mole rats were found to have higher levels of [[superoxide dismutase]], a [[reactive oxygen species]] clearing [[antioxidant]]. In addition, naked mole rats had higher levels of [[base excision repair]], DNA damage response signaling, [[Homologous recombination|homologous recombination repair]], [[mismatch repair]], [[nucleotide excision repair]], and [[non-homologous end joining]]. In fact, many of these processes were near or exceeded human levels. Proteins from naked mole rats were also more resistant to [[oxidation]], [[misfolding]], [[ubiquitination]], and had increased [[Translation|translational fidelity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Azpurua J, Ke Z, Chen IX, Zhang Q, Ermolenko DN; et al. | year = 2013| title = Naked mole-rat has increased translational fidelity compared with the mouse, as well as a unique 28S ribosomal RNA cleavage | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A| volume = 110 | issue = 43 | pages =17350–17355 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1313473110| bibcode =2013PNAS..11017350A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further studies have been conducted on patients with [[Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome]] (HGPS), a condition that leads to premature aging. Patients with HGPS typically age about seven times faster than average and usually succumb to the disease in their early teens. Patients with HGPS have cellular defects, specifically in the [[Lamin A protein|lamin proteins]], which regulate the organization of the [[Nuclear lamina|lamina]] and [[nuclear envelope]] for [[mitosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Pollex RL1, Hegele RA | year = 2004| title = Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome | journal = Clin. Genet.| volume = 66| issue = 5 | pages =375–381 | doi=10.1111/j.1399-0004.2004.00315.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Lastly, as mentioned previously, it has been found that the suppression of autophagy is associated with reduced lifespan, while stimulation is associated with extended lifespan. Activated in times of [[caloric restriction]], autophagy is a process that prevents cellular damage through clearance and [[recycling]] of damaged proteins and [[organelles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Glick D1, Barth S, Macleod KF. | year = 2010| title = Autophagy: cellular and molecular mechanisms| journal = J. Pathol. | volume = 221 | issue = 1 | pages =3–12| doi=10.1002/path.2697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism==
One of the main weaknesses of the disposable soma theory is that it does not postulate any specific cellular mechanisms to which an organism shifts energy to somatic repair over reproduction. Instead, it only offers an [[Evolution|evolutionary perspective]] on why aging may occur due to reproduction. Therefore, parts of it are rather limited outside of the field of [[evolutionary biology]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

===Caloric restriction===
{{main|Calorie restriction#Sirtuin-mediated mechanism}}
[[File:Soma Disposable.png|thumb|Schematic showing the reallocation of energy investment towards [[DNA repair|self-repair]] during [[caloric restriction]].]]
Critics have pointed out the supposed [[Inconsistency|inconsistencies]] of the disposable soma theory due to the observed effects of caloric restriction, which is correlated with increased lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Blagosklonny, MV| year = 2010| title = Solving puzzles of aging: From disposable soma to signal-transduction pathways| journal = Russ J Gen Chem. | volume = 80 | issue = | pages =1407}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it activates autophagy, according to classical disposable soma principles, with less [[Caloric|caloric intake]], there would less total energy to be distributed towards somatic maintenance, and decreased lifespan would be observed (or at least the positive autophagic effects would be balanced out). However, Kirkwood, alongside his collaborator Darryl P. Shanley, assert that caloric restriction triggers an adaptive mechanism which causes the organism to shift a higher proportion of resources to somatic maintenance, away from reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Shanley DP, Kirkwood TB.| year = 2000| title = Calorie restriction and aging: a life-history analysis.| journal = Evolution | volume = 54 | issue =3 | pages =1407}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is supported by multiple studies, which show that caloric restriction typically results in [[Sterility (physiology)|impaired fertility]], but leave an otherwise healthy organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Holliday R.| year = 2000| title = Food, reproduction and longevity: is the extended lifespan of calorie-restricted animals an evolutionary adaptation?| journal = BioEssays | volume = 10 | issue =4 | pages =125–127|doi=10.1002/bies.950100408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Masoro EJ, Austad SN.| year = 1996| title = The evolution of the antiaging action of dietary restriction: a hypothesis.| journal = J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci | volume = 51 | issue =6 | pages =387–391}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionarily, an organism would want to delay reproduction to when resources were more plentiful. During a resource-barren period, it would evolutionarily unwise to invest resources in progeny that would be unlikely to survive in [[famine]]. Mechanistically, the [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]]-dependent [[Deacetylate|deacetylase]] [[Sirtuin 1]] (SIRT-1) is upregulated during low-nutrient periods. SIRT-1 increases [[insulin sensitivity]], decreases the amount of [[inflammatory cytokine]]s, stimulates autophagy, and activates FOXO, the aforementioned protein involved in activating stress response genes. SIRT-1 is also found to result in decreased fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Cantó C, Auwerx J.| year = 2009| title = Caloric restriction, SIRT1 and longevity.| journal =Trends Endocrinol Metab| volume = 20 | issue =7 | pages =325–331|doi=10.1016/j.tem.2009.03.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In additional to differential [[wikt:partitioning|partitioning]] of energy allocation during caloric restriction, less caloric intake would result in less metabolic waste in the forms of [[free radicals]] like [[hydrogen peroxide]], [[superoxide]] and [[hydroxyl radicals]], which damage important cellular components, particularly [[mitochondria]]. Elevated levels of free radicals in mice has been correlated with neurodegeneration, [[Myocardial|myocardial injury]], [[Anemia|severe anemia]], and premature death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Pérez VI, Bokov A, Van Remmen H, Mele J; et al.| year = 2009| title = Is the oxidative stress theory of aging dead?| journal =Biochim Biophys Acta| volume = 1790 | issue =10 | pages =1005–1014|doi=10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Grandmother hypothesis===
{{main|Menopause#Evolutionary rationale}}
Another primary criticism of the disposable soma theory is that it fails to account for why women tend to live longer than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Ginter E, Simko V | year = 2013| title = Women live longer than men| journal = Bratisl Lek Listy.  | volume = 114 | issue = 2 | pages =45–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterall, females invest significantly more resources into reproduction and according to the classical disposable soma principles, this would compromise energy diverted to somatic maintenance. However, this can be reconciled with the [[grandmother hypothesis]]. The Grandmother Hypothesis states that [[menopause]] comes about into older women in order to restrict the time of reproduction as a protective mechanism. This would allow women to live longer and increase the amount of care they could provide to their [[grandchildren]], increasing their evolutionary fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hawkes K | year = 2003| title = Grandmothers and the evolution of human longevity| journal = Am. J. Hum. Biol.| volume =15 | issue =3  | pages =380–400| doi= 10.1002/ajhb.10156}}&lt;/ref&gt; And so, although women do invest a greater proportion of resources into reproduction during their [[Age and female fertility|fertile years]], their overall reproductive period is significantly shorter than men, who are able of reproduction during and even beyond [[middle age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Vinicius L, Mace R, Migliano A| year = 2014| title = Variation in Male Reproductive Longevity across Traditional Societies| journal = PLoS One| volume =9 | issue =11  | pages =e112236| doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0112236| bibcode =2014PLoSO...9k2236V}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, males invest more resources into growth, and have significantly higher levels of IGF-1 compared to females, which is correlated with decreased lifespan. Other variables such as increased [[Testosterone|testosterone levels]] in males are not accounted for. Increased testosterone is often associated with reckless behaviour, which may lead to a high accidental death rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Celec P, Ostatníková D, Hodosy J. | year = 2015| title = On the effects of testosterone on brain behavioral functions| journal = Front. Neurosci.| volume =9 | issue =  | pages =12| doi=10.3389/fnins.2015.00012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contradicting models === 
A few [[Contradiction|contradicting]] animal models weaken the validity of the disposable soma theory. This includes studies done on the aforementioned naked mole rats. In these studies, it was found that reproductive naked mole rats actually show significantly increased lifespans compared to non-reproductive individuals, which contradicts the principles of diposable soma. However, although these naked mole rats are [[mammalian]], they are highly [[atypical]] in terms of aging studies and may not serve as the best model for humans. For example, naked mole rats have a disproportionately high longevity quotient and live in [[Eusociality|eusocial societies]], where breeding is usually designated to a [[Eusociality#In mammals|queen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Dammann P, Burda H | year = 2006| title =Sexual activity and reproduction delay ageing in a mammal.| journal = Curr. Biol.| volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 117–118 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.02.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex biases and environment ===
The disposable soma theory is tested disproportionately on female organisms for the relationship between reproduction and aging, as [[Parental investment#Females as the more investing sex|females carry a greater burden in reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hammers M, Richardson DS, Burke T, Komdeur J. | year = 2013| title = The impact of reproductive investment and early-life environmental conditions on senescence: support for the disposable soma hypothesis.| journal = J Evol Biol | volume = 26| issue = 9 | pages = 1999–2007| doi=10.1111/jeb.12204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, for the relationship between growth and aging, studies are disproportionately conducted on males, to minimize the [[Estrogen|hormonal fluctuations]] that occur with [[Menstrual cycle|menstrual cycling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Wu JJ, Liu J, Chen EB, Wang JJ; et al. | year = 2013| title = Increased mammalian lifespan and a segmental and tissue-specific slowing of aging after genetic reduction of mTOR expression| journal = Cell Rep. | volume = 4| issue = 5 | pages = 913–920| doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2013.07.030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, [[aging#Biological basis|genetic]] and [[Gene–environment interaction|environmental factors]], rather than reproductive patterns, may explain the variations in human lifespan. For example, studies have shown that [[Poverty|poorer individuals]], to whom nutritious food and [[medical care]] is less accessible, typically have higher birth rates and earlier primiparity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Murray, S. | year = 2006| title = Poverty and health| journal = CMAJ | volume = 174| issue = 7 | pages = 923| doi=10.1503/cmaj.060235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edith Sharpley''' (1859–1940) was the Classical Lecturer at [[Newnham College, Cambridge]] from 1884 to 1910.{{sfn|Gloyn|2015}}{{sfn|Gloyn|2016}}

==Life==
Sharpley was the second of ten children{{sfn|Whyles|2016}} born to Sarah McNicoll and Dr Thomas Sharpley in [[Louth, Lincolnshire|Louth]] in Lincolnshire. She was born on 24 January 1859&lt;ref name=venn/&gt; and went to several schools in Louth, [[Taunton]] and Paris before attending [[Manchester High School for Girls|Manchester High School]]. She started at [[Newnham College]] in 1879, eleven years before her sister Mary McNicoll Sharpley in 1890.{{sfn|Whyles|2016}}

Sharpley is the first student at Newnham who is recorded as having coxed a boat on the [[River Cam]] - in 1879. This was fifteen years before bicycles were permitted at Newnham.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newnhamcollegeboatclub.com/History.html History], Newnham College Boat Club, Retrieved 15 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; She took a [[British undergraduate degree classification#First-class honours|first]] in part II of the [[Classical Tripos]] for which philosophy was her specialist subject.  She then became a lecturer in Classics at the college, focussing on teaching rather than research and writing. She was a lifelong correspondent of [[Eleanor Sidgwick]] and assisted [[Blanche Athena Clough]] in caring for her aunt [[Anne Clough]]{{sfn|Gloyn|2015}} who had been Newnham's first principal. Sharpley was the first registrar of the roll of students and became vice principal in 1911.  One student wrote of "the fastidiousness of her taste and the ruthlessness of her judgement".{{sfn|Stray|p=401}}

Sharpley was elected to Newnham's governing body from 1919 to 1922. She died on 14 April 1940.&lt;ref name=venn&gt;[http://venn.lib.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search-2016B.pl?sur=sharpley&amp;suro=w&amp;fir=edith&amp;firo=c&amp;cit=&amp;cito=c&amp;c=all&amp;z=all&amp;tex=&amp;sye=&amp;eye=&amp;col=all&amp;maxcount=50 Sharpley search], Lib.cam.ac.uk, Retrieved 16 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Ernest Walker Marwick '''  (1915-1977) was a Scottish writer noted for his writings on [[Orkney]] folklore and history.

Marwick's father was a travelling salesman who had a [[smallholding]] in the parish of [[Evie, Orkney|Evie]], to the north of [[Mainland, Orkney]]. Diagnosed with [[Scoliosis]] in 1925 when he was ten-years-old, Marwick could no longer attend school as his days had to be spent lying on a wooden board. He used the time of illness to read extensively.{{sfnp|Fergusson|2006|pp=91, 92|ps=}}

After Marwick's marriage his home provided a meeting-place for local intellectuals, including [[George Mackay Brown]] and [[Robert Rendall]].{{sfnp|Fergusson|2006|p=94|ps=}} His ''Anthology of Orkney Verse'' was published in 1949.{{sfnp|Murray|Murray|2004|p=40 |ps=}}

From 1955 to 1960 he was on the staff of the ''[[Orkney Herald]]'' newspaper.  He subsequently moved to ''[[The Orcadian]]'', his writing covering literary subjects.{{sfnp|Murray|Murray|2004|pp=82, 99|ps=}} Other media work undertaken by Marwick included broadcasting on local and Scottish national radio programmes.{{r|Ljosland}}

Ernest Marwick was a founder member of the [[Orkney Heritage Society]].{{sfnp|Robertson|1991|p=xvi|ps=}}

He died in July 1977, having swerved off a straight road and crashed into a farm steading when driving.{{sfnp|Fergusson|2006|p=259|ps=}} In 2015, one hundred years after his birth, [[Orkney International Science Festival]] focused attention on the contributions he made to Orkney's heritage.{{r|Science}}

'''Frane Bulić''' (October 4, 1846 - July 29, 1934) was a [[Croats|Croatian]] priest, archaeologist, and historian. 

Bulić was born in [[Vranjic]], near [[Split (city)|Split]], and studied theology in [[Zadar]] and then classical [[philology]] and archeology in [[Vienna]]. He became the curator of the archaeological museum in Split, and was entrusted with the conservation of cultural and historical antiquities over all of [[Dalmatia]]. 

He was also active politically. He was elected the representative of the county of Split in the Dalmatian parliament and as representative of Dalmatia in the [[Reichsrat (Austria)|Imperial Council]] in Vienna. He withdrew from politics during the time of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], after the Sixth of January dictatorship proclaimed by [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Aleksandar Karađorđević]] in 1929.

His archeological discoveries provided great contributions to the understanding of early [[History of Christianity|Christian]] and [[History of Croatia|Croatian]] history in Dalmatia. Bulić led archaeological expeditions in many locations, but especially in [[Solin, Croatia|Solin]]. He discovered a basilica within the local monastery which contained the buried martyrs [[Dujam]] and [[Venancije]] from the time of the Roman Emperor [[Diocletian]]. 

In 1891, he discovered a piece of stone which contained an inscription of the early Croatian ruler, knez [[Trpimir]]. In 1898 he found the sarcophagus of queen [[Jelena]] dating back to 976. Together with his associates, he succeeded in putting the writing on the damaged piece together to figure out the complete inscription. Historians consider this one of the most important documents of Croatian history in the Middle Ages because it provided information about the genealogy of [[Kings of Croatia|Croatian kings]]. 

Also near Solin, Bulić discovered the foundations of the Church of Saint Mary and the Church of Saint Stephen, in which members of the Croatian ruling houses were buried, including king [[Mihajlo Krešimir II]] and his wife [[Jelena of Zadar]] who was a benefactress of the churches.

In 1894 Bulić founded the Bihać organization for the preservation of history from the age of Croatian national rulers. His reputation helped Split and Solin host the first [[International Congress of Christian Archaeology]] in 1894. He was also a member of many local and international archeological organizations. Bulić published many articles and books, the most notable of which are: ''Hrvatski spomenici u kninskoj okolici uz ostale suvremene dalmatinske iz doba narodne hrvatske dinastije'' (Croatian monuments in the Knin area and Dalmatia from the age of Croatian national dynasties), ''Palača cara Dioklecijana u Splitu'' (Palace of Emperor Diocletian in Split), ''Stopama hrvatskih narodnih vladara'' (The steps of the Croatian national rulers). 

Bulić died in 1934 in Zagreb. His funeral was conducted by bishops [[Kvirin Klement Bonefačić]] and [[Aloysius Stepinac]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20040730/split01.asp Dan Frane for eternity]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
Bulic was a [[Papal Chamberlain]] and he was awarded several orders and decorations, including Commander 2nd Class of the [[Albert Order|Royal Saxon Albrecht Order]] 23.03.1908

[[Image:Bing Crosby 1942.jpg|thumb|210px|Bing Crosby in 1942]]

'''Hipster''' or '''hepcat''', as used in the 1940s, referred to [[Fan (person)|aficionados]] of [[jazz]], in particular [[bebop]], which became popular in the early 1940s. The hipster adopted the lifestyle of the jazz musician, including some or all of the following: dress, slang, use of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and other drugs, relaxed attitude, sarcastic humor, self-imposed poverty, and relaxed sexual codes.

==History==
[[image:Charlie Parker, Tommy Potter, Miles Davis, Max Roach (Gottlieb 06941).jpg|thumb|240px|Charlie Parker (known as Bird) at Three Deuces in New York]]
The words ''hep'' and ''hip'' are of uncertain origin, with numerous competing theories being proposed. In the early days of jazz, musicians were using the ''hep'' variant to describe anybody who was "in the know" about an emerging culture, mostly black, which revolved around jazz. They and their fans were known as ''hepcats''. By the late 1930s, with the rise of [[swing music|swing]], ''[[hip (slang)|hip]]'' rose in popularity among jazz musicians, to replace ''hep''. Clarinetist [[Artie Shaw]] described singer [[Bing Crosby]] as "the first hip white person born in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, James, "[https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200102/marcus The First Hip White Person]." 2001. ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]''. Retrieved 2008-03-02&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, the word ''hepster'' was used by [[Cab Calloway]] in the title of his ''Hepster's Dictionary'', which defines ''hep cat'' as "a guy who knows all the answers, understands jive". In 1944, pianist [[Harry Gibson]] modified this to ''hipster''&lt;ref&gt;"At that time musicians used jive talk among themselves and many customers were picking up on it. One of these words was hep which described someone in the know. When lots of people started using hep, musicians changed to hip. I started calling people hipsters and greeted customers who dug the kind of jazz we were playing as 'all you hipsters.' Musicians at the club began calling me Harry the Hipster; so I wrote a new tune called 'Handsome Harry the Hipster.'" -- Harry Gibson, "Everybody's Crazy But Me" (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; in his short glossary "For Characters Who Don't Dig Jive Talk", published in 1944 with the album ''Boogie Woogie In Blue'', featuring the self-titled hit "Handsome Harry the Hipster".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hyzercreek.com/hipsterglossary.jpg|title=Hipster Glossary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entry for ''hipsters'' defined them as "characters who like hot jazz."

Hipsters were more interested in [[bebop]] and "hot" jazz than they were in swing, which by the late 1940s was becoming old-fashioned and watered down by "[[square (slang)|squares]]" like [[Lawrence Welk]], [[Guy Lombardo]] and Robert Coates. In the 1940s, white youth began to frequent African-American communities for their [[music]] and [[dance]]. These first youths diverged from the mainstream due to their new [[philosophies]] of racial diversity and their exploratory sexual nature and drug habits. The drug of choice was marijuana, many hipster [[Glossary of jive talk|slang terms]] were dedicated to the substance.

In his book ''Jazz: A History'' (1977), Frank Tirro defines the 1940s hipster:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To the hipster, [[Charlie Parker|Bird]] was a living justification of their philosophy. The hipster is an underground man. He is to the [[Second World War]] what the [[dada]]ist was to the [[World War I|first]]. He is amoral, anarchistic, gentle, and overcivilized to the point of decadence. He is always ten steps ahead of the game because of his awareness, an example of which might be meeting a girl and rejecting her, because he knows they will date, hold hands, kiss, neck, pet, fornicate, perhaps marry, divorce—so why start the whole thing? He knows the hypocrisy of bureaucracy, the hatred implicit in religions—so what values are left for him?—except to go through life avoiding pain, keep his emotions in check, and after that, "be cool," and look for kicks. He is looking for something that transcends all this bullshit and finds it in jazz.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Marty Jezer]], in ''The Dark Ages: Life in the United States 1945–1960'' (1999), provides another definition:

{{quote|The hipster world that Kerouac and Ginsberg drifted in and out of from the mid-1940s to the early-1950s was an amorphous movement without ideology, more a pose than an attitude; a way of "being" without attempting to explain why. Hipsters themselves were not about to supply explanations. Their language, limited as it was, was sufficiently obscure to defy translation into everyday speech. Their rejection of the commonplace was so complete that they could barely acknowledge reality. The measure of their withdrawal was their distrust of language. A word like ''cool'' could mean any of a number of contradictory things—its definition came not from the meaning of the word but from the emotion behind it and the accompanying non-verbal facial or body expressions. When hipsters did put together a coherent sentence, it was always prefaced with the word ''like'' as if to state at the onset that what would follow was probably an illusion. There was neither a future nor a past, only a present that existed on the existential wings of sound. A Charlie Parker bebop solo—that was the truth.

The hipster's world view was not divided between "free world" and "Communist bloc", and this too set it apart from the then-current orthodoxy. Hipster dualism, instead, transcended geopolitical lines in favor of levels of consciousness. The division was ''hip'' and ''square''. Squares sought security and conned themselves into political acquiescence. Hipsters, hip to the bomb, sought the meaning of life and, expecting death, demanded it now. In the wigged-out, flipped-out, zonked-out hipster world, Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, Truman, McCarthy and Eisenhower shared one thing in common: they were squares ... [T]he hipster signified the coming together of the bohemian, the juvenile delinquent, and the negro.}}

==Role reversal==

===Racial roles===
The new philosophy of racial role reversal was transcribed by many popular hipster authors of the time. [[Norman Mailer]]'s 1957 pamphlet, entitled "[[The White Negro]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Norman Mailer, "The White Negro," Fall 1957, reprinted in Dissent, Winter 2008|url=http://www.learntoquestion.com/resources/database/archives/003327.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; has become the paradigmatic example of hipster ideology. Mailer describes hipsters as individuals "with a middle-class background (who) attempt to put down their whiteness and adopt what they believe is the carefree, spontaneous, cool lifestyle of Negro hipsters: their manner of speaking and language, their use of milder narcotics, their appreciation of jazz and the blues, and their supposed concern with the good orgasm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/gtmarx/www/whitenegro.html|title=The White Negro|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a nod to Mailer's discussion of hipsterism, the United States' [[Cold War]] deployments of [[African American]] culture and personalities for the purposes of [[public diplomacy]] has been discussed as "hipster diplomacy".&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, B. R., ''Artistic Ambassadors: Literary and International Representation of the New Negro Era'' ([[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]]: [[University of Virginia Press]], 2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=pZET9DY05LUC&amp;pg=PT145#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 145–148].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8118">The Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board was a state agency in Florida that participated in the restoration and preservation of St. Augustine, Florida from 1959-1997.
== Overview ==
[[File:HSAPB logo.jpg|thumb|HSAPB logo]]
The Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board (HSAPB) was a seven-member state commission, created by [[LeRoy Collins|Governor LeRoy Collins]] in 1959 "to acquire, restore, preserve, maintain, reconstruct, reproduce, and operate" historic structures in the city of [[St. Augustine, Florida]]. The HSAPB set out to restore and reconstruct Spanish colonial era buildings in a focused area of downtown St. Augustine in anticipation of the city's Quadricentennial Celebration in 1965, and maintained a research library of documentary evidence to support their preservation and interpretation efforts. The HSAPB was sundowned by the ''State of Florida'' in June 1997.

== St. Augustine Restoration and Preservation Commission ==
In March 1958, a group from St. Augustine made a presentation to Governor LeRoy Collins to propose a [[historic preservation]] program for the city’s historic downtown. House Bill 774 was signed into law on June 11, 1959, establishing the St. Augustine Historical Restoration and Preservation Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fall.fsulawrc.com/collection/FlaStat/FlaStat1959/vol1/FlaStat1959v1OCR_Part24.pdf|title=Florida Statutes, 1959, Chapter 266: St. Augustine Historical Restoration and Preservation Commission|last=Florida Legislature|first=|date=1959|website=Florida State University College of Law Research Center|publisher=State of Florida|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bill also granted $150,000 of state funds to begin their work. The primary objective of their program was to recreate [[Spanish Colonial architecture|Spanish colonial architecture]] and culture of St. Augustine during the period of 1565 to 1821 in advance of the city’s Quadricentennial Celebration in 1965. The buildings restored and reconstructed represent structures of the [[History of Florida|First Spanish Period]] (to 1763), British Period (1763-83), Second Spanish Period (1783-1821, and the early American Period (after 1821).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guide Book|last=Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board|first=|publisher=Division of Cultural Affairs, Department of State, State of Florida|year=1971|isbn=|location=|pages=5-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Original members of the Commission included H.E. Wolfe, Leonard Usina, William F. Rolleston, William L. Sims, II, and Henrietta Poynter. Wolfe, a resident of St. Augustine, was the Commission’s first chairman. The Commission hired consultant Earle Newton to help them develop a strategic plan for restoration and preservation, and soon began historical and archaeological research for the properties they proposed to restore.

The Commission’s first restoration project was the Arrivas House on St. George Street. Then-Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] visited St. Augustine on March 11, 1963 to dedicate the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Big Day in St. Augustine|last=|first=|date=March 12, 1963|work=The Florida Times-Union|access-date=|location=Jacksonville, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission used the second floor of the Arrivas House as their administrative offices until 1970, when they moved operations to [[Government House (St. Augustine)|Government House]].

== San Agustín Antiguo ==
The Commission opened a [[Living museum|living history museum village]] in its restored area in 1963, calling it San Agustín Antiguo. Costumed interpreters gave tours of restored buildings and demonstrated a variety of arts and crafts typical of the First and Second Spanish Periods, as well as of the British Period. These included [[Blacksmithing|blacksmithing,]] [[weaving]], [[printing]], [[History of candle making|candle dipping]], [[silversmithing]], [[pottery]], [[baking]], and [[Leather|leather making]]. Today a portion of the original museum village still demonstrates early Spanish life in St. Augustine at the [[Colonial Quarter]].

== Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board ==
On May 5, 1970, the St. Augustine Historical Restoration and Preservation Commission was renamed the Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board, enacted by Florida Statute Section 266.01-07.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fall.fsulawrc.com/collection/FlaStat/FlaStat1970/vsupp/FlaStat1970Supp_OCR_Part4.pdf|title=Florida Statutes 1970, Chapter 266.01: Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board of Trustees, creation.|last=Florida Legislature|first=|date=1970|website=Florida State University School of Law Research Center|publisher=State of Florida.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board continued to fulfill their mission until 1997.

== Sundown and Aftermath ==
The Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board was abolished by the State of Florida in June 1997 in accordance with the [[Sunset provision|Sundown Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=View%20Statutes&amp;SubMenu=1&amp;App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=preservation+board&amp;URL=Ch0267/Sec171.HTM|title=Florida Statute Title XVII, Chapter 267.171|last=Florida Legislature|first=|date=|website=Online Sunshine: The Official Internet Site of the Florida Legislature|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the City of St. Augustine took over management of the historic properties. Today, the legacy of the Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board lives on through [[University of Florida Historic St. Augustine, Inc.|UF Historic St. Augustine, Inc.]] (UFHSA), a direct support organization of the [[University of Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://staugustine.ufl.edu/governance.html|title=UF Historic St. Augustine Governance|last=|first=|date=10/25/2018|website=UF Historic St. Augustine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11/13/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the properties restored or reconstructed by the Board are owned by the State of Florida and managed by UFHSA on its behalf. The remaining records and research materials of the Board are held at Governor’s House Library in Government House Cultural Center and Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cms.uflib.ufl.edu/govhouse/Index.aspx|title=Governor's House Library|last=University of Florida|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of public transport authorities in Manchester''' details the various organisations that have been responsible for the public transport network in and around [[Manchester]], England, since 1824.

==Timeline==
*On 1 January 1824, the first horse bus service started by [[John Greenwood (bus operator)|John Greenwood]], the proprietor of the [[Pendleton, Greater Manchester|Pendleton]] Toll Gates
*On 1 March 1865, the [[Manchester Carriage Company]] was formed which brought together a number of horse-bus operators in the Manchester area.
*In 1880 this became the [[Manchester Carriage and Tramways Company]] with some further consolidation, including the [[Manchester Suburban Tramways Company]].
*On 7 June 1901, [[Manchester Corporation Tramways| Manchester Corporation Tramways Department]] started electric tram operations, as the public operation. The former Carriage Company was wound up in 1903
*In 1929 the name was changed to  Manchester Corporation Transport Department to reflect the changing to motor buses
*In mid-1966 the name of this public operation was changed to Manchester City Transport.
*On 1 November 1969, control of Manchester City Transport and other surrounding council transport departments were transferred to South East Lancashire North East Cheshire Passenger Transport Executive (SELNEC PTE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.selnec.org.uk/gmt_beyond.htm Greater Manchester Transport and beyond] Selnec Preservation Society&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 1 April 1974, SELNEC'S operating name became Greater Manchester Transport, and its coverage was expanded.
*During 1974 Greater Manchester Transport was rebranded as the [[Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive]] (GMPTE). This lasted until 2011.
**On 27 February 1986, Greater Manchester Transport's bus operation was transferred to a separate entity, Greater Manchester Buses Limited,&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/01992869 Companies House extract company no 1992869] Greater Manchester Buses Limited&lt;/ref&gt; to comply with the [[Transport Act 1985]], adopting the [[GM Buses]] trading name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/26th-july-1986/18/11-tyne-and-wear-passenger-transport-executive-and Tyne &amp; Wear Passenger Transport Executive and Greater Manchesger] ''[[Commercial Motor]]'' 26 July 1986&lt;/ref&gt;
**On 13 December 1993, GM Buses was further split into GMB North&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/02818607 Companies House extract company no 2818607] First Manchester Limited formerly Greater Manchester Buses North Limited&lt;/ref&gt; and GMB South&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/02818654 Companies House extract company no 2818654] Greater Manchester Buses South Limited&lt;/ref&gt; on an approximate geographic basis. Just under four months later they were sold to [[Management buyout|employee buy out]] teams.
**In February 1996, GMB South was sold to [[Stagecoach Group]],  becoming [[Stagecoach Manchester]].
**In March 1996, GMB North was sold to [[FirstGroup|First Bus]], eventually becoming [[First Greater Manchester]].{{r|TransportMuseum}}
*In April 2011. GMPTE became [[Transport for Greater Manchester]] (TfGM).{{r|TFGM}}

Jaime Victoriano Martin was born as Percal y Torres&lt;ref&gt;[http://postimg.org/image/qbbrnqqoh/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; and it is not clear in what circumstances the family changed their surname to del Burgo. Nothing is known about his early childhood; as a teenager he trained to become "[[:es:Peritaje mercantil|perito mercantil]]"&lt;ref&gt;Garralda Arizcun 2008; ''ABC'' 25.10.05 claims he was "profesor mercantil", see [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/2005/10/25/044.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; at unidentified school, possibly in [[Villava]].&lt;ref&gt;at that time the only local institution enabling this sort of career was Escuela de Peritos Agrícolas in Villava&lt;/ref&gt; He has never pursued a professional commercial career; during his adolescence years he was increasingly engaged in public activities, consuming more and more of his time.

Already as a youngster del Burgo engaged in the Carlist juvenile organization, [[Juventud Jaimista]], in 1930 becoming secretary of the Navarrese branch of the organization;&lt;ref&gt;''Diario de Navarra'' 25.10.05&lt;/ref&gt; a year later he set up a local Carlist weekly ''La Esperanza'', trying his hand as an editor, manager and contributor.&lt;ref&gt;Garralda Arizcun 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1931 he was among those founding provincial branch&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Ferrer Muñoz, ''Carlismo y violencia en la II República 1931-36: la organización del Requeté vasco-navarro'', [in:] ''Sociedad Benéfica de Historiadores Aficionados y Creadores'' website available [http://www.sbhac.net/Republica/Introduccion/Conspira/Carlistas.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; of the newly born national Carlist student association, [[Agrupación Escolar Tradicionalista]].&lt;ref&gt;founded in 1930 as a belligerent competitor to Confederación de Estudiantes Católicos Españoles, Eduardo González Calleja, ''Rebelión en las aulas: un siglo de movilizaciones estudiantiles en España (1865-1968)'', [in:] ''Ayer'' 59 (2005), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Remaining at its helm until the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]],&lt;ref&gt;Garralda Arizcun 2008&lt;/ref&gt; del Burgo exercised enormous influence on the group and beyond, especially as in 1934 it launched its press tribune, the ''a.e.t.'' weekly.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Blinkhorn, ''Carlism and Crisis in Spain 1931-1939'', Cambridge 1975, {{ISBN|9780521207294}}, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially Navarrese AET focused on juvenile activities like sport, leisure and outdoor, though they were increasingly flavored by cult of brotherhood, Carlist heroes, activism and virility,&lt;ref&gt;embodied e.g. in long, exhaustive night marches around Pamplona, Javier Ugarte Tellería, ''La nueva Covadonga insurgente: orígenes sociales y culturales de la sublevación de 1936 en Navarra y el País Vasco'', Madrid 1998, {{ISBN|847030531X}}, 9788470305313, pp. 280-281&lt;/ref&gt; combined with anti-materialist spiritualism and a drive for change.&lt;ref&gt;Ugarte Tellería 1998, pp. 276-290&lt;/ref&gt; A present scholar relates them to [[Georges Sorel|Sorel]], [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|Marinetti]], [[T.S. Eliot]] and [[W. B. Yeats]],&lt;ref&gt;Ugarte Tellería 1998, pp. 280-1&lt;/ref&gt; also drawing parallels between aetistas and a [[Millenarism|millenarist]] Romanian ultra-Right [[Legion of Archangel Michael]];&lt;ref&gt;Ugarte Tellería 1998, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; another one points to fascist influence&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo González Calleja, ''La violencia y sus discursos. Los límites de la "fascistización" de la derecha española durante el régimen de la II República'', [in:] ''Ayer'' 71 (2008), pp. 85-116, esp sub-chapter ''"Cruzados de la causa": la reactualización de la cultura insurreccional carlista'', pp. 94-102&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the Sorelian thread manifested itself by social radicalism of Del Burgo and ''a.e.t.'' The group departed from orthodox Traditionalist line, commiserating with masses of miserable beings pitted against the politically dominant potentates; they advocated limitation of wealth and regularization of profits. Contemptuous towards Carlist landowners like [[José María Lamamié de Clairac|José Lamamié]] and [[Jaime Chicharro Sánchez-Guió|Jaime Chicharro]], the students supported Agrarian Reform, obstructed by feudal egoism of the odious grandees of grain.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 1975, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; The group called for a Carlist Revolution&lt;ref&gt;some scholars see 2 trends: carlismo nacional and revolución carlista, Juan Carlos Peñas Bernaldo de Quirós, ''El Carlismo, la República y la Guerra Civil (1936-1937). De la conspiración a la unificación'', Madrid 1996, {{ISBN|8487863523}}, 9788487863523, p. 21; some authors reduce del Burgo’s revolution to socia issues, see Julio Aróstegui, Eduardo Calleja, ''La tradición recuperada: El requeté carlista y la insurrección'', [in:] ''Historia Contemporanea'' 11 (1994), p.  38. He declared: "Somos revolucionarios. Lo oyen ustedes? Revolucionarios!", quoted after Eduardo Gonzales Calleja, ''Contrarrevolucionarios'', Madrid 2011, {{ISBN|9788420664552}}, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; aiming at a good clean-up of society,&lt;ref&gt;Ugarte Tellería 1998, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; and was greeted with amazement by the older Carlist generation.
[[File:A.e.t..JPG|thumbnail|''a.e.t''.]]
The rupturista stance of the aetistas had nothing in common with social radicalism of the [[Second Spanish Republic|republican]] Left.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 1975, p. 174; a somewhat opposite view in Steven Henry Martin, ''The Commonality of Enemies: Carlism and anarchism in modern Spain, 1868-1937'' [MA thesis], Peterborough 2014, p. 120: "young Carlists in the age of mass politics of the early 20th century, like those in the Agrupación de Estudiantes Tradicionalistas (AET), were incorporating ideas about egalitarianism, autonomy and wealth redistribution that linked the old values of Carlism to the new ones of anarchism"&lt;/ref&gt; It remained extremely hostile towards the mass workers’ parties, their militancy to be confronted with vengeance and repaid with "bomb, dagger and fire",&lt;ref&gt;"seamos hombres y sepamos vengar al caído; aunque sea haciendo poner para todo el año a los socialistas crespones de luto en sus centros: Porque contra esos cualquier procedimiento que se utilice es bueno: la bomba, el puñal y el incendio", quoted after José María Esparza Zabalegi, ''Agur, Del Burgo'', [in:] ''Diario de Noticias de Navarra'', see [http://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/foro/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=18123&amp;start=30 noticias de navarra forum]&lt;/ref&gt; the cult of activism bordering the cult of violence. Strategy of Carlist leaders was denounced as ineffective; in 1934 del Burgo and the young, having declared themselves rebels fed up with legality, accused the old junteros of 3 years of inactivity,&lt;ref&gt;Ugarte Tellería 1998, pp. 284-287&lt;/ref&gt; their only achievement having been the alliance with caciques and debris of the fallen liberal monarchy. AET despised parliamentary activities of the party elders&lt;ref&gt;Ugarte Tellería 1998, p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; and especially accommodation with the [[Alfonsist monarchist|Alfonsists]].&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 1975, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The intemperate tone of the aetistas shocked the Navarrese Carlist authorities and made them call for moderation.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 1975, pp. 134-5; Ugarte Tellería 1998, p. 279 claims that Joaquín Baleztena consented to the ''a.e.t.'' tone&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Del Burgo did not regret [[Tomás Domínguez Arévalo]] resignation and welcomed the appointment of [[Manuel Fal Conde]].&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 1975, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requeté==
In 1931 del Burgo engaged in the Carlist militia [[Requeté]], at that time undergoing rapid expansion and partial restructuring.&lt;ref&gt;Aróstegui, Calleja 1994, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; He demonstrated enormous dedication and great organizational capacity,&lt;ref&gt;Ugarte Tellería 1998, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; along [[Generoso Huarte]]&lt;ref&gt;Huarte was conservative and somaten-style, while Burgo was radical and callejero-style, Ugarte Tellería 1998, pp. 267, 277&lt;/ref&gt; becoming one of key field commanders and focusing on the province of Pamplona.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 1975, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Participating in street brawls against [[PSOE|socialist]] groups,&lt;ref&gt;José María Esparza Zabalegi, ''Agur, Del Burgo'', [in:] ''Diario de Noticias de Navarra'', quoted after [http://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/opinion/foros/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=18123&amp;start=30 noticias de navarra forum]&lt;/ref&gt; he was arrested following the clashes of April 1932.&lt;ref&gt;denounced in the press as "matón terrorista e incendiario"; some scholars charge him with provoking riots with cost 2 lives, see Iñaki Egaña, ''Los crímenes de Franco en Euskal Herria, 1936-1940'', Tafalla 2009, {{ISBN|8481365599}}, 9788481365597, pp. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt; Charged with trafficking arms – which he did indeed – del Burgo was acquitted due to lack of evidence, though in total he remained behind bars for 6 months.&lt;ref&gt;''Diario de Navarra'' 25.10.05, Blinkhorn 1975, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; Released, he again became one of the most active Requeté operatives in Navarre,&lt;ref&gt;Ugarte Tellería 1998, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; especially under the new, strictly military organization engineered by [[José Enrique Varela|Varela]].&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Ferrer Muñoz, ''Carlismo y violencia en la II República 1931-36: la organización del Requeté vasco-navarro'', [in:] ''Sociedad Benéfica de Historiadores Aficionados y Creadores'' website&lt;/ref&gt;

Early 1934 del Burgo led one of the two already formed Pamplona piquetes.&lt;ref&gt;according to the Requeté structure as designed by Varela, a tercio (battalion) consisted of 3 requetés (250 men each); a requeté in turn consisted of 3 piquetes (70 men each), see Antonio Lizarza, ''Memorias de la conspiración'', [in:] ''Navarra fue la primera'', Pamplona 2006, {{ISBN|8493508187}}, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; During the spring he and 14 other Carlists travelled to [[Fascist Italy (1922–43)|Italy]] under the false [[Peru]]vian identities; at the [[:it:Poligono di Furbara|Furbara]] air base they underwent specialist military training, focusing on usage of [[machine gun]]s and [[grenades]], [[infantry]] tactics and urban warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzales Calleja 2011, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Back in Spain, del Burgo wrote tactical rulebook with instructions as to group alignment and positioning, fire drills, march and engagement distances etc., all calibrated for small groups and mostly urban combat.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzales Calleja 2011, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to [[lieutenant]], he broadened his training to the Carlist [[Non commissioned officer|NCOs]].&lt;ref&gt;3 times a week each session 8-10 hrs, Ugarte Tellería 1998, p. 270, Gonzales Calleja 2011, p. 263, Aróstegui, Calleja 1994, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Early 1936 Pamplona could already present one [[battalion]]; del Burgo was leading one of its 3 [[Company|companies]].&lt;ref&gt;dubbed "batallón sagrado" for its symbolical and prestigious standing, Ugarte Tellería 1998, pp. 262-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before and during the first day of the [[Spanish coup of July 1936|coup]] del Burgo was instrumental to organizing the Pamplona Requeté units.&lt;ref&gt;Ugarte Tellería 1998, p. 263, Peñas Bernaldo 1996, p. 174, Gonzales Calleja 2011, p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; The Pamplona tercio was fragmented, del Burgo’s company incorporated into a mixed 7th Batallón del Regimiento de América.&lt;ref&gt;a mixed unit composed of one company of soldiers, one company of falangists and two companies of requetés, Julio Aróstegui, ''Combatientes Requetés en la Guerra Civil española, 1936-1939'', Madrid 2013, {{ISBN|9788499709758}}, p. 351-2&lt;/ref&gt; He left Pamplona on July 19; following few days in [[La Rioja (Spain)|Rioja]], the battalion was moved to [[Navafria]] area in [[Sierra de Guadarrama]], in August engaged in heavy fighting for the [[Somosierra pass]].&lt;ref&gt;Aróstegui  2013, pp. 354-359; after the war the unit was referred to as Tercio del Rey, Aróstegui 2013, p. 352, Lizarza 2006, pp. 70-71&lt;/ref&gt; In September he was withdrawn to a hospital in the rear.&lt;ref&gt;he suffered appendicitis according to Aróstegui 2013, p. 359; a fellow requeté who carried del Burgo on the stretcher claims he was wounded, see Pablo Larraz Andía, Víctor Sierra-Sesumaga (eds.), ''Requetés. De las trincheras al olvidio'', Madrid 2011, {{ISBN|9788499700465}}, p. 829&lt;/ref&gt; Recovered, del Burgo co-organized the [[Álava|Álavese]]&lt;ref&gt;the ''Requeté.es'' site available [http://www.requetes.com/begonya.html here] claims the tercio was not Alavese but Biscay&lt;/ref&gt; battalion of Tercio de Nuestra Señora de Begoña&lt;ref&gt;Diario de Navarra 25.10.05, ''Requeté'' site available [http://www.requetes.com/begonya.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and as its officer re-entered combat in [[Biscay]].

==Between ''falcondismo'' and ''carloctavismo''==
[[File:Ideario by Jaime del Burgo.jpg|thumbnail|160px|left|''Ideario'' by del Burgo]]
During the [[:es:Decreto de Unificación|unification crisis]] of early 1937 del Burgo sided with the intransigent [[Manuel Fal Condé|falcondistas]],&lt;ref&gt;paradoxically, del Burgo unintentionally contributed to Fal’s exile. In August 1936, he suggested to Zamanillo that a Real Academia de Estudios Militares de la Comunión Tradicionalista is created, Jaime del Burgo Torres, ''Un episodio poco conocido de la guerra civil española. La Real Academia Militar de Requetés y el destierro de Fal Conde'', [in:] ''Principe de Viana'' 196 (1992), pp. 485-487, also Peñas Bernaldo 1996, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; considering amalgamation into [[Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS|FET]] a manipulation on part of the Navarrese.&lt;ref&gt;Peñas Bernaldo 1996, p. 276. Sending del Burgo to the front deprved Fal of an ally and facilitated Navarre falling to the rodeznistas, Peñas Bernaldo 1996, p. 218, Ugarte Tellería 1998, p. 293 pursues a somewhat competitive interpretation, namely that del Burgo’s departure to the front was intended as disposing of a dangerous radical, comparable to marginalization of the Rohm SA faction within Nazism&lt;/ref&gt; He labeled occasional enthusiasm for unification a "collective psychosis".&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 1975, p. 290; Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; To underline Traditionalist identity, he was commissioned to compile a concise doctrinal handbook, published in April 1937 as ''Ideario Tradicionalista''.&lt;ref&gt;commissioned by Junta Carlista de Guerra de Vizcaya according to Garralda Arizcun 2008; the actual text available [http://carlismo.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Ideario-CTC-1979.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars claim that the collaborationists intended to get rid of del Burgo, still active in national AET,&lt;ref&gt;in April of 1937 del Burgo engaged in AET congress, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; and send him abroad, as a Traditionalist tutor of [[Juan de Borbon|Don Juan]].&lt;ref&gt;Peñas Bernaldo 1996, p. 245, Iker Cantabrana Morras, ''Lo viejo y lo nuevo: Díputación-FET de las JONS.

Del Burgo’s departure from the falcondista camp stemmed not from differences on policy towards [[Francoism]], but was the result of dynastical disputes. Though in the mid-1930s he was fanatically loyal to the dynasty,&lt;ref&gt;Gonzales Calleja 2011, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; following the death of [[Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime|Don Alfonso Carlos]] del Burgo only hesitantly accepted the [[regency]] of [[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|Don Javier]];&lt;ref&gt;according to del Burgo, "la Regencia es la muerte de cualquier monarquía", César Alcalá, ''Valoración historica del carlismo: pasado y futuro'', [in:] ''Arbil'' 79, available [http://www.arbil.org/%2879%29alca.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; instead, he advanced the cause of [[Archduke Karl Pius of Austria, Prince of Tuscany|Don Carlo Pio]] as early as on the frontline in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;which, apparently, was quite popular in Tercio de Begoña, see [http://www.requetes.com/begonya.html here]; before the Civil War the group named cruzadistas have advanced the cause of Don Carlos Pio; their paper ''La Fe'' concluded on 19.7.36 that if Don Javier is to become a regent, the only option is to declare Don Carlos Pio the king,  César Alcalá, ''Cruzadistas y carloctavistas: historia de una conspiración'', Barcelona 2012, {{ISBN|9788493884253}}, pp. 192-194. Though he did remain technically loyal to the regent, in 1940 del Burgo again publicly called for declaring Carlos Pio the Carlist king,  Francisco de las Heras y Borrero, ''Un pretendiente desconocido. Carlos de Habsburgo. El otro candidato de Franco'', Madrid 2004, {{ISBN|8497725565}}, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; When the latter officially raised his claim as Carlos VIII in 1943, del Burgo joined his followers - dubbed carloctavistas - and constructed a supporting dynastical interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;his theory was that Carlos V established a new dynasty; according to this version Don Javier, as not his descendant, represented another, non-Carlist dynasty, Jeremy MacClancy, ''The Decline of Carlism'', Reno 2000, {{ISBN|9780874173444}}, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many Carlos VIII supporters he did not sympathize with the [[Axis powers|Axis]]&lt;ref&gt;Del Burgo blamed the [[Nazis]] for falangisation of Spain. His stance was also due to friendship with Jaime Lasuén, a French citizen and ex-combatant of Tercio de Begoña, who engaged in anti-Nazi French resistance. He sought refuge in Spain and was helped by del Burgo when on transit in Pamplona. He was later captured by the Francoist security in Madrid and given over to Gestapo; he died due to the tortures suffered. He handed del Burgo an envelope, to be collected by someone later on. Since no-one came to pick it up, del Burgo opened it years later and found that it contained an organigram of Nazi espionage network in the North of Spain; Martorell Pérez 2009, pp. 273-4; see also [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJoNLMBdNRQ here], and for an alternative view, see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TCN56ZUSD0 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and did not enter the first carloctavista executive of 1943.&lt;ref&gt;the provinvial carloctavista jefe in Navarra was initially Emilio Dean Berro, see Alcalá 2012, pp. 249-50, to be later replaced by Antonio Lizarza, Alcalá 2012, pp. 273-4, 311&lt;/ref&gt; It was only in 1945 that del Burgo became one of the [[Comunión Católico-Monárquica (carloctavista party)|Comunión Católico-Monárquica]] leaders&lt;ref&gt;theoretically supporting prospective Carlist candidates did not breach the loyalty to Don Javier as a regent; according to some scholars del Burgo was clearly disloyal, see Mercedes Vázquez de Prada Tiffe, ''La reorganización del carlismo vasco en los sesenta: entre la pasividad y el "separatismo"'', [in:] ''Vasconia. Cuadernos de Historia-Geografía'', 38 (2012), p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; and vice-president of the claimant’s Navarrese Royal Council.&lt;ref&gt;Real Consejo del Reino de Navarra was presided by Emilio Dean Barro, Alcalá 2012, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; Don Carlos Pio was only 3 years del Burgo’s senior and equally radical; the two have forged a close relationship and exchanged a lengthy correspondence over the years.&lt;ref&gt;from 1944 to 1953, see [http://dadun.unav.edu/bitstream/10171/34177/1/167%20INVENTARIO.pdf here], samples re-printed in Heras y Borrero 2004, pp. 209-225&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1940s Del Burgo’s worked to capture new supporters&lt;ref&gt;like Antonio Lizarza, Antonio Pagoaga, Antonio Cabañas, Francisco Ciganda, Alcalá 2012, pp. 298-304; in 1946 he  was in daily touch with [[Jesús Cora y Lira|Cora y Lira]], Alcalá 2012, p. 303, see also Heras y Borrero 2004, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1950 he managed to reconstruct Navarrese AET as a carloctavista organization.&lt;ref&gt;Alcalá 2012, p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; However, at that time he was replaced as a key claimant's  man in the province by [[:es:Antonio Lizarza|Antonio Lizarza]].&lt;ref&gt;Alcalá 2012, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;

The unexpected 1953 death of Don Carlos Pio left the carloctavistas puzzled. While most of the group focused on Carlos VIII's older brother [[Archduke Anton of Austria|Don Antonio]] and minor factions backed either his sons or another brother [[Archduke Franz Josef of Austria, Prince of Tuscany|Francisco Jose]], del Burgo advocated allegiance to the oldest daughter of Carlos VIII, Alejandra. According to del Burgo, having been a minor she would appear as "abanderada provisional", until the claim is passed to her anticipated male descendant.&lt;ref&gt;Heras y Borrero 2004, pp. 143-144&lt;/ref&gt; This option received scarce support and no faction was built around it.&lt;ref&gt;Heras y Borrero 2004, pp. 140-166. Alejandra married in 1960, graduated in 1980 with work on Barcelona urban issues, see [http://www.raco.cat/index.php/RevistaGeografia/article/viewFile/46059/56864 here] and worked in the Barcelona city council. She became a socialist and lost any interest in the Carlist cause, ignored also by her two sons and a daughter, Heras y Borrero 2004, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; Del Burgo was left without clear dynastical allegiances; over time he developed a critical view of Carlos VIII, considering him "sold out" to Falange.&lt;ref&gt;quoted after Josep Carles Clemente, ''Raros, heterodoxos, disidentes y viñetas del Carlismo'', Madrid 1995, {{ISBN|842450707X}}, 978842450707, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; He is not listed among the carloctavistas forming the camp of subsequent carloctavista claimants,&lt;ref&gt;Alcalá 2012, pp. 354-363&lt;/ref&gt; those reconciling with Don Javier,&lt;ref&gt;Alcalá 2012, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt; or those joining Don Juan.&lt;ref&gt;Alcalá 2012, p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; though in the 1960s it was noted that he "había mostrado inclinación hacia los javieristas"&lt;ref&gt;Mercedes Vázquez de Prada, ''El final de una ilusión. Auge y declive del tradicionalismo carlista (1957-1967)'', Madrid 2016, {{ISBN|9788416558407}}, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

==Between ''franquismo'' and ''carlismo''==
[[File:Francisco Franco 1959 (cropped).jpg|thumbnail|160px|left|[[Francisco Franco]]]]
Del Burgo’s access to the carloctavista camp made him reconsider his stand versus Francoism, as Don Carlos Pio pursued a decisively collaborationist strategy.&lt;ref&gt;by some scholars Carlos VIII is indeed considered an invention of Franco, see Clemente 1995, pp. 115-118&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, during the proceeding fragmentation and bewilderment of Navarrese Carlism,&lt;ref&gt;Aurora Villanueva Martínez, ''Organizacion, actividad y bases del carlismo navarro durante el primer franquismo'' [in:] ''Geronimo de Uztariz'' 19 (2003), pp. 108-109&lt;/ref&gt; he stood on the carloctavista ticket in local elections to the Pamplona council and was successful, serving as [[:es:Teniente de alcalde|teniende de alcalde]] until 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Garralda Arizcun 2008; at that time the alcalde was a Carlist, Antonio Archanco Zubiri, "comerciante local con la tendencia colaboracionista", María del Mar Larraza-Micheltorena, ''Alcaldes de Pamplona durante el franquismo: Un retrato de conjunto'', [in:] ''Memoria y Civilización'' 15 (2012), pp. 232, 235&lt;/ref&gt; By this token, in 1943 and 1944 he performed the prestigious sanfermines task of setting off [[:es:Sanfermines#El chupinazo|el chupinazo]].&lt;ref&gt;see ''sanfermin.com'' site available [http://www.sanfermin.com/index.php/es/la-fiesta/txupinazo/lanzadores-del-txupinazo here]&lt;/ref&gt; The council role did necessarily imply collaboration, but promotion to [[colonel]], 1943 appointment as a provincial Falangist delegate for communication and transport and vice secretary of FET Educación Popular section&lt;ref&gt;Aurora Villanueva Martínez, ''El Carlismo navarro durante el primer franquismo: 1937-1951'', Madrid 1998, {{ISBN|9788487863714}}, p. 548&lt;/ref&gt; clearly did, especially that in the mid-1940s he openly started to advocate a possibilist policy.&lt;ref&gt;Recommending "beneficio de la impresa comun de salvar a España a las órdenes del Generalísmo Franco", see his letter of 1945 quoted by Alcalá 2012, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;  As in 1949 the Falangist zealot [[Luis Valero Bermejo]] was appointed a new provincial civil governor&lt;ref&gt;Maria del Mar Larazza Micheltorena, Alvaro Baraibar Etxeberria, ''La Navarra sotto il Franchismo: la lotta per il controllo provinciale tra i governatori civili e la Diputacion Foral (1945-1955)'', [in:] ''Nazioni e Regioni'', Bari 2013, pp. 101-120&lt;/ref&gt; del Burgo was his man of trust,&lt;ref&gt;Alvaro Baraibar Etxeberria, ''Una visión falangista de la foralidad navarra'', [in:] ''Gerónimo de Uztariz'' 2006, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; though when himself offered the jobs of civil governor of [[Lerida]] and [[Lugo]] he declined, claiming that he would never accept a post beyond Navarre.&lt;ref&gt;''Diario de Navarra'' 25.10.05, Garralda Arizcun 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 he assumed the role of a provincial ministerial delegate for tourism and information. When the carloctavista collaborationism crashed with the death of Don Carlos Pio,&lt;ref&gt;some scholars claim that carloctavismo was fractured even earlier, with the 1950 appearance of Juntas Ofensivas de Agitación Carloctavista by Cora y Lira, the carloctavistas which opposed collaboration with Franco, Alcalá 2012, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; del Burgo was left disoriented.

In the mid-1950s it was the mainstream Carlism which in turn commenced a possibilist strategy, with intransigence abandoned and Fal replaced by [[José María Valiente Soriano|Valiente]]. None of the sources consulted offers any information on a would-be rapprochement (or hostility) between del Burgo and the [[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|Javieristas]], though his ''Ideario'' still served as their doctrinal point of reference.&lt;ref&gt;for 1949 see Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 331, for 1964 see Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, ''El naufragio de las ortodoxias: el carlismo, 1962-1977'', Pamplona 1997, {{ISBN|8431315644}}, 9788431315641, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 he was appointed as representative of Navarre in the Falangist [[:es:Consejo Nacional del Movimiento|Consejo Nacional]], a largely fictitious executive body which nevertheless automatically guaranteed membership in the Francoist quasi-parliament, [[Cortes Españolas]];&lt;ref&gt;see ''Indice Historice de Diputados'' service, available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/SDocum/ArchCon/SDHistoDipu/SDIndHistDip?_piref73_1340024_73_1340023_1340023.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXD1S.fmt&amp;DOCS=1-1&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;NUM1=&amp;DES1=&amp;QUERY=%2817580%29.NDIP here].

[[File:Charles-Hugues de Bourbon-Parme.jpg|thumbnail|160px|[[Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma|Don Carlos Hugo]]]]
As a former radical aetista and an active collaborationist, he would have seemed a potential ally for the new generation of Carlist progressists, also revolutionary, socially-minded, AET members and apparently keen to exploit possibilist opportunities within Francoism. However, they preferred to jump on the older version of [[Juan Vázquez de Mella|de Mella’s]] sociedalismo and there is no trace of any link between del Burgo and the [[Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma|hugocarlistas]].&lt;ref&gt;compare Martorell Pérez 2009&lt;/ref&gt; One source suggests that as Delegado del Ministerio de Información y Turismo he sabotaged their plans, preventing the presence of [[Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma|Carlos Hugo]] at the annual [[Montejurra]] gathering in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 306; this version is not confirmed in Javier Lavardín [José Antonio Parilla], ''Historia del ultimo pretendiente a la corona de España'', Paris 1976, pp. 231-234&lt;/ref&gt; Del Burgo is not mentioned as taking part in power struggle between Traditionalists and Progressists, which erupted within Carlism in the late 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;the most competent study on the issue, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, barely mentions del Burgo; another detailed study on Carlist ideological identity of the 1960s, Martorell Pérez 2009, refers to del Burgo only as a source&lt;/ref&gt; though he maintained at least private contacts with Traditionalists like Manuel Fal Conde in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;"Lo único que he hecho en mi vida -y voy en los 56- ha sido trabajar para crear una familia a imagen y semejanza de la de mis mayores, y perpetuar en mis hijos -con éxito- las ideas y actitudes que en nosotros son ya tradicionales", a letter from del Burgo to Fal, quoted after Gemma Pierola Narvarte, Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, ''Entre la ideología y lo cotidiano: la familia en el carlismo y el tradicionalismo (1940-1975)'', [in:] ''Vasconia: cuadernos de historia-geografía'' 28 (1999), p. 52;  Fal also appreciated del Burgo, see Manuel Martorell Pérez, ''Navarra 1937-1939: el fiasco de la Unificación'', [in:] ''Príncipe de Viana'' 69 (2008), p. 439. In the early 1970s a "Jaime del Burgo" considered launching a post-Carlist regionalist political grouping, though it is unclear whether the person in question is the father or the son, see José Miguel Orts Timoner, ''Recuerdo de José Ángel Zubaiur Alegre'', [in:] ''Portal Avant!'' 20.04.12, available [http://www.carlistes.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=321:2012recuerdozubiaur&amp;catid=25:opinionpolitica&amp;Itemid=56 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public servant==
[[File:La Agrícola.JPG|thumbnail|left|[[:es:Biblioteca General de Navarra|Biblioteca General]] site 1972-2010]]
Already in May 1936 del Burgo won the contest for the job of an auxiliar at [[Archivo de la Diputación Foral de Navarra]].&lt;ref&gt;''Diario de Navarra'' 25.10.05, Garralda Arizcun 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Civil War pause, in 1939 he resumed the civil servant career; at that time the provincial Navarrese government decided to detach the existing [[Biblioteca de Navarra]] from [[Instituto de Segunda Enseñanza]] and establish it as a stand-alone [[:es:Biblioteca General de Navarra|Biblioteca General de Navarra]]; del Burgo became the first head and organizer of the new unit.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 25.10.05, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/2005/10/25/044.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; He remained at its helm for the next 43 years,&lt;ref&gt;Garralda Arizcun 2008&lt;/ref&gt; presiding over its opening in 1941, removal from [[:es:Biblioteca General de Navarra|Consejo Foral]] building to "La Agrícola" on Plaza de San Fernando in 1972&lt;ref&gt;see Biblioteca y Filmoteca de Navarra leaflet, available [http://www.navarra.es/NR/rdonlyres/AF46F2DC-F676-47C9-B583-C3C74B0AD76E/177823/BibliotecaNavarra.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; and re-formatting it from a scholarly institute to the Navarrese public library.&lt;ref&gt;removal to the new modern site at Paseo de Antonio Pérez Goyena took place in 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On top of this job, in 1941 del Burgo became head of [[Red de Bibliotecas de Navarra]],&lt;ref&gt;see ''Institucion Principe de Viana'' entry at ''Gran Enciclopedia Navarra'', available [http://www.enciclopedianavarra.com/navarra/institucion-principe-de-viana/9508/2/ here]; the job coincided with 1943 appointment to vicesecretario de Educación Popular de FET, Villanueva Martínez 1998, p. 548&lt;/ref&gt; the provincial network of local libraries, in course of his service having opened 65 public libraries across the province.&lt;ref&gt;''Diario de Navarra'' 25.10.05&lt;/ref&gt; Until the late 20th century he remained active in professional archivist and librarian organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Garralda Arizcun 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historian==
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumbnail|left|Carlist standard]]
As a historian del Burgo focused on – if not limited himself to – Carlism and Navarre, with a clear preference for the 19th and 20th centuries and for the history of [[Fuero|foralism]]. His works range from syntheses to monographs, biographies and case studies. As an amateur with no systematic training, he did not adhere to any specific methodology,&lt;ref&gt;Garralda Arizcun 2008&lt;/ref&gt; though he remained chiefly within the limits of political history and based his studies on thorough research in primary sources, mostly the printed ones.

Del Burgo’s key historical work is the monumental ''Bibliografía de las guerras carlistas'' (1953-1966), the opus which spanned across 5 volumes, cost 25 years of work&lt;ref&gt;it was this work which earned del Burgo the national literary prize in 1967, Garralda Arizcun 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and indexed more that 10,000 works; until today it remains a point of reference for all students of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. José María Sanchez Nistal, ''Problemas y soluciones para la busqueda de información bibliografica en la investigación historica'', [in:] ''Probemas actuales de la historia'', Salamanca 1993, {{ISBN|847481734X}}, 9788474817348, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Second to be listed is ''Historia General de Navarra'' (1978), a massive synthesis of the region’s past, heavily based on his earlier works and the result of 10-year-research.&lt;ref&gt;Garralda Arizcun 2008; later Jaime Ignacio del Burgo Tajadura re-worked the volume and re-issued as a joint work, see ''Vanity Fair'' review available [http://www.revistavanityfair.es/articulos/historia-de-navarra-el-libro-de-jaime-ignacio-del-burgo/17081 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Then come detailed studies related to the history of Carlism and Navarre, most prominent of them ''Carlos VII y su tiempo'' (1994) and ''La sucesión de Carlos II'' (1967). Del Burgo is also the author of ''Conspiración y guerra civil'' (1970), the work intended as a synthesis, though today it is – somewhat unintentionally – broadly used rather as a historical source.&lt;ref&gt;compare numerous references in Martorell Pérez 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, he authored a number of minor publications ranging from petty contributions to popular booklets,&lt;ref&gt;Garralda Arizcun 2008&lt;/ref&gt; like ''Vida y hechos militares del mariscal de campo Don Juan Manuel Sarasa narrados por él mismo''.&lt;ref&gt;co-authored with Juan Manuel Sarasa&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his works form part of auxiliary sciences, bibliography or [[metabibliography]], [[source criticism]], or [[prosopography]].&lt;ref&gt;Garralda Arizcun 2008, selected bibliography in Ainhoa Arozamena Ayala, Cristina Aznar Munárri, ''Jaime del Burgo Torres'' entry, [in:] ''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia'', available [http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/34128 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a historian del Burgo is praised for sound referential basis;&lt;ref&gt;Garralda Arizcun 2008&lt;/ref&gt; the critics usually point to his Carlist bias.&lt;ref&gt;José Luís Martínez Sanz, ''Historians and Historiography on carlismo: the difficult boundary between politics and science'', [in:] ''Contributions'' 49 (2002), p. 115; he is also denounced for pursuing an utopian vision of a Navarrese-Carlist unity, as according to him, the Carlist wars "configuraron de manera permanente el caracter de esta region, asignandole el papel de defensora de las mas puras esencias hispanicas", quoted after Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, ''Navarra y el carlismo durante el régimen de Franco: la utopía de la identidad unitaria'', [in:] ''Investigaciones históricas'' 17 (1997), p. 287-8&lt;/ref&gt; He is particularly criticized for an attempt to recalculate the number of victims of the [[White Terror (Spain)|Rightist terror]] in Navarre; other historians support 4 times higher figures.&lt;ref&gt;Del Burgo arrived at a total of ca 680 victims, while the figure advanced by many others is in the range of 2,000-3,000, compare José María Jimeno Jurío, ''La Gierra Civil en Navarra (1936-1939)'', Pamplona 2006, {{ISBN|9788476814826}}, [[Ramón Salas Larrazábal]], ''Los Fusilados en Navarra en la Guerra de 1936'', Madrid 1983, {{ISBN|843980024X}}, Mari Jose Berrio Zaratiegui, Juan Carlos Esparza Zabalegi, José Mari Ruiz Vilas, ''Navarra 1936 - de la Esperanza al terror'', Altafulla 2003, {{ISBN|9788493095796}}&lt;/ref&gt; This controversy coincides with the fact that del Burgo was personally accused of a war crime,&lt;ref&gt;see the account of Francisco Inza Goñi in ''Navarra 1936 - de la Esperanza al terror'', p. 483, widely quoted in cyberspace, compare [http://old.kaosenlared.net/noticia/requetes-tradicion-sanguinaria here]&lt;/ref&gt; the charge that left him very embittered&lt;ref&gt;according to del Burgo’s own account the case was exactly the opposite: he did his best to prevent war crimes, e.g. saving republican POWs from execution by incorporating them into requeté units, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; and which he always denied;&lt;ref&gt;"Del Burgo, mientras vivió, dijo una y otra vez a quien le quiso oir que no había matado a nadie fuera del campo de batalla y mucho menos en Pamplona" quoted after ''kaosenlared.net'' available [http://old.kaosenlared.net/noticia/requete-sinecdoque-edgar-gonzalez here]&lt;/ref&gt; it is also disqualified by some historians.&lt;ref&gt;moreover, some claim he saved lives of Leftist activists like Telesforo Monzon or Juan Arrastia, see EKA site available [https://web.archive.org/web/20060902172409/http://www.eka-partidocarlista.com/delburgo.htm here], Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; As an amateur he has never assumed academic duties,&lt;ref&gt;Ainhoa Arozamena Ayala, Cristina Aznar Munárri, ''Jaime del Burgo Torres'' entry, [in:] ''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia'' refer to him as "profesor mercantil", though no trace of his academic or otherwise teaching activity is found elsewhere&lt;/ref&gt; though he became member-correspondent of [[:es:Real Academia de la Historia|Real Academia de la Historia]];&lt;ref&gt;''Diario de Navarra'' 25.10.05, Garralda Arizcun 2008&lt;/ref&gt; for his bibliographical work del Burgo received the [[National Literary Prize (Francoist Spain)|National Literary Prize]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 25.10.05, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/2005/10/25/044.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Del Burgo commenced his literary career in the early 1930s, publishing short [[drama]]s revolving around episodes from the Carlist history and sometimes played at the local party circulos: ''Lealtad'' (1932), ''Cruzados'' (1934) and ''Al borde de la traición'' (1936).&lt;ref&gt;Ainhoa Arozamena Ayala, Cristina Aznar Munárri, ''Jaime del Burgo Torres'' entry, [in:] ''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; Calibrated as praises of old Carlist virtues and with clear moralizing objectives,&lt;ref&gt;Ainhoa Arozamena Ayala, Cristina Aznar Munárri, ''Jaime del Burgo Torres'' entry, [in:] ''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia'', Ugarte Tellería 1998, p. 278, Blinkhorn 1975, p. 211; according to Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, ''"Esa ciudad maldita, cuna del centralismo, la burocracia y el liberalismo": la ciudad como enemigo en el tradicionalismo español'', [in:] ''Actas del congreso internacional "Arquitectura, ciudad e ideología antiurbana'', Pamplona 2002, {{ISBN|8489713510}}, p. 92, del Burgo’s dramas were "ejemplos de teatro carlista tradicionalista"&lt;/ref&gt; they are classified as costumbrismo nostalgico.&lt;ref&gt;"todos ellos coinciden en reflejar en sus obras cómo la perniciosa influencia de lo foráneo va pervirtiendo las sanas y católicas costumbres locales de la Navarra ‘auténtica’", Javier Dronda Martínez, ''Con Cristo o contra Cristo. Religión y movilización antirrepublicana en navarra (1931-1936)'', Tafalla 2013, {{ISBN|8415313314}}, 9788415313311, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 he tried his hand as a poet with ''En Pos. Ensayo poético''.&lt;ref&gt;Ainhoa Arozamena Ayala, Cristina Aznar Munárri, ''Jaime del Burgo Torres'' entry, [in:] ''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia'' claim it was published 1927, which is probably a typo and should read 1937, see Jaime del Burgo, ''Catalogo bio-bibliografico'', Pamplona 1954, p. 275, available [http://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/2253350.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Civil War break del Burgo switched to [[novel]]s: ''El valle perdido'' (1942), ''Huracán'' (1943) and ''Lo que buscamos'' (1951).&lt;ref&gt;Ainhoa Arozamena Ayala, Cristina Aznar Munárri, ''Jaime del Burgo Torres'' entry, [in:] ''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; Set in the history of the Civil War, the first two were designed to acclaim patriotic merits and presented a traditional narrative style, though with plots accommodating magical threads;&lt;ref&gt;''El valle perdido'' plot features two Navarrese nationalist pilots who crash-landed somewhere in the Pyrenees, finding themselves in a valley cut off from the outer world and inhabited by descendants of those fighting in the 19th-century Carlist wars&lt;/ref&gt; the third one assumed a different tone, infected with bitterness and naturalism.&lt;ref&gt;Piotr Sawicki, ''La narrativa española de la Guerra Civil (1936-1975). Propaganda, testimonio y memoria creativa'', Alicante 2010, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; After the break of the 1960s and 1970s, dedicated mostly to historical research, del Burgo returned to drama with ''Llamada sin respuesta'' (1978), to poetry with ''Soliloquios: en busca de un rayo de luz perdido'' (1998)&lt;ref&gt;Ainhoa Arozamena Ayala, Cristina Aznar Munárri, ''Jaime del Burgo Torres'' entry, [in:] ''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia''; the sub-title is a commentary to del Burgo losing his eyesight in the last years of his life, Garralda Arizcun 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and to prose with ''La Cruz del fuego'' (2000), a well-documented adventurous intrigue from the times of [[Henry I of Navarre]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Mata-Indurain 2002, p. 935&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Though hevaily contributing to [[Carlism in literature]], Del Burgo has not made it to the history of Spanish belles-lettres of the 20th century, be it either general synthetic accounts&lt;ref&gt;Del Burgo is entirely missing in synthesis of Spanish literature like Santos Sanz Villanueva, ''Historia y crítica de la literatura española'', vol. 8/1 (''Epoca contemporanea 1939-1975''), Barcelona 1999, {{ISBN|8474237815}}, Domingo Yndurain, ''Historia y critica de la literatura española 1939-1980'', vol. 8 (''Epoca contemporanea 1939-1980''), Barcelona 1981, Jordi Gracia, Domingo Ródenas, ''Derrota y restitución de la modernidad: literatura contemporánea, 1939-2009'', Madrid 2009, {{ISBN|9788498921229}}, [[Jean Canavaggio]], ''Historia de la literatura española'', vol. 6 (''El siglo XX''), Barcelona 1995, {{ISBN|843447459X}}&lt;/ref&gt; or encyclopedias and dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;compare Jesus Bregante, ''Diccionario espasa. Literatura española'', Madrid 2003, {{ISBN|8467012722}}, Ricardo Gullon (ed.), ''Diccionario de Literatura Española y Hispanoamericana'', vol. 1, Madrid 1993, {{ISBN|8420652482}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is missing even in detailed studies on the Francoist era novels.&lt;ref&gt;Santos Sanz Villanueva, ''La novela española durante el franquismo'', Madrid 2010, {{ISBN|9788424904180}}, Ignacio Soldevila Durante, ''Historia de la novela española 1936-2000'', Madrid 2001, {{ISBN|8437619114}}&lt;/ref&gt; His prose is classified as falling into the "novela de la guerra civil española" category. Appreciated for documentary value, del Burgo’s novels are described as production of scarce esthetic and literary value, very repetitive in terms of its structures, primitive in terms of narration and [[Manichaean]] in terms of personalities.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Mata, ''La aportación de Navarra a la literatura española'', [in:] Jaime Ignacio del Burgo (ed.), ''Vascos y Navarros en la Historia de Espana'', Pamplona 2007, {{ISBN|9788495643025}}, p. 366&lt;/ref&gt; Present-day scholars point to two interesting features of his novels. One is a strong [[Basque people|Basque]] ethnic sentiment, calibrated in pre-nationalist, [[Sabino Arana|sabinan]] terms of an ancient Basque Eden.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Javier Caspistegui, ''Historia oral, inmaterial e intrahistoria en la recuperación de la memoria colectiva de la Navarra rural'', [in:] ''Gerónimo de Uztariz'' 23-24 (2008), p. 211; Basque threads were present though not key in many of his works; in fact, he insisted on different ethnic origins of alaveses, vizcainos, guipuzcoanos and navarros, see Iñaki Iriarte López, ''Euskaros, nacionalistas y navarristas. Ideologías del pacto y la agonía en Navarra'', [in:] ''Revista Internacional de los Estudios Vascos'' 44 (1999), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Another is equally idyllic rustic thread, advancing a fairly typical Carlist praise of ruralismo and mistrust towards urban life.&lt;ref&gt;Caspistegui Gorasurreta 2002, pp. 80-81&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Insignia of the Commander Grades of the Civil Order of Alfonso X, the Wise.svg|thumbnail|180px|[[Order of Alfonso X the Wise]]]]
Del Burgo’s novelist work was acknowledged by [[Premio de Literatura y Periodismo de la Secretaria General de FET]] (1954).&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 23.12.54, available [http://hemeroteca.abcdesevilla.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1954/12/23/009.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the national prize of 1967, he was also rewarded by the [[Bayonne-Pamplona International Competition Award]] (1963),&lt;ref&gt;Garralda Arizcun 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fundacion de Larramendi Award]] (1993)&lt;ref&gt;see Fundación Ignacio Larramendi site, available [http://www.larramendi.es/i18n/consulta/resultados_navegacion.cmd?busq_autoridadesbib=FILA20090027916 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Badge of the Order of Alfonso X the Wise]] (1997), conceded by the Ministry of Education and received in Pamplona in May 1999 from the then Minister of Education and Culture, [[Mariano Rajoy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Diario de Navarra'' 25.10.05&lt;/ref&gt; Permanent Councilor of [[Institución Príncipe de Viana]],&lt;ref&gt;''El Mundo'' 26.10.05, available [http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/10/24/obituarios/1130148092.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; himself he has never received the [[:es:Premios Internacionales de Navarra Príncipe de Viana|Viana Cultural Prize]], set up in 1990 and awarded by the [[:es:Gobierno de Navarra|Government of Navarre]].&lt;ref&gt;though was nominated in 2001, ''Diario de Navarra'' 25.10.05&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Nicholas I of Montenegro|King Nikola's]] Palace''' is located in [[Cetinje]], [[Montenegro]], and for more than 50&amp;nbsp;years  served as the seat of the Montenegrin Royal family. In 1926 it became a museum, from 1980 it was one of the departments of [[National Museum of Montenegro]].

The small palace was built from 1863 to 1867 in a simple style typical of Cetinje houses with certain elements of [[neoclassicism]]. The interiors were designed in style of [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]] and [[Art Nouveau]]. 

In the entrance hall are exposed the [[Montenegrin crown jewels]], which are the most popular exhibition of the National museum.

'''The Royal Garden''' was built in 1870 as a pine alley. Gardens were refurbished in 1971. There are many flower beds with crocuses, geraniums, tulips and rose and jasmine bushes.

In the back of garden there is cedar grove with domimant villa with small summer-house, which served fas a guest house for foreign visitors.

A monarch is the person who heads a [[monarchy]], usually reigning for life, or until [[abdication]] or [[Deposition (politics)|deposition]]. The reign of some monarchs has been notably short. Many of these monarchs acceded to the throne as a result of being first in an order of succession, while other monarchs claimed the throne as a result of some conflict.

The authenticity of some monarchs has been disputed, especially those who reigned during conflict. One factor in such debates is whether the monarch held the throne in a symbolic or nominal capacity. Two examples are

*King [[Louis-Antoine, Duke of Angouleme|Louis XIX]] of France, who succeeded upon the abdication of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] only to abdicate in favour of [[Henri, comte de Chambord|Henry V]] instead of assuming the throne, and
*Emperor [[Michael II of Russia]], who succeeded on the abdication of [[Nicholas II]] only to abdicate himself in favor of nobody.

| Succeeded with the abdication of his father, [[Charles X of France|Charles X]], only to himself abdicate in favour of his nephew, [[Henri, Count of Chambord|Henry V]] (above). The question of whether Louis actually "reigned" is a philosophical one, as after his father signed the document of abdication, he contemplated his future for twenty minutes before himself signing. Many [[Legitimists]] did not recognise the abdications as valid, and recognised Charles X as king until his death in 1836, before recognising Louis as king until his own death in 1844.

'''''Loving Pablo, Hating Escobar''''' is the translation of the title "''Amando a Pablo, odiando a Escobar''", a memoir of the Colombian author and journalist [[Virginia Vallejo]]. It was originally written in Spanish and was published by [[Random House|Random House Mondadori]] on 22 September 2007, and [[Random House|Random House Inc.]] of New York on 4 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/182336/loving-pablo-loving-pablo-hating-escobar-mti-by-virginia-vallejo/9780525433385/ |title=Loving Pablo, Hating Escobar.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The book describes the five years-long (1982-1987) romantic relationship of the author with [[Pablo Escobar]], head of the [[Medellin Cartel|Medellin cartel]], and it became instantly the #1 bestseller in [[Colombia]], [[Latin America]], and the Hispanic market in the [[United States]]. It has been translated to sixteen languages, and inspired the movie ''[[Loving Pablo]]'' (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lovingpablo.com/ |title=Loving Pablo, official website |access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Young |first=Deborah |date=5 September 2017 |title=Loving Pablo: Film Review.

Vallejo’s memoir is also her personal intimate biography of [[Pablo Escobar]]; a moving and terrible love story with many facets, but also a historical document about Colombian tragedies and political corruption in the second part of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allenandunwin.com/browse/books/general-books/biography-autobiography/Loving-Pablo-Hating-Escobar-Virginia-Vallejo-translated-by-Megan-McDowell-9781786891051 |title=Biography and autobiographical book|access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The book is divided in an introduction and three parts: The Days of Innocence and Dreams; The Days of Splendor and Terror; and The Days of Absence and Silence.

In the Introduction, Virginia Vallejo describes her departure from Colombia on 18 July 2006 in a special flight of the US [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), after she has accused a former senator and minister of justice, [[Alberto Santofimio]], of instigating the assassination of a former presidential candidate, [[Luis Carlos Galan]], and after she had offered her cooperation to the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in ongoing high-profile criminal cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Goodman |first=Joshua |date=19 July 2006 |title=Pablo Escobar's Ex-Lover Flees Colombia |url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Jul18/0,4670,ColombiaEscobarapossLover,00.html |work=Fox News |location= |access-date=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Muse |first=To |date=1 October 2006 |title=Drug lord's lover enthralls Colombia socialite makes allegations against elite |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2006/10/01/drug-lords-lover-enthralls-colombia-span-classbankheadsocialite-makes-allegations-against-elite-span/052150f2-332b-4464-935e-a287670e72ba/ |work=The Washington Post |location=Bogotá |access-date=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story begins with the joy and passion of two new lovers -Pablo, an ambitious rookie politician from humble origins, and Virginia, a socialite and media personality, both 32 years old- and continues with the evolution of their relationship and Escobar’s personality during his war against the extradition treaty between Colombia and the United States, and the terrorist activities of him and the [[Medellin Cartel|Medellin cartel]] in their last years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sptPGJv0a94&amp;t=15s |title="Cómo conocí a Pablo Escobar" |date=30 September 2007 |access-date=3 October 2017 |language=Spanish |trans-title="How to met Pablo Escobar"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like a snowball, Vallejo describes the birth and boom of the cocaine industry that turned her lover into a billionaire, thanks to the cooperation of leading politicians; the origins of the Colombian rebel organizations, and the paramilitary squads founded by Escobar and his partners; the assassinations of the justice minister [[Rodrigo Lara Bonilla|Rodrigo Lara]] in 1984, and the [[Palace of Justice siege|siege of the Palace of Justice]] in 1985; the suffering of the journalist after she had ended her relationship with the drug kingpin in 1987, and her cooperation with the anti drug German agency [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|BKA]] in 1988; the Cuban connection, and the bombing of an airplane with 110 people on board in 1989 ([[Avianca Flight 203]]); the assassination of [[Luis Carlos Galán]], and three more presidential candidates; the origins of Escobar’s war against the [[Cali Cartel|Cali cartel]] and the Colombian state, followed by the era of [[Narcoterrorism|narcoterrorism]] from 1988 to 1993; the coalition of enforcement agencies and Escobar’s enemies involved in his hunt; and, finally, the worldwide reaction to the death of the Number One Enemy of the United States on 2 December 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/highschool/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780525433385 |title=About the book: Loving Pablo |access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The release of the book created a political scandal in Latin America and the Hispanic television channels in the USA, due to Vallejo’s description of the relationship of Pablo Escobar and the [[Medellín Cartel|Medellin]] and [[Cali Cartel|Cali cartels]] with several presidents - like [[Alvaro Uribe Velez|Alvaro Uribe]], [[Alfonso López Michelsen|Alfonso López]] and [[Ernesto Samper Pizano|Ernesto Samper]] - and Colombian enforcement agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Colombian general jailed for 30 years over Galan death |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-38101907 |work=BBC |location= |date=25 November 2016 |access-date=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Romero |first=Simon |date=2 October 2007 |title=Colombian Leader Disputes Claim of Tie to Cocaine Kingpin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/03/world/americas/03colombia.html?mcubz=1 |work=The New York Times |location=Bogotá |access-date=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to Vallejo’s revelations, the Colombian government reopened the so-called "cases of the century": the [[Palace of Justice siege|siege of the Palace of Justice]], followed by a massacre of more than 100 people, including eleven Supreme Court Justices, committed by the army; and the assassination of [[Luis Carlos Galán|Luis Carlos Galan]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=18 August 2008 |title=Virginia Vallejo es nueva testigo en holocausto del palacio |trans-title=Virginia Vallejo is new witness in palace holocaust |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyFzBpA3dXU |language=Spanish |work=Noticias Uno |location=Bogotá |access-date=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7362">'''Lucjan Dobroszycki''' (1925 – October 24, 1995 in [[New York City]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] scientist and historian specializing in modern Polish and [[History of Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish history]]. A survivor of the [[Łódź Ghetto]] and [[Nazi concentration camps]] including [[Auschwitz]], Dobroszycki lived in Poland after [[World War II]] where he obtained his education and worked as a historian. His main focus was the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|Nazi German occupation of Poland]].

Dobroszycki undertook studies of the – legal and illegal – Polish press from during [[World War II|the war]], edited an abridged version of the chronicle of the [[Łódź Ghetto]] (Litzmannstadt Ghetto), and conducted research on the extermination of Polish Jewry. He was a visiting scholar in [[Jerusalem]] in June 1967 and emigrated to the United States in 1970. He and his family settled in New York City where, for the remainder of his life he was a member of the research staff of the [[YIVO]] Institute for Jewish Research.  He was also affiliated with [[Yeshiva University]]'s [[Holocaust]] studies program.

According to Zachary Baker from Stanford, Dobroszycki became YIVO's "'research consultant to the stars'; he compiled a history of former New York mayor Ed Koch's ancestors and was a consultant to [[Barbra Streisand]]'s film production of "[[Yentl]]" (an indirect [[Yiddish]] connection). His name has appeared in numerous published acknowledgments and documentary film credits."&lt;ref name="IB"&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:jXtD-m8C-f4J:www.ibiblio.net/pub/academic/languages/yiddish/mendele/vol5.151+Lucjan+Dobroszycki&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3&amp;gl=ca  Lucjan Dobroszycki at www.ibiblio.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Chronicle of the Lodz Ghetto''==
One of Dobroszycki's crowning achievements as a historian was the publication of the collected accounts of Jewish life under the [[Nazi]] occupation of [[Łódź]], a day-by-day record of life in [[Łódź Ghetto|the second-largest Jewish ghetto in Nazi Europe]]. Only two of five projected volumes were published before Dr. Dobroszycki moved to New York in 1970. The first English translation of "The Chronicle of the Lodz Ghetto" was published by Yale University Press in 1984. In his review, Stefan Kanfer of Time.com reflected on the collected accounts:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Within the barbed-wire boundaries a microcosm arose... Children were born, stores were opened, a road constructed, hospitals set up, administrators employed, records kept. It is these records, miraculously preserved in private libraries and underground caches, that provide the first detailed portrait of a Holocaust society. In ''The Chronicle of the Lodz Ghetto'', Editor Lucjan Dobroszycki, a survivor, presents an eerie and horrific scene told in terse entries, like a nightmare dreamed in pieces."&lt;ref name="SK"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952526,00.html?promoid=googlep Stefan Kanfer, ''The Chronicle of the Lodz Ghetto'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Polish award===
Lucjan Dobroszycki was posthumously awarded ''[[Polityka]]'' magazine's Historical Award for the year 2006, on the 50th anniversary of its inauguration.

In 1901 Goncharova began her own studies at the Moscow Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture as a sculptor, under [[Paolo Troubetzkoy|Pavel Trubetskoi]], who was associated with the [[Mir iskusstva|World of Art]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Camilla|title=The Great Experiment: Russian Art 1863-1922|date=1962|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1903, she began exhibiting in major Russian salons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Camilla|title=The Great Experiment: Russian Art 1863-1922|date=1962|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was awarded a silver medal for sculpture in 1903-04.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|title=Amazons of the avant-garde : Alexandra Exter, Natalia Goncharova, Liubov Popova, Olga Rozanova, Varvara Stepanova, and Nadezhda Udaltsova|first=|date=2000|publisher=Guggenheim Museum|year=|isbn=0-8109-6924-6|location=New York|page=158|pages=|chapter=Natalia Goncharova|quote=|author1=Sharp, Jane A.|editor1-last=Bowlt|editor1-first=John E.|editor2-last=Drutt|editor2-first=Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was at the Moscow Institute that Goncharova met fellow-student [[Mikhail Larionov]], and not long afterwards they began sharing a studio and living space.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Наталия Гончарова. Между Востоком и Западом|url=http://www.museum.ru/N51091}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Михаил Ларионов и Наталия Гончарова|url=http://www.philol.msu.ru/~rki/advance-guard/larionov_goncharova.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; She withdrew from the Moscow Institute in 1909, and in 1910, after a number of students were expelled from [[Konstantin Korovin]]'s portrait class for imitating the contemporary style of European Modernism, Goncharova, Larionov, [[Robert Falk]], [[Pyotr Konchalovsky]], [[Alexander V. Kuprin|Alexander Kuprin]], [[Ilya Mashkov]] and others formed Moscow's first radical independent exhibiting group, the [[Jack of Diamonds (artists)|Jack of Diamonds]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Participation in avant-garde movements ==
The Jack of Diamonds' first exhibition (December 1910-11) included [[Primitivism|Primitivist]] and [[Cubism|Cubist]] paintings by Goncharova, and in the later [[Donkey's Tail]] exhibition (March–April 1912) organized by Larionov, more than fifty of her paintings were on display.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Goncharova drew inspirations for primitivism from Russian icons and folk art, otherwise known as luboks.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artinrussia.org/natalia-goncharova/|title=Natalia Goncharova - Art in Russia|website=artinrussia.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Donkey's Tail was conceived as an intentional break from European art influence and the establishment of an independent Russian school of modern art. The exhibition proved controversial, and the censor confiscated Goncharova's religiously-themed work, ''The Evangelists'' (1910–11), deeming it [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] for it to be hung at an exhibition titled after the rear end of a donkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Camilla|title=The Great Experiment: Russian Art 1863-1922|date=1962|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goncharova and her counterpart, Larionov, were continuously harassed for their artwork and the way they expressed themselves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the influence of [[Russian Futurism]] is much in evidence in Goncharova's later paintings. Initially preoccupied with icon painting and the primitivism of ethnic Russian folk-art, Goncharova became famous in Russia for her Futurist work such as ''The Cyclist'' and her later [[Rayonism|Rayonist]] works. Goncharova and Larionav painted hieroglyphics and flowers on their faces and walked the streets as a part of a primitivist art movement. Goncharova herself sometimes appears topless in public with symbols on her chest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As leaders of the Moscow [[Futurism (art)|Futurist]]s, they organized provocative lecture evenings in the same vein as their Italian counterparts. Goncharova was also involved with graphic design—writing and illustrating several avant-garde books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2002/russian/|title= The Russian Avant-Garde Book 1910 - 1934|publisher=[[Museum of Modern Art]] |access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She started to exhibit at the [[Salon d'Automne]] (''Exposition de L'art Russe'') beginning in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon-automne.com/2015/04/08/salon-dautomne-international-france-russie-a-saint-petersbourg-04-14-juin-2015-la-presentation-de-noel-coret/ Exposition de l'art russe 1906] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706081849/http://www.salon-automne.com/2015/04/08/salon-dautomne-international-france-russie-a-saint-petersbourg-04-14-juin-2015-la-presentation-de-noel-coret/ |date=2015-07-06 }}; salon-automne.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Goncharova was a member of the avant-garde [[Der Blaue Reiter]] group from its founding in 1911. In 1915, she began to design ballet costumes and sets in [[Geneva]]. In 1915 she started work on a series of designs—''Six Winged Seraph'', ''Angel'', ''St. Andrew'', ''St. Mark'', ''Nativity'', and others—for a ballet commissioned by [[Sergei Diaghilev]] to be titled ''Liturgy''. Also involved in the project, for which [[Igor Stravinsky]] was invited to compose the score, were Larionov and [[Léonide Massine]], but the ballet never materialized.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Leslie. ''Léonide Massine and the 20th Century Ballet'' . McFarland, 2004. p. 12. {{ISBN|0786417528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goncharova moved to Paris in 1921 where she designed a number of stage sets of Diaghilev's [[Ballets Russes]].  She also exhibited at the Salon d'Automne in 1921, and participated regularly at the [[Salon des Tuileries]] and the [[Salon des Indépendants]].

Goncharova and Larionav collaborated on four charity events in Moscow. These events were the Grand Bal des Aristes, the Bal Banal, the Bal Olympique, and the Grand Ourse Bal. They both designed much of the publicity materials for the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Federle|first=Courtney|date=1992-01-01|title=Kuchenmesser DADA: Hannah Höch's Cut Through the Field of Vision|jstor=20685953|journal=Qui Parle|volume=5|issue=2|pages=120–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1922 and 1926 Goncharova created fashion designs for [[Marie Cuttoli]]'s shop, Maison Myrbor on the Rue Vincent, Paris. Her richly embroidered and [[appliqué]]d dress designs were strongly influenced by Russian folk art, Byzantine mosaic and her work for the Ballets Russes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lussier|first=Suzanne|title=Art deco fashion|year=2006|publisher=V&amp;A Publications|location=London|isbn=9781851773909|pages=46|edition=Repr.|quote=Goncharova's primitive interpretation of Russian folk art and Byzantine mosaics was evident not only in her costumes for the Ballets Russes but also in her designs for Myrbor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evening dress by Natalia Goncharova for Myrbor|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O72715/evening-dress-goncharova-natalia/|publisher=V&amp;A Museum|accessdate=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 Goncharova became a French citizen.&lt;ref name="Gugg"&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artists/bios/1257/Natalia%20Goncharova "Natalia Goncharova"], Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Retrieved 24 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 2, 1955, four years after Larionov suffered a stroke, the two artists got married in Paris to safeguard their rights of inheritance.&lt;ref name=Gugg/&gt; Goncharova died seven years later, on October 17, 1962, in Paris after a debilitating struggle with [[rheumatoid arthritis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Amazons of the avant-garde : Alexandra Exter, Natalia Goncharova, Liubov Popova, Olga Rozanova, Varvara Stepanova, and Nadezhda Udaltsova|first=|date=2000|publisher=Guggenheim Museum|year=|isbn=0-8109-6924-6|location=New York|page=163|pages=|chapter=Natalia Goncharova|quote=|author1=Sharp, Jane A.|editor1-last=Bowlt|editor1-first=John E.|editor2-last=Drutt|editor2-first=Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orientalism''' is a term used by art historians and literary and [[cultural studies]] scholars for the imitation or depiction of aspects in [[Eastern world|West Asian, South Asian, Southeast Asian and East Asian cultures]]. These depictions are usually done by writers, designers, and artists from the West. In particular, '''Orientalist painting''', depicting more specifically "the [[Middle East]]",&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 6&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the many specialisms of 19th-century [[academic art]], and the literature of Western countries took a similar interest in Oriental themes.

Since the publication of [[Edward Said]]'s ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' in 1978, much academic discourse has begun to use the term "Orientalism" to refer to a general patronizing Western attitude towards Middle Eastern, Asian, and North African societies. In Said's analysis, the West [[Essentialism|essentializes]] these societies as static and undeveloped—thereby fabricating a view of Oriental culture that can be studied, depicted, and reproduced. Implicit in this fabrication, writes Said, is the idea that Western society is developed, rational, flexible, and superior.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood Mamdani, ''Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terrorism'', New York: Pantheon, 2004; {{ISBN|0-375-42285-4}}; p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
Orientalism refers to the [[Orient]], in reference and opposition to the [[Occident]]; the East and the West, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Latin ''Oriens'', ''Oxford English Dictionary''. p. 000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward. "Orientalism," New York: Vintage Books, 1979. p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; The word Orient entered the English language as the [[Middle French]] ''orient''. The root word ''oriēns'', from the Latin ''Oriēns'', has synonymous denotations: The eastern part of the world; the sky whence comes the sun; the east; the rising sun, etc.; yet the denotation changed as a term of geography. In the "[[Monk's Tale]]" (1375), [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] wrote: "That they conquered many regnes grete / In the orient, with many a fair citee." The term "orient" refers to countries east of the Mediterranean Sea and Southern Europe. ''In Place of Fear'' (1952), [[Aneurin Bevan]] used an expanded denotation of the Orient that comprehended [[East Asia]]: "the awakening of the Orient under the impact of Western ideas". Edward Said said that Orientalism "enables the political, economic, cultural and social domination of the West, not just during colonial times, but also in the present."&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward. "Orientalism," New York: Vintage Books, 1979: 357&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
In art history, the term Orientalism refers to the works of the Western artists who specialized in Oriental subjects, produced from their travels in [[Western Asia]], during the 19th century. In that time, artists and scholars were described as Orientalists, especially in France, where the dismissive use of the term "Orientalist" was made popular by the art critic [[Jules-Antoine Castagnary]].&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 20&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such social disdain for a style of [[Representation (arts)|representational art]], the [[Société des Peintres Orientalistes Français|French Society of Orientalist Painters]] was founded in 1893, with [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] as the honorary president;&lt;ref&gt;Harding, 74&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Britain, the term Orientalist identified "an artist".&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of the French Orientalist Painters Society changed the consciousness of practitioners towards the end of the 19th century, since artists could now see themselves as part of a distinct art movement.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, R., ''Orientalist Aesthetics: Art, Colonialism, and French North Africa, 1880-1930,'' 2003, pp 57 -78&lt;/ref&gt; As an art movement, Orientalist painting is generally treated as one of the many branches of 19th-century [[academic art]]; however, many different styles of Orientalist art were in evidence. Art historians tend to identify two broad types of Orientalist artist: the realists who carefully painted what they observed and those who imagined Orientalist scenes without ever leaving the studio.&lt;ref&gt;Mercedes Volait, "Middle Eastern collections of Orientalist Painting at the Turn of the 21st century: Paradoxical reversal or persistent misunderstanding?; François Pouillon and Jean-Claude Vatin, ''After Orientalism: Critical perspectives on Western Agency and Eastern Reappropriations," ''Leiden Studies in Islam and Society,'' pp 251-271, 2014, Online: &lt;http://www.brill.com/products/book/after-orientalism&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; French painters such as [[Eugène Delacroix]] (1798–1863) and [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1824–1904) are widely regarded as the leading luminaries of the Orientalist movement.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia.com, https://www.encyclopedia.com/literature-and-arts/art-and-architecture/art-general/orientalism&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oriental studies===
In the 18th and 19th centuries, the term [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] identified a scholar who specialized in the languages and literatures of the [[Eastern world]]. Among such scholars were British officials of the [[East India Company]], who said that the [[Arab culture]], the [[culture of India]], and the [[Islamic culture]]s should be studied as equal to the cultures of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Macfie |first = A. L.|year = 2002 |title = Orientalism |publisher = Longman| location = London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0FrJAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn = 0582423864|ref = none| p = Ch One}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among such scholars is the philologist [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]], whose studies of [[Indo-European languages]] established modern [[philology]]. British [[Company rule in India|imperial strategy in India]] favored Orientalism as a technique for developing good relations with the natives—until the 1820s, when the influence of "anglicists" such as [[Thomas Babington Macaulay]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] led to the promotion of Anglocentric education.&lt;ref&gt;Holloway (2006), pp. 1–2. "The Orientalism espoused by Warren Hastings, William Jones and the early East India Company sought to maintain British domination over the Indian subcontinent through patronage of Hindu and Muslim languages and institutions, rather than through their eclipse by English speech and aggressive European acculturation."&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [[Hebraists|Hebraism]] and [[Jewish studies]] gained popularity among British and German scholars in the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0008_0_08624.html|title=Hebraists, Christian|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic field of [[Oriental studies]], which comprehended the cultures of the [[Near East]] and the [[Far East]], became the fields of [[Asian studies]] and [[Middle Eastern studies]].

===Critical studies===
In the book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978), the cultural critic Edward Said redefined the term Orientalism to describe a pervasive Western tradition — academic and artistic — of prejudiced outsider-interpretations of the Eastern world, which was shaped by the cultural attitudes of European [[imperialism]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 24&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis of ''Orientalism'' develops [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s theory of [[cultural hegemony]], and [[Michel Foucault]]'s theorisation of [[discourse]] (the [[knowledge]]-and-[[Power (social and political)|power]] relation) to criticise the scholarly tradition of Oriental studies. Said criticised contemporary scholars who perpetuated the tradition of outsider-interpretation of [[Arab]]o-Islamic cultures, especially [[Bernard Lewis]] and [[Fouad Ajami]].&lt;ref&gt;''Orientalism'' (1978) Preface, 2003 ed. p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xypolia|first=Ilia|title=Orientations and Orientalism: The Governor Sir Ronald Storrs|journal=Journal of IslamicJerusalem Studies|year=2011|volume=11|issue=1|pages=24–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analyses are of Orientalism in European literature, especially French literature, and do not analyse [[visual art]] and [[Orientalist painting]]. In that vein, the art historian [[Linda Nochlin]] applied Said's methods of critical analysis to art, "with uneven results".&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 6, 11 (quoted), 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[academy]], the book ''Orientalism'' (1978) became a foundational text of [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial cultural studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xypolia|first=Ilia|title=Orientations and Orientalism: The Governor Sir Ronald Storrs|journal=Journal of Islamic Jerusalem Studies|year=2011|volume=11|issue=1|pages=25–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in relation to the cultural institution of [[citizenship]], Orientalism has rendered the concept of ''citizenship'' as a problem of [[epistemology]], because citizenship originated as a social institution of the Western world; as such, the problem of defining citizenship reconfigures the idea of ''Europe'' in time of crises.&lt;ref&gt;Mura, Andrea, (2015) "[https://www.academia.edu/21512966/Dis-orienting_Austerity_The_Indebted_Citizen_as_the_New_Soul_of_Europe Disorienting Austerity: The Indebted Citizen as the New Soul of Europe]" In Engin Isin (ed.), ''Citizenship After Orientalism: Transforming Political Theory''. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Said said that Orientalism, as an "idea of representation is a theoretical one: The Orient is a stage on which the whole East is confined" in order to make the Eastern world "less fearsome to the West";&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Said, Edward. "Orientalism," New York: Vintage Books, 1979: 363&lt;/ref&gt; that the developing world, primarily the West, is the cause of [[colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Said|first1=Edward|title=Orientalism|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JncXpQQoZAo|date=April 16, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in ''Empire: A Very Short Introduction'' (2000), Stephen Howe agreed with Said that Western nations and their empires were created by the exploitation of underdeveloped countries, by the extraction of wealth and labour from one country to another country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howe|first1=Stephen|title=Empire:A Very Short Introduction|publisher=Oxford University press|pages=73–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In European architecture and design==
{{Further|Orientalism in early modern France}}
The [[Moresque]] style of [[Renaissance]] [[ornament (art)|ornament]] is a European adaptation of the Islamic [[arabesque]] that began in the late 15th century and was to be used in some types of work, such as [[bookbinding]], until almost the present day. Early architectural use of motifs lifted from the Indian subcontinent is known as [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture]]. One of the earliest examples is the façade of [[Guildhall, London]] (1788–1789). The style gained momentum in the west with the publication of views of India by [[William Hodges]], and [[William Daniell|William]] and [[Thomas Daniell]] from about 1795. Examples of "Hindoo" architecture are [[Sezincote House]] (c. 1805) in [[Gloucestershire]], built for a [[nabob]] returned from [[Bengal]], and the [[Royal Pavilion]] in [[Brighton]].

''[[Turquerie]]'', which began as early as the late 15th century, continued until at least the 18th century, and included both the use of "Turkish" styles in the decorative arts, the adoption of Turkish costume at times, and interest in art depicting the [[Ottoman Empire]] itself. Venice, the traditional trading partner of the Ottomans, was the earliest centre, with France becoming more prominent in the 18th century.

''[[Chinoiserie]]'' is the catch-all term for the fashion for Chinese themes in decoration in Western Europe, beginning in the late 17th century and peaking in waves, especially [[Rococo]] Chinoiserie, ''c.'' 1740–1770. From the [[Renaissance]] to the 18th century, Western designers attempted to imitate the technical sophistication of Chinese ceramics with only partial success. Early hints of Chinoiserie appeared in the 17th century in nations with active East India companies: England (the [[East India Company]]), Denmark (the [[Danish East India Company]]), the Netherlands (the [[Dutch East India Company]]) and France (the [[French East India Company]]). Tin-glazed pottery made at [[Delft]] and other Dutch towns adopted genuine [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]-era [[blue and white porcelain]] from the early 17th century. Early ceramic wares made at [[Meissen]] and other centers of true [[porcelain]] imitated Chinese shapes for dishes, vases and [[teaware]]s (see [[Chinese export porcelain]]).

Pleasure pavilions in "Chinese taste" appeared in the formal parterres of late Baroque and Rococo German palaces, and in tile panels at [[Aranjuez]] near [[Madrid]]. [[Thomas Chippendale]]'s mahogany tea tables and china cabinets, especially, were embellished with fretwork glazing and railings, ''c.'' 1753–70. Sober ''homages'' to early Xing scholars' furnishings were also naturalized, as the ''tang'' evolved into a mid-Georgian side table and squared slat-back armchairs that suited English gentlemen as well as Chinese scholars. Not every adaptation of Chinese design principles falls within mainstream "chinoiserie". Chinoiserie media included imitations of lacquer and painted tin (tôle) ware that imitated japanning, early painted wallpapers in sheets, and ceramic figurines and table ornaments. Small [[pagoda]]s appeared on chimneypieces and full-sized ones in gardens. [[Kew]] has a magnificent garden pagoda designed by [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]]. The [[Wilhelma]] (1846) in [[Stuttgart]] is an example of [[Moorish Revival architecture]]. [[Leighton House Museum|Leighton House]], built for the artist [[Frederic Leighton]], has a conventional facade but elaborate Arab-style interiors, including original Islamic tiles and other elements as well as Victorian Orientalizing work.

After 1860, ''[[Japonism]],'' sparked by the importing of [[ukiyo-e]], became an important influence in the western arts. In particular, many modern French artists such as [[Claude Monet]] and [[Edgar Degas]] were influenced by the Japanese style. [[Mary Cassatt]], an American artist who worked in France, used elements of combined patterns, flat planes and shifting perspective of Japanese prints in her own images.&lt;ref&gt;The subject of Ives&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings of [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]'s ''[[The Peacock Room]]'' demonstrated how he used aspects of Japanese tradition and are some of the finest works of the genre. California architects [[Greene and Greene]] were inspired by Japanese elements in their design of the [[Gamble House (Pasadena, California)|Gamble House]] and other buildings.

[[Egyptian Revival architecture]] became popular in the early and mid-19th century and continued as a minor style into the early 20th century. [[Moorish Revival architecture]] began in the early 19th century in the German states and was particularly popular for building synagogues. [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture]] was a genre that arose in the late 19th century in the [[British Raj]].

==Orientalist art==
===Pre-19th century===
[[File:Gentile Bellini Madonna and Child Enthroned late 15th century.jpg|thumb|A "Bellini type" [[Islamic]] [[prayer rug]], seen from the top, at the feet of the [[Virgin Mary]], in [[Gentile Bellini]]'s ''Madonna and Child Enthroned'', late 15th century]]
Depictions of Islamic "[[Moors]]" and "Turks" (imprecisely named [[Muslim]] groups of [[southern Europe]], [[North Africa]] and [[West Asia]]) can be found in Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque art. In Biblical scenes in [[Early Netherlandish painting]], secondary figures, especially Romans, were given exotic costumes that distantly reflected the clothes of the [[Near East]]. The [[Biblical Magi|Three Magi]] in [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity scenes]] were an especial focus for this. In general art with Biblical settings would not be considered as Orientalist except where contemporary or historicist Middle Eastern detail or settings is a feature of works, as with some paintings by [[Gentile Bellini]] and others, and a number of 19th century works. Renaissance [[Venice]] had a phase of particular interest in depictions of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in painting and [[old master print|prints]]. Gentile Bellini, who travelled to [[Constantinople]] and painted the Sultan, and [[Vittore Carpaccio]] were the leading painters. By then the depictions were more accurate, with men typically dressed all in white. The depiction of [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting]] sometimes draws from Orientalist interest, but more often just reflects the prestige these expensive objects had in the period.&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Étienne Liotard]] (1702–1789) visited [[Istanbul]] and painted numerous [[pastel]]s of Turkish domestic scenes; he also continued to wear Turkish attire for much of the time when he was back in Europe. The ambitious Scottish 18th-century artist [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] found a solution to the problem of using modern dress, considered unheroic and inelegant, in [[history painting]] by using Middle Eastern settings with Europeans wearing local costume, as travelers were advised to do. His huge ''James Dawkins and Robert Wood Discovering the Ruins of [[Palmyra]]'' (1758, now Edinburgh) elevates tourism to the heroic, with the two travelers wearing what look very like [[toga]]s. Many travelers had themselves painted in exotic Eastern dress on their return, including [[Lord Byron]], as did many who had never left Europe, including [[Madame de Pompadour]].&lt;ref&gt;Christine Riding, ''Travellers and Sitters: The Orientalist Portrait'', in Tromans, 48–75&lt;/ref&gt; The growing French interest in exotic Oriental luxury and lack of liberty in the 18th century to some extent reflected a pointed analogy with France's own [[absolute monarchy]].&lt;ref name="McCabe2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ina Baghdiantz McCabe|title=Orientalism in Early Modern France: Eurasian Trade, Exoticism and the Ancien Regime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XnS6lVLapI4C&amp;pg=PA134|accessdate=31 August 2013|date=15 July 2008|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84520-374-0|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byron's poetry was highly influential in introducing Europe to the heady cocktail of [[Romanticism]] in exotic Oriental settings which was to dominate 19th century Oriental art.

===French Orientalism===
[[File:Leon Cogniet - L Expedition D Egypte Sous Les Ordres De Bonaparte.jpg|thumb|240px|''The 1798 Egyptian Expedition Under the Command of Bonaparte'', [[Léon Cogniet]], 1835. [[Musée du Louvre]]]]
[[File:Ferdinand-Victor-Eugène Delacroix, French - The Death of Sardanapalus - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|240px|''[[The Death of Sardanapalus]]'', [[Eugène Delacroix]], 1827]]
French Orientalist painting was transformed by [[Napoleon]]'s ultimately unsuccessful [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|invasion of Egypt and Syria]] in 1798–1801, which stimulated great public interest in [[Egyptology]], and was also recorded in subsequent years by Napoleon's court painters, especially [[Antoine-Jean Gros]], although the Middle Eastern campaign was not one on which he accompanied the army. Two of his most successful paintings, ''[[Bonaparte Visiting the Plague Victims of Jaffa]]'' (1804) and ''[[Battle of Abukir (1799)|Battle of Abukir]]'' (1806) focus on the Emperor, as he was by then, but include many Egyptian figures, as does the less effective ''Napoleon at the Battle of the Pyramids'' (1810). [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]]'s ''La Révolte du Caire'' (1810) was another large and prominent example. A well-illustrated ''Description de l'Égypte'' was published by the French Government in twenty volumes between 1809 and 1828, concentrating on [[antiquities]].&lt;ref&gt;Harding, 69–70&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eugène Delacroix]]'s first great success, ''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' (1824) was painted before he visited Greece or the East, and followed his friend [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' in showing a recent incident in distant parts that had aroused public opinion. [[Greece]] was still fighting for independence from the Ottomans, and was effectively as exotic as the more Near Eastern parts of the empire. Delacroix followed up with ''[[Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi]]'' (1827), commemorating a siege of the previous year, and ''[[The Death of Sardanapalus]]'', inspired by [[Lord Byron]], which although set in antiquity has been credited with beginning the mixture of sex, violence, lassitude and exoticism which runs through much French Orientalist painting.&lt;ref&gt;Nochlin, 294–296; Tromans, 128&lt;/ref&gt; In 1832, Delacroix finally visited what is now [[Algeria]], recently conquered by the French, and [[Morocco]], as part of a diplomatic mission to the [[Sultan of Morocco]]. He was greatly struck by what he saw, comparing the North African way of life to that of the Ancient Romans, and continued to paint subjects from his trip on his return to France. Like many later Orientalist painters, he was frustrated by the difficulty of sketching women, and many of his scenes featured [[Jews]] or warriors on horses. However, he was apparently able to get into the women's' quarters or [[harem]] of a house to sketch what became ''[[Women of Algiers]]''; few later harem scenes had this claim to authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, 81&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Le Bain Turc, by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|240px|Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, ''[[The Turkish Bath]]'', 1862]]
When Ingres, the director of the French ''Académie de peinture'', painted a highly colored vision of a ''[[Turkish bath]]'', he made his eroticized Orient publicly acceptable by his diffuse generalizing of the female forms (who might all have been the same model). More open sensuality was seen as acceptable in the exotic Orient.&lt;ref name="Tromans, 135"&gt;Tromans, 135&lt;/ref&gt; This imagery persisted in art into the early 20th century, as evidenced in [[Henri Matisse]]'s orientalist semi-nudes from his Nice period, and his use of Oriental costumes and patterns. Ingres' pupil [[Théodore Chassériau]] (1819–1856) had already achieved success with his nude ''[[The Toilette of Esther]]'' (1841, [[Louvre]]) and equestrian portrait of ''Ali-Ben-Hamet, Caliph of Constantine and Chief of the Haractas, Followed by his Escort'' (1846) before he first visited the East, but in later decades the [[steamship]] made travel much easier and increasing numbers of artists traveled to the Middle East and beyond, painting a wide range of Oriental scenes.

In many of these works, they portrayed the Orient as exotic, colorful and sensual, not to say [[stereotype]]d. Such works typically concentrated on Arab, Jewish, and other Semitic cultures, as those were the ones visited by artists as France became more engaged in North Africa. French artists such as [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] and [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]] painted many works depicting Islamic culture, often including lounging [[odalisque]]s. They stressed both lassitude and visual spectacle. Other scenes, especially in [[genre painting]], have been seen as either closely comparable to their equivalents set in modern-day or historical Europe, or as also reflecting an Orientalist mind-set in the Saidian sense of the term. Gérôme was the precursor, and often the master, of a number of French painters in the later part of the century whose works were often frankly salacious, frequently featuring scenes in harems, public baths and slave auctions (the last two also available with classical decor), and responsible, with others, for "the equation of Orientalism with the nude in pornographic mode";&lt;ref&gt;Tromans. 136&lt;/ref&gt; (''Gallery, below'')

===British Orientalism===
[[File:William Holman Hunt 002.jpg|thumb|left|190px|[[William Holman Hunt]], ''A Street Scene in Cairo; The Lantern-Maker's Courtship'', 1854–61]]
Though British political interest in the territories of the unravelling Ottoman Empire was as intense as in France, it was mostly more discreetly exercised. The origins of British Orientalist 19th-century painting owe more to religion than military conquest or the search for plausible locations for naked women. The leading British [[genre painter]], [[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]] was 55 when he travelled to [[Istanbul]] and [[Jerusalem]] in 1840, dying off [[Gibraltar]] during the return voyage. Though not noted as a religious painter, Wilkie made the trip with a [[Protestant]] agenda to reform religious painting, as he believed that: "a [[Martin Luther]] in painting is as much called for as in theology, to sweep away the abuses by which our divine pursuit is encumbered", by which he meant traditional Christian [[iconography]]. He hoped to find more authentic settings and decor for Biblical subjects at their original location, though his death prevented more than studies being made. Other artists including the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] had similar motivations,&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 14 (quoted), 162–165&lt;/ref&gt; giving an emphasis on realism in British Orientalist art from the start.&lt;ref&gt;Nochlin, 289, disputing Rosenthal assertion, and insisting that "there must be some attempt to clarify ''whose'' reality we are talking about".&lt;/ref&gt; The French artist [[James Tissot]] also used contemporary Middle Eastern landscape and decor for Biblical subjects, with little regard for historical costumes or other fittings.

William Holman Hunt produced a number of major paintings of Biblical subjects drawing on his Middle Eastern travels, improvising variants of contemporary Arab costume and furnishings to avoid specifically Islamic styles, and also some landscapes and genre subjects. The biblical subjects included ''[[The Scapegoat (painting)|The Scapegoat]]'' (1856), ''[[The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple]]'' (1860), and ''[[The Shadow of Death]]'' (1871). ''[[The Miracle of the Holy Fire (painting)|The Miracle of the Holy Fire]]'' (1899) was intended as a picturesque satire on the local Eastern Christians, of whom, like most English visitors, Hunt took a very dim view. His ''A Street Scene in Cairo; The Lantern-Maker's Courtship'' (1854–61) is a rare contemporary narrative scene, as the young man feels his fiancé's face, which he is not allowed to see, through her veil, as a Westerner in the background beats his way up the street with his stick.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 16–17 and see index&lt;/ref&gt; This a rare intrusion of a clearly contemporary figure into an Orientalist scene; mostly they claim the picturesqueness of the historical painting so popular at the time, without the trouble of researching authentic costumes and settings.

When Gérôme exhibited ''For Sale; Slaves at Cairo'' at the [[Royal Academy]] in London in 1871, it was "widely found offensive", perhaps partly because the British liked to think they had successfully suppressed the [[slave trade]] in Egypt, also for cruelty and "representing fleshiness for its own sake".&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; But Rana Kabbani believes that "French Orientalist painting, as exemplified by the works of Gérôme, may appear more sensual, gaudy, gory and sexually explicit than its British counterpart, but this is a difference of style not substance ... Similar strains of fascination and repulsion convulsed their artists"&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 43&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, nudity and violence are more evident in British paintings set in the ancient world, and "the iconography of the ''[[odalisque]]'' ... the Oriental [[sex slave]] whose image is offered up to the viewer as freely as she herself supposedly was to her master – is almost entirely French in origin",&lt;ref name="Tromans, 135"/&gt; though taken up with enthusiasm by Italian and other painters.

[[John Frederick Lewis]], who lived for several years in a traditional mansion in [[Cairo]], painted highly detailed works showing both realistic [[Genre painting|genre scenes]] of Middle Eastern life and more idealized scenes in upper class Egyptian interiors with no traces of Western cultural influence yet apparent. His careful and seemingly affectionate representation of Islamic architecture, furnishings, screens, and costumes set new standards of realism, which influenced other artists, including Gérôme in his later works. He "never painted a nude", and his wife modelled for several of his harem scenes,&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, quote 135; 134 on his wife; generally: 22–32, 80–85, 130–135, and see index&lt;/ref&gt; which, with the rare examples by the classicist painter [[Lord Leighton]], imagine "the harem as a place of almost English domesticity, ... [where]... women's fully clothed respectability suggests a moral healthiness to go with their natural good looks".&lt;ref name="Tromans, 135"/&gt;

Other artists concentrated on [[landscape painting]], often of desert scenes, including [[Richard Dadd]] and [[Edward Lear]]. [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] (1796–1864) produced architectural and landscape views, many of [[antiquities]], and published very successful books of [[lithograph]]s from them.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 102–125, covers landscape&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian Orientalist art was largely concerned with the areas of [[Central Asia]] that Russia was conquering during the century, and also in historical painting with the [[Mongol]]s who had dominated Russia for much of the Middle Ages, who were rarely shown in a good light. [[Nationalist]] historical painting in [[Central Europe]] and the [[Balkans]] dwelt on Turkish oppression, with [[battle scene]]s and maidens about to be raped.

The Saidian analysis has not prevented a strong revival of interest in, and collecting of, 19th century Orientalist works since the 1970s, the latter was in large part led by Middle Eastern buyers.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 7, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors and composers are not commonly referred to as "Orientalist" in the way that artists are, and relatively few specialized in Oriental topics or styles, or are even best known for their works including them. But many major figures, from Mozart to Flaubert, have produced significant works with Oriental subjects or treatments. [[Lord Byron]] with his four long "Turkish tales" in poetry, is one of the most important writers to make exotic fantasy Oriental settings a significant theme in the literature of [[Romanticism]]. Verdi's opera ''Aida'' (1871) is set in Egypt as portrayed through the content and the visual spectacle. "Aida" depicts a militaristic Egypt's tyranny over Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;Beard and Gloag 2005, 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish Orientalism had a particular character, drawing on various beliefs about early historical links between Ireland and the East, few of which are now regarded as historically correct. The mythical [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]] are one example of this. The Irish were also conscious of the views of other nations seeing them as comparably backward to the East, and Europe's "backyard Orient".&lt;ref&gt;Lennon, Joseph. "Irish Orientalism," New York: Syracuse University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===In music===
In music, Orientalism may be applied to styles occurring in different periods, such as the ''alla Turca'', used by multiple composers including [[Mozart]] and [[Beethoven]].&lt;ref name="Beard and Gloag 2005, 129"&gt;Beard and Gloag 2005, 129&lt;/ref&gt; The American musicologist [[Richard Taruskin]] has identified in 19th-century Russian music a strain of Orientalism: "the East as a sign or metaphor, as imaginary geography, as historical fiction, as the reduced and totalized other against which we construct our (not less reduced and totalized) sense of ourselves".&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (1997): p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Taruskin concedes Russian composers, unlike those in France and Germany, felt an "ambivalence" to the theme since "Russia was a contiguous empire in which Europeans, living side by side with 'orientals', identified (and intermarried) with them far more than in the case of other colonial powers".&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (1997): p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Taruskin characterizes Orientalism in Romantic Russian music as having melodies "full of close little ornaments and melismas",&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (1997): p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; chromatic accompanying lines, drone bass&lt;ref name="taruskin165"&gt;Taruskin (1997): p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;—characteristics which were used by [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]], [[Mily Balakirev|Balakirev]], [[Alexander Borodin|Borodin]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Sergei Lyapunov|Lyapunov]], and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninov]]. These musical characteristics evoke "not just the East, but the seductive East that emasculates, enslaves, renders passive. In a word, it signifies the promise of the experience of ''nega'', a prime attribute of the orient as imagined by the Russians. ... In opera and song, ''nega'' often simply denotes S-E-X a la russe, desired or achieved."&lt;ref name="taruskin165" /&gt;

Orientalism is also traceable in music that is considered to have effects of [[exoticism]], including the ''[[japonisme]]'' in [[Claude Debussy]]'s piano music all the way to the [[sitar]] being used in recordings by [[the Beatles]].&lt;ref name="Beard and Gloag 2005, 129"/&gt;

===In literature===
The Romantic movement in literature began in 1785 and ended around 1830. The term "Romantic" references the ideas and culture that writers of the time reflected in their work. During this time, the culture and objects of the East began to have a profound effect on Europe. Extensive traveling by artists and members of the European elite brought travelogues and sensational tales back to the West creating a great interest in all things "foreign". Romantic Orientalism incorporates African and Asian geographic locations, well-known colonial and "native" personalities, folklore, and philosophies to create a literary environment of colonial exploration from a distinctly European worldview. The current trend in analysis of this movement references a belief in this literature as a mode to justify European colonial endeavors with the expansion of territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Romantic Orientalism: Overview|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/romantic/topic_4/welcome.htm|website=The Norton Anthology of English Literature|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his novel ''[[Salammbô (novel)|Salammbô]]'', [[Gustave Flaubert]] used ancient [[Carthage]] in North Africa as a [[foil (literature)|foil]] to ancient [[Rome]]. He portrayed its culture as morally corrupting and suffused with dangerously alluring eroticism. This novel proved hugely influential on later portrayals of ancient [[Semitic cultures]].

===In film===
Said argues that the continuity of Orientalism into the present can be found in influential images, particularly through the [[Cinema of the United States]], as the West has now grown to include the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Geographies of Postcolonialism|last = Sharp|first = Joanne|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] feature film, such as the ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' series, ''[[The Mummy (franchise)|The Mummy]]'' films, and Disney's ''[[Aladdin (franchise)|Aladdin]]'' film series demonstrate the imagined geographies of the East.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The films usually portray the lead heroic characters as being from the Western world, while the villains often come from the East.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The representation of the Orient has continued in film, although this representation does not necessarily have any truth to it.

The overly sexualized character of [[Princess Jasmine]] in ''Aladdin'' is simply a continuation of the paintings from the 19th century, where women were represented as erotic, sexualized male fantasies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Geographies of postcolonialism|last = Sharp|first = Joanne|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Teahouse of the August Moon (film)|The Tea House of the August Moon]]'' (1956), as argued by Pedro Iacobelli, there are tropes of orientalism. He notes, that the film "tells us more about the Americans and the American's image of Okinawa rather than about the Okinawan people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}} &lt;/ref&gt;The film characterizes the Okinawans as "merry but backward" and "de-politicized", which ignored the real-life Okinawan political protests over forceful land acquisition by the American military at the time.

Kimiko Akita, in "Orientalism and the Binary of Fact and Fiction in Memoirs of a Geisha", argues that ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|Memoirs of a Geisha]]'' (2005) contains orientalist tropes and deep "cultural misrepresentations". She states that ''Memoirs of a Geish]'' "reinforces the idea of Japanese culture and geisha as exotic, backward, irrational, dirty, profane, promiscuous, bizarre, and enigmatic".

===In dance===
During the Romantic Period of the 19th century, [[ballet]] developed a preoccupation with the exotic. This exoticism ranged from ballets set in Scotland to those based on ethereal creatures. By the later part of the century, ballets were capturing the presumed essence of the mysterious East. These ballets often included sexual themes and tended to be based on assumptions of people rather than on concrete facts. Orientalism is apparent in numerous ballets.

The Orient motivated several major ballets, which have survived since the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. ''Le Corsaire'' premiered in 1856 at the Paris Opera, with choreography by [[Joseph Mazilier]].&lt;ref name="abt corsaire"&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Corsaire|url=http://www.abt.org/education/archive/ballets/corsairefl.html|website=ABT|publisher=Ballet Theatre Foundation, Inc.|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marius Petipa]] re-choreographed the ballet for the Maryinsky Ballet in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1899.&lt;ref name="abt corsaire" /&gt; Its complex storyline, loosely based on Lord Byron's poem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Au|first1=Susan|title=Ballet and Modern Dance|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; takes place in Turkey and focuses on a love story between a pirate and a beautiful slave girl. Scenes include a bazaar where women are sold to men as slaves, and the Pasha's Palace, which features his harem of wives.&lt;ref name="abt corsaire" /&gt; In 1877, Marius Petipa choreographed ''La Bayadere'', the love story of an Indian temple dancer and Indian warrior. This ballet was based on Kalidasa's play ''Sakuntala''.&lt;ref name=Au&gt;{{cite book|last1=Au|first1=Susan|title=Ballet and Modern Dance|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson, Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Bayadere'' used vaguely Indian costuming, and incorporated Indian inspired hand gestures into classical ballet. In addition, it included a 'Hindu Dance,' motivated by Kathak, an Indian dance form.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; Another ballet, ''Sheherazade'', choreographed by Michel Fokine in 1910 to music by Nicholas Rimsky-Korsakov, is a story involving a shah's wife and her illicit relations with a Golden Slave, originally played by Vaslav Nijinsky.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; The ballet's controversial fixation on sex includes an orgy in an oriental harem. When the shah discovers the actions of his numerous wives and their lovers, he orders the deaths of those involved.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; ''Sheherazade'' was loosely based on folktales of questionable authenticity.

Several lesser-known ballets of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century also reveal Orientalism. For instance, in Petipa's ''Pharaoh's Daughter'' (1862), an Englishman imagines himself, in an opium-induced dream, as an Egyptian boy who wins the love of the Pharaoh's daughter, Aspicia.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; Aspicia's costume consisted of 'Egyptian' décor on a tutu.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; Another ballet, Hippolyte Monplaisir's ''Brahma'', which premiered in 1868 in La Scala, Italy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jowitt|first1=Deborah|title=Time and the Dancing Image|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a story that involves romantic relations between a slave girl and Brahma, the Hindu god, when he visits earth.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; In addition, in 1909, Serge Diagilev included ''Cleopatra'' in Ballet's Russe's repertory. With its theme of sex, this revision of Fokine's ''Une Nuit d' Egypte'' combined the "exoticism and grandeur" that audiences of this time craved.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt;

As one of the pioneers of modern dance in America, [[Ruth St Denis]] also explored Orientalism in her dancing. Her dances were not authentic; she drew inspiration from photographs, books, and later from museums in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Au|first1=Susan|title=Ballet and modern Dance|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson, Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the exoticism of her dances catered to the interests of society women in America.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; She included ''Radha'' and ''The Cobras'' in her 'Indian' program in 1906. In addition, she found success in Europe with another Indian-themed ballet, ''The Nautch'' in 1908. In 1909, upon her return to America, St Denis created her first 'Egyptian' work, ''Egypta''.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; Her preference for Orientalism continued, culminating with ''Ishtar of the Seven Gates'' in 1923, about a Babylonian goddess.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt;

While Orientalism in dance climaxed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it is still present in modern times. For instance, major ballet companies regularly perform ''Le Corsaire'', ''La Bayadere'', and ''Sheherazade''. Furthermore, Orientalism is also found within newer versions of ballets. In versions of ''The Nutcracker'', such as the 2010 [[American Ballet Theatre]] production, the Chinese dance uses an arm position with the arms bent at a ninety-degree angle and the index fingers pointed upwards, while the Arabian dance uses two dimensional bent arm movements. Inspired by ballets of the past, stereotypical 'Oriental' movements and arm positions have developed and remain.

A major force in the mutual influence of Eastern and Western [[spirituality]] and religiosity was the [[Theosophical Society]],{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=185-188}}{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} a group searching for ancient wisdom from the East and spreading Eastern religious ideas in the West.{{sfn|Lavoie|2012}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} One of its salient features was the belief in "[[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom (Theosophy)|Masters of Wisdom]]",{{sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Ascended Master Teachings]]}} "beings, human or once human, who have transcended the normal frontiers of knowledge, and who make their wisdom available to others".{{sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32}} The Theosophical Society also spread Western ideas in the East, contributing to its modernisation and a growing nationalism in the Asian colonies.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}

Much of Said's criticism of Western Orientalism is based on what he describes as articularizing trends. These ideologies are present in Asian works by Indian, Chinese, and Japanese writers and artists, in their views of Western culture and tradition.

A particularly significant development is the manner in which Orientalism has taken shape in non-Western cinema, as for instance in Hindi cinema.

Said has been accused of Occidentalizing the west in his critique Orientalism, ''i.e.'' of being guilty of falsely characterizing the West in the same way that he accuses Western scholars of falsely characterizing the East.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Geographies of Postcolonialism|last = Sharp|first = Jo|publisher = Sage|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-4129-0778-1|location = London|pages = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Said essentialized the west by creating a homogeneous image of the area. Currently, the west consists not only of Europe, but also the United States, which has become more influential and dominant over the years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Pennello (bandiera).svg|thumb|right|Tapering pennant]]
[[File:Gallardeton.svg|thumb|right|Triangular swallowtail pennant]]
A '''pennon''' or '''pennant''' is a [[flag]] that is larger at the [[Hoist (flag)|hoist]] than at the [[Fly (flag)|fly]]. It can have several shapes, such as triangular, tapering or a [[burgee]].

It was one of the principal three varieties of [[flag]]s carried during the [[Middle Ages]] (the other two were the [[banner]] and the [[Heraldic flag#Standard|standard]]).{{sfn|Swinburne|1911|p=456}} '''Pennoncells''' and '''streamers''' or '''pendants''' are minor varieties of this style of flag. The pennon is a flag resembling the [[guidon (heraldic flag)|guidon]] in shape, but only half the size. It does not contain any coat of arms, but only [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]]s, [[motto]]s and [[heraldic]] and ornamental devices.

==Etymology==
Pennon comes from the Latin ''penna'' meaning "a [[wing]]" or "a [[feather]]".

==Description==
The pennon was sometimes pointed, but more generally forked or swallow-tailed at the end. In the 11th century, the pennon was generally square, the fly end being decorated with the addition of pointed tongues or streamers, somewhat similar to the [[oriflamme]]. During the reign of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], the pennon acquired the distinctive swallow-tail, or the single-pointed shape. Another version of the single-pointed pennon was introduced in the 13th century. In shape this was a [[scalene triangle]], obtained by cutting diagonally the vertically oblong banner.

==Usage==
[[File:Pennon of James Douglas, Earl of Moray from Otterburn 001.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The pennon of James Douglas, Earl of Douglas as used at the [[Battle of Otterburn]].]]

The pennon was a purely personal [[ensign]]. It was essentially the flag of the [[knight bachelor]], as apart from the [[knight banneret]], carried by him on his lance, displaying his personal [[armorial bearings]], and set out so that they stood in correct position when he couched his lance for charging. A manuscript of the 16th century (Harl. 2358, "A paper Heraldical book in small Quarto") in the [[British Museum]], which gives detailed particulars as to the size, shape and bearings of the [[standard (flag)|standards]], [[banner]]s, pennons and pennoncells, says "a pennon must be two yards and a half long, made round at the end, and contain the arms of the owner," and warns that "from a standard or streamer a man may flee but not from his banner or pennon bearing his arms." A pennoncell (or penselle) was a diminutive pennon carried by the [[esquire]]s.{{sfn|Swinburne|1911|p=456}}

Pennons were also used for any special ceremonial occasion, and more particularly at state funerals. For instance, there were "XII doz. penselles" among the items that figured at the funeral of the [[Duke of Norfolk]] in 1554, and in the description of the [[Lord Mayor of London|lord mayor]]'s procession in 1555, it reads "two goodly pennes (state barges) decked with flags and streamers, and a 1000 penselles."  Among the items that ran the total cost of the funeral of [[Oliver Cromwell]] up to an enormous sum of money, there is the mention of 30 dozen of pennoncells a foot long and costing 20 shillings a dozen, and 20 dozen of the same kind of flags at 12 shillings a dozen.{{sfn|Swinburne|1911|p=456,457}}&lt;ref&gt;"For the solemnization of the funeral, no less than the sum of sixty thousand pounds was allotted to defray the expence" {{harv|Rutt|1828|pages=516–530}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variant types==
The streamer, so called in [[Tudor period|Tudor]] days but now better known as the pennant or pendant, was a long, tapering flag, which it was directed "shall stand in the top of a ship or in the [[forecastle]], and therein be put no arms, but the man's [[Heraldic badge|cognisance]] or [[coat of arms|device]], and may be of length 20, 30, 40 or {{convert|60|yd}}, and is slit as well as a guidon or standard".{{sfn|Swinburne|1911|p=458}} Among the fittings of the ship that took [[Henry de Beauchamp, 1st Duke of Warwick|Beauchamp]], [[Earl of Warwick]], to [[France]] in the reign of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] was a "great streamer for the ship {{convert|40|yd}} in length [and] {{convert|8|yd}} in breadth".{{sfn|Swinburne|1911|p=458}}

Besides the white ensign, ships commissioned in the Royal Navy fly a long streamer from the maintopgallant masthead. This, which is called a [[pennant (commissioning)|pennant]], is in fact the sign of command, and it is first hoisted when a captain commissions his ship. The pennant, which was really the old "pennoncell", was of three colours for the whole of its length, and towards the end left separate in two or three tails, and so continued until the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Now, however the pennant is a long white streamer with the St George's cross in the inner portion close to the mast. Pennants have been carried by men-of-war from the earliest times, prior to 1653 at the yard-arm, but since that date at the maintopgallant masthead.{{sfn|Swinburne|1911|p=459}} There are other navies that also fly pennant in a similar manner (see [[pennant (commissioning)]]).

The commissioning pennant in ships may end in a point, but they can also be forked, in which case it is also called a [[banderole]].&lt;ref&gt;"1. A long narrow flag, with cleft end, flying from the mast-heads of ships, carried in battle, etc." {{harv|OED staff|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pennants are also associated with [[United States|American]] sports teams, such as [[Major League Baseball]] and [[college]] sports teams. In [[Australian rules football]], a pennant is awarded to the winner of major competitions. For many years, this was the only prize given. As a result, a League Championship is often referred to as a "pennant", as in, "The [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]] win the Pennant!" And in Australian football, a premiership can also be referred to as a "flag".

==The Dutch Pennon==

In the Netherlands, an orange pennon is always used on the King's Day. It is flown alongside the standard Dutch flag. The Dutch provinces each have a pennon as well.

'''Peter James''' is a British historian and author specializing in the [[ancient history]] and [[archaeology]] of the Eastern [[Mediterranean region]], with key related interests being chronology (dating techniques), ancient technology and astronomy, and sub-[[Roman Britain]]. He graduated in archaeology and ancient history at the [[University of Birmingham]] and pursued postgraduate research in ancient history at [[University College London]]. He has published four books (three co-authored) on various aspects of ancient history.

In his best known work, ''Centuries of Darkness'', he and four colleagues challenged traditional chronology for the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] to [[Iron Age|Iron]] Ages in the [[Near East]] and the [[Eastern Mediterranean]]. In particular, they advanced the idea that the [[Greek Dark Ages]] can be drastically reduced and arose solely from a misreading of key elements of the [[history of ancient Egypt]]. Ongoing criticism and discussion of the evidence is listed on the authors' own website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centuries.co.uk/replies.htm|title=Responses to Critics of Centuries of Darkness|website=www.centuries.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centuries of Darkness (CoD) debate has recently been met with increased interest, partly due to the organisation of three colloquiums on the subject of ancient World Chronology. The conference papers of the third colloquium were published by Peter James and Peter van der Veen in ''Solomon and Shishak: Current Perspectives from Archaeology, Epigraphy, History and Chronology'' (Archaeopress, Oxford, 2015). For a balanced review of this work – albeit in Spanish – by Dr Juan M. Tebes (2017), see the bibliography below. A clearly more negative review was published by Professor Bernd Schipper in Zeitschrift fuer die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft 128:1 (2016), 179–180.    

In ''The Sunken Kingdom: The Atlantis Mystery Solved'', James gives a hypothesis for the [[location hypotheses of Atlantis|location]] of [[Atlantis]]. By first claiming that references to [[mythological]] [[Tartarus]] by [[Plato]] were in fact meant to identify a [[Lydia]]n king by the name of [[Tantalus]], James identifies Atlantis with a hypothetical lost temple city called Tantalis, now [[Manisa]], [[Turkey]].

'''Philippa Duke Schuyler''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|aɪ|l|ər}}; August 2, 1931 – May 9, 1967) was an American [[child prodigy]] and pianist who became famous in the 1930s and 1940s as a result of her talent, [[Multiracial|mixed-race]] parentage, and the eccentric methods employed by her mother to bring her up.

Schuyler was the daughter of [[George Schuyler|George S. Schuyler]], a prominent black essayist and journalist [[Josephine Cogdell]], a white Texan and one-time [[Sennett Bathing Beauties|Mack Sennett bathing beauty]], from a former [[slavery|slave]]-owning family. Her parents believed that intermarriage could "invigorate" both races and produce extraordinary offspring. They also advocated that mixed-race marriage could help to solve many of the [[United States]]'s social problems.

==Life==

===Childhood===
Cogdell further believed that genius could best be developed by a diet consisting exclusively of raw foods. As a result, Philippa grew up in her [[New York City]] apartment eating a diet predominantly comprising raw carrots, peas and yams and raw steak. She was given a daily ration of [[cod liver oil]] and lemon slices in place of sweets. "When we travel," Cogdell said, "Philippa and I amaze waiters. You have to argue with most waiters before they will bring you raw meat. I guess it is rather unusual to see a little girl eating a raw steak."

Recognized as a prodigy at an early age, Schuyler was reportedly able to read and write at the age of two and a half, and composed music from the age of five. At nine, she became the subject of "Evening With A Gifted Child", a profile written by [[Joseph Mitchell (writer)|Joseph Mitchell]], correspondent for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', who heard several of her early compositions and noted that she addressed both her parents by their first names.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mitchell|first1=Joseph|title=Evening With a Gifted Child|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1940/08/31/evening-with-a-gifted-child|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=The New Yorker|publisher=Conde Nast|date=31 August 1040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Schuyler began giving piano recitals and radio broadcasts while still a child and attracted significant press coverage. New York mayor [[Fiorello La Guardia]] was one of her admirers and visited her at her home on more than one occasion. By the time she reached adolescence, Schuyler was touring constantly, both in the US and overseas.

Her talent as a pianist was widely acknowledged, although many critics believed that her forte lay in playing vigorous pieces and criticized her style when tackling more nuanced works. Acclaim for her performances led to her becoming a role model for many children in the United States of the 1930s and 1940s, but Schuyler's own childhood was blighted when, during her teenage years, her parents showed her the scrapbooks they had compiled recording her life and career. The books contained numerous newspaper clippings in which both George and Josephine Schuyler commented on their beliefs and ambitions for their daughter. Realisation that she had been conceived and raised, in a sense, as an experiment, robbed the pianist of many of the illusions that had made her earlier youth a happy one.

===Later life and journalism===
In later life, Schuyler grew disillusioned with the racial and gender prejudice she encountered, particularly when performing in the United States, and much of her musical career was spent playing overseas. In her thirties she abandoned the piano to follow her father into journalism.

Schuyler's personal life was frequently unhappy. She rejected many of her parents' values, increasingly becoming a vocal feminist, and made many attempts to pass herself off as a woman of Iberian (Spanish) descent named Filipa Monterro. Although she engaged in a number of affairs, and on one occasion endured a dangerous late-term [[abortion]] after a relationship with a Ghanaian diplomat, she never married.

Philippa Schuyler and her father, [[George Schuyler]], were members of the [[John Birch Society]].&lt;ref&gt;James M. Manheim, [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3431600048.html "Philippa Schuyler"], Encyclopedia.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
In 1967 Schuyler traveled to [[Vietnam]] as a war correspondent. During a helicopter mission near [[Da Nang]] to evacuate a number of Vietnamese orphans, the helicopter crashed into the sea. While she initially survived the crash, her inability to swim caused her to drown. A court of enquiry found that the pilot had deliberately cut his motor and descended in an uncontrolled glide &amp;ndash; possibly in an attempt to give his civilian passengers an insight into the dangers of flying in a combat zone &amp;ndash; eventually losing control of the aircraft.

Her mother was profoundly affected by her daughter's death and committed suicide a few days before its second anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=11KCDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA173&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq=philippa+schuyler+mother+suicide+anniversary#v=onepage&amp;q=philippa%20schuyler%20mother%20suicide%20anniversary&amp;f=false|title=Dimensions of Black Conservatism in the United States: Made in America|last=Tate|first=G.|last2=Randolph|first2=L.|date=2002|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9780230108158|location=|pages=173|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Film rights to Schuyler's biography have been sold and it was once reported that she was to become the subject of a movie starring [[Alicia Keys]].&lt;ref&gt;"Alicia Keys picked to star in film about piano prodigy," ''[[The Post-Standard|Syracuse Post-Standard]]'', May 17, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philippa Schuyler Middle School|Philippa Schuyler Middle School for the Gifted and Talented]] in [[Bushwick, Brooklyn]], New York is dedicated to preserving the memory of the child prodigy by offering an arts-focused education to New York City children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3234">[[File:AdolpheCheruel.jpeg|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Pierre Adolphe Chéruel]]
'''Pierre Adolphe Chéruel''' (January 17, 1809 – May 1, 1891) was a French historian.

Chéruel was born at [[Rouen]] and educated at the [[École Normale Supérieure]], becoming a fellow (''[[Agrégation in France|agregé]]'') in 1830. His early studies were concerned with local history. His ''Histoire de Rouen sous la domination anglaise au XV&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle'' (1840) and ''Histoire de Rouen pendant l'époque communale, 1550–1382'' (Rouen, 1843–1844), are major productions for a time when the archives were neither catalogued nor classified, and contain useful documents previously unpublished. His theses for the degree of doctor, ''De l'administration de Louis XIV d'après les Mémoires inédits d'Olivier d'Ormesson'' and ''De Maria Stuarta et Henrico III'' (1849), led him to the study of general history. The former was expanded afterwards under the title ''Histoire de l'administration monarchique en France depuis l'avènement de Philippe-Auguste jusqu'à la mort de Louis XIV'' (1855), and in 1855 he also published his ''Dictionnaire historique des institutions, mœurs et coutumes de la France'', of which many editions have appeared.

These works may still be consulted for the 17th century, the period upon which Chéruel concentrated all his scientific activity. He edited successively the ''Journal d'Olivier Lefèvre d'Ormesson'' (1860–1862), interesting for the history of the ''[[parlement]]'' of Paris during the minority of King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]; ''Lettres du cardinal Mazarin pendant son ministère'' (6 vols, 1870–1891), continued by the vicomte Georges d'Avenel; and ''Mémoires du duc de Saint-Simon'', published for the first time according to the original manuscripts (2 editions, 1856–1858 and 1878–1881).

To [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] he devoted two critical studies, which are acute but not definitive: ''Saint-Simon considéré comme historien de Louis XIV'' (1865) and ''Notice sur la vie et sur les mémoires du duc de Saint-Simon'' (1876). The latter may be considered as an introduction to the famous ''Mémoires''. Among his later writings were the ''Histoire de la France pendant la minorité de Louis XIV'' (4 volumes, 1880) and ''Histoire de la France sous le ministère de Mazarin'' (1882–1883). These two works are valuable for abundance of facts, precision of details, and clear and intelligent arrangement, but are characterized by a slightly frigid style. In their compilation Chéruel used a fair number of unpublished documents. To the student of the second half of the 17th century in France, the works of Chéruel are a mine of information.

{{Postmodernism}}
'''Postmodern picture books''' are a specific [[genre]] of [[picture books]].  Characteristics of this unique type of book include [[Nonlinear (arts)|non-linear]] narrative forms in storybooks, books that are "aware" of themselves as books and include self-referential elements, and what is known as [[metafiction]].

A classic example of this genre is [[David Macaulay]]'s award winning ''[[Black_and_White_(book)|Black and White]]'' (1990). This book consists of four "separate" sub-plots which are related, but the reader must decide in what way the story becomes meaningful.  The inside front cover of this book, awarded the Caldecott Medal in 1990, states: "WARNING: This book appears to contain a number of stories that do not necessarily occur at the same time. But it may contain only one story. Then again, there may be four stories. Or four parts of a story. Careful inspection of both words and pictures is recommended."

Examples of postmodern picture books include David Wiesner's ''The Three Pigs'', Anthony Browne's ''Voices in the Park'', and Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith's ''The Stinky Cheese Man''. Some books have unusual pictures that don't always mesh with the traditional, linear text (that often matches the pictures). An example would be ''Bamboozled'' by David Legge.

Frank Serafini (2004) has created lesson plans that lead students to discuss how text interacts with illustrations. Three sets of texts could be discussed: books that have corresponding text and pictures, books where the illustrations enhance the texts, and books where the illustrations contradict the text (''Bamboozled'' is an example of contradictory text). Another lesson that Serafini describes that incorporates PM picture books could be having students read books that are ambiguous and allow for multiple interpretations. Student are encouraged to record their thinking in a journal called a "walking notebook". Books that are especially open to interpretation include: Browne's ''Voices in the Park'', Wiesner's ''The Three Pigs'', and David Macauley's ''Black and White''.

These books could be thought of as multi-modal texts that defy the usual, linear organization of storybooks. In postmodern, meta-fictive books, the reader is intentionally made aware of the way that the book calls attention to itself. For example, in Wiesner's ''The Three Pigs'', the main characters decide to climb outside the text; pictures depicting the pigs climbing outside the story are prominent.  In ''The Stinky Cheese Man'', Scieszka and Lane purposely use [[intertextual]] references, or references to many other well-known fables, to create tongue-in-cheek, satirical stories and spin-offs of classic fairy tales. Widely varying size fonts and pictures combine to create a post-modern picture book.

According to Anstey (2002), characteristics of postmodern picture books include:

# Non-traditional plot structure
# Using the pictures or text to position the reader to read the text in a particular way, for example, through a character's eyes or point of view.
# The reader's involvement with constructing the meaning of the text.
# [[Intertextual]] references, which requires the reader to make connections to other books or knowledge, in order to better understand the text.
# Varied design layout and a variety of styles of illustration.

Ryan &amp; Anstey (2003) suggest that post-modern picture books may allow students to increase their "self-knowledge about reading" and that students might be able to use this knowledge in strategic ways as they read. In their study, Ryan and Anstey looked at how sixth graders responded to a PM picture book, which was selected because it was open to many interpretations, titled ''The Rabbits'' by [[John Marsden (writer)|John Marsden]] and [[Shaun Tan]]. They discovered that the reading of such texts allow students to draw upon their resources as readers. The reading of such books supports a [[multiliteracies]] perspective. Accordingly, such books may be useful in allowing teachers to use texts that encourage students to draw upon their own identity and use this knowledge to read strategically.

'''''Real Bloomsbury''''' is a 2010 local oral history book by [[Nicholas Murray (biographer)|Nicholas Murray]], on the district of [[Bloomsbury]], in the  [[London Borough of Camden]]

==Synopsis==
Murray walks around the historic and fascinating square mile of the [[Bloomsbury]] area among locals, students and tourists, alone or in the company of local characters. Bloomsbury is an area 'crammed with history and with contemporary decision-making', the home of the influential left-wing [[Bloomsbury Group]] and [[Bloomsbury Publishing]] along with the [[British Museum]], [[University College London]] and the [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]]. Bloomsbury has been a home of intellectuals, agitators and also working-class and now [[British Bengali]] communities.
The book is described as 'presenting Bloomsbury as it's never been portrayed before: intimate, contemporary, exploratory and occasionally downright strange.'

==Reception==
In ''[[The Independent]]'' William Parker described the book as ' amiably informative and well-illustrated...the ideal companion to any tour' and noted 'there has always been a tradition of radical political and religious belief in Bloomsbury'&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/real-bloomsbury-by-nicholas-murray-2186137.html&lt;/ref&gt; while the book was also previewed in the ''[[Camden New Journal]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.camdennewjournal.com/news/2011/jan/real-bloomsbury-new-book-promises-provide-glimpse-%E2%80%9Creal-bloomsbury%E2%80%9D-launched-week-quee&lt;/ref&gt; and was listed as the best book about London of 2010&lt;ref&gt;http://www.welovethisbook.com/news/ten-best-books-about-london&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Harvard evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] (1961)&lt;ref name="Mayr1961"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayr|first1=E|title=Cause and effect in biology|journal=Science|date=1961|volume=134|pages=1501-1506|bibcode=1961Sci...134.1501M|doi=10.1126/science.134.3489.1501}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that there are two fundamentally different types of causation in biology, [[Proximate and ultimate causation|‘ultimate’ and ‘proximate’]]. Ultimate causes (e.g. [[natural selection]]) were seen as (i) providing historical accounts for the existence of an organism’s features, and (ii) explaining the function or ‘goal-directedness’ of living beings. In contrast, proximate causes (e.g. [[physiology]]) were seen as explaining how biological systems work. According to Mayr, the evolutionary sciences study ultimate causes and the rest of biology studies proximate causes. In some of his works, Mayr considered these domains autonomous:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The clarification of the biochemical mechanism by which the genetic program is translated into the phenotype tells us absolutely nothing about the steps by which natural selection has built up the particular genetic program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayr, 1980&lt;ref name="Mayr1980"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayr|first1=E|editor1-last=Mayr|editor1-first=E|editor2-last=Provine|editor2-first=WB|title=The Evolutionary Synthesis|date=1980|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, USA|pages=1-48|chapter=Some thoughts on the history of the evolutionary synthesis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There has been widespread acceptance of the proximate-ultimate [[dichotomy]] within the evolutionary sciences. However, many biologists, psychologists and philosophers have taken issue with Mayr’s corollary that the [[Proximate and ultimate causation|proximate-ultimate distinction]] implies that development is irrelevant to evolution. For instance, evolutionary biologist Mary Jane West-Eberhard writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The proximate-ultimate distinction has given rise to a new confusion, namely, a belief that proximate causes of phenotypic variation have nothing to do with ultimate, evolutionary explanation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West-Eberhard, 2003&lt;ref name="West-Eberhard2003" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mayr’s position implied a unidirectional or linear conception of causation for both development and evolution: [[genotypes]] cause [[phenotypes]] (proximate causation), whilst through natural selection, changes in [[Environment (biophysical)|environments]] cause changes in [[organisms]] (ultimate causation). Reciprocal causation was proposed as an alternative to this linear characterization.&lt;ref name="Oyama2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2013b" /&gt; (see also &lt;ref name="West-Eberhard2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Waddington1957"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waddington|first1=CH|title=The Strategy of the Genes|date=1957|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dewsbury1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dewsbury|first1=D|title=The proximate and the ultimate: past, present, and future|journal=Behav Process|date=1999|volume=46|pages=189-199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thierry2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thierry|first1=B|title=Integrating proximate and ultimate causation: just one more go!|journal=Curr Sci|date=2005|volume=89|pages=1180-1183}}&lt;/ref&gt;) It emphasizes how causation cycles through biological systems recursively, allowing proximate causes to feed back and thereby feature in ultimate explanations. 

==Reciprocal causation in evolutionary biology==
Reciprocal causation features in several explanations within contemporary [[evolutionary biology]], including [[sexual selection]] theory, [[coevolution]], habitat selection, and [[frequency-dependent selection]]. In these examples, the source of selection on a trait coevolves with the trait itself, therefore causation is reciprocal and developmental processes potentially become relevant to evolutionary accounts. For instance, a [[Peafowl|peacock]]’s tail evolves through mating preferences in peahens, and those preferences coevolve with the male trait. The ‘ultimate explanation’ for the male trait is the prior existence of female preferences, proximately manifest in differential peahen [[mate choice]] decisions, whilst the ‘ultimate explanation’ for the peahens’ mating preferences is the prior existence of variation in the peacock’s tail associated with fitness. This example illustrates how reciprocal causation is not a rejection of the proximate-ultimate distinction itself, but instead a rejection of the implication that developmental processes should not feature in evolutionary explanations.

Reciprocal causation also applies in other domains of evolutionary biology. The [[extended evolutionary synthesis]] emphasizes how developmental events, including both the causal effects of environments on organisms (for instance, arising through developmental [[Phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]], or [[epigenetic inheritance]]) and the causal effects of organisms on environments (e.g. [[niche construction]]), can direct the course of evolution. Developmental plasticity, niche construction, extra-genetic forms of inheritance and developmental bias are recognized as playing evolutionary roles that cannot be reduced to [[natural selection]] of genetically encoded characters or strategies. Proximate causes are not autonomous from natural selection, but rather feed back to influence the rate and direction of [[adaptive evolution]]. This goes beyond the recognition that [[Ontogeny|ontogenetic processes]] can impose constraints on the action of selection, or that proximate and ultimate processes interact. Rather, developmental processes are also seen as a source of evolutionary novelty, initiators of evolutionary episodes, and co-directors of patterns of evolutionary change.&lt;ref name="Laland2015" /&gt;

==Contention==
Acceptance or rejection of Mayr’s proximate-ultimate distinction may lie at the centre of several major debates within contemporary biology, concerning [[Evolutionary developmental biology|evo devo (evolutionary developmental biology)]], [[niche construction]], [[cultural evolution]], human cooperation, and the [[Origin of language|evolution of language]]. According to some biologists and philosophers, these disputes share a common pattern. On one side are researchers who consider that interaction and feedback processes traditionally characterized as ‘proximate’ have explanatory value for ‘ultimate’ evolutionary questions.&lt;ref name="Oyama2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="West-Eberhard2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2013b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dewsbury1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thierry2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laland|first1=KN|last2=Uller|first2=T|last3=Feldman|first3=MW|last4=Sterelny|first4=K|last5=Müller|first5=GB|last6=Moczek|first6=A|last7=Jablonka|first7=E|last8=Odling-Smee|first8=FJ|last9=Wray|first9=GA|last10=Hoekstra|first10=HE|last11=Futuyma|first11=DJ|last12=Lenski|first12=RE|last13=Mackay|first13=TFC|last14=Schluter|first14=D|last15=Strassmann|first15=JE|title=Does evolutionary theory need a rethink?|journal=Nature|date=2014|volume=514|pages=161-164|bibcode=2014Natur.514..161L|doi=10.1038/514161a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their concern is that the proximate-ultimate distinction has discouraged consideration of the manner in which developmental processes can set the evolutionary agenda, for instance, by introducing innovations, channeling phenotypic variation, or initiating evolutionary episodes through modifying selection pressures. One the other side are researchers who largely adopt Mayr’s stance with a clean separation of proximate and ultimate causation. For the latter, a failure to respect Mayr’s dichotomy is considered a sign of confusing an evolutionary explanation with a mechanistic explanation.&lt;ref name="Dawkins2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dawkins|first1=R|title=Extended phenotype—but not too extended.

{{Hinduism}}
The [[Sangam period]] in [[Tamilakam]] (c. 500 BCE to 300 CE) was characterized by the coexistence of many religions: [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] alongside the [[ethnic religion]]s of the [[Tamil people]]. The monarchs of the time practiced religious tolerance and openly encouraged religious discussions and invited teachers of every sect to the public halls to preach their doctrines.{{sfn|Kanakasabhai|1904|p=233}}

==Tamil religions==
Tamil religions denotes the religious traditions and practices of Tamil-speaking people. The Tamils are native to modern state of India known as [[Tamil Nadu]] and the northern and eastern part of [[Sri Lanka]]. Tamils lives also outside their native boundaries due to migration such as [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Indonesia]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[Great Britain]], [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Réunion]], [[Myanmar]], [[Mauritius]] and in countries in [[Europe]]. Many emigrant Tamils retain elements of a cultural, linguistic, and religious tradition that predates the Christian era.

===Early Tamil religion===
A Neolithic cattle-herding culture existed in [[South India]] several millennia prior to the Christian era. By the first century, a relatively well-developed civilization had emerged. It is described in some detail in Tamil texts such as the [[Tholkappiyam]] (third BCE) and by the Sankam poets—an "academy" of poets who wrote in the first two centuries of the Common Era.

Ancient Tamil grammatical works [[Tholkappiyam]], the ten anthologies [[Pathuppāṭṭu]], the eight anthologies [[Eṭṭuttokai]] sheds light on early religion of ancient Tamil people. [[Murugan]] was glorified as, ''the red god seated on the blue peacock, who is ever young and resplendent,'' as ''the favored god of the Tamils.''&lt;ref name="Kanchan Sinha 1979"&gt;Kanchan Sinha, Kartikeya in Indian art and literature, Delhi: Sundeep Prakashan (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shiva]] was also seen as the supreme God.&lt;ref name="Kanchan Sinha 1979"/&gt; Early iconography of [[Murugan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahadevan|first=Iravatham|title=A Note on the Muruku Sign of the Indus Script in light of the Mayiladuthurai Stone Axe Discovery|year=2006|publisher=harappa.com|url=http://www.harappa.com/arrow/stone_celt_indus_signs.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904034700/http://www.harappa.com/arrow/stone_celt_indus_signs.html|archivedate=2006-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shiva]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of India: A Historical Survey| author = Ranbir Vohra| publisher = M.E.

Simoons| year = 1998| page = 363}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sangam landscape]] was classified into five categories, ''thinais'', based on the mood, the season and the land. [[Tolkappiyam]], mentions that each of these ''thinai'' had an associated deity such [[Murugan]] in ''Kurinji''-the hills, [[Thirumal]] in ''Mullai''-the forests, [[Kotravai|Kaali]] in ''Pālai''-the deserts, [[Indra]] in ''Marutham''-the plains and [[Varuna]] in ''Neithal''-the coasts and the seas. Other gods mentioned were [[Krishna]] and [[Balaram]] who were all assimilated into Sangam religion over time. Dravidian influence on early Vedic religion is evident, many of these features are already present in the oldest known [[Indo-Aryan language]], the language of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' (c. 1500 BCE), which also includes over a dozen words borrowed to [[Dravidian languages]].{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=6}} This represents an early religious and cultural fusion{{sfn|Lockard|2007|p=50}}{{refn|name=Lockard|Lockard: "The encounters that resulted from Aryan migration brought together several very different peoples and cultures, reconfiguring Indian society. Over many centuries a fusion of [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Aryan]] and [[Tamil people]] occurred, a complex process that historians have labeled the Indo-Aryan synthesis."{{sfn|Lockard|2007|p=50}} Lockard: "Hinduism can be seen historically as a synthesis of Aryan beliefs with Harappan and other Tamil traditions that developed over many centuries."{{sfn|Lockard|2007|p=52}}}} or synthesis{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2007|p=12}} between ancient Tamils and Indo-Aryans, which became more evident over time with sacred iconography, flora and fauna that went on to influence Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.{{sfn|Tiwari|2002|p=v}}{{sfn|Lockard|2007|p=52}}{{sfn|Zimmer|1951|p=218-219}}{{sfn|Larson|1995|p=81}}

The cult of the mother goddess is treated as an indication of a society which venerated femininity. This mother goddess was conceived as a virgin, one who has given birth to all and one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thiruchandran|first=Selvy|title=Ideology, caste, class, and gender|year=1997|publisher=Vikas Pub. House}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temples of the Sangam days, mainly of Madurai, seem to have had priestesses to the deity, which also appear predominantly a goddess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manickam|first=Valliappa Subramaniam|title=A glimpse of Tamilology|year=1968|publisher=Academy of Tamil Scholars of Tamil Nadu|pages=75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bIQOAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=sangam+priestess&amp;dq=sangam+priestess}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Sangam literature, there is an elaborate description of the rites performed by the Kurava priestess in the shrine Palamutircholai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lal|first=Mohan|title=The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature (Volume Five (Sasay To Zorgot), Volume 5|year=2006|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=8126012218|pages=4396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Veriyattam===
"Veriyattam" refers to [[spirit possession]] of women, who took part in priestly functions. Under the influence of the god, women sang and danced, but also read the dim past, predicted the future, diagnosed diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Iyengar|first=Srinivasa|title=History of the Tamils: from the earliest times to 600 A.D.|year=1929|publisher=Asian Educational Services|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty two poets of the Sangam age in as many as 40 poems portray Veriyatal. Velan is a reporter and prophet endowed with supernatural powers. Veriyatal had been performed by men as well as women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=T.K. |last=Venkatasubramanian|title=Music as History in TamilNadu|year=2010|publisher=Primus Books|isbn=9380607067|pages=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pzurjfF3AE4C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=Twenty+two+poets+of+the+Sangam+age+in+as+many+as#v=onepage&amp;q=Twenty%20two%20poets%20of%20the%20Sangam%20age%20in%20as%20many%20as&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nadukkal===
Among the early Tamils the practice of erecting [[hero stone]]s (''nadukkal'') had appeared, and it continued for quite a long time after the Sangam age, down to about 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shashi|first=S. S.|title=Encyclopaedia Indica: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh: Volume 100|year=1996|publisher=Anmol Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was customary for people who sought victory in war to worship these hero stones to bless them with victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Subramanium|first=N.|title=Śaṅgam polity: the administration and social life of the Śaṅgam Tamils|year=1980|publisher=Ennes Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theyyam===

[[Theyyam]] is a ritual shaman dance popular in [[Kerala]] and parts of Tamil Nadu and [[Karnataka]]. Theyyam migrates into the artist who has assumed the spirit and it is a belief that the god or goddess comes in the midst of fathering through the medium of possessed dancer. The dancer throws rice on the audience and distributes turmeric powder as symbols of blessing. Theyyam incorporates dance, mime and music and enshrines the rudiments of ancient tribal cultures which attached great importance to the worship of heroes and the spirits of ancestors,  is a socio-religious ceremony. There are over 400 Theyyams performed, the most spectacular ones are those of Raktha Chamundi, Kari Chamundi, Muchilottu Bhagavathi, Wayanadu Kulaven, Gulikan and Pottan. These are performed in front of shrines, sans stage or curtains.

The early character of Tamil religion was celebrative. It embodied an aura of sacral immanence, sensing the sacred in the vegetation, fertility, and color of the land. The summum bonum of the religious experience was expressed in terms of possession by the god, or ecstasy. Into this milieu there immigrated a sobering influence—a growing number of Jain and Buddhist communities and an increasing influx of northerners.

The layout of villages can be assumed to be standard across most villages. An Amman (mother goddess) is at the centre of the villages while a male [[Village deities of Tamil Nadu|guardian deity]] ({{indic|lang=ta|indic= காவல் கடவுள்|trans=kāval kaṭavuḷ}}) has a shrine at the village borders. Nowadays, Amman can be either worshipped alone or as a part of the Vedic pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hastings|first=James|title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, Part 14|year=2003|publisher=Kessinger Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divinity of kings==

===Pre-Sangam and Sangam age===
Throughout Tamil Nadu, a king was considered to be divine by nature and possessed religious significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harman|first=William P.|title=The sacred marriage of a Hindu goddess|year=1992|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The King was 'the representative of God on earth' and lived in a ''koyil'', which means the "residence of God". The Modern Tamil word for temple is [[koil]] ({{lang-ta|கோயில்}}). Titular worship was also given to Kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anand|first=Mulk Raj|title=Splendours of Tamil Nadu |year=1980|publisher=Marg Publications|url=https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;noj=1&amp;prmdo=1&amp;biw=1067&amp;bih=565&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=The+king+is+%27the+representative+of+God+on+earth%27+and+lives+in+a+palace+called+%27+Koyil%27%2C+which+means+the+residence+of+God.+The+ritual+worship+of+God&amp;oq=The+king+is+%27the+representative+of+God+on+earth%27+and+lives+in+a+palace+called+%27+Kovil%27%2C+which+means+the+residence+of+God.+The+ritual+worship+of+God&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_l=serp.3...0.0.0.8227.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0...0.0.DdIt9d1ZNjo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chopra|first=Pran Nath|title=History of South India|year=1979|publisher=S.

Words meaning 'King', like ''kō'' ({{lang-ta|கோ}} "King"), ''iṟai'' ({{lang|ta|இறை}} "Emperor") and ''āṇḍavan'' ({{lang|ta|ஆண்டவன்}} "Conqueror") now primarily refer to Gods.

===Middle ages===
At the birth of [[Raja Raja Chola I]], the Thiruvalangadu inscription states, "Having noticed by the marks (on his body) that Arulmozhi was the very [[Thirumal]], the protector of the three worlds, descended on earth..." During the [[Bhakti movement]], poets often compared gods to kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hopkins|first=Steven|title=Singing the body of God: the hymns of Vedāntadeśika in their South Indian tradition|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==

[[File:Subrahmanya Temple, Saluvanakuppam front view.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Murugan]] temple at Salavanakuppam near [[Mahabalipuram]]]]

The brick temple excavated in 2005&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/2005/09/21/stories/2005092104692000.htm&lt;/ref&gt; dates to the [[Sangam period]] and is believed to be the oldest Hindu temple to be found in Tamil Nadu. The temple faces north, unlike most Hindu temples which face either east or west and is believed to have been constructed even before ''shilpa shastras'' were written

[[File:Skanda, from Kannuaj.jpg|thumbnail|upright=0.9|Sculpture of the god Murugan]]
During the Sangam period, [[Shiva]], [[Murugan]], [[Thirumal]] and Kotravai were some of the popular [[deity|deities]]. The poetic division of the landscape into [[Sangam landscape#Poetic Attributes of the Landscapes|five regions]] also associated each region with its own patron deity.{{sfn|Subrahmanian|1972|p=381}}
The people of the pastoral lands or the [[Sangam landscape#Mullai .E2.80.93 Forests|Mullai]] regions worshipped [[Thirumal]]. The [[Sangam landscape#Marutham .E2.80.93 Cropland|Marutham]] people worshipped [[Indra]] or ''Ventan'', while the [[Sangam landscape#Neithal .E2.80.93 Seashore|Neithal]] people considered [[Varuna]]n or ''Katalon'' to be their patron deity and the [[Sangam landscape#Paalai .E2.80.93 Wastelands|Palai]] people worshipped [[Korravai]] or [[Kali]]. Other popular deities of this age were [[Kama]] the god of love, [[Surya]] the sun, [[Chandra]] the moon and [[Yama]] the god of death. The [[Brahmin]]s of the Tamil country attached great importance to the performance of Vedic sacrifices. Priests learned in the Vedic rites typically performed them under the patronage of the kings.{{sfn|Kanakasabhai|1904|p=231}}

The temples of the Sangam age were built out of perishable materials such as plaster, timber and brick, which is why little trace of them is found today.{{sfn|Subrahmanian|1972|p=382}} The only public structures of any historical importance belonging to this age that have survived to this day are the rock-beds hewn out of natural rock formation, that were made for the ascetics. The ''[[Silappatikaram]]'' and the Sangam poems such as ''[[Kaliththokai]]'', ''[[Mullaippāṭṭu]]'' and ''[[Purananuru]]'' mention several kinds of temples such as the ''Puranilaikkottam'' or the temple at the outskirts of a city, the ''Netunilaikkottam'' or the tall temple, the ''Palkunrakkottam'' the temple on top of a hill, the ''Ilavantikaippalli'' or the temple with a garden and bathing ghat, the ''Elunilaimatam'' or a seven storeyed temple, the ''Katavutkatinakar'' or the temple city.{{sfn|Gopalakrishnan|2005|p=19}}

Some of the popular festivals of this age were [[Karthikai Deepam|Karthigaideepam]], Tiruvonam, Kaman vizha and Indira vizha. Karthigaideepam was otherwise known as Peruvizha and was celebrated in the Tamil month of Karthigai every year. The Kaaman vizha was held in the spring and during this festival, men and women dressed up well and participated in dancing. Indravizha included the performance of Vedic sacrifices, prayers to various gods, musical recitals and dancing.{{sfn|Balambal|1998|p=6}}

==Jainism==
{{Main article|Tamil Jain}}
The exact origins of Jainism in Tamil Nadu is unclear. However, Jains flourished in Tamil Nadu at least as early as the [[Sangam period]]. Tamil Jain tradition places their origins are much earlier. Some scholars believe that the author of the oldest extant work of literature in Tamil (3rd century BCE), [[Tolkāppiyam]], was a Jain.&lt;ref name=Encyclopaedia&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Singh  | first = Narendra   | title = Encyclopaedia of Jainism  | publisher = Anmol Publications  | year = 2001  | pages = 3144  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pHZwgrLlOkUC&amp;dq  | isbn = 978-81-261-0691-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions have been found in Tamil Nadu that date from the 2nd century BCE. They are regarded to be associated with Jain monks and lay devotees.&lt;ref&gt;Early Tamil epigraphy from the earliest times to the sixth century A.D. Iravatham Mahadevan, Harvard University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jainsamaj.org/rpg_site/literature2.php?id=595&amp;cat=42 Recent Discoveries of Jaina Cave Inscriptions in Tamilnadu by Iravatham Mahadevan&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars consider the [[Tirukkural]] by [[Valluvar]] to be the work by a Jain.&lt;ref&gt;Tirukkural, Vol. 1,  S.M. Diaz, Ramanatha Adigalar Foundation, 2000,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tiruvalluvar and his Tirukkural, Bharatiya Jnanapith, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Kural, P. S. Sundaram, Penguin Classics, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; It emphatically supports vegetarianism (Chapter 26) and states that giving up animal sacrifice is worth more than a thousand offerings in fire (verse 259).

[[Silappatikaram]], a major work in Tamil literature, was written by a Camaṇa, [[Ilango Adigal]]. It describes the historical events of its time and also of the then-prevailing religions, Jainism, Buddhism and [[Shaivism]]. The main characters of this work, [[Kannagi]] and [[Kovalan]], who have a divine status among Tamils, were Jains.

According to [[George L. Hart]], the legend of the [[Tamil Sangams]] or "literary assemblies: was based on the Jain ''sangham'' at [[Madurai]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a permanent Jaina assembly called a Sangha established about 604 CE in Maturai. It seems likely that this assembly was the model upon which tradition fabricated the cangkam legend."&lt;ref&gt;The Milieu of the Ancient Tamil Poems, Prof. George Hart&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jainism began to decline around the 8th century, with many Tamil kings embracing Hindu religions, especially [[Shaivism]]. Still, the [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukya]], [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava]] and [[Pandya Dynasty|Pandya]] dynasties embraced Jainism.

==Buddhism==
{{Main article|Tamil Buddhism}}
[[File:Buddha-Footprint.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.6|Footprint of Buddha engraved on stone, c. 1st century CE]]

The [[Buddhist]]s worshiped the impressions of [[Buddha]]’s feet engraved on stone and platforms made of stone that represented his seat. The pious Buddhist walked round them, with his right side towards them and bowed his head as a token of reverence.{{sfn|Kanakasabhai|1904|p=232}} The [[Cilapatikaram|Silapatikaram]] mentions that the [[monk]]s worshipped Buddha by praising him as the wise, holy and virtuous teacher who adhered to his vows strictly, as the one who subdued anger and all evil passions and as the refuge of all mankind. [[Manimekalai]] is a sequel to the Silapathikaram, which tellst the story of [[Buddhism]] of the daughter of [[Kovalan]] and [[Madhavi (Silappatikaram)|Madhavi]].

In the Buddhist [[Viharas]] or monasteries, learned monks preached their sermons, seated in a place which was entirely concealed from the view of the audience. The Buddhists did not observe the distinctions of caste and invited all ranks to assemble on a footing of equality. Self-control, wisdom and charity were among the virtues preached and practiced by the monks, who were numerous in the ancient Tamil country.{{sfn|Kanakasabhai|1904|p=233}}

==Judaism==

The traditional account is that traders from [[Judea]] arrived in the city of [[Cochin]], Kerala in 562 BCE, and that more Jews came as exiles from Israel in the year 70 CE after the destruction of the [[Second Temple]].&lt;ref name="TheShengold"&gt;P. 125 ''The Shengold Jewish Encyclopedia'' By Mordecai Schreiber&lt;/ref&gt; The distinct Jewish community was called [[Anjuvannam]]. The still-functioning [[Paradesi Synagogue|synagogue in Mattancherry]] belongs to the [[Paradesi Jews]], the descendants of [[Sephardim]] that were expelled from Spain in [[Spanish Inquisition|1492]].&lt;ref name="TheShengold" /&gt;

==Philosophies of religion==

===Secularism===
The secular identity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Tamil Literature: Introductory articles|year=1990|publisher=Institute of Asian Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of the [[Sangam literature]] is often celebrated to represent the tolerance among [[Tamil people]]. Es Vaiyāpurip Piḷḷai, concludes in his ''History of Tamil language and literature: beginning to 1000 A. D.'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Piḷḷai|first=Es Vaiyāpurip|title=History of Tamil language and literature: beginning to 1000 A. D.|year=1956|publisher=New Century Book House}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Cquote|&lt;center&gt;Thus the Tamil land became a fertile nursery and the several religions... throve in friendly rivalry.|author= Es Vaiyāpurip Piḷḷai|source= ''History of Tamil language and literature: beginning to 1000 A. D.''&lt;center&gt;}} Most scholars agree that the lack of 'god' should not be inferred to be atheistic. The [[Tamil books of Law]], particularly the [[Tirukkural]], is considered as the [[Perennial philosophy]] of [[Tamil culture]] because of its universalisability.

===Ūzh and Vinai===
Ūzh meaning 'fate' or 'destiny'  and vinai meaning 'works' concerns the ancient [[Tamil people|Tamil]] belief of differentiating what man can do and what is destined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of Tamil studies, Issues 31–32|year=1987|publisher=International Association of Tamil Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kaṭavuḷ and Iyavuḷ===
Sangam [[Tamil people]] understood two distinct characteristics of Godhood. [[Transcendence (religion)|God who is beyond all]] ({{indic|lang=ta|indic=கடவுள்|trans=Kaṭavuḷ}}) and the [[Primum movens|God who sets things in motion]] ({{indic|lang=ta|indic=இயவுள்|trans=Iyavuḷ}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singam|first=S.

The '''Sfire''' or '''Sefire steles''' are three 8th-century BCE basalt ''[[stelae]]'' containing [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] inscriptions discovered at [[Al-Safirah]] ("Sfire") near [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]].&lt;ref name=Aramaic&gt;{{cite web|title=Aramaic |publisher=Anchor Bible Dictionary |pages=173–78 |author=S. A. Kaufman |url=http://www.nelc.ucla.edu/Faculty/Schniedewind_files/NWSemitic/Aramaic_ABD.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051104215025/http://www.nelc.ucla.edu/Faculty/Schniedewind_files/NWSemitic/Aramaic_ABD.pdf |archivedate=November 4, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Sefire treaty inscriptions''' are the three inscriptions on the steles.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Fitzmyer The Aramaic inscriptions of Sefîre 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identification of the treaty kings ==
Two treaties conducted between minor kings from the Kingdom of [[Arpad (Syria)|Arpad]] inscribed on the stelae are often cited as evidence of the [[Aramaean]] tradition of treaty-making.&lt;ref name=Healy&gt;{{cite web|title=''Ancient Aramaic Culture and the Bible'' |author=John F. Healy |publisher=[[University of Durham]] |date=13 June 1987 |accessdate=2007-10-12 |url=http://www.urhoy.info/culture.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828012607/http://www.urhoy.info/culture.pdf |archivedate=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sefire inscriptions are of interest to those studying beliefs and practices in ancient [[Syria]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and the text is considered notable for constituting "the best extrabiblical source for [[Semitic people|West Semitic]] traditions of covenantal blessings and curses."&lt;ref name=Aramaic/&gt;

They tell of ''"The treaty of King Bar-ga'yah of K[a]t[a]k, with Mati'el son of Attarsamak, king of Arpad."'' Some have identified this as the treaty of "Ashurnerari V" ([[Adad-nirari III]] or his son [[Tiglath-pileser III]]?) of Assyria and [[Matiilu]] (unknown) of [[Arpad (Syria)|Arpad]] (probably modern [[Tel Rifaat]], Syria).&lt;ref&gt;Steven Elliott Grosby ''Biblical ideas of nationality: ancient and modern''  2002 p126 "Thus, they think that the Sefire treaty is the Aramaic version of the treaty of approximately 754 bc between Ashurnerari V and Matîoil of Arpad. But why the use of KTK as a pseudonym for Assyria? If, in fact, Dupont-Sommer's (1958) ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description of the inscriptions ==

=== Sefire I ===
This is a basalt slab broken in two horizontally. The first two steles each have three faces bearing writing.

=== Sefire II ===
As with Sefire I stele Sefire II had three faces bearing writing. While most of the text of Sefire II A and B permit coherent translation only with comparison with Sefire I and III, the concluding portion of Sefire II A and B is quite clear.&lt;ref&gt;James Bennett Pritchard  The ancient Near East: supplementary texts and pictures   1969 "In Sfire II A 9, lions seem to be mentioned in the same context, offering a good parallel to ... (Sfire II C) (While most of the preserved text of Sfire II A and B permits a coherent translation only where the missing links can be supplied on the basis of Sfire I and III, the concluding portion is quite clear.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holger Gzella, M. L. Folmer  Aramaic in its historical and linguistic setting 2008 p153 "personal names: Sfire II, C, 14; place names: Zkr B:10, 11 and perhaps B 4; Sfire II, C, 5; "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. L. Folmer The Aramaic language in the [[Achaemenid period]] 1995 p427 "6,8 In combination with the infinitive (hbzthm Sfire ii B 7)"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sefire III===
Nine fragments of the reverse of a broad slab.

==Overview==
The inscriptions record two treaties that "list curses and magical rites which take effect if the treaty is violated."&lt;ref name=Jeffers&gt;{{cite book|title=Magic and Divination in Ancient Palestine and Syria|author=Ann Jeffers|year=1996|publisher=BRILL|page=18|isbn=90-04-10513-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One is a treaty between two minor kings, Barga'yah and Matti'el, who hailed from the southwestern periphery of the [[Assyrian empire]].&lt;ref name=Faraone&gt;{{cite journal|title=Molten Wax, Spilt Wine and Mutilated Animals: Sympathetic Magic in near Eastern and Early Greek Oath Ceremonies|author=Christopher A.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''"....'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''As this wax is consumed by fire, thus Ma[tti'el] shall be consumed b[y fi]re.'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''As this bow and these arrows are broken, thus Inurta and [[Hadad]] (= names of local deities) shall break [the bow of Matti'el] and the bows of his nobles.'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''As a man of wax is blinded, thus Matti'el shall be blinded.'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''[As] this calf is cut up, thus Matti'el and his nobles shall be cut up."'''&lt;ref name=Faraone/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This loyalty oath from the Sefire inscriptions is similar to other loyalty oaths imposed by Assyrian kings on other less powerful monarchs in the [[Levant]] throughout the 8th and 7th centuries BCE.&lt;ref name=Faraone/&gt;

The inscriptions may, under one possible interpretation, record the names of ''[[El (deity)|El]] and [[Elyon]],'' "God, God Most High" possibly providing prima facie evidence for a distinction between the two deities first worshipped by the [[Jebusites]] in [[Jerusalem]], and then elsewhere throughout the ancient Levant.&lt;ref name=Day&gt;{{cite book|title=Yahweh and the Gods and Goddesses of Canaan|author=John Day|publisher=Continuum International|year=2000|page=20|isbn=0-8264-6830-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thought to be reflective of Assyrian or neo-Assyrian culture and similar to other documents dating from the first millennium BCE, scholars such as [[Joseph Fitzmyer]] have perceived [[Canaan]]ite influences in the text, while Dennis McCarthy has noted similarities to second millennium BCE treaties imposed by [[Hittites|Hittite]] kings on Syrian vassals.&lt;ref name=Morrow&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Sefire Treaty Stipulations and the Mesopotamian Treaty Tradition|journal=The World of the Aramaeans|author=William Morrow|editor=Paul-Eugène Dion|year=2001|publisher=Continuum International|isbn=1-84127-179-9|pages=83–84|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anna Wallis Suh''' (1900&amp;ndash;1969), the woman generally associated&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFranklin1996|Franklin, 1996]]&lt;/ref&gt; with the nickname "'''Seoul City Sue'''," was a [[Methodist]] missionary, educator, and [[North Korea]]n [[propaganda]] radio announcer to [[United States forces]] during the [[Korean War]].

Suh was born in [[Arkansas]], the sixth of six children. After her mother and father died in 1910 and 1914, she relocated to [[Oklahoma]] to join a sister's family while she completed high school. She spent her early adult years as an office clerk and Sunday school teacher. Subsequently, she studied at the [[Southeastern Oklahoma State University|Southeastern State Teachers College]], in [[Durant, Oklahoma|Durant]], and the [[Scarritt College for Christian Workers]] in [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]], graduating in 1930 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in ministry. She spent the next eight years working as a member of the American Southern Methodist Episcopal Mission in [[Korea]]. As Japanese colonial authorities continued to restrict the activities of foreign missions, Suh joined the staff of [[Shanghai American School]] (SAS) in 1938. There she met and married fellow staff member Sŏ Kyu Ch’ŏl (서규철 徐奎哲, also spelled Suh Kyoon Chul), thus losing her [[United States]] citizenship.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[#refProlog|NARA, Prolog Magazine, Summer 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt; Late in [[World War II]] she was interned by the Japanese for two years with other [[White people|White]] Europeans at a camp in suburban Shanghai. After release, she resumed work at SAS for a year, before returning to Korea with her husband in 1946.

The Suhs settled in [[Seoul]], where Suh taught at the U.S. Legation school until being fired in 1949 due to suspicion of her husband for [[left wing]] political activities. They remained or were trapped in Seoul during the Northern army's invasion of [[South Korea]] in June 1950. Suh began announcing a short English language program for North Korean "Radio Seoul" starting on or about July 18, continuing until shortly after the [[Inchon landing]] on September 15, when the Suhs were evacuated north as a part of the general withdrawal of North Korean forces. Subsequently, she continued broadcasts on Radio Pyongyang. The Suhs participated in the political [[indoctrination]] of US [[POW]]s at a camp near [[Pyongyang]] in February 1951.

[[Charles Robert Jenkins]] reported that, some time after the war, Suh was put in charge of English language publications for the [[Korean Central News Agency]]. He also wrote that he saw her in a photo for a 1962 propaganda pamphlet, and met her briefly in 1965 at a department store in Pyongyang. Jenkins stated that he was told in 1972 that Suh had been shot as a South Korean double agent in 1969.

==Early life==
[[File:Tower at Scarritt Bennett.jpg|thumb|Scarritt College]]

Suh was born Anna Wallis to Albert B. and M. Jane Wallis in 1900 in [[Lawrence County, Arkansas]]. She was the youngest of six children.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCensus1900|US Census, 1900]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Suh's parents died when she was young; her mother died some time between the 1900 and 1910 Census,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCensus1900|Ibid.]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCensus1910|US Census, 1910]]&lt;/ref&gt; and her father in October 1914.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCertDeath|Arkansas Certification of Death, #00765]]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, she relocated to [[Oklahoma]] with a sister.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMtPleasant|Mt. Pleasant News, Oct 3, 1950]]&lt;/ref&gt; Suh attended the [[Southeastern Oklahoma State University|Southeastern State Teachers College]], in Durant, Oklahoma, before transferring to the [[Scarritt College for Christian Workers]], an institution dedicated to the training of Methodist missionaries, in Nashville, Tennessee. Ann graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refScarrittCommencement|Scarritt College Commencement, 1930]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Korean mission and China==
That same year, she was selected for a mission to [[Korea]] by the [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South|Southern Methodist]] Conference.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDentonRecord|Denton Record Chronicle, March 7, 1930]]&lt;/ref&gt; There, she initially taught at a Methodist school.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPsywarrior|Psywarrior.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1930s, the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese colonial administration]] had largely banned foreigners from Christian proselytizing, and most Christian missions focused on education, medicine, and care for the indigent.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#refChristInKorea|Christianity In Korea]]&lt;/ref&gt; She may have returned to the US in 1935 to visit a sister.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refNYPassengers|New York Passenger Lists, Sept. 9, 1935]]&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1936, she was appointed to serve at the Seoul Social Evangelistic Center, and in February 1937, visited Scarritt College during a missionary furlough.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refScarrittVoice|Scarritt College Voice, Feb, 1937]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a move that may have reflected increasingly harsh Japanese measures against foreign missionaries in the late 30s,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGBGM|United Methodist Church, General Board of Global Ministries]]&lt;/ref&gt; Suh relocated to [[China]] to join the staff of the [[Shanghai American School]] (SAS) in 1938. There she met [[Sŏ Kyu Ch’ŏl]], who was hired to teach Korean and assist in school administration. She was dropped from the rolls of the missionary service and lost her United States citizenship after they married. She developed an interest in Korean politics, eventually taking up her husband's leftist views.&lt;ref name="PortlandFreeHerald"&gt;[[#refPortland|Portland Free Herald, Oct 4, 1950]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEdwards|Edwards]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLech|Lech, Raymond B., page 118]]&lt;/ref&gt; The cosmopolitan [[Shanghai International Settlement]] and [[Shanghai French Concession|French Concession]] were likely a more accepting environment for the Suhs than homogeneous 1940s Korea would later prove to be, as suggested by the number of other Caucasian women on staff married to Asian men.&lt;ref name="Mills"&gt;[[#refMills|Mills]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refChoi|Choi]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, she visited [[San Francisco]] in an unsuccessful attempt to secure a US passport for her husband.&lt;ref name="Coshocton"&gt;[[#refCoshocton|Coshocton Tribute, August 30, 1950]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sino-Japanese War==

Americans in Shanghai began to depart that same year, slowly as tensions rose in the environs of the city, then en masse shortly before the US and Japan officially went to war. SAS remained open until February 1943,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Shanghai International Settlement]]&lt;/ref&gt; when the remaining foreign staff were forced into the [[Zhabei District|Chapei]] Civilian Relocation Center, a short distance away in the northern suburbs.&lt;ref name="Mills" /&gt; This [[internment camp]], one of several in and around Shanghai, occupied a three-story dormitory on the grounds of Great China University (now [[East China Normal University]]), most of which was damaged or destroyed during the 1937 [[Battle of Shanghai]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCaptives|Captives of Empire]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether as a part of the remaining school staff or on her own, Suh also entered the Chapei center at this time, while her husband may have remained free as a colonial subject of Japan. During the internment, the SAS staff and parents took advantage of the school's books that had followed them to organize classes for the children. Supplies with which to maintain the internees grew short towards the end of the war, and a number of women married to citizens of Axis powers or neutral countries were released in late 1944. It is possible that Suh was among these.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCaptives|Ibid]]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1943, a missionary family, R.W. and M.F. Howes, along with their two girls, were interned in Chapei—the Japanese official name was Chapei Civil Assembly Center. Most of the people were Canadian or American, with some central European citizens. And later some British citizens were added from a camp further west up the Yangtze which the Japanese closed. 

Suh was released from Chapei camp along with other Americans and Canadians in September 1943 was not repatriated. The others left Shanghai in September 1943 on the Japanese ship Teia Maru, which traveled to Goa, India, and were exchanged for Japanese from America which had traveled on the Swedish ship ''The Griipsholm.''  

In December 1943, she was staying at Shanghai General Hospital, originally a Catholic hospital, but during the war under Japanese control though still staffed by Catholic sisters. 

With Suh's formal release from detention at the end of World War II,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refArchives|National Archives, World II Prisoners of War Data File]]&lt;/ref&gt; she joined the staff of the reconstituted SAS for the 1945-46 school year.&lt;ref name="Mills"/&gt;

==Korean War==
Unable to continue earning a sufficient living in post-war Shanghai,&lt;ref name="Coshocton"/&gt; she and her husband returned to liberated Korea, where she tutored children at the US Diplomatic Mission School in [[Seoul]]. Her employment was terminated after her husband was investigated for left wing activities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refNYT|New York Times, Aug 28, 1950]]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, [[North Korea]] invaded the South in June 1950.

The [[Korean People's Army]] occupied Seoul three days after the start of hostilities. The speed of the advance caught the majority of residents by surprise and unprepared to evacuate, in part due to ROK radio propaganda rather at odds with the actual situation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGWU|National Security Archive at George Washington University]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refKoreanWarStarts|Eyewitness: Korean War Starts]]&lt;/ref&gt; Suh and her husband remained as well, perhaps because he was unwilling to abandon a school for indigent boys that he administered. During a July 10 meeting in Seoul that included 48 to 60 members of the ROK National Assembly, the couple pledged their loyalty to the North Korean regime.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEdwards|Edwards, page 79]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refKoreanWar1950|Eyewitness: 1950: War of Unification]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Dr. Lee Soo, an English instructor from [[Seoul National University|Seoul University]], Suh began announcing for North Korean "Radio Seoul" from the [[Korean Broadcasting System]]'s HLKA studios, with daily programs from 09:30 to 22:15 local time,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCorpusChristi|Corpus Christi Times, September 12, 1950]]&lt;/ref&gt; first heard as early as July 18. The Suhs had been relocated to a temporary home near the station.&lt;ref name="PortlandFreeHerald"/&gt; Suh's defenders gave the dull tone of her broadcasts as proof that she was being forced to make them.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refTimeMag|Time Magazine, September 18, 1950]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her initial scripts suggested that American soldiers return to their corner ice cream stands, criticized the USAF bombing campaign, and reported names recovered from the dog tags of dead American soldiers to a background of soft music.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refYuma|Yuma Daily Sun, 10 August 1950]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMartin|Martin, page 76-77]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[G.I. (military)|GI]]s gave her various nicknames, including "Rice Ball-" or "Rice Bowl Maggie", "Rice Ball Kate", and "Seoul City Sue".&lt;ref&gt;[[#refExecutive|Senate Permanent Subcommittee: Executive Sessions]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAtrocities|Senate Permanent Subcommittee: Korean War Atrocities]]&lt;/ref&gt; The latter name stuck, likely derived from "Sioux City Sue",&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSiouxCity|Song: Sioux City Sue]]&lt;/ref&gt; the title of a song initially made popular by [[Zeke Manners]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#refZeke|Obituary, Zeke Manners]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMP3|Sample: Sioux City Sue]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refNYT2|New York Times, 9 August 1950]]&lt;/ref&gt; from 1946. Through the rest of the summer of 1950, her reports would announce the names of recently captured US airmen, marines, and soldiers,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWosser|Wosser, Joseph Lloyd, Lt. (USMC)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFromKorea|From Korea to Kosovo]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#ref1stMAW|1st MAW History]]&lt;/ref&gt; threaten new units arriving in country,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refStocks|Stocks, Floyd P.]]&lt;/ref&gt; welcome warships by name as they arrived on station,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSchratz|Schratz, Paul R.]]&lt;/ref&gt; or taunt African-American soldiers regarding their limited civil rights at home.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLipsitz|Lipsitz, George]]&lt;/ref&gt; Her monotone on-air delivery and the lack of popular music programming evidently left Ann's broadcasts less enjoyable for her intended audience than German and Japanese English-language radio shows during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCorpusChristi|Corpus Christi Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio Seoul went off the air at the start of a "Sue" program during an August 13 air strike on communications and transportation facilities in the city, as a [[A-26 Invader|B-26]] bomber dropped 200&amp;nbsp;lbs fragmentation bombs adjacent to the transmitter. The station came back on the air a week or two later.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refNYT3|New York Times, Aug 14, 1950]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Suhs were evacuated north by truck after the Inchon landings, a few days before US forces entered the city.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refNYT4|New York Times, Oct 04, 1950]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refStars|The Stars &amp; Stripes, October 5, 1950]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refChillicothe|Chillicothe Constitution Tribute, March 8, 1952]]&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. &amp; Mrs. Suh joined the staff of Radio Pyongyang, where she continued English-language broadcasts to UN forces. They were temporarily reassigned to indoctrinate UN POWs at Camp 12 near Pyongyang in February 1951, after which the POWs were directed to continue indoctrinating each other, with Korean supervision.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLech|Lech, page 118-121]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Fellow defector [[Charles Robert Jenkins]] made several claims about Suh in his book ''The Reluctant Communist'' that have not been independently verified. He reported that, some time after the war, she was put in charge of English language publications for the [[Korean Central News Agency]]. He wrote that he saw her in a photo for a 1962 propaganda pamphlet called "I Am A Lucky Boy", dining with [[Larry Allen Abshier]], a US Army deserter and defector. Jenkins reported meeting her briefly in 1965 at the "foreigners only" section of the No. 2 Department Store in [[Pyongyang]]. Jenkins also stated that he was told in 1972 that Suh had been shot as a South Korean double agent in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJenkins|Charles Robert Jenkins, page 115-116]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nationality==
Based on US law through the 1930s, citizenship for a married woman was almost exclusively based on that of her husband, particularly if they lived in his native land. Therefore, Suh probably lost her US citizenship when she married Suh Kyoon Chul in China.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Suh Kyoon Chul, as well as all other native residents of Korea and Taiwan, were nationals of the Empire of Japan, which recognized itself as a multi-ethnic state.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLie|John Lie, Multiethnic Japan]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSchaeffer|Schaeffer]]&lt;/ref&gt; Suh may not have recognized her situation until the 1939 visit to San Francisco to secure a US passport for her husband. In addition to her status as a Japanese national, the US had almost completely frozen Asian immigration with the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], which would likely have precluded his obtaining a passport.

Arbitrary application of Japanese and US law may have dogged Suh over the following years. When the Japanese interned most ethnic Europeans within the Empire during World War II, it is not clear whether she was forced into the Chapei Relocation Center, or entered it willingly, since she was not a foreign national. Later, during the US military occupation of southern Korea, an attempt was made to restore her US citizenship, an effort which fell through for unknown reasons.&lt;ref name="PortlandFreeHerald"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coshocton"/&gt; It is possible that she became a national of [[South Korea]] as the wife of Mr. Suh. The Korean nationality that became reestablished between the end of World War II and the formal independence of the ROK in 1948 didn't distinguish between spouses.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refUNHCR|UNHCR: Japan - Koreans]]&lt;/ref&gt; Although US forces sought her out after retaking Seoul in September, 1950, officials recognized that it was unlikely that Mrs. Suh could be charged with treason by the US.&lt;ref name="PortlandFreeHerald"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coshocton"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
During the Korean War, USAF pilots improvised a spoof of the Zeke Manner's hit "Sioux City Sue" using the most popular nickname for Mrs. Suh.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFighter|Fighter Pilot Songs]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In several episodes of the TV series ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' a North Korean announcer calling herself "Seoul City Sue" is heard on the radio (rebroadcast over the camp's PA). In "[[List of M*A*S*H episodes (Season 3)#Bombed|Bombed]]" she tells the GIs that their wives and girlfriends are being unfaithful and they would have more prosperous careers as civilians. In "[[List of M*A*S*H episodes (Season 5)#38 Across|38 Across]]" she accuses [[Hawkeye Pierce]] of [[war crimes]] for performing an experimental technique to successfully save the life of a North Korean [[Prisoner of war|POW]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMASH|David Scott Diffrient, pg 121]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Julius von Ficker.jpg|thumb|Julius Ficker]]

The '''Sybel-Ficker controversy''' ({{lang-de|Sybel-Ficker-Streit}}) is the name given to a dispute in the second half of the 19th century between the historians [[Heinrich von Sybel]] (1817–1895) and [[Julius von Ficker]] (1826–1902). It involved a discussion concerning relations between Rome (that is, the [[Holy See|papal see]]) and the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which also had an important bearing on the [[Austria–Prussia rivalry]]—whether Austria was to be part of a federal Germany, or whether Germany would continue without Austria (as a [[Lesser Germany]]).

Heinrich von Sybel fired the first shot in the dispute in an 1859 lecture, in which he condemned the medieval politics of the German Empire as "unnational". Julius Ficker countered in 1861 in lectures at the [[University of Innsbruck]], in which he justified the emperors' national politics, which he also presented as universal. While Sybel's was a "kleindeutsch-norddeutsch-protestantische" ([[Kleindeutschland|Little German]]-North German-Protestant) concept of history,&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Schneider, 1940, p. 22. [[:de:Friedrich Schneider (Historiker)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ficker promoted a [[Greater Germany]] which would include Austria.

==Background==
The controversy's roots are in the [[Austria–Prussia rivalry]] which had grown more intense in the 18th century. Prussia, under Frederick the Great, had emerged as a major European power, and Sybel finds cause for the dispute in early 19th-century Prussian historiography. It continues with the [[founding of the German Empire]] under Bismarck in 1871, which had become possible with the Prussian victory over Austria in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866. Historians have argued that it continued into the 20th century, with Hitler's ''[[Anschluss]]'' of 1938 as one high point.

The disagreement over the politics of the medieval Empire was important because those should determine the political direction and the national identity of the first national German state. Comments by [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Giesebrecht]], who like Sybel was a student of [[Leopold von Ranke]], provoked Sybel into taking a public position. In his ''Geschichte der deutschen Kaiserzeit'' (1855–1888), Giesebrecht wrote: "Moreover, the period of the Empire is the era whan our people, strengthened through unity, had risen to a position of power where it could not only freely determine its own fate, but could also commandeer other peoples, and where the German man exercised his greatest power in the world and the German name had the richest sound".&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Giesebrecht: ''Geschichte der deutschen Kaiserzeit.'' Volume 1: ''Gründung des Kaisertums.'' Braunschweig 1863 [first published 1855], page VI. Quote: "Überdies ist die Kaiserzeit die Periode, in der unser Volk, durch Einheit stark, zu seiner höchsten Machtentfaltung gedieh, wo es nicht allein frei über sein eigenes Schicksal verfügte, sondern auch anderen Völkern gebot, wo der deutsche Mann am meisten in der Welt galt und der deutsche Name den vollsten Klang hatte."&lt;/ref&gt; Sybel countered that throughout the period of the Empire, starting with [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor]],  "national" interests had been betrayed while the Empire pursued interests in Italy, that its interest in the affairs of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] had led only to meaningless loss of life. This was different, according to Sybel, under Otto's father, [[Henry the Fowler]], but after him German politics were aimed in the wrong direction: "The powers of the nation, which at first and correctly following instinct had been directed toward the great colonization of the east, were afterwards aimed at an always alluring and always incorrect gleam of power south of the Alps.".&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, 1941, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sybel's position suggested the kind of imperialist thinking that found its expression in the famous ''[[Drang nach Osten]]'' phrase and had become a reality in the ''[[Ostsiedlung]]'', the migration and settlement of German-speaking peoples during the Holy Roman Empire. Sybel leaned on this development, even though it hadn't started under Heinrich I but rather in the 12th century, first past the [[Elbe]] and then across the [[Oder]], the settlement that had created [[Prussia]], [[Saxony]], and [[Silesia]] in Slavic areas. At the inception of the ''[[Alldeuscher Verband]]'', this movement was reiterated: "The old drive toward the East should be restored".&lt;ref&gt;Wippermann, 1981, page 87.&lt;/ref&gt; The development by [[Friedrich Ratzel]], in 1898, of the idea of ''Lebensraum'' supported this [[settler colonialism]], which came to be seen as an alternative for the transatlantic migration to America..
&lt;!--
Nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg erfuhr mit der Gründung der osteuropäischen Nationalstaaten das Problem der dort lebenden „[[Volksdeutsche]]n“ zunehmend Aufmerksamkeit und beschäftigte Historiker, Geographen und Volkskundler. Mit dem [[Anschluss (Österreich)|Anschluss]] Österreichs ans deutsche Reich und der „Einverleibung“ des [[Sudetenland]]es vollzog [[Adolf Hitler]] dann mit breitester Zustimmung die ersten ostexpansiven Schritte, indem er zunächst die Eigenstaatlichkeit Österreichs und der Tschechoslowakei auflöste, bevor er weiter nach Osten ausgriff.

Friedrich Schneider dokumentierte und kommentierte aus großdeutscher Perspektive in 6 Auflagen von 1934 bis 1943 den Streit um die Kaiser- und Ostpolitik und separat die Sybel-Ficker-Kontroverse 1941. „In einer Zeit ungeheuerer geschichtlicher Ereignisse“ sah er, wie er 1940 schrieb, die Position Sybels in einer „gesamtdeutschen Geschichtsbetrachtung“ als aufgehoben und überholt an: „Österreich ist in das Reich heimgekehrt, Großdeutschland ist entstanden.“&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, 1940, S. V.&lt;/ref&gt; Auch von [[Albert Brackmann]] (1871–1952) heißt es, dass seine „Herausarbeitung der Abhängigkeit von Ost- und Italienpolitik […] den Streit um die Kaiserpolitik des Mittelalters überwunden“ habe.&lt;ref&gt;Bosl, Franz, Hofmann: ''Biographisches Wörterbuch zur deutschen Geschichte.'' Studienausgabe, Band 1, Augsburg 1995, S. 338.&lt;/ref&gt;

Julius von Ficker war in dieser Auseinandersetzung, in der es um machtpolitische Positionierung in der Gegenwart ging, chancenlos geblieben. Er hatte in seiner Entgegnung auf Sybel 1861 erläutert, dass mit Kategorien wie „national“ oder „deutsch“ die Wirklichkeit des 10. Jahrhunderts nicht beschrieben werden könne. „Nation“ sei deshalb ein unangemessener Begriff, weil die damaligen Reichsbewohner sich nicht als „Deutsche“, sondern als Angehörige der einzelnen „Stämme“ –&amp;nbsp;Sachsen, Franken, Bayern usw.&amp;nbsp;– verstanden hätten. Gegen Sybel, aber auch gegen Giesebrecht setzte er folgende Feststellung: „Das Reich aber, bei dessen Gründung Nationalbewusstsein den Ausschlag gegeben haben soll, wurde auch jetzt noch nicht als deutsches bezeichnet.“&lt;ref&gt;Vgl. J. v. Ficker: ''Das Deutsche Kaiserreich in seinen universalen und nationalen Beziehungen.'' 1861; in: Schneider, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; Das bestätigt die moderne Auffassung, dass für diese Zeit des mittelalterlichen Reichs der Begriff gilt, unter dem es selbst in Erscheinung trat: [[Heiliges Römisches Reich]].

=== Sybels Standpunkt in Preußen, „Deutschösterreich“ und in Hitlers „Mein Kampf“ ===
Nach Sybels Einschätzung von 1859 ist die erst 1871 vollendete deutsche Nationalstaatsbildung nicht in Anlehnung an das 1806 aufgelöste Kaisertum zu bewerkstelligen. So lässt er seine Rede in einer rhetorischen Frage ausklingen: „Oder liegt sie“ (d. i. „die nationale Sache“) „nicht vielmehr auf gerade der entgegengesetzten Seite, wo Heinrich&amp;nbsp;I. und Heinrich der Löwe ihre große Laufbahn begannen, wo die [[Germanisierung]]  unserer östlichen Lande den vereinten Kräften aller deutschen Stämme gelang, wo Jahrhunderte hindurch in nationalem Glanze die Banner Bayerns, die Banner Wittelsbachs voranflogen?“

Wie sehr die Auseinandersetzung um die Kaiserpolitik die Gemüter bewegte, zeigte sich vor allen Dingen in Preußen: „Aber Sybel hat eben doch entscheidend dazu beigetragen, daß, um mit [[Ottokar Lorenz (Historiker)|Ottokar Lorenz]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:Ottokar Lorenz|Ottokar Lorenz]].'' Wikisource.&lt;/ref&gt; zu reden (1902), von dem Augenblick, wo in der Literatur, selbst in der populären, das deutsche Kaisertum von den preußisch gerichteten Politikern als etwas Abgetanes, Fremdes, Antinationales, in vielem Betracht Schädliches erkannt worden sei, es kaum einen Schüler oder Schulmeister gegeben habe, der nicht mündlich oder schriftlich versicherte, daß es schwerlich Unglückseligeres und Widerwärtigeres in unserer deutschen Vergangenheit gegeben habe als das Kaisertum.“&lt;ref&gt;So der Ficker-Schüler Julius Jung, vgl. Schneider, 1941, S. XXIX.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aber die Position Sybels fand auch erhebliches Gehör in [[Deutschösterreich]], wobei allerdings Otto&amp;nbsp;I. als „Gründer der Ostmark“ (= das spätere Österreich) ausgenommen wurde, und prägte z.&amp;nbsp;B. das Geschichtsbild von [[Richard Suchenwirth]] in seiner seit 1934 in jährlichen Neuauflagen verbreiteten „Deutschen Geschichte“,&lt;ref&gt;Suchenwirths Wertung der Italienpolitik Ottos&amp;nbsp;I. sieht einschließlich Ehrenrettung gegenüber Sybel so aus: „Allerdings sind die deutschen Stämme auf diesen Zügen nach dem Süden erst recht zu einer Einheit zusammengewachsen. Aber das wäre auch gegen die Slawen und Magyaren möglich gewesen und hätte hier dauernden Gewinn gebracht. So aber haben wir im Mittelalter den winkenden Siegespreis verscherzt. Otto selbst hat ja in beider Hinsicht seinen Mann gestanden, und wenn auch die Zukunft nur einen Teil der Verheißungen von 955 erfüllte, so stehen doch die Ostmark Österreich und im Grunde auch die spätere Mark Brandenburg auf den Schultern des von diesem Kaiser Errungenen. So weist sein Werk überall weit über seine Zeit hinaus.“(Richard Suchenwirth, Deutsche Geschichte. Von der germanischen Vorzeit bis zur Gegenwart, Leipzig 1935, S. 115.)&lt;/ref&gt; folgenreicher aber das von Adolf Hitler:
{{Zitat
 |Text=Wenn wir […] die politischen Erlebnisse unseres Volkes seit über tausend Jahren überprüfen, […] und das […] heute vor uns liegende Endresultat untersuchen, so werden wir gestehen müssen, dass aus diesem Blutmeer eigentlich nur drei Erscheinungen hervorgegangen sind, die wir als bleibende Früchte klar bestimmter außenpolitischer und überhaupt politischer Vorgänge ansprechen dürfen:
# die hauptsächlich von Bajuwaren betätigte Kolonisation der Ostmark,
# die Erwerbung und Durchdringung des Gebietes östlich der Elbe, und
# die von den Hohenzollern betätigte Organisation des brandenburgisch-preußischen Staates als Vorbild und Kristallisationskern eines neuen Reiches.&amp;nbsp;[…]
Jene beiden ersten großen Erfolge unserer Außenpolitik sind die dauerhaftesten geblieben. […] Und es muss als wahrhaft verhängnisvoll angesehen werden, dass unsere deutsche Geschichtsschreibung diese beiden weitaus gewaltigsten und für die Nachwelt bedeutungsvollsten Leistungen nie richtig zu würdigen verstand. […] Wir schwärmen auch heute noch von einem Heroismus, der unserem Volke Millionen seiner edelsten Blutträger raubte, im Endergebnis jedoch vollkommen unfruchtbar blieb.&amp;nbsp;[…]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;''Wir setzen dort an, wo man vor sechs Jahrhunderten endete. Wir stoppen den ewigen Germanenzug nach dem Süden und Westen Europas und weisen den Blick nach dem Osten.''
 |ref=&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Hitler: ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. Zweiter Band, ''Die nationalsozialistische Bewegung''. München 1933, S.&amp;nbsp;733–742. (Der letzte Satz ist im Original fett gedruckt und hervorgehoben.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Tattooed ladies''' were working class women who acquired [[tattoos]] and performed in [[circus]]es, [[sideshow]]s, and dime show museums as means for earning a substantial living. At the height of their popularity during the turn of the [[20th century]], tattooed ladies transgressed [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Gender role|gender norms]] by showcasing their bodies in scantily clad clothing and earned a salary considerably larger than their male counterparts.Tattooed ladies often used [[captivity narrative]]s as a means for excusing their appearance, and to tantalize the audience. The popularity of tattooed ladies waned with the onset of [[television]].

== Origins ==

=== Olive Oatman ===
[[File:Olive Oatman1 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Olive Oatman by Benjamin F. Powelson, US National Portrait Gallery.]]
Thirty years before tattooed women exploded on the sideshow and dime museum circuit scene, a young, white woman made national headlines with her unusual appearance and frightening story. During her family's westward emigration along the [[Santa Fe Trail]] in 1851, the Yavapi took thirteen-year-old [[Olive Oatman]], along with her seven year old sister Mary Ann, captive. The Oatman girls lived with the [[Yavapai|Yavapi]] until they were traded to the Mojave with whom they lived with until Mary Ann's death and Olive's subsequent rescue on February 22, 1856,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=LASTAR18560419.2.2&amp;srpos=6&amp;e=-------en--20-LASTAR-1--txt-txIN-olive+oatman-------1|title=Los Angeles Star 19 April 1856 — California Digital Newspaper Collection|website=cdnc.ucr.edu|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the assumption that her entire family was deceased and that rescue proved impossible, Olive assimilated to Mojave culture and acquired chin and arm tattoos as a means for identifying herself in the afterlife. According to Amelia Klem Osterud, Oatman's story parted with traditional captivity narratives and Victorian gender norms since she didn't "wither and die" due to her experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tattooed Lady|last=Klem Osterud|first=Amelia|publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing|year=2014|isbn=|location=Maryland|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oatman deliberately reconciled her identity as an adopted Mojave with her new one as a marked white woman by traveling on a lecture circuit with her ghostwriter, Royal B. Stratton. Olive's decision to sensationalize her narrative for profit and to exclude intimate aspects of it for self-protection demonstrate an astute awareness of her predicament. Since US society would not have tolerated Oatman's choice to assimilate into Mojave culture, or even accept her as a transcultural individual, she purposefully recast herself as a victim of outside brutality. In this way, Oatman garnered more nods of sympathy and support rather than stares of disgust. In turn, her story served as the model for future working-class women to exploit through mythical and scandalously revealing narratives. Using the victim narrative allowed women such as Oatman, and the ones who copied her story, to display their bodies for profit in a way that just passed for respectable during the Victorian era.

=== Becoming a tattooed lady ===
Getting started in the tattoo performing business was relatively quick and easy. Circuses and dime museums always searched for new and exciting acts and even went as far as posting wanted ads in newspapers for tattooed ladies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015679/1902-08-24/ed-1/seq-24/|title=The Indianapolis journal. (Indianapolis [Ind.]) 1867–1904, August 24, 1902, PART TWO, Image 24|date=1902-08-24|access-date=2017-12-15|issn=2332-0974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, acquiring tattoos proved to be an accessible, as well as affordable, investment with a massive payoff. During the late 1890s to early 1900s, tattoo artists typically charged less than a dollar for small tattoos, while a full body job totaled thirty dollars and took less than two months to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bodies of Inscription: A Cultural History of the Modern Tattoo Community|last=DeMello|first=Margo|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Durham &amp; London|pages=55–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performing in sideshows brought in serious cash; depending on her popularity, a tattooed lady made anywhere from $100 to $200 weekly during the turn of the century. Amelia Klem Osterud further expands on the significance of this salary:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Teachers were making an average of $7 a week in 1900, which generally included room and board; in 1909, clerical workers were only earning about $22 a week […] while the average weekly salary for a man working in a factory or some other industrial job in [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin, was only $9."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tattooed Lady|last=Klem Osterud|first=Amelia|publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing|year=2014|isbn=|location=Maryland|pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The ''Roanoke Daily'' reported in 1895 that an unnamed tattooed woman, "was paid $100 a day," and,&lt;blockquote&gt;"[…]the fairy tale about her, as told by the showman, only heightened the crowd's interest and harmed nobody. She was represented in the story as having been stranded on one of the Sandwich islands, shipwrecked with her husband, who was put to death. Her life was spared, but she was put to torture, having these extraordinary characters tattooed all over her body. There from 500 to 700 people at each other the 21 daily performances at which that tattooed woman was exhibited, and all were pleased at the show, for which they paid 10 cents. "Do many of these freaks, remarkable for various reasons, get fine salaries?" "Indeed they do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn95079481/1895-10-15/ed-1/seq-2/|title=The Roanoke daily times. (Roanoke, Va.) 1895–1897, October 15, 1895, Image 2|date=1895-10-15|access-date=2017-12-15|pages=2|issn=2166-7950}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This excerpt from the ''Roanoke Daily'' also provides insight into 'smoke and mirrors' aspect of work as a tattooed lady. Referring to this unknown tattooed woman's story as a harmless fairytale reveals an awareness that Victorians held. Many knew the falsehood of these captivity stories, yet gladly spent their money to hear them for the sake of entertainment, as well as a chance to satiate their curiosity to see the female body in an uncharacteristic form. In this way, working-class tattooed ladies knowingly tapped into a market that turned the tables on their high-class counterparts by exploiting their gaze for sky-high prices. Other working-class women did not hesitate to justify their reasoning for becoming tattooed performers. In a revealing 1884 ''Sedalia Weekly Bazoo'' interview, tattooed lady Mary Baum shared a candid and similar start up story when asked where she got the idea to acquire tattoos from; "I don't know exactly," said the varicolored lady. "I saw the other tattooed ladies in museums, and thought it would be nice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn90061066/1884-10-28/ed-1/seq-7/|title=The Sedalia weekly bazoo. (Sedalia, Mo.) 187?-1904, October 28, 1884, Image 7|date=1884-10-28|access-date=2017-12-15|pages=7|issn=2163-7369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Advertising and money ====
It is important to note that while tattooed women did indeed earn substantially more than their working-class male counterparts, their salary was not necessarily steady. A tattooed woman's earnings depended on the seasons, popularity and success of the circus or dime museum she associated with, and competition from other tattooed performers. Some tattooed women expanded their reach beyond the tent and secured additional income by advertising products. For example, in an advertisement headlined: ''Punctured Purity: A Wonderfully Tattooed'' ''Lady, Nature and Art Perforated— A Beauty,'' Irene Woodward's name is used to sell pain-reducing St. Jacob's Oil;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Miss Irene was tattooed by her father and underwent what was to her a period of delightful suffering for seven years. The young lady during that time suffered, of course, but were we to undergo such a delightful piece of needlework, it is needless to say that we would want in close proximity a bottle of […] St. Jacob's Oil […]I consider it as far superior to any other medicine in curative power, as Miss Woodward, from an artistic point, is above a bit of bric a brac."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bklyn.newspapers.com/clip/462292/irene_woodward_punctured_purity/|title=Irene Woodward Punctured Purity – Newspapers.com|work=Brooklyn Public Library|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Whether or not Irene profited directly off of the advertisement remains unknown, however, the media exposure assisted in gaining popularity and a wider audience. Ultimately, the positive wording in the advertisement, including the mention that Irene is above using a faulty product, attempted to elevate her into a respectable status.

===== Gaining respectability =====
Unlike the ease of acquiring tattoos, gaining respectability occurred with great difficulty. The consequences of acquiring tattoos and performing in skimpy outfits weighed heavily tattooed ladies. Irene Woodward's appearance served as a mark of deviancy and most members of society found her exposed tattooed body repulsive outside of the high top. With this in mind, Victorians hardly viewed circuses and dime museums as beacons for good, clean family fun. Nonetheless, they remained curious and captivated by Irene's tantalizing story. In order to toe the line between virtue and nonconformity, Irene's media splash in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] provided insight as to how both tattooed ladies and media outlets strategically crafted their image as respectable;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Miss Woodward remarked that she felt a little bashful about being looked at that way, never having worn the costume in the pretense of men before.The tattooing, which was done in India ink, appeared artistic, and the devices were carried and attractive. Around the neck was observed a floral necklace. Dependent from this was a bunch of roses in full bloom dropping until their graceful forms were lost beneath the lace edging of the bodice…the arms were covered with stars hearts, floating angels, wreaths, harps, crosses, a full-rigged ship, and various mottoes."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1882/03/19/102772175.pdf|title=THE TATTOOED WOMAN.|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Prefacing Irene's name with 'Miss', along with referencing her reluctance to reveal herself in front of male figures for the first time reflects the attempt to legitimize her status as a proper lady, and softens the transgressive nature of her appearance. Irene's first time occurred every time she presented her body before audiences; this served undoubtedly as a way to 'exclusivize' her display from city to city and to attract droves of spectators. The vivid descriptions of her tattoos, along with the use of the words: bashful, artistic, attractive, floral and graceful as descriptors served as a way to further elevate, as well as feminize, Irene's appearance. Other performers, such as Miss Creole and Miss Alawanda, adopted similar media tools in their presentation. As tattooed ladies became more commonplace in circuses and dime museums, the opportunities that came with the twentieth century also forced tattooed ladies to face new challenges.  In order to stay exotic within the realm of changing ideas concerning respectability, these women thought of innovative narratives to compete with each other, as well as to recapture the attention of audiences. These women shifted the Victorian victim narrative to one that demonstrates elements of deliberate choice in becoming a 'self-made freak'. In a greater sense, the act of exposing their bodies for pay, and even operating independently without subordinating themselves to a male boss, defied traditionally held social expectations concerning a woman's bodily autonomy.

====== Functioning in mainstream society ======
True to their career-driven investment, tattooed ladies kept covered to not only prevent free shows, thus keeping their exoticism fresh, but to also prevent the wear and tear tattoos suffer over the course of aging and through regular sun exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tattooed Lady|last=Klem Osterud|first=Amelia|publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing|year=2014|isbn=|location=Maryland|pages=66, 114, 119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tattooed ladies strategically placed their tattoos in such a way that allowed them to dress modestly in public and to function in their daily lives unnoticed. Photographs of popular tattooed ladies reveal that their tattoos did not extend past their forearms, above their neck or below their ankles. In addition, many of these ladies' bore tattoos that included religious and patriotic iconography. Whether this was for personal preference or as a means of self-expression is not known, however, the organization and thematic nature of these tattoos demonstrate a common pattern. Tattooed ladies used such images to elevate the status of their tattoos as a proper art form worthy of display and as a way to soften the blow of their nonconforming bodies for spectators. Even the [[Ringling Brothers Circus]] management remained cognizant of this and encouraged employees, particularly women, to maintain respectable behavior on and off stage to dispel stereotyping associated with their acts; "we should want the "Town folks" to feel that the "Show folks" are real men and women and ladies and gentlemen as well."&lt;ref&gt;"Suggestions and Rules for Employees, Ringling Brothers," Photocopy of employee pamphlet. Circus World Museum, Baraboo, Wisconsin.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the image of respectability encompassed not only a tattooed woman personally, but the entire reputation of the show she worked for.

== Early tattooed ladies ==

=== Nora Hildebrandt ===

[[File:Nora Hildebrandt, by Charles Eisenmann.jpg|thumb|left|Nora Hildebrandt]]
Nora Hildebrandt, one of the first tattooed ladies to perform in the US, wildly fictionalized her pasts to attract audiences captivated by her scandalous outfits, as well as the sexual undertones of her forced tattooing by Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tattooed Lady|last=Klem Osterud|first=Amelia|publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing|year=2014|isbn=|location=Maryland|pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a pamphlet published around 1882, Hildebrandt's outlandish backstory included not only captivity among [[Sitting Bull]]'s tribe, but also forced tattooing by her own father:&lt;blockquote&gt;"One of Sitting Bull's warriors accused him of trying to poison them, and the chief told the prisoner if he would tattoo his daughter he would give him his liberty— that he must tattoo her from her toes to her head…He was compelled to work six hours a day for one year before she was recused, accomplishing three hundred and sixty five designs."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bogdan Private Collection&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In reality, Nora Hildebrandt was born into poverty under a different name in [[London]], England sometime in the 1850s. Nora likely met professional tattoo artist [[Martin Hildebrandt]], who was often presented as her father or husband even though they did not actually marry, and allowed him to tattoo her entire body in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tattooed Lady|last=Klem Osterud|first=Amelia|publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing|year=2014|isbn=|location=Maryland|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the process of tattooing during the time period involved crudely hand-poked images and long hours of intense pain, Nora Hildebrandt's reward for becoming a self-made 'freak' was not kept secret. She enjoyed an exceptional amount of privilege as a tattooed lady. For example, the ''New York Clipper'' reported on March 22, 1884 that during her visit to Mexico, received&lt;blockquote&gt;"the LARGEST AND MOST COSTLY PRESENTS EVER KNOWN [sic]…Among the presents may be mentioned a HANDSOME MUSTANG MENAGE PONY, SADDLE AND BRIDLE FROM PRESIDENT GONZALEZ, AND FROM HIS SON A PRECIOUS PAIR OF SOLITAIRE EARDROPS [sic]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&amp;d=NYC18840322.2.58&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------#|title=New York Clipper 22 March 1884 — Illinois Digital Newspaper Collections|website=idnc.library.illinois.edu|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;On the other hand, the media did not always behave kindly toward Hildebrandt. In a scathing 1882 review, the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' lambasted Nora's stout stature and masculine facial features; "her face is [so] hard that you wonder they ever got the needle through the skin without a hammer."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This statement reveals that no woman remained safe from oppressive societal standards of beauty. Indeed, a tattooed woman remained especially vulnerable to social commentary concerning aspects of her body outside of her control. With this in mind, how the media treated a tattooed lady ultimately determined her star's ability to rise. In turn, once tattooed women began to change their stories and use the media to their advantage, they experienced more longevity in their careers.

=== Irene Woodward ===

Not much is known about Irene Woodward's origins before her career as a tattooed lady. In fact, the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' claimed that &lt;blockquote&gt;"She was the daughter of a sailor who began the tattooing when she was but 6 years of age and finished it when she was 12. She was born near Dallas, Texas, and has spent the greater part of her life in the Western wilds. She conceived the idea of exhibiting herself after seeing the tattooed Greek in Denver."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In a far less captivating story, [[Samuel O'Reilly]] and his not yet famous apprentice, Charles Wagner, tattooed Woodward. Unlike Nora Hilderbrant, Miss Creole and Miss Alawanda, Irene Woodward did not use the captivity narrative in full. Though her tattoos were still imposed from an outside individual, the implication that her father completed them suggests that the imposition came from within Western cultural practices rather than external ones. Irene Woodward's unusually honest statement proves that her motive came from a place far deeper than her ink. She saw a male tattooed performer, the possibility of securing a living by replicating him, and reinvented herself.

== Tattooed ladies in transition ==
As women began to experience greater social freedom due to suffrage, the New Woman Movement and the absence of male competition in the workforce during both World Wars, the tattoo evolved into a solidified marker of working-class folk art. Undoubtedly, tattooed women still faced harsh scrutiny for their appearance. However, with their limited options taken into consideration, the pay-off was ultimately worth it and women during the time period continued to perform. During the 1930s and onward, tattooed ladies deviated from fictionalized captivity narratives and boldly accounted for their choice of profession more freely.

=== Mae Vandermark ===

When asked in 1931 why she acquired her tattoos, May Vandermark quipped, "I love Art…and that's true, too—up to a certain point…I mean, I like to eat regular." &lt;ref&gt;"Art Means Grub to a Tattooed Lady," New York Post, April 7, 1931&lt;/ref&gt; Vandermark found that performing as a tattooed lady garnered a higher profit than working as a stenographer. According to a 1927 article in the ''Milwaukee Sentinel'', Vandermark saw another woman with a small tattoo while swimming at Coney Island and decided she wanted one. Upon acquiring two, she met and became "great friends" with tattooed performer Lotta Pictoria "who persuaded Mae to be a professional."&lt;ref&gt;Love Tragedy of the India-Rubber Man and the Tattooed Lady," ''The Milwaukee Sentinel,'' August 14, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; In the same article,  Lotta Pictoria is referenced as the person who introduced Vandermark to Charles Wagner and helped her gain a full body suit over the course of ten months for the bargain price of $130. This suggests that Lotta Pictoria mentored or showed Mae Vandermark the ropes of performing as a tattooed lady, shared her social connections with her and helped launched her career.

=== Betty Broadbent ===

Initially, she performed as the youngest tattooed woman ever during the 1920s, however, by the time bathing suits and hemlines rose, Broadbent decided to shock the public when she entered a beauty pageant at the World's Fair in 1939.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bodies of Subversion: A Secret History of Women and Tattoo|last=Mifflin|first=Margot|publisher=Powerhouse Books|year=2013|isbn=|location=New York|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; While she had no chance of winning, Broadbent enjoyed the attention and free advertising, and assured her audiences that her wholesome act stood apart from "those carnival floozies with one or two tattoos who would bump and grind." &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Like Mae Vandermark, Broadbent's tattoos also bore references to pop culture icons and ones suited to her individual taste; she sported images of Charlie Chaplin and Charles Lindberg. In this way, Broadbent reflects the tattoo's permanence in American folk culture as an art form steadily gaining recognition. Incidentally, Broadbent's tattoos suggest a deliberate attempt to express oneself through choice rather than imposition or affliction.  Broadbent's overt challenge to traditional female behavior also substantiated her tattoo narrative. Gone were the days of having to invent a victim tale to excuse her status as a tattooed lady. In fact, her souvenir postcard bluntly dispelled any mystery surrounding her choice in getting tattooed; "It was done for professional reasons only. I have no regrets for having chosen this most unusual career."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tattooed Lady|last=Klem Osterud|first=Amelia|publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing|year=2014|isbn=|location=Maryland|pages=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadbent's 1956 pay stub for $220 suggests no need for regrets, as her earnings were significantly high.&lt;ref&gt;Dana Brunson Private Collection&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fading away ==
During the 1950s and 1960s, business started to lag for many artists and tattooed ladies since circus shows and dime museums fell out of vogue. As the postwar era hailed a sense of conformity and normalcy, tattoos decreased in popularity and once again became stigmatized due to their longstanding association with criminal activity. Still, a small group of tattooed women, whose youth and ink faded considerably by this time, continued to perform where an audience gathered. One of the last to perform, Artoria Gibbons performed well into her eighties during the 1980s not necessarily for money, but for the love of performance art.&lt;ref&gt;Charlene Gibbons, Facebook message to author, April 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Though not as visible or discussed as often, tattooed ladies moonlighted as artists during their off seasons alongside their husbands. Many of these tattooed ladies learned the craft of professional tattooing from their significant others and paved the way for a new generation of women to secure their livings by creating feminine styles of flash in their own shops.

*'''mid-September to mid-October''': Australian troops occupy the major cities of eastern Indonesia&amp;mdash;in most cases before Republican administrations have been established&amp;mdash;putting down demonstrations and arresting some pro-Republican officials.

The city is conquered in three days, but fighting continues for three weeks. At least 6,000 Indonesians die and thousands flee. 10 November is now commemorated in Indonesia as Heroes’ Day.
*'''11 November''': Division commanders elect [[Sudirman]] as commander-in-chief of the revolutionary armed forces.
*'''11 November''': The cabinet is made responsible to the KNIP rather than to the president.
*'''14 November''': A new cabinet is formed; Sjahrir becomes Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Interior.
*'''end November''': Regents of Brebes, Tegal and Pemalang are replaced by supporters of this 'social revolution'.

===December===
*'''1945, 12 November''' &amp;ndash; Resident of Pekalongan is overthrown by 'social revolutionaries' and replaced with a former secret PKI member and underground leader. In retaliation, local Republican army units and 'pemuda' sweep through the three regencies arresting 1,000 supporters of the 'social revolution', which end in defeat.
*'''December''': Amir’s followers merge with those of Sjahrir’s to form the ''Partai Sosialis'' ('Socialist Party').
*'''mid December''' &amp;ndash; Allies evacuate Japanese troops from Aceh. Civil war then breaks out.
*'''December to March 1946''' &amp;ndash; Leading ''uleebalangs'' of Aceh and their families are imprisoned or killed.

==1946==
*'''January''': Tan Malaka forms the [[Murba Party|Persatuan Perjuangan]] (''Struggle Front'') that aims to create unity among the organisations that exist to achieve full independence for Indonesia and reject diplomacy before the recognition of sovereignty by the Dutch.
*'''February''': The Republican capital is moved to Yogyakarta following the Dutch occupation of Jakarta.
* '''February''': Communist Party members clash with Republican army units.
*'''March''': In east Sumatra, [[Batak (Indonesia)|Bataks]] led by leftists attack the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]], Simalungun Batak and Karo Batak ''rajas''. Arrest and robbery leads to slaughter and hundreds of eastern Sumatran aristocrats die, including poet [[Amir Hamzah]].
*'''23-24 March''': In what is known as the ''Bandung Sea of Fire'', Republicans burn [[Bandung]]'s southern wards while patriotic militias flee after refusing British demands for surrender.
*'''April''': Leaders of the [[East Sumatra revolution|Eastern Sumatran social revolution]] are arrested or go into hiding but the authority of the ''rajas'' is irrevocably weakened.
*'''April''': 300 people are killed in Tapanuli (North Sumatra) in fighting between Toba Bataks and Karo Bataks, an ethnic conflict influenced by the Christianity among the Toba and Islam among the Karo.
*'''27 June''': Opposition forces feel that '100 percent independence' is betrayed by a speech made by Hatta in Yogyakarta that reveals the limited nature of the government’s negotiating position. Prime Minister Sjahrir is subsequently arrested by local army units hoping to reduce{{clarify|date=November 2017}} Republic leadership. Sukarno declares martial law and demands Sjahrir’s release.
*'''30 June''': In a radio address, Sukarno declares that Sjahrir’s arrest has endangered the unity of the nation, which shakes the confidence of the opposition; Sjahrir is released that same night.
*'''3 July''': A Republican army delegation is sent to Yogyakarta to demand Sukarno sack the Cabinet and put Sudirman in charge of security affairs. The delegation, however, is arrested along with about one hundred opposition figures including Yamin.
*'''July''': At a Dutch-organised conference at Maliano (southern Sulawesi), thirty-nine Indonesian representatives of the ''rajas'', Christians and several ethnic groups of Kalimantan and eastern Indonesia support the idea of a federal state and some form of continuing Dutch connection. The Dutch are surprised at the Indonesian request for some genuine autonomy. States of Kalimantan and for East Indonesia are planned.
*'''October''': Following negotiations from the previous year, ceasefires in Java and Sumatra are agreed upon by the Dutch and the Republic.
*'''12 November''': The [[Linggadjati Agreement]] sees the Netherlands recognise the Republic as the 'de facto' authority in Java, Madura and Sumatra, and both sides agreeing to co-operate to establish a [[Federalism|federal]] 'United States of Indonesia' by 1 January 1949; the Republic will be one of the states, the Dutch monarch will be the symbolic head of a Dutch-Indonesian union of sovereign states. The agreement does not last; compromises accepted by both parties provoke bitter political backlashes from both within the Republic and the Netherlands.
*'''November''': The Dutch federalist structure in Sulawesi is threatened by Republican youths returning from Java where they had received military training.
*'''December''': The Dutch respond to the Republican ''pemuda'' threat in southern Sulawesi with troops led by Captain Raymond 'Turk' Westerling that use arbitrary terror techniques. These techniques are emulated by other anti-Republican forces. Over three months at least 3,000 Indonesians are thought to have been killed, and Republican youth forces are decimated.
*'''December''': The [[State of East Indonesia]] (''Negara Indonesia Timur'') is created at a conference in [[Denpasar]] Bali. Republican ideals are still influential; 'Indonesia Raya' is adopted as the national anthem, which is also used by the Republic, and a pro-Republic Bugis is almost elected President. Sjahrir protests at the unilateral creation of the state are ineffectual. All of Kalimantan cannot be incorporated as one state as the south and east coasts are too pro-Republican.
*'''December''': To improve chances of KNIP-ratification of the 'Linggatjati Agreement', the KNIP is increased from 200 to 514 members by packing it with pro-government figures from the left wing.

==1947==
[[File:KNIP1947.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The historic meeting of the KNIP in [[Malang]], East Java to decide Indonesia's response to the Linggadjati Agreement]]
*'''February''': The pro-Republic Datu of Supa is killed by [[Westerling]]’s troops.
*'''February''': The '[[Linggadjati Agreement]]' finally ratified by the KNIP after [[Mohammad Hatta|Hatta]] and [[Sukarno]] threaten to resign if it is not accepted.
*'''June''': [[Amir Sjarifuddin]] and other leftists in the KNIP withdraw support for Sjahrir’s prime ministership. Sjahrir would go abroad to represent the Republic at the UN.
*'''July''': Amir Sjarifuddin becomes Prime Minister of the Republic.
*'''May''': A separate state of West Kalimantan is established under Sultan Abdul Hamid II of [[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]]. Sjahrir protests at the unilateral creation of the state are ineffectual.
*'''May''': The Dutch decide that they must attack the Republic directly, believing they can conquer Republican-held cities within two weeks, and all Republican territory within 6 months.
*'''20 July''': At midnight, the Dutch launch [[Operatie Product|a major military offensive]], which they refer to as a '[[Politionele acties|police action]]'. Major columns swept out from [[Jakarta]] and [[Bandung]] to occupy [[West Java]] and from [[Surabaya]] to occupy [[Madura]] and the Eastern Salient. Smaller troop movements secure the [[Semarang]] area. The Dutch thus gain control of all deep-water ports in [[Java]], and in [[Sumatra]] control is secured over plantations around [[Medan]], oil and coal installations around [[Palembang]] and the [[Padang, Indonesia|Padang]] area. Republican forces retreat amidst confusion destroying what they can, and carrying out last minute acts of revenge; ethnic Chinese in West Java and imprisoned aristocrats in East Sumatra are murdered. The Dutch originally intend to carry on to [[Yogyakarta]] to install a more amendable Republican Government. American and British protests at the military action, however, stop the Dutch from complete conquest of the Republic. Australian and Indian, and eventually American representation in the [[United Nations]] raise the profile of the independence cause.
*'''4 August''': The Dutch and Sukarno order a UN-demanded ceasefire
*'''August''': The UN allows Sjahrir to address it, but does not allow representatives from Dutch-held areas.
*'''August''': The Dutch continue mopping-up actions operations within their advance points where numerous Republican fighters remain, including the [[Siliwangi Division]] in West Java.
*'''September''': The Dutch create the [[State of South Sumatra]].
*'''October''': The UN Good Offices Committee with American, Australian and Belgian representatives is established to assist Dutch-Republican negotiations for a new ceasefire.
*'''November''': The Dutch create the [[State of East Java]].
*'''December''': The Dutch create the [[East Sumatra|State of East Sumatra]].

==1948==
[[File:Van Mook.png|right|250px|thumb|Map of [[Java]] showing the Van Mook Line after the [[Renville Agreement]].]]
*'''January''': A [[Renville Agreement|new agreement]] is reached between the Dutch and the Republic aboard the American ship [[USS Renville (APA-227)|USS ''Renville'']] moored in Jakarta Bay and used as a neutral location. The agreement recognises the so-called 'van Mook line', an artificial line that links the most advanced Dutch-controlled areas, even though many Republican areas remain within this new area.
*'''January''': [[Indonesian National Party|PNI]] and [[Masyumi]] members of Cabinet resign over terms of the 'Renville Agreement'.
*'''23 January''': [[Amir Sjarifuddin]] resigns as prime minister. [[Sukarno]] appoints [[Mohammad Hatta|Hatta]] to head an emergency [[First Hatta Cabinet|'presidential cabinet']] directly responsible to the President and not the KNIP. The new cabinet consists mainly of PNI, Masyumi and non-party members; Amir and Left Wing subsequently in opposition.
*'''February''': Sjahrir’s followers create the [[Socialist Party of Indonesia]] (''Partai Sosialis Indonesia'')  giving their support to Hatta’s government.
*'''February''': The Dutch create the states of [[State of Madura|Madura]] and [[Pasundan]] (West Java) .
*'''February''': A left-wing coalition renames itself the People’s Democratic Front ('Front Demokrasi Rakyat') and denounces the 'Renville Agreement', which Amir’s government had itself negotiated.
*'''February''': In accordance with the 'Renville Agreement', [[Nasution|Colonel Nasution]] leads the 22,000 men of the Siliwangi Division out of Dutch-held West Java into Republican [[Central Java]] with important consequences for both regions.
*'''March''': [[Hubertus Johannes van Mook|Van Mook]] announces creation of a provisional government for a federal Indonesia with himself as president.
*'''May''': A People’s Democratic Front organised strike at a state textiles factory in Delanggu, Central Java begins. The strike is not, however, a matter of class divisions, but communal division, with the 'abangan' (nominal Muslims) supported by the Front, pitted against the 'santri' (strict Muslims) supported by Indonesian Hizbullah units. The strike is settled in July on terms favourable to the strikers, but, Republic politics are now increasingly entangled and run along the Javanese communal tensions manifested in the strike.
*'''May''': Interpreting the Siliwangi Division’s departure from West Java as a Republican abandonment of the region, [[Kartosuwirjo]] a Javanese mystic Masyumi-connected leader of Hizbullah guerrillas, launches a rebellion against the Republic, whilst continuing to fight the Dutch in West Java. He proclaims himself ''imam'' ('head') of a new state called ''Negara Islam Indonesia'' ('Indonesia Islamic State'), or more commonly known as ''[[Darul Islam (Indonesia)|Darul Islam]]''. The Republic can only ignore the rival group until Kartosuwirjo’s capture and execution in 1962.
*'''July''': The Dutch establish a [[Federal Consultative Assembly]] (''Bijeenkomst voor Federale Overleg'') consisting of leaders of the fifteen Dutch-created states. There is now, however, significant pro-Republican support amongst the states’ native elite and little support for [[federalism]] among the population.
*'''August''': Civil war threatens to break out after episodes of kidnappings, murders and armed conflict between factions of the Republican army as a consequence of a military rationalisation process aimed at a smaller more professional force. Republican Central Java is awash with political manoeuvring, military politics and communal tensions, while Dutch forces surround it to the west, north and east.
*'''11 August 1948''': [[Musso]], the 1920s leader of the PKI, arrives in Yogyakarta from the [[Soviet Union]]. Amir and the leadership of the People’s Democratic Front accept his authority, with Amir admitting membership of the underground PKI since 1935. Adhering to Musso’s Stalinist thinking of a single party of the working class, the major leftist parties in the Front dissolve themselves into the [[Communist Party of Indonesia|PKI]].
*'''August and September''': PKI encourages demonstrations and industrial action by workers and peasants. Peasants were encouraged to take over landlords’ fields in the Surakarta and other areas.
*'''1 September''': A new PKI ''[[politburo]]'' is formed.
*'''September''': [[Tan Malaka]] is released by the Republican Government in attempt to divert leftist supporters from the PKI.
*'''17 September''': Following the outbreak of open warfare in [[Surakarta]] between pro-PKI and pro-Government forces, the Siliwangi Division drives PKI supporters out of the city. Pro-PKI supporters withdraw to Madiun.
*'''18 September''': PKI supporters take over strategic points in the Madiun area, kill pro-government officers, and announce over radio the formation of a new National Front government. Caught off guard by the premature coup attempt, Musso, Amir and other PKI leaders travel to Madiun to take charge.
*'''19 September''': About 200 pro-PKI and other leftist leaders remaining in [[Yogyakarta]] are arrested. Sukarno denounces the Madiun rebels over the radio and calls upon Indonesians to rally to himself and Hatta rather than to Musso and his plans for a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-style government. Musso replies on radio that he will fight to the finish. The People’s Democratic Front in [[Banten]] and [[Sumatra]] announce they have nothing to do with the rebellion.
*'''late September''': Pro-government forces, led by the Siliwangi Division, march on Madiun where there are an estimated 5,000-10,000 pro-PKI soldiers. As the rebels retreat they kill Masyumi and PNI leaders and officials, and in the villages killings take place along ''[[santri]]-[[abangan]]'' lines.
*'''30 September''': The rebels abandon Madiun and are pursued by pro-government troops through the countryside. [[Dipa Nusantara Aidit|Aidit]] and [[M. H. Lukman|Lukman]] flee Indonesia for China and Vietnam.
*'''October''': The 'national Communists' who had followed Tan Malaka’s thinking and opposed the PKI rebellion form the ''[[Murba Party|Partai Murba]]'' ('Proletarian Party') becoming the main leftist group among the revolutionaries.
*'''31 October''': Musso is killed trying to escape from custody.
*'''1 December''': Amir and 300 rebel soldiers are captured by Siliwangi troops. Some 35,000 people are later arrested. It is thought perhaps 8,000 people were killed in the affair. Later in Surakarta, ''santri'' peasants turn on and killed ''abangan'' PKI supporters.
*'''18 December''': The Dutch launch a second major military offensive, the second 'police action'.
*'''19 December''': The Dutch occupy Yogyakarta city. The Republican government is captured, reportedly intentionally, including [[Sukarno]], [[Muhammad Hatta|Hatta']], [[Agus Salim]], and Sjahrir. Republican forces withdraw to the countryside beginning full-scale guerrilla war on either side of the van Mook line. The army kill Amir and fifty other leftist prisoners as it withdraws from Yogyakarta that evening, rather than risk their later release.
*'''22 December''': International outrage leads to suspension of United States aid funds to the Netherlands.
*'''22 December''': With Nasution in effective control of army due to Sudirman’s deteriorating health, he proclaims a military government for Java.
*'''1 December''': In Java, the Dutch accept a UN call for a ceasefire but [[guerrilla]] fighting continues.

==1949==
[[File:Republik Indonesia Serikat.png|right|250px|thumb|The [[United States of Indonesia]]]]
*'''January''': [[Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwana IX]] resigns as head of the [[Yogyakarta]] district after refusing [[Netherlands|Dutch]] attempts at persuading him to become leader of a new [[Java]]nese state. His court becomes a primary communication channel between the city and Republican units in the countryside.
*'''January''': Cabinets of the Dutch controlled states of East Indonesian and Pasudan resign in protest at the 'police action'.
*'''5 January''': In Sumatra, the Dutch accept a UN call for a ceasefire but guerrilla fighting continues.
*'''late January''': The [[UN Security Council]] demands the release of the Republican cabinet, the establishment of an interim government, and full transfer of sovereignty to Indonesia by 1 July 1950. The United States government publicly condemns the Netherlands and threatens to cut off vital [[Marshall Plan]] reconstruction aid.
*'''February''': In a clash with another Republic group, [[Tan Malaka]] and his army unit are defeated; Tan Malaka is captured and executed.
*'''1 March''': [[Suharto|Lieutenant-Colonel Soeharto]] leads Republican forces in capturing Yogyakarta for six hours in what is known as the ''[[General Offensive of 1 March 1949]]''. While the Dutch recover the city later, they are weakened at all fronts by the offensive.
*'''April''': The Dutch accept they must relinquish their claims on Indonesia but insist on preliminary talks with the Republican government.
*'''7 May''': In the [[Roem–van Roijen Agreement]], the Dutch and Indonesia agree that Sukarno and Hatta will order a ceasefire upon their release and return to Yogyakarta, that the Dutch will accept the Republic at a [[round table]] conference, and that they will create no more federal states.
*'''May to June''': The Dutch evacuate their citizens from Yogyakarta.
*'''6 July''': The Republican government is returned to Yogyakarta although the army is initially reluctant to accept the authority of the civilians it believes deserted the Republic. The army expresses support for the civilian administration when Suharto threatens to resign.
*'''July''': A conference is held in Yogyakarta, and agrees that the Republican army will form the core of the military in a new '[[United States of Indonesia|Republic of the United States of Indonesia]]' (RUSI), with Sukarno and Hatta President and Vice-president respectively.
*'''1 August''': A ceasefire is announced to take effect on 11 August in Java and 15 August in Sumatra. Following a ceasefire, Hamengkubuwana IX acts as Coordinator of Security and overseas a gradual transfer of military authority from Dutch troops and Indonesian irregulars, to Republic regular troops. Clashes break out and end in South Sulawesi, East Sumatra, South Kalimantan and West Java where local irregular troops resisted the transfer.
*'''7-10 August''': Surakarta is liberated in the final major Republican offensive in Central Java, the ''August General Offensive'', striking a final blow to Dutch military power in the island. This is the final battle before the 11 August ceasefire takes effect.
*'''23 August to 2 November''': The [[Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference]]  is held in the [[Hague]]. Hatta dominates the Indonesian side of the negotiations,  earning admiration from all sides. A loose union of the Netherlands and RUSI is agreed upon, the [[Netherlands-Indonesian Union]], with the Dutch queen as a symbolic Head of State. Sukarno is named President with Hatta to as both Prime Minister and Vice-president. Dutch investments in Indonesia are provided with various guarantees with further agreement on the need for further financial consultations. Indonesia accepts continued Netherlands sovereignty over Dutch New Guinea, and also accepts responsibility for £4.3 billion of Dutch East Indies debt.
*'''August to December''': 12,000 Republican prisoners from Dutch jails are released.
*'''27 December''': The Netherlands formally transfers sovereignty over Indonesia, with the exception of [[Dutch New Guinea]], to the RUSI government. In celebration, the national flag is hoisted at the Independence Palace in a public ceremony.

==1950==
*'''23 January 1950''': [[Westerling]] and about 800 troops capture key points in [[Bandung]], but is persuaded by the Dutch High Commissioner and the commander of the Dutch garrison still in Bandung to withdraw the same day.
*'''24 January 1950''': A Westerling plot to attack the Indonesian cabinet and assassinate several of its members is uncovered. His troops infiltrate [[Jakarta]] after leaving Bandung, but they are driven out.

*'''February''': Westerling flees Indonesia in disguise.
*'''March''': Much of the smaller states now dissolved into the Republic. Hatta cabinet makes hasty legislative arrangements to cater for the shift to unitarism.
*'''early April''': Sultan Abdul Hamid II of Pontinak, head of the West Kalimantan state, is arrested as a major instigator in Westerling's plot. Authority of the state is taken over by the RUSI government, resulting in an increase of demands for merger with the Republic from residents and major business and social leaders.
*'''April''': Colonial soldiers (mostly [[Ambonese]]), clash with Republican units in Makassar.
*'''25 April''': Dr Soumokil proclaims an independent [[Republic of South Maluku]] (RMS) in Ambon.
