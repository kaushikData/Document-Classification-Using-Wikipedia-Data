The year '''1617 in [[music]]''' involved some significant events.

== Events ==
*[[January 6]] – ''[[The Vision of Delight]]'', a masque  written by [[Ben Jonson]] and designed by [[Inigo Jones]], is performed at [[Whitehall Palace]], probably for the first time on this date, with a second performance of January 19. The work features music by [[Nicholas Lanier]].
*[[January 16]] – [[Thomas Weelkes]], organist at [[Chichester Cathedral]], is dismissed for being drunk and disorderly.
*[[February 22]] –  ''[[Lovers Made Men]]'', another masque by Jonson, Jones, and Lanier, is performed. (Lanier's music for the masque may have featured recitatives throughout; if so, it would have been a significant precursor of English opera, but this cannot be certain as the music has not survived.)
*[[August 30]] – [[Alessandro Grandi]] is appointed singer at San Marco, Venice, at a salary of 80 ducats per annum, under choirmaster [[Claudio Monteverdi]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Roche and Roark Miller, "Grandi, Alessandro (i)", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (musicologist)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5350">The '''Art In Embassies Program''' ('''AIEP''') is a public-private partnership that promotes cultural diplomacy through exhibitions, permanent collections, site-specific commissions and two-way artist exchanges in more than 200 U.S. Embassies and Consulates around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clinton|first1=Hillary|title=The Diplomacy of Art|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2013/02/hillary-clinton-art-embassies|website=www.vanityfair.com|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through art, international audiences gain a sense of the quality, scope, and diversity of American and host country art and culture.

== Exhibition planning ==
The amount of money allotted for art in each building is calculated with a formula based on the gross square footage.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; AIEP's curatorial team develops thematic exhibitions in collaboration with each ambassador, taking into account the host country's artistic traditions and cultural mores. They recommend artists and works of art, negotiate all loans, and propose placement of the art within the embassy residences. After all loans are secured and the art insured, AIE's registrars coordinate with professional art handlers for the [[manufacturing|assembly]], [[Packaging and labeling|packing]], [[crating]] and safe [[shipment]] of each exhibition to post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Response to ABC 7 Questions on US Department of State's Art In Embassies Program|url=http://dig.abclocal.go.com/wls/documents/052114-wls-iteam-gov-spending-q&amp;a-doc.pdf|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1963, approximately 10,000 pieces of art have been placed in ambassador residences, embassies, and consulates throughout the world, including work by [[Maya Lin]], [[Jeff Koons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corcoran|first1=Joe|title=Art in Embassies Makes a Splash for 50th Anniversary|url=http://www.washdiplomat.com/DPouch/2013/January/story5artembassies.html|website=www.washdiplomat.com|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Martin Puryear]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Joel Shapiro]], [[Benjamin Abramowitz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = U.S. Department of State - Art in Embassies|url = http://art.state.gov/ArtistDetail.aspx?id=137324|website = art.state.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other prestigious artists.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Patricia|title=Employing Art Along With Ambassadors | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/27/arts/design/27embassy.html|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total value of art on loan to the embassy program is estimated at $200 million.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

== Artist exchanges / Residency programs ==
Initiated in 2002, the American Artists Abroad program was created to extend Art In Embassies' exhibitions beyond the walls of U.S. diplomatic residences into local communities. Participating American artists travel to countries where their work is exhibited and engage in a series of public cultural programming activities, such as lectures, workshops, and studio visits.

== Art collections by embassy ==

===Beijing===
The art in [[Embassy of the United States, Beijing|Beijing]] cost about $800,000 but has been appraised at $30 million. &lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; 

===London===
The program was criticized in 2013 when $1M was awarded for a sculpture at the [[U.S. Embassy]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2517666/US-State-Department-spends-1-MILLION-single-granite-sculpture-decorate-new-embassy-London.html&lt;/ref&gt; The project was subsequently scrapped because the sculpture was too heavy for the planned site.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/state-department-scraps-million-dollar-granite-sculpture-us-embassy-london_882544.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Philip Barling Greet''' (24 September 1857 – 17 May 1936), known professionally as '''Ben Greet''', was a [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] actor, director, and impresario.

==Early life==
The younger son of Captain William Greet [[Royal Navy|RN]] and his wife, Sarah Barling, Greet was born on board {{HMS|Crocodile|1825|6}}, a [[Royal Navy]] recruiting ship tied up at the [[Tower of London]].  He was the youngest of five sisters and two brothers. He was educated at the [[Royal Naval School]], [[New Cross]]. His parents planned to make him a naval officer or a [[clergy]]man, but instead he became a schoolmaster at a private school at [[Worthing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foulkes |first=Richard |chapter=Greet, Sir Philip Barling Ben (1857–1936), actor and theatre manager |title=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His brother, [[William Greet]], was a theatre manager while his other brother Thomas was the only sibling to continue on to have a career in the Royal Navy.

Ben Greet would visit the Greenwich and Woolwich theatres frequently to watch the exciting productions of Victorian melodrama, Shakespearean plays, farces and pantomimes. Some of the productions he might have seen as a young child were ''Light in the Dark'', ''Mariner's Compass'' and Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]'' around the year 1867.{{sfnp|Isaac|1964|p=15}} Greet was exposed to many dramas as a child, and he performed in plays at school. According to Isaac, Greet would "have tested his histrionic powers, giving his family and friends a taste of his quality, interpreting [characters] of Shakespeare's plays…".{{sfnp|Isaac|1964|p=17}} Yet, Greet did not perform on the professional stage until four years after his father's death in 1879.

==Acting career==
 
Greet performed in his first appearance as a professional actor in J.W. Gordon's Stock Company at the Theatre Royal in Southampton. He performed in an Irish melodrama and within the next day, he was assigned to play over twenty Shakespearean parts for an additional season. Then, for the next three years, Greet performed at the Theatre Royal in Margate, England where he was given the opportunity to work with the best artists of that time.{{sfnp|Isaac|1964|p=26}} After his three years performing in Margate, he went back to London to join Miss Wallis's Company at The Gaiety Theatre where they performed ''Cymbeline''. Ben Greet played, as ‘Caius Lucius' in the show, and it was this role that claimed to be Greet's first real debut in 1883.{{sfnp|Isaac|1964|p=28}} Later that year, Greet became a member of Minnie Palmer's Company at the Grand Theatre in Islington where he played ‘Dudley Harcourt' in ''My Sweetheart''. Although, his first major breakthrough role was the ‘Apothecary' in Mary Anderson's production of ''Romeo and Juliet'' at the Lyceum Theatre, which opened in 1884.{{sfnp|Isaac|1964|p=29}} The play ran for over one hundred nights, and the production was remembered as one of the most stunning performances of that time. From 1884 to until 1897, Greet played so many roles and moved to so many companies and theatres that it is hard to record them all. In just five years, Greet would have played over 300 roles in plays.{{sfnp|Isaac|1964|p=32}}

==Actor-manager career==
In 1883 Greet launched his career by first creating [[The Ben Greet Players]], his own company.  They would perform open-air productions of the classic English stage repertory. They first produced tours throughout England, performing in college gardens, the parks of great houses, and village greens. Popularity rose for The Ben Greet Players, and after twenty years of touring with outdoor productions of Shakespeare in England, Ben Greet was traveling with his troupe to tour in America. [[File:Ben Greet Meeting.jpg|thumb|The Ben Greet Players at the White House (1911)]] [[File:Ben Greet Players.jpg|thumb|Advertisement in the [[Daily Illini]] for the Ben Greet Players]]
In May of 1914, the "Ben Greet Players" presented two Shakespearean plays on the campus of the College of Industrial Arts, a women's college in Denton Texas. According to a letter dated May 5, 1914 by a student at the college, "...one of them will be given in the afternoon and the other at night.  The "Ben Greet Players" is a traveling company that goes to the various colleges and universities of the country to play."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to family  of May 5, 1914 from TVF CIA student&lt;/ref&gt; 

Greet's alfresco productions were the first tours organized to bring professional actors to college campuses in America.  The American tour was even rewarding enough for The Ben Greet Players to perform for President Roosevelt on the White House front lawn.

Greet returned to England in 1903 for a short time and managed more tours before beginning another American tour in 1904.  They performed plays such as ''[[Everyman (play)|Everyman]]'', ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' and ''The Star of Bethlehem'' in locations including Boston and New York.  By 1914, the year that Greet returned to England, before the First World War, Greet commenced in the management of the Old Vic Theatre.

==Directing career==

In his four seasons at the Old Vic, Greet produced and directed 35 plays, including 23 by Shakespeare, plus [[Oliver Goldsmith|Goldsmith's]] ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]],'' [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan's]] ''[[The Rivals]]'' and ''[[The School for Scandal]],'' the Medieval [[mystery play]] ''The Star of Bethlehem,'' and [[Everyman (play)|''Everyman'']] among other works.{{sfnp|Rowell|1993|pp=168–169}}  When Greet was still a director at the Old Vic, he also focused on changing the perspectives of children on their views of Shakespeare. During Greet's years working at the Old Vic, there were over 400 schools that worked in connection with the theatre.{{sfnp|Isaac|1964|p=163}} The Education Committee of Britain, in 1929, declared that theatre facilities should be renewed to allow children to experience Shakespeare performances "as a reinforcement of the school curriculum and a stimulus to literary appreciation".{{sfnp|Isaac|1964|p=168}} Over 20,000 elementary school students, along with their teachers, were given the chance to see one Shakespeare show during their school term. Due to this arrangement, Greet was able to share the spectacle that is Shakespeare with over a million children. The program  continued for many years as many Education Committees in London sponsored it. Greet was knighted in 1929 by King George V for his works involving the Old Vic theatre and his overall devotion to Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=33501 |date=31 May 1929 |page=3666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is commemorated by a [[blue plaque]] on the façade of 160 [[Lambeth Road]], London, where he lived from 1920 until his death in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-204413-156-158-and-160-lambeth |title=156,158 and 160, Lambeth Rd. |author=[[English Heritage]] |work=British Listed Buildings |year=2011 |accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven '''Books of Remembrance''' housed in the [[Peace Tower#Memorial Chamber|Memorial Chamber]] in the [[Peace Tower]] of the Canadian [[Parliament Hill|Parliament Buildings]] in [[Ottawa]] are [[illuminated manuscript]] volumes recording the names of members of the [[Canadian Forces]] and [[Canadian Merchant Navy]] killed on active service in wartime, and in other conflicts.&lt;ref name="thecanadianencyclopedia.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/monuments-of-the-first-and-second-world-wars/ |title=Monuments of the First and Second World Wars |accessdate=2011-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810091629/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0009128 |archivedate=2011-08-10 |df= }} Canadian Encyclopedia Monuments, World Wars I and II&lt;/ref&gt; There are seven separate Books, beginning with the first listing the names of the dead from the First World War.&lt;ref name=cbc2015/&gt;

The display case for the first Book was designed by [[John A.

Made of bronze, enamel and other metals, it is decorated with four kneeling angels and a ribbon encircling a laurel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =Books of Remembrance display case| work =National Inventory of Military Memorials| publisher =National Defence Canada| date =2008-04-16| url =http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=8303| format =| doi =| accessdate =| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030338/http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh%2Ddhp/nic%2Dinm/sm%2Drm/mdsr%2Drdr%2Deng.asp?PID%3D8303| dead-url =yes| archivedate =2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It rests on an altar of English [[Hopton Wood stone|Hoptonwood limestone]] that was a British gift to Canada, situated at the centre of the chamber.&lt;ref name=cbc2015/&gt; Later books are displayed on altars of Hoptonwood stone and bronze, decorated with poppies, located against the walls of the chamber.&lt;ref name=cbc2015/&gt;

==Conception of the books==
During the [[World War I|First World War]] on July 1, 1917, Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]] announced a [[Peace Tower#Memorial Chamber|Memorial Chamber]] would be included in the soon-to-be constructed Peace Tower, part of the rebuild of the [[Centre Block]] of the [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Parliament Hill|parliament buildings]] after a [[Centre Block#Great fire|1916 fire]]. He said that it would be a "memorial to the debt of our forefathers and to the valour of those Canadians who, in the Great War, fought for the liberties of Canada, of the Empire, and of humanity".

Although it was originally hoped to inscribe the names of the dead Canadians upon the walls of the chamber, it was decided that it was more practical to follow Colonel A. Fortesque Duguid's idea to house Books of Remembrance inside the chamber instead.&lt;ref name="archives web"&gt;

[[File:Altar of Remembrance.jpg|thumb|right|The altar upon which sits the First World War Book of Remembrance]]

On August 3, 1927, while in Ottawa, [[Edward VIII|Prince Albert Edward (later King Edward VIII)]] unveiled an altar, a gift from the British government, upon which the book of the First World War would rest. The stone for the steps came from quarries in [[Flanders Fields]]&lt;!-- Please leave this be. The stone did not come the Flanders Field American Cemetery which is where this was redirecting to but from the Flanders Fields region --&gt; and the brass nameplates were cast from spent [[Casing (ammunition)|shell casing]]s from the war.&lt;ref name="archives web"/&gt;

===Illumination===
All the books have some illumination; those for the two world wars having the most, with each page having a wide border at the top decorated with plant motifs, usually leaves, and a unit badge.  Other books only have illumination on the title page.

==The Books==
[[File:Book of remembrance.jpg|thumb|left|A view of one of the Books of Remembrance]]

===First World War===
The Book of the First World War is the largest of the books, containing 66,655 names.  It took [[London, Ontario]] native James Purves eleven years to gather the necessary materials to begin work on the book, and upon his death in 1940, work passed to his assistant [[Alan Beddoe]], who completed the book by 1942.  (Beddoe would spend the next thirty years of his life as the chief artist of the books, dying in 1975.) Contributors to the first book included [[Evelyn Lambart]], who would go on to become an animator at the [[National Film Board of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/women/002026-705-e.html ''Canadian Women in Film'', Collections Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916065606/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/women/002026-705-e.html |date=2009-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second World War===
In 1948, it was announced that a second book would be created to memorialize the 44,893 Canadians who had died in the [[World War I|Second World War]]. This time Beddoe was given a chief assistant, five assistant artists, two writers, an accounting officer and a proof-reader to help with the book, scheduled to be completed in 1952. A series of delays, however, slowed the progress of the book - notably after the government decided that work should be restarted in 1951, to re-write all the names, this time including the abbreviations of individual regiments. The book was completed in 1957, and that [[Remembrance Day]] was placed in the Memorial Chamber alongside the first book.&lt;ref name="thecanadianencyclopedia.com"/&gt;

In 1959, humidity destroyed the [[bookbinding|binding]]s of the two World War books, requiring them to be re-bound.&lt;ref name="archives web"/&gt;

A second volume for the 7th Book of Remembrance in currently in production.

The current calligrapher for the 7th Book of Remembrance, Vol. I &amp; II is Ottawa, Ontario resident, Richard Draffin.

===Newfoundland===
The [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] book, commemorating over 2300 Newfoundlanders who gave their lives in the First and Second World War (before Newfoundland became a province of Canada), was placed in the Memorial Chamber in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/a-changed-canada-emerged-from-the-first-world-war/article36985156/ "A changed Canada emerged from the First World War"]. Tim Cook, ''The Globe and Mail'', November 15, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korean War===
516 Canadians lost their lives in the [[Korean War]] (1950-1953).

===South African War and Nile Expedition===
Canada's first overseas war, the '''Nile Expedition for the Relief of [[Charles George Gordon|General Gordon]]''' (1884-1885) claimed 16 lives from a Canadian force of 400.  Of the 7,000 Canadian troops deployed in the [[Second Boer War|South African War]], about 250 died and are listed in the book.

===Merchant Navy===
From the [[Canadian Merchant Navy]], more than 570 Canadian men and women died during the First World War and more than 1600 during the Second World War.  This book was dedicated in 1993.

===7th book, "In the Service of Canada"===
A seventh Book of Remembrance, dedicated on November 11, 2005, lists members of the Canadian Forces who have died on active duty in the service of Canada (other than those already covered by the Korean War book) since the close of the Second World War book.  Unlike the others, which were designed after the end of each period of hostilities, the seventh book is ongoing and is expected to continue "for generations to come".&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8128">'''Bottled Ocean''' was an exhibition of work by New Zealand artists of Pacific Island descent that was shown at a number of metropolitan art galleries in New Zealand in 1994-1995. It featured the work artists who have become notable figures in New Zealand and internationally.

==Curatorial intent==

Jim Vivieaere, a New Zealand artist of Rarotongan descent, was commissioned by touring exhibition company Exhibitour to curate an exhibition of contemporary Pacific Island artists. [[City Gallery Wellington]] was a partner in the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bottled Ocean|url=http://citygallery.org.nz/exhibitions/bottled-ocean|website=City Gallery Wellington|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Te Ara'&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahina-Tuai|first1=Kolokesa Uafa|title=Pacific arts in New Zealand - Visual art and literature'|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/44240/bottled-ocean-1994|website=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=16 June 2015|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition was not a straightforward survey or 'celebration' of Pacific artists. Organising the exhibition turned Vivieaere into a spokesperson or authority on Pacific Island art, a position he was uneasy with.&lt;ref name ='Paradise'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chiu|first1=Melissa|last2=Stevenson|first2=Karen|last3=Mason|first3=Ngahiraka|last4=Vercoe|first4=Caroline|title=Paradise now? : contemporary art from the Pacific|date=2004|publisher=David Bateman in association with Asia Society|location=Auckland|isbn=1869535847}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|26}} He was concerned that the exhibition could lead to artists being pigeon-holed or 'ghettoised' or that stereotypes of the 'exotic' Pacific could be reinforced.&lt;ref name ='Paradise'/&gt;{{Rp|26–27}} In one interview Vivieaere said that the ‘only reason we are here is that we are Polynesian – not on our merits but because we’re the "other"…. We don’t need Polynesian shows. I would like to see it as the last.’&lt;ref name ='Te Ara'/&gt;

==Artists==

Vivieaere selected a broad range of artists who worked in a variety of media and were at different stages of their careers.&lt;ref name='Te Ara'/&gt; Most of them were born in New Zealand but had ties to [[Samoa]], [[Niue]], the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Tonga]].&lt;ref name ='Mallon'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mallon|first1=Sean|last2=Pereira|first2=Pandora Fulimalo|title=Speaking in colour : conversations with artists of Pacific Island heritage|date=1997|publisher=Te Papa Press|location=Wellington|isbn=0909010447}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|36}}

Twenty-three artists formed the core exhibition:

*[[Fatu Feu'u]]
*William Furneaux
*Patriq Futialo
*Bruce George
*[[Niki Hastings-McFall]]
*[[Ioane Ioane]]
*[[Lily Laita]]
*Iosefa Leo
*Simmie Nichols
*Johnny Peninsula
*Lyle Peninsula
*Laugutu Poloai
*[[John Pule]]
*[[Ani O'Neill]]
*Albert Refiti
*Toegamau Tom Sefo
*Greg Semu
*Tania Short
*[[Sopolemalama Filipe Tohi|Filipe Tohi]]
*[[Michel Tuffery]]
*Lape Fakalaga Tulisi
*Veronica Vaevae
*Loretta Young

As the exhibition progressed other artists were added including Evotia Tamu, Sheyne Tuffery, Luana Asiata, Sasha Kronfeld, Glenda Vilisoni, Sale Jessop and the musical group Grace (made up of brothers Anthony, Jason and Paul Ioasa).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grace - profile|url=http://www.audioculture.co.nz/people/grace|website=AudioCulture|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Display==

''Bottled Ocean'' launched at City Gallery Wellington in 1994 and toured to [[Auckland Art Gallery]], Waikato Art Gallery (now [[Waikato Museum]]), the Manawatu Art Gallery (now [[Te Manawa]]) and the McDougall Art Annex (now [[Christchurch Art Gallery]]) throughout 1994 and 1995.&lt;ref name='Paradise'/&gt;{{Rp|33}}

Vivieaere changed the display of the exhibition for each location. At City Gallery Wellington the works were displayed on a mirrored floor behind a perspex wall, mimicking museum cabinets or shop window displays. and creating a forced distance between the art and the viewer.&lt;ref name ='Mallon'/&gt;{{Rp|136}} At the Auckland Art Gallery a mirrored floor was used and some of the works remained in their travelling crates or were partly unpacked.&lt;ref name='Te Ara'/&gt; At the Robert McDougall Art Annex Michel Tuffery's sculpture ''Pisupo Lua Afe'', a life-size bull made out of flattened corned-beef cans, was positioned as if it was gazing at a wall of art works like a visitor.&lt;ref name='Paradise'/&gt;{{Rp|26}}

==Reception and influence==

''Bottled Ocean'' has been noted for being one of the first exhibitions to focus on contemporary Pacific artists and for its underlying concerns. The exhibition was discussed at length in the publication accompanying ''Paradise Now: Contemporary Art from the Pacific'', the first major exhibition of contemporary Pacific art to show in a United States museum. It is also discussed in the recent book ''Art in Oceania: A New History'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Bottled Ocean'' made the 'arrival' of contemporary Pacific art in the elite galleries of the New Zealand art world a problem to be reflected upon, rather than simply a triumph to celebrate. Having been invited to survey the work of Pacific migrants, Vivieaere turned the exhibition into something of an installation, a work of art in its own right, in which he used various exhibitionary devices to make the desire for 'cultural difference' and 'otherness', which had become broadly topical in the artworld, the implicit subject of the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brunt|first1=Peter|last2=Nicholas|first2=Thomas|title=Art in Oceania : a new history|date=2013|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|isbn=0500239010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|432}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reviewing the exhibition for ''Art AsiaPacific'' Wendy Vaigro wrote

&lt;blockquote&gt;As the ostensible organising principle of ''Bottled Ocean'', 'Pacific Islandness' is utilised as a term that references, ironically, attempts to homogenise Polynesian artists working in New Zealand. ... In challenging the closure of aesthetic and political categories and conventional curatorial practices, Jim Vivieaere creates ''Bottled Ocean'' as a meta-exhibition. The result is a subtle and thoughtful show that eludes ideological control and authoritative discourse at every turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vaigro|first1=Wendy|title=''Bottled Ocean": Shape Shifting|journal=Art AsiaPacific|date=1995|volume=2|issue=4|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a review for ''Art New Zealand'', [[Nicholas Thomas]] investigated Vivieaere's reference to a 'modern tribal art market' in the brochure accompanying the exhibition.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Nicholas|title=Pacific Dualities: Bottled Ocean in Wellington and Auckland|journal=Art New Zealand|date=Autumn 1995|issue=74|pages=46–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that 'the work in ''Bottled Ocean'' is produced for and around a market - not just an art market, but a contemporary global cultural market, a multicultural theatre in which identities, signatures, nationalities and lifestyles are affirmed, celebrated, changed and consumed.'.&lt;ref name ='Thomas'/&gt;{{Rp|46}} He continued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The mainstream audience may be primarily interested in the tropical colourfulness of the work, in the apparent conformity of its spirituality with New Age environmentalism, in its exoticism. Artists appear to have responded to this interest by making exoticism visually explicit through the use of readily recognizable Polynesian motifs. ... The distinctive accomplishment of ''Bottled Ocean'' lies in its direct but subtle challenge to this consumerist interest interest in Pacific art and culture.&lt;ref name ='Thomas'/&gt;{{Rp|47–48}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:george-baker-bridget-doyly-carte.jpg|right|thumb|300px|With [[George Baker (baritone)|George Baker]] at a Gilbert and Sullivan Society celebration in 1964]]

'''Dame Bridget Cicely D'Oyly Carte''', [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire|DBE]] (25 March 1908 – 2 May 1985), was the granddaughter of impresario [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] and the only daughter of [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]].  She was head of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] from 1948 until 1982.

Though as a child she was not enthusiastic about [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], after her father's death in 1948, Bridget D'Oyly Carte inherited the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, which performed and controlled the copyrights to the joint works of [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Arthur Sullivan]], as well as all of her family's business interests.  She had begun to assist her father in managing the [[Savoy Hotel]] in 1933, also undertaking child welfare work.  

She hired [[Frederic Lloyd]] as general manager of the opera company in 1951 and moved to keep the [[Savoy opera]]s fresh, marketing them as a bridge between popular and classical music.  After the copyrights to the Gilbert and Sullivan works expired in 1961, she transferred the opera company to a charitable trust that she headed.  Mounting losses, and the refusal of the Arts Council to provide a grant, forced the closure of the company in 1982, although the company re-formed after Carte's death and mounted several productions up to 2003.

In 1972, Carte founded the D'Oyly Carte Charitable Trust to support charitable causes in the fields of the arts, medical welfare and the environment.  She was created a [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire|DBE]] in 1975.  With no children of her own or surviving siblings, she was the end of her family line.

==Life and career==
Bridget Cicely D'Oyly Carte was born at Suffolk Street, [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], London, and educated in England and abroad. Her father was [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]], and her mother was the former Lady Dorothy Milner Gathorne-Hardy (1889–1977), the youngest daughter of the [[John Stewart Gathorne-Hardy, 2nd Earl of Cranbrook|2nd Earl of Cranbrook]].&lt;ref name=Obit&gt;Obituary notice, ''[[The Times]]'', 3 May 1985, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Her grandfather was [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], who founded the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]].&lt;ref&gt;D'Oyly "was a forename (not part of a double surname)". Jacobs, Arthur. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32311, "Carte, Richard D'Oyly (1844–1901)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 12 September 2008, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/32311}}. The name comes from her grandfather's great grandmother, Elizabeth D'Oyly, who was a descendant of Peregrine D'Oyly of Overbury Hall in [[Layham]], Suffolk (c. 1625–1667).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Savoy Hotel, London.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The [[Savoy Hotel]]]]
In 1926, when she was only 18, she married her first cousin, John David Gathorne-Hardy, the fourth [[Earl of Cranbrook]] (1900–1978),&lt;ref&gt;Both were grandchildren of [[John Stewart Gathorne-Hardy, 2nd Earl of Cranbrook]].&lt;/ref&gt; an explorer and naturalist. As a result of her marriage, Carte was styled as Countess of Cranbrook, and her married name was Gathorne-Hardy.&lt;ref&gt;Lundy, Darryl, ed. [http://thepeerage.com/p3563.htm#i35621 "Bridget Cicely Carte"], ThePeerage.com, 28 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; They soon separated and finally divorced in 1931; she relinquished her title and resumed her maiden name by [[deed poll]] in 1932, also dropping the name Cicely, which she disliked.&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U163678 "D'Oyly Carte, Dame Bridget"], ''Who Was Who'', A &amp; C Black, 1920–2008; online edition @ ukwhoswho.com, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 30 March 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then resumed her education at [[Dartington Hall]] in Devon from 1931 to 1933, a school with a long musical tradition, taking courses in dance, teacher training, art and design.  There she met designer [[Peter Goffin]] who became a long-time friend.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Taylor, C. M. P. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31046 "Carte, Dame Bridget Cicely D'Oyly (1908–1985)"], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (2004), Oxford University Press, accessed 20 June 2009. {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accidental death of her only brother, Michael (1911–1932), made Carte the heir to her father's hotel and theatre interests.  As a child, however, she had been reluctant to assume the family legacy.  She later told ''The Gramophone'' magazine:  "At home, you know, we weren't allowed to ''hum'' Gilbert and Sullivan; in fact we were fined for it, because it annoyed my father. We were allowed to sing it properly, but my brother and I couldn't – in my family the fact that I wasn't Mozart at about three years old was thought of as rather disappointing. So I went through a phase when I was very anti-Gilbert and Sullivan; I became rather a highbrow, and my father thought I was a bit of a snake-in-the-grass because of it."&lt;ref&gt;"Wimbush, Roger. [http://www.gramophone.net/Issue/Page/March%201975/33/838552 "Here and There"], ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|The Gramophone]]'', March 1975, pp. 1630–33 (p. 33 in online version), accessed 22 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1933 to 1939, Carte was an assistant to her father at the [[Savoy Hotel]], taking responsibility for furnishing and interior decoration, for which she had training and aptitude.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt; Upon the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], however, she undertook child welfare work and continued with it until her father's death in 1948.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; The family home was [[Coleton Fishacre]], a house that her parents had built in [[Devon]] between [[Paignton]] and [[Kingswear]] in 1925.  The house is still known for its design features and garden with exotic tropical plants.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'', 25 October 2007, pp. 78–80&lt;/ref&gt;  

After her parents' divorce in 1941, Bridget D'Oyly Carte took over the house, which her father, who lived in London, would visit for long weekends.  Shortly after her father's death, she sold Coleton Fishacre, and it is now owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-coletonfishacrehouseandgarden "Coleton Fishacre"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217084145/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-coletonfishacrehouseandgarden# |date=17 December 2009 }}, National Trust, accessed 30 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 she bought [[Shrubs Wood]], Chalfont St Giles, [[Buckinghamshire]], designed by the architects [[Erich Mendelsohn]] and [[Serge Chermayeff]].  Here she pursued her love of gardening and gave summer parties for disadvantaged or disabled children.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt; In 1953, Carte was a member of the committee overseeing the decorations for the Coronation Ball at the [[Savoy Hotel]] in honour of the coronation of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 15 November 1952, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Managing the family interests===
When her father died in 1948, she inherited all his interests including the Savoy Hotel group and [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company|the family's opera company]], which presented the [[Savoy Operas]] from 1875 to 1982. She did not succeed Rupert D'Oyly Carte as chairman of the Savoy Hotel group, in which she retained a large shareholding, but she became an active director. She moved into a suite in the Savoy Hotel and resumed control of the furnishing and decoration departments. When the Savoy Group acquired them, she took interest in the soft-furnishing company, James Edwards, and was chairman of the royal florists, Edward Goodyear Ltd.  She became vice-chairman of the Group in 1971 and was its president at the time of her death.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt;

At first, Bridget D'Oyly Carte "did not feel qualified to sustain the responsibility" of running the opera company.&lt;ref name=Mander&gt;Mander and Mitchenson, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, she was determined to prove herself.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, Frederic. "The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company – How it Works" in ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Journal'', 8/14, May 1964, pp. 220–21&lt;/ref&gt; One of her early decisions proved especially unpopular and led to a wave of important defections from the company at the end of the [[Festival of Britain]] season in 1951, most importantly, [[Martyn Green]].  This was the 1949 hiring, as stage director, of [[Eleanor Evans]], Mrs. [[Darrell Fancourt]], known as "Snookie" in the company.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. v&lt;/ref&gt; Green wrote in 1952: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I ... told Miss Carte that I thought she was making a great psychological error.  During [[Anna Bethell]]'s regime (Mrs. [[Sydney Granville]]), there had been growing signs of discontent and suggestions of favouritism.... But to appoint not only a woman who had for fifteen years worked in the chorus alongside several who were now principals, but the wife of one of the main principals, seemed to me to be a psychological error of the first magnitude.  I felt that ... she would, rightly or wrongly, be accused of that very same favouritism.  My views made no impression on Miss Carte, but time was to prove that I was right....  Production is done to a plan that takes no consideration of the individual, his personality or his histrionic ability – a stereotyped plan that results in a clockwork performance devoid of spontaneity.&lt;ref&gt;Green, pp. 236–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The historian Tony Joseph wrote: "But Green was not the only member of the Company to leave....  [[Ella Halman]] left too.  So did [[Richard Watson (singer)|Richard Watson]] ... Margaret Mitchell ... [[Radley Flynn]] and no fewer than twenty-two other small part players and choristers.  It was the largest single exodus of performers in D'Oyly Carte history, and that was why the sense of sadness that hovered over the season was so marked....  August 1951 was the end of an era.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Cynthia Morey, who joined the Company just before the defections, wrote: "I have never found out precisely why this great exodus took place....  We were always under the impression that we should feel honoured to be in the employ of the D’Oyly Carte Opera Company; it was patently obvious that the management held firmly to the policy that nobody is indispensable".&lt;ref&gt;Morey, pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt;  Morey noted that Evans had played several roles with the company and commented, "In 1927 she was apparently demoted to the chorus, and there she remained for [fifteen years]. ...  I should not have thought these qualifications sufficient for such an important post; to spend all those years as a chorister seems to signify a lack of ambition or achievement.  But I suppose a 'Director of Productions' in those days merely needed to know every move and every gesture, and exactly when they occurred, for no departure from the set production was ever permitted."&lt;ref&gt;Morey, pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Walker (singer)|Richard Walker]], [[Kenneth Sandford]] and others also criticised Evans's temperament and methods.  She retired as stage director in 1953, the year that her husband died, but she was engaged to coach new D'Oyly Carte principals in their roles for some years thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, David. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/E/EvansEleanor.htm "Eleanor Evans",] ''Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company'', 24 June 2002; accessed 26 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watt, John. [http://pinafore.www3.50megs.com/k-sandford-fav.html "The Ones that I Like"], Interview with Sandford, at the Memories of the D'Oyly Carte website, reproduced from ''The Savoyard'', Vol. XI, No. 2, September 1972&lt;/ref&gt; 

Carte made an important move to hire [[Frederic Lloyd]] as general manager in 1951, which position he continued to discharge until the company closed.  In running the D'Oyly Carte Opera company she took steps to keep the productions fresh, engaging designers to redesign the costumes and scenery.  Her old friend, Peter Goffin, who had previously redesigned ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' and ''[[Ruddigore]]'' for Rupert D'Oyly Carte, designed a unit set in 1957 to facilitate and reduce the cost of touring.  He also produced new settings and costumes for ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' (1957), ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1958 – settings only, most of the celebrated [[Charles Ricketts]] costumes being retained), ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1958), ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' (1959), ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1961), and ''[[Iolanthe]]'' (1961).  ''[[Princess Ida]]'' was redesigned by James Wade in 1954.&lt;ref name=Mander/&gt;

Carte claimed that the most important function of the operas, which in later years she advertised rather as musicals, was "to bridge the generation gap and link serious music to pop."&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times'', 1 March 1981&lt;/ref&gt; She televised and had recordings and films made of some of the operas, engaged [[Malcolm Sargent|Sir Malcolm Sargent]] to conduct performances at the [[Festival of Britain]] season in 1951 at the operas' original London home, the [[Savoy Theatre]], and supported an increasing number of tours of the United States.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; In 1960 the company's own touring orchestra was formed as a change from the ad hoc recruitment of players at each venue.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt; In 1975 the company produced a centenary season at the Savoy Theatre, in 1977 it gave a royal [[Royal Command Performance]] at [[Windsor Castle]], and in 1979, for the first time, it toured Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
With the approaching end of the D'Oyly Carte monopoly on [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] performances, when the copyright on Gilbert's words expired in 1961, Carte set up the charitable D'Oyly Carte Opera Trust to continue to present the operas.  She endowed the trust with the company's scenery, costumes, band parts, recording rights and other assets, together with a cash endowment of £30,000.  She formed Bridget D'Oyly Carte Ltd to manage the opera company, with herself as chairman and managing director.  Finally, mounting losses, and the refusal of the Arts Council to provide a grant, forced the closure of the company in 1982.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; Even after it closed, however, the company's productions and style continued to influence the productions of other companies.&lt;ref name=bradley/&gt;

[[File:DOCplanter.jpg|left|350px|thumb|Planter in front of the [[Savoy Hotel]] in honour of Carte and her family]]
In 1972, she founded the D'Oyly Carte Charitable Trust – entirely separate from the D'Oyly Carte Opera Trust and the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company – supporting charitable causes in the fields of the arts, medical welfare and the environment. In 2001, the trust endowed the D'Oyly Carte Chair in Medicine and the Arts at [[King's College London]] with £2 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/news_details.php?news_id=129&amp;year=2001 "First UK Chair in Medicine and the Arts"], King's College, London, 29 March 2001, accessed 30 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 she was elected an Honorary Member of the [[Royal Society of Musicians]] of Great Britain, and in 1975 was created a [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire|DBE]].  

In the 1970s, Carte became the tenant of the semi-ruined [[Barscobe Castle]], [[Balmaclellan]], a small seventeenth-century fortified house in south-west Scotland, which she restored.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt; Always shy, old-fashioned and formal, Carte appreciated simplicity and avoided parties and social events as much as possible.  For her ''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]]'' entry she listed her recreations as, "country living and gardening; reading, theatre and music."&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
A heavy smoker, Carte died of lung cancer in her country home in Shrubs Wood, [[Buckinghamshire]] in 1985, aged 77. Her remains were cremated. She left a fortune of £5,479,888.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; With no children of her own or surviving siblings, she was the end of her family line. The Savoy hotel group continued under the control of her trustees until 1994.&lt;ref name=billions&gt;Prynn, Jonathan. [http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23676788-details/Savoy+%27up+for+sale%27+as+Saudi+owner%27s+billions+dwindle/article.do "Savoy 'up for sale' as Saudi owner's billions dwindle"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419060158/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23676788-details/Savoy+'up+for+sale'+as+Saudi+owner's+billions+dwindle/article.do# |date=19 April 2009 }}, 16 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The group's hotels remained among the most prestigious in London, with the ''[[Evening Standard|London Evening Standard]]'' calling the Savoy "London's most famous hotel" in 2009.&lt;ref name=billions/&gt;  

A legacy of £1 million from her private fortune enabled a new opera company, using the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company name, to begin operations in 1988.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt; The company secured sponsorship from Sir [[Michael Bishop (businessman)|Michael Bishop]], who eventually became chairman of the Board of Trustees, and [[BMI (airline)|BMI]] British Midland Airways (of which Bishop is chairman).&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;Bradley (2005), pp. 53–69&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1988 to 2003 the new company produced short seasons each year, mounting productions of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas on tour and in London, as well as operettas by [[Jacques Offenbach]], [[Franz Lehár]] and [[Johann Strauss II]]. The new company did not employ many of the members of the original company and did not follow its performing traditions, even staging some "concept" productions of the operas.

'''Cameron Chisholm Nicol''' ('''CCN''') is an Australian multi-disciplinary architecture practice. Established in Perth in 1884 by [[James William Wright]], the firm has operated continuously in Western Australia since that time. The Brisbane office was opened in 1986. The two offices are no longer linked, and operate as separate entities. 

== History ==

In 1884, [[James William Wright]] opened a private architectural practice in [[Perth]], [[Western Australia]], which was the only one in the colony at the time. He had arrived in the colony three years earlier, from [[South Australia]], and had completed government contracts for engineering projects in both colonies. The first commission for the new firm, known as '''J. W. Wright &amp; Co.''', was [[Woodbridge House]], which [[Charles Harper (politician)|Charles Harper]] had built on the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]] near [[Guildford, Western Australia|Guildford]]. It designed a wide range of buildings over the following decades, including office buildings, hotels, banks, grandstands, and the [[York Town Hall]]. In 1906, Wright accepted two of his former apprentices as partners, and the firm became known as '''Wright, Powell &amp; Cameron'''.&lt;ref name="ccn"&gt;[http://ccnwa.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AA-Sept-1984-100-Years-Cameron-Chisholm-Nicol.pdf "100 years of history"], Cameron Chisholm &amp; Nicol, September 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Wright's name was dropped after his death in 1917, and the company was known as just '''Powell &amp; Cameron''' until 1930, when Oswald Chisholm became a partner and the firm's name was changed to '''Powell, Cameron &amp; Chisholm'''.&lt;ref name=chisholmhouseheritagecouncilwa&gt;{{cite web|last=Ward|first=Christine|title=Chisholm House|url=http://inherit.stateheritage.wa.gov.au/Public/Content/PdfLoader.aspx?id=82aaa484-5142-4262-961a-21c6a9a5398d&amp;type=assessment|work=Heritage Council of Western Australia|accessdate=5 May 2014|page=4,9|date=2003-08-26}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=deathsaa&gt;{{cite journal|title=Deaths {{!}} Architecture AU|journal=Architecture Australia|volume=88|issue=1|url=http://architectureau.com/articles/deaths/|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, Oswald Chisholm’s son Ross began work in the practice, working with Gil Nicol.&lt;ref name=deathsaa /&gt; Ross Chisholm became a partner in the practice in 1958.&lt;ref name=chisholmhouseheritagecouncilwa /&gt;

In 1986, managing director Henry Peel established an office in [[Brisbane]] operating under the name CCN Group (QLD) Pty Ltd.  Designs for which it has been commissioned include The Australian Chancery and Ambassadors residence in Brasilia. The company's architects acted as key consultants to the Urban Development Authority in Malaysia. CCN Group has designed projects internationally in China, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Iran, Jakarta, Japan, Malaysia and Yemen.

In 2018, the directors of the Perth office are Dominic Snellgrove (Managing Director), Gavin Broom (Practice Manager), Keat Tan (Design Director) and Peter Keleman.

== Notable projects ==

The firm's first commission building was [[Woodbridge House]] in Guildford in 1885. Since that time the firm has designed many structures. Some of the better known projects are:

The [[Reid Library]], at the [[University of Western Australia]], was awarded a RIBA Gold Medal in 1964. Gil Nicol was the leading architect on the project, as he was for many Perth buildings, including the Alexander Library, Wesfarmers Building and the Metropolitan Water Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reid Library - 50 Facts, 50 Years|url=http://www.is.uwa.edu.au/about/reid-50#3|work=The University of Western Australia|accessdate=6 May 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 the firm designed the award-winning National Carillon tower in Canberra, which was a gift to Australia from Britain and was constructed on [[Aspen Island]] in [[Lake Burley Griffin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Carillon|url=http://www.nationalcapital.gov.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=233&amp;Itemid=198|work=National Capital Authority|accessdate=6 May 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allendale Square in Perth was designed by Cameron Chisholm Nicol in 1970 and was completed in 1976. The building has been celebrated with awards including the RAIA (WA Chapter) Architecture Design Award and Bronze Medal Award as well as the ACI Energy Conservation Award and Alcoa of Australia Award for Architecture. In 2018 Allendale Square received the WA Architecture Awards Richard Roach Jewel Award for Enduring Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Allendale Square - Nationally Significant 20th-Century Architecture|url=http://www.architecture.com.au/docs/default-source/wa-notable-buildings/allendale-square.pdf|work=Australian Institute of Architects|accessdate=6 May 2014|date=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; I

===Perth Arena===
In 2012, Cameron Chisholm Nicol in joint venture with ARM Architecture completed the Perth Arena. The Arena received Australia's most prestigious architecture award, the Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture, at the AIA National Architecture Awards in 2013, along with the Emil Sodersten Award for Interior Architecture. In the 2013 WA Architecture Awards, the building was awarded The George Temple Poole Award for best building overall, and The Jeffrey Howlett Award for Public Architecture. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/perth-arena-architects-claim-top-prize-at-wa-architecture-awards/story-fnhocxo3-1226675005188 "Perth Arena architects claim top prize at WA Architecture Awards".

The '''Canadian Guild of Potters''' was a non-profit organization of Canadian ceramic artists that was active from 1936 to 1978.

==Foundation==

The founding members of the Canadian Guild of Potters were Nunzia D'Angelo, Robert Montgomery and [[Bobs Cogill Haworth]]. 
Howarth was the first honorary president, Montgomery was chairman and Molly Satterly was secretary. 
Although representing itself as a national organization, most of the early members were based in Toronto.{{sfn|Crawford|1998|p=44}}
The Guild held its first meeting on 20 March 1936. [[Mary Dignam]]'s representative invited them to become an affiliate of the [[Women's Art Association of Canada]] (WAAC) and to hold their meetings in the WAAC building at 23 Prince Arthur Avenue in Toronto.{{sfn|McLeod|1999|p=163}}
Shortly after being founded, in 1936 the Canadian Guild of Potters decided to join the [[Canadian Handicrafts Guild]], based in Montreal.{{sfn|McLeod|1999|p=270}}{{sfn|XV - Handicrafts 1951|p=235}}

==Activities==
[[File:Bailey Leslie at the Wheel - First Demonstration by the Canadian Guild of Potters at Eaton’s College Street Store, Toronto 1940.jpg|thumb|Bailey Leslie at the Wheel - First Demonstration by the Canadian Guild of Potters at Eaton's College Street Store, Toronto 1940]]
In the early years most of the members were amateurs and quality was a concern.  In 1943 Pearl McCarthy wrote in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', "If this art craft is to advance in quality and number of workers it will need the kind of new member who is willing to take both chemistry and art seriously."
Outside Quebec, this amateur image was an ongoing problem, although professionalism grew steadily over the years. Nunzia D'Angelo made great efforts to ensure that members could exhibit on the Ceramic National exhibitions organized by the New York State College of Ceramics.{{sfn|Morrison|2013}}

The Canadian sculptor [[Elizabeth Wyn Wood]] gave a speech on "Handicrafts in Relation to Community Art Centres in Canada". at the National Arts Club in New York City on 21 March 1945 that was reproduced in part in the summer issue of ''Canadian Art''.{{sfn|McLeod|1999|p=271}}
She noted the important role of the Canadian Guild of Potters, and of ceramic educators such as [[Peter Haworth]] and [[Bobs Cogill Haworth]] at the [[Central Technical School]] in Toronto.{{sfn|McLeod|1999|p=272}}

An exhibition was held in the [[Art Gallery of Toronto]] in March–April 1950 for the 50th anniversary of the gallery. All the visual art schools, styles and media were represented. The Canadian Guild of Potters was among the eight art societies that contributed to the show.{{sfn|Lerner|Williamson|1991|p=53}}
The guild held exhibitions of ''Canadian Ceramics / Céramiques canadiennes'' in Montreal and Toronto every two years from 1955 to 1971.{{sfn|Lerner|Williamson|1991|p=276}}
Ceramics selected from the second national Canadian Guild of Potters exhibition in 1957 were selected by jury for the ''Canadian Fine Crafts'' show that year, the first national juried crafts show in Canada.{{sfn|Alfoldy|2005|p=77}}
The Guild sent three representatives to the First World Congress of Craftsmen, held on 8–19 June 1964 at [[Columbia University]].{{sfn|Alfoldy|2005|p=29}}

The Guild eventually lost momentum, and was replaced around 1975 by an organization named Ceramic Masters Canada, later renamed Ceramists Canada.{{sfn|Hopper|2007|p=58}}{{sfn|Gotlieb|2006}}

==Members==

Noted members of the Guild included [[Florence Wyle]] (1881-1968), [[Bobs Cogill Haworth]] (1900-1988) and [[Eileen Hazell]] (1903-1984).{{sfn|List artists ... Concordia}}

'''Chögyam Trungpa''' ([[Wylie transliteration|Wylie]]: ''Chos rgyam Drung pa''; March 5, 1939 – April 4, 1987) was a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[meditation]] master and holder of both the [[Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] lineages, the eleventh [[Trungpa tülkus|Trungpa tülku]], a [[tertön]], supreme [[abbot]] of the [[Surmang|Surmang monasteries]], scholar, teacher, poet, artist, and originator of a radical re-presentation of [[Shambhala]] vision.

==Biography==

===Early years===
[[File:Khenpo gangshar2.jpg|thumb|[[Khenpo Gangshar]] (left) and Chögyam Trungpa|381x381px]]
Born in the [[Nangchen]] region of [[Tibet]] in March 1939, Chögyam Trungpa was eleventh in the line of [[Trungpa tülkus]], important figures in the [[Kagyu]] lineage, one of the four main schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Among his three main teachers were [[Jamgon Kongtrul]] of Sechen, HH [[Dilgo Khyentse|Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche]], and [[Khenpo Gangshar]].

The name ''Chögyam'' is a contraction of ''Chökyi Gyamtso'' ({{bo-tw|t=ཆོས་ཀྱི་རྒྱ་མཚོ་|w=Chos-kyi Rgya-mtsho}}), which means "ocean of [[dharma]]". ''Trungpa'' ({{bo-tw|t=དྲུང་པ་|w=Drung-pa}}) means "attendant". He was deeply trained in the Kagyu tradition and received his [[khenpo]] degree at the same time as [[Thrangu Rinpoche]]; they continued to be very close in later years. Chögyam Trungpa was also trained in the [[Nyingma]] tradition, the oldest of the four schools, and was an adherent of the [[Rime movement|''ri-mé'']] ("nonsectarian") ecumenical movement within Tibetan Buddhism, which aspired to bring together and make available all the valuable teachings of the different schools, free of sectarian rivalry.

At the time of his escape from Tibet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Lion's Jaws - Chögyam Trungpa's Epic Escape To The West|publisher=Mountain|year=2016|isbn=978-0-9950293-0-9|edition=1|last1=MacLean|first1=Grant}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trungpa was head of the Surmang group of monasteries.

=== Escape from Tibet ===
On April 23, 1959, twenty-year-old Trungpa set out on an epic nine-month escape from his homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa, Chögyam (1966). ''Born in Tibet.''164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacLean, Grant (2016). ''From Lion's Jaws: Chögyam Trungpa's Epic Escape To The West''&lt;/ref&gt; Masked in his account in ''Born in Tibet'' to protect those left behind,&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa, Chögyam (1966). ''Born in Tibet.''&lt;/ref&gt; the first, preparatory stage of his escape had begun a year earlier, when he fled his home monastery after its occupation by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA).&lt;ref&gt;''From Lion's Jaws,'' 65-69.&lt;/ref&gt; After spending the winter in hiding, he decided definitively to escape after learning that his monastery had been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;''Born in Tibet.'' 164&lt;/ref&gt; Trungpa started with [[Akong Rinpoche]] and a small party of monastics, but as they traveled people asked to join until the party eventually numbered 300 refugees, from the elderly to mothers with babies – additions which greatly slowed and complicated the journey. Forced to abandon their animals, over half the journey was on foot as the refugees journeyed through an untracked mountain wilderness to avoid the PLA. Sometimes lost, sometimes traveling at night, after three months’ trek they reached the Brahmaputra River. Trungpa, the monastics and about 70 refugees managed to cross the river under heavy gunfire,&lt;ref&gt;''Born in Tibet.''230&lt;/ref&gt; then, eating their leather belts and bags to survive, they climbed 19,000 feet over the Himalayas before reaching the safety of Pema Ko.&lt;ref&gt;''Born in Tibet.''239&lt;/ref&gt; After reaching India, on January 24, 1960 the party was flown to a refugee camp.&lt;ref&gt;''Born in Tibet.''248&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''From Lion's Jaws.''270&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2006 and 2010, independent Canadian and French researchers using satellite imagery tracked and confirmed Trungpa’s escape route.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chronicleproject.com/stories_157.html|title=Finding the Escape Route |last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, five survivors of the escape in Nepal, Scotland and the U.S. confirmed details of the journey and supplied their personal accounts.&lt;ref&gt;''From Lion's Jaws.''10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent analysis has shown the journey to be directly comparable to such sagas as Shackleton’s 1914/17 Antarctic Expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fromlionsjaws.ca/place-in-history|title=Place in History|last=|first=|date= |website=|publisher=|access-date=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 accumulated research and survivors’ stories were published in a full retelling of the story,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fromlionsjaws.ca|title=From Lion's Jaws|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in the year preliminary talks began on the funding and production of a movie.

===Early teachings in the West===
{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
In exile in India, Trungpa began his study of English. In collaboration with Freda Bedi, who had initiated the project,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life and Accomplishments of Freda Bedi, in Karma Lekshe Tsomo, editor. Eminent Buddhist Women.|last=Palmo.|first=Tenzin|publisher=SUNY.|year=2014|isbn=143845130X|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trungpa and Akong Tulku founded the Young Lamas Home School and, after seeking endorsement from the Dalai Lama, were appointed its spiritual head and administrator respectively.&lt;ref&gt;''From Lion's Jaws.284''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, with the assistance of sympathetic Westerners, Trungpa received a [[Spalding Trust|Spalding]] sponsorship to study [[Comparative Religion|comparative religion]] at [[St Antony's College, Oxford|St Antony's College]], [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Born in Tibet|last1=Trungpa|first1=Chogyam|publisher=Shambhala Publications|year=2000|isbn=1-57062-116-0|edition=4|location=Boston|pages=252}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2012-04-05 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|ZEvW__ZNlj0C|The Buddhist Handbook: A Complete Guide to Buddhist Teaching and Practice|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, upon the departure of the western [[Theravada Buddhism|Theravadan]] monk [[Namgyal Rinpoche|Anandabodhi]], Trungpa and [[Akong Rinpoche]] were invited by the Johnstone House Trust in [[Scotland]] to take over a [[meditation]] center, which then became [[Samye Ling]], the first Tibetan Buddhist monastery in the West (future actor and musician [[David Bowie]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shambhalasun.com/sunspace/?p=20767 "Bringing Chogyam Trungpa's "Crazy Wisdom" to the screen "]&lt;/ref&gt; was one of Trungpa's meditation pupils there). In 1970, after a break with Akong, Trungpa moved to the United States at the invitation of several students.

Shortly after his move to Scotland, a variety of experiences, including a car accident that left him partially paralyzed on the left side of his body, led Trungpa to give up his monastic vows and work as a lay teacher.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Born in Tibet, 1977 edition, Epilogue&lt;/ref&gt; He made that decision principally to mitigate students' becoming distracted by exotic cultures and dress and to undercut their preconceptions of how a guru should behave.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He drank, smoked, slept with students, and often kept students waiting for hours before giving teachings. Much of his behavior has been construed as deliberately provocative and sparked controversy. In one account, he encouraged students to give up smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], claiming that the smoking was not of benefit to their spiritual progress and that it exaggerated neurosis. Students were often angered, unnerved and intimidated by him, but many remained fiercely loyal, committed, and devoted.

Upon moving to the United States in 1970, Trungpa traveled around North America, gaining renown for his ability to present the essence of the highest Buddhist teachings in a form readily understandable to Western students. During this period, he conducted 13 Vajradhatu Seminaries, three-month residential programs at which he presented a vast body of Buddhist teachings in an atmosphere of intensive meditation practice. The seminaries also had the important function of training his students to become teachers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;last paragraph is exact quote from http://www.shambhala.org/teachers/chogyam-trungpa.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction of the Vajrayana===

Trungpa was one of the first teachers to introduce the esoteric practice of the [[Vajrayana]] to the West. According to Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso, "The one who mainly spread the Vajrayana in the West was Trungpa Rinpoche."&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche; 17 September 2003 [http://www.chronicleproject.com/stories_16.html], after [http://www.shambhala.org/teachers/chogyam-trungpa.php]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to its traditional presentation in Tibet, where the esoteric practices are largely the domain of the monastic sangha, in the US Trungpa introduced the Vajrayana to the lay sangha.&lt;ref&gt;Dead but not lost: grief narratives in religious traditions By Robert Goss, Dennis Klass; p74&lt;/ref&gt;

The presentation of these teachings gave rise to some criticism. According to Trungpa's former student Stephen Butterfield, "Trungpa told us that if we ever tried to leave the Vajrayana, we would suffer unbearable, subtle, continuous anguish, and disasters would pursue us like furies".&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield 11&lt;/ref&gt; Other Vajrayana teachers also warn their students about the dangers of the esoteric path.

Butterfield noted "disquieting resemblances" to cults, and "to be part of Trungpa's inner circle, you had to take a vow never to reveal or even discuss some of the things he did." But Butterfield also notes that "This personal secrecy is common with gurus, especially in Vajrayana Buddhism,"&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield 12, 100&lt;/ref&gt; and acknowledges that Trungpa's organization is anything but a cult: "a mere cult leaves you disgusted and disillusioned, wondering how you could have been a fool. I did not feel that charlatans had hoodwinked me into giving up my powers to enhance theirs. On the contrary, mine were unveiled."&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield 239&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meditation and education centers===
[[File:Karme chöling purkong.jpg|thumb|The purkhang at [[Karmê Chöling]]|349x349px]]
In 1973, Trungpa established [[Vajradhatu]], encompassing all his North American institutions, headquartered in [[Boulder, Colorado]]. Trungpa also founded more than 100 meditation centers throughout the world. Originally known as Dharmadhatus, these centers, now more than 150 in number, are known as [[Shambhala International|Shambhala Meditation Centers]]. He also founded retreat centers for intensive meditation practice, including [[Shambhala Mountain Center]] in [[Red Feather Lakes]], Colorado, [[Karmê Chöling]] in [[Barnet, Vermont]] and [[Gampo Abbey]] in [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]], [[Nova Scotia]].

In 1974, Trungpa founded the Naropa Institute, which later became [[Naropa University]], in [[Boulder, Colorado]].  Naropa was the first accredited [[Buddhist universities in the United States and Canada|Buddhist university]] in North America. Trungpa hired [[Allen Ginsberg]] to teach [[poetry]] and [[William Burroughs]] to teach [[literature]].

Trungpa had a number of notable students, among whom were [[Pema Chödrön]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Peter Orlovsky]], [[Anne Waldman]], [[Diane di Prima]], [[Peter Lieberson]], [[John Steinbeck IV]], [[José Argüelles]], [[David Nichtern]], [[Ken Wilber]], [[David Deida]], [[Francisco Varela]], and [[Joni Mitchell]], who portrayed Trungpa in the song "Refuge of the Roads" on her 1976 album [[Hejira (album)|Hejira]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.plos.org/neurotribes/2015/10/26/what-kind-of-buddhist-was-steve-jobs-really/|title=What Kind of Buddhist was Steve Jobs, Really?|accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ginsberg, Waldman, and di Prima also taught at Naropa University, and in the 1980s [[Marianne Faithfull]] taught songwriting workshops.
Lesser-known students Trungpa taught in England and the US include Alf Vial, [[Rigdzin Shikpo]] (né Michael Hookham), Jigme Rinzen (né P. Howard Useche), [[Ezequiel Hernandez]] Urdaneta (known as Keun-Tshen Goba after setting up his first meditation center in Venezuela), Miguel Otaola (aka [[Dorje Khandro]]), Francisco Salas Roche, and [[Francesca Fremantle]]. [[Rigdzin Shikpo]] promulgated Trungpa's teachings from a primarily [[Nyingma]] rather than Kagyü point of view at the Longchen Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.longchenfoundation.org/aboutFounder.html Longchen Foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128075242/http://www.longchenfoundation.org/aboutFounder.html |date=2012-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rigdzin Shikpo 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shambhala vision===

In 1976, Trungpa began giving a series of secular teachings, some of which were gathered and presented as the [[Shambhala Training]],&lt;ref&gt;Midal 2001, pp 233–247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa 2004, Introduction to Volume 8&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by his vision (see [[terma (Buddhism)|terma]]) of the legendary Kingdom of [[Shambhala]]. Trungpa had actually started writing about Shambhala before his 1959 escape from Tibet to India, but most of those writings were lost during the escape.&lt;ref&gt;Midal 2005, pp 363–364&lt;/ref&gt;

In his view not only was individual enlightenment not mythical, but the Shambhala Kingdom, an enlightened society, could in fact be actualized. The practice of Shambhala vision is to use mindfulness/awareness meditation as a way to connect with one's [[basic goodness]] and confidence. It is presented as a path that "brings dignity, confidence, and wisdom to every facet of life." Trungpa proposed to lead the Kingdom as ''sakyong'' (Tib. earth protector) with his wife as queen-consort or ''sakyong wangmo.''

Shambhala vision is described as a nonreligious approach rooted in meditation and accessible to individuals of any, or no, religion. In Shambhala terms, it is possible, moment by moment, for individuals to establish enlightened society. His book, ''[[Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior]]'', provides a concise collection of the Shambhala views. According to Trungpa, it was his [[intention]] to propagate the [[Kings of Shambhala|kingdom of Shambala]] that provided the necessary inspiration to leave his homeland and make the arduous journey to India and the West.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shambhala.org/ntc/pdf/Chogyam-the-Translator.pdf Chogyam The Translator, see p. 4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829123015/http://www.shambhala.org/ntc/pdf/Chogyam-the-Translator.pdf |date=2008-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work with arts and sciences===

From the beginning of his time in the US, Trungpa encouraged his students to integrate a contemplative approach into their everyday activities. In addition to making a variety of traditional contemplative practices available to the community, he incorporated his students' already existing interests (especially anything relating to Japanese culture), evolving specialized teachings on a meditative approach to these various disciplines. These included [[kyūdō]] (Japanese archery), [[calligraphy]], [[ikebana]] (flower arranging), [[Sadō]] ([[Japanese tea ceremony]]), [[dance]], [[theater]], [[film]], [[poetry]], [[health care]], and [[psychotherapy]]. His aim was, in his own words, to bring "art to everyday life." He founded the [[Nalanda Foundation]] in 1974 as an umbrella organization for these activities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

===Death===
Trungpa visited [[Nova Scotia]] for the first time in 1977. In 1983 he established [[Gampo Abbey]], a Karma Kagyü monastery in Cape Breton. The following year, 1984–85, he observed a yearlong retreat at [[Mill Village, Nova Scotia|Mill Village]] and in 1986 he moved his home and Vajradhatu's international headquarters to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]].

By then he was in failing health due to the auto accident in his youth and years of heavy alcohol use. On September 28, 1986, he suffered cardiac arrest,&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, 2008, p 367&lt;/ref&gt; after which his condition deteriorated, requiring intensive care at the hospital, then at his home and finally, in mid-March 1987, back at the hospital, where he died on April 4, 1987.

In 2006 his wife, Diana Mukpo, wrote, "Although he had many of the classic health problems that develop from heavy drinking, it was in fact more likely the diabetes and high blood pressure that led to abnormal blood sugar levels and then the cardiac arrest".&lt;ref&gt;Mukpo, 2006, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; But in a November 2008 interview, when asked "What was he ill with? What did he die of?," Trungpa's doctor, Mitchell Levy, replied, "He had chronic liver disease related to his alcohol intake over many years."&lt;ref&gt;Chronicles Radio Presents. November 1st, 2008.&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.chronicleproject.com/chroniclesradio_dispatches/2008_11_01.html]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One of Trungpa's nursing attendants reported that he suffered in his last months from classic symptoms of terminal [[alcoholism]] and [[cirrhosis]],&lt;ref name="Butler17"/&gt; yet continued drinking heavily. She added, "At the same time there was a power about him and an equanimity to his presence that was phenomenal, that I don't know how to explain."&lt;ref&gt;Zweig 1991, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

Trungpa is reported to have remained in a state of [[Samādhi (Buddhism)|samādhi]] for five days after his death, his body not immediately decaying and his heart remaining warm.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, 2008, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; His body was packed in salt, laid in a wooden box, and conveyed to Karmê Chöling. A number of observers have reported that his cremation there on May 26, 1987, was accompanied by various atmospheric effects and other signs traditionally viewed as marks of enlightenment. These included the appearance of rainbows, circling eagles,&lt;ref&gt;Miles, 1989, pp. 526–528&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, 2008, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; and a cloud in the shape of an ''Ashe''.&lt;ref&gt;"Collective identity and the post-charismatic fate of Shambhala International" by Eldershaw, Lynn P., Ph.D. thesis, University of Waterloo, 2004. pg 222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Everyone who stayed long enough at Trungpa's cremation saw the rainbows." Stephen Butterfield, in ''The new Buddhism: the western transformation of an ancient tradition'' By James William Coleman; p77&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuation of the Shambhala lineage===
Upon Trungpa's death, the leadership of [[Vajradhatu]] was first carried on by his American disciple, appointed regent and Dharma heir, [[Ösel Tendzin]] (Thomas Rich), and then by Trungpa's eldest son and Shambhala heir, [[Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche]].

The next Trungpa [[tülku]], [[Chokyi Sengay]], was recognized in 1991 by [[Tai Situ]] Rinpoche.

==Acclaim==
Major lineage holders of Trungpa's Tibetan Buddhist traditions and many other Buddhist teachers supported his work.
[[File:Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche.jpg|thumb|262x262px|Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche]]
In 1974, Trungpa invited the 16th [[Karmapa]], head of the [[Karma Kagyu]] lineage, to come to the West and offer teachings. Based on this visit, the Karmapa proclaimed Trungpa one of the principal Kagyu lineage holders in the west:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ancient and renowned lineage of the Trungpas, since the great [[siddha]] Trungmase Chökyi Gyamtso Lodrö, possessor of only holy activity, has in every generation given rise to great beings. Awakened by the vision of these predecessors in the lineage, this my present lineage holder, Chökyi Gyamtso Trungpa Rinpoche, supreme incarnate being, has magnificently carried out the vajra holders' discipline in the land of America, bringing about the liberation of students and ripening them in the [[dharma]]. This wonderful truth is clearly manifest.

Accordingly, I empower Chögyam Trungpa Vajra Holder and Possessor of the Victory Banner of the Practice Lineage of the Karma Kagyu. Let this be recognized by all people of both elevated and ordinary station.&lt;ref&gt;"Proclamation to all Those Who Dwell Under the Sun Upholding the Tradition of the Spiritual and Temporal Orders", The Gyalwang Karmapa, 1974, in ''Garuda IV'', 1976, pp 86–87, {{ISBN|0-87773-086-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1981, Trungpa and his students hosted the [[14th Dalai Lama]] in his visit to Boulder, Colorado. Of Trungpa, the Dalai Lama later wrote, "Exceptional as one of the first Tibetan lamas to become fully assimilated into Western culture, he made a powerful contribution to revealing the Tibetan approach to inner peace in the West."&lt;ref&gt;Midal, 2005. p. x&lt;/ref&gt;

Trungpa also received support from one of his own main teachers, [[Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche]], head of the [[Nyingma]] lineage.  In addition to numerous [[sadhana]]s and poems dedicated to Trungpa, Khyentse Rinpoche wrote a supplication after Trungpa's death specifically naming him a [[mahasiddha]].&lt;ref&gt;Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, [http://www.chronicleproject.com/tributes/65.html Light of Blessings]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche, [http://www.chronicleproject.com/stories_33.html Reflections on Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simhas.org/chogyamtrungpa.html The Vajracarya Trungpa Rinpoche] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205081428/http://www.simhas.org/chogyamtrungpa.html |date=December 5, 2008 }}: "The 1st Trungpa Rinpoche ... was an incarnation of the Indian Mahasiddha Dombipa"&lt;/ref&gt; Among other Tibetan lamas to name Trungpa a mahasiddha are [[Rangjung Rigpe Dorje|the Sixteenth Karmapa]], [[Thrangu Rinpoche]], [[Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche]] and [[Tai Situpa]].&lt;ref&gt;Warrior-King of Shambhala: Remembering Chogyam Trungpa By Jeremy Hayward; p274&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche]] said, "As taught in the Buddhist scriptures, there are nine qualities of a perfect master of buddhadharma. The eleventh Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche possessed all nine of these."&lt;ref&gt;Midal, 2005. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suzuki Roshi]], founder of the [[San Francisco Zen Center]] and [[Tassajara Zen Mountain Center]], and another important exponent of Buddhism to western students, described Trungpa in the context of a talk about emptiness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The way you can struggle with this is to be supported by something, something you don't know. As we are human beings, there must be that kind of feeling. You must feel it in this city or building or community. So whatever community it may be, it is necessary for it to have this kind of spiritual support.

That is why I respect Trungpa Rinpoche. He is supporting us. You may criticize him because he drinks alcohol like I drink water, but that is a minor problem. He trusts you completely. He knows that if he is always supporting you in a true sense you will not criticize him, whatever he does. And he doesn't mind whatever you say. That is not the point, you know. This kind of big spirit, without clinging to some special religion or form of practice, is necessary for human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Midal, 2005. p. 381&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Gehlek Rinpoche]], who lived with Trungpa when they were young monks in India and later visited and taught with him in the U.S., remarked:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
He was a great Tibetan yogi, a friend, and a master. The more I deal with Western Dharma students, the more I appreciate how he presented the dharma and the activities that he taught. Whenever I meet with difficulties, I begin to understand – sometimes before solving the problem, sometimes afterward – why Trungpa Rinpoche did some unconventional things. I do consider him to be the father of Tibetan Buddhism in the United States. In my opinion, he left very early – too early. His death was a great loss. Everything he did is significant.&lt;ref&gt;Midal, 2005. p. 418&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Diana Mukpo, his wife, stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
First, Rinpoche always wanted feedback. He very, very much encouraged his students’ critical intelligence. One of the reasons that people were in his circle was that they were willing to be honest and direct with him. He definitely was not one of those teachers who asked for obedience and wanted their students not to think for themselves. He thrived, he lived, on the intelligence of his students. That is how he built his entire teaching situation.

From my perspective, I could always be pretty direct with him. Maybe I was not hesitant to do that because I really trusted the unconditional nature of our relationship. I felt there was really nothing to lose by being absolutely direct with him, and he appreciated that.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2998&amp;Itemid=0]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the forebears formally acknowledged by the Trungpa lineage, and referred to by Trungpa, were the Indian [[mahasiddha]] Ḍombipa&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Born in Tibet|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=33|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as Ḍombi Heruka; his name may have stemmed from his consorting with Dhombis, outcast women)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenon2.com/en/knowledge/mahasiddhas/32-mahasiddha-dombhipa%E2%80%A6-dombipa-dombip%C4%81da-dom-bhi-he-ru-ka-%E2%80%9Che-washer-folk%E2%80%9D%E2%80%9D-tiger-ride|title=Mahasiddha Dombhipa… Dombipa / Dombipāda (dom bhi he ru ka): "He of the Washer Folk"/"The Tiger Rider"|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Drukpa Kunley|Drukpa Künlek]] (also Kunley), the Mad Yogi of Bhutan, who converted Bhutan to Buddhism and was famous for his fondness for beer and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chogyam Trungpa: His Life and Vision|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=154|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Divine Madman: The Sublime Life and Songs of Drukpa Kunley|last=Dowman|first=Keith|publisher=Createspace|year=2014|isbn=1495379833|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both were recognized for their powerful but unorthodox teaching styles.

Trungpa's own teaching style was often unconventional. In his own words, "When we talk about compassion, we talk in terms of being kind. But compassion is not so much being kind; it is being creative to wake a person up."&lt;ref&gt;The Collected Works of Chögyam Trungpa, Volume Six, p. 541&lt;/ref&gt; He did not encourage his students to imitate his own behavior, and was troubled by those who felt empowered by his example to do whatever they wanted and manipulate people. As the third [[Jamgon Kongtrul|Jamgön Kongtrül]] explained to Trungpa's students, "You shouldn't imitate or judge the behavior of your teacher, Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, unless you can imitate his mind."&lt;ref&gt;Midal 2001, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

Trungpa's sexuality has been one of the sources of controversy, as he cultivated relations with a number of his female students. [[Tenzin Palmo]], who met him in 1962 while he was still at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], did not become one of his consorts, refusing his advances because he had presented himself as "a pure monk." But Palmo stated that had she known Trungpa had been having sexual relations with women since he was 13, she would not have declined.&lt;ref&gt;''Cave in the Snow: Tendzin Palmo's quest for enlightenment'' by Vicki MacKenzie. Bloomsbury: 1998 {{ISBN|1-58234-004-8}}. pg 31&lt;/ref&gt; Trungpa formally renounced his monastic vows in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;The Collected Works of Chogyam Trungpa, Volume 1. Shambhala Publications: 2004 {{ISBN|1-59030-025-4}} pg xxix&lt;/ref&gt;

Trungpa was also known for smoking tobacco and liberally using alcohol;&lt;ref&gt;Lojong and Tonglen Community Site. [http://lojongmindtraining.com/Biography.aspx?authorID=2 Biography of Chogyam Trungpa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514064434/http://lojongmindtraining.com/Biography.aspx?AuthorID=2 |date=2006-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; many who knew him characterized him as an alcoholic.&lt;ref name="Coleman74"&gt;Coleman 2001, pg. 74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="das251"&gt;Das 1997, pg. 251&lt;/ref&gt; He began drinking occasionally shortly after arriving in India.&lt;ref&gt;Mukpo 72&lt;/ref&gt; Before coming to the US, Trungpa drove a sports car into a joke shop in [[Dumfries]], Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Das 1997, pg. 199&lt;/ref&gt; While his companion was not seriously injured,&lt;ref&gt;The new Buddhism: the western transformation of an ancient tradition By James William Coleman; p75&lt;/ref&gt; Trungpa was left partially paralyzed. Later, he described this event as a pivotal moment that inspired the course of his teachings. Some accounts ascribe the accident to drinking.&lt;ref&gt;The American occupation of Tibetan Buddhism: Tibetans and their American ... By Eve Mullen; p56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zweig141"&gt;Zweig 1991, p.141&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest he may have had a stroke.&lt;ref&gt;"Following a stroke which left him partially paralyzed, Trungpa renounced his monastic vows" The A to Z of Buddhism – Page 258 by Charles S. Prebish&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dharmafellowship.org/biographies/contemporarymasters/chogyam-trungpa.htm The Dharma Fellowship]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Trungpa himself, he blacked out.&lt;ref&gt;Warrior-King of Shambhala: Remembering Chogyam Trungpa By Jeremy Hayward; p10&lt;/ref&gt;

Trungpa often combined drinking with teaching. David Chadwick recounts:&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick 1999, p. 374&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Suzuki [Roshi] asked Trungpa to give a talk to the students in the [[zendo]] the next night. Trungpa walked in tipsy and sat on the edge of the altar platform with his feet dangling. But he delivered a crystal-clear talk, which some felt had a quality – like Suzuki's talks – of not only being about the dharma but being itself the dharma.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In some instances Trungpa was too drunk to walk and had to be carried.&lt;ref name="Zweig141" /&gt; Also, according to his student [[John Steinbeck IV]] and his wife, on a couple of occasions Trungpa's speech was unintelligible.&lt;ref name="Steinbeck176_248"&gt;Steinbeck 2001, pp. 176, 248&lt;/ref&gt; One woman reported serving him "big glasses of gin first thing in the morning."&lt;ref name="Butler17"&gt;Butler, Katy. ''Encountering the Shadow in Buddhist America'' in ''Common Boundary'' May/June 1990. pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The Steinbecks wrote ''The Other Side of Eden'', a sharply critical memoir of their lives with Trungpa in which they claim that, in addition to alcohol, he spent $40,000 a year on [[cocaine]], and used [[Seconal]] to come down from the cocaine. The Steinbecks said the cocaine use was kept secret from the wider Vajradhatu community.&lt;ref&gt;Steinbeck 2001, pp. 32, 41, 266&lt;/ref&gt;

An incident that became a [[cause célèbre]] among some poets and artists was the Halloween party at Snowmass Colorado Seminary in 1975, held during a 3-month period of intensive meditation and study of the [[Hinayana]], [[Mahayana]], and [[Vajrayana]] vehicles of Tibetan Buddhism. The poet [[W. S. Merwin]] had arrived at the [[Naropa University|Naropa Institute]] that summer and been told by [[Allen Ginsberg]] that he ought to attend the seminary. Although he had not gone through the several years' worth of study and preparatory mind training required, Merwin insisted on attending and Trungpa eventually granted his request – along with Merwin's girlfriend. At seminary the couple kept to themselves. At the Halloween party, after many, including Trungpa himself, had taken off their clothes, Merwin was asked to join the event but refused. On Trungpa's orders, his Vajra Guard forced entry into the poet's locked and barricaded room; brought him and his girlfriend, Dana Naone, against their will, to the party; and eventually stripped them of all their clothes, with onlookers ignoring Naone's pleas for help and for someone to call the police.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, 1977, throughout; Miles 1989, pp. 466–470; and Clark 1980, pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; The next day Trungpa asked Merwin and Naone to remain at the Seminary as either students or guests. They agreed to stay for several more weeks to hear the Vajrayana teachings, with Trungpa's promise that "there would be no more incidents" and Merwin's that there would be "no guarantees of obedience, trust, or personal devotion to him."&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, 1977, pp. 56, 88&lt;/ref&gt; They left immediately after the last talk. In a 1977 letter to members of a Naropa class investigating the incident, Merwin concluded,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
My feelings about Trungpa have been mixed from the start.  Admiration, throughout, for his remarkable gifts; and reservations, which developed into profound misgivings, concerning some of his uses of them.  I imagine, at least, that I've learned some things from him (though maybe not all of them were the things I was "supposed" to learn) and some through him, and I'm grateful to him for those.  I wouldn't encourage anyone to become a student of his. I wish him well.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, 1977, pg. 89&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The incident became known to a wider public when Tom Clark published "The Great Naropa Poetry Wars". The Naropa Institute later asked [[Ed Sanders]] and his class to conduct an internal investigation, resulting in a lengthy report.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marin (1979) p43-58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanders (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kashner (2004) p. 278ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weinberger (1986) pp 30-33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eliot Weinberger]] commented on the incident in a critique aimed at Trungpa and [[Allen Ginsberg]] published in ''[[The Nation]]'' on April 19, 1980. He complained that the fascination of some of the best minds of his generation with Trungpa's presentation of Tibetan Buddhism and Tibetan theocracy created a dangerous exclusivity and elitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadmuseditions.com/Naropa.html|title=Cadmus Editions on Clark's publication}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Jeffery Paine]] commented on this incident that "[s]eeing Merwin out of step with the rest, Trungpa could have asked him to leave, but decided it was kinder to shock him out of his aloofness."&lt;ref&gt;Paine (2004) pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; Paine also noted the outrage felt in particular by poets such as [[Robert Bly]] and [[Kenneth Rexroth]], who began calling Trungpa a [[fascism|fascist]].&lt;ref&gt;Paine (2004) pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Trungpa's choice of Westerner [[Ösel Tendzin]] as his dharma heir was controversial, as Tendzin was the first Western Tibetan Buddhist lineage holder and Vajra Regent. This was exacerbated by Tendzin's own behavior as lineage holder. While knowingly [[HIV]]-positive, Tendzin was sexually involved with students, one of whom became infected and died.&lt;ref&gt;Fields 1992, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''coppersmith''', also known as a '''brazier''', is a person who makes artifacts from [[copper]] and [[brass]]. '''[[Brass]]''' is an alloy of copper and '''zinc'''.The term redsmith is used for a tinsmith that uses tinsmithing tools and techniques to make copper items.

==History==
Anthropologists believe copper to be the first metal used by humans due to its softness and ease to manipulate.  In antiquity, copper's durability and resistance to rust or corrosion proved valuable.  Copper's relationship with man is thought to date back over six thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Webster B. Sixty Centuries of Copper.  Hutchinson &amp; Co. Ltd, London. 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper was particularly worked in England, with ores smelted in Wales as early as the 1500s.  Copper was found in great quantities in North America, especially Montana, as well as archaic copper mines near Lake Superior, which was recording by a Jesuit missionary in 1659.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, John.  Art of Coppersmithing.  Astragal Press, Lakeville MN. 1993.  Reprinting from original work published in 1894.  {{ISBN|1-879335-37-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coppersmithing as a trade benefited strongly from the invention of sheet metal rollers.  Copper sheet was then available in a much more versatile and easy form for creating copper wares.  By the 1700s, coppersmiths lived in the American colonies, but did not have access to much sheet copper due to the Crown's regulation of copper and other goods to the Americas.  Sheet metal production was prohibited in the colonies as well before the American Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, Henry J. ''American Copper &amp; Brass.''  Masthof Press, Morgantown PA.  1968. {{ISBN|1-883294-22-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coppersmith Trade==

Most coppersmiths can create, from a pattern, copper wares from a sheet of tin.  They can also repair, clean and re-tin copper cookware interiors.  Some cooper smiths make barrels.Some coppersmiths will specialize in specific forms or items, such as a particular type of biscuit oven or mug or kettle.  In the 1700 and 1800's, coppersmiths typically had a few apprentices in various stages of learning the trade working together.

Apprentices would start learning the trade usually around 8 or 9 years old.  Typical duties of a youth in the copper shop would include tasks such as breaking coke or sal ammoniac blocks, scouring copper pieces to prepare them for tinning, and polishing hammers and tools.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, John. Art of Coppersmithing: A Practical Treatise on Working Sheet Copper into all Forms.  Astragal Press, Lakeville MN. 1993. {{ISBN|1-879335-37-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regions where copper is mined like Iberia and India there are a number of centres where the coppersmith trade has flourished.

==Examples of objects made by modern coppersmiths ==
These include:-
* jewellery, sculptures, [[weather vane]]s, overmantels, fenders, decorative panels, and challenge shields; 
*plates and cookware, [[cigarette case]]s, tobacco jars, tea and coffee pots, jugs, vases, trays, frames, rose bowls, timpani, kettles (cooking, brewing, dying, fish and hatter), stew, fry and sauce pans, warming pans or kettledrum bowls; 
*awnings, light fixtures, fountains, [[Extractor hood|range hoods]], cupolas, and [[still]]s.
*[[butter churn]], ship sheathing, copper mugs, ladles, funnels, basins, [[coal scuttle]], glue pots.
[[File:Smithvane1976.jpg|thumb|Copper weather vane created by using traditional coppersmithing techniques]]

Notable copper styles in the UK include [[Newlyn Copper|Newlyn]] in [[Cornwall]] and [[Keswick School of Industrial Art|Keswick]] in [[Cumbria]]. Coppersmith work started waning in the late 1970s and early 1980s and those in the sheetmetal trade began doing the coppersmith's work, the practices used being similar to those in the [[plumber|plumbing]] trade. Coppermiths in recent years have turned to pipe work, not only in copper but also stainless steel and aluminium, particularly in the aircraft industry. They are one of the few trades that have a mention in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;2 Timothy 4:14(KJV), [[Alexander the coppersmith]], although later editions mention a metalworker.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties of copper==
Copper is generally considered to be a soft metal, meaning it can be worked without heating. Over a period of working the metal in this way it can "work-harden". This means that the molecules within the copper are compressed and irregular in their arrangement. This causes stress in the metal and eventually cracking the metal along these stress points. In order for the copper to be worked to any extensive degree it must be [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]]. This process involves heating the metal and then rapidly cooling it in water. The cooling stage is known as [[quenching]]. By heating the copper, the molecules in the metal are relaxed, and thus able to align themselves in a more uniform fashion. This allows for easier shaping of the metal. In order to keep this uniformity within the metal, it is cooled instantly. This prevents the molecules from moving around and causing tension in the structure of the metal. Unlike ferrous metals—which must be cooled slowly to anneal—copper can be cooled slowly in air or quickly by quenching in water.

The [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279 AD) was a culturally rich and sophisticated age for [[China]]. There was blossoming of and advancements in the visual arts, music, literature, and philosophy. Officials of the ruling bureaucracy, who underwent a strict and extensive examination process, reached new heights of education in Chinese society, while general Chinese culture was enhanced by widespread printing, growing literacy, and various arts.

Appreciation of art among the [[Gentry (China)|gentry class]] flourished during the Song dynasty, especially in regard to paintings, which is an art practiced by many. Trends in painting styles amongst the gentry notably shifted from the Northern (960–1127) to Southern Song (1127–1279) periods, influenced in part by the gradual embrace of the [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] political ideology at court.

People in urban areas enjoyed [[Chinese opera|theatrical drama on stage]], restaurants that catered to a variety of regional cooking, lavish clothing and apparel sold in the markets, while both urban and rural people engaged in [[Traditional Chinese holidays|seasonal festivities and religious holidays]].

[[Chinese painting]] during the Song dynasty reached a new level of sophistication with further development of [[landscape painting]]. The ''[[shan shui]]'' style painting—"shan" meaning mountain, and "shui" meaning river—became prominent features in Chinese landscape art. The emphasis laid upon landscape painting in the Song period was grounded in [[Chinese philosophy]]; [[Taoism]] stressed that humans were but tiny specks amongst vast and greater cosmos, while [[Neo-Confucianist]] writers often pursued the discovery of patterns and principles that they believed caused all social and natural phenomena.&lt;ref name="ebrey cambridge 162"&gt;Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 162.&lt;/ref&gt; The making of glazed and translucent porcelain and celadon wares with complex use of [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]s was also developed further during the Song period. [[Longquan celadon]] wares were particularly popular in the Song period. Black and red [[lacquerware]]s of the Song period featured beautifully carved artwork of miniature nature scenes, landscapes, or simple decorative [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s. However, even though intricate bronze-casting, ceramics and lacquerware, jade carving, sculpture, architecture, and the painting of portraits and closely viewed objects like birds on branches were held in high esteem by the Song Chinese, landscape painting was paramount.&lt;ref name="morton 104"&gt;Morton, 104.&lt;/ref&gt; By the beginning of the Song dynasty a distinctive [[Northern Landscape style|landscape style]] had emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Barnhart, "Three Thousand Years of Chinese Painting", 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists mastered the formula of creating intricate and realistic scenes placed in the foreground, while the background retained qualities of vast and infinite space. Distant mountain peaks rise out of high clouds and mist, while streaming rivers run from afar into the foreground.&lt;ref name="morton 105"&gt;Morton, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Song Dynasty Porcelain Bottle.jpg|alt=A handle-less jug which has a small bottom, a wide middle, and a very small opening at the top. The jug is white porcelain with a tan illustration of leaves or a vine wrapping around the entirety of the jug.|thumb|left|170px|Song [[ding ware]] [[porcelain]] bottle, 11th century.]]
There was a significant difference in painting trends between the Northern Song period (960–1127) and Southern Song period (1127–1279). The paintings of Northern Song officials were influenced by their political ideals of bringing order to the world and tackling the largest issues affecting the whole of their society, hence their paintings often depicted huge, sweeping landscapes.&lt;ref name="ebrey cambridge 163"&gt;Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 163.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Southern Song officials were more interested in reforming society from the bottom up and on a much smaller scale, a method they believed had a better chance for eventual success.&lt;ref name="ebrey cambridge 163"/&gt; Hence, their paintings often focused on smaller, visually closer, and more intimate scenes, while the background was often depicted as bereft of detail as a realm without substance or concern for the artist or viewer.&lt;ref name="ebrey cambridge 163"/&gt; This change in attitude from one era to the next stemmed largely from the rising influence of [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] philosophy. Adherents to Neo-Confucianism focused on reforming society from the bottom up, not the top down, which can be seen in their efforts to promote small private academies during the Southern Song instead of the large state-controlled academies seen in the Northern Song era.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Verseuse phénix Musée Guimet 2418.jpg|alt=A green jug which is small at the bottom, wide near the middle, and has a tall, narrow opening at the top. The jug has a handle on one side and a carved bird head on the other side, bot connected to the top of the jug. The body of the jug has a flower or leaf pattern carved into it.|170px|thumb|A vase with a [[Chinese phoenix|phoenix-headed]] spout, gray sandstone with celadon coating, 10th century.]]
Ever since the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] (420–589), painting had become an art of high sophistication that was associated with the gentry class as one of their main artistic pastimes, the others being calligraphy and poetry.&lt;ref name="ebrey 81 83"&gt;Ebrey, 81–83.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Song dynasty there were avid art collectors that would often meet in groups to discuss their own paintings, as well as rate those of their colleagues and friends. The poet and statesman [[Su Shi]] (1037–1101) and his accomplice [[Mi Fu]] (1051–1107) often partook in these affairs, borrowing art pieces to study and copy, or if they really admired a piece then an exchange was often proposed.&lt;ref name="ebrey 163"&gt;Ebrey, 163.&lt;/ref&gt; The small round paintings popular in the Southern Song were often collected into albums as poets would write poems along the side to match the theme and mood of the painting.&lt;ref name="ebrey cambridge 163"/&gt;

Although they were avid art collectors, some Song scholars did not readily appreciate artworks commissioned by those painters found at shops or common marketplaces, and some of the scholars even criticized artists from renowned schools and academies. Anthony J. Barbieri-Low, a Professor of Early Chinese History at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], points out that Song scholars' appreciation of art created by their peers was not extended to those who made a living simply as professional artists:&lt;ref name="barbieri low 2007 39 40"&gt;Barbieri-Low (2007), 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;During the Northern Song (960–1126 CE), a new class of scholar-artists emerged who did not possess the tromp l'oiel skills of the academy painters nor even the proficiency of common marketplace painters. The literati's painting was simpler and at times quite unschooled, yet they would criticize these other two groups as mere professionals, since they relied on paid commissions for their livelihood and did not paint merely for enjoyment or self-expression. The scholar-artists considered that painters who concentrated on realistic depictions, who employed a colorful palette, or, worst of all, who accepted monetary payment for their work were no better than butchers or tinkers in the marketplace. They were not to be considered real artists.&lt;ref name="barbieri low 2007 39 40"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, during the Song period, there were many acclaimed court painters and they were highly esteemed by emperors and the [[royal family]]. One of the greatest landscape painters given patronage by the Song court was [[Zhang Zeduan]] (1085–1145), who painted the original ''[[Along the River During Qingming Festival]]'' scroll, one of the most well-known masterpieces of Chinese visual art. [[Emperor Gaozong of Song]] (1127–1162) once commissioned an art project of numerous paintings for the ''[[Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute]]'', based on the woman poet [[Cai Wenji]] (177–250 AD) of the earlier [[Han dynasty]]. The Southern Song dynasty court painters included Zhao Mengjian (趙孟堅, c. 1199–1264), a member of the Imperial family, known for popularising the [[Three Friends of Winter]].&lt;ref name=Mengjian&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cultural China|title=Narcissus|url=http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/63Arts4309.html|publisher=Shanghai News and Press Bureau|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Song period Buddhism saw a small revival since its persecution during the Tang dynasty. This could be seen in the continued construction of sculpture artwork at the [[Dazu Rock Carvings]] in [[Sichuan]] province. Similar in design to the sculptures at Dazu, the Song temple at Mingshan in [[Anyue]], Sichuan province features a wealth of Song era Buddhist sculptures, including the Buddha and deities clad in lavish imperial and monastic robes.&lt;ref name="sorensen 282-283"&gt;Sorensen, 282–283.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Chinese literature|Chinese poetry|Song poetry}}
[[Chinese literature]] during the Song period contained a range of many different genres and was enriched by the social complexity of the period. Although the earlier [[Tang dynasty]] is viewed as the zenith era for [[Chinese poetry]] (particularly the ''[[Shi (poetry)|shi]]'' style poetry of [[Du Fu]], [[Li Bai]], [[Bai Juyi]]), there were important poetic developments by famous poets of the Song era, with the flourishing of the ''[[Ci (poetry)|ci]]'' form being especially being associated with Song poetry. Song developments in poetry included the works of the social critic and pioneer of the "new subjective style" [[Mei Yaochen]] (1002–1060), the politically controversial yet renowned master [[Su Shi]] (1037–1101), the eccentric yet brilliant [[Mi Fu]] (1051–1107), the premier Chinese female poet [[Li Qingzhao]] (1084–1151), and many others. Although having roots in the [[Liang dynasty]] (502–557 AD), and further development during the brief existence of the [[Southern Tang]] immediate preceding the Song, the ''ci'' form of Chinese poetry found its greatest acceptance and popularity during the Song dynasty, and was used by most Song poets. The high court Chancellor [[Fan Zhongyan]] (989–1052), ardent Neo-Confucian [[Ouyang Xiu]] (1007–1072), the great calligrapher [[Huang Tingjian]] (1045–1105), and the military general [[Xin Qiji]] (1140–1207) were especially known for their ci poetry, amongst many others. The great ''ci'' poet [[Li Houzhu|Li Yu]] (who ruled the Southern Tang under the name Li Houzhu) wrote some of his most famous works during his time as a prisoner at the first Song court, following the demise of his former kingdom: Li Yu is an important transitional figure, sometimes considered to be the first major Song poet, and sometimes acclaimed as the last major Tang poet.

Historiography in literature remained prominent during the Song, as it had in previous ages and would in successive ages of China. Along with Song Qi, the essayist and historian Ouyang Xiu were responsible for compiling the ''[[New Book of Tang]]'' by 1060, covering the history of the Tang dynasty. Chancellor [[Sima Guang]] (1019–1086), the political nemesis of [[Wang Anshi]] (1021–1086), was responsible for heading a team of scholars that compiled the enormous historical work of the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', a universal history completed in 1084 AD with a total of over 3 million written [[Chinese character]]s in 294 volumes.&lt;ref name="pratt rutt 478"&gt;Pratt &amp; Rutt, 478.&lt;/ref&gt; It covered the major themes and intricate nuances of Chinese history from 425 BC during the [[Warring States period|Warring States]] all the way up to the 10th century and the fall of the Tang.&lt;ref name="pratt rutt 478"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brownlee 19"&gt;Brownlee, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1189 it was compiled and condensed into fifty-nine books by [[Zhu Xi]] (1130–1200), while this project was totally complete with the efforts of his disciples around the time of his death in 1200.&lt;ref name="partington 238"&gt;Partington, 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also very large encyclopedic works written in the Song period, such as the ''[[Four Great Books of Song]]'' compiled first by [[Li Fang (Song dynasty)|Li Fang]] in the 10th century and fully edited by the time of Cefu Yuangui in the 11th century. The largest of these was the 1013 publication of the ''[[Prime Tortoise of the Record Bureau]]'', a massive encyclopedia consisting of 9.4 million written Chinese characters divided into 1000 volumes. There were also [[Rime dictionary|rhyme dictionaries]] written during the Song dynasty, such as the ''[[Jiyun]]'' of 1037. Although Neo-Confucianism became dominant over Buddhism in China during this period, there was still a significant amount of Buddhist literature. For example, there was the collection of Zen Buddhist [[kōan]]s in the ''[[Blue Cliff Record]]'' of 1125, which was expanded by [[Yuanwu Keqin]] (1063–1135). 'Travel record literature' ('youji wenxue') was also a popular category of literature during the Song period, which was accounts of one's own travel experiences typically written in narrative or prose styles, and included authors such as [[Fan Chengda]] (1126–1193).&lt;ref name="hargett 67 68"&gt;Hargett, 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt; A great example of Chinese travel literature in the Song period would be [[Su Shi]]'s (1037–1101) ''[[Su Shi#Travel record literature|Record of Stone Bell Mountain]]''.

There were many technical and scientific writings during the Song period. The two most eminent authors of the scientific and technical fields were [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095) and his contemporary [[Su Song]] (1020–1101). Shen Kuo published his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' in 1088 AD, an enormous encyclopedic book that covered a wide range of subjects, including literature, art, military strategy, mathematics, astronomy, meteorology, geology, geography, metallurgy, engineering, hydraulics, architecture, zoology, botany, agronomy, medicine, anthropology, archeology, and more.&lt;ref name="needham volume 1 136"&gt;Needham, Volume 1, 136.&lt;/ref&gt;  As for Shen Kuo's equally brilliant peer, Su Song created a celestial atlas of five different [[star map]]s, wrote the 1070 AD pharmaceutical treatise of the ''Ben Cao Tu Jing'' (Illustrated Pharmacopoeia), which had the related subjects of botany, zoology, metallurgy, and mineralogy, and wrote his famous [[horology|horological]] treatise of the ''Xin Yi Xiang Fa Yao'' in 1092 AD, which described in full detail his ingenious [[Astronomical clock|astronomical]] clock tower constructed in the capital city of [[Kaifeng]].&lt;ref&gt;Sivin, III, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 208 278"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 208 &amp; 278.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 445 448"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 445–448.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bodde 140"&gt;Bodde, 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Although these two figures were perhaps the greatest technical authors in their field during the time, there were many others. For producing textiles, Qin Guan's book of 1090 AD, the ''Can Shu'' (Book of [[Sericulture]]), included description of a silk-reeling machine that incorporated the earliest known use of the [[Belt (mechanical)|mechanical belt drive]] in order to function.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 107-108"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt; In the literary field of [[agronomy]], there was the ''Jiu Huang Huo Min Shu'' (The Rescue of the People; a Treatise on [[Famine]] Prevention and Relief) edited by Dong Wei in the 12th century, the ''Cha Lu'' (Record of [[Tea]]) written by [[Cai Xiang]] in 1060 AD, the ''Zhu Zi Cang Fa'' (Master Zhu on Managing Communal [[Granary|Granaries]]) written by [[Zhu Xi]] in 1182 AD, and many others.&lt;ref name="needham volume 6 part 2 621"&gt;Needham, Volume 6, Part 2, 621.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="needham volume 6 part 2 623"&gt;Needham, Volume 6, Part 2, 623.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also great authors of written works pertaining to geography and cartography during the Song, such as Yue Shi (his book in 983), Wang Zhu (in 1051), Li Dechu (in 1080), Chen Kunchen (in 1111), Ouyang Wen (in 1117), and Zhu Mu (in 1240).&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 521"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 521.&lt;/ref&gt; Although an early form of the local geographic [[gazetteer]] existed in China since the 1st century, the matured form known as "treatise on a place", or ''fangzhi'', replaced the old "map guide", or ''tujing'', under the Song.&lt;ref name="bol 44"&gt;Bol, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The major differences between the two were that ''fangzhi'' were products of local initiative and decision-making, were typically ten to fifty chapters in length, and were almost always printed for a large audience, whereas ''tujing'' were products of infrequent demands from the central government and were typically only four chapters long.&lt;ref name="bol 46"&gt;Bol, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The widespread availability of printing in the Song allowed many ordinary people to access materials that were once read almost exclusively by experts, such as printed texts and handbooks on agriculture, childbirth, [[Traditional Chinese medicine|pharmacy and medicine]], [[Economy of the Song dynasty|domestic economics]], [[History of geography#China|geography]], divination, and Taoist rituals.&lt;ref name="ebrey cambridge 158"&gt;Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hymes 3"&gt;Hymes, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chinese opera|Theatre and drama in China]] trace their roots back to the academy of music known as the [[Pear Garden]], founded in the early 8th century during the Tang dynasty. However, historian Stephen H. West asserts that the Northern Song era capital [[Kaifeng]] was the first real center where the performing arts became "an industry, a conglomerate involving theatre, gambling, prostitution, and food."&lt;ref name="west 69"&gt;West, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise in consumption by merchants and scholar-officials, he states, "accelerated the growth of both the performance and the food industries," asserting a direct link between the two due to their close proximity within the cities.&lt;ref name="west 69 74"&gt;West, 69 &amp; 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the fifty some theatres located in the 'pleasure districts' of Kaifeng, four of these theatres were large enough to entertain audiences of several thousand each, drawing huge crowds which nearby businesses thrived upon.&lt;ref name="west 76"&gt;West, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The chief crowd that gathered was composed of those from [[Four occupations|the merchant class]], while [[Scholar-bureaucrats|government officials]] only went to restaurants and attended theatre performances during holidays.&lt;ref name="west 98"&gt;West, 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Kaifeng, the ''[[zaju]]'' dramatic style employed the ''beiqu'' style of poetic lyrics.&lt;ref name="west 69"/&gt; After the capital had shifted to [[Hangzhou]], the dramatic style of ''xiwen'' (also ''[[nanxi (Chinese opera)|nanxi]]'' or ''nanqu'') developed separately.&lt;ref&gt;West, 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; These two different regional genres of musical drama used different regional dialects of speech, recitation, and dialogue, entailed their own unique sets of role types (''juese''), and employed different types of [[Music of China|musical instruments playing different tunes]].&lt;ref name="west 70"&gt;West, 70.&lt;/ref&gt; In Kaifeng drama, one singer was preferred for each play, accompanied by string and percussion instruments.&lt;ref name="west 70"/&gt; In Hangzhou drama, there was a multitude of singers on stage for each set, while string and wind instruments were preferred.&lt;ref name="west 70"/&gt;

Color and clothing distinguished the rank of theatre actors in the Song.&lt;ref name="gernet 223"&gt;Gernet, 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to vendors who wore specific outfits to identify which guild they belonged to, actors' generic costumes reflected the role type they played on stage, whether it be student, young man, young woman, official, soldier, etc.&lt;ref name="west 87"/&gt; Actors honed their theatrical skills at drama schools.&lt;ref name="gernet 223"/&gt; Musicians also found work in the theatre industry, since plays performed in the markets were often accompanied by music.&lt;ref name="gernet 223"/&gt; Actors on stage always spoke their lines in [[Classical Chinese]]; [[vernacular Chinese]] that imitated the [[Old Mandarin|common spoken language]] was not introduced into theatrical performances until the [[Yuan dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Rossabi, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Although trained to speak in the erudite Classical language, acting troupes commonly drew their membership from one of the lowest classes in society: prostitutes.&lt;ref name="west 72"&gt;West, 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Themes enjoyed in stage skits varied from satires about corrupt officials to comedy acts with titles like "Setting fire when delivering the soup," "Raising a ruckus in the winehouse," "The peony smells best when the wine is stolen," and "Catching a monkey in a restaurant."&lt;ref name="west 78"&gt;West, 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gernet 224"&gt;Gernet, 224.&lt;/ref&gt; The only ''xiwen'' play to have survived from the Southern Song era is the ''Zhang Xie zhuang yuan'' (张協狀元), featuring interludes such as a clown stealing food and wine at a wedding banquet in act 16 and a quick comedy sketch about renting a room in act 24.&lt;ref name="west 79"&gt;West, 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surprisingly, actors on stage did not have a wholesale monopoly on theatrical entertainment, as even vendors and peddlers in the street, singing lewd songs and beating on whatever they could find to compensate for percussion instruments, could draw crowds.&lt;ref name="west 83 85"&gt;West, 83–85&lt;/ref&gt; This practice was so widespread that West claims "the city itself was turned into a stage and the citizens into the essential audience."&lt;ref name="west 85"&gt;West, 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the songs played for stage performances were tunes that originated from vendors' and peddlers' songs.&lt;ref name="west 91"&gt;West, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Contests were held on New Year's Day to determine which vendor or peddler had the best chants and songs while selling wares; the winners were brought before the imperial court to perform.&lt;ref name="west 85"/&gt; The ''Wulin jiushi'' of the Southern Song states that these vendors, when presented to the consorts and concubines of the palace, were lavished with heaps of gold and pearls for their wares; some vendors would "become rich in a single evening."&lt;ref name="west 87"/&gt; Theatrical stunts were also performed to gain attention, such as fried-glutinous-rice-ball vendors hanging small red lamps on portable bamboo racks who would twirl them around to the beat of a drum to dazzle crowds.&lt;ref name="west 86"&gt;West, 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Puppet shows in the streets and wards were also popular.&lt;ref name="west 87"&gt;West, 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivities==
{{main article|Traditional Chinese holidays}}
[[File:Qingming Festival 3.jpg|alt=A long, landscape oriented segment of scroll depicting throngs of people, mainly men, crossing a bridge over a large river. The atmosphere is chaotic.|thumb|left|300px|A small section of the ''Qingming Shang He Tu'' ([[Along the River During Qingming Festival]]), a large horizontal scroll painting by [[Zhang Zeduan]] (1085–1145)]]
In ancient China there were many domestic and public pleasures in the rich urban environment unique to the Song dynasty. For the austere and hardworking peasantry, annual festivals and holidays provided a time of joy and relaxation, and for the poorest it meant a chance to borrow food and alcoholic drink so that everyone could join in the celebration.&lt;ref name="gernet 106"/&gt; People would gather around their local sanctuary to observe the festival's games, theatrical entertainments, juggling, clowning, and other performances.&lt;ref name="gernet 106"&gt;Gernet, 106.&lt;/ref&gt; The festivities on New Years were considered the most important of the year by the Chinese, its momentous occasion correlating with the beginning of February on the Western calendar.&lt;ref name="gernet 106" /&gt; Preparations for the New Years festival took place over a month's time, as people busied themselves painting [[door god]]s, crafting paper streamers with lucky characters for "welcoming the spring," making printed images of [[Zhong Kui]], and cooking special kinds of foods such as porridge of red haricot beans.&lt;ref name="gernet 186"&gt;Gernet, 186.&lt;/ref&gt; The widely popular [[Lantern Festival]] was held every 15th day of 1st lunar month. According to the literatus and official [[Zhou Mi (scholar)|Zhou Mi]] (1232–1298 AD), during the Xiao-Zong period (1163–1189 AD) the best lantern festivals were held at [[Suzhou]] and [[Fuzhou]], while [[Hangzhou]] was also known for the its great variety of colorful [[paper lantern]]s, in all shapes and sizes.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 128"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 1, 128.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meng Yuanlao]] (active 1126–1147) recalled in [[Dongjing Meng Hua Lu (Dreams of Splendor of the Eastern Capital)]] how the earlier Northern Song capital at [[Kaifeng]] would host festivals with tens of thousands of colorful and brightly lit paper lanterns hoisted on long poles up and down the main street, the poles also wrapped in colorful silk with numerous dramatic paper figures flying in the wind like fairies.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 128"/&gt; There were also other venerated holidays, such as the [[Qingming Festival]], as it was supposedly this period of the year that was depicted in the artwork (mentioned above) by the artist [[Zhang Zeduan]] (although some would argue the painting actually represented the time of autumn in the year).

With the advent of the discovery of [[gunpowder]] in China, lavish [[fireworks]] displays could also be held during festivities. For example, the martial demonstration in 1110 AD to entertain the court of [[Emperor Huizong of Song|Emperor Huizong]], when it was recorded that a large fireworks display was held alongside Chinese dancers in strange costumes moving through clouds of colored smoke in their performance.&lt;ref name="kelly 2"&gt;Kelly, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The common people also purchased firecrackers from city shopkeepers and vendors, made of simple sticks of bamboo filled with a small amount of gunpowder.&lt;ref name="gernet 186"/&gt;

Although they were discontinued after the devastation of the [[Anshi Rebellion]] (755–763) during the [[Tang dynasty]], lavish Chinese carnivals were revived and once again celebrated during the Song dynasty.&lt;ref name="benn 157"&gt;Benn, 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese carnival celebrations were held nationwide when the emperor felt a great occasion warranted a grand display of his benevolence and generosity, such as renowned military victories, abundant harvests after long droughts or famines, the granting of grand amnesties by the throne, sacrifices to deities, the installation of a crown prince, marriages within the imperial family, etc.&lt;ref name="benn 154 155"&gt;Benn, 154–155.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many types of clothing and different clothing trends in the Song period, yet clothes in China were always modeled after the seasons and as outward symbols of one's social class.&lt;ref name="gernet 127"/&gt; [[Coal]] used for heating one's home was scarce and often expensive, so people often wore clothing with extra silk-floss and fur-lined coats in the winter.&lt;ref name="gernet 127"&gt;Gernet, 127.&lt;/ref&gt; The clothing material preferred by the rich was [[silk]], and for special occasions they had [[Han Chinese clothing|silk robes]] with gold [[brocade]].&lt;ref name="gernet 130"/&gt; The clothing material used by the poor was often [[hemp]]en cloth, but cotton clothes were also used, the latter being most widely available in [[Northern and southern China|the south]].&lt;ref name="gernet 130"/&gt; The types of clothes worn by peasants and commoners were largely uniform in appearance (with color standard of black and white),&lt;ref name="gernet 128"&gt;Gernet, 128.&lt;/ref&gt; and so was the case for the upper class and elite. In fact, wealthy and leading members of society followed accepted guidelines and ritual requirements for clothing. In the upper class, each stratified grade in the social hierarchy was distinguished by the color and specific ornamentation of robes, the shape and type of headgear, and even the style of girdle worn.&lt;ref name="gernet 127 128"&gt;Gernet, 127–128.&lt;/ref&gt; This rigid order was especially so during the beginning of the dynasty. However, the lines of hierarchy slowly began to blur as the color purple, once reserved solely for the attire of third rank officials or higher, began to diffuse amongst all ranks of officials who bore the color indiscriminately.&lt;ref name="gernet 128"/&gt; Along with lower grade civil officials in the government protesting the rigid regulations for attire, the wealthy members of the merchant class also contributed to the disintegration of rules for ceremonial attire worn only by certain members of society.&lt;ref name="gernet 129"&gt;Gernet, 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet there were still visible distinctions between civil officials and the class of rich merchants and business owners; the officials were distinguished by their long robes reaching to the ground, while merchants often wore a blouse that came down below the waist with trousers.&lt;ref name="gernet 129"/&gt; Pants and trousers were introduced to China during the [[Warring States]] in the 4th century BC, and were not exclusive to merchants;&lt;ref name="gernet 130"&gt;Gernet, 130.&lt;/ref&gt; every soldier wore trousers as part of his uniform, while trousers were also worn by the common people.&lt;ref name="gernet 130"/&gt; Although most men were cleanshaven, soldiers, military officers, and [[Chinese martial arts|professional boxing]] champions preferred side-whiskers and goatee beards, as they were a sign of virility.&lt;ref name="gernet 131"&gt;Gernet, 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

The attire of Song women was distinguished from men's clothing by being fastened on the left, not on the right.&lt;ref name="gernet 129"/&gt; Women wore long dresses or blouses that came down almost to the knee.&lt;ref name="gernet 129"/&gt; They also wore skirts and jackets with short or long sleeves.&lt;ref name="gernet 129"/&gt; When strolling about outside and along the road, women of wealthy means chose to wear square purple [[scarf|scarves]] around their shoulders.&lt;ref name="gernet 129"/&gt; Ladies also wore hairpins and combs in their hair, while princesses, imperial concubines, and the wives of officials and wealthy merchants wore head ornaments of gold and silver that were shaped in the form of [[fenghuang|phoenixes]] and flowers.&lt;ref name="gernet 130"/&gt;

People in the Song dynasty never left their homes barefoot, and always had some sort of headgear on.&lt;ref name="gernet 130"/&gt; Shops in the city specialized in certain types of hats and headgear, including caps with pointed tails, as well as belts and waistwraps.&lt;ref name="west 71"&gt;West, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Only Buddhist monks shaved their heads and strolled about with no headgear or hat of any sort to cover their heads.&lt;ref name="gernet 130"/&gt; For footwear, people could purchase leather shoes called 'oiled footwear', wooden sandals, hempen sandals, and the more expensive satin slippers.&lt;ref name="gernet 130"/&gt;

==Food and cuisine==
{{Further information|History of Chinese cuisine}}
[[File:Ziziphus jujuba MS 2461.JPG|alt=A bowl of reddish purple, oval shaped fruits with raisin texture.|thumb|right|200px|Dried [[jujube]]s such as these were imported to Song China from South Asia and the Middle East. An official from [[Guangzhou|Canton]] was invited to the home of an Arab merchant, and described the jujube as thus: "This fruit is the color of sugar, its skin and its pulp are sweet, and it gives the impression, when you eat it, of having first been cooked in the oven and then allowed to dry."&lt;ref name="gernet 134"/&gt;]]
From the Song period, works such as [[Dongjing Meng Hua Lu (Dreams of Splendor of the Eastern Capital)]] preserve lists of names for entrées and food dishes in customer [[menu]]s for restaurants and taverns, as well as for feasts at banquets, festivals and carnivals, and modest dining. Many of the peculiar names for these dishes do not provide clues as to what types of food ingredients were used. However, judging from the listed seasonings they used for these dishes, such as pepper, ginger, [[soya sauce]], oil, salt, and vinegar, Song era cuisine is perhaps not too different from the Chinese cuisine of today.&lt;ref name="gernet 133"&gt;Gernet, 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Other additional seasonings and ingredients included walnuts, turnips, crushed Chinese [[cardamon]] kernels, [[fagara]], olives, [[Ginkgo biloba|ginkgo nuts]], citrus zest, and sesame oil.&lt;ref name="west 86"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West, 73, footnote 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional differences in culture brought about different types of foods, while in certain areas the cooking traditions of regional cultures blended together; such was the case of the Southern Song capital at [[Hangzhou]].&lt;ref name="gernet 133"/&gt; After the mass exodus from the north, people brought [[Henan]]-style cooking and foods (popular in the previous Northern Song capital at [[Kaifeng]]) to Hangzhou, which was blended with the cooking traditions of [[Zhejiang]].&lt;ref name="gernet 133"/&gt; However, records indicate that already in the Northern Song period, the first capital at Kaifeng sported restaurants that served southern Chinese cuisine.&lt;ref name="west 70"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gernet 133"/&gt; This catered to capital officials whose native provinces were in the southeast, and would have found northern cuisine lacking in sufficient seasoning for their tastes.&lt;ref name="gernet 133"/&gt; In fact, texts from the Song era provide the first use of the phrases ''nanshi'', ''beishi'', and ''chuanfan'' to refer specifically to northern, southern, and Sichuan cooking, respectively.&lt;ref name="west 70"/&gt; Many restaurants were known for their specialties; for example, there was one restaurant in Hangzhou that served only iced foods,&lt;ref name="gernet 137"/&gt; while some restaurants catered to those who wanted either hot, warm, room temperature, or cold foods.&lt;ref name="west 93"&gt;West, 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Descendants of those from Kaifeng owned most of the restaurants found in Hangzhou,&lt;ref name="gernet 133 134"&gt;Gernet, 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; but many other regional varieties in foodstuffs and cooking were sponsored by restaurants. This included restaurants catering [[Szechuan cuisine|Sichuan cuisine]] that emphasized use of pepper, dishes and beverages from [[Hebei]] and [[Shandong]], and coastal foods of [[shrimp]] and saltwater fish.&lt;ref name="gernet 134"&gt;Gernet, 134.&lt;/ref&gt; The memory and patience of waiters had to be keen; in the larger restaurants, serving dinner parties that required twenty or so dishes became a hassle if even a slight error occurred.&lt;ref name="west 93" /&gt; If a guest reported the mistake of a waiter to the head of the restaurant, the waiter could be verbally reprimanded, have his salary docked, or in extreme cases, kicked out of the establishment for good.&lt;ref name="west 93" /&gt;

[[File:文會圖.jpg|alt=Twelve people gather around an outdoor table decorated with a black tablecloth, several potted plants, and dozens and dozens of small dishes.

In the early morning in Hangzhou, along the wide avenue of the Imperial Way, special breakfast items and delicacies were sold.&lt;ref name="gernet 183 184"&gt;Gernet, 183–184&lt;/ref&gt; This included fried [[tripe]], pieces of [[mutton]] or [[goose]], soups of various kinds, hot pancakes, steamed pancakes, and iced cakes.&lt;ref name="gernet 183 184"/&gt; [[Chinese noodles|Noodle shops]] were also popular, and remained open all day and night along the Imperial Way.&lt;ref name="gernet 184"&gt;Gernet, 184.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one Song source on Kaifeng, the night markets closed at the third night watch but reopened on the fifth, while they had also gained a reputation for staying open during winter storms and the darkest, rainiest days of winter.&lt;ref name="west 73"/&gt;

There were also some exotic foreign foods imported to China from abroad, including raisins, dates, Persian [[jujube]]s, and [[Wine in China|grape wine]]; [[rice wine]] was more common in China, a fact noted even by the 13th century [[Venice|Venetian]] traveler [[Marco Polo]].&lt;ref name="gernet 134 135"&gt;Gernet, 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt; Although grape-based wine had been known in China since the ancient Han dynasty Chinese ventured into [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] Central Asia, grape-wine was often reserved for the elite.&lt;ref name="gernet 134"/&gt; Besides wine, other beverages included pear juice, [[lychee]] fruit juice, honey and ginger drinks, tea, and pawpaw juice.&lt;ref name="gernet 138"&gt;Gernet, 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gernet 184 185"&gt;Gernet, 184–185.&lt;/ref&gt; Dairy products and farming were foreign concepts to the Chinese, which explains the absence of cheese and milk in their diet.&lt;ref name="gernet 135"&gt;Gernet, 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Beef was also rarely eaten, since the bull was an important draft animal.&lt;ref name="gernet 135"/&gt; The main diet of the lower classes remained rice, pork, and salted fish, while it is known from restaurant dinner menus that the upper classes did not eat dog meat.&lt;ref name="gernet 136"/&gt; The rich are known to have consumed an array of different meats, such as chicken, shellfish, fallow deer, hares, partridge, pheasant, [[francolin]], quail, fox, badger, clam, crab, and many others.&lt;ref name="west 86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gernet 137"&gt;Gernet, 137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="west 73"/&gt; Local freshwater fish from the nearby lake and river were also caught and brought to market,&lt;ref name="gernet 135"/&gt; while the [[West Lake]] provided geese and duck as well.&lt;ref name="gernet 136"&gt;Gernet, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Common fruits that were consumed included melons, pomegranates, [[lychee]]s, [[longan]]s, [[Orange (fruit)|golden oranges]], jujubes, Chinese and Japanese [[quince]]s, apricots and pears; in the region around Hangzhou alone, there were eleven kinds of apricots and eight different kinds of pears that were produced.&lt;ref name="west 86" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gernet 135"/&gt;&lt;ref name="west 73 74"&gt;West, 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; Specialties and combination dishes in the Song period included scented shellfish cooked in rice-wine, geese with apricots, [[lotus seed|lotus-seed]] soup, spicy soup with mussels and fish cooked with plums, sweet soya soup, baked sesame buns stuffed with either sour bean filling or pork tenderloin, mixed vegetable buns, fragrant candied fruit, strips of ginger and fermented beanpaste, jujube-stuffed steamed dumplings, fried chestnuts, salted fermented bean soup, fruit cooked in scented honey, and 'honey crisps' of kneaded and baked honey, flour, mutton fat and pork lard.&lt;ref name="west 86" /&gt;&lt;ref name="west 73"&gt;West, 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rossabi 78"&gt;Rossabi, 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="west 75"&gt;West, 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West, 75, footnote 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Dessert molds of oiled flour and sugared honey were shaped into girls' faces or statuettes of soldiers with full armor like door guards, and were called "likeness foods" (''guoshi'').&lt;ref name="west 89"&gt;West, 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{main article|Chinese philosophy|Chinese Buddhism}}
[[File:Wood Bodhisattva.jpg|left|thumb|230px|alt=A wooden carving of a female human figure, sitting with one knee on the ground and one knee pointing up, with a hand resting on that knee. The carving includes loose fitting clothing, which is covered mainly in gold foil.|A wooden [[Bodhisattva]] statue from the Song dynasty]]
Song intellectuals sought answers to all philosophical and political questions in the [[Chinese classics#Before 221 BCE|Confucian Classics]]. This renewed interest in the Confucian ideals and society of ancient times coincided with the decline of [[Buddhism]], which was then largely regarded as foreign, and as offering few solutions for practical problems. However, Buddhism in this period continued as a cultural underlay to the more accepted Confucianism and even [[Taoism]], both seen as native and pure by conservative Neo-Confucians. The continuing popularity of Buddhism can be seen with strong evidence by achievements in the arts, such as the 100 painting set of the ''Five Hundred Luohan'', completed by [[Lin Tinggui]] and [[Zhou Jichang]] in 1178.

The conservative Confucian movement could be seen before the likes of Zhu Xi (1130–1200), with staunch anti-Buddhists such as Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072). In his written work of the ''Ben-lun'', he wrote of his theory for how Buddhism had so easily penetrated Chinese culture during the earlier [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] period. He argued that Buddhism became widely accepted when China's traditional institutions were weakened at the time. This was due to many factors, such as foreign [[Xianbei]] ruling over the north, and China's political schism that caused warfare and other ills. Although [[Emperor Wen of Sui]] (r. 581–604) abolished the Nine Ranks in favor of a Confucian-taught bureaucracy drafted through civil service examinations, he also heavily sponsored the popular ideology of Buddhism to legitimate his rule. Hence, it was given free rein and influence to flourish and dominate Chinese culture during the Sui and Tang periods; historian [[Arthur F. Wright]] describes Confucianism in this period as being reverted to a state of "stale archaism".&lt;ref name="Wright 92"&gt;Wright, 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Ouyang Xiu wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"This curse [Buddhism] has overspread the empire for a thousand years, and what can one man in one day do about it? The people are drunk with it, and it has entered the marrow of their bones; it is surely not to be overcome by eloquent talk. What, then, is to be done?&lt;ref name="Wright 88"&gt;Wright, 88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Chinesischer Maler von 1238 001.jpg|alt=A portrait of an older, balding man in a half pale green and half sky blue robe. He is sitting on an armchair holding a thin wooden stick, possibally a folded up fan.|thumb|right|200px|Portrait of the Chinese [[Zen]] Buddhist [[Wuzhun Shifan]], painted in 1238 AD.]]
In conclusion on how to root out the 'evil' that was Buddhism, Ouyang Xiu presented a historical example of how it could be uprooted from Chinese culture:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of old, in the time of the [[Warring States]], Yang Zhu and Mo Di were engaged in violent controversy. [[Mencius]] deplored this and devoted himself to teaching benevolence and righteousness. His exposition of benevolence and righteoussness won the day, and the teachings of Mo Di and Yang Zhu were extirpated. In Han times the myriad schools of thought all flourished together. Tung Chung-shu deplored this and revived Confucianism. Therefore the Way of Confucius shone forth, and the myriad schools expired. This is the effect of what I have called "correcting the root cause in order to overcome the evil".&lt;ref name="Wright 89"&gt;Wright, 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Confucianism was cast in stark contrast to the perceived alien and morally inept Buddhism by those such as Ouyang Xiu, Confucianism nonetheless borrowed ideals of Buddhism to provide for its own revival. From [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, the [[Bodhisattva]] ideal of ethical universalism with benevolent charity and relief to those in need inspired those such as Fan Zhongyan and Wang Anshi, along with the Song government.&lt;ref name="Wright 93"&gt;Wright, 93.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the earlier heavily Buddhist Tang period, where wealthy and pious Buddhist families and Buddhist temples handled much of the charity and alms to the poor, the Song government took on this ideal role instead, through its various programs of welfare and charity (refer to Society section).&lt;ref name="Wright 93 94"&gt;Wright, 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the historian Arthur F. Wright notes this situation during the Song period, with philosophical nativism taking from Buddhism its earlier benevolent role:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is true that Buddhist monks were given official appointments as managers of many of these enterprises, but the initiative came from Neo-Confucian officials. In a sense the Buddhist idea of compassion and many of the measures developed for its practical expression had been appropriated by the Chinese state.&lt;ref name="Wright 94"&gt;Wright, 94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Porcelaine chinoise Guimet 231104.jpg|alt=A small, green-grey statuette of a lion, sitting down and looking upwards. The lion's limbs are thin and angular.|thumb|left|180px|A seated lion statue, [[celadon]], from Yaozhou, [[Shaanxi]], 11th to 12th century.]]
Although Buddhism lost its prominence in the elite circles and government sponsorships of Chinese society, this did not mean the disappeance of Buddhism from Chinese culture. [[Zen]] Buddhism continued to flourish during the Song period, as [[Emperor Lizong of Song]] had the monk [[Wuzhun Shifan]] share the Chán (Zen) doctrine with the imperial court. Much like the [[Eastern Roman Emperor]] [[Julian the Apostate]] promoting Roman paganism and [[Theurgy]] amongst the leading members of Roman society while pushing [[Christianity]]'s influence into the lower classes, so too did Neo-Confucians of the 13th century succeed in driving Buddhism out of the higher echelons of Chinese society.&lt;ref name="brown 93"&gt;Brown, 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of Buddhist [[metaphysics]], [[Zhou Dunyi]] influenced the beliefs and teachings of Northern Song-era Confucian scholars such as [[Cheng Hao]] and [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] (who were brothers), and was a major influence for Zhu Xi, one of the leading architects of [[Neo-Confucianism]]. They emphasized moral self-cultivation over service to the ruler of the state (healing society's ills from the bottom-up, not the top-down), as opposed to statesmen like Fan Zhongyan or Su Shi, who pursued their agenda to advise the ruler to make the best decisions for the common good of all.&lt;ref name="ebrey 168"&gt;Ebrey et al., 168.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cheng brothers also taught that the workings of nature and metaphysics could be taught through the principle (li) and the vital energy (qi). The principle of nature could be moral or physical, such as the principle of marriage being moral, while the principle of trees is physical. Yet for principles to exist and function normally, there would have to be substance as well as vital energy.&lt;ref name="ebrey 168"/&gt; This allowed Song intellectuals to validate the teachings of Mencius on the innate goodness of human nature, while at the same time providing an explanation for human wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="ebrey 168"/&gt; In essence, the principle underlying a human being is good and benevolent, but vital energy has the potential to go astray and be corrupted, giving rise to selfish impulses and all other negative human traits.

The Song [[Neo-Confucian]] philosophers, finding a certain purity in the originality of the ancient classical texts, wrote commentaries on them. The most influential of these philosophers was Zhu Xi, whose synthesis of Confucian thought and Buddhist, [[Taoism|Taoist]], and other ideas became the official imperial ideology from late Song times to the late 19th century. The basis of his teaching was influenced by the Cheng brothers, but he greatly extended their teachings, forming the core of Neo-Confucianism. This included emphasis on the Four Books: the ''Analects'', ''Mencius'', ''Doctrine of the Mean'', and the ''Great Learning'' (the latter two being chapters in the ancient [[Book of Rites]]). His viewpoint was that improvement of the world began with improvement of the mind, as outlined in the ''Great Learning''.&lt;ref name="ebrey 169"&gt;Ebrey et al., 169.&lt;/ref&gt; His approach to Confucianism was shunned by his contemporaries, as his writings were forbidden to be cited by students taking the Imperial Examinations. However, [[Emperor Lizong of Song]] found his writing to be intriguing, reversing the policy against him, and making it a requirement for students to study his commentaries on the Four Books.&lt;ref name="ebrey 169"/&gt;

==History==
After training in [[Dublin]], Ireland and [[Pennsylvania]], Shane de Blacam (born 1945)&lt;ref&gt;[http://two.archiseek.com/2009/shane-de-blacam-b1945/ "de Blacam, Shane (b. 1945)"], Archiseek website&lt;/ref&gt; worked for Chamberlain Powell &amp; Bon on the [[Barbican Centre]] in London and for [[Louis Khan]] in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="Architects Today"/&gt; John Meagher (born 1947)&lt;ref&gt;[http://two.archiseek.com/2009/john-meagher-b1947/ "Meagher, John (b. 1947)"], Archiseek website&lt;/ref&gt; studied at [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] and for a year at [[Helsinki School of Architecture]] in 1971,&lt;ref name="Architects Today"/&gt; and also worked early in his career in the United States for [[Venturi Scott Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarah A. Lappin ''Full Irish: new architecture in Ireland'', New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 2009, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

De Blacam &amp; Meagher were the principal exhibitors in the Irish Pavilion at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="Venice2010"/&gt; The historian [[R. F. Foster (historian)|Roy Foster]], particularly referring to the firm's work in Dublin wrote in the exhibition catalogue of their commission's "masterly introduction of light, the texture of appropriate materials (brick, hardwood, pre-patinated copper) a use of space and volume at once imaginative and respectful of their surroundings."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Frank McDonald [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2010/0904/1224278167635.html "On bricks and water",] ''Irish Times'', 4 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rewards==
The practice has won a number of awards. The [[Chapel of Reconciliation]] at the Catholic shrine at [[Knock, Ireland]] (1990) was the first Irish finalist in the [[Mies van der Rohe]] award for European architecture.&lt;ref name="O'Toole"&gt;Shane O'Toole [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article1015900.ece "Architecture: Pump up the volumes",] ''The Times'', 16 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The Beckett Theatre at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] won the [[Architectural Association of Ireland]]'s Downes Bronze Medal in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://architecturalassociation.ie/awards/winners/_1993/ "AAI Awards 8 -1993"], Architectural Association of Ireland website&lt;/ref&gt; De Blacam was presented with the Gold Medal of the [[Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland]] (RIAI) in 2003 by the President of Ireland [[Mary McAleese]] for a library and information technology extension at [[Cork University]] (opened 1996).&lt;ref name="O'Toole"/&gt; Another project of the practice, the renovation of the [[Abbeyleix]] Library in [[Leinster]] won the RIAI Best Conservation/Restoration Project Award in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irisharchitectureawards.ie/index.php/annual-awards/2009/library_abbeyleix/ "Abbeyleix Library"], RIAI website&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary|εἴσοδος}}

'''Eisodos''' (or eisodoi) is a term used for [[Theatre of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek Plays]] in order to describe either of two passageways leading into the orchestra, between [[theatron]] and [[Skene (theatre)|skenê]] (also known as the [[parodos]]).

It was used as the exit for the chorus from the orchestra. It has also been called ersodoi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53381">{{Feminism sidebar}}'''Feminist poetry''' is inspired by, promotes, or elaborates on feminist principles and ideas.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/collections/146073/poetry-and-feminism|title=Poetry and Feminism|last=Golden|first=Shyama|date=|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It might be written with the conscious aim of expressing feminist principles, although sometimes it is identified as feminist by critics in a later era.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some writers are thought to express feminist ideas even if the writer was not an active member of the political movement during their era.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Many feminist movements, however, have embraced poetry as a vehicle for communicating with public audiences through anthologies, poetry collections, and public readings.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Formally, feminist poetry often seeks to challenge assumptions about language and meaning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It usually foregrounds women's experiences as valid and worthy of attention, and it also highlights the lived experiences of minorities and other less privileged subjects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sometimes feminist poems seek to embody specific women's experiences, and they are often [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] registering specific forms of oppression depending on identities related to race, sexuality, gender presentation, disability, or immigration status.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This has led to feminist writing journals like [http://sotospeakjournal.org/about-so-to-speak/ So To Speak] providing a statement of intention to publish the work of women and [[Genderqueer|nonbinary]] people in particular.

Kim Whitehead states that feminist poetry has "no identifiable birth date," but there are a few key figures identified as early proponents of feminist ideas, and who convey their politics through poetry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Feminist Poetry Movement|last=Whitehead|first=Kim|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=1996|isbn=|location=Jackson MI|pages=3, ix-x, xii, xv, xvi, xviii, xviii-ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of first feminist poet is often given to [[Sappho]], at least in part because she seems to write about female [[homosexuality]] in [[Ancient Greece]], a culture and time when [[lesbian]] sexuality was usually ignored or erased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43477494|title=Reading Sappho : contemporary approaches|date=1996|publisher=University of California Press|others=Greene, Ellen, 1950-|isbn=9780520918061|location=Berkeley|oclc=43477494}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jannerson|first=Deb|date=2011|title='ADVENTURES IN FEMINISTORY: SAPPHO'|url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/post/adventures-in-feministory-sappho|journal=Bitch Media|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Catalano|first=Gabby|date=|title=How This Historic Icon Influenced Feminist Writers Today|url=http://www.womensmediacenter.com/fbomb/how-this-historic-icon-influenced-feminist-writers-today|journal=Women's Media Centre|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist Poetry in Asia==
[[File:Toru Dutt.jpg|thumb|Toru Dutt]]

=== Feminist Aspects of Sanskrit Writing ===

The beginning of works categorised as literature in India began with the [[Sanskrit]] term ''[[kāvya]]'', a discourse separate from science or from the purely oral, and specific literary style that included works thought to contain a kind of soulfulness.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/70701869|title=The language of the gods in the world of men : Sanskrit, culture, and power in premodern India|last=Pollock|first=Sheldon I.|date=2006|publisher=University of California Press|year=|isbn=9780520932029|location=Berkeley|pages=3, 16, 19, 126|oclc=70701869}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this early period, men were often posed as poets, and women as a kind of muse, as in the tenth century explanation for the origins of Indian literary culture:  Poem Man's wife ("Poetics") chases him across [[South Asia]] creating varying kinds of literature across the region.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Poetry was certainly an important part of political cultural life in the [[Sanskrit]] cosmopolis, and some women contributed; for example the poet [[Rajashekhara|Rajasekhara]] tells of women in different regions who entertain with songs.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

The early civilisation of [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] country in modern-day Cambodia cultivated a literature in [[Sanskrit]], and diverged from its neighbours in creating a strain of poetry from the fifth century to the thirteenth century in which women were a source of praise and admiration.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Take for example the Mebon Inscription of [[Rajendravarman II|Rājendravarman]], which features eulogies for specific women of note, and which is, according to Sheldon I. Pollock, "without obvious parallel in South Asia," and may be related to "specific kinship structures in the region."&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Nineteenth Century Feminist Poets in India ===

Early anglophone women poets in India blended native traditions and literary models from Europe.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/739722886|title=Anglophone poetry in colonial India, 1780-1913 : a critical anthology|last=|first=|date=2011|publisher=Ohio University Press|others=Gibson, Mary Ellis, 1952-|year=|isbn=9780821443576|location=Athens|pages=287–288, 294–297, 363–371|oclc=739722886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst these early feminists, the Dutt Sisters - [[Toru Dutt]] (1856-1877) and Aru Dutt (1854-1874) stand out, and are sometimes compared to the [[Brontë family|Brontë Sisters]] in England.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The Dutt sisters came from a family of poets, including their father Govind Chandra Dutt, and their access to education was unprecedented.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The mother of the family Kshetramoni Mitter Dutt along with all three children - Toru, Aru, and their brother Abju Dutt, had received an education in English, and to some extent, in the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] language.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The family had a reformist bent, and some members had converted to Christianity.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Both sisters visited England in the 1870s, and attended the higher lectures for women at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. Toru Dutt's poetry in particular has been labelled extraordinary, because her writing "created a new idiom in Indian English verse."&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Spanning the turn from the nineteenth to twentieth century, [[Sarojini Naidu]] (1879–1949) represents a figure for whom politics and poetry are intertwined.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Like the Dutt Sisters, Naidu was allowed access to all the educational resources she desired, and she passed the [[University of Madras|Madras University]] matriculation examination at age 12. She came from a large and free-thinking family.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Her father, [[Aghorenath Chattopadhyay]], was a well-regarded doctor, known for his educational reforms, and her mother, Barada Sundari Devi, was educated at a [[Brahmo]] school.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Naidu had seven siblings all of whom made contribution to Indian life, for example her brother [[Virendranath Chattopadhyaya|Virendranath Chattopadhyay]] was an Indian revolutionary.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Naidu studied at [[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton College]], Cambridge, which brough her into contact with writers of the day, including [[Arthur Symons]], and [[W. B. Yeats|W.B. Yeats]].&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Ultimately, Naidu's unconventional upbringing and education were catalysts for her intellectual powers, since as she writes in her roman-de-clef 'Sulani,' ""Unlike the girls of her own nation, she had been brought up in an atmosphere of large un-convention and culture and absolute freedom of thought and action."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Sunalini," ms.|last=Naidu|first=Sarojini|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=British Library.|pages=EUr.A.95}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her marriage to Govindarajulu Naidu - controversial because of his age and class - Naidu began publishing poetry to international acclaim, and in parallel with this literary art, she maintained her nationalist efforts, eventually becoming the first Indian woman to serve as president of the [[Indian National Congress]].&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Post 1960s Feminist Poetry ===

Anthologies were an important part of foregrounding women's writing in volumes like [[Eunice de Souza|Eunice De Souza]]'s ''Nine Indian Women Poets'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bethala|first=Melody|date=February 2017|title='The battle is to validate the material': A brief history of Eunice de Souza's anthologies of Indian literature.|url=https://humag.co/features/the-battle-is-to-validate-the-material|journal=Honest Ulsterman|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Feminist Legacy of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz'''

During the Latin American colonial period, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz (est 1651-1695) was a poet, dramatist, and nun.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/sor-juana-in%C3%A9s-de-la-cruz|title=Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz|last=Cruz|first=Sor Juana Inés de la|date=2003-02-04|website=Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz|language=en|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptionally talented and intelligent, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz chose to spend most of her life in the Convent of the Order of St. Jérôme, and her response to a critical Bishop, ''Respuesta a Sor Filotea,'' is hailed as one of the first feminist manifestos.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Not only did Sor Juana have to deal with the criticisms of men of her era, but she also faced the Spanish perception of literature from the colonies as second-rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/985840432|title=Routledge research companion to the works of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz|last=Schlau|first=edited by Emilie L. Bergmann and Stacey|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781317041641|location=London|pages=xi|oclc=985840432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sor Juana's poems challenge the assumptions of men about women, for example in [https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/you-foolish-men 'You Foolish Men.']

&lt;blockquote&gt;What kind of mind is odder

=== Post 1960s Feminist Poetry in Central America and the Caribbean ===

Anthologies of women's writing in the 1980s foregrounded the importance of women poets in the Caribbean, for example in M.J. Fenwick's ''Sisters of Caliban'' (1996) described as "a gendered and racialized position of resistance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lara|first=Irene|date=2007|title=Beyond Caliban's Curses:  The Decolonial Feminist Literacy of Sycorax|url=https://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1289&amp;context=jiws|journal=Journal of International Women's Studies|volume=9.1|pages=97|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist Poetry in North America ==

[[File:Joy harjo 3271646.JPG|thumb|Poet Joy Harjo's argument for the centrality and importance of native poetry in North America is significant for feminist literary histories.]]

=== Early Feminist Poets in North America ===

Though they lived in an era before an organised feminist movement, certain American poets have been lauded by [[feminist literary criticism]] as early examples of feminist writers. Feminist poetry in the United States is often thought of as beginning with [[Anne Bradstreet]] (1612-1672), the first poet of the [[New World]]. There were also, however, native poetic traditions before colonialism, which continue to the present day, and represent an important strand of American poetry. [[Native Americans in the United States|Native]] traditional verse has included "lyrics, chants, anecdotes, incantations, riddles, proverbs, and legends."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Preface to Colonial American Poetry: A Study in the Poetry of the Age in Relation to American History and Literature|last=Jabbar|first=Wisam Abdul|publisher=iUniverse|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is difficult to ascertain from these oral traditions whether the authors of early texts were male or female, precolonial native poetry certainly addresses issues relevant to women in a sensitive and positive way, for example the [[Seminole]] poem, 'Song for Bringing a Child Into the World.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/865473325|title=Native American songs and poems : an anthology|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Swann, Brian,|year=|isbn=9780486112138|location=Mineola, New York|pages=1|oclc=865473325}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, native poetry is a separate but relevant tradition in the United States; as poet [[Joy Harjo]] comments, "The literature of the aboriginal people of North America defines America. It is not exotic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/collections/144560/native-american-poetry-and-culture|title=Native American Poetry and Culture|last=|first=|date=|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of Canada, Anne Marie Dalton argues that at least some indigenous communities in North America (though not all) have lived by practicing [[ecofeminism]] with regard to women's roles, and the sustainability of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/671640200|title=The Cambridge history of Canadian literature|last=|first=|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Howells, Coral Ann., Kröller, Eva-Marie.|year=|isbn=9780511862243|location=Cambridge|pages=78–80|oclc=671640200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When colonialism did arrive, Anne Bradstreet was one of the first poets to win acclaim, and many of her poems are thought to have feminist themes.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The mother of eight children, Bradstreet sometimes found herself in conflict with her domestic circumstances and her role as a [[Puritans|Puritan]] woman.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/anne-bradstreet|title=Anne Bradstreet|last=Martin|first=Wendy|date=|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist literary criticism defined Bradstreet in retrospect as a "protofeminist," because of her "gender awareness," and her treatment of domestic concerns of importance in women's lives.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/785576747|title=Feminist writings from ancient times to the modern world : a global sourcebook and history|last=|first=|date=2011|publisher=Greenwood|others=Wayne, Tiffany K., 1968-|year=|isbn=9780313345814|location=Santa Barbara|pages=106|oclc=785576747}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poet [[Alicia Ostriker]] describes Bradstreet's style as "a combination of rebellion and submission," a pattern that Ostriker also sees in poets to come like [[Phillis Wheatley|Phyllis Wheatley]] and [[Emily Dickinson]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/podcasts/92110/a-change-of-world-episode-1-the-wilderness|title=A Change of World, Episode 1: The Wilderness|last=Fox|first=Curtis|date=2018|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phillis Wheatley|Phyllis Wheatley]] (1753-1784) was brought to the United States from Africa as a slave, and sold to the Wheatley family of Boston in 1771.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/phillis-wheatley|title=Phillis Wheatley|last=O'Neale|first=Sondra A.|date=|website=Poetry Foundation.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prodigy as a child, Wheatley was the first black person to publish a book of poems in the American colony, and though her poems are sometimes thought of as expressing "meek submission," she is also what [[Camille Dungy]] describes as "a foremother," and a role model for black women poets as "part of the fabric" of American poetry.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Involved in the abolitionist movement, Wheatley became "a spokeswoman for the cause of [[American independence]] and the [[Abolitionism|abolition of slavery]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/316827798|title=The right to write : the literary politics of Anne Bradstreet and Phillis Wheatley|last=Seidler.|first=Engberg, Kathrynn|date=2010|publisher=University Press of America|year=|isbn=9780761846093|location=Lanham, MD|pages=xvi|oclc=316827798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteenth century poet [[Emily Dickinson]] (1830-1886) is often thought of as feminist, though she never wrote for public audiences. Not necessarily recognized in her own lifetime, Dickinson offers powerful female speakers. Engaging with male writers like [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] or [[William Wordsworth]], her work is praised for developing "others ways of representing the position of a female speaking subject" in particular romantic and psychological dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22490475|title=Dickinson and the boundaries of feminist theory|last=1958-|first=Loeffelholz, Mary,|date=1991|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=|isbn=0252017897|location=Urbana|pages=22–25|oclc=22490475}}&lt;/ref&gt;  See for example the declaration of desire and longing in [https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44087/wild-nights-wild-nights-269 'Wild nights - Wild nights!.']&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the 1970s, [[feminist literary criticism]] articulated Dickinson's feminism through groundbreaking studies by [[Margaret Homans]], [[Sandra Gilbert]] and [[Susan Gubar]], and Suzanne Juhasz. Critics point in particular to Dickinson's expression of anger at women's confinement, to her re-gendering of external and internal realities, to her use of feminist motifs, and to her articulation of her particular position in Puritan, patriarchal culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/185033031|title=Approaching Emily Dickinson : critical currents and crosscurrents since 1960|last=1943-|first=White, Fred D.,|date=2008|publisher=Camden House|year=|isbn=9781571133168|location=Rochester, N.Y.|pages=65–70|oclc=185033031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dickinson also proves that confinement to domestic life does not dictate an inability to create great poetry.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; As the poet [[Adrienne Rich]] writes, "Probably no poet ever lived so much and so purposefully in one house; even, in one room."&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4195229|title=Shakespeare's sisters : feminist essays on women poets|last=|first=|date=1979|publisher=Indiana University Press|others=Gilbert, Sandra M., Gubar, Susan, 1944-|year=|isbn=0253112583|location=Bloomington|pages=99|oclc=4195229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post 1900s North American Feminist Poets===

[[File:Alice Dunbar Nelson cropped.jpg|thumb|Alice Moore Dunbar-Nelson]]
Feminist poets of the early twentieth century harnessed the new opportunities and rights which came as a result of coeducational resources now afforded to women.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/928779869|title=A history of twentieth-century American women's poetry|last=Kinnhan.|first=Linda|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cristianne Miller goes so far as to say that 'In no period before and rarely since have women poets had greater success and influence than in the first half of the twentieth century in the United States.'&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;

Living through the turn of the century was [[Alice Dunbar Nelson|Alice Moore Dunbar-Nelson]](1875-1935), a poet often thought of in relation to her marriage to [[Paul Laurence Dunbar|Paul Dunbar]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alice-moore-dunbar-nelson|title=Alice Moore Dunbar-Nelson|last=|first=|date=|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunbar-Nelson, however, is an accomplished writer in her own right, praised by poet [[Camille Dungy]] for breaking out of writing only about "black women's things," instead addressing "the theater and war of life."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Born in New Orleans, Dubar-Nelson's family had a heritage of African American, Anglo, Native American, and Creole roots.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; [[Camille Dungy]] suggests that bringing black women writers like Dunbar-Nelson into the feminist canon alongside Bradstreet and Dickinson is of great importance in rediscovering literary foremothers for black women writers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The early twentieth century was also a significant moment for feminism, because it saw the rise of the [[Women's suffrage|suffragist]] movement, and poets responded to the political moment by writing poems regarding the debate as to whether or not women should have the right to vote. In her collection ''Suffrage Songs and Verses,'' [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] criticises wealthy women, who because they live a life of ease, deny other women their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/gilman/suffrage/suffrage.html#anti|title=Suffrage Songs and Verses.|website=digital.library.upenn.edu|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alice Duer Miller]] (1874-1942) wrote poems mocking [[Anti-suffragism|anti-suffragist]] advocates, which were published in the [[New-York Tribune|New York Tribune]], a popular news outlet of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aliceduermiller.com|title=Alice Duer Miller|website=www.aliceduermiller.com|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2012/01/are-women-people-the-suffragist-poems-of-alice-duer-miller|title=Are Women People?

While some poets have been embraced by the feminist canon, others are seen as awkward additions in spite of their success, for example [[Gertrude Stein]] (1874-1946) is often defined more as a poet involved in modernist experimentation than feminist discourse.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/gertrude-stein|title=Gertrude Stein|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of modernism's tenets seem incompatible with some kinds of feminism, like the repression of emotion, and avoidance of domesticity.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Nevertheless, second wave feminists found modernist women poets like [[H.D.]] (1886-1961) to be a powerful example, unfairly overlooked by male critics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/h-d|title=H. D.|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the 1940s, magazines were being set up which, though perhaps not obviously feminist, certainly in their practices were very different to male-run publications: take for example [[Contemporary Verse 2|Contemporary Verse]] (1941–52) published in Canada by a group of women writers, including [[Dorothy Livesay]], [[P. K. Page|P.K. Page]], and [[Anne Marriott]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/969538355|title=The making of modern poetry in Canada : essential commentary on Canadian poetry in English|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Gnarowski, Michael, 1934-, Dudek, Louis, 1918-2001,|year=|isbn=9780773549609|edition= Third|location=Montreal|pages=xxix, xxv|oclc=969538355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post 1960 North American Feminist Poets===

[[File:Audre Lorde.jpg|thumb|Audre Lorde]]
Historian [[Ruth Rosen]] describes the mainstream poetry world before 1960 as "an all boy's club," adding that poetry was not "women's place," and explains that in order to get a poetry book published, writers would have to overcome their gender and race.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/podcasts/101723/books-that-broke-down-barriers|title="A Change of World, Episode 2: Books that Broke Down Barriers"|last=Fox|first=Curtis|date=|website=Poetry Foundation.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interest of American feminist poets in the rights of minorities have often put them in conflict with American institutions like the [[Academy of American Poets|American Academy of Poets]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One of the strategies of feminist poets is to demonstrate "their opposition to a dominant poetry culture that does not recognize the primacy of gender and other oppressions".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[1960s]] feminist poetry provided a useful space for [[Second-wave feminism|second wave]] American feminist politics.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/collections/146073/poetry-and-feminism|title=Poetry and Feminism|last=|first=|date=|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poets, however, were not necessarily unified in their themes or formal techniques, but had links to specific movements and trends, such as the New York Poets, the [[Black Mountain poets]], the [[San Francisco Renaissance]], or the [[Beat poets|Beat Poets]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Denise Levertov]] (1923-1997), for example, refined and built upon poetics from the [[Black Mountain poets|Black Mountain]] School.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levertov|first=Denise|date=1965|title=Some Notes on Organic Form|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/articles/69392/some-notes-on-organic-form-56d249032078f|journal=Poetry|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/denise-levertov|title=Denise Levertov|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women like [[Sylvia Plath]] (1932-1963) and [[Anne Sexton]] (1928-1974) provided a feminist version of the [[Confessional poetry|Confessional Poets]]' poetics, which worked alongside feminist texts of the day, like [[Betty Friedan]]'s ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', to "address taboo subjects and social limitations that plagued American women" (although Plath died before ''The Feminine Mystique'' was published)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2014/09/confessionalism-feminism-at-coldfront|title=Confessionalism and Feminism at Coldfront|last=Harriet|first=Staff|date=|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/anne-sexton|title=Anne Sexton|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/sylvia-plath|title=Sylvia Plath|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucille Clifton]] (1936-2010) also borrowed from [[Confessional poetry|Confessional]] poetics, a strategy that was key according to [[Adrienne Rich]] for avoiding being trapped between "misogynist black male critics and white feminists still struggling to unearth a white woman's tradition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://coldfrontmag.com/confessionalism-birthed-from-feminism-jd/|title=Confessionalism Birthed from Feminism|last=Wilson|first=Merida|date=|website=http://coldfrontmag.com/confessionalism-birthed-from-feminism-jd/|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/lucille-clifton|title=Lucille Clifton|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Confessional poetry|Confessionalism]] lent to feminist poetry the possibility of agency for the female speaker, and the refusal to present well-behaved women, though it was troubling that the Confessional women poets who committed suicide tended to be foregrounded and promoted in poetry circles.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

[[Muriel Rukeyser]] (1913-1980) was a generation older than Plath and Sexton, and rejected the suicidal poetics of the Confessional writers.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Rukeyser also wrote frankly about the body and sexuality, inspiring later poets like [[Sharon Olds]].&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/podcasts/144891/a-change-of-world-episode-4-a-place-of-permission|title=A Change of World, Episode 4 : A Place of Permission - Poetry Off the Shelf|date=2018-09-26|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Rukeyser's leftist politics and militant writing style proved to be a model for poet [[Adrienne Rich]].&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Both poets also contributed to the [[Anti-Vietnam War Movement|anti-Vietnam War movement]]: for example [[Muriel Rukeyser|Rukeyser]] and [[Adrienne Rich|Rich]] took part in readings as part of the event series, the Week of the Angry Arts Against the War in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Adrienne Rich]] (1929-2012) also became a key feminist poet, praised by [[Alicia Ostriker]] for bringing "intellect" to poetry, "something that women were not supposed to have," as well as "a leftward leaning sensibility in which coming out as lesbian was just one part."&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/adrienne-rich|title=Adrienne Rich|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rich's [https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/diving-wreck 'Diving into the Wreck'] is an important feminist poem, as it describes moving down as an act of triumph, where the wreck might be history, literature, or human life, and the poem itself is a kind of "battlecry."&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Famously, when Rich received the National Book Award for her collection, ''Diving into the Wreck,'' she accepted it on behalf of all the female nominees, including [[Audre Lorde]] and [[Alice Walker]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;We, Audre Lorde, Adrienne Rich, and Alice Walker, together accept this award in the name of all the women whose voices have gone and still go unheard in a patriarchal world, and in the name of those who, like us, have been tolerated as token women in this culture, often at great cost and in great pain. We believe that we can enrich ourselves more in supporting and giving to each other than by competing against each other; and that poetry— if it is poetry— exists in a realm beyond ranking and comparison. We symbolically join together here in refusing the terms of patriarchal competition and declaring that we will share this prize among us, to be used as best we can for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalbook.org/nbaacceptspeech_arich_74.html#.W5_7ri-ZN8c|title=National Book Awards Acceptance Speeches: ADRIENNE RICH, WINNER OF THE 1974 NATIONAL BOOK AWARD FOR DIVING INTO THE WRECK|last=Rich|first=Adrienne|date=1974|website=National Book Foundation.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Audre Lorde]] (1934-1992) was a feminist poet whose poetry and prose writings have had a great impact on feminist thinking to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2017/09/feminist-lesbian-warrior-poet-rediscovering-work-audre-lorde|title=Feminist, lesbian, warrior, poet: rediscovering the work of Audre Lorde|website=www.newstatesman.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://frieze.com/article/what-audre-lordes-language-self-care-can-teach-us-after-metoo|title=What Audre Lorde's Language of Self-Care Can Teach Us After #MeToo|website=frieze.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/audre-lorde|title=Audre Lorde|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes thought of as a writer who developed a "black lesbian eroticism," Lorde's poetry also shows a deep ethical and moral commitment, which seeks to challenge racism, sexism, and homophobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53315369|title=Warrior poet : a biography of Audre Lorde|last=1948-|first=De Veaux, Alexis,|date=2004|publisher=W.W.

=== Feminist Anthologies in North America in the 1970s and 80s ===

In the 1970s and 80s, feminist poetry evolved alongside the feminist movement, becoming a useful tool for activist groups organised around [[radical feminism]], [[socialist feminism]], and [[lesbian feminism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Poetry readings became spaces for feminists to come together in cities and in rural communities, and talk about sexuality, women's roles, and the possibilities beyond heteronormative life.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Figures like [[Judy Grahn]] were figureheads for the women's movement, providing electrifying readings that enlivened and inspired audiences.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Often the poems were political, and sometimes the writers tried to use language that "ordinary women" could read and understand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Countering tokenism was also an important aspect of the feminist poetry project.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/podcasts/143653/shattering-the-blue-velvet-chair|title=A Change of World, Episode 3: Shattering the Blue Velvet Chair - Poetry Off the Shelf|date=2018-09-26|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carolyn Forché]] describes the "blue velvet chair" effect, inspired by group portraits of canonical poets, in which one - but only one - woman writer was allowed to join the men, often sat in a Victorian blue velvet chair.&lt;ref name=":17"/&gt;

As poetry took on a new significance for the feminist movement, so a number of new poetry anthologies were published which emphasised women's voices and experiences.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/907585915|title=The Oxford handbook of Canadian literature|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Sugars, Cynthia Conchita, 1963-|year=|isbn=9780199941865|location=New York, NY|pages=853|oclc=907585915}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anthologies played an important role generally in opening up the political consciousness of poetry, an important example being [[Raymond Souster]]'s volume, ''New Wave Canada: The Explosion in Canadian Poetry'' (1966).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;[[Louis Dudek]] and Michael Gnarowski describe the anthology's embracing of counterculture, including new ideas about sexuality and the role of women.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Other anthologies began to focus specifically on women's writing, such as:

Other anthologies created new canons of women's writing from the past, such as ''Black sister: poetry by black American women, 1746-1980'' (1981) edited by Erlene Stetson; or ''Writing Red: An Anthology of American Women Writers, 1930-1940'' (1987) edited by Paula Rabinowitz and Charlotte Nekola. Such anthologies "established solid ground for the communication and circulation of feminist ideas" in the American and Canadian Academies.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Conferences also provided important spaces for feminists to share and discuss ideas about the possibilities of poetry: for example a key moment for Canadian feminist poetry was the "Women and words / Les femmes et les motes" conference in 1983.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beverley|first=Andrea|date=2017|title='Women and Words'|url=https://champlainsociety.utpjournals.press/findings-trouvailles/2017/11/women-and-words-1983-visual-traces|journal=The Champlain Society - Findings|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The Vancouver convention brought together women writers, publishers, and booksellers to discuss the issues of the Canadian literary world, including gender inequity.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Modern Feminist Poetry in North America ===
One change in the writing of women poets after the 1960s and 1970s was the possibility of writing about women's lives and experiences.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; To give authority to women's voices, writers like [[Honor Moore]] and [[Judy Grahn|Judy Graun]] held workshops specifically for women in order to overcome women's inner critics exacerbated by sexism.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; These networks of mentorship sprang up in feminist communities, and in universities.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

The work at this time was focussing on "images of women," and this often meant broadening representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Juhasz|first=Suzanne|date=1977|title=The critic as feminist: Reflections on women's poetry, feminism, and the art of criticism|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F00497878.1977.9978438|journal=Women's Studies|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=113–127|doi=10.1080/00497878.1977.9978438|issn=0049-7878|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This methodology eventually began to be criticised, however, because it failed to recognise the complications of violence embedded in the very structure of language.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sojka|first=Eugenia|date=2001|title=Canadian Feminist Writing and American Poetry|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1128&amp;context=clcweb|journal=CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture|volume=3.2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers influenced by the [[avant-garde]] and by [[Language poets|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry]] sought to challenge the idea of language's neutrality.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; US feminist language poets like [[Lyn Hejinian|Lynn Hejinian]] or [[Susan Howe]], or Canadian writers like [[Daphne Marlatt]] looked back to the legacy of experimentalist modernists like [[Gertrude Stein]], or [[Mina Loy]], and also to diverse sources of inspiration like [[Denise Levertov]], [[Marguerite Duras]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Nicole Brossard]], [[Phyllis Webb]], [[Louky Bersianik]], and [[Julia Kristeva]].&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  They also reframed the language poetics from male mentors like [[Charles Olson]], [[Robert Creeley]], [[Gary Snyder]], or [[Allen Ginsberg]].&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

Poets also sought to intervene in spheres traditionally dominated by men. Take for example [[Eileen Myles]]' intervention into politics in her 1992 "Write-in Campaign for President."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eileenmyles.net/howto.htm|title=1992 Write-in Campaign for President:  Eileen Myles|website=www.eileenmyles.net|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

By the time of the 1990s, and the rise of [[intersectionality]] as a key feminist term, many feminist poets resisted the term "woman poet," because it suggested "too confining a collective identity."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They also sought to undermine "the assumption that has sometimes structured feminist political organizing and even feminist literary publishing and criticism—that gender can be separated from race, ethnicity, class, and sexuality, and that white middleclass women first and foremost have the tools and the knowhow for the enterprise of analyzing gendered experience and literary production."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Present day feminist poetry in North America holds space for a great variety of poets tackling identity, sexuality, and gender issues. Key writings in the recent past include [[Claudia Rankine]]'s careful skewering of race related [[microaggression]]s in ''Citizen,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2015/04/23/claudia-rankine-new-way-writing-about-race/|title='A New Way of Writing About Race'|last=Laird|first=Nick|work=The New York Review of Books|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dorothea Laskey's "ferocious confession" in Rome for example,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://feministing.com/2014/07/31/feministing-readz-dorothea-laskys-rome/|title=Feministing Readz: Dorothea Lasky's Rome|work=Feministing|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bhanu Kapil's challenge the violent inherent in structures of language and institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/laying-down-banlieue|title=L(a)ying Down in the Banlieue {{!}} Mute|website=www.metamute.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminist Writing after Mary Wollstonecraft ===

Eighteenth century advocate for women's rights [[Mary Wollstonecraft|Mary Wollstonecraf]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t (1797-1851), put great emphasis on the power of the poetic imagination as a liberator tool, and many nineteenth century British women writers were inspired by Wollstonecraft to use poetry to enter public debates about gender roles, poverty, and slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wollstonecraft|first=Mary|date=1797|title="On Poetry and Our Relish for the Beauties of Nature"|url=|journal=Monthly Magazine|volume=April|pages=279–82|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/mary-wollstonecraft-shelley|title=Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The verse-novel ''[[Aurora Leigh]]'' (1856) by [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]] (1806-1861) is one such feminist work, which challenged a prevailing attitude that women's lives were incompatible with writing poetry.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/elizabeth-barrett-browning|title=Elizabeth Barrett Browning|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aurora Leigh'' had a very public impact, for example influencing the views of American social reformer [[Susan B. Anthony]] regarding the traditional roles of women, especially in relation to the tension between marriage and women's individuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Susan B. Anthony Rebel, Crusader, Humanitarian.|last=Lutz|first=Alma|publisher=Beacon Press|year=1959|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Late Nineteenth Century Feminist Poets in Britain ===

Often cited as an early feminist poet, [[Amy Levy]] (1861-1889) is described by writer [[Elaine Feinstein]] as the first modern Jewish woman poet.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Amy Levy : critical essays|last=Valman|first=Nadia|publisher=Ohio University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780821443071|location=Athens|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/jewess-in-nineteenthcentury-british-literary-culture/A059306B33CC165DA9E8AC54E5816E4C|title=The Jewess in Nineteenth-Century British Literary Culture|last=Valman|first=Nadia|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780511484964|location=Cambridge|pages=119|language=en|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511484964}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/amy-levy|title=Amy Levy|last=Levy|first=Amy|date=2013-09-30|website=Amy Levy|language=en|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the age of 13, Levy published her first poem in the feminist journal, the ''Pelican'', and she grew to maturity surrounded by writers and social reformers on the London scene of the era, such as [[Eleanor Marx]] and [[Olive Schreiner|Olive Schreiber]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Though nothing is known for sure about Levy's sexual relationships, she is often thought of as a lesbian poet, though some critics have challenged affixing a sexual category to Levy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women’s Poetry, Late Romantic to Late Victorian: Gender and Genre, 1830–1900|last=Blain|first=Virginia|publisher=Macmillan|year=1999|isbn=|location=London|pages=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levy's poems, however, are an early example of poetry that challenges [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.senatehouselibrary.ac.uk/blog/amy-levy-1861-1889-'minor-poet'|title=Amy Levy (1861-1889): a ‘Minor Poet’|last=|first=|date=|website=Senate House Library, University of London|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/953030317|title=Odd women? : spinsters, lesbians and widows in British women's fiction, 1850s-1930s|last=Emma,|first=Liggins,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781526111654|location=Manchester|pages=4|oclc=953030317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Twentieth Century Feminist Poets in Britain ===

Levy is often thought of as prefiguring or representing an early version of the New Woman, a stereotypical image of an independent woman who often worked rather than relying on her menfolk, and was associated with [[Gender bender|gender bending]] and deviance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Dolores|date=1991|title=The "New Woman" as Prometheus: Women Artists Depict Women Smoking|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1358183|journal=Woman's Art Journal|volume=12|issue=1|pages=3–9|doi=10.2307/1358183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/20661/|title=Amy Levy: her life, her poetry and the era of the new woman|last=Christine|first=Pullen,|date=2000|website=eprints.kingston.ac.uk|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century was an era of surplus women, who had to work to survive: by 1911, 77 per cent of women workers in the UK were single.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Long|first=V.|last2=Marland|first2=H.|date=2009-01-01|title=From Danger and Motherhood to Health and Beauty: Health Advice for the Factory Girl in Early Twentieth-Century Britain|url=https://academic.oup.com/tcbh/article/20/4/454/1690021|journal=Twentieth Century British History|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=454–481|doi=10.1093/tcbh/hwp027|issn=0955-2359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the struggle of [[suffragette]]s campaigning for votes for women, many British feminist poets sought to emulate the example of Victorian women writers, often expressing their radical political beliefs through poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://britlitsurvey2.wordpress.com/2013/11/08/mary-wollstonecraft-influence-beyond-the-grave/|title=Mary Wollstonecraft: Influence Beyond the Grave|last=|first=|date=|website=British Literature 1700-1900, A Course Blog|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the writers were not professional poets, but wrote out of necessity, including satirical portraits of politicians, or writings from prison, as in ''Holloway Jingles'', a collection of writing from imprisoned women collated by the Glasgow Branch of the [[Women's Social and Political Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/54206569|title=Literature of the women's suffrage campaign in England|last=|first=|date=2004|publisher=Broadview Press|others=Nelson, Carolyn Christensen.|year=|isbn=1551115115|location=Peterborough, Ont.|pages=153|oclc=54206569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== British Feminist Poets and Modernism ===

In the inter-war years, British women poets associated with modernism began to find themselves public figures, though their feminist ideas sometimes came into conflict with the literary establishment which remained a kind of "exclusive male club."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women, Modernism and British Poetry, 1910–1939: Resisting Femininity|last=Dowson|first=Jane|publisher=Ash gate|year=2002|isbn=9780754604631|location=Burlington, VT|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often these writers are difficult to categorize in relation to literary groups traditionally used, like the [[avant-garde]] or [[Modernism|modernists]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This was also a period when American women poets living in Britain made an important contribution to the writing of the day: writers like [[H.D.]], [[Mina Loy]], and [[Amy Lowell]] all combined radical poetic content with experimentation of form, allowing them to explore feminist polemic and non-heteronormative sexualities in innovative new modes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other British feminist poets of the time like [[Anna Wickham]], [[Charlotte Mew]], and [[Sylvia Townsend Warner]], receive less critical attention, but also sought to challenge and reevaluate tropes of femininity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Post 1960s Feminist Poetry in Britain ===

During the 1960s, the Women's Liberation Movement in the UK had a great influence on the literary world.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/sisterhood/articles/feminist-literature|title=Feminist literature|last=Sisterhood and After Research Team|first=|date=|website=The British Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist publishers, [[Virago Press|Virago]] (founded in 1973), [[Onlywomen Press|Onlywomen]] (1974), The Women's Press (1978), and Sheba (1980), were established, alongside magazines like [https://www.bl.uk/spare-rib Spare Rib].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Like their counterparts in the US, British feminist editors in the 1970s and 80s created landmark anthologies of women's poetry, which foregrounded the variety and strength of women's writing.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; These included Lilian Mohin's ''One Foot on the Mountain'' (1979), [[Jeni Couzyn]]'s ''The Bloodaxe Book of Contemporary Women Poets'' (1985), Moira Ferguson's ''First Feminists: British Women Writers 1578-1799'' (1985), Kate Armstrong's ''Fresh Oceans'' (1989), Jude Brigley's ''Exchanges'' (1990), and Catherine Kerrigan's ''An Anthology of Scottish Women Poets'' (1991).

'''Fugitive Projects''' is a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] curatorial arts organization, arts collective, and beehive operating since 1999 out of [[Nashville, Tennessee]].

From 1999- 2005 Fugitive Projects called itself the '''Fugitive Art Center''' bringing national and international artists to Nashville to exhibit in their warehouse gallery space.  In both configurations they served as an artist advocacy, curatorial resource and databank. Since restructuring they have focused more on ephemeral exhibitions and involvement with exhibitions traveling to the [[IMAFY]] in [[Egypt]]; [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]], [[Canada]] for [[The Interactive Screen Conference]]; [[Ireland]]'s [[Dublin Electronic Arts Festival]]; [[Basel, Switzerland]] and to venues across the U.S.  Artists with video works in this touring program included [[Hernan Bas]], [[Charles De Meaux]], [[e*rock]], [[Haus am Gern]], [[Jenna Gribbon]], [[Muda Matthis / Sus Zwick]], [[Casey Reas]], [[Scott Reeder (artist)|Scott Reeder]], [[Magda Tothova]], [[Moliu Zhang]], [[Eliane Rutishauser]], [[Melody Owen]], [[Charles Huntley Nelson]], [[Kristin Lucas]], Matt Freedman, [[Bert Rodriguez]], [[Dominic DeJoseph]], [[Nicolas Lobo]], [[Karina Nimmerfall]], [[Jeff Luckey]], and [[Joseph Burwell]] among others.

David Maddox in the ''[[Nashville Scene]]'' said in 2004 "the Fugitive (Art Center) has become an essential part of Nashville's art scene...The Fugitive can point to a steady series of good shows, but that's only part of the group's significance to Nashville. Its 12-person board provides a cross-section of the city's art scene."

Susan Knowles, in [[Art Papers]], refers to The Fugitive Art Center as "unbridled energy",  "a lightning rod for artists" and "the edge of visual dialogue in Nashville- and Tennessee."

'''''Greetingman''''' ({{lang-ko|그리팅맨}}) is a modern sculpture project in South Korea.

Its main artist is [[Yoo Young-ho]] (South Korean sculptor). The concept provides a man, 6 m high, [[bowing]] in a typically Asian greeting gesture. The blue color means lack of prejudice.

In October 2012, a statue was unveiled in the neighbourhood of [[Buceo]], [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/121020/pespec-670696/espectaculos/Escultura-coreana-en-rambla-de-Buceo/ |title=Korean sculpture on the Montevidean seashore|date=2012-10-20|publisher=EL PAIS}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a planned world series in multiple locations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greetingman.com/future.html Future of Greetingman]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_entertainment/486476.html One thousand greetings]''The Hankyoreh''. 8 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Another statue was unveiled in October 2013 in [[South Korea]], near the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]], in Haean, [[Yanggu County, Gangwon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/608543.html |title=Greeting Man statue coming to Korean War battleground |publisher=The Hankyoreh |date=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third statue was unveiled in January 2016 in [[Panama City, Panama]], the second to be unveiled in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laestrella.com.pa/estilo/cultura/develan-escultura-degreetingman-costa-este/23917137/foto/205961 |title=Develan escultura de "Greetingman" en la ciudad de Panamá |publisher=La Estrella de Panamá |date=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hinman collator''', an early [[optical collator]], was an [[opto-mechanical]] device for comparing pairs of documents for differences in the text. Documents that appeared similar were said to “collate”. The collator resulted in rapid advances in the study of [[Literature|literary]] works.

Invented by [[Charlton Hinman]] in the late 1940s, the device used [[light bulb|lights]] and [[mirror]]s to superimpose images of the two documents so that differences in text alignment or wording stood out. This resulted in huge improvements in speed and efficiency compared to the traditional [[Cross-reference|cross-referencing]] of texts by eye.

The idea built on earlier work such as [[Carl Pulfrich|Carl Pulfrich's]] [[blink comparator]] used to help identify the former planet [[Pluto]], and Hinman's work analysing aerial photographs during [[World War II]].

Hinman used his device to compare the many slightly different impressions of the [[First Folio]] of [[William Shakespeare]]'s works. The [[printing]] and [[bookbinding]] processes used in the time of Shakespeare often resulted in variations in the pages bound into the final books, and the collator enabled Hinman to describe the exact order in which the Folios had been composited and printed. He used the collator to compare 55 different copies of the First Folio held by the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]], and subsequently wrote about his findings in ''Printing and Proof-reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare'' in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collation.folger.edu/2011/08/welcome-to-the-collation/ |title=Welcome to The Collation |last1=Werner |first1=Sarah |date=August 18, 2011 |website=The Collation |publisher=[[Folger Shakespeare Library]] |access-date=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of Hinman's success, the device was purchased by a number of universities, libraries and other institutions (allegedly including the [[CIA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In his 2002 survey of mechanical collators, Steven Escar Smith estimates from scattered records that as many as 59 Hinman Collators were produced, 41 of these surviving at the time of his survey's publication. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

{{nihongo|'''Hiromi Itō'''|伊藤 比呂美|Itō Hiromi|born September 13, 1955}} is one of the most prominent [[women's writing (literary category)|woman writers]] of contemporary Japan, with more than a dozen collections of [[Japanese poetry|poetry]], several works of [[prose]], numerous books of essays, and several major literary prizes to her name. She divides her time between the towns of [[Encinitas]], California and [[Kumamoto]] in southern Japan.

==Biography ==

===Early career ===
Born in 1955 in Tokyo, Itō became well known in the 1980s for a series of dramatic collections of poetry that described [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], pregnancy, and feminine erotic desire in dramatically direct language.  From her earliest work, Itō embarked on a lifelong battle against the stylized and artful language common in 20th-century [[Japanese poetry]].  Much of her poetry is narrated in extended passages of relatively [[colloquial]] text.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeffrey Angles]], Translator's Introduction, ''Killing Kanoko: Selected Poems of Hiromi Itō'' (Notre Dame, IN: Action Books, 2009), p. vii–xii.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her poems so skillfully represent spoken language that they often give the illusion of being records of spoken speech.  Not coincidentally, commentators have often described Itō as a "[[shaman]]ess" for her ability to channel voices onto the page.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance, Kido Shuri's comments in ''Sengo meishi sen II,'' (Tokyo: Shichōsha, 2001), p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's issues===
In 1982, Itō's book {{nihongo|''Unripe Plums''|青梅|Aoume}},'appeared in the series "The Present State of Women's Poetry," which was published by the Japanese publisher [[Shichōsha]] and also featured a number of rising young female poets, including [[Toshiko Hirata]], [[Yōko Isaka]], and [[Kōko Shiraishi]].  In the mid-1980s, Itō's writing gravitated to issues of the feminine body, sexuality, and motherhood, making her the most prominent voice of what came to be known as the "women's poetry boom." The two collections {{nihongo|''On Territory 2''|テリトリー論1|Teritorī ron 2}}, published in 1985, and {{nihongo|''On Territory 1''|テリトリー論2|Teritorī ron 1}}, published in 1987, describe her feelings after giving birth to her first daughter, [[Kanoko Nishi]].  These poems probe the meaning of the mother-child relationship and the demands that [[motherhood]] places on the mother's identity and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeffrey Angles]], Translator's Introduction, ''Killing Kanoko: Selected Poems of Hiromi Itō'' (Notre Dame, IN: Action Books, 2009), p. vii–xii.&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, in the often anthologized poem {{nihongo|"Killing Kanoko"|カノコ殺し|Kanoko-goroshi}}, she describes the feelings of a young mother experiencing [[postpartum depression]] and anger at her newborn, even though the world is congratulating her on becoming a mother.&lt;ref&gt;Translated in Hiromi Itō, ''Killing Kanoko: Selected Poetry of Hiromi Itō'' (Notre Dame, IN: Action Books, 2009), pp. 33–39.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her eagerness to explore women's issues has led some to think of her as a [[feminist]] writer, although this is a term that Itō has not always embraced in building her public persona.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Quimby, 'How to Write "Women's Poetry" without Being a "Woman Poet": Public Persona in Itō Hiromi's Early Poetry,' ''U.S.-Japan Women's Journal,'' vol. 32 (2007): 7–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout her career, however, Itō has embraced the metaphor of the poet as a [[shaman]]ess.  In 1991, she collaborated with the prominent feminist scholar [[Chizuko Ueno]] from [[Tokyo University]] on a collection of essays and poetry called {{nihongo|''The Shamaness and Her Interpreter''|のろとさにわと|Noro to saniwa to}}, which the two likened to the collaboration between an [[Okinawa]]n shamaness and the figure who makes sense of her utterances for the outside world.  A few years later in 1993, Itō explicitly played out the metaphor of poet as shamaness in her long narrative poem {{nihongo|'I Am Anjuhimeko'|わたしはあんじゅひめ子である|Watashi wa Anjuhimeko de aru}}, in which she takes a story recorded from a shamaness in [[Tsugaru Peninsula|Tsugaru]] in the early 20th century and refashions it into a dramatic new myth of [[healing]] from [[sexual abuse]] and self-discovery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeffrey Angles]], "Reclaiming the Unwritten: The Work of Memory in Itō Hiromi's ''Watashi wa Anjuhimeko de aru (I Am Anjuhimeko),''" ''U.S.-Japan Women's Journal,'' vol. 32 (2007): 51–75.  For a translation, see Hiromi Itō, ''Killing Kanoko: Selected Poetry of Hiromi Itō,'' (Notre Dame, IN: 2009), pp. 99–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relocation to the US===
Since at least the 1980s, Itō had been fascinated with Native American poetry, which she first read in Japanese translations.  In 1990, she met the American poet [[Jerome Rothenberg]] when he visited Japan.  Rothenberg had been a major force in re-examining Native American poetry in the movement known as "[[ethnopoetics]]," and he encouraged Itō to come to America.  She had recently separated from her husband, the literature scholar [[Masahiko Nishi]], and at Rothenberg's invitation, she started making regular, extended trips to America with her children, before eventually settling in 1997 in [[Encinitas]], California with her new partner, the British artist [[Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen]].

The change of setting led to several significant changes in her writing, in terms of both [[genre]] and subject matter.  She began writing novellas, both because she was tired of poetry and because she felt [[prose]] was better suited to exploring her new experiences as an immigrant.  Several of her novellas from this time describe the difficulties of immigration and the experience of being a transplant in a new environment.&lt;ref&gt;Kyōko Ōmori, "'Finding Our Own English:' Migrancy, Identity, and Language(s) in Itō Hiromi's Recent Prose," ''U.S.-Japan Women's Journal,'' vol. 32 (2007): 92–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 2000===
Itō returned to poetry, publishing several long, [[fantasy|fantastic]] narrative works that blur the lines between prose and poetry.  These include {{nihongo|''Wild Grass on a Riverbank''|河原荒草|Kawara arekusa}}, published in 2005, the narrative {{nihongo|''Coyote Song''|コヨーテ・ソング|Koyōte songu}}, published in 2007, and {{nihongo|''The Thorn-Puller: New Tales of the Sugamo Jizō''|とげ抜き 新巣鴨地蔵縁起|Toge-nuki: Shin Sugamo Jizō engi}}, published in 2007.  In these works, Itō writes about the experiences of modern people, often [[immigrant|migrants]] or [[International|transnational]]s, but does so in a way that has an almost [[mythology|mythological]] grandeur and frequently veers into the [[surrealism|surreal]].

One of Itō's bestsellers was her book of essays {{nihongo|''The Heart Sutra Explained''|読み解き般若心経|Yomitoki Hannnya shingyō}}, published in 2010.  This book consists of a series of personal essays about her involvement with the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] classic, the [[Heart Sutra]], and other [[Buddhist texts]].  While relating the texts to her own life, she describes her understanding of the text and provides her own modern Japanese translation from the [[classical Chinese]].  Itō's interest in [[Buddhism]] and [[Buddhist texts]] in particular had been visible earlier in her career, for instance, in the 1993 poem {{nihongo|'I Am Anjuhimeko'|わたしはあんじゅひめ子である|Watashi wa Anjuhimeko de aru}}, which incorporates elements of folk Buddhist narrative, and the 2004 book {{nihongo|''Strange Tales from Japan''|日本ノ霊異ナ話|Nihon no fushigi na hanashi}}, which retells several of the stories in the [[Heian period|Heian-period]] Buddhist classic [[Nihon Ryōiki]] by the [[Buddhist monk|monk]] [[Kyōkai]]. In 2012, Itō published {{nihongo|''Reading the ''Lamentations of Divergences'' Falteringly Out Loud''|たどたどしく声に出して読む歎異抄|Tadotadoshiku koe ni dashite yomu tannishō}}, a book of personal essays and contemporary Japanese translations of [[Letter (message)|correspondence]] between the Japanese Buddhist monk [[Shinran]] and his mother.

A common theme in these books, especially ''The Heart Sutra Explained'', ''Reading the ''Lamentations of Divergences'' Falteringly Out Loud'', and the 2014 book {{nihongo|''A Father's Life''|父の生きる|Chichi no ikiru}} about the slow decline and death of Itō's father, is the question of how life changes as one grows older and faces death. (This is a major issue in Japan due to the [[demographics|demographic]] imbalances brought about Japan's [[Japan demographics|declining birth rate and rise in numbers of senior citizens]]). As a means to understand and cope with this process, Itō frequently turns to [[Buddhist texts]] for inspiration.

In addition to these works of poetry and prose, Itō has published numerous books of essays, [[manga]] criticism, and translations of [[American literature]] for young Japanese readers.  Among the books she has translated into Japanese are ''[[The Cat in the Hat]]'' and ''[[Oh, the Places You'll Go!]]'' by [[Dr. Seuss]], as well as the two books ''[[Out of the Dust]]'' and ''[[Witness (Karen Hesse novel)|Witness]]'' by [[Karen Hesse]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeffrey Angles]], "Dr. Seuss Goes to Japan: Ideology and the Translation of an American Icon," ''Japan Forum'' 26.2 (May 2014): 177-183.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to her modern Japanese translations of the [[Buddhist texts]] mentioned above, she has also written a modern Japanese translation of a short story by [[Ichiyō Higuchi]].

Itō divides her time between her home in [[Encinitas]], [[California]] and [[Kumamoto]] in southern Japan.  In the latter, she has been the organizing force between a group of local writers and artists known as the {{nihongo|"Kumamoto Band"|熊本文学隊|Kumamoto bungakutai}}.  Itō's work is featured prominently in the [[Kumamoto Modern Literature Museum]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24924">{{short description|doubts and debate about the identity of Homer and the authorship of the Iliad and Odyssey}}
&lt;!--this article has used the BC/AD convention since its inception, 15 December 2005--&gt;
[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 061.jpg|thumb|[[Rembrandt]]'s ''Homer'' (1663)]]

The '''Homeric Question''' concerns the doubts and consequent debate over the identity of [[Homer]], the authorship of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'', and their [[Historicity of the Iliad|historicity (especially concerning the ''Iliad'')]]. The subject has its roots in [[classical antiquity]] and the [[scholarship]] of the [[Hellenistic period]], but has flourished among [[Homeric scholarship|Homeric scholars]] of the 19th and 20th centuries.

The main subtopics of the Homeric Question are:

*"Who is Homer?"&lt;ref&gt;Kahane, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Are the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' of multiple or single authorship?"&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, p. 10. This question has attracted luminaries from all walks of life, including [[William Ewart Gladstone]], who amused himself in spare time by inditing a tome in dilation of the view that Homer was one man, solely and individually responsible for both the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"By whom, when, where, and under what circumstances were the poems composed?"&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

To these questions the possibilities of modern [[textual criticism]] and archaeological answers have added a few more:

*"How reliable is the tradition embodied in the Homeric poems?"&lt;ref&gt;Luce, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"How old are the oldest elements in Homeric poetry which can be dated with certainty?"&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oral tradition==
{{Trojan War}}
Following the seminal work of [[Milman Parry]], most classicists agree that, whether or not there was ever such a composer as Homer, the poems attributed to him are to some degree dependent on oral tradition, a generations-old technique that was the collective inheritance of many singer-poets (or {{lang|grc|[[Aoidos|ἀῳδοί]]}}, ''aōidoi''). An analysis of the structure and vocabulary of the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' shows that the poems contain many regular and repeated phrases; indeed, even entire verses are repeated. Thus according to the theory, the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' may have been products of [[oral-formulaic composition]], composed on the spot by the poet using a collection of memorized traditional verses and phases. [[Milman Parry]] and [[Albert Lord]] have pointed out that such elaborate oral tradition, foreign to today's literate cultures, is typical of [[epic poetry]] in an exclusively [[orality|oral culture]]. The crucial words here are "oral" and "traditional". Parry starts with the former: the repetitive chunks of language, he says, were inherited by the singer-poet from his predecessors, and were useful to him in composition. Parry calls these chunks of repetitive language "formulas".&lt;ref&gt;Gibson: ''Milman Parry''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars agree that the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' underwent a process of standardization and refinement out of older material, beginning in the 8th century BC.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; This process, often referred to as the "million little pieces" design, seems to acknowledge the spirit of oral tradition. As [[Albert Lord]] notes in his book ''[[The Singer of Tales]]'', poets within an oral tradition, as was Homer, tend to create and modify their tales as they perform them. Although this suggests that Homer may simply have "borrowed" from other bards, he almost certainly made the piece his own when he performed it.&lt;ref&gt;Lord: ''The Singer of Tales''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960 publication of Lord's book, which focused on the problems and questions that arise in conjunction with applying oral-formulaic theory to problematic texts such as the ''Iliad'', the ''Odyssey'' and even ''[[Beowulf]]'' influenced nearly all subsequent work on Homer and oral-formulaic composition. In response to his landmark effort, [[Geoffrey Kirk]] published a book entitled ''The Songs of Homer'', in which he questions Lord's extension of the oral-formulaic nature of [[Serbian epic poetry]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (the area from which the theory was first developed) to Homeric epic. He holds that Homeric poems differ from those traditions in their "metrical strictness", "formular system[s]" and [[creativity]]. Kirk argued that Homeric poems were recited under a system that gave the reciter much more freedom to choose words and passages to achieve the same end than the Serbian poet, who was merely "reproductive".&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, pp. 88-91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foley, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterwards, [[Eric A. Havelock]]'s 1963 book ''Preface to Plato'' revolutionized how scholars looked at Homeric epic by arguing not only that it was the product of an oral tradition but that the oral-formulas contained therein served as a way for ancient Greeks to preserve cultural knowledge across many different generations.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1966 work ''Have we Homer's ''Iliad''?'', Adam Parry theorized the existence of the most fully developed oral poet up to his time, a person who could (at his discretion) creatively and intellectually form nuanced characters in the context of the accepted, traditional story; in fact, Parry altogether discounted the Serbian tradition to an "unfortunate" extent, choosing to elevate the Greek model of oral-tradition above all others.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, pp. 36, 505.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parry, pp. 177-216.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord reacted to Kirk and Parry's respective contentions with ''Homer as Oral Poet'', published in 1968, which reaffirmed his belief in the relevance of Serbian epic poetry and its similarities to Homer, and downplayed the intellectual and literary role of the reciters of Homeric epic.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, pp. 40, 406.&lt;/ref&gt;

In further support of the theory that Homer is really the name of a series of oral-formulas, or equivalent to "the Bard" as applied to Shakespeare, the Greek name ''Homēros'' is etymologically noteworthy. It is identical to the Greek word for "hostage". It has been hypothesized that his name was back-extracted from the name of a society of poets called the [[Homeridae]], which literally means "sons of hostages", i.e., descendants of [[prisoners of war]]. As these men were not sent to war because their loyalty on the battlefield was suspect, they would not be killed in conflicts, so they were entrusted with remembering the area's stock of epic poetry, to remember past events, from the time before literacy came to the area.&lt;ref&gt;Harris: ''Homer the Hostage''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, the word "Homer" may simply be a carryover from the Mediterranean seafarers' vocabulary adoption of the Semitic word base ’MR, which means "say" or "tell". "Homer" may simply be the Mediterranean version of "saga". It has also been suggested by [[Pseudo-Plutarch]] that the name comes from a word meaning "to follow" and another meaning "blind". Other sources connect Homer's name with [[Smyrna]] for several etymological reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Graziosi, pp. 79–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time frame==
Exactly when these poems would have taken on a fixed written form is subject to debate. The traditional solution is the "transcription hypothesis", wherein a non-literate singer dictates the poem to a literate scribe in the 6th century BC or earlier. Sources from antiquity are unanimous in declaring that [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratus]], the tyrant of [[Athens]], first committed the poems of Homer to writing and placed them in the order in which we now read them.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Homer |volume=13 |first1=David Binning |last1=Monro |first2=Thomas William |last2=Allen |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; More radical Homerists, such as [[Gregory Nagy]], contend that a canonical text of the Homeric poems did not exist until established by [[Alexandria]]n editors in the Hellenistic period (3rd to 1st century BC).

The modern debate began with the ''Prolegomena'' of [[Friedrich August Wolf]] (1795). According to Wolf, the date of writing is among the first questions in the [[textual criticism]] of Homer. Having satisfied himself that writing was unknown to Homer, Wolf considers the real mode of transmission, which he purports to find in the [[Rhapsodists]], of whom the Homeridae were an hereditary school. Wolf reached the conclusion that the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' could not have been composed in the form in which we know them without the aid of writing. They must therefore have been, as Bentley has said, a sequel of songs and rhapsodies, loose songs not collected together in the form of an epic poem until about 500 years after their original composition. This conclusion Wolf supports by the character attributed to the Cyclic poems (whose want of unity showed that the structure of the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' must be the work of a later time), by one or two indications of imperfect connection, and by the doubts of ancient critics as to the authenticity of certain parts.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

This view is extended by the complicating factor of the period of time now referred to as the "[[Greek Dark Ages]]". This period, which ranged from approximately 1250 to 750 BC, is estimated to have been immediately preceded by the historical counterpart to Homer's [[Trojan War]]. The composition of the ''Iliad'', on the other hand, is placed immediately following the Greek Dark Age period.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Further controversy surrounds the difference in composition dates between the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey''. It seems that the latter was composed at a later date than the former because the works' differing characterizations of the Phoenicians align with differing Greek popular opinion of the Phoenicians between the 8th and 7th centuries BC, when their skills began to hurt Greek commerce. Whereas Homer's description of [[Achilles]]'s shield in the ''Iliad'' exhibits minutely detailed metalwork that characterized Phoenician crafts, they are characterized in the ''Odyssey'' as "manifold scurvy tricksters".&lt;ref&gt;Homer - Books and Biography. [[Martin Litchfield West]] in his 2010 commentary on the ''Iliad'' uses comparative evidence and the literary Shield of Achilles as one of many data that for him establish a composition date of 680-650.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identity of Homer==
Wolf's speculations were in harmony with the ideas and sentiment of the time, and his historical arguments, especially his long array of testimonies to the work of Peisistratus, were hardly challenged. The effect of Wolf's ''Prolegomena'' was so overwhelming, and its determination so decisive, that, although a few protests were made at the time, the true Homeric controversy did not begin until after his death in 1824.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The first considerable antagonist of the Wolfian school was [[Gregor Wilhelm Nitzsch]], whose writings cover the years between 1828 and 1862, and deal with every side of the controversy. In the earlier part of his ''Metetemata'' (1830), Nitzsch took up the question of written or unwritten literature, on which Wolf's entire argument turned, and showed that the art of writing must be anterior to Peisistratus. In the later part of the same series of discussions (1837), and in his chief work (''Die Sagenpoesie der Griechen'', 1852), he investigated the structure of the Homeric poems, and their relation to the other epics of the Trojan cycle.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

These epics had in the meantime been made the subject of a work which, for exhaustive learning and delicacy of artistic perception, has few rivals in the history of [[philology]]: the Epic cycle of [[Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker]]. The confusion which previous scholars had made between the ancient post-Homeric poets (such as [[Arctinus of Miletus]] and [[Lesches]]) and the learned mythological writers (like the ''scriptor cyclicus'' of [[Horace]]) was first cleared up by Welcker. Wolf had argued that, had the cyclic writers known the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' which we possess, they would have imitated the unity of structure which distinguishes these two poems. The aim of Welcker's work was to show that the Homeric poems had influenced both the form and the substance of epic poetry.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Thus arose a conservative school who admitted more or less freely the absorption of preexisting lays in the formation of the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'', and also the existence of considerable interpolations, but assigned the main work of formation to prehistoric times and the genius of a great poet.&lt;ref&gt;Caldecott, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the two epics were by the same author remained an open question; the tendency of this group of scholars was towards separation. Regarding the use of writing, too, they were not unanimous. [[Karl Otfried Müller]], for instance, maintained the view of Wolf on this point, while strenuously combating the inference which Wolf drew from it.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The ''Prolegomena'' bore on the title-page the words "Volumen I", but no second volume ever appeared; nor was any attempt made by Wolf himself to compose it or carry his theory further. The first important steps in that direction were taken by [[Johann Gottfried Jakob Hermann]], chiefly in two dissertations, ''De interpolationibus Homeri'' ([[Leipzig]], 1832), and ''De iteratis apud Homerum'' (Leipzig, 1840), called forth by the writings of Nitzsch. As the word "interpolation" implies, Hermann did not maintain the hypothesis of a conflation of independent lays. Feeling the difficulty of supposing that all ancient minstrels sang of the wrath of Achilles or the return of Odysseus (leaving out even the capture of Troy itself), he was led to assume that two poems of no great compass, dealing with these two themes, became so famous at an early period as to throw other parts of the Trojan story into the background and were then enlarged by successive generations of rhapsodists. Some parts of the ''Iliad'', moreover, seemed to him to be older than the poem on the wrath of Achilles; and thus, in addition to the Homeric and post-Homeric matter, he distinguished a pre-Homeric element.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The conjectures of Hermann, in which the Wolfian theory found a modified and tentative application, were presently thrown into the shade by the inure trenchant method of [[Karl Lachmann]], who (in two papers read to the Berlin Academy in 1837 and 1841) sought to show that the ''Iliad'' was made up of sixteen independent lays, with various enlargements and interpolations, all finally reduced to order by Peisistratus. The first book, for instance, consists of a lay on the anger of Achilles (1–347), and two continuations, the return of [[Chryseis]] (430–492) and the scenes in Olympus (348–429, 493–611). The second book forms a second lay, but several passages, among them the speech of [[Odysseus]] (278–332), are interpolated. In the third book, the scenes in which [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] and [[Priam]] take part (including the making of the truce) are pronounced to be interpolations; and so on.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

New methods try also to elucidate the question. Combining information technologies and statistics, the [[stylometry]] allows to scan various linguistic units: words, parts of speech, sounds... Based on the frequencies of Greek letters, a first study of Dietmar Najock&lt;ref&gt;Najock Dietmar, 1995, [http://promethee.philo.ulg.ac.be/RISSHpdf/Annee1995/Articles/DNajock.pdf "Letter Distribution and Authorship in Early Greek Epics"], ''Revue informatique et Statistique dans les Sciences Humaines'', XXXI, 1 à 4, p. 129–154.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly shows the internal cohesion of the Iliad and the Odyssey. Taking into account the repetition of the letters, a recent study of Stephan Vonfelt&lt;ref&gt;Vonfelt Stephan, 2010, [http://graphometrie.free.fr/publications/Arch.pdf "Archéologie numérique de la poésie grecque"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217002555/http://graphometrie.free.fr/publications/Arch.pdf |date=2013-12-17 }}, Université de Toulouse. &lt;/ref&gt; highlights the unity of the works of Homer compared to Hesiod. The thesis of modern Analysts being questioned, the debate remains open.

==Current Status of the Homeric Question==
Most scholars, although disagreeing on other questions about the genesis of the poems, agree that the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' were not produced by the same author, based on "the many differences of narrative manner, theology, ethics, vocabulary, and geographical perspective, and by the apparently imitative character of certain passages of the ''Odyssey'' in relation to the ''Iliad''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = M.L. | year = 1999 | title = The Invention of Homer | jstor = 639863| journal = Classical Quarterly | volume = 49 | issue = 2| page = 364 | doi=10.1093/cq/49.2.364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=West|first1=Martin L.|title=Homeric Question|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe0605|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Latacz|first1=Joachim|last2=Bierl|first2=Anton|last3=Olson|first3=S.

'''John Ryan''' (1925–1992) was an Irish artist, broadcaster, publisher, critic, editor, and [[Public house|publican]].

Ryan was a well-known man of letters, artist and a key figure in bohemian Dublin of the 1940s and 1950s. Founded [[Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art]], in response to Irish trade and censorship restrictions. Friend and intimate (and sometime benefactor) to a number of struggling artists and writers in the post-war era, such as [[Patrick Kavanagh]] and [[Brendan Behan]]; Ryan's memoirs, ''Remembering How We Stood'', evoke literary Dublin of the period 1945-55. Involved in numerous literary events and happenings and, with [[Brian O'Nolan]], organised the first [[Bloomsday]].

==Biography==
John Ryan attended [[Clongowes Wood College]] and the [[National College of Art and Design]] (NCAD), Dublin. One of the eight children of [[Séamus Ryan]],&lt;ref name=Ryan&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a member of [[Seanad Éireann]], and his wife Agnes Ryan née Harding who came from Kilfeacle and Solohead respectively in [[County Tipperary]] and who were [[Irish republicanism|Republican]] activists during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. His mother was a patron of the painter [[Jack Yeats]], amongst others. His sister was the actress [[Kathleen Ryan]]. Several of Ryan's children followed him into the arts: son and namesake [[John Ryan (publisher)|John Ryan]] (journalist, publisher and actor); [[Seamus Ryan (photographer)|Seamus Ryan]]  (photographer); Anna Livia Ryan (actress).&lt;ref name=ria-dict1&gt;{{cite book| last = McGuire| first = James| last2 = Quinn | first2 = James |year=2009|title=Dictionary of Irish Biography|volume= Volume V|location=Dublin|publisher= Royal Irish Academy-Cambridge University Press|ISBN = 978-0-521-63331-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Ryan studied at the [[National College of Art and Design|NCAD]], but was largely a self-taught painter through a practice of 'careful intelligent observation' combined with 'a genuine and humorous love of land, sea and human tradition' (Hilary Pyle, 'John Ryan exhibition in Cork', [[The Irish Times]], 23 October 1981). He was a regular exhibitor at the [[Royal Hibernian Academy]] (RHA) from 1946 onwards, and also showed at the annual Oireachtas and the Irish Exhibition of Living Art (IELA). Designed theatre sets for the [[Abbey Theatre|Abbey]], [[Gate Theatre|Gate]], [[Olympia Theatre, Dublin|Olympia]] and [[Gaiety Theatre, Dublin|Gaiety Theatres]] as well as for the stage in London. He also acted in and produced several plays.

In response to Irish trade and censorship restrictions founded ''[[Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art]]'' (1949–1951), and was editor of ''[[The Dublin Magazine]]'' from 1970–75. As a writer and critic he contributed to literary magazines and newspapers. Publishing two memoirs, ''Remembering How We Stood'', a memoir of post-war literary Dublin, and ''A Wave of the Sea'' (Ward River, 1981), a marine memoir. A broadcaster from the early 1950s he became a long-time contributor to Sunday Miscellany on [[Radio Éireann]] (RTÉ Radio). Purchased The Bailey pub in 1957 which became a famous literary venue frequented by characters such as Kavanagh, O'Nolan, et al. A friend and intimate to a number of struggling artists and writers in the post-war period, such as [[Brendan Behan|Behan]], [[Anthony Cronin]], [[Patrick Swift]], [[Seán O'Sullivan (painter)|Seán O'Sullivan]], [[Pearse Hutchinson]], [[J. P. Donleavy]] and [[Brian O'Nolan]], et al., he was also a benefactor to some of these artists, particularly Patrick Kavanagh. During the war years he very cheaply rented a space above the family's Monument Creameries store (now a Burger King) on Grafton Street to sculptor [[Desmond MacNamara]], and which became the site for a famous bohemian salon attended by all of the foregoing names and many more.

Ryan was an important early champion of James Joyce's work in Ireland at a time when Joyce was largely ignored in his homeland: with Brian O'Nolan he organised the first [[Bloomsday]] celebration; in 1951 to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the death of James Joyce he published a special number  of ''Envoy'' dedicated to Joyce "which would reflect the attitudes and opinions of his fellow countryman towards their illustrious compatriot"&lt;ref&gt;John Ryan, introduction to ''A Bash In The Tunnel'': James Joyce by the Irish (Brighton: Clifton Books, 1970)&lt;/ref&gt;  (Envoy, Vol. 5, No. 17, April 1951), inviting Brian O'Nolan to be guest editor; edited ''A Bash in the Tunnel'': James Joyce by the Irish, [[Patrick Kavanagh]], [[Brian O'Nolan]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Ulick O'Connor]], [[Edna O'Brien]] (Brighton: Clifton Books 1970); saved [[Leopold Bloom]]'s front door to 7 Eccles Street from demolition and used it in The Bailey pub in St. Anne Street, Dublin, from whence it was removed and transported to the Joyce Museum on N. Gt. George's St., Oct. 1995; arranged that the [[James Joyce Tower and Museum|James Joyce Tower]] become a museum; Secretary of the James Joyce Society of Ireland 1970–74.

==Envoy==
December 1949– July 1951. Founded and edited by Ryan.
Envoy was inaugurated in response to Irish trade and censorship restrictions which had forced many writers to seek publication outside their homeland.
During its brief existence, ''Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art'', published the work of a broad range of writers, Irish and others. The first to publish [[J. P. Donleavy]], [[Brendan Behan]]'s first short stories and his first poem, and an extract from [[Samuel Beckett]]'s Watt. Envoy included [[Patrick Kavanagh]]'s infamous monthly "Diary". [[Brian O'Nolan]] was another substantial contributor and was "honorary editor"&lt;ref&gt;'In 1951, whilst I was editor of the Irish literary periodical Envoy, I decided that it would be a fitting thing to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the death of James Joyce by bringing out a special number dedicated to him which would reflect the attitudes and opinions of his fellow countrymen towards their illustrious compatriot. To this end I began by inviting Brian Nolan to act as honorary editor for this particular issue. His own genius closely matched, without in anyway resembling or attempting to counterfeit, Joyce's. But if the mantle of Joyce (or should we say the waistcoat?) were ever to be passed on, nobody would be half so deserving of it as the man whom under his other guises as Flann O'Brien and Myles Na gCopaleen, proved himself incontestably to be the most creative writer and mordant wit that Ireland had given us since Shem the Penman himself.' – John Ryan, Introduction to ''A Bash in the Tunnel'' (1970) [http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/r/Ryan_J2/life.htm John Ryan (1925–92) Ricorso.net]&lt;/ref&gt; for the special number commemorating James Joyce.

==Remembering How We Stood==
An affectionate account of Bohemian Dublin in the 1950s with Behan, Kavanagh, J. P. Donleavy (q.v.), Anthony Cronin and other Dublin characters. Ryan:
&lt;blockquote&gt; Dublin was a town of ‘characters’ then as now, and I suppose will ever be. A man I knew was taking a stroll down Grafton Street one day when he happened to overhear part of a discussion which three citizens were having outside Mitchell’s café. The gist of their dialogue was that they were deploring the absence from the Dublin scene of any real ‘characters’. They appeared to be genuinely aggrieved. They were, in fact, Myles na gCopaleen, Sean O’Sullivan and Brendan Behan.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the foreword by [[J. P. Donleavy]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As one reads his words, dressed in their wonderful finery of irony, the world he speaks of reblossoms to be back again awhile. To see, feel and smell the Dublin of that day... a masterpiece of reminiscence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==First Bloomsday Celebration==

BLOOMSDAY (a term Joyce himself did not employ) was invented in 1954, the 50th anniversary, when John Ryan and the novelist [[Flann O'Brien]] organised what was to be a daylong pilgrimage along the Ulysses route. They were joined by Patrick Kavanagh, Anthony Cronin, Tom Joyce (a dentist who, as Joyce's cousin, represented the family interest) and AJ Leventhal (Registrar of Trinity College). Ryan had engaged two horse drawn cabs, of the old-fashioned kind, which in Ulysses Mr. Bloom and his friends drive to poor Paddy Dignam's funeral. The party were assigned roles from the novel. They planned to travel round the city through the day, visiting in turn the scenes of the novel, ending at night in what had once been the brothel quarter of the city, the area which Joyce had called Nighttown. The pilgrimage was abandoned halfway through, when the weary pilgrims succumbed to inebriation and rancour at the Bailey pub in the city centre, which Ryan then owned, and at which, in 1967, he installed the door to No. 7 Eccles Street (Leopold Bloom's front door) having rescued it from demolition . A Bloomsday record of 1954, informally filmed by John Ryan, follows this pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.ozemail.com.au/~maelduin/firstbloom.html An account of the first Bloomsday]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patrick Kavanagh: 'O commemorate me where there is water'==
Whenever you mention Patrick Kavanagh’s seat on the [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal Dublin]], most people will immediately think of the more famous park bench with the statue of Paddy himself sitting to one side of the seat almost beckoning for someone to sit down beside him. This bench is situated on the north bank of the Grand Canal between [[Baggot Street]] Bridge and the upstream Eustace Bridge. John Coll produced the sculpture and the seat was unveiled by President [[Mary Robinson]] on 11 June 1991, however this is not the original seat.
Only a relatively few people will be aware of the lesser known original Kavanagh seat situated on the South Bank at the Lock Gates close to Baggot Street Bridge. As is well known from his poem and heavy hints to his friends, he wished to be commemorated with a simple canal side seat near the lock gates of Baggot Street Bridge. To this effect shortly after his death in 1967, a committee was formed by the late John Ryan and Denis Dwyer to collect a sum of money to purchase the materials and labour for the seat. The seat was erected in the poet's memory by his friends in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Brady. His father and namesake was one of the original committee members, with John Ryan, of the Grand Canal South Bank Seat [http://kavanaghseat.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''livery collar''' or '''chain of office''' is a [[collar (jewelry)|collar]] or heavy [[Link chain|chain]], usually of [[gold]], worn as insignia of office or a mark of [[fealty]] or other association in [[Europe]] from the [[Middle Ages]] onwards.

One of the oldest and best-known livery collars is the [[#Collar of Esses|Collar of Esses]], which has been in continuous use in England since the 14th century.

==History==

===Origins===
Various forms of [[livery]] were used in the [[Middle Ages]] to denote attachment to a great person by friends, servants, and political supporters.  The collar, usually of precious metal, was the grandest form of these, usually given by the person the livery denoted to his closest or most important associates, but should not, in the early period, be seen as separate from the wider phenomenon of livery badges, clothes and other forms.  From the collar hung a [[heraldic badge|badge]] or device indicating the person the livery related to; the most important part of the ensemble for contemporaries.  Equally gold collars that had no livery connotations were worn.

Livery collars seem to be first recorded in the 14th century.  [[Charles V of France]] in 1378 granted to his [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] [[Geoffrey de Belleville]] the right of bearing in all feasts and in all companies the collar of the ''Cosse de Geneste'' or [[Broom (shrub)#Historical uses|Broomcod]], a collar which was accepted and worn even by the English kings, [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] sending such collars to [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] and to his three uncles.  Although he distributed "genet" badges much more widely, only about twenty collars per year were given out, and it was treated somewhat as the sign of a pseudo-chivalric order, although no such order formally existed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2st-PkahafIC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=%22Personal+device%22+livery&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8jhsTKeAEcPv4AbK24GxAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Crane, 19]&lt;/ref&gt; The collar of Esses is first recorded earlier than this, as being given by [[John of Gaunt]], and remained in use by the [[House of Lancaster]] throughout the [[Wars of the Roses]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dez8trnjfbUC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=%22Personal+device%22+livery&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8jhsTKeAEcPv4AbK24GxAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Personal%20device%22%20livery&amp;f=false Collar of Esses]&lt;/ref&gt;

This French type of collar, a chain of couples of broomcods linked by jewels, is seen in the contemporary [[Wilton Diptych]] portrait of Richard II, with Richard's own [[coat of arms|device]] of the white [[Deer|hart]] hanging below (the angels accompanying the Virgin also wear Richard's livery badges). The same collar was worn by [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] on the way to his [[coronation|crowning]]. During the sitting of the [[Parliament of England]] in 1394 the complaints of [[Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel]] against Richard II are recorded, one of his grievances being that the king had been wearing the livery collar of his uncle [[John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster]], and that people of the king's following wore the same livery. To which the king answered that soon after the return from [[Spain]] (in 1389) of his uncle, the duke, he himself took the collar from his uncle's neck, putting it on his own, which collar the king would wear and use for a sign of the good and whole-hearted love between them, even as he wore the liveries of his other uncles. Livery collars of the king of France, of [[Anne of Bohemia|Queen Anne]] and of the dukes of [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|York]] and Lancaster are recorded amongst the royal plate and jewels which in the first year of Henry IV had come to the king's hands. The inventory shows that Queen Anne's collar, was made up of sprigs of [[rosemary]] garnished with [[pearl]]s. The York collar had [[falcon]]s and [[fetterlock]]s, and the Lancaster collar was doubtless that '''Collar of Esses''' used by the duke's son, [[Henry IV of England|Henry of Bolingbroke]] (Henry IV), as an earl, duke and king.

==Collar of Esses ==
This famous livery collar, which has never passed out of use, takes many forms, its Esses being sometimes linked together chainwise, and sometimes, in early examples, as the ornamental bosses of a garter-shaped strap-collar. The oldest [[effigy]] bearing it is that in Spratton church of Sir [[John Swynford]], who died in 1371. Swynford was a follower of John of Gaunt, and the date of his death easily disposes of the theory that the Esses were devised by Henry IV to stand for his motto or "word" of Soverayne. Many explanations are given of the origin of these letters, but none has as yet been established. During the reigns of Henry IV,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7653348.stm "Henry VIII-era chain up for sale"], 5 October 2008, BBC.com&lt;/ref&gt; his son ([[Henry V of England|Henry V]]), and grandson ([[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]), the collar of Esses was a royal badge of the Lancastrian house and party, the white swan, as in the [[Dunstable Swan Jewel]], usually being its pendant.

In one of Henry VI's own collars the S was joined to the [[Order of the Broom-cod|broomcod]] of the French device, symbolizing the king's claim to the two kingdoms. The kings of the house of York and their chief followers wore the Yorkist collar of [[sun]]s and [[rose]]s, with the white lion of [[Earl of March|March]], the Clare bull, or [[Richard III of England|Richard]]'s white boar for a pendant [[heraldic badge|device]]. [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] brought back the collar of Esses, a [[portcullis]] or a [[Tudor rose]] hanging from it, although in a portrait of him, in the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]], he wears the rose [[Rose (heraldry)#Appearance|''en soleil'']] alternating with knots, and his son (later [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]), when young, had a collar of red and white roses.  It was presented to ministers and courtiers, and came to represent more a symbol of office by the time of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].

The term "Collar of SS" was preferred by Victorian antiquaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Charles | last = Boutell | title = Heraldry Historical &amp; Popular | place = London | year = 1863 | page = 298}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since World War II, as "SS" is usually associated with the [[Schutzstaffel]], the term is less often used because of its [[Nazi]] connotation.

==Private livery collars==
[[File:BerkeleyMermaidCollar 1417 WottonUnderEdge Gloucestershire.jpg|thumb|200px|Drawing of detail of mermaid collar of [[Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley]] (d. 1417), from his [[monumental brass]] at [[Wotton-under-Edge]], Gloucestershire]]
Besides these royal collars, the 14th and 15th centuries show many private devices. A [[monumental brass]] at [[Mildenhall, Suffolk|Mildenhall]] shows a knight whose badge of a dog or wolf circled by a crown hangs from a collar with edges suggesting a pruned bough or the ragged staff. [[Thomas of Markenfield]] (d. c. 1415) on his brass at [[Ripon]] has a strange collar of park palings with a badge of a [[deer|hart]] in a park, and [[Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley]] (d. 1417) wears one set with [[mermaid]]s, the Berkeley family [[heraldic badge]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis, C. T. ''The Monumental Brasses of Gloucestershire'', London, 1899. Davis correctly states the date of death as 1417, yet incorrectly calls him 4th Lord in place of 5th.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance chains==
In the Renaissance, gold chains tended to replace collars, and [[portrait miniature]] of the donor tended to replace the earlier badges with  symbolic devices, although "picture boxes" containing miniatures could be highly extravagant pieces of jewellery.  The Elizabethan artist [[Nicholas Hilliard]] was both a goldsmith and miniaturist, and so produced the whole of pieces like the ''Armada Jewel'', given by [[Queen Elizabeth I of England]] to a courtier.  When the [[Earl of Rutland]] returned from an embassy to Denmark, sixteen members of his party were given chains of gold with the [[James I of England]]'s picture, and others received just a picture.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1975, pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;  During the sixteenth century collars became marks of a specific office or Order, and subsequently remained so.

===Mayoral collars===
[[File:Susan Fennell cropped.jpg|thumb|200px|Susan Fennell, then-mayor of [[Brampton, Ontario]], Canada from 2000 to 2014, pictured wearing a modern mayoral collar.]]
Most British and Irish [[mayor]]s wear a collar/chain of office, and new ones are still designed for new municipalities. The mayor's spouse may have a much smaller version. These are worn over normal clothes when on official duties. Following British practice, most [[Canada|Canadian]], Australian and New Zealand mayors also wear chains of office. The custom also spread outside the Commonwealth, to Germany (originally only Prussia) in 1808, to the Netherlands by royal decree in 1852 and to Norway after the mayor of Oslo received one as a gift in 1950, and most Norwegian mayors now have mayoral chains.

===Collars of orders of knighthood===
{{main|Collar (Order of Knighthood)}}

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Charles-garter-robes.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Charles, Prince of Wales]] wearing the collar of the [[Order of the Garter]].]] --&gt;

Collars of various devices are worn by the knights of some of the European [[orders of knighthood]]. The custom was begun by [[Philip III, Duke of Burgundy]], who gave his knights of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Golden Fleece]], badges of a golden fleece hung from a collar of flints, steels and sparks. Following this new fashion, [[Louis XI of France]], when instituting his [[order of St. Michael]] in 1469, gave the knights collars of scallop shells linked on a chain.

The chain was doubled by [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]], and the pattern suffered other changes before the order lapsed in 1830.

At the end of the 18th century most of the European orders had only one rank—that of Knight—and although they usually had collars the cross or badge was now worn on a ribbon around the neck or over the right shoulder. When the orders became more democratic several ranks were introduced and only the highest grade, the Grand Commanders or Grand Crosses, wore collars. The Netherlands never had collars but several Belgian, most of the Austrian and Prussian orders and several Portuguese orders had collars. In Portugal all the members of these orders of knighthood wore a collar but the collars of the Grand-crosses were more elaborate.

In England, until the reign of Henry VIII, the [[Order of the Garter]], most ancient of the great knightly orders, had no collar. But the [[House of Tudor|Tudor]] king must needs match in all things with continental sovereigns, and the present collar of the Garter knights, with its golden knots and its buckled garters enclosing white roses set on red roses, has its origin in the Tudor age.

Knights of most of the British orders have collars which are worn on special occasions, but not the Knights Bachelor or holders of decorations such as the [[Distinguished Service Order]], the [[Order of Merit]], The [[Order of the Companions of Honour]] and the [[Imperial Service Order]]. The [[Royal Victorian Chain]] is a collar and there are no other insignia.

In France, Emperor [[Napoleon I]] introduced the "Grand aigle", a collar, as the highest rank in his [[Légion d'honneur]]. It did not survive his downfall.

Sometimes the collar is the insignia of office of the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] of the order; the French president therefore wears the collar of the Order of the Légion d'honneur. In other countries such as Brazil the collar is a rank above that of a Grand Cross and it is reserved for the president and foreign heads of state.

===Collars of Freemasonry===
Collars also have a long history within [[Freemasonry]].  Collars are often worn by officers of high rank.  Nearly all Grand Lodge officers wear collars as an emblem of their office.  In history, many such collars are quite valuable, featuring gold and precious jewels. 

Collars vary widely among Masonic Grand Lodges. While those Lodges working under the Grand Lodge of England have fairly uniform designs, Grand Lodges in the United States vary widely, employing collars made from metal chains backed by velvet, to those made of velvet and embroidered with gold and silver bullion thread.

Today, Lodge officers wear a cloth or fabric collar with a simple jewel of their office pendant to it. Each jewel represents a skill or virtue which he possesses and instructs the brothers of Masonry in. In some jurisdictions, these jewels are silver-plated for the Craft or Blue Lodges under 100 years old. In cases of Lodges over 100 years, these jewels are gold-plated. The collar shapes are identical which sit on the wearers shoulders and fall over the chest, ending in a point between the breasts. Except the Master's collar which is circular and far more elaborate in design signifying his skills and knowledge in the Craft are of the highest degree.

'''Lyricism''' is a quality that expresses deep feelings or emotions in an inspired work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = lyricism|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lyricism|website = Merriam Webster|accessdate = 2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Lyricism is when art is expressed in a beautiful or imaginative way, or when it has an expressive quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=lyricism|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/lyricism|website=Oxford US English Language Dictionary|accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term lyricism is often used in conjunction with art composed of sound alone, it can also apply to all forms of art including performance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeFrantz|first1=Thomas F.|title=Dancing Revelations: Alvin Ailey's Embodiment of African American Culture|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=130|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; architecture,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Jean-Louis|title=Le Corbusier, 1887-1965: The Lyricism of Architecture in the Machine Age|date=2004|publisher=Taschen|accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; or film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dillon|first1=Steven|title=Derek Jarman and Lyric Film: The Mirror and the Sea|date=2004|publisher=University of Texas Press|page=12|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses of lyricism ==
[[File:VanGogh-starry night edit.jpg|left|thumb|The Starry Night]]Although it is impossible to define beauty, emotion, or imagination in a definitive manner, it is possible to draw upon examples of works that may share those characteristics in both subtle and dramatic ways.  The following are some classic examples of lyricism:
*'''Poetry.''' Maya Angelou's poetry has intrinsic lyricism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Maya Angelou's I Know why the Caged Bird Sings: A Casebook|last = Braxton|first = Joanne M.|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Music.''' In Jazz, [[Charlie Parker]] is renowned for his lyricism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Charlie Parker Companion: Six Decades of Commentary|last = Woideck|first = Carl|publisher = Schirmer Books|year = 1998|isbn = |location = |pages = 214}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Classical music, nearly all of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's]] work has been revered at one time or another for its lyricism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Perspectives on Mozart Performance|last = Todd|first = R.

*'''Dance.''' [[Swan Lake|Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake]], or [[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]] exhibit classic lyricism. 
*[[File:Colors Streaming, Winter Prayer Hall, Nasir-Ol-Molk Mosque, Shiraz (14288444120).jpg|thumb|Nasir ol Molk Mosque]]'''Film.''' ''Lost, Lost, Lost'' (1976) has been described as an example of the mid-20th century lyricism movement in film, as well as ''[[Dog Star Man|The Art of Vision]]'' (1965) and ''[[Fireworks (1947 film)|Fireworks]]'' (1947).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Film Experience: An Introduction|last = Timothy Corrigan|first = Patricia White|publisher = Macmillan|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 306}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Architecture'''. The [[Nasir ol Molk Mosque|Nasir ol-Molk Mosque]] may be seen as an example, as well as the [[Taj Mahal]], or the [[Sistine Chapel]]. Modern examples would be some of the later works of [[Le Corbusier]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*'''Painting.''' [[The Starry Night]] by [[Vincent van Gogh]] can be considered the ''[[sine qua non]]'' of lyricism in the world of art.

The '''''Madonna and Child with Sts Jerome and Mary Magdalen (The Day)''''' is an [[oil painting|oil on canvas]] painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Antonio Allegri|Correggio]] dating from around 1528 and housed in the [[Galleria Nazionale di Parma|Galleria Nazionale]] of [[Parma]], [[Italy]].

==History==
The canvas was commissioned in 1523 by Briseide Colla for a private chapel on the right side of the church of [[Sant'Antonio Abate, Parma|Sant'Antonio Abate]] in Parma. Contemporary art historian and painter [[Giorgio Vasari]] described the work's ''il mirabile colorito'' ("wonderful color"), and it was also studied by [[El Greco]].

In the early 18th century, the church needed costly restoration works and several collectors, including the Kings of Poland and France and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], offered to buy the work. However, in 1749 it was transferred into the [[Cathedral of Parma]] and later was bought by the [[Duchy of Parma]]. During the [[Napoleonic Wars|French occupation of northern Italy]], it was stolen and brought to France. The painting was returned to Italy in 1815 and placed on display in the Parma gallery. A 1724 copy of the painting hangs in the chapel of [[Palais Rohan, Strasbourg]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7463">'''Martine Chartrand''' (born 1962) is a [[Haitian Canadian]] filmmaker, visual artist and teacher. She practices a [[paint-on-glass animation]] technique to create her films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Cassivi|first=Marc|date=23 August 2012|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/debats/chroniques/marc-cassivi/201208/23/01-4567443-la-quete-de-martine.php|title=Martine's quest|work=La Press|accessdate=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout Chartrand's career, she has been involved with numerous films and has made three animated shorts which have been exhibited across Canada and internationally.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Forte|first=Sandro|date=15 April 2016|url=https://cinetalk.net/2016/04/15/the-gentle-leader-the-work-of-martine-chartrand/|title=The Gentle Leader (The Work of Martine Chartrand) |work=Cinetalk.net|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her films often deal with social and cultural issues relating to [[Culture of Africa|Black culture]] and [[African diaspora#History|Black history]].

==Biography==
===Early years===
Born in 1962, Chartrand was adopted and raised in Montreal, Quebec. She graduated from Concordia University with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1986 and earned a certificate in Arts Education at UQAM in 1988. After graduating she began making a living by creating poster graphics and giving workshops in exhibitions across Canada and Europe. Before becoming involved in animation, Chartrand worked as a painter and illustrator.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Parris|first=Amanda|date=17 February 2017|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/7-african-canadian-female-filmmakers-you-need-to-know-1.3976999|title=7 African-Canadian female filmmakers you need to know|work=CBCNews|accessdate=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Chartrand became working as a layout and colour artist. She joined the National Film Board officially as a colour artist, assisting Pierre M. Trudeau during the shooting of ''Enfantillages'' (1990). She then collaborated on ''Jours de plaine'' (1990), co-directed by Réal Bérard and André Leduc.

===Professional career===
Additionally, Chartrand is in high demand as a lecturer for conferences, master classes, and art workshops worldwide. She guides artists and shares the techniques and craft involved in creating paint-on-glass animation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Film career===
In 1992, Chartrand directed her first animated film for the NFB ''T.V. Tango''. An award-winning short designed to encourage children to be critical of televised advertising messages and help them understand what they're seeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caribefilm.cult.cu/es/node/585 |title=MARTINE CHARTRAND |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;  |website=Travelling Caribbean Film Showcase |publisher=Muestra Itinerante de Cine del Caribe |access-date=12 February 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Chartrand was given advanced courses in paint-on-glass animation by [[Aleksandr Petrov (animator)|Alexander Petrov]]. A painstaking process which involves years of painting thousands of paintings and filming them frame by frame to create a fluid motion.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Produced by the National Film Board of Canada, ''[[Black Soul]]'' (French: Âme noire) is an award-winning animated short directed and written by Martine Chartrand. It is the story of a young boy who explores his cultural heritage through the stories of his grandmother. An emotionally rich and vibrant piece which employs painted glass frames shot with a 35mm camera. Its soundtrack features traditional African rhythms, gospel music by Ranee Lee and a composition by jazz pianist Oliver Jones. Among its achievements, [[Black Soul]] won the Golden Bear for Best Short Film at the 51st Berlin International Film Festival.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For 8 years, Chartrand worked steadily on her next film ''MacPherson''. Inspired by a song by famed French-Canadian singer-songwriter [[Félix Leclerc]], ''MacPherson'' is a poetic film which combines Quebec folk music with vivid painted imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Cassivi|first=Marc|date=23 August 2012|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/debats/chroniques/marc-cassivi/201208/23/01-4567443-la-quete-de-martine.php|title=Martine's quest|work=La Press|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chartrand is the subject of the documentary ''[[Finding Macpherson]]'' (2014) directed by Serge Giguère which follows the artistic processes she undertook in order to create her short film ''MacPherson'' (2012). It also draws parallels between Chartrand and Frank Randolph Macpherson, as she traces her Haitian heritage through the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Mullen|first=Patrick|date=23 April 2015|url=http://povmagazine.com/articles/view/hot-docs-2015-character-studies|title=Hot Docs 2015: Character Studies: Artists and eccentrics populate the 2015 festival |work=Point Of View Magazine|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic style==
Paint-on-glass animation style involves the manipulation of wet media to create animated films. The artist's paints are moved around the glass which is placed directly under a camera. When filmed frame-by-frame, the images blend and give the illusion of merging and melting into each successive frame. The end result is a fluid sense of movement which creates a painterly effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://takeone.athabascau.ca/index.php/takeone/article/viewFile/912/900 |title=Short takes: Black Soul |author=McSorley, Tom |date=2001 |website=Take One: Film &amp; Television in Canada |publisher=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |access-date=12 February 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:باران در قلعه رستم.JPG|thumb|300px|Rostam castle on Mt Khajeh]]

'''Mount Khwaja'''&lt;!-- both Encyclopædia Iranica and Ramazan-nia transliterate as "Khwaja" --&gt; or '''Mount Khwajeh''' (locally: ''Kuh-e Kh&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;ājeh'') is a flat-topped black [[basalt]] hill rising up as an island in the middle of [[Lake Hamun]], in the [[Iran]]ian province of [[Sistan and Baluchestan Province|Sistan and Baluchestan]].

The trapezoid-shaped basalt lava outcropping, located 30&amp;nbsp;km southwest of the town of [[Zabol]], rises to 609 meters above sea level and has a diameter ranging from 2.0 to 2.5 kilometres. It is the only natural height in the Sistan area, and is named after an Islamic pilgrimage site on the hill: the tomb and shrine of Khwaja Ali Mahdi, a descendant of [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]].&lt;!-- contra "of the Prophet Mohammad" in Ramazan-nia source --&gt;

Mount Khwaja is also an important archaeological site: On the southern promontory of the eastern slope, the ruins of a citadel complex - known as the '''Ghagha-Shahr''' - with its remains of a [[fire temple]] attest to the importance of the island in pre-Islamic Iran. According to [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] legend, [[Lake Hamun]] is the keeper of Zoroaster's seed. In Zoroastrian eschatology, when the final renovation of the world is near, maidens will enter the lake and then give birth to the ''[[Saoshyant|saoshyans]]'', the saviours of humankind.

The fire temple is on a terrace behind high walls and is protected by two forts, whose remains are respectively known as '''Kok-e Zal''' and '''Chehel Dokhtaran'''. Collectively, the ruins are called '''Qal'a-e Kafaran''' "Fort of Infidels" or '''Qal'a-e Sam''' "Fort of Sam," the grandfather of the mythical [[Rostam]] (one of the fortresses here is named "Rostams castle"). Both names reflect pre-Islamic heritage. The walls of the temple were once extravagantly decorated with murals, some of which are now on display in museums in Tehran, Berlin, New Delhi and New York.

The citadel complex was first investigated by [[Marc Aurel Stein]] in 1915-1916. The site was later excavated by [[Ernst Herzfeld]], and was again investigated in part by Giorgio Gullini in a short expedition of 1960. Initially, Herzfeld tentatively dated the palace complex to the 1st century CE, that is, to the [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]] period (248 BCE-224 CE). Herzfeld later revised his estimate to a later date and today the [[Sassanid]] period (224-651 CE) is usually considered to be more likely. Three bas-reliefs on the outer walls that depict riders and horses are attributed to this later period. Beyond the citadel at the top of the plateau are several other unrelated buildings, of uncertain function and probably dating to the Islamic period.

==Name changes==
'''Ladislas Weisz''' was born June 13, 1899 in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. [[Antisemitism]] forced his family to change their name to the more Hungarian "''Péri''". When he moved to Germany, he was known as '''Laszlo Péri'''. After he moved to [[England]], he adopted the name "'''Peter Peri'''". His grandson, an artist born in 1971, also has the name [[Peter Peri]].

==Career==
Born in 1899, in Budapest into a large, [[Proletariat|proletarian]] Jewish family Peri became politicised at an early age. In 1919, he finished an apprenticeship as a bricklayer, and became a student at the workshops for proletariat fine arts in 1919. He was in contact with [[Lajos Kassák]] and the Activists. In 1917, he began his career as an actor at the MA Theater School, studying with János Mácsza. As part of a theatre company he went to [[Prague]] where he heard about the fall of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Republic of Councils]]. He studied architecture in 1919–20 in Budapest and [[Berlin]]. He lived for a short time in Paris in 1920, in the house of a socialist baker, before being forced to leave the country due to his political activities.

Peri moved to Vienna, then on to Berlin in 1921, where he created his first abstract geometric reliefs. In February 1922, he had a show with [[László Moholy-Nagy|Moholy-Nagy]] at [[Der Sturm Gallery]], Berlin. In 1923, his portfolio containing twelve [[linocut]]s was published by Der Sturm Verlag. His contributions to [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]] at the time were to challenge the surface of the wall by producing irregularly shaped wall reliefs and to open up new planes; namely the discovery of concrete as a potential sculptural medium, colouring it if necessary, and the appreciation of the hard contour as a visual device, as seen in his [[collage]]s and linoprints. These could be used to create a visual medium hovering between the relief and architecture; whereas Moholy-Nagy's ''Glasarchitektur'' achieved this using paint and canvas, Péri used less conventional media.

At the ''Grosse Berliner Kunstausstellung'' in May 1923, between the contributions of Van Doesburg and El Lissitzky’s ‘Proun Room’ he showed his three-piece {{cvt|7|m|ft}}x{{cvt|17|m|ft}} composition which, while it may also have been executed in paint on wood, had pretensions to be executed in concrete. Peri, joined the [[German Communist Party]] (KPD) in 1923. His 1924, constructivist design for a Lenin tribute for the German art exhibition in Moscow, marked the end of his investigations into the non-objective.

That same year Peri began to work for the Berlin municipal architectural office and was there from 1924 to 1928. Probably motivated by a vision to put his [[Productivism|productivist]] values into action, but frustrated he quit the job in 1928. In 1928, he signed the manifesto and statutes of the [[Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists|Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists of Germany]] (''Assoziation Revolutionärer Bildener Künstler Deutschlands'') (ARBKD) (ASSO) which, like other new and militant Communist art organisations, called for a reinvigoration of the idea of "proletarian culture" and suitably positive images of working-class life and culture. He was also a mMember of ''Die Abstrakten'' (The Abstracts) and ''Rote Gruppe'' (Red Group). In 1929, he returned to representational painting and sculpture.

Peri immigrated to England in 1933, after his wife Mary Macnaghten granddaughter of social reformer [[Charles Booth (social reformer)|Charles Booth]] was arrested in possession of Communist propaganda. In 1934, Peri contributed "several forceful works in coloured concrete" to the AIA (Artists’ International Association) exhibition The Social Scene. He made contact with [[John Heartfield]]. In England, he lived first in Ladbroke Grove, then in Hampstead; in 1938, he moved to a studio in Camden Town where he worked until 1966. While in Hampstead, Peri joined the recently founded English section of the Artists International (later to be known as Artists International Association), an association composed largely of commercial artists and designers whose declared intention was to mobilise "the international unity of artists against Imperialist War on the Soviet Union, Fascism and Colonial oppression".{{cn|date=July 2017}}  In July 1938, he had a solo exhibition London Life in Concrete in an empty building at 36 Soho Square. In 1939, he became a British citizen and took the name "Peter Peri". In November 1948, he held a solo show Peri's People at the AIA Gallery. Late in the 1940s he did a series of commissions for the London County Council. In 1951, Peri produced a sculptural group ''[[The Sunbathers]]'' for the [[Festival of Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;The sculpture was rediscovered in 2017: ''Guardian'' Friday 21 April 2017 "Naked ambition: £15,000 appeal to revive nude sunbather statues" by Mark Brown

When the [[Herbert Art Gallery &amp; Museum]] opened in 1960, Peri was commissioned to "represent the life and activities [of [[Coventry]]] in modern terms and materials"; the work is known simply as ''The Coventry Sculpture''&lt;ref&gt;''Coventry Gallery's Help for Local Artists'', [[The Times]], 9 March 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

Peri joined the [[Quaker]] faith and produced a small bronze sculpture of a Quaker Meeting, much loved by the students of [[Woodbrooke]] Study Centre,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodbrooke.org.uk/ Woodbrooke Quaker Centre website]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Birmingham]], where it is now located.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/qmh/2239272233/ Quaker Meeting sculpture on Flickr] (accessed 23 February 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Peri died January 19, 1967.

'''Political theatre''' is  [[theatre]] that comments on political and social issues.

==History==
In the history of theatre, there is long tradition of performances addressing issues of current events, especially those central to society itself. The [[political satire]] performed by the [[comic poets]] at the [[Ancient Greek theatre|theatres]] had considerable influence on [[public opinion]] in the [[Athenian democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, J. (1993) ''Comic Hero versus Political Elite'' pp.307-19 in {{cite book |editor=Sommerstein, A.H. |editor2=S. Halliwell |editor3=J. Henderson |editor4=B. Zimmerman |title=Tragedy, Comedy and the Polis |year=1993 |publisher=Levante Editori |location=Bari}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those earlier Western dramas, arising out of the [[polis]], or democratic [[city-state]] of Greek society, were performed in amphitheaters, central arenas used for theatrical performances, religious ceremonies and political gatherings; these dramas had a ritualistic and social significance that enhanced the relevance of the political issues being examined.

[[Shakespeare]] is an author of political theatre according to some academic scholars, who observe that his history plays examine the machinations of personal drives and passions determining political activity and that many of the tragedies such as ''[[King Lear]]'' and ''[[Macbeth]]'' dramatize political leadership and complexity subterfuges of human beings driven by the lust for power. For example, they observe that [[class struggle]] in the [[Roman Republic]] is central to ''[[Coriolanus]]''.&lt;ref name=DollimoreSinfieldDrakakis&gt;[[Jonathan Dollimore]] and [[Alan Sinfield]], eds. ''Political Shakespeare: Essays in [[Cultural materialism (cultural studies)|Cultural Materialism]]'' (Manchester, Eng.: Manchester UP, 1985), {{ISBN|0-7190-4352-2}}; John Drakakis, ed. ''Alternative Shakespeares'', New Accents Ser. (New York and London: Routledge, 1985), {{ISBN|0-415-02528-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically in [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russia]], the term political theatre was sometimes referred to as '''agitprop theatre''' or simply '''agitprop''', after the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] term [[agitprop]].&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/agitprop&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent political drama==

&lt;!--what are the sources of the following paragraphs?--&gt;
In later centuries, political theatre has sometimes taken a different form. Sometimes associated with [[cabaret]] and folk theatre, it has offered itself as a theatre 'of, by, and for the people'.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} In this guise, political theatre has developed within the civil societies under oppressive governments as a means of actual underground communication and the spreading of critical thought.

Often political theatre has been used to promote specific political theories or ideals, for example in the way agitprop theatre has been used to further [[Marxism]] and the development of [[communist]] sympathies.  Russian agitprop theater was noted for its cardboard characters of perfect virtue and complete evil, and its coarse ridicule.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Pipes]], ''Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime'', p303, {{ISBN|978-0-394-50242-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But Marxist theatre wasn't always this directly agitational.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} [[Bertolt Brecht]] developed a highly elaborate and sophisticated new [[aesthetics]]--[[epic theater]]—to address the spectator in a more rational way.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Brecht's aesthetics have influenced political playwrights throughout the world, especially in India and Africa.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} [[Augusto Boal]] developed the [[Bertolt Brecht|Brechtian]] form of ''Lehrstücke'' into  his internationally acclaimed ''Theatre of the Oppressed'', with its techniques of 'forum theatre' and 'invisible theatre', to further social change.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Boal's work in this area has contributed to the emergence of the [[Theatre for development|Theatre for Development]] movement across the world.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} In the sixties playwrights like [[Peter Weiss]] adopted a more 'documentary' approach towards political theatre, following on from the example of [[Erwin Piscator]] in the twenties. Weiss wrote plays closely based on historical documents like the proceedings of the Auschwitz trial in Frankfurt.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Less radical versions of political theatre have become established within the mainstream modern repertory - such as the realist dramas of [[Arthur Miller]] (''[[The Crucible]]'' and ''[[All My Sons]]''), which probe the behavior of human beings as social and political animals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

A new form of political theatre emerged in the twentieth century with [[feminism|feminist]] authors like [[Elfriede Jelinek]] or [[Caryl Churchill]], who often make use of the non-realistic techniques detailed above.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}. During the 1960s and 1970s, new theatres emerged addressing women's issues. These theatres went beyond producing feminist plays, but also sought to give women opportunities and work experience in all areas of theatrical production which had heretofore been dominated by men. In addition to playwright, producers, and actors, there were opportunities for women electricians, set designers, musical director, stage managers, etc.

[[The Living Theatre]], created by [[Judith Malina]] and her husband [[Julian Beck]] in 1947, which had its heyday in the 1960s, during the [[Vietnam War]], is a primary example of politically oriented Brechtian performance art in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}  Their original productions of [[Kenneth Brown (playwright)|Kenneth Brown]]'s ''[[The Brig (play)|The Brig]]'' (c. 1964), also filmed, and of [[Jack Gelber]]'s controversial play ''[[The Connection (1959 play)|The Connection]]'' and its 1961 [[The Connection (1961 film)|film]] rely upon and illustrate the [[dramaturgy]] of Brechtian [[alienation effect]] (''Verfremdungseffekt'') that most political theatre uses to some extent, forcing the audience to take a "critical perspective" on events being dramatized or projected on screen(s) and building on aspects of the [[Theatre of Cruelty]], which developed from the theory and practice of French early [[surrealist]] and proto-[[Theatre of the Absurd|absurdist]] [[Antonin Artaud]].&lt;ref name=LivTh&gt;The Living Theatre is currently still functioning and has produced a new production of ''[[The Brig (play)|The Brig]]''; see its website: [http://www.livingtheatre.org/ The Living Theatre]. Retrieved 18 Sept. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In American regional theatre, a politically oriented social orientation occurs in [[Street theatre]], such as that produced by the [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]] and ROiL.  The [[Detroit Repertory Theatre]] has been among those regional theaters at the forefront of political comedy, staging plays like [[Jacob M. Appel]]'s [[Arborophilia]], in which a lifelong Democrat prefers that her daughter fall in love with a poplar tree instead of a Republican activist.&lt;ref&gt;"Daughters in Love Fuel Mom's Dismay," ''Detroit Free Press'', November 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Chicago's [[Annoyance Theater]] produced [[Good Morning Gitmo]]: a one-act play by [[Mishu Hilmy]] and Eric Simon which lampoons the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|US Detention Center at Guantanamo Bay]].&lt;ref name="Hayford"&gt;Hayford, Justin [http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/good-morning-gitmo/Event?oid=15029124 Review: ''Good Morning Gitmo'']. [[Chicago Reader]]. Retrieved on November 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John McGrath (playwright)|John McGrath]], founder of the Scottish popular theatre company [[7:84]], argued that "the theatre can never 'cause' a social change. It can articulate pressure towards one, help people celebrate their strengths and maybe build their self-confidence… Above all, it can be the way people find their voice, their solidarity and their collective determination."&lt;ref name="McGrath"&gt;[[John McGrath (playwright)|John McGrath]], ''A Good Night Out, Popular Theatre: Audience, Class, Form'' (London: Nick Hern Books, 1991), {{ISBN|1-85459-370-6}}; ''The Bone Won't Break: On Theatre and Hope in Hard Times'' (London: Methuen, 1990), {{ISBN|0-413-63260-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Iraq War]] is the focus of some recent British political drama; for example, ''[[Stuff Happens]]'', by [[David Hare (dramatist)|David Hare]].  [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]] and [[Mark Ravenhill]] also satirize contemporary socio-political realities in their recent dramatic works.

[[Banner Theatre]] in [[Birmingham]], England, in the [[United Kingdom]], is an example of a specific kind of political theatre called [[Documentary theatre]].

[[File:Holbein-erasmus.jpg|thumb|300px|''Portrait of Erasmus of Rotterdam'', [[National Gallery]], London]]
[[File:Desidrius Erasmus by Hans Holbein.jpg|thumb|[[The Louvre]], 1523]]

[[Hans Holbein the Younger]] painted the '''''Portrait of [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]]''''' several times, and his paintings were much copied, at the time and later. It is difficult to disentangle Holbein's original work from that of his workshop and other copyists. Possibly five largely original versions survive, as well as a number of drawings made as studies.  

Holbein's portraits played an important part in spreading the painter's reputation across Europe, as they and their copies were widely distributed. When Holbein moved to England he had a letter of recommendation from Erasmus to [[Thomas More]], in whose house he initially lived.

==Commission==
[[Desiderius Erasmus]] of Rotterdam (1466/69–1536) was a renowned humanist scholar and theologian. He moved in 1521 to Basel, the city where Hans Holbein the Younger lived and had his workshop. Such was the fame of Erasmus, who corresponded with scholars throughout Europe, that he needed many portraits of himself to send abroad to his protectors; although not an admirer of painting, he understood the power of image.&lt;ref name="bg155"&gt;Bätschmann; Griener, 155&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quentin Matsys]] painted a noticeably younger Erasmus, writing, in 1517, and used another profile portrait for a [[medal]] in 1519.  [[Albrecht Dürer]] made a portrait in [[engraving]] in 1526. But it was Holbein's images that were endlessly copied. Of the work Erasmus wrote in 1524, "Recently I sent again two portraits of Erasmus to France, painted by a very skillful artist. The artist carried along my portrait to France."&lt;ref name="bg155" /&gt; 

==Versions==
There are three main portrait types: a three-quarters view, probably of 1523, best-known from the National Gallery version; a profile view also from 1523, reading, as in the [[Louvre]], and an older three-quarters view, perhaps c. 1530, probably best represented by the [[portrait miniature]], a roundel 10cm across, in the [[Kunstmuseum Basel]]. 

All of these were produced in many versions, several probably at least partly by Holbein himself, or supervised by him. The pose and face tends to remain the same, but the clothes and backgrounds vary. It seems to have been Holbein's practice to make a very [[List of portrait drawings by Hans Holbein the Younger|careful drawing of his subjects]] (though no full drawings for any of these portraits survive) and to then produce the painted portrait without the sitter being present.  The Louvre has drawings done as studies for the hands of both its painted version and the London version.

There is also a small emblemmatic depiction of an idealized Erasmus as the Roman god Terminus (his personal emblem), of 1532, now in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]].
   
===London===
The version also known as '''''Portrait of Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam with Renaissance Pilaster''''' is a 1523 painting in oil and [[tempera]] on panel, in the [[National Gallery]], London (on long-term loan from the [[Earl of Radnor]]).  Holbein painted three much-copied portraits of Erasmus in 1523, of which this is the largest and most elaborate. It is likely the one sent to {{w|William Warham}}, Archbishop of Canterbury, in England. Holbein later painted Warham after he travelled to England in 1526 in search of work, with a recommendation from Erasmus, who had once lived in England himself. Holbein's portrait of Erasmus includes a Latin couplet by the scholar, inscribed on the edge of the leaning book on the shelf, which states that Holbein would rather have a slanderer than an imitator. According to art historian Stephanie Buck, this portrait is "an idealized picture of a sensitive, highly cultivated scholar, and this was precisely how Erasmus wanted to be remembered by future generations".&lt;ref&gt;Buck, Stephanie. ''Hans Holbein''. Cologne: Könemann, 1999, {{ISBN|3829025831}}, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was formerly at [[Longford Castle]], home of the Earl of Radnor, and may be referred to by this.

The Greek and Latin words on the book translate to "The Herculean Labours of Erasmus of Rotterdam".

'''Riding Up Front''' ('''RUF'''), Inc. is a California-based [[501(c) organization|non-profit 501(c)(3)]] supporting immigrant rights founded by Wei-En Tan, Ph.D., who is an immigrant to the U.S. In March 2017, RUF launched the RUF Art Blog Project, an ongoing collection of stories from Uber, Lyft, and Taxi passengers and drivers illustrated in collaboration with artists from around the world. The art blog also collects donations to support nonprofits doing work for immigrant populations such as [[American Civil Rights Union|the ACLU]], the [[American Immigration Council]] and the [[International Rescue Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2017/03/29/immigrant-stories-riding-up-front-art-blog/|title=Stunning art blog tells the stories of immigrant cab drivers from around the world|last=Dupere|first=Katie|website=Mashable|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
Riding Up Front was originally a personal blog of Tan's that aimed to record memorable conversations she had with her [[Uber (company)|Uber]], [[Lyft]] and Taxi drivers during business trips.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/03/27/riding-up-front-art-group-features-immigration-stories-of-uber-lyft-drivers/|title="Riding up Front" art group features immigration stories of Uber, Lyft drivers|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 2016 [[United States presidential election|American elections]], Tan realized there was a growing animosity toward immigrants largely fueled by a lack of understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.citylab.com/navigator/2017/03/riding-up-front-with-immigrants-and-their-stories/520776/|title=Riding Along With Drivers' Stories|work=CityLab|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, the President Trump issued the [[Executive Order 13769|travel ban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lbpost.com/life/arts-culture/2000010579-riding-up-front-art-blog-raises-awareness-of-legal-immigrants-one-rideshare-at-a-time|title=Riding Up Front Art Blog Raises Awareness of Legal Immigrants, One Rideshare at a Time|work=Long Beach Post|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Tan and Dr. Anais Rameau, RUF Board Chair, decided to expand the personal blog into a community-driven creative project in hope to humanize immigrants in light of the current political climate,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/immigration/sd-me-immigrant-blog-20170324-story.html|title=San Diegan uses art blog to share stories of immigrants|last=Morrissey|first=Kate|work=sandiegouniontribune.com|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; both in the U.S. and worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3081">[[Image:BlakeMalkin.jpg|thumb|William Blake's frontispiece to ''A Father's Memoirs of his Child'' (1806), engraved by Cromek.]]
'''Robert Hartley Cromek''' (1770–1812) was an English engraver, editor, art dealer and entrepreneur who was most active in the early nineteenth century. He is best known for having allegedly cheated [[William Blake]] out of the potential profits of his engraving depicting Chaucer's [[Canterbury Pilgrims]].

In the early years of the nineteenth century Cromek had supported Blake, and had engraved Blake's design for [[Benjamin Heath Malkin]]'s ''A Father's Memoirs of his Child'' in 1806. Cromek later commissioned Blake to illustrate [[Robert Blair (poet)|Robert Blair]]'s poem ''The Grave''. Blake had produced the designs, but his sample engraving was considered by Cromek to be too crude to attract subscribers. Cromek then gave the lucrative job of engraving Blake's designs to a rival engraver [[Luigi Schiavonetti]].

In response, Blake proceeded to create a self-engraved illustration to Chaucer's ''Canterbury Tales''. Cromek, however, had also given the idea to Blake's friend [[Thomas Stothard]]. Stothard's print became far more popular than Blake's, at least during their lifetimes. It remains unclear whether Blake or Cromek originated this project, but Blake certainly believed that the idea was stolen from him. The incident destroyed the friendship between Blake and Stothard.&lt;ref&gt;Blake v. Cromek: A Contemporary Ruling, J. B. Mertz, ''Modern Philology'', Vol. 99, No. 1 (Aug., 2001), pp. 66-77&lt;/ref&gt;

As a savagely humorous comment on these events Blake wrote epigrams attacking Cromek:&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, Geoffrey, ''Blake: Complete Writings with variant readings'', Oxford University Press, 1972, p.540&lt;/ref&gt;   
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Cromek loves artists as he loves his meat:&lt;br&gt;
He loves the Art; but 'tis the art to cheat.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A petty sneaking knave I knew--&lt;br&gt;
"O! Mr. Cromek, how do ye do?"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1809 Cromek published ''Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song'', a collection of Scottish ballads. The aspirant poet [[Allan Cunningham (author)|Allan Cunningham]] sent in poems of his own authorship, which Cromek included in the collection, even though he may have suspected their real authorship.

About that time Cromek also compiled "RELIQUES OF ROBERT BURNS; Consisting Chiefly of Original Letters, Poems, and Critical Observations on Scottish Songs ". The original edition of 1808 contained a 4-page work by Thomas Stothard, "The Procession of Chaucer's Pilgrims to Canterbury", which did not appear in some later editions.

His son was the artist [[Thomas Hartley Cromek]].&lt;ref name=wake&gt;{{cite news|last=Fowler|first=James|title=A Biographical Notice of Thomas Hartley Cromek, Esq.|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Wakefield_Express/Thomas_Hartley_Cromek|newspaper=Wakefield Express|date=19 April 1873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stora Bollhuset 1780.jpg|thumb|The original building of the Royal Swedish Opera, [[Bollhuset]] at [[Slottsbacken]] in [[Stockholm]], during the 1780s. From right to left: [[Stockholm Palace]], [[Storkyrkan]], Bollhuset Theatre and the [[Tessin Palace]]. Drawing, [[Martin Rudolf Heland]].]]

'''Royal Swedish Opera''' ({{lang-sv|Kungliga Operan}}) is [[Sweden]]'s national stage for [[opera]] and [[ballet]].

==Location and environment==
The building is located in the center of Sweden's capital [[Stockholm]] in the borough of [[Norrmalm (borough)|Norrmalm]], on the eastern side of [[Gustav Adolfs torg, Stockholm|Gustav Adolfs torg]] across from the former [[Arvfurstens Palats]], now [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Sweden)|Ministry for Foreign Affairs]]. It lies on the north side of the Norrström river and is connected to the [[Stockholm Palace|Royal Palace]] through the [[Norrbro]] bridge.

Further historically as well as architecturally important buildings in the close neighborhood are the [[Sager House]], official residence of the [[Prime Minister of Sweden]], and the [[Riksdag building]].

==History==
The opera company was founded by King [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] and its first performance, ''Thetis and Phelée'' with [[Carl Stenborg]] and [[Elisabeth Olin]], was given on January 18, 1773; this was the first native speaking opera performed in Sweden.

But the first [[opera house]] was not opened until 1782 and served for a century before being replaced at the end of the 19th century. Both houses are officially called the "Royal Opera", however the terms "The Gustavian Opera" and "The Oscarian Opera", or the "Old" and "New" Opera are used when distinction is needed.

=== The Gustavian Opera ===
The original Stockholm Opera House, the work of architect [[Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz]] was commissioned by King [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]], a strong adherent of the ideal of an [[enlightened absolutism]] and as such was a great patron of the arts. The Swedish Opera company had first been located in [[Bollhuset]], but there was a need to separate the Opera from the theatre and give them separate buildings. Construction began in 1775 and the theatre was inaugurated on 30 September 1782 with a performance of the German composer [[Johann Gottlieb Naumann]]'s ''Cora och Alonzo''. 
It was also the place for public masquerade balls, events inspired from the famous opera-balls in Paris, which was open for everyone wearing a mask at a cheap cost and somewhat ill-reputed. 
[[Image:Operan GustavIII 1880.jpg|thumb|left|The Gustavian opera building in 1880.]]

The building was very imposing with its centre Corinthian tetrastyle portico supporting four statues and topped by the royal crown. The four-tiered auditorium was oval in shape, had excellent acoustics and sight lines. The sumptuous foyer contained neoclassic medallions and pilasters.

It was in the foyer of the opera house where the king met his fate: during a masquerade on March 16, 1792, he was shot by [[Jacob Johan Anckarström]], and died 7 days later. (In turn, this event inspired the operas ''[[Gustave III (Auber)|Gustave III]]'' by [[Daniel Auber]] and  ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]'' by [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]].) Following the assassination, the opera house was closed until 1 November 1792, when it was opened again, which by some was considered shocking. The son of Gustav III, King [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden]], did not like the Opera, possibly because of the murder of his father, and disliked the fact that the scene of his father's murder was used as a place of amusement and leisure, and when a frivolous play was performed for his queen [[Frederica of Baden]] in 1806, he decided to close it down. It remained closed until 1809, and when the king was deposed, it took until May 1812, before it was organised enough to be fully opened again.

=== The Oscarian Opera, ''Operan'' ===
[[Image:Operan 1978 4a.jpg|thumb|''Operans Guldfoajén'': The Golden Hall (with a bust of Swedish singer [[Birgit Nilsson]]) at the Royal Swedish Opera.]]
The old opera was demolished in 1892 to give way to the construction of a new Opera drawn by [[Axel Johan Anderberg]], which was finished seven years later and inaugurated by King [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]] with a production of a Swedish opera (that tradition having been quite firmly established during the 19th century), [[Franz Berwald]]'s ''[[Estrella de Soria]]''.

The new house had the letters ''Kungl. Teatern'', literally "Royal Theatre" (which caused the later-founded [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] to add the distinction "dramatic" to its name).  The building is now simply called ''Operan'' ("The Opera"), written in golden letters above the middle arch on the front facade. It is a majestic neo-classical building with a magnificent gold foyer ''(Guldfoajén)'' and elegant marble grand staircase leading to a three-tiered [[auditorium]] somewhat smaller than the old theatre. It presently seats 1,200. Most productions are now sung in the original language (with Swedish subtitles), with only a few in Swedish.

The Royal Swedish Family of King [[Carl XVI Gustaf]] keeps the Royal Box reserved, located in the first tier in the auditorium above the orchestra pit.

== Ensembles, artists and artistic leadership ==
Famous singers who originally were (or still are) part of the opera's ensemble are [[Jussi Björling]], [[Gösta Winbergh]], [[Nicolai Gedda]], [[Peter Mattei]], [[Jenny Lind]], [[Birgit Nilsson]], [[Elisabeth Söderström]], [[Anne Sofie von Otter]], [[Katarina Dalayman]] and [[Nina Stemme]].

The orchestra of the Royal Swedish Opera, the Royal Swedish Orchestra, ''[[Kungliga Hovkapellet]]'', dates back to 1526. Royal housekeeping accounts from 1526 mention twelve musicians including wind players and a timpanist but no string players. Consequently, the Royal Swedish Orchestra is one of the oldest orchestras in Europe.

[[Armas Järnefelt]] was on the music staff from 1905, rising to become chief conductor between 1923-1933 and 1938-1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Edvard Armas Järnefelt |publisher=[[Kungliga Hovkapellet]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-12-14 |url=http://www.hovkapellet.com/musiker-och-dirigenter/769/edvard-armas-jarnefelt/ |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hovkapellet.com/2011/03/24/ur-hovkapellets-fotoalbum-2/ Photo of Järnefelt] conducting the [[Kungliga Hovkapellet|Royal Swedish Orchestra]] during the Opera House's 400th anniversary celebrations (in Swedish). Retrieved 25 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Swedish Ballet]], ''Kungliga Baletten'', was founded by [[Gustav III of Sweden]] in 1773.

The current general manager of the Royal Swedish Opera is the Swedish [[mezzo-soprano]] [[Birgitta Svendén]].  In November 2011, the Dutch conductor [[Lawrence Renes]] was named the next chief conductor of the company, as of the 2012–13 season, with an initial contract through the 2016–17 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.operan.se/sv/pressrum/Press/Pressmeddelanden/Lawrence-Renes/ | title=Lawrence Renes - Ny chefdirigent på Kungliga Operan | publisher=Kungliga Operan | language=Swedish | date=30 November 2011 | accessdate=2011-12-25 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119145839/http://www.operan.se/sv/pressrum/Press/Pressmeddelanden/Lawrence-Renes/ | archivedate=19 January 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of genealogy, encouraged by the increasing use of the [[Internet]] is encouraging a number of people to mass-market what authorities regard as '''scam "genealogical books"''' which are sometimes promoted by affiliated websites. They tend to contain a general introduction, a section about the origin of surnames in general, a section about heraldry, a couple of blank charts for the purchaser to copy and complete once he has done his own research, a few recipes and (sometimes) a list of names, addresses and telephone numbers culled from the publicly available telephone directories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancestry.com/library/view/columns/eastman/3538.asp Ancestry.com - Genealogy Scams&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The books are not unique to a particular surname, are not published annually and contain no pictures of the buyer's family members. In a recent case, Jeffery Scism, a San Bernardino, California genealogist, said the fines for such practises are puny when compared with the hundreds of thousands of dollars he believes such vendors rake in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/other_business/article/0,2777,DRMN_23916_4455021,00.html Album seller settles case : More Business : The Rocky Mountain News]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109075556/http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/other_business/article/0,2777,DRMN_23916_4455021,00.html |date=January 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Those who have sold such books so far include:

The company was formed in 1974 by [[banjo]]ists [[Rick Shubb]] and [[Dave Coontz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.namm.org/library/oral-history/rick-shubb|title = Rick Shubb|date = June 20, 2010|accessdate = August 20, 2015|website = NAMM Oral History Interviews|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shubb capos remain a top-selling capo forty years after their invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shubb Capo Celebrates 40th Year: Patented Design Remains a Top Seller after Four Decades | date = February 1, 2014 |website = Music Trades, via HighBeam Research|url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-356909423.html|accessdate = 2015-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shubb wanted to create a capo that would not make his instrument go out of tune, which has resulted in ongoing efforts to refine his invention.&lt;ref name = "guitarcapo.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shubb Guitar Capo - Guitar Capos|url = http://www.theguitarcapo.com/types-of-guitarcapo/shubb-guitar-capo/|website = www.theguitarcapo.com|accessdate = 2015-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "CNNmoney"&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Rick Shubb created the perfect capo for guitars - February 1, 2007|url = http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2007/02/01/8398981/index.htm|website = [[CNNMoney]] |accessdate = 2015-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capo design==
The Shubb Capo utilises an ''over-centre'' locking action, which is lever operated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to use a Shubb style Capo - Guitar Gear|url = http://www.guitarforbeginners.com/forum/topic/20576-how-to-use-a-shubb-style-capo/|accessdate = 2015-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = US Patent # 4,250,790.

Shubb capos are available in variety of models to fit different types of guitars, [[banjo]]s, [[dobro]]s, and [[ukulele]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Guitarist's Guide to the Capo|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gaWzc3rl5WQC&amp;q=shubb#v=snippet&amp;q=shubb&amp;f=false|publisher = Artemis Music Ltd|date = 2003-07-01|isbn = 9781904411154|first = Rikky|last = Rooksby|pages = 14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forum.ukuleleunderground.com/showthread.php?61318-Shubb-L9-Lite-Uke-Capo | title = Shubb L9 Lite Uke Capo | date = February 28, 2012 | website = Ukulele Underground |access-date = August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there are ''Shubb Capos for Steel String Guitar'' which fit most acoustic and electric guitars; the ''Shubb Capos for Nylon String Guitar'' are designed for guitars with wide flat fretboards, etc. Furthermore, each model is available in different styles, namely Original (nickel-plated or plain, unplated brass), Capo Noir (black chrome) and Deluxe (stainless steel with improved roller design on the lever).&lt;ref name = "guitarcapo.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.americansongwriter.com/2009/12/6-shubb-capo/|title = #6: Shubb Capo.

The Shubb capo was introduced at the 1980 [[NAMM Show]], and became a favorite on the [[Usenet newsgroup|Usenet]] acoustic guitar newsgroup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.performing-musician.com/pm/feb09/articles/capos.htm|title = Capo-tastic!

An advantage with using this type of capo is that it does not change the [[Intonation (music)|intonation]] in a way that makes the instrument difficult to tune, as it "mimics the grip of a human hand."&lt;ref name = "guitarcapo.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "CNNmoney"/&gt; A disadvantage is that the rubber sleeve may wear, and may need to be replaced.&lt;ref name = "guitarcapo.com"/&gt;

'''''Singing All Along''''' is a 2016 Chinese television series produced by [[Ruby Lin]], starring Lin and [[Yuan Hong (actor)|Yuan Hong]]. Set in 1st-century imperial China, the drama is based on Li Xin (李歆)'s 2007–2009 romantic novel series ''Xiuli Jiangshan'' (秀丽江山) and focuses on the relationship between Liu Xiu ([[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Emperor Guangwu]]), a peasant-turned-[[Eastern Han dynasty]] founder and [[Yin Lihua]] (Empress Guanglie), the love of his life. Although the original novel involved [[time travel]], the television series does not contain those parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ent.sina.com.cn/v/m/2012-03-21/09303586070.shtml|title=林心如将投拍《秀丽江山》 删去穿越还原历史|publisher=Sina entertainment|date=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming began in October 2013 in [[Xiangshan County, Zhejiang]], China with a budget of ¥150 million (over 24 million USD).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.163.com/13/1001/09/9A3E6FLB00014Q4P.html 林心如投1.5亿拍剧]&lt;/ref&gt; The show premiered on [[Jiangsu Television]] on 21 July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ent.sina.com.cn/v/m/2016-05-12/doc-ifxsenvm0322451.shtml|title=林心如《长歌行》6月23日播 定档之路坎坷|publisher=Sina entertainment|date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
In 22 AD, the peasant brothers Liu Yan and Liu Xiu led a rebel force to overthrow the oppressive [[Xin dynasty|Xin empire]] and to restore the [[Han dynasty]]. Yin Lihua, their beautiful childhood friend, joined their fight. During the bloody battles, Liu Xiu and Yin faced death many times together before the Xin empire was finally toppled. In 23, Liu Yan was seen by the new Han emperor Liu Xuan as a threat and killed. Fearing he would be next, Liu Xiu, with the help of his new bride Yin, managed to have Liu Xuan assign him to a territory beyond Liu Xuan's reach. However, developing a power base of his own proved difficult. In 24, Liu Xiu encountered a dilemma: in order to enter a military alliance with a mighty regional warlord, he needed to marry the warlord's niece Guo Shengtong and break his vows to Yin. Meanwhile, Yin discovered that Liu Xuan also had feelings for her. When Yin finally reunited with her husband in 25, Liu Xiu was already the new emperor who had just captured the capital; with Guo, a woman he did not love, as his new wife. As the empire remained divided, naming Guo the empress seemed the ideal choice politically, but Liu Xiu's heart never left Yin. Amid power struggle, war, and intrigues, could their love survive?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8713">The following is a '''list of unproduced Stephen Norrington projects''' in roughly chronological order. During a career that has spanned over 20 years, [[Stephen Norrington]] has worked on projects which never progressed beyond the [[pre-production]] stage under his direction. Many of the films were produced after he left production.

==1990s==

===''Blade II''===
* In 1999, Norrington was offered to direct ''[[Blade II]]'', the sequel to his [[Blade (film)|1998]] film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael Fleming|title=Helmer scales mountains|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117864489.html|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=March 25, 2002|accessdate=2008-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ellen Wolff|title=Artists flaunt character development at confab|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117870028.html|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=July 21, 2002|accessdate=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He turned it down, resulting in the studio hiring [[Guillermo del Toro]] to replace him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blade_2_bloodhunt/|title=Blade 2 Movie Reviews, Pictures|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=2011-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2000s==

===''Ghost Rider''===
* In 2001, Norrington was originally attached to [[Dimension Films]]'s ''[[Ghost Rider (2007 film)|Ghost Rider]]'' before the project was acquired by [[Columbia Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18676|title=WWII Backdrop, Monsters and 'The Lost Patrol'|publisher=BloodyDisgusting}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Michael|first=Fleming|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117785776.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1|title='Ghost' adds a Dimension|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|date=2000-08-30|accessdate=2006-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was eventually released in 2007 directed by [[Mark Steven Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harris|first=Dana|url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=story&amp;articleid=VR1117884327&amp;categoryid=13&amp;cs=1|title=Johnson sees 'Ghost'|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|date=2003-04-08|accessdate=2006-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Hands of Shang-Chi''===
* In 2001, Norrington announced that he had agreed to direct a film based on ''The Hands of Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu'', a film adaptation based on the Marvel character ''[[:w:c:marvel:Shang-Chi|Shang-Chi]]''. Norrington described the film as "a real honest-to-goodness martial arts film, rather than a film that simply has martial arts in it". In 2004, it was announced that [[Ang Lee]] had been brought on as producer. In 2005, it was announced that Stan Lee had agreed to executive produce the film for DreamWorks, with Yuen Woo-ping directing from a Bruce McKenna screenplay.&lt;ref name="leechiback"&gt;[http://blog.moviefone.com/2006/02/27/ang-lees-shang-chi-movie-is-back/ Ang Lee's Shang-Chi movie is back]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Avi Arad]] stated that he thought that a PG-13 adaptation was possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/shared/movies/interviews/a/arad_avi_062005/ Future Shocks: What's Ahead For Avi Arad and his Marvel empire?]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Ang Lee confirmed his and Yuen's continued involvement with the project.&lt;ref name="leechiback" /&gt; However, no further developments have been announced to date.

===''Akira'' remake===
* Shortly after Warner Bros. acquired the rights in 2002, Stephen Norrington was slated to direct a remake to the 1988 film ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', with [[James Robinson (writer)|James Robinson]] writing the screenplay and [[Dan Lin]] producing.&lt;ref name="ign la 2017"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/06/akira-the-tortured-history-of-the-unmade-live-action-adaptation | title = Akira: The Tortured History of he Unmade Live-Action Adaptation | first = Christopher | last = Marc | date = April 6, 2017 | accessdate = August 31, 2017 | work = [[IGN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/04/12/akira-hollywood-remake]&lt;/ref&gt; Norrington had planned to make the remake more appealing to Western audiences, making Kaneda and Tetsuo brothers. Following the commercial failure of ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' in 2003, which both Norrington and Robinson were also on, the project was put on hold.&lt;ref name="ign la 2017"/&gt;

===''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'' (sequel and reboot)===
* In 2003, Norrington's ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' was intended to spawn a [[Media franchise|film franchise]] based on further titles in the original comic book series, but there was little enthusiasm for a sequel due to performing poorly at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2003/TLOEG.php|title=The Numbers: Box Office Data|publisher=|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sequel was scrapped, ''The Tracking Board'' reported, on May 26, 2015, that 20th Century Fox and [[Davis Entertainment]] had agreed to develop a reboot with hopes of launching a new franchise. The report stated that a search was underway for a director who could help "continue to develop the reboot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tracking-board.com/tb-exclusive-fox-enters-development-on-a-reboot-of-the-league-of-extraordinary-gentlemen/|title={TB EXCLUSIVE} Fox Enters Development on "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" Reboot – The Tracking Board|work=The Tracking Board}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Davis (producer)|John Davis]] told Collider in an interview that the reboot will be a female-centric film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/league-of-extraordinary-gentlemen-reboot-female-centric/|title='League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' Reboot to Be Female-Centric|publisher=Collider|last=Goldberg|first=Matt|date=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, there has not been any further announcements, falling into development hell.

===''Clash of the Titans'' (2010)===
* In 2007, Norrington was originally set to direct the remake of the 1981 fantasy film ''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]''. However, Norrington was unsure about his direction for the project because he did not grow up with the original. [[Louis Leterrier]], who did, contacted Norrington through their shared agent about replacing him. Leterrier's film was released in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Crow To Fly Again: LXG's Norrington to write, direct|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=23871|date=15 December 2008|accessdate=13 January 2009|publisher=Empire Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Fleming, Michael |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117977672.html?categoryid=1238&amp;cs=1 |title=Norrington to direct ''Titans'' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Stowarzyszenie Pisarzy Polskich''''' is a [[Poland|Polish]] Writers' Association, an organization of Polish [[writer]]s, [[poet]]s, [[playwright]]s, critics and [[translator]]s. SPP, established in 1989 is a continuation of the Professional Union of Polish Writers, founded in 1920 on the initiative of [[Stefan Żeromski]] which was deactivated during [[World War II]].

The foundation of the association was possible due to the [[collapse of communism|historical and political transformations]], which took place in 1989 in Poland. The majority of the most prominent and influential writers and former members of the [[Polish Writers' Union]] officially joined the organization, which was formed in 1984, and because of the decision of the [[communism in Poland|communist]] authorities, remained illegal up until 1989. [[Czesław Miłosz]] became the first formal member of the new institution.

The headquarters of Stowarzyszenie Pisarzy Polskich is located in the House of Literature at [[Krakowskie Przedmieście]] 87/89 in [[Warsaw]]. At present, the association has got 11 major branches located in the following cities: [[Warsaw]], [[Lublin]], [[Katowice]], [[Kraków]], [[Wrocław]], [[Szczecin]], [[Gdańsk]], [[Bydgoszcz]], [[Łódź]], [[Olsztyn]] and [[Poznań]].

== Plot ==
Seyolo Zantoko has just completed his degree at a French medical school; he was the only African male in his class and circle of friends. After completing his medical degree, he turns down employment in [[Zaire]] as the personal physician to the president, [[Joseph-Desiré Mobutu]], as he wishes to avoid the corruption associated with his country. Instead, he is hired by the mayor of a small village, [[Marly-Gomont]] in the north of France. He, his wife Anne and their two children, Sivi and Kamini, are disappointed to learn that they are living in a rural village, far from the excitement of [[Paris]]. His decision to live in France is mainly driven by the hope of a better education for his children, but he also hopes to apply for [[French nationality law|French citizenship]]. Seyolo and his family struggle to adapt to the new life as the locals - unfamiliar with African professionals - fear the newcomers, the children are bullied at school and Seyolo's practice struggles to survive, as the locals prefer to drive to the next village whenever they need a doctor, instead of being visited by a "sorcerer". Seyolo and Anne have a heated argument in front of relatives who have come for a visit, during which Seyolo reluctantly promises that they will eventually move to [[Brussels]], where some of their relatives live. However, Seyolo and his family eventually win the villagers' trust, and his practice becomes a success after he delivers the baby of a local farmer.

Following Seyolo's rise in reputation and popularity, he tells the mayor that he wants to stay in Marly-Gomont for the long term. The same evening, the mayor and his wife go to the Zantokos' house for dinner, and the mayor mentions his happiness that Seyolo is staying in the village. Anne is shocked and angry at this revelation, as Seyolo had promised that they would move to Brussels and had not told Anne that he had accepted the mayor's request to stay in Marly-Gomont. Anne leaves to stay in Brussels with the extended family, and the couple's relationship is in jeopardy.

Meanwhile, in Marly-Gomont, Seyolo is arrested by the French police for immigration irregularities, days before his application for French citizenship is due to be approved, and he is forced to stop working. Anne eventually returns and agrees to stay with Seyolo in Marly-Gomont. The only hope for Seyolo and his family is that the current mayor be re-elected, although his opponent, Lavigne, is currently leading the polls and is determined to stop Seyolo from practising in the village, preferring instead to hire a doctor of French origin. However, Sivi is discovered to be a talented soccer player and wins the hearts of the community by single-handedly helping the local team to progress in the league. Seyolo and his children hatch a plan to show the villagers that if Lavigne wins the election, the family will have to leave Marly-Gomont. The villagers, upset at the prospect of losing their best soccer player, turn out to vote, and the incumbent mayor is re-elected. Finally, the children at the local school perform a play that re-enacts the arrival, and eventual acceptance, of Seyolo and his family, and they realise that they are loved by the whole community (except Lavigne, who leaves before the end of the show). Seyolo's practice reopens and the family remains in Marly-Gomont.

==Plot synopsis==
A young woman named Marusia goes to a feast where she meets a kind, handsome and apparently wealthy man. They fall in love with each other and Marusia agrees to marry him. She also consents to her mother's directive that she follow the boy to discover where he lives and more about him. She follows him to the church where she sees him eating a corpse. Later the fiend asks her if she saw him at the church. When Marusia denies having followed him, he tells her that her father will die the next day. Thereafter, he continually poses the question and with each denial he causes another of her family members to die. Finally he tells her that she herself will die. At this point Marusia asks her grandmother what to do. Her grandmother explains a way by which Marusia can come back to life after she dies (a condition of which is that she cannot enter a church afterwards). On coming back to life she meets a good man whom she marries, however he does not like the fact that she will not go to church and eventually forces her to do so. Thus the Fiend discovers that she is alive and kills her husband and her son, but with the help of her grandmother, the [[Fountain of Youth|water of life]], and [[holy water]] she brings them back and kills the fiend.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6646">'''Vexillography''' is the art and practice of designing flags; it is allied with [[vexillology]], the scholarly study of flags, but is not synonymous with that discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Whitney. Flag Bulletin XL:202(2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  A person who designs flags is a vexillographer.

==Principles of flag design==
Flag designs exhibit a number of regularities, arising from a variety of practical concerns, historical circumstances, and cultural prescriptions that have shaped and continue to shape their evolution.

Vexillographers face the necessity for the design to be manufactured (and often [[Mass production|mass-produced]]) into or onto a piece of cloth, which will subsequently be hoisted aloft in the outdoors to represent an organization, individual, idea, or group. In this respect, flag design departs considerably from [[logo]] design: logos are predominantly still images suitable for reading off a page, screen, or billboard; while flags are alternately draped and fluttering images - visible from a variety of distances and angles (including the reverse). The prevalence of simple bold colors and shapes in flag design attests to these practical issues.

Flag design has a history, and new designs often refer back to previous designs, effectively quoting, elaborating, or commenting upon them. Families of current flags may derive from a few common ancestors - as in the cases of the [[Pan-African colours]], the [[Pan-Arab colors]], the [[Pan-Slavic colors]], the [[Nordic Cross flag]] and the [[Ottoman flag]].

Certain cultures prescribe the proper design of their own flags, through [[Heraldry|heraldic]] or other authoritative systems. Prescription may be based on religious principles: see, for example, [[Islamic flags]]. Vexillographers have begun to articulate design principles, such as those jointly published by the [[North American Vexillological Association]] and the [[Flag Institute]] in their ''Guiding Principles of Flag Design,''&lt;ref name="navaDesign"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nava.org/flag-design/ |title=Flag Design |publisher=North American Vexillological Association / Association nord-américaine de vexillologie |accessdate=2016-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides the following basic principles:

# "When designing a flag remember that it will fly in the wind and is not just a rectangular design on paper - so think what the flag will look like when flying in a brisk breeze and when hanging down on a still day."
# "Simplicity is important in creating a design that is easy to recognize and simple to reproduce. Try re-drawing the design freehand to see whether an imperfect drawing of the flag can still be easily identified. Also try imagining it at a small size, such as a lapel pin, or when viewed from a distance, when small details will not be obvious."
# "A flag needs to be distinctive to stop it being mistaken for another. Compare it to neighboring and similar flags to check that they are not easily confused."
# "If you want a flag to remain popular for a long time, it should look as “timeless” as possible, to make it immune to changing fashions. Avoid using features in the design that will cause the flag to become dated or obsolete, e.g., a reference to farming could be timeless but depicting a particular style of tractor will date very quickly. Imagine the flag in a historic setting and in a very modern setting to check whether it would work in both."
