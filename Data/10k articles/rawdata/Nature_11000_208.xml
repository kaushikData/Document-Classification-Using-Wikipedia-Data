'''Anka Vassileva Lambreva''' ({{lang-bg|Анка Василева Ламбрева}}) (22 February 1895 – 18 February 1976) was a [[Bulgaria]]n nurse, teacher and adventurer. She became the first Bulgarian woman to fly across the [[English Channel]] and circumnavigate the world.

Anka was born in [[Karlovo]], [[Bulgaria]] in a poor family of five children. Her father was unable to support her however she managed to graduate a high school in [[Plovdiv]] while working as a maid. For a year and a half she studied medicine and worked as a clerk in an insurance company in [[Sofia]] to support herself, but both her parents dies and she was forced to move back to Karlovo and started a job as a teacher.

In 1922 Anka won a scholarship for the American College in [[Istanbul]], where she studied nursing and interned at a local hospital. Over the next six years she worked at a hospital near the [[Bosphorus]] and saved the lives of several people, including a baby.

[[File:Anka Lambreva first voyage.png|thumb|Anka Lambreva's first round the world trip]]
Her first round the world trip began in March 1928 when she left [[Istanbul]] and boarded a steamship to [[Dunedin]], New Zealand where she also worked as a nurse. During the three-month journey Anka explored [[Egypt]], India, [[Ceylon]] and Australia. In 1929 she left New Zealand and headed back to Bulgaria passing through [[Tasmania]], [[Tahiti]], [[Fiji]], [[Samoa]], Canada, United States, [[England]], France and Germany.

An '''auroral chorus''' is a series of [[electromagnetic wave]]s at frequencies which resemble chirps, whistles, and quasi-musical sounds in predominantly rising tones when played as pressure waves (sound), which are created by [[geomagnetic storm]]s also responsible for the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]]s.  &lt;!-- The sounds last approximately 0.1-1.0 seconds. Other auroral sounds includes hissing, swishing, rustling and cracking.  --&gt;
The electromagnetic waves are a type of [[Extremely low frequency#Natural sources|natural radio waves]], vibrations of electric and magnetic energy occurring at the same frequency as sound.

==Experiencing/Detecting==
Auroral chorus can be detected primarily around the magnetic equator, specifically in two distinct frequency bands, one above the equatorial half gyro-frequency and one below it. The gyro-frequency ranges from 0.6&amp;nbsp;kHz to about 1.6&amp;nbsp;kHz. Distinguishable on high resolution wideband spectrographs, the wave amplitude grows linearly then switches to non-linear. Demonstrating a peak distribution near dawn, the auroral chorus is most detectable via [[Extremely low frequency|ELF]]/[[VLF]] Radio receivers in the middle latitude around 30-60 degrees N. The most numerous recordings of the auroral chorus has been by the Iowa Plasma Wave Group. [http://www-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/plasma-wave/istp/polar/home.html] They have released many audio interpretations of chorus recordings online along with spectrograph measurements. &lt;!-- Historically, the sounds have been associated with spiritual events by [[Inuit]] in Canada who regularly experienced auroral chorus on cold, windless nights. --&gt;

&lt;!-- ==Explaining/Understanding==
The specific nature and source of the auroral chorus is a continuing question in space and atmospheric research.  Cluster satellite observations suggest that the sounds are seemingly generated by numerous sources in rapid motion. 
Studies have shown a definite correlation on/off with fluctuations of solar wind and southward turning of IMF (which is correlated with aurora).  The strength of noise correlates with strength of geomagnetic activity in the Earth's [[ionosphere]]. Other studies show a clear correlation peak at upper infrasound range (less than 20 Hz).  A delay between the peak of auroral sounds and the peak of electromagnetic activity, corresponds to the [[speed of sound]] as if it were traveling from the auroral heights (80–100&amp;nbsp;km) to the Earth's surface.  However, local [[electric field]] signals do not correlate well with sound signals. 
Some believe that it is probable that the auroral chorus doesn't originate at the point of aurorae but rather is transformed from slight wave ripples in the air into audible sound waves by objects closer to the observer.  There remains a question of whether real sound waves exist or if somehow [[electromagnetic energy|electromagnetic waves]] just play tricks on our ears.

{{Hatnote|For the biblical Mount Horeb, see [[Mount Horeb]].}}
[[File:The Ten Commandments (Bible Card).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mass-revelation at Mount Sinai in an illustration from a Bible card published by the Providence Lithograph Company, 1907]]
According to the [[Book of Exodus]], '''Mount Sinai''' ([[Hebrew]]: הר סיני, ''Har Sinai'') is the mountain at which the [[Ten Commandments]] were given to [[Moses]] by [[Tetragrammaton|God]]. In the [[Book of Deuteronomy]], these events are described as having transpired at [[Mount Horeb]]. "Sinai" and "Horeb" are generally considered to refer to the same place by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Michael David. ''The Old Testament: A Historical and Literary Introduction to the Hebrew Scriptures''. Oxford University Press, USA, 2017: pg. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hebrew Bible]] texts describe the [[theophany]] at Mount Sinai in terms which a minority of scholars, following [[Charles Beke]] (1873), have suggested may literally describe the mountain as a volcano and have led to a search for alternative locations.&lt;ref&gt;James K. Hoffmeier (2005). ''Ancient Israel in Sinai'' {{ISBN|0198035403}} p. 131. "Now that Rameses is known to be located at Qantir in the Sharkiya province of the east Delta, this means that Beke's proposed site of ... Hermann Gunkel, Hugo Gressman, Martin Noth and Jean Koenig. They all thought that the biblical descriptions of the theophany at Mt. Sinai described volcanic activity, and since there was no evidence of volcanoes in Sinai, that northern Arabia was the more likely."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:Aus der SinaiWueste - Eugen Bracht.jpg|thumb|right|upright|200px|''Out of the Sinai desert'', painting by [[Eugen Bracht]], c. 1880]]
According to the [[Documentary hypothesis]], the name "Sinai" is only used in the [[Torah]] by the [[Jahwist]] and [[Priestly source]], whereas ''Horeb'' is only used by the [[Elohist]] and [[Deuteronomist]].&lt;ref name=hastings&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Harris |first=J. Rendel |author=|authorlink=J. Rendel Harris|editor=[[James Hastings]] |encyclopedia=[[Hastings' Dictionary of the Bible|A Dictionary of the Bible]] |title=Sinai, Mount |url= |accessdate= |edition= |year= 1902|publisher= |volume= |location= |id= |isbn= |doi= |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horeb is thought to mean "glowing/heat", which seems to be a reference to the [[sun]], while ''Sinai'' may have derived from the name of ''[[Sin (mythology)|Sin]]'', the [[Sumer]]ian deity of the [[moon]],&lt;ref name=JE&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=|first=|author= Joseph Jacobs|authorlink=Joseph Jacobs |author2=[[M. Seligsohn]] |author3=[[Wilhelm Bacher]] |editor= |encyclopedia=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]] |title=Mount Horeb |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=817&amp;letter=S&amp;search=horeb |accessdate= |date=1906|edition= |publisher= |volume= |location= |id= |isbn= |doi= |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Peake&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= |first= |author=D. M. G. Stalker |authorlink= |editor= Matthew Black and H. H. Rowley|encyclopedia=[[Peake's Commentary on the Bible]] |title=Exodus |url= |accessdate= |edition=second |year= 1963|publisher= Thomas Nelson|volume= |location= |isbn= |doi= |id= section 178c|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus Sinai and Horeb would be the mountains of the moon and sun, respectively.

Regarding the Sumerian ''Sin'' deity assumption, [[William F. Albright]], an American biblical scholar, had stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = William Foxwell Albright |title = From Stone Age to Christianity | publisher = Doubleday Anchor Book | year = 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...there is nothing that requires us to explain Him as a modified moon-god. It is improbable that the name ''Sinai'' is derived from that of the Sumerian ''Zen'' (older ''Zu-en''), Akkadian ''Sin'', the moon-god worshiped at Ur (in his form Nannar) and at Harran, since there is no indication that the name ''Sin'' was ever employed by the Canaanites or the Semitic nomads of Palestine.

It is much more likely that the name ''Sinai'' is connected with the place-name ''Sin'', which belongs to a desert plain in Sinai as well as to a Canaanite city in Syria and perhaps to a city in the northeast Delta of Egypt. It has also been recognized that it may somehow be connected with ''seneh'' (Aram. ''sanya''), the name of a kind of bush where Moses is said to have first witnessed the theophany of Yahweh.}}

According to [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinic]] tradition, the name "Sinai" derives from ''sin-ah'' ({{lang|he|שִׂנְאָה}}), meaning ''hatred'', in reference to the other nations hating the [[Judaism|Jews]] out of jealousy, due to the Jews being the ones to receive the word of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breslov.org/land/land_49.html|title=Breslov – Judaism with Heart|author=|date=|website=breslov.org|accessdate=19 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923194449/http://www.breslov.org/land/land_49.html|archive-date=2015-09-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other names==
Classical [[rabbinic literature]] mentions the mountain having other names:
* ''Har HaElohim'' ({{lang|he|הר האלהים}}), meaning "the mountain of God" or "the mountain of the gods"&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;
* ''Har Bashan'' ({{lang|he|הר בשן}}), meaning "the mountain of [[Bashan]]"; however, ''Bashan'' is interpreted in rabbinical literature as here being a corruption of ''beshen'', meaning "with the teeth", and argued to refer to the sustenance of mankind through the virtue of the mountain&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;
* ''Har Gebnunim'' ({{lang|he|הר גבנונים}}), meaning "the mountain as pure as [[goat cheese]]"&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;
* ''Har Horeb'' ({{lang|he|הר חורב}}), see [[Mount Horeb]]
Also:
* ''Tūr Sīnāʾ / Tūr Sīnīn'' ({{lang|ar|طور سيناء / سينين}}), is the term that appears in most Islamic sources, including the [[Quran]], and it means, "The mount of Sinai".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JXwOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PR95&amp;dq=%22koh-e-toor%22|title=Qanoon-e-Islam: Or, The Customs of the Moosulmans of India; Comprising a Full and Exact Account of Their Various Rites and Ceremonies, from the Moment of Birth Till the Hour of Death|first=Jaʻfar|last=Sharīf|date=19 March 2018|publisher=Parbury, Allen, and Company|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ejkFAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22koh-e-toor%22&amp;dq=%22koh-e-toor%22&amp;lr=|title=The World is My Village: A Novel with an Index|first=Khwaja Ahmad|last=Abbas|date=19 March 1984|publisher=Ajanta Publications|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008%5C11%5C30%5Cstory_30-11-2008_pg12_12|title=Daily Times|author=|date=|website=Daily Times|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Jabal Mūsa'' ({{lang|ar|جبل موسى}}), is another term that appears in Islamic sources, and it means, "The Mountain of Moses".&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;

==Biblical description==
[[File:David Roberts The approach to Mount Sinai.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Mount Sinai'', showing the approach to Mount Sinai, 1839 painting by [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]]]]
According to the biblical account of the giving of the instructions and teachings of both the [[Torah|Written]] and the [[Oral Torah]], Sinai was enveloped in a cloud,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Bibleref2|Exodus|19:16}}&lt;/ref&gt; it quaked and was filled with smoke,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Exodus|19:18}}&lt;/ref&gt; while lightning-flashes shot forth, and the roar of thunder mingled with the blasts of a trumpet;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; the account later adds that fire was seen burning at the summit of the mountain.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{bibleref2|Exodus|24:17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the biblical account, the fire and clouds are a direct consequence of the arrival of [[Yahweh|God]] upon the mountain.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;{{Bibleref2|Exodus|19:20}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the biblical story, Moses departed to the mountain and stayed there for 40 days and nights in order to receive the Ten Commandments, the [[Torah|Written]] and the [[Oral Torah]], and he did so twice because he broke the first set of the [[tablets of stone]] after returning from the mountain for the first time.

The biblical description of God's descent&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt; seems to be in conflict with the statement shortly after that God spoke to the Israelites from [[Heaven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Exodus|20:22}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Biblical criticism|biblical scholars]] argue that these passages are from different sources, the ''[[Mekhilta]]'' argues that God had lowered the heavens and spread them over Sinai,&lt;ref&gt;Mekhilta on Exodus 20:22, 4&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer]]'' argues that a hole was torn in the heavens, and Sinai was torn away from the earth and the summit pushed through the hole. 'The heavens' could be a metaphor for clouds and the 'lake of fire' could be a metaphor for the lava-filled crater.&lt;ref&gt;Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer, 41&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[Biblical criticism|bible critics]]{{Who|date=August 2017}} have indicated that the smoke and fire reference from the Bible suggests that Mt Sinai was a [[volcano]];&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;''[[Peake's commentary on the Bible]]''&lt;/ref&gt; despite the absence of ash.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Peake's commentary on the Bible&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Biblical scholarship|bible scholars]] have suggested that the description fits a storm&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; especially as the [[Deborah#The Song of Deborah|Song of Deborah]] seems to allude to rain having occurred at the time.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{bibleverse||Judges|5:4–5|}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the biblical account, God spoke directly to the Israelite nation as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Exodus|20:15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Deutronomy|4:10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical views==
Some modern biblical scholars explain Mount Sinai as having been a sacred place dedicated to one of the Semitic deities, even before the Israelites encountered it.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; Others regard the set of laws given on the mountain to have originated in different time periods from one another, with the later ones mainly being the result of natural evolution over the centuries of the earlier ones, rather than all originating from a single moment in time.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;Cheyne and Black, ''[[Encyclopedia Biblica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suggested locations==
Modern scholars differ as to the exact geographical position of Mount Sinai,&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; and the same has long been true of scholars of Judaism. The [[Elijah]] narrative appears to suggest that when it was written, the location of ''Horeb'' was still known with some certainty, as Elijah is described as travelling to Horeb on one occasion,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|19:8|}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there are no later biblical references to it that suggest the location remained known; [[Josephus]] only specifies that it was within [[Arabia Petraea]] (a Roman Province encompassing modern [[Jordan]], southern modern [[Syria]], the Sinai Peninsula and northwestern [[Saudi Arabia]] with its capital in [[Petra]]), and the [[Pauline Epistles]] are even more vague, specifying only that it was in [[Arabia]], which covers most of the south-western [[Middle east]].

===Sinai Peninsula===
[[File:Sinai-peninsula-map.jpg|thumb|Map of the Sinai Peninsula with country borders shown]]
[[File:Katharinenkloster Sinai BW 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Saint Catherine's Monastery]]]]
The earliest references to [[Mount Sinai|Jebel Musa]] as Mount Sinai or Mount Sinai being located in the present day Sinai Peninsula are inconclusive. There is evidence that prior to 100 CE, well before the Christian monastic period, Jewish sages equated Jebel Musa with Mount Sinai. Graham Davies of Cambridge University argues that early Jewish pilgrimages identified Jebel Musa as Mount Sinai and this identification was later adopted by the Christian pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Wilderness (1979) pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Mount Sinai'', Joseph J. Hobbs, University of Texas Press, Feb 19, 2014. Social Science&lt;/ref&gt; R. K. Harrison states that, “Jebel Musa . . . seems to have enjoyed special sanctity long before Christian times, culminating in its identification with Mt. Sinai."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bible Encyclopedia, R. K. Harrison; J. K. Hoffmeier&lt;/ref&gt; In the second and third centuries BCE [[Nabataeans]] were making pilgrimages there, which is indicated in part by inscriptions discovered in the area.&lt;ref&gt;''Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament'', Volume 10, edited by G. Johannes Botterweck, Helmer Ringgren, Heinz-Josef Fabry, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

Josephus wrote that "Moses went up to a mountain that lay between Egypt and Arabia, which was called Sinai." Josephus says that Sinai is "the highest of all the mountains thereabout," and is "the highest of all the mountains that are in that country, and is not only very difficult to be ascended by men, on account of its vast altitude but because of the sharpness of its precipices".&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, Flavius, The Antiquities of the Jews II, xii, 1; III, v, 1&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional Mount Sinai, located in the Sinai Peninsula, is actually the name of a collection of peaks, sometimes referred to as the Holy Mountain peaks &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/mountsinai.htm#ixzz2vZeRh9hD |title=Mount Sinai (and the Peak of Mount Musa or Mousa) |publisher=Touregypt.net |accessdate=2014-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Landscapes of Interesting Localities Mentioned in the Holy Scriptures'',  John Marius Wilson, Edward Francis Finden, William Finden, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; which consist of Jebel Musa, [[Mount Catherine]] and Ras Sufsafeh.

Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Ewald, W. R. Smith, Sayce, Burney, see next reference for detail.&lt;/ref&gt; believe that Mount Sinai was of ancient sanctity prior to the ascent of Moses described in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Ewald, Hist. ii. 43, 45, 103; Di.; W. R. Smith, Rel. Sem.2 p. 117 f.; Sayce, EHH.188; DB. iv. 536b; Burney, Journ. of Theol. Studies, ix. (1908), p. 343 f.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have theorized that Sinai in part derived its name from the word for moon which was "sin" (meaning "the moon" or "to shine").&lt;ref name="The Encyclopædia Britannica pg. 139"&gt;The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts &amp; Sciences, edited by Hugh Chisholm Volume 25, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antoninus Martyr]] provides some support for the ancient sanctity of Jebel Musa by writing that Arabian heathens were still celebrating moon feasts there in the 6th century.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopædia Britannica pg. 139"/&gt; Lina Eckenstien states that some of the artifacts discovered indicate that "the establishment of the moon-cult in the peninsula dates back to the pre-dynastic days of Egypt."&lt;ref name="Sinai, Eckenstien P.C"&gt;''A History of Sina''i, Eckenstien, Lina, London S.P.C.K., p. 13, 1921&lt;/ref&gt; She says the main center of moon worship seems to have been concentrated in the southern Sinai peninsula which the Egyptians seized from the Semitic people who had built shrines and mining camps there.&lt;ref name="Sinai, Eckenstien P.C"/&gt; Robinson says that inscriptions with pictures of moon worship objects are found all over the southern peninsula but are missing on Jebel Musa and Mount Catherine.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Robinson’s Biblical Researches, vol. i., p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; This oddity may suggest religious cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Nation; Containing an Account of Their Manners and Customs and Rites'', Ulan Press, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Deut. 12: 2–3, II Chron. 34:3–7 and Exodus 32:20&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups of ''[[nawamis]]'' have been discovered in southern Sinai, creating a kind of ring around Jebel Musa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centre4sinai.com.eg/nawamis.htm |title=Centre 4 Sinai |publisher=Centre 4 Sinai |accessdate=2014-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''nawamis'' were used over and over throughout the centuries for various purposes. [[Egeria (pilgrim)|Etheria]], circa the 4th/5th century CE, noted that her guides, who were the local "holy men", pointed out these round or circular stone foundations of temporary huts, claiming the children of Israel used them during their stay there.&lt;ref&gt;p. 57.

The southern Sinai Peninsula contains archaeological discoveries but to place them with the exodus from Egypt is a daunting task inasmuch as the proposed dates of the Exodus vary so widely. The Exodus has been dated from the Early Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age II.&lt;ref&gt;Bimson, John J., Livingston, David. “Redating the Exodus.” ''Biblical Archaeology Review'', Sep/Oct 1987, 40–48, 51–53, 66–68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rendsburg, Gary A., ''The Bible and the Ancient Near East''. p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptian pottery in the southern Sinai during the Late Bronze and Early Iron I (Ramesside) periods has been discovered at the mining camps of Serabit el-Khadim and Timna. Objects which bore [[Proto-Sinaitic script|Proto-Sinaitic]] inscriptions, the same as those found in Canaan, were discovered at Serabit el Khadim in the Southern Sinai. Several of these were dated in the later Bronze Age.&lt;ref&gt;pp.63–65. Itzhaq Beit-Arieh. "Canaanites and Egyptians At Serabit el-Khadim." Anson F. Rainey, editor.

Beno Rothenberg. God's Wilderness, Discoveries in Sinai. New York. Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons.1961, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward Robinson insisted that the Plain of ar-Raaha adjacent to Jebel Musa could have accommodated the Israelites. Edward Hull stated that, "this traditional Sinai in every way meets the requirements of the narrative of the Exodus." Hull agreed with Robinson and stated he had no further doubts after studying the great amphitheater leading to the base of the granite cliff of Ras Sufsafeh, that here indeed was the location of the camp and the mount from which the laws of God was delivered to the encampment of Israelites below.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

F. W. Holland stated (Recovery of Jerusalem, 524): "With regard to water-supply there is no other spot in the whole Peninsula which is nearly so well supplied as the neighborhood of Jebel Musa. ... There is also no other district in the Peninsula which affords such excellent pasturage."
&lt;ref name="bibleatlas.org"/&gt;

Calculating the travels of the Israelites, the Bible Atlas states, "These distances will not, however, allow of our placing Sinai farther East than Jebel Musa."&lt;ref name="bibleatlas.org"/&gt;

Some point to the absence of material evidence left behind in the journey of the Israelites but Dr. Beit-Arieh wrote, "Perhaps it will be argued, by those who subscribe to the traditional account in the Bible, that the Israelite material culture was only of the flimsiest kind and left no trace. Presumably the Israelite dwellings and artifacts consisted only of perishable materials." &lt;ref&gt;Beit-Arieh 1988: 37&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffmeier wrote, "None of the encampments of the wilderness wanderings can be meaningful if the Israelites went directly to either Kadesh or Midian ... a journey of eleven days from Kadesh to Horeb can be properly understood only in relationship to the southern portion of the Sinai Peninsula."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Local Bedouins who have long inhabited the area have identified Jebel Musa as Mount Sinai. In the fourth century CE small settlements of monks set up places of worship around Jebel Musa. An Egyptian pilgrim named [[Ammonius the Hermit|Ammonius]], who had in past times made various visits to the area, identified Jebel Musa as the Holy Mount in the 4th century. [[Helena (empress)|Empress Helena]], ca. 330 CE, built a church to protect monks against raids from nomads. She chose the site for the church from the identification which had been handed down through generations through the Bedouins. She also reported the site was confirmed to her in a dream.&lt;ref&gt;Lina Eckenstein, A History of Sinai (London &amp; New York, 1921 [AMS Press, New York, 1980 reprint]) pp. 99 fn. 1, 178–79; James Bentley, Secrets of Mount Sinai (Doubleday, New York, 1986 [Orbis, London, 1985]) p. 58; [[Edith Deen]], Great Women of the Christian Faith (Harper &amp; Row, New York, 1959 [Barbour &amp; Co., Westwood, N.J., reprint]) pp. 7–10&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sinai peninsula]] has traditionally been considered Sinai's location by Christians, although the peninsula gained its name from this tradition, and was not called that in [[Josephus]]' time or earlier.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; (The Sinai was earlier inhabited by the Monitu and was called ''Mafkat'' or ''Country of Turquoise''.) In early Christian times, a number of [[Anchorites]] settled on [[Mount Serbal]], considering it to be the biblical mountain, and in the 4th century a monastery was constructed at its base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14011a.htm|publisher=New Advent, The Catholic Encyclopedia|title=Sinai}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Josephus had stated that Mount Sinai was "the highest of all the mountains thereabout",&lt;ref&gt;[[Flavius Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', 2:12&lt;/ref&gt; which would imply that [[Mount Catherine]] was actually the mountain in question, if Sinai was to be sited on the Sinai peninsula at all.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; In the 6th century, [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] was constructed at the base of this mountain at a site which is claimed to be the site of the biblical [[burning bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinaimonastery.com/index.php/en/|title=Home|author=|date=|website=www.sinaimonastery.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike these Christian traditions, [[Bedouin]] tradition considered [[Jabal Musa]], which lies adjacent to Mount Catherine, to be the biblical mountain,&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; and it is this mountain that local tour groups and religious groups presently advertise as ''the'' biblical Mount Sinai. Evidently this view was eventually taken up by Christian groups as well, as in the 16th century a church was constructed at the peak of this mountain, which was replaced by a Greek Orthodox chapel in 1954.

According to textual scholars, in the [[JE]] version of the Exodus narrative, the Israelites travel in a roughly straight line to [[Kadesh Barnea]] from the ''[[Yam Suph]]'' (literally meaning "the [[Reed Sea]]", but considered traditionally to refer to the [[Red sea]]), and the detour via the south of the Sinai peninsula is only present in the [[Priestly Source]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Elliott Friedman]], ''Who wrote the Bible?''&lt;/ref&gt; A number of scholars and commentators have therefore looked towards the more central and northern parts of the Sinai peninsula for the mountain. [[Mount Sin Bishar]], in the west-central part of the peninsula, was proposed to be the biblical Mount Sinai by Menashe Har-El, a biblical [[geographer]] at [[Tel Aviv University]].&lt;ref&gt;Menashe Har-El, ''The Sinai Journeys: The Route of the Exodus''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mount Helal]], in the north of the peninsula has also been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Jarvis |first=C.S. |title=The forty years' wandering of the Israelites |journal=Palestine Exploration Quarterly |year=1938 |pages=25–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |chapter=Kadesh Barnea: Some geographical and historical remarks |last=de Geus |first=C.H.J. |year=1977 |editor-last=Brongers |editor-first=Hendrik Antonie |title=Instruction and Interpretation: Studies in Hebrew Language, Palestinian archaeology and biblical exegesis |place=Leiden |publisher=Brill Archive |isbn=90-04-05433-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another northern Sinai suggestion is [[Hashem el-Tarif]], some 30&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Eilat]], [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=26792 |title=Gebel Khashm el Tarif [Jebel Hashem al Taref, Hashem el-Tarif, Mount Sinai (?)&amp;#93; Ancient Temple : The Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map: |publisher=Megalithic.co.uk |access-date=2014-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Simcha Jacobovici |url=http://www.simchajtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Jacobovici-The-Real-Mount-Sinaiwith-pictures.doc |title=The Real Mount Sinai }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edom/Nabatea===
[[File:Petra First Glimpse.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Siq, facing the ''Treasury'', at the foot of [[Jebel al-Madhbah]] ]]
Since Moses is described by the Bible as encountering [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]], a Kenite who was a Midianite priest, shortly before encountering Sinai, this suggests that Sinai would be somewhere near their territory in Saudi Arabia;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; the Kenites and Midianites appear to have resided east of the [[Gulf of Aqaba]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; Additionally, the [[Song of Deborah]], which some textual scholars consider one of the oldest parts of the Bible,&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; portrays God as having dwelt at [[Mount Seir]], and seems to suggest that this equates with Mount Sinai;&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; Mount Seir designates the mountain range in the centre of [[Edom]].

Based on a number of local names and features, in 1927 Ditlef Nielsen identified the ''[[Jebel al-Madhbah]]'' (meaning ''mountain of the Altar'') at [[Petra]] as being identical to the biblical Mount Sinai;&lt;ref&gt;Ditlef Nielsen, ''The Site of the Biblical Mount Sinai – A Claim for Petra'' (1927)&lt;/ref&gt; since then other scholars{{who|date=January 2016}} have also made the identification.

The valley in which Petra resides is known as the ''[[Wadi Musa]]'', meaning ''valley of Moses'', and at the entrance to the [[Siq]] is the Ain Musa, meaning ''spring of Moses''; the 13th century Arab [[chronicle]]r [[Numari]] stated that Ain Musa was [[Meribah|the location where Moses had brought water from the ground, by striking it with his rod]]. The Jebel al-Madhbah was evidently considered particularly sacred, as the well known ritual building known as ''[[Al Khazneh|The Treasury]]'' is carved into its base, the mountain top is covered with a number of different altars, and over 8 metres of the original peak were carved away to leave a flat surface with two 8 metre tall [[obelisk]]s sticking out of it; these obelisks, which frame the end of the path leading up to them, and are now only 6 metres tall, have led to the mountain being [[colloquial]]ly known as ''Zibb 'Atuf'', meaning ''penis of love'' in [[Arabic]]. Archaeological artifacts discovered at the top of the mountain indicate that it was once covered by polished shiny blue [[slate]], fitting with the biblical description of ''paved work of sapphire stone'';&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|24:10|}}&lt;/ref&gt; biblical references to ''sapphire'' are considered by scholars to be unlikely to refer to the stone called ''[[sapphire]]'' in modern times, as ''sapphire'' had a different meaning, and wasn't even mined, before the Roman era.&lt;ref&gt;Cheyne and Black, ''[[Encyclopedia Biblica]]'', ''Hoshen''&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the removal of the original peak has destroyed most other archaeological remains from the late Bronze Age (the standard dating of the Exodus) that might previously have been present.

===Arabian Peninsula===
[[File:Saudi Arabia map.png|thumb|Map of Saudi Arabia]]
A suggested possible naturalistic explanation of the biblical ''devouring fire'' is that Sinai could have been an erupting [[volcano]]; this has been suggested by [[Charles Beke]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Charles Beke, ''Mount Sinai, a Volcano'' (1873)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]],&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''[[Moses and Monotheism]]'' (1939)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Immanuel Velikovsky]], among others. This possibility would exclude all the peaks on the Sinai peninsula and Seir, but would make a number of locations in north western [[Saudi Arabia]] reasonable candidates. In 1873, Charles Beke proposed that Sinai was the ''[[Jabal al-Nour]]'' (meaning ''mountain of light''), a volcanic mountain at the northern end of the Gulf of Aqaba, and which has great significance in [[Islam]] for other reasons;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Beke died the following year, but his writings (published posthumously) retracted this identification four years later in favour of [[Jebel Baggir]], with Horeb being argued to be a different mountain - the nearby Jebel Ertowa.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Beke (deceased), ''Sinai in Arabia and of Median'' (1878)&lt;/ref&gt; Beke's suggestions have not found as much scholarly support as the candidature of [[Hala-'l Badr]]; the equation of Sinai with Hala-'l Badr has been advocated by [[Alois Musil]] in the early 20th century, Jean Koenig in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;Jean Koenig, ''Le site de Al-Jaw dans l'ancien pays de Madian''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Colin Humphreys]] in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;Colin Humphreys, ''The Miracles of Exodus: A Scientist's Discovery of the Extraordinary Natural Causes of the Biblical Stories''&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

The possibility of an alternate site located in Saudi Arabia has also drawn attention due to the Apostle Paul's assertion in the first century that Mount Sinai was located in Arabia, although in Paul's time, the region of Arabia Petraea would have included both the modern Sinai peninsula and northwestern Saudi Arabia. A possible candidate within the Arabia theory has been that of ''[[Jabal al-Lawz]]'' (meaning 'mountain of almonds'). Advocates for Jabal al-Lawz include [[Lennart Moller]]&lt;ref&gt;Lennart Möller, ''The Exodus Case: New Discoveries of the Historical Exodus''&lt;/ref&gt; (a Swedish professor in environmental medicine) and also [[Ron Wyatt]], [[Bob Cornuke]] and Larry Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Mark|title=In Search of Noah's Ark: Wyatt's quest: Part 8 |url=http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?ID=21016|accessdate=3 December 2010|newspaper=Baptist Press|date=June 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mountain of Moses: The Discovery of Mount Sinai, by Larry Williams, (Wynwood Press, New York, 1990; reprinted as The Discovery of Mount Sinai, 1997) p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Jennifer.

Quote, from subsection "Problems with the Gulf of Akaba / Eilat Crossings": "The proponents of Jebel al-Lawz do not agree on the crossing site of the Red Sea in the Gulf of Akaba / Eilat.

Jabal al-Lawz has been rejected by scholars such as [[James K.

===The Negev===
While equating Sinai with [[Petra]] would indicate that the Israelites journeyed in roughly a straight line from Egypt via [[Kadesh Barnea]], and locating Sinai in Saudi Arabia would suggest Kadesh Barnea was skirted to the south, some scholars have wondered whether Sinai was much closer to the vicinity of Kadesh Barnea itself. Halfway between Kadesh Barnea and Petra, in the southwest [[Negev]] desert in Israel, is ''[[Har Karkom]]'', which [[Emmanuel Anati]] excavated, and discovered to have been a major [[Paleolithic]] cult centre, with the surrounding plateau covered with shrines, altars, stone circles, stone pillars, and over 40,000 rock engravings; although the peak of religious activity at the site dates to 2350–2000 BCE, the exodus is dated 15 Nisan 2448 ([[Hebrew calendar]]; 1313 BCE),&lt;ref&gt;Ex. 16:1, 7, 13; Tal. Kid. 38a&lt;/ref&gt; and the mountain appears to have been abandoned between 1950–1000 BCE, Anati proposed that [[Jabal Ideid]] was equatable with biblical Sinai.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Anati, ''The riddle of Mount Sinai: archaeological discoveries at Har Karkom'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harkarkom.com|title=Mount Sinai has been found: Archaeological discoveries at Har Karkom|author=|date=|website=www.harkarkom.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have criticised this identification, as, in addition to being almost 1000 years too early, it also appears to require the wholesale relocation of the Midianites, Amalekites, and other ancient peoples, from the locations where the majority of scholars currently place them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shanks|first1=Hershel|title=Where Is Mount Sinai?

'''Butano State Park''' is a [[state park]] of [[California]], USA, showcasing a secluded [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]]-filled canyon.  Located in [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]] near [[Pescadero, California|Pescadero]], the {{convert|4728|acre|ha|adj=on}} park was established in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = California State Park System Statistical Report: Fiscal Year 2009/10 | url = http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/795/files/09-10%20statistical%20report%20final%20online.pdf | publisher = California State Parks | page = 30 | accessdate = 2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park features miles of [[hiking]] trails, 21 drive-in [[camping|campsites]] and 18 walk-in campsites. Restrooms with running water are provided.   Drinking water is available at the park in both the campground and in the day use areas.  There are no showers.  Butano also has a backpacking site along a trail {{convert|5.5|mi|km}} up from the entrance.  There is no water at the site but there is water nearby from seasonal streams.&lt;ref name="Website"&gt;{{cite web | title = Butano SP | url = http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=536 | publisher = California State Parks | accessdate = 2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guided nature walk and weekend campfire programs are offered during the summer.

==Name==
Butano as a name has been applied to land grants, creeks, falls, ridges and forests.  The earliest mention is by Padre Jaime Escudet in 1816.  A ''butano'' is what early Californians called a drinking cup made from horn of a bull or other animal.  A Native American origin is possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gudde|first1=Erwin G.|title=California place names : the origin and etymology of current geographical names|date=1998|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520213165|page=53|edition=4th ed., rev. and enl.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Central Andean dry puna''' (NT1001) is an [[ecoregion]] in the [[Montane grasslands and shrublands]] [[biome]], located in the [[Andean]] [[high plateau]], in South America. It is a part of the [[Puna grassland]].

==Setting==
This ecoregion occupies the southwestern portion of the [[Altiplano]] and is located east of the [[Atacama Desert]].

[[Salt pan (geology)|Salt flats]], locally known as ''Salares'', are a characteristic feature of this ecoregion. Among the largest salares are [[Salar de Coipasa|Coipasa]], [[Salar de Uyuni|Uyuni]], [[Salar de Atacama|Atacama]], and [[Salar de Arizaro|Arizaro]]. Other major geographical features are the lakes [[Poopó Lake|Poopó]] and [[Coipasa Lake|Coipasa]], and the many volcanoes that tower over the altiplano, including [[Parinacota (volcano)|Parinacota]], [[Nevado Sajama]], [[Tata Sabaya]], [[Ollagüe]], [[Licancabur]], [[Lascar (volcano)|Lascar]], [[Aracar]], [[Socompa]]  and [[Llullaillaco]]. In addition, numerous and colorful small lakes and ponds dot this region. There are seasonal as well as permanent, and have different degrees of [[salinity]].

==Climate==
This ecoregion has a [[Desert climate#Cold desert climates|cold desert climate]].

==Flora==
Typical high Andean [[wetland]]s are the ''Bofedales''. These marshy areas are characterized by the presence of cushion bog vegetation. The [[Yareta]] grows in well-drained soils. Grasslands are dominated by species of the genera [[Stipa]] and [[Festuca]].

Central Andean dry puna is home to [[Polylepis]] species, including the [[Polylepis tarapacana]], which is the woody plant that grows at the highest elevations in the world.

==Fauna==
[[Camelid]]s, such as [[llama]]s, [[alpaca]]s, [[vicuña]]s, are found in this ecoregion. Other mammals include the [[cougar]], [[Andean mountain cat]], [[Andean fox]], and the [[Andean hairy armadillo]].

Three of the six [[flamingo]] species inhabit here. They are [[Andean flamingo]], [[James's flamingo]], and [[Chilean flamingo]]. Other remarkable birds are the [[Darwin's rhea]], [[Andean condor]], [[puna tinamou]], [[puna teal]], [[puna ibis]] and the [[Andean goose]].

==Population and conservation==
Animals and plants find refuge in the protected areas of this ecoregion. Those include:
*[[Lauca National Park]]
*[[Sajama National Park]]
*[[Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve]]
*[[Los Flamencos National Reserve]]
*[[Olaroz-Cauchari Flora and Fauna Reserve]]
*[[Llullaillaco National Park]]

The '''Cerro Barcino Formation''' (also known as the '''Gorro Frigio Formation''') is a geological [[Formation (geology)|formation]] in South America whose strata span the [[Early Cretaceous]]. The top age for the formation has been estimated to be [[Albian]].&lt;ref name=Figari2015_p153&gt;Figari et al., 2015, p.153&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier estimates placed the formation until the [[Campanian]].&lt;ref name=rauhut2003/&gt;

The formation was deposited in the [[Cañadón Asfalto Basin]], a [[rift basin]] that started forming in the earliest Jurassic.&lt;ref name=Figari2015_p142&gt;Figari et al., 2015, p.142&lt;/ref&gt; Dinosaur remains are among the fossils that have been recovered from the formation.&lt;ref name="cretaceousdistribution"&gt;Weishampel, David B; et al. (2004). "Dinosaur distribution (Early Cretaceous, South America)." In: Weishampel, David B.; Dodson, Peter; and Osmólska, Halszka (eds.): The Dinosauria, 2nd, Berkeley: University of California Press. Pp. 563-570. {{ISBN|0-520-24209-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cerro Barcino Formation is the second-youngest unit of the [[Chubut Group]], which also includes the older [[Los Adobes Formation]]. Both formations cover a vast area in [[Chubut Province]], [[Argentina]]. The two formations are distinguished by geological features suggesting a distinct change in climate, from a wetter, [[flood plain]] environment in the Los Adobes to a much more arid, desert-like environment in the Cerro Barcino.&lt;ref name=rauhut2003&gt;Rauhut, O.W.M., Cladera, G., Vickers-Rich, P. and Rich, T.H. (2003). "Dinosaur remains from the Lower Cretaceous of the Chubut Group, Argentina." ''Cretaceous Research'', '''24'''(5): 487-497. {{doi|10.1016/S0195-6671(03)00067-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cerro Barcino Formation is subdivided into several subunits ("members").&lt;ref name=rauhut2003/&gt; From oldest to youngest:
* '''La Paloma'''
**Characterized by arid plains interspersed with [[sand dune]]s
* '''Cerro Castaño'''
**A return to more humid, flood-plain conditions
* '''Las Plumas'''
* '''Bayo Overo'''
* '''Puesto Manuel Arce'''

The final three members were estimated to range from [[Albian]] to [[Campanian]] age (112 to 83 million years ago), while the La Paloma dates to the latest [[Hauterivian]] (130 Ma).&lt;ref name=rauhut2003/&gt;

'''CLASP''', formerly the '''Collaborative Labeling and Appliance Standards Program,''' improves the energy and environmental performance of the appliances &amp; equipment we use every day, accelerating our transition to a more sustainable world.

CLASP serves as the leading international voice &amp; resource for appliance energy efficiency policies and market acceleration initiatives. From advancing the off-grid solar technologies bringing power to energy-impoverished people, to cutting the catastrophic climate impacts of air conditioning, CLASP programs increase uptake of affordable, low-impact, high-quality appliances.

Appliances are a big part of our lives. Smart phones keep us connected. Heating, cooling, and lighting improve productivity and safety. Refrigeration protects the food we harvest and eat.  Without much thought, we interact with energy- and resource-consuming products every day.

Though appliances improve lives and livelihoods, they also use energy and other essential resources. Recent analyses indicate that air conditioning, not cars, pose the greatest threat to our planet. As millions of households in developing and emerging economies have the financial resources to control their indoor climate for the first time, the world is poised to install 700 million new room air conditioners by 2030 and 1.6 billion by 2050.  In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, that’s like adding several large countries to the planet.

Meanwhile, nearly 3 billion people prepare their meals on inefficient, pre-modern cookstoves, or over open fires, using charcoal and biomass. An estimated 1.2 billion people around the globe lack access to electricity entirely—another billion have only unreliable access. Energy poverty is a major barrier to social and economic development, and the emissions generated by inefficient and dirty cooking and lighting methods pose serious health risks, especially to women and children, and are powerful climate forcers. For most households living beyond the grid, electrification is too long coming, and for most governments, total electrification is far too expensive and resource-intensive.

On the grid, energy efficient appliances are one of the most cost-effective methods for mitigating climate change. They save money for governments and consumers alike, reduce peak energy demand, and bolster economic and energy security. Off the grid, energy efficient appliances pair with solar-home systems or mini-grids to increase the availability and affordability of energy. Radically reducing the cost of off-grid energy through efficient appliances improves educational, health, and economic outcomes for the world’s poorest people, while moving all of us closer to a cleaner, renewably-powered energy economy.

CLASP was created in 1999 as a strategic cooperation of three organization – the [[Alliance to Save Energy|Alliance to Save Energy (ASE)]], the International Institute for Energy Conservation (IIEC), and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LBNL|url=http://eetd.lbl.gov/l2m2/clasp.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It became an independent, non profit [[501(c)3]] organization in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Division for Sustainable Development|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/sustdev/csd/csd15/PF/info/C_Egan.pdf|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==What We Do ==
Since 1999, CLASP has worked in over 100 countries taking three primary approaches:

'''Policy &amp; Analysis''' – smart policy moves markets towards more energy-efficient and higher quality appliances, from LEDs to cookstoves. We work hand-in-hand with governments to structure rigorous energy and quality standards that promote innovation and competition, and with manufacturers, consumers, and others to label and deploy stand-out products.

'''Market Development &amp; Innovation''' – Incentivizing good appliances to buyers up and down the supply chain reduces risk for everyone, and builds up markets that are weak or disorganized. Innovative products – from refrigeration for off-grid consumers to the switch to DC power and the internet of things – are game changers for how we all use energy.

'''Global Collaboration''' – CLASP serves at the epicenter of ambitious and collaborative efforts to prevent catastrophic climate change and make the world sustainable for all. Our cross-cutting research, online tools, trainings, and stakeholder coalitions make best practices available to everybody, amplifying our efforts and impact.

The '''Electricity Security and Affordability Act''' ({{USBill|113|hr|3826}}) is a bill that would repeal a pending rule published by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) on January 8, 2014.&lt;ref name="cbo3826"/&gt; The proposed rule would establish uniform national limits on [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions from new [[Power station|electricity-generating facilities]] that use [[coal]] or [[natural gas]].&lt;ref name="cbo3826"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HousevotesBlock"/&gt; The rule also sets new standards of performance for those power plants, including the requirement to install [[Carbon capture and storage|carbon capture]] and [[Carbon sequestration|sequestration]] technology.&lt;ref name="cbo3826"/&gt;

The bill passed in the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].

==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=3826sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 3826 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3826|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Electricity Security and Affordability Act would prohibit the Administrator of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) from issuing, implementing, or enforcing any proposed or final rule under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] that establishes a performance standard for [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from any new source that is a [[fossil fuel]]-fired electric utility generating unit unless the rule meets specified requirements of this Act.&lt;ref name="3826sum"/&gt;

The bill would require the Administrator to separate sources fueled with [[coal]] and [[natural gas]] into separate categories.&lt;ref name="3826sum"/&gt;

The bill would prohibit the Administrator, however, from setting a standard based on the best system of emission reduction for new sources within the coal category unless it has been achieved on average for at least one continuous 12-month period (excluding planned outages) by each of at least 6 units within the category. Requires each such unit to: (1) be located at a different electric generating station in the United States, (2) be representative of the operating characteristics of electric generation at its location, and (3) be operated for the entire 12-month period on a full commercial basis. Prohibits the use of any results obtained from a demonstration project in setting the standard.&lt;ref name="3826sum"/&gt;

The bill would require the Administrator, in separating sources fueled with coal into a separate category, to establish a separate subcategory for new sources that are fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units using coal with an average heat content of 8300 or less [[British thermal unit|British Thermal Units]] (BTUs) per pound.&lt;ref name="3826sum"/&gt;

The bill would prohibit the Administrator, in issuing any rule establishing performance standards for greenhouse gas emissions from new sources in such subcategory, from setting a standard based on the best system of emission reduction unless the standard has been achieved on average for at least one continuous 12-month period (excluding planned outages) by each of at least 3 units within such subcategory that meets the unit requirements specified by this Act for the coal category.&lt;ref name="3826sum"/&gt;

The bill would preclude from taking effect, unless a federal law is enacted specifying an effective date, any EPA rule or guideline that: (1) establishes any performance standard for greenhouse gas emissions from a modified or reconstructed source that is a fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating unit, or (2) applies to greenhouse gas emissions from such an existing source.&lt;ref name="3826sum"/&gt;

The bill would nullify the force and effect of specified proposed rules (or similar successor proposed or final rules) for Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions for New Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units that are issued before enactment of this Act.&lt;ref name="3826sum"/&gt;
↔

==Congressional Budget Office report==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Budget Office]], as ordered reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on January 28, 2014. This is a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=cbo3826&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 3826|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45112|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 8, 2014, the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) published a proposed rule that would establish uniform national limits on [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions from new [[Power station|electricity-generating facilities]] that use [[coal]] or [[natural gas]]. The rule also sets new standards of performance for those power plants, including the requirement to install [[Carbon capture and storage|carbon capture]] and [[Carbon sequestration|sequestration]] technology. H.R. 3826 would repeal this pending rule and place new requirements on any future regulations addressing GHG emissions from new or existing power plants.&lt;ref name="cbo3826"/&gt;

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimates that implementing this legislation would cost $2 million over the 2015-2019 period, subject to the availability of [[appropriations bill (United States)|appropriated]] funds. Enacting H.R. 3826 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, [[PAYGO|pay-as-you-go]] procedures do not apply.&lt;ref name="cbo3826"/&gt;

H.R. 3826 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the [[Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995|Unfunded Mandates Reform Act]] and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments.&lt;ref name="cbo3826"/&gt;

==Procedural history==
The Electricity Security and Affordability Act was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] on January 9, 2014, by [[Ed Whitfield|Rep. Ed Whitfield (R, KY-1)]].&lt;ref name=3826allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 3826 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3826/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce]] and the [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power]]. It was reported by the committee on February 28, 2014 alongside [http://beta.congress.gov/113/crpt/hrpt365/CRPT-113hrpt365.pdf House Report 113-365].&lt;ref name="3826allactions"/&gt; On February 29, 2014, House Majority Leader [[Eric Cantor]] announced that H.R. 3826 would be considered on March 5, 2014.&lt;ref name=leaderssched&gt;{{cite web|title=Leader's Weekly Schedule - Week of March 3, 2014|url=http://majorityleader.gov/floor/3-3-14%20WEEKLY.pdf|publisher=House Majority Leader's Office|accessdate=4 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304204634/http://majorityleader.gov/floor/3-3-14%20WEEKLY.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill passed the House on March 6, 2014 in a vote of 229-183.&lt;ref name=HousevotesBlock&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House votes to block EPA regs on coal-fired electricity plants|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/200096-house-votes-to-block-epa-regs-on-electricity-plants|accessdate=6 March 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate and discussion==
Republicans thought the bill was needed to stop the EPA from implementing a rule that would force new coal-fired power plants to meet an impossible emissions standard.&lt;ref name="HousevotesBlock"/&gt; Bill sponsor [[Ed Whitfield]] (R-KY) said that, if finalized, the EPA's rule would "make it impossible to build a new coal-powered plant in American... That is hard to believe that that will can be the situation in our great country, particularly since 40 percent of our electricity comes from coal."&lt;ref name="HousevotesBlock"/&gt; Whitfield argued that the legislation was needed because the EPA refused to respond to criticism or complaints about their proposed rule.&lt;ref name="HousevotesBlock"/&gt; Republicans also criticized the EPA's proposed rule, suggesting that it could raise electricity prices by up to $1,200 per household.&lt;ref name="HousevotesBlock"/&gt;

The activist group [[FreedomWorks]] supported the bill and asked its members to contact their representatives about it.&lt;ref name=FreedomWorks1&gt;{{cite web|last=Kibbe|first=Matt|title=Tell Your Representative/Senators to Support the Electricity Security and Affordability Act|url=http://www.freedomworks.org/content/tell-your-representativesenators-support-electricity-security-and-affordability-act|publisher=FreedomWorks|accessdate=6 March 2014|date=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a blog post FreedomWorks president [[Matt Kibbe]] said that the bill would go a "long way in curbing the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) radical war on affordable and reliable energy from fossil fuels."&lt;ref name="FreedomWorks1"/&gt; Kibbe argued that the EPA's proposed rule was "an obvious backdoor attempt to effectively outlaw coal" becaust the standards were set "well below the emissions levels achieved by even the most advanced coal facilities."&lt;ref name="FreedomWorks1"/&gt;

The bill was also supported by [[Grover Norquist]] of [[Americans for Tax Reform]]. Norquist said "Congress never intended for the EPA to unilaterally determine what source of energy Americans consume. The Electricity Security and Affordability Act also reaffirms Congress's legislative duties by enacting numerous safeguards against EPA partisan overreach."&lt;ref name=ATRendorses&gt;{{cite web|last=Prandoni|first=Chris|title=ATR endorses the Electricity Security and Affordability Act|url=http://www.atr.org/atr-endorses-electricity-security-affordability-act-a8088|publisher=Americans for Tax Reform|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Democrats opposed the bill, arguing that it was meant to derail efforts to reduce carbon emissions.&lt;ref name="HousevotesBlock"/&gt; Rep. [[Henry Waxman]] (D-CA) said that "If we pass this terrible bill, we will vote to let China leap ahead of us in the race to build the clean energy economy for the future, and we will be ignoring our moral obligation to protect the planet for our children and grandchildren."&lt;ref name="HousevotesBlock"/&gt;

President [[Barack Obama]] said that he would veto the bill.&lt;ref name="HousevotesBlock"/&gt; Rep. [[John Dingell]] (D-MI) did not believe that the bill would pass the Senate, so "we are wasting the time of the American people."&lt;ref name=Drajem1&gt;{{cite news|last=Drajem |first=Mark |title=Republican Bill to Block Obama's Climate Rules Approved by Panel |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-01-28/republican-bill-to-block-obama-s-climate-rules-approved-by-panel |accessdate=6 March 2014 |newspaper=BloombergBusinessweek |date=28 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201151422/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-01-28/republican-bill-to-block-obama-s-climate-rules-approved-by-panel |archivedate=1 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''firelighter''' is a small, [[solid fuel]] tablet for [[fire making]]. Firelighters marketed as [[consumer products]] may be used to start a wood or coal fire in a [[fireplace]], [[wood-burning stove]], or [[Portable stove#Solid-fuel stoves|solid-fuel portable stove]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/firelighter|work=Cambridge Dictionary|title=firelighter|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|accessdate=14 June 2012|quote=(a small block of) material which burns very easily and is used for helping to start wood or coal fires}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[hazardous material]], firelighters are assigned a [[UN number]]: [[List of UN numbers 2601 to 2700|2623]] ("Firelighters; solid with [[flammable liquid]]").

The '''Flora of [[Ashmore and Cartier Islands]]''' consists of 16 families, 23 genera and 27 species. Four of these species are introduced and naturalised. In addition, two species have been introduced but not naturalised. The vegetation is dominated by shrubs, grasses and creepers. The vast majority of species have seeds that are very easily transported by the wind, birds or the sea.

==Flora of Ashmore Reef==
The following plant taxa occur on the islands of Ashmore Reef:

In addition to these, ''[[Zea mays]]'' (Maize) and ''[[Cocos nucifera]]'' (Coconut) have been introduced by visiting [[Indonesia]]n fishermen as food sources, but these are not naturalised.

==Flora of Cartier Island==
[[Cartier Island]] is unvegetated. The only recorded plant is the seagrass ''[[Thallassia hemprichii]]'', which forms meadows in pockets of sand among the reef.

{{Hinduism}}
'''Godavari Maha Pushkaram''' (Great Worship of the [[Godavari River]]) was a [[List of Hindu festivals|Hindu festival]] held from 14 July to 25 July 2015. This festival occurs once every 144 years, corresponding to the 12th recurrence of the 12-year Godavari [[Pushkaram]] cycle.&lt;ref name=Maha&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.godavarimahapushkaram.org/2015/06/22/godavari-maha-pushkaram-2015/|title=Godavari Maha Pushkaram 2015|accessdate=3 June 2015|publisher=Official website of Godavari Mahapushkaram Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival starts from the [[Ashadha]] (June/July) month on the [[Chaturdashi]] day ([[thithi]]) (14th day), when planet [[Jupiter (astrology)|Jupiter]] enters the zodiac sign of [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]].&lt;ref name=Maha/&gt;{{Sfn|Roshen|2014|p=921}} The festival is "theoretically" observed throughout the twelve months that the planet remains in that sign, but the first 12 days are considered most sacred.&lt;ref name="Eenadu"&gt;{{Cite web

At least 27 pilgrims, 13 of them women, died and 20 others injured in a stampede at a major bathing spot on the banks of the Godavari river where a huge crowd of devotees had gathered on the opening day of 'Pushkaram' festival.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-07-14/news/64405897_1_holy-dip-godavari-river-pushkaram&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
"Maha" means "great" and [[Pushkaram]] refers to the worship of the river in which the god Pushkar appears every 12 years.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; Pushakaram is spelled Pushkaralu in [[Telugu language|Telugu]], Pushkaram in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], Pushkara in [[Kannada language|Kannada]], and Pushkar in [[Hindi language|Hindi]].

==Background==

{{main|Pushkaram}}
[[Pushkaram]] is an Indian festival dedicated to worshiping of 12 sacred rivers. The celebration happens annually, once in 12 years along each river. Each river is associated with a zodiac sign, and the river for each year's festival is based on which sign Bruhaspathi ([[Planets in astrology#Jupiter|Jupiter]]) is in at the time.&lt;ref name="Roshen2014"&gt;{{cite book |author=Roshen Dalal |title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zrk0AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT921 |date=18 April 2014 |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |isbn=978-81-8475-277-9 |pages=921–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that bathing in the sacred river during Pushkaram cleanses the devotees of their sins.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

Godavari is one of the 12 sacred rivers, and the ''Godavari Pushkaram'' takes place once every 12 years, when the Jupiter is in the [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]] sign. The ''Maha Pushkaram'' ("Great Pushkaram") takes place once every 144 years.

==Festival dates==
The 2015 Godavari Pushkaram is believed to be a ''Maha Pushkaram'', which happens once in 144 years. During the year 2015, Jupiter enters Leo on 14 July 2015 (Tuesday) at 6.26 AM, when the Maha Pushkaram begins, and ends after 12 days on 25 July 2015 (Saturday).&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news19.in/godavari-pushkaralu-2015-schedule-pushkar-ghat-details/|title=Godavari Pushkaralu 2015 schedule Pushkar Ghat Details |accessdate=4 July 2015 |date=9 June 2015 |publisher=News19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple [[almanac]] writers and other skeptics have disputed that the 2015 Godavari Pushkaram is a "Maha Pushkaram". According to Hanmanthavajjula Subrahmanya Sarma, the president of State Drukghanitha Almanac Writers’ Association, the "theory of 144 years is a myth", and nobody knows "who calculated it and how they calculated it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/140718/nation-current-affairs/article/%E2%80%98144-yr%E2%80%99-confusion-grips-pushkaram |title=Confusion over '144 Year' old Godavari Kumba Mela grips Pushkaram |date=2014-07-18 |newspaper=Deccan Chronicle }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An emblem titled "Godavari Maha Pushkaram 2015" and "Godavari Pushkaramalu" has been adopted by the state governments for this festival, and a special organization under the same name has also been instituted to address all issues related to the smooth functioning of the festive event. The emblem or logo with a simple design has lines to denote the rapid flow conditions of the Godavari River, a "jyoti" a glowing light, and the representation of offering oblation, called "Arghyam", to [[Surya]], the Sun god.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/andhra-pradesh-govt-chalks-out-grand-plans-for-godavari-maha-pushkaram/ | title=Andhra Pradesh govt chalks out grand plans for Godavari ‘Maha Pushkaram|date=20 May 2015|author=PTI|newspaper=The Indian Express|accessdate=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A religious symbolic performance called the "Godavari Harathi", a ritual of worship with a number of lamps, similar to the [[Ganga]] [[Aarti]] that is conducted on the banks of the Ganges in [[Varanasi]], is also proposed to be held at Rajahmundry where the river flows out to the sea.&lt;ref name=Maha/&gt;

'''Gretel Ehrlich''' is an [[United States|American]] travel writer, poet, and [[essay]]ist.

Born in 1946 in [[Santa Barbara, California]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.librarything.com/author/ehrlichgretel Library Thing]&lt;/ref&gt; she studied at [[Bennington College]] and [[UCLA]] film school. She began to write full-time in 1978, living on a Wyoming ranch, after the death of a loved one. Ehrlich debuted in 1985 with ''The Solace of Open Spaces'', a collection of essays on rural life in Wyoming. Her first novel, also set in Wyoming, was ''Heart Mountain'' (1988), about a community being invaded by an [[internment camp]] for [[Japanese Americans]].

One of Ehrlich's most beloved books is a volume of creative nonfiction essays called ''Islands, The Universe, Home.''
Her characteristic style of merging intense, vivid factual observations of nature with a wryly mystical personal voice is evident in this text. Other books include ''This Cold Heaven: Seven Seasons in Greenland'' and two volumes of poetry.

In 1991 Ehrlich was hit by lightning. She was incapacitated for several years, and she wrote a book about the experience, ''A Match to the Heart'', which was published in 1994.

'''Heat recovery ventilation''' ('''HRV'''), also known as '''mechanical ventilation heat recovery''' ('''MVHR'''), is an [[energy recovery]] [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] system using equipment known as a heat recovery ventilator, [[heat exchanger]], air exchanger, or [[air-to-air heat exchanger]] which employs a cross flow or [[countercurrent exchange|counter-flow]] heat exchanger (countercurrent heat exchange) between the inbound and outbound air flow.&lt;ref&gt;''Most HRVs are balanced ventilators in which heat is transferred from one airstream to another. These balanced HRVs are often called air-to-air heat exchangers (AAHXs). Central-exhaust heat-pump water heaters are HRVs but they are not AAHXs because they transfer heat from one airstream into water, not between two airstreams. Another term often used is energy recovery ventilator (ERV). All HRVs transfer sensible heat from one airstream to another or to water. If latent heat is also transferred, then an HRV can be called an ERV. While there are specific differences between these different terms, many people use HRV, AAHX, and ERV interchangeably. '' The Healthy House Institute. Staff. "ERV". Understanding Ventilation: How to Design, Select, and Install Residential Ventilation Systems. June 4, 2009. December 9, 2009. &lt;http://www.healthyhouseinstitute.com/hhip_493-ERV&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Energy recovery ventilation|Energy recovery ventilators]] (ERVs) are closely related; however, ERVs also transfer the [[humidity]] level of the exhaust air to the intake air.

==Benefits==
Because building efficiency is improved with [[Building insulation|insulation]] and [[weather stripping]], new buildings are intentionally made more airtight, and consequently less well ventilated.  HRV systems provide ventilation without the loss of heat or humidity, which could put stress on a building's heating, ventilating/ventilation, and air conditioning ([[HVAC]]) systems.  HRV introduces fresh air to a building and improves climate control, whilst promoting [[efficient energy use]].

UK building regulations require one air change every two hours (0.5 [[Air changes per hour|ACH]]). With traditional extract-only ventilation that means a house boiler would need to warm up a house-full of cold air 12 times a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarcrest.co.uk/heat-recovery-ventilation.asp|title=MVHR Heat Recovery Ventilation MVHR|website=www.solarcrest.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
HRVs and ERVs can be stand-alone devices that operate independently, or they can be built-in or added to existing HVAC systems.  For a small building in which nearly every room has an exterior wall, then the HRV/ERV device can be small and provide ventilation for a single room.  A larger building would require either many small units or a large central unit.  The only requirements for the building are an air supply, either directly from an exterior wall or ducted to one, and an energy supply for air circulation, such as wind energy or electricity for fans and electronic control system.  When used with 'central' HVAC systems, then the system would be of the 'forced-air' type.

==Air-to-air heat exchanger==
[[Image:Heat exchanger.svg|thumb|400px|Types of [[Recuperator]] air-to-air [[heat exchanger]]s.]]

There are a number of types of air-to-air heat exchanger that can be used in HRV devices:
* cross flow heat exchanger up to 60% efficient (passive)
* [[Recuperator]], or cross plate heat exchanger, a [[countercurrent exchange|countercurrent]] heat exchanger, as diagrammed to the right
* [[Thermal Wheel]], or rotary heat exchanger (requires motor to turn wheel)
* [[Heat pipe]]
* thin multiple heat wires (Fine wire heat exchanger)

: See also:
* [[Shell and tube heat exchanger]]
* [[Plate heat exchanger]]
* [[Plate fin heat exchanger]]
* [[Ground-coupled heat exchanger]]
* [[Dynamic scraped surface heat exchanger]]
* [[Waste Heat Recovery Unit]]
* [[Micro heat exchanger]]
* [[Moving bed heat exchanger]]

===Incoming air===
The air coming into the heat exchanger should be above 0&amp;nbsp;°C. Otherwise humidity in the outgoing air may condense, freeze and block the heat exchanger.

A high enough incoming air temperature can also be achieved by
* recirculating some of the exhaust air (causing loss of air quality) when required,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Local exhaust ventilation testing|url=https://watertreatmentservices.co.uk/air/local-exhaust-ventilation-testing/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* by using a very small (1&amp;nbsp;kW) [[heat pump]] to warm the inlet air above freezing before it enters the HRV device. (The 'cold' side of this heatpump is situated in the warm air outlet.)
* using a heating "battery" supplied by heat from a heat source e.g. hot water circuit from a wood-fired boiler, etc.

==Earth-to-air heat exchanger==
[[Image:Passivhaus section en.jpg|thumb|300px|Heat recovery ventilation, often with an earth-to-air heat exchanger, is essential to achieve German [[Passivhaus]] standards.]]
[[File:Ventilation unit with heat pump &amp; ground heat exchanger.png|thumb|300px|Ventilation unit with heat pump &amp; ground heat exchanger]]
[[File:Ventilation unit with heat pump and ground - cooling.png|thumb|300px|Ventilation unit with heat pump &amp; ground heat exchanger - cooling]]
[[File:Płytowy GPWC wewnątrz obrysu fundamentowego.JPG|thumb|300px|Plate ground heat exchanger inside the foundation walls]]
{{Main|Ground-coupled heat exchanger}}

This can be done by an [[Ground-coupled heat exchanger|earth warming pipe]] ("ground-coupled heat exchanger"), usually about 30 m to 40 m long and 20&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter, typically buried about 1.5 m below ground level. In [[Germany]] and [[Austria]] this is a common configuration for earth-to-air heat exchangers.

In high [[humidity]] areas where internal condensation could lead to [[fungal]]/[[mould]] growth in the tube leading to [[contamination]] of the air, several measures exist to prevent this.

* Ensuring the tube drains of water
* Regular cleaning
* Tubes with an imbedded bactericide coating such as silver ions (non-toxic for humans)
* Air filters F7/EU7 (&gt;0,4 micrometres) to trap mould (of a size between 2 and 20 micrometres)
* [[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation#Air purification|UV air purification]]
* Use an earth to "water" heat exchanger, see below

The pipes may be either corrugated/slotted to enhance heat transfer and provide condensate drainage or smooth/solid to prevent gas/liquid transfer.

===Air quality===
This is highly site dependent.

====Radon====
One critical problem of using earth-to-air heat exchanger is being located in soils with underlying rock [[stratum|strata]] which emit [[radon]]. In these situations the tube needs to be airtight from the surrounding soils, or an air to water heat exchanger needs to be used.

====Bacteria and fungi====
Formal research indicates that Earth-to-Air Heat Exchangers (EAHX) reduce building ventilation air pollution. Rabindra (2004){{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} states, “The Earth-Air Tunnel is found not to support the growth of bacteria and fungi; rather it is found to reduce the quantity of bacteria and fungi thus making the air safer for humans to inhale. It is therefore clear that the use of earth-to-air heat exchangers not only helps save the energy but also helps reduce the air pollution by reducing bacteria and fungi.”

Likewise, Flueckiger (1999) in a study of twelve Earth-to-Air Heat Exchangers varying in design, pipe material, size and age, stated, “This study was performed because of concerns of potential [[microbe|microbial growth]] in the buried pipes of 'ground-coupled' air systems. The results, however, demonstrate that no harmful growth occurs and that the airborne concentrations of viable [[spore]]s and [[bacteria]], with few exceptions, even decreases after passage through the pipe-system”, and further stated, “Based on these investigations the operation of ground-coupled earth-to-air heat exchangers is acceptable as long as regular controls are undertaken and if appropriate cleaning facilities are available”.

==Earth-to-water heat exchanger==
An alternative to the earth-to-air heat exchanger is the earth-to-water heat exchanger. This is typically similar to a [[geothermal heat pump]] tubing embedded horizontally in the soil (or could be a vertical pipe/sonde) to a similar depth of the EAHX. It uses approximately double the length of pipe Ø 35&amp;nbsp;mm i.e. around 80 metres compared to an EAHX. A heat exchanger coil is placed before the air inlet of the HRV. Typically a brine liquid (heavily salted water) is used as the heat exchange fluid which is slightly more efficient and environmentally friendly than polypropylene heat transfer liquids.

In temperate climates in an energy efficient building, such as a [[passivhaus]], this is more than sufficient for comfort cooling during summer without resorting to an airconditioning system. In more extreme hot climates a very small air-to-air micro-heat pump in reverse (an air conditioner) with the evaporator (giving heat) on the air inlet after the HRV heat exchanger and the condenser (taking heat) from the air outlet after the heat exchanger will suffice.

==Seasonal bypassing ==
At certain times of the year, it is more thermally efficient to bypass the Heat recovery ventilation-HRV heat exchanger or the earth-to-air heat exchanger (EAHX).

For example, during the winter, the earth at the depth of the earth-to-air heat exchanger is ordinarily much warmer than the air temperature. The air becomes warmed by the earth before reaching the air heat exchanger.

In the summer, the opposite is true. The air becomes cooled in the earth to air exchanger. But after passing through the EAHX, the air is warmed by the heat recovery ventilator using the warmth of the outgoing air. In this case, the HRV can have an internal bypass such that the inflowing air bypasses the heat exchanger maximising the cooling potential of the earth.

In autumn and spring there may be no thermal benefit from the EAHX—it may heat/cool the air too much and it will be better to use external air directly. In this case it is helpful to have a bypass such that the EAHX is disconnected and air taken directly from outside. A differential temperature sensor with a motorized valve can control the bypass function.

The '''High Power laser Energy Research facility''' ('''HiPER'''), is a proposed experimental laser-driven [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) device undergoing preliminary design for possible construction in the [[European Union]]. HiPER is the first experiment designed specifically to study the "fast ignition" approach to generating [[nuclear fusion]], which uses much smaller [[laser]]s than conventional designs, yet produces fusion power outputs of about the same magnitude. This offers a total "[[fusion gain]]" that is much higher than devices like the [[National Ignition Facility]] (NIF), and a reduction in construction costs of about ten times.

Theoretical research since the design of HiPER in the early 2000s has cast doubt on fast ignition as a route to practical ICF. A new approach known as ''shock ignition'' has been proposed to address some of these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=LJ |last=Perkins |url=http://hifweb.lbl.gov/public/LLNL-LDRD-refs2009/Perkins-PRL09.pdf |title=Shock Ignition: A New Approach to High Gain Inertial Confinement Fusion on the National Ignition Facility |date=2009 |journal=Physical Review Letters|doi=10.1103/physrevlett.103.045004 |bibcode=2009PhRvL.103d5004P }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar ICF experimental setup in Japan was known as "HIPER", but this is no longer operational.

==Background==
{{main|inertial confinement fusion#ICF mechanism of action|l1=ICF mechanism}}
[[Inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) devices use "drivers" to rapidly heat the outer layers of a "target" to compress it. The target is a small spherical pellet containing a few milligrams of fusion fuel, typically a mix of [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]]. The heat of the laser burns the surface of the pellet into a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], which explodes off the surface. The remaining portion of the target is driven inwards due to [[Newton's Third Law]], eventually collapsing into a small point of very high density. The rapid blowoff also creates a [[shock wave]] that travels towards the center of the compressed fuel. When it reaches the center of the fuel and meets the shock from the other side of the target, the energy in the shock wave further heats and compresses the tiny volume around it. If the temperature and density of that small spot can be raised high enough, fusion reactions will occur.&lt;ref name=how&gt;"[https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nif/how_nif_works/ How NIF works] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527191346/https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nif/how_nif_works/ |date=27 May 2010 }}", Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Retrieved on 2 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fusion reactions release high-energy particles, some of which (primarily [[alpha particle]]s) collide with the high density fuel around it and slow down. This heats the fuel further, and can potentially cause that fuel to undergo fusion as well. Given the right overall conditions of the compressed fuel—high enough density and temperature—this heating process can result in a [[chain reaction]], burning outward from the center where the shock wave started the reaction. This is a condition known as "ignition", which can lead to a significant portion of the fuel in the target undergoing fusion, and the release of significant amounts of energy.&lt;ref name=econ&gt;Per F. Peterson, ''[http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/thyd/icf/IFE.html Inertial Fusion Energy: A Tutorial on the Technology and Economics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927140724/http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/thyd/icf/IFE.html |date=27 September 2011 }}'', University of California, Berkeley, 1998. Retrieved on 7 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

To date most ICF experiments have used lasers to heat the targets. Calculations show that the energy must be delivered quickly to compress the core before it disassembles, as well as creating a suitable shock wave. The energy must also be focused extremely evenly across the target's outer surface to collapse the fuel into a symmetric core. Although other "drivers" have been suggested, notably heavy ions driven in [[particle accelerator]]s, lasers are currently the only devices with the right combination of features.&lt;ref&gt;Per F. Peterson, ''[http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/thyd/icf/target.html How IFE Targets Work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617120937/http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/thyd/icf/target.html |date=17 June 2008 }}'', University of California, Berkeley, 1998.

==Description==
In the case of HiPER, the driver laser system is similar to existing systems like NIF, but considerably smaller and less powerful.

The driver consists of a number of "beamlines" containing [[Nd:glass laser]] amplifiers at one end of the building. Just prior to firing, the glass is [[laser pumping|"pumped"]] to a high-energy state with a series of [[xenon flash tube]]s, causing a [[population inversion]] of the [[neodymium]] (Nd) atoms in the glass. This readies them for amplification via [[laser|stimulated emission]] when a small amount of laser light, generated externally in a [[fibre optic]], is fed into the beamlines. The glass is not particularly effective at transferring power into the beam, so to get as much power as possible back out the beam is reflected through the glass four times in a mirrored cavity, each time gaining more power.&lt;ref&gt;Dunne, 2007, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; When this process is complete, a [[Pockels cell]] "switches" the light out of the cavity.&lt;ref name=d147&gt;Dunne, 2007, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; One problem for the HiPER project is that Nd:glass is no longer being produced commercially, so a number of options need to be studied to ensure supply of the estimated 1,300 disks.&lt;ref name=d147/&gt;

From there, the laser light is fed into a very long [[spatial filter]] to clean up the resulting pulse. The filter is essentially a telescope that focuses the beam into a spot some distance away, where a small pinhole located at the focal point cuts off any "stray" light caused by inhomogeneities in the laser beam. The beam then widens out until a second lens returns it to a straight beam again. It is the use of spatial filters that lead to the long beamlines seen in ICF laser devices. In the case of HiPER, the filters take up about 50% of the overall length. The beam width at exit of the driver system is about 40&amp;nbsp;cm × 40&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;Dunne, 2007, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the problems encountered in previous experiments, notably the [[Shiva laser]], was that the [[infrared]] light provided by the Nd:glass lasers (at ~1054&amp;nbsp;nm in ''vaco'') couples strongly with the [[electron]]s around the target, losing a considerable amount of energy that would otherwise heat the target itself. This is typically addressed through the use of an [[optical frequency multiplier]], which can double or triple the frequency of the light, into the green or [[ultraviolet]], respectively. These higher frequencies interact less strongly with the electrons, putting more power into the target. HiPER will use frequency tripling on the drivers.&lt;ref&gt;S. Atzeni, et al., [http://www.hiper-laser.org/pressandpr/journalarticles/atzeni_et_al_april2008.pdf "Fast ignitor target studies for the HiPER project"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205144210/http://www.hiper-laser.org/pressandpr/journalarticles/atzeni_et_al_april2008.pdf |date=5 December 2010 }}, ''Physics of Plasmas'', Vol. 15, 056311 (2008), {{doi|10.1063/1.2895447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the amplification process is complete the laser light enters the experimental chamber, lying at one end of the building. Here it is reflected off a series of deformable mirrors that help correct remaining imperfections in the wavefront, and then feeds them into the target chamber from all angles. Since the overall distances from the ends of the beamlines to different points on the target chamber are different, delays are introduced on the individual paths to ensure they all reach the center of the chamber at the same time, within about 10&amp;nbsp;picoseconds (ps). The target, a fusion fuel pellet about 1&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter in the case of HiPER, lies at the center of the chamber.&lt;ref name=hiper/&gt;

HiPER differs from most ICF devices in that it also includes a second set of lasers for directly heating the compressed fuel. The heating pulse needs to be very short, about 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;ps long, but this is too short a time for the amplifiers to work well. To solve this problem HiPER uses a technique known as ''[[chirped pulse amplification]]'' (CPA). CPA starts with a short pulse from a wide-bandwidth (multi-frequency) laser source, as opposed to the driver which uses a monochromatic (single-frequency) source. Light from this initial pulse is split into different colours using a pair of [[diffraction grating]]s and optical delays. This "stretches" the pulse into a chain several nanoseconds long. The pulse is then sent into the amplifiers as normal. When it exits the beamlines it is recombined in a similar set of gratings to produce a single very short pulse, but because the pulse now has very high power, the gratings have to be large (approx 1&amp;nbsp;m) and sit in a vacuum. Additionally the individual beams must be lower in power overall; the compression side of the system uses 40 beamlines of about 5&amp;nbsp;kJ each to generate a total of 200&amp;nbsp;kJ, whereas the ignition side requires 24 beamlines of just under 3&amp;nbsp;kJ to generate a total of 70&amp;nbsp;kJ. The precise number and power of the beamlines are currently a subject of research.&lt;ref name=hiper/&gt; Frequency multiplication will also be used on the heaters, but it has not yet been decided whether to use doubling or tripling; the latter puts more power into the target, but is less efficient converting the light. As of 2007, the baseline design is based on doubling into the green.&lt;ref&gt;Dunne, 2007, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fast Ignition and HiPER==
In traditional ICF devices the driver laser is used to compress the target to very high densities. The shock wave created by this process further heats the compressed fuel when it collides in the center of the sphere. If the compression is symmetrical enough the increase in temperature can create conditions close to the [[Lawson criterion]], leading to significant fusion energy production. If the resulting fusion rate is high enough, the energy released in these reactions will heat the surrounding fuel to similar temperatures, causing them to undergo fusion as well. In this case, known as "ignition", a significant portion of the fuel will undergo fusion and release large amounts of energy. Ignition is the basic goal of any fusion device.

The amount of laser energy needed to effectively compress the targets to ignition conditions has grown rapidly from early estimates. In the "early days" of ICF research in the 1970s it was believed that as little as 1&amp;nbsp;[[kilojoules]] (kJ) would suffice,&lt;ref&gt;Nuckolls et al., ''[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v239/n5368/pdf/239139a0.pdf Laser Compression of Matter to Super-High Densities: Thermonuclear (CTR) Applications]'', ''Nature'' Vol. 239, 1972, pp. 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Lindl, ''[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10126383-6NAuBK/native/10126383.pdf The Edward Teller Medal Lecture: The Evolution Toward Indirect Drive and Two Decades of Progress Toward ICF Ignition and Burn]'', 11th International Workshop on Laser Interaction and Related Plasma Phenomena, December 1994. Retrieved on 7 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of experimental lasers were built to reach these power levels. When they did, a series of problems, typically related to the homogeneity of the collapse, turned out to seriously disrupt the implosion symmetry and lead to much cooler core temperatures than originally expected. Through the 1980s the estimated energy required to reach ignition grew into the megajoule range, which appeared to make ICF impractical for fusion energy production. For instance, the [[National Ignition Facility]] (NIF) uses about 330&amp;nbsp;MJ of electrical power to pump the driver lasers, and in the best case is expected to produce about 20&amp;nbsp;MJ of fusion power output.&lt;ref name="how"/&gt; Without dramatic gains in output, such a device would never be a practical energy source.

The fast ignition approach attempts to avoid these problems. Instead of using the shock wave to create the conditions needed for fusion above the ignition range, this approach directly heats the fuel. This is far more efficient than the shock wave, which becomes less important. In HiPER, the compression provided by the driver is "good", but not nearly that created by larger devices like NIF; HiPER's driver is about 200&amp;nbsp;kJ and produces densities of about 300&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. That's about one-third that of NIF, and about the same as generated by the earlier [[NOVA laser]] of the 1980s. For comparison, lead is about 11&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, so this still represents a considerable amount of compression, notably when one considers the target's interior contained light D-T fuel around 0.1&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=hiper&gt;Dunne, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignition is started by a very-short (~10&amp;nbsp;picoseconds) ultra-high-power (~70&amp;nbsp;kJ, 4&amp;nbsp;PW) laser pulse, aimed through a hole in the plasma at the core. The light from this pulse interacts with the fuel, generating a shower of high-energy (3.5&amp;nbsp;MeV) relativistic electrons that are driven into the fuel. The electrons heat a spot on one side of the dense core, and if this heating is localised enough it is expected to drive the area well beyond ignition energies.&lt;ref name=hiper/&gt;

The overall efficiency of this approach is many times that of the conventional approach. In the case of NIF the laser generates about 4&amp;nbsp;MJ of [[infrared]] power to create ignition that releases about 20&amp;nbsp;MJ of energy.&lt;ref name=how/&gt; This corresponds to a "fusion gain" —the ratio of input laser power to output fusion power— of about 5. If one uses the baseline assumptions for the current HiPER design, the two lasers (driver and heater) produce about 270&amp;nbsp;kJ in total, yet generate 25 to 30&amp;nbsp;MJ, a gain of about 100.&lt;ref name=hiper/&gt; Considering a variety of losses, the actual gain is predicted to be around 72.&lt;ref name=hiper/&gt; Not only does this outperform NIF by a wide margin, the smaller lasers are much less expensive to build as well. In terms of power-for-cost, HiPER is expected to be about an [[order of magnitude]] less expensive than conventional devices like NIF.

Compression is already a fairly well-understood problem, and HiPER is primarily interested in exploring the precise physics of the rapid heating process. It is not clear how quickly the electrons stop in the fuel load; while this is known for matter under normal pressures, it's not for the ultra-dense conditions of the compressed fuel. To work efficiently, the electrons should stop in as short a distance as possible, to release their energy into a small spot and thus raise the temperature (energy per unit volume) as high as possible.

How to get the laser light onto that spot is also a matter for further research. One approach uses a short pulse from another laser to heat the plasma outside the dense "core", essentially burning a hole through it and exposing the dense fuel inside. This approach will be tested on the [[Laboratory for Laser Energetics|OMEGA-EP]] system in the US. Another approach, tested successfully on the [[GEKKO XII]] laser in Japan, uses a small gold cone that cuts through a small area of the target shell; on heating no plasma is created in this area, leaving a hole that can be aimed into by shining the laser into the inner surface of the cone. HiPER is currently planning on using the gold cone approach, but will likely study the burning solution as well.&lt;ref name=hiper/&gt;

==Current status==
{{Update|section|date=December 2013}}
In 2005 HiPER completed a preliminary study outlining possible approaches and arguments for its construction. The report received positive reviews from the EC in July 2007, and moved onto a preparatory design phase in early 2008 with detailed designs for construction beginning in 2011 or 2012.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In parallel, the HiPER project also proposes to build smaller laser systems with higher repetition rates. The high-powered flash lamps used to pump the laser amplifier glass causes it to deform, and it cannot be fired again until it cools off, which takes as long as a day. Additionally only a very small amount of the flash of white light generated by the tubes is of the right frequency to be absorbed by the Nd:glass and thus lead to amplification, in general only about 1 to 1.5% of the energy fed into the tubes ends up in the laser beam.&lt;ref&gt;Dunne, 2007, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Key to avoiding these problems is replacing the flash lamps with more efficient pumps, typically based on [[laser diode]]s. These are far more efficient at generating light from electricity, and thus run much cooler. More importantly, the light they do generate is fairly monochromatic and can be tuned to frequencies that can be easily absorbed. This means that much less power needs to be used to produce any particular amount of laser light, further reducing the overall amount of heat being generated. The improvement in efficiency can be dramatic; existing experimental devices operate at about 10% overall efficiency, and it is believed "near term" devices will improve this as high as 20%.&lt;ref name=design&gt;Dunne, 2007, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

HiPER proposes to build a demonstrator diode-pump system producing 10&amp;nbsp;kJ at 1&amp;nbsp;Hz or 1&amp;nbsp;kJ at 10&amp;nbsp;Hz depending on a design choice yet to be made. The best high-repetition lasers currently operating are much smaller; [[Mercury laser|Mercury]] at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Livermore]] is about 70&amp;nbsp;J, HALNA in Japan at ~20&amp;nbsp;J, and LUCIA in France at ~100&amp;nbsp;J. HiPER's demonstrator would thus be between 10 and 500 times as powerful as any of these.&lt;ref name=hiper/&gt;

To make a practical commercial power generator, the high-gain of a device like HiPER would have to be combined with a high-repetition rate laser and a target chamber capable of extracting the power.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Additional areas of research for post-HiPER devices include practical methods to carry the heat out of the target chamber for power production, protecting the device from the [[neutron]] flux generated by the fusion reactions, and the production of [[tritium]] from this flux to produce more fuel for the reactor.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

{{Update-EB|date=January 2011}}

In [[geology]], '''igneous differentiation''', or '''magmatic differentiation''', is an umbrella term for the various processes by which [[magma]]s undergo bulk chemical change during the [[partial melting]] process, cooling, [[Intrusive rock|emplacement]], or [[volcanic eruption|eruption]].

==Definitions==

===Primary melts===
When a rock melts to form a liquid, the liquid is known as a ''primary melt''. Primary melts have not undergone any differentiation and represent the starting composition of a magma. In nature, primary melts are rarely seen. Some [[leucosomes]] of [[migmatite]]s are examples of primary melts. Primary melts derived from the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] are especially important and are known as ''primitive melts'' or primitive magmas. By finding the primitive magma composition of a magma series, it is possible to model the composition of the rock from which a melt was formed, which is important because we have little direct evidence of the Earth's mantle.

===Parental melts===
Where it is impossible to find the primitive or primary magma composition, it is often useful to attempt to identify a parental melt. A parental melt is a magma composition from which the observed range of magma chemistries has been derived by the processes of igneous differentiation. It need not be a primitive melt.

For instance, a series of [[basalt]] lava flows is assumed to be related to one another. A composition from which they could reasonably be produced by [[fractional crystallization (geology)|fractional crystallization]] is termed a ''parental melt''. To prove this, fractional crystallization models would be produced to test the hypothesis that they share a common parental melt.

===Cumulate rocks===
{{main|Cumulate rocks}}
Fractional crystallization and accumulation of crystals formed during the differentiation process of a magmatic event are known as ''cumulate rocks'', and those parts are the first which crystallize out of the magma. Identifying whether a rock is a cumulate or not is crucial for understanding if it can be modelled back to a primary melt or a primitive melt, and identifying whether the magma has dropped out cumulate minerals is equally important even for rocks which carry no [[phenocryst]]s.

==Underlying causes of differentiation==
The primary cause of change in the composition of a magma is ''cooling'', which is an inevitable consequence of the magma being created and migrating from the site of partial melting into an area of lower stress - generally a cooler volume of the crust.

Cooling causes the magma to begin to crystallize [[minerals]] from the melt or liquid portion of the magma. Most magmas are a mixture of liquid rock (melt) and minerals (phenocrysts).

Contamination is another cause of magma differentiation. Contamination can be caused by ''assimilation'' of wall rocks, mixing of two or more magmas or even by replenishment of the magma chamber with fresh, hot magma.

The whole gamut of mechanisms for differentiation has been referred to as the FARM process, which stands for '''F'''ractional crystallization, '''A'''ssimilation, '''R'''eplenishment and '''M'''agma mixing.

===Fractional crystallization of igneous rocks===
[[Fractional crystallization (geology)|Fractional crystallization]] is the removal and segregation from a melt of [[mineral]] precipitates, which changes the composition of the melt. This is one of the most important geochemical and physical processes operating within the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] and [[Earth's mantle|mantle]].

Fractional crystallization in silicate melts ([[magma]]s) is a very complex process compared to chemical systems in the laboratory because it is affected by a wide variety of phenomena. Prime amongst these are the composition, temperature, and pressure of a magma during its cooling.

The composition of a magma is the primary control on which mineral is crystallized as the melt cools down past the [[liquidus]]. For instance in [[mafic]] and [[ultramafic]] melts, the MgO and SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contents determine whether [[forsterite]] [[olivine]] is precipitated or whether [[enstatite]] [[pyroxene]] is precipitated.

Two magmas of similar composition and temperature at different pressure may crystallize different minerals. An example is high-pressure and high-temperature fractional crystallization of [[granite]]s to produce single-[[feldspar]] granite, and low-pressure low-temperature conditions which produce two-feldspar granites.

The [[partial pressure]] of volatile phases in silicate melts is also of prime importance, especially in near-[[solidus (chemistry)|solidus]] crystallization of granites.

===Assimilation===
Assimilation is a popular mechanism for explaining the felsification of [[ultramafic]] and [[mafic]] magmas as they rise through the crust. Assimilation assumes that a hot primitive melt intruding into a cooler, [[felsic]] crust will melt the [[crust (geology)|crust]] and mix with the resulting melt. This then alters the composition of the primitive magma.

Effects of this kind are to be expected, and have been clearly proven in many places.  There is, however, a general reluctance to admit that they are of great importance.  The nature and succession of the [[List of rock types|rock types]] do not as a rule show any relation to the [[sedimentary]] or other materials which may be supposed to have been dissolved; and where solution is known to have gone on the products are usually of abnormal character and easily distinguishable from the common rock types.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|title=Petrology | inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replenishment===
When a melt undergoes cooling along the liquid line of descent, the results are limited to the production of a homogeneous solid body of intrusive rock, with uniform mineralogy and composition, or a partially differentiated [[cumulate rocks|cumulate]] mass with layers, compositional zones and so on. This behaviour is fairly predictable and easy enough to prove with geochemical investigations. In such cases, a magma chamber will form a close approximation of the ideal [[Bowen's reaction series]]. However, most magmatic systems are polyphase events, with several pulses of magmatism. In such a case, the liquid line of descent is interrupted by the injection of a fresh batch of hot, undifferentiated magma. This can cause extreme fractional crystallisation because of three main effects:

* Additional heat provides additional energy to allow more vigorous convection, allows [[resorption]] of existing mineral phases back into the melt, and can cause a higher-temperature form of a mineral or other higher-temperature minerals to begin precipitating
* Fresh magma changes the composition of the melt, changing the chemistry of the phases which are being precipitated. For instance, [[plagioclase]] conforms to the liquid line of descent by forming initial [[anorthite]] which, if removed, changes the equilibrium mineral composition to [[oligoclase]] or [[albite]]. Replenishment of the magma can see this trend reversed, so that more anorthite is precipitated atop cumulate layers of albite.
* Fresh magma destabilises minerals which are precipitating as [[solid solution]] series or on a [[eutectic]]; a change in composition and temperature can cause extremely rapid crystallisation of certain mineral phases which are undergoing a eutectic crystallisation phase.

===Magma mixing===
Magma mixing is the process by which two magmas meet, comingle, and form a magma of a composition somewhere between the two end-member magmas.

Magma mixing is a common process in volcanic magma chambers, which are open-system chambers where magmas enter the chamber, undergo some form of assimilation, fractional crystallisation and partial melt extraction (via eruption of [[lava]]), and are replenished.

Magma mixing also tends to occur at deeper levels in the crust and is considered one of the primary mechanisms for forming intermediate rocks such as [[monzonite]] and [[andesite]]. Here, due to heat transfer and increased volatile flux from [[subduction]], the silicic crust melts to form a felsic magma (essentially granitic in composition). These [[granite|granitic]] melts are known as an ''underplate''. [[Basalt]]ic primary melts formed in the mantle beneath the crust rise and mingle with the underplate magmas, the result being part-way between basalt and [[rhyolite]]; literally an 'intermediate' composition.

===Other mechanisms of differentiation===
'''''Interface entrapment'''''
Convection in a large magma chamber is subject to the interplay of forces generated by thermal convection and the resistance offered by friction, viscosity and drag on the magma offered by the walls of the magma chamber. Often near the margins of a magma chamber which is convecting, cooler and more viscous layers form concentrically from the outside in, defined by breaks in viscosity and temperature. This forms [[laminar flow]], which separates several domains of the magma chamber which can begin to differentiate separately.

[[Flow banding]] is the result of a process of fractional crystallization which occurs by convection, if the crystals which are caught in the flow-banded margins are removed from the melt. The friction and [[viscosity]] of the magma causes [[phenocrysts]] and [[xenoliths]] within the magma or lava to slow down near the interface and become trapped in a viscous layer.  This can change the composition of the melt in large [[intrusion]]s, leading to differentiation.

'''''Partial melt extraction'''''&lt;br&gt;
With reference to the definitions, above, a magma chamber will tend to cool down and crystallize minerals according to the liquid line of descent. When this occurs, especially in conjunction with zonation and crystal accumulation, and the melt portion is removed, this can change the composition of a magma chamber. In fact, this is basically fractional crystallization, except in this case we are observing a magma chamber which is the remnant left behind from which a daughter melt has been extracted.

If such a magma chamber continues to cool, the minerals it forms and its overall composition will not match a sample liquid line of descent or a parental magma composition.

==Typical behaviours of magma chambers==
It is worth reiterating that magma chambers are not usually static single entities. The typical magma chamber is formed from a series of injections of melt and magma, and most are also subject to some form of partial melt extraction.

[[Granite]] magmas are generally much more viscous than [[mafic]] magmas and are usually more homogeneous in composition. This is generally considered to be caused by the viscosity of the magma,  which is orders of magnitude higher than mafic magmas. The higher viscosity means that, when melted, a granitic magma will tend to move in a larger concerted mass and be emplaced as a larger mass because it is less fluid and able to move. This is why granites tend to occur as large [[intrusion|pluton]]s, and mafic rocks as [[Dike (geology)|dikes]] and [[Sill (geology)|sills]].

Granites are cooler and are therefore less able to melt and assimilate country rocks. Wholesale contamination is therefore minor and unusual, although mixing of granitic and basaltic melts is not unknown where basalt is injected into granitic magma chambers.

Mafic magmas are more liable to flow, and are therefore more likely to undergo periodic replenishment of a magma chamber. Because they are more fluid, crystal precipitation occurs much more rapidly, resulting in greater changes by fractional crystallisation. Higher temperatures also allow mafic magmas to assimilate wall rocks more readily and therefore contamination is more common and better developed.

===Dissolved gases===
All igneous magmas contain dissolved gases ([[water]], [[carbonic acid]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], chlorine, fluorine, [[boric acid]], etc.).
Of these water is the principal, and was formerly believed to have percolated downwards from the Earth's surface to the heated rocks below, but is now generally admitted to be an integral part of the magma.  Many peculiarities of the structure of the plutonic rocks as contrasted with the lavas may reasonably be accounted for by the operation of these gases, which were unable to escape as the deep-seated masses slowly cooled, while they were promptly given up by the superficial effusions.  The acid plutonic or intrusive rocks have never been reproduced by laboratory experiments, and the only successful attempts to obtain their minerals artificially have been those in which special provision was made for the retention of the "mineralizing" gases in the crucibles or sealed tubes employed. These gases often do not enter into the composition of the rock-forming minerals, for most of these are free from water, carbonic acid, etc.  Hence as crystallization goes on the residual melt must contain an ever-increasing proportion of volatile constituents. It is conceivable that in the final stages the still uncrystallized part of the magma has more resemblance to a solution of mineral matter in superheated steam than to a dry igneous fusion.  [[Quartz]], for example, is the last mineral to form in a granite.  It bears much of the stamp of the quartz which we know has been deposited from [[aqueous solution]] in [[Vein (geology)|veins]], etc.  It is at the same time the most infusible of all the common minerals of rocks.  Its late formation shows that in this case it arose at comparatively low temperatures and points clearly to the special importance of the gases of the magma as determining the sequence of crystallization.

When solidification is nearly complete the gases can no longer be retained in the rock and make their escape through fissures towards the surface.  They are powerful agents in attacking the minerals of the rocks which they traverse, and instances of their operation are found in the [[kaolin]]ization of granites, [[Tourmaline|tourmalinization]] and formation of [[greisen]], deposition of quartz veins, and the group of changes known as propylitization.  These "pneumatolytic" processes are of the first importance in the genesis of many [[Ore|ore deposits]].  They are a real part of the history of the magma itself and constitute the terminal phases of the volcanic sequence.&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt;

== Quantifying igneous differentiation ==
There are several methods of directly measuring and quantifying igneous differentiation processes;
* Whole rock geochemistry of representative samples, to track changes and evolution of the magma systems
** Using the above, calculating [[normative mineralogy]] and investigating trends
* Trace element geochemistry
* [[Isotope geochemistry]]
** Investigating the contamination of magma systems by [[Country rock (geology)|wall rock]] assimilation using radiogenic isotopes

In all cases, the primary and most valuable method for identifying magma differentiation processes is mapping the exposed rocks, tracking mineralogical changes within the igneous rocks and describing field relationships and [[rock microstructure|textural]] evidence for magma differentiation.

A '''lava tube''' is a natural conduit formed by flowing [[lava]] which moves beneath the hardened surface of a lava flow. Tubes can drain lava from a [[volcano]] during an eruption, or can be extinct, meaning the lava flow has ceased, and the rock has cooled and left a long [[cave]].

==Formation==
A lava tube is a type of [[lava cave]] formed when a low-[[viscosity]] lava flow develops a continuous and hard crust, which thickens and forms a roof above the still-flowing lava stream. Tubes form in one of two ways:  either by the crusting over of [[lava channel]]s, or from [[pāhoehoe]] flows where the lava is moving under the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Lava usually leaves the point of [[volcanic eruption|eruption]] in channels. These channels tend to stay very hot as their surroundings cool. This means they slowly develop walls around them as the surrounding lava cools and/or as the channel melts its way deeper. These channels can get deep enough to crust over, forming an [[Thermal insulation|insulating]] tube that keeps the lava molten and serves as a conduit for the flowing lava. These types of lava tubes tend to be closer to the lava eruption point.

Farther away from the eruption point, lava can flow in an unchanneled, fan-like manner as it leaves its source, which is usually another lava tube leading back to the eruption point. Called pāhoehoe flows, these areas of surface-moving lava cool, forming either a smooth or rough, ropy surface. The lava continues to flow this way until it begins to block its source. At this point, the subsurface lava is still hot enough to break out at a point, and from this point the lava begins as a new "source". Lava flows from the previous source to this breakout point as the surrounding lava of the pāhoehoe flow cools. This forms an underground channel that becomes a lava tube.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodearthgraphics.com/virtual_tube/virtube.html The Virtual Lava Tube] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040726084601/http://www.goodearthgraphics.com/virtual_tube/virtube.html# |date=2004-07-26 }} ''goodearthgraphics.com'', Large educational site on lava tube features and how they form, with many photos, Retrieved 2018-06-19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
A broad lava-flow field often consists of a main lava tube and a series of smaller tubes that supply lava to the front of one or more separate flows. When the supply of lava stops at the end of an eruption or lava is diverted elsewhere, lava in the tube system drains downslope and leaves partially empty [[cave]]s.

Such drained tubes commonly exhibit step marks on their walls that mark the various depths at which the lava flowed, known as flow ledges or flow lines depending on how prominently they protrude from the walls. Lava tubes generally have [[pāhoehoe]] floors, although this may often be covered in breakdown from the ceiling.  A variety of [[speleothem]]s may be found in lava tubes&lt;ref name="Bunnell, 2008"&gt;{{cite book
 |title=Caves of Fire:Inside America's Lava Tubes
 |last=Bunnell
 |first=D.
 |year=2008
 |publisher=National Speleological Society, Huntsville, AL
 |isbn=978-1-879961-31-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including a variety of [[stalactite]] forms generally known as [[lavacicles]], which can be of the splash, [[shark]] tooth, or tubular variety. Lavacicles are the most common of lava tube speleothems. Drip [[stalagmite]]s may form under tubular lava stalactites, and the latter may grade into a form known as a tubular lava [[helictite]]. A runner is a bead of lava that is extruded from a small opening and then runs down a wall. Lava tubes may also contain [[mineral]] deposits that most commonly take the form of crusts or small [[crystal]]s, and less commonly, as stalactites and stalagmites. 

Lava tubes can be up to {{convert|14|-|15|m}} wide, though are often narrower, and run anywhere from {{convert|1|-|15|m}} below the surface. Lava tubes can also be extremely long; one tube from the [[Mauna Loa]] 1859 flow enters the ocean about {{convert|50|km|mi|sp=us}} from its eruption point, and the [[Icod de los Vinos#Cueva del Viento|Cueva del Viento–Sobrado]] system on [[Teide]], [[Tenerife]] island, is over {{convert|18|km|mi|sp=us}}  long, due to extensive braided maze areas at the upper zones of the system.

A lava tube system in [[Kiama]], [[Australia]], consists of over 20 tubes, many of which are breakouts of a main lava tube. The largest of these lava tubes is {{convert|2|m|ft|sp=us}} in diameter and has columnar jointing due to the large cooling surface. Other tubes have [[concentric]] and [[wikt:radial|radial]] jointing features. The tubes are infilled due to the low slope angle of emplacement.

==Extraterrestrial lava tubes== 
By far the largest known lava tubes in the Solar System are on Venus.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Graeme | last=Melville | date=1994 | title=Lava Tubes and Channels of the Earth, Venus, Moon and Mars | publisher=University of Wollongong | url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2859/ | accessdate=2016-04-11 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602192550/http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2859/# | archive-date=2016-06-02 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martian lava tubes]] are associated with innumerable lava flows and lava channels on the flanks of [[Olympus Mons]]. Partially collapsed lava tubes are visible as chains of pit craters, and broad lava fans formed by lava emerging from intact, subsurface tubes are also common.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2009/pdf/1527.pdf Richardson, J.W. et al.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7876">The following is a list of [[megafauna]] discovered by science since the beginning of the 19th century (with their respective date of discovery). Some of these may have been known to native peoples or reported [[anecdote|anecdotally]] but had not been generally acknowledged as confirmed by the scientific world, until conclusive evidence was obtained for formal studies. In other cases, certain animals were initially considered hoaxes - similar to the initial reception of mounted specimens of the duck-billed [[platypus]] ''Ornithorhynchus anatinus'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/Hoaxipedia/Duckbilled_Platypus/ Duckbilled Platypus] ''Museum of Hoaxes''.&lt;/ref&gt; in late 18th-century Europe.

The definition of megafauna varies, but this list includes some of the more notable examples.

This article lists notable military accidents involving nuclear material. Civilian accidents are listed at [[List of civilian nuclear accidents]]. For a general discussion of both civilian and military accidents, see [[nuclear and radiation accidents]].

==Scope of this article==
In listing military nuclear accidents, the following criteria have been adopted:
# There must be well-attested and substantial health damage, property damage or contamination.
# The damage must be related directly to radioactive material, not merely (for example) at a nuclear power plant.
# To qualify as "military", the nuclear operation/material must be principally for military purposes.
# To qualify as "accident", the damage should not be intentional, unlike in [[nuclear warfare]].

==1940s==
*June 23, 1942 &amp;ndash; [[Leipzig L-IV experiment accident]] &amp;ndash; [[Leipzig]], [[Federal Republic of Germany|Germany]] (then [[Nazi Germany]]) &amp;ndash; Steam explosion and reactor fire
**Shortly after the Leipzig L-IV [[atomic pile]]—worked on by [[Werner Heisenberg]] and [[Robert Doepel]]—demonstrated Germany's first signs of neutron propagation, the device was checked for a possible [[heavy water]] leak. During the inspection, air leaked in, igniting the uranium powder inside. The burning uranium boiled the water jacket, generating enough steam pressure to blow the reactor apart. Burning uranium powder scattered throughout the lab causing a larger fire at the facility.&lt;ref&gt;R. Döpel (1941 bzw. 1942), [http://www.deutsches-museum.de/archiv/archiv-online/geheimdokumente/forschungszentren/leipzig/unfaelle/dokument-1/ Beschreibung zweier Unfälle mit Uranoxid].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goudsmit |first=S.

*August 21, 1945 &amp;ndash; [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]], [[United States]] &amp;ndash; Accidental criticality
**[[Harry Daghlian]] dropped a [[tungsten carbide]] brick onto a [[plutonium]] core, inadvertently creating a [[criticality accident|critical mass]] at the Los Alamos Omega site. He quickly removed the brick, but was fatally [[radiation poisoning|irradiated]], dying September 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Harry K. Daghlian, Jr.: America's First Peacetime Atom Bomb Fatality | url =  http://members.tripod.com/~Arnold_Dion/Daghlian/ | accessdate = 2007-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*May 21, 1946 &amp;ndash; [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], Los Alamos, [[New Mexico]], United States &amp;ndash; Accidental criticality
**While demonstrating his technique to visiting scientists at Los Alamos, Canadian [[Nuclear physics|physicist]] [[Louis Slotin]] manually assembled a [[critical mass (nuclear)|critical mass]] of [[plutonium]]. A momentary slip of a screwdriver caused a [[prompt critical]] reaction. Slotin died on May 30 from massive radiation poisoning, with an estimated dose of 1,000 [[rad (unit)|rad]]s (rad), or 10 [[gray (unit)|grays]] (Gy). Seven observers, who received doses as high as 166 rads, survived, yet three died within a few decades from conditions believed to be radiation-related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/19/magazine/america-s-radiation-victims-the-hidden-files.html | title=AMERICA'S RADIATION VICTIMS: The Hidden Files | author=Clifford T. Honicker | magazine=The New York Times Magazine | date=November 19, 1989 | accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the above incidents, both Daghlian (August 21, 1945 case) and Slotin (May 21, 1946 case), were working with the same bomb core which became known as the "[[demon core]]." It was later melted down and combined with existing weapons-grade material.

==1950s==
*February 13, 1950 – [[1950 British Columbia B-36 crash]] – A simulated nuclear bomb containing TNT and uranium but without the plutonium needed to create a nuclear explosion, was proactively dumped in the Pacific Ocean after a [[Convair B-36 Peacemaker|B-36]] bomber's engines caught fire during a test of its ability to carry nuclear payloads.The crew reported releasing the weapon out of concern for the amount of TNT inside, alone, before they bailed out of the aircraft. The bomber eventually crashed at an unknown location in Canada and four years later the wreckage was found and searched, but no bomb was found. The weapon was briefly thought to have been located by a civilian diver in 2016 near [[Pitt Island (Canada)|Pitt Island]] but this was subsequently found not to be the case.&lt;ref name=king&gt;{{cite news |last=Levinson-King |first=Robin |date=7 November 2016 |title=Nuclear weapon missing since 1950 'may have been found' |publisher=BBC |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37875697 |accessdate=November 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**A [[United States Air Force|USAF]] [[Convair B-36 Peacemaker|B-36]] [[Bomber aircraft|bomber]], [[1950 British Columbia B-36 crash|AF Ser. No. 44-92075]], was flying a simulated combat mission from [[Eielson Air Force Base]], near [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], to [[Carswell Air Force Base]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], [[Texas]], carrying one weapon containing a dummy warhead. The warhead contained conventional explosives and natural uranium but lacked the plutonium [[pit (nuclear weapon)|core]] of an actual weapon. After six hours of flight, the bomber experienced mechanical problems and was forced to shut down three of its six engines at an altitude of {{convert|12000|ft}}. Fearing that severe weather and icing would jeopardize a safe emergency landing, the weapon was jettisoned over the Pacific Ocean from a height of {{convert|8000|ft|abbr=on}}. The weapon's [[high explosive]]s detonated upon impact with a bright flash visible. All of the sixteen crew members and one passenger were able to parachute from the plane and twelve were subsequently rescued from [[Princess Royal Island]].&lt;ref name=Tiwari&gt;{{cite web | author = Tiwari J, Gray CJ | title = U.S. Nuclear Weapons Accidents  | url = http://www.cdi.org/Issues/NukeAccidents/accidents.htm | accessdate = 2007-06-17 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120423145613/http://www.cdi.org/issues/nukeaccidents/accidents.htm | archivedate = 2012-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*April 11, 1950 – [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], US – Loss and recovery of nuclear materials
**Three minutes after departure from [[Kirtland Air Force Base]] in Albuquerque a USAF [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 bomber]] carrying a nuclear weapon, four spare detonators, and a crew of thirteen crashed into a mountain near [[Manzano Base]]. The crash resulted in a fire that ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported as being visible from {{convert|15|mi}}. The bomb's casing was demolished and its high explosives ignited upon contact with the plane's burning fuel. However, according to the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], the four spare detonators and all nuclear components were recovered. A nuclear detonation was not possible because, while on board, the weapon's [[pit (nuclear weapon)|core]] was not in the weapon for safety reasons. All thirteen crew members died.&lt;ref name=Tiwari /&gt;
*July 13, 1950 – [[Lebanon, Ohio|Lebanon]], [[Ohio]], US –  Non-nuclear detonation of an atomic bomb
**A USAF [[B-50 Superfortress|B-50]] aircraft on a training mission from [[Biggs Army Airfield|Biggs Air Force Base]] with a nuclear weapon flew into the ground resulting in a high-explosive detonation, but no nuclear explosion.&lt;ref name="AFRRI"/&gt;
* August 5, 1950 – [[Travis Air Force Base|Fairfield-Suisun AFB]], [[California]], US – Non-nuclear detonation of an atomic bomb
** A USAF [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 bomber]] [[1950 Fairfield-Suisun Boeing B-29 crash|AF Ser. No. 44-87651]] with a [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb]] on board, flying to [[Guam]] experienced malfunctions with two propellers and with landing gear retraction during take-off and crashed while attempting an emergency landing at Fairfield Suisun-AFB. In the resulting fire, the bomb's high-explosive material exploded, killing nineteen people from the crew and rescue personnel. [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Robert F. Travis]], command pilot of the bomber, was among the dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/Travis_B-29_crash_site.htm The Crash of the B-29 on Travis AFB, CA August 5, 1950], ''Check-six.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;      
*November 10, 1950 – [[Rivière-du-Loup]], [[Québec]], Canada – Non-nuclear detonation of an atomic bomb
**Returning one of several U.S. [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb]]s secretly deployed in Canada, a USAF [[B-50 Superfortress|B-50]] [[1950 Rivière-du-Loup B-50 nuclear weapon loss incident|had engine trouble and jettisoned the weapon]] at {{convert|10500|ft}}. The crew set the bomb to self-destruct at {{convert|2500|ft|abbr=on}} and dropped over the [[St. Lawrence River]]. The explosion shook area residents and scattered nearly {{convert|100|lb}} of uranium (U-238) used in the weapon's tamper. The plutonium [[pit (nuclear weapon)|core]] was not in the bomb at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Norris |first=Robert S. |last2=Arkin |first2=William M. |last3=Burr |first3=William |title=Where they were |journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |year=1999 |volume=55 |issue=6 |pages=26–35 |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~sanders/214/other/news/nd99norris.pdf &lt;!-- http://www.bullatomsci.org/issues/1999/nd99/nd99norris.html is a dead link --&gt;|doi=10.2968/055006011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bravo Fallout.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The [[Castle Bravo]] fallout pattern.]]
*March 1, 1954 – [[Bikini Atoll]], [[Marshall Islands|Republic of the Marshall Islands]] (then [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]]) – Nuclear test accident
**During the [[Castle Bravo test]] of the first deployable [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bomb]], a miscalculation resulted in the explosion being over twice as large as predicted, with a total explosive force of {{convert|15|MtonTNT|lk=on}}. Of the total yield, {{convert|10|MtonTNT|lk=in|abbr=on}} were from fission of the natural uranium tamper, but those fission reactions were quite [[Dirty bomb#Other uses of the term|dirty]], producing a large amount of [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]]. Combined with the much larger than expected yield and an unanticipated wind shift, [[nuclear radiation|radioactive]] fallout spread into unexpected areas. A Japanese [[fishing boat]], the ''[[Daigo Fukuryū Maru|Daigo Fukuryu Maru/Lucky Dragon]]'', came into contact with the fallout, which caused many of the crew to become ill, with one fatality. The fallout spread eastward onto the inhabited [[Rongelap Atoll|Rongelap]] and [[Rongerik Atoll]]s. These islands were not evacuated before the explosion due to the unanticipated fallout zone and the financial cost involved, but many of the [[Marshall Islands]] natives have since suffered from radiation burns and radioactive [[dust]]ing and also similar fates as the Japanese fishermen and have received little, if any, compensation from the [[U.S. government|federal government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Renee Lewis | title = Bikinians evacuated ‘for good of mankind’ endure lengthy nuclear fallout | url = http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/7/28/bikini-nuclear-test-survivors-demand-compensation.html | date = 2015-07-28 | accessdate = 2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test resulted in an international uproar and reignited Japanese concerns about radiation, especially with regard to the possible [[Radioactive contamination|contamination]] of fish. Personal accounts of the Rongelap people can be seen in the documentary ''Children of Armageddon''.
*November 29, 1955 – [[Idaho]], US – Partial meltdown

*March 10, 1956 – Over the [[Mediterranean Sea]] – Nuclear weapons lost

*September 11, 1957 – [[Rocky Flats Plant]], [[Golden, Colorado|Golden]], [[Colorado]], US – Fire, release of nuclear materials
**A fire began in a theoretically fireproof area inside the [[plutonium]] processing building, in a [[glovebox]] used to handle radioactive materials, igniting the combustible rubber gloves and [[plexiglas]] windows of the box.  The fire quickly spread to the plutonium as various safety features failed. The fire spread through the ventilation system as the containment ability of the facility became compromised, with plumes of radioactive smoke sent high into the outside air. The fire raged inside the building for 13 hours over the night of the 11th &amp; 12th before firefighters could finally extinguish it. In the aftermath, Department of Energy officials, and the Dow Chemical officials who ran the facility, did not admit the extent of the catastrophe, or the radiation danger, to local officials or the media. Knowledge of the extent of the damage and contamination was kept from the public for years. After the fire, plutonium was detected near a school {{convert|12|miles|km}} away and around [[Denver]] {{convert|17|miles|km}} away. An independent group of scientists conducting off-site testing 13 years later found plutonium contamination in areas in nearby Rocky Flats to be 400 to 1,500 times higher than normal, higher than any ever recorded near any urban area, including [[Atomic bombing of Nagasaki|Nagasaki]].

*October 8–12, 1957 – [[Sellafield]], [[Cumbria]], UK – Reactor core fire
**''See [[Windscale fire]]''. Technicians mistakenly overheated Windscale [[Pile (nuclear reactor)|Pile]] No. 1 during an [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] process to release [[Wigner energy]] from [[graphite]] portions of the reactor. Poorly placed temperature sensors indicated the reactor was cooling rather than heating. The excess heat led to the failure of a nuclear cartridge, which in turn allowed uranium and irradiated graphite to react with air. The resulting fire burned for days, damaging a significant portion of the reactor core. About 150 burning fuel cells could not be lifted from the core, but operators succeeded in creating a [[firebreak]] by removing nearby fuel cells. An effort to cool the graphite core with water eventually quenched the fire. The reactor had released radioactive gases into the surrounding countryside, primarily in the form of [[iodine-131]] (&lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I). [[Milk]] distribution was banned in a {{convert|200|sqmi|adj=on}} area around the reactor for several weeks. A 1987 report by the National Radiological Protection Board predicted the accident would cause as many as 33 long-term cancer deaths, although the Medical Research Council Committee concluded that "it is in the highest degree unlikely that any harm has been done to the health of anybody, whether a worker in the Windscale plant or a member of the general public." The reactor that burned was one of two air-cooled, graphite-moderated natural uranium reactors at the site used for production of [[plutonium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Windscale Nuclear Incident | work = The Virtual Nuclear Tourist | url = http://www.nucleartourist.com/events/windscal.htm | date = 2005-12-22 | accessdate = 2007-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The 1957 Windscale Fire | url = http://www.lakestay.co.uk/1957.htm | accessdate = 2007-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sellafield | work = United Kingdom Nuclear Forces | url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/uk/sellafield.htm | date = 2005-04-28 | accessdate = 2007-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*February 1965 &amp;ndash; ''[[Lenin (nuclear icebreaker)|Lenin]]'', a Soviet nuclear icebreaker, suffered a [[loss-of-coolant accident]]. After being shut down for refueling, the coolant was removed from the number two reactor before the [[Spent nuclear fuel|spent fuel]] had been removed. As a result, some of the fuel elements melted and deformed inside the reactor. This was discovered when the spent elements were being unloaded for storage and disposal. 124 fuel assemblies (about 60% of the total) were stuck in the reactor core. It was decided to remove the fuel, control grid, and [[control rod]]s as a unit for disposal; they were placed in a special cask, solidified, stored for two years, and dumped in Tsivolki Bay, in the [[Novaya Zemlya]] archipelago, in 1967.

**A USAF B-52 carrying four hydrogen bombs collided with a [[United States Air Force|USAF]] [[KC-135]] [[tanker aircraft|jet tanker]] during over-ocean [[in-flight refueling]]. Four of the B-52's seven crew members parachuted to safety while the remaining three were killed along with all four of the KC-135's crew. The conventional explosives in two of the bombs detonated upon impact with the ground, dispersing plutonium over nearby farms. A third bomb landed intact near [[Palomares, Almería|Palomares]] while the fourth fell {{convert|12|mi}} off the coast into the Mediterranean sea. The U.S. Navy conducted a three-month search involving 12,000 men and successfully recovered the fourth bomb. The U.S. Navy employed the use of the deep-diving research submarine [[DSV Alvin|DSV ''Alvin'']] to aid in the recovery efforts. During the ensuing cleanup, {{convert|1500|t|ST|lk=on}} of radioactive soil and tomato plants were shipped to a nuclear dump in [[Aiken, South Carolina]]. The U.S. settled claims by 522 Palomares residents for [[United States dollar|$]]600,000. The town also received a $200,000 [[desalinization]] plant. The motion picture ''[[Men of Honor]]'' (2000), starring [[Cuba Gooding, Jr.]], as [[United States Navy|USN]] Diver, Master Chief Petty Officer Carl Brashear, and [[Robert De Niro]] as USN Diver, Chief Petty Officer Billy Sunday, contained an account of the fourth bomb's recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/09/11/europe/journal.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914002703/http://iht.com/articles/2008/09/11/europe/journal.php |archivedate=2008-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1967 &amp;ndash; ''[[Lenin (nuclear icebreaker)|Lenin]]'', a Soviet nuclear icebreaker, suffered a second accident; a cooling system leak which occurred in 1967, shortly after refueling. Finding the leak required breaking through the concrete and metal biological shield with [[sledgehammer]]s. Once the leak was found, it became apparent that the sledgehammer damage could not be repaired; subsequently, all three reactors were removed, and replaced by two OK-900 reactors, by early 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |title=Nuclear icebreaker ''Lenin'' |url=http://www.bellona.org/english_import_area/international/russia/civilian_nuclear_vessels/icebreakers/30131 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015031630/http://www.bellona.org/english_import_area/international/russia/civilian_nuclear_vessels/icebreakers/30131 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-15 |work=Russian nuclear icebreaker fleet |publisher=www.bellona.org |accessdate=2013-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

**A fire broke out in the [[navigator]]'s compartment of a USAF [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] near [[Thule Air Base]], [[Greenland]]. The bomber crashed {{convert|7|mi}} from the air base, rupturing its nuclear payload of four hydrogen bombs. The recovery and decontamination effort was complicated by Greenland's harsh weather. Contaminated ice and debris were buried in the United States. Bomb fragments were recycled by [[Pantex]], in [[Amarillo, Texas]]. The incident caused outrage and protests in Denmark, as Greenland is a Danish possession and Denmark forbade nuclear weapons on its territory.
*May 22, 1968 &amp;ndash; 740&amp;nbsp;km (400 nmi) southwest of the [[Azores]] &amp;ndash;  Loss of nuclear reactor and two [[W34 (nuclear warhead)|W34]] nuclear warheads
**The [[United States Navy|U.S.]] [[submarine]] [[USS Scorpion (SSN-589)|USS ''Scorpion'' (SSN-589)]] sank while en route from [[Rota, Spain|Rota]], Spain, to [[Norfolk Naval Base|Norfolk]], [[Commonwealth of Virginia|Virginia]], USA.  The cause of sinking remains unknown; all 99 officers and men on board were killed.  The wreckage of the submarine, its [[S5W reactor|S5W]] [[nuclear reactor]], and its two [[Mark 45 torpedo|Mark 45]] torpedoes with [[W34 (nuclear warhead)|W34]] nuclear warheads, remain on the sea floor in more than 3,000 m (9,800&amp;nbsp;ft) of water.
*May 24, 1968 &amp;ndash; location unknown &amp;ndash; Loss of cooling, radioactive contamination, nuclear fuel damaged
**During sea trials, the Soviet nuclear submarine [[Soviet submarine K-27|''K-27'']] (Project 645) suffered severe problems with its reactor cooling systems. After spending some time at reduced power, reactor output inexplicably dropped and sensors detected an increase of [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]] in the reactor compartment to 150 [[rad (unit)|rad]]/h. The safety buffer tank released radioactive gases further contaminating the submarine. The crew shut the reactor down and subsequent investigation found that approximately 20% of the fuel assemblies were damaged. The entire submarine was scuttled in the [[Kara Sea]] in 1981.
*August 27, 1968 &amp;ndash; [[Severodvinsk]], Russia (then [[USSR]]) &amp;ndash; Reactor power excursion, contamination
**While in the naval yards at Severodvinsk for repairs, the Soviet [[Yankee class submarine|''Yankee''-class]] [[nuclear submarine]] [[Soviet submarine K-140|''K-140'']] suffered an uncontrolled increase of the reactor's power output. One of the reactors activated automatically when workers raised control rods to a higher position and power increased to 18 times normal, while pressure and temperature levels in the reactor increased to four times normal. The accident also increased radiation levels aboard the vessel. The problem was traced to the incorrect installation of control rod electrical cables.

*February 1982 to December 1989 &amp;ndash; The [[Andreev Bay nuclear accident]] was associated with leaks in a massive cooling and storage pool.  The leaks caused about 700,000 tonnes of highly radioactive water to leak into the Barents Sea during that time period. During the extensive period of attempted repairs and subsequent dismantling of the pool, other incidents occurred on site, including accidental accumulations of critical masses of material releasing radiation and an "industrial accident" that caused two cleanup workers to plunge directly into the radioactive pool. 
*August 8, 1982 &amp;ndash; While on duty in the [[Barents Sea]], there was a release of liquid metal coolant from the reactor of the Soviet Project 705 [[Alfa class submarine|''Alfa''-class submarine]] [[Soviet submarine K-123|''K-123'']]. The accident was caused by a leak in the steam generator. Approximately two tons of metal alloy leaked into the reactor compartment, irreparably damaging the reactor so it had to be replaced. It took nine years to repair the submarine.
*January 3, 1983 &amp;ndash; The Soviet nuclear-powered spy satellite [[Kosmos 1402]] burned up over the South Atlantic.
*August 10, 1985 &amp;ndash; About {{convert|35|mi}} from [[Vladivostok]] in [[Chazhma Bay]], the [[Soviet Navy|Soviet]] [[Echo class submarine|''Echo''-class]] [[Nuclear submarine|submarine]] [[Soviet submarine K-431|''K-431'']] suffered a reactor explosion, producing fatally high levels of radiation. Ten men were killed, but the deadly cloud of radioactivity did not reach [[Vladivostok]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = CNN | title = Cold War: Broken Arrows (1980b)| url = http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/experience/the.bomb/broken.arrows/content/1980b.html | publisher = CNN.com | year = 1998 | accessdate = 2007-06-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070328010005/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/experience/the.bomb/broken.arrows/content/1980b.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1986 &amp;ndash; The U.S. government declassified 19,000 pages of documents indicating that between 1946 and 1986, the [[Hanford Site]] near [[Richland, Washington]], released thousands of [[U.S. liquid gallon|US gallons]] of radioactive liquids. Many of the people living in the affected area received low doses of radiation from [[Iodine-131|&lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I]].
*October 3, 1986 &amp;ndash; {{convert|480|mi}} east of [[Bermuda]], the Soviet [[Yankee-I class submarine|''Yankee-I''-class]] [[Ballistic missile submarine|submarine]] [[Soviet submarine K-219|''K-219'']] experienced an explosion in one of its missile tubes and at least three crew members were killed. Sixteen nuclear missiles and two reactors were on board. [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet leader]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] privately communicated news of the disaster to [[President of the United States of America|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] before publicly acknowledging the incident on October 4. Two days later, on October 6, the submarine sank in the Atlantic Ocean while under tow in {{convert|18000|ft}} of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = CNN | title = Cold War: Broken Arrows (1980c)| url = http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/experience/the.bomb/broken.arrows/content/1980c.html | publisher = CNN.com | year = 1998 | accessdate = 2007-06-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070328010015/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/experience/the.bomb/broken.arrows/content/1980c.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*October 1988 &amp;ndash; At the nuclear trigger assembly facility at [[Rocky Flats Plant|Rocky Flats]] in [[Colorado]], two employees and a [[United States Department of Energy|D.O.E.]] inspector inhaled radioactive particles, causing closure of the plant. Several safety violations were cited, including uncalibrated monitors, inadequate fire equipment, and groundwater contaminated with radioactivity.

==1990s==
*1997 &amp;ndash; [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] soldiers suffered radiation poisoning and burns. They were eventually traced back to training sources abandoned, forgotten, and unlabeled after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. One was a [[Caesium-137|&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]] pellet in a pocket of a shared jacket which put out about 130,000 times the level of background radiation at 1 meter distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lluma | first=Diego | title = Former Soviet Union: What the Russians left behind | journal = Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |date=May–June 2000 | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 14–17 | doi=10.2968/056003005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2000s==
*August 12, 2000, [[Barents Sea]], the Russian submarine [[Kursk submarine disaster|Kursk sank]] during a naval exercise. All 118 on board were killed. The nuclear reactor compartment withstood the initial explosions, allowing the two reactors to [[scram|automatically shut down]] and prevent a [[nuclear meltdown]] and widespread contamination of the sea. Parts of the submarine were later raised and the nuclear reactors were successfully de-fueled.
*February 2003: [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] [[Y-12 National Security Complex|Y-12]] facility. During the final testing of a new saltless [[uranium]] processing method, there was a small explosion followed by a fire. The explosion occurred in an unvented vessel containing unreacted calcium, water and [[depleted uranium]]. An [[exothermic]] reaction in the vessel generated enough steam to burst the container. This small explosion breached its [[glovebox]], allowing air to enter and ignite some loose uranium powder. Three employees were contaminated. BWXT Y-12 (now B&amp;W Y-12), a partnership of [[BWXT|Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] and [[Bechtel]], was fined $82,500 for the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Parson P | title =  BWXT Y-12 fined for explosion, fire | url = http://nucnews.net/nucnews/2004nn/0406nn/040612nn.htm#010 | publisher = The Oak Ridger | date = 2004-06-11 | accessdate = 2007-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TCstaterainfall.gif|right|thumb|450px|Continental U.S. tropical cyclone rainfall maxima per state as of 2018|alt=Map showing the highest rainfall totals measured in certain regions of the continental United States as of 2018.]]
[[Tropical cyclone]]s move into the [[contiguous United States]] from the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]]. The highest rainfall totals in the country have been measured across the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] and lower portions of the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]]. Intermediate amounts have been measured across the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]], [[New England]], and the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. The northern [[Great Plains]] and [[Northwestern United States|Pacific Northwest]] have received the lowest amounts, as those regions lie exceptionally far from the [[tropical cyclogenesis|breeding grounds]] of [[North Atlantic tropical cyclone|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific hurricane|Eastern Pacific tropical cyclones]].

A measurement of {{convert|60.58|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rain during [[Hurricane Harvey]], in Southeast Texas, holds the record for the highest precipitation total observed with a tropical cyclone in the United States. [[Tropical Storm Claudette (1979)|Tropical Storm Claudette]] holds the national 24-hour rainfall record, recorded in Alvin, Texas with {{convert|42.00|in|mm|abbr=on}} observed within such a timeframe. Taking place only one year apart, in 1978 and 1979, tropical storms [[Tropical Storm Amelia (1978)|Amelia]] and Claudette are also among the wettest tropical cyclones on record in the United States and they both have occurred in [[Texas]]. Hurricanes [[Hurricane Hiki|Hiki]] and [[Hurricane Lane (2018)|Lane]] both dumped significant rainfall in the mountains of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]], each with approximately {{convert|52.00|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rainfall reported.

==Overall wettest in the contiguous United States==
Below is a list of the top ten highest storm total rainfall amounts from individual tropical cyclones across the contiguous United States since 1950. The remains of [[Tropical Storm Amelia (1978)|Amelia 1978]] led to the wettest storm total rainfall amounts of any tropical cyclone to impact the lower 48 over that time frame when it moved into Texas during early August 1978.&lt;ref name="WPCMAX"/&gt; It would not be surpassed until [[Hurricane Harvey]] in 2017, which dropped a maximum of 60.58&amp;nbsp;inches (1538.7&amp;nbsp;mm), making it the wettest tropical cyclone in the United States.&lt;ref name="WPCMAX"/&gt;

==Hawaii==
[[File:Lane_2018-08-21_2350Z.jpg|thumb|right|Hurricane Lane (2018)]]
This island state frequently sees rainfall from the remains of former eastern and central Pacific tropical cyclones. However, despite Hawaii's location in the subtropics, direct impacts by tropical cyclones are infrequent due to the protective influence of the Central Pacific Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough (TUTT), which normally dissipates systems approaching Hawaii. Hurricane Hiki in 1950 led to significant rainfall in the mountains, with {{convert|52|in|mm}} of rainfall reported.&lt;ref name="C1950"/&gt; This was the most rainfall reported to have been produced by a tropical cyclone within the United States until surpassed by Hurricane Harvey in 2017.&lt;ref name="WPCMAX"/&gt;

==Iowa==
Hurricane Carla was a large hurricane that moved into Texas during September 1961. As it transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] across the [[Great Plains]] and Midwest, heavy rain fell in a band on the poleward side of a frontal boundary extending northeast from Carla, leading to the wettest known event to be associated with a tropical cyclone or its remains across [[Iowa]].&lt;ref name="Mid West"/&gt;

Soon after moving inland, the [[1960 Texas tropical storm]] looped over South Texas, leading to heavy rains along the coastal plain near Port Lavaca. As it moved north-northeast, bursts of heavy rainfall were accompanied with the
system over Arkansas and [[Kentucky]]. The maximum in Kentucky not only represents their highest tropical cyclone-related rainfall amount on record, but also the state's all-time 24&amp;nbsp;hour precipitation record (through 1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roth, David M|author2=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/unnamed1960.html|title=Tropical Cyclone Point Maxima|chapter=Unnamed Tropical Storm&amp;nbsp;— June 22–29, 1960|accessdate=June 13, 2012|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Louisiana==
Heavy rains and flooding are the primary problem associated with tropical cyclones across the Pelican State. Recent examples of flooding across the state from tropical cyclones include [[Tropical Storm Allison]] in 2001, [[Tropical Storm Frances (1998)|Tropical Storm Frances]] in 1998, [[Tropical Storm Allison (1989)|Tropical Storm Allison]] in 1989, and [[Tropical Storm Claudette (1979)|Tropical Storm Claudette]] in 1979. Three of the four systems stalled across eastern Texas, prolonging the rainfall which occurred over [[Louisiana]]. If it were not for the intermittent invasions from tropical cyclones, rainfall during the months of August, September, and October would average about 25% less than it currently does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Roth, David M |url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/research/lahur.pdf |title=A Brief Climatology of Tropical Cyclones in Louisiana |publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service |author2=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center |accessdate=June 5, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68CeuGiEc?url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/research/lahur.pdf |archivedate=June 5, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missouri==
Remnant tropical cyclones can move into the state which originate in either the Pacific or Atlantic hurricane basins.  [[Tropical Storm Erin (2007)|Tropical Storm Erin]] reintensified over [[Oklahoma]] leading to heavy rainfall in that state. As the system moved eastward, its surface low quickly dissipated. However, its mid-level circulation remained robust, leading to a burst of heavy rainfall across [[Missouri]] exceeding {{convert|10|in|mm}} in isolated spots, which became the wettest tropical cyclone remnant on record for the state.&lt;ref name="Mid Atl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ERIN"&gt;{{cite web|author=David M.

==Virginia==
Virginia has some special considerations that affect tropical cyclone-related rainfall. Mountains to the west act as a perfect mechanism for upward motion during sustained east winds, which can lead to flash flooding and landslides in that region (e.g. [[Hurricane Camille]]). As a tropical system approaches from the south, a frontal zone sets up between the moist Atlantic Ocean and the drier landmass to the west. This boundary can set up two or three days in advance of a tropical storm, and can lead up to prolonged heavy rains across coastal sections (e.g. [[Hurricane Floyd]]). As the cyclone advances north, the boundary will slowly shift west, but progresses west of a [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]/[[Washington, D.C.]] line.&lt;ref name="Virginia history"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roth, David M|author2=Cobb, Hugh|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/research/roth/vaclimohur.htm|title=Virginia Hurricane History|chapter=Virginia Tropical Cyclone Climatology|accessdate=June 6, 2012|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Loggers klaralven.jpg|thumb|280px|Log drivers at [[Klarälven]] in [[Sweden]].]]
'''Log driving''' is a means of moving [[lumber|logs]] (sawn [[tree trunk]]s) from a forest to [[sawmill]]s and [[pulp mill]]s downstream using the current of a river.  It was the main transportation method of the early [[logging|logging industry]] in [[Europe]] and [[North America]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==History==
When the first [[sawmill]]s were established, they were usually small [[water power]]ed facilities located near the source of timber, which might be converted to grist mills after farming became established when the forests had been cleared.  Later, bigger [[circular saw]]mills were developed in the lower reaches of a river, with the logs floated down to them by log drivers.{{sfn |Holbrook |1961 |pp=42-43}} In the broader, slower stretches of a river, the logs might be bound together into [[Timber rafting|timber rafts]].&lt;ref name="Rosholt - Wisconsin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosholt|first=Malcolm|title=The Wisconsin Logging Book - 1839-1939|year=1980|publisher=Rosholt House|location=Rosholt, Wisconsin|isbn=0-910417-05-9|pages=190|url=http://www.mcmillanlibrary.org/rosholt/wi-logging-book/wilogging/images/00000027.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the smaller, wilder stretches of a river, rafts couldn't get through, so masses of individual logs were driven down the river like huge herds of cattle.
[[Image:Log jam Berlin Falls 1872.GIF|thumb|280px|Log jam at [[Berlin, New Hampshire]].]]

The log drive was one step in a larger process of lumber-making in remote places.  In a location with snowy winters, the yearly process typically began in the fall when a small team of men hauled tools upstream into the timbered area, chopped out a clearing, and constructed crude buildings for a [[logging camp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosholt|first=Malcolm|title=Lumbermen on the Chippewa - The Camp |year=1982|publisher=Rosholt House |location=Rosholt, Wisconsin|isbn=0-910417-00-8 |page=8 |url=http://www.scls.lib.wi.us/mcm/rosholt/lumbermen-on-the-chippewa/lumbchip/images/00000003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter when things froze down, a larger crew moved into the camp and proceeded to cut trees, cutting the trunks into {{convert|16|ft|m|adj=on|0}} lengths, and hauling the logs with [[oxen]] or horses over iced trails to the riverbank.  There the logs were decked onto "rollways."  In the spring when snow thawed and water levels rose, the logs were rolled into the river, and the drive commenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosholt|first=Malcolm|title=Lumbermen on the Chippewa|year=1982|publisher=Rosholt House|location=Rosholt, Wisconsin|isbn=0-910417-00-8|page=23|url=http://www.scls.lib.wi.us/mcm/rosholt/lumbermen-on-the-chippewa/lumbchip/images/00000004.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure that logs drifted freely along the river, men called "log drivers" or "river pigs" were needed to guide the logs. The drivers typically divided into two groups.  The more experienced and nimble men comprised the "jam" crew or "beat" crew.  They watched the spots where logs were likely to jam, and when a jam started, tried to get to it quickly and dislodge the key logs before many logs stacked up.  If they didn't, the river would keep piling on more logs, forming a partial dam which could raise the water level.&lt;ref name = The_Drive&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosholt|first=Malcolm|title=Lumbermen on the Chippewa - The Drive|year=1982|publisher=Rosholt House|location=Rosholt, Wisconsin|isbn=0-910417-00-8|pages=63–64|url=http://www.scls.lib.wi.us/mcm/rosholt/lumbermen-on-the-chippewa/lumbchip/images/00000004.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millions of board feet of lumber could back up for miles upriver, requiring weeks to break up, with some lumber possibly lost if it was shoved far enough into the shallows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosholt|first=Malcolm|title=The Wisconsin Logging Book - 1839-1939|year=1980|publisher=Rosholt House|location=Rosholt, Wisconsin|isbn=0-910417-05-9|pages=182|url=http://www.mcmillanlibrary.org/rosholt/wi-logging-book/wilogging/images/00000025.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  So when the jam crew saw a jam start, they rushed to it and tried to break it up, using [[Peavey (tool)|peaveys]] and possibly [[dynamite]]. This job required some understanding of physics, strong muscles, and extreme agility. The jam crew was an exceedingly dangerous occupation, with the drivers standing on the moving logs and running from one to another. Many drivers lost their lives by falling and being crushed by the logs.&lt;ref name = The_Drive /&gt;
[[Image:Log Driver Brown Company Berlin, New Hampshire.jpg|thumb|280px|Log driver working for the [[Brown Company]] in [[New Hampshire]].]]
[[File:Flößerei Drei Flößer.jpg|thumb|River drivers in Germany with a crude [[pike pole]] the Germans call a rafters' hook (Flößerhaken, as in rafting logs), probably one or two [[pickaroon]]s and a [[Cant hook|ring dog]] for rolling logs over.]]
Each crew was accompanied by an experienced boss often selected for his fighting skills to control the strong and reckless men of his team.  The overall drive was controlled by the "walking boss" who moved from place to place to coordinate the various teams to keep logs moving past problem spots.  Stalling a drive near a saloon often created a cascade of drunken personnel problems.{{sfn |Holbrook |1961 |pp=53-56,64,66,72}}

A larger group of less experienced men brought up the rear, pushing along the straggler logs that were stuck on the banks and in trees.  They spent more time wading in icy water than balancing on moving logs.  They were called the "rear crew."  Other men worked with them from the bank, pushing logs away with [[pike pole]]s. Others worked with horses and oxen to pull in the logs that had strayed furthest out into the flats.&lt;ref name = The_Drive /&gt;

[[Bateau]]x ferried log drivers using pike poles to dislodge stranded logs while maneuvering with the log drive.{{sfn |Holbrook |1961 |p=119}} A wannigan was a kitchen built on a raft which followed the drivers down the river.&lt;ref name = The_Drive /&gt; The wannigan served four meals a day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Log Drives (and River Pigs)|url=http://www.mnhs.org/places/sites/fhc/logdrives.html|work=Forest History Center|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; to fuel the men working in cold water.  It also provided tents and blankets for the night if no better accommodations were available.&lt;ref name = The_Drive /&gt;  A commissary wagon carrying clothing, plug tobacco and patent medicines for purchase by the log drivers was also called a wangan. The logging company wangan train, called a ''Mary Anne'', was a caravan of wagons pulled by four- or six-horse teams where roads followed the river to transport the tents, blankets, food, stoves, and tools needed by the log drivers.{{sfn |Holbrook |1961 |p=65}}

For log drives, the ideal river would have been straight and uniform, with sharp banks and a predictable flow of water.  Wild rivers were not that, so men cut away the fallen trees that would snag logs, dynamited troublesome rocks, and built up the banks in places.  To control the flow of water, they built "flash dams" or "driving dams" on smaller streams, so they could release water to push the logs down when they wanted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vogel|first=John N.|title=The Round Lake logging dam: a survivor of Wisconsin's log-driving days|journal=Wisconsin Magazine of History|date=1982–1983|volume=66|issue=3|pages=176|url=http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/wmh&amp;CISOPTR=32773&amp;CISOSHOW=32692|accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each timber firm had its own mark which was placed on the logs, called an "end mark". Obliterating or altering a timber mark was a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosholt|first=Malcolm|title=Lumbermen on the Chippewa - End Marks and Bark Marks|year=1982|publisher=Rosholt House|location=Rosholt, Wisconsin|isbn=0-910417-00-8|pages=91–95|url=http://www.scls.lib.wi.us/mcm/rosholt/lumbermen-on-the-chippewa/lumbchip/images/00000006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the mill the logs were captured by a [[log boom]], and the logs were sorted for ownership before being sawn.&lt;ref name = The_Drive /&gt;

Log drives were often in conflict with [[ship transport|navigation]], as logs would sometimes fill the entire river and make boat travel dangerous or impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Wheeler, Scott |title = The History of Logging in Vermont's Northeast Kingdom | publisher = The Kingdom Historical |date=September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Floating logs down a river worked well for the most desirable pine timber, because it floated well.  But [[hardwoods]] were more dense, and didn't float well enough to be easily driven, and some pines weren't near drivable streams. Log driving became increasingly unnecessary with the development of [[rail transport|railroads]] and the use of trucks on [[logging roads]].  However, the practice survived in some remote locations where such infrastructure did not exist.  Most log driving in the United States and Canada ended with changes in environmental legislation in the 1970s.  Some places, like the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[Pyrenees]], still retain the practice as a popular holiday celebration once a year.

==Popular culture==
* The figure of speech "'''High and Dry'''" describes an unsuccessful log drive.  Maximum river flows typically coincided with the runoff from [[snowmelt]], and was sometimes augmented by water released from flash dams.  If logs were started downriver when there was not enough water to move them all the way to the sawmill, the investment made in cutting that timber might be stranded ''high and dry'' in shallows along the stream for a year until the next spring snowmelt.{{sfn |Holbrook |1961 |p=66}}
* The phrase "'''Come Hell or High Water'''", used when one is determined to get something accomplished no matter how hard or whatever difficulties one may face, originated in the race to get logs into the brooks and streams so that they could reach the rivers while the water was high enough to float the drive.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Howells. ''Back Roads of New England'', Gulf Publishing Company, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The contemporary logrolling contest, [[Logrolling (sport)|Birling]], is a demonstration of skills originally devised by log drivers.{{sfn |Holbrook |1961 |p=119}}
* Inclusive description of a complex assortment as "the whole Mary Anne" derives from the colorful characters of wangan caravans which periodically transformed quiet rural communities with the excitement of a passing log drive.
* In Canada, "[[The Log Driver's Waltz]]" is a popular [[folk music|folk]] song about the practice.
* The version of the [[Withdrawn Canadian banknotes#.241|Canadian one-dollar bank note]] issued in 1974 and withdrawn in 1989 featured a view of the [[Ottawa River]] with log driving taking place in the foreground and [[Parliament Hill]] rising in the background.  This banknote was part of the fourth series of banknotes released by the [[Bank of Canada]] entitled "[[Scenes of Canada (banknotes)|Scenes of Canada]]".  The logs depicted in this bank note may have been destined for a half dozen pulp, paper and sawmills near the [[Chaudière Falls]] immediately upstream from Parliament Hill, or for other mills further downstream.
* The song "[[Flottarkärlek]]" describes campfire stories from a log drivers perspective.
* An Englishman may have observed loggers loitering in [[Bangor, Maine]] when he reported in 1801: "His habits in the forest and the [river] voyage all break up the system of persevering industry and substitute one of alternate toil and indolence, hardship and debauch; and in the alteration, indolence and debauch will inevitably be indulged in the greatest possible proportion."{{sfn |Holbrook |1961 |p=18}}
*In the first chapter of ''[[The Cider House Rules]]'' (1985), [[John Irving]] briefly describes a 1930s log drive.

This is impossible as the deities existed in Africa long before colonization on the continent allowed English to infiltrate. The Mami Wata name is Ethiopian and Egyptian in origin and is linked to ancient African culture, spiritual belief systems, and folklore. The Ethiopian words "mama" indicated wisdom or truth while "uat-ur" meant ocean water. Additionally, in some early languages of the Sudan "wata" referred to a woman. Commonly thought to be a single entity, the term actually refers to a pantheon of African water deities. These African cultures were matriarchical and though "Mami Wata" can refer to males and females, they are most typically thought of as feminine and often take on a female form in art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alexander|first1=Skye|title=Mermaids The Myths, Legends, &amp; Lore|date=2012|publisher=Adams Media|location=Avon, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mami Wata is often described as a mermaid-like figure, with a woman's upper body (often nude) and the hindquarters of a fish or serpent.&lt;ref&gt;Higgins 1836, p. 105-106,113, 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griaule 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winters 1985 p. 50-64&lt;/ref&gt; In other tales, Mami Wata is fully human in appearance (though never human). The existence and spiritual importance of Mami Wata is deeply rooted in the ancient tradition and mythology of the coastal southeastern Nigerians ([[Efik people|Efik]], [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]] and [[Annang]] people). Mami Wata often carries expensive baubles such as combs, mirrors, and watches. A large [[snake]] (symbol of [[divination]] and [[divinity]]) frequently accompanies her, wrapping itself around her and laying its head between her breasts. Other times, she may try to pass as completely human, wandering busy markets or patronising bars.&lt;ref name="Van Stipriaan 325"/&gt; She may also manifest in a number of other forms, including as a man.&lt;ref name="Bastian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keya 1988, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asamoa 1986, p. 2-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ajayi 1967, 160-161.&lt;/ref&gt; Traders in the 20th century carried similar beliefs with them from [[Senegal]] to as far as [[Zambia]]. As the Mami Wata traditions continued to re-emerge, native water deities were subsumed into it.&lt;ref name="Modernity"&gt;[http://www.arcyart.com/mami1.htm Modernity and mystery: Mami Wata in African art].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water===
Traditions on both sides of the Atlantic tell of the spirit abducting her followers or random people whilst they are swimming or boating. She brings them to her paradisiacal realm, which may be underwater, in the [[Spirit|spirit world]], or both.&lt;ref name="Van Stipriaan 325"&gt;Van Stipriaan 325.&lt;/ref&gt; Should she allow them to leave, the travellers usually return in dry clothing and with a new spiritual understanding reflected in their gaze. These returnees often grow wealthier, more attractive, and more easygoing after the encounter.&lt;ref name="Bastian"/&gt;

Van Stipriaan further reports that other tales describe river travellers (usually men) chancing upon the spirit. She is inevitably grooming herself, combing her hair, and peering at herself in a mirror. Upon noticing the intruder, she flees into the water and leaves her possessions behind. The traveller then takes the invaluable items. Later, Mami Wata appears to the thief in his dreams to demand the return of her things. Should he agree, she further demands a promise from him to be sexually faithful to her. Agreement grants the person riches; refusal to return the possessions or to be faithful brings the man ill fortune.&lt;ref name="Van Stipriaan 325"/&gt;

Her worship is as diverse as her initiates, priesthood and worshippers,&lt;ref name="Modernity"/&gt; although some parallels may be drawn. Groups of people may gather in her name, but the spirit is much more prone to interacting with followers on a one-on-one basis. She thus has many [[priest]]s and [[spiritual medium|mediums]] in Africa, America and in the Caribbean who are specifically born and initiated to her.

In Nigeria, devotees typically wear red and white clothing, as these colors represent that particular Mami's dual nature. In [[Igbo (people)|Igbo]] iconography, red represents such qualities as death, destruction, heat, being male, physicality, and power. In contrast, white symbolises death, but also can symbolize beauty, creation, being female, new life, spirituality, translucence, water, and wealth.&lt;ref name="Bastian"/&gt; This regalia may also include a cloth snake wrapped about the waist.&lt;ref name="Modernity"/&gt; The Mami Wata [[shrine]]s may also be decorated in these colors, and items such as bells, carvings, Christian or Indian prints, dolls, incense, spirits, and remnants of previous sacrifices often adorn such places.&lt;ref name="Bastian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Modernity"/&gt;

Intense dancing accompanied by musical instruments such as African guitars or harmonicas often forms the core of Mami Wata worship. Followers dance to the point of entering a [[altered state of consciousness|trance]]. At this point, Mami Wata [[spiritual possession|possesses]] the person and speaks to him or her.&lt;ref name="Van Stipriaan 325"/&gt; Offerings to the spirit are also important, and Mami Wata prefers gifts of delicious food and drink, alcohol, fragrant objects (such as pomade, powder, incense, and soap), and expensive goods like jewelry.&lt;ref name="Modernity"/&gt; Modern worshippers usually leave her gifts of manufactured goods, such as [[Coca-Cola]] or designer jewelry.&lt;ref name="Van Stipriaan 325"/&gt;

Nevertheless, she largely wants her followers to be healthy and well off.&lt;ref name="Bastian"/&gt; More broadly, people blame the spirit for all sorts of misfortune. In [[Cameroon]], for example, Mami Wata is ascribed with causing the strong [[rip current|undertow]] that kills many swimmers each year along the coast.

===Sex===
According to Bastian, Mami Wata's association with sex and lust is somewhat paradoxically linked to one with [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fidelity fidelity]. According to a Nigerian tradition, male followers may encounter the spirit in the guise of a beautiful, sexually [[promiscuous woman]], such as a prostitute. In Nigerian popular stories, Mami Wata may seduce a favoured male devotee and then show herself to him following coitus. She then demands his complete sexual faithfulness and secrecy about the matter. Acceptance means wealth and fortune; rejection spells the ruin of his family, finances, and job.&lt;ref name="Bastian"/&gt;

===Healing and fertility===
Another prominent aspect of the Mami Wata deities is their connection to [[healing]]. If someone comes down with an incurable, languorous illness, Mami Wata often takes the blame. The illness is evidence that Mami Wata has taken an interest in the afflicted person and that only she can cure him or her. Similarly, several other ailments may be attributed to the water spirit. In [[Nigeria]], for example, she takes the blame for everything from headaches to sterility.&lt;ref name="Bastian"/&gt;

In fact, barren mothers often call upon the spirit to cure their affliction. Many traditions hold that Mami Wata herself is barren, so if she gives a woman a child, that woman inherently becomes more distanced from the spirit's true nature. The woman will thus be less likely to become wealthy or attractive through her devotion to Mami Wata. Images of women with children often decorate shrines to the spirit.&lt;ref name="Bastian"/&gt;

==Other associations==
As other deities become absorbed into the figure of Mami Wata, the spirit often takes on characteristics unique to a particular region or culture. In Trinidad and Tobago, for example, Maman Dlo plays the role of guardian of [[nature]], punishing overzealous hunters or woodcutters. She is the lover of [[Papa Bois]], a nature spirit.

==Origins and development==
It is believed that all of ancient Africa possessed a multitude of water-spirit traditions before the first contact with Europeans. Most of these were regarded as female. Dual natures of good and evil were not uncommon, reflecting the fact that water is an important means of providing communication, food, drink, trade, and transportation, but it can drown people, flood fields or villages, and provide passage to intruders. Van Stipriaan suggests that she may be based on the [[West African manatee]],&lt;ref name="Van Stipriaan 324"&gt;Van Stipriaan 324&lt;/ref&gt; which is an idea that has been proposed by scientists of the Ghanaian [[Council for Scientific and Industrial Research – Ghana|Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pan African News Agency|title=Ghana: Des scientifiques ghanéens percent le mystère de "Mamy Water"|url=http://fr.allafrica.com/stories/200104050264.html|accessdate=5 March 2014|language=French|date=5 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; in fact, "Mami Wata" is a common name for this animal in the region. Jill Salmons argues that the mermaid image may have come into being after contact with Europeans. The ships of traders and slavers often had carvings of mermaid figures on their prows, for example, and tales of mermaids were popular among sailors of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Paraphrased in van Stipriaan.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, white is traditionally associated with the spirit world in many cultures of Nigeria. The people of the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]] area often whiten their skin with talcum or other substances for rituals and for cosmetic reasons, for example.&lt;ref name="Bastian"/&gt;

Van Stipriaan speculates that [[Liberia]]n traders of the [[Kru people|Kru]] ethnic group moved up and down the west coast of Africa from Liberia to Cameroon beginning in the 19th century. They may have spread their own water-spirit beliefs with them and helped to standardise conceptions in West Africa. Their perceived wealth may have helped establish the spirit as one of good fortune.&lt;ref name="Van Stipriaan 329"&gt;Van Stipriaan 329.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a Mami Wata [[chieftain]], [https://www.linkedin.com/in/behumbeza Hounnon Behumbeza], who was himself appointed high priest of the Mami Wata tradition in West Africa (Benin, Togo and Ghana), "The Mami Wata tradition consists of a huge pantheon of deities and spirits, not just the often portrayed mermaid". Behumbeza goes on to say that "true knowledge and understanding of Mami Wata is shared with those initiated into the priesthood of Mami and with those who hear the calling for initiation into her mysteries."

===Image===
Van Stipriaan also believes that this period introduced West Africa to what would become the definitive image of Mami Wata. Circa 1887, a [[chromolithograph]] of a female [[Samoa]]n [[snake charmer]] appeared in Nigeria. According to the British art historian Kenneth C. Murray, the poster was titled ''Der Schlangenbändiger'' ("The Snake Charmer") and was originally created sometime between 1880 and 1887. Dr. Tobias Wendl, director of the Iwalewa-Haus Africa Centre at the University of Bayreuth, was unable to confirm this after extensive searching (as ''Der Schlangenbändiger'' is a masculine term, the title seems suspect). He did discover a very similar photograph titled ''Die samoanische Schlangenbändigerin Maladamatjaute'' ("the Samoan Snake Charmer (fem.) Maladamatjaute") in the collection of the Wilhelm-Zimmermann Archive in Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;Hamburg 1887, from Paideuma XI, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Wendl, "[http://www.freunde-afrikanischer-kultur.de/vortraege-und-artikel-bei-vdfak/61-trajektorien-einer-ikone-hans-himmelheber-und-die-erforschung-des-mami-wata-kults.html Trajektorien einer Ikone, Hans Himmelheber und die Erforschung des Mami Wata-Kults] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229021958/http://www.freunde-afrikanischer-kultur.de/vortraege-und-artikel-bei-vdfak/61-trajektorien-einer-ikone-hans-himmelheber-und-die-erforschung-des-mami-wata-kults.html |date=2014-12-29 }}", ''About Africa'', 2008. Accessed 2 Mar 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Whichever the original image, it was almost certainly a poster of a celebrated late 19th-century snake charmer who performed under the stage name "[[Nala Damajanti]]", which appeared in several variations, particularly "Maladamatjaute", at numerous venues, including the [[Folies Bergère]] in 1886. This identification was also made by Drewal in a 2012 book chapter on Mami Wata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drewal|first=Henry John|title=The Ashgate research companion to monsters and the monstrous|year=2013|publisher=Ashgate|location=Farnham [u.a.]|isbn=9781472418012|page=90|editor=Asa Simon Mittman; Peter J. Dendle|chapter=Beauteous Beast: The Water Deity Mami Wata in Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite exotic claims of her nationality, she was later identified as one Émilie Poupon of [[Nantey]], France.&lt;ref&gt;Edmond Antoine Poinsot, ''Dictionnaire des Pseudonymes'', Slatkine Reprints: Geneva, 1971, p. 486&lt;/ref&gt;

This image—an enticing woman with long, black hair and a large snake slithering up between her breasts, ambiguous if she is human or mermaid beyond the image—apparently caught the imaginations of the Africans who saw it; it was the definitive image of the spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mami Wata's Origins|url=https://artstories.artsmia.org/#/stories/323|website=ArtStories|publisher=Minneapolis Institute of Art|accessdate=24 December 2017|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before long, Mami Wata posters appeared in over a dozen countries and the popular image was reproduced in 1955 by the Shree Ram Calendar Company in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] for the African market.&lt;ref name=drewal2008afarts /&gt; People began creating Mami Wata art of their own, much of it influenced by the lithograph.&lt;ref&gt;Van Stipriaan 329-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reemergence in contemporary times==
[[File:Mam priestess.png|right|thumb|175px|Priestess of Mami Wata in [[Togo]], West Africa in 2005]]
According to photographer Van Stipriaan and some western anthropologists, the various West African religions came to resemble one another during the 20th century, especially in urban areas. The homogenisation was largely the result of greater communication and mobility of individuals from town to town and country to country, though links between the spirit's nature and the perils of the urban environment have also been proposed. This led to a new level of standardisation of priests, initiations of new devotees, healing rituals, and temples.&lt;ref name="Van Stipriaan 325"/&gt;

The 20th century also led to Mami Wata's reemergence in much of Central and Southern Africa. In the mid-1950s, traders imported copies of ''The Snake Charmer'' from [[Bombay]] and England and sold them throughout Africa. West African traders moved her to [[Lubumbashi]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) in that same decade. There the spirit became a popular subject of Congolese folk painters, who placed her on the walls of bars, stores, and marketplace stalls. [[Senegal]]ese traders and Congolese immigrants probably brought her worship to Zambia by the 1970s. Meanwhile, Congolese and Zambian artists spread Mami Wata images throughout public places in Zambia. Further diffusion might have occurred during the Biafran secessionist [[Nigerian Civil War]], which began in 1967. Refugees fled to all parts of West and Central Africa, bringing with them their belief in the water spirit.

Modern DRC, [[Lesotho]], South Africa, and Zambia today form the current boundary of the Mami Wata cult, albeit a blurred one. The pan-African water spirit is assimilating native water spirits in this region, many of them serpent figures. Some examples are the Congolese-Zambian ''chitapo'' or ''nakamwale'', the South African ''umamlambo'', and the [[Sotho language|Sotho]] ''mamolapo'' or ''mamogashoa''. The most visible evidence of this absorption is that many of these creatures are today viewed as mermaids rather than snakes, their traditional form. These adoptions often lead to confusion when aspects of more than one being become amalgamated under the name "Mami Wata". In Southern Africa, for example, Mami Wata is sometimes said to be able to fly around in the form of a tornado, an adopted aspect from the ''khanyapa'' water spirit.

==Across the Atlantic==
The new environment only served to emphasize the enslaved's connection to water. In Guiana, for example, slaves had to fight back swamp waters on the plantations they worked.&lt;ref name="Van Stipriaan 324"/&gt; She was first mentioned in [[Surinam (Dutch colony)|Dutch Guiana]] in the 1740s in the journal of an anonymous colonist: {{cquote|It sometimes happens that one or the other of the black slaves either imagines truthfully, or out of rascality pretends to have seen and heard an apparition or ghost which they call water mama, which ghost would have ordered them not to work on such or such a day, but to spend it as a holy day for offering with the blood of a white hen, to sprinkle this or that at the water-side and more of that monkey-business, adding in such cases that if they do not obey this order, shortly Watermama will make their child or husband etc. die or harm them otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. ''Ontwerp tot een beschryving van Surinaamen'', c. 1744. Quoted in van Stipriaan 327.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Slaves worshipped the spirit by dancing and then falling into a trancelike state. In the 1770s, the Dutch rulers outlawed the ritual dances associated with the spirit. The governor, J. Nepveu, wrote that {{cquote|the Papa, Nago, Arada and other slaves who commonly are brought here under the name Fida [Ouidah] slaves, have introduced certain devilish practices into their dancing, ''which they have transposed to all other slaves''; when a certain rhythm is played... they are possessed by their god, which is generally called Watramama.&lt;ref&gt;J. Nepveu (c. 1775). "Annotaties op het boek van J. D. Herlein ''Beschryvinge van de volkplantinge Zuriname''". Quoted in van Stipriaan 327-8. Emphasis in original.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s of the colony adopted Watermama from the slaves and merged her with their own water spirits.

By the 19th century, an influx of enslaved Africans from other regions had relegated Watermama to a position in the pantheon of the deities of the Surinamese [[Winti]] religion. When Winti was outlawed in the 1970s, her religious practices lost some of their importance in Suriname. Furthermore, a relative lack of freedom compared to their African brethren prevented the homogenisation that occurred with the Mami Wata cult across the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;Van Stipriaan 328.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Haiti, Lasirenn is a [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] loa who represents Mami Wata. She is described as a strong-willed, sensual siren who possesses the ability to drown those enticed by her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkpGDwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT22&amp;dq=lasirenn&amp;pg=PT22#v=onepage&amp;q=lasirenn&amp;f=false|title=Ezili's Mirrors|last=Tinsley|first=Omise'eke Natasha|date=2018-02-09|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822372080|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasirenn is often depicted as a half-fish, half-human being, but is occasionally portrayed as a whale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n6e84XVwXakC&amp;lpg=PA231&amp;dq=lasirenn&amp;pg=PA231#v=onepage&amp;q=lasirenn&amp;f=false|title=A Day for the Hunter, a Day for the Prey: Popular Music and Power in Haiti|last=Averill|first=Gage|date=1997-06-21|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226032917|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to many other depictions of Mami Wata, Lasirenn is often shown gazing at herself in a mirror, a symbolic representation of her beauty. She is often associated with queer relationships among Black women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Szeles|first=Ursula|date=2011|title=Sea Secret Rising: The Lwa Lasirenn in Haitian Vodou|jstor=41711916|journal=Journal of Haitian Studies|volume=17|issue=1|pages=193–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

Mami Wata is a popular subject in the art, fiction, poetry, music, and film of the Caribbean and West and Central Africa. Visual artists especially seem drawn to her image, and both wealthier Africans and tourists buy paintings and wooden sculptures of the spirit. She also figures prominently in the [[folk art]] of Africa, with her image adorning walls of bars and living rooms, album covers, and other items.&lt;ref&gt;Van Stipriaan 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mami Wata has also proved to be a popular theme in [[African literature|African]] and [[Caribbean literature]]. Authors who have featured her in their fiction include [[Wayne Gerard Trotman]] as Mama Dlo in his [[novel]] ''Kaya Abaniah and the Father of the Forest'', [[Patrick Chamoiseau]], Alex Godard, Rose Marie Guiraud ([[Côte d'Ivoire]]), [[Flora Nwapa]], and [[Véronique Tadjo]] (Côte d'Ivoire). ''[[Mamy-Wata (newspaper)|Mamy-Wata]]'' is also the title of a satirical Cameroonian newspaper.

The character Mami Watanabe from the comic book ''Factionalists'' is the physical manifestation of the spirit entity Mami Wata. The author utilized a number of features to convey this. Her name Mami Watanabe is a play on Mami Wata. Despite being Japanese, her skin is darkened in the Japanese [[ganguro]] style. She also has a tattoo of a snake on her body and receives a watch and a mirror as gifts in the series, two items generally associated with Mami Wata.

Singer-songwriter [[S.J. Tucker]] recorded a song named "La Sirene" in honor of Mami Watanabe. Trumpeter [[Hugh Masekela]] recorded a song titled "Mami Wata", which appears on the [[Compact Disc|CD]] version of his album ''[[The Boy's Doin' It]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://amzn.com/B000007QKA | title=Boy's Doin It: Hugh Masekela | accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mami Wata appeared in the second season of the Canadian television show [[Lost Girl (TV series)|''Lost Girl'']] on [[Showcase (Canadian TV channel)|Showcase Television]]. She is also referred to in the television show ''[[River Monsters]]'' while [[Jeremy Wade]] is fishing in the [[Congo River]] in the episode ''Congo Killer''. She is referred to again in the "Body Snatcher" episode set in [[Guyana]]. In this second episode, Wade speculates that legends of Mami Wata in Guyana could have originated by [[Arapaima]] attacks.

In [[Nigerian Americans|Nigerian-American]] author [[Nnedi Okorafor]]'s 2014 [[speculative fiction]] novel ''Lagoon'', an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] spaceship appears beneath the waters of [[Lagos Lagoon]] and the new arrivals cause transformations in the natural and human world.  When the first alien ambassador sets foot on the [[Bar Beach, Lagos|Bar Beach]] in human female form, then disappears into the sea, a local boy compares her to Mami Wata. Later, an antagonist interprets another alien in female form as Mami Wata and surrenders to her seduction, accompanying her into the sea to be transformed.

Rapper [[Azealia Banks]] is well known for her mermaid aesthetic. During the release of her debut mixtape ''[[Fantasea (mixtape)|Fantasea]]'', Banks embarked on a worldwide Mermaid Ball tour. The Mermaid Ball was an amalgamation of seahorses, bubbles, and a number of nods to Disney's ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/azealia-banks-throws-a-mermaid-ball-in-new-york-20120604|title=Azealia Banks Throws a Mermaid Ball in New York|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to Fantasea's theme, Banks states that the mixtape was inspired by [[Yemoja|Yemaya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://feministing.com/2015/01/21/azealia-banks-yoruba-traditions-and-blacklivesmatter/|title=Azealia Banks, Yoruba traditions, and #BlackLivesMatter|work=Feministing|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For other stories explaining the name of the city, see Fowler, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Melia was also perhaps considered to be the mother, by Inachus, of [[Io (mythology)|Io]],&lt;ref&gt;Tripp, s.v.

'''Naturalistic observation''' is, in contrast to [[analog observation]], a research tool in which a subject is observed in its [[natural habitat]] without any manipulation by the observer.&lt;ref name=KCherry&gt;{{cite web |last=Cherry |first=Kendra |title=What Is Naturalistic Observation? |url=http://psychology.about.com/od/nindex/g/naturalistic.htm |publisher=About.com |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Psychology 202Q Lab: Naturalistic Observation |url=http://www.sp.uconn.edu/~ps202vc/PDF/NaturalisticObservation.pdf |publisher=[[University of Connecticut]] |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During naturalistic observation, researchers take great care to avoid interfering with the behavior they are observing by using [[Unobtrusive research|unobtrusive]] methods.&lt;ref name=NatObs&gt;{{cite web |title=Naturalistic Observation |publisher=radford.edu |url=http://www.radford.edu/~tpierce/201%20files/201%20handouts/Naturalistic%20Observationl%20ecture%20notes.pdf |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalistic observation involves two main differences that set it apart from other forms of data gathering. In the context of a naturalistic observation, the environment is in no way being manipulated by the observer nor was it created by the observer.&lt;ref name=NatObs/&gt;

[[File:Impala mutualim with birds wide.jpg|left|frameless]]
Naturalistic observation, as a research tool, comes with both advantages and disadvantages that impact its application. By merely observing at a given instance without any manipulation in its natural context, it makes the behaviors exhibited more credible because they are occurring in a real, typical scenario as opposed to an artificial one generated within a lab.&lt;ref name="NatObs" /&gt; Naturalistic observation also allows for study of events that are deemed unethical to study via experimental models, such as the impact of high school shootings on students attending the high school.&lt;ref name="NatObs" /&gt; Naturalistic observation is used in many techniques, from watching an animal's eating patterns in the forest to observing the behavior of students in a school setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://peace.saumag.edu/faculty/kardas/Courses/RMPA/naturalisticobservation.html|title=Naturalistic Observation|website=peace.saumag.edu|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accuracy of measurements ==
The quality of ''in situ'' measurements is non-uniform across space, time and platforms. Different platforms employ a large variety of sensors, which operate in a wide range of often hostile environments and use different measurement protocols. Occasionally, buoys are left unattended for extended periods of time, while ships may involve a certain amount of the human-related impacts in data collection and transmission.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130116114919/http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&amp;doi=10.1175/1520-0426(1999)016%3C0905:ASDOTR%3E2.0.CO;2] &lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, quality control is necessary before in situ data can be further used in scientific research or other applications. This is an example of quality control and monitoring of sea surface temperatures measured by ships and buoys, the iQuam system developed at NOAA/NESDIS/STAR,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/sod/sst/iquam|title=iQuam - in situ SST quality monitoring|author=|publisher=Star.nesdis.noaa.gov|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where statistics show the quality of ''in situ'' measurements of sea surface temperatures.

One of the problems facing real-time ocean observatories is the ability to provide a fast and accurate assessment of the data quality. Ocean Networks Canada is in the process of implementing real-time quality control on incoming data. For scalar data, the aim is to meet the guidelines of the Quality Assurance of Real Time Oceanographic Data (QARTOD) group. QARTOD is a US organization tasked with identifying issues involved with incoming real-time data from the U.S Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS). A large portion of their agenda is to create guidelines for how the quality of real-time data is to be determined and reported to the scientific community. Real-time data quality testing at Ocean Networks Canada includes tests designed to catch instrument failures and major spikes or data dropouts before the data is made available to the user. Real-time quality tests include meeting instrument manufacturer’s standards and overall observatory/site ranges determined from previous data. Due to the positioning of some instrument platforms in highly productive areas, we have also designed dual-sensor tests e.g. for some conductivity sensors. The quality control testing is split into 3 separate categories. The first category is in real-time and tests the data before the data are parsed into the database. The second category is delayed-mode testing where archived data are subject to testing after a certain period of time. The third category is manual quality control by an Ocean Networks Canada data expert.

{{Special characters}}
{{Ancient Greek religion}}
In [[Greek mythology]], '''Persephone''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ər|ˈ|s|ɛ|f|ə|n|i}} {{respell|pər|SEF|ə|nee}}; {{lang-gr|Περσεφόνη}}), also called '''Kore''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɔər|iː}} {{respell|KOR|ee}}; "the maiden"), is the daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Demeter]]. [[Homer]] describes her as the formidable, venerable majestic princess of the [[Greek underworld|underworld]], who carries into effect the curses of men upon the souls of the dead. She becomes the queen of the underworld through her abduction by and subsequent marriage to [[Hades]], the god of the underworld.&lt;ref name=Nilsson462&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion'' Vol I pp 462–463, 479–480&lt;/ref&gt; The myth of her abduction represents her function as the [[personification]] of [[vegetation]], which shoots forth in [[spring (season)|spring]] and withdraws into the earth after harvest; hence, she is also associated with spring as well as the fertility of vegetation. Similar myths appear in the [[Orient]], in the cults of male gods like [[Attis]], [[Adonis]], and [[Osiris]],&lt;ref&gt;Fraser. ''The golden bough. Adonis, Attis and Osiris''. Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, pp. 215&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Crete]]. 

Persephone as a [[vegetation deity|vegetation goddess]] and her mother Demeter were the central figures of the [[Eleusinian mysteries]], which promised the initiated a more enjoyable prospect after death. In some versions, Persephone is the mother of [[Zeus]]'s sons [[Dionysus]], [[Iacchus]], or [[Zagreus]]. The origins of her cult are uncertain, but it was based on very old agrarian cults of agricultural communities.

Persephone was commonly worshipped along with Demeter and with the same mysteries. To her alone were dedicated the mysteries celebrated at Athens in the month of [[Anthesterion]]. In [[Art in ancient Greece|Classical Greek art]], Persephone is invariably portrayed 
robed, often carrying a [[wikt:sheaf|sheaf]] of grain. She may appear as a mystical divinity with a sceptre and a little box, but she was mostly represented in the process of being carried off by [[Hades (mythology)|Hades]].

In [[Roman mythology]], she is called [[Proserpina]], and her mother, [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]] and her father [[Jupiter(Mythology)|Jupiter]].

:"It is tempting to see&amp;nbsp;... the classical Perse&amp;nbsp;... daughter of [[Oceanus]]&amp;nbsp;... ; whether it may be further identified with the first element of Persephone is only speculative." [[John Chadwick]]. ''Documents in Mycenean Greek''. Second Edition&lt;/ref&gt; ''Persephonē'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Περσεφόνη}}) is her name in the [[Ionic Greek]] of [[Epic poetry|epic]] literature. The Homeric form of her name is ''Persephoneia'' (Περσεφονεία,&lt;ref name="Homer1899"&gt;{{cite book|last=Homer|first=|title=Odyssey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_-ZDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP230|accessdate=31 March 2014|year=1899|publisher=Clarendon Press|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Persephoneia''). In other dialects, she was known under variant names: ''Persephassa'' ({{lang|grc|Περσεφάσσα}}), ''Persephatta'' ({{lang|grc|Περσεφάττα}}), or simply ''Korē'' ({{lang|grc|Κόρη}}, "girl, maiden").&lt;ref&gt;H.G. Liddell and R. Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] calls her ''Pherepapha'' ({{lang|grc|Φερέπαφα}}) in his [[Cratylus (dialogue)|''Cratylus'']], "because she is wise and touches that which is in motion". There are also the forms ''Periphona'' (Πηριφόνα) and ''Phersephassa'' ({{lang|grc|Φερσέφασσα}}). The existence of so many different forms shows how difficult it was for the Greeks to pronounce the word in their own language and suggests that the name may have a [[Pre-Greek]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;Martin P. Nilsson (1967), ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion'', Volume I, C.F. Beck Verlag, p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Persephatta'' ({{lang|grc|Περσεφάττα}}) is considered to mean "female thresher of grain"; the first constituent of the name originates in [[Proto-Greek]] "perso-" (related to Sanskrit "parṣa-"), "sheaf of grain" and the second constituent of the name originates in Proto-Indo European ''{{PIE|*-gʷn-t-ih}}'', from the root ''{{PIE|*gʷʰen-}}'' "to strike".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, pp. 1179–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular folk etymology is from {{lang|grc|φέρειν φόνον}}, ''pherein phonon'', "to bring (or cause) death".&lt;ref name=SmithPersephone&gt;Smith, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0104:entry=persephone-bio-1 "Perse'phone"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Proserpina===
[[File:Proserpina kidnapped Kircheriano Terme.jpg|thumb|Cinerary altar with tabula representing the rape of [[Proserpina]]. White marble, Antonine Era, 2nd century [[Rome]], Baths of Diocletian ]]
[[File:Locri Pinax Persephone Opens Liknon Mystikon.jpg|thumb|Persephone opening a ''[[cista]]'' containing the infant [[Adonis]], on a [[pinax]] from [[Locri]]]]

The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] first heard of her from the [[Aeolians|Aeolian]] and [[Dorians|Dorian]] cities of [[Magna Graecia]], who used the dialectal variant ''Proserpinē'' ({{lang|grc|Προσερπίνη}}). Hence, in [[Roman mythology]] she was called [[Proserpina]], a name erroneously derived by the Romans from ''proserpere'', "to shoot forth"&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]]. ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' 2.26&lt;/ref&gt; and as such became an emblematic figure of the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Welch (2013), p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Locri]], perhaps uniquely, Persephone was the protector of marriage, a role usually assumed by [[Hera]]; in the iconography of [[Pinax|votive plaques]] at Locri, her abduction and marriage to Hades served as an emblem of the marital state, children at Locri were dedicated to Proserpina, and maidens about to be wed brought their ''[[peplos]]'' to be blessed.&lt;ref&gt;Christiane Sourvinou-Inwood, "Persephone" ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''98''' (1978:101–121).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nestis===
In a Classical period text ascribed to [[Empedocles]], c. 490 – 430 BC,{{refn|group=n|Empedocles was a Greek pre-Socratic philosopher who was a citizen of Agrigentum, a Greek colony in Sicily.}} describing a correspondence among four deities and the [[classical element]]s, the name ''Nestis'' for water apparently refers to Persephone: "Now hear the fourfold roots of everything: enlivening Hera, Hades, shining Zeus. And Nestis, moistening mortal springs with tears."&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Kingsley (scholar)|Peter Kingsley]], in ''Ancient Philosophy, Mystery, and Magic: Empedocles and Pythagorean Tradition'' (Oxford University Press, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the four deities of Empedocles' elements, it is the name of Persephone alone that is [[taboo]]—Nestis is a euphemistic cult title{{refn|group=n|Kingsley 1995 identifies ''Nestis'' as a cult title of Persephone.}}—for she was also the terrible Queen of the Dead, whose name was not safe to speak aloud, who was [[euphemism|euphemistically]] named simply as Kore or "the Maiden", a vestige of her archaic role as the deity ruling the underworld.

==Titles and functions==
The epithets of Persephone reveal her double function as [[chthonic]] and vegetation goddess. The surnames given to her by the poets refer to her character as Queen of the lower world and the dead, or her symbolic meaning of the power that shoots forth and withdraws into the earth. Her common name as a vegetation goddess is Kore, and in [[Arcadia]] she was worshipped under the title [[Despoina]], "the mistress", a very old chthonic divinity. [[Plutarch]] identifies her with spring and [[Cicero]] calls her the seed of the fruits of the fields. In the [[Eleusinian]] mysteries, her return is the symbol of immortality and hence she was frequently represented on sarcophagi.&lt;ref name=SmithPersephone/&gt;

In the mystical theories of the [[Orphism (religion)|Orphics]] and the [[Plato]]nists, Kore is described as the all-pervading goddess of nature&lt;ref&gt;Orphic Hymn 29.16&lt;/ref&gt; who both produces and destroys everything, and she is therefore mentioned along or identified with other mystic divinities such as [[Isis]], [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], [[Gaia (mythology)|Ge]], [[Hestia]], [[Pandora]], [[Artemis]], and [[Hecate]].&lt;ref&gt;Schol. ad. Theocritus 2.12&lt;/ref&gt; The Orphic Persephone is further said to have become by [[Zeus]] the mother of [[Dionysus]], [[Iacchus]], [[Zagreus]],&lt;ref name=SmithPersephone/&gt; and the little-attested [[Melinoe]].&lt;ref&gt;In the ''Hymn to Melinoe'', where the father is ''Zeus Chthonios'', either Zeus in his chthonic aspect, or [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]; Radcliffe G.

As a goddess of the underworld, Persephone was given [[euphemistically]] friendly names.&lt;ref name=Rhode206&gt;Rhode (1961), ''Psyche'' I, pp. 206–210&lt;/ref&gt; However it is possible that some of them were the names of original goddesses:
* '''[[Despoina]]''' (''dems-potnia'') "the mistress" (literally "the mistress of the house") in [[Arcadia]].
* '''Hagne''', "pure", originally a goddess of the springs in [[Messenia]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Nilsson (1967) Vol I, pp. 478–480&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the cult==
[[File:P1010629 crop.png|thumb|left|Gold ring from Isopata tomb, near [[Knossos]], [[Crete]], 1400–1500 BC. Depicted are female figures dancing among blossoming vegetation; [[Heraklion Archaeological Museum]]]]

The myth of [[Rape of Persephone|a goddess being abducted and taken to the Underworld]] is probably [[Pre-Greek substrate|Pre-Greek]] in origin. [[Samuel Noah Kramer]], the renowned scholar of ancient [[Sumer]], has posited that the Greek story of the abduction of Persephone may be derived from an ancient Sumerian story in which [[Ereshkigal]], the ancient Sumerian goddess of the Underworld, is abducted by [[Kur]], the primeval [[dragon]] of [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian mythology]], and forced to become ruler of the Underworld against her own will.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Samuel Noah. ''Sumerian Mythology: A Study of Spiritual and Literary Achievement in the Third Millennium B.C.: Revised Edition''. University of Pennsylvania Press, 1961, Philadelphia. {{ISBN|0-8122-1047-6}} (Pages 76-79) available at [http://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/sum/sum08.htm sacred-texts.com]. "Moreover, the crime involved is probably that of abducting a goddess; it therefore brings to mind the Greek story of the rape of Persephone."&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of Persephone's abduction is different in each local cult. The ''[[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn to Demeter]]'' mentions the "plain of Nysa".&lt;ref&gt;''Homeric Hymn to Demeter'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=HH+2+17 17].&lt;/ref&gt; The locations of this probably mythical place may simply be conventions to show that a magically distant [[chthonic]] land of myth was intended in the remote past.&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson (1967), Vol I, p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherwood217&gt;"In Greek mythology [[Nysa (mythology)|Nysa]] is a mythical mountain with unknown location, the birthplace of the god [[Dionysos]].": Fox, William Sherwood (1916), ''[[The Mythology of All Races]]'', v.1, ''Greek and Roman'', General editor, Louis Herbert Gray, p.217&lt;/ref&gt; [[Demeter]] found and met her daughter in [[Eleusis]], and this is the mythical disguise of what happened in the mysteries.&lt;ref name=Burkert285&gt;Burkert (1985), pp. 285–290.&lt;/ref&gt;

Persephone is an old [[chthonic]] deity of the agricultural communities, who received the souls of the dead into the earth, and acquired powers over the fertility of the soil, over which she reigned. The earliest depiction of a goddess who may be identified with Persephone growing out of the ground, is on a plate from the Old-Palace period in [[Phaistos]]. The goddess has a vegetable-like appearance, and she is surrounded by dancing girls between blossoming flowers.&lt;ref name=Burkert42&gt;Burkert (1985) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar representation, where the goddess appears to come down from the sky, is depicted on the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] ring of Isopata.

In some forms [[Hades]] appears with his [[chthonic]] horses. The myth of the rape of Kore was derived from the idea that [[Hades]] catches the souls of the dead and then carries them with his horses into his kingdom. This idea is vague in [[Homer]], but appears in later Greek depictions, and in Greek folklore. "Charos" appears with his horse and carries the dead into the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967) Vol I, pp. 453–455&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Charon&gt;[[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], "glad", probably euphemistically "death". Liddell and Scott, ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1843, 1985 printing), entries on {{lang|grc|χαροπός}} and {{lang|grc|χάρων}}, pp. 1980–1981; ''Brill's New Pauly'' (Leiden and Boston 2003), vol. 3, entry on "Charon", pp. 202–203.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cults of Persephone and [[Demeter]] in the [[Eleusinian mysteries]] and in the [[Thesmophoria]] were based on old agrarian cults.&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson, Vol I, p.470&lt;/ref&gt;
A lot of ancient beliefs were based on initiation into jealously-guarded [[mystery religions|mysteries]] (secret rites) because they offered prospects after death more enjoyable than the final end at the gloomy space of the Greek [[Hades]]. There is evidence that some practices were derived from the religious practices of the [[Mycenean Greece|Mycenaean age]].&lt;ref name=Dietrich220 &gt;Dietrich  "The origins of the Greek Religion" p.220,221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Burkert42 /&gt;  [[Karl Kerenyi|Kerenyi]] asserts that these religious practices were introduced from [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Crete]].,&lt;ref name=Kerenyi24&gt;"Kerenyi (1976), ''Dionysos, archetypal image of indestructible life.Princeton University Press. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerenyi31&gt;[[Karl Kerenyi]] (1967). ''Eleusis. Archetypal image of mother and daughter''. Princeton University Press. p. 31f&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of immortality which appears in the syncretistic religions of the [[Near East]] did not exist in the Eleusinian mysteries at the very beginning.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1985) p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"According to the Greek popular belief,{{lang|grc|ἕν ἀνδρῶν, ἕν θεῶν γένος}}".(One is the nature of men, another one the nature of gods): Erwin Rhode (1961), ''Psyche'' Band I, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

===Near East and Minoan Crete===
[[File:Lady of Auxerre Louvre Ma3098 n2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lady of Auxerre]] [[Louvre]]-An Archaic (640 BC) image from [[Crete]]. A version of a Minoan goddess who may be identified with Kore]]
In the [[Near East|Near eastern]] myth of the early agricultural societies, every year the fertility goddess bore the "god of the new year", who then became her lover, and died immediately in order to be reborn and face the same destiny. Some findings from [[Catal Huyuk]] since the Neolithic age,  indicate the worship of the Great Goddess  accompanied by a boyish consort, who symbolizes the annual  decay and return of vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert p.12&lt;/ref&gt; Similar cults of resurrected gods appear in the Near East and [[Egypt]] in the cults of [[Attis]], [[Adonis]] and [[Osiris]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James George Frazer|J.Frazer]] ''The Golden Bough, Part IV, Adonis, Attis and Osiris''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Crete]], the "divine child" was related to the female vegetation divinity [[Ariadne]] who died every year.&lt;ref name=Schacherm141&gt;F.Schachermeyer (1972), Die Minoische Kultur des alten Kreta, W.Kohlhammer Stuttgart, pp. 141, 308&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] religion had its own characteristics. The most peculiar feature of the Minoan belief in the divine, is the appearance of the goddess from above in the dance. Dance floors have been discovered in addition to "vaulted tombs", and it seems that the dance was ecstatic. [[Homer]] memorializes the dance floor which [[Daedalus]] built for [[Ariadne]] in the remote past.&lt;ref name=Burkert34&gt;Burkert (1985) pp. 34–40&lt;/ref&gt; On the gold ring from Isopata, four women in festal attire are performing a dance between blossoming flowers. Above a figure apparently floating in the air seems to be the goddess herself, appearing amid the whirling dance.&lt;ref name=Burkert40&gt;Burkert (1985) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; An image plate from the first palace of [[Phaistos]], seems to be very close to the mythical image of the ''Anodos'' (ascent) of Persephone. Two girls dance between blossoming flowers, on each side of a similar but armless and legless figure which seems to grow out of the ground. The goddess is bordered by snake lines which give her a vegetable like appearance  She has a large stylized flower turned over her head. The resemblance with the flower-picking Persephone and her companions is compelling.&lt;ref name=Burkert42/&gt; The depiction of the goddess is similar to later images of "Anodos of Pherephata". On the Dresden vase, Persephone is growing out of the ground, and she is surrounded by the animal-tailed agricultural gods [[Seilenos|Silenoi]].&lt;ref name="Hermesthe"&gt;"Hermes and the Anodos of Pherephata": Nilsson (1967) p. 509 taf. 39,1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Kerenyi|Kerenyi]] suggests that the name [[Ariadne]] (derived from {{lang|grc|ἁγνή}}, ''hagne'', "pure"), was an [[euphemistical]] name given by the Greeks to the nameless "Mistress of the [[labyrinth]]" who appears in a [[Mycenean Greece|Mycenean Greek]] inscription from [[Knossos]] in [[Crete]]. The Greeks used to give friendly names to the deities of the underworld. [[Zeus|Cthonic Zeus]] was called [[Eubuleus]], "the good counselor", and the ferryman of the river of the underworld [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], "glad".&lt;ref name=Charon/&gt; [[Despoina]] and "Hagne" were probably euphemistic surnames of Persephone, therefore he theorizes that the cult of Persephone was the continuation of the worship of a [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] Great goddess. The [[labyrinth]] was both a winding dance-ground and, in the Greek view, a prison with the dreaded [[Minotaur]] at its centre.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Kerenyi]] (1976), Dionysos: archetypal image of indestructible life, pp. 89, 90 {{ISBN|0-691-02915-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]], listing of {{lang|grc|ἀδνόν}}, a Cretan-Greek form for {{lang|grc|ἁγνόν}}, "pure"&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that some religious practices, especially the [[mystery religions|mysteries]], were transferred from a [[Crete|Cretan]] priesthood to [[Eleusis]], where [[Demeter]] brought the [[poppy]] from [[Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;Kerenyi(1976), p.24&lt;/ref&gt; Besides these similarities, [[Walter Burkert|Burkert]] explains that up to now it is not known to what extent one can and must differentiate between [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenea]]n religion.&lt;ref&gt;"To what extent one can and must differentiate between Minoan and Mycenaean religion is a question which has not yet found a conclusive answer" :.Burkert (1985). p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Anthesteria]] Dionysos is the "divine child".

===Mycenean Greece===
[[File:Fresco of two female charioteers from Tiryns 1200 BC.jpg|thumb|left|Two women or goddesses on a chariot. Fresco from [[Tiryns]], 1200 BC. National Archaeological Museum of [[Athens]].]]

There is evidence of a cult in [[Eleusis]] from the Mycenean period;&lt;ref&gt;G. Mylonas (1932). Eleusiniaka. I,1 ff&lt;/ref&gt; however, there are not sacral finds from this period. The cult was private and there is no information about it. As well as the names of some Greek gods in the [[Mycenean Greece|Mycenean Greek]] inscriptions, also appear names of goddesses, like "the divine Mother" (the mother of the gods) or "the Goddess (or priestess) of the winds", who don't have Mycenean origin .&lt;ref name=Burkert285/&gt; In historical times, [[Demeter]] and Kore were usually referred to as "the goddesses" or "the mistresses" ([[Arcadia]]) in the mysteries .&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson (1967), pp. 463–465&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenean Greek]] tablets dated 1400–1200 BC, the "two queens and the king" are mentioned. [[John Chadwick]] believes that these were the precursor divinities of [[Demeter]], Persephone and [[Poseidon]].&lt;ref&gt;John Chadwick (1976).''The Mycenean World''. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Wa-na-ssoi, wa-na-ka-te, (to the two queens and the king). Wanax is best suited to Poseidon, the special divinity of Pylos. The identity of the two divinities addressed as wanassoi, is uncertain ": George Mylonas (1966) Mycenae and the Mycenean age" p. 159 : Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some information can be obtained from the study of the cult of [[Eileithyia]] at [[Crete]], and the cult of [[Despoina]]. In the cave of [[Amnisos]] at [[Crete]], [[Eileithyia]] is related with the annual birth of the divine child and she is connected with  ''Enesidaon'' (The earth shaker), who is the [[chthonic]] aspect of the god [[Poseidon]].&lt;ref name="Dietrich p. 220,221"&gt;Dietrich p. 220,221&lt;/ref&gt; 
Persephone was conflated with Despoina, "the mistress", a chthonic divinity in West-[[Arcadia]].&lt;ref name="Kerenyi31"/&gt; The [[megaron]] of Eleusis is quite similar with the "megaron" of Despoina at [[Lycosura]].&lt;ref name=Burkert285/&gt; Demeter is united with the god [[Poseidon]], and she bears a daughter, the unnameable Despoina.&lt;ref name="Pausanias 8.37.9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+8.37.9&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160 |title=Pausanias 8.37.9 |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |access-date=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poseidon appears as a horse, as it usually happens in Northern European folklore. The goddess of nature and her companion survived in the Eleusinian cult, where the following words were uttered "Mighty Potnia bore a great sun".&lt;ref name="Dietrich p. 220,221"/&gt; In Eleusis, in a ritual, one child ("pais") was initiated from the hearth. The name ''pais'' (the divine child) appears in the Mycenean inscriptions,&lt;ref name=Burkert285/&gt; and the ritual indicates the transition from the old funerary practices to the [[Greece|Greek]] cremation.&lt;ref name="Wunderlich 1972 p. 134"&gt;"In Greek mythology Achileus becomes immortal by the divine fire. His heel was his only mortal element, because it was not touched by the fire : Wunderlich (1972), ''The secret of Crete'' p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greek mythology Nysa is a mythical mountain with an unknown location.&lt;ref name=Sherwood217/&gt; ''Nysion'' (or Mysion), the place of the abduction of Persephone was also probably a mythical place which did not exist on the map, a magically distant chthonic land of myth which was intended in the remote past.&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson, Vol I p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==

===Abduction myth&lt;!--Part of this section is linked from [[The High Priestess]] --&gt;===

[[File:Sarcophagus with the Abduction of Persephone by Hades (detail).JPG| thumb|left|[[Sarcophagus]] with the abduction of '''Persephone'''. Walters Art Museum. [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]]]

The story of her abduction by [[Hades]] can be seen as either consensual or against her will, is traditionally referred to as the [[Rape of Persephone]]. It is mentioned briefly in [[Hesiod]]'s [[Theogony]],&lt;ref name=HesTh914&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.%20Th.%20914&amp;lang=original&amp;highlight=Persephone 914].&lt;/ref&gt; and told in considerable detail in the ''[[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn to Demeter]]''. Persephone used to live far away from the other gods, a goddess within Nature herself before the days of planting seeds and nurturing plants. In the Olympian telling, the gods [[Ares]], [[Hermes]] and [[Apollo]] had wooed Persephone; but Demeter rejected all their gifts and hid her daughter away from the company of the Olympian gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/HermesLoves.html |title=Loves of Hermes : Greek mythology |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zeus]], it is said, permitted [[Hades]], who was in love with the beautiful Persephone, to abduct her as her mother [[Demeter]] was not likely to allow her daughter to go down to Hades. Persephone was gathering flowers with the [[Oceanid]]s along with [[Artemis]] and [[Athena]]—the ''Homeric Hymn'' says—in a field when [[Hades]] came to abduct her, bursting through a cleft in the earth.&lt;ref&gt;''Homeric Hymn to Demeter'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=HH+2+4 4–20], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=HH+2+414 414–434].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Demeter]], when she found her daughter had disappeared, searched for her all over the earth with Hecate's torches. In most versions she forbids the earth to produce, or she neglects the earth and in the depth of her despair she causes nothing to grow. [[Helios]], the sun, who sees everything, eventually told Demeter what had happened and at length she discovered the place of her abode. Finally, Zeus, pressed by the cries of the hungry people and by the other deities who also heard their anguish, forced [[Hades]] to return Persephone.&lt;ref name="Theoi Project - Persephone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Khthonios/Persephone.html |title=Theoi Project - Persephone |publisher=Theoi.com |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rape of Prosepina September 2015-3a.jpg|thumb|[[The Rape of Proserpina]] by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] at the [[Galleria Borghese]] in Rome.]]
[[Hades (mythology)|Hades]] indeed complied with the request, but first he tricked her, giving her some [[pomegranate]] seeds to eat. Persephone was released by [[Hermes]], who had been sent to retrieve her, but because she had tasted food in the underworld, she was obliged to spend a third of each year (the winter months) there, and the remaining part of the year with the gods above.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; With the later writers Ovid and Hyginus, Persephone's time in the underworld becomes half the year.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various local traditions place Persephone's abduction in a different location. The [[Sicily|Sicilians]], among whom her worship was probably introduced by the Corinthian and Megarian colonists, believed that Hades found her in the meadows near [[Enna]], and that a well arose on the spot where he descended with her into the lower world. The [[Crete|Cretans]] thought that their own island had been the scene of the rape, and the [[Eleusis|Eleusinians]] mentioned the Nysian plain in Boeotia, and said that Persephone had descended with Hades into the lower world at the entrance of the western [[Oceanus]]. Later accounts place the rape in [[Attica]], near [[Athens]], or near [[Eleusis]].&lt;ref name="Theoi Project - Persephone"/&gt;

[[File:FredericLeighton-TheReturnofPerspephone(1891).jpg|thumb|left|''The return of Persephone'', by [[Frederic Leighton]] (1891)]]
The [[Homeric]] hymn mentions the ''Nysion'' (or Mysion) which was probably a mythical place. The location of this mythical place may simply be a convention to show that a magically distant [[chthonic]] land of myth was intended in the remote past.&lt;ref name=Nilsson463/&gt; Before Persephone was abducted by Hades, the shepherd Eumolpus and the swineherd [[Eubuleus]] saw a girl in a black chariot driven by an invisible driver being carried off into the earth which had violently opened up. Eubuleus was feeding his pigs at the opening to the underworld when Persephone was abducted by Plouton. His swine were swallowed by the earth along with her, and the myth is an etiology for the relation of pigs with the ancient rites in [[Thesmophoria]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Reference to the Thesmophoria in [[Lucian]]'s ''Dialogues of the Courtesans'' 2.1.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Eleusis]].

In the hymn, Persephone returns and she is reunited with her mother near [[Eleusis]]. Demeter as she has been promised established her mysteries (orgies) when the Eleusinians built for her a temple near the spring of Callichorus. These were awful mysteries which were not allowed to be uttered. The uninitiated would spend a miserable existence in the gloomy space of [[Hades]] after death.{{refn|group=n|Hom. Hymn. to Demeter 470:&lt;br&gt;"Awful mysteries which no one may in any way transgress or pry into or utter, for deep awe of the gods checks the voice. Happy is he among men upon earth who has seen these mysteries; but he who is uninitiate and who has no part in them, never has lot of like good things once he is dead, down in the darkness and gloom".}}

In some versions, [[Ascalaphus]] informed the other deities that Persephone had eaten the pomegranate seeds. When Demeter and her daughter were reunited, the Earth flourished with vegetation and color, but for some months each year, when Persephone returned to the underworld, the earth once again became a barren realm. This is an [[origin myth|origin story]] to explain the seasons.

In an earlier version, [[Hecate]] rescued Persephone. On an Attic [[Red-figure pottery|red-figured]] [[Krater|bell krater]] of c. 440 BC in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], Persephone is rising as if up stairs from a cleft in the earth, while Hermes stands aside; Hecate, holding two torches, looks back as she leads her to the enthroned Demeter.&lt;ref&gt;The figures are unmistakable, as they are inscribed "Persophata, Hermes, Hekate, Demeter"; Gisela M. A. Richter, "An Athenian Vase with the Return of Persephone" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'' '''26'''.10 (October 1931:245–248)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 10th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] encyclopedia ''[[Suda]]'' introduces a goddess of a blessed [[afterlife]] assured to [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic mystery]] initiates. This [[Macaria]] is asserted to be the daughter of Hades, but no mother is mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;Suidas s.v. Makariai, with English translation at [http://www.stoa.org/sol Suda On Line], [http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?db=REAL&amp;field=adlerhw_gr&amp;searchstr=mu,51 Adler number mu 51]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation of the myth===
[[File:Locri Pinax Of Persephone And Hades.jpg|thumb|Pinax of Persephone and Hades from Locri. [[Reggio Calabria]], National Museum of Magna Graecia. ]]
In the myth [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] abducts Persephone to be his wife and the queen of his realm (this is the myth which explains their marriage).&lt;ref&gt;William Hansen (2005) ''Classical Mythology: A Guide to the Mythical World of the Greeks and Romans'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), pp. 180–182.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] (Πλούτων, ''Ploutōn'') was a name for the ruler of [[Greek underworld|the underworld]]; the god was also known as [[Hades]], a name for the underworld itself. The name ''Pluton'' was conflated with that of [[Ploutos]] (Πλούτος ''Ploutos'', "wealth"), a god of wealth, because mineral wealth was found underground, and because [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] as a [[chthonic]] god ruled the deep earth that contained the seeds necessary for a bountiful harvest.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Classical Mythology'', p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Plouton'' is lord of the dead, but as Persephone's husband he has serious claims to the powers of fertility.&lt;ref name=Athanas56&gt;Ap. Athanassakis (2004), ''Hesiod. Theogony, Works and Days, Shield'' ,Johns Hopkins University Press, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Theogony]] of [[Hesiod]], [[Demeter]] was united with the hero [[Iasion]] in [[Crete]] and she bore [[Ploutos]].&lt;ref name=HesTh914/&gt; This union seems to be a reference to a [[hieros gamos]] (ritual copulation) to ensure the earth's fertility.&lt;ref name=Athanas56/&gt; This ritual copulation appears in [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Crete]], in many [[Near East]]ern agricultural societies, and also in the [[Anthesteria]].{{refn|group=n|"This is the time when Zeus mated with Semele, who is also Persephone, and Dionysos was conceived. It is also the time when Dionysos took Ariadne to be His wife, and so we celebrate the marriage of the Basilinna (religious Queen) and the God".
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/JO-Anth.html The Anthesteria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820203409/http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/JO-Anth.html |date=20 August 2007 }} Bibliotheca Arcana (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Martin P. Nilsson|Nilsson]] believes that the original cult of [[Ploutos]] (or [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]) in [[Eleusis]] was similar with the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] cult of the "divine child", who died in order to be reborn. The child was abandoned by his mother and then it was brought up by the powers of nature. Similar myths appear in the cults of [[Hyakinthos]] ([[Amyklai]]), [[Erichthonios]] ([[Athens]]), and later in the cult of [[Dionysos]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, pp. 215–219&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek version of the abduction myth is related to grain&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;important and rare in the Greek environment&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;and the return (ascent) of Persephone was celebrated at the autumn sowing. [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] ([[Ploutos]]) represents the wealth of the grain that was stored in underground silos or ceramic jars (''pithoi''), during summer months. Similar subterranean ''pithoi'' were used in ancient times for burials and [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] is fused with [[Hades]], the King of the realm of the dead. During summer months, the Greek ''grain-Maiden'' (Kore) is lying in the grain of the underground silos in the realm of Hades, and she is fused with Persephone, the Queen of the Underworld. At the beginning of the autumn, when the seeds of the old crop are laid on the fields, she ascends and is reunited with her mother [[Demeter]], for at that time the old crop and the new meet each other. For the initiated, this union was the symbol of the eternity of human life that flows from the generations which spring from each other.&lt;ref name=Nilssonpopular51&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/gpr/ |title=Martin Nilsson, ''The Greek popular religion'', The religion of Eleusis, pp 51-54 |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date=2005-11-08 |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967) Vol I, pp. 473–474.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arcadian myths===
[[File:Lycosoura-group.jpg|thumb|left|From L-R, Artemis, Demeter, Veil of Despoina, Anytus, Tritoness from the throne of [[Despoina]] at [[Lycosura]]. [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]]]

The primitive myths of isolated [[Arcadia]] seem to be related to the first Greek-speaking people who came from the north-east during the [[bronze age]]. [[Despoina]] (the mistress), the goddess of the Arcadian mysteries, is the daughter of Demeter and [[Poseidon]] ''Hippios'' (horse), who represents the river spirit of the underworld that appears as a horse as often happens in northern-European folklore. He pursues the mare-Demeter and from the union she bears the horse [[Arion (mythology)|Arion]] and a daughter who originally had the form or the shape of a mare. The two goddesses were not clearly separated and they were closely connected with the springs and the animals. They were related with the god of rivers and springs; Poseidon and especially with [[Artemis]], the [[Mistress of the Animals]] who was the first [[nymph]].&lt;ref name=Nilsson462/&gt; According to the Greek tradition a hunt-goddess preceded the harvest goddess.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 2.30.2&lt;/ref&gt; In Arcadia, [[Demeter]] and Persephone were often called ''Despoinai'' (Δέσποιναι, "the mistresses") in historical times. They are the two Great Goddesses of the [[Arcadia]]n cults, and evidently they come from a more primitive religion.&lt;ref name=Nilsson463/&gt; The Greek god [[Poseidon]] probably substituted the companion (''Paredros'', Πάρεδρος) of the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Mother goddess|Great goddess]]&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson, VoI, p. 444&lt;/ref&gt;
in the Arcadian mysteries.

===Queen of the Underworld===
Persephone held an ancient role as the dread queen of the Underworld, within which tradition it was forbidden to speak her name. This tradition comes from her conflation with the very old [[chthonic]] divinity [[Despoina]] (the mistress), whose real name could not be revealed to anyone except those initiated to her mysteries.&lt;ref name="Pausanias 8.37.9"/&gt; As goddess of death she was also called a daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Styx]],&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus, ''Library'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0022:text=Library:book=1:chapter=3&amp;highlight=persephone 1.3].&lt;/ref&gt; the river that formed the boundary between [[Earth]] and the underworld. [[Homer]] describes her as the formidable, venerable majestic queen of the shades, who carries into effect the curses of men upon the souls of the dead, along with her husband Hades.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]]. ''[[Odyssey]]'', 10.494&lt;/ref&gt; In the reformulation of Greek mythology expressed in the ''[[Orphic Hymns]]'', Dionysus and Melinoe are separately called children of Zeus and Persephone.&lt;ref&gt;''Orphica'', 26, 71&lt;/ref&gt; Groves sacred to her stood at the western extremity of the earth on the frontiers of the lower world, which itself was called "house of Persephone".&lt;ref&gt;[[Odyssey]] 10.491, 10.509&lt;/ref&gt;

Her central myth served as the context for the secret rites of regeneration at [[Eleusinian Mysteries|Eleusis]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Károly Kerényi]], ''Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter'', 1967, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; which promised immortality to initiates.

==Cult of Persephone==
Persephone was worshipped along with her mother [[Demeter]] and in the same mysteries. Her cults included agrarian magic, dancing, and rituals. The priests used special vessels and holy symbols, and the people participated with rhymes. In [[Eleusis]] there is evidence of sacred laws and other inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1985), pp. 285–289&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cult of Demeter and the Maiden is found at [[Attica]], in the main festivals [[Thesmophoria]] and [[Eleusinian mysteries]] and in a lot of local cults. These festivals were almost always celebrated at the autumn sowing, and at full-moon according to the Greek tradition. In some local cults the feasts were dedicated to Demeter.

===Thesmophoria===
{{Main article|Thesmophoria}}
[[File:Kore55.jpg|thumb|left|Kore, daughter of Demeter, celebrated with her mother by the [[Thesmophoriazusae]] (women of the festival). [[Acropolis Museum]], Athens]]
[[Thesmophoria]], were celebrated in [[Athens]], and the festival was widely spread in Greece. This was a festival of secret women-only rituals connected with marriage customs and commemorated the third of the year, in the month [[Attic calendar|Pyanepsion]], when Kore was abducted and Demeter abstained from her role as goddess of harvest and growth. The ceremony involved sinking sacrifices into the earth by night and retrieving the decaying remains of pigs that had been placed in the ''megara'' of Demeter (trenches and pits or natural clefts in rock), the previous year. These were placed on altars, mixed with seeds, then planted.&lt;ref name=Burkert240&gt;Burkert (1985), pp. 240–243&lt;/ref&gt; Pits rich in organic matter at Eleusis have been taken as evidence that the Thesmophoria was held there as well as in other [[deme]]s of [[Attica]].&lt;ref&gt;Clinton, ''Greek Sanctuaries'', p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; This agrarian magic was also used in the cult of the earth-goddesses [[potnia]]i (mistresses) in the [[Cabeiri]]an, and in [[Knidos]].&lt;ref name=Nilsson151&gt;Potniai: ''Pelarge'' daughter of ''Potnieus'' is connected with the cult of Demeter in the Cabeirian : Pausanias 9.25,8, Nilsson (1967) Vol I pp. 151, 463&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival was celebrated over three days. The first was the "way up" to the sacred space, the second, the day of feasting when they ate [[pomegranate]] seeds and the third was a meat feast in celebration of [[Kalligeneia]] a goddess of beautiful birth. [[Zeus]] penetrated the mysteries as [[Zeus]]- [[Eubuleus]]&lt;ref name=Burkert240/&gt; which is an [[euphemistically|euphemistical]] name of [[Hades]] ([[Chthonic|Chthonios]] [[Zeus]]).&lt;ref name=Rhode206 /&gt; In the original myth which is an etiology for the ancient rites, Eubuleus was a swineherd who was feeding his pigs at the opening to the underworld when Persephone was abducted by Plouton. His swine were swallowed by the earth along with her.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Eleusinian mysteries===
{{Main article|Eleusinian mysteries}}
[[File:Eleusis2.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Eleusinian mysteries|Eleusinian trio]]: Persephone, [[Triptolemus]] and [[Demeter]] on a marble bas-relief from [[Eleusis]], 440–430 BC. [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]]] 
The [[Eleusinian mysteries]] was a festival celebrated at the autumn sowing in the city of [[Eleusis]]. Inscriptions refer to "the Goddesses" accompanied by the agricultural god [[Triptolemos]] (probably son of [[Gaia (mythology)|Ge]] and [[Oceanus]]),&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo Apollodorus Biblioteca IV.2&lt;/ref&gt; and "the God and the Goddess" (Persephone and Plouton) accompanied by [[Eubuleus]] who probably led the way back from the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Klinton (1993), ''Greek Sanctuaries: New Approaches'', Routledge, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The myth was represented in a cycle with three phases: the "descent", the "search", and the "ascent", with contrasted emotions from sorrow to joy which roused the mystae to exultation. The main theme was the ascent of Persephone and the reunion with her mother Demeter.&lt;ref name=Nilssonpopular51/&gt; The festival activities included dancing, probably across the Rharian field, where according to the myth the first grain grew.

At the beginning of the feast, the priests filled two special vessels and poured them out, the one towards the west, and the other towards the east. The people looking both to the sky and the earth shouted in a magical rhyme "rain and conceive". In a ritual, a child was initiated from the hearth (the divine fire). It was the ritual of the "divine child" who originally was [[Ploutos]]. In the Homeric hymn the ritual is connected with the myth of the agricultural god [[Triptolemos]]&lt;ref name="Wunderlich 1972 p. 134"/&gt; The high point of the celebration was "an ear of grain cut in silence", which represented the force of the new life. The idea of immortality didn't exist in the mysteries at the beginning, but the initiated believed that they would have a better fate in the underworld. Death remained a reality, but at the same time a new beginning like the plant which grows from the buried seed.&lt;ref name=Burkert285/&gt; In the earliest depictions Persephone is an armless and legless deity, who grows out of the ground.&lt;ref name=Burkert42/&gt;

===Local cults===

Local cults of Demeter and Kore existed in Greece, [[Asia Minor]], [[Sicily]], [[Magna Graecia]], and [[Libya]].
* '''Attica''':&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson (1967) Vol I, pp. 463–465&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Athens]], in the [[mystery religions|mysteries]] of [[Agrae]]. This was a local cult near the river [[Ilissos]]. They were celebrated during spring in the month [[Attic calendar|Anthesterion]]. Later they became an obligation for the participants of the "greater" [[Eleusinian mysteries]]. There was a temple of Demeter and Kore and an image of [[Triptolemos]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias 1.14,1: Nilsson (1967), Vol I, pp. 668–670&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Demeter in horse chariot w daughter kore 83d40m wikiC Tempio Y di Selinunte sec VIa.JPG|thumb|Demeter drives her horse-drawn chariot containing her daughter Persephone at [[Selinunte]], [[Sicily]] 6th century BC]]
** [[Piraeus]]: The ''Skirophoria'', a festival related to the [[Thesmophoria]].
** [[Megara]]: Cult of Demeter ''thesmophoros'' and Kore. The city was named after its ''megara'' .&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias I 42,6 , Nilsson (1967), ''Vol I'', p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Aegina]]: Cult of Demeter ''thesmophoros'' and Kore.
** [[Phlya]], near Koropi, in the [[mystery religions|mysteries]] of Phlya: These have very old roots and were probably originally dedicated to Demeter [[Pandora|Anesidora]], Kore, and [[Zeus]] Ktesios, who was the god of the underground stored grain. Pausanias mentions a temple of Demeter-Anesidora, Kore [[Greek primordial deities|Protogone]], and Zeus Ktesios. The surname Protogonos, indicates a later [[Orphic]] influence. It seems that the mysteries were related to the mysteries of [[Andania]] in [[Messene]].&lt;ref name=Nilsson668&gt;Nilsson (1967), ''Vol I'', pp. 668–670&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Boeotia''':
** [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]], which Zeus is said to have given to her as an acknowledgement for a favour she had bestowed upon him.&lt;ref&gt;Scholia ad. Euripides Phoen. 487&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] records a grove of [[Cabeiri]]an Demeter and the Maid, three miles outside the gates of Thebes, where a ritual was performed, so-called on the grounds that Demeter gave it to the [[Cabeiri]], who established it at Thebes. The Thebans told Pausanias that some inhabitants of [[Naupactus]] had performed the same rituals there, and had met with divine vengeance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 9.25.5&lt;/ref&gt; The Cabeirian mysteries were introduced from [[Asia Minor]] at the end of the archaic period. Nothing is known of the older cult, and it seems that the Cabeiri were originally wine-[[daemon (mythology)|daemons]]. Inscriptions from the temple in Thebes mention the old one as Cabir, and the new one as son (pais), who are different.&lt;ref name=Nilsson668/&gt; According to Pausanias, Pelarge, the daughter of Potnieus, was connected with the cult of Demeter in the Cabeirian ([[potnia]]i).&lt;ref name=Nilsson151/&gt;
** A feast in Boeotia, in the month ''Demetrios'' ([[Attic calendar|Pyanepsion]]), probably similar with the [[Thesmophoria]].
** [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]]: Cult of Demeter and Kore in a feast named [[Thesmophoria]] but probably different. It was celebrated in the summer month ''Bukatios''.&lt;ref name=Nilsson463/&gt;&lt;ref name=Diodor&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]] (v.4.7) :"At [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] or [[Delos]] the festival occurred two months earlier, so any seed-sowing connection was not intrinsic."&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Peloponnese''' (except Arcadia)&lt;ref name=Nilsson463/&gt;
** '''Hermione''': An old cult of Demeter [[chthonic|Chthonia]], Kore, and ''Klymenos'' ([[Hades]]). Cows were pushed into the temple, and then they were killed by four women. It is possible that Hermione was a mythical name, the place of the souls.&lt;ref name=Rhode206/&gt;
** [[Asine]]: Cult of Demeter [[chthonic|Chthonia]]. The cult seems to be related to the original cult of Demeter in Hermione.&lt;ref name=Rhode206/&gt;
** [[Lakonia]]: Temple of Demeter ''Eleusinia'' near [[Taygetos]]. The feast was named ''Eleuhinia'', and the name was given before the relation of Demeter with the cult of [[Eleusis]].
** [[Lakonia]] at Aigila: Dedicated to Demeter. Men were excluded.
** near [[Sparta]]: Cult of Demeter and Kore, the Demeters (Δαμάτερες, "Damaters"). According to Hesychius, the feast lasted three days (Thesmophoria).
** [[Corinth]]: Cult of Demeter, Kore, and Pluton.&lt;ref name=Rhode206/&gt;
** [[Triphylia]] in [[Elis]]: Cult of Demeter, Kore, and Hades.&lt;ref name=Rhode206/&gt;

* '''Arcadia'''&lt;ref name=Nilsson478&gt;Nilsson, pp. 477–480 :"The Arcadian Great goddesses"&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Pheneos]] : Mysteries of Demeter ''Thesmia'' and Demeter ''Eleusinia''. The Eleusinian cult was introduced later. The priest took the ''holy book'' from a natural cleft. He used the mask of Demeter ''Kidaria'', and he hit his stick on the earth, in a kind of agrarian magic. An Arcadian dance was named kidaris.
** '''Pallantion''' near [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]]: Cult of Demeter and Kore.
** [[Karyai (ancient city)|Karyai]]: Cult of Kore and Pluton.&lt;ref name=Rhode206/&gt;

** [[Lycosura]],{{Main article|Despoina}} Cult of Demeter and [[Despoina]]. In the portico of the temple of Despoina there was a tablet with the inscriptions of the mysteries. In front of the temple there was an altar to Demeter and another to Despoine, after which was one of the Great Mother. By the sides stood [[Artemis]] and [[Anytos]], the Titan who brought up Despoine. Besides the temple, there was also a hall where the Arcadians celebrated the mysteries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Georgikos/Despoine.html |title=Pausanias 8.37.1,8.38.2 |publisher=Theoi.com |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/image?img=1993.01.0583&amp;redirect=true |title=Reconstruction of interior of Sanctuary of Despoina |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fire was always burning in front of the temple of [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] (the goat-god), the god of the wild, shepherds and flocks.

==Modern reception==
{{Main article|Persephone in popular culture}}
In 1934, [[Igor Stravinsky]] based his [[melodrama]] ''[[Perséphone (Stravinsky)|Perséphone]]'' on Persephone's story. In 1961, Frederick Ashton of the Royal Ballet appropriated Stravinsky's score, to choreograph a ballet starring Svetlana Beriosova as Persephone.

Persephone also appears many times in popular culture. Featured in a variety of young adult novels such as "Persephone"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15724908-persephone|title=Persephone (Daughters of Zeus, #1)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Kaitlin Bevis, "Persephone's Orchard"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17790646-persephone-s-orchard|title=Persephone's Orchard|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Molly Ringle, "The Goddess Test" by Aimee Carter, "The Goddess Letters" by Carol Orlock, and "Abandon" by Meg Cabot, her story has also been treated by Suzanne Banay Santo in "Persephone Under the Earth" in the light of women's spirituality. Here Santo treats the mythic elements in terms of maternal sacrifice to the burgeoning sexuality of an adolescent daughter. Accompanied by the classic, sensual paintings of Frederic Lord Leighton and William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Santo portrays Persephone not as a victim but as a woman in quest of sexual depth and power, transcending the role of daughter, though ultimately returning to it as an awakened Queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Persephone Under the Earth|publisher=Red Butterfly Publications|author=Santo, Suzanne Banay|year=2012|isbn=0-9880914-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Photoconductivity''' is an [[optical phenomenon|optical]] and [[electrical phenomenon]] in which a material becomes more [[electric conductance|electrically conductive]] due to the absorption of [[electromagnetic radiation]] such as [[Visible spectrum|visible light]], [[ultraviolet]] light, [[infrared]] light, or [[gamma rays|gamma radiation]].&lt;ref name="radio conductivity"&gt;{{cite journal |first=L. A. |last=DeWerd |author2=P. R. Moran |pmid=634229 |title=Solid-state electrophotography with Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; |journal=Medical Physics |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=23–26 |year=1978|bibcode = 1978MedPh...5...23D | doi=10.1118/1.594505 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When light is absorbed by a material such as a [[semiconductor]], the number of free electrons and [[electron hole]]s increases and raises its electrical conductivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saghaei|first1=Jaber|last2=Fallahzadeh|first2=Ali|last3=Saghaei|first3=Tayebeh|title=Vapor treatment as a new method for photocurrent enhancement of UV photodetectors based on ZnO nanorods|journal=Sensors and Actuators A: Physical|date=June 2016|volume=247|pages=150–155|doi=10.1016/j.sna.2016.05.050|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924424716302849}}&lt;/ref&gt; To cause excitation, the light that strikes the semiconductor must have enough energy to raise electrons across the [[band gap]], or to excite the impurities within the band gap. When a [[Biasing|bias]] [[voltage]] and a load [[resistor]] are used in series with the semiconductor, a voltage drop across the load resistors can be measured when the change in electrical conductivity of the material varies the current through the circuit.

Classic examples of photoconductive materials include :
* the [[conductive polymer]] poly[[N-Vinylcarbazole|vinylcarbazole]],&lt;ref name="OrganicPhotoconductors"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/cr00017a020 |first=Kock Yee |last=Law |title=Organic photoconductive materials: recent trends and developments |journal=Chemical Reviews, American Chemical Society |volume=93 |pages=449–486 |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; used extensively in [[photocopy]]ing ([[xerography]]); 
* [[Lead(II) sulfide|lead sulfide]], used in infrared detection applications, such as the U.S. [[Sidewinder missile|Sidewinder]] and Soviet (now Russian) [[Vympel K-13|Atoll]] [[Infrared homing|heat-seeking]] [[missile]]s; 
* [[selenium]], employed in early television and [[xerography]].

==Applications==
{{further|Photoresistor}}
When a photoconductive material is connected as part of a circuit, it functions as a [[resistor]] whose [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] depends on the [[intensity (physics)|light intensity]]. In this context, the material is called a [[photoresistor]] (also called ''light-dependent resistor'' or ''photoconductor''). The most common application of photoresistors is as [[photodetector]]s, i.e. devices that measure light intensity. Photoresistors are not the ''only'' type of photodetector—other types include [[charge-coupled device]]s (CCDs), [[photodiode]]s and [[phototransistor]]s—but they are among the most common. Some photodetector applications in which photoresistors are often used include camera light meters, street lights, clock radios, [[infrared detector]]s, nanophotonic systems and low-dimensional photo-sensors devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hernández-Acosta |first1=M A |last2=Trejo-Valdez |first2=M |last3=Castro-Chacón |first3=J H |last4=Torres-San Miguel |first4=C R |last5=Martínez-Gutiérrez |first5=H |last6=Torres-Torres |first6=C |title=Chaotic signatures of photoconductive Cu                            ZnSnS                            nanostructures explored by Lorenz attractors |journal=New Journal of Physics |date=23 February 2018 |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=023048 |doi=10.1088/1367-2630/aaad41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms of plankton==
[[File:Dolichospermum crassum.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Phytoplankton]]
[[File:Evadne spinifera.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Zooplankton]]
[[File:Maldives manta ray.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A [[manta ray]] consuming plankton]]
[[Phytoplankton]] are usually [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] one-celled plant organisms. These organisms are usually found near the surface of the water due to their need for light energy for their photosynthetic processes. Phytoplankton provide most of the oxygen that is in the water and provide a large amount of food for other organisms in the water column. 

[[Zooplankton]], in contrast, are [[heterotroph]]ic plankton, animals which ingest nutrients rather than producing it via chemical reactions. Some taxa are planktonic for only part of their life cycle.

==Forms of planktivory==
Planktivores ingest one or both types of plankton. ''[[Titanichthys]]'' was the first massive [[vertebrate]] pelagic planktivore, with a lifestyle similar to that of the modern basking, [[whale]], or [[megamouth]] [[sharks]].&lt;ref name="Boyle2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Boyle | first1=L. Jog. | title=New information on Titanichthys (Placodermi, Arthrodira) from the Cleveland Shale (Upper Devonian) of Ohio, USA | journal=Journal of Paleontology | year=2017 | pages=1–19 |doi=10.1017/jpa.2016.136}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most fish are planktivores during part or all of their life cycles, especially when they are larvae.&lt;ref name=lazzaro&gt;Lazzaro, X. (1987). [http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_5/b_fdi_18-19/24288.pdf A review of planktivorous fishes: Their evolution, feeding behaviours, selectivities, and impacts.] ''Hydrobiologia'', 146, 97-167.&lt;/ref&gt; There are obligate planktivores, which feed only on plankton, and facultative planktivores, which take plankton when available but eat other types of food as well.&lt;ref name=lazzaro/&gt; The [[American gizzard shad|gizzard shad]] (''Dorosoma cepedianum''), for example, has a voracious appetite for various forms of plankton across its life cycle. It is an obligate planktivore when it is a juvenile, in part due to its very small mouth size. As it grows it becomes an omnivore, taking phytoplankton, zooplankton, and larger pieces of nutritious detritus. Adult gizzard shad consume large volumes of zooplankton until it becomes scarce, then turn to organic debris for food.&lt;ref name=stein&gt;Stein, Roy A., et al. (1995). [https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/37944/1/20071201-AEL-SteinR-Food-web.pdf Food-web regulation by a planktivore: exploring the generality of the trophic cascade hypothesis.] ''Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences'' 52(11): 2518-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Planktivores obtain food in two ways. Particulate feeders eat planktonic items selectively. [[Filter feeder]]s process volumes of water and strain food items en masse.&lt;ref name=lazzaro/&gt; "Tow-net" filter feeders swim rapidly with mouths open to filter the water, and pumping filter feeders suck in water via pumping actions. The latter includes stationary animals, such as corals.&lt;ref name=lazzaro/&gt; Another form of filter feeding is a "gulping" behavior, in which the animal takes boluses of water; the [[alewife]] (''Alosa pseudoharengus'') feeds in this manner.&lt;ref name=lazzaro/&gt;

==Planktivore ecology==
Plankton are among the lower [[trophic level]]s in [[food chain]]s. Planktivores affect the food chain by altering the populations of plankton in various ways, a process known as the [[trophic cascade]]. The gizzard shad, again, plays this role. It consumes phytoplankton when it is small, zooplankton when it is larger, and other foods when it eliminates the zooplankton in the area. It incidentally controls the populations of other fish that depend on zooplankton, such as [[bluegill]] (''Lepomis macrochiris'').&lt;ref name=devries&gt;DeVries, D. R., and R. A. Stein. (1992). [https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/37032/20090306-AEL-SteinR-Complex.pdf?sequence=1 Complex interactions between fish and zooplankton: quantifying the role of an open-water planktivore.] ''Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences'' 49(6): 1216-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''polar see-saw''' (also: ''Bipolar seesaw'') is the phenomenon that temperature changes in the northern and southern hemispheres may be out of phase. The hypothesis states that large changes, for example when the glaciers are intensely growing or depleting, in the formation of ocean bottom water in both poles take a long time to exert their effect in the other hemisphere. Estimates of the period of delay vary, one typical estimate is 1500 years. This is usually studied in the context of ice-cores taken from [[Antarctica]] and [[Greenland]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2497">The '''Pre-Pastonian Stage''' or '''Baventian Stage''' (from [[Easton Bavents]] in [[Suffolk]]), is the name for an early [[Pleistocene]] stage used in the [[British Isles]]. It precedes the [[Pastonian Stage]] and follows the [[Bramertonian Stage]]. This stage ended 1.806 [[annum|Ma]] (million years ago) at the end of Marine Isotope Stage 65. It is not currently known when this stage started. The Pre-Pastonian Stage is equivalent to the Tiglian C4c Stage of Europe and the Pre-Illinoian J glaciation of the early [[Pre-Illinoian|Pre-Illinoian Stage]] of North America.&lt;ref name="McMillan11"&gt;McMillan, A.A., 2005, ''A provisional Quaternary and Neogene lithostratigraphic framework Great Britain'', Netherland Journal of Geosciences. vol. 84, no. 2, pp, 87-107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GibbardOthers2007"&gt;Gibbard, P.L., S.

[[File:Red Cross Parcel.jpg|right|thumb|250px|British Red Cross parcel from [[World War II]]]]
'''Red Cross parcel''' refers to packages containing mostly [[food]], [[tobacco]] and personal [[hygiene]] items sent by the [[Red Cross|International Association of the Red Cross]] to [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] during the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second World Wars]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as at other times.  It can also refer to medical parcels and so-called "release parcels" provided during World War II.  The Red Cross arranged them in accordance with the provisions of the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|Geneva Convention of 1929]].  During World War II these packages augmented the often-meager and deficient diets in the [[Prisoner-of-war camp|PoW camps]], contributing greatly to prisoner survival and an increase in morale.  Modern Red Cross food parcels provide basic food and sanitary needs for persons affected by natural disasters, wars, political upheavals or similar events.

More recent catastrophes involving delivery of Red Cross parcels include events in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Thailand]] and [[Great Britain]].

==World War I==
The Australian Red Cross reported dispatching a total of 395,695 food parcels and 36,339 clothing parcels to Allied PoWs in [[Germany]] and [[Turkey]] during the course of [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/blog/2009/03/16/red-cross-records-from-the-first-world-war/ Red Cross Records From the First World War]. Retrieved on 2010-09-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Food parcels were also sent to desperate civilians in Belgium and France.

British PoWs during World War I were supplied with food parcels by the British Central Prisoners of War Committee of the [[Joint War Organisation]], the combined Red Cross and Order of St John. When the central powers refused to allow food to be sent to prisoners of war by the British government, the British Red Cross had stepped forward. Packages containing food and conveniences were sent fortnightly to PoW. Donations collected from the public for these parcels reached £674,908 19s 1d. A total of £5,145,458 16s 9d was spent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redcross.org.uk/~/media/BritishRedCross/Documents/Who%20we%20are/History%20and%20archives/Fundraising%20during%20the%20First%20World%20War.pdf |title=Fundraising during the First World War |publisher=Red Cross |access-date=1 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001115628/http://www.redcross.org.uk/~/media/BritishRedCross/Documents/Who%20we%20are/History%20and%20archives/Fundraising%20during%20the%20First%20World%20War.pdf# |archive-date=1 October 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the war, some 9,000,000 food parcels and 800,000 clothing parcels had been despatched by various organisations to British prisoners abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yarnall|Yarnall (2011)]], p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

French PoWs were required to pay for parcels sent to them through a [[France|French]] commission; these packages included potted chicken, various [[pâté]]s, and even bottled [[wine]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl P. Dennett, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RHBHAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;sig=bVZhXW1sG2ILp0PDo2pjCTHR4sA&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Prisoners of the Great War], pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indigent]] French PoWs could receive parcels with lower-quality food for free, from the "Vetement du Prisonnier" which liaised actively with the Croix-Rouge Française.

===American===
The American Red Cross commenced delivery of food parcels to American PoWs in German camps in November 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Carl P. Dennett, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RHBHAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;sig=bVZhXW1sG2ILp0PDo2pjCTHR4sA&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Prisoners of the Great War], pg. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first parcel received by a PoW included the following items:

{{col-start}}
{{col-3}}
*One pound tin of [[corned beef]]
*One pound tin of roast beef
*One pound tin of salmon
*Two pounds of hash
*One pound of jam
*One bar of soap
*Four packages of tobacco
{{col-3}}
*One overshirt
*One undershirt
*Two cans of pork and beans
*One can each of tomatoes, corn and peas
*One pair of drawers
*Two pairs of socks
*Three handkerchiefs
*Two towels
{{col-3}}
*One tube of toothpaste
*Two pounds of hard bread
*One pint of evaporated milk
*One pound of sugar
*One-half pound of coffee
*One toothbrush, comb, shaving brush and "housewife" (sewing kit), plus shaving soap.&lt;ref&gt;Carl P. Dennett, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RHBHAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;sig=bVZhXW1sG2ILp0PDo2pjCTHR4sA&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Prisoners of the Great War], pg. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{col-end}}

Thereafter, further parcels were sent once per week.  These were rotated on a four-week schedule between packages labeled "A", "B", "C" and "D".  Each parcel contained meat, fish, vegetable, bread and fruit items, together with eighty [[cigarette]]s or other tobacco products.&lt;ref&gt;Carl P. Dennett, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RHBHAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;sig=bVZhXW1sG2ILp0PDo2pjCTHR4sA&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Prisoners of the Great War], pp. 29-30.  The contents of each package are contained in the reference.&lt;/ref&gt; Items of [[clothing]] were also provided for American PoWs through the American Red Cross.&lt;ref&gt;Carl P. Dennett, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RHBHAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;sig=bVZhXW1sG2ILp0PDo2pjCTHR4sA&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Prisoners of the Great War], pp. 30-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of the war, German camp guards and other personnel would sometimes steal the contents of these packages, often leaving only bread for the helpless prisoner.  In such events, American camp representatives attempted to make up the loss through stores kept for this purpose in the PoW camps.&lt;ref&gt;Carl P. Dennett, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RHBHAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;sig=bVZhXW1sG2ILp0PDo2pjCTHR4sA&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Prisoners of the Great War], pp. 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

A special agreement between the [[YMCA]] and the American Red Cross resulted in the YMCA providing athletic equipment, books and games for American prisoners in German PoW camps.&lt;ref&gt;Carl P. Dennett, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RHBHAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;sig=bVZhXW1sG2ILp0PDo2pjCTHR4sA&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Prisoners of the Great War], pp. 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
Red Cross food parcels during World War II were mostly provided from Great Britain, the United States (after 1941) and Canada. An Allied PoW might receive any of these packages at any one given time, regardless of his or her own nationality. This was because all such packages were sent from their country of origin to central collection points, where they were subsequently distributed to Axis PoW camps by the International Committee of the Red Cross.

For PoWs held by Axis forces in Europe the parcel route through [[Lisbon]] required escorted ships to bring the crates of parcels, or for British, mail bags full of parcels, to Lisbon, there being no safe conduct agreement. In Portugal, parcels would be loaded onto [[International Committee of the Red Cross|Red Cross]] marked ships with many taken through the [[Marseille-Fos Port|port of Marseilles]], for onward freighting by rail to [[Geneva]], from where they would be sent to various camps by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]].&lt;ref name=KTVega/&gt;&lt;ref name="British Red Cross: Food Parcels"/&gt; [[Barcelona]] was also used as an Iberian transit port, with [[Toulon]] as an alternative French port.&lt;ref name=MISWD/&gt; The returning ships sometimes carried allied civilians and wounded being repatriated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Joan |last=Coles |title=Three years behind barbed wire |publisher=La Haule Books |ISBN=086120 008 X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|69}}

The route from Iberia to the South of France was not safe. The Red Cross ship [[SS Padua]] was damaged by British bombing in [[Genoa]] in 1942 and then sunk by a mine outside Marseilles in October 1943. The [[SS Embla]] was bombed by British aircraft on 6 April 1944 causing a fire, and the same ship was attacked again on 20 April 1944, by American [[Martin B-26 Marauder|B-26 bombers]], who this time sank the ship and killed the ICRC agent. On 6 May the "Christina" was attacked while at anchor in [[Sete]]. This latest act resulted in the ICRC suspending the route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Crossland |title=Britain and the International Committee of the Red Cross, 1939-1945 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan, 2014 |ISBN=9781137399571}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Operation Dragoon]] invasion of Southern France, preliminary bombing in July and the actual invasion in August 1944 put a stop to rail transport&lt;ref name="MISWD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.486th.org/Photos/Stammlager/KU3738/POWs.htm |title=AMERICAN.

The [[SS Vega (1913)|SS Vega]] sailed to the alternative port of [[Military port of Toulon|Toulon]] with parcels in November 1944.

On 8 May 1945 it was reported that 7,000,000 parcels, weighing 35,000 tons were at sea or in warehouses in Britain, Lisbon, Barcelona, Marseilles, Toulon, Geneva and [[Gothenburg]]. A Red Cross representative said that they were not perishable and could be used for distressed civilians and as a flexible reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Red Cross Parcels Surplus |publisher=The Examiner |date=8 May 1945 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British food parcels===
During World War II, The British [[Joint War Organisation]] sent standard food parcels, invalid food parcels, medical supplies, educational books and recreational materials to prisoners of war worldwide. During the conflict, over 20 million standard food parcels were sent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redcross.org.uk/About-us/Who-we-are/Museum-and-archives/Historical-factsheets/Food-parcels |title=Food parcels in the Second World War |publisher=British Red Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typical contents of such a parcel included:

{{col-start}}
{{col-2}}
*{{convert|4|oz|g|abbr=on}} packet of tea
*Tin of [[Cocoa solids|cocoa powder]]
*Bar of milk or plain chocolate (often [[Cadbury Dairy Milk Fruit &amp; Nut]] chocolate, or a similar product)
*Tinned pudding
*Tin of meat roll

{{col-end}}

The Scottish Red Cross parcels were the only ones to contain [[rolled oats]]. Approximately 163,000 parcels were made up each week during World War II.

Sometimes, due to the shortage of parcels, two or even four prisoners would be compelled to share the contents of one Red Cross parcel.&lt;ref name="warlinks.com"/&gt;

===American food parcels===
The [[American Red Cross]] produced 27,000,000 parcels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redcross.org/about-us/history/red-cross-american-history/WWII/specialized-services |title=World War II Specialized War-time Services |publisher=American Red Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before America entered the war, they were supplying, through Geneva, parcels to British, Belgian, French, Polish, Yugoslav, Netherlands, Greek, Norwegian, and Russian prisoners of war. The Philadelphia centre alone was producing 100,000 parcels a month in 1942.&lt;ref name="FWR"&gt;{{cite book |title=Foreign War Relief 1939-1942 |publisher=American Red Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt; A list of the contents of a typical Red Cross parcel received by an American [[U.S. Army Air Corps|airman]] held prisoner in [[Stalag Luft I]] near [[Barth, Germany]] on the [[Baltic Sea]]:

According to this airman, recipients of these parcels were permitted to keep only the cigarettes and chocolate bars; the remainder of the parcel was turned over to the camp cook, who combined them with the contents of other parcels and German PoW rations (usually bread, barley, potatoes, cabbage and horse meat)&lt;ref name="phillipsamoore.com"/&gt; to create daily meals for the prisoners.&lt;ref name="phillipsamoore.com"/&gt;

Cigarettes in the parcels became the [[Barter|preferred medium of exchange]] within the camp, with each individual cigarette valued at 27 cents within Stalag Luft I.&lt;ref name="phillipsamoore.com"/&gt; Similar practices were followed in other PoW camps, as well. Cigarettes were also used to bribe [[Germany|German]] guards to provide the prisoners with outside items that would otherwise have been unavailable to them.&lt;ref name="phillipsamoore.com"/&gt; Tins of [[coffee]], which were hard to come by in Germany late in the war, served this same purpose in many camps.&lt;ref name="warlinks.com"/&gt; Contents of these packages were sometimes pilfered by German guards or other camp personnel, especially toward the end of the war.&lt;ref name="med-dept.com"&gt;[http://med-dept.com/powFood.php The Prisoner of War First Aid Safety Kit].

===Food parcels in the Pacific theater===
In 1942 permission for a Red Cross ship having been refused, permission was granted by Japan for a Diplomatic Neutral ship to be utilised for this purpose. A [[Sweden|Swedish]] vessel, the [[MS Gripsholm (1924)|MS Gripsholm]] delivered 20,000 Red Cross parcels from Canada, America and South Africa and in addition a consignment of 1,000,0000 cigarettes. A second voyage was refused.&lt;ref name=FWR/&gt;

The [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] government in August 1942 announced that no neutral ship, even a Red Cross ship, would be allowed to enter Japanese waters. Red Cross parcels intended for Allied PoWs in Japan were accordingly stockpiled in [[Vladivostok, Russia]], and a single ship was ultimately permitted to transport some of these to Japan in November 1944, which, in turn were carried by Japanese vessel [[MV Awa Maru (1942)|Awa Maru]], carrying Red Cross markings, in March, 1945, to Singapore. How many of these actually reached the PoWs is not known, and the sinking of the Awa Maru on the return trip by a US submarine prevented any future shipments from being made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/red_cross_and_world_war_two.htm The Red Cross in World War II]. Retrieved on 2010-09-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Changi Prison|Changi prison camp]] run by the Japanese in [[Singapore]], on average, a POW received a fraction of one food parcel in the three-and-a half years that the camp was open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/the-red-cross-and-world-war-two/ |title=The Red Cross and World War Two |publisher=History learning site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food parcels in the German Concentration Camps===
In November 1943, the Red Cross received permission from Nazi German authorities to send Red Cross parcels to inmates of [[Concentration Camp|concentration camps]], but only to those whose names and specific locations were known. By May 1945, 105,000 specific individuals had been identified. About 1,112,000 parcels containing 4,500 tons of food were ultimately sent to the camps,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/the-red-cross-and-world-war-two/ |title=The Red Cross and World War Two |publisher=The History Learning Site}}&lt;/ref&gt; including those at [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], [[Buchenwald]], [[Ravensbrück]], [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]], [[Theresienstadt]] and [[Auschwitz]]. In addition to food, these parcels also contained clothing and pharmaceutical items.&lt;ref&gt;[http://servv89pn0aj.sn.sourcedns.com/~gbpprorg/judicial-inc/a_letter_from_auschwitz_1943.htm A Letter from Auschwitz: 1943].

===German PoWs after World War II===
Three months after the [[Surrender of Germany|German surrender]] in May 1945, General [[Dwight Eisenhower]] issued an order classifying all surrendered soldiers within the [[American Zone of Occupation]] as [[Disarmed Enemy Forces]], rather than Prisoners of War. Accordingly, the Red Cross was denied the right to visit German PoWs in American prison camps, and delivery of Red Cross parcels to them was forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebList?ReadForm&amp;id=375&amp;t=com Commentaries on the Convention (III) relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War] [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/375-590008?OpenDocument Article 5] "One category of military personnel which was refused the advantages of the Convention in the course of the Second World War comprised German and Japanese troops who fell into enemy hands on the capitulation of their countries in 1945 (6). The German capitulation was both political, involving the dissolution of the Government, and military, whereas the Japanese capitulation was only military. Moreover, the situation was different since Germany was a party to the 1929 Convention and Japan was not. Nevertheless, the German and Japanese troops were considered as surrendered enemy personnel and were deprived of the protection provided by the 1929 Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War. The Allied authorities took the view that unconditional surrender amounted to giving a free hand to the Detaining Powers as to the treatment they might give to military personnel who fell into their hands following the capitulation. In fact, these men were frequently in a very different situation from that of their comrades who had been taken prisoner during the hostilities, since very often they had not even gone into [p.76] action against the enemy. Although on the whole the treatment given to surrendered enemy personnel was fairly favourable, it presented certain disadvantages: prisoners in this category had their personal property impounded without any receipt being given; they had no spokesman to represent them before the Detaining Power; officers received no pay and other ranks, although compelled to work, got no wages; in any penal proceedings they had the benefit of none of the guarantees provided by the Convention. Most important of all, these men had no legal status and were at the entire mercy of the victor. Fortunately, they were well treated but this is no reason to overlook the fact that they were deprived of any status and all guarantees."&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1946 the International Red Cross was finally allowed to provide limited amounts of food aid to prisoners of war in the U.S. occupation zone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/57jnwx?opendocument ICRC in WW II: German prisoners of war in Allied hands] [[International Red Cross]] 2 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar study on Red Cross parcels and Canadian PoWs===
The Canadian government conducted a detailed study of the effect of the Red Cross parcels on the health and morale of Canadian PoWs shortly after the end of World War II. Over 5,000 former PoWs were interviewed, and Canadian authorities determined that a significant number of soldiers did not get the intended one parcel per man per week; most had to make do with one-half of a parcel per week, or even less on some occasions. Soldiers were asked to state their preferences with regard to specific contents of the parcels: the most popular item turned out to be the biscuits, with butter a close second, followed (in order) by meat, milk (powdered and other), chocolate, cigarettes, tea, jam, cereals, cheese and coffee.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; The Canadian parcel was preferred to British, American or New Zealand-issued parcels, claiming that the Canadian parcels had "greater bulk", "lasted longer", and/or had "more food".&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

With regard to especially disliked foods, the Canadian respondents (over 4,200 of the interviewed PoWs) expressed the greatest distaste for the vegetables and fish enclosed in the food parcels (about fifteen percent of the total number of respondents), followed (in order) by condiments, egg powder, cereals, fat, cheese, desserts, sweets, beverages, jams, biscuits and milk. However, except for the first two items on that list, all of these were named by only a minuscule percentage of the total number of respondents.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

==Red Cross medical kits==

===American===
A second type of parcel delivered through the Red Cross during World War II was the Red Cross Prisoner of War First Aid Safety Kit, which was supplied by the American Red Cross for distribution through the International Committee.  Such parcels generally held the following items:

*A twelve-page booklet with instructions for use of the enclosed medical supplies, printed in English, French, German, Polish and Yugoslav
*Ten packages of sterilized [[gauze#Uses and types|gauze]], in two different sizes
*One package containing 500 [[laxative]] pills
*Two packages containing 500 [[aspirin]] tablets each
*Twelve gauze bandages
*Two cans of insecticide powder
*Four tubes of [[boric acid]] antiseptic ointment
*Two packages containing 500 [[sodium bicarbonate]] tablets each
*Two tubes of [[Salicylic acid|Salicylic ointment]] (for treatment of athlete's foot and similar fungal diseases)
*Two tubes of [[Merbromin#Mercurochrome|Mercuric]] antiseptic ointment
*Four tubes of [[Sulfur#Pharmaceuticals|sulphur]] ointment (for treatment of skin diseases)
*One box containing 100 [[Band-Aids]]
*Two rolls of adhesive tape
*Two {{convert|1|oz|g|adj=on}} packages of absorbent cotton
*Safety pins, forceps, soap, disinfectants and scissors.&lt;ref name="med-dept.com"/&gt;

Other kits issued to some PoWs through the American Red Cross contained a few differences in contents, but were still generally similar to the above.&lt;ref&gt;[http://med-dept.com/powFood.php The Prisoner of War First Aid Safety Kit]. See kit mentioned as being provided by Parke, Davis and Co. Retrieved 2010-09-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===British===
The British Red Cross also supplied Medical Parcels to Allied PoWs during the war. Prior to 15 June 1942 these kits generally consisted of:

*A general parcel containing cotton wool, safety pins, soap, aspirin tablets and ointment
*A disinfectant parcel
*Special parcels containing thermometers and dressing scissors.

After 15 June 1942 the British kits were changed.  The new kits contained:

*An invalid food unit consisting of two parcels – milk and food
*A medical stores unit consisting of four parcels:
::"Medical 1" contained soap and [[disinfectant]]
::"Medical 2" contained sodium bicarbonate, [[Dover's powder]], lung balsam, [[ferric subsulfate solution]], [[Zinc oxide#Medicine|zinc ointment]], [[Rhamnus purshiana|cascara]], zinc oxide powder, [[Formaldehyde#Disinfectant and biocide|formalin]] throat tablets, ammoniated mercury ointment, flexoplast, lint, cotton wool, gauze, [[Vitamin C#Supplements|Vitamin-C tablets]], pile ointment, [[sulphapyridine]] tablets, [[magnesium trisilicate]], and oxide plaster
::"Medical 3 and 4" contained additional quantities of the supplies found in "Medical 2", adding to them [[Medicinal clay#Skin conditions|kaoline poultice]], [[Vitamin A]] and [[Vitamin D]] tablets, [[TCP (antiseptic)]], aspirin, Bemax, [[sulphanilamide]] and toilet paper.&lt;ref name="British Red Cross Medical Supplies"&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2PMed-pt2-c5-8.html British Red Cross Medical Supplies]. Retrieved on 2010-09-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, German and [[Italy|Italian]] authorities sometimes permitted British prisoner hospitals to procure equipment from England via the Red Cross, including [[microscope]]s, [[sterilizer]]s, material for manufacturing [[artificial limb]]s, medical instruments, [[vaccine]]s, drugs and even games and other recreational materials.&lt;ref name="British Red Cross Medical Supplies"/&gt;

==Modern Red Cross parcels==
Following the collapse of the former [[Soviet Union]], many pensioners in the newly independent Republic of Georgia were left destitute by the resulting collapse of the Georgian economy and the inability of their meager pensions to keep up with [[inflation]]. The Red Cross, with the financial support of the [[Germany|German]] government, assisted approximately 500,000 of these mostly elderly people with food parcels over a seven-year period during the 1990s.  {{as of|2001}}, more than 12,000 were still dependent upon Red Cross food assistance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifrc.org/Docs/News/01/040502/ Lone Pensioners in Georgia receive food parcels from the Red Cross].

'''Robert John Gibbings''' (23 March 1889 – 19 January 1958) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] artist and author who was most noted for his work as a [[wood engraver]] and sculptor, and for his books on travel and natural history.&lt;ref name=Andrews&gt;Martin J. Andrews,  ''The Life and Work of Robert Gibbings'' (Bicester, Primrose Hill Press, 2003), {{ISBN|1-901648-31-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Noel Rooke]] he was one of the founder members of the [[Society of Wood Engravers]] in 1920,&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Selborne, 'The Society of Wood Engravers: the early years’ in ''Craft History 1'' (1988), published by Combined Arts.&lt;/ref&gt; and was a major influence in the revival of wood engraving in the twentieth century.

==His early life==

Gibbings was born in Cork into a middle-class family.  His father, the Reverend Edward Gibbings, was a [[Church of Ireland]] minister. His mother, Caroline, was the daughter of [[Robert Day (antiquarian)|Robert Day]], Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland]] and president of The Cork Historical and Archaeological Society.  He grew up in the town of [[Kinsale]] where his father was the rector of St. Multose Church.&lt;ref name=Andrews/&gt;

He studied medicine for three years at [[University College Cork]] before deciding to persuade his parents to allow him to take up art.  He studied under the painter Harry Scully in Cork and later at the [[Slade School of Art]] and the [[Central School of Art and Design]].&lt;ref name=Andrews/&gt;

During the [[First World War]] he served in the [[Royal Munster Fusiliers]] and was wounded at [[Gallipoli]] in the [[Dardanelles]], was invalided out and resumed his studies in London.

In 1919 he married Moira Pennefather, daughter of Lieutenant Colonel Edward Graham Pennefather from [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]], with whom he had four children, Patrick (1920), Brigid (1923) and Lawrence and Finnbar (1927).&lt;ref name=Andrews/&gt;[[File:Robert Gibbings01.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Poster issued by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London Ltd (1922)|left]]

==Gibbings and the Society of Wood Engravers==
Gibbings's early contact with Noel Rooke at the Central School set the course of the rest of his artistic career when he asked Rooke: "Is it very foolish of me to try to be an artist?" and received the reply: "What else could you do?".&lt;ref name=Balston&gt;Thomas Balston, ''The Wood-engravings of Robert Gibbings'' (London, Art and Technics, 1949).&lt;/ref&gt; Life as an artist meant life as a wood engraver, and a life where Gibbings often struggled financially whilst, at the same time, receiving critical acclaim.

This was the case at this stage of his life. The critical acclaim came with an article in the [[Studio Magazine|''Studio'']] in February 1919, which reproduced a number of engravings, including two colour wood engravings. Commissioned work was more of a problem. Joseph Thorp obtained commercial commissions for Eno's Fruit Salts, Matinée cigarettes and Findlater's Port.&lt;ref name=Empson&gt;Patience Empson, ''The Wood Engravings of Robert Gibbings'' (London, J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, 1959).&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[London Underground]] he produced a poster for [[RHS Garden, Wisley|Wisley]] and a publicity booklet for [[London Zoo]] (1922), now considered to be the first of his published works, and the rarest.&lt;ref name=Andrews/&gt;

In 1922 Gibbings produced a wood engraving for the dust jacket of ''The Oppidan'' by [[Shane Leslie]] and in 1923 he illustrated ''[[Erewhon]]'' by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]].

He was very much at the centre of developments in wood engraving. He was a founder member and leading light of the [[Society of Wood Engravers]], which he set up with Noel Rooke in 1920. In 1922 he contributed two wood engravings to ''Contemporary English Woodcuts'', an anthology of wood engravings produced by Thomas Balston, a director at [[Gerald Duckworth and Company|Duckworth]] and an enthusiast for the new style of wood engravings. [[Campbell Dodgson]], Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the [[British Museum]], wrote about him in his introduction to the book: "The 'Cubist' or 'Post-Impressionist' element is represented by Mr. Gibbings".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell Dodgson, ''Contemporary English Woodcuts'' (London, Duckworth, 1922).&lt;/ref&gt; The two engravings by Gibbings were 'Clear Waters', a strikingly modern nude, and 'Hamrun', both examples of his 'vanishing line' technique.&lt;ref name=Empson/&gt;

In 1923 Gibbings received a commission for a set of wood engravings for ''The Lives of Gallant Ladies'' for the [[Golden Cockerel Press]], his most important commission to date at 100 guineas.

==Gibbings and the Golden Cockerel Press==

Gibbings was working on the wood engravings ''The Lives of Gallant Ladies'' when Hal Taylor, the owner of the press, became very ill with [[tuberculosis]] and had to put it up for sale. He sought a loan from a friend, Hubert Pike, a director of [[Bentley|Bentley Motors]], to buy the press.&lt;ref name=Andrews/&gt; He took over in February 1924, paying £850 for the huts housing the business, the plant and goodwill. For the partially completed ''Gallant Ladies'' a further sum of £200 was paid. He also leased the house and land for £40 per annum. ''Gallant Ladies'' sold well with receipts of over £1,800, and saw the start of a golden period for the press and Gibbings and his family.&lt;ref name=Cave/&gt;

The printing staff – Frank Young, Albert Cooper and Harry Gibbs – were skilled and capable of very fine work.&lt;ref name=Kirkus/&gt; Moira Gibbings helped her husband in the business, and Gibbings kept close links with [[A.E. Coppard]], who had helped Taylor with the business side of the press and who was to become a close friend. Gibbings knew all the leading wood engravers of the day and a number of authors, which enabled him to publish modern texts as well as classic ones.

The first book for which Gibbings was entirely responsible was ''Moral Maxims'' by [[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|Rochefoucault]] (1924). [[Eric Gill]] was brought into the fold when he quarrelled with [[Hilary Pepler]] over the publication of Enid Clay's ''Sonnets and Verses'' (1925) and transferred the book to Gibbings. In 1925 he went on to commission engravings from [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]], [[Noel Rooke]], [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]], [[John Farleigh]] and [[Mabel Annesley]] among others.&lt;ref name=Andrews/&gt;

Gibbings published some 71 titles at the press and printed a number of books for others. The size of a run was normally between 250 and 750, and the books were mostly bound in leather by bookbinders [[Sangorski &amp; Sutcliffe]]. The major titles were the four volume ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' (1929 to 1931) and the ''Four Gospels'' (1931), both illustrated by Gill. Gibbings printed 15 copies of the ''Canterbury Tales'' on vellum, and 12 copies of the ''Four Gospels''. Printing the ''Canterbury Tales'' dominated work at the press for two and a half years, and relatively few other books were printed during that period. However, the book was a considerable critical and financial success and grossed £14,000.&lt;ref name=Cave&gt;Roderick Cave and Sarah Manson, ''A History of the Golden Cockerel Press: 1920–1960'' (London and New Castle DE, [[British Library]] and Oak Knoll Press, 2002), {{ISBN|1-58456-093-2}} OCLC 50478453.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Four Gospels'' was equally successful, and sold out shortly after publication in November 1931.&lt;ref name=Andrews/&gt;

Gibbings produced a number of books with his own wood engravings at the press, the highpoints being ''The True History of Lucian'' (1927) and ''[[Lamia (poem)|Lamia]]'' by [[John Keats]] (1928).

Sales were strong during most of this period. Gibbings had established links with a number of booksellers, notably Bumpus in London, and negotiated a very favourable deal with [[Random House]] in the USA. He bought out Pike with finance from another Irish friend, Mary Wiggin, and later bought her out, borrowing the money from [[Barclays Bank]].

The Gibbings family had moved to [[Waltham St Lawrence|Waltham Saint Lawrence]] when they bought the press. Gibbings and Moira indulged in a rather unconventional and hedonistic lifestyle (neither had any inhibitions about nudity), and saw a good deal of Gill, with whom they had a very easy-going relationship. Gibbings never settled into family life, and this became an issue for Moira as time passed.

Although much of his time was taken up by running the press, Gibbings did work for other publishers. He illustrated ''The Charm of Birds'' by [[Earl Grey of Falloden|Viscount Grey of Falloden]] (1927) for [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]], and ''A Mirror for Witches'' by [[Esther Forbes]] (1928) for [[Houghton Mifflin]]. When he sent the blocks to Houghton he added in his letter: "Next time you give me a job, for God's sake send me to the South Seas – I'm sick of English fogs".&lt;ref name=Empson/&gt; They were so impressed by the success of this book that they commissioned Gibbings to illustrate with wood engravings a book set in Tahiti that would be written by [[James Norman Hall]], the author of ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty]]''. Gibbings leapt at the chance and in 1929 he set out for Tahiti. He completed the wood engravings, but Hall did not complete the text. However, two books did emerge from this visit, ''The Seventh Man'' (1930), written, illustrated and published at the Golden Cockerel Press by Gibbings, and ''Iorana'' (1932), a semi-fictitious account by Gibbings of his time in Tahiti. Houghton published a [[bowdlerised]] version, and [[Gerald Duckworth and Company|Duckworth]] the full version.

In February 1932 Gibbings wrote to the owners of the [[Orient Line]] suggesting that he produce wood engravings for their publicity in return for a free cruise. They agreed, and he produced ''XIV Engravings on Wood'' for them, one of which was also used as a poster.&lt;ref name=Empson/&gt;

Moira was less than delighted that Gibbings had twice left her in charge of the business and their family on her own and with very little consultation. Lawrence had [[tuberculosis]] and she decided to leave for South Africa to join her mother, taking the three youngest children. She returned in 1936 to finalise her divorce from Gibbings.

In the early 1930s the business climate had changed, and, as American sales had faltered, Gibbings had struggled on as the depression became more severe. The press was now moribund and Gibbings eventually sold up in 1933. The last book that he produced was ''Lord Adrian'' by [[Lord Dunsany]] (1933), illustrated with his own wood engravings.

==Gibbings and Reading University==

Gibbings had lost his livelihood and his family, though not his home. He did not sell the grounds and buildings of the press, as the new owners moved the press to London. To save money he moved out of the cottage into one of the huts in the grounds, and his son Patrick, who was at [[St. Piran's (school)|Saint Piran's Independent School]] in [[Maidenhead]], stayed in another one when he was at home at the weekend. He did not seem deeply distressed about the loss of his family, although he did build up a close relationship with Patrick. The money from the sale of the press was enough to clear his debts, and a cloud seemed to lift. He wrote: "But what peace of mind when, standing in the wooden hut to which I had moved, I could look about me and see not one thing that was worth five shillings to anyone else!"&lt;ref name=Empson/&gt;

In 1934 he completed the two books that he considered to be his best, ''Beasts and Saints'' by [[Helen Waddell]] and ''Glory of Life'' by [[Llewelyn Powys]].&lt;ref name=Empson/&gt; ''Glory of Life'' was produced by Gibbings, but published by the new owners of the Golden Cockerel Press.

This was the beginning of a sustained period as an author illustrator. In 1935 he produced ''A True Tale of Love in Tonga'', another picture book along the lines of ''The Seventh Man'', followed in 1936 by ''Coconut Island'', a book for children. Both of these were based on his experiences in the [[South Sea Islands|South Seas]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/jso_0300-953x_1961_num_17_17_1883 Robert Gibbings and the South Seas] by P. Empson in the ''[[Journal de la Société des Océanistes]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and were followed by ''John Graham, Convict'' (1937), a version of a true account set in Australia.

His reputation was growing and he was commissioned by [[Penguin Books]] to write a travel book. He went to [[Bermuda]] and the [[Red Sea]], and wrote and illustrated ''Blue Angels and Whales'' (1938).&lt;ref name="bris.ac.uk"&gt;[http://www.bris.ac.uk/penguinarchiveproject/book-of-the-month Review (dated October 2009) of ''Blue Angels and Whales'', Penguin Archive Project, Bristol University]&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first original writing commissioned by Penguin. The book led to Gibbings's appointment as art director of a new series of Penguin Illustrated Classics.  The first ten titles, launched in May 1938, were illustrated by Gibbings (he illustrated [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Typee]]'') and other wood engravers.&lt;ref name=Selborne&gt;Joanna Selborne, ''British Wood-engraved Book Illustration 1904–1940'' (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1998), {{ISBN|0-19-817408-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The series was not a success and was discontinued after the issue of the first ten titles.  Penguin did, however, publish ''Coconut Island'' in 1945 as a [[Puffin Books|Puffin Story Book]], as well as his wood engravings to books by [[Eleanor Doorly]] – ''The Insect Man'' (1942), ''The Microbe Man'' (1943) and ''The Radium Woman'' (1953).

As well as writing his own books, he continued to produce wood engravings for other commissions, such as George Scott-Moncrieff's ''A Book of Uncommon Prayer'' (1937) for [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]], where each short poem such as "The Cormorant" faced one of his images. The cormorant prays "Give me the green wave force, / Show me where / The sweetest fishes swim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Scott-Moncrieff |first1=George |last2=Gibbings |first2=Robert |title=A Book of Uncommon Prayer |date=1937 |publisher=Methuen |pages=14–15 |chapter=The Cormorant}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to illustrate books for the Golden Cockerel Press and other publishers, designed a greetings telegram for the [[General Post Office|GPO]], became involved with the Sun Bathing review and produced adverts for [[Shell Oil]].

There were two major changes in his life. He had numbers of visitors from [[Reading University]], one of whom was Elisabeth Empson. Early in 1934 she discovered that she was pregnant.&lt;ref name=Andrews/&gt; This came as something of a shock to her parents. There was a twenty-year age difference between her and Gibbings, and he was unable to marry her as he was still married to Moira. The couple moved down to [[Cornwall]], where their daughter Vahine was born in November 1934 – they had two more children, another daughter Tiare (1937) and Shaun (1946). Elisabeth's parents came to accept the relationship, and gave the couple the money to build a cottage in the grounds at Waltham Saint Lawrence in 1935. Elisabeth and Gibbings were married in 1937 after Moira finally agreed to a divorce. The relationship was always strained, for much the same reasons that Gibbings's relationship with Moira was strained. He went off, for example, on two trips to Bermuda and the Red Sea, leaving Elisabeth with two young children to look after.

A more positive change in his life was his appointment in 1936 as sessional lecturer in typography, book production and illustration at Reading University for one day a week. He was a very good teacher, and encouraged his students by producing a number of books illustrated with their wood engravings, including ''Fatherless Oberlus'' (1936), ''Loftur'' (1939) and ''The Diary of W. Lashly'' (1939), the diary of [[William Lashly]], a survivor of [[Captain Scott]]'s expedition to the [[South Pole]].&lt;ref name=Kirkus/&gt;

==Gibbings and the river books==
[[Image:Robert Gibbings00.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Wood engraving from ''Sweet Thames Run Softly'']]

In 1940 Elisabeth and the two children were evacuated to Canada. They returned in summer 1945, a few weeks before Gibbings set off to the South Seas for well over a year.

While Elisabeth was away Gibbings moved into Saint Patrick's Hall, an all-male hall of residence at the university, and settled into a bachelor life that he found very congenial. The teaching and the extra-curricular life were very much to his liking, and there was one factor that led him inexorably into this next phase of his artistic life.

Gibbings had begun to take part in natural history trips to the [[Thames]] organised by the university. He later wrote: "In the early days of 1939 there arose in me a great desire to find peace beside a river".&lt;ref name=Empson/&gt; Along with Patrick and two other helpers he built himself a boat, the ''Willow'', and floated down the Thames. The result was ''Sweet Thames Run Softly'' (1940). He took the title from [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[Prothalamion]]'': "Sweete Themmes! runne softly, till I end my Song". His observations and wood engravings of the countryside, the river and its natural history, were the fruits of gentle months spent on the Thames, accompanied by sketch pad and microscope. Written at a time of great insecurity, the book captivated readers, acutely aware that the world it portrayed was in imminent danger of being wiped out. Thomas Balston wrote of Gibbings: "Few readers in these harassing days escape the longing for a simpler life, and Gibbings is very much a modern [[Thyrsis (poem)|Thyrsis]]."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Balston, 'The River Books of Robert Gibbings' in ''Alphabet and Image 8'' (December 1948).&lt;/ref&gt; He had captured a moment shared by many other people at the time, and over 140,000 copies of the book were printed.&lt;ref name=Kirkus/&gt;

''Coming down the Wye'' (1942) and ''Lovely is the Lee'' (1944) followed, based on the familiar pattern of personal encounter and anecdote, and historical and cultural research, all illustrated by his wood engravings. In August 1945 he set out for Polynesia again. He visited many of the islands and spent six months in [[New Zealand]] (including [[Dunedin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black + White + Grey The Lives + Works of Eric Gill + Robert Gibbings|url=http://www.otago.ac.nz/library/news/otago087801.html|website=University of Otago Library|publisher=University of Otago|accessdate=19 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619112142/http://www.otago.ac.nz/library/news/otago087801.html|archivedate=19 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kiwis in Captivity|url=http://otago.ourheritage.ac.nz/items/show/9383|website=OUR Heritage|publisher=University of Otago|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;), returning in late 1947. He recounted his travels and experiences in ''Over the Reefs'' (1948). He returned to Ireland for ''Sweet Cork of Thee'' (1951), and then crossed the [[English Channel]] to write ''Coming down the Seine'' (1953). ''Trumpets from Montparnasse'' (1955) was based on his travels in France and Italy. His final book, based on the area around [[Long Wittenham]], was ''Till I end my Song'' (1957). The somewhat prophetic title is the second half of the couplet from Spenser's ''Prothalamion'' that begins: "Sweet Thames run softly&amp;nbsp;...".

Writing his own books and producing the wood engravings for them kept him busy, but he did illustrate other books too, the most notable being an edition of ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'' by [[Charles Darwin]] (1956).

The bearded figure of Gibbings became as familiar on British television as was his voice to radio listeners. [[David Attenborough]] remembers Gibbings as being one of the inspiring influences at the start of his career.
[[File:Gibbings's headstone.JPG|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Gibbings's headstone in the churchyard at Long Wittenham]]

Gibbings's private life retained the turbulent nature that it had always had. Elisabeth came back to Waltham Saint Lawrence with the two girls in summer 1945, keen to have another child. Gibbings left for the South Seas after a very few weeks, leaving Elisabeth, who was by now pregnant, with their children. Their third child, Shaun, was born in April 1946. Gibbings's life at the time was complicated by his relationship with Patience Empson, Elisabeth's sister. The relationship had started when Patience typed up the manuscript for ''Coming Down the Wye'' and had since developed to the extent that she flew out to join him in [[Fiji]] in May 1946. She went mostly to help him with his writing, and partly at Elisabeth's suggestion. When Gibbings returned to England late in 1947 she stayed in New Zealand and then went to South Africa as Mrs. Empson felt that it would be improper for her to return with Gibbings. By April 1951 Elisabeth and Gibbings were divorced, and his relationship with Patience became more relaxed.&lt;ref name=Andrews/&gt;

In September 1955 Patience and Gibbings bought Footbridge Cottage, a tiny beehive of a cottage in Gibbings's words, in Long Wittenham on the banks of the Thames. Life there suited Gibbings, and he had a period of tranquility that he had not known previously. They lived there until Gibbings died of cancer in hospital at Oxford on 19 January 1958.&lt;ref name=Andrews/&gt; He is buried in the churchyard at Long Wittenham. The grave is marked by a simple headstone featuring his device of a crossed quill and graver, carved by Michael Black, a young sculptor who was a friend of Gibbings.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Bailey, ''Churchyards of England and Wales'' (London, Robert Hale, 1987), {{ISBN|0-7090-2948-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==An overview of his life and work==

Gibbings dominates the period of the modern wood engraving revival in Britain, both by the longevity of his artistic career, and its significance. His is the most cited name in Joanna
Selborne's monumental survey.&lt;ref name=Selborne/&gt; He was at the centre of all the developments in wood engraving, from the cubist engravings of his vanishing line period to the traditional landscape based engravings of the river books. He ran the Golden Cockerel Press at the period when it shaped the concept of the wood engraved book.

He was gripped by the possibilities of wood engravings, by the possibilities of expression within the very formal constraints of the medium: "But slowly a love of the wood came upon me. I began to enjoy the crisp purr of the graver as it furrowed the polished surface. I began to appreciate the cleanness of the white line that it incised: even the simplest silhouettes had an austere quality, a dignity, that could not be achieved by other means. Clear, precise statement, that was what it amounted to. Near enough wouldn't do: it had to be just right".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gibbings, 'Thoughts on Wood' in ''The Saturday Book 17'' (1957).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further reading==

The definitive biography of Gibbings is by Martin Andrews,&lt;ref name=Andrews/&gt; and the definitive bibliography is by Mary Kirkus.&lt;ref name=Kirkus&gt;Mary Kirkus, ''Robert Gibbings: a Bibliography'' (London, J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, 1962).&lt;/ref&gt; There is an article on his bookplate production in the ''Bookplate Journal'',&lt;ref&gt;John Blatchley, 'The Ex-libris of Robert Gibbings' in ''Bookplate Journal'' (September 1995), published by the Bookplate Society.&lt;/ref&gt; and one on his working library in the ''Private Library''.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Maslen, 'Robert Gibbings, a man and his books' in ''Private Library'' (Spring 2008), published by the [[Private Libraries Association]].&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of relevant articles in ''Matrix 9''.&lt;ref name=Matrix&gt;Various, ''Matrix 9'' (Andoversford, The Whittington Press, 1989), ISSN 0261-3093.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two collections of his wood engravings, the first by Thomas Balston,&lt;ref name=Balston/&gt; the second, more definitive collection by Patience Empson.&lt;ref name=Empson/&gt;

The main collection of his work in Great Britain is held by [[Reading University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reading.ac.uk/special-collections/collections/sc-gibbings.aspx Reading University's collection of the work of Gibbings – there is a link on this page to the catalogue of the 1989 centenary exhibition]&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant number of Gibbings’ original wood engravings are also held at [[St Bride Library]]

'''Salem Harbor Power Station''' is a natural gas-fired power plant located in [[Salem, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Salem Harbor Footprint|url=http://www.footprintsalemharbor.com/|website=Footprint Power|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It replaced an outdated coal-fired plant on the same site and went online in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Salem power plant online |url=http://www.salemnews.com/news/local_news/salem-power-plant-online/article_e610c4dc-884b-5f8d-ab91-3cb497839e8c.html|website=Salem News|accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The facility sits on [[land reclamation|land reclaimed]] during the 1800s, and was previously the site of a wharf and [[coal]] depository. Construction on the original plant began in the 1950s, and was expanded numerous times.
[[File:Salem Harbor Station.jpg|thumb|left|Original coal-fired plant in 2012]]
It is smaller than the original plant, allowing 40-acres of waterfront land to be used for future development. The 60-year-old coal plant, which was purchased by Footprint Power in 2012, was brought offline on May 31, 2014. Demolition work was completed in 2016, while the new plant was being built around it.&lt;ref name=Helms&gt;{{cite news|last=Helms|first=Chris|title=Salem Harbor Power Station CEO Touts Design of New Facility|url=http://marblehead.patch.com/articles/salem-harbor-power-station-ceo-touts-design-of-new-facility-b6d04fb7|accessdate=5 May 2013|newspaper=Marblehead Patch|date=7 February 2013|location=[[Salem, Massachusetts]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130630030345/http://marblehead.patch.com/articles/salem-harbor-power-station-ceo-touts-design-of-new-facility-b6d04fb7|archivedate=30 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Serengeti''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|ɛr|ə|n|ˈ|g|ɛ|t|i}}) ecosystem is a [[Geography of Africa|geographical region in Africa]]. It is located in northern [[Tanzania]]. It spans approximately {{convert|30000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. 

The Serengeti hosts the second largest terrestrial mammal [[Animal migration|migration]] in the world, which helps secure it as one of the [[Seven Natural Wonders of Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sevennaturalwonders.org/africa|title=Seven Natural Wonders of Africa|work=Seven Natural Wonders}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as one of the [[Wonders of the World#Natural travel wonders|ten natural travel wonders of the world]].&lt;ref name="partridge"&gt;{{cite news|first=Frank |last=Partridge |title=The fast show |date=20 May 2006 |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20060520/ai_n16416123 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219104115/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20060520/ai_n16416123 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 December 2007 |work=The Independent (London) |accessdate=2007-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Serengeti is also renowned for its large lion population and is one of the best places to observe prides in their natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Nolting | first=Mark | title=Africa's Top Wildlife Countries | year=2012 | publisher=Global Travel Publishers Inc. | isbn=978-0939895151 | pages=356}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region contains the [[Serengeti National Park]] in Tanzania and several [[game reserve]]s.

Approximately 70 large [[mammal]] and 500 [[bird]] species are found there. This high diversity is a function of diverse habitats, including riverine forests, [[swamp]]s, [[kopjes]], [[grasslands]], and [[woodland]]s.&lt;ref name="www.ath.aegean.gr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ath.aegean.gr/srcosmos/showpub.aspx?aa=8868 |accessdate=9 February 2014 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blue wildebeest]]s, [[gazelle]]s, [[zebra]]s, and [[African buffalo|buffalo]]s are some of the commonly found large mammals in the region.

There has been controversy about a [[Serengeti National Park#Proposed road across the northern Serengeti|proposed road to be built through the Serengeti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savetheserengeti.org/issues/highway/stop-the-serengeti-highway/|title=Highway Development Threatens Serengeti|work=Serengeti Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serengeti is derived from the [[Maasai language]], [[Maasai language|Maa]]; specifically, "Serengit" meaning "Endless Plains".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Northern Tanzania: The Bradt Safari Guide with Kilimanjaro and Zanzibar | first=Phillip | last=Briggs | year=2006 | page=198 | publisher=Bradt Travel Guides | isbn=978-1-84162-146-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=December 2017}}

==History==

Much of the Serengeti was known to outsiders as Maasailand. The [[Maasai people|Maasai]] are known as fierce warriors and live alongside most wild animals with an aversion to eating game and birds, subsisting exclusively on their cattle. Historically, their strength and reputation kept the newly arrived Europeans from exploiting the animals and resources of most of their land. A [[1890s African rinderpest epizootic|rinderpest epidemic]] and drought during the 1890s greatly reduced the numbers of both Maasai and animal populations. The Tanzanian government later in the 20th century re-settled the Maasai around the [[Ngorongoro Crater]]. Poaching and the absence of fires, which had been the result of human activity, set the stage for the development of dense woodlands and thickets over the next 30–50 years. [[Tsetse fly]] populations now prevented any significant human settlement in the area.

By the mid-1970s, wildebeest and the Cape buffalo populations had recovered and were increasingly cropping the grass, reducing the amount of fuel available for fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Morell | first=Virginia | year=1997 | title=Return of the Forest | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=278 | issue=5346 | page=2059 | doi=10.1126/science.278.5346.2059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduced intensity of fires has allowed acacia to once again become established.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite book | title=Serengeti II: Dynamics, Management, and Conservation of an Ecosystem | editor-last = Sinclair | editor-first = Anthony Ronald Entrican | editor2-first = Peter | editor2-last = Arcese | year=1995 | publisher=University of Chicago Press | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qSb-dHu7rGQC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=acacia+trees+serengeti+fire| pages=73–76 | isbn= 978-0-226-76032-2 | accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, mass [[rabies]] vaccination programmes for domestic dogs in the Serengeti have not only indirectly prevented hundreds of human deaths, but also protected wildlife species such as the endangered [[Lycaon pictus|African wild dog]].&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bva.co.uk/public/documents/congress08_blackburn_citation.pdf |title=Trevor Blackburn Award 2008 |publisher=British Veterinary Association |date=September 2008 |accessdate=2014-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103124131/http://www.bva.co.uk/public/documents/congress08_blackburn_citation.pdf |archivedate=3 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great migration==
[[File:Wildebeest-during-Great-Migration.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Migrating wildebeests]]
[[File:Wildebeest crossing river - Stefan Swanepoel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Wildebeests crossing the river during the Serengeti migration]]

Each year around the same time, the circular great wildebeest migration begins in the [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]] of the southern Serengeti in Tanzania and loops in a clockwise direction through the Serengeti National Park and north towards the Masai Mara reserve in Kenya.&lt;ref name="The Great Wildebeest Migration"&gt;{{cite journal |title = The Great Wildebeest Migration: Exploring Africa’s biggest wildlife phenomenon | year = 2017 | url = http://www.horizontravelpress.com/store/great-wildebeest-migration-021}}&lt;/ref&gt; This migration is a natural phenomenon determined by the availability of grazing. The initial phase lasts from approximately January to March, when the calving season begins – a time when there is plenty of rain-ripened grass available for the 260,000 zebra that precede 1.7 million wildebeest and the following hundreds of thousands of other plains game, including around 470,000 [[gazelle]]s.&lt;ref name=aboutAfrica/&gt;&lt;ref name=ngorongoro&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ngorongorotanzania.com/get-there.html | title=How to Get There, Ngorongoro Crater | publisher=Ngorongoro Crater Tanzania | year=2013 | accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web | url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/39 | title=Ngorongoro Conservation Area | publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization – World Heritage Centre | accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During February, the wildebeest spend their time on the short grass plains of the southeastern part of the ecosystem, grazing and giving birth to approximately 500,000 calves within a 2 to 3-week period. Few calves are born ahead of time and of these, hardly any survive. The main reason is that very young calves are more noticeable to predators when mixed with older calves from the previous year. As the rains end in May, the animals start moving northwest into the areas around the [[Grumeti Game Reserve|Grumeti River]], where they typically remain until late June. The crossings of the Grumeti and [[Mara River|Mara]] rivers beginning in July are a popular safari attraction because crocodiles are lying in wait.&lt;ref name=aboutAfrica&gt;{{cite web | url = http://goafrica.about.com/od/africasafariguide/a/annualmigration.htm | title=The Great Annual Wildlife Migration – The Great Migration of Wildebeest and Zebra | publisher= About.com | author=Anouk Zijlma | accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The herds arrive in Kenya in late July / August, where they stay for the remainder of the dry season, except that the [[Thomson's gazelle|Thomson's]] and [[Grant's gazelle]]s move only east/west. In early November, with the start of the short rains the migration starts moving south again, to the short grass plains of the southeast, usually arriving in December in plenty of time for calving in February.&lt;ref name=Croze&gt;{{cite book | title=Serengeti's Great Migration |author1=Croze, Harvey |author2=Mari, Carlo |author3=Estes, Richard D. | publisher=Abbeville Press | year=2000 | isbn=978-0-789-20669-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 250,000 wildebeest die during the journey from Tanzania to the [[Maasai Mara National Reserve]] in southwestern Kenya, a total of {{convert|800|km|mi}}. Death is usually from thirst, hunger, exhaustion, or [[big cats|predation]].&lt;ref name="partridge"/&gt;

==Ecology==

[[File:Serengeti - Stefan Swanepoel.jpg|thumb|River and the Serengeti plains]]

The Serengeti has some of East Africa's finest game areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Africa's Great Rift Valley | first=Nigel | last=Pavitt | year=2001 | page=122 | publisher=Harry N. Abrams | isbn=978-0-8109-0602-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides being known for the great migration, the Serengeti is also famous for its abundant large predators. The ecosystem is home to over 3,000 lions (''[[Panthera leo]]''), 1,000 leopards (''[[Panthera pardus]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2012/11/cheetahs/smith-text|title=Cheetahs on the Edge - Pictures, More From National Geographic Magazine|website=ngm.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 7,700 to 8,700 spotted hyenas (''[[Spotted hyena|Crocuta crocuta]]).''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mpalalive.org/field_guide/spotted_hyena|title=Mpala Live! Field Guide: Spotted Hyena {{!}} MpalaLive|website=mpalalive.org|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;.The [[East African cheetah]] are also present in Serengeti.

Wild dogs are relatively scarce in much of the Serengeti. This is particularly true in places such as Serengeti National Park (where they became extinct in 1992), in which lions and spotted hyenas, predators that steal wild dog kills and are a direct cause of wild dog mortality, are abundant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/science/one-for-all-and-all-for-hunt-.html|title=African Wild Dogs, True Best Friends|last=Angier|first=Natalie|date=2014-08-11|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Serengeti is also home to a diversity of grazers, including [[African buffalo]], [[warthog]]s, [[Grant's gazelle]], [[Taurotragus|eland]], [[waterbuck]], and [[topi]]. The Serengeti can support this remarkable variety of grazers only because each species, even those that are closely related, has a different diet. For example, [[wildebeest]]s prefer to consume shorter [[grass]]es, while [[zebra]]s prefer taller ones. Similarly, [[dik-dik]]s eat the lowest leaves of a tree, [[impala]]s eat the leaves that are higher up, and [[giraffe]]s eat leaves that are even higher.

The governments of [[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]] maintain a number of protected areas, including national parks, conservation areas, and game reserves, that give legal protection to over 80 percent of the Serengeti.&lt;ref name="www.ath.aegean.gr" /&gt;

The southeastern area lies in the rain shadow of the [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]]'s highlands and is composed of shortgrass treeless plains with abundant small [[dicots]]. Soils are high in nutrients, overlying a shallow calcareous hardpan due to [[natrocarbonatite]] [[eruption]]s from [[Ol Doinyo Lengai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.volcanocafe.org/the-strangest-volcanoes-in-the-world-a-non-official-list/ |title=The Strangest Volcanoes In The World – A Non-Official List|date=28 March 2017|publisher= |accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A gradient of soil depth northwestward across the plains results in changes in the herbaceous community and taller grass. About {{convert|70|km|mi}} west, [[acacia]] woodlands appear suddenly and stretch west to [[Lake Victoria]] and north to the Loita Plains, north of the [[Maasai Mara National Reserve]]. The sixteen acacia species vary over this range, their distribution determined by [[edaphic]] conditions. Near Lake Victoria, floodplains have developed from ancient lakebeds.

In the far northwest, acacia woodlands are replaced by broadleaved Terminalia-Combretum woodlands, caused by a change in geology. This area has the highest rainfall in the system and forms a refuge for the migrating ungulates at the end of the dry season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Serengeti III: Human Impacts on Ecosystem Dynamics | first=A.

Altitudes in the Serengeti range from {{convert|920|to|1850|m|ft}} with mean temperatures varying from {{convert|15|to|25|C|F}}. Although the climate is usually warm and dry, rainfall occurs in two rainy seasons: March to May, and a shorter season in October and November. Rainfall amounts vary from a low of {{convert|508|mm|in|0}} in the lee of the Ngorongoro highlands to a high of {{convert|1200|mm|in|0}} on the shores of Lake Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.glcom.com/hassan/serengeti.html | title=The Serengeti National Park | publisher=Glcom.com | accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highlands, which are considerably cooler than the plains and are covered by montane forest, mark the eastern border of the basin in which the Serengeti lies.

The Serengeti plain is punctuated by [[granite]] and [[gneiss]] outcroppings known as kopjes. These outcroppings are the result of volcanic activity. Kopjes provide a microhabitat for non-plains wildlife. One kopje likely to be seen by visitors to the Serengeti is the Simba Kopje (Lion Kopje).

The area is also home to the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, which contains [[Ngorongoro Crater]] and the [[Olduvai Gorge]], where some of the oldest [[Hominini|hominin]] [[fossils]] have been found.

'''Sociofact''' is a term coined by [[Julian Huxley]], used together with the related terms "[[mentifact]]" (sometimes called a psychofact&lt;ref name=boiles /&gt;) and "[[Cultural artifact|artifact]]" to describe how cultural traits take on a life of their own, spanning over generations.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, J. S. 1955. Guest Editorial: Evolution, Cultural and Biological. ''Yearbook of Anthropology'', 2–25.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea has been related to [[memetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bribiesca, Luis B. | title = Memetics: a dangerous idea. | journal = Interciencia | volume = 26 | number = 1 | year = 2001 | pages = 29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the sociofact was developed extensively by David Bidney in his textbook ''Theoretical Anthropology''.  Bidney used the term to refer to objects which consist of interactions between members of a social group.&lt;ref name=bidney&gt;{{cite book | author = Bidney, David | title = Theoretical Anthropology | publisher = Schocken | year = 1967 | place = New York | edition = 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept has been used by philosophers and social scientists in their analyses of varying kinds of social groups.  For instance, [[semiotician]] of music Charles Boilès, in a discussion of the [[semiotics]] of the tune "[[Taps]]", claims that although it is a single piece of music, it can be seen as three distinct musical sociofacts: as a "last call" signal in taverns frequented by soldiers, as an "end of day" signal on military bases, and hence symbolically as a component of military funerals.&lt;ref name=boiles&gt;{{cite journal | author = Boilès, Charles L. | title = Processes of Musical Semiosis | journal = Yearbook for Traditional Music | volume = 14 | year = 1982 | pages = 24–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim has been made that sociofactual analysis can play a decisive role for the performance of, and collaboration within, organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS11/paper/view/2444 | title = Added Value of Sociofact Analysis for Business Agility |author1=Uwe V.

'''Stress fibers''' are contractile [[actin]] bundles found in non-muscle cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kreis|first1=Thomas E.|last2=Birchmeier|first2=Walter|title=Stress fiber sarcomeres of fibroblasts are contractile|journal=Cell|date=November 1980|volume=22|issue=2|pages=555–561|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(80)90365-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are composed of actin (microfilaments) and [[Myosin|non-muscle myosin II]] (NMMII), and also contain various crosslinking proteins, such as α-actinin, to form a highly regulated actomyosin structure within non-muscle cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tojkander|first1=S.|last2=Gateva|first2=G.|last3=Lappalainen|first3=P.|title=Actin stress fibers - assembly, dynamics and biological roles|journal=Journal of Cell Science|date=29 April 2012|volume=125|issue=8|pages=1855–1864|doi=10.1242/jcs.098087|pmid=22544950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stress fibers have been shown to play an important role in cellular contractility, providing force for a number of functions such as [[cell adhesion]], [[Cell migration|migration]] and [[Morphogenesis#Cellular basis|morphogenesis]].

==Structure==

Stress fibers are primarily composed of actin and myosin. Actin is a ~43kDa globular protein, and can polymerize to form long filamentous structures.These filaments are made of two strands of actin monomers (or protofilaments) wrapping around each other, to create a single actin filament. Because actin monomers are not symmetrical molecules, their filaments have polarity based upon the structure of the actin monomer, which will allow one end of the actin filament to polymerize faster than the other. The end that can polymerize faster is known as the plus-end, whereas the end that polymerizes slower is known as the minus-end. Stress fibers are usually composed of 10-30 actin filaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tojkander|first1=S.|last2=Gateva|first2=G.|last3=Lappalainen|first3=P.|title=Actin stress fibers - assembly, dynamics and biological roles|journal=Journal of Cell Science|date=29 April 2012|volume=125|issue=8|pages=1855–1864|doi=10.1242/jcs.098087|pmid=22544950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stress fibers are composed of antiparallel microfilaments: actin filaments are bundled along their length, and plus-ends and minus-ends co-mingle at each end of the bundle. The antiparallel arrangement of actin filaments within stress fibers is reinforced by [[Actinin|α-actinin]], an actin filament crosslinking protein which contains antiparallel actin-binding domains. These bundles are then cross-linked by NMMII to form stress fibers.

==Assembly and regulation==

[[File:Rho cascade.png|thumb|Rho Cascade - stress fiber formation]]
The [[Rho family of GTPases]] regulate many aspects of actin cytoskeletal dynamics, including stress fiber formation. RhoA (sometimes referred to as just 'Rho') is responsible for the formation of stress fibers, and its activity in stress fiber formation was first discovered by Ridley and Hall in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ridley|first1=Anne J.|last2=Hall|first2=Alan|title=The small GTP-binding protein rho regulates the assembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers in response to growth factors|journal=Cell|date=August 1992|volume=70|issue=3|pages=389–399|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(92)90163-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; When bound to GTP, Rho activates Rho-associated coiled-coil forming kinase (ROCK) and mammalian homologue of Drosophila diaphanous (mDia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Narumiya|first1=Shuh|last2=Tanji|first2=Masahiro|last3=Ishizaki|first3=Toshimasa|title=Rho signaling, ROCK and mDia1, in transformation, metastasis and invasion|journal=Cancer and Metastasis Reviews|date=22 January 2009|volume=28|issue=1–2|pages=65–76|doi=10.1007/s10555-008-9170-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; mDia is a [[Formins|formin]], which nucleates and polymerizes long actin filaments. ROCK is a [[kinase]] that acts to phosphorylate MLCP (myosin-light-chain phosphatase), as well as the NMMII light chain, which inactivates MLCP and activates myosin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kimura|first1=K.|last2=Ito|first2=M.|last3=Amano|first3=M.|last4=Chihara|first4=K.|last5=Fukata|first5=Y.|last6=Nakafuku|first6=M.|last7=Yamamori|first7=B.|last8=Feng|first8=J.|last9=Nakano|first9=T.|last10=Okawa|first10=K.|last11=Iwamatsu|first11=A.|last12=Kaibuchi|first12=K.|title=Regulation of Myosin Phosphatase by Rho and Rho-Associated Kinase (Rho-Kinase)|journal=Science|date=12 July 1996|volume=273|issue=5272|pages=245–248|doi=10.1126/science.273.5272.245|pmid=8662509}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will lead to the accumulation of activated myosin motor proteins, which bind the actin filaments that were polymerized by mDia, to create stress fibers. In addition, ROCK also phosphorylates and activates LIM-kinase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maekawa|first1=M.|title=Signaling from Rho to the Actin Cytoskeleton Through Protein Kinases ROCK and LIM-kinase|journal=Science|date=6 August 1999|volume=285|issue=5429|pages=895–898|doi=10.1126/science.285.5429.895|pmid=10436159}}&lt;/ref&gt; LIM-kinase will in turn phosphorylate and inactivate [[cofilin]], which will prevent the breakdown and recycling of actin filaments, maintaining the integrity of the stress fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maekawa|first1=M.|title=Signaling from Rho to the Actin Cytoskeleton Through Protein Kinases ROCK and LIM-kinase|journal=Science|date=6 August 1999|volume=285|issue=5429|pages=895–898|doi=10.1126/science.285.5429.895|pmid=10436159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles and associated proteins==
Stress fibers play the following roles in cellular functioning:

===1. Adhesion===
Stress fibers are necessary for the formation and maintenance of cell-cell and cell-[[Extracellular matrix|ECM]] adhesion, such as the formation of [[adherens junction]]s, [[tight junction]]s and [[focal adhesion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Braga|first1=V. M.M.|title=The Small GTPases Rho and Rac Are Required for the Establishment of Cadherin-dependent Cell-Cell Contacts|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=16 June 1997|volume=137|issue=6|pages=1421–1431|doi=10.1083/jcb.137.6.1421}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ridley|first1=Anne J.|last2=Hall|first2=Alan|title=The small GTP-binding protein rho regulates the assembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers in response to growth factors|journal=Cell|date=August 1992|volume=70|issue=3|pages=389–399|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(92)90163-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adherens junctions====
[[Adherens junction]]s are a type of cell-cell adhesion structure that is present in both motile and non-motile cells, which adhere cells together via the homophilic binding of [[cadherin]]s and [[nexin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meng|first1=W.|last2=Takeichi|first2=M.|title=Adherens Junction: Molecular Architecture and Regulation|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|date=5 August 2009|volume=1|issue=6|pages=a002899–a002899|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a002899|pmc=2882120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stress fibers play an important role in the maintenance of cadherin-dependent and nexin-dependent cell-cell contacts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vasioukhin|first1=Valeri|last2=Bauer|first2=Christoph|last3=Yin|first3=Mei|last4=Fuchs|first4=Elaine|title=Directed Actin Polymerization Is the Driving Force for Epithelial Cell–Cell Adhesion|journal=Cell|date=January 2000|volume=100|issue=2|pages=209–219|doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81559-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Rho-family GTPases have been found to regulate the structure and integrity of adherens junctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Braga|first1=V.

James|last5=Weis|first5=William I.|title=α-Catenin Is a Molecular Switch that Binds E-Cadherin-β-Catenin and Regulates Actin-Filament Assembly|journal=Cell|date=December 2005|volume=123|issue=5|pages=903–915|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2005.09.021|pmid=16325583|pmc=3369825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, α-catenin has been shown to associate with [[formins]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kobielak|first1=Agnieszka|last2=Pasolli|first2=H. Amalia|last3=Fuchs|first3=Elaine|title=Mammalian formin-1 participates in adherens junctions and polymerization of linear actin cables|journal=Nature Cell Biology|date=30 November 2003|volume=6|issue=1|pages=21–30|doi=10.1038/ncb1075|pmid=14647292|pmc=2605950}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPLIN, and [[vinculin]]. EPLIN has been found to enhance the bundling and stabilization of actin filaments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maul|first1=R. S.|title=EPLIN regulates actin dynamics by cross-linking and stabilizing filaments|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=3 February 2003|volume=160|issue=3|pages=399–407|doi=10.1083/jcb.200212057|pmid=12566430|pmc=2172667}}&lt;/ref&gt; and vinculin is involved in the linkage of adhesion molecules to the actin cytoskeleton. This may serve as a mechanism for how actin is recruited to adherens junctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maul|first1=R. S.|title=EPLIN regulates actin dynamics by cross-linking and stabilizing filaments|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=3 February 2003|volume=160|issue=3|pages=399–407|doi=10.1083/jcb.200212057|pmid=12566430|pmc=2172667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tight junctions====
[[Tight junction]]s, or zona occludens, are the most important cellular element for the formation of semi-permeable barriers within or between tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gumbiner|first1=Barry M|title=Cell Adhesion: The Molecular Basis of Tissue Architecture and Morphogenesis|journal=Cell|date=February 1996|volume=84|issue=3|pages=345–357|doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81279-9|pmid=8608588}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tight junctions primarily consist of claudins and occludins, which are membrane proteins that form the cell-cell contact, as well as ZO-1, ZO-2 and ZO-3, which link tight junctions to the actin cytoskeleton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hartsock|first1=Andrea|last2=Nelson|first2=W. James|title=Adherens and tight junctions: Structure, function and connections to the actin cytoskeleton|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Biomembranes|date=March 2008|volume=1778|issue=3|pages=660–669|doi=10.1016/j.bbamem.2007.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, tight junctions have not been found to be directly linked to stress fibers, like they are for focal adhesions and adherens junctions.

====Focal adhesions====
[[Focal adhesion]]s are macromolecular assemblies that are used to connect cells to the ECM. They consist of three functional layers: an ECM-associated integrin layer, a membrane associated force transduction layer, and an actin layer, which is made up of actin stress fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kanchanawong|first1=Pakorn|last2=Shtengel|first2=Gleb|last3=Pasapera|first3=Ana M.|last4=Ramko|first4=Ericka B.|last5=Davidson|first5=Michael W.|last6=Hess|first6=Harald F.|last7=Waterman|first7=Clare M.|title=Nanoscale architecture of integrin-based cell adhesions|journal=Nature|date=25 November 2010|volume=468|issue=7323|pages=580–584|doi=10.1038/nature09621|pmid=21107430|pmc=3046339}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the naming or their layers implies, focal adhesions play a large role in mechanotransduction and cell migration. Focal adhesions are usually connected to stress fibers—in fact, stress fiber contractility is necessary for focal adhesion maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tojkander|first1=S.|last2=Gateva|first2=G.|last3=Lappalainen|first3=P.|title=Actin stress fibers - assembly, dynamics and biological roles|journal=Journal of Cell Science|date=29 April 2012|volume=125|issue=8|pages=1855–1864|doi=10.1242/jcs.098087|pmid=22544950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2. Migration===
[[File:Stress Fibers - three types.png|thumb|Three types of stress fibers: ventral stress fibers, transverse arcs, and dorsal stress fibers]]
An essential feature of many cells is their ability to migrate towards certain mechanical ([[Durotaxis]]) or chemical ([[Chemotaxis]]) stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tojkander|first1=S.|last2=Gateva|first2=G.|last3=Lappalainen|first3=P.|title=Actin stress fibers - assembly, dynamics and biological roles|journal=Journal of Cell Science|date=29 April 2012|volume=125|issue=8|pages=1855–1864|doi=10.1242/jcs.098087|pmid=22544950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cell migration takes place through the concerted action of three Rho family GTPases: Rho, Rac, and Cdc42. When GTP-bound, Rac will cause the formation of [[Lamellipodium|lamellipodia]], and Cdc42 will cause the formation of [[filopodia]], thus promoting cell migration. In the migrating cell, there are three main types of stress fibers: ventral stress fibers, transverse arcs, and dorsal stress fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hotulainen|first1=P.|title=Stress fibers are generated by two distinct actin assembly mechanisms in motile cells|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=8 May 2006|volume=173|issue=3|pages=383–394|doi=10.1083/jcb.200511093|pmid=16651381|pmc=2063839}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ventral stress fibers are associated with focal adhesions at both ends, are located on the ventral surface of the cell, and function in adhesion and contraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hotulainen|first1=P.|title=Stress fibers are generated by two distinct actin assembly mechanisms in motile cells|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=8 May 2006|volume=173|issue=3|pages=383–394|doi=10.1083/jcb.200511093|pmid=16651381|pmc=2063839}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transverse arcs are not directly linked to focal adhesions, and typically flow from the leading edge of the cell, back towards the cell centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hotulainen|first1=P.|title=Stress fibers are generated by two distinct actin assembly mechanisms in motile cells|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=8 May 2006|volume=173|issue=3|pages=383–394|doi=10.1083/jcb.200511093|pmid=16651381|pmc=2063839}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dorsal stress fibers are located at the trailing edge of the cell. They attach to focal adhesions on the ventral surface of the trailing edge, and extend dorsally, towards the cell centre to attach to transverse arcs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hotulainen|first1=P.|title=Stress fibers are generated by two distinct actin assembly mechanisms in motile cells|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=8 May 2006|volume=173|issue=3|pages=383–394|doi=10.1083/jcb.200511093|pmid=16651381|pmc=2063839}}&lt;/ref&gt; During cell migration, actin filaments within stress fibers will be recycled by a process of [[Focal adhesion#Adhesion dynamics with migrating cells|retrograde actin flow]]. The mechanism of dissolution of the focal adhesion itself is poorly understood.

===3. Morphogenesis===

Morphogenesis, at the cellular level, can be defined as giving shape to, or defining the architecture of a cell. The assembly of the cytoskeleton, including the actin cytoskeleton, is the determining factor in specifying cellular morphogenesis and conferring shape to cells. The contractility of stress fibers within the cell will therefore help to determine cellular morphogenesis. For example, the circumferential contractile actin belts of adherens junctions contribute to cellular morphogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meng|first1=W.|last2=Takeichi|first2=M.|title=Adherens Junction: Molecular Architecture and Regulation|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|date=5 August 2009|volume=1|issue=6|pages=a002899–a002899|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a002899|pmc=2882120}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, the dorsal stress fibers, transverse arcs and ventral stress fibers aid in the determination of cell morphology during cell migration. A more detailed explanation of cellular morphogenesis can be found [[Morphogenesis#Cellular basis|here]].

===4. Mechanotransduction===
Both microfilaments and microtubules play major roles in mechanotransduction. In the actin cytoskeleton, mechanotransduction can occur at cell-ECM and cell-cell adhesions, through focal adhesions and adherens junctions, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Christopher S.|last2=Tan|first2=John|last3=Tien|first3=Joe|title=MECHANOTRANSDUCTION AT CELL-MATRIX AND CELL-CELL CONTACTS|journal=Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering|date=15 August 2004|volume=6|issue=1|pages=275–302|doi=10.1146/annurev.bioeng.6.040803.140040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transduction of forces from the outside to the inside of the cell can control the maturation or disassembly of adhesions, and initiate intracellular signalling cascades that can alter cellular behaviours,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Christopher S.|last2=Tan|first2=John|last3=Tien|first3=Joe|title=MECHANOTRANSDUCTION AT CELL-MATRIX AND CELL-CELL CONTACTS|journal=Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering|date=15 August 2004|volume=6|issue=1|pages=275–302|doi=10.1146/annurev.bioeng.6.040803.140040}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cells are known to assemble stress fibers when they encounter mechanical stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tojkander|first1=S.|last2=Gateva|first2=G.|last3=Lappalainen|first3=P.|title=Actin stress fibers - assembly, dynamics and biological roles|journal=Journal of Cell Science|date=29 April 2012|volume=125|issue=8|pages=1855–1864|doi=10.1242/jcs.098087|pmid=22544950}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, cells that are grown on rigid substrates will show thick stress fibers, whereas the stress fibers seen in cells grown on softer substrates will be less pronounced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tojkander|first1=S.|last2=Gateva|first2=G.|last3=Lappalainen|first3=P.|title=Actin stress fibers - assembly, dynamics and biological roles|journal=Journal of Cell Science|date=29 April 2012|volume=125|issue=8|pages=1855–1864|doi=10.1242/jcs.098087|pmid=22544950}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanical force transmitted to focal adhesions by stress fibers can also alter the conformation of mechanosensitive focal adhesion proteins, such as p130Cas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sawada|first1=Yasuhiro|last2=Tamada|first2=Masako|last3=Dubin-Thaler|first3=Benjamin J.|last4=Cherniavskaya|first4=Oksana|last5=Sakai|first5=Ryuichi|last6=Tanaka|first6=Sakae|last7=Sheetz|first7=Michael P.|title=Force Sensing by Mechanical Extension of the Src Family Kinase Substrate p130Cas|journal=Cell|date=December 2006|volume=127|issue=5|pages=1015–1026|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.09.044|pmid=17129785|pmc=2746973}}&lt;/ref&gt; and talins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kanchanawong|first1=Pakorn|last2=Shtengel|first2=Gleb|last3=Pasapera|first3=Ana M.|last4=Ramko|first4=Ericka B.|last5=Davidson|first5=Michael W.|last6=Hess|first6=Harald F.|last7=Waterman|first7=Clare M.|title=Nanoscale architecture of integrin-based cell adhesions|journal=Nature|date=25 November 2010|volume=468|issue=7323|pages=580–584|doi=10.1038/nature09621|pmid=21107430|pmc=3046339}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that stress fiber contractility may translate mechanical signals into biochemical cues. 
There are also a small subset of focal adhesion-associated integrins that terminate in the perinuclear actin cap (at the top of the nucleus), and are anchored there by the [[LINC complex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Dong-Hwee|last2=Khatau|first2=Shyam B.|last3=Feng|first3=Yunfeng|last4=Walcott|first4=Sam|last5=Sun|first5=Sean X.|last6=Longmore|first6=Gregory D.|last7=Wirtz|first7=Denis|title=Actin cap associated focal adhesions and their distinct role in cellular mechanosensing|journal=Scientific Reports|date=3 August 2012|volume=2|doi=10.1038/srep00555|pmid=22870384|pmc=3412326}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cap-associated focal adhesions have been established as major mediators in mechanosensing, and represent a direct pathway for the transduction of mechanical cues from focal adhesions to the nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Dong-Hwee|last2=Khatau|first2=Shyam B.|last3=Feng|first3=Yunfeng|last4=Walcott|first4=Sam|last5=Sun|first5=Sean X.|last6=Longmore|first6=Gregory D.|last7=Wirtz|first7=Denis|title=Actin cap associated focal adhesions and their distinct role in cellular mechanosensing|journal=Scientific Reports|date=3 August 2012|volume=2|doi=10.1038/srep00555|pmid=22870384|pmc=3412326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stress fibers in motile and non-motile cells==
The structure of stress fibers differs between motile and non-motile cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deguchi|first1=Shinji|title=Biomechanical properties of actin stress fibers of non-motile cells|journal=Biorheology|date=February 11, 2009|volume=46|issue= 2, 2009|pages=93–105|doi=10.3233/BIR-2009-0528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stress fibers in motile and non-motile cells are similar in that they both contain actin filaments which are cross-linked by α-actinin and myosin II, however the spatial orientation of individual actin filaments within the stress fiber differ between motile and non-motile cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deguchi|first1=Shinji|title=Biomechanical properties of actin stress fibers of non-motile cells|journal=Biorheology|date=February 11, 2009|volume=46|issue= 2, 2009|pages=93–105|doi=10.3233/BIR-2009-0528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stress fibers in the ventral region of motile cells show an overall shift in individual actin filament orientation along the longitudinal axis of the stress fiber, such that the plus-ends of filaments are always predominantly pointing towards focal adhesions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cramer|first1=L. P.|title=Identification of Novel Graded Polarity Actin Filament Bundles in Locomoting Heart Fibroblasts: Implications for the Generation of Motile Force|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=24 March 1997|volume=136|issue=6|pages=1287–1305|doi=10.1083/jcb.136.6.1287|pmc=2132518}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stress fibers in the ventral regions of non-motile cells show a ''periodic'' polarity that is similar to the organization of the [[sarcomere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lazarides|first1=Elias|last2=Burridge|first2=Keith|title=α-Actinin: Immunofluorescent localization of a muscle structural protein in nonmuscle cells|journal=Cell|date=November 1975|volume=6|issue=3|pages=289–298|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(75)90180-4|pmid=802682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical applications==
As discussed above, Rho is responsible for the formation of stress fibers. Misregulation of the Rho family of GTPases is implicated in many diseases. Common clinical applications that target Rho GTPases can be found [[Rho family of GTPases#Applications|here]].

'''Traffic waves''', also called '''stop waves''', '''ghost jams''', or '''traffic shocks''', are traveling disturbances in the distribution of cars on a [[highway]]. Traffic waves travel backwards relative to the cars themselves.&lt;ref&gt; Daganzo C.F
1994 The cell transmission model: a simple dynamic representation of highway traffic. Trans. Res. B. 28, 269–287. doi:10.1016/0191-2615(94)90002-7&lt;/ref&gt; Relative to a fixed spot on the road the wave can move with, or against the traffic, or even be stationary (when the waves moves away from the traffic with exactly the same speed as the traffic). Traffic waves are a type of [[traffic jam]]. A deeper understanding of traffic waves is a goal of the physical study of [[traffic flow]], in which traffic itself can often be seen using techniques similar to those used in [[fluid dynamics]].

==Mitigation==
It has been said&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://trafficwaves.org/trafexp.html Traffic Wave Experiments], William J. Beaty, 1998{{unreliable source|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that by knowing how traffic waves are created, drivers can sometimes reduce their effects by increasing vehicle [[headway]]s and reducing the use of [[brake]]s, ultimately alleviating [[traffic congestion]] for everyone in the area.
However, in other models,{{Which|date=September 2012}} increasing headway leads to diminishing the capacity of the travel lanes, increasing the congestion; however, disputed by acknowledging that similar principles apply to herding sheep through gates, and that in such a case, via human intervention, [[soliton]]s are diminished simply by slapping "stuck sheep" and holding back aggressive sheep. In funnelling sheep through gates it can be determined how much intervention is needed to curb bottlenecks. Similar principles can be applied to human traffic streams, where, if each individual had the knowledge of final destination and complete route planning, then traversal along a route would be done so with the full knowledge that any abrupt change from any itinerary causes delays for those about to traverse the same route.

==History==
The earliest theoretical model of traffic shock waves was offered by Lighthill and Whitman in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Lighthill, M. J.; Whitham, G. B., [http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsa/229/1178/317.short "On kinematic waves: II. A theory of traffic flow on long crowded roads"], ''The Royal Society: Proceedings A'', vol. 229, iss. 1178, pp. 317-345, May 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year [[Paul I. Richards|Paul Richards]] independently published a similar model.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Paul I., [http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.4.1.42 "Shock waves on the highway"], ''Operations Research'', vol. 4, iss. 1, pp. 42-51, 1 February 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both papers were based on fluid dynamics and the model is known as the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model.&lt;ref&gt;Kerner, Boris S., ''The Physics of Traffic'', Springer, 2012 {{ISBN|3540409866}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>clarify mean free paths - they can be much larger than 40 km</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16152">'''Ultra-high vacuum''' ('''UHV''') is the [[vacuum]] regime characterised by [[pressure]]s lower than about 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; [[pascal (unit)|pascal]] or 100 nanopascals (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; [[milli|m]][[Bar (unit)|bar]], ~10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; [[torr]]). UHV conditions are created by pumping the gas out of a UHV chamber. At these low pressures the [[mean free path]] of a gas molecule is greater than approximately 40&amp;nbsp;km, so the gas is in [[free molecular flow]], and gas molecules will collide with the chamber walls many times before colliding with each other. Almost all molecular interactions therefore take place on various surfaces in the chamber.

UHV conditions are integral to scientific research. [[Surface science]] experiments often require a chemically clean sample surface with the absence of any unwanted [[Adsorption|adsorbates]]. Surface analysis tools such as [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] and [[low energy ion scattering]] require UHV conditions for the transmission of electron or ion beams. For the same reason, beam pipes in particle accelerators such as the [[Large Hadron Collider]] are kept at UHV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Material limitations ==
Maintaining UHV conditions requires the use of unusual materials for equipment. Heating of the entire system above 100&amp;nbsp;°C for many hours ("baking") to remove water and other trace gases which [[adsorption|adsorb]] on the surfaces of the chamber is required upon "cycling" the equipment to atmosphere. To save time, energy, and integrity of the UHV volume an "interlock" is often used. The interlock volume has one door or valve facing the UHV side of the volume, and another door against atmospheric pressure through which samples or workpieces are initially introduced. After sample introduction and assuring that the door against atmosphere is closed, the interlock volume is typically pumped down to a medium-high vacuum. In some cases the workpiece itself is baked out or otherwise pre-cleaned under this medium-high vacuum. The gateway to the UHV chamber is then opened, the workpiece transferred to the UHV by robotic means or by other contrivance if necessary, and the UHV valve re-closed. While the initial workpiece is being processed under UHV, a subsequent sample can be introduced into the interlock volume, pre-cleaned, and so-on and so-forth, saving much time. Although a "puff" of gas is generally released into the UHV system when the valve to the interlock volume is opened, the UHV system pumps can generally snatch this gas away before it has time to adsorb onto the UHV surfaces. In a system well designed with suitable interlocks, the UHV components seldom need bakeout and the UHV may improve over time even as workpieces are introduced and removed.

Many common materials are used sparingly if at all due to high vapor pressure, high adsorptivity or absorptivity resulting in subsequent troublesome outgassing, or high permeability in the face of differential pressure (i.e.: "through-gassing"):
* Majority of [[organic compounds]] cannot be used:
** [[Plastics]], other than [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]] and [[Polyether ether ketone|PEEK]]: [[gasket]]s are made of copper, and are single-use; plastics in other uses are replaced with [[ceramic materials|ceramics]] or metals.  Limited use of fluoroelastomers (such as [[Viton]]) and perfluoroelastomers (such as [[Kalrez]]) as gasket materials can be considered if metal gaskets are inconvenient, though these polymers can be expensive.
** [[Glue]]s: special glues for high vacuum must be used.
* Some [[steels]]: due to oxidization of [[carbon steel]], which greatly increases adsorption area, only [[stainless steel]] is used.  Particularly, non-leaded and low-sulfur [[austenitic stainless steel|austenitic]] grades such as [[304 stainless steel|304]] and [[316 stainless steel|316]] are preferred.  These steels include at least 18% chromium and 8% nickel.  Variants of stainless steel include low-carbon grades (such as [[304L]] and [[316L]]), and grades with additives such as [[niobium]] and [[molybdenum]] to reduce the formation of [[chromium carbide]] (which provides no corrosion resistance).  Common designations include 316L (low carbon), and 316LN (low carbon with nitrogen).  Chromium carbide precipitation at the [[grain boundaries]] can render a stainless steel less resistant to oxidation.  
* [[Lead]]: Soldering is performed using [[Solder#Lead-free solder|lead-free solder]].
* [[Indium]]: Indium is sometimes used as a deformable gasket material for vacuum seals, especially in cryogenic apparatus, but its low melting point prevents use in baked systems.
* [[Zinc]], [[cadmium]]: High vapor pressures during system bake-out.
* Cleaning is very important for UHV.  Common cleaning procedures include degreasing with detergents, [[organic solvents]], or [[chlorinated hydrocarbons]].  [[Electropolishing]] is often used to reduce the surface area from which adsorbed gases can be emitted. Etching of stainless steel using hydrofluoric and nitric acid forms a chromium rich surface, followed by a nitric acid [[passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] step, which forms a chromium oxide rich surface.  This surface retards the diffusion of hydrogen into the chamber.

Technical limitations: 
* [[Screws]]: Threads have a high surface area and tend to "trap" gases, and therefore, are avoided.  Blind holes are especially avoided, due to the trapped gas at the base of the screw and slow venting through the threads, which is commonly known as a "virtual leak".  This can be mitigated by designing components to include through-holes for all threaded connections, or by using vented screws (which have a hole drilled through their central axis or a notch along the threads). Vented Screws allow trapped gases to flow freely from the base of the screw, eliminating virtual leaks and speeding up the pump-down process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vented Screws - AccuGroup|url=https://www.accu.co.uk/en/971-vented-screws|publisher=accu.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Welding]]: Processes such as [[gas metal arc welding]] and [[shielded metal arc welding]] cannot be used, due to the deposition of [[slag|impure material]] and potential introduction of voids or porosity. [[Gas tungsten arc welding]] (with an appropriate heat profile and properly selected filler material) is necessary. Other clean processes, such as [[electron beam welding]] or [[laser beam welding]], are also acceptable; however, those that involve potential [[slag]] inclusions (such as [[submerged arc welding]] and [[flux-cored arc welding]]) are obviously not. To avoid trapping gas or high vapor pressure molecules, welds must fully penetrate the joint or be made from the interior surface.

== Typical uses ==

Ultra-high vacuum is necessary for many surface analytic techniques such as:
* [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] (XPS)
* [[Auger electron spectroscopy]] (AES)
* [[Secondary ion mass spectrometry]] (SIMS)
* [[Thermal desorption spectroscopy]] (TPD)
* [[Thin film]] growth and preparation techniques with stringent requirements for purity, such as [[molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE), UHV [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD), [[atomic layer deposition]] (ALD) and UHV [[pulsed laser deposition]] (PLD)
* [[Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy]] (ARPES)
* [[Field emission microscopy]] and [[Field ion microscopy]]
* [[Atom Probe|Atom Probe Tomography]] (APT)

UHV is necessary for these applications to reduce surface contamination, by reducing the number of molecules reaching the sample over a given time period.  At 0.1 mPa (10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; Torr), it only takes 1 second to cover a surface with a contaminant, so much lower pressures are needed for long experiments.

UHV is also required for:
* [[Particle accelerator]]s The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has three UH vacuum systems. The lowest pressure is found in the pipes the proton beam speeds through near the interaction (collision) points. Here helium cooling pipes also act as cryopumps. The maximum allowable pressure is 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; Pa (10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; mbar) 
* [[Gravitational wave detector]]s such as [[LIGO]], [[Virgo interferometer|VIRGO]], [[GEO 600]], and [[TAMA 300]]. The [[LIGO]] experimental apparatus is housed in a 10,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (353,000 cu.ft.) vacuum chamber at 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; Pa (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; mbar) in order to eliminate temperature fluctuations and sound waves which would jostle the mirrors far too much for gravity waves to be sensed. 
* [[Atomic physics]] experiments which use cold atoms, such as [[ion trap]]ping or making [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s
and, while not compulsory, can prove beneficial in applications such as:
* [[Molecular beam epitaxy]], [[Electron beam evaporation|E-beam evaporation]], [[sputtering]] and other deposition techniques.   
* [[Atomic force microscopy]]. High vacuum enables high [[Q factor]]s on the cantilever oscillation.
* [[Scanning tunneling microscopy]]. High vacuum reduces oxidation and contamination, hence enables imaging and the achievement of atomic resolution on clean metal and [[semiconductor]] surfaces, e.g. imaging the [[surface reconstruction]] of the unoxidized [[silicon]] surface.
* [[Electron-beam lithography]]

== Achievement ==
Typically, UHV requires:
*High pumping speed &amp;mdash; possibly multiple [[vacuum pump]]s in series and/or parallel
*Minimize surface area in the chamber
*High conductance tubing to pumps &amp;mdash; short and fat, without obstruction
*Use low-[[outgassing]] materials such as certain stainless steels
*Avoid creating pits of trapped gas behind bolts, welding voids, etc.
*[[Electropolishing|Electropolish]] all metal parts after machining or welding
*Use low vapor pressure materials (ceramics, glass, metals, teflon if unbaked)
*Bake the system to remove water or hydrocarbons [[adsorbed]] to the walls
*Chill chamber walls to [[cryogenic]] temperatures during use
*Avoid all traces of hydrocarbons, including skin oils in a fingerprint &amp;mdash; always use gloves

[[Outgassing]] is a problem for UHV systems. Outgassing can occur from two sources: surfaces and bulk materials. Outgassing from bulk materials is minimized by selection of materials with low vapor pressures (such as glass, [[stainless steel]], and [[ceramic]]s) for everything inside the system. Materials which are not generally considered absorbent can outgas, including most plastics and some metals. For example, vessels lined with a highly gas-permeable material such as [[palladium]] (which is a high-capacity [[hydrogen]] sponge) create special outgassing problems.

Outgassing from surfaces is a subtler problem. At extremely low pressures, more gas molecules are adsorbed on the walls than are floating in the chamber, so the total surface area inside a chamber is more important than its volume for reaching UHV. Water is a significant source of outgassing because a thin layer of water vapor rapidly adsorbs to everything whenever the chamber is opened to air. Water evaporates from surfaces too slowly to be fully removed at room temperature, but just fast enough to present a continuous level of background contamination. Removal of water and similar gases generally requires baking the UHV system at 200 to 400&amp;nbsp;°C while vacuum pumps are running. During chamber use, the walls of the chamber may be chilled using [[liquid nitrogen]] to reduce outgassing further.

[[Hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]] are the most common background gases in a well-designed, well-baked UHV system. Both Hydrogen and CO diffuse out from the [[grain boundaries]] in stainless steel. Helium could diffuse through the steel and glass from the outside air, but this effect is usually negligible due to the low abundance of He in the atmosphere.

There is no single [[vacuum pump]] that can operate all the way from atmospheric pressure to ultra-high vacuum. Instead, a series of different pumps is used, according to the appropriate pressure range for each pump. Pumps commonly used to achieve UHV include:
*[[Turbomolecular pump]]s (especially compound and/or [[magnetic bearing]] types)
*[[Ion pump]]s
*[[Titanium sublimation pump]]s
*[[Non-Evaporable Getter|Non-evaporable getter (NEG) pumps]]
*[[Cryopump]]s

UHV pressures are measured with an [[ion gauge]], either a hot filament or an inverted magnetron type.

Metal seals, with knife edges on both sides cutting into a soft, copper gasket. This all-metal seal can maintain pressures down to 100 pPa (~10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; Torr).

== UHV manipulator ==
A '''UHV manipulator''' allows an object which is inside a vacuum chamber and under vacuum to be mechanically positioned.  It may provide rotary
motion, linear motion, or a combination of both.  The most complex devices give motion in three axes and rotations around two of those axes.  To generate the mechanical movement inside the chamber, two basic mechanisms are commonly employed: a mechanical coupling through the vacuum wall (using a vacuum-tight seal around the coupling), or a magnetic coupling that transfers motion from air-side to vacuum-side.  Various forms of motion control are available for manipulators, such as knobs, handwheels, motors, [[stepping motor]]s, [[piezoelectric motor]]s, and [[pneumatics]].

The manipulator or sample holder may include features that allow additional control and testing of a sample, such as the ability to apply heat, cooling, voltage, or a magnetic field.  Sample heating can be accomplished by electron bombardment or thermal radiation. For electron bombardment, the sample holder is equipped with a filament which emits electrons when biased at a high negative potential. The impact of the
electrons bombarding the sample at high energy causes it to heat.  For thermal radiation, a filament is mounted close to the sample and resistively heated to high temperature. The infrared energy from the filament heats the sample.
