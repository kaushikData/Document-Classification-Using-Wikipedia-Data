      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1646">The '''Agreement on a Cease-fire and Separation of Forces''' was signed by parties to the [[Georgian-Abkhazian conflict]] in Moscow on 14 May 1994. Also known as the '''1994 Moscow Agreement''', it was witnessed by [[United Nations]], [[Russian Federation]] and [[Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe]] representatives. The agreement was recognised in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 934]].

[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Abkhazia]] agreed to a cease fire and the creation of a security zone clear of heavy weapons separating the parties. A peacekeeping force of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] would monitor compliance of the agreement, with the assistance of the [[United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia]] (UNOMIG).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2701">'''Ayxun''' or '''Aissó''' was a nobleman who led a revolt in [[Barcelona]], [[Ausona]], and [[Girona]] in 826 to 827.  His identity is uncertain.

Aissó is thought to have been either a [[Visigoth|Goth]] and former lieutenant of the disposed Count [[Berà]], or an [[Arab]] ([[Ayxun ibn Sulayman ibn Yaqdhan al-Arabí]]), the son of Sulayman al-Arabi who had been imprisoned in [[Aachen]] after being captured by Frankish forces at Girona.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = Jordi Auladell |date=2009-07-09|accessdate=2017-12-03

|title=Aissó i Guillemó, una revolta nacional a la Catalunya Vella del segle IX
|language=ca
|publisher=Fundació d'Estudis Històrics de Catalunya
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Bernat of Septimania]] was anointed Count of Barcelona, Aisso joined the revolt against the new count. Only the castle of [[Roda de Ter]], in the county of Ausona, resisted and was destroyed by revolters. Many Goth nobles joined Aissó and [[Guillemó]] (or Guillemundus) son of Berà and Count of [[Rasez]] and [[Conflent]].

Aissó raided the County of Cerdanya and the region of Vallés from his base in the centre of Catalonia.  The young Count Bernat requested and received some help from the Emperor, as well as from some local Goth noblemen or "Hispani" (826).

Faced with this opposition, Aissó appealed to the sole power that could be compared to the [[Franks]], the [[Emir of Córdoba]].  He sent a deputation, led by his brother, to request help from [[Abd ar-Rahman II]].  He sent his General, [[Ubayd Allah Abu Marwan|Ubayd Allah]] (also known as Abu Marwan), who arrived in [[Zaragoza]] in May 827.  From there, his forces entered the territory of the County of Barcelona, reaching the City of Barcelona later that summer.  The City was besieged without success; however, the surroundings were ransacked.  The army then moved to Girona, which was attacked on October 10, 827.

When [[Louis I the Pious]] heard of the Muslim raid, he ordered to his son [[Pepin I of Aquitaine]], and Counts [[Hugo of Tours]] and [[Matfred of Orleans]] to recruit an army.  However, recruitment was slow and, by the time it was formed, Abu Merwan was already returning south.  The rebels fled with them in 826.  Aissó probably sought refuge in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], where he was later murdered on the orders of the [[Emir]], who was suspicious of a conspiracy.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}  Guillemó also lived the rest of his life in exile in Córdoba.

The '''Albanian National Army''' ('''ANA'''; {{lang-sq|Armata Kombëtare Shqiptare}}, AKSh), is an Albanian paramilitary organization which operates in the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Serbia]]&lt;ref&gt;Only in the [[Preševo Valley]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kosovo]].&lt;ref&gt;During 2014, it declared that it would intervene in northern [[North Mitrovica|Mitrovica]]&lt;/ref&gt; The group opposes the [[Ohrid Agreement|Ohrid Framework Agreement]] which ended the [[2001 insurgency in Macedonia]] between members of the [[National Liberation Army (Macedonia)|National Liberation Army]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] security forces.

==History==
It was formed in 2001 in the Republic of Macedonia and, in 2003, the [[UNMIK]] declared it a terrorist organization.&lt;ref&gt;''Global Terrorism Organizations Yearbook''. International Business Publications, USA. p. 126. {{ISBN|0-7397-1164-4}}. Google Book Search. Retrieved on February 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is associated with [[Albanian nationalism#FBKSh|FBKSh]] (National Front for Reunification of Albanians), its political wing.

The ANA appeared in Kosovo in 2003, where on March 7, two members trying to detonate a bomb were shot and killed by Serbian police.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2003/27874.htm Serbia and Montenegro: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2003] [[U.S. Department of State]]. February 25, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a video was aired by [[Television in Kosovo|Kosovar television station]]s depicting a band of medium-armed, masked individuals intercepting cars. In October, 2007 the unit declared it would seize the [[Serb]] exclave of [[North Kosovo]] by force if the Kosovo Protection Force did not occupy it by 1 November 2007. The ANA has claimed that it is patrolling North Kosovo to prevent incursions by the [[Czar Lazar Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2007/11/14/feature-01 Report: ANA paramilitaries patrolling northern Kosovo towns]&lt;/ref&gt;

In early November 2007, insurgents of the "Political Advisory Body of the Kosovo Liberation Army" suffered a minor crackdown, dubbed [[Operation Mountain Storm]] by the [[Army of the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian armed forces]] in north-western Macedonia. According to Macedonian authorities; six members of the KLA were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/11/195E47EB-2673-4C5C-8405-63613911F406.html|title=Firefight Kills Eight In Macedonia Near Kosovo Border|work=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 November 2007, a video was aired to the public{{citationneeded|date=October 2017}}, an exclusive interview with a leader of the ANA patrolling in the covert areas of North Kosovo, recruiting 20 new men. The leader stated that ANA stands at 12,000 men altogether and has called the Kosovar population for a boycott of then-[[Kosovan parliamentary election, 2007|forthcoming elections]].

The ANA had committed an attack on 29 April 2010 on the border between Kosovo and the Republic of Macedonia, in which a Macedonian policeman was killed. In the skirmish, one ANA fighter was injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondo.rs/s168524/Info/ex-YU/ONA_odgovorna_za_pucnjavu_u_Makedoniji.html|title=ONA odgovorna za pucnjavu u Makedoniji|work=Mondo Portal|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Antisemitism}}

'''Antisemitic boycotts''', also known as '''anti-Jewish boycotts''' are organized [[boycotts]] directed against [[Jewish people]] to exclude them economical, political or cultural life. Antisemitic boycotts are often regarded as a manifestation of popular [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref name=jvl&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-Semitism: Anti-Jewish Boycotts|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/boycotts.html|work=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Age of Enlightenment]] brought with it notions of [[Equality before the law|legal equality]] in Europe that led to Jewish citizens being granted equal rights, first in France, following the French Revolution and then over the course of the Nineteenth Century, across Western Europe. This process was opposed by some extremist Christian religious groups and movements, which could be seen as antisemitic, as they regarded the Jewish people as morally inferior, or felt threatened by their supposed [[wikt:acumen|acumen]]. There were a variety of movements calling for boycotts of Jews and discrimination based round universities (often in the form of [[Jewish quota|Jewish educational quotas]] and ''[[Numerus clausus]]'') was particularly prevalent.  In almost every country in Europe, boycotts ultimately led to the revocation of civil rights, murder and systematic extermination.

In Hungary, agitation for boycotts began in 1875 with an antisemitic speech from  [[Győző Istóczy]] in the Hungarian House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = "BETWEEN EMANCIPATION AND ANTISEMITISM: JEWISH PRESENCE IN PARLIAMENTARY POLITICS IN HUNGARY 1867–1884".|last = Árpád Welker|first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = |quote = The first appearance of political antisemitism in Hungary was, as mentioned earlier, the speech of Győző Istóczy in the House of Representatives in 1875.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Strauss1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Herbert A.

Antisemitic Practice and Nationality Policies in Upper Hungary around 1900|url=http://www.quest-cdecjournal.it/focus.php?id=299|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government passed laws limiting Jewish economic activity from 1938 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=L.

In Russia, after a series of [[anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire]] following [[Assassination of Alexander II of Russia|the assassination of Tsar Alexander II]], towards that end in 1880 they were forbidden from purchasing land or taking mortgages (see the [[May Laws]]). Quotas limited Jewish access to educational institutions and from 1892 they were banned from participation in local elections and could constitute no more than 10% of company shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MAY LAWS|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10508-may-laws|work=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 19th century Austria, [[Karl Lueger]], an antisemitic mayor of Vienna who inspired Hitler,&lt;ref&gt;Fareed Zacharia, ''The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad'', Norton, 2003, 2007, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; campaigned for a boycott of Jewish businesses as a last resort for his party.&lt;ref name="Boyer1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=John W.

An organization called the ''[[Antisemitenbund]]'' campaigned against Jewish civil rights since 1919. Austrian campaigns tended to heighten around Christmas and became effective from 1932.&lt;ref name="Pauley_1992"&gt;Bruce F. Pauley, "From Prejudice to Persecution: A History of Austrian Anti-Semitism," (North Carolina, 1992), page 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ireland, Father [[John Creagh]] in [[Limerick]] campaigned against the town's small Jewish community in 1904, leading to a boycott of Jewish businesses and the departure of the Jewish population from the town.&lt;ref&gt;Jews in Twentieth Century Ireland by Dermot Keogh, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Ukraine, there was a boycott of Jews in Galicia, alleging Jewish support for Poland, while Poles in Galicia boycotted Jews for supporting Ukraine.&lt;ref name=jvl/&gt; In 1921, the German student union, the ''Deutschen Hochschulring'', barred Jews from membership. Since the bar was racial, it included Jews who had converted to Christianity.&lt;ref name="Rubenstein"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Approaches to Auschwitz: the Holocaust and its legacy |first1=Richard L. |last1=Rubenstein |first2=John K. |last2=Roth |pages=123–124 |chapter=5.

The [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses]] in Germany took place on 1 April 1933 as a response to the [[Jewish boycott of German goods]] which had started soon after [[Adolf Hitler]] was sworn in as Chancellor on 30 January 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Berel Lang, Philosophical Witnessing: The Holocaust as Presence, p.132&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the first of many measures against the [[Jews of Germany]], which ultimately culminated in the "[[Final Solution]]". It was a state-managed campaign of ever-increasing harassment, arrests, systematic [[pillaging]], forced transfer of ownership to Nazi party activists (managed by the [[Chamber of Commerce]]), and ultimately murder of owners defined as "Jews". In Berlin alone, there were 50,000 Jewish owned businesses.&lt;ref name="Kreutzmüller_2013"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.berlin.de/2013/en/partners/publications/metropol-verlag-christoph-kreutzmueller/ |title=Final Sale – The Destruction of Jewish Owned Businesses in Nazi Berlin 1930–1945 |first=Christoph |last=Kreutzmüller |publisher=Metropol-Verlag |year=2012 |isbn=978-3-86331-080-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1945 they all had [[Aryan]] owners.

In Poland, the Endeks (founded by [[Roman Dmowski]]) organized boycotts of Jewish businesses across Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cang |first=Joel |title=The Opposition Parties in Poland and Their Attitude towards the Jews and the Jewish Question |pages=241–256 |journal=Jewish Social Studies |volume=1 |issue=2 |year=1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Polish universities placed growing limits on the number of Jews allowed to attend,&lt;ref&gt;No Way Out: The Politics of Polish Jewry, 1935-1939.

In the USA, Nazi supporters, such as Father Charles Coughlin (an Irish immigrant), agitated for a boycott of Jewish businesses.

In the 2000s, the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|BDS]] movement, which advocates for a total boycott of Israeli products, was regarded by some Jewish [[civil rights]] organizations (such as the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]), as well as pro-Israel organizations and scholars as driven by antisemitism.&lt;ref name="AlgemeinerSWC"&gt;[http://www.algemeiner.com/2013/03/19/simon-wiesenthal-center-report-bds-a-thinly-veiled-anti-israel-and-anti-semitic-poison-pill/ "Simon Wiesenthal Center Report: BDS 'a Thinly-Veiled, Anti-Israel and Anti-Semitic "Poison Pill."'] ''The Algemeiner''. 19 March 2013. 7 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/03/17/israeli-boycott/1930085/ "Anti-Israel groups push product, performers boycott."] ''USA Today''. 17 March 2013. 8 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NGOMonitorBDS"&gt;[http://www.ngo-monitor.org/article/ngo_leadership_in_boycott_and_divestment_campaigns#antisemitic "Boycotts, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Resource Page."] ''NGO Monitor''. 14 July 2011. 1 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Femke Halsema twist.jpg|thumb|300px|Femke Halsema (2010)]]
The political discussion on basic income was initiated in 1975 by [[Leo Jansen]], an MP for the progressive Christian [[Political Party of Radicals]] (PPR) and [[Vrije Universiteit]] professor [[J. P. Kuiper]]. In 1977 the issue had been incorporated in the [[election manifesto]]s of the PPR. The idea was also endorsed by several smaller trade unions of the [[Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging|Federation of Dutch Labour Unions]].&lt;ref name="Pels"/&gt;

In 1985, the [[Wetenschappelijke Raad voor het Regeringsbeleid|Scientific Council for Government Policy]], an independent [[think tank]] of the Dutch government, endorsed a partial basic income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The PPR and the trade unions which favoured the basic income rejected the Council's proposals because the proposed basic income would be too low and implementation would be accompanied by abolition of the [[minimum wage]].&lt;ref name="Pels"/&gt; The proposal of the Scientific Council broadened, however, the debate and the issue is debated upon in the social-democratic [[Dutch Labour Party|Labour Party]], the conservative liberal [[VVD|People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] and the progressive liberal [[D'66|Democrats 66]], but these parties did not adopt the basic income in their programs. In 1989 the PPR merged into the [[GreenLeft]], with the [[Pacifistisch Socialistische Partij|Pacifist Socialist Party]] (PSP), the [[Communist Party of the Netherlands]] (CPN) and the [[Evangelical People's Party (Netherlands)|Evangelical People's Party]]. In early 1990s the GreenLeft was ambiguous to the idea of a basic income, not endorsing it in its 1989 election manifesto,&lt;ref name="Pels"/&gt; but debating the issue in several publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1992 the debate is re-opened by the [[Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis]], an economic advisory body of the government, which like the Scientific Council endorsed a low basic income as part of simplified social security system. By 1995 the basic income was a prominent issue on the Dutch political agenda. The issue continued to be debated by political parties; the Labour Party debated the issue in its 1994 election manifesto but still rejected it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After the success of the [[Netherlands cabinet Kok-1|first cabinet-Kok]] to implement its agenda of "work, work, work" and increase the levels of employment the debate about the basic income lost attention and momentum.

'''''Challenge''''' was a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid-sized]] monthly newspaper established in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] in April 1933 which served as the official organ of the [[Young People's Socialist League (1907)|Young People's Socialist League]], youth section of the [[Socialist Party of America]]. The publication was subsequently renamed '''''The Challenge of Youth''''' and continued in existence through 1946.


==Publication history==
===Establishment===

The decision to launch a new official newspaper of the  [[Young People's Socialist League]] (YPSL) was made at the 1932 National Convention of the YPSL.&lt;ref name="Early"&gt;"The Early 'Challenge,'" ''The Challenge of Youth,'' vol. 4, no. 1 (April 1936), pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1933, this publication was launched, a 4-page tabloid called ''The Challenge.'' Throughout its first year, the publication campaigned against the threat of international war, [[fascism]], [[child labor]], and deficiencies in the American education system and lobbied on behalf of efforts to politically organize unemployed workers and to expand the [[trade union]] movement.&lt;ref name="Early" /&gt;

The first issue of ''The Challenge'' featured a lengthy [[masthead (publishing)|masthead]], including Arthur G. McDowell as Editor, James Quick, Bob Parker, Jack Jaffe, Aaron Levenstein, and Paul Rasmussen as Associate Editors, Hy Fish as Business Manager, and a Socialist Party all-star list including [[Norman Thomas]], [[Powers Hapgood]], [[Upton Sinclair]], and [[Oscar Ameringer]] as "Contributing Editors."&lt;ref&gt;"The Challenge," ''The Challenge,'' vol. 1, no. 1 (April 1933), pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Editor Syd Devin, later quit in order to finish his studies.&lt;ref name="Ewald"&gt;E. Ewald, "The Challenge Today," ''The Challenge of Youth,'' vol. 4, no. 1 (April 1936), pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Devin was replaced by Melos Most, who had previously been a delegate to the Executive Committee meeting of the [[Socialist Youth International]], held in Belgium in 1934.&lt;ref name="Ewald" /&gt; Most was later named as editor of the youth page of the New York weekly, ''[[The Socialist Call]].''&lt;ref name="Ewald" /&gt;

===First hiatus===

After shutting down for the summer of 1936, ''The Challenge of Youth'' returned in September. It was issued very irregularly, however, with an apologetic notice printed in the 4-page February 1937 issue noting that "the reason for it not appearing has been financial."&lt;ref name="Notes"&gt;"Challenge Notes," ''The Challenge of Youth,'' vol. 5, no. 1 (February 1937), pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted that the newspaper received no publication subsidy from the Socialist Party, with all its costs borne by the YPSL organization, which was holding evening festivities in Chicago in an effort to raise funds to insure the publication's survival.&lt;ref name="Notes" /&gt; Ernest Erber, National Secretary of the YPSL, had taken sole charge of the editorial task.&lt;ref name="Notes" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2911">The '''Czechoslovak Hockey Riots''' were a short lived series of protests, mildly violent on occasion (several people were injured), that took place in response to the [[1969 World Ice Hockey Championships]].

After the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet invasion into Czechoslovakia]] the political ideals of the [[Prague Spring]] were slowly but steadily replaced by politics of accommodation to the demands of the [[Soviet Union]]. People in Czechoslovakia, unable to find other ways to express their opinion, reacted with few very visible but ultimately ineffective manifestations of disagreement.

On March 21 and 28, 1969, the [[Czechoslovakia national ice hockey team]] beat the [[USSR national ice hockey team|Soviet team]] in the [[1969 World Ice Hockey Championships]] in [[Stockholm]]. Throughout [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], possibly 500,000 fans crowded the streets of their cities to celebrate the wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Williams|first = Kieran|year = 1997|title = The Prague spring and its aftermath : Czechoslovak politics, 1968-1970|publisher = Cambridge University Press|location = Cambridge, England|isbn = 0-521-58803-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some places, particularly [[Prague]], the celebrations turned to protests against the [[Soviet military]] who continued to occupy the country after the [[Warsaw Pact]] invasion the previous August. While the majority of these demonstrations were peaceful, some turned violent as protesters attacked Soviet military units. In Prague, protesters ransacked the Soviet [[Aeroflot]] office, though some have suggested they were encouraged by [[State Security (Czechoslovakia)|State Security]] agents.

The protests were suppressed by the Czechoslovak military and police, now under full control of the hardliners from the Communist Party. The events were used as a pretext to oust the remaining leaders of the Prague Spring. Among them, [[Alexander Dubček]] was forced to resign as First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]], to be replaced by [[Gustáv Husák]] who started the politics of "[[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|normalisation]]".

No active protests against the presence of Soviet troops occurred thereafter. During the years of normalization, citizens of Czechoslovakia saw hockey games against Soviet Union as a quiet, symbolic way to protest. Police forces were regularly set on alert but never used.

{{Basic forms of government}}
A '''diarchy''' (from [[ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|{{linktext|δι-}}}}, ''di-'', "double",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=di-, ''combined form'' |title=OED }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|grc|{{linktext|-αρχία}}}}, ''-arkhía'', "ruled")&lt;ref name=doed&gt;{{citation |contribution=diarchy, ''n.'' |title=OED }}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Occasionally misspelled ''dyarchy'',&lt;ref name=doed/&gt; as in the ''[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]'' article on the colonial British institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=Dyarchy |contribution-url=https://global.britannica.com/topic/dyarchy |title=Encyclopaedia Britannica |date=2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} or '''duumvirate''' (from [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|[[wikt:duumviratus#Latin|duumvirātus]]}}'', "the office of the two men")&lt;ref name=duuuum&gt;{{citation |title=OED |contribution=duumvirate, ''n.'' }}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Occasionally in the mistaken form ''duovirate''.}} is a form of government characterized by '''corule''', with two people ruling a polity together either [[de jure|lawfully]] or ''[[de facto]]'', by collusion and force. The leaders of such a system are usually known as '''corulers'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=co-ruler, ''n.'' |title=OED }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, ''diarchy'' particularly referred to the system of shared rule in [[British India]]&lt;ref name=doed/&gt; established by the Government of India Acts [[Government of India Act, 1919|of 1919]] and [[Government of India Act, 1935|1935]], which devolved some powers to local councils, which had included native Indian representation under the [[Indian Councils Act 1892]]. 'Duumvirate' principally referred to the offices of the various [[duumviri]] established by the [[Roman Republic]].&lt;ref name=duuuum/&gt; Both, along with less common synonyms such as '''biarchy'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=biarchy, ''n.'' |title=OED }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and '''tandemocracy''',{{sfnp|Hale &amp; al.|2012}}{{efn|The [[pun]] 'tandemocracy' particularly refers to the Putin–Medvedev diarchy, as it is a [[calque]] of [[Russian language|Russian]] ''tandemokratiya'' ({{lang|ru|тандемократия}}).}} are now used more generally to refer to any system of joint rule or office. A [[monarchy]] temporarily controlled by two or more people is, however, usually distinguished as a [[coregency]].

Corule is one of the oldest forms of government. Historical examples include the [[Pandyan dynasty]] of [[Tamilakam]],  [[Sparta]]'s [[Kings of Sparta|joint kingdom]], the [[Roman Republic]]'s [[Roman consul|consuls]], [[ancient Carthage|Carthage]]'s [[shophet|Judges]], and several ancient [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] societies. Systems of inheritance that often led to corule in [[Germanic kingship|Germanic]] and [[Dacians|Dacian]] monarchies may be included as well, as may the dual occupants of the ranks of the [[Inca Empire]]. Modern examples of diarchies are [[Andorra]], whose princes are the [[President of France]] and the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell|Bishop of Urgell]] in [[Spain]]; [[San Marino]], whose republic is led by two [[Captains Regent]]; and [[Swaziland]], where sovereignty rests jointly in the king and his mother.

==Formal use==
=== Current diarchies ===
==== Andorra ====
{{main|Government of Andorra|List of Co-Princes of Andorra}}
[[Andorra]] is a parliamentary co-[[principality]]. Its princes are (''[[ex officio]]'') the [[France|French]] [[president of France|president]] and the [[Bishop of Urgell|bishop]] of [[diocese of Urgell|Urgell]] in [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Since 1962, the French president has been [[French presidential election|elected]] by [[universal suffrage]] within [[France]]. The bishop of the diocese of Urgell is appointed by the [[Roman Catholic]] [[pope]].

==== Bhutan ====
{{main|Government of Bhutan|List of kings of Bhutan}}
The [[Constitution of Bhutan|2008 Constitution]] affirms [[Bhutan]]'s commitment to a [[Tibetan system of dual government|traditional dual government]] sharing power between the [[Druk Gyalpo]] ("King") and the Buddhist religious authorities led by the [[Je Khenpo]]. In practice, however, the religious leaders function more as advisors to the kings than as corulers.

====Northern Ireland====
Under the terms of the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]] intended to end [[The Troubles|conflict]] in [[Northern Ireland]], the [[First Minister of Northern Ireland|First Minister]] and [[deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland|deputy First Minister]] serve as joint heads of the area's [[Northern Ireland Executive|executive]]. Both positions exercise identical executive powers; however they are not heads of state.

==== San Marino ====
{{main|Government of San Marino|List of Captains Regent of San Marino}}
The [[captains regent]] ({{lang-it|Capitani Reggenti}}) of [[San Marino]] are elected every six months by the Marinese parliament, the Grand and General Council.  They serve as heads of state and government and are normally chosen from opposing parties.

==== Swaziland ====
{{main|Government of Swaziland|List of kings of Swaziland}}
The [[Swaziland|Kingdom of Swaziland]] is a diarchy in which the [[List of Kings of Swaziland|King]] ([[Ngwenyama]]) rules in conjunction with his mother, the [[Queen mother|Queen Mother]] ([[Ndlovukati]]). In practice, however, most power is vested in the King, though it is often argued that the giving of authority wholesale to the royal male in this way is a neo-traditionalistic as opposed to truly traditional custom.{{Citation needed|reason=Consuls being diarchs|date=March 2013}}

===Historical diarchies===

====Sparta====
{{main|Government of ancient Sparta|List of Spartan kings}}
The office of king in [[ancient Sparta]] was divided between two kings from separate dynasties, each holding a [[veto]] over the other's actions.

====Roman Republic====
{{main|List of Roman consuls|Duumviri}}
Following the [[overthrow of the Roman monarchy]], the Romans established an [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] [[Roman Republic]] which divided [[imperium|supreme executive power]] ({{lang-la|imperium}}) between two [[Roman consul|consuls]], both elected each year and each holding a [[veto]] over the other's actions.

The historical [[duumviri]] were not rulers but magistrates, performing various judicial, religious, or public functions.

====Hungary====
The [[Hungarians]] originally possessed a system of dual kingship, with religious authority vested in the [[kende]] and military authority vested in the [[gyula (title)|war-chief]] (''{{lang|hu|gyula}}''). When the kende [[Kurszán]] was killed {{c.|904}} a little after the arrival of the Hungarians in [[Pannonia]], his role was usurped by the war-chief [[Árpád]], establishing the Hungarian monarchy.

====Medieval Europe====
{{main|Paréage}}
A [[paréage]] was a [[feudalism|feudal]] treaty recognizing the "[[pari passu|equal footing]]" ({{lang-la|pari passu}}) of two sovereigns over a territory. The most famous such arrangement was the [[Paréage of Andorra 1278|1278 treaty]] that established modern [[Andorra]]. Others include [[Maastricht]], which was shared by the [[Duke of Brabant]] and the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]]. After the establishment of the [[Dutch Republic]], it became a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] of Liège and the United Provinces, which administered it through the [[States General of the Netherlands]] until 1794.

====Japan====
During [[Japan]]'s [[Shōgun|shogunate]], the [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]] was notionally a supreme spiritual and temporal lord who delegated authority for joint rule to the ''[[shōgun]]''. In practice, the ''shōguns''{{'}} power was so complete that they are usually considered ''[[de facto]]'' monarchs rather than [[viceroy]]s or corulers.

====Tibet====
{{main|Tibetan dual system of government|List of Dalai Lamas}}
Between 1642 and 1751, political power in [[Tibet]] was shared between the [[5th Dalai Lama|5th]], [[6th Dalai Lama|6th]], and [[7th Dalai Lama|7th Dalai Lamas]] who headed the realm's Buddhist [[state religion]] and various secular rulers known as desis. The growing power of the desis caused the 7th Dalai Lama to abolish the post and replace it with a council known as the [[Kashag]], permitting him to consolidate his authority over the realm. A similar system arose in [[Bhutan]], with the [[House of Wangchuck|Wangchuck]] [[penlop|governor]] (''penlop'') of [[Trongsa]] becoming the [[Druk Desi]] and [[Druk Gyalpo]] in 1907. In contrast to Tibet, the dynasty eventually consolidated its power and now rules as the kings of Bhutan.

====England====
After the 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]] and the overthrow of [[James II and VII]], his daughter [[Mary II]] and nephew [[William III of England|William III]] acted as joint rulers of the Three Kingdoms (England, Scotland and Ireland) until Mary's death in 1694).

====Canada ====
{{main|Government of the Province of Canada|List of joint premiers of the Province of Canada}}
The [[British colonial empire|colonial]] [[Province of Canada]] was usually governed by two [[joint premiers of the province of Canada|joint premiers]] from 1841 to 1867. Usually, one was chosen from the English-speaking [[Canada West]] and the other one from the French-speaking [[Canada East]].

====Russia====
{{main|February Revolution|October Revolution|Dual Power in Russia}}
Between the [[February Revolution]] in March 1917 and the [[October Revolution]] in November, political power in Russia was divided between the [[Russian Provisional Government]] and the [[Petrograd Soviet]], a condition described by [[Vladimir Lenin]] as "Dual Power". He elaborated the situation into a [[dual power (Communism)|dual-power doctrine]], whereby [[Communist]]s collaborated with and then supplanted existing bourgeois forms of government.

====India====
Named as the [[India Secretary]] for the [[Lloyd George ministry]], [[Edwin Samuel Montagu]] made the "[[Grand Declaration]]" on 20 August 1917 that British policy would henceforth be "increasing association of Indians in every branch of the administration and the gradual development of self-governing institutions". Montagu and [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford|Viscount Chelmsford]], the [[Governor-General of India]], then made an extensive tour of the subcontinent in 1917 and 1918. The [[Montague–Chelmsford Report]]'s recommendations formed the basis for the [[Government of India Act of 1919]] that established "diarchy" in [[British India]]. 

Under that act, the executive was to be headed by a governor appointed by the Secretary of State, who could consult the Governor General. The governor was responsible to the Secretary of State for acts of omission and commission. He was to maintain law and order in the province and ensure that the provincial administration worked smoothly. In respect of transferred subjects, he was to be assisted by his ministers whereas reserved subjects were to be administered by the Governor General and his executive council.

The members of the Executive Council were to be appointed by Secretary of State and were responsible to him in all matters. There were certain matters that he was to administer at his own discretion, in which he was responsible to the Secretary of State. Each councillor was to remain in office for a period of four years. Their salaries and service conditions were not subject to the vote of provincial legislature. All decisions in the council were to be taken by a majority of votes, the Governor being able to break ties.

====Samoa====
{{main|Politics of Samoa}}
During the establishment of the modern state of [[Samoa]] in 1962, power was shared between the two chiefs [[Malietoa Tanumafili II]] and [[Tupua Tamasese Meaʻole]]. Meaʻole died the next year, after which the country functioned as a monarchy until the death of Tanumafili and a republic thereafter.

==Informal use==
===Informally shared power===
Owing to [[Confucianism|Confucian]] notions of [[filial piety]], Chinese and Japanese emperors were sometimes able to 'retire' but continue to exert great influence over state policy. In [[Indonesia]], [[Sukarno]] and his vice president [[Mohammad Hatta]] were nicknamed the Duumvirate (''{{lang|id|Dwitunggal}}''), with Sukarno setting government policy and rallying support and Hatta managing day-to-day administration. More recently, the great influence of [[Vladimir Putin]] over his successor [[Dmitry Medvedev]] was considered a duumvirate{{sfnp|Martin|2009}} or tandemocracy{{sfnp|Hale &amp; al.|2009}} until Putin's resumption of the office of president established him as the greater figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/daniil-kotsyubinsky/russian-politics-is-kudrin-cure-for-putin%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98tandem-malaise%E2%80%99 |contribution=Russian Politics: Is Kudrin the Cure for Putin’s ‘Tandem Malaise’? |title=Open Democracy |accessdate=6 May 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within electoral politics, governments, coalitions and parties may sometimes have two fairly equal leaders, as with:

* The temporary [[First Whitlam Ministry]] of 5–19 December 1972, composed of [[Gough Whitlam ]] and [[Lance Barnard]], which was nicknamed the "duumvirate".
* Russel Norman and Metiria Turei as joint leaders of the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand]].

===Religious leaders===
In addition to actual sharing of political power between religious and military leaders, as occurred in Tibet and Bhutan, the great [[soft power]] of a religious leader such as the [[Pope]] of the [[Catholic Church]] over a devout country can sometimes be described as a form of diarchy or corule.

===Influential outsiders===
{{main|Éminence grise}}
The status of monarchs is sometimes impugned by accusations of corule when an advisor, family member, lover, or friend appears to have taken too great a hand in government. [[Lü Buwei]] in Chinese history and [[François Leclerc du Tremblay]] in France are famous examples of "[[éminence grise|éminences grises]]" who controlled much of their countries' policies. In British history, [[George VI]]'s reign was mocked as a "split-level [[matriarchy]] in pants" owing to the supposed influence of his mother, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] and his wife [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=A Revolution in the Nursery |contribution-url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1389360/A-revolution-in-the-nursery.html |title=The Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/ }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bureaucracy===
Shared power arrangements within a modern bureaucracy may also be known as a "diarchy" or "duumvirate". Examples include the joint authority of the [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defense Force]] and the Secretary of the Department of Defense over the [[Australian Defence Organisation]].

==In fiction==
* [[Umbar]], in the works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], was ruled by a duumvirate.
*  The Omaticaya, the [[Pandoran biosphere#Naʼvi|Na'vi]] clan at the center of the film [[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]], are traditionally led by a pair of married [[tribal chief]]s. One of them, the husband, oversees political and military matters while the other one, the wife, is in charge of spiritual and otherwise ceremonial affairs.
*  The orbital colony New New York, in the ''Worlds'' trilogy by [[Joe Haldeman]], is jointly governed by an elected Policy Coordinator and Engineering Coordinator.

==See also==
* [[Directorial system]]
* [[Monarchy]], rule by a single person
* [[Coregency]], temporary rule over a monarchy by two or more people
* [[Triumvirate]], joint rule by three people
* [[Tetrarchy]], joint rule by four people
* [[Decemviri]], joint rule by ten people

Since 2004, the [[United States government#Executive branch|United States government]] has attacked thousands of targets in [[Northwest Pakistan]] using [[unmanned aerial vehicles]] (drones) operated by the [[United States Air Force]] under the operational control of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s [[Special Activities Division]].&lt;ref name="The CIA's Silent War in Pakistan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1900248,00.html|title=The CIA's Silent War in Pakistan|work=TIME|date=1 June 2009|accessdate=16 December 2011|first=Bobby|last=Ghosh|first2=Mark|last2=Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-shifts-focus-to-killing-targets/2011/08/30/gIQA7MZGvJ_story.html|title=CIA shifts focus to killing targets|first1=Greg|last1=Miller|first2=Julie|last2=Tate|date=1 September 2011|publisher=|access-date=10 December 2017|via=www.WashingtonPost.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126132531/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-shifts-focus-to-killing-targets/2011/08/30/gIQA7MZGvJ_story.html#|archive-date=26 November 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these attacks are on targets in the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] along the [[Durand Line|Afghan border]] in Northwest Pakistan.

A formerly classified Pakistani government report obtained in July 2013 by the BIJ shows details of 75 drone strikes that occurred between 2006–09.

The US government cited the inability of states to control and keep track of terrorist activities as a characteristic of a [[failed state]], represented by the lack of military and governmental control in Pakistan's [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]], and was operating within the states' right of self-defense according to Article 51 in [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter]]. In President Obama's 2013 speech at the National Defense University, he stated "we act against terrorists who pose a continuing and imminent threat to the American people, and when there are no other governments capable of effectively addressing the threat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The United States Covert War in Pakistan: Drone Strikes an Infringement on National Sovereignty|journal=Journal of Applied Environmental and Biological Sciences|year=2014|last=Khalil|first=Jehanzeb|last2=Perveen|first2=Saima|volume=4|issue=8|pages=209–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 March 2010 US State Department legal advisor [[Harold Koh]] stated that the drone strikes were legal because of the right to self-defense. According to Koh, the US is involved in an armed conflict with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their affiliates and therefore may use force consistent with self-defense under international law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Agence France-Presse]], "U.S. offers argument for drone strikes", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 28 March 2010, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Former CIA officials state that the agency uses a careful screening process in making decisions on which individuals to kill via drone strikes. The process, carried out at the agency's counterterrorist center, involves up to 10 lawyers who write briefs justifying the targeting of specific individuals. According to the former officials, if a brief's argument is weak, the request to target the individual is denied.&lt;ref name="newsweek1"&gt;McKelvey, Tara, "[http://www.newsweek.com/2011/02/13/inside-the-killing-machine.html Inside the Killing Machine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216220130/http://www.newsweek.com/2011/02/13/inside-the-killing-machine.html# |date=16 February 2011 }}", ''[[Newsweek]]'', 13 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008 the CIA has relied less on its list of individuals and increasingly targeted "signatures," or suspect behavior.

Drone critics argue that regular citizen behaviors can easily be mistaken for militant signatures.

US officials stated in March 2009 that the [[General Atomics MQ-1 Predator|Predator]] strikes had killed nine of al Qaeda's 20 top commanders. The officials added that many top Taliban and al Qaeda leaders, as a result of the strikes, had fled to [[Quetta]] or even further to [[Karachi]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanger, David E., and Eric Schmitt, "U.S. Weighs Taliban Strike Into Pakistan", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 18 March 2009, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some US politicians and academics have condemned the drone strikes. [[US Congress]]man [[Dennis Kucinich]] asserted that the United States was violating [[international law]] by carrying out strikes against a country that never attacked the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2008/09/14/top17.htm|title=US warned against sending troops to Pakistan: Congressman terms Bush's decision an election issue -DAWN – Top Stories; September&amp;nbsp;14,&amp;nbsp;2008|work=Dawn|location=Pakistan|accessdate=27 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024134553/http://www.dawn.com/2008/09/14/top17.htm#|archive-date=24 October 2010|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgetown University]] professor [[Gary D. Solis]] asserts that since the drone operators at the CIA are civilians directly engaged in armed conflict, this makes them "unlawful combatants" and possibly subject to prosecution.&lt;ref name="newsweek1"/&gt;

US military reports asserted that [[al Qaeda]] is being slowly but systematically routed because of these attacks, and that they have served to sow the seeds of uncertainty and discord among their ranks. They also claimed that the drone attacks have addled and confused the [[Taliban]], and have led them to turn against each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-pakistan-predator22-2009mar22,0,1530442,full.story U.S. missile strikes take heavy toll on al Qaeda, officials say] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324033720/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-pakistan-predator22-2009mar22,0,1530442,full.story# |date=24 March 2009 }}, [[The Los Angeles Times]], 22 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009 it was reported that (according to US officials) [[Osama Bin Laden]]'s son [[Saad bin Laden]] was believed to have been killed in a drone attack earlier in the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8164763.stm Bin Laden son 'probably killed'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726084930/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8164763.stm# |date=26 July 2009 }}, [[BBC]], 23 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Associated Press]] (AP) noted that Barack Obama apparently expanded the scope and increased the aggressiveness of the drone campaign against militants in Pakistan after taking office. According to the news agency, the US increased strikes against the Pakistani Taliban, which earned favor from the Pakistani government, resulting in increased cooperation from Pakistani intelligence services. Also, the Obama administration toned down the US government's public rhetoric against [[Islamic terrorism]], garnering better cooperation from other Islamic governments. Furthermore, with the drawdown of the war in Iraq, more drones, support personnel, and intelligence assets became available for the campaigns in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Since Obama took office, according to the AP, the number of drones operated by the CIA over Afghanistan and Pakistan doubled.&lt;ref&gt;Apuzzo, Matt, ([[Associated Press]]), "Obama strategy widens assault on Pakistani, Afghan militants", 12 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some current and former counterterrorism officials, the Obama administration's increase in the use of drone strikes is an unintended consequence of the president's executive orders banning secret CIA detention centers and his attempt to close the Guantanamo Bay prison camp, and capturing prisoners has become a "less viable option".&lt;ref&gt;Entous, Adam, [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE64H5SL20100518 "Special Report: How the White House learned to love the drone"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120225800/http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE64H5SL20100518# |date=20 January 2011 }}, ''[[Reuters]]'', 18 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia alleged that, "Their policy is to take out high-value targets, versus capturing high-value targets ( ...) They are not going to advertise that, but that's what they are doing." Obama's aides argued that it is often impossible to capture targets in the tribal areas of Pakistan and Yemen, and that other targets are in foreign custody thanks to American tips. Obama's counter-terrorism adviser, [[John O. Brennan]], said that, "The purpose of these actions is to mitigate threats to U.S. persons' lives", and continued, "It is the option of last recourse. So the president, and I think all of us here, don't like the fact that people have to die. And so he wants to make sure that we go through a rigorous checklist: The infeasibility of capture, the certainty of the intelligence base, the imminence of the threat, all of these things." In response to the concerns about the number of killings, Jeh C. Johnson stated, "We have to be vigilant to avoid a no-quarter, or take-no-prisoners policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html|title=Secret 'Kill List' Tests Obama's Principles|first1=Jo|last1=Becker|first2=Scott|last2=Shane|date=29 May 2012|publisher=|access-date=10 December 2017|via=NYTimes.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209123329/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html#|archive-date=9 December 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study called "The Year of the Drone" published in February 2010 by the [[New America Foundation]] found that from a total of 114 drone strikes in Pakistan between 2004 and early 2010, between 834 and 1,216 individuals had been killed. About two thirds of these were thought to be militants and one third were civilians.&lt;ref name="Casualties"/&gt;

On 28 April 2011, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] appointed General [[David Petraeus]] as director of the [[CIA]] overseeing the drone attacks. According to Pakistani and American officials this could further inflame relations between the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/world/29petraeus.html|work=The New York Times|first1=Jane|last1=Perlez|first2=Eric|last2=Schmitt|title=Petraeus Appointment Could Inflame Relations With Pakistan|date=28 April 2011|access-date=24 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827164139/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/world/29petraeus.html#|archive-date=27 August 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', as of September 2011, around 30 Predator and Reaper drones were operating under CIA direction in the Afghanistan/Pakistan area of operations. The drones are flown by [[United States Air Force]] pilots located at an unnamed base in the United States. US Department of Defense armed drones, which also sometimes take part in strikes on terrorist targets, are flown by US Air Force pilots located at [[Creech Air Force Base]] and [[Holloman Air Force Base]]. The CIA drones are operated by an office called the Pakistan-Afghanistan Department, which operates under the CIA's Counterterrorism Center (CTC), based at CIA's headquarters in Langley, Virginia.

At Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]]'s insistence, beginning in early 2010 staffs of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] and [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] have begun reviewing each CIA drone strike. The staff members hold monthly meetings with CIA personnel involved with the drone campaign, review videos of each strike, and attempt to confirm that the strike was executed properly.&lt;ref&gt;Dilanian, Ken, "Congress Zooms In On Drone Killings", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 25 June 2012, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the leading critics of drones in the US Congress is Senator [[Rand Paul]]. In 2013, he performed a thirteen-hour filibuster to try to achieve a public admission from U.S. President Obama that he could not kill an American citizen with a drone on American soil, who was not actively engaged in combat. Attorney General Eric Holder responded soon after, confirming that the president had no authority to use drones for this purpose.

[http://polisci.columbia.edu/people/profile/319 Eric M. Blanchard], assistant professor of Political Science at Columbia University, notes that, "the use of drones reflects several on-going historical military developments that, in turn, reflect the culture and values of American society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blanchard|first=Eric M.|title=The technoscience question in feminist IR|year=2011|publisher=Taylor and Francis Group|location=London|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, he alludes to technological idealism (the pursuit of a "decisive" technology to end war) and the need to seize the moral high ground, by delivering more "humane" approaches to warfare. Military support for the drones remains strong for a host of reasons: expansion of battlespace, extension of an individual soldiers capabilities, and a reduction of American casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blanchard|title=The technoscience question in feminist IR|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support has also been noted across the political spectrum as focus in the Middle East shifted from [[Stabilization (warfare)|stabilization]] in Afghanistan to antiterrorist strikes aimed at al-Qaeda leadership in Pakistan.

Blanchard also points to a shift in how gender is viewed in terms of warfare with the advent of technology in place of human soldiers. Fighters often represent an idealized masculinity, portraying strength, bravery, and chivalry, but during the Gulf War of 1990–91 the focus had changed. The computer programmers, missile technologists, high-tech pilots, and other servicemen who were centred around technology were now the focal point of news coverage, removing the warrior-soldier from the conversation.&lt;ref name="Blanchard 160"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blanchard|title=The technoscience question in feminist IR|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For at least some of the initial drone strikes, in 2004 and 2005, the US operated with the approval of Pakistan's ISI. Former Pakistani President [[Pervez Musharraf]] told ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in 2014 that he allowed the CIA to fly drones within Pakistan and that in exchange the US supplied helicopters and night-vision equipment to the Pakistanis. Musharraf wanted the drones to operate under Pakistani control, but the US wouldn't allow it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/24/unblinking-stare The Unblinking Stare] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141126163413/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/24/unblinking-stare# |date=26 November 2014 }} ''The New Yorker'', 24 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The daily Indian newspaper [[The Hindu]] reported that Pakistan reached a secret agreement with United States to readmit the attacks of guided airplanes on its soil.

According to The Hindu, Lieutenant General Pasha also agreed to enlarge the CIA presence in Shahbaz air base, near the city of Abbottabad, where Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden was killed in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article2929240.ece|title=In secret deal, ISI allows U.S. drone war to resume|author=The Hindu|date=25 February 2012|accessdate=25 September 2012|location=Chennai, India|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720123126/http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article2929240.ece#|archive-date=20 July 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to unnamed US government officials, beginning in early 2011 the US would fax notifications to Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] agency (ISI) detailing the dates and general areas of future drone attack operations. The ISI would send a return fax acknowledging receipt, but not approving the operation. Nevertheless, it appeared that Pakistan would clear the airspace over the area and on the dates designated in the US fax. After the May 2011 [[Death of Osama bin Laden|raid that killed bin Laden]], the ISI ceased acknowledging the US faxes, but Pakistani authorities have appeared to continue clearing the airspace in the areas where US drones are operating. According to an unnamed Pakistani government official, the Pakistan government believes that the US sends the faxes primarily to support legal justification for the drone attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Entous, Adam, "U.S. Unease Over Drone Strikes", ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 26 September 2012, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, it was reported that the US had drastically scaled back drone attacks in order to appease the Pakistani military, which was under growing pressure to move to end American "airspace violations". The CIA was instructed to be more "cautious" and limit the drone strikes to high-value targets, to cut down on so-called signature strikes (attacks that target a group of militants based purely on their behavior). Pakistani military officials had earlier stated that these drone attacks cannot continue at the tempo they are going at, and that civilian casualties in these strikes are spawning more militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US scales back drone attacks in Pakistan|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/582200/us-scales-back-drone-attacks-in-pakistan-report/|accessdate=26 July 2013|work=[[The Express Tribune]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727202926/http://tribune.com.pk/story/582200/us-scales-back-drone-attacks-in-pakistan-report/#|archive-date=27 July 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Al Qaeda response==
Messages recovered from [[Osama bin Laden]]'s home after [[Death of Osama bin Laden|his death]] in 2011, including one from then al Qaeda No. 3, [[Atiyah Abd al-Rahman]] reportedly, according to the [[Agence France-Presse]] and ''[[The Washington Post]]'', expressed frustration with the drone strikes in Pakistan. According to an unnamed U.S. government official, in his message al-Rahman complained that drone-launched missiles were killing al Qaeda operatives faster than they could be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;[[Agence France-Presse]]/[[Jiji Press]], "Bin Laden was trying to rebuild drone-decimated terror network", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 3 July 2011, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DM20110702"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2010617/Bin-Ladens-fears-Al-Qaedas-future-revealed-emails.html|title=Al Qaeda hit by credit crunch: Bin Laden emails reveal terror group is running out of cash|date=2 July 2011|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=4 July 2011|location=London|first=John|last=Stevens|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705111217/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2010617/Bin-Ladens-fears-Al-Qaedas-future-revealed-emails.html#|archive-date=5 July 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Greg, "Bin Laden Files Show Al-Qaeda Under Pressure", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 2 July 2011, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June and July 2011, law enforcement authorities found messages on al Qaeda-linked websites calling for attacks against executives of drone aircraft manufacturer [[AeroVironment]]. Law enforcement believed that the messages were in response to calls for action against Americans by [[Adam Yahiye Gadahn]].&lt;ref&gt;Winton, Richard, [http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jul/02/local/la-me-threats-20110702 "Al Qaeda-Linked Website Threatens Monrovia Company That Makes Military Drones"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705130501/http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jul/02/local/la-me-threats-20110702# |date=5 July 2011 }}, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 2 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Nations human rights concerns==
On 3 June 2009, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] (UNHRC) delivered a report sharply critical of US tactics.

On 27 October 2009 UNHRC investigator [[Philip Alston]] called on the US to demonstrate that it was not randomly killing people in violation of international law through its use of drones on the Afghan border. Alston criticized the US's refusal to respond to date to the UN's concerns. Said Alston, "Otherwise you have the really problematic bottom line, which is that the Central Intelligence Agency is running a program that is killing significant numbers of people and there is absolutely no accountability in terms of the relevant international laws."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Reuters|title=U.S. Use of Drones Queried by U.N.|work=The New York Times|date=28 October 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/28/world/28nations.html|access-date=24 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127090917/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/28/world/28nations.html#|archive-date=27 January 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 June 2010 Alston's team released a report on its investigation into the drone strikes, criticizing the United States for being "the most prolific user of [[targeted killings]]" in the world. Alston, however, acknowledged that the drone attacks may be justified under the right to self-defense. He called on the US to be more open about the program. Alston's report was submitted to the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cloud|first=David, S.|title=U.N. report faults prolific use of drone strikes by U.S.|work=Los Angeles Times|date=3 June 2010|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/03/world/la-fg-cia-drones-20100603|access-date=8 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127003617/http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/03/world/la-fg-cia-drones-20100603#|archive-date=27 January 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 2012, after a four-day visit to Pakistan, [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Navanethem Pillay|Navi Pillay]] called for a new investigation into US drone strikes in Pakistan, repeatedly referring to the attacks as "indiscriminate," and said that the attacks constitute human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UN wants investigation into drone attacks inside Pakistan|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=7 June 2012|url=http://dawn.com/2012/06/07/un-wants-investigation-into-drone-attacks-in-pakistan/|access-date=8 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608110125/http://dawn.com/2012/06/07/un-wants-investigation-into-drone-attacks-in-pakistan/#|archive-date=8 June 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a report issued on 18 June 2012, Christof Heyns, U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, called on the Obama administration to justify its use of targeted assassinations rather than attempting to capture al Qaeda or Taliban suspects.&lt;ref&gt;Nebehay, Stephanie, "U.N.

==Reactions from people in Pakistan==
According to a report by researchers at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and [[New York University]] law schools in 2012, civilians in Waziristan interviewed for the report believed "that the US actively seeks to kill them simply for being Muslims, viewing the drone campaign as a part of a religious crusade against Islam."&lt;ref name=lud&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livingunderdrones.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Stanford-NYU-Living-Under-Drones.pdf |title=Living Under Drones: Death, Injury and Trauma to Civilians from US Drone Practices in Pakistan |author1=International Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Clinic, Stanford Law School |author2=Global Justice Clinic, NYU School of Law |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6C1NZMGYJ?url=http://livingunderdrones.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Stanford_NYU_LIVING_UNDER_DRONES.pdf |date=September 2012 |archivedate=8 November 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many professionals working in Waziristan believe that drone strikes encourage terrorism.&lt;ref name=lud/&gt; The report notes similar conclusions reached by reporters for ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[CNN]].&lt;ref name=lud/&gt;

And remarkably, among those who professed to know a lot or a little about drones, 97% considered drone strikes bad policy.&lt;ref name=lud/&gt;

According to ongoing surveys of public opinion conducted by the [[New America Foundation]], 9 out of 10 of civilians in Waziristan "oppose the U.S. military pursuing al-Qaeda and the Taliban" and nearly 70% "want the Pakistani military alone to fight Taliban and al-Qaeda militants in the tribal areas."&lt;ref name=naf2&gt;{{cite web|last=Bergen|first=Peter|title=Drone Strikes: Do you support or oppose United States military drone strikes by air inside FATA today?|url=http://pakistansurvey.org/question/drone-strikes|publisher=New America Foundation|accessdate=17 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027060040/http://pakistansurvey.org/question/drone-strikes#|archive-date=27 October 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a public opinion survey conducted between November 2008 and January 2009 by the Pakistani [[Aryana Institute for Regional Research and Advocacy]], approximately half of the respondents considered drone strikes in [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] accurate and approximately the same number of respondents said that the strikes did not lead to anti-American sentiment and were effective in damaging the militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airra.org/newsandanalysis/droneattacksurvey.php |title=Aryana Institute for Regional Research and Advocacy |publisher=AIRRA |date=2009-03-05 |accessdate=2013-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807030801/http://www.airra.org/newsandanalysis/droneattacksurvey.php |archivedate=7 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers concluded that "the popular notion outside the Pakhtun belt that a large majority of the local population supports the Taliban movement lacks substance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=165781 |title=Drone attacks – a survey |accessdate=2009-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312040744/http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=165781 |archivedate=12 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, [[The News International]], 5 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to Farhat Taj a member of AIRRA the drones have never killed any civilians.

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' has reported that in North Waziristan a militant group called Khorasan Mujahedin targets people suspected of being informants.

==Civilian casualties==
{{See also|Civilian casualties from US drone strikes}}
According to unnamed counterterrorism officials, in 2009 or 2010 CIA drones began employing smaller missiles in airstrikes in Pakistan in order to reduce civilian casualties. The new missiles, called the [[Small Smart Weapon]] or Scorpion, are reportedly about the size of a violin case (21&amp;nbsp;inches long) and weigh 16&amp;nbsp;kg. The missiles are used in combination with new technology intended to increase accuracy and expand surveillance, including the use of small, unarmed surveillance drones to exactly pinpoint the location of targets. These "micro-UAVs" (unmanned aerial vehicles) can be roughly the size of a pizza platter and meant to monitor potential targets at close range, for hours or days at a time. One former U.S. official who worked with micro-UAVs said that they can be almost impossible to detect at night. "It can be outside your window and you won't hear a whisper," the official said.&lt;ref&gt;Warrick, Joby, and Peter Finn, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/25/AR2010042503114.html Amid outrage over civilian deaths in Pakistan, CIA turns to smaller missiles] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307151627/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/25/AR2010042503114.html# |date=7 March 2011 }}, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 26 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The drone operators also have changed to trying to target insurgents in vehicles rather than residences to reduce the chances of civilian casualties.&lt;ref name="The Economist"/&gt;

The New York Times reported in 2013 that the Obama Administration embraced a disputed method for counting civilian casualties, which in effect counts all military-age males in a strike zone as combatants, giving partial explanation to the official claims of extraordinarily low collateral deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Secret 'Kill List' Proves a Test of Obama's Principles and Will|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=29 May 2012|first1=Jo|last1=Becker|first2=Scott|last2=Shane|access-date=24 February 2017|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BhOaw6G3?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all#|archive-date=26 October 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 2011 report by ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'' stated that civilian casualties in the strikes had apparently decreased. According to the report, the U.S. government believed that 1,300 militants and only 30 civilians had been killed in drone strikes since mid-2008, with no civilians killed since August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Capaccio, Tony, and Jeff Bliss, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20110203225155/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-31/u-s-said-to-reduce-civilian-deaths-after-increasing-cia-pakistan-strikes.html U.S. Said to Reduce Civilian Deaths After Increasing CIA Pakistan Strikes]", ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'', 31 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 July 2009, Daniel L. Byman of the [[Brookings Institution]] stated that although accurate data on the results of drone strikes is difficult to obtain, it seemed that ten civilians had died in the drone attacks for every militant killed. Byman argues that civilian killings constitute a humanitarian tragedy and create dangerous political problems, including damage to the legitimacy of the Pakistani government and alienation of the Pakistani populace from America. He suggested that the real answer to halting al-Qaeda's activity in Pakistan will be long-term support of Pakistan's [[counterinsurgency]] efforts.&lt;ref name="brookings1"/&gt;

United States officials claim that interviews with locals do not provide accurate numbers of civilian casualties because relatives or acquaintances of the dead refuse to state that the victims were involved in militant activities.&lt;ref name="latimes9"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dilanian|first=Ken|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-drone-strikes-20110222,0,5033756.story|title=CIA drones may be avoiding Pakistani civilians|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=22 February 2011|accessdate=1 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303053840/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-drone-strikes-20110222,0,5033756.story#|archive-date=3 March 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIA reportedly passed up three chances to kill militant leaders, including [[Sirajuddin Haqqani]], with drone missiles in 2010 because women and children were nearby. The [[New America Foundation]] believes that between zero and 18 civilians have been killed in drone strikes since 23 August 2010 and that overall civilian casualties have decreased from 25% of the total in prior years to an estimated of 6% in 2010. The Foundation estimates that between 277 and 435 non-combatants have died since 2004, out of 1,374 to 2,189 total deaths.&lt;ref name="latimes9"/&gt;

According to a report of the Islamabad-based Conflict Monitoring Center (CMC), as of 2011 more than 2000 persons have been killed, and most of those deaths were civilians. The CMC termed the CIA drone strikes as an "assassination campaign turning out to be revenge campaign", and showed that 2010 was the deadliest year so far regarding casualties resulting from drone attacks, with 134 strikes inflicting over 900 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=4731&amp;Cat=13&amp;dt=19|title=Army trying to cover up bad deal on Davis|publisher=thenews.com.pk|date=19 March 2011|accessdate=19 May 2011}}{{Dead link|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Long War Journal]]'', as of mid-2011, the drone strikes in Pakistan since 2006 had killed 2,018 militants and 138 civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Roggio, Bill, and Alexander Mayer, "[http://www.longwarjournal.org/pakistan-strikes.php Charting the data for US airstrikes in Pakistan, 2004 – 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218080812/http://www.longwarjournal.org/pakistan-strikes.php |date=18 February 2015 }} ", ''[[Long War Journal]]'', 5 July 2011. Retrieved 11 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New America Foundation]] stated in mid-2011 that from 2004 to 2011, 80% of the 2,551 people killed in the strikes were militants. The Foundation stated that 95% of those killed in 2010 were militants and that, as of 2012, 15% of the total people killed by drone strikes were either civilians or unknown.&lt;ref name="The Economist"/&gt; The foundation also states that in 2012 the rate of civilian and unknown casualties was 2 percent, whereas the [[Bureau of Investigative Journalism]] say the rate of civilian casualties for 2012 is 9 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121104052227/http://afpak.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/02/counting_civilian_casualties_in_cia_s_drone_war Counting civilian casualties in CIA's drone war], Foreign Policy&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bureau of Investigative Journalism]], based on extensive research in mid-2011, claims that at least 385 civilians were among the dead, including more than 160 children.&lt;ref name="thebureauinvestigates.com"/&gt;

The CIA has claimed that the strikes conducted between May 2010 and August 2011 killed over 600 militants and did not result in any civilian fatalities; this assessment has been criticized by [[Bill Roggio]] from the ''Long War Journal'' and other commentators as being unrealistic. Unnamed American officials who spoke to ''The New York Times'' claimed that, as of August 2011, the drone campaign had killed over 2,000 militants and approximately 50 non-combatants.&lt;ref name="C.I.A. Is Disputed"/&gt;

An independent research site ''Pakistan Body Count'' run by Dr. Zeeshan-ul-hassan, a Fulbright scholar keeping track of all the drone attacks, claims that 2179 civilians were among the dead, and 12.4% children and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pakistanbodycount.org/drone_attack|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712090312/http://pakistanbodycount.org/drone_attack|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-12|title=Drone Attacks in Pakistan|publisher=PakistanBodyCount.org|date=|accessdate=2013-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by the [[Bureau of Investigative Journalism]], released 4 February 2012, stated that under the Obama administration (2008–2011) drone strikes killed between 282 and 535 civilians, including 60 children.&lt;ref name="Lamb, Christina 2012, page 28"&gt;Lamb, Christina, Chris Woods, and Rahimullah Yusufzai, "Covert CIA Drones Kill Hundreds Of Civilians", ''[[London Sunday Times]]'', 5 February 2012, page 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British human rights group [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] filed a case with the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], based on [[affidavit]]s by 18 family members of civilians killed in the attacks – many of them children. They are calling on the UNHRC "to condemn the attacks as illegal human rights violations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reprieve.org.uk/media/downloads/2012_02_22_PUB_drones_UN_HRC_complaint.pdf |title=COMPLAINT AGAINST THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FOR THE KILLING OF INNOCENT CITIZENS OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN |format=PDF |date=22 February 2012 |accessdate=25 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910131815/http://reprieve.org.uk/media/downloads/2012_02_22_PUB_drones_UN_HRC_complaint.pdf |archivedate=10 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A February 2012 [[Associated Press]] investigation found that militants were the main victims of drone strikes in [[North Waziristan]] contrary to the "widespread perception in Pakistan that civilians ( ...) are the principal victims." The AP studied 10 drone strikes. Their reporters spoke to about 80 villagers in North Waziristan, and were told that at least 194 people died in the ten attacks. According to the villagers 56 of those were either civilians or tribal police and 138 were militants. Thirty-eight of the civilians died in a single attack on 17 March 2011. Villagers stated that one way to tell if civilians were killed was to observe how many funerals took place after a strike; the bodies of militants were usually taken elsewhere for burial, while civilians were usually buried immediately and locally.&lt;ref&gt;Abbot, Sebastian, [[Associated Press]], [http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2012/02/26/20120226study-drone-strikes.html "Study: Militants, Not Civilians, Are Primary Victims Of Drone Strikes"], ''[[Arizona Republic]]'', 26 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A September 2012 report by researchers from [[Stanford University]] and [[New York University]] criticized the drone campaign, stating that it was killing a high number of civilians and turning the Pakistani public against the United States. The report, compiled by interviewing witnesses, drone-attack survivors, and others in Pakistan provided by a Pakistani human rights organization, Foundation for Fundamental Rights, concluded that only 2% of drone strike victims are "high-level" militant leaders. The report's authors did not estimate the numbers of total civilian casualties, but suggested that the February 2012 Bureau of Investigative Journalism report was more accurate than the ''Long War Journal'' report (both detailed above) on civilian casualties. The report also opined that the drone attacks were violations of international law, because the US government had not shown that the targets were direct threats to the US.&lt;ref&gt;Zucchino, David, "Study Slams Drone Use In Pakistan", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 25 September 2012, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; The report further noted the US policy of considering all military-age males in a strike zone as militants following the air strike unless exonerating evidence proves otherwise. Media outlets were also urged to cease using the term "militant" when reporting on drone attacks without further explanation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://livingunderdrones.org/ Living under Drones] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012043923/http://livingunderdrones.org/ |date=12 October 2012 }}.

According to a 2018 study in the journal ''[[International Security (journal)|International Security]]'', there is scant evidence that drone strikes in Pakistan radicalize at the local, national or transnational level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shah|first=Aqil|date=2018|title=Do U.S. Drone Strikes Cause Blowback?

According to a 2016 study in ''[[International Studies Quarterly]]'', drone strikes are an effective counterterrorist tool in Pakistan.

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] defines the '''[[employment]] rate''' as the '''employment-to-population ratio'''.
This is a statistical [[ratio]] that measures the proportion of the country's [[working age]] population (statistics are often given for ages 15 to 64&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=LFS_SEXAGE_I_R#|title=LFS by sex and age – indicators|first=|last=OECD|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Employment_rates_for_selected_population_groups,_2004%E2%80%9314_(%25)_YB16.png|title=File:Employment rates for selected population groups, 2004–14 (%) YB16.png – Statistics Explained|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that is employed.

== Background ==
The employment-population ratio has not always been looked at for labor statistics and where specific areas are economically, but after the recent recession it has been given more attention worldwide, especially by economists.  The National Bureau Of Economic Research ([[NBER]]) states that the [[Great Recession]] ended in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Employment/Population Ratios for the 50 Largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas:
     2008, 2009, and 2010. (2011, September). Retrieved December 10, 2012, from
     United States Census Bureau website: https://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/
     acsbr10-09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  During 2009 and 2010, however, many areas were still struggling economically, which is the reason the employment-population ratio is still used by both Americans and people around the world.

== Key definitions ==
[[File:US Employment Statistics - March 2015.png|thumb|upright=1.6|right|U.S. employment statistics and ratios for March 2015]]
Key terms that explain the use of the ratio follow:

'''Employed persons.'''   All those who, (1) do any work at all as paid employees, work in their own business or profession or on their own farm, or work 15 hours or more as unpaid workers in a family-operated enterprise; and (2) all those who do not work but had jobs or businesses from which they were temporarily absent due to illness, bad weather, vacation, childcare problems, labor dispute, maternity or paternity leave, or other family or personal obligations—whether or not they were paid by their employers for the time off and whether or not they were seeking other jobs.

'''Unemployed persons.'''  All those who, (1) have no employment during the reference week; (2) are available for work, except for temporary illness; and (3) have made specific efforts, such as contacting employers, to find employment sometime during the past 4-week period.

'''Participant rate'''  This represents the proportion of the population that is in the [[labor force]].

'''Not in the labor force.'''  Included in this group are all persons in the [[civilian noninstitutional population]] who are neither employed nor unemployed. Information is collected on their desire for and availability to take a job at the time of the CPS interview, jobsearch activity in the prior year, and reason for not looking for work in past 4-week period.

'''Multiple jobholders.'''  These are employed persons who, have two or more jobs as a wage and salary worker, are self-employed and also held a wage and salary job, or work as an unpaid family worker and also hold a wage and salary job.

&lt;ref&gt;BLS Handbook Of Methods. (2003, April 17). Retrieved December 6, 2012, from
     Bureau Of Labor Statistics website: http://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/
     homch1_c.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
The ratio is used to evaluate the ability of the economy to create jobs and therefore is used in conjunction with the [[unemployment rate]] for a general evaluation of the labour market stance. Having a high ratio means that an important proportion of the population in working age is employed, which in general will have positive effects on the [[GDP per capita]]. Nevertheless, the ratio does not give an indication of working conditions, number of hours worked per person, earnings or the size of the [[black market]]. Therefore, the analysis of the labour market must be done in conjunction with other statistics.

This measure comes from dividing the civilian [[civilian noninstitutional population|noninstitutionalized]] population who are employed by the total noninstitutionalized population and multiplying by 100.&lt;ref&gt;Employment/Population Ratios for the 50 Largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas:
     2008, 2009, and 2010. (2011, September). Retrieved December 10, 2012, from
     United States Census Bureau website: https://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/
     acsbr10-09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Employment-to-population ratio in the world ==
{{see also|List of countries by employment rate}}

In general, a high ratio is considered to be above 70 percent of the working-age population whereas a ratio below 50 percent is considered to be low. The economies with low ratios are generally situated in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]].

Employment-to-population ratios are typically higher for men than for women. Nevertheless, in the past decades, the ratios tended to fall for men and increase in the case of women, which made the differences between both to be reduced.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35054">A '''cyber fusion''' is an intelligence gathering, analysis and dissemination state or major urban area center, which is owned by state, local, and territorial law enforcement and Department of Homeland Security entities, many of which were jointly created between 2003 and 2007 under the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] and the Office of Justice Programs in the [[U.S. Department of Justice]].

They are designed to promote information sharing at the federal level between agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the  U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of Justice, and state, local, and tribal law enforcement. {{As of|February 2018}}, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security recognized 79 fusion centers.&lt;ref name="US DHS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Advancing the Homeland Security Information Sharing Environment: A Review of the National Network of Fusion Centers|url=https://homeland.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Committee-on-Homeland-Security-Fusion-Center-Report.pdf|publisher=House Homeland Security Committee}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fusion centers may also be affiliated with an [[Emergency Operations Center]] that responds in the event of a disaster.

The National Network of Fusion Centers was established after the September 11 attacks to provide a focal point for successful collaboration across jurisdictions and sectors to effectively and efficiently detect, prevent, investigate, and respond to criminal and terrorist activity. It is a decentralized, distributed, self-organizing national asset composed of state and major urban area fusion centers and their respective nodes within each center's area of responsibility (AoR). This composition enables the National Network to meet local needs, while providing value information to understand the national landscape of threats and criminal activity.

The fusion process is an overarching method of managing the flow of information and intelligence across levels and sectors of government to integrate information for analysis.[[Fusion center#cite note-Carter, D. L. 2009-1|&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] That is, the process relies on the active involvement of state, local, tribal, and federal law enforcement agencies—and sometimes on non-law enforcement agencies (e.g., private sector)—to provide the input of raw information for intelligence analysis. As the array of diverse information sources increases, there will be more accurate and robust analysis that can be disseminated as intelligence.

A report by the House Homeland Security Committee titled "Advancing the Homeland Security Information Sharing Environment: A Review of the National Network of Fusion Centers" that was published in November 2017 had overwhelming amounts of positive feedback on the accomplishments and improvement of the network since their last review in 2013, in addition to several recommendations for future improvement in operations and collaboration. It highlights in particular the strides federal partners, namely the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]], and Fusion Centers have made in sharing critical information and data across several platforms. The chairman of the committee U.S. Representative Michael McCaul was quoted in the report as stating: 

{{blockquote|Fusion centers are a key element of our homeland security because they improve partnerships at the state, local, and federal levels and help ensure better coordination of vital counterterrorism information. As threats to our homeland continue to evolve, we must take the necessary steps to mitigate gaps in threat-sharing and reporting. This latest report includes 24 recommendations that promote the sustained growth of the National Network of fusion centers and more fully integrate front-line law enforcement, first responders, and our intelligence community, contributing to a more robust national infrastructure to defend against the threat landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee Releases Report On the National Network of Fusion Centers and Information Sharing – House Committee on Homeland Security|url=https://homeland.house.gov/press/committee-releases-report-national-network-fusion-centers-information-sharing/|publisher=House Committee on Homeland Security|date=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Fusion process==
The fusion process proactively seeks to identify perceived threats and stop them before they occur. A fusion center is typically organized by amalgamating representatives from different federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies into one physical location. However, some fusion centers gather information not only from government sources, but also from their partners in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Monahan, T. | year = 2009 | title = The Murky World of 'Fusion Centres' | journal = Criminal Justice Matters | volume = 75 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–21 | url = http://publicsurveillance.com/papers/FC-CJM.pdf | format = pdf | doi=10.1080/09627250802699715}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bob"&gt;{{ cite web | last = Harwood | first = M. | url = http://www.securitymanagement.com/article/smashing-intelligence-stovepipes?page=0%2C1 | title = Smashing Intelligence Stovepipes | publisher = Security Management | date =  | accessdate = 2012-07-13 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429084443/http://www.securitymanagement.com/article/smashing-intelligence-stovepipes?page=0%2C1 | archivedate = 2011-04-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each representative is intended to be a conduit of raw information from his or her agency, a representative who can infuse that agency-specific information into the collective body of information for analysis. Conversely, when the fusion center needs intelligence requirements the representative is the conduit back to the agency to communicate, monitor, and process the new information needs.&lt;ref name="Carter, D. L. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Carter, D. L.|author2=Carter, J. G.|year=2009|title=The Intelligence Fusion Process for State, Local and Tribal Law Enforcement|journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior|volume=36|issue=12|pages=1323–1339|doi=10.1177/0093854809345674}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the agency representative ensures that analytic products and threat information are directed back to one's home agency for proper dissemination. According to the fusion center guidelines, a fusion center is defined as "a collaborative effort of two or more agencies that provide resources, expertise, and/or information to the center with the goal of maximizing the ability to detect, prevent, apprehend, and respond to criminal and terrorist activity. The intelligence component of a fusion center focuses on the intelligence process, where information is collected, integrated, evaluated, analyzed, and disseminated. Nontraditional collectors of intelligence, such as public safety entities and private sector organizations, possess important information that can be fused' with law enforcement data to provide meaningful information and intelligence about threats and criminal activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://it.ojp.gov/documents/fusion_center_guidelines_law_enforcement.pdf | title = Global Intelligence Working Group, 2005a, p. 8 | format = pdf | date = | accessdate = 2012-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

State and local police departments provide both space and resources for the majority of fusion centers. The analysts working there can be drawn from a range of agencies and organizations, including DHS, FBI, Customs and Border Protection, Drug Enforcement Administration, Coast Guard, National Guard, Highway Patrol, state-level Departments of Corrections, local police, and the private sector.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Monahan, T. |author2=Regan, Priscilla M. |title= Zones of Opacity: Data Fusion in Post 9/11 Security Organizations | journal= Canadian Journal of Law and Society |year=2012 |volume= 27 |issue=3 |pages= 301–317 |url = http://publicsurveillance.com/papers/Zones-of-Opacity.pdf |format= pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of fusion centers operate tip hotlines and also invite relevant information from public employees, such as sanitation workers or firefighters.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1b"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Monahan, T. |last2=Palmer, N.A. |title= The Emerging Politics of DHS Fusion Centers |journal= Security Dialogue | year = 2009 |volume= 40 |issue=6 |pages= 617–636 |url= http://publicsurveillance.com/papers/FC-SD.pdf |format= pdf | doi= 10.1177/0967010609350314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The National Fusion Center Association==
The NFCA is an association that represents all of the fusion centers located across the country that make up the National Network. It is headed by an Executive board composed of a President, Vice President, Executive Director, Treasurer, Secretary, and two regional co-chairs that represent Fusion Centers from the North East, South East, Central, and West regions of the country. The mission of the NFCA is as follows:

"To represent the interests of state and major urban area fusion centers, as well as associated interests of states, tribal nations, and units of local government, in order to promote the development and sustainment of fusion centers to enhance public safety; encourage effective, efficient, ethical, lawful, and professional intelligence and information sharing; and prevent and reduce the harmful effects of crime and terrorism on victims, individuals, and communities."

Below are the overarching goals of the NFCA in their support of the National Network, and clearly define their existence as an association.
* Provide an independent and consolidated voice for state and major urban area fusion centers;
* Maintain the focus of state, tribal, local, and federal governments on the needs of the fusion centers;
* Represent fusion center concerns to the federal government through an education process;
* Provide support for the development of effective fusion center policy for the nation's state and local government elected officials and tribal leaders;
* Serve as a catalyst for the careful consideration and promotion of effective and efficient fusion center policies and practices;
* Advocate for the commitment of adequate resources to support a national, integrated network of state and major urban area fusion centers; and
* Coordinate between and among the different branches and levels of government and promote broad philosophical agreement.
The NFCA have their own website located at www.nfcausa.org, which contains contact information for each of the 79 Fusion centers, a tool to submit a Suspicious Activity Report, and general news on the works of Fusion Centers across the country.

===NFCA Annual Training Event===
The NFCA hosts an annual training event in Alexandria Virginia. Over 700 fusion center employees, federal and local partners come together to share innovative ideas and business practices for the purpose of enhancing fusion center capabilities and the National Network's contribution to public safety.  The conference agenda consists of numerous breakout sessions, presentations and briefings on several topics related to public safety challenges and the domestic terrorism threat picture.  Experts from around the country provide outstanding, in-depth instruction on a wide variety of topics to included cyber security, domestic terrorism, federal partner collaboration, private sector engagement, and social media monitoring. The event will also feature several keynote speakers from Federal Entities. Speakers in the past have included FBI director James Comey, former acting Secretary of DHS Elaine Duke, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

===History of the Fusion Center Concept===
The fusion center concept was created as a result of the September 11 report, in an attempt by the Department of Homeland Security to create better communication and cooperation between state, local, and territorial law enforcement with federal law enforcement entities including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Homeland Security and several others.  With domestic and foreign threats constantly changing, the strategies used by each Fusion Center have to be defined, and altered, which calls for a specific plans and guidelines as to how to best protect the homeland. The National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding, as well as The National Strategy for Information Sharing are two documents that influenced the workings of the Fusion Center network, and defined a broad strategy for a more proactive information sharing network. The NFCA alongside several other federal and local law enforcement associations formulated the "Baseline Capabilities for State and Major Fusion Centers" as well as the "National Strategy for the National Network of Fusion Centers" are documents that defined a clear understanding of the role of Fusion Centers as well as time sensitive goals they should achieve. The National Strategy is constantly being developed as time passes to meet the needs of the changing environment of national security. Additionally, a "Cyber Appendix" was added to the Baseline Capabilities document, that defines the roles and operational capabilites of Fusion Centers to fight cyber crime that effects their areas of responsibility.

==Success Stories==
Due to the nature of their work, Fusion Centers have been key cogs in the response to of many of America's most devastating tragedies. In the past several years, work done by Fusion Centers has resulted in several success stories where hundreds of lives were saved, and the damage has been mitigated on several operational levels.

===Hurricane Irma===
Hurricane Irma was hit several of the Islands off the coast of the U.S.A., including the Virgin Islands. A couple from Falls Church, Virginia had been trapped in their vacation home near St. John due to damage from the hurricane. They had no means to escape their island, no electricity, and a limited amount of water. After their daughter found a video that a pilot had taken from above the island, she noticed the landslide that had trapped her parents in their home. She reached out to congressmen, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Red Cross, but the resources were not available to provide any assistance. Executive Director of the National Fusion Center Association Glenn Archer was alerted of the family's situation, and reached out to the Fusion Center in the Virgin Islands, and after working through the night the Director of the Virgin Islands Fusion Center was able to locate the couple and deploy an FBI SWAT team to their location. The operation was successful, and the couple was able to return to Virginia and be reunited with their daughter. At the time of the rescue, the couple had been trapped for 7 days, and had run out of potable water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wjla.com/features/7-on-your-side/7-on-your-side-va-couple-stranded-on-st-john-by-hurricane-irma-gets-help-after-7-days|title=Va. couple stranded on St. John by Hurricane Irma surprised, rescued after 7 days|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex Trafficking Arrest===
As a result of information sharing by the Central Florida Intelligence Exchange (CFIX), Louisiana State Analytic and Fusion Exchange (LA-SAFE), and the Orange County Intelligence Assessment Center (OCIAC), three adults were arrested in June 2014 on charges of sex trafficking, an insidious form of human trafficking that has the potential to victimize an estimated 300,000 at-risk children each year in the United States alone.

Extensive information sharing, leading to arrests and convictions, began when Florida's Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation (MBI), a regional task force including representatives from ICE and FBI, initiated an investigation involving a vulnerable runaway minor from Orlando. According to investigative reports, three adults recruited the minor to work as a prostitute in five different US cities – three in Louisiana and two in California. The MBI notified the CFIX about the sex trafficking investigation, and, because the case crossed state lines, the CFIX subsequently teamed up with the LA-SAFE and OCIAC to support the MBI investigation.

Working across the National Network of Fusion Centers, the CFIX, LA-SAFE and the OCIAC leveraged their vast information access and sharing capabilities to quickly obtain and disseminate key investigative information to MBI and local law enforcement partners. Through the extensive collaboration between fusion centers and law enforcement, all three suspects were identified and convicted, with the ringleader receiving a 30 year sentence in February 2015.  These results demonstrate the indispensable role of fusion centers in supporting multi-state criminal investigations.

==HHSC Report on National Network of Fusion Centers==
A report by the House Homeland Security Committee titled "Advancing the Homeland Security Information Sharing Environment: A Review of the National Network of Fusion Centers" that was published in November 2017 had overwhelming amounts of positive feedback on the accomplishments and improvement of the network since their last review in 2013, in addition to several recommendations for future improvement in operations and collaboration. Additionally, it addresses the new challenges that will arise in the form of different areas of crime, and how Fusion Centers should address those challenges so that they can continue to effectively analyze intelligence and distribute it to the necessary parties involved.

The report highlights in particular the strides federal partners, namely the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]], and Fusion Centers have made in sharing critical information and data across several platforms. The report details that since the release of the Committee's 2013 report, significant progress has been made in the overall maturity of the National Network of Fusion Centers. They state that many fusion centers have expanded capabilities to address all crimes and threats by recognizing that early indicators of terrorism often include criminal activity. The Committee claims they witnessed greater intra-network collaboration, including the exchange of best practices, collaboration on strategic products, and provision of support to other centers during major incidents. Additionally, they discuss how fusion centers are embracing a multidisciplinary approach to outreach programs to better integrate fire, emergency medical services, and the private sector. Finally, the Committee also received significant feedback on the value of the Department of Homeland Security's Homeland Security Information Network to fusion center operations and the importance of continuing to update and expand the system to meet emerging needs.&lt;ref name="US DHS"/&gt;

==Common Misconceptions==
There are often misconceptions about the function of fusion centers. The most common misconception is that the center consists of a large room full of work stations where the staff are constantly responding to inquiries from officers, investigators, and agents. This vision is more accurately a watch center or an investigative support center—not an intelligence fusion center. Fusion Centers have the responsibility of proactively gathering intelligence, analyzing that information, and then disseminating it to their local, state and federal partners.

Another common misconception is that the fusion center is minimally staffed until there is some type of crisis whereupon representatives from different public safety agencies converge in staff workstations to manage the crisis. This staffing model more accurately describes an emergency operations center, not an intelligence fusion center. The fusion center is not an operational center but a support center driven by analysis.&lt;ref name="Carter, D. L. 2009" /&gt;

==Criticism==
There are a number of documented criticisms of fusion centers, including relative ineffectiveness at counterterrorism activities, the potential to be used for secondary purposes unrelated to counterterrorism, and their links to violations of civil liberties of American citizens and others.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1b"/&gt; One such fusion center has been involved with spying on anti-war and peace activists as well as [[anarchists]] in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington state]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.democracynow.org/2009/7/28/broadcast_exclusive_declassified_docs_reveal_military Report on Fusion Centers]". Democracynow.org. July 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

David Rittgers of the [[Cato Institute]] has noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;a long line of fusion center and DHS reports labeling broad swaths of the public as a threat to national security. The North Texas Fusion System labeled [[Islam|Muslim]] lobbyists as a potential threat; a DHS analyst in Wisconsin thought both pro- and anti-abortion activists were worrisome; a Pennsylvania homeland security contractor watched environmental activists, [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] groups, and a [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] rally; the Maryland State Police put anti-death penalty and anti-war activists in a federal terrorism database; a fusion center in Missouri thought that all [[Third party (United States)|third-party]] voters and [[Ron Paul]] supporters were a threat; and the Department of Homeland Security described half of the American political spectrum as "[[right wing]] extremists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rittgers|first=David|title=We're All Terrorists Now|url=http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/we%E2%80%99re-all-terrorists-now/|publisher=[[Cato Institute]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415064139/http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/we%E2%80%99re-all-terrorists-now/|archivedate=2011-04-15|date=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 2007 [[ACLU]] report raised concerns with four areas of fusion center aspects, the first of which was that they suffered from "ambiguous lines of authority", meaning that the fusion process "allows the authorities to manipulate differences in federal, state and local laws to maximize information collection while evading accountability and oversight through the practice of 'policy shopping'." The ACLU was also concerned with the private sector and military participation in the surveillance of US citizens through these fusion centers. Finally, the ACLU report argued that fusion centers were likely to engage in poorly contained [[data mining]] because the "Federal fusion center guidelines encourage wholesale data collection and manipulation processes that threaten privacy" and that the centers were "hobbled by excessive secrecy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/report/whats-wrong-fusion-centers-executive-summary|title=What's Wrong With Fusion Centers – Executive Summary|website=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An updated ACLU report in 2008 argued that the fusion centers were creating a "total [[surveillance society]]" in the US.&lt;ref&gt;ACLU Highlights Risk of "Fusion Centers", ''[[The Progressive]]'', www.progressive.org/mag/mc073008a.html&lt;/ref&gt; An ACLU spokesperson compared the fusion centers initiative with [[Operation TIPS]] because of the involvement of private [[Terrorism Liaison Officer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;The New Snoops: Terrorism Liaison Officers, Some from Private Sector, ''The Progressive'', www.progressive.org/mag/mc070208&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Department of Homeland Security]]:&lt;ref&gt;Privacy Impact Assessment for the Department of Homeland Security State, Local, and Regional Fusion Center Initiative December 11, 2008 [https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/privacy/privacy_pia_ia_slrfci.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he [[Privacy Office of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security|Privacy Office]] has identified a number of risks to privacy presented by the fusion center program:
# Justification for fusion centers
# Ambiguous Lines of Authority, Rules, and Oversight
# Participation of the Military and the Private Sector
# [[Data Mining]]
# [[Secrecy|Excessive Secrecy]]
# Inaccurate or [[incomplete information]]
# [[Mission Creep]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Senate report===
The [[United States Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]] report said:&lt;ref name="fp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/10/03/senate_report_says_national_intelligence_fusion_centers_have_been_useless|title=Senate Report Says National Intelligence Fusion Centers Have Been Useless|publisher=Foreign Policy|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Despite reviewing 13 months' worth of reporting originating from fusion centers from April 1, 2009 to April 30, 2010, the Subcommittee investigation could identify no reporting which uncovered a terrorist threat, nor could it identify a contribution such fusion center reporting made to disrupt an active terrorist plot.}}

An example of useless intelligence highlighted by the committee was a report on a foreigner with an [[expired visa]] who had been caught [[speeding]] and [[shoplifting]]; his name was promptly added to the list of "known or appropriately suspected" terrorists. A reviewer of that report intimated: "I am actually stunned this report got as far as it did," because "the entire total knowledge about the subject" was that he "tried to steal a pair of shoes from [[Neiman Marcus]]" with everything else in the report being commentary. The reviewer concluded: "I have no idea what value this would be adding to the IC [Intelligence Community]."&lt;ref name="rt" /&gt;

Another example highlighted in the Senate report was entitled "Possible Drug Smuggling Activity".  It detailed how two state wildlife officials saw two fishermen in a [[bass boat]] "operating suspiciously" in waters off the [[US–Mexico border]]. The fusion center report listed as suspicions activities the fact that the two suspects "avoided eye contact" and that their boat was low in the water, "as if it were laden with cargo". The DHS reviewer wrote that: "The fact that some guys were hanging out in a boat where people normally do not fish MIGHT be an indicator of something abnormal, but does not reach the threshold of something we should be reporting," and "that this should never have been nominated for production, nor passed through three reviews."&lt;ref name="nbc" /&gt;

Yet another example was a California fusion center report on the [[Mongols Motorcycle Club]]'s distribution of leaflets to its members instructing them how to behave when stopped by police. According to the Senate report, the leaflet suggested to the Club members that they should be courteous, control their emotions and, if drinking, have a designated driver. One supervisor eventually killed the fusion center report, noting that "There is nothing illegal or even remotely objectionable [described] in this report," and that "The advice given to the groups' members is protected by the First Amendment."&lt;ref name="wp" /&gt;

Part of the problems identified by the Senate report is that the DHS [[DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis|Office of Intelligence and Analysis]] imposed a [[Production quota|quota]] of reports to be filed by the fusion centers, leading to diminished quality.&lt;ref name="wp"&gt;Robert O'Harrow, Jr. [https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-10-02/news/35500769_1_fusion-centers-investigators-report "DHS 'fusion centers' portrayed as pools of ineptitude, civil liberties intrusions"], ''The Washington Post'', October 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate committee estimated that about $1.4 billion had been spent on the fusion centers.&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/usa/intelligence-fusion-dhs-report-598/|title=Homeland Security gathers 'crap intelligence' and spies on Americans|website=Rt.com|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also estimated that:&lt;ref name="rt" /&gt;

{{quote|Of the 386 unclassified [[Homeland Intelligence Report|HIRs]] that DHS eventually published over the 13-month period reviewed by the Subcommittee investigation, a review found close to 300 of them had no discernable connection to terrorists, terrorist plots or threats.}}

[[Matthew Chandler (spokesperson)|Matthew Chandler]], a spokesperson for the DHS, immediately denounced the Senate report in an interview with [[Fox News]], in which he said that "In preparing the report, the committee refused to review relevant data, including important intelligence information pertinent to their findings," and that the "report fundamentally misunderstands the role of the federal government in supporting fusion centers and overlooks the significant benefits of this relationship to both state and local law enforcement and the federal government."&lt;ref name="rt" /&gt;

Interviewed about the Senate report, [[Michael Leiter]], former Director of the [[National Counterterrorism Center]], stated that: "Since 9/11, the growth of state and local fusion centers has been exponential and regrettably in many instances it has produced an ill-planned mishmash rather than a true national system that is well-integrated with existing organizations like the FBI-led [[Joint Terrorism Task Force]]s."&lt;ref name="nbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/02/14187433-homeland-security-fusion-centers-spy-on-citizens-produce-shoddy-work-report-says|title=Homeland Security 'fusion' centers spy on citizens, produce 'shoddy' work, report says|first=|last=Investigations|website=Investigations.nbcnews.com|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 Virginia terrorism threat assessment===
In early April 2009, the Virginia Fusion Center came under criticism for publishing a terrorism [[threat assessment]] which stated that certain universities are potential hubs for terror related activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rawstory.com/news/2008/Virginia_terror_assessment_targets_enormous_crosssection_0406.html |title=Fusion center declares nation's oldest universities possible terror threat |publisher=The Raw Story |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report targeted [[historically black colleges]] and identified [[hacktivism]] as a form of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rawstory.com/images/other/vafusioncenterterrorassessment.pdf 2009 Virginia Terrorism threat assessment].

===2011 Illinois fusion center finds water pump was "hacked"; the FBI disagrees===
{{expand section|date=June 2013}}
A November 2011 report by the Illinois fusion center was criticized for alleging that [[Russia]] [[hacker (computer security)|hacked]] and deliberately disabled a water pump of the [[municipal water system]] in Illinois. The Senate report writes: "Apparently aware of how important such an event could have been had it been real, DHS intelligence officials included the false allegations—stated as fact—in a daily intelligence briefing that went to Congress and the intelligence community." A subsequent FBI investigation found however that: "The only fact that they got right was that a water pump in a small Illinois water district had burned out."&lt;ref name="fp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/10/dhs-false-water-pump-hack/ | work=Wired | first=Kim | last=Zetter | title=DHS Issued False 'Water Pump Hack' Report; Called It a 'Success' | date=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Garden of Peace''' in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], is a memorial commemorating victims of homicide and a living reminder of the impact of violence. It is a visual testament to the need for eliminating violence. The Garden of Peace,  is a memorial to [[homicide]] victims. It is a symbol of hope for peace and renewal in our lives, our community, and the world.

The central feature of the memorial is a dry streambed containing smooth river stones engraved with the names of victims of homicide. The stream flows from a large, granite lens, "Tragic Density," that symbolizes the enormous weight of sadness and grief experienced and endured by the survivors. The streambed moves through the Garden and culminates in a cascade of water into a pool out of which rises "Ibis Ascending", a skyward sculpture representing hope. The seat walls throughout the Garden, also engraved with victims' names, offer a place to sit and reflect.

It is a special place where families, friends, and the greater community can remember and celebrate the lives of those taken by violence.

The Garden of Peace encourages change by raising awareness and by serving as an anti-violence educational tool. Local and statewide violence prevention and community-building organizations are welcome and incorporate visits to the Garden into their educational programs. Visitors to Boston are invited to enjoy the beauty of the Garden's park-like setting and to make the experience of the site part of their visit to historic Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb| title = The Garden Of Peace Memorial| accessdate = 2007-11-21 |url = http://www.gardenofpeacememorial.org| publisher = garden of peace memorial organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year the Board of Directors and volunteers organize an event to dedicate the new names of homicide victims being added to the Garden.  The Honor Program is usually held on the third Thursday in September.  Contact us to learn more on how you can add your loved one to the Garden or if you want to be involved with the Garden of Peace.

'''Grove Press''' is an [[United States of America|American]] [[publisher|publishing imprint]] that was founded in 1947. Imprints include: Black Cat, Evergreen, Venus Library, and Zebra. [[Barney Rosset]] purchased the company in 1951 and turned it into an [[Alternative media|alternative]] book press in the United States. He partnered with [[Richard Seaver]] to bring French literature to the United States. The [[Atlantic Monthly Press]], under the aegis of its publisher, [[Morgan Entrekin]], merged with Grove Press in 1991. Grove later became an imprint of the publisher [[Grove/Atlantic, Inc.]]

==Early years==
Grove Press was founded in 1947 in Greenwich Village on Grove Street. The original owners only published three books in three years and so sold it to Barney Rosset in 1951 for three thousand dollars.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Time of Their Lives: The Golden Age of Great American Publishers, Their Editors and AuthorsThe Time of Their Lives: The Golden Age of Great American Publishers, Their Editors and Authors|last=Silverman|first=Al|publisher=Truman Talley|year=2008|isbn=9780312350031|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.groveatlantic.com/#page=infogrove |title=Grove Atlantic |website=www.groveatlantic.com |access-date=2016-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615065504/http://www.groveatlantic.com/ |archivedate=2010-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary avant-garde==
Under Rosset's leadership, Grove introduced American readers to European avant-garde literature and theatre, including French authors [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]], [[Jean Genet]], and [[Eugène Ionesco]].  In 1954 Grove published [[Samuel Beckett]]'s play ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' after it had been refused by more mainstream publishers.  Since then Grove has been Beckett's U.S. publisher.  Grove is also the U.S. publisher of the works of [[Harold Pinter]]; in 2006 it published a collection called ''The Essential Pinter'', which includes Pinter's Nobel Lecture, entitled "Art, Truth &amp; Politics".In 2006 Grove published an anniversary bilingual edition of ''Waiting for Godot'' and a special four-volume edition of Beckett's works, with commissioned introductions by [[Edward Albee]], [[John Maxwell Coetzee|J. M. Coetzee]], [[Salman Rushdie]], and [[Colm Tóibín]], to commemorate his centenary (April 2006).  Grove was also the first American house to publish the unabridged complete works of the [[Marquis de Sade]], translated by Seaver and [[Austryn Wainhouse]].  Grove also had an interest in Japanese literature, publishing several anthologies as well as works by [[Kenzaburō Ōe]] and others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Grove published most of the [[Beat generation|American Beats]] of the 1950s ([[Jack Kerouac]], [[William Burroughs]], and [[Allen Ginsberg]]) as well as poets like [[Frank O'Hara]] of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] and poets associated with [[Black Mountain poets|Black Mountain]] and the [[San Francisco Renaissance]] such as [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]].  In 1963, Grove published ''[[My Life and Loves|My Life and Loves: Five Volumes in One/Complete and Unexpurgated]]'', with annotations, collecting [[Frank Harris]]' work in one volume for the first time.

From 1957 to 1973 Grove published ''[[Evergreen Review]]'', a literary magazine whose contributors included [[Edward Albee]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]], [[Nat Hentoff]], [[LeRoi Jones]], [[John Lahr]], and [[Timothy Leary]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Grove has also from time to time published mainstream works. For example, in 1978 it published the script from the [[George Lucas]] film ''[[American Graffiti]]'' under its Black Cat paperback imprint.

==Political works==
The defining movements of the 1960s in America—the antiwar, civil rights, black power, counterculture, and student movements in the United States—along with revolutions across the globe, were debated, exposed, and discussed in Grove’s publications as was the sexual revolution. Grove’s books challenged prevailing attitudes about sex through dozens of erotic books, many by "anonymous" authors; introduced the layperson to new directions in psychology through [[Eric Berne]]’s ''[[Games People Play (book)|Games People Play]]''; and gave voice to revolutionaries around the world, including [[Che Guevara]] and [[Malcolm X]].  They published works by [[Frantz Fanon]] and [[Régis Debray]], and numerous books opposing the [[Vietnam war]] and the [[conscription|draft]], including information on G.I. rights.&lt;ref name="Syracuse"&gt;[http://library.syr.edu/digital/guides/g/grove_press.htm Grove Press Records], Syracuse University Special Collections Research Center&lt;/ref&gt;
==Censorship and obscenity battles==

Rejecting conventional notions of [[obscenity]] and [[morality]], Grove gained a reputation as a controversial publisher committed to fighting [[censorship]] as it published some of the most well-known banned books.

In 1959, Grove Press published an unexpurgated version of [[D.H. Lawrence]]’s ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]''. The [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office Department]] confiscated copies sent through the mail. Rosset sued the New York city postmaster and his Lawyer [[Charles Rembar]] won in New York, and then on federal appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/opinion/21kaplan.html?pagewanted=all |title=The Day Obscenity Became Art |work=[[The New York Times]]| first=Fred |last=Kaplan |date=July 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grove’s success in publishing ''[[Lady Chatterley’s Lover]]'' paved the way for Rosset to publish another contested work that was ultimately cleared by the courts, [[Henry Miller]]'s 1934 novel, ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The book contained explicit sexual passages and therefore could not be published in the United States. In 1961, Grove Press issued a copy of the work and lawsuits were brought against dozens of individual booksellers in many states for selling it. The issue was ultimately settled by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.&amp;nbsp;S. Supreme Court]]'s 1973 decision in [[Miller v. California]]. (The Miller of the ''Miller'' case was unrelated to Henry Miller.)

The William S. Burroughs novel ''[[Naked Lunch]]'' was banned in some parts of the world for approximately ten years. The first American publisher was Grove Press. The book was banned by [[Boston]] courts in 1962 due to obscenity, but that decision was reversed in a landmark 1966 opinion by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. This was the last major literary [[censorship]] battle in the US.  Upon publication, Grove Press added to the book supplementary material regarding the censorship battle as well as an article written by Burroughs on the topic of [[drug addiction]]. Grove would publish several editions of the novel over the next four decades, including a "Restored Text" version in 2002. Grove also published the first American paperback editions of other Burroughs works including ''[[The Soft Machine]]'', ''[[Nova Express]]'' and ''[[The Ticket That Exploded]]''. Grove would also publish the final collection of the author's writings, the posthumously published ''[[Last Words: The Final Journals of William S. Burroughs]]'', and in 2008 published the American first edition of ''[[And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks]]'', the first release of a novel that Burroughs and [[Jack Kerouac]] had collaborated on in the mid-1940s.

Grove had to defend its [[Evergreen Review]] on several occasions due to what was deemed objectionable content.  Issues were occasionally seized by the authorities.

After winning several battles over the printed page, Grove built on these victories and successfully defended the screening of [[Vilgot Sjöman]]’s Swedish film [[I Am Curious (Yellow)]].

==Union conflicts==

In 1962, Grove had sales of $2 million, but after legal bills, lost $400,000. But by 1964, they were profitable, and by 1967, Grove went public and built its own headquarters. In 1970, the staff of 150 began organizing a union. Rosset fired some of the organizers (and later re-hired them in arbitration). The organizers responded with a picket line and an occupation of the building. Rosset called the police, and the occupiers left. His editor, Richard Seaver, talked to the pickets and convinced them to disperse. Grove distributed an anti-union information sheet, and the union vote failed, 86–34. After the vote, Grove fired half its workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sicha |first=Choire |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2012/01/richard_seaver_s_the_tender_hour_of_twilight_a_memoir_of_grove_press_reviewed.single.html |title=All the Young Dudes: A posthumous memoir goes behind the scenes at the celebrated publisher of Burroughs, Lawrence, and Malcolm X |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=January 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1980s ==
In 1985 Rosset sold Grove Press to Ann Getty, Getty Oil, and Sir [[George Weidenfeld]], a British Publisher.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rosset was fired a year later.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Obscene'', a documentary feature about Rosset and Grove Press by Neil Ortenberg and Daniel O’Connor, was released September 26, 2008.&lt;ref name=barney&gt;{{cite news |last=McGrath |first=Charles |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/movies/24obsc.html |title=Publisher Who Fought Puritanism, and Won |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.obscenethefilm.com |title=Obscene: A Film By Neil Ortenberg &amp; Daniel O'Connor |publisher=Double O Film Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a selection of the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival. Featured in the film are [[Amiri Baraka]], [[Lenny Bruce]], [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Jim Carroll]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Al Goldstein]], [[Erica Jong]], [[Ray Manzarek]], [[Michael McClure]], [[Henry Miller]], [[John Rechy]], [[Ed Sanders]], [[Floyd Salas]], [[John Sayles]], [[Gore Vidal]], [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], and [[Malcolm X]].

==In popular culture==
Grove Press is referenced several times in the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] series ''[[Mad Men]]'', directly or indirectly.  In Season 1, Episode 3, [[Joan Holloway]] returns a borrowed copy of [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]''; the book's first U.S. publisher was Grove Press, who fought numerous court battles over it.  Season 2, Episode 13 is titled "Meditations in an Emergency," after a book of poetry by [[Frank O'Hara]] published by Grove Press in 1957; later in the episode Don Draper is seen reading the book, after being challenged by a colleague ("You wouldn't like it.").  The episode reportedly boosted sales of the book by 218%.&lt;ref&gt;Zmuda, Natalie.  [http://adage.com/article/special-report-mad-men/mad-men-fashion-muse/130074/ "'Mad Men' as Fashion Muse,"] ''Advertising Age'', 4 Aug 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Season 4, Episode 11 features [[Eric Berne]]'s [[Games People Play (book)|Games People Play]], another best-seller published by Grove Press.  In Season 5, Episode 9, Don is seen at the theater holding an issue of ''Evergreen Showcard'', Grove's short-lived [[off-Broadway]] theatrical magazine.  In Season 7, Episode 6, Don mentions to Peggy that he and Megan had seen the film ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]'' the previous evening (Don: "[I'm] still scandalized." Peggy: "Of course Megan would want to see a dirty movie."); the film's U.S. distributor was Grove Press.  In 2010, in an interesting example of art influencing life, Grove/Atlantic (the successor company to Grove Press) published—for real—the memoir of fictional [[Roger Sterling]]: ''Sterling's Gold: Wit and Wisdom of an Ad Man''.

'''Hacker ethic''' is a term for the moral values and philosophy that are common in [[hacker culture]]. Practitioners of the hacker ethic acknowledge that sharing information and data responsibly is beneficial and helpful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker-ethic.html|title=hacker ethic|website=www.catb.org|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the philosophy originated at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in the 1950s–1960s, the term ''hacker ethic'' is attributed to journalist [[Steven Levy]] as described in his 1984 book titled ''[[Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution]].'' The key points within this ethic are access, freedom of information, and improvement to quality of life. While some tenets of hacker ethic were described in other texts like ''[[Computer Lib/Dream Machines]]'' (1974) by [[Ted Nelson]], Levy appears to have been the first to document both the philosophy and the founders of the philosophy.

==History==
Levy explains that MIT housed an early [[IBM 704]] computer inside the Electronic Accounting Machinery (EAM) room in 1959. This room became the staging grounds for early hackers, as MIT students from the [[Tech Model Railroad Club]] sneaked inside the EAM room after hours to attempt programming the 30-ton, {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} computer.

The MIT group defined a ''hack'' as a project undertaken or a product built to fulfill some constructive goal, but also with some wild pleasure taken in mere involvement.&lt;ref&gt;''Hackers''. pg 9&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[Hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology|hack]]'' arose from MIT lingo, as the word had long been used to describe college pranks that MIT students would regularly devise.  However, Levy's hacker ethic also has often been quoted out of context and misunderstood to refer to [[Hacker (computer security)|hacking as in breaking into computers]], and so many sources incorrectly imply that it is describing the ideals of [[White hat (computer security)|white-hat hackers]]. However, what Levy is talking about does not necessarily have anything particular to do with computer security, but addresses broader issues.

The hacker ethic was described as a "new way of life, with a philosophy, an ethic and a dream". However, the elements of the hacker ethic were not openly debated and discussed; rather they were implicitly accepted and silently agreed upon.&lt;ref&gt;''Hackers''. pg. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[free software movement]] was born in the early 1980s from followers of the hacker ethic.  Its founder, [[Richard Stallman]], is referred to by Steven Levy as "the last true hacker".&lt;ref&gt;See the title and content of the Epilogue to [[Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern hackers who hold true to the hacker ethics—especially the Hands-On Imperative—are usually supporters of [[free and open source software]]. This is because free and open source software allows hackers to get access to the [[source code]] used to create the software, to allow it to be improved or reused in other projects.

Richard Stallman describes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The hacker ethic refers to the feelings of right and wrong, to the ethical ideas this community of people had—that knowledge should be shared with other people who can benefit from it, and that important resources should be utilized rather than wasted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memex.org/meme2-04.html MEME 2.04] (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and states more precisely that hacking (which Stallman defines as playful cleverness) and ethics are two separate issues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Just because someone enjoys hacking does not mean he has an ethical commitment to treating other people properly. Some hackers care about ethics—I do, for instance—but that is not part of being a hacker, it is a separate trait. [...] Hacking is not primarily about an ethical issue. &lt;br /&gt;[...] hacking tends to lead a significant number of hackers to think about ethical questions in a certain way. I would not want to completely deny all connection between hacking and views on ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/rms-hack.html The Hacker Community and Ethics: An Interview with Richard M. Stallman, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The hacker ethics==
As Levy summarized in the preface of ''Hackers'', the general tenets or principles of hacker ethic include:&lt;ref&gt;''Hackers'', page ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Sharing
* Openness
* Decentralization
* Free access to computers
* World Improvement (foremost, upholding democracy and the fundamental laws we all live by, as a society)

In addition to those principles, Levy also described more specific hacker ethics and beliefs in chapter 2, ''The Hacker Ethic'':&lt;ref&gt;''Hackers'', pages 26–36.&lt;/ref&gt; The ethics he described in chapter 2 are:

; Access to computers—and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works—should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!: Levy is recounting hackers' abilities to learn and build upon pre-existing ideas and systems. He believes that access gives hackers the opportunity to take things apart, fix, or improve upon them and to learn and understand how they work. This gives them the knowledge to create new and even more interesting things.&lt;ref&gt;''Hackers'', p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Hackers'', pp 3–36&lt;/ref&gt; Access aids the expansion of technology.
; [[Information wants to be free|All information should be free]]: Linking directly with the principle of access, information needs to be free for hackers to fix, improve, and reinvent systems. A free exchange of information allows for greater overall creativity.&lt;ref name="Hackerspg"&gt;''Hackers''. pg 27&lt;/ref&gt; In the hacker viewpoint, any system could benefit from an easy flow of information,&lt;ref name="Levy, S 1984. pg 28"&gt;''Hackers''. pg 28&lt;/ref&gt; a concept known as [[Transparency (humanities)|transparency]] in the social sciences. As [[Richard Stallman|Stallman]] notes, "free" refers to unrestricted access; it does not refer to price.&lt;ref name="denning"&gt;http://faculty.nps.edu/dedennin/publications/ConcerningHackers-NCSC.txt&lt;/ref&gt;
; Mistrust authority—promote decentralization: The best way to promote the free exchange of information is to have an open system that presents no boundaries between a hacker and a piece of information or an item of equipment that they need in their quest for knowledge, improvement, and time on-line.&lt;ref name="Levy, S 1984. pg 28"/&gt; Hackers believe that [[bureaucracy|bureaucracies]], whether corporate, government, or university, are flawed systems.
; Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not criteria such as degrees, age, race, sex, or position: Inherent in the hacker ethic is a [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] system where superficiality is disregarded in esteem of skill. Levy articulates that criteria such as age, sex, race, position, and qualification are deemed irrelevant within the hacker community.&lt;ref name="Levy 1984 pp 3" /&gt; Hacker skill is the ultimate determinant of acceptance. Such a code within the hacker community fosters the advance of hacking and software development. In an example of the hacker ethic of equal opportunity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gabriellacoleman.org/biella/Coleman-Golub-Hacker-Practice.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=16 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720150305/http://gabriellacoleman.org/biella/Coleman-Golub-Hacker-Practice.pdf |archivedate=20 July 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[L Peter Deutsch]], a twelve-year-old hacker, was accepted in the [[TX-0]] community, though he was not recognized by non-hacker graduate students.
; You can create art and beauty on a computer: Hackers deeply appreciate innovative techniques which allow programs to perform complicated tasks with few instructions.&lt;ref&gt;''Hackers''. pg 31&lt;/ref&gt; A program's code was considered to hold a beauty of its own, having been carefully composed and artfully arranged.&lt;ref&gt;''Hackers''. pg 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; Learning to create programs which used the least amount of space almost became a game between the early hackers.&lt;ref name="Levy 1984 pp 3"&gt;''Hackers'', pp 3–36&lt;/ref&gt;
; Computers can change your life for the better: Hackers felt that computers had enriched their lives, given their lives focus, and made their lives adventurous. Hackers regarded computers as [[Aladdin's lamp]]s that they could control.&lt;ref&gt;''Hackers''. pg 33&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that everyone in society could benefit from experiencing such power and that if everyone could interact with computers in the way that hackers did, then the hacker ethic might spread through society and computers would improve the world.&lt;ref&gt;''Hackers''. pg 36&lt;/ref&gt; The hackers succeeded in turning dreams of endless possibilities into realities. The hacker's primary object was to teach society that "the world opened up by the computer was a limitless one" (Levy 230:1984)&lt;ref name="Levy 1984 pp 3"/&gt;

===Sharing===
From the early days of modern computing through to the 1970s, it was far more common for computer users to have the freedoms that are provided by an ethic of open sharing and collaboration. Software, including source code, was commonly shared by individuals who used computers. Most companies had a business model based on hardware sales, and provided or bundled the associated software free of charge. According to Levy's account, sharing was the norm and expected within the non-corporate hacker culture. The principle of sharing stemmed from the open atmosphere and informal access to resources at MIT. During the early days of computers and programming, the hackers at MIT would develop a program and share it with other computer users.

If the hack was deemed particularly good, then the program might be posted on a board somewhere near one of the computers. Other programs that could be built upon it and improved it were saved to tapes and added to a drawer of programs, readily accessible to all the other hackers. At any time, a fellow hacker might reach into the drawer, pick out the program, and begin adding to it or "bumming" it to make it better. Bumming referred to the process of making the code more concise so that more can be done in fewer instructions, saving precious memory for further enhancements.

In the second generation of hackers, sharing was about sharing with the general public in addition to sharing with other hackers. A particular organization of hackers that was concerned with sharing computers with the general public was a group called [[Community Memory]]. This group of hackers and idealists put computers in public places for anyone to use. The first community computer was placed outside of Leopold's Records in [[Berkeley, California]].

Another sharing of resources occurred when Bob Albrecht provided considerable resources for a non-profit organization called the [[People's Computer Company]] (PCC). PCC opened a computer center where anyone could use the computers there for fifty cents per hour.

This second generation practice of sharing contributed to the battles of free and open software. In fact, when [[Bill Gates]]' version of [[BASIC]] for the Altair was shared among the hacker community, Gates claimed to have lost a considerable sum of money because few users paid for the software. As a result, Gates wrote an [[Open Letter to Hobbyists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = We-Think | author = Charles Leadbetter | publisher = Profile Books | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | publisher = Metro | date = 12 March 2008 | author = Fiona Macdonald | title = Get a fair share of creativity }}&lt;/ref&gt; This letter was published by several computer magazines and newsletters, most notably that of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]] where much of the sharing occurred.

===Hands-On Imperative===
Many of the principles and tenets of hacker ethic contribute to a common goal: the Hands-On Imperative. As Levy described in Chapter 2, "Hackers believe that essential lessons can be learned about the systems—about the world—from taking things apart, seeing how they work, and using this knowledge to create new and more interesting things."&lt;ref&gt;''Hackers'', pages 27–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Employing the Hands-On Imperative requires free access, open information, and the sharing of knowledge. To a true hacker, if the Hands-On Imperative is restricted, then the ends justify the means to make it unrestricted ''so that improvements can be made''. When these principles are not present, hackers tend to work around them. For example, when the computers at MIT were protected either by physical locks or login programs, the hackers there systematically worked around them in order to have access to the machines. Hackers assumed a "willful blindness" in the pursuit of perfection.&lt;ref name="Hackerspg" /&gt;

This behavior was not malicious in nature: the MIT hackers did not seek to harm the systems or their users. This deeply contrasts with the modern, media-encouraged image of [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] who crack secure systems in order to steal information or complete an act of cyber-vandalism.

===Community and collaboration===
Throughout writings about hackers and their work processes, a common value of community and collaboration is present. For example, in Levy's ''Hackers'', each generation of hackers had geographically based communities where collaboration and sharing occurred. For the hackers at MIT, it was the labs where the computers were running. For the hardware hackers (second generation) and the game hackers (third generation) the geographic area was centered in [[Silicon Valley]] where the [[Homebrew Computer Club]] and the [[People's Computer Company]] helped hackers network, collaborate, and share their work.

The concept of community and collaboration is still relevant today, although hackers are no longer limited to collaboration in geographic regions. Now collaboration takes place via the [[Internet]]. [[Eric S. Raymond]] identifies and explains this conceptual shift in ''[[The Cathedral and the Bazaar]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s11.html |title=The Social Context of Open-Source Software |publisher=Catb.org |date= |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Before cheap Internet, there were some geographically compact communities where the culture encouraged Weinberg's egoless programming, and a developer could easily attract a lot of skilled kibitzers and co-developers. Bell Labs, the MIT AI and LCS labs, UC Berkeley: these became the home of innovations that are legendary and still potent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Raymond also notes that the success of Linux coincided with the wide availability of the [[World Wide Web]]. The value of community is still in high practice and use today.

==Levy's "true hackers"==
{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Levy identifies several "true hackers" who significantly influenced the hacker ethic. Some well-known "true hackers" include:

* [[Bill Gosper]]: Mathematician and hacker
* [[Richard Greenblatt (programmer)|Richard Greenblatt]]: Programmer and early designer of [[Lisp machine|LISP machines]]
* [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]]: Co-founder of the [[MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab]] and [[Stanford AI Laboratory]]
* [[Jude Milhon]]: Founder of the [[cypherpunk]] movement, senior editor at ''[[Mondo 2000]]'', and co-founder of [[Community Memory]]
* [[Richard Stallman]]: Programmer and political activist who is well known for [[GNU]], [[Emacs]] and the [[Free Software Movement]]

Levy also identified the "hardware hackers" (the "second generation", mostly centered in [[Silicon Valley]]) and the "game hackers" (or the "third generation"). All three generations of hackers, according to Levy, embodied the principles of the hacker ethic. Some of Levy's "second-generation" hackers include:

* [[Steve Dompier]]: Homebrew Computer Club member and hacker who worked with the early [[Altair 8800]]
* [[John Draper]]: A legendary figure in the computer programming world. He wrote [[EasyWriter]], the first word processor.
* [[Lee Felsenstein]]: A hardware hacker and co-founder of [[Community Memory]] and Homebrew Computer Club; a designer of the [[Sol-20]] computer
* [[Bob Marsh]]: A designer of the [[Sol-20]] computer
* [[Fred Moore (activist)|Fred Moore]]: Activist and founder of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]]
* [[Steve Wozniak]]: One of the founders of [[Apple Computer]]

Levy's "third generation" practitioners of hacker ethic include:

* John Harris: One of the first programmers hired at On-Line Systems (which later became [[Sierra Entertainment]])
* [[Ken Williams (gaming)|Ken Williams]]: Along with wife [[Roberta Williams|Roberta]], founded On-Line Systems after working at IBM – the company would later achieve mainstream popularity as [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra]]

== Teaching Ethical Hacking ==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2017}}

In this digital age, and due to our reliance on technology, hackers are able to gather more information on us than before. One way to combat this is to teach students to hack in such a way that they become what are called ''white hat hackers''. White hat hackers follow ethical guidelines that proscribe harming either other people or the systems on which other people depend. Through their efforts, they have the ability to prevent malicious attacks. The movement of ethical hacking has gained traction through different programs such as the [[L0pht]] and GhettoHackers, and courses have become integrated into university- and college-level curriculum.

===Discourage Black Hat Hacking===

Security researcher and an application security engineer Joe Gervais pointed out that students who are intellectually curious enough may start to experiment with computers without thinking of the ethical repercussions of their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-data-protection/cyber-security/hacker-high-why-we-need-to-teach-hacking-in-schools/|title= Hacker High: Why We Need To Teach Hacking in Schools|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate= 28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He points out that there are a lot of classes that exist for more gifted students in areas such as math, reading, etc. However, there doesn’t seem to be courses that can address the curiosity that a young hacker may have.

Hacking courses can create a moral compass for young hackers. They require a constructive environment that allows them to satiate their desire to understand computers. Students in these classes have the ability to learn what they are passionate about while also understanding the ethical boundaries that should not be encroached upon. However, the integral part of the curriculum would be to prevent the development of black hat hackers.

===Encourage White Hat Hacking===

There seems to be a lack of skilled cyber security experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2014/09/30/cybersecurity-defense-hampered-by-lack-of-white-hat-hacker-talent/|title= Cybersecurity Defense Hampered by Lack of ‘White Hat’ Hacker Talent| last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate= 28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, there doesn’t seem to be sufficient curriculum to teach individuals the skills required to protect systems against malicious action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/04/11/universities-arent-doing-enough-to-train-the-cyberdefenders-america-desperately-needs/?utm_term=.19fcc8ee64b9|title=Universities aren’t doing enough to train the cyberdefenders America desperately needs|last=Peterson|first=Andrea|date=11 April 2016|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching ethical hacking is a plausible way to fill the gap in the supply of technically skilled people; capable of successfully implementing defensive mechanisms to overcome real world threats. Ymir Vigfusson, professor at the School of Computer Science at Reykjavik University and assistant professor in Emory University’s Math and Science Department, is a major advocate in favor of educating students about hacking. Ymir points out that teaching hacking can be a way for students to better understand computer security. He believes that hackers have a unique mindset wherein they are constantly thinking about how they can break through security controls. However, defenders, the ones tasked with actually protecting a network are only thinking of ways to keep people out. What hackers can contribute is in their mindset and perspective. This shared mindset and knowledge allows defenders to realize otherwise unseen weak points in security systems and to reinforce them. In 2012, Ymir held a talk at  TEDxRekjavijk titled "Why I Teach People to Hack" that further illustrates his reasons for supporting the teaching of ethical hacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=Why I teach people how to hack {{!}} Ýmir Vigfússon {{!}} TEDxReykjavík|date=4 July 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwJyKmCbOws|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other descriptions==
In 2001, [[Finland|Finnish]] philosopher [[Pekka Himanen]] promoted the hacker ethic in opposition to the [[Protestant work ethic]]. In Himanen's opinion, the hacker ethic is more closely related to the [[virtue ethics]] found in the writings of [[Plato]] and of [[Aristotle]]. Himanen explained these ideas in a book, ''[[The Hacker Ethic and the Spirit of the Information Age]]'', with a prologue contributed by [[Linus Torvalds]] and an epilogue by [[Manuel Castells]].

In this manifesto, the authors wrote about a hacker ethic centering on passion, hard work, creativity and joy in creating software. Both Himanen and Torvalds were inspired by the [[Sampo]] in [[Finnish mythology]]. The Sampo, described in the [[Kalevala]] saga, was a magical artifact constructed by [[Ilmarinen]], the blacksmith god, that brought good fortune to its holder; nobody knows exactly what it was supposed to be. The Sampo has been interpreted in many ways: a [[Axis mundi|world pillar]] or [[world tree]], a [[compass]] or [[astrolabe]], a chest containing a treasure, a [[Byzantine]] [[coin die]], a decorated [[Vendel]] period shield, a Christian relic, etc. Kalevala saga compiler Lönnrot interpreted it to be a "[[Quern-stone|quern]]" or mill of some sort that made flour, salt, and gold out of thin air.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The hacker ethic and its wider context can be associated with [[liberalism]] and [[anarchism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coleman|first=E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2440">[[NATO]] has defined the concept of an '''Information Exchange Gateway''' (IEG) to facilitate secure communication between different security and management domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NATO IEG|url=http://www.afcea.org/europe/events/tne/08/documents/03_InteroperableStandardsProfiles-EWells.pdf|publisher=AFCEA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IEG is designed to provide a standard and [[secure communication|secure method of communication]] between NATO, NATO nations, non-NATO nations, [[coalition force]]s, [[Non Government Organisation]]s (NGOs), and other International Organisations (IOs).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cso.nato.int/ACTIVITY_META.asp?ACT=2226&lt;/ref&gt;

An Information Exchange Gateway provides '''Information Exchange Services''' (IES) to facilitate the exchange of information between networks, including data and protocol translation where necessary, and '''Information Protection Services''' (IPS) that ensure only intended information is exchanged. In addition, '''Node Protection Services''' (NPS) ensure information is exchanged in a safe and secure way and that only intended information which has been validated by the IPS can be exchanged.&lt;ref&gt;Guidance Document on the Implementation of Gateways for Information Exchange between NATO CIS and External CIS, AC/322-D(2005)0054-REV2, NATO, March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

NATO has defined five main IEG scenarios&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Exchange Gateways|url= https://www.nexor.com/information-exchange-gateways/ |publisher=Nexor}}&lt;/ref&gt; each with scenario variants for transferring [[Classified information|classified information]]. The scenarios take account of the security classifications of the domains that they connect, as well as the security policy, the owners and the administrators of those domains.

In some scenarios, an IEG must include a [[Guard (information security)|guard]] to provide the IPS and NPS functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Exchange Gateways|url= http://www.deep-secure.com/information-exchange-gateway |publisher=Deep-Secure}}&lt;/ref&gt; When used with a guard, the IEG's [[DMZ (computing)|DMZ]] is split into two.

The '''Information Trust Institute''' (ITI) was founded in 2004 as an interdisciplinary unit designed to approach [[information security]] research from a systems perspective. It examines information security by looking at what makes machines, applications, and users trustworthy. Its mission is to create computer systems, software, and networks that society can depend on to be ''trustworthy'', meaning secure, dependable (reliable and available), correct, safe, private, and survivable. ITI's stated goal is to create a new paradigm for designing trustworthy systems from the ground up and validating systems that are intended to be trustworthy.

== Participants ==

ITI is an academic/industry partnership focusing on application areas such as electric power, financial systems, defense, and homeland security, among others. It brings together over 100 researchers representing numerous colleges and units at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32161">{{About|the inequality between nations|inequality within nations|economic inequality}}

'''International inequality''' refers to the idea of inequality between countries''.'' This can be compared to global inequality which is inequality between people across countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garcia|first=Frank|date=February 7, 2017|title=Globalization, Inequality &amp; International Economic Law|url=|journal=Religions|volume=2|pages=12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may refer to [[Economic inequality|economic differences]] between countries. As well as, medical care and education differences.

There are many different ways to define equality. [[Ronald Dworkin]] claims that equality is the idea of being able to live without [[envy]]. Meaning that countries or citizens can live without the constant desire for the life someone else has.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What is the Point of Equality?|last=Anderson|first=Elizabeth|publisher=|year=January 1999|isbn=|location=|pages=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be assumed that inequality is the idea where people are living in envy. Many countries are envious of  basic needs. Food, clean water, or even health care are some of the things that many countries live without.

According to the United Nations Human Development Report 2004, the [[gross domestic product|gross domestic per capita]] (GDP) in countries with high, medium and low human development (a classification based on the [[UN Human Development Index]]) was 24,806, 4,269 and 1,184 PPP$, respectively (PPP$ = [[purchasing power parity]] measured in [[United States dollar]]s).&lt;ref&gt;http://hdr.undp.org/statistics/data/indic/indic_4_1_1.html&lt;/ref&gt; The wealthiest people in the world, especially those with over $100,000 in assets, 1.8% of the [[World population|global population]] own 86.4% of the overall wealth (See data for more information).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://inequality.org/facts/global-inequality/|title=Global Inequality|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposed explanations  ==
In economics and political science, a variety of explanations have been advanced to explain the magnitude of the disparity in [[economic growth]] and [[Development economics|development]] between nations.

=== Causes ===
1. [[Geography]]: The location of some countries may affect their economy. Apart of this would be that there are some countries who are able to gain access to certain medicine and medical practices.

2. [[Colonialism]]: “Inequality breeds inequality” This being in the sense that as our ancestors travelled to new land, they would settle in these countries. However, this did not change their economy level. This meant that they would just be bringing their inequality to another location.

3. Structure of Economy: Colonialism and historical experiences are widely perceived as creating an unfair global economy that keeps poor countries poor and rich countries rich.

4. Population Growth: Poor countries have had a large increase in population over the years. This causes a lack of resources. More people mean more resources being used.

5. Government Policies: Some eastern countries have policies where the people must rely on religion and not science. This may leave the people to not receive the medical treatment they need. Due to the medical care not being a part of the religion.

6. Political Instability: Countries that have no governmental structure have problems with deciding how to use resources. Example, Angola has an abundance of resources. However, due to not having a stable political system, they are suffering from a poor economy and low life-expectancy.

7. Natural Disasters: Earthquakes, droughts, hurricanes, and many other disasters play a role in the inequality within countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Issues: Politics, Economics, and Culture|last=Payne|first=Richard|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|year=2017|isbn=978-0-13-420205-1|location=|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differences in economic institutions ===
Economic institutions such as competitive markets, credible contracts and systems of [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]] allow economic agents to pursue the economic activities which form the basis of growth. It has been argued that the presence or absence of strong economic institutions is a primary determinant of development. Economists have begun to consider the set of economic institutions adopted by countries as a choice that is in turn determined endogenously by competing social forces.

==== In the colonial setting ====
Pointing to [[History of colonialism|European colonization]] as a "natural experiment," [[Daron Acemoğlu|Daron Acemoglu]], [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]] and [[James A. Robinson (economist)|James A. Robinson]] argue that colonizers who encountered dense populations with developed economies such as in Central America and India were incentived to impose extractive economic institutions, while colonizers who encountered sparse populations with few natural resources such as in North America were more likely to institute broad-based property rights. This resulted in a "reversal of fortune" around 1800 as regions which were under-developed at the time of colonization were able to industrialize more effectively. By [[Instrumental variable|instrumenting]] the strength of property rights in colonized nations with European settler mortality (a quasi-random determinant of whether Europeans were able to establish colonies), the authors conclude in a [[Colonial origins of comparative development|widely cited paper]] that the majority of present-day inequality among former European colonies can be attributed to the persisting role of economic institutions.

=== Path dependence ===
In the context of development, [[path dependence]] encapsulates the idea that certain decisive moments in history may have an outsized and persistent impact on the long-run economic and political character of nations. These moments, known as critical junctures, may produce outcomes which induce positive feedback and thereby set nations on patterns of development that are difficult to reverse.

==== In Central America ====
Political scientist [[James Mahony|James Mahoney]] has examined the political consequences of a period of liberal reform which swept [[Central America]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries. As an example of path dependence, the author argues that whether policies were implemented along radical or reformist guidelines directly determined the success of the liberalization efforts and ultimately resulted in vastly different political outcomes which persisted for decades, ranging from military authoritarian regimes ([[Guatemala]] and [[El Salvador]]) to progressive democracy ([[Costa Rica]]).

=== Other explanations ===
A multitude of other explanations have been propounded including:
* Environmental factors (including work by [[Jared Diamond]])
* Cultural factors (including work by [[Max Weber]])

== International wealth distribution ==
{{see also|List of countries by distribution of wealth}}
A study by the [[World Institute for Development Economics Research]] at [[United Nations University]] reports that the richest 1% of adults alone owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000, and that the richest 10% of adults accounted for 85% of the world total. The bottom half of the world adult population owned barely 1% of global wealth. In 2013, [[Oxfam International]] released a report to The [[World Economic Forum]] that the richest 1% owns 48 percent of the global wealth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/oxfam-richest-1-percent-sees-share-of-global-wealth-jump/ar-AA8lc7U?ocid=ansnewsap11 Oxfam: Richest 1 percent sees share of global wealth jump]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Oxfam reported that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressrelease/2014-01-20/rigged-rules-mean-economic-growth-increasingly-winner-takes-all-for-rich-elites Rigged rules mean economic growth increasingly “winner takes all” for rich elites all over world].

The major component of the world's income inequality (the global [[Gini coefficient]]) is comprised by two groups of countries (called the "twin peaks" by [[Danny Quah|Quah]] [1997]).
* The first group has 13% of the world's population and receives 45% of the world's PPP income. This group includes the United States, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Australia and Canada, and comprises 500 million people with an annual income level over 11,500 PPP$.
*The second group has 42% of the world's population and receives only 9% of the world PPP income. This group includes India, Indonesia and rural China, and comprises 2.1 billion people with an income level under 1,000 PPP$. (See Milanovic 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;38).

Economic inequality often closely matches a [[lognormal distribution|lognormal]] or [[Pareto distribution]] both across economies and within them.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The evolution of the income gap between poor and rich countries is related to [[Catch-up effect|convergence]]. Convergence can be defined as "the tendency for poorer countries to grow faster than richer ones and, hence, for their levels of income to converge".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldbank.org/fandd/english/0696/articles/090696.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Convergence is a matter of current research and debate, but most studies have shown lack of evidence for absolute convergence based on comparisons among countries.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

According to current research, global income inequality peaked approximately in the 1970s when world income was [[Bimodal distribution|distributed bimodally]] into "rich" and "poor" countries with little overlap. Since then inequality have been rapidly decreasing, and this trend seems to be accelerating. Income distribution is now unimodal, with most people living in middle-income countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/4508&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global Poverty ==
Global poverty is when people within certain countries are living on less than a dollar a day.

There are six different aspects that can attribute to global poverty.

=== Six Dimensional Aspects ===
1.    [[Hunger]]: Countries without the proper amount of food to survive.

2.    Mental state: This is where people or the country as a whole is feeling powerless, ashamed, or humiliated. This is connected to the fact that they must rely or ask other countries for help and are unable to survive on their own.

3.    Poor groundwork: Lack of roads, clean water, transportation, etc. Meaning that they do not have a stable foundation in order to provide these things.

4.    Education: People do not have access to proper education or any education at all.

5.    Health: Countries are unable to provide the proper health care that many people need in order to survive.

6.    Lack of income: People within a poor country tend to put income aside and focus on their family, physical, and environmental assets.

=== Lack of Decline in Global Poverty ===
Along with these six-dimensional aspects, there is also some things preventing the decline of global [[poverty]]. One reason is because of the ongoing armed conflicts going on throughout countries. Some countries who are suffering from poverty, are not receiving aid from other countries due to not wanted to be a part of the conflict. Countries do not want to causes problems with other countries, so they decide to stay neutral and not help.

A second reason for number of countries in poverty not declining would be that there is not a lot of support from other countries. Many rich countries, such as the United States, do not give a ton of support to countries in poverty. Again, this can connect to the sense of not wanting to get involved with countries in conflict.

The final reason has to do with certain organizations not knowing where and what to start with. These organizations can see that there is a lot of countries who are in poverty and need help. However, it can be a challenge deciding who gets what money and how much they get. These organizations do not have unlimited funds and need to be careful where money is being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Issues: Politics, Economics, and Culture|last=Payne|first=Richard|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|year=2017|isbn=978-0-13-420205-1|location=|pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Globalpovertyproject.jpg|left|thumb|369x369px|One of the founders]]

=== [[Global Poverty Project]] ===
The Global Poverty Project is an organization that works to help reduce the global poverty percentage. They have currently contributed $35 billion in order to help provide the care many people need. This money has been earned through fundraisers and donations.

This organization has provided clean water and sanitation stations for people in countries like India. Sanitation stations help avoid contaminating clean water that can be used for drinking or cooking. They have also helped with providing education in countries where education has taken a back seat.

The Global Poverty Project was started in 2008 and has headquarters in Canada, The United Kingdom, and Australia. There is also an office in New York. They project that by 2030, there will be a major decrease in those who are living in poverty and an increase in education, healthy living, and the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalpovertyproject.com/|title=Global Citizen: A Global Poverty Project|last=|first=|date=2008|website=|access-date=November 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons==
[[File:Global changes in real income by income percentile - v1.png|thumb|right|350px|Change in real income between 1988 and 2008 at various income percentiles of global income distribution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heymancenter.org/files/events/milanovic.pdf Branko Milanovic-Global Income Inequality by the Numbers-In History and Now-February 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Some of the economic disparities among nations can be better appreciated when rich and poor countries or societies are contrasted. For example, with regard to income inequality, according to some estimates by [[Branko Milanovic]] from the [[World Bank]]:
* "An American having the average income of the bottom U.S. decile is better-off than 2/3 of world population." (Milanovic 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;50)
* "The top 10% of the U.S. population has an aggregate income equal to income of the poorest 43 percent of people in the world, or differently put, total income of the richest 25 million Americans is equal to total income of almost 2 billion people." (Milanovic 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;50)
With regard to wealth inequality (researchers defined wealth as the value of physical and financial assets minus debts), a 2006 report with data from 2000 concluded that:
*  "India dominates the bottom third of the global wealth distribution, contributing a little under 27% of this group. The middle third of the distribution is the domain of China which supplies more than a third of those in deciles 4-8. At the top end, North America, Europe and high-income Asia monopolise the top decile, each regional group accounting for around one-third of the richest wealth holders" (Davies et al. 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;27)
* "the top 10% of adults own 85% of global household wealth, so that the average member of this group has 8.5 times the global average holding. The corresponding figures for the top 5%, top 2%, and top 1% are 71%  (14.2 times the average), 51% (25 times the average) and 40% (40 times the average), respectively. This compares with the bottom half of the distribution which collectively owns barely 1% of global wealth. Thus the top 1% own almost 40 times as much as the bottom 50%. The contrast with the bottom decile of wealth holders is even starker. The average member of the top decile nearly 3,000 times the mean wealth of the bottom decile, and the average member of the top percentile is more than 13,000 times richer." (Davies et al. 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;26)
* "for the world as a whole the share of the top 10% was 85% in the year 2000 and the Gini equalled 0.892 using official exchange rates" (Davies et al. 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;32)
* "only $2,161 was needed in order to belong to the top half of the world wealth distribution, but to be a member of the top 10% required at least $61,000 and membership of the top 1% required more than $500,000 per adult." (Davies et al. 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;25)
James Davies, Professor of Economics at the [[University of Western Ontario]], and one of the authors of the report, said: "Income inequality has been rising for the past 20 to 25 years and we think that is true for inequality in the distribution of wealth." "There is a group of problems in developing countries that make it difficult for people to build assets, which are important, since life is so precarious."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080705200602/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0%2C%2C11069-2488836%2C00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other disparities can be better appreciated when rich individuals (or corporations) are compared against poor individuals. According to some estimates, for instance:
*"The richest 1% of people in the world receive as much as the bottom 57%, or in other words, less than 50 million richest people receive as much as 2.7 billion poor." (Milanovic 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;50)
* The ''three'' richest people possess more [[finance|financial]] assets than the poorest 10% of the world's population, combined [http://cte.rockhurst.edu/FileUploads/mchugh.pdf]. &lt;big&gt;Link broken&lt;/big&gt;.
* As of May 2005, the three richest people in the world have total assets that exceed the annual combined GDP of the 47 countries with the least GDP, (calculation based on data from [[list of countries by GDP (PPP)]] and [[list of billionaires]]) (Annan, 1998)
* As of May 2005, the 125 richest people in the world have assets that exceed the annual combined GDP of all the [[least developed countries]] (calculation based on data from [[list of countries by GDP (PPP)]] and [[list of billionaires]]).

==Data==
[[File:Global-share-of-wealth-by-wealth-group-768x409.png|thumb|344x344px|Global Income]]
As of 2017, over 70% of the world's adults have under $10,000 in wealth. This can be seen through the bar graph on the right. 
This bar graph also shows that as the value rises, the total percentage of adults falls. This is because there are not a large percent of people who make a lot nor have a lot. Only .7% of the world has one million dollars or more in wealth.

However, looking at the wealth share, this number continues to rise. This is because those few people who have higher assets in wealth, typically hold a larger percentage of the world's wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://inequality.org/facts/global-inequality/|title=Global Inequality|last=|first=|date=|website=Inequality.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welfare spending: If East Asia and southern Latin American countries are taken out of the equation, the differences in government spending between the industrialized and developing is as follows:
* Social expenditures, as a proportion for GDP for [[Indonesia]] or the [[Dominican Republic]], registers around the 2–3 per cent mark, compared to Sweden or France which at the moment hover just under the 30%.
* In contrast to the industrialized states, from 1980 to 1990 many southern states experienced a decline in social spending as a percentage of overall government spending.

Therefore, in contrast to the [[North–South divide|North]], the developing states are far more vulnerable to the pressures arising from economic globalization. Overall, social spending is far lower in the [[North–South divide|South]], with some regions registering just a few percentage points of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glenn|first=John|title=Welfare Spending in an Era of Globalization: The North-South Divide|journal=International Relations|year=2009|volume=23|issue=1|pages=27–8, 30–1, 36–9, 45–6|doi=10.1177/0047117808100608}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some people argue that decrease in welfare spending is not an issue of global inequality but rather a common phenomenon in an era of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deacon|first=Bob|title=Globalization and Social Policy: The Threat to Equitable Welfare|journal=United Nations Research Institute for Social Development|date=March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential Solutions ==
Some potential solutions to help with decreasing the inequality levels are:

Education and [[Family planning|Family Planning]]: Many countries with education access have higher income levels. Part of this is because people are striving for a career and are striving for higher education. Countries who do not have access to education have lower income. Women who have access to an education will have less children because they are focusing on building themselves.

[[Democracy]] (may be of some help):  Democracy offers people the opportunity to vote on people in power or specific issues. This can help with people having a say in what goes on and what happens within their country. Making decisions on where money is spent and programs that can help provide for the poor.

Government policies:The government could play an important role on the economy and poverty. The government can create policies that can aid the poor and help provide proper medicine to those in need.

Pay attention to women: Women play a large role in inequality through the raising of children. They help with children's education and they encourage their children to reach their potential. If women are feeling good about themselves, then they can take that positive attitude in order to help raise their own children for success.

Improve [[agriculture]]: Poor countries tend to suffer from food shortages. One thing that could be done is to help improve farming grounds and live stock development. By starting the proper groundwork for crops, it will help provide the nutrition that many people need. Live stock can provide milk, [[Egg as food|eggs]], meat, and cheese for consuming. This can also help provide fur and feathers for making clothing and other goods. This could be sold to help with low income.

Think Small: Having volunteers travel to poor countries in order to help can make a large difference to those countries. Going to help build homes, do studies on the area, or even to help provide food/clean water can make a large difference to developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Issues: Politics, Economics, Culture|last=Payne|first=Richard|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|year=2017|isbn=978-0-13-420205-1|location=|pages=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on economic inequality==
{{Main|Economic inequality#Perspectives regarding economic inequality|l1=Perspectives regarding economic inequality}}

There are various schools of thought regarding economic inequality. [[Marxism]] favors an eventual society where distribution is based on an individual's needs rather than social class or other such factors. [[Meritocracy]] favors an eventual society where an individual's success is a direct function of contribution reflecting an individual's skills and effort, and detrimental (this is a [[value judgement]]) inasmuch as it represent inherited or unjustified wealth or opportunities. [[Classical liberals]] and [[libertarians]] generally do not take a stance on wealth inequality, but believe in equality under the law regardless of whether it leads to unequal wealth distribution. Arguments based on [[social justice]] favor a more equal distribution making claims economic inequality weakens societies, although counter-arguments are made that inequality might benefit societies.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)''' persons in the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] of the '''Turks and Caicos Islands''' face legal challenges not experienced by non-[[LGBT]] residents. Same-sex sexual activity has been legal in the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] since 2001, and discrimination based on sexual orientation is constitutionally banned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2013.pdf State-sponsored Homophobia A world survey of laws prohibiting same sex activity between consenting adults] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6IEmVxpKn?url=http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2013.pdf |date=19 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, same-sex couples are unable to marry or jointly adopt.

==Legality of same-sex sexual activtiy==
Same-sex sexual acts were expressly decriminalised under the [[United Kingdom]]'s ''Caribbean Territories (Criminal Law) Order, 2000'', which took effect on 1 January 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ai/laws/TCLU/Caribbean%20Territories%20(Criminal%20Law)%20Order%202000/docs/Caribbean%20Territories%20(Criminal%20Law)%20Order%202000_03.pdf|title=Caribbean Territories (Criminal Law) Order, 2000|publisher=|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law received considerable local media coverage. The two largest newspapers (one of each belongs to the two largest political parties) described the law as "an affront to our country" and "the sissy law".&lt;ref name="global"/&gt;

==Recognition of same-sex relationships==
{{see also|Recognition of same-sex unions in the British Overseas Territories}}

The Turks and Caicos Islands do not recognise same-sex unions. Article 10 of the Constitution reads:
:''Every unmarried man and woman of marriageable age (as determined by or under any law) has the right to marry a person of the opposite sex and found a family.''&lt;ref name="gov.tc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/1681/pdfs/uksi_20111681_en.pdf|title=The Turks and Caicos Islands Constitution Order 2011|publisher=Government of United Kingdom (legislation.gov.uk).|date= |accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination protections==
Article 16 of the [[Constitution of the Turks and Caicos Islands|Constitution]] bans discrimination based on [[sexual orientation]]:&lt;ref name="gov.tc"/&gt;
:''In this section, "discriminatory" means affording different treatment to different persons attributable wholly or mainly to their respective descriptions such as by race, national or social origin, political or other opinion, colour, religion, language, creed, association with a national minority, property, sex, sexual orientation, birth or other status whereby persons of one such description are subjected to disabilities or restrictions to which persons of another such description are not made subject or are accorded privileges or advantages which are not accorded to persons of another such description.''

==Living conditions==
The Turks and Caicos Islands are considered a safe destination for LGBT tourists. LGBT people tend to face no discrimination issues in resorts and very touristic areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gaytravel.com/gay-guides/turks-caicos-islands/|title=Gay Guide to Turks and Caicos - GayTravel Guide for LGBTQ Travelers — Gay Bars &amp; Clubs, Gay Friendly Hotels, Cruises, Tours, Events, Beaches, Weddings, Deals &amp; Reviews|website=www.gaytravel.com|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Turks and Caicos inhabitants are quite tolerant of same-sex relationships.&lt;ref name="global"/&gt; Several gay-themed cruise ships have also been allowed to port in the islands.&lt;ref name="global"/&gt;

There are no known gay rights organisations in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Several government education programmes on HIV/AIDS have reached out to gay men, though.&lt;ref name="global"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalgayz.com/being-gay-in-turks-and-caicos-islands/|title=Being Gay in Turks &amp; Caicos Islands|website=www.globalgayz.com|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homophobia in the Turks and Caicos Islands is mostly religious-based.&lt;ref name="global"/&gt; Following the passage of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] in [[California]], several religious preachers called on same-sex marriage to be constitutionally banned in island law. Religious groups have also opposed greater awareness and prevention of HIV/AIDS, erroneously claiming that straight men and women cannot get infected.&lt;ref name="global"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17378">The '''Leung Chin-man appointment controversy''' occurred in Hong Kong in August 2008, when the former [[Permanent Secretary for Housing, Planning and Lands]], [[Leung Chin-man]], was named Deputy Managing Director and Executive Director of [[New World China Land|New World China Land Ltd.]]

There was widespread suspicion &lt;!--and ? ("uproar" was too vague and sounds like riots in the streets; perhaps "disquiet" is more ... Chinese!--&gt;among members of the public that job offer was a ''[[quid pro quo]]'' for the favours he allegedly granted to its parent company, New World Development (NWD), in 2004.&lt;ref name=unrest&gt;{{Cite news

In 2004, while Leung was Director of Housing, the government sold an unused [[Home Ownership Scheme|Private Sector Participation Scheme]] project.&lt;ref name=demolish&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=69649&amp;sid=20042344&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20080805&amp;sear_year=2008 |title=Former housing chief faces legal bid to demolish his job with developer |author=Diana Lee |work=The Standard |date=5 August 2008 |accessdate=7 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211062928/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=69649&amp;sid=20042344&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20080805&amp;sear_year=2008 |archivedate=11 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale of the Hung Hom Peninsula [[Home Ownership Scheme|HOS]] [[Public housing in Hong Kong|housing estate]] to NWD took place at less than half of the original asking price.&lt;ref name=unrest/&gt;

[[Henderson Land Development]] had been granted permission to exclude the public transport terminus from the gross floor area in its building plan for their ''Grand Promenade'' development, thus gaining additional revenues of [[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]]3.2&amp;nbsp;billion &lt;!--(US$?)--&gt;as a result of the decision.&lt;ref name="prom"&gt;{{Cite news | title=Audit chief backs lawmakers in Promenade row | date=17 May 2006 | work=The Standard | location=Hong Kong | url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=18869&amp;sid=7995525&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20060517&amp;sear_year=2006 | accessdate=23 March 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522035325/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=18869&amp;sid=7995525&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20060517&amp;sear_year=2006 | archivedate=22 May 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect was to allow the addition of 10,700 square meters to the project.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{Cite news | author=Albert Wong | title=Audit chief in deal on judicial review | date=25 May 2006 | work=The Standard | location=Hong Kong | url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=19369&amp;sid=8120113&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20060525&amp;sear_year=2006 | accessdate=23 March 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522035359/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=19369&amp;sid=8120113&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20060525&amp;sear_year=2006 | archivedate=22 May 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic principle to follow in considering applications is that there should be no impropriety in the proposed employment. In this regard, the Administration takes into account the following factors –
*(a) whether the officer, while serving in the Government, was involved in policy formulation or decision which could have benefited his prospective employer;
*(b) whether the prospective employer might gain an unfair advantage over competitors because of the officer’s previous knowledge and experience; and
*(c) the public perception of the officer taking up the proposed business or employment.

Directorate officers wishing to take up outside work, paid or unpaid, full-time or part-time, during their final leave period before their formal departure from the Government and/or within a specified control period counting from the said departure, should apply for prior permission from the Secretary for the Civil Service (SCS) in accordance with detailed arrangements set out in CSB Circular No. 10/2005.&lt;ref name=outsidework&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.csb.gov.hk/print/english/admin/retirement/188.html |title=Post-service Outside Work|publisher=CIvil Service Bureau, Government of Hong Kong|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to procedures drawn up, civil servants of Leung's grade are subject to a 12-month 'sterilisation period' and required government approval to take up private sector posts within three years of leaving.&lt;ref name=LCpaper/&gt; Procedures laid down required that views from the relevant bureaux be taken into account.

== Approval and conditions ==
The [[Secretary for the Civil Service]], [[Denise Yue|Denise Yue Chung-yee]], signed off on the approval for him to take up the job after it passed through the Advisory committee on post-service employment of civil servants, responsible for vetting the appointment.&lt;ref name=demolish/&gt;

The Transport and Housing Bureau, the Development Bureau and Administrative Officer Grade Management were asked for their views. On receiving these submissions, the CSB prepared a paper for the Advisory committee to facilitate their consideration.&lt;ref name=processing&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Report on the processing of the application from Mr Leung Chin-man to take up post-service outside work with New World China Land Limited |url=http://www.csb.gov.hk/english/info/files/common/leung_eng.pdf |format=PDF|date= 15 August 2008| publisher=Civil Service Bureau, Govt of Hong Kong|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The view taken by the CSB was that Leung would oversee only mainland business of his future employer, and that bearing in mind he had ceased to be Director of Buildings for six years, and had left the post of Permanent Secretary of Housing two years previously,  his appointment was "unlikely to present problems of conflict of interest".&lt;ref name=processing/&gt; In order to address any potential public perception issue, additional conditions were imposed in addition to the standard set of conditions. Accordingly, Leung's employment was to be confined to New World China Land, not represent his employer in dealings with the Government, would refrain from involvement in any Hong Kong related dealings of his direct employer, and not to disclose sensitive or classified information to his employer.&lt;ref name=processing/&gt; On 4 July 2008, the committee submitted its recommendation to the SCS to approve Leung's appointment, and the SCS duly gave her approval on 8 July, on the terms stipulated.&lt;ref name=processing/&gt;

== Reaction ==
For many citizens, the incident was proof that there was collusion between the government and big business. Controversies surrounded not only the suspicions of Leung's own conflict of interest, but also of the insensitivity of the committee which recommended the approval for him to take up his new job with a HK$3.12&amp;nbsp;million pay packet, plus bonus, so soon after his retirement.&lt;ref name=unrest/&gt; Mr. Justice [[Pang Kin-kee]], who chaired the vetting committee, was also himself criticised for conflict of interest for his close friendship with Leung. Political scientist Ma Ngok said "It is inevitable that the public will consider the advisory committee to be just a rubber stamp when the approval rate was 100%."&lt;ref name=unrest/&gt; [[Albert Cheng]] commented: "[the] controversial appointment is a political time bomb, which threatens to seriously undermine the authority of the administration."&lt;ref name="right?"&gt;{{Cite news
|title= Legal, but is it right?
|author=op-ed: Albert Cheng |pages= A13
|work=South China Morning Post|date= 9 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior Non-Expatriate Officers Association chairman Poon Wai-ming argued that the controversy arose from a lack of strict enforcement of the procedures, and not their inadequacies.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;  New World argued that they hired Leung in good faith after government clearance. [[Albert Chan]] of the [[League of Social Democrats]] and 50 members of the public filed a complaint with the [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (Hong Kong)|Independent Commission Against Corruption]] days after his appointment became public.&lt;ref name=unrest/&gt;

The [[Secretary for the Civil Service]] came under fire for approving an appointment that gives the strong appearance of a conflict of interest. [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Donald Tsang]] asked the Secretary for the Civil Service to account for the approval process in a written report.&lt;ref name="Standard20080808"&gt;{{Cite news

On 13 August 2008, ''[[Apple Daily]]'' reported that the [[Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office]] had asked the Hong Kong government to solve the problem on or before 24 August, and that the best way forward would be for Leung to resign from NWD.&lt;ref name=apple&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://appledaily.atnext.com/template/apple/art_main.cfm?iss_id=20080813&amp;sec_id=4104&amp;subsec_id=11866&amp;art_id=11469064|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815092258/http://www1.appledaily.atnext.com/template/apple/art_main.cfm?iss_id=20080813&amp;sec_id=4104&amp;subsec_id=11866&amp;art_id=11469064|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 August 2008|title=北京發功逼退梁展文|work=Apple Daily|location=Hong Kong|date=13 August 2008|accessdate=14 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''The Standard'' reports that the ''Apple'' assertions "could not be substantiated".&lt;ref name=snub&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=70201&amp;sid=20179446&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20080814&amp;sear_year=2008|title= Hiring snub to civil servants|work= The Standard|date= 14 August 2008|accessdate= 14 August 2008|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110522080148/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=70201&amp;sid=20179446&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20080814&amp;sear_year=2008|archivedate= 22 May 2011|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an unnamed top Beijing official in Hong Kong was quoted in the ''South China Morning Post'' as  warning, without specifically identifying the subject he was referring to, that conflicts among interest groups may threaten Hong Kong's stability if not properly handled.&lt;ref name=stability&gt;{{Cite news

== SCS report ==
On 15 August, the Civil Service Bureau issued the report requested by Donald Tsang where they admitted that they had not considered Leung's role in the Hung Hom Peninsula affair when approving his application,&lt;ref name=pressrelease&gt;{{Cite press release

New World Development announced in the early hours of 16 August that Leung had resigned from his post, and would not be seeking compensation from the government, for its "inappropriate handling".&lt;ref name=quits&gt;{{Cite news

== Political fallout ==
Yue lost credibility within and outside government circles as a result of the case, but said she hoped to stay in her position. Commentator Chris Yeung stated that Tsang's request for the bureaux to do their job again deals a body blow to the authority and image of Yue and the bureaux.&lt;ref name=rethink/&gt; A [[South China Morning Post|SCMP]]  editorial criticised the "glaring lack of political sense of some of our senior officials."&lt;ref name=editorial&gt;{{Cite news

Albert Cheng pointed to the composition of the four-man Advisory committee, saying that issues would have been flagged had it included pan-democrats instead of just establishment figures.&lt;ref name=serve&gt;{{Cite news
|title= To serve and collect
|author=op-ed: Albert Cheng |pages= A13
|work=South China Morning Post|date= 16 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were only muted calls for Secretary's resignation. Commentators suggested that parties feared that demands for Yue's resignation would alienate civil servants in the forthcoming LegCo elections.&lt;ref name=focus&gt;{{Cite news

The next day, Donald Tsang confirmed that Denise Yue would not have to resign. He was satisfied with her apology and with the explanations offered by her. Tsang ordered a committee, of which Yue was to be a member, to be set up to perform a sweeping review of the system to process applications for former civil servants. This sparked fears among civil servants that their job opportunities after retirement would be curtailed.&lt;ref name="SCMP20080817"&gt;{{Cite news

In an [[op-ed]], Christopher Cheung states that Leung was quickly sentenced by the court of public opinion, and was "dangerously close to mob rule". The facts of the case rested on guidelines introduced in January 2006 which "elevate public opinion to the level of tyranny", and whose rigid entry and exit criteria from the civil service stand in the way of modernising the civil service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8793">{{About|the concept of liberal paternalism, which is sometimes described as a form of soft paternalism|other uses of "soft paternalism"|paternalism}}

'''Libertarian paternalism''' is the idea that it is both possible and legitimate for private and public institutions to affect behavior while also respecting freedom of choice, as well as the implementation of that idea. The term was coined by behavioral economist [[Richard Thaler]] and legal scholar [[Cass Sunstein]] in a 2003 article in the ''American Economic Review''.&lt;ref&gt;Thaler, Richard and Sunstein, Cass. 2003. "Libertarian[sic!] Paternalism". ''The American Economic Review'' 93: 175–79.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors further elaborated upon their ideas in a more in-depth article published in the ''[[University of Chicago Law Review]]'' that same year.&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein, Cass; Thaler, Richard. 2003. "Libertarian Paternalism is Not an Oxymoron". ''University of Chicago Law Review'' 70(4): 1159–202.&lt;/ref&gt; They propose that libertarian paternalism is [[paternalism]] in the sense that "it tries to influence choices in a way that will make choosers better off, as judged by themselves" (p. 5); note and consider, the concept paternalism specifically requires a restriction of choice. It is [[libertarianism|libertarian]] in the sense that it aims to ensure that "people should be free to opt out of specified arrangements if they choose to do so" (p. 1161). The possibility to opt-out is said to "preserve freedom of choice" (p. 1182). Thaler and Sunstein published ''Nudge'', a book-length defense of this political doctrine, in 2008 (new edition 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Thaler, R.H. and Sunstein, C.R. 2009. ''[[Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth and Happiness]]''. 2d edition. New York: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Libertarian paternalism is similar to asymmetric paternalism, which refers to policies designed to help people who behave irrationally and so are not advancing their own interests, while interfering only minimally with people who behave rationally.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Camerer, Samuel Issacharoff, George Loewenstein, Ted O’Donoghue &amp; Matthew Rabin. 2003. "Regulation for Conservatives: Behavioral Economics and the Case for “Asymmetric Paternalism”. 151 ''University of Pennsylvania Law Review'' 101: 1211–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such policies are also asymmetric in the sense that they should be acceptable both to those who believe that people behave rationally and to those who believe that people often behave irrationally.

==Examples of policies==
Setting the default in order to exploit the [[default effect]] is a typical example of a soft paternalist policy. Countries that have an "opt-out" system for voluntary [[Organ donation#Opt-in vs. opt-out|organ donation]] (anyone who did not explicitly refuse to donate their organs in the case of accident is considered a donor) experience dramatically higher levels of organ donation consent, than countries with an opt-in system. [[Austria]], with an opt-out system, has a consent rate of 99.98%, while [[Germany]], with a very similar culture and economic situation, but an opt-in system, has a consent rate of only 12%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thaler |first=Richard H. |title=Opting In vs. Opting Out |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/business/economy/27view.html |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=4 July 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68tvQex6c?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/business/economy/27view.html?_r=1 |archivedate= 4 July 2012 |date=September 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cab drivers in [[New York City]] have seen an increase in tips from 10% to 22% after passengers had the ability to pay using credit cards on a device installed in the cab whose screen presented them with three default tip options, ranging from 15% to 30%.&lt;ref name="NYCcabs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/nyregion/08taxi.html|title=New York’s Cabbies Like Credit Cards? Go Figure|author=Michael M. Grynbaum|date=November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently, the default contribution rate for most tax-deferred retirement savings plans in the [[United States]] was zero, and despite the enormous tax advantages, many people took years to start contributing if they ever did. [[Behavioral economics|Behavioral economists]] attribute this to the "[[status quo bias]]", the common human resistance to changing one's behavior, combined with another common problem: the tendency to [[procrastination|procrastinate]].  Research by behavioral economists demonstrated, moreover, that firms which raised the default rate instantly and dramatically raised the contribution rates of their employees.&lt;ref&gt;Thaler, R.H. and Benartzi, S. 2004. "Save More Tomorrow: Using Behavioral Economics to Increase Employee Saving". ''Journal of Political Economy'' 112:164–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Raising default contribution rates is also an example of asymmetric paternalism. Those who are making an informed deliberate choice to put aside zero percent of their income in tax deferred savings still have this option, but those who were not saving simply out of inertia or due to procrastination are helped by higher default contribution rates.  It is also asymmetric in the second sense: If you do not believe that defaults matter, because you believe that people will make rational decisions about something as important as retirement saving, then you should not care about the default rate. If you believe that defaults matter, on the other hand, you should want to set defaults at the level that you believe will be best for the largest number of people.

==Criticism of the choice of term==
There has been much criticism of the ideology behind the term, ''libertarian paternalism''. For example, it has been argued that it fails to appreciate the traditional libertarian concern with [[coercion]] in particular, and instead focuses on freedom of choice in a wider sense.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Daniel B. 2004. "Statist Quo Bias" ''Economic Journal Watch'' 1: 260–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that, while libertarian paternalism aims to promote wellbeing, there may be more libertarian aims that could be promoted, such as maximizing future liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Gregory. 2004–2005. "Libertarian Paternalism Is an Oxymoron" ''Northwestern University Law Review'' 99: 1245–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1490">'''Lincoln''', manufactured by the company [[Pen-Link, Ltd.]], is a class of electronic [[surveillance|data interception]] products—including both computer hardware and software packages—whose function is to extract and analyze internet traffic for [[mass surveillance]] purposes, such as those outlined under the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]] (CALEA).

Lincoln systems enable law enforcement and intelligence agencies to monitor numerous types of intercepted electronic communications—including telephone (landline &amp; wireless), [[VoIP]], [[3G]] and [[Internet Protocol|IP]] (web/email/IM traffic).

Lincoln systems are generally implemented along with other Pen-Link products to enable features such as databases to store intercepted communications, mapping software (to monitor the locations of surveillance targets), visualization software, and [[social network analysis|link analysis]] features.

'''Mobile Home Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974''' or National Mobile Home Construction and Safety Standards Act is a [[Law of the United States|United States federal law]] establishing design and development [[safety standards]] for [[manufactured housing]] or [[prefabricated home]]s. The [[Codification (law)|codified law]] authorized [[stipulation]]s whereas any proposed safety standard shall be equitable for a particular type of [[mobile home]] with consideration of additional cost liabilities for the future [[Homeownership in the United States|homeownership]]. The [[Act of Congress]] endorsed violative [[Civil penalty|civil penalties]] and judicial review of Federal mobile home construction and safety standards developed by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]]. The Act mandated the establishment of the National Mobile Home Advisory Council and National Mobile Home Administration.

The S. 2538 [[Bill (law)|legislation]] appended the [[Housing and Community Development Act of 1974]] on February 27, 1974. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 was a significant congressional amendment to the [[Housing Act of 1937]]. The United States housing [[authorization bill]] was passed by the United States 93rd Congressional session and enacted into law by the [[Presidency of Gerald Ford|38th President of the United States]] Gerald Ford on August 22, 1974.

'''Movemento Estudantil Universitario''' ('''MEU''', ''University Student(s) Movement'' or ''Student Universitarian Movement'' in English language) was a student union representative of college students with presence in the universities of [[Galiza|Galicia]]. Born in December 2010, its main goal was a single, public, [[Galiza|Galician]], international and democratic university in [[Galiza|Galicia]].

==History==
In 1994, in reaction to what was perceived as the [[Galician People's Union]] control over the [[Comités Abertos de Faculdade|CAF]], a group of students created a new [[Students' union|student union]] called Movemento Estudantil Universitario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://estoutrasnotaspoliticas.blogspot.com.es/2006/12/breve-resenha-do-independentismo.html |title=ESTOUTRAS: Breve resenha do independentismo estudantil |publisher=Estoutrasnotaspoliticas.blogspot.com.es |date=2006-12-13 |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle 90s it was one of the most important student unions of [[Galiza|Galicia]]. The original MEU disappeared in the late 1990s due to the lack of new militants.&lt;ref&gt;* Beramendi, X.G. (2007): ''De provincia a nación. Historia do galeguismo político''. Xerais, [[Vigo]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 a new group of students, with the same motivations that those of the 1990s, decided to recover the project of the MEU. These group of students broke with the [[Comités]] and formed a new MEU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://renovarobng.org/?p=311 |accessdate=14 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304144412/http://renovarobng.org/?p=311 |archivedate=4 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/santiago/2010/12/15/0003_8910207.htm |title=El Movemento Estudantil Universitario escoge hoy su Executiva Nacional |publisher=Lavozdegalicia.es |date= |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Comités suffered other major split, that resulted in the formation of the more left-wing [[Galician Student League]]. The new MEU didn't have the success of the original one. In 2012 the organization gained a seat in the Council of the [[University of Santiago de Compostela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://praza.gal/movementos-sociais/1022/liga-estudantil-e-comites-maioritarios-no-claustro-da-usc/ |title=Liga Estudantil e Comités, maioritarios no claustro da USC - Praza Pública |publisher=Praza.gal |date= |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new MEIU disappeared between 2013 and 2014 but was not officially dissolved, like in the 90s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usc.es/gl/perfis/estudantes/asociacions/modules/asociacions/asociacion_0203.html |title=Movemento Estudantil Universitario - - USC |publisher=Usc.es |date= |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new MEU was linked with [[Máis Galiza]] (until 2012) and [[Compromiso por Galicia]] (2012–2014) and with their [[youth wing]], the [[Galician Nationalist Youth]].

'''Mãe Menininha do Gantois''' (10 February 1894 – 13 August 1986) also known as '''Mother Menininha do Gantois''', was a Brazilian spiritual leader ''(iyalorixá)'' and spiritual daughter of [[Orisha|orixá]] [[Oshun|Oxum]], who officiated for 64 years as the head of one of the most noted [[Candomblé]] temples, the [[Ilê Axé Iyá Omin Iyamassê]], or Terreiro do Gantois, of Brazil, located in Alto do Gantois in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Bahia]].{{Sfn|Appiah|Gates|2005|pp=755–56}}{{Sfn|Henry|2010|p=95}} She was instrumental in gaining legal recognition of Candomblé and its rituals, bringing an end to centuries of prejudice against Afro-Brazilians, who practiced their faith.{{sfn|Jestice|2004|p=579}} When she died on 13 August 1986, the State of Bahia declared a three-day state mourning in her honour,{{Sfn|Appiah|Gates|2005|p=756}} and the City Council of Salvador held a special session to pay tributes to her.&lt;ref name=Honour&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/bahia/noticia/2011/08/morte-de-mae-menininha-do-gantois-completa-25-anos-neste-sabado.html|title= Morte de Mãe Menininha do Gantois completa 25 anos neste sábado|date=13 August 2011|accessdate=5 December 2015|publisher= Globo 1|location=Salvador, Brazil}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Terreiro do Gantois temple has been declared a protected national monument.{{Sfn|Appiah|Gates|2005|p=756}}

==Biography==
Maria Escolástica da Conceição Nazaré Assunção was born on 10 February 1894 in Salvador, Bahia.&lt;ref name=Mariano /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brazil&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uniafro.xpg.com.br/biografia_mae_menininha.htm|title=The Mother little girl Gantois|accessdate=5 December 2015|publisher= Uniafro de Cultura Negra em Santa Catarina|location=São José, Brazil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her grand mother, who had baptized her, gave her the nickname as Menininha meaning "Little girl"&lt;ref name=Brazil/&gt; She was born into a matriarchal society to Maria da Glória{{#tag:ref|Maria da Glória's name is given as both Maria da Glória,&lt;ref name=Honour /&gt; Maria da Glória Nazaré, or Maria da Glória Nazareth{{sfn|Bay|Mann|2013|p=206}} in multiple sources. This convention is confusing in the context of the Afro-Brazilian matrilineal naming customs.

She was married to Alvaro MacDowell de Oliveira and they had two daughters. The elder daughter was Mãe [[Cleusa da Conceição Nazaré de Oliveira]], born in 1923, who was a doctor and who became the inherited Candomblé priestess of the temple after her mother's death. She died in 1998 and was succeeded by Menininha's other daughter, Mãe Carmem.&lt;ref name=Brazil/&gt;&lt;ref name="Order of Merit of Bahia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Governo faz homenagem póstuma a Mãe Cleusa por trabalho social|url=http://www.alba.ba.gov.br/noticias/Impressao.php?id=6529|publisher=Assembléia Legislativa do Estado da Bahia|accessdate=5 December 2015|location=Salvador da Bahia, Brazil|language=Portuguese|date=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times obit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schemo|first1=Diana Jean|title=Cleusa Millet Is Dead at 67; Nurtured Afro-Brazilian Faith|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/25/world/cleusa-millet-is-dead-at-67-nurtured-afro-brazilian-faith.html|accessdate=5 December 2015|publisher=The New York Times|date=25 October 1998|location=New York City, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; As spiritual heads of their temple, all of the Candomblé priestesses receive the honorific 'mãe', which in the [[Portuguese language]] means "mother".{{Sfn|Appiah|Gates|2005|p=755}}

==Career==
The temple, which she headed was established by her grandmother Mãe Pulquéria following a dispute over leadership from Engenho Velho, an older temple said to be one of the oldest Candomblé temple (1830 or even 100 years older) in Bahia which had been built by three freed African women. Two temples were built, one was the Terreiro do Gantois built in 1900 by Mãe Pulquéria and the other was Ile Axe Opo Afonja credited to Mãe Aninha.{{Sfn|Appiah|Gates|2005|p=755}} Mãe Pulquéria, who was the functional head of the Terreiro do Gantois, died suddenly in 1918.&lt;ref name=Brazil/&gt; As she had no children, her niece Maria da Glória Nazaré was designated as her successor, but Maria died in 1920 before assuming office.&lt;ref name="Mariano" /&gt; Then according to hierarchical rights the temple was given to Mother Menininha. This process was confirmed by deities [[Oshosi|Oxóssi]], [[Shango]], Oshun and [[Babalú-Ayé]]. Once chosen and confirmed in 1922 Menininha became the head of the Candomblé do Gantois.&lt;ref name=Brazil/&gt; She dedicated her life to the temple and for the cause of the African religion of Candomblé which represented to her the "last stronghold of the black dignity". She faced persecution at the hands of the Brazilian government and even incarceration, as well as being subjected to harassment. She defended the African-Brazilian traditions of worship at the Terreiro do Gantois and other Terreiros at [[Engenho Velho]] and [[Casa Branca, São Paulo|Casa Branca]].&lt;ref name=Brazil/&gt; Her struggle, in association with other well known candomblé priesteses like Stella de Oxossi, asserted the Africanness of Candombé, stressing the fact that their religion was not the same as [[Roman Catholicism]].{{Sfn|Appiah|Gates|2005|p=756}}

One of the reasons she became prominent was that she initiated hundreds of "daughters" into the faith,{{sfn|Jestice|2004|p=578}} as well as artists,{{sfn|Johnson|2002|p=10}} and invited the academic community to study the roots of the religion.{{sfn|Parés|Sansi|2011|p=45}} One of those academics, [[Ruth Landes]] compiled her findings and published a book,&lt;ref name=Andreson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andreson|first1=Jamie Lee|title=Ruth Landes e Edison Carneiro: matriarcado e etnografia nos candomblés da Bahia (1938–9)|journal=Revista de História da UEG|volume=2|issue=1|date=January–July 2013|publisher=Universidade Federal da Bahia|url=http://www.revista.ueg.br/index.php/revistahistoria/article/download/1585/969|pages=236–261|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''City of Women'' (1947) discussing how the racial policies of the government were intertwined with the Candomblé religious rites.&lt;ref name=Glenn &gt;{{cite web|last1=Glenn|first1=James R.|title=Register to the Papers of Ruth Landes|url=http://anthropology.si.edu/naa/fa/landes.pdf|website=National Anthropological Archives|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antônio Carlos Magalhães]], a powerful senator from Bahia; [[Carybé]], the illustrator; and {{Interlanguage link multi|Edson Carneiro|pt}} and [[Pierre Verger]], two other anthropologists who studied Afro-Brazilian communities, were also prominent connections used by Menininha to further study and promote the validity of Candomblé.{{sfn|Jestice|2004|p=579}} These studies were influential in furthering research on the Nigerian roots of the religion,{{sfn|Parés|Sansi|2011|p=45}} but at the same time brought criticism from other temples in the faith that Menininha was exploiting the religion.{{sfn|Johnson|2002|p=10}} However, her success in obtaining legalization of the religion in the 1970s facilitated the first freedom to practice their faith in hundreds of years and began the process of eliminating prejudice against other Afro-Brazilian faiths.{{sfn|Jestice|2004|p=579}}

==Legacy==
Menininha died at the age of 92 on 13 August 1986. At the special session held in the City Council of Salvador to commemorate her death, Edvaldo Britto, Deputy Mayor; Pedro Godinho, President of the House; her friends; and {{Interlanguage link multi|Mabel Veloso|pt}} attended. Veloso paid a tribute to the mother by highlighting her role as the priestess in leading the resistance and fighting against discrimination and religious faith.&lt;ref name="Honour" /&gt; Her successor to the temple was her daughter Cleusa who was chosen as priestess in 1989. Upon Cleusa's death, the deities chose her younger sister, {{Interlanguage link multi|Mãe Carmem de Òsàlá|pt|3=Mãe Carmem}} to succeed her.&lt;ref name="Mariano" /&gt; Menininha became a symbol of motherhood and spiritual daughter of the Orixa Oxum. Her ritual chair, which appears like a throne, is placed at the entry to the city museum in Salvador.{{Sfn|Henry|2010|p=755}}

== Poems ==
Many songs have been written paryear songs seeking her blessings and spiritual guidance. [[Beth Carvalho]], a famous singer paid tribute to her in his composition titled '''O Encanto do Gantois'', in 1985. One of these poems reads:&lt;ref name=Brazil/&gt;{{Sfn|Henry|2010|p=755}}
 
'''Prayer to Mother Menininha'''&lt;br&gt;Oh my mother&lt;br&gt;My Mother Menininha&lt;br&gt;Oh my mother&lt;br&gt;The little girl Gantois&lt;br&gt;The most beautiful star, &lt;br&gt; huh? It's in the Gantois &lt;br&gt;And the brightest sun, &lt;br&gt;huh? It's in the Gantois&lt;br&gt;The beauty of the world,&lt;br&gt; huh?

It's in the Gantois &lt;br&gt;Olorun who sent &lt;br&gt;This daughter of Oshun &lt;br&gt;Take care of us &lt;br&gt; And all that is &lt;br&gt;Olorun who sent ô ô &lt;br&gt;Now yeh yeh ô ...&lt;br&gt;Now yeh yeh ô

'''Nonviolence International Southeast Asia (NISEA)''' is a part of [[Nonviolence International]] and was established in [[Bangkok]] in 1992 with the cooperation of regional partners with the aim of creating a community of peace activists. It is a member of the [[International Action Network on Small Arms]] (IANSA) targeting armed violence and weapon reduction in [[Thailand]] and [[Cambodia]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nonviolence International Southeast Asia Financial Summary 2004|url=http://www.nonviolenceinternational.net/seasia/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=37&amp;Itemid=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 2004, NISEA maintained a strong financial position of an income of 3.5 million [[Thai Baht]] through various grants and contributions, whereby 900,000 [[Thai baht|Baht]] was spent on [[Southeast Asia]] Small Arms Reduction Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Network on Small Arms|url=http://www.iansa.org/member/nonviolence-international-south-east-asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2005, NISEA was granted [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] in Special Consultative Status with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC).

==Mission==
'''Nonviolence International South East Asia (NISEA)''' strives to shape [[South East Asia]]n societies to make them choose nonviolent methods as a neutral response to conflicts. Its mission includes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nonviolence International Southeast Asia Missions|url=http://www.nonviolenceinternational.net/seasia/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=37&amp;Itemid=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
::# Increasing understanding and appreciation of nonviolent vision, strategy and methods; 
::# Empowering people by enhancing capacities to protect rights and to ensure ownership of and participation in various processes affecting people's lives; and 
::# Building and supporting a peace constituency that aims to change unjust structures, institutions, policies and laws through long-term nonviolent means.

==Activities==
'''NISEA''' aims to fulfill its mission through three core programs that focus on education, empowerment and structural change.

===Ending Armed Violence Program===
The Ending Armed Violence Program focuses on making communities safer through an in depth understanding of why armed violence occurs, as well as strengthening a peace community that advocates an end to armed violence. NISEA has participated actively in various peace advocacies aiming to ban [[land mine]]s, render the misuse and proliferation of arms and its impact on communities, change people's perception and behavior toward violence, engage non-state armed groups in the areas of [[Human Rights]] and [[International humanitarian law]], seek assistance for victims and survivors of armed violence, and propagate a culture of peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nonviolence International Southeast Asia Core Programs|url=http://www.nonviolenceinternational.net/seasia/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In relation to stopping the use and proliferation of [[small arms]] in [[Thailand]], NISEA had:

::#Worked closely with other [[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGO)s and civil societies of countries to unravel and identify the presence and/or use of small arms during disappearance incidences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nonviolence Justice Disappeared, Exploring the Links of Arms Trade, Impunity. Nonviolence International Southeast Asia, 2007|url=http://www.nonviolenceinternational.net/images/stories/Justice%20Disappeared%20Final%20layout-s.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726052220/http://www.nonviolenceinternational.net/images/stories/Justice%20Disappeared%20Final%20layout-s.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::#Coordinated the Million Faces Campaign and took the lead in gathering photos and signatures to support an Arms Trade Treaty.
::# Worked with [[Amnesty International Thailand]] and the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace of Thailand on the Million Faces Campaign

Despite efforts made to tackle the issues of armed violence in Thailand, it was reported in 2010 that death due to armed conflicts remained prevalent of about a loss of 4000 lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amnesty international 2010 Annual Report|url=http://report2010.amnesty.org/sites/default/files/AIR2010_EN.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308020824/http://report2010.amnesty.org/sites/default/files/AIR2010_EN.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reclaiming Rights Program===
Reclaiming Rights Program seeks to empower the marginalized through campaigning, networking, and solidarity work. Currently, NISEA is concerned with the conflict in [[Southern Thailand]] and is involved in creating spaces for civil society actors to have greater participation in promoting peaceful means to end violence. It also facilitates discussion and encourages suggestions with regular reports on national security issues published on its website.

===Nonviolence in Action Program===
Nonviolence in Action Program seeks to draw lessons and best practices to enhance capacities through education, training, and multi-media resource material development, as it believes that every individual and community has an inherent capacity to handle and prevent armed conflicts nonviolently.

'''Onyx''' is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] intelligence gathering system maintained by the Federal Intelligence Service - [[Swiss intelligence agencies|Nachrichtendienst des Bundes]] (NDB). The costs of the system are not public, but the amount of 100 million [[Swiss franc]]s has been mentioned several times,&lt;ref&gt;Valérie de Graffenried, ''[http://www.letemps.ch/dossiers/dossiersarticle.asp?ID=171462 Onyx et ses «grandes oreilles»]''. ''[[Le Temps]]'', 9 January 2006 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular in 2000 by [[Werner Marti]], [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|SP]] deputy to the [[National Council (Switzerland)]]. In March 2005, journalist [[Urs Paul Engeler]] estimated that the costs (hidden in various military construction budgets) reached 400 million CHF.&lt;ref&gt;Urs Paul Engeler, ''[http://www.weltwoche.ch/artikel/Default.asp?AssetID=10344 Was sagen Sie jetzt?]''. ''[[Weltwoche]]'' 10/05, March 2005 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Onyx system was launched in 2000, originally under the name SATOS-3 (the SATOS 1 and 2 systems were started in 1992, in particular to intercept faxes), and was completed in late 2005.

==Purpose==
The goal of the system is to monitor both civil and military communications, such as telephone, fax or Internet traffic, carried by satellite. Onyx uses lists of keywords to filter the intercepted content for information of interest, and the choice of keywords by the intelligence community must be approved by an independent commission. The system is not supposed to monitor internal communications; however, the monitoring of a communication between a person in Switzerland and someone in another country is allowed.&lt;ref name="parliamentreport"&gt;[http://www.parlament.ch/f/print/ed-pa-gpd-onyx-d.pdf Système d'interception des communications par satellite du Départment fédéral de la défense, de la protection de la population et des sports (projet "Onyx")]. Report from the [[National Council of Switzerland|National Council]] (Parliament) on Onyx, 10 November 2003 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Swiss Federal Council]] has indicated that Onyx is not linked to other foreign systems such as [[ECHELON]]; according to the Council, the confusion and rumours about this issue are due to the sale by [[Swisscom]] to [[Verestar]] (now [[SES Americom]]) of the ground satellite communication station of [[Leuk]] (next to the Onyx site) in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.parlament.ch/f/suche/pages/geschaefte.aspx?gesch_id=20031046 Espionnage économique sur le territoire suisse au profit des Etats-Unis]'' Answer by the Swiss Federal Council to a question of Alexander Baumann, member of the National Council. 20 August 2003 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the system is controlled by an independent control authority composed of members of the federal administration.&lt;ref&gt;Swiss Federal Department of Defense.

{{Liberalism sidebar}}
The '''Oxford Manifesto''', drawn up in April 1947 by representatives from 19 liberal political parties at [[Wadham College]] in [[Oxford]], led by [[Salvador de Madariaga]], is a document that describes the basic political principles of the [[Liberal International]].

Fifty years on, in 1997, the Liberal International returned to Oxford and issued a supplement to the original manifesto, called ''The Liberal Agenda for the 21st century'', describing Liberal policies in greater detail. It was adopted by the 48th Congress of Liberal International, which was held on 27–30 November 1997 in the [[Oxford Town Hall]].

==Text==
&lt;poem style="border: 2px solid #d6d2c5; background-color: #f9f4e6; padding: 1em;"&gt;
We, Liberals of nineteen countries assembled at Oxford at a time of disorder, poverty, famine and fear caused by two World Wars; 
Convinced that this condition of the world is largely due to the abandonment of liberal principles; 
Affirm our faith in this Declaration:

::'''I'''
1. Man is first and foremost a being endowed with the power of independent thought and action, and with the ability to distinguish right from wrong.
2. Respect for the human person and for the family is the true basis of society.
3. The State is only the instrument of the community; it should assume no power which conflicts with the fundamental rights of the citizens and with the conditions essential for a responsible and creative life, namely:
:Personal freedom, guaranteed by the independence of the administration of law and justice;
:Freedom of worship and liberty of conscience;
:Freedom of speech and of the press;
:Freedom to associate or not to associate;
:Free choice of occupation;
:The opportunity of a full and varied education, according to ability and irrespective of birth or means;
:The right to private ownership of property and the right to embark on individual enterprise;
:Consumer's free choice and the opportunity to reap the full benefit of the productivity of the soil and the industry of man;
:Security from the hazards of sickness, unemployment, disability and old age;
:Equality of rights between men and women.
4. These rights and conditions can be secured only by true democracy. True democracy is inseparable from political liberty and is based on the conscious, free and enlightened consent of the majority, expressed through a free and secret ballot, with due respect for the liberties and opinions of minorities.

::'''II'''
1. The suppression of economic freedom must lead to the disappearance of political freedom. We oppose such suppression, whether brought about by State ownership or control or by private monopolies, cartels and trusts. We admit State ownership only for those undertakings which are beyond the scope of private enterprise or in which competition no longer plays its part.
2. The welfare of the community must prevail and must be safeguarded from the abuse of power by sectional interests.
3. A continuous betterment of the conditions of employment, and of the housing and environment of the workers is essential. The rights, duties and interests of labour and capital are complementary; organised consultation and collaboration between employers and employed is vital to the well-being of industry.

::'''III'''
Service is the necessary complement of freedom and every right involves a corresponding duty. If free institutions are to work effectively, every citizen must have a sense of moral responsibility towards his fellow men and take an active part in the affairs of the community.

::'''IV'''
War can be abolished and world peace and economic prosperity restored only if all nations fulfil the following conditions:
:a) Loyal adherence to a world organisation of all nations, great and small, under the same law and equity, and with power to enforce strict observance of all international obligations freely entered into;
:b) Respect for the right of every nation to enjoy the essential human liberties;
:c) Respect for the language, faith, laws and customs of national minorities;
:d) The free exchange of ideas, news, goods and services between nations, as well as freedom of travel within and between all countries, unhampered by censorship, protective trade barriers and exchange regulations;
:e) The development of the backward areas of the world, with the collaboration of their inhabitants, in their true interests and in the interests of the world at large.

We call upon all men and women who are in general agreement with these ideals and principles to join us in an endeavour to win their acceptance throughout the world.
&lt;/poem&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5745">'''Physics First''' is an educational program in the USA, that teaches a basic [[physics]] course in the ninth grade (usually 15-year-olds),&lt;ref&gt;See, for example [http://www.physicsfirstmo.org/ a National Science Foundation-funded project for 80 physics teachers 2009-2014]&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the [[biology]] course which is more standard in public schools. This course relies on the limited math skills that the students have from pre-algebra and algebra I.  With these skills students study a broad subset of the introductory physics canon with an emphasis on topics which can be experienced kinesthetically or without deep mathematical reasoning. Furthermore, teaching physics first is better suited for English Language Learners, who would be overwhelmed by the substantial vocabulary requirements of Biology. 

Physics First began as an organized movement among educators around 1990, and has been slowly catching on throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapt.org/Resources/policy/physicsfirst.cfm American Association of Physics Teachers, College Park, MD, April 13, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;   The most prominent movement championing Physics First is [[Leon Lederman]]'s ARISE (American Renaissance in Science Education). 

Many proponents of Physics First argue that turning this order around lays the foundations for better understanding of chemistry, which in turn will lead to more comprehension of biology.  Due to the tangible nature of most introductory physics experiments, Physics First also lends itself well to an introduction to inquiry-based science education, where students are encouraged to probe the workings of the world in which they live.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapt.org/aboutaapt/ennouncer/upload/physicsfirst.pdf Physics First: an informational guide for teachers, school administrators, parents, scientists, and the public --  upload file from the American Association of Physics Teachers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of high schools which have implemented "physics first" do so by way of offering two separate classes, at two separate levels: simple physics concepts in 9th grade, followed by more advanced physics courses in 11th or 12th grade.  In schools with this curriculum, nearly all 9th grade students take a "Physical Science", or "Introduction to Physics Concepts" course.  These courses focus on concepts that can be studied with skills from pre-algebra and algebra I.  With these ideas in place, students then can be exposed to ideas with more physics related content in chemistry, and other science electives.  After this, students are then encouraged to take an 11th or 12th grade course in physics, which does use more advanced math, including vectors, geometry, and more involved algebra.

There is a large overlap between the Physics First movement, and the movement towards teaching [[conceptual physics]] - teaching physics in a way that emphasizes a strong understanding of physical principles over problem-solving ability.  Many Physics First programs use the popular textbook "Conceptual Physics" by [[Paul G. Hewitt]].

==Criticism==
American public schools traditionally teach biology in the first year of high school, chemistry in the second, and physics in the third. The belief is that this order is more accessible, largely because biology can be taught with less mathematics, and will do the most toward providing some [[scientific literacy]] for the largest number of students.

In addition, many scientists and educators argue that freshmen do not have an adequate background in mathematics to be able to fully comprehend a complete physics curriculum, and that therefore quality of a physics education is lost. While physics requires knowledge of vectors and some basic [[trigonometry]],  many students in the Physics First program take the course in conjunction with [[geometry]]. They suggest that instead students first take [[biology]] and [[chemistry]] which are less [[mathematics]]-intensive so that by the time they are in their junior year, students will be advanced enough in mathematics with either an [[algebra]] 2 or [[pre-calculus]] education to be able to fully grasp the concepts presented in physics. Some argue this even further, saying that at least calculus should be a prerequisite for physics.

Others point out that, for example, secondary school students will never study the advanced physics that underlies chemistry in the first place.  “[I]nclined planes (frictionless or not) didn't come up in ... high school chemistry class ... and the same can be said for some of the chemistry that really makes sense of biological phenomena.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2007/07/27/brief-remarks-on-physics-first/ Brief remarks on 'physics first' and high school science.]&lt;/ref&gt;  For physics to be relevant to a chemistry course, students have to develop a truly fundamental understanding of the concepts of energy, force, and matter, beyond the context of specific applications like the inclined plane.

'''Piero Simondo''' (born 25 August 1928) is an [[Italy|Italian]] artist&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=urQV-TkAaoIC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=%22Piero+Simondo&amp;lr=&amp;cd=1 The consul] Ralph Rumney - 2002 - Page 36.&lt;/ref&gt; born in [[Cosio di Arroscia]], [[Liguria]], [[Italy]].

In [[Alba, Piedmont|Alba]], [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]], [[Italy]], with [[Asger Jorn]] and [[Giuseppe Pinot Gallizio]] he founded the ''Laboratory of immaginiste experiences'' as part of the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]] (IMIB).

He edited ''Eristica'' the magazine published by IMIB and September 1956 he organised the ''First World-wide Conference of the Free Artists'', with Jorn, Gallizio and [[Elena Verrone]]. He married Verrone two years later.&lt;ref name=Hussey&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IJtIAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Piero+Simondo&amp;dq=%22Piero+Simondo&amp;lr=&amp;cd=5 The game of war: the life and death of Guy Debord] Andrew Hussey  - 2002 - Page 116&lt;/ref&gt; At the Cultural Union of Turin he helped put on a demonstration [[unitary urbanism]] in December 1956.

In the summer of 1957 he took a holiday in his house in Cosio d' Arroscia. Here, with [[Michèle Bernstein]], [[Guy Debord]], Pinot Gallizio, Asger Jorn, [[Walter Olmo]], [[Ralph Rumney]] and Elena Verrone the [[Situationist International]] was founded on 28 July. Following a row with Debord,&lt;ref name=Hussey /&gt; he left the organisation with Olmo and Verrone.

In 1962 he founded in Turin the CIRA (International Center for an Institute of Artistic Research) with the purpose to expand the proposals of the Alba Laboratory.

From 1968 he continued with his own artistic activity.

From 1972 to 1996 Simondo worked at the [[University of Turin]] where he organised experimental activities at the Institute of Pedagogy. He held the chair of Methodology and Didactics of the Audovisual Medium .

Publications by Simondo include:
* ''Ars vetus, ars modernorum'', SEI, Turin 1971
* ''What were the experiences of the Alba Laboratory'', Libreria Editrice Sileno, Opuscola, Genoa 1986
* ''The Laboratory as Situation'', Tirrenia Stampatori, Turin 1987

'''The Ralahine Commune''' was a co-operative society founded in 1831 on the estate of [[John Vandeleur]] at Ralahine, [[Newmarket-on-Fergus]], [[County Clare]], [[Ireland]]. In an attempt to keep his tenants away from secret societies like the “[[Ribbonmen]]”, he brought a [[socialist]] named [[Edward Thomas Craig]] from England to advise him on the establishment of the [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]], which came into existence on 7 November 1831. 	 	

== History ==
The purpose of the commune was to acquire common capital or a common wealth, in order to protect its members against the evils of old age and sickness, to achieve the mental and moral improvement of its adult members and to educate their children. The commune consisted of twenty-two single adult men, seven married men and their wives, five single women, four orphan boys, three orphan girls and five infants under the age of nine. It was governed by a committee of nine people, elected twice a year. Under an agreement between Vandeleur and the commune, the estate and property were to remain his at a rent of seven hundred pounds per annum to the commune, until they could afford to buy it. The commune was paid two hundred pounds a year for stock and equipment.

A list of rules were written up and each member of the commune had to live by them. Alcohol, tobacco and snuff were banned, as was gambling of any kind. The members had to work twelve hours a day in summer and from dawn to dusk in winter, with one hour break for dinner.

Instead of money the workers were paid “labour notes” which they could spend in the co-operative store. In this way the commune would be more self-sufficient as the members would be buying goods they themselves had worked to produce. If they wished to spend money outside the commune the treasurer would change the labour notes into coin for them. The commune prospered for a time and 29 new members joined. New machinery was bought and the first mowing machine in Ireland was introduced by the Ralahine Commune.

After two years however, it collapsed. Vandeleur’s reckless lifestyle and his gambling habit finally brought an end to the experiment. After losing all his possessions through gambling the members of the commune were helpless to save themselves. The agreement they had signed with Vandeleur regarding his possession of the land meant that the commune was seized and they were duly evicted. The members of the commune met for the last time on 23 November 1833 and placed on record a declaration of “the contentment, peace and happiness they had experienced for two years under the arrangements introduced by Mr. Vandeleur and Mr. Craig and which through no fault of the Association was now at an end”.

The '''Revolutionary Proletarian Army''', also known by the [[acronym]] '''RPA''', was the military wing of the [[Revolutionary Workers' Party (Philippines)|Rebolusyonaryong Partido ng Manggagawà ng Pilipinas]] (RPM-P), a [[communist party]] that split from the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name=peace&gt;{{cite web | author =Peace Talk Philippines | title =Background of the GPH and RPMP/RPA/ABB Peace Process | url=https://peacetalkphilippines.wordpress.com/peace-tables/rpmprpa-abb/ | accessdate = 3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|CPP-NPA-NDF rebellion}}
{{main|Second Great Rectification Movement}}
The ''Rebolusyonaryong Partido ng Manggagawà ng Pilipinas'' ("Revolutionary Workers' Party of the Philippines") was established after the [[Negros Island|Negros]] Regional Party Committee of the [[New People's Army]] broke away from the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] as a result of an ideological split in 1996. It organized its military arm two months after the split, calling it the Revolutionary Proletarian Army. The [[Metro Manila]]-based [[Alex Boncayao Brigade]], which also broke away from the New People's Army, allied itself with the RPA the year after, forming the '''Revolutionary Proletarian Army - Alex Boncayao Brigade''' (RPA-ABB).

==Activities==
The Revolutionary Proletarian Army - Alex Boncayao Brigade engaged in peace negotiations brokered by [[Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.]]&lt;ref name=utusan&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[Utusan Malaysia]] | title =Gunmen kill former Philippine rebel leader | date = 28 September 2004 | url =http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2004&amp;dt=0928&amp;pub=Utusan_Express&amp;sec=World&amp;pg=wo_08.htm | accessdate = 4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the government of [[Joseph Estrada]] in 1999; a [[truce]] was established in December 2000. This development prompted a vehement condemnation from [[Filemon Lagman]], who once controlled the Alex Boncayao Brigade; in a [[press release]] he branded Arturo Tabara of the RPA and Nilo dela Cruz, the head of the ABB as "scoundrels masquerading as revolutionaries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Lagman | first =Popoy | title =Tabara and Dela Cruz: Scoundrels Masquerading as Revolutionaries | url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/54a/202.html | date = 27 December 1999 | accessdate = 4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2003, relations between the RPA-ABB and the Communist Party of the Philippines had deteriorated to the point where the [[New People's Army]], the CPP's military wing began launching attacks on the RPA-ABB.&lt;ref name=mp&gt;{{cite web | author = Military Periscope | title = Revolutionary Proletarian Army-Alex Boncayao Brigade | url=http://apps.militaryperiscope.com/Terrorism/ShowGroup.aspx?group=468 | accessdate = 4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arturo Tabara, RPM-P chairman, was assassinated in 2004 in [[Manila]].&lt;ref name=utusan/&gt;

In 2007 an apparent split occurred between two factions within the RPA-ABB. Nilo dela Cruz of the Alex Boncayao Brigade was expelled by the faction headed by Stephen Paduano and Veronica Tabara, Arturo Tabara's wife. Dela Cruz reciprocated the action, expelling Paduano. Both factions of the RPA-ABB carried on using the same name.&lt;ref name=mp/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 =Ombion | first1 =Karl G. | last2 =Pauyon | first2 =Richard | title =RPA-ABB Headed for Split? | url=http://bulatlat.com/main/2007/05/26/rpa-abb-headed-for-split/ | accessdate = 4 November 2017 | date = 26 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 2013, the RPA-ABB was reported to have changed its name to ''Kapatiran para sa Progresong Panlipunan'' ("Brotherhood for Social Progress") and stated that it had renounced violence as a method of advancing its cause. Paduano resigned as national commander of the RPA-ABB and ran for Congress during the [[Philippine general election, 2013|2013 Philippine general election]] under the ''Abang Lingkod'' [[Party-list proportional representation|party-list]].&lt;ref name=mp/&gt; He took his oath of office in May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Gomez | first =Carla P. | title =Breakaway rebel now member of House | publisher =[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] | date = 30 May 2014 | url =http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/606724/breakaway-rebel-now-member-of-house | accessdate = 4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Democratic Front of the Philippines]] issued a statement condemning his election into the [[Congress of the Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Fernandez | first =Frank | title =Installation of Stephen Paduano as Congressman, a political accommodation of US-Aquino Regime  | url=https://www.ndfp.org/installation-of-stephen-paduano-as-congressman-a-political-accommodation-of-us-aquino-regime/ | date=18 June 2014 | accessdate = 4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, the peace deal signed by the RPA-ABB with the Estrada administration remains to be fully implemented. Nilo dela Cruz and a group of former RPA-ABB members calling themselves "Democratic Front for Filipinism" issued a statement supporting [[Rodrigo Duterte]]'s [[Philippine Drug War|war on drugs]], and his "revolution against the [[Business oligarch|oligarchs]] and the exploiters of the Filipino masses".&lt;ref name=mp/&gt;

'''Robert of Bassunvilla''' (also '''Basunvilla''' and '''Bassonville''') (died 15 September 1182) was the count of [[Conversano]] (from 1138) and [[Loritello]] (from 1154, as Robert III). His family had a long history in [[Vassonville]], near [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]].

Robert (II) was the son of [[Robert I of Bassunvilla]], who had been granted Conversano by [[Roger II]]. Robert inherited this possession on his father's death. Roger II had cause later to confiscate the county of Loritello from [[William of Loritello|William]], his own relative. On his deathbed, he asked his son [[William I of Sicily|William I]] to appoint Robert count of Loritello, a quasi-autonomous post. Soon however, he was implicated (truly or falsely) in rebellion and fled first to the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman imperial]] court of [[Frederick Barbarossa]] and then the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine imperial]] court of [[Manuel I Comnenus]]. He may have laid claim to the throne, on the basis of a forged will. He had the assistance of [[John Doukas (general under Manuel I)|John Ducas]] when he returned to lead the revolt of 1155–1156, but the Byzantine general [[Michael Palaeologus (general)|Michael Palaeologus]] died at [[Bari]] and William defeated the imperial troops.

By the [[Treaty of Benevento]] of 1156, [[Pope Adrian IV]] guaranteed Robert's right to leave the kingdom peacefully, but he renewed instead his designs on the land of the [[diocese of Penne]]. In 1157 he was encouraged in his rebellious efforts by a new emissary of Manuel I.  This was Alexius Axuch, the son of Manuel's chief advisor [[John Axuch]].&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Though his [[constable]], [[Richard of Mandra]], was captured, he evaded the royal army and continued in defiance of William I's authority. In 1161, he conquered much territory to the south. William responded by chasing him from [[Taranto]] and almost razing [[Salerno]]. In 1163, however, he was forced to flee again to Barbarossa.

In 1167, he was with the army of [[Rainald of Dassel]] at the [[Battle of Monte Porzio]] on 29 May, when a great Roman army was defeated.

In 1169, [[Margaret of Navarre]], [[regent]] of [[William II of Sicily|William II]] and widow of William I, and her council of advisors restored Robert to all his former possessions. His widow [[Adelisa of Conversano|Adelisa]], daughter of Roger II, inherited Conversano.

The '''Rubicon speech''' was delivered by South African President [[P. W. Botha]] on the evening of 15 August 1985 in [[Durban]]. The world was anticipating Botha to announce major reforms in his government including abolishing the [[apartheid]] system and the release of [[Nelson Mandela]].&lt;ref name="sahistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/pw-botha-gives-rubicon-speech-durban|title=PW Botha gives the &amp;quot;Rubicon&amp;quot; Speech in Durban &amp;#124; South African History Online|publisher=sahistory.org.za|accessdate=2014-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the speech Botha actually delivered at the time did none of this.
==Background==
After a long period of isolation and strained diplomatic relations between [[South Africa]] and the international community, the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] decided to hold a meeting to bring about reforms in the government. However, the meeting was shrouded in secrecy and mystery, and Botha was reported to have kept quiet and to have not participated even though he was present. This was taken as a sign that he was approving of the proposed changes. There were also reports that Botha did not participate due to his doctor's orders to avoid emotional outburst and not to engage in discussions that might upset him.&lt;ref name="mg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2012-10-26-00-the-day-apartheid-started-dying|title=The day apartheid started dying &amp;#124; Opinion &amp;#124; Analysis &amp;#124; Mail &amp;amp; Guardian|publisher=mg.co.za|accessdate=2014-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the final draft of the original agreed speech, which would be named the "Prog speech" ("Prog" being short for the [[Progressive Federal Party]], then in opposition), and which would have recognized black human dignity, eradicated all forms of discrimination, and created equal opportunities, the nature of the speech, in conjunction with the news that a US bank was threatening to call in its loan, made Botha feel that he was being forced to capitulate to the revolutionary movements. Botha, whose fierce will had earned him the name "Die Groot Krokodil" (The Great Crocodile), simply refused and said he was not going to make that speech but was going to draft his own.&lt;ref name="mg"/&gt;
==The speech==
Due to its anticipation and publicity by different international media houses, the speech was delivered live to a worldwide audience of over 200&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="mg"/&gt; Botha clearly stated that he was not willing to change his position regarding the apartheid system and that [[Nelson Mandela]] would not be released from prison.&lt;ref name="nelsonmandela"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/index.php/site/q/03lv01538/04lv01600/05lv01638/06lv01639.htm|title=Address by State President P. W. Botha, August 15, 1985 - The O'Malley Archives|publisher=nelsonmandela.org|accessdate=2014-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Aftermath==
The speech had serious ripple effects to the economy of South Africa and it also caused South Africa to be even more isolated by the international community. The [[South African rand|rand]] fell drastically against major currencies and the economy continued to shrink rapidly in growth until after the democratic handover of power a decade later.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rise, Fall, and Legacy of Apartheid|author=Louw, P.E.|date=2004|publisher=Praeger|isbn=9780275983116|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7XTgSQ4bUOkC|page=72|accessdate=2014-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cplo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cplo.org.za/?wpdmdl=55&amp;&amp;ind=0|title=http://www.cplo.org.za/?wpdmdl=55&amp;&amp;ind=0|publisher=cplo.org.za|accessdate=2014-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="businesstech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businesstech.co.za/news/general/21665/a-history-of-south-africas-currency/|title=A history of South Africa&amp;#8217;s currency|publisher=businesstech.co.za|accessdate=2014-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Secretariat of Agriculture and Rural Development''' ({{lang-es | Secretaría de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural}}; '''SADER''') is [[Mexico]]'s [[agriculture ministry]]. The current secretary is [[Víctor Manuel Villalobos Arámbula]].

==History==

The secretariat traces its roots to 1917, when it was established as the ''Secretaría de Agricultura y Fomento'' (Secretariat of Agriculture and Development). The name changed in 1946 to ''Secretaría de Agricultura y Ganadería'' (Secretariat of Agriculture and Ranching), in 1976 to ''Secretaría de Agricultura y Recursos Hidráulicos'' (Secretariat of Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources), and again in 1994 to ''Secretaría de Agricultura, Ganadería y Desarrollo Rural'' (Secretariat of Agriculture, Ranching and Rural Development).
In 2000, the name changed to the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food ({{lang-es | Secretaría de Agricultura, Ganadería, Desarrollo Rural, Pesca y Alimentación}}, SAGARPA).

During the presidency of [[Enrique Peña Nieto]], [[Enrique Martínez y Martínez]] served as the initial secretary. He left the post in 2015 to become Mexico's ambassador to Cuba and was replaced by [[José Eduardo Calzada Rovirosa]], the former [[Governor of Querétaro]]. [[Baltazar Hinojosa Ochoa]] finished out the Peña Nieto sexenio as the head of SAGARPA.

As part of changes coinciding with the presidency of [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]], SAGARPA became SADER on December 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.jornada.com.mx/ultimas/2018/11/30/avion-presidencial-saldra-de-mexico-el-lunes-convocatoria-para-venta-9917.html|work=La Jornada|date=30 November 2018|title=Avión presidencial saldrá de México; el lunes, convocatoria para venta|first=Alma E.|last=Muñoz|accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social conservatism in the United States''' is a political ideology focused on the preservation of traditional values and beliefs, hearkening back to values believed to be present at the American founding. It focuses on a concern with moral and social values which proponents of the ideology see as degraded in modern society by social democracy and liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Case for Polarized Politics: Why American Needs Social Conservatism|last=Bell|first=Jeffrey|publisher=Encounter Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=6–10|quote=|via=Proquest ebrary}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social conservatism]], while defined differently by many scholars, is often conflated with the [[Christian right]]. Many religious conservatives push for a focus on [[Judeo-Christian tradition]]s as a guiding force for the country on social issues, leading them to be considered social conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Citizen's Guide to American Ideology: Conservatism and Liberalism in Contemporary Politics|last=Marietta|first=Morgan|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|page=32|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social conservatism|Social conservatives]] are concerned with many [[social issue]]s such as abortion, sex education, the equal rights amendment, school prayer, same-sex marriage, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Confronting the New Conservatism: The Rise of the Right in America|last=Thompson|first=Michael|publisher=NYU Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=2–3|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They oppose many of the cultural changes brought on by the culture wars and the sexual revolution. Summarily, this branch of conservatism is concerned with [[morality|moral]] and social issues within the United States and uses tradition, strict morals, and religion as solutions for these problems.

=== Accommodationism ===
Social conservatives are [[accommodationists]] and hold that the Establishment Clause solely prevents the establishment of a [[state Church]], not public acknowledgements of God nor "developing policies that encourage general religious beliefs that do not favor a particular sect and are consistent with the secular government's goals."&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite book|title=Does God Make a Difference?|author=Warren A. Nord|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|quote=First Amendment Politics: At the risk of oversimplifying a very complicated situation, I suggest that conservative justices tend to favor a weak reading of both the Free Exercise and Establishment clause, while liberals tend to favor strong readings. That is, conservative justices have been less concerned about the dangers of establishment and less concerned to protect free exercise rights, particularly of religious minorities. Liberals, by contrast, have been opposed to any possibility of a religious establishment and they have been relatively more concerned to protect the free exercise rights of minorities.|accessdate=December 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Devigne"&gt;{{cite book|title=Recasting Conservatism: Oakeshott, Strauss, and the Response to Postmodernism|author=Robert Devigne|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|quote=Conservatives claim that liberals misinterpret the establishment and free exercise clauses of the First Amendment. They point to the opinion written for the Supreme Court by Hugo Black in ''Everson v. Board of Education'': "The 'establishment of religion' clause of the First Amendment means at least this: neither a state nor a Federal government can set up a church. Neither can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions or prefer one religion over another." The establishment clause, conservatives insist, precludes the national state from promoting any religious denomination but does not prohibit state governments and local communities from developing policies that encourage general religious beliefs that do not favor a particular sect and are consistent with the secular government's goals.|accessdate=December 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abortion ===
{{main|United States pro-life movement}}
Social conservatives are generally "anti-[[abortion]]" (opposed to abortion on moral grounds) rather than "[[pro-life]]" (belief in the dignity of all human life from conception to natural death). These beliefs are often based on the argument of "fetal personhood".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Abortion Debate|last=Farrell|first=Courtney|publisher=ABDO Publishing Company|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=6–7|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personhood arguments focus on giving a fetus the status of a person which then entitles them to the right to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seipel|first=Peter|year=2014|title=Is There Sufficient Common Ground to Resolve the Abortion Debate?|url=|journal=The Journal of Value Inquiry|volume=48|pages=517–31|via=SpringerLink|doi=10.1007/s10790-014-9436-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social conservatives often support the repeal of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''.

=== Same-sex marriage ===

Social conservatives are against the legalization of [[same-sex marriage]], supporting instead laws such as the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) which defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman. They oppose same-sex marriage over concerns on parenting, religious concerns, concerns of continued changes to the definition of marriage, and concerns about tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dombrink|first=John|year=2012|title=After the Culture War? Shifts and Continuities in American Conservatism|url=|journal=Canadian Review of American Studies|volume=42|pages=301–21|via=Project Muse|doi=10.1353/crv.2012.0018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservatives are often [[opposition to LGBT rights|opposed to LGBT rights]], and therefore are concerned with "normalizing" [[same-sex relationships]] through the institution of marriage. Some republicans support Same-Sex Marriage, Equal Rights, and non-discrimination laws, these republicans are known as the [[Log Cabin Republicans]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Sex Goes to School|last=Luker|first=Kristin|publisher=Norton|year=2006|isbn=|location=New York|pages=101, 112|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex education ===

Social conservatives concerned with the moral education and possibly age-inappropriate information children receive from sex education classes in public schools. They prefer [[abstinence-only sex education]], as opposed to [[comprehensive sex education]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This view stems from strong beliefs in parental authority and strict moral values.

== History ==
'''1960s'''

This time period saw a surge in grassroots conservative activism in response to the successes of liberal politics in changing American culture.  Democrats continued to put forward increasingly liberal policy ideas that ran counter to the beliefs of many conservative Americans, such as the [[New Deal]], which mobilized them to protect their interests. Conservatives supported radical conservative candidates such as Barry Goldwater in the 1964 Republican primary. A rise of the "Radical Right" with social conservatives who believed in a strict moral code and religious authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Suburban Warriors: The Origins of the New American Right|last=McGirr|first=Lisa|publisher=Princeton|year=2001|isbn=|location=Princeton, New Jersey|pages=|quote=150|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1970s'''

Historians have pointed to the 1970s as a turning point where "a vast shift toward social and political conservatism" really began. Meg Jacobs and Julian Zelizer argue that this period saw an increase an activism and concern with personal and social issues which lead to a growth of conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=Meg|last2=Zelizer|first2=Julian|year=2008|title=Swinging Too Far to the Left|url=|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|volume=43 |issue=4|pages=683–93|via=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple theories on the growth of conservatism in this period. Some of the possible reasons or combination of reasons for this phenomenon are the backlash from the Vietnam war, the expanded conversation on civil rights, the economic changes in the United States, and the overall changes in culture in this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rightward Bound: Making America Conservative in the 1970s|last=Schulman|first=Bruce|last2=Zelizer|first2=Julian|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=3|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars refer to social conservatism and renewed conservative grassroots activism as a reaction to the counterculture and cultural upheaval of the 1960s–1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robin|first=Corey|year=2010|title=Conservatism and counterrevolution|url=|journal=Raritan|volume=30 |issue=1|pages=1–17|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable event regarding social policy in the 1970s was the passage of Roe v. Wade in 1973 which recognized a legal right to Abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Di Mauro|first=Diane|last2=Joffe|first2=Carole|year=2007|title=The Religious Right and the Reshaping of Sexual Policy: An Examination of Reproductive Rights and Sexuality Education|url=|journal=Sexuality Research and Social Policy|volume=4 |issue=1|pages=67–92|via=ProQuest|doi=10.1525/srsp.2007.4.1.67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1980s'''

Ronald Reagan, a prominent and well-supported conservative republican, exemplifies the rise of conservatives in mainstream politics. Reagan appealed to conservatives who felt marginalized by the growing liberalization of American culture, calling on "[[Forgotten man|the forgotten man]]" or Moral majority.&lt;ref&gt;McGirr, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGirr, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; After the tumultuous period of political and cultural changes in the 1960s–70s, Reagan's moderate traditionalism appeared as a source of needed stability for many Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Politics and Society in Modern America: Morning in America: How Ronald Reagan Invented the 1980's|last=Troy|first=Gil|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1990s'''

Major conservative welfare reform took place in the 1990s. In 1996 the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act|Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act]] (PRWORA) was passed narrowing the benefits of welfare recipients and encouraging work. [[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families]] (TANF) also came into effect during this period, limiting the time benefits can be received.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weicher|first=John|year=2001|title=Reforming welfare: The next policy debates|url=|journal=Society|volume=38 |issue=2|pages=16–20|via=|doi=10.1007/s12115-001-1035-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2000s'''

Social conservatives again became powerful in American politics in 2001 with the election of socially conservative President George W. Bush. It has been argued that many of Bush's policy decisions were strongly influenced by his religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Bush Administration, Sex and the Moral Agenda|last=Ashbee|first=Edward|publisher=Manchester University Press, Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|page=2|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in office Bush would pass influential conservative social policies such as the Defense of Marriage Act and support an increase in funding of Abstinence-Only Education.&lt;ref&gt;Ashbee, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; While President Bush did not strongly promote pro-life policies, he supported the movement through an emphasis on parental rights and focus on strict regulation of taxpayer funding.&lt;ref&gt;Ashbee, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electoral politics ==
In American politics, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] is the largest political party with some socially conservative ideals incorporated into its platform. Social conservatives predominantly support the Republican Party, although there are also socially [[conservative Democrat]]s who break ranks with the party platform. Despite this, there have been instances where the Republican Party's nominee has been considered too socially progressive by social conservatives. This has led to the support of third party candidates from parties such as the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]], whose philosophies more closely parallel that of social conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/29/sarah-palin-republican-bi_n_337782.html/ |title=huffingtonpost news story on NY23 |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= October 29, 2009|accessdate=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While many social conservatives see third parties as a viable option in such a situation, some high-profile social conservatives see the excessive support of them as dangerous.  This fear arises from the possibility of [[vote splitting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drake |first=Bruce |url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/03/09/romney-to-tea-party-dont-split-conservative-vote/ |title=Romney tells Tea Party not to split vote |publisher=Politicsdaily.com |date= |accessdate=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social conservatives, like any other interest-group, usually must find a balance between pragmatic electability and ideological principles when supporting candidates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/02/14/politics/main3829928.shtml?source=RSSattr=HOME_3829928/ Third Party Alternative to McCain] (Although no third party siphoned any significant percentage from McCain, such voter sentiment truly existed during the campaign)&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentator Randall Hoven of ''The American Thinker'' has remarked, "Using the ''National Journal''s ratings of Senators in 2007, the correlation coefficient between "economic" scores and "social" scores is 90%. That means they almost always go together; financial conservatives are almost always social conservatives and ''vice versa''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanthinker.com/2008/11/a_libertarian_defense_of_socia.html |title=A Libertarian Defense of Social Conservatism |publisher=American Thinker |date= |accessdate=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American [[Tea Party movement]], despite being mostly made up of stringent social conservatives, is economically conservative but generally avoids social conservative issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0310/34291_Page2.html |title=Tea parties stir evangelicals' fears |author= Ben Smith |publisher=Politico.Com |date= |accessdate=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tea Party Patriots is officially neutral&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/us/politics/13tea.html | work=The New York Times | first=Kate | last=Zernike | title=Tea Party Avoids Divisive Social Issues | date=March 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; on social conservatism.

'''Socialist Sunday Schools''' ('''SSS''') were set up as an alternative to [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Sunday school|Sunday School]]s in the [[United Kingdom]]. They arose in response to a feeling as to the inadequacy of the orthodox Sunday Schools as a training ground for the children of [[socialism|socialists]] and of the need for some organised and systematic method of presenting the socialist point of view and of teaching the ideals and principles of socialism to the children, youths and maidens in the country.

In the United States of America a radical Sunday School movement linked to the German-American socialist movement emerged in New York and Chicago in the 1880s and again on a broader scale as part of the [[Modern School (United States)|Modern School Movement]] during the first decade of the 20th Century. An even larger network of American Socialist Sunday Schools, closely paralleling the British movement, was launched by members of the [[Socialist Party of America]] during the first two decades of the 20th Century.

==Socialist Sunday Schools in Great Britain==

===History===

The earliest use of [[secularism|secular]] Sunday Schools by the radical movement began in Great Britain in the early 1830s, when adherents of [[Robert Owen]] and [[Chartism]] opened Sunday training schools for their children.&lt;ref name=Docherty&gt;James C. Docherty, "Socialist Sunday Schools," in ''Historical Dictionary of Socialism.'' Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 1997; pg. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; These schools continued to operate until sometime in the decade of the 1850s, fizzling out with the decline of the early radical movement.&lt;ref name=Docherty /&gt;

For a generation, no such schools existed in Great Britain. Only in 1886 did Socialist Sunday Schools begin to reemerge in Great Britain.&lt;ref name=Docherty /&gt; The institution was popularized by [[Mary Gray (socialist)|Mary Gray]] in 1892, a member of the [[Social Democratic Federation]], who ran a soup kitchen for the children of the dock strike. Her aim, on realising they had little or no education, was to influence and educate them and make them aware of their socialist responsibilities and provide what was lacking in their day schools. She started the first Sunday with only one other besides her own two children but twenty years later there were approximately one hundred and twenty schools throughout the country, twenty of them being in London itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wcml.org.uk/culture/songs_sss.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050829200953/http://www.wcml.org.uk/culture/songs_sss.htm |archivedate=2005-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, another Socialist Sunday School was created by trade unionist Tom Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gcal.ac.uk/radicalglasgow/chapters/tom_anderson.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217194045/http://www.gcal.ac.uk/radicalglasgow/chapters/tom_anderson.html |archivedate=2004-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1912 there were over 200 Socialist Sunday Schools throughout Britain. In their early days they encountered opposition from local authorities and politicians, who argued that Socialist Sunday Schools were subverting the minds of young people with political and anti-religious doctrines and teachings.

A national movement, the National Council of British Socialist Sunday Schools Union, formed in 1909, however, traces its origin to a school opened in Glasgow by [[Caroline Martyn]] and Archie McArthur. It was established as a protest against, and an alternative to, the perceived middle-class bias and assumptions of the regular churches. Its aims were to help the schools in their teaching of Socialism. The schools were grouped in District Unions and for the first ten years were affiliated to the Council. However, in 1920 the constitution was amended to allow direct school affiliation which meant there was wide representation at the Annual Conference. The manual was prepared chiefly for the use of teachers. It contains specimen lessons and technique help to the teachers together with suggested reading for socialist education.

It was the leadership's view that public education should be secular and Socialist Sunday Schools were for purely educational bodies and therefore the hymns did not have theological tendencies or the Christian [[dogma]] which was preached in religious churches of the day. They worked in close harmony with the [[Labour Movement]] and were concerned with the spiritual and social objective of the human race with regard to daily life and conduct.

The Socialist Sunday Schools along with the [[Labour Church]] were impeded by a lack of their own premises and met objections to hiring of suitable halls to the extent that in 1907 [[London County Council]] evicted five branches out of hired school buildings. A massive demonstration in [[Trafalgar Square]] ensued addressed by Margaret McMillan who, with her sister, was a [[Christian socialist]] and campaigned for better education and health for poor children. A few years later the [[Springburn]] branch met for many years in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party's]] Unity Hall in Ayr Street for the same reason.

Later in 1926 Fulham Council refused permission on Sundays because it was of a 'non-theological' character. It was becoming apparent that the reason that the Socialist Sunday Schools were encountering so much opposition was because they were 'being seen as subversive and as poisoning the minds of the young people of the country with their political and anti-religious doctrines and teachings' and there were those who tried to discredit the Schools by accusations of [[blasphemy]] and revolutionary teachings.

[[Image:The Socialist Commandments.jpg|thumb|300px|The Socialist Ten Commandments|right]]

''The Young Socialist'' was a monthly [[magazine|periodical]] published by the National Council and was first issued in Glasgow in 1901 and in the September 1910 edition the editor wrote that the true socialist, whatever, if any, denomination he belonged to, wanted fellowship, a kingdom of love and happiness, not hell. The Socialist Sunday Schools were organised with this theory as a basis and although there was no formulated set of rules to be followed there were three main guidelines of ethics, morality, brotherly love and social obligation.

* That morality is the fulfillment of one's duty to one's neighbour.
* That the present social system is devoid of the elements of love or justice, since, as an organisation, it ignores the claims of the weak and distressed, and that is, therefore, immoral;
* That society can be reorganised on a basis of love and justice, and that it is every man's duty to use all available social forces in bringing about that reorganisation.'

There were also '[[ten commandments]]' to be followed which were printed in some of the editions of the hymn book.

# Love your schoolfellows, who will be your fellow workmen in life. 
# Love learning, which is the food of the mind; be as grateful to your teacher as to your parents.
# Make every day holy by good and useful deeds and kindly actions. 
# Honour good men, be courteous to all men, bow down to none. 
# Do not hate or speak evil of anyone. Do not be revengeful but stand up for your right and resist oppression. 
# Do not be cowardly. Be a friend to the weak and love justice. 
# Remember that all good things of the earth are produced by labour. Whoever enjoys them without working for them is stealing the bread of the workers. 
# Observe and think in order to discover the truth. Do not believe what is contrary to reason and never deceive yourself or others. 
# Do not think that he who loves his own country must hate and despise other nations, or wish for war, which is a remnant of barbarism. 
# Look forward to the day when all men and women will be free citizens of one fatherland and live together as brothers and sisters in peace and righteousness.

==Socialist Sunday Schools in the United States==

===Origins===

The earliest known Socialist Sunday Schools (SSS) in the United States of America was launched on March 1, 1880 in [[New York City]] by Branch 14 of the [[Socialist Labor Party of America]].&lt;ref name=Harzig93&gt;Christiane Harzig, "The Role of German Women in the German-American Working-Class Movement in Late Nineteenth-Century New York," Journal of American Ethnic History, vol. 8, no. 2 (Spring 1989), pg. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Some 30 students participated at the time of the school's launch, which was lauded in the daily ''[[New Yorker Volkszeitung]]'' as an institution of great benefit to the entire German working-class neighborhood located on Manhattan's East Side.&lt;ref name=Harzig93 /&gt; The female members of Branch 14 were instrumental in the financial support of the school, which over the next two years conducted a series of concerts, performances, and fundraising social events.&lt;ref name=Harzig93 /&gt;

Other early American Socialist Sunday Schools were launched in the city of [[Chicago]] during the last years of the 1880s.&lt;ref name=KT39&gt;Kenneth Teitelbaum, ''Schooling for "Good Rebels": Socialist Education for Children in the United States, 1900-1920.'' Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press, 1993; pg. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Four such schools were identified by police officials at the time and declared by the authorities to be of "Socialistic and [[Anarchism|Anarchistic]] origin."&lt;ref name=KT39 /&gt; Classes were conducted in German — the main language of the immigrant-dominated American socialist movement of the day&lt;ref&gt;About 80% of the members of the Socialist Labor Party of America during its initial 20 years were German-speakers. See: Christiane Harzig, "The Role of German Women in the German-American Working-Class Movement in Late Nineteenth-Century New York," pg. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; — and about 500 children are believed to have attended in all.&lt;ref name=KT39 /&gt;

With the memory of the [[Haymarket Affair]] still fresh, these Sunday Schools were characterized by police official [[Michael J. Schaack]] as "the most conspicuous feature of the propaganda of the [[International Workingmen's Association|Internationale]] in Chicago today" and condemned for their "sowing in the minds of innocent children the seeds of [[atheism]], discontent, and lawlessness."&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Schaack, ''Anarchy and Anarchists: A History of the Red Terror and the Social Revolution in America and Europe.'' Chicago: F.J. Schulte, 1889; pp. 668-674. Quoted in Teitelbaum, ''Schooling for "Good Rebels,"'' pg. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

One Chicago SSS, the North Side Sunday School, met each week for one hour of instruction by a member of the local [[Turners|Turn Verein]], during which the ills of the capitalist system and the proposed alternative of socialism were expounded.&lt;ref name=Northside&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2734903/socialist_sundayschool_picnic/ "Socialist Sunday-School Picnic: A School Where Contempt of the Present Social System is Taught,"] ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' vol. 48 (July 30, 1888), pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; An 1888 front page story in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' plaintively editorialized that under the slogan "no religion and no church" children were being subjected to "an inculcation of socialistic views at an age particularly impressionable."&lt;ref name=Northside /&gt; An annual summer picnic and outing was held by the school in conjunction with the Turn Verein, attended by several hundred children ranging in age from 3 to 16.&lt;ref name=Northside /&gt;

Socialist Sunday Schools also seem to have existed in a few other major metropolitan areas, including a SSS started in Philadelphia in the Fall of 1888, with 6 teachers and about 150 pupils present for the launch.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2734989/a_socialist_sunday_school_200_pupils/ "A Socialist Sunday School: Two Hundred Pupils Attend the First Session — What They Were Taught,"] ''Philadelphia Times,'' whole no. 4735 (Sept. 3, 1888), pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional Sunday Schools linked to the organized anarchist movement sprouted up in various American urban centers during the first decade of the 1900s, springing primarily from the so-called Modern School movement developed by the [[Catalan people|Catalan]] anarchist [[Francisco Ferrer]] in 1901.&lt;ref name=KT39 /&gt; The Modern Schools were intended to be both instruments for self-development and social change and taught the values of cooperation, sympathy for the downtrodden, collective solidarity, [[anti-militarism]], anti-capitalism, and opposition to the power of the centralized state.&lt;ref name=KT39 /&gt; About 22 such schools were established.&lt;ref name=KT39 /&gt; Although originally intended to be expanded and transformed into regular day schools, most of these radical "Modern Schools" proved to be short-lived.&lt;ref name=KT39 /&gt;

===Schools of the Socialist Party of America===
[[File:110800-Williamsbridge-SSS.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The Socialist Sunday School of [[Williamsbridge, Bronx|Williamsbridge, Bronx, New York]] was organized in 1911 by Italian immigrants to provide an alternative to the Sunday Schools of the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;"The Williamsbridge Socialist Sunday School of New York," ''The Young Socialists' Magazine,'' vol. 4, no. 7 (July 1911), pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The primary Socialist Sunday School movement in the United States was that connected with the country's largest socialist organization, the [[Socialist Party of America]] (SPA). Approximately 100 Socialist Sunday Schools (SSS) were established by the SPA during the first two decades of the 20th Century.&lt;ref name=KT37&gt;Teitelbaum, ''Schooling for "Good Rebels,"'' pg. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; These institutions were intended to supplement the general education obtained by working class children in the publicly owned school system of the country.&lt;ref name=KT37 /&gt; Socialist Sunday Schools of the SPA were organized in no fewer than 64 cities and towns spread across 20 states and the [[District of Columbia]].&lt;ref name=KT37 /&gt;

While schools associated with the Socialist Party were established in such Midwestern cities as Chicago and [[Omaha, Nebraska]], the center of greatest activity was New York City and the neighboring cities of Southern [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=Peterson24&gt;Patti McGill Peterson, ''The Young Socialist Movement in America from 1905 to 1940: A Study of the Young People's Socialist League.'' PhD dissertation. Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin, 1974; pg. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one scholar the impetus for these schools came from the [[Workmen's Circle]] (Arbeiter Ring), a Yiddish-language Socialist fraternal benefit society.&lt;ref name=Peterson24 /&gt; The publishers of the Socialist ''New Yorker Volkszeitung'' were quick to follow, launching a periodical to aid the effort in December 1908 called ''The Little Socialist Magazine for Boys and Girls.''&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, ''The Young Socialist Movement in America from 1905 to 1940,'' pg. 26. The name of the publication was changed to the less infantile ''Young Socialists' Magazine'' in June 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1911 some 14 Socialist Sunday Schools were in existence in the New York metropolitan area.&lt;ref name=Peterson24 /&gt;

The first Socialist Sunday School on the Pacific coast of the United States was established in [[Oakland, California]] early in 1906.&lt;ref name=Oakland&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2443702/socialists_sunday_school/ "Socialists' Sunday-School,"] ''San Francisco Call,'' vol. 99, no. 60 (Jan. 29, 1906), pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Coordinated by [[Socialist Party of California]] activist H.H. Lilienthal, more than 100 children were enrolled at the organization's January 28 launch, which was held at the headquarters facility of Local Oakland.&lt;ref name=Oakland /&gt;

While precise enrollment numbers are not available, one contemporary estimated in the spring of 1911 that some 2,000 children participated in English-language Socialist Sunday Schools, supplanted by others in schools for children who spoke German, [[Latvian language|Latvian]], Yiddish, and other languages of the immigrant community.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, ''The Young Socialist Movement in America from 1905 to 1940,'' pg. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the leaders of the Socialist Party's effort to develop Socialist Sunday Schools was [[Bertha Mailly]], for a time Secretary of the New York State Committee, who encouraged prospective SSS teachers to read [[John Dewey|John Dewey's]] ''School and Society'' to provide a conceptual basis for their work.&lt;ref name=KT38&gt;Teitelbaum, ''Schooling for "Good Rebels,"'' pg. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; During the second decade of the 20th Century the Socialist Party's "Young People's Department," headed by [[William F. Kruse|William Kruse]], published an organizing manual for party locals seeking to establish Socialist Sunday Schools, including an extensive proposed list of books for SSS libraries.&lt;ref name=KT38 /&gt;

The Socialist education movement in America was closely connected with certain of the [[foreign language federation]]s of the SPA, which taught children in their native tongue.&lt;ref name=KT42&gt;Teitelbaum, ''Schooling for "Good Rebels,"'' pg. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Known to have organized Socialist Sunday Schools during this period were the [[Finnish Socialist Federation]], the [[Ukrainian Socialist Federation]], the [[Hungarian Socialist Federation]], and the [[Lettish Socialist Federation]].&lt;ref name=KT42 /&gt;

In tandem with the Socialist Party of America's network of Sunday Schools there existed a system of radical Sunday Schools conducted by the [[Workmen's Circle]] ''(Arbeiter Ring),'' a predominantly [[Yiddish language]] socialist mutual benefit organization. Founded in 1892, the Workmen's Circle was reorganized in 1901 and had grown to a membership of 6,700 by 1905.&lt;ref name=KT43&gt;Teitelbaum, ''Schooling for "Good Rebels,"'' pg. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1924 the Workmen's Circle was considerably larger than the declining Socialist Party, counting a membership of 85,000 in nearly 700 branches spread across 38 states and Canada.&lt;ref name=KT43 /&gt;

The Workmen's Circle established an educational bureau of its own in 1908 and sponsored programs for both adults and children, including some specifically designated as "Socialist Sunday Schools."&lt;ref name=KT43 /&gt; Some of these Workmen's Circle schools eventually allied themselves with the closely related network of Socialist Party schools, while others retained an independent affiliation with the Jewish socialist organization which had pioneered them.&lt;ref name=KT43 /&gt;

===Publications===

The primary publication of the Socialist Party's youth movement was a monthly magazine called ''Young Socialist's Magazine,'' established in 1908.&lt;ref name=KT41&gt;Teitelbaum, ''Schooling for "Good Rebels,"'' pg. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it would be incorrect to say that the activities of the British Socialist Sunday Schools were the sole influence upon the American movement, British publications and experiences were closely followed by American SSS activists.&lt;ref name=KT41 /&gt; American SSS workers traveled to Britain to observe the activities of the thriving school movement there, and reported their findings upon their return.&lt;ref name=KT41 /&gt;

==Socialist Schools in other countries==

According to Kenneth Teitelbaum, a scholar of the Socialist youth education movement, Socialist schools for children also existed in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[Hungary]], [[Belgium]], and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=KT41 /&gt;

'''Sodium bisulfite''' (or '''sodium bisulphite''', '''sodium hydrogen sulfite''') is a [[chemical compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] NaHSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Sodium bisulfite is a [[food additive]] with [[E number]] E222. This salt of [[bisulfite]] can be prepared by bubbling [[sulfur dioxide]] in a solution of [[sodium carbonate]] in water. Sodium bisulfite in contact with chlorine bleach (aqueous solution of [[sodium hypochlorite]]) will generate heat and form [[sodium bisulfate]] and [[sodium chloride]].{{cn|reason=It Balances, but contradictory data from Google. Need cite and equation in article body to support|date=September 2017}}

==Synthesis==
Sodium bisulfite can be prepared by bubbling excess [[sulfur dioxide]] through a solution of suitable base, such as [[sodium hydroxide]] or [[sodium bicarbonate]].
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  NaOH  →  NaHSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → NaHSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

==Properties==
Sodium bisulfite is a weakly acidic species with a [[acid dissociation constant|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] of 6.97.  Its conjugate base is the [[sulfite]] ion, SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;:
:HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ↔ SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

The theoretical fully protonated species is [[sulfurous acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;); however this does not exist in solution and treatment of sodium bisulfite with acids will result in decomposition with telltale [[effervescence]] of [[sulfur dioxide]], e.g.,

: NaHSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + HCl → NaCl + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

==Reactions==
In [[organic chemistry]] sodium bisulfite has several applications. It forms a bisulfite [[adduct]] with [[aldehyde]] groups and with certain [[cyclic ketone]]s to give a [[sulfonic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | collvol = 7 | collvolpages = 381 | year = 1990 | title = 2-Methyl-2-(Trimethylsiloxy)pentan-3-one | author = Steven D. Young, Charles T. Buse, and Clayton H. Heathcock | prep = cv7p0381}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear|left}}
:[[Image:Bisulfitereaction.svg|Bisulfite reaction]]{{clear|left}}

This reaction is useful for purification procedures. Contaminated aldehydes in a solution precipitate as the bisulfite adduct which can be isolated by filtration. The reverse reaction takes place in presence of a base such as [[sodium bicarbonate]] or [[sodium hydroxide]] and the bisulfite is liberated as [[sulfur dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | collvol = 7 | collvolpages = 361 | year = 1990 | title = 2-Methyl-3-phenylpropanal | author = S. A. Buntin and [[Richard F. Heck]] | prep = cv7p0361}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear|left}}
:[[Image:Bisulfite adduct.svg|Bisulfite adduct]]{{clear|left}}

Examples of such procedures are described for [[benzaldehyde]],&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | title = α-(N,N-Dimethylamino)phenylacetonitrile | author = Harold M. Taylor and [[Charles R. Hauser]] | collvol = 5 | collvolpages = 437 | year = 1973 | prep = cv5p0437}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[2-Tetralone|2-tetralone]],&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | title = &amp;beta;-Tetralone | author = M. D. Soffer, M. P. Bellis, Hilda E. Gellerson, and Roberta A. Stewart | collvol = 4 | collvolpages = 903 | year = 1963 | prep = cv4p0903}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[citral]],&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | title = Pseudoionone | author = Alfred Russell and R. L. Kenyon | collvol = 3 | collvolpages = 747 | prep = cv3p0747 | year = 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ethyl ester of [[pyruvic acid]]&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | title = Ethyl Pyruvate | author = J. W. Cornforth | year = 1963 | collvol = 4 | collvolpages = 467 | prep = cv4p0467}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[glyoxal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = Anthony R. Ronzio and T. D. Waugh | title = Glyoxal Bisulfite | collvol = 3 | collvolpages = 438 | prep = cv3p0438 | year = 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ring-expansion reaction of [[cyclohexanone]] with [[diazald]], the bisulfite reaction is reported to be able to differentiate between the primary reaction product [[cycloheptanone]] and the main contaminant cyclooctanone.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | prep = cv4p0221 | title = Cycloheptanone | author = Hyp J. Dauben, Jr., Howard J. Ringold, Robert H. Wade, David L. Pearson, and Arthur G. Anderson, Jr. | collvol = 4 | collvolpages = 221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other main use of sodium bisulfite is as a mild [[reducing agent]] in [[organic synthesis]] in particular in purification procedures. It can efficiently remove traces or excess amounts of [[chlorine]], [[bromine]], [[iodine]], [[hypochlorite]] salts, [[osmium tetroxide|osmate]] esters, [[chromium trioxide]] and [[potassium permanganate]].

A third use of sodium bisulfite is as a decoloration agent in purification procedures because it can reduce strongly coloured oxidizing agents, conjugated alkenes and carbonyl compounds.

Sodium bisulfite is also the key ingredient in the [[Bucherer reaction]]. In this reaction an [[aromatic]] [[hydroxyl]] group is replaced by an aromatic [[amine]] group and vice versa because it is a [[reversible reaction]]. The first step in this reaction is an [[addition reaction]] of sodium bisulfite to an aromatic [[double bond]]. The [[Bucherer carbazole synthesis]] is a related [[organic reaction]] that uses sodium bisulfite as a reagent.

==Uses in food and FDA ban==

While the related compound, [[sodium metabisulfite]], is used in almost all commercial wines to prevent oxidation and preserve flavor, sodium bisulfite is sold by some home winemaking suppliers for the same purpose.&lt;ref name="The Many Uses"&gt;[http://www.eckraus.com/wine-making-sodium-bisulfite.html The Many Uses Of Sodium Bisulfite]&lt;/ref&gt; In fruit canning, sodium bisulfite is used to prevent browning (caused by oxidation) and to kill microbes.

In the case of wine making, sodium bisulfite releases sulfur dioxide gas when added to water or products containing water. The sulfur dioxide kills yeasts, fungi, and bacteria in the grape juice before fermentation. When the sulfur dioxide levels have subsided (about 24 hours), fresh yeast is added for fermentation.

It is later added to bottled wine to prevent the formation of vinegar if bacteria are present, and to protect the color, aroma and flavor of the wine from oxidation, which causes browning and other chemical changes. The sulfur dioxide quickly reacts with oxidation by-products and prevents them from causing further deterioration.

Sodium bisulfite is also added to leafy green vegetables in salad bars and elsewhere, to preserve apparent freshness, under names like LeafGreen. The concentration is sometimes high enough to cause allergic reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Albertson, Timothy Eugene |title=Bronchial Asthma: A Guide for Practical Understanding and Treatment (Current Clinical Practice) |publisher=Humana Press |location=Totowa, NJ |year=2006 |pages=260–266 |isbn=1-58829-872-8 |edition=fifth |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h5gDcj9V4BgC&amp;pg=PA260#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, 1986, sodium bisulfite was banned from use by the [[FDA]] on fresh fruits and vegetables in the United States following the deaths of 13 people and many illnesses, mainly among asthmatics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Molotsky | first = Irvin | title = U.S. ISSUES BAN ON SULFITES' USE IN CERTAIN FOODS |  publisher = The New York Times | date = July 9, 1986 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/09/us/us-issues-ban-on-sulfites-use-in-certain-foods.html | accessdate = 2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bisulfite DNA sequencing==
{{further|Bisulfite sequencing}}

[[Image:Bisulfite-reaction.png|thumb|right|300px|The chemical reaction that underlies the bisulfite-mediated conversion of cytosine to uracil.]]

Sodium bisulfite is used in the analysis of the [[methylation]] status of cytosines in [[DNA]].

In this technique, sodium bisulfite deaminates [[cytosine]] into [[uracil]], but does not affect [[5-methylcytosine]], a methylated form of cytosine with a methyl group attached to carbon 5.

When the bisulfite-treated DNA is amplified via [[polymerase chain reaction]], the uracil is amplified as thymine and the methylated cytosines are amplified as cytosine. [[DNA sequencing]] techniques are then used to read the sequence of the bisulfite-treated DNA. Those cytosines that are read as cytosines after sequencing represent methylated cytosines, while those that are read as thymines represent unmethylated cytosines in the genomic DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[PNAS]] | year = 1992 | volume = 89 | issue = 5 | pages = 1827–31 |author1=Frommer, M. |author2=McDonald, L.

== Industrial uses ==
[[File:Sodium bisulfite tank at Sunnyvale Water Pollution Control Plant.jpg|thumb|A tank containing 25% sodium bisulfite at a water treatment plant in Sunnyvale, California.]]
Sodium bisulfite is a common reducing agent in the chemical industry, as it readily reacts with dissolved oxygen:
:2 NaHSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 NaHSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
It is usually added to large piping systems to prevent oxidative corrosion. In biochemical engineering applications, it is helpful to maintain anaerobic conditions within a reactor.
Sodium bisulfite should not be confused with [[sodium bisulfate]] which is used as a [[pH]] lowering chemical for swimming pools.

In drinking water treatment, sodium bisulfite is often added after super chlorination, to reduce the residual chlorine before discharging to the service reservoir.

In wastewater treatment, sodium bisulfite is often added following disinfection with chlorine prior to discharging the effluent to the receiving water.  Residual chlorine can have a negative impact on aquatic life.

In steam boilers, sodium bisulfite has been a reliable oxygen scavenger in boiler feedwater for approximately 60 years. This compound is characterized as having fast reaction times, low use-cost, years of proven performance, availability. Sodium bisulfite when used in steam boilers has FDA and USDA approvals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wolfe |first=Thomas W. |url=http://www.awt.org/pub/0176A244-C39A-35F3-905B-C04745D2F847 |title=Operation of Deaerators to Increase Boiler System Reliability |work=The Analyst: Voice of the Water Treatment Industry |publisher=Association of Water Technologies |format=PDF |access-date=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''SuperPower 2''''' is a [[real-time strategy]] [[Wargame (video games)|wargame]] developed by [[Canada|Canadian]] based [[GolemLabs]] and published by [[DreamCatcher Interactive]] in 2004, following ''[[SuperPower]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.golemlabs.com/company/ |title=History |website=[[GolemLabs]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060808224530/http://www.golemlabs.com/company/ |archivedate=August 8, 2006 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released between October 11 and November 19, 2004 in North America and Europe, respectively.  On April 18, 2014, Nordic Games officially released ''SuperPower 2'' on the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] Store.

Players may join a game as any of the 193 nations recognized by the [[United Nations]] at the time of its development. All standard games start in the year 2001, with the player taking control of their nation. They then must work toward their predefined goals, such as achieving [[world peace]], balancing your nation's resources, or [[World domination|conquering the world]], or, if they did not set any predefined goals, they have the opportunity to work toward developing their nation's infrastructure, increasing their military strength through new unit designs and development, and encouraging the economic and cultural growth of their nation.

Any nation not controlled by a player is considered an [[Artificial intelligence in video games|AI]] nation. If there are predefined objectives, the player will attempt to reach this objective to win the game. The AI will have their own objectives, which they will try to reach as well. If and when the player and the AI have conflicting goals, it is up to the player, and occasionally the AI, to decide if diplomacy is the way to go, or if war is the answer to their problems.

Because ''SuperPower 2'' is a real-time game, there is no preset end date. This means that a single game can, in theory, run indefinitely.

''SuperPower 2'' was released in [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== Spheres ==

=== Political sphere ===
[[Image:SP2-Politics.png|thumb|left|Political Sphere]]

* Political sphere (menu structure)
** Constitutional
** Internal Laws
** Treaties
*** New Treaty
*** View Selected

Political sphere consists of all political activity, domestic and international, of the selected nation. This sphere allows players to see (and modify if own nation is selected) internal laws, government type, and diplomatic agreements.

=== Military sphere ===
[[Image:SP2-Military.png|thumb|left|Military Sphere]]

The Military sphere consists of all military and covert operations. This sphere allows players to buy, sell, build, train, deploy, disband a variety of military units. It also allows players to train intelligence cells and conduct [[Espionage|covert warfare]]. In addition, strategic warfare is controlled from this sphere.

==== Strategic warfare ====
Strategic warfare consists of [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|nuclear missiles]] being launched from land based locations, or from [[Submarine-launched ballistic missile|submarines]].  Nuclear warfare is devastating for both the attacker and the victim.  When a nuclear missile is launched and detonates in another nation, relations with nations around the world decline, depending on the importance of the nation attacked.  The attacker's nation also becomes less stable, increasing chances of a revolution.

[[Image:Russia Nuking US, Start of WWIII.PNG|thumb|left|The [[Russian Federation]] launching a nuclear strike against the [[United States]].]]

=== Economic sphere ===
The economic sphere consists of all financial activity. From this sphere player can view (and control if the selected nation is the same as the player's) income and expenses as well as trade and taxes. Players can set national interest rates, income tax levels, tariffs, and spending levels in this sphere.  Players can also [[Nationalization|nationalize]] or [[Privatization|privatize]] portions of their economy. This is also where the "[[Autarky]]" bug does most damage because in the game trade is almost always the most income generating source and when the bug sets in, this well of wealth inevitably dries up when no other nations buy your goods. However, playing country with high levels of raw resources like [[South Africa]] with precious metals, seems to not fall victim to the bug as quickly as countries relying on services and agriculture. Also, by invading nearby countries followed by annexation and high levels of taxes can also stave off autarky. At this point however, convincing the rest of the world not to invade is a bigger problem.

}}

Although slightly improved over the original ''SuperPower'', the sequel received "mixed" reviews according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=MC/&gt;

Many critics referred to the game as highly ambitious but critically flawed. One of the most positive reviews, from GameZone, said that "The number of options, the good graphics for the globe and almost limitless gameplay adds up a game that is worthy of United Nations attention."&lt;ref name=GameZone/&gt;

However, many high-profile gaming publications panned the game, with common criticisms including frequent crashes, a poorly designed user interface, features that were either not implemented or apparently ineffective, and frequent implausible, nonsensical, and unexplained events occurring during the game (such as [[Poland]] declaring war on [[Burkina Faso]] for unclear reasons). A reviewer for [[GameSpy]] described ''SuperPower 2'' as "a bunch of pointless [[Handwaving|hand-waving]] in a half-hearted attempt to pawn off a ponderous spreadsheet as a game", also stating that "...because the game is so devoid of personality, it's not even engaging as a way of experimenting with nightmare scenarios. There's nothing [[Contentment|satisfying]] about taking control of the U.S. and changing it to a military dictatorship without freedom of speech or women's suffrage, only to see your political standing inch to the right and maybe your approval rating dip for a while."&lt;ref name=GSpy/&gt; [[IGN]] was also critical of the game, giving it a score of 4.5 out of 10 and stating, among other things, that "The art of international war itself is conducted here according to principles that would make [[Sun Tzu]] burn [[The Art of War|his book]] and restart life as a [[Catering|caterer]]." The game also features plenty of mods to choose from which change and edit the game play to specific real time or fictional settings.&lt;ref name=IGN/&gt;

== Steam release ==
After nearly 10 years from the original release date, the game was released on the PC game distribution platform [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on April 18, 2014, after a successful Steam Greenlight campaign. The Steam version features updated code and patches for bugs that were long neglected in the older version. However, this version also came with its share of problems, such as fullscreen mode not being an option, and the updated code breaking user-made modifications from the older version. The former was fixed however. Steam achievements were also added, as well as a new authentication system and server browser, which replaced [[GameSpy]], its former server browser service that discontinued the game earlier in the year.

== GOG release ==
Remastered [[DRM-free]] version of the game was released on the PC game distribution platform [[GOG.com]] on August 13, 2015 with a 4 day -50% launch discount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gog.com/news/release_superpower_2|title=Release: SuperPower 2|website=[[GOG.com]]|date=August 13, 2015|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Game is sold with additional manual, design document, concept arts and team photographs. Much like Steam version it lacked full screen mode. Remastering included support for [[widescreen]] resolutions, new multiplayer matchmaking with modified multiplayer user interface, and an updated source code to offer support for modern [[operating system]]s. Initial reviews were mixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gog.com/game/superpower_2|title=SuperPower 2|website=GOG.com|date=August 14, 2015|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bugs ==
After playing for a long period (the exact amount varies from game to game), a [[software bug|bug]] called [[Autarky]] sets in. The Autarky bug will always happen if the game is going on for a long period. It makes it nearly impossible for a nation to trade because everyone has a surplus of many of the items they trade. This causes nations to begin to lose money, since they can no longer make money from trade. While in most cases the bug eventually occurs, the use of extensive measures within player controlled countries- such as explosive population growth manipulation, severe limiting of human development and minimal infrastructures and telecommunications development- can maintain a permanent, large, and increasing resource deficit, which results in permanent importing for the player country, and massive export growth for virtually all other countries. With extreme population manipulation through the building and canceling of large numbers of soldiers while paused, it is possible to sustain a pan-global computer nation export economy with one underdeveloped, vastly overpopulated nation.

There are several patches made by the modding community fixing bugs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="116452">{{Telangana movement}}
The '''Telangana movement''' refers to a movement for the creation of a new state, [[Telangana]], from the pre-existing state of [[Andhra Pradesh ]]  in  [[India]]. The new state corresponds to the [[Telugu language|Telugu]]-speaking portions of the erstwhile [[Hyderabad State|princely state of Hyderabad]]. After several years of protest and agitation, the central government, under the [[United Progressive Alliance]], decided to bifurcate the existing Andhra Pradesh state and on 7 February 2014, the Union Cabinet unilaterally cleared the bill for the creation of Telangana. Lasting for almost a decade, this has been one of the most longlasting movements in South India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cabinet-clears-telangana-bill/article5664852.ece|title=Cabinet clears Telangana Bill|author=B. Muralidhar Reddy, Vinay Kumar|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 February 2014, the [[Lok Sabha]] passed the bill with a [[voice vote]]. Subsequently, the bill was passed by Rajya Sabha two days later, on 20 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lok Sabha passes Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Bill|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/02/lok-sabha-passes-andhra-pradesh-reorganization-bill/|work=IANS|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per the bill, [[Hyderabad]] would be the capital of Telangana, while the city would also remain the capital of residual state of Andhra Pradesh for no more than ten years. On 2 June 2014, [[Telangana]] was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Telangana state to be formally carved out on June 2|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/03/telangana-state-to-be-formally-carved-out-on-june-2/|work=IANS|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of the Telangana movement}}
[[File:India Telangana locator map.svg|thumb|Map of India with the Telangana region highlighted in red]]

In December 1953, the [[States Reorganisation Commission]] was appointed to prepare for the creations of states on linguistic line. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/10/01/stories/2005100100040900.htm |title=SRC submits report |work=The Hindu |date= 1 October 2005|accessdate=9 October 2011 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission, due to public demand, recommended disintegration of Hyderabad State and to merge Marathi speaking region with [[Bombay state]] and Kannada speaking region with [[Mysore state]]. The [[s:India States Reorganisation Commission Report Telangana Andhra|States Reorganisation Commission]] (SRC) discussed pros and cons of the merger of Telugu speaking Telangana region of [[Hyderabad state]] with [[Andhra state]]. Paragraph 374 of the SRC report said "The creation of [[Vishalandhra Movement|Vishalandhra]] is an ideal to which numerous individuals and public bodies, both in Andhra and Telangana
, have been passionately attached over a long period of time, and unless there are strong reasons to the contrary, this sentiment is entitled to consideration". Discussing the case of Telangana, paragraph 378 of the SRC report said "One of the principal causes of opposition of Vishalandhra also seems to be the apprehension felt by the educationally backward people of Telangana that they may be swamped and exploited by the more advanced people of the coastal areas who were swamped by people of Tamilnadu already". In its final analysis SRC recommended against the immediate merger. In paragraph 386 it said "After taking all these factors into consideration we have come to the conclusions that it will be in the interests of Andhra as well as Telangana, if for the present, the Telangana area is to constitute into a separate State, which may be known as the Hyderabad State with provision for its unification with Andhra after the general elections likely to be held in or about 1961 if by a two thirds majority the legislature of the residuary Hyderabad State expresses itself in favor of such unification."

After going through the recommendations of the SRC, the then Home Minister [[Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant]] decided to merge Andhra state and Telangana to form Andhra Pradesh state on 1 November 1956 after providing safeguards to Telangana in the form of [[Gentlemen's agreement of Andhra Pradesh (1956)|Gentleman's agreement]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Telangana was the largest of the three regions of Andhra Pradesh state, covering 41.47% of its total area. It is inhabited by 40.54% of the state's population. The following is the breakup of Andhra Pradesh's revenue by region:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=andhrajyothy.com Team – editor@andhrajyothy.com |url=http://www.andhrajyothy.com/editshow.asp?qry=/2008/feb/12edit3 |title=Andhra Jyothy Telugu News Paper Online edition published from Andhra Pradesh, India |publisher=Andhrajyothy.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: The income generated by the capital city of the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh is a complex issue with income being generated from all regions. This has caused a lot of confusion in region-wise income distribution. Also, after the bifurcation, companies will pay their portion of taxes to Telangana or present day Andhra Pradesh depending on where they operate. Before the bifurcation, many companies were paid taxes to capital city Hyderabad for their operations in Seemandhra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Revenues from Hyderabad: Fact and fiction|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/andhra_pradesh/Revenues-from-Hyderabad-Fact-and-fiction/2013/08/28/article1755635.ece|publisher=New Indian Express|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AP bifurcation: Truth about Hyderabad|url=http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/2014-01-16/AP-bifurcation-Truth-about-Hyderabad-82361|accessdate=21 June 2014|publisher=The Hans India|date=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of a separate Telangana state cite perceived injustices in the distribution of water, budget allocations, and jobs. Within the state of Andhra Pradesh, 68.5% of the [[Drainage basin|catchment area]] of the [[Krishna River]] and 69% of the catchment area of the [[Godavari River]] are in the plateau region of Telangana and flowing through the other parts of the state into bay of Bengal. Telangana and non-coastal parts of [[Karnataka]] and [[Maharashtra]] states form [[Deccan Plateau]]. Telangana supporters state that 74.25% of irrigation water through the canal system under major irrigation projects goes to the Coastal Andhra region, while Telangana gets 18.20%.

The share of education funding for Telangana ranges from 9.86% in government-aided primary schools to 37.85% in government degree colleges. The above numbers include the expenditure in Hyderabad. Budget allocations to Telangana are generally less than 1/3 of the total Andhra Pradesh budget. There are allegations that in most years, funds allocated to Telangana were never spent. Since 1956, Andhra Pradesh government established 11 new medical colleges in the state. 8 were in Seemandhra and only 3 were in Telangana. Telangana was not compensated for lost opportunities because of inward migration of lot of students into Hyderabad from Seemandhra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Colleges Teaching MBBS|url=http://www.mciindia.org/InformationDesk/ForStudents/ListofCollegesTeachingMBBS.aspx|publisher=Medical Council of India|accessdate=20 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607111811/http://www.mciindia.org/InformationDesk/ForStudents/ListofCollegesTeachingMBBS.aspx|archivedate=7 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of a separate Telangana state feel that the [[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1956|agreements]], [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=P9oYG7HA76QC&amp;dat=19690412&amp;printsec=frontpage plans], and [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=P9oYG7HA76QC&amp;dat=19551126&amp;printsec=frontpage assurances] from the legislature and Lok Sabha over the last fifty years have not been honoured, and as a consequence Telangana has remained neglected, exploited, and backward.

== Early incidents (1969 to 1985) ==
{{Main|Pre-2004 Telangana protests}}

1969 to 1973:
This period was marked by two political kranthi namely 'Jai Telangana' and 'Jai Andhra' movements. Social tensions arose due to influx of people from the Coastal Andhra region. Protests started with the hunger strike of a student from Khammam district for the implementation of safe-guards promised during the creation of Andhra Pradesh. The movement slowly manifested into a demand for a separate Telangana.

Some students protested for "implementation of the safe guards from Andhra Pradesh" while some protested for a "Separate Telangana". The local newspaper ''Indian Express'' reported that the latter group were dominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=P9oYG7HA76QC&amp;dat=19690116&amp;printsec=frontpage |title=College students in Telangana agitation (Indian Express 16 January 1969; page 8-bottom) |publisher=Google |date=16 January 1969 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 19 January 1969 edition of ''The Indian Express'', the agitation turned violent when a crowd attempted to set fire to a sub-inspector's residence. 17 were injured in police firing. Discussions about the promised safe-guards were held. The Telangana Regional Committee was, however, not fully convinced of the outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=P9oYG7HA76QC&amp;dat=19690125&amp;printsec=frontpage|title=The Indian Express – Google News Archive Search|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agitation was met by a counter agitation by the Andhra students accusing the transfer Andhra employees as a discrimination between one region and the other. The transfers were eventually challenged in the high-court.

The army had to be called in. After several days of talks with leaders of both regions, on 12 April 1969, Prime minister put forth, an eight-point plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=P9oYG7HA76QC&amp;dat=19690412&amp;printsec=frontpage kranthi will be the best fighter in the future |title=Eight point plan for Telangana (IE 12 April) |publisher=Google |date=12 April 1969 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telangana leaders rejected the plan and protests continued under the leadership of newly formed political party [[Telangana Praja Samithi]] in 1969 asking for the formation of Telangana. Under the Mulki rules in force at the time, anyone who had lived in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] for 12 years was considered a local, and was thus eligible for certain government posts.

Telangana Praja Samithi was formed under the leadership of Pratap Kishore with the intention of leading the movement. The party however, split in November 1969 with the exit of dissident Congress leaders.

1971: In the May 1971 parliamentary elections, Telangana Praja Samithi won 10 out the 14 Parliament seats in Telangana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/StatisticalReports/LS_1971/Vol_I_LS71.pdf |title=TitlePage-VolII LS99.PDF |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/StatisticalReports/LS_1971/Vol_II_LS71.pdf |title=TitlePage-VolII LS99.PDF |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these electoral successes, some of the new party leaders gave up their agitation in September 1971 after realising that the Prime Minister was not inclined to towards a separate state of Telangana, and rejoined the safer political haven of the Congress ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+in0075) |title=India |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Political Crisis in 1969 and 1972"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ap.gov.in/political-crisis-in-1969-and-1972/ | title=Political Crisis in 1969 and 1972 | publisher=Government of Andhra Pradesh | accessdate=August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Minister Brahmananda Reddy resigns to make room for a Telangana Chief Minister. On 30-September-1971, P.V.Narasimha Rao – who would later become the Prime Minister of India – was appointed the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. "The Telangana Praja Samiti was dissolved and its members rejoined the Congress."&lt;ref name="Political Crisis in 1969 and 1972" /&gt;

1972: When the Supreme Court upheld the Mulki rules the [[Jai Andhra movement]], with the aim of re-forming a separate state of Andhra, was started in [[Coastal Andhra]] and [[Rayalaseema|Rayalseema]] regions. The movement lasted for 110 days. The Supreme Court upheld the implementation of Mulki rules. The people from the Andhra region viewed the Mulki rules as "treating them like aliens in their own land".

1973: a political settlement was reached with the Government of India with a Six-Point Formula. It was agreed upon by the leaders of the two regions to prevent any recurrence of such agitations in the future. To avoid legal problems, constitution was amended (32nd amendment) to give the legal sanctity to the Six-point formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/todays-paper/article1071468.ece |title=Nineteenth Century politics over Telangana |publisher=The Hindu Business Line |date=12 December 2009 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, when Telangana employees complained about the violations to six point formula, government enacted government order 610 (GO 610) to correct the violations in recruitment. As Telangana people complained about the non-implementation of GO 610, in 2001, the government formed the Girglani commission to look into violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2003-07-14/hyderabad/27208960_1_repatriation-telangana-non-gazetted-officers-recruitment-process |title=GO 610 will benefit 60,000 in Telangana |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |accessdate=13 January 2012 |date=14 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1997 to 2010 ==

In 1997, the state unit of the BJP passed a resolution seeking a separate Telangana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/01/24/stories/2010012455140100.htm |title=Front Page : Sushma pitches for Telangana |work=The Hindu |date=24 January 2010 |accessdate=14 September 2010 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Congress party MLAs from the Telangana region who supported a separate Telangana state formed the Telangana Congress Legislators Forum and submitted momorandum to their president Sonia Gandhi requesting to support the Telangana state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/2000/08/12/stories/0412201q.htm |title= Sonia urged to back demand for separate Telangana |publisher= [[The Hindu]] |date= 12 August 2000 |accessdate=16 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new party called [[Telangana Rashtra Samithi]] (TRS), led by [[Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao]] (KCR), was formed in April 2001 with the single-point agenda of creating a separate Telangana state with Hyderabad as its capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ia.rediff.com/news/2001/may/17ap1.htm |title= Massive rally demands Telangana state |last= Amin Jafri |first= Syed |date= 17 May 2001 |accessdate=16 February 2008 |publisher= rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the Congress Working Committee sent a resolution to the NDA government for constituting a second SRC to look into the Telangana state demand. This was rejected by then union home minister L.K. Advani citing that smaller states were neither viable nor conducive to the integrity of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/aug/23trs2.htm|title=Congress stand clear on Telangana issue: Andhra CM|work=rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2002, Advani wrote a letter to MP A. Narendra rejecting a proposal to create Telangana state explaining that "regional disparities in economic development could be tackled through planning and efficient use of available resources". He said that the NDA government, therefore, does "not propose creation of a separate state of Telangana"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1111020/jsp/nation/story_14646312.jsp |title=Advani amnesia and prod on Telangana |work=The Telegraph |location=Kolkota, India |date=20 October 2011 |accessdate=13 January 2012 |first=G.S. |last=Radhakrishna}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2012, Advani said that if their then partner [[Telugu Desam Party|TDP]] cooperated during NDA tenure, a separate state of Telangana could have been created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Telangana would have been reality had TDP cooperated: LK Advani|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_telangana-would-have-been-reality-had-tdp-cooperated-lk-advani_1758120|publisher=DNA|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed by the President of the TDP, [[Chandrababu Naidu]], on 1 September 2013 in a public meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NDA could not divide Andhra due to my opposition: N Chandrababu Naidu|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/NDA-could-not-divide-Andhra-due-to-my-opposition-N-Chandrababu-Naidu/articleshow/22215531.cms|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|2004–10 Telangana protests}}

In the run-up to the 2004 Assembly and Parliament elections, then Union Home Minister [[L. K. Advani]] ruled out inclusion of Telangana in the NDA agenda and said "Unless there is consensus among all political parties in the state and unless that consensus is reflected in a resolution of the state Assembly, we don’t propose to include it in the NDA agenda"&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/mar182004/n13.asp BJP against Telangana state: Advani – Deccan Herald]&lt;/ref&gt;

For these elections, the Congress party and the TRS forged an electoral alliance in the Telangana region to consider the demand of separate Telangana State.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/03/05/stories/2004030505830600.htm |title= Controversy over SRC blows over |publisher= The Hindu |accessdate=2008-02-16 |work= Andhra Pradesh |date= 2004-03-05 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress came to power in the state and formed a coalition government at the centre; TRS joined the coalition after the [[common minimum programme|common minimum program]] of the coalition government included that the demand for separate Telangana state will be considered after due consultations and consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aicc.org.in/common-minimum-programme.php |title= Common Minimum Programme of the Congress led United Progressive Alliance |publisher= Indian National Congress |accessdate=2008-02-16 |date=May 2004 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071212084846/http://www.aicc.org.in/common-minimum-programme.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009 the state government declared that it had no objection, in principle, to the formation of separate Telangana and that the time had come to move forward decisively on this issue. To resolve related issues, the government constituted a joint house committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/02/13/stories/2009021350230100.htm |title=Telangana: YSR moots joint panel |work=The Hindu |location=India |date=13 February 2009 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lead-up to the 2009 General Elections in India, all the major parties in Andhra Pradesh supported the formation of Telangana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/04/07/stories/2009040756451200.htm |title=Why it is Telangana that holds the key? |work=The Hindu |location=India |date=7 April 2009 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 elections TRS managed to win only 10 assembly seats out of the 45 it contested and only 2 MP seats. Some media analysts thought Telangana sentiment faded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/fast-forward/552833/0 |title=Fast forward |work=The Indian Express |location=India |date=11 December 2009 |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within few months of getting re-elected as popular CM, [[Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy]] (YSR) died in a helicopter crash in September 2009. This resulted in a leadership crisis within the Congress party and also created a political vacuum in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/people/who-is-kcr-116785|title=Who is KCR?|work=NDTV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, TRS president [[K.

=== Announcement of bifurcation and subsequent rollback ===

On 9 December 2009, Union Minister of Home Affairs [[P. Chidambaram]] announced that the Indian government would start the process of forming a separate Telangana state, pending the introduction and passage of a separation resolution in the Andhra Pradesh assembly. This resulted in protests across both Andhra and [[Rayalseema]]. Students, workers, lawyers and various organisations in the regions launched the [[Samaikyandhra Movement]] demanding that the state be kept united.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/12/19/stories/2009121952620300.htm |title=Samaikhya Andhra stir continues |publisher=The Hindu |date=2009-12-19 |accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; MLAs from these regions also submitted their resignations in protest seeking a reversal of the home minister's statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/hyderabad/aicc-report-says-ysr-did-not-favour-t-state-277 |title= AICC report says YSR did not favour T state |work=Deccan Chronicle |location=India |accessdate=20 December 2010 |date= 20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Srikrishna Committee headed by former Chief Justice B. N. Srikrishna toured all the regions of state extensively and invited people from all sections of the society to give their opinion on the statehood. It received over one lakh petitions and representations from political parties, organisations, NGOs and individuals. It also held consultations with political parties and general public while also factoring in the impact of recent developments on different sections of people such as women, children, students, minorities, Other Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/article948053.ece |title=Justice Srikrishna panel to visit Hyderabad to meet leaders |publisher=The Hindu |date=2010-12-12 |accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 December 2010, two weeks before the deadline for the submission of the Srikrishna report, TRS organised a public meeting in [[Warangal]]. It was estimated that over 2.6 million people attended this meeting. It was reported that even more would have attended, but were stranded due to traffic jams along roads leading to the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epaper.andhrajyothy.com/AJ/AJYOTHI/2010/12/17/ArticleHtmls/17_12_2010_011_026.shtml?Mode=1 Traffic blocked for over 20&amp;nbsp;km.

=== Release of the report and summary of findings ===
The Indian Home Ministry released the 505 page [[Srikrishna committee on Telangana|Srikrishna committee]] on 6 January 2011. The committee opined that most regions of Telangana (excluding Hyderabad) were either "on par or a shade lower" than Coastal Andhra. When Hyderabad is included, Telangana fared better. The most backward of all regions was in fact Rayalaseema. The committee, however, agreed with the violations of GO 610. Most violations, however, have been in the education and health sectors due to dearth of qualified locals. It also noted that the funds released for educational institutions in Telangana were lower than in the other two regions of the state. The committee did not see the Telangana movement as a threat to national integrity. Noting the emotions in the general public about the issue, a perceived neglect in implementation of assurances given to the region,it also said that "The continuing demand, therefore, for a separate Telangana, the Committee felt, has some merit and is not entirely unjustified". The conclusion of the report included the following statements "Therefore, after taking into account all the pros and cons, the Committee did not think it to be the most preferred, but the second best, option. Separation is recommended only in case it is unavoidable and if this decision can be reached amicably amongst all the three regions"

=== Solutions proposed ===
The report discusses six solutions to the problem, the preferred option being keeping the State united by simultaneously providing certain definite constitutional and statutory measures for socio-economic development and political empowerment of Telangana region through the creation of a statutorily empowered Telangana Regional Council. The second best option is bifurcation of the State into Telangana and Seemandhra as per existing boundaries, with Hyderabad as the capital of Telangana and Seemandhra to have a new capital.&lt;ref name="Srikrishna Committee Report – Vol I"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/archieve/others/2011/jan/d2011010502.pdf |title=Srikrishna Committee Report – Vol I (Main Report) |format=PDF |accessdate=13 January 2012|pages=407, 450}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pib.nic.in/archieve/others/2011/jan/d2011010503.pdf Srikrishna Committee Report – Vol II (Appendix to the report)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reactions to the report ===
The eighth chapter of the report was not made public for undisclosed reasons. After a judgement delivered by Justice L Narasimha Reddy of Andhra Pradesh High Court, the contents of the "secret" chapter were submitted to the High Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/telangana-hc-verdict-brings-out-secret-portion-of-srikrishna-report/766634/ |title=Telangana: HC verdict brings out 'secret' portion of Srikrishna report |publisher=Indian Express |date=24 March 2011 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chief Justice, in his  60 page judgement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hc.ap.nic.in/orders/wp_1569_2011.html 60 page judgement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929171622/http://hc.ap.nic.in/orders/wp_1569_2011.html |date=29 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; said "The Committee travelled beyond the terms of reference in its endeavour to persuade the Union of India not to accede to the demand for Telangana". The judgement also quoted the SKC report's 8th chapter and said "The manoeuvre suggested by the Committee in its secret supplementary note poses an open challenge, if not threat, to the very system of democracy." The eighth chapter was not make public after division bench comprising the Chief Justice of the AP high court has stayed the order of Justice L Narasimha Reddy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=26 April 2011 DC Correspondent Hyderabad |url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/cities/hyderabad/secret-t-report-sealed-cover-157 |title=Secret T-report in sealed cover |work=Deccan Chronicle |location=India |date=26 April 2011 |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=26 April 2011 DC Correspondent Hyderabad |url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/cities/hyderabad/hc-bench-keeps-t-report-secret-164 |title=HC bench keeps T-report secret |work=Deccan Chronicle |location=India |date=26 April 2011 |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the facts of the comments of the judge on the eighth chapter remain unverified.

In January, BJP led by State party president Kishan Reddy started the 22-day Telangana 'Poru Yatra', across 88 assembly constituencies stressing the need for Telangana state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gadkari flags off BJP’s Telangana Yatra|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/220508/gadkari-flags-off-bjps-telangana.html|publisher=Deccan Helard, 19 Jan 2012|accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the tour was successful in reiterating the party's pro-Telangana stance, it could not garner as much support as hoped because of the indifferent attitude of the TRS and TJAC. In fact the failure of the TRS in declaring its support to Kishan Reddy’s yatra has resulted in growing differences between the two parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailypioneer.com/nation/42239-only-bjp-can-fulfill-the-dream-of-telangana.html ‘Only BJP can fulfill the dream of Telangana’]&lt;/ref&gt;

By-elections took place on 18 March in 6 Telangana assembly seats. TRS won four out of five seats it contested with huge majorities ranging from 15,024 to 44,465. In two out of the four seats won by TRS (Kamareddy and Adilabad), the TRS candidates polled less number of votes compared to 2009 assembly elections when they contested as candidates from TDP which was in alliance with TRS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblyelections.com/north-telangana-assembly-elections/nizamabad-district/kamareddy-assembly/ Kamareddy Assembly | Assembly Elections]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblyelections.com/north-telangana-assembly-elections/adilabad-district/adilabad-assembly/ Adilabad Assembly | Assembly Elections]&lt;/ref&gt; Ex-TDP MLA Nagam Janardhan Reddy won from Nagarkurnool seat as an independent with TJAC support.

After setting 30 September as the deadline for the Centre to announce the formation of Telangana, the TJAC threatened to organise a 'Telangana March' in Hyderabad on the lines of the '[[Dandi March]]' .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Telangana Political Joint Action Committee plans 'Dandi March' like agitation for Telangana|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-09-13/hyderabad/33815944_1_chalo-hyderabad-m-kodandaram-political-joint-action-committee|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atimes.com"&gt;Francesco Brunello Zanitti {{cite web|title=Telangana issue sparks more turmoil|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/NJ19Df02.html|publisher=Asia Times Online|date= 19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September, after long discussions between JAC leaders and ministers from Telangana region, the state government ignoring warnings about the possible breakdown of law and order, gave permission for the march. The JAC leaders gave written assurance to the government that the agitation programme would be conducted in a peaceful and "gandhian" manner from 15:00 to 19:00 on 30 September on the Necklace Road on the edge of Hussain Sager lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Government blinks, allows Telangana march|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-09-29/hyderabad/34163281_1_telangana-march-telangana-ministers-chalo-hyderabad-march|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/cities/andhra-pradesh-government-gives-permission-for-telangana-million-march-273491 |title=Andhra Pradesh government gives permission for Telangana Million March |publisher=NDTV.com |date=2012-09-29 |accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indian Railways]] cancelled several express and passenger trains and all local and sub-urban train services in Hyderabad reportedly on the advice of police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Telangana march: Over 40 trains to Hyderabad cancelle|url=http://www.firstpost.com/politics/telangana-march-over-40-trains-to-hyderabad-cancelled-473723.html|publisher=First post|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 September, the day of the march, Police closed the gates and blocked students at the [[Osmania University]] gate and other protestors at several places in the city when they were proceeding in rallies towards the March venue. Congress MPs from Telangana were arrested in front of Chief minister's office when they staged a dharna as they were not allowed to meet him over the detention of their party supporters who were stopped from reaching the venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Violence mars 'Telangana March' in Hyderabad|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/violence-mars-telangana-march-in-hyderabad/1009994/0|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though police sealed all the entry points to the Necklace Road and opened only the Buddha Bhavan route, by 4pm around 2 lakh protestors including various party leaders and their supporters reached the venue from all routes.

=== Chalo Assembly ===
In May 2013, the TJAC gave a call to lay siege to the state legislative Assembly in Hyderabad on 14 June 2013 to demand the formation of Telangana. Government refused permission to the march as they had information that anti-social elements might participate in the event and cause violence like in previous events of [[2012 Telangana protests#Telangana March|''Sagara Haram'']] and [[Early 2011 Telangana protests#Million March 2011|''Million March'']] where violence erupted despite promises made by the TJAC.

{{See also|Samaikyandhra_Movement#Public_Protests_Aftermath|label 1=Samaikyandhra Protests due to the decision}}
The Congress Working Committee (CWC) unanimously passed a resolution On 30 July to create the State of Telangana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/congress-gives-nod-telangana-set-to-be-a-separate-state_865388.html|title=Congress gives nod to Telangana; Hyderabad to be joint capital|work=Zee News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee also assured that the concerns of people from the remaining regions regarding sharing of water and power resources will be addressed. The bifurcation decision sparked off fresh [[Samaikyandhra Movement#Public Protests Aftermath|protests]] as part of the [[Samaikyandhra Movement]].

==== Reactions ====

TRS welcomed the decision and its chief K. Chadrashekhar Rao said that his party is fine with Hyderabad being the joint capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/hyderabad-joint-capital-as-ap-to-be-split-into-telangana-seemandhra/410704-62-127.html|title=Hyderabad joint capital as AP to be split into Telangana, Seemandhra|work=IBNLive}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was seen as an attempt by the INC to merge TRS into itself for the general and provincial election after being marginalised in the Rayalseema and coastal regions by the [[YSR Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/slide-show/slide-show-1-telangana-demand-met-congress-eyes-merger-with-trs/20130731.htm|title=Telangana demand met, Congress eyes merger with TRS|date=31 July 2013|work=Rediff}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://news.in.msn.com/national/bjp-to-monitor-carefully-upa%e2%80%99s-intention-on-telangana|title=News|work=msn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that their party supports the creation of Telangana and Vidarbha. They demanded that other requests for the creation of new states such as those of Gorkhaland and [[Bodoland]] need to be done by appointing a Second States Reorganisation Commission earlier too. We now demand that the government should set it up and seek a report within a specific timeframe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/telangana-now-set-up-commission-for-other-states-says-bjp/1148814|title=Telangana: Now set up commission for other states, says BJP|author=Express news service|work=The Financial Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many parties and politicians including the Chief Minister-who hails from Rayalaseema- protested the bill. Some even termed it as "undemocratic". The congress and YSRCP were wiped out in the following elections, however in all three regions of the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh. [[Indian general election, 2014]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/cheat-sheet/telangana-announcement-andhra-pradesh-chief-minister-kiran-kumar-reddy-leaves-for-delhi-398746 |title=Telangana announcement: Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Kiran Kumar Reddy leaves for Delhi |publisher=NDTV.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/ysr-congress-terms-telangana-decision-undemocratic-threatens-protest/1/297161.html |title=YSR Congress terms Telangana decision undemocratic, threatens protest |publisher=Indiatoday.intoday.in |date= |accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision sparked protests by the [[Gorkha Janmukti Morcha]] (GJM) in the form of an indefinite strike for [[Gorkhaland]]. GJM President [[Bimal Gurung]] also resigned from the [[Gorkhaland Territorial Administration]] in demand for Gorkhaland, citing West Bengal government's interference with its autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/telangana-gjm-ratchets-gorkhaland-demand-174805877.html?.tsrc=inucbr |title=After Telangana, GJM ratchets up Gorkhaland demand |publisher=In.news.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was even speculated by the media that more such moves could gain steam, such as that by the [[Bundelkhand Mukti Morcha]] for [[Bundelkhand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-07-13/india/40553694_1_statehood-demand-gorkha-territorial-administration-separate-state |title=Telangana could spur more statehood demands |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2013-07-13 |accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the national Home Ministry opined that the lack of development in the proposed areas and the proximity to other hotbeds in Chattishgarh's Bastar and Maharashtra's Gadhidoli regions might cause an increase in Naxalism in Telangana [[Communist Party of India (Maoist)]] if the administration is not quickly consolidated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/telangana-may-witness-spurt-in-naxalism-home-ministry/410696-62-127.html |title=Telangana may witness spurt in Naxalism: Home Ministry |publisher=Ibnlive.in.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next steps towards the re-formation of Telangana, expected by early 2014, are: The national cabinet sharing its plans with the President of India and the Andhra Pradesh legislature. The Prime Minister would then organise a committee to negotiate a consensus between the leaders from the three regions for issues such as sharing revenue and water. Both national houses of parliament would then have to pass a resolution to create Telangana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/cheat-sheet/telangana-announcement-andhra-pradesh-chief-minister-kiran-kumar-reddy-leaves-for-delhi-398746|title=Telangana announcement: Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Kiran Kumar Reddy leaves for Delhi|work=NDTV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 October, recently retired director general of police Dinesh Reddy said the Chief minister, Kiran Kumar Reddy pressured him to issue a public statement that the creation of Telangana would lead to intensification of Maoist activities. He also charged that the CM had reprimanded him for seeking additional central forces for containing expected trouble in Seemandhra in the run up to the Congress Working Committee's Telangana resolution at the end of July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kiran Kumar Reddy wanted to use me to stall Telangana plan: Former Andhra Pradesh DGP V Dinesh Reddy|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Kiran-Kumar-Reddy-wanted-to-use-me-to-stall-Telangana-plan-Former-Andhra-Pradesh-DGP-V-Dinesh-Reddy/articleshow/23749838.cms|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

9 January: The debate continues only after YSRCP MLAs were suspended. While there was polarisation on regional lines, debate more or less turned into a blame game over the state bifurcation issue as every party indulged in a game of political one-upmanship.

The move was criticised by Telangana MLAs including the ministers and deputy chief minister saying that cabinet was not consulted on the subject. They said this "''amounts to defying the Union Cabinet, Constitution and President''". After this, no debate was possible in the assembly as Telangana members insisted that speaker reject the Chief minister's notice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stalemate continues over Telangana bill in Andhra legislature|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-stalemate-continues-over-telangana-bill-in-andhra-legislature-1957953|publisher=DNA India|accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 January 2014, Andhra Pradesh assembly speaker declared that assembly completed the debate and all the members gave their views. He said, he would send to the President of India a compilation of 9,072 suggestions and amendments he received in writing from members, including 87 members who had spoken on the Bill in the house. Further he accepted the Chief minister's notice of resolution to reject the AP Reorganisation Bill and declared that resolution passed by voice vote without even waiting for the MLAs in the house to say ‘aye’, admist pandemonium and protests from Telangana MLAs. Earlier in the day Seemandhra members rushed to the well of the House demanding that the resolution moved by the CM, without cabinet approval, be put to vote, those from the Telangana region, including the ministers and deputy chief minister, did the same with the demand that there should be no voting. At 11.30 pm, in what appears to be a coordinated strategy between the speaker, the chief minister and the Seemandhra legislators, all the members from that region converged at the well of the House and formed a wall around the speaker even as Manohar read out the resolution, put it to voice vote and declared it as having been passed. The bill will now be sent back to President Pranab Mukherjee after which it is slated to be tabled in Parliament.&lt;ref name="ap res"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lakshman|first=Ganesh|title=Andhra Pradesh assembly rejects Telangana Bill|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Andhra-Pradesh-assembly-rejects-Telangana-Bill/articleshow/29594366.cms|accessdate=30 Jan 2014|newspaper=Times of India|date=30 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AP Assembly rejects Telangana Bill, final say with Parliament|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/ap-assembly-rejects-telangana-bill-final-say-with-parliament/|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seemandhra leaders’ strategy takes T-counterparts by surprise|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/seemandhra-leaders-strategy-takes-tcounterparts-by-surprise/article5638041.ece|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was placed in the house and was declared passed within 15 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AP assembly approves cm's resolution to oppose the bill(video)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv7XwzVWWCc|publisher=V6 News|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts say "rejection of Telangana bill" is not valid and is useful only for political grand standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Valid Is the Chief Minister's Resolution Adopted by Voice Vote ?|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/andhra_pradesh/How-Valid-Is-the-Chief-Ministers-Resolution-Adopted-by-Voice-Vote-/2014/01/31/article2029490.ece|publisher=New Indian Express|accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Union cabinet minister Jaipal Reddy said that the resolution to reject the Telangana bill was passed in the assembly by cheating and it has no statutory and political sanctity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Telangana State soon: Jaipal|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/telangana-state-soon-jaipal/article5640660.ece|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; General secretary of Congress Party and party's in-charge for Andhra Pradesh, Digvijay Singh said that the bill that the President sent to the Assembly was never meant to be put to vote and said that the Congress high command and the Center would go ahead with its plans to introduce and pass the Telangana Bill in Parliament during the forthcoming session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hopeful of opposition support on Telangana Bill: Congress|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/hopeful-of-opposition-support-on-telangana-bill-congress/articleshow/29635081.cms|publisher=Economic Times|accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 February, Telangana bill was introduced in the [[Lok Sabha]], the lower house of Parliament, by Union home minister, [[Sushilkumar Shinde]] despite protests, disruptions of Seemandhra MPs.

'''''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers: Economic Change and Military Conflict from 1500 to 2000''''', by [[Paul Kennedy]], first published in 1987, explores the politics and economics of the [[Great Power]]s from 1500 to 1980 and the reason for their decline. It then continues by forecasting the positions of [[China]], [[Japan]], the [[European Community|European Economic Community]] (EEC), the [[Soviet Union]] and the United States through the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Summary==
Kennedy argues that the strength of a Great Power can be properly measured only relative to other powers, and he provides a straightforward and persuasively argued thesis: Great Power ascendancy (over the long term or in specific conflicts) correlates strongly to available resources and economic durability;  [[Imperial overstretch|military overstretch]] and a concomitant relative decline are the consistent threats facing powers whose ambitions and security requirements are greater than their resource base can provide for.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers: Economic Change and Military Conflict from 1500 to 2000'', New York, Vintage Books, 1987, {{ISBN|0679-720197}}, pp. 438–39.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Throughout the book he reiterates his early statement (page 71): "Military and naval endeavors may not always have been the [[wiktionary:raison d'être|''raison d'être'']] of the new nations-states, but it certainly was their most expensive and pressing activity", and it remains such until the power's decline.  He concludes that declining countries can experience greater difficulties in balancing their preferences for guns, butter and investments.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'', p. 535.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy states his theory in the second paragraph of the introduction as follows:  
:The "military conflict" referred to in the book's subtitle is therefore always examined in the context of "economic change."  The triumph of any one Great Power in this period, or the collapse of another, has usually been the consequence of lengthy fighting by its armed forces; but it has also been the consequences of the more or less efficient utilization of the state's productive economic resources in wartime, and, further in the background, of the way in which that state's economy had been rising or falling, ''relative'' to the other leading nations, in the decades preceding the actual conflict.  For that reason, how a Great Power's position steadily alters in peacetime, is as important to this study as how it fights in wartime.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'', p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy adds on the same page:
:The relative strengths of the leading nations in world affairs never remain constant, principally because of the uneven rate of growth among different societies and of the technological and organizational breakthroughs which bring a greater advantage to one society than to another.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'', p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern era===
The book starts at the dividing line between the [[Renaissance]] and [[early modern history]]—1500 (Chapter 1).  It briefly discusses the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] (page 4) and [[Ottoman Empire|Muslim]] worlds (page 9) of the time and the rise of the western powers relative to them (page 16).  The book then proceeds chronologically, looking at each of the power shifts over time and the effect on other Great Powers and the "[[Middle Power]]s".

Kennedy uses a number of measures to indicate real, relative and potential strength of nations throughout the book.  He changes the metric of power based on the point in time. Chapter 2, "The [[Habsburg]] [[France-Habsburg rivalry|Bid for Mastery]], 1519–1659" emphasizes the role of the "manpower revolution" in changing the way Europeans fought wars (see [[military revolution]]). This chapter also emphasizes the importance of Europe's political boundaries in shaping a political [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]].

:"The argument in this chapter is not, therefore, that the Habsburgs failed utterly to do what other powers achieved so brilliantly. There are no stunning contrasts in evidence here; success and failure are to be measured by very narrow differences. All states, even the United Provinces, were placed under severe strain by the constant drain of resources for military and naval campaigns... The victory of the anti-Habsburg forces was, then, a marginal and relative one. They had managed, but only just, to maintain the balance between their material base and their military power better than their Habsburg opponents." (page 72)

===European imperialism===
The Habsburg failure segues into the thesis of Chapter 3, that financial power reigned between 1660 and 1815, using [[Early Modern Britain|Britain]], [[Early Modern France|France]], [[Prussia]], [[Austria-Hungary]], and Russia to contrast between powers that could finance their wars (Britain and France) and powers that needed financial patronage to mobilize and maintain a major military force on the field. Kennedy presents a table (page 81, Table 2) of "British Wartime Expenditures and Revenue"; between 1688 and 1815 is especially illustrative, showing that Britain was able to maintain loans at around one-third of British wartime expenditures throughout that period
* Total Wartime Expenditures, 1688–1815: 2,293,483,437 Pounds,
* Total Income: 1,622,924,377 Pounds,
* Balance Raised by Loans: 670,559,060 Pounds, and
* Loans as % of Expenditure: 33.3%

The chapter also argues that British financial strength was ''the'' single most decisive factor in its victories over France during the 18th century. This chapter ends on the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the fusion of British financial strength with a newfound industrial strength.

===Industrial Revolution===
Kennedy's next two chapters depend greatly upon Bairoch's calculations of [[industrialization]], measuring all nations by an [[index (economics)|index]], where 100 is the British per capita industrialization rate in 1900. The United Kingdom grows from 10 in 1750, to 16 in 1800, 25 in 1830, 64 in 1860, 87 in 1880, to 100 in 1900 (page 149). In contrast, France's per capita industrialization was 9 in 1750, 9 in 1800, 12 in 1830, 20 in 1860, 28 in 1880, and 39 in 1900. Relative shares of world manufacturing output (also first appearing on page 149) are used to estimate the peaks and troughs of power for major states. China, for example, begins with 32.8% of global manufacturing in 1750 and plummets after the [[First Opium War]], [[Second Opium War]] and [[Taiping Rebellion]] to 19.7% of global manufacturing in 1860, and 12.5% in 1880 (compared to the UK's 1.9% in 1750, growing to 19.9% in 1860, and 22.9% in 1880).

===20th century===
Measures of strength in the 20th century (pages 199–203) use population size, [[urbanization]] rates, Bairoch's per capita levels of industrialization, iron and steel production, energy consumption (measured in millions of metric tons of coal equivalent), and total industrial output of the powers (measured against Britain's 1900 figure of 100), to gauge the strength of the various great powers.

Kennedy also emphasizes productivity increase, based on systematic interventions, which led to economic growth and prosperity for great powers in the 20th century.

He compares the great powers at the close of the 20th century and predicts the decline of the Soviet Union, the rise of China and Japan, the struggles and potential for the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), and the relative decline of the United States.  He highlights the precedence of the "four modernizations" in [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s plans for China—agriculture, industry, science and military—de-emphasizing military, while the United States and  Soviet Union are emphasizing it.  He predicts that continued [[deficit spending]], especially on military build-up, will be the single most important reason for decline of any great power.

===The United States===
From the Civil War to the first half of the 20th century, the United States' economy benefited from high agricultural production, plentiful raw materials, technological advancements and financial inflows.  During this time the U.S. did not have to contend with foreign dangers.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'', p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1860 to 1914, U.S. exports increased sevenfold, resulting in huge trade surpluses.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'', p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1945 the U.S. both enjoyed high [[productivity]] and was the only major industrialized nation intact after [[World War II]].  From the 1960s onward, the U.S. saw a relative decline in its share of world production and trade.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'', p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1980s, the U.S. experienced declining exports of agricultural and manufactured goods.  In the space of a few years, the U.S. went from being the largest creditor to the largest debtor nation.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy,  ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'', p. 526.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, the federal debt was growing at an increasing pace.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'', p. 527.&lt;/ref&gt;  This situation is typical of declining [[hegemons]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'', p. 529.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States has the typical problems of a great power, which include balancing [[Guns versus butter model|guns and butter]] and [[investment]]s for economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'', p. 535.&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S.' growing military commitment to every continent (other than [[Antarctica]]) and the growing cost of military hardware severely limit available options.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'', p. 514.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy compares the U.S.' situation to Great Britain's prior to [[World War I]].  He comments that the map of U.S. bases is similar to Great Britain's before World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'', p. 519.&lt;/ref&gt;

As military expenses grow, this reduces investments in economic growth, which eventually "leads to the downward spiral of slower growth, heavier taxes, deepening domestic splits over spending priorities, and weakening capacity to bear the burdens of defense."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'', p. 533.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy's advice is as follows:

:The task facing American statesmen over the next decades, therefore, is to recognize that broad trends are under way, and that there is a need to "manage" affairs so that the relative erosion of the United States' position takes place slowly and smoothly, and is not accelerated by policies which bring merely short-term advantage but longer-term disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'', p. 534&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Macedonia''' ({{lang-mk|Обединета Македонија}}, ''Obedineta Makedonija''), or '''Greater Macedonia''' ({{lang|mk|Голема Македонија}}, ''Golema Makedonija''), is an [[Irredentism|irredentist]] concept among [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic Macedonian]] [[nationalism|nationalists]] that aims to unify the transnational [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]] in [[Balkans|southeastern Europe]] (which they claim as their homeland and which they assert was wrongfully divided under the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]] in 1913) into a single state that would be dominated by ethnic Macedonians but all individuals in all ethnic groups, such as [[Greek Macedonians]] and [[Albanian Macedonians]], would have equal rights and protection under the law.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}{{dubious|date=August 2016}} The proposed capital of such a United Macedonia is the city of [[Thessaloniki]] or [[Salonika]] (''Solun'' in the [[South Slavic language|Slavic languages]]) in [[Greek Macedonia]], which ethnic Macedonians and the Yugoslav leader [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] had always dreamed of incorporating into their own states (along with the hinterland of [[Greek Macedonia]], which they came to call [[Aegean Macedonia]]).&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;Greek Macedonia "not a problem", ''The Times'' (London), August 5, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2GMihoOmF8 A large assembly of people during the inauguration of the Statue of Alexander the Great in Skopje], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kh25jfXxY2w the players of the national basketball team of the Republic of Macedonia during the European Basketball Championship in Lithuania], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97ucJP97Sto and a little girl], singing a nationalistic tune called Izlezi Momče (Излези момче, "Get out boy").

__TOC__

==History of the concept==
The concept of a united Macedonian region appeared initially in the late 19th century as variant called ''authonomous Macedonia'' in the documents of the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]]. The organization was founded in 1893 in Ottoman [[Thessaloniki]] by a small band of anti-Ottoman [[Macedonian Bulgarians|Macedono-Bulgarian]] revolutionaries,&lt;ref&gt;The Balkans. From Constantinople to Communism. Dennis P Hupchik, page 299&lt;/ref&gt; which considered Macedonia an indivisible territory and claimed all of its inhabitants "Macedonians", no matter their religion or ethnicity. The idea then was strictly political and did not imply a secession from Bulgarian ethnicity, but unity of all nationalities in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promacedonia.org/en/ib/i_banac.html The Macedoine, "The National Question in Yugoslavia. Origins, History, Politics", by Ivo Banac, Cornell University Press, 1984.]&lt;/ref&gt; The term "United Macedonia" has been in use since the early 1900s, notably in connection with the [[Balkan Socialist Federation]]. In the aftermatch of the First World War the conservative (pro-Bulgarian) fraction of the IMRO developed an agenda for an autonomous Macedonia, as it was a way for an unification with Bulgaria. [[Ivan Mihailov]] and [[Alexander Protogerov]], who assumed IMRO's leadership after Todor Alexandrov's death in 1924, changed the main task for an autonomous Macedonian state under Bulgarian control. By 1928, Mihailov proposed a new plan calling for unification of a pre-1913 Macedonia region into a single state, that would be autonomous from Bulgaria. Undergoing various transformations, the original organization was suppressed in the 1930s, at which time the territory of the current [[Republic of Macedonia]] was part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In 1944 the IMRO tried to create some form of [[Independent Macedonia (1944)|independent state]].&lt;ref&gt;"Collective Memory, National Identity, and Ethnic Conflict: Greece, Bulgaria, and the Macedonian Question," Victor Roudometof, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, {{ISBN|0275976483}}, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Yugoslav communist [[Svetozar Vukmanović]] the slogan about a united Macedonia first appeared in the manifesto of the HQ of the National Liberation of Army Macedonia, at the beginning of October 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Svetozar Vukmanovic, Struggle for the Balkans. London, Merlin Press 1980, 1990. Page 213&lt;/ref&gt; During the following operations of the [[National Liberation War of Macedonia]] the Communist combatants  developed aspirations over the geographic region of Macedonia that continued during the [[Greek Civil War]].

==After breakup of Yugoslavia==
In the modern era, ethnic Macedonian nationalists have called for a "United Macedonia" since 1989, reading "Solun (Thessaloniki) is ours" and "We fight for a United Macedonia".&lt;ref&gt;John Phillips, ''Macedonia: warlords and rebels in the Balkans'', I B Tauris Academic, 2002, p.53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bideleux, Ian Jeffries, ''The Balkans: a post-communist history'', Routledge, 2006, p. 410&lt;/ref&gt; Several maps depicting "United Macedonia" as an independent country which constitute clear evidence of irredentist claims of Macedonian nationalists against both Greek and Bulgarian territory circulated since the late 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s. In one of those maps all of [[Mount Olympus]] was incorporated in the territory of "United Macedonia".&lt;ref&gt;Loring M. Danforth, ''The Macedonian conflict: ethnic nationalism in a transnational world'', Princeton University Press, 1997, pp. 178, 182&lt;/ref&gt; The Macedonian nationalists&lt;ref&gt;Janusz Bugajski, ''Ethnic Politics in Eastern Europe: A Guide to Nationality Policies, Organizations and Parties'', Sharpe, M. E. Inc., 1994, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; break down the region of Macedonia as follows:

* [[Vardar Macedonia]] (Вардарска Македонија) which includes:
** the territory of the [[Republic of Macedonia]];
** [[Gora (region)|Gora]] (Гора), small portions of southern [[Kosovo]] and eastern Albania
** [[Prohor Pčinjski|Prohor Pčinski]] (Прохор Пчински), southern [[Serbia]]; and
* [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek Macedonia]] (or "Aegean Macedonia", "Егејска Македонија"), northern Greece;
* [[Blagoevgrad Province]] (or "Pirin Macedonia", "Пиринска Македонија"), southwestern Bulgaria; and
* [[Mala Prespa]] and [[Golo Brdo (Albania)|Golo Brdo]] (Мала Преспа и Голо Брдо), Albania.

Ethnic Macedonian nationalists describe the above areas as the unliberated parts of Macedonia and they claim that the majority of the population in those territories are oppressed ethnic Macedonians. In the cases of Bulgaria and Albania, it is said that they are undercounted in the censuses (In Albania, there are officially 5,000 ethnic Macedonians, whereas Macedonians nationalists claim the figures are more like 120,000-350,000.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} In Bulgaria, there are officially 1,400 ethnic Macedonians, whereas Macedonian nationalists claim 200,000.&lt;ref name="Bulgaria"/&gt; In Greece, there is a [[Minorities in Greece#Slavic-speaking|Slavic-speaking minority]] with various self-identifications (Macedonian, Greek, Bulgarian), estimated by [[Ethnologue]] and the [[Greek Helsinki Monitor]] as being between 100,000-200,000 (according to the [[Greek Helsinki Monitor]] only an estimated 10,000-30,000 have an ethnic Macedonian national identity&lt;ref name="Greece"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://miris.eurac.edu/mugs2/do/blob.html?type=html&amp;serial=1044526702223 |title=Report about Compliance with the Principles of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (along guidelines for state reports according to Article 25.1 of the Convention) |publisher=Greek Helsinki Monitor |date=18 September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The Macedonian government, led by nationalist party [[VMRO–DPMNE]], claimed that there is a Macedonian minority numbering up to 750,000.&lt;ref name="irredentist claims"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euractiv.com/enlargement/macedonia-erases-irredentist-cla-news-519167 |title=Macedonia erases 'irredentist' claims as Commission tables report |publisher=euroactiv |date=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The roots of the concept can be traced back to 1910. One of the main platforms from the First Balkan Socialist Conference in 1910 was the solution to the [[Macedonian Question]], [[Georgi Dimitrov]], a Bulgarian Communist politician, in 1915 writes that the creation of a "Macedonia, which was split into three parts, was to be reunited into a single state enjoying equal rights within the framework of the [[Balkan Democratic Federation]]".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a united Macedonia was used by revolutionaries from the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) too. In 1920-1934 their leaders - [[Todor Alexandrov]], [[Aleksandar Protogerov]], [[Ivan Mihailov]], etc., accept this concept with the aim to liberate the territories occupied by Serbia and Greece and to create an independent Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qMZaPjrHqYYC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=Mihailov,+Macedonia%3B+A+Switzerland++Balkans++bulgarian+state&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0yYmIhg_RY&amp;sig=02lJ-7e3CdBMu8FvGf5TifBGDek&amp;hl=bg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=%20Switzerland%20%20Balkans%20%20&amp;f=false Balkan Strongmen: Dictators and Authoritarian Rulers of South Eastern Europe, Central Europe Studies, Professor Bernd J Fischer, Purdue University Press, 2007], {{ISBN|1557534551}}, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulgarian government of [[Alexander Malinov]] in 1918 offered to give Pirin Macedonia to such a united Macedonia after [[World War I]],&lt;ref&gt;Gerginov, Kr., Bilyarski, Ts.

Непубликувани документи за дейността на Тодор Александров 1910-1919, сп. ВИС, кн. 2 от 1987, с. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; but the Great Powers did not adopt this idea, because Serbia and Greece opposed. In 1924, the [[Comintern|Communist International]] suggested that all Balkan communist parties adopt a platform of a "united Macedonia" but the suggestion was rejected by the Bulgarian and Greek communists.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Roudometof, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Xoww453NVQMC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=%22united+macedonia%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ljXeTs7gCZHCtAbvzPHtCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22united%20macedonia%22&amp;f=false ''Collective Memory, National Identity, and Ethnic Conflict: Greece, Bulgaria, and the Macedonian Question''], Praeger, 2002 p.100&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a united Macedonia under communist rule was abandoned in 1948 when the Greek communists lost in the [[Greek Civil War]], and Tito fell out with the Soviet Union and pro-Soviet Bulgaria.

In its first resolution, [[VMRO–DPMNE]], the nationalistic&lt;ref&gt;Alan John Day, ''Political parties of the world'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Poulton, ''Who are the Macedonians?'', Hurst &amp; Company, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loring M. Danforth, ''The Macedonian conflict: ethnic nationalism in a transnational world'', Princeton University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher K. Lamont, ''International Criminal Justice and the Politics of Compliance'', Ashgate, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch World Report, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Imogen Bell, ''Central and South-Eastern Europe 2004'', Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keith Brown, ''The past in question: modern Macedonia and the uncertainties of nation'', Princeton University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; governing party of the Republic of Macedonia, adopted the platform of a "United Macedonia",&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Brown, Richard N. Rosecrance, ''The costs of conflict: prevention and cure in the global arena'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 1999, p.133&lt;/ref&gt; an act that has annoyed moderate ethnic Macedonian politicians and has also been regarded by Greece as an intolerable irredentist claim against Macedonia, its northern province.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Ackermann, ''Making peace prevail: preventing violent conflict in Macedonia'', Syracuse University Press, 2000, p.96&lt;/ref&gt;

Before and just after the Republic of Macedonia's independence, it was assumed in Greece that the idea of a united Macedonia was still state-sponsored. In the [[Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia|constitution of the newly independent Republic of Macedonia]], adopted on 17 November 1991, Article 49 read as follows:&lt;ref name="Constitution"&gt;''[http://www.oefre.unibe.ch/law/icl/mk00000_.html Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616100058/http://www.oefre.unibe.ch/law/icl/mk00000_.html |date=2006-06-16 }}'', adopted 17 November 1991, amended on 6 January 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

:(1) The Republic cares for the status and rights of those persons belonging to the Macedonian people in neighbouring countries, as well as Macedonian expatriates, assists their cultural development and promotes links with them.
:(2) The Republic cares for the cultural, economic and social rights of the citizens of the Republic abroad.

On 13 September 1995, the Republic of Macedonia signed an Interim Accord with Greece &lt;ref name="Accord"&gt;[http://www.hri.org/docs/fyrom/95-27866.html "Interim Accord between the Hellenic Republic and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"], United Nations, 13 September 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to end the economic [[embargo]] Greece had imposed, amongst other reasons, for the perceived land claims. Amongst its provisions, the Accord specified that Macedonia would renounce all land claims to neighbouring states' territories.

The United Macedonia concept is still found among official sources in the Republic,&lt;ref name="Bulgaria"&gt;{{cite web | last = Lenkova | first = M. |editor=Dimitras, P. |editor2=Papanikolatos, N. |editor3=Law, C. | title =Greek Helsinki Monitor: Macedonians of Bulgaria | work = Minorities in Southeast Europe | publisher =Greek Helsinki Monitor, Center for Documentation and Information on Minorities in Europe — Southeast Europe | year = 1999 | url = http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/pdf/cedime-se-bulgaria-macedonians.PDF | format = pdf | accessdate= July 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Currency"&gt;{{cite news| first=Marlise |last=Simons  |title=As Republic Flexes, Greeks Tense Up |date=February 3, 1992 |publisher=New York Times | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DD103CF930A35751C0A964958260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Danforth&gt;{{cite book| title=How can a woman give birth to one Greek and one Macedonian? | url= http://www.gate.net/~mango/How_can_a_woman_give_birth.htm | work=The construction of national identity among immigrants to Australia from Northern Greece | first=Loring M. | last= Danforth |accessdate=2006-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and taught in schools through school textbooks and through other governmental publications.&lt;ref&gt;''Facts About the Republic of Macedonia'' - annual booklets since 1992, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia Secretariat of Information, Second edition, 1997, {{ISBN|9989-42-044-0}}. p.14. 2 August 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Macedonianism: Macedonia's expansionist designs against Greece after the Interim Accord (1995)'', Society for Macedonian Studies, Ephesus Publishing, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Universal College Application''' (also known as the '''Universal College App''')  is a US-based organization which provides [[College admissions in the United States|college admission]] [[College application|application]]s that allows students to apply to any of the participating colleges.

==Overview==
The for-profit Universal College Application is accepted by 34&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.universalcollegeapp.com/member-colleges | title = Colleges | work = Universal College Application | publisher = ApplicationsOnline, LLC | accessdate = March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; higher education institutions in the [[United States]] (as of December 2016). It was started in 2007.&lt;ref name=Zipkin&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/07/education/edlife/07zipkin-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 | title = There's More Than One Way To Apply to College | first = Amy | last = Zipkin | date = November 7, 2010 | work = The New York Times | page = ED24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varied numbers of institutions accept this application; 77 used the service in 2010.&lt;ref name=Zipkin/&gt; In addition to the Universal College Application, a school may have its own application materials. The Universal College Application was created for use by any size or type of [[higher education]] institution.

One intention of the Universal College Application is to save time and work for students by letting them submit the same application to any of the participating colleges. This is similar to the more popular [[Common Application]], the Universal College Application's main competitor. Most of the schools participating in the Universal College Application also accept the Common Application.&lt;ref name=Zipkin/&gt;&lt;ref name=CollegeMadeSimple&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.collegemadesimple.com/common-vs-universal-app/ | title = The Common Application vs. the Universal Application: The differences between the two leading generic application providers | first = Scott | last = Weingold | work = CollegeMadeSimple.com | publisher = College Planning Network, LLC | accessdate = March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike some of its competitors, the Universal College Application does not try to reflect a certain educational philosophy.&lt;ref name=Zipkin/&gt;&lt;ref name=CollegeMadeSimple/&gt; Besides fees, the Universal College Application's only demand for schools to participate is for them to be accredited and uphold the [[National Association for College Admission Counseling]]'s ''Statement of Principles of Good Practice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ecampustours.com/collegeplanning/applyingforcollege/collegeapplications | title = Applying to college: common, universal college, and individual applications | date = August 18, 2014 | work = eCampusTours.com | publisher = eCampusTours}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

===Forms===
The Universal College App consists of five main data entry pages, which students must complete in order to submit their application online. The Universal College App also contains a page where students choose the college or colleges to which they want to apply.

In addition to the Universal College App, which can be submitted online or by mail, students may be required to submit, among other things, their college admission test scores ([[SAT]] or [[ACT (test)|ACT]]), a School Report, an Instructor Recommendation, and a Midyear Report by mail.

===Fees===
The application fees are the same as any other application accepted by a participating college. The application fees are paid directly to the selected colleges according to their requirement. There is no extra charge to apply using the Universal College Application.

'''White gods''' is the belief that [[ancient]] [[cultures]] around the world were visited by [[Caucasian race]]s in ancient times, and that they were known as "White gods".

Based on 16th-century accounts of the Spanish [[conquistadors]] being "greeted as gods" by the peoples of the [[New World]], certain modern authors have expanded the concept beyond what is historically verifiable, spreading it to the genre of [[pseudoarchaeological]] literature and [[fringe theory|fringe theorists]], such as writers on [[ancient astronaut]]s or [[Atlantis]], in some instances (such as [[Christian Identity]]) even acquiring quasi-religious or racialist ([[white supremacist]]) connotations.

Some [[authors]] have claimed that white missionaries or "gods" visited [[Americas|America]] before [[Christopher Columbus]]. Authors usually quote from [[mythology]] and [[legend]]s which discuss ancient gods such as [[Quetzalcoatl]] to conclude that the legends were actually based on [[White people|Caucasians]] visiting those areas, and that the Caucasians were really the gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0osWcOoQGf4C&amp;pg=PA254&amp;dq=white+gods&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gpb3TYikLtCt8QOVnvjKCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=white%20gods&amp;f=false |title=Myths of Pre-Columbian America – Donald A.

[[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[chroniclers]] from the 16th century claimed that when the [[conquistadors]] led by [[Francisco Pizarro]] first encountered the Incas they were greeted as gods, "Viracochas", because their lighter skin resembled their god named [[Viracocha]].&lt;ref&gt;''Colonial Spanish America: a documentary history'', Kenneth R. Mills, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1998, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; This story was first reported by [[Pedro Cieza de León]] (1553) and later by [[Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa]]. Similar accounts by Spanish chroniclers (e.g. [[Juan de Betanzos]]) describe Viracocha as a "White God", often with a beard.&lt;ref&gt;''Pre-Columbian America: Myths and Legends'', Donald. A. Mackenzie, Senate, 1996, p.268-270&lt;/ref&gt;

Rupert Furneaux also linked "White gods" to the ancient city of [[Tiahuanaco]].&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Furneaux, Ancient Mysteries, Ballantine Books, 1987, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonel A. Braghine in his 1940 book ''The Shadow of Atlantis'' claimed that the [[Kalina people|Carib people]] have reports and legends of a white bearded man whom they called ''Tamu'' or ''Zune'' who had come from the East, taught the people [[agriculture]] and later disappeared in an "easterly direction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2aqoUiUp3u8C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=colonel+braghine+zukha&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=k8L3Ta_vDcKy8QOwuomrCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4QuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Shadow of Atlantis 1940 – A.

The [[archaeologist]] Pierre Honoré in 1962 proposed the [[fringe theory]] that the pre-Columbian Mesoamerican civilizations were due to "white men from the vicinity of Crete".&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Honoré, ''In quest of the white god: the mysterious heritage of South American civilization'',  Futura Publications (1962). In  2007, the book was reprinted as ''In Search of Quetzalcoatl: The Mysterious Heritage of American Civilization''.

The writer [[Robert F. Marx]] has written extensively about the concept of "White gods". Marx came to the conclusion that white gods "figure in almost every indigenous culture in the Americas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jonathan Kirsch|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-01-22/news/vw-383_1_great-white-god |title=BOOK REVIEW : Memoir Masquerades as History in 'Quest of Great White Gods' : IN QUEST OF THE GREAT WHITE GODS, Contact Between the Old and New World From the Dawn of History by Robert F.

The [[United Kingdom|British]] writer [[Harold T. Wilkins]] took the concept of the white gods the furthest, writing that a vanished white race had occupied the whole of [[South America]] in ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;The Pan American, Volume 7, Famous Features Syndicate, 1946, p. 11 "Harold T. Wilkins Legend of a Fabulous Empire" discusses Wilkins belief about a "strange white race living in lost cities, amidst the crumbling ruins of once splendid palaces and temples in South America"&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkins also claimed that [[Quetzalcoatl]] was from [[Atlantis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eh1WHqo0JN8C&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=white+gods+harold+wilkins&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VKb3TbGGGIfA8QOPxeWyCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDwQuwUwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Lost Cities of North &amp; Central America – David Hatcher Childress – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uDTUF3wHlkoC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=white+gods+harold+wilkins&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5qj3TbLCCYbF8QPB65TeCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDEQuwUwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Mysteries of Ancient South America – Harold T.

The [[occultist]] [[James H. Madole]], influenced by [[Aryanism]] and [[Hinduism]], wrote that the [[Aryan race]] was of great antiquity and had been worshipped worldwide by lower races as "white gods". Madole also wrote that the Aryans originated in the [[Garden of Eden]] located in [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity, 2003 p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern scholars consider the "White God legends" to be a post-conquest Spanish invention and that the ideas are based on [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Skeptic: encyclopedia of Pseudoscience'', "white god legends", Michael Shermer, ABC-CLIO, 2002, p. 578.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 1998, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mormonism==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
{{see also|Archaeology and the Book of Mormon|Proposed Book of Mormon geographical setting|Mormon folklore}}

Some [[Mormon]]s believe that [[Quetzalcoatl]], a figure described as white and bearded, who came from the sky and promised to return, was likely [[Jesus Christ]]. According to the scriptural account recorded in the [[Book of Mormon]], Jesus Christ visited and taught natives of the Americas following his resurrection, and regarded them as the "other sheep" whom he had referenced during his mortal ministry. The Book of Mormon also claims that Jesus Christ appeared to others, following his resurrection, even to the inhabitants on the "isles of the sea."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/jbms/?vol=11&amp;num=1&amp;id=298 |author= Wirth, Diane E. |date= 2002 |title= Quetzalcoatl, the Maya maize god and Jesus Christ |journal= Journal of Book of Mormon Studies |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |pages= 4–15 |location= Provo, Utah |publisher= [[Maxwell Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the Mexican legend, [[LDS Church]] [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President]] [[John Taylor (Mormon)|John Taylor]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The story of the life of the Mexican divinity, Quetzalcoatl, closely resembles that of the Savior; so closely, indeed, that we can come to no other conclusion than that Quetzalcoatl and Christ are the same being.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author= Taylor, John |author-link= John Taylor (Mormon) |date= 1892 |origyear= 1882 |title= An Examination into and an Elucidation of the Great Principle of the Mediation and Atonement of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ |publisher= [[Deseret News]] |page= 201 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QmQoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA201&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This idea was adapted by Mormon science fiction author [[Orson Scott Card]] in his story ''[[America (short story)|America]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Ancient astronauts==
Some [[Ancient astronaut]] and [[UFO]] writers have claimed the "white gods" were actually [[extraterrestrials]]. [[Peter Kolosimo]] believed that the legends of [[Quetzalcoatl]] had a basis in fact.  He claimed that the legends actually describe a race of white men who were born in spaceships and migrated to [[Atlantis]]; then, after Atlantis was destroyed, they moved to the [[Americas]] to be treated as "white gods" by the "primitive earth-dwellers".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kolosimo, Timeless Earth, 1977 pp. 153 – 154 {{ISBN|0-7221-5329-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
