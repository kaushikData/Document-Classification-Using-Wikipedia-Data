[[File:Corrientes-oceanicas-en.svg|thumb|Alaska Current in red.]]

The '''Alaska Current''' is a southwestern warm-water current along the coast of [[British Columbia]] and the [[Alaska Panhandle]]. The current results from the northward diversion of a portion of the [[North Pacific Current]] when that current meets the west coast of the [[North America|North American continent]]. It forms a part of the Alaska Current and continues into the Alaskan Stream, which begins near [[Kodiak Island]] and flows southwestward along the [[Alaska Peninsula]]. The Alaska Current produces large clockwise eddies at two sites: west of the [[Haida Gwaii|Queen Charlotte Islands]] ("Queen Charlotte Eddy" or "[[Haida Eddies]]") and west of [[Sitka, Alaska]] ("Sitka Eddy").

The '''Baritú National Park''' ({{lang-es|Parque Nacional Baritú}}) is a [[national park]] in [[Argentina]], located in the Santa Victoria Department, in the north of the [[provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Salta Province|Salta]], in the [[Argentine Northwest]]. The park borders Bolivia (Tarija province), and its only road access is through that country. It has an area of {{convert|720|km2|ha|lk=in}} and it is the only tropical park in Argentina.

The park was created in 1974. It is bordered by mountains. The protected area belongs to the [[Southern Andean Yungas]] [[ecoregion]], which is located in the Sub-Andean mountain range, with heights averaging {{convert|1500|-|2500|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The climate is wet and hot, with summer rainfall that goes from {{convert|900|-|1300|mm|in|abbr=on}}.

The [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] of the park includes several [[endangered species]], such as the [[South American jaguar|jaguar]] and the [[onza]].

The ''cedro salteño'' trees ("Salta [[cedrela]]s") reach huge sizes in this region. Their wood is considered extremely valuable.

'''Ben Nevis''' ({{lang-gd|Beinn Nibheis}}, {{IPA-gd|peˈɲivəʃ|pron}}; {{IPAc-en|lang|b|ɛ|n|ˈ|n|ɛ|v|ɪ|s}}) is the highest mountain in the [[British Isles]]. Standing at {{convert|1,344.527|m|ft|0|adj=ri0}}&lt;ref name="OS revision"/&gt; above sea level, it is at the western end of the [[Grampian Mountains (Scotland)|Grampian Mountains]] in the [[Lochaber]] area of the [[Scottish Highlands]], close to the town of [[Fort William, Highland|Fort William]].

The mountain is a popular destination, attracting an estimated 100,000 ascents a year,&lt;ref name="JMT"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.johnmuirtrust.org/trust-land/ben-nevis |title=Ben Nevis |accessdate=30 October 2016 |publisher=[[John Muir Trust]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; around three-quarters of which use the Pony Track from [[Glen Nevis]].&lt;ref name="Strategy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nevispartnership.co.uk/pdf/newnevis_strategy_summary.pdf|title=Nevis Strategy|accessdate=5 November 2006|author=The Nevis Working Party|format=PDF|year=2001| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061104163426/http://www.nevispartnership.co.uk/pdf/newnevis_strategy_summary.pdf| archivedate= 4 November 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The {{convert|700|m|adj=on}} cliffs of the north face are among the highest in Scotland, providing classic [[scrambling|scrambles]] and [[rock climbing|rock climbs]] of all difficulties for climbers and [[mountaineering|mountaineers]]. They are also the principal locations in Scotland for [[ice climbing]].

The summit, which is the collapsed dome of an ancient [[volcano]],&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; features the ruins of an [[observatory]] which was continuously staffed between 1883 and 1904. The [[meteorology|meteorological]] data collected during this period are still important for understanding Scottish mountain weather. [[C. T. R. Wilson]] was inspired to invent the [[cloud chamber]] after a period spent working at the observatory.

== Etymology ==
"Ben Nevis" is an [[Anglicisation]] of the [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] name "Beinn Nibheis". "Beinn" is the most common Gaelic word for "mountain", "Nibheis" is variously understood, though the word is commonly translated as "malicious" or "venomous".&lt;ref name="Butterfield 96"&gt;Butterfield, ''The High Mountains'', p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative interpretation is that "Beinn Nibheis" derives from "beinn nèamh-bhathais", from "nèamh" "heavens, clouds" and "bathais" "top of a man's head". One translation would therefore be "the mountain with its head in the clouds",&lt;ref name="Murray"/&gt; though "mountain of Heaven" is also frequently given.&lt;ref name="Butterfield 96"/&gt;

As is common for many [[Scottish mountains]], it is known both to locals and visitors as simply "the Ben".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ben Nevis, or the 'Ben' as it is fondly known locally|url=http://www.visit-fortwilliam.co.uk/mf_bennevis.html|publisher=Visit Fort William Ltd |accessdate=23 October 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071018020835/http://www.visit-fortwilliam.co.uk/mf_bennevis.html| archivedate= 18 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ben Nevis is almost always referred to by climbers as simply The Ben (Ben meaning Mountain)|url=http://www.takeupthechallenge.com/pages/page-nevis-history.htm|publisher=The Ben Nevis Challenge|accessdate=23 October 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103202517/http://www.takeupthechallenge.com/pages/page-nevis-history.htm|archivedate=3 November 2007|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
Ben Nevis forms a [[massif]] with its neighbour to the northeast, [[Càrn Mòr Dearg]], to which it is linked by the Càrn Mòr Dearg [[Arête]].&lt;ref name="OS"&gt;Ordnance Survey ''Landranger'' 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Both mountains are among the nine in Scotland over {{convert|4000|ft}}; [[Aonach Beag]] and [[Aonach Mòr]] are also on the Nevis massif.
[[File:Ben Nevis massif.PNG|thumb|left|Western flank of the Nevis massif; from [[Sgùrr Dhòmhnuill]]]]
The western and southern flanks of Ben Nevis rise {{convert|1200|m}} in about {{convert|2|km}} from the floor of Glen Nevis&amp;nbsp;– the longest and steepest hill slope in Britain&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;W. H. Murray, ''The Companion Guide to the West Highlands of Scotland''&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– with the result that the mountain presents an aspect of massive bulk on this side. To the north, by contrast, cliffs drop some {{convert|600|m}} to Coire Leis (pronounced Koruh Laysh.)[[File:Cic-2.jpg|thumb|Charles Inglis Clark Memorial Hut with the Carn Dearg Buttress behind]] A descent of 200 metres from this [[Cirque|corrie]] leads to the Charles Inglis Clark Memorial Hut (known as the CIC Hut), a private [[mountain hut]] {{convert|680|m}} above sea level, owned by the [[Scottish Mountaineering Club]]&lt;ref name="CIC"/&gt; and used as a base for the many [[climbing]] routes on the mountain's north face. The hut is just above the confluence of Allt a' Mhuilinn and Allt Coire na Ciste.
[[File:Cic-1.jpg|thumb|Memorial Plaque on the door of the CIC Hut]]

In addition to the main {{convert|1345|m|ft|0|adj=mid}} summit, Ben Nevis has two subsidiary "tops" listed in [[Munro's Tables]], both of which are called Càrn Dearg ("red hill").&lt;ref name="Munros"&gt;{{cite book | author=D.A. Bearhop | year=1997 | title=Munro's Tables | isbn=0-907521-53-3 | publisher=Scottish Mountaineering Club &amp; Trust | editor=revised and edited by Derek A. Bearhop.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher of these, at {{convert|1221|m}}, is to the northwest, and is often mistaken for Ben Nevis itself in views from the Fort William area. The other Càrn Dearg ({{convert|1020|m|abbr=on}}) juts out into Glen Nevis on the mountain's southwestern side. A lower hill, Meall an t-Suidhe ({{convert|711|m}}), is further west, forming a saddle with Ben Nevis which contains a small [[loch]], Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe. The popular tourist path from Glen Nevis skirts the side of this hill before ascending Ben Nevis's broad western flank.

=== Geology ===
Ben Nevis is all that remains of a [[Devonian]] [[volcano]] that met a cataclysmic end in the [[Carboniferous]] period around 350 million years ago. Evidence near the summit shows light-coloured granite (which had cooled in subterranean chambers several kilometres beneath the surface) lies among dark basaltic lavas (that form only on the surface). The two lying side-by-side is evidence the huge volcano collapsed in on itself creating an explosion comparable to [[Minoan eruption|Thera]] ([[2nd millennium BC]]) or [[Krakatoa]] (1883).&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18674655|title=How volcanoes shaped Britain's landscape|work=BBC News|date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The mountain is now all that remains of the imploded inner dome of the volcano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ben-nevis.com/information/geology/geology.php|title=Geology of Ben Nevis|publisher=ben-nevis.com|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Its form has been extensively shaped by [[glaciation]].&lt;ref&gt;

Research has shown [[igneous]] rock from the Devonian period (around 400 million years ago) [[intrusion|intrudes]] into the surrounding metamorphic [[schist]]s; the intrusions take the form of a series of concentric [[ring dike]]s. The innermost of these, known as the Inner Granite, constitutes the southern bulk of the mountain above Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, and also the neighbouring ridge of Càrn Mòr Dearg; Meall an t-Suidhe forms part of the Outer Granite, which is redder in colour. The summit dome itself, together with the steep northern cliffs, is composed of [[andesite]] and [[basaltic]] lavas.&lt;ref&gt;McKirdy, Alan Gordon, John &amp; Crofts, Roger (2007) ''Land of Mountain and Flood: The Geology and Landforms of Scotland''.

=== Climate ===
[[File:Ben Nevis south face.jpg|thumb|The steep south face of Ben Nevis from [[Sgurr a' Mhàim]]]]
Ben Nevis has a highland (alpine) maritime (oceanic) [[Polar climate]] (''ET'' climate in Köppen's classification). Ben Nevis's altitude, maritime location and topography frequently lead to cool and cloudy weather conditions, which can pose a danger to ill-equipped walkers. According to the observations carried out at the summit observatory from 1883–1904, fog was present on the summit for almost 80 per cent of the time between November and January, and 55 per cent of the time in May and June.&lt;ref name="Roy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meteohistory.org/2004polling%5Fpreprints/docs/abstracts/roy2_poster.pdf|title=The Ben Nevis Meteorological Observatory 1883–1904|accessdate=27 November 2006|author=Marjorie Roy|year=2004|format=PDF |publisher=International Commission on History of Meteorology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average winter temperature was around {{convert|-5|C}},&lt;ref name="Roy"/&gt; and the mean monthly temperature for the year was {{convert|-0.5|C}}.&lt;ref name="Murray 221"&gt;Murray, ''Companion Guide'', p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; In an average year the summit sees 261&amp;nbsp;gales,&lt;ref name="Murray 221"/&gt; and receives {{convert|4350|mm}} of rainfall, compared to only {{convert|2050|mm}} in nearby Fort William,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Langmuir|year=1995 |title=Mountaincraft and Leadership (Third edition)|publisher=SportScotland, Edinburgh|isbn=1-85060-295-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|840|mm}} in [[Inverness]] and {{convert|580|mm}} in London. Rainfall on Ben Nevis is about twice as high in the winter as it is in the spring and summer. Snow can be found on the mountain almost [[Snow patches in Scotland|all year round]], particularly in the gullies of the north face&amp;nbsp;– with the higher reaches of Observatory Gully holding snow until September most years and sometimes until the new snows of the following season.

== History ==
[[File:Ben Nevis. From FWVL.jpg|thumb|right|Ben Nevis viewed from [[Neptune's Staircase]]]]

The first recorded ascent of Ben Nevis was made on 17 August 1771 by James Robertson, an [[Edinburgh]] [[botany|botanist]], who was in the region to collect botanical specimens. Another early ascent was in 1774 by John Williams, who provided the first account of the mountain's geological structure.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Suzanne Miller |year=2004 |title=Ben Nevis Geology |journal=The Edinburgh Geologist |volume=43 |pages=3–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Keats]] climbed the mountain in 1818, comparing the ascent to "mounting ten [[St Paul's Cathedral|St. Pauls]] without the convenience of a staircase".&lt;ref name="Hodgkiss 117"&gt;Hodgkiss, ''The Central Highlands'', p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; The following year [[William MacGillivray]], who was later to become a distinguished naturalist, reached the summit only to find "fragments of earthen and glass ware, chicken bones, corks, and bits of paper".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hunter|first1=Andrew|title=Bones on Ben Nevis - a walk back into history|journal=Leopard Magazine|date=September 2014|pages=30–34|issn=2053-9851}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1847 that Ben Nevis was confirmed by the [[Ordnance Survey]] as the highest mountain in Britain and Ireland, ahead of its rival [[Ben Macdhui (Scotland)|Ben Macdhui]].

The [[#Observatory|summit observatory]] was built in the summer of 1883, and would remain in operation for 21 years. The first [[trail|path]] to the summit was built at the same time as the observatory and was designed to allow [[pony|ponies]] to carry up supplies, with a maximum gradient of one in five.&lt;ref name="Roy"/&gt; The opening of the path and the observatory made the ascent of the Ben increasingly popular, all the more so after the arrival of the [[West Highland Railway]] in Fort William in 1894.&lt;ref name="MacLennan"/&gt; Around this time the first of several proposals was made for a [[rack railway]] to the summit, none of which came to fruition.&lt;ref name="Hodgkiss 117"/&gt;

In 2000, the Ben Nevis Estate, comprising all of the south side of the mountain including the summit, was bought by the Scottish conservation charity the [[John Muir Trust]].

In 2016, the height of Ben Nevis was officially remeasured to be 1344.527m by [[Ordnance Survey]]. The height of Ben Nevis will therefore be shown on new Ordnance Survey maps as {{convert|1,345|m|ft|0|adj=ri0}} instead of the now obsolete value of {{convert|1,344|m|ft|0|adj=ri0}}.&lt;ref name="OS revision"/&gt;

== Ascent routes ==
[[File:Path Up Ben Nevis.JPG|thumb|left|An old postcard view showing the path up Ben Nevis]]
The 1883 Pony Track to the summit (also known as the ''Ben Path'', the ''Mountain Path'' or the ''Tourist Route'') remains the simplest and most popular route of ascent. It begins at [[Achintee, Fort William|Achintee]] on the east side of Glen Nevis about {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Fort William town centre, at around 20 metres above sea level.

The path is regularly maintained but running water, uneven rocks and loose scree make it hazardous and slippery in places. Thanks to the zig-zags, the path is not unusually steep apart from in the initial stages, but inexperienced walkers should be aware that the descent is relatively arduous and wearing on the knees.

A route popular with experienced [[hillwalking|hillwalkers]] starts at Torlundy, a few miles north-east of Fort William on the [[A82 road]], and follows the path alongside the Allt a' Mhuilinn. It can also be reached from Glen Nevis by following the Pony Track as far as Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, then descending slightly to the CIC Hut. The route then ascends Càrn Mòr Dearg and continues along the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arête ("CMD Arête") before climbing steeply to the summit of Ben Nevis. This route involves a total of 1,500 metres of ascent and requires modest scrambling ability and a [[head for heights]].&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield, ''The High Mountains'', p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; In common with other approaches on this side of the mountain, it has the advantage of giving an extensive view of the cliffs of the north face, which are hidden from the Pony Track.&lt;ref name="Butterfield 97"/&gt;

It is also possible to climb Ben Nevis from the Nevis Gorge car park at Steal at the head of the road up Glen Nevis, either by the south-east ridge or via the summit of Càrn Dearg (south-west). These routes require mild scrambling, are shorter and steeper than the Pony Track, and tend only to be used by experienced hill walkers.

== Summit ==
The summit of Ben Nevis comprises a large stony [[plateau]] of about {{convert|40|ha|-1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9078533|title=Ben Nevis|accessdate=25 November 2006|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}} (Subscription required for full access.)&lt;/ref&gt; The highest point is marked with a large, solidly built [[cairn]] atop which sits an Ordnance Survey [[trig point]]. The summit is the highest ground for over {{convert|400|mi|km}}, before the [[Scandinavian Mountains]] in [[west]]ern [[Norway]] are reached, which contain many peaks higher than Ben Nevis. The summit is much higher than the [[Faroe Islands]] as well as the rest of the British Isles.

The ruined walls of the observatory are a prominent feature on the summit. An emergency shelter has been built on top of the observatory tower for the benefit of those caught out by bad weather. Although the base of the tower is slightly lower than the true summit of the mountain, the roof of the shelter overtops the trig point by several feet, making it the highest man-made structure in the UK. A [[war memorial]] to the dead of [[World War II]] is located next to the observatory.

On 17 May 2006, a piano that had been buried under one of the cairns on the peak was uncovered by the [[John Muir Trust]], which owns much of the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/may/17/arts.artsnews1 |title=Piano found on Britain's highest mountain | location=London | date=17 May 2006| accessdate= 30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/highlands_and_islands/4994552.stm |title=New twist in Nevis music mystery |accessdate=22 June 2006 | date=18 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piano is believed to have been carried up for charity by removal men from [[Dundee]] over 20&amp;nbsp;years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/4998440.stm |title=Trust names Ben Nevis 'piano men' |accessdate=15 August 2006 | date=19 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The view from the UK's highest point is extensive. Under ideal conditions, it can extend to over {{convert|190|km}}, including such mountains as the [[Torridon Hills]], [[Morven, Caithness|Morven]] in [[Caithness]], [[Lochnagar]], [[Ben Lomond]], [[Barra Head]] and to [[Knocklayd]] in [[County Antrim]], Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Viewfinder Panoramas: [http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/panoramas/GRW/NEVIS-North.gif North], [http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/panoramas/GRW/Nevis-South.gif South].

=== Observatory ===
A meteorological observatory on the summit was first proposed by the [[Scottish Meteorological Society]] (SMS) in the late-1870s, at a time when similar observatories were being built around the world to study the weather at high altitude.&lt;ref name="Roy"/&gt; In the summer of 1881, [[Clement Lindley Wragge]] climbed the mountain daily to make observations (earning him the nickname "Inclement Rag"), leading to the opening on 17 October 1883 of a permanent observatory run by the SMS.&lt;ref name=crocket1986&gt;{{cite book|last=Crocket|first=Ken|title=Ben Nevis : Britain's highest mountain|year=1986|publisher=Scottish Mountaineering Trust|location=Glasgow|isbn=0907521169|pages=41–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was manned full-time until 1904, when it was closed due to inadequate funding. The twenty years worth of readings still provide the most comprehensive set of data on mountain weather in Great Britain.&lt;ref name="Roy"/&gt;

In September 1894, [[C. T. R. Wilson]] was employed at the observatory for a couple of weeks as temporary relief for one of the permanent staff. During this period, he witnessed a [[Brocken spectre]] and [[glory (optical phenomenon)|glory]], caused by the sun casting a shadow on a cloud below the observer. He subsequently tried to reproduce these phenomena in the laboratory, resulting in his invention of the [[cloud chamber]], used to detect [[ionising radiation]].&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1927/wilson-bio.html |title=C.

== Navigation and safety ==
[[File:Ben Nevis cornice.jpg|thumb|right|View south-west from the summit in early April. When the cliff edges are [[cornice (climbing)|corniced]], accurate navigation is critical.]]
Ben Nevis's popularity, climate and complex [[topography]] contribute to a high number of [[mountain rescue]] incidents. In 1999, for example, there were 41 rescues and four fatalities on the mountain.&lt;ref name="Strategy"/&gt;&lt;!--Compared to what?--&gt; Some accidents arise over difficulties in [[navigation|navigating]] to or from the summit,&lt;ref name="MCofS Newsletter"/&gt; especially in poor visibility. The problem stems from the fact that the summit plateau is roughly [[kidney]]-shaped and surrounded by cliffs on three sides; the danger is particularly accentuated when the main path is obscured by snow. Two precise [[compass]] [[bearing (navigation)|bearings]] taken in succession are necessary to navigate from the summit cairn to the west flank, from where a descent can be made on the Pony Track in relative safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcofs.org.uk/ben-nevis-navigation.asp |title=Navigation on Ben Nevis  |publisher=[[Mountaineering Scotland]] |website=www.mcofs.org.uk |accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team erected two posts on the summit plateau to assist walkers attempting the descent in [[fog]]gy conditions. These posts were subsequently cut down by climbers, sparking controversy in mountaineering circles on the ethics of such additions.&lt;ref name="MCofS Newsletter"&gt;{{cite journal |author=The Mountaineering Council of Scotland |year=1997 |title=Ben Nevis—The Future |journal=Newsletter |volume=33 |url=http://www.mountaineering-scotland.org.uk/nl/33b.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cairns debate"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mountaineering-scotland.org.uk/bendebate/index.html|title= Summit Safety and Ben Nevis Cairns: The MCofS seeks a resolution |accessdate= 26 October 2006 |author= The Mountaineering Council of Scotland |format=also see sub-pages| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060927152330/http://www.mountaineering-scotland.org.uk/bendebate/index.html| archivedate= 27 September 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argued that cairns and posts are an unnecessary man-made intrusion into the natural landscape, which create a false sense of security and could lessen mountaineers' sense of responsibility for their own safety.&lt;ref name="Cairns debate"/&gt; Supporters of navigational aids pointed to the high number of accidents that occurred on the mountain (between 1990 and 1995 alone there were 13 fatalities, although eight of these were due to falls while rock climbing rather than navigational error),&lt;ref name="MCofS Newsletter"/&gt; the long tradition of placing such aids on the summit, and the potentially life-saving role they could play. A series of solidly-constructed cairns currently (September 2009) marks the upper reaches of the Pony Track.

== Climbing on Ben Nevis ==
[[File:Ben N Face annotated.jpg|thumb|left|Major features of the north face summit region.]]
The north face of Ben Nevis is riven with buttresses, ridges, towers and pinnacles, and contains many classic scrambles and rock climbs. It is of major importance for British winter climbing, with many of its routes holding snow often until late April. It was one of the first places in Scotland to receive the attention of serious mountaineers, with an ascent of [[Tower Ridge]] in 1892 the earliest documented climbing expedition on the Ben.&lt;ref name="Adby"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Terry Adby  |author2=Stuart Johnston |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2003|title=The Hillwalker's Guide to Mountaineering|publisher=Cicerone|location=Milnthorpe|isbn=1-85284-393-4|pages=240–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hodgkiss, ''The Central Highlands'', p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; (It was not climbed from bottom to top for another two years). The Scottish Mountaineering Club's Charles Inglis Clark hut was built below the north face in Coire Leis in 1929. Because of its remote location, it is said to be the only genuine [[Mountain hut|alpine hut]] in Britain.&lt;ref name="CIC"/&gt; It remains popular with climbers, especially in winter.

Tower Ridge is the longest of the north face's four main [[ridges]], with around 600 metres of ascent. It is not technically demanding (its [[grade (climbing)#British|grade]] is Difficult), and most pitches can be tackled unroped by competent climbers, but it is committing and very exposed.&lt;ref name="Adby"/&gt; Castle Ridge (Moderate), the northernmost of the main ridges, is an easier scramble, while Observatory Ridge (Very Difficult),&lt;ref&gt;Hodgkiss, ''The Central Highlands'', p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; the closest ridge to the summit, is "technically the hardest of the Nevis ridges in summer and winter".&lt;ref name=crocket2009&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crocket|first1=Ken|last2=Richardson|first2=Simon|title=Ben Nevis: Britain's Highest Mountain (second edition)|year=2009|publisher=Scottish Mountaineering Trust|location=Glasgow|isbn=978-1-907233-10-4|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the Tower and Observatory Ridges are the Tower and Gardyloo Gullies; the latter takes its name from the cry of "''garde à l'eau''" (French for "watch out for the water") formerly used in Scottish cities as a warning when householders threw their slops (and worse) out of a [[tenement]] window into the street. The gully's top wall was the refuse pit for the now-disused summit observatory.&lt;ref name="Murray"/&gt; The North-east Buttress (Very Difficult) is the southernmost and bulkiest of the four ridges; it is as serious as Observatory Ridge but not as technically demanding, mainly because an "infamous"&lt;ref name=richardson2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Richardson|first=Simon|title=Ben Nevis: Rock and Ice Climbs|year=2002|publisher=Scottish Mountaineering Trust|location=Glasgow|isbn=0-907521-73-8|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; rock problem, the 'Man-trap', can be avoided on either side.

[[File:Ben Nevis.jpg|thumb|right|A temperature inversion around Càrn Dearg Buttress and Castle Corrie.]]
The north face contains dozens of graded rock climbs along its entire length, with particular concentrations on the Càrn Dearg Buttress (below the [[Munro]] top of Càrn Dearg NW) and around the North-east Buttress and Observatory Ridge. Classic rock routes include ''Rubicon Wall'' on Observatory Buttress (Severe)&amp;nbsp;– whose second ascent in 1937, when it was considered the hardest route on the mountain, is described by [[W. H. Murray]] in ''Mountaineering in Scotland''&lt;ref&gt;W. H. Murray [1947] (1962). ''Mountaineering in Scotland''. London: J. M. Dent.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– and, on Càrn Dearg, ''Centurion'' and ''The Bullroar'' (both HVS), ''Torro'' (E2), and ''Titan's Wall'' (E3), these four described in the [[Scottish Mountaineering Club|SMC]]'s guide as among "the best climbs of their class in Scotland".&lt;ref name=richardson2002 /&gt;

Many seminal lines were recorded before the [[First World War]] by pioneering [[Scottish Mountaineering Club|Scottish climbers]] like J N Collie, Willie Naismith, [[Harold Raeburn]], and William and [[Ladies' Scottish Climbing Club|Jane]] Inglis Clark. Other classic routes were put up by G. Graham Macphee, Dr [[J. H. B. Bell|James H. B. Bell]] and others between the Wars; these include Bell's 'Long Climb', at {{convert|1400|ft|m|abbr=on}} reputedly the longest sustained climb on the British mainland. In summer 1943 conscientious objector [[Brian Pinder Kellett|Brian Kellett]] made a phenomenal seventy-four repeat climbs and seventeen first ascents including fourteen solos,&lt;ref name=crocket2009 /&gt; returning in 1944 to add fifteen more new lines, eleven solo, including his eponymous HVS on Gardyloo buttress. Much more recently, an extreme and as-yet ungraded climb on Echo Wall was completed by [[Dave MacLeod]] in 2008 after two years of preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.alpinist.com/doc/web08x/newswire-echo-wall-macleod |title=MacLeod's Boldest: Echo Wall |publisher=Alpinist.com| accessdate = 22 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The north face is also one of Scotland's foremost venues for winter mountaineering and ice climbing, and holds snow until quite late in the year; in a good year, routes may remain in winter condition until mid-spring. Most of the possible rock routes are also suitable as winter climbs, including the four main ridges; Tower Ridge, for example, is grade IV on the [[Grade (climbing)#Grade systems for ice climbing|Scottish winter grading system]], having been upgraded in 2009 by the Scottish Mountaineering Club after requests by the local Mountain Rescue Team, there being numerous benightments and incidents every winter season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotclimb.org.uk/bennevis.shtml |title=Climbing on Ben Nevis |publisher=Scottish Climbing Archive | accessdate = 26 October 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060924044416/http://scotclimb.org.uk/bennevis.shtml| archivedate= 24 September 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the most popular ice climb on Ben Nevis&lt;ref name="Hodgkiss 130"&gt;Hodgkiss, ''The Central Highlands'', p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; is ''The Curtain'' (IV,5) on the left side of the Càrn Dearg Buttress. At the top end of the scale, ''Centurion'' in winter is a grade VIII,8 face climb.

In February 1960 James R. Marshall and Robin Clark Smith recorded six major new ice routes in only eight days including Orion Direct (V,5 400m); this winter version of Bell's Long Climb was "the climax of a magnificent week's climbing by Smith and Marshall, and the highpoint of the [[Glossary of climbing terms#step cutting|step-cutting]] era."&lt;ref name=richardson2002 /&gt;

[[File:Image29 jpg ben race 1979.jpg|thumb|right|1979 Ben Nevis Race]]
[[File:Image6 Ben Race 1979.jpg|thumb|right|1979 Ben Nevis Race]]
The history of [[hill running]] on Ben Nevis dates back to 1895. William Swan, a barber from Fort William, made the first recorded timed ascent up the mountain on or around 27 September of that year, when he ran from the old post office in Fort William to the summit and back in 2 hours 41 minutes.&lt;ref name="MacLennan"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hugh Dan MacLennan |date=November 1998 |title=The Ben Race: The supreme test of athletic fitness |journal=The Sports Historian |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=131–147 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportsHistorian/1998/sh182j.pdf |accessdate=2 June 2009 |doi=10.1080/17460269809445800}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The following years saw several improvements on Swan's record, but the first competitive race was held on 3 June 1898 under Scottish Amateur Athletic Association rules. Ten competitors ran the course, which started at the Lochiel Arms Hotel in [[Banavie]] and was thus longer than the route from Fort William; the winner was 21-year-old Hugh Kennedy, a gamekeeper at Tor Castle, who finished (coincidentally with Swan's original run) in 2&amp;nbsp;hours 41&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name="MacLennan"/&gt;
[[File:Ben Race.jpg|thumb|Runners line up for an early Ben Race. The starter is on left with a shotgun]]
Regular races were organised until 1903, when two events were held; these were the last for 24&amp;nbsp;years, perhaps due to the closure of the summit observatory the following year.&lt;ref name="MacLennan"/&gt; The first was from [[Achintee]], at the foot of the Pony Track, and finished at the summit; It was won in just over an hour by Ewen MacKenzie, the observatory roadman.&lt;ref name="MacLennan"/&gt; The second race ran from new Fort William post office, and MacKenzie lowered the record to 2&amp;nbsp;hours 10&amp;nbsp;minutes, a record he held for 34&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="MacLennan"/&gt;

==Snowsport on The Ben==
Ben Nevis is becoming popular with ski mountaineers and boarders. The Red Burn (Allt Coire na h-Urcaire) just to the North of the tourist path gives the easiest descent, but most if not all of the easier gullies on the North Face have been skied, as has the slope once adorned by the abseil poles into Coire Leis. No 4 gully is probably the most skied. Although Tower scoop makes it a no-fall zone, Tower Gully is becoming popular, especially in May and June when there is spring snow.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny Biggin, ''Scottish Offpiste Skiing and Snowboarding : Nevis Range and Ben Nevis'',(Spean Bridge: Skimountain,2013)64-84&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental issues and Nevis Landscape Partnership ==
Ben Nevis's popularity and high-profile have led to concerns in recent decades over the impact of humans on the fragile mountain environment. These concerns contributed to the creation of The [http://www.nevislandscape.co.uk/ Nevis Landscape Partnership], a five-year programme which aims to protect, enhance and future-proof Ben Nevis by delivering nineteen ambitious environmental projects between 2014 and 2019. The Nevis Landscape Partnership is supported by five partner organisations (John Muir Trust, Forestry Commission Scotland, The Highland Council, Scottish Natural Heritage &amp; The Nevis Partnership) and has been made possible by Heritage Lottery Funding.

Now in project year three (March 2016 – March 2017), there have been significant positive changes implemented by Nevis Landscape Partnership and their projects, most significantly the upgrades to the [http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/fortwilliam/bennevis.shtml Ben Nevis Mountain Track]. Work to upgrade the mountain track started in November 2015 after two contracts were awarded to McGowan Ltd. &amp; Cairngorm Wilderness Contracts. Both contractors immediately started bagging stone from high up Ben Nevis to be brought down to by helicopter to replace crumbling steps and stabilise eroding parts of the path. The project will eventually upgrade 3.5&amp;nbsp;km of the mountain track from the starting point at Achintee all the way up to John's Wall; this year the maintenance was focused on a difficult middle section which was most in need of attention. After six months of hard work and battling with the weather, the contractors have now upgraded 1&amp;nbsp;km of the mountain track which is roughly 30% of the overall maintenance this project will carry out. The next contracted works will resume towards the end of September, after the Ben Nevis Race, for stage two of the project.

Volunteer effort has already been a huge help and will continue to be a large contributing factor to the overall upgrade of the mountain track. Nevis Landscape Partnership are working closely with National Trust for Scotland to run [http://www.nts.org.uk/thistlecamps/ Thistle Camp Working Holidays] which will focus on much-needed maintenance on the first section of the Ben Nevis footpath and allow outdoor enthusiasts to actively be a part of maintaining and protecting the United Kingdom's highest mountain for this generation and many more to come.[[File:Allt a' Mhuilinn.JPG|thumb|left|Path to the CIC Hut alongside the Allt a' Mhuilinn]]

The Caucasus Mountains include the [[Greater Caucasus range|Greater Caucasus]] in the north and [[Lesser Caucasus]] in the south. The Greater Caucasus runs west-northwest to east-southeast, from the [[Western Caucasus|Caucasian Natural Reserve]] in the vicinity of [[Sochi]] on the northeastern shore of the Black Sea nearly to [[Baku]] on the Caspian Sea. The Lesser Caucasus runs parallel to the Greater about {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} south.&lt;ref name=Encyc-Snow-Ice-CaucusMtn&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stokes|first1=Chris R|editor1-last=Singh|editor1-first=Vijay P.|editor2-last=Haritashya|editor2-first=Umesh K.|title=Encyclopedia of Snow, Ice and Glaciers|date=2011|publisher=Spring Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-90-481-2641-5|page=127|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mKKtQR4T-1MC&amp;pg=PA127}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greater and Lesser Caucasus ranges are connected by the [[Likhi Range]], and to the west and east of the Likhi Range lie the [[Colchis]] Plain and the [[Kur-Araz Lowland]]. The [[Meskheti Range]] is a part of the Lesser Caucasus system. In the southeast the [[Aras River]] separates the Lesser Caucasus from the [[Talysh Mountains]] which straddle the border of southeastern Azerbaijan and [[Iran]]. The Lesser Caucasus and the [[Armenian Highland]] constitute the [[Transcaucasian Highland]], which at their western end converge with the highland plateau of [[Eastern Anatolia]] in the far north east of [[Turkey]]. The highest peak in the Caucasus range is [[Mount Elbrus]] in the Greater Caucasus, which rises to a height of {{convert|5642|m}} above sea level. Mountains near Sochi hosted part of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]].

==Geology==
Geologically, the Caucasus Mountains belong to a system that extends from southeastern [[Europe]] into [[Asia]]. The [[Greater Caucasus]] Mountains are mainly composed of [[Cretaceous]] and [[Jurassic]] rocks with the [[Paleozoic]] and [[Precambrian]] rocks in the higher regions. Some volcanic formations are found throughout the range. On the other hand, the [[Lesser Caucasus]] Mountains are formed predominantly of the [[Paleogene]] rocks with a much smaller portion of the Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks. The evolution of the Caucasus began from the [[Late Triassic]] to the [[Late Jurassic]] during the [[Cimmerian orogeny]] at the active margin of the [[Tethys Ocean]] while the uplift of the Greater Caucasus is dated to the [[Miocene]] during the [[Alpine orogeny]].

The Caucasus Mountains formed largely as the result of a [[plate tectonics|tectonic]] plate collision between the [[Arabian plate]] moving northwards with respect to the [[Eurasian plate]]. As the [[Tethys Sea]] was closed and the Arabian Plate collided with the [[Iranian Plate]] and was pushed against it and with the clockwise movement of the Eurasian Plate towards the Iranian Plate and their final collision, the Iranian Plate was pressed against the Eurasian Plate. As this happened, the entire rocks that had been deposited in this basin from the Jurassic to the Miocene were folded to form the Greater Caucasus Mountains. This collision also caused the uplift and the [[Cenozoic]] volcanic activity in the Lesser Caucasus Mountains.

The entire region is regularly subjected to strong [[earthquake]]s from this activity.&lt;ref name = "Reilinger2012"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Global Positioning System measurements of present-day crustal movements in the Arabia-Africa-Eurasia plate collision zone|last = Reilinger|last2 = McClusky|last3 = Oral|last4 = King|last5 = Toksoz|last6 = Barka|last7 = Kinik|last8 = Lenk|last9 = Sanli|journal = Journal of Geophysical Research|issue = B5|pages = 9983–9999|date = Jan 1997|volume = 102|doi = 10.1029/96JB03736|bibcode=1997JGR...102.9983R}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Greater Caucasus Mountains have a mainly folded sedimentary structure, the Lesser Caucasus Mountains are largely of [[volcanic]] origin.&lt;ref name = "Philip1989"&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Caucasus|last1 = Philip|first1 = H.|last2 = Cisternas|first2 = A.|last3 = Gvishiani|first3 = A.|last4 = Gorshkov|first4 = A.|journal = Tectonophysics|issue = 1–2|date = 1 April 1989|pages = 1–21|volume = 161|doi = 10.1016/0040-1951(89)90297-7|bibcode = 1989Tectp.161....1P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Javakheti Volcanic Plateau]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and the surrounding volcanic ranges which extend well into central [[Armenia]] are some of the youngest features of the region. Only recently was the Caucasus a scene for intense volcanic activity: the Armenian highland was flooded by calc-alkaline [[basalt]]s and [[andesite]]s in the [[Pliocene]] and the highest summits of the Caucasus, the [[Elbrus]], and the [[Kazbek]], formed as [[Pleistocene]]-[[Pliocene]] volcanoes. The Kazbek is no longer active, but the Elbrus erupted in postglacial times and [[fumarole]] activity is registered near its summit. Contemporary seismic activity is a prominent feature of the region, reflecting active faulting and crustal shortening. Clusters of seismicity occur in [[Dagestan]] and in northern [[Armenia]]. Many devastating earthquakes have been documented in historical times, including the [[Spitak]] earthquake in December 1988 which destroyed the [[Gyumri]]-[[Vanadzor]] region of Armenia.

==Notable peaks==
Europe's highest mountain is [[Mount Elbrus]] {{convert|5642|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the Caucasus Mountains.&lt;ref name="earthobservatory.nasa.gov"&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=3603 Mt. Elbrus : Image of the Day]. Earthobservatory.nasa.gov. Retrieved on 16 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Elbrus is {{convert|832|m|abbr=on}} higher than [[Mont Blanc]], the highest peak in the [[Alps]] and western Europe at {{convert|4810|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The crest of the Caucasus Mountains usually is taken to [[Boundaries between continents#Modern definition|define]] the [[continental divide]] between Asia and Europe for the region between the Black and Caspian Seas.

The table below lists some of the highest peaks of the Caucasus. With the exception of [[Shkhara]], the heights are taken from Soviet 1:50,000 mapping. The list includes the ten [[ultra-prominent peak|ultras]] (mountains of more than 1,500 m prominence) and all mountains over 4,500 m height with 300 m prominence. [[Mount Ararat]] (5,137 m) in [[Turkey]] is just south of the lesser Caucasus.

==Climate==
[[File:Перевал Аишхо 1.jpg|thumb|250px|Aishkho Pass, [[Caucasus Nature Reserve]]]]
The climate of the Caucasus varies both vertically (according to elevation) and horizontally (by latitude and location). Temperature generally decreases as elevation rises. Average annual temperature in [[Sukhumi]], [[Abkhazia]] at sea level is {{convert|15|C|F}} while on the slopes of Mt.[[Kazbek]] at an elevation of {{convert|3700|m|ft}}, average annual temperature falls to{{convert|-6.1|C|F}}. The northern slopes of the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range are 3&amp;nbsp;°C (5.4&amp;nbsp;°F) colder than the southern slopes. The highlands of the Lesser Caucasus Mountains in [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] are marked by sharp temperature contrasts between the summer and winter months due to a more continental climate.

Precipitation increases from east to west in most areas. Elevation plays an important role in the Caucasus and mountains generally receive higher amounts of precipitation than low-lying areas. The northeastern regions ([[Dagestan]]) and the southern portions of the Lesser Caucasus Mountains are the driest. The absolute minimum annual precipitation is {{convert|250|mm|2|abbr=on}} in the northeastern [[Caspian Depression]]. Western parts of the Caucasus Mountains are marked by high amounts of precipitation. The southern slopes of the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range receive higher amounts of precipitation than the northern slopes. Annual precipitation in the Western Caucasus ranges from {{convert|1000|to(-)|4000|mm|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} while in the Eastern and Northern Caucasus ([[Chechnya]], [[Ingushetia]], [[Kabardino-Balkaria]], [[Ossetia]], [[Kakheti]], [[Kartli]], etc.) precipitation ranges from {{convert|600|to(-)|1800|mm|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}. The absolute maximum annual precipitation is {{convert|4100|mm|2|abbr=on}} around the Mt. Mtirala area which lies on the [[Meskheti Range]] in [[Ajaria]]. The precipitation of the Lesser Caucasus Mountain Range (Southern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]], western [[Azerbaijan]]), not including the [[Meskheti Range]], varies from 300-{{convert|800|mm|2|abbr=on}} annually.

The Caucasus Mountains are known for the high amount of snowfall, although many regions which are not located along the windward slopes do not receive nearly as much snow. This is especially true for the Lesser Caucasus Mountains which are somewhat isolated from the moist influences coming in from the [[Black Sea]] and receive considerably less precipitation (in the form of snow) than the Greater Caucasus Mountains. The average winter snow cover of the Lesser Caucasus Mountains ranges from {{convert|10|to(-)|30|cm|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}. The Greater Caucasus Mountains (especially the southwestern slopes) are marked by heavy snowfall. [[Avalanches]] are common from November to April.

Snow cover in several regions ([[Svaneti]] and northern [[Abkhazia]]) may reach {{convert|5|m|0}}. The Mt. [[Achishkho]] region, which is the snowiest place in the Caucasus, often records snow depths of {{convert|7|m|0|abbr=on}}.

==Landscape==
The Caucasus Mountains have a varied landscape which mainly changes according to elevation and distance from large bodies of water. The region contains [[biomes]] ranging from subtropical lowland marshes and forests to [[glacier]]s (Western and Central Caucasus), and highland [[semidesert]]s, [[steppe]]s, and [[alpine meadow]]s in the south (mainly in [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]).

The northern slopes of the Greater Caucasus Mountains are covered by [[oak]], [[hornbeam]], [[maple]], and [[ash tree|ash]] forests at lower elevations while [[birch]] and [[pine]] forests take over at higher elevations. Some of the lowest areas of the region are covered by [[steppes]] and [[grasslands]]. The slopes of the Northwestern Greater Caucasus ([[Kabardino-Balkaria]], [[Cherkessia]], etc.) also contain [[spruce]] and [[fir]] forests. The [[alpine climate|alpine]] zone replaces the forest at around {{convert|2000|m|ft}} above sea level. The permafrost/[[glacier]] line generally starts around {{convert|2800|-|3000|m|ft}}. The southeastern slopes of the Greater Caucasus Mountains are covered by [[beech]], [[oak]], [[maple]], [[hornbeam]], and ash forests. [[Beech]] forests tend to dominate in higher locations. The southwestern slopes of the Greater Caucasus are covered by [[Colchis|Colchian]] forests ([[oak]], [[buxus]], [[beech]], [[chestnut]], [[hornbeam]], [[elm]]) at lower elevations with [[coniferous]] and mixed forests ([[spruce]], [[fir]] and [[beech]]) taking over at higher elevations. The alpine zone on the southern slopes may extend up to {{convert|2800|m|ft}} above sea level while the [[glacier]]/snow line starts at {{convert|3000|-|3500|m|ft}}.

The northern and western slopes of the Lesser Caucasus Mountains are characterized both by [[Colchis|Colchian]] and other [[deciduous]] forests at lower elevations while mixed and [[coniferous]] forests (mainly [[spruce]] and [[fir]]) dominate at higher elevations. [[Beech]] forests are also common at higher elevations. The southern slopes of the Lesser Caucasus Mountains are largely covered by [[grasslands]] and [[steppes]] up to an elevation of {{convert|2500|m|ft}}. The highest areas of the region contain alpine grasslands as well. [[Volcanic]] and other rock formations are common throughout the region. The volcanic zone extends over a large area from southern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] into [[Armenia]] and southwestern [[Azerbaijan]]. Some of the prominent peaks of the region include Mt. [[Aragats]], [[Didi Abuli]], [[Samsari]], and others. The area is characterized by [[volcanic plateau]]s, [[lava flows]], [[volcanic lake]]s, [[volcanic cone]]s and other features. The Lesser Caucasus Mountains lack the type of glaciers and glacial features that are common on the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range.

==History==
{{further|History of the Caucasus}}
Crossing the Caucasus Mountain range was an important section of the northern arm of the [[Silk Route]]. There was one pass on the southeast end in [[Derbent]] (known as the Caspian Gates or [[Gates of Alexander]]), and multiple passes throughout the range: [[Jvari Pass]] at 2379&amp;nbsp;m and above the [[Darial Gorge]] on the [[Georgian Military Road]], [[Mamison Pass]] on the [[Ossetian Military Road]] at 2911&amp;nbsp;m, and [[Roki Tunnel]] at 2310&amp;nbsp;m. See [[Russian conquest of the Caucasus]].

'''Galilee''' ({{lang-he|הגליל}}, [[Romanization of Hebrew|transliteration]] ''HaGalil''); ({{lang-ar|الجليل}}, [[Romanization of Arabic|translit.]] ''al-Jalīl'')  is a region in northern [[Israel]]. The term Galilee traditionally refers to the mountainous part, divided into [[Upper Galilee]] ({{lang-he|גליל עליון}} ''Galil Elyon'') and [[Lower Galilee]] ({{lang-he|גליל תחתון}} ''Galil Tahton'').

In the modern common usage, Galilee refers to all of the area that is beyond [[Mount Carmel]] to the northeast, extending from [[Dan (biblical city)|Dan]] to the north, at the base of [[Mount Hermon]], along [[Mount Lebanon]] to the ridges of [[Mount Carmel]] and [[Mount Gilboa]] north of [[Jenin]] to the south, and from the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Rift Valley]] to the east across the plains of the [[Jezreel Valley]] and [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] to the shores of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[coastal plain]] in the west, including [[Beth Shean]]'s valley, [[Sea of Galilee|Sea of Galilee's valley]], and [[Hula Valley]], although it usually does not include [[Haifa]]'s immediate northern suburbs.

By this definition it overlaps with much of the administrative [[Northern District (Israel)|Northern District]] of the country (which also includes the [[Golan Heights]] and part of [[Menashe Heights]] but not [[Kiryat Tiv'on|Qiryat Tiv'on]]). Western Galilee ({{lang-he|גליל מערבי}} ''Galil Ma'aravi'') is a common term referring to the western part of the Upper Galilee and its shore, and usually also the northwestern part of the Lower Galilee, mostly overlapping with Acre sub district. [[Galilee Panhandle]] is a common term referring to the "panhandle" in the east that extends to the north, where Lebanon is to the west, and includes [[Hula Valley]] and [[Ramot Naftali]] mountains of the Upper Galilee. Historically, the part of [[Southern Lebanon]] south of the east-west section of the [[Litani River]] also belonged to the region of Galilee, but the present article mainly deals with the Israeli part of the region.

==Etymology==
The region's Israelite name is from the [[Hebrew]] root ''galil'', an ultimately unique word for "district", and usually "cylinder". The Hebrew form used in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 8:23 (or 9:1 in different Biblical versions) is in the construct state, "''g'lil hagoyim''", meaning "Galilee of the Nations", i.e. the part of Galilee inhabited by [[Gentile]]s at the time that the book was written.

The region in turn gave rise to the English name for the "Sea of Galilee" referred to as such in many languages including ancient Arabic. In the Hebrew language, the lake is referred to as [[Sea of Galilee|Kinneret]] ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 34:11, etc.), from Hebrew ''kinnor'', "[[harp]]", describing its [[shape]], [[Lake of Gennesaret]] ([[Book of Luke|Luke]] 5:1, etc.), from [[Ginosar]] (Hebrew) ''ge'', "[[valley]]", and either ''netser'', "[[branch]]", or ''natsor'', "to guard", "to watch" (the name which may have been a reference to [[Nazareth]] town, alternatively renamed the [[Sea of Tiberias]] ([[Book of John|John]] 6:1, etc.), from the town of [[Tiberias]] at its southwestern end, named after the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] [[Tiberius]] following the first-century CE Roman Emperor's Greek derived name. These are the three names used in originally internal Jewish-authored literature rather than the "Sea of Galilee".&lt;ref name= "Placenames of the World"&gt;Room, Adrian, 2nd Ed. (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C&amp;pg=PA140&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;dq=galilee+conquered+gauls&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=idxrJYKTTL&amp;sig=PlXKpRFZRYK2RRT2W3vsMq5Baxw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=85FiTZWcBIX0swODupTFCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA# p. 138.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jews did use "the Galilee" to refer to the whole region ([[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] הגלילי), including its lake.

==Geography==
Most of Galilee consists of rocky terrain, at heights of between 500 and 700&amp;nbsp;m. Several high mountains are in the region, including [[Mount Tabor]] and [[Mount Meron]], which have relatively low temperatures and high rainfall. As a result of this climate, [[flora]] and [[fauna]] thrive in the region, while many birds annually migrate from colder climates to Africa and back through the [[Hula Valley|Hula]]–Jordan corridor. The streams and waterfalls, the latter mainly in Upper Galilee, along with vast fields of greenery and colourful wildflowers, as well as numerous towns of [[biblical]] importance, make the region a popular [[Tourism in Israel|tourist destination]].

Due to its high rainfall {{convert|900|mm|in}}–{{convert|1200|mm|in}}, mild temperatures and high mountains (Mount Meron's elevation is 1,000–1,208&amp;nbsp;m), the upper Galilee region contains some distinctive flora and fauna: prickly juniper (''[[Juniperus oxycedrus]]''), Lebanese cedar (''[[Cedrus libani]]''), which grows in a small grove on Mount Meron, [[cyclamen]]s, [[Peony|paeonias]], and ''[[Rhododendron ponticum]]'' which sometimes appears on Meron.

==History==

===Ancient times===
[[File:Ancient Galilee.jpg|thumb|170px|Map of Galilee, ''circa'' 50 CE]]

According to the [[Bible]], Galilee was named by the Israelites and was the tribal region of Naphthali and Dan, at times overlapping the [[Tribe of Asher]]'s land.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/tribemap.html|title=Map of the Twelve Tribes of Israel &amp;#124; Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dan was dispersed among the whole people rather than isolated to the lands of Dan, as the Tribe of Dan was the hereditary local law enforcement and judiciary for the whole nation.&lt;ref&gt;Gen. 49:16 earliest reference among others&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=August 2013}} Normally,{{when|date=August 2014}} Galilee is just referred to as Naphthali.

Chapter 9 of [[1 Kings]] states that [[Solomon]] rewarded his [[Phoenicia]]n ally, [[King Hiram I]] of [[Sidon]], with twenty cities in the land of Galilee, which would then have been either settled by foreigners during and after the reign of Hiram, or by those who had been forcibly deported there by later conquerors such as the [[Assyria]]ns. Hiram, to reciprocate previous gifts given to [[David]], accepted the upland plain among the mountains of Naphtali and renamed it "the land of [[Cabul]]" for a time.&lt;ref name="Phoenicia"&gt;''History of Phoenicia'', by George Rawlinson 1889, "Phoenicia under the hegemony of Tyre (B.C. 1252–877)"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical antiquity===
[[File:Herod Antipas.jpg|thumb|right|As a Roman [[client state|client ruler]], [[Herod Antipas]], the [[Herodian Tetrarchy|tetrarch of Galilee]] from 4 BCE–39 CE, was permitted to mint his own coinage (''shown above'').&lt;ref name="Sanders1993"/&gt;]]

Galilee in the first century was dotted with small towns and villages.&lt;ref name="Casey2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Casey|first=Maurice|authorlink=Maurice Casey|date=2010|title=Jesus of Nazareth: An Independent Historian's Account of His Life and Teaching|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lXK0auknD0YC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;dq=Mary+Magdalene+supported+Jesus%27s+ministry&amp;hl=en#v=snippet&amp;q=The%20area%20surrounding%20Nazareth%20was%20fertile&amp;f=false|location=New York City, New York and London, England|publisher=T &amp; T Clark|isbn=978-0-567-64517-3|pages=164–169|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] claims that there were 204 small towns in Galilee,&lt;ref name="Casey2010"/&gt; but modern scholars believe this estimate to be an exaggeration.&lt;ref name="Casey2010"/&gt; Many of these towns were centered around the Sea of Galilee, which contained many edible fish and which was surrounded by fertile land.&lt;ref name="Casey2010"/&gt; Salted, dried, and pickled fish were an important [[export good]].&lt;ref name="Casey2010"/&gt; In 4 BCE, a rebel named Judah plundered Galilee's largest city, [[Sepphoris]]. In response, the Syrian governor [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]] sacked Sepphoris and sold the population into slavery.&lt;ref name="Casey2010"/&gt;

After the death of [[Herod the Great]] that same year, the Roman emperor [[Augustus]] appointed his son [[Herod Antipas]] as [[Herodian Tetrarchy|tetrarch of Galilee]], which remained a Roman [[client state]].&lt;ref name="Sanders1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sanders|first=E.

[[File:Petri Fischzug Raffael.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Jesus and the [[miraculous catch of fish]], in the Sea of Galilee. Many people in Roman-era Galilee were fishermen.&lt;ref name="Casey2010"/&gt;]]

In general, Antipas was a capable ruler;&lt;ref name="Sanders1993"/&gt; Josephus does not record any instance of him using force to put down an uprising and he had a long, prosperous reign.&lt;ref name="Sanders1993"/&gt; However, many Jews probably resented him as not sufficiently devout.&lt;ref name="Sanders1993"/&gt; Antipas rebuilt the city of Sepphoris&lt;ref name="Casey2010"/&gt; and, in either 18 CE or 19 CE, he founded the new city of [[Tiberias]].&lt;ref name="Sanders1993"/&gt; These two cities became Galilee's largest cultural centers.&lt;ref name="Sanders1993"/&gt; They were the main centers of Greco-Roman influence, but were still predominantly Jewish.&lt;ref name="Casey2010"/&gt; A massive gap existed between the rich and poor,&lt;ref name="Casey2010"/&gt; but lack of uprisings suggest that taxes were not exorbitantly high and that most Galileans did not feel their livelihoods were being threatened.&lt;ref name="Sanders1993"/&gt;

The archaeological discoveries of synagogues from the Hellenistic and Roman period in the Galilee show strong Phoenician influences, and a high level of tolerance for other cultures relative to other Jewish religious centers.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071121100831.htm|title=releases/2007/11/071121100831|publisher=sciencedaily.com|accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late in his reign, Antipas married his half-niece [[Herodias]], who was already married to one of her other uncles.&lt;ref name="Sanders1993"/&gt; His wife, whom he divorced, fled to her father [[Aretas IV Philopatris|Aretas]], an Arab king, who invaded Galilee and defeated Antipas's troops before withdrawing.&lt;ref name="Sanders1993"/&gt; Both Josephus and the [[Gospel of Mark]] {{bibleverse-nb|Mark|6:17–29|9}} record that the itinerate preacher [[John the Baptist]] criticized Antipas over his marriage&lt;ref name="Sanders1993"/&gt; and Antipas consequently had him imprisoned and then [[Beheading of John the Baptist|beheaded]].&lt;ref name="Sanders1993"/&gt;

In around 39 CE, at the urging of [[Herodias]], Antipas went to Rome to request that he be elevated from the status of tetrarch to the status of king.&lt;ref name="Sanders1993"/&gt; The Romans found him guilty of storing arms, so he was removed from power and exiled, ending his forty-three-year reign.&lt;ref name="Sanders1993"/&gt; During the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Great Revolt]] (66–73 CE), a Jewish mob destroyed Herod Antipas's palace.&lt;ref name="Sanders1993"/&gt; According to medieval Hebrew legend, [[Simeon bar Yochai]], one of the most famed of all the Tannaim, wrote the [[Zohar]] while living in Galilee.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Jewish History and You|author=Scharfstein, S.|date=2004|publisher=Ktav Pub Incorporated|isbn=9780881258066|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uFuBCOzObf0C|page=24|accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Galilee retained a Jewish majority until at least the seventh century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leibner|first=Uzi|title=Settlement and Demography in Late Roman and Byzantine Eastern Galilee|url=https://www.academia.edu/7438063/Settlement_and_Demography_in_Late_Roman_and_Byzantine_Eastern_Galilee|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
After the [[Arab]] caliphate took control of the region in 638, it became part of [[Jund al-Urdunn]] (District of Jordan). Its major towns were Tiberias (which was capital of the district—[[Qadas]]), [[Baysan]], [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Saffuriya]], and [[Kabul, Israel|Kabul]].&lt;ref name="Le Strange"&gt;Le Strange, Guy. (1890) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ENANAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA493&amp;dq=Lajjun+Guy+le+Strange&amp;lr=&amp;ei=-0MmScyML4TkygTn-J2KAg#PPA26,M1 Palestine Under the Moslems]'' pp. 30–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Fatimid]]s conquered the region in the 10th century; a breakaway sect, venerating the Fatimid caliph [[Hakim (title)|al-Hakim]], formed the [[Druze]] religion, centered in Mount Lebanon and partially Galilee. During the [[Crusade]]s, Galilee was organized into the [[Principality of Galilee]], one of the most important Crusader seigneuries.

===Ottoman era===
[[File:Safed view 02.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Safed]]
During Early Ottoman era, the Galilee was governed as the [[Safad Sanjak]], initially part of the larger administrative unit of [[Damascus Eyalet]] (1549–1660) and later as part of [[Sidon Eyalet]] (1660–1864). During the 18th century, the administrative division of Galilee was renamed to [[Acre Sanjak]], and the Eyalet itself became centered in Acre, factually becoming the Acre Eyalet between 1775 and 1841.

The Jewish population of Galilee increased significantly following [[Alhambra Decree|their expulsion from Spain]] and welcome from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The community for a time made [[Safed]] an international center of cloth weaving and manufacturing, as well as a key site for Jewish learning.&lt;ref name="jafi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jafi.org.il/education/noar/sites/tsfat.htm |title=The Jewish Agency for Israel |publisher=jafi.org.il |accessdate=2015-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222181345/http://www.jafi.org.il/education/noar/sites/tsfat.htm |archivedate=2009-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it remains one of Judaism's [[Four Holy Cities|four holy cities]] and a center for [[kabbalah]].

In the mid-17th century Galilee and Mount Lebanon became the scene of the [[Druze power struggle (1658–67)|Druze power struggle]], which came in parallel with much destruction in the region and decline of major cities.

In the mid-18th century, Galilee was caught up in a struggle between the [[Arab]] leader [[Zahir al-Umar]] and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] authorities who were centred in [[Damascus]]. Zahir ruled Galilee for 25 years until Ottoman loyalist [[Jezzar Pasha]] conquered the region in 1775.

In 1831, the Galilee, a part of [[Ottoman Syria]], switched hands from Ottomans to [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt]] until 1840. During this period, aggressive social and politic policies were introduced, which led to a violent [[Syrian Peasant Revolt (1834–35)|1834 Arab revolt]]. In the process of this revolt the Jewish community of [[Safed]] was greatly reduced, in the event of [[Safed Plunder]] by the rebels. The Arab rebels were subsequently defeated by the Egyptian troops, though in 1838, the Druze of Galilee led another [[1838 Druze rebellion|uprising]]. In 1834 and [[Galilee earthquake of 1837|1837]], major earthquakes leveled most of the towns, resulting in great loss of life.

Following the 1864 Tanszimat reforms in the Ottoman Empire, the Galilee remained within [[Acre Sanjak]], but was transferred from [[Sidon Eyalet]] to the newly formed [[Syria Vilayet]] and shortly, from 1888, became administered from [[Beirut Vilayet]].

In 1866, Galilee's first hospital, [[the Nazareth Hospital]], was founded under the leadership of American-Armenian missionary Dr. [[Kaloost Vartan]], assisted by German missionary [[John Zeller]].

[[File:Beirut Vilayet, Ottoman Empire (1900).svg|thumb|The territory of the Ottoman [[Beirut Vilayet]], encompassing the Galilee]]

In the early 20th century, Galilee remained part of [[Acre Sanjak]] of Ottoman Syria. It was administered as the southernmost territory of the [[Beirut Vilayet]].

===British administration and Israeli rule===
Following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in [[World War I]], and the [[Armistice of Mudros]], it came under British rule, as part of the [[Occupied Enemy Territory Administration]]. Shortly after, in 1920, the region was included in the British Mandate territory, officially a part of Mandatory Palestine from 1923.

After the [[1948 Arab–Israeli war]], nearly the whole of Galilee came under Israel's control. A large portion of the population fled or was forced to leave, leaving dozens of entire villages empty; however, a large [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli Arab]] community remained based in and near the cities of Nazareth, [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Tamra]], [[Sakhnin]], and [[Shefa-'Amr]], due to some extent to a successful rapprochement with the Druze. The [[kibbutz]]im around the [[Sea of Galilee]] were sometimes shelled by the [[Syrian army]]'s artillery until Israel seized the [[Golan Heights]] in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]].

During the 1970s and the early 1980s, the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) [[Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon|launched several attacks]] on towns and villages of the Upper and Western Galilee from [[Lebanon]]. This came in parallel to the general distabilization of [[Southern Lebanon]], which became a scene of fierce sectarian fighting which deteriorated into the [[Lebanese Civil War]]. On the course of the war, Israel initiated [[Operation Litani]] (1979) and [[Operation Peace For Galilee]] (1982) with the stated objectives of destroying the PLO infrastructure in Lebanon, protecting the citizens of the Galilee and supporting allied Christian Lebanese militias. Israel took over much of southern Lebanon in support of Christian Lebanese militias until 1985, when it withdrew to a [[Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon|narrow security buffer zone]].

From 1985 to 2000, [[Hezbollah]], and earlier [[Amal Movement|Amal]], continued to fight the [[South Lebanon Army]] supported by the [[Israel Defense Forces]], sometimes shelling Upper Galilee communities with [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]] rockets. In May 2000, [[Prime Minister of Israel|Israeli prime minister]] [[Ehud Barak]] unilaterally withdrew IDF troops from southern Lebanon, maintaining a security force on the [[Blue Line (Lebanon)|Israeli side of the international border]] recognized by the [[United Nations]]. The move brought a collapse to the [[South Lebanon Army]] and takeover of Southern Lebanon by Hezbollah. However, despite Israeli withdrawal, clashes between Hezbollah and Israel continued along the border, and UN observers condemned both for their attacks.

The [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]] was characterized by round-the-clock Katyusha rocket attacks (with a greatly extended range) by Hezbollah on the whole of Galilee, with long-range, ground-launched missiles hitting as far south as the [[Sharon Plain]], [[Jezreel Valley]], and [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] below the Sea of Galilee.

The north-central portion of the Galilee is also known as Central Galilee, stretching from the border with [[Lebanon]] to the northern edge of the Jezreel Valley, including the cities of Nazareth and Sakhnin, has an Arab majority of 75% with most of the Jewish population living in hilltop cities like [[Upper Nazareth]]. The northern half of the central Lower Galilee, surrounding [[Karmiel]] and [[Sakhnin]] is known as the "Heart of the Galilee". The eastern Galilee is nearly 100% Jewish. This part includes the [[Finger of the Galilee]], the Jordan River Valley, and the shores the Sea of Galilee, and contains two of Judaism's [[Four Holy Cities]]. The southern part of the Galilee, including Jezreel Valley, and the [[Mount Gilboa|Gilboa]] region are also nearly 100% Jewish, with a few small Arab villages near the [[West Bank]] border. About 80% of the population of the Western Galilee is Jewish, all the way up to the Lebanese border. Jews also form a small majority in the mountainous [[Upper Galilee]] with a significant minority Arab population (mainly Druze and Christians).

The [[Jewish Agency]] has attempted to [[Judaization of the Galilee|increase the Jewish population]] in this area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/20778/edition_id/426/format/html/displaystory.html | title=30 settlements planned for Negev and Galilee | accessdate=2008-01-19 | date=2003-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the non-Jewish population also has a high growth rate, {{As of|2006}}, there were 1.2&amp;nbsp;million residents in Galilee, of which 47% were Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3481768,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121209081201/http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3481768,00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 9, 2012 |accessdate=2008-02-01 |date=December 12, 2007 |title=Jewish population in Galilee declining |author=Ofer Petersburg |publisher=[[Ynet]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
{{Further|Tourism in Israel}}
Galilee is a popular destination for domestic and foreign tourists who enjoy its scenic, recreational, and gastronomic offerings. The Galilee attracts many [[Christian pilgrimage|Christian pilgrims]], as many of the [[miracles of Jesus]] occurred, according to the [[New Testament]], on the shores of the Sea of Galilee—including [[Jesus walks on water|his walking on water]], [[calming the storm]], and [[feeding the multitude|feeding five thousand people]] in [[Tabgha]]. In addition, numerous sites of [[biblical]] importance are located in the Galilee, such as [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], Jezreel Valley, Mount Tabor, [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], [[Horns of Hattin]], and more.

A popular hiking trail known as the ''yam leyam'', or sea-to-sea, starts hikers at the Mediterranean. They then hike through the Galilee mountains, Tabor, Neria, and Meron, until their final destination, the Kinneret (Sea of Galilee).

In April 2011, Israel unveiled the "[[Jesus Trail]]", a 40-mile (60-km) [[hiking trail]] in the Galilee for Christian pilgrims. The trail includes a network of footpaths, roads, and bicycle paths linking sites central to the lives of Jesus and his disciples, including [[Tabgha]], the traditional site of Jesus' miracle of the loaves and fishes, and the [[Mount of Beatitudes]], where he delivered his Sermon on the Mount. It ends at [[Capernaum]] on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, where Jesus espoused his teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/israel-unveils-hiking-trail-galilee-christian-pilgrims-20110415-093756-814.html |accessdate=2011-05-16 |date=April 15, 2011 |title=Israel unveils hiking trail in Galilee for Christian pilgrims |author=Daniel Estrin, Canadian Press |publisher=[[Yahoo!

Many kibbutzim and [[moshav]] families operate ''[[Bed and breakfast|Zimmern]]'' (German: "rooms", the local term for a [[Bed and breakfast]]s). Numerous festivals are held throughout the year, especially in the autumn and spring holiday seasons. These include the Acre (Acco) Festival of Alternative Theater,&lt;ref name="accofestival"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accofestival.co.il/home_eng.html |title=Acco Festival |publisher=accofestival.co.il |accessdate=2015-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702144740/http://www.accofestival.co.il/home_eng.html |archivedate=2015-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the olive harvest festival, music festivals featuring Anglo-American folk, [[klezmer]], Renaissance, and [[chamber music]], and [[Karmiel Dance Festival]].

==Cuisine==
The cuisine of the Galilee is very diverse. The meals are lighter than in the central and southern regions. Dairy products are heavily consumed (especially the Safed cheese that originated in the mountains of the [[Upper Galilee]]). Herbs like thyme, mint, parsley, basil, and rosemary are very common with everything including dips, meat, fish, stews and cheese.
In the eastern part of the Galilee, freshwater fish as much as meat (especially the tilapia that lives in the Sea of Galilee, Jordan river, and other streams in the region), fish filled with thyme and grilled with rosemary to flavor, or stuffed with oregano leaves, then topped with parsley and served with lemon to squash. This technique exists in other parts of the country including the coasts of the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. A specialty of the region is a baked Tilapia flavored with celery, mint and a lot of lemon juice. Baked fish with tahini is also common in Tiberias while the coastal Galileans prefer to replace the tahini with yogurt and add sumac on top.

The Galilee is famous for its olives, pomegranates, wine and especially its [[Labneh]] w'[[Za'atar]] which is served with pita bread, meat stews with wine, pomegranates and herbs such as akub, parsley, [[Malva|khalmit]], mint, fennel, etc. are common. Galilean [[kibbeh|kubba]] is usually flavored with cumin, cinnamon, cardamom, concentrated [[pomegranate juice]], onion, parsley and pine nuts and served as meze with tahini dip.
Kebabs are also made almost in the same way with sumac replacing cardamom and with carob sometimes replacing the pomegranate juice.
Because of its climate, beef has become more popular than lamb, although both are still eaten there.
Dates are popular in the tropical climate of the Eastern Galilee.

==Subregions==
The Galilee is often divided into these subregions:
* '''[[Lower Galilee]]''' covers the area north of the Valleys ([[Jezreel Valley|Jezreel]], [[Harod Valley|Harod]] and [[Beth Shean Valley]]) and south of the [[Beit HaKerem Valley]]. Its borders to the east on the [[Jordan Rift Valley]]. It contains the Arab village of [[Cana]].
* '''[[Upper Galilee]]''' extends from the [[Beit HaKerem Valley]] northwards into southern Lebanon. Its eastern border is the [[Hula Valley]] and the Sea of Galilee separating it from the Golan Heights. To the west it reaches to the Coastal Plain which separates it from the Mediterranean.
* The '''[[Jezreel Valley]]'''
* '''[[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]]'''
* Valley of '''[[Beit She'an]]'''
* '''[[Sea of Galilee]]''' and its valley
* The '''[[Hula Valley]]'''
* '''[[Mount Gilboa]]'''
* '''The [[Korazim Plateau]]'''
* Western Galilee in its minimal definition refers to the coastal plain just west of the Upper Galilee, also known as Plain of Asher, or Plain of the Galilee, which stretches from north of Acre to [[Rosh HaNikra (kibbutz)|Rosh HaNikra]] on the [[Blue Line (Lebanon)|Israel-Lebanon border]], and in the common broad definition adds the western part of Upper Galilee, and usually the northwestern part of Lower Galilee as well, corresponding more or less to Acre sub district or the [[Northern District (Israel)|Northern District]].
* The "[[Galilee Panhandle]]" ({{lang-he|אצבע הגליל}}, ''Etzba HaGalil'', lit. "Finger of Galilee") is a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] along the [[Hulah Valley]]; it contains the towns of [[Metulla]] and [[Qiryat Shemona]], and the [[Dan River (Israel)|Dan]] and [[Banias]] rivers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17803">A '''greenway''' is "a strip of undeveloped land near an urban area, set aside for recreational use or environmental protection".&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of English&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the term can in fact include "a scenic road"&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Environmental Studies'' by William Ashworth and Charles E. Little. New York: Facts on File, c1991.&lt;/ref&gt; and though many are in urban areas, there are some rural greenways, as for example the [[Monadnock-Sunapee Greenway]], a hiking trail in southern New Hampshire.

A greenway is a [[trail]] (and sometimes a [[wildlife corridor]]) found in both urban and rural settings that is frequently created out of a disused railway, [[towpath|canal towpath]], [[utility company|utility]] or similar [[right of way (transportation)|right of way]], or derelict industrial land. [[Rail trails]] are one of the most common forms of greenway, and they also resemble [[linear park]]s.

[[File:CrossVermontTrail-NewburyVT-2010-10-22.jpg|thumb|[http://www.traillink.com/trail/cross-vermont-trail.aspx The Cross Vermont Trail, a greenway in New England, US].]]

In [[Southern England]], the term also refers to [[ancient trackway]]s or [[green lane (road)|green lane]]s, especially those found on chalk [[downland]]s, like [[the Ridgeway]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ridgeway.creativewiltshire.co.uk/home.html The Ridgeway Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129064747/http://ridgeway.creativewiltshire.co.uk/home.html |date=2014-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
[[Image:USA-Charles River Esplanade6.JPG|left|thumb|[[Charles River Esplanade]], [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], US]]
The American author Charles Little in his 1990 book, ''Greenways for America,''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.susquehannagreenway.org/greenways-america Susquehanna Greenway]&lt;/ref&gt; defines a greenway as: 
*a linear open space established along either a natural corridor, such as a riverfront, stream valley or ridgeline, or overland along a railroad right-of-way converted to recreational use, a [[canal]], scenic road or other route. It is a natural or landscaped course for pedestrian or bicycle passage; an open-space connector linking parks, nature reserves, cultural features, or historic sites with each other and with populated areas; locally certain strip or [[linear park]]s designated as parkway or [[Green belt|greenbelt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://connectwithtn.com/what-is-a-greenway/ Tennessee Greenways and Trails: "What is a greenway"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''greenway'' comes from the ''green'' in [[green belt]] and the ''way'' in [[parkway]], implying a recreational or pedestrian use rather than a typical street corridor, as well as an emphasis on introducing or maintaining vegetation, in a location where such vegetation is otherwise lacking. Some greenways include community gardens as well as typical park-style landscaping of trees and shrubs. They also tend to have a mostly contiguous pathway. Greenways resemble [[linear park]]s, but the latter are only found in an urban and suburban environment.

Though wildlife corridors are also greenways, because they have conservation as their primary purpose, they are not necessarily managed as parks for recreational use, and may not include facilities such as public trails.

[[Tom Turner]] analyzed greenways in London looking for common patterns among successful examples. He was inspired by the [[pattern language]] technique of architect [[Christopher Alexander]]. Turner concluded there are seven types, or 'patterns', of greenway which he named: parkway, blueway, paveway, glazeway, skyway, ecoway and cycleway.&lt;ref&gt;Turner (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Greenways Association]] defines it as "communication routes reserved exclusively for non-motorised journeys, developed in an integrated manner which enhances both the environment and quality of life of the surrounding area. These routes should meet satisfactory standards of width, gradient and surface condition to ensure that they are both user-friendly and low-risk for users of all abilities." (Lille Declaration, European Greenways Association, 12 September 2000).

== Characteristics ==
[[Image:Railway Platforms on Parkland Walk.JPG|thumb|Railway Platforms on [[Parkland Walk]], [[North London]], England ]]

Charles Little describes five general types of greenways:&lt;ref&gt;Tennessee Greenways and Trails&lt;/ref&gt;
*  Urban riverside (or other water body) greenways, usually created as part of (or instead of) a redevelopment program along neglected, often run-down, city waterfronts.
*  Recreational greenways, featuring paths and trails of various kinds, often relatively long distance, based on natural corridors as well as canals, abandoned rail beds, and public rights-of-way.
*  Ecologically significant natural corridors, usually along rivers and streams and less often ridgelines, to provide for wildlife migration and species interchange, nature study and hiking.
*  Scenic and Historic routes, usually along a road, highway or waterway, the most representative of them making an effort to provide pedestrian access along the route or at least places to alight from the car.
*  Comprehensive greenway systems or networks, usually based on natural landforms such as valleys or ridges but sometimes simply an opportunistic assemblage of greenways and open spaces of various kinds to create an alternative municipal or regional green infrastructure.

Greenways are vegetated, linear, and multi-purpose. They incorporate a [[footpath]] or [[bikeway]] within a [[linear park]]. In [[urban design]], they are a component of planning for [[bicycle commuting]] and [[walkability]].

Greenways are found in rural areas as well as urban. Corridors redeveloped as greenways often travel through both city and country, connecting them together. Even in rural areas greenways serve the purpose of providing residents access to open land managed as parks, as contrasted with land that is vegetated but inappropriate for public use, such as agricultural land. Where the historic rural road network has been enlarged and redesigned to favor highspeed automobile travel, greenways provide an alternative for people who are elderly, young, less mobile or seeking a reflective pace.&lt;ref&gt;Natural England&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loh et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenways are found almost globally. However, most examples are known to be in Europe and North America.

==Foreshoreway&lt;!--'Foreshoreway' redirects here--&gt;==
[[File:Lake front bike2.JPG|thumb|[[Chicago Lakefront Trail]] ]]
In [[Australia]], a foreshoreway is a greenway that provides a public [[right-of-way]] along [[Foreshore|the edge of the sea]], open to both walkers and cyclists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/documents/bf/gc-foreshoreways_council_report.pdf Foreshoreways of Australia's Gold Coast]&lt;/ref&gt; Foreshoreways include [[oceanway]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/documents/bf/gc-foreshoreways_council_report.pdf Foreshoreways of Australia's Gold Coast]&lt;/ref&gt; and resemble [[promenade]]s and [[boardwalk]]s.

Foreshoreways are usually concerned with the idea of [[sustainable transport]] and the term is used to avoid the suggestion that the route favours either pedestrians (footpath) or cyclists (bikeway).{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} A foreshoreway is accessible to both pedestrians and cyclists and gives them the opportunity to move unimpeded along the seashore. Dead end paths that offer public access only to the ocean are not part of a foreshoreway.

A foreshoreway corridor often includes a number of [[traffic]] routes that provide access along an oceanfront,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/documents/bf/gc-foreshoreways_council_report.pdf Foreshoreways of Australia's Gold Coast]&lt;/ref&gt; including:
* walking along the [[beach]]
* edge of [[foreshore]] off-road greenway
* edge of road off-road greenway
* on road [[bikeway]]
* on road private vehicles routes
* on road [[public transport]] corridor

A major example is The [[Gold Coast Oceanway]] along beaches in [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], [[Queensland]], a shared use [[pedestrian]] and [[cyclist]] pathway on the Gold Coast, connecting the [[Point Danger, NSW/Queensland|Point Danger]] [[lighthouse]] on the [[New South Wales]] and Queensland border to the [[Gold Coast Seaway]]. The network includes {{convert|36|km|mi}} of poor, medium and high quality pathways. Others include: The [[Chicago Lakefront Trail]], the [[Dubai Marina]], the [[East River Greenway]], [[New Plymouth Coastal Walkway]], and the [[Manhattan Waterfront Greenway]].

Public rights of way frequently exist on the [[foreshore]] of beaches throughout the world. In legal discussions the foreshore is often referred to as the wet-sand area (see [[Right of way]] for a fuller discussion).

'''Grändalssjön''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]] for "Lake of Grändalen") is a small [[lake]] in [[Tyresö Municipality]] south-east of central [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].

Grändalssjön, one of the lakes within the [[Tyresån Lake System]], empties in its eastern end into a southbound bay of lake [[Albysjön, Tyresö|Albysjön]] located north of it.  Immediately north of Grändalssjön is the Raksta open-air area, and Övre kärret ("Upper Swamp"), a swampy lake, is located west of the lake.  Two small cottages located nearby, Grändalen and Skansen, are part of [[Gamla Tyresö]].

The lake is popular for bathing and fishing.  Motorboats are not allowed on the lake.&lt;ref name="Tyresö"&gt;Tyresö Municipality, ''Tyresåns sjösystem''&lt;/ref&gt;  It is virtually unaffected by [[eutrophication]] and human activities.  It consequently has moderate levels of nutrients.&lt;ref name="Tyresö" /&gt;

The stock of [[crayfish]]es is undocumented, but fishing using a maximum of ten tools is allowed with a fishing license.&lt;ref name="sthlm-fiskekort"&gt;Stockholm Municipality, ''Kräftfiskekort''&lt;/ref&gt;  Aquatic vegetation is dominated by [[Chara globularis|Fragile Stonewort]].&lt;ref name="Vattenväxt"&gt;Södertörnsekologerna, ''Vattenväxter''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISO 3166-2:KI''' is the entry for [[Kiribati]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Kiribati, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[islands of Kiribati|3 groups of islands (20 inhabited islands)]]. The groups of islands are geographical subdivisions, as the country has no official administrative subdivisions.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|KI}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Kiribati. The second part is a letter.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

[[File:Unicorn annunciation.jpg|thumb|150px|An ivory tower, as symbol of Mary, in a "Hunt of the Unicorn [[Annunciation]]" (ca. 1500) from a Netherlandish [[book of hours]]. For the complicated [[iconography]], see [[Hortus Conclusus]].]]

The term '''ivory tower''' originates in the Biblical ''[[Song of Solomon]] ''(7:4)&lt;ref name="BiblePassage"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bible|chapter=Song of Songs 7:4|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Song+of+Songs+7%3A4&amp;version=NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was later used as an [[epithet]] for [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cardinaljohnhenrynewman.com/mary-the-ivory-tower-cardinal-newman/|title=Mary, the Ivory Tower ~ Cardinal Newman - Blessed Cardinal John Henry Newman|date=2014-05-23|work=Blessed Cardinal John Henry Newman|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 19th century, it has been used to designate an environment of intellectual pursuit disconnected from the practical concerns of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/shapin/files/shapin_ivory_tower_bjhs.pdf|title=The Ivory Tower: the history of a figure of speech and its cultural uses|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practically speaking, it means being disconnected from the reality of the everyday life of average people because one has spent too much of their time in intellectual pursuits. A person coming from an ivory tower has difficulty judging the actions of people and life in general outside of their environment. In [[American English]] usage it is also used as shorthand for [[academia]] or the [[university]].

==Religious usage==
In the [[Christian]] tradition, the term ''ivory tower'' is used as a symbol for noble purity. It originates with the [[Song of Solomon]] (7:4) (''"Your neck is like an ivory tower"''; in the Hebrew [[Masoretic]] text, it is found in 7:5) and was included in the [[epithet]]s for [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]] in the sixteenth century [[Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary]] (''"tower of ivory"'', ''turris eburnea'' in Latin), though the title and image was in use long before that, since the 12th century Marian revival at least.&lt;ref name="Bull"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Miracles of Our Lady of Rocamadour: Analysis and Translation|last=Bull|first=Marcus Graham|year=1999|publisher=[[Boydell &amp; Brewer]]|location=Woodbridge|isbn=0-85115-765-3|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It occasionally appears in art, especially in depictions of Mary in the [[hortus conclusus]]. Although the term is rarely used in the religious sense in modern times, it is credited with inspiring the modern meaning.&lt;ref name="WWW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-ivo1.htm|title=On "Ivory Tower"|accessdate=2007-04-24|author=Quinion, Michael|publisher=''WorldWideWords.org''|date=2001-01-13|quote=The origin is the Bible, specifically Chapter 7, Verse 4 of the Song of Solomon, in which Solomon is extolling the beauty of his beloved... Not quite the thing today [...] but it struck a chord with Charles-Augustin Saint-Beuve.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
[[File:UK-2014-Oxford-All Souls College 03.jpg|thumb|150px|''Hawksmoor Towers'', [[All Souls College, Oxford]]]]
[[File:St John's College Chapel Court, Cambridge, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|150px|An Ivory Tower at [[St. John's College, Cambridge]]]]

The first modern usage of "ivory tower" in the familiar sense of an unworldly dreamer can be found in a poem of 1837, "Pensées d'Août, à M. Villemain", by [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]], a French [[Literary criticism|literary critic]] and author, who used the term ''"tour d'ivoire"'' for the poetical attitude of [[Alfred de Vigny]] as contrasted with the more socially engaged [[Victor Hugo]]: "Et Vigny, plus secret, Comme en sa tour d'ivoire, avant midi rentrait". [And Vigny, the more secretive, like he was in his ivory tower, returning before midday].&lt;ref name="WWW" /&gt;

[[Henry James]]' last novel, ''The Ivory Tower'', was begun in 1914 and left unfinished at his death two years later. Paralleling James' own dismaying experience of the United States after twenty years away, it chronicles the effect on a high-minded returning upper-class American of the vulgar emptiness of the [[Gilded Age]]. "You seem all here so hideously rich," says his hero. Thus, there are two meanings mixed together: mockery of an absent-minded savant and admiration of someone who is able to devote his or her entire efforts to a noble cause (hence ''"[[ivory]]"'', a noble but impractical building material).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The term has a rather negative flavor today, the implication being that specialists who are so deeply drawn into their fields of study often can't find a [[lingua franca]] with [[Layman|laymen]] outside their ''"ivory towers"''.

In Andrew Hodges' biography of the [[Cambridge]] Scientist [[Alan Turing]], he discusses Turing's 1936-38 stay at [[Princeton University]] and writes that "[t]he tower of the Graduate College was an exact replica of [[Magdalen College]], and it was popularly called the Ivory Tower, because of that benefactor of Princeton, the [[Procter &amp; Gamble|Procter]] who manufactured [[Ivory (soap)|Ivory soap]]."&lt;ref name="Hodge"&gt;{{cite book| title=[[Alan Turing: The Enigma]] |last=Hodges|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Hodges|year=1983|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|isbn=0-671-49207-1|pages= |oclc=10020685}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Cooper Procter]] (Princeton class of 1883) was a significant supporter of the construction of the Graduate College, and the main dining hall bears the Procter name. The skylines of [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]] universities, along with many Ivy League universities, are dotted with turrets and spires which are often described as 'Ivory Towers'.

In [[Randall Jarrell]]'s essay 'The End of the Line' (1942), Jarrell asserts that if modern poetry is to survive then poets must come down from the "Ivory Tower" of elitist composition. Jarrell's main thrust is that the rich poetry of the [[modernist]] period was over-dependent upon reference to other literary works. For Jarrell the Ivory Tower led modern poetry into obscurity.&lt;ref name="Jarrell"&gt;{{cite book|title='The End of the Line' In Cook, J. ‘Poetry in Theory: An Anthology 1900-2000’|last=Jarrell|first=Randall|year=2008|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]]|location=[[Oxford]]|isbn=978-0-631-22554-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ivory tower may also be an entity of "reason, rationality and rigid structures [that] colonizes the world of lived experience," as explained by Kirsten J. Broadfoot in an article about the possibilities of postcolonial organizational communication. This imagined academic community creates an essence of exclusivity and superiority. Broadfoot explains this as a group that "functions like an exclusive club whose membership is tightly controlled by what might be called a 'dominant frame.'" In an academic sense, this leads to an "overwhelming and disproportionate dominance" of the United States and the Western world. The ivory tower can be dangerous, some believe, in its inherent privatization of knowledge and intellect. Academics who are seeking "legitimacy for their narratives from the heart end up echoing the sanitized tone of the Master Narrative." This becomes a cyclical process as intellects collectively defend the "imaginary ivory tower."&lt;ref name="Broadfoot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcq.sagepub.com|title=Management Communication Quarterly|work=sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mu Ko Ang Thong''' is a marine [[List of national parks of Thailand|national park]] in the [[Gulf of Thailand]] in [[Surat Thani Province]].&lt;ref name="TAT"&gt;{{cite web|title=MU KO ANG THONG NATIONAL PARK|url=https://www.tourismthailand.org/Attraction/Mu-Ko-Ang-Thong-National-Park--5511|website=Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT)|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covers 42 islands in a total area of 102&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, of which about 50&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are land and the rest is water. The park was established on 12 November 1980.&lt;ref name=DNP&gt;{{cite web|title=Mu Ko Ang Thong National Park|url=http://www.dnp.go.th/parkreserve/asp/style1/default.asp?npid=192&amp;lg=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111031842/http://www.dnp.go.th/parkreserve/asp/style1/default.asp?npid=192&amp;lg=2|dead-url=yes|archive-date=11 November 2006|website=Department of National Parks (DNP)|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northern tip of [[Ko Phaluai]] is also part of the marine park. There is a ranger station, bungalows, a shop, and a restaurant at Ao Phi Beach on [[Ko Wua Talap]].

The name "Ang Thong" (Thai: อ่างทอง) means 'bowl of gold'. "Mu Ko" (หมู่เกาะ) simply means 'group of islands'.

Since 2002 the park has been registered as [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] site number 1184.&lt;ref name=DNP/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4189">The '''Naucrary''' ({{lang-grc|ναυκραρία}}) was a subdivision of the people of [[Attica]],&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Naucrary |volume=19 |page=276 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; among the most ancient in the [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] state.

==Etymology==
The word is derived either from ''naus'' (ναῦς "a ship") and describes the duty imposed upon each naucrary, of providing one ship and two (or, more probably, ten) horsemen; or from ''naio'' (ναίω "I dwell"), in which case it has to do with a householder census. The former is generally accepted in view of the fact that the naucraries were certainly the units on which the Athenian fleet was based.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==History==
The view once held (on the strength of a fragment of [[Aristotle]], quoted carelessly by [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]]) that the naucrary was invented by [[Solon]] may now be regarded as obsolete (see the ''Aristotelian Constitution'', viii. 3). Each of the four [[Ionians|Ionian]] tribes was divided into three ''trittyes'' ("thirds"), each of which was subdivided into four naucraries; there were thus 48 naucraries.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The earliest mention of the term is in [[Herodotus]] (v. 71), where it is stated that the [[Cylon of Athens|Cylonian conspiracy]] was put down by the "Prytaneis (chief men) of the Naucraries." Although it is generally recognized that in this passage we can trace an attempt to shift the responsibility for the murder of the suppliants from the archon [[Megacles]], it is highly improbable that the Prytaneis of the Naucraries did not play a part in the tragedy.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[Thucydides]] is probably right, as against Herodotus, in asserting that the nine [[archon]]s formed the Athenian executive at this period. It may be conjectured, however, that the military forces of Athens were organized on the basis of the naucraries, and that it was the duty of the presidents of these districts to raise the local levies. It is certainly remarkable that the Aristotelian Constitution of Athens does not connect the naucrary with the fleet or the army; from chapter viii. it would appear that its importance was chiefly in connection with finance.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The naucrary consisted of a number of villages, and was, therefore, a local unit very much in the power of the naucraros, who was selected by reason of wealth. The naucraros superintended the construction of, and afterwards captained, the ship, and also assessed and administered the taxes in his own area.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In the reforms of [[Cleisthenes]], the naucraries gave place to the [[deme]]s as the political unit. In accordance with the new decimal system, their number was increased to fifty. Whether they continued (and if so, how long) to supply one ship and two (or ten) horsemen each is not certainly known. Cheidemus in Photius asserts that they did, and his statement is to a certain extent corroborated by Herodotus (vi. 89) who records that, in the [[Aeginetan War]] before the Persian Invasion, the Athenian fleet numbered only fifty sail.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[File:Noaa3-2006-0602-1206 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Sea ice]] at the North Pole in 2006]]

The '''North Pole''', also known as the '''Geographic North Pole''' or '''Terrestrial North Pole''', is (subject to the caveats explained below) defined as the point in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] where the [[Earth's rotation|Earth's axis of rotation]] meets its surface.

The North Pole is the northernmost point on the Earth, lying diametrically opposite the [[South Pole]]. It defines geodetic [[latitude]] 90° North, as well as the direction of [[true north]]. At the North Pole all directions point south; all lines of [[longitude]] converge there, so its longitude can be defined as any degree value. Along tight latitude circles, counterclockwise is east and clockwise is west. The North Pole is at the center of the Northern Hemisphere.

While the South Pole lies on a continental [[Antarctica|land mass]], the North Pole is located in the middle of the [[Arctic Ocean]] amid waters that are almost permanently covered with constantly shifting [[sea ice]]. This makes it impractical to construct a permanent station at the North Pole ([[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station|unlike the South Pole]]). However, the [[Soviet Union]], and later [[Russia]], constructed a number of [[Drifting ice station|manned drifting stations]] on a generally annual basis since 1937, some of which have passed over or very close to the Pole. Since 2002, the Russians have also annually established a base, [[Barneo]], close to the Pole. This operates for a few weeks during early spring. Studies in the 2000s predicted that the North Pole may become seasonally ice-free because of [[Climate change in the Arctic|Arctic ice shrinkage]], with timescales varying from 2016&lt;ref&gt;Black, Richard (8 April 2001). [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13002706 New warning on Arctic sea ice melt]. BBC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ljunggren, David (5 March 2009). [https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/05/us-canada-arctic-idUSTRE52468B20090305 Arctic summer ice could vanish by 2013: expert]. Reuters&lt;/ref&gt; to the late 21st century or later.

The sea depth at the North Pole has been measured at {{convert|4261|m|abbr=on}} by the Russian [[MIR (submersible)|Mir submersible]] in [[Arktika 2007|2007]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKL0286134520070802 Russian sub plants flag at North Pole], Reuters, 2 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and at  4,087 m (13,410&amp;nbsp;ft)  by [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS ''Nautilus'']] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://militera.lib.ru/memo/usa/anderson_w/18.html | title="Наутилус" у Северного полюса |publisher=[[Voenizdat|Воениздат]] | year=1965 | accessdate=12 January 2012 | author=[[William Anderson (naval officer)|Андерсон, Уильям Роберт]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7rftTUAUXOIC&amp;pg=PA202| title=The International Regime of the Polar Regions | publisher=[[Hague Academy of International Law|Acadimie de Droit International de La Ha]] | year=1968 | accessdate=12 January 2012 | author=Mouton, M.W. | pages=202 (34)| isbn=9028614427 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nearest land is usually said to be [[Kaffeklubben Island]], off the northern coast of [[Greenland]] about {{convert|700|km|abbr=on}} away, though some perhaps semi-permanent gravel banks lie slightly closer. The nearest permanently inhabited place is [[Alert, Nunavut|Alert]] in the [[Qikiqtaaluk Region]], Nunavut, Canada, which is located {{convert|817|km|abbr=on}} from the Pole.

==Precise definition==
{{See also|Polar motion}}
The Earth's axis of rotation&amp;nbsp;– and hence the position of the North Pole&amp;nbsp;– was commonly believed to be fixed (relative to the surface of the Earth) until, in the 18th century, the mathematician [[Leonhard Euler]] predicted that the axis might "wobble" slightly. Around the beginning of the 20th century astronomers noticed a small apparent "variation of latitude," as determined for a fixed point on Earth from the observation of stars. Part of this variation could be attributed to a wandering of the Pole across the Earth's surface, by a range of a few metres. The wandering has several periodic components and an irregular component. The component with a period of about 435 days is identified with the eight-month wandering predicted by Euler and is now called the [[Chandler wobble]] after its discoverer. The exact point of intersection of the Earth's axis and the Earth's surface, at any given moment, is called the "instantaneous pole", but because of the "wobble" this cannot be used as a definition of a fixed North Pole (or South Pole) when metre-scale precision is required.

It is desirable to tie the system of Earth coordinates (latitude, longitude, and elevations or [[orography]]) to fixed landforms. Of course, given [[plate tectonics]] and [[isostasy]], there is no system in which all geographic features are fixed. Yet the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] and the [[International Astronomical Union]] have defined a framework called the [[International Terrestrial Reference System]].

===Pre-1900===
[[File:Mercator north pole 1595.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Gerardus Mercator]]'s map of the North Pole from 1595]]
[[File:C.G. Zorgdragers Bloeyende opkomst der aloude en hedendaagsche Groenlandsche visschery - no-nb digibok 2014010724007-V1.jpg|thumb|C.G. Zorgdragers map of the North Pole from 1720]]
As early as the 16th century, many prominent people correctly believed that the North Pole was in a sea, which in the 19th century was called the [[Polynya]] or [[Open Polar Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wright, John K. |journal=Geographical Review|volume=43|issue=3|date=July 1953|pages=338–365 |title=The Open Polar Sea}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was therefore hoped that passage could be found through ice floes at favorable times of the year. Several expeditions set out to find the way, generally with whaling ships, already commonly used in the cold northern latitudes.

One of the earliest expeditions to set out with the explicit intention of reaching the North Pole was that of British naval officer [[William Parry (explorer)|William Edward Parry]], who in 1827 reached latitude 82°45′ North. In 1871 the [[Polaris expedition]], a US attempt on the Pole led by [[Charles Francis Hall]], ended in disaster. Another British [[Royal Navy]] attempt on the pole, part of the [[British Arctic Expedition]], by Commander [[Albert Hastings Markham|Albert H. Markham]] reached a then-record 83°20'26" North in May 1876 before turning back. An 1879–1881 expedition commanded by [[United States Navy|US naval]] officer [[George W. DeLong]] ended tragically when their ship, the [[USS Jeannette (1878)|USS ''Jeanette'']], was crushed by ice. Over half the crew, including DeLong, were lost.

In April 1895 the Norwegian explorers [[Fridtjof Nansen]] and [[Hjalmar Johansen]] struck out for the Pole on skis after leaving Nansen's icebound ship ''[[Fram]]''. The pair reached latitude 86°14′ North before they abandoned the attempt and turned southwards, eventually reaching [[Franz Josef Land]].

In 1897 Swedish engineer [[Salomon August Andrée]] and two companions tried to reach the North Pole in the hydrogen balloon ''Örnen'' ("Eagle"), but came down {{convert|300|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Kvitøya]], the northeasternmost part of the [[Svalbard]] archipelago. They trekked to Kvitøya but died there three months later.  In 1930 the remains of [[S. A. Andrée's Arctic Balloon Expedition of 1897|this expedition]] were found by the Norwegian [[Bratvaag Expedition]].

The Italian explorer [[Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi|Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi]] and Captain [[Umberto Cagni]] of the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (Regia Marina) sailed the converted whaler ''[[Jason (ship)|Stella Polare]]'' ("Pole Star") from Norway in 1899. On 11 March 1900 Cagni led a party over the ice and reached latitude 86° 34’ on 25 April, setting a new record by beating Nansen's result of 1895 by {{convert|35|to|40|km|abbr=on}}. Cagni barely managed to return to the camp, remaining there until 23 June. On 16 August the ''Stella Polare'' left [[Rudolf Island]] heading south and the expedition returned to Norway.

The US explorer [[Frederick Cook]] claimed to have reached the North Pole on 21 April 1908 with two [[Inuit]] men, Ahwelah and Etukishook, but he was unable to produce convincing proof and his claim is not widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bryce ''Cook and Peary: the Polar Controversy Resolved'' Stackpole 1997; Henderson, B. (2005) ''True North'' W W Norton &amp; Company {{ISBN|0-393-32738-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conquest of the North Pole was for many years credited to US Navy engineer [[Robert Peary]], who claimed to have reached the Pole on 6 April 1909, accompanied by [[Matthew Henson]] and four Inuit men, Ootah, Seeglo, Egingwah, and Ooqueah. However, Peary's claim remains highly disputed and controversial. Those who accompanied Peary on the final stage of the journey were not trained in [Western] navigation, and thus could not independently confirm his navigational work, which some claim to have been particularly sloppy as he approached the Pole.

The distances and speeds that Peary claimed to have achieved once the last support party turned back seem incredible to many people, almost three times that which he had accomplished up to that point. Peary's account of a journey to the Pole and back while traveling along the direct line&amp;nbsp;– the only strategy that is consistent with the time constraints that he was facing&amp;nbsp;– is contradicted by Henson's account of tortuous detours to avoid [[Pressure ridge (ice)|pressure ridge]]s and [[Lead (sea ice)|open lead]]s.

The  British explorer [[Wally Herbert]], initially a supporter of Peary, researched Peary's records in 1989 and found that there were significant discrepancies in the explorer's navigational records. He concluded that Peary had not reached the Pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/sir-wally-herbert-453324.html |title=Sir Wally Herbert |work=The Independent |date=16 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224045237/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/sir-wally-herbert-453324.html |archivedate=24 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for Peary came again in 2005, however, when British explorer [[Tom Avery]] and four companions recreated the outward portion of Peary's journey with replica wooden sleds and [[Canadian Eskimo Dog]] teams, reaching the North Pole in 36 days, 22 hours&amp;nbsp;– nearly five hours faster than Peary. However, Avery's fastest 5-day march was 90 nautical miles, significantly short of the 135 claimed by Peary. Avery writes on his web site that "The admiration and respect which I hold for Robert Peary, Matthew Henson and the four Inuit men who ventured North in 1909, has grown enormously since we set out from [[Cape Columbia]]. Having now seen for myself how he travelled across the pack ice, I am more convinced than ever that Peary did indeed discover the North Pole."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomavery.net/gallery_np2005.php Tom Avery website].

In 1982 [[Ranulph Fiennes]] and [[Charles R. Burton]] became the first people to cross the Arctic Ocean in a single season. They departed from Cape Crozier, [[Ellesmere Island]], on 17 February 1982 and arrived at the geographic North Pole on 10 April 1982. They travelled on foot and snowmobile. From the Pole, they travelled towards Svalbard but, due to the unstable nature of the ice, ended their crossing at the ice edge after drifting south on an ice floe for 99 days. They were eventually able to walk to their expedition ship ''MV Benjamin Bowring'' and boarded it on 4 August 1982 at position 80:31N 00:59W. As a result of this journey, which formed a section of the three-year [[Transglobe Expedition]] 1979–1982, Fiennes and Burton became the first people to complete a circumnavigation of the world via both North and South Poles, by surface travel alone. This achievement remains unchallenged to this day.

In 1998, 1999, and 2000 [[Lada Niva]] Marshs (special very large wheeled versions made by BRONTO, Lada/Vaz's experimental product division) were driven to the North Pole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ladaniva.co.uk/baxter/resources/LadaOddities.htm "Lada Oddities"].

''amphibiousvehicle.net''.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1998 expedition was dropped by parachute and completed the track to the North Pole. The 2000 expedition departed from a Russian research base around 114&amp;nbsp;km from the Pole and claimed an average speed of 20–15&amp;nbsp;km/h in an average temperature of −30&amp;nbsp;°C.

Commercial airliner flights on the [[Polar route]]s may pass within viewing distance of the North Pole.  For example, the flight from [[Chicago]] to [[Beijing]] may come close as latitude 89° N, though because of prevailing winds return journeys go over the [[Bering Strait]].  In recent years journeys to the North Pole by air (landing by helicopter or on a runway prepared on the ice) or by icebreaker have become relatively routine, and are even available to small groups of tourists through [[Adventure travel|adventure holiday]] companies. Parachute jumps have frequently been made onto the North Pole in recent years. The temporary seasonal Russian camp of [[Barneo]] has been established by air a short distance from the Pole annually since 2002, and caters for scientific researchers as well as tourist parties. Trips from the camp to the Pole itself may be arranged overland or by helicopter.

The first attempt at [[Scuba diving|underwater]] exploration of the North Pole was made on 22 April 1998 by Russian firefighter and diver Andrei Rozhkov with the support of the Diving Club of [[Moscow State University]], but ended in fatality. The next attempted dive at the North Pole was organized the next year by the same diving club, and ended in success on 24 April 1999. The divers were Michael Wolff (Austria), Brett Cormick (UK), and Bob Wass (USA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.divernetxtra.com/technol/0200northpole.htm |last=Cormick |first=Brett |title=Diving the top of the world |date=February 2000 |publisher=Diver |accessdate=9 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324132821/http://www.divernetxtra.com/technol/0200northpole.htm |archivedate=24 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the United States Navy submarine [[USS Charlotte (SSN-766)|USS ''Charlotte'']] (SSN-766) surfaced through {{convert|155|cm|abbr=on}} of ice at the North Pole and spent 18 hours there.&lt;ref&gt;Ozeck, Dave (12 January 2005)  [https://web.archive.org/web/20081201130555/http://www.news.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=21223 USS Charlotte Achieves Milestone During Under-Ice Transit]. news.navy.mil.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007 British endurance swimmer [[Lewis Gordon Pugh]] completed a {{convert|1|km|abbr=on}} swim at the North Pole. His feat, undertaken to highlight the [[effects of global warming]], took place in clear water that had opened up between the ice floes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6899612.stm Swimmer rises to Arctic challenge], BBC news (15 July 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; His later attempt to paddle a [[kayak]] to the North Pole in late 2008, following the erroneous prediction of clear water to the Pole, was stymied when his expedition found itself stuck in thick ice after only three days. The expedition was then abandoned.

By September 2007 the North Pole had been visited 66 times by different surface ships: 54 times by Soviet and Russian icebreakers, 4 times by Swedish ''Oden'', 3 times by German [[RV Polarstern|''Polarstern'']], 3 times by [[USCGC Healy (WAGB-20)|USCGC ''Healy'']] and [[USCGC Polar Sea|USCGC ''Polar Sea'']], and once by [[CCGS Louis S. St-Laurent|CCGS ''Louis S. St-Laurent'']] and by Swedish ''[[Vidar Viking]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rg.ru/2007/09/19/arktika-shelf.html |title=Вчера и сегодня мы – первые.

[[File:Mir front.jpg|thumb|[[MIR (submersible)|MIR submersible]], one of the two vehicles that were used in [[Arktika 2007|the first ever manned descent to the seabed under the North Pole]]]]
On 2 August 2007 a Russian scientific expedition [[Arktika 2007]] made the first ever manned descent to the ocean floor at the North Pole, to a depth of {{convert|4.3|km|abbr=on}}, as part of the research programme in support of Russia's [[Territorial claims in the Arctic#2001 Russian claim|2001 extended continental shelf claim]] to a large swathe of the Arctic Ocean floor. The descent took place in two [[MIR (submersible)|MIR submersible]]s and was led by Soviet and Russian polar explorer [[Artur Chilingarov]]. In a symbolic act of visitation, the [[Flag of Russia|Russian flag]] was placed on the ocean floor exactly at the Pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ru icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20081221152823/http://www.aari.nw.ru/docs/press_release/20070709_fedorov.html «Академик Федоров» – выходит из порта Санкт-Петербург в экспедицию «Арктика-2007»].

The expedition was the latest in a series of efforts intended to give Russia a dominant influence in the [[Arctic]] according to ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/02/russias-north-pole-obsession/ Russia’s North Pole Obsession], The New York Times (2 August 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The warming [[Climate of the Arctic|Arctic climate]] and summer shrinkage of the iced area has attracted the attention of many countries, such as China and the United States, toward the top of the world, where resources and shipping routes may soon be exploitable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140104112559/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/series/thebigmelt/ "The Big Melt"], ''The New York Times'' (October 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

====MLAE 2009 Expedition====
In 2009 the Russian [[MLAE-2009|Marine Live-Ice Automobile Expedition (MLAE-2009)]] with [[Vasily Elagin]] as a leader and a team of Afanasy Makovnev, Vladimir Obikhod, Alexey Shkrabkin, Sergey Larin, Alexey Ushakov and Nikolay Nikulshin reached the North Pole on two custom-built 6 x 6 low-pressure-tire ATVs — Yemelya-1 and Yemelya-2, designed by Vasily Elagin, a known Russian mountain climber, explorer and engineer. The vehicles reached the North Pole on 26 April 2009, 17:30 (Moscow time). The expedition was partly supported by Russian State Aviation. The Russian Book of Records recognized it as the first successful vehicle trip from land to the Geographical North Pole.

====MLAE 2013 Expedition====

[[File:ML130310.JPG|thumb|Yemelya — all terrain amphibious vehicle]]

On 1 March 2013 the Russian Marine Live-Ice Automobile Expedition (MLAE 2013) with Vasily Elagin as a leader, and a team of Afanasy Makovnev, Vladimir Obikhod, Alexey Shkrabkin, Andrey Vankov, Sergey Isayev and Nikolay Kozlov on two custom-built 6 x 6 low-pressure-tire ATVs — Yemelya-3 and Yemelya-4,— started from Golomyanny Island (the Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago) to the North Pole across drifting ice of the Arctic Ocean. The vehicles reached the Pole on 6 April and then continued to the Canadian coast. The coast was reached on 30 April 2013 (83°08N, 075°59W Ward Hant Island), and on 5 May 2013 the expedition finished in Resolute Bay, NU. The way between the Russian borderland (Machtovyi Island of the Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago, 80°15N, 097°27E) and the Canadian coast (Ward Hant Island, 83°08N, 075°59W) took 55 days; it was ~2300&amp;nbsp;km across drifting ice and about 4000&amp;nbsp;km in total. The expedition was totally self-dependent and used no external supplies. The expedition was supported by the [[Russian Geographical Society]].&lt;ref name="yemelya.ru"&gt;[http://www.yemelya.ru/diary2013_en.php?lnk=2013 "Diary of MLAE-2013"]. ''yemelya.ru''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Day and night==
The sun at the North Pole is continuously [[Midnight sun|above the horizon]] during the summer and continuously [[Polar night|below the horizon]] during the winter. [[Sunrise]] is just before the [[March equinox]] (around 20 March); the sun then takes three months to reach its highest point of near 23½° elevation at the summer [[solstice]] (around 21 June), after which time it begins to sink, reaching [[sunset]] just after the [[September equinox]] (around 23 September). When the sun is visible in the polar sky, it appears to move in a horizontal circle above the horizon. This circle gradually rises from near the horizon just after the vernal equinox to its maximum elevation (in degrees) above the horizon at summer solstice and then sinks back toward the horizon before sinking below it at the autumnal equinox.  Hence the North and South Poles experience the slowest rates of sunrise and sunset on Earth.

A civil [[twilight]] period of about two weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset, a nautical twilight period of about five weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset and an astronomical twilight period of about seven weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset.

These effects are caused by a combination of the Earth's [[axial tilt]] and its revolution around the sun. The direction of the Earth's axial tilt, as well as its angle relative to the plane of the Earth's orbit around the sun, remains very nearly constant over the course of a year (both change very slowly over long time periods). At northern midsummer the North Pole is facing towards the sun to its maximum extent. As the year progresses and the Earth moves around the sun, the North Pole gradually turns away from the sun until at midwinter it is facing away from the Sun to its maximum extent. A similar sequence is observed at the South Pole, with a six-month time difference.

==Time==
In most places on Earth, local time is determined by longitude, such that the time of day is more-or-less synchronised to the position of the sun in the sky (for example, at midday the sun is roughly at its highest). This line of reasoning fails at the North Pole, where the sun rises and sets only once per year, and all lines of longitude, and hence all time zones, converge. There is no permanent human presence at the North Pole and no particular time zone has been assigned. Polar expeditions may use any time zone that is convenient, such as [[Greenwich Mean Time]], or the time zone of the country from which they departed{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}.

==Climate==
[[File:2007 Arctic Sea Ice.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Climate change in the Arctic|Arctic ice shrinkage]]s of 2007 compared to 2005 and also compared to the 1979–2000 average.]]
{{main|Climate of the Arctic}}
{{See also|Climate change in the Arctic}}
The North Pole is substantially warmer than the [[South Pole]] because it lies at sea level in the middle of an ocean (which acts as a reservoir of heat), rather than at altitude on a continental land mass. Despite being an ice cap, it shares some characteristics with a tundra climate (''ETf'') due to the July and August temperatures peaking just above freezing.{{Citation needed|reason=Temperatures peak above freezing in the Greenland weather station but there is not evidence that's true at the North Pole|date=July 2018}}

Winter temperatures at the northernmost weather station in Greenland can range from about {{convert|-50|to|-13|C|0}}, averaging around {{convert|-31|C|0}}, with the North Pole being slightly colder.{{Ref|A|A}} However, a freak storm caused the temperature to reach {{convert|0.7|C|0}} for a time at a [[World Meteorological Organization]] buoy, located at 87.45°N, on December 30, 2015. It was estimated that the temperature at the North Pole was between {{convert|30|and|35|F|0}} during the storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2015/12/30/freak-storm-has-pushed-north-pole-to-freezing-point-50-degrees-above-normal/|title=Freak storm pushes North Pole 50 degrees above normal to melting point|first1=Angela|last1=Fritz|first2=Angela|last2=Fritz|date=30 December 2015|publisher=|via=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summer temperatures (June, July, and August) average around the freezing point ({{convert|0|C|0}}). The highest temperature yet recorded is {{convert|13|C|0}},&lt;ref name = weather /&gt; much warmer than the South Pole's record high of only {{convert|-12.3|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/features/contenthandler.cfm?id=2563 "Antarctic Sun: Heat Wave"], US Antarctic Program&lt;/ref&gt; A similar spike in temperatures occurred on November 15, 2016 when temperatures hit freezing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://weather.com/news/climate/news/north-pole-above-freezing-siberia-cold-nov2016|title=Bizarre Temperatures: North Pole Rises Above Freezing While Parts of Russia Plunge Below -40 Degrees|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet again, February 2018 featured a storm so powerful that temperatures at Cape Morris Jesup, the world's northernmost weather station in Greenland, reached {{convert|6.1|C|0}} and spent 24 straight hours above freezing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/february-2018-heatwave-across-far-north|title=February 2018 heatwave across the Far North|publisher=NOAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the pole itself was estimated to reach a high temperature of {{convert|1.6|C|0}}. This same temperature of {{convert|1.6|C|0}} was also recorded at the [[Hollywood Burbank Airport]] in [[Los Angeles]] at the very same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=lox|title=NOWData - NOAA Online Weather Data|publisher=NOAA/NWS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sea ice at the North Pole is typically around {{convert|2|to|3|m|abbr=on}} thick,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/11/1108_041108_north_pole.html Beyond "Polar Express": Fast Facts on the Real North Pole], National Geographic News&lt;/ref&gt; although ice thickness, its spatial extent, and the fraction of open water within the ice pack can vary rapidly and profoundly in response to weather and climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sea Ice|url=http://nsidc.org/cryosphere/sotc/sea_ice.html|work=State of the Cryosphere|publisher=NSIDC|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have shown that the average ice thickness has decreased in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/3353930/Arctic-ice-thickness-drops-by-up-to-19-per-cent.html "Arctic ice thickness drops by up to 19 percent"], ''The Daily Telegraph'' (28 October 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that [[global warming]] has contributed to this, but it is not possible to attribute the recent abrupt decrease in thickness entirely to the observed warming in the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Model-Based Estimates of Change|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch4s4-4-3-4.html|publisher=IPCC|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports have also predicted that within a few decades the Arctic Ocean will be entirely free of ice in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Amos (12 December 2006).

The retreat of the Arctic sea ice will accelerate global warming, as less ice cover reflects less solar radiation, and may have serious climate implications by contributing to Arctic cyclone generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Future of Arctic Climate and Global Impacts |url=http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/future/heat.html |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=6 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909120812/http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/future/heat.html |archivedate=9 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
[[Polar bear]]s are believed to travel rarely beyond about 82° North owing to the scarcity of food, though tracks have been seen in the vicinity of the North Pole, and a 2006 expedition reported sighting a polar bear just {{convert|1|mi|abbr=on}} from the Pole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/what_we_do/species/about_species/species_factsheets/polar_bear/pbear_population_distribution/index.cfm Polar Bear&amp;nbsp;– Population &amp; Distribution], WWF, January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectthinice.org/blog/view/13723/ Explorers' Blog] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013155730/http://www.projectthinice.org/blog/view/13723/ |date=13 October 2007 }}, Greenpeace Project Thin Ice (1 July 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ringed seal]] has also been seen at the Pole, and [[Arctic fox]]es have been observed less than {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} away at 89°40′&amp;nbsp;N.&lt;ref&gt;Halkka, Antti (February 2003).

Birds seen at or very near the Pole include the [[snow bunting]], [[northern fulmar]] and [[black-legged kittiwake]], though some bird sightings may be distorted by the tendency of birds to follow ships and expeditions.&lt;ref name=calgary&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic56-3-309.pdf |title=FARTHEST NORTH POLAR BEAR (Ursus maritimus) |format=PDF |accessdate=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish have been seen in the waters at the North Pole, but these are probably few in number.&lt;ref name="calgary"/&gt; A member of the Russian team that descended to the North Pole seabed in August 2007 reported seeing no sea creatures living there.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; However, it was later reported that a [[sea anemone]] had been scooped up from the seabed mud by the Russian team and that video footage from the dive showed unidentified [[shrimp]]s and [[Amphipoda|amphipods]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/02/sea-anemone-biology-arctic-north-pole-russia "North Pole sea anemone named most northerly species"], ''Observer'', 2 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Territorial claims to the North Pole and Arctic regions==

[[File:Sunset over the North Pole at the International Date line at 20,000 feet Aug 6th 2015 by D Ramey Logan.JPG|thumb|Sunset over the North Pole at the [[International Dateline]], 2015]]
&lt;!-- NOTE: please add detail to the "Territorial claims in the Arctic" article, and keep this as a short summary --&gt;
Currently, under [[international law]], no country owns the North Pole or the region of the Arctic Ocean surrounding it. The five surrounding Arctic countries, Russian Federation, Canada, Norway, Denmark (via Greenland), and the United States, are limited to a {{convert|200|nmi|adj=on|lk=in}} [[exclusive economic zone]] off their coasts, and the area beyond that is administered by the [[International Seabed Authority]].

Upon ratification of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]], a country has 10 years to make claims to an extended continental shelf beyond its 200-mile exclusive economic zone.

In 1907 Canada invoked a "sector principle" to claim sovereignty over a sector stretching from its coasts to the North Pole. This claim has not been relinquished, but was not consistently pressed until 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/canada-plans-claim-would-include-north-pole |title=Canada plans claim that would include North Pole |last1=Noronha |first1=Charmaine |date=9 December 2013 |website=9 December 2013 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.carc.org/pubs/v22no4/loss.htm|title=Arctic Sovereignty: Loss by Dereliction?|journal=Northern Perspectives|volume=22|issue=4|date=Winter 1994–1995|accessdate=16 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123034540/http://www.carc.org/pubs/v22no4/loss.htm|archive-date=23 November 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural associations==
In some children's [[Western culture]]s, the geographic North Pole is described as the location of [[Santa's workshop|Santa Claus' workshop and residence]],&lt;ref name="Legends"&gt;{{cite book |title=Legends of Santa Claus |last= Jeffers|first= Harry Paul|year= 2000|publisher= Twenty-First Century Books|isbn= 0-8225-4983-2|page= 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/living/bay-city/index.ssf/2009/12/meet_your_neighbor_santa_claus.html|title=Meet your neighbor: Santa Claus of the North Pole|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the depictions have been inconsistent between the geographic and magnetic North Pole.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} [[Canada Post]] has assigned postal code [[H0H 0H0]] to the North Pole (referring to Santa's traditional exclamation of "[[Ho ho ho]]!").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadapost.ca/business/corporate/about/newsroom/pr/archive-e.asp?prid=1197 |title=Canada Post Launches 24th Annual Santa Letter-writing Program – Post Office Sends Joy to Salvation Army with $25,000 Donation |website=Canada Post |date=15 November 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411032948/http://www.canadapost.ca/business/corporate/about/newsroom/pr/archive-e.asp?prid=1197 |archivedate=11 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This association reflects an age-old esoteric mythology of [[Hyperborea]] that posits the North Pole, the otherworldly world-axis, as the abode of God and superhuman beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=1993|title=Arktos: The Polar Myth in Science, Symbolism, and Nazi Survival|isbn=0932813356|author=Godwin, Joscelyn|location=Grand Rapids|publisher= Phanes Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular figure of the pole-dwelling Santa Claus thus functions as an archetype of spiritual purity and transcendence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livingheritage.org/pole-spirits.htm |title=Pole-Spirits North and South|website= Livingheritage.org|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Henry Corbin]] has documented, the North Pole plays a key part in the cultural worldview of [[Sufism]] and Iranian mysticism. "The Orient sought by the mystic, the Orient that cannot be located on our maps, is in the direction of the north, beyond the north."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Corbin, Henry and Pearson, N. (Translator)|title=The Man of Light in Iranian Sufism|date= 1978|publisher=Shambhala|isbn=0394734416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to its remoteness, the Pole is sometimes identified with a mysterious mountain of ancient [[Culture of Iran|Iranian]] tradition called [[Mount Qaf]] (Jabal Qaf), the "farthest point of the earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=[[Ibrahim Muhawi]] &amp; Sharif Kanaana| title=Speak, Bird, Speak Again: Palestinian Arab Folktales|location= Berkeley|publisher= University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Irgam Yigfagna|title=al-Jabal al-Lamma}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to certain authors, the Jabal Qaf of [[Cosmology in medieval Islam|Muslim cosmology]] is a version of [[Rupes Nigra]], a mountain whose ascent, like [[Dante Alighieri|Dante's]] climbing of the [[Purgatorio|Mountain of Purgatory]], represents the pilgrim's progress through spiritual states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Irgam Yigfagna|title=al-Jabal al-Lamma|page= 44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Iranian theosophy, the heavenly Pole, the focal point of the spiritual ascent, acts as a magnet to draw beings to its "palaces ablaze with immaterial matter." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Irgam Yigfagna|title=al-Jabal al-Lamma|page= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Open Source Routing Machine''' or '''OSRM''' is a [[C++]] implementation of a high-performance routing engine for [[shortest path]]s in [[road network]]s. Licensed under the permissive 2-clause BSD license, OSRM is a free network service. OSRM supports Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, and Mac OS X platform.

==Overview==
It combines sophisticated [[routing algorithm]]s with the open and free road network data of the [[OpenStreetMap]] (OSM) project. Shortest path computation on a continental sized network can take up to several seconds if it is done without a so-called speedup-technique. OSRM uses an implementation of [[Contraction Hierarchies]] and is able to compute and output a shortest path between any origin and destination within a few milliseconds, whereby the pure route computation takes much less time. Most effort is spent in annotating the route and transmitting the geometry over the network.

Since it is designed with OpenStreetMap compatibility in mind, OSM data files can be easily imported. A demo installation is sponsored by [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] and previously by Geofabrik. OSRM is under active development. The screen shot image shown is since Sept 2015 out of date with loss of attendant routing service features.

OSRM was part of the 2011 [[Google]] [[Summer of Code]] class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/google/gsoc2011/bharathv/13001 "Improvements to the Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM)."] [http://www.google-melange.com Google Summer of Code 2011]. Accessed May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to the Maldives:

The '''[[Maldives]]''' &amp;ndash; [[island nation]] comprising a [[Atolls of the Maldives|group of atoll]]s in the [[Indian Ocean]].&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook&gt;{{cite web|date=July 7, 2009|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mv.html|title=Maldives|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=[[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Maldives is located south of [[India]]'s [[Lakshadweep]] islands, and about seven hundred kilometres (435&amp;nbsp;mi) south-west of [[Sri Lanka]]. The twenty-six [[atoll]]s of Maldives' encompass a [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] featuring 1,192 [[islets]], two hundred and fifty islands of which are inhabited.

The name "Maldives" may derive from ''Maale Dhivehi Raajje'' ("The Island Kingdom [under the authority of] [[Malé]]")."&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, ''Comparative Dravidian Grammar'', p. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe that the name "Maldives" derives from the [[Sanskrit]] ''maladvipa'', meaning "garland of islands",&lt;ref&gt;J Hogendorn and M Johnson, ''The Shell Money of the Slave Trade'', p. 20-22&lt;/ref&gt; or from ''mahila dvipa'', meaning "island of women",{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} but these names are not found in ancient Sanskrit literature. Instead, classical [[Sanskrit]] texts mention the "Hundred Thousand Islands" ([[Lakshadweepa]]); a generic name which would include not only the Maldives, but also the [[Laccadives]] and the [[Chagos Archipelago|Chagos island]] groups.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}  Another theory suggests that the name "Maldives" derives from the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] "malai tivu" meaning "island of hills." Some medieval Arab travellers such as [[Ibn Batuta]] called the islands "Mahal Dibiyat" from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''Mahal'' ("palace")." &lt;ref&gt;Ibn Batuta, Travels in Asia and Africa, translated by A.R. Gibb&lt;/ref&gt; This is the name presently inscribed in the scroll of the [[Emblem of Maldives|Maldive state emblem]].

The inhabitants were [[Buddhist]], probably since [[Ashoka]]'s period, in the 3rd century BC. [[Islam in Maldives|Islam was introduced]] in 1153. The Maldives came then under the influence of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] (1558) and the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch]] (1654) seaborne empires. And in 1887 it became a [[Indies|British]] protectorate. In 1965, the Maldives obtained [[national independence|independence]] from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] (originally under the name "Maldive Islands"), and in 1968 the [[Sultanate]] was replaced by a [[Republic]].

The Maldives is the smallest [[Asia]]n country in terms of population. It is also the smallest predominantly [[Muslim]] nation in the world.

'''Paul C. Adams''' is Professor and Director of Urban Studies at the [[Department of Geography and the Environment at University of Texas at Austin]]. Adams applies various approaches from [[human geography]] to study media and communication. His research has helped develop the subdiscipline [[geography of media and communication]] by integrating studies of place representations, communication infrastructures, social processes, and routines of media use in daily life.

==Background==
In 1984, Adams received his Bachelor of Environmental Design (with Special Honors) from the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] in [[Boulder, Colorado]].  He received his M.S. in Geography in 1990 and his Ph.D. in Geography in 1993, both from the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]]. Adams specializes in geography of communication technologies, [[nationalism]], [[critical geopolitics]], and representations of space and place. Before arriving at the University of Texas at Austin, Adams had held academic positions at [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|Virginia Tech]], the [[State University of New York at Albany]], and [[Texas A&amp;M University]].&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul C. Adams webpage|url=https://webspace.utexas.edu/adamspc3/mainpage/|publisher=University of Texas at Austin website|accessdate=21 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927190034/https://webspace.utexas.edu/adamspc3/mainpage/|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has held visiting research and teaching fellowships at [[Karlstad University]] in Sweden, [[University of Bergen]] in Norway, and [[McGill University]] and [[Université de Montréal]] in Quebec. 
He has also held visiting professor appointments at [[Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz]], in Germany, and [[University of Canterbury]], in Christchurch, New Zealand.

The '''Phoenix Plate''' (also known as the '''Aluk''' or '''Drake Plate''') was an ancient [[tectonic plate]] that existed during the mid-[[Cretaceous]] through early [[Cenozoic]] time.  The remainder of the plate is now located east of the [[Drake Passage]]/[[Shackleton Fracture Zone]].

The Phoenix Plate began [[subduct]]ing under the [[Antarctic Plate]]. The [[Phoenix Ridge]], a [[mid-oceanic ridge]] between the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]] and the Phoenix Plates which had a spreading rate of 18–20&amp;nbsp;cm per year until around 84 [[Annum|Ma]]. A major decrease in spreading rate, and the convergence rate with the Antarctic Plate occurred around 52.3 Ma. During the [[Late Cretaceous]], the Phoenix Plate fragmented into the [[Charcot Plate]], much in the same way in which the [[Rivera Plate|Rivera]] and the [[Cocos Plate]] were formed by the fragmentation of the [[Farallon Plate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCarron|Larter|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Antarctic-Phoenix Ridge (sometimes also called the Phoenix Ridge) consists of three extinct spreading ridge segments between the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] and the [[Scotia Sea]].  This ridge was initiated during the Late Cretaceous-Early Tertiary when the plate had divergent boundaries with the [[Bellingshausen Plate|Bellingshausen]] and [[Pacific Plate]]s.  Bellingshausen was fused with the Antarctic Plate around 61 Ma and the Phoenix plate was gradually subducted by the Antarctic Plate as the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge propagated.  The last collision between ridge crest segments and the subduction zone happened around 6.5 Ma and spreading had ceased entirely by 3.3 Ma when the small remnant of the Phoenix Plate was incorporated into the Antarctic Plate.  The [[South Shetland Trough]] is the south-eastern boundary of the remnant and the Shackleton Fracture Zone is its north-eastern boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eagles|2003|loc=2. Tectonic setting, p. 98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Remote sensing''' is the acquisition of information about an object or phenomenon without making physical contact with the object and thus in contrast to on-site observation, especially the Earth. Remote sensing is used in numerous fields, including geography, land surveying and most Earth Science disciplines (for example, hydrology, [[ecology]], meteorology, oceanography, glaciology, geology); it also has military, intelligence, commercial, economic, planning, and humanitarian applications.

In current usage, the term "remote sensing" generally refers to the use of satellite- or aircraft-based sensor technologies to detect and classify objects on Earth, including on the surface and in the [[atmosphere]] and [[oceans]], based on [[Wave propagation|propagated signals]] (e.g. [[electromagnetic radiation]]). It may be split into "active" remote sensing (i.e., when a signal is emitted by a satellite or aircraft and its reflection by the object is detected by the sensor) and "passive" remote sensing (i.e., when the reflection of sunlight is detected by the sensor).&lt;ref name=Ran/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schowengerdt, Robert A.|title=Remote sensing: models and methods for image processing|publisher=Academic Press|edition=3rd|date=2007|isbn=978-0-12-369407-2|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KQXNaDH0X-IC&amp;pg=PA2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schott, John Robert|title=Remote sensing: the image chain approach|publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=2nd|date=2007|isbn=978-0-19-517817-3|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uoXvgwOzAkQC&amp;pg=PT20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guo&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Mapping The Future With Landsat.ogv|thumb|upright=1.3|This video is about how [[Landsat]] was used to identify areas of conservation in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and how it was used to help map an area called [[Maringa-Lopori-Wamba Landscape|MLW]] in the north.]]
Passive sensors gather radiation that is emitted or reflected by the object or surrounding areas. Reflected [[sunlight]] is the most common source of radiation measured by passive sensors. Examples of passive remote sensors include film [[photography]], [[infrared]], [[charge-coupled devices]], and [[radiometers]]. Active collection, on the other hand, emits energy in order to scan objects and areas whereupon a sensor then detects and measures the radiation that is reflected or backscattered from the target. [[Radar|RADAR]] and [[Lidar|LiDAR]] are examples of active remote sensing where the time delay between emission and return is measured, establishing the location, speed and direction of an object.
[[File:Remote Sensing Illustration.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of remote sensing]]

Remote sensing makes it possible to collect data of dangerous or inaccessible areas. Remote sensing applications include monitoring [[deforestation]] in areas such as the [[Amazon Basin]], [[glacier|glacial]] features in Arctic and Antarctic regions, and [[depth sounding]] of coastal and ocean depths. Military collection during the [[Cold War]] made use of stand-off collection of data about dangerous border areas. Remote sensing also replaces costly and slow data collection on the ground, ensuring in the process that areas or objects are not disturbed.

Orbital platforms collect and transmit data from different parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], which in conjunction with larger scale aerial or ground-based sensing and analysis, provides researchers with enough information to monitor trends such as [[El Niño]] and other natural long and short term phenomena. Other uses include different areas of the [[earth science]]s such as [[natural resource management]], agricultural fields such as land usage and conservation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saving the monkeys|url=https://spie.org/membership/spie-professional-magazine/journal-of-applied-remote-sensing-saving-monkey-habitat|publisher=SPIE Professional|accessdate=1 Jan 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Howard, A.|display-authors=etal|title=Remote sensing and habitat mapping for bearded capuchin monkeys (Sapajus libidinosus): landscapes for the use of stone tools|journal=Journal of Applied Remote Sensing|date=Aug 19, 2015|volume=9|issue=1|doi=10.1117/1.JRS.9.096020}}&lt;/ref&gt; and national security and overhead, ground-based and stand-off collection on border areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hurricanes.nasa.gov/earth-sun/technology/remote_sensing.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929081013/http://hurricanes.nasa.gov/earth-sun/technology/remote_sensing.html |archivedate=29 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of data acquisition techniques ==
The basis for multispectral collection and analysis is that of examined areas or objects that reflect or emit radiation that stand out from surrounding areas. For a summary of major remote sensing satellite systems see the [[Remote sensing satellite and data overview|overview table]].

=== Applications of remote sensing ===
{{more|Remote sensing (geology)|Remote sensing (archaeology)}}
* Conventional radar is mostly associated with aerial traffic control, early warning, and certain large scale meteorological data. [[Doppler radar]] is used by local law enforcements’ monitoring of speed limits and in enhanced [[Weather radar|meteorological collection]] such as wind speed and direction within weather systems in addition to precipitation location and intensity. Other types of active collection includes [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]] in the [[ionosphere]]. [[Interferometric synthetic aperture radar]] is used to produce precise [[digital elevation model]]s of large scale terrain (See [[RADARSAT]], [[TerraSAR-X]], [[Magellan probe|Magellan]]).
* Laser and [[radar altimeter|radar]] [[altimeter]]s on satellites have provided a wide range of data. By measuring the bulges of water caused by gravity, they map features on the seafloor to a resolution of a mile or so. By measuring the height and wavelength of ocean waves, the altimeters measure wind speeds and direction, and surface ocean currents and directions.
* Ultrasound (acoustic) and radar tide gauges measure sea level, tides and wave direction in coastal and offshore tide gauges.
* [[Light detection and ranging]] (LIDAR) is well known in examples of weapon ranging, laser illuminated homing of projectiles. LIDAR is used to detect and measure the concentration of various chemicals in the atmosphere, while airborne LIDAR can be used to measure heights of objects and features on the ground more accurately than with radar technology. Vegetation remote sensing is a principal application of LIDAR.
* [[Radiometer]]s and [[photometer]]s are the most common instrument in use, collecting reflected and emitted radiation in a wide range of frequencies. The most common are visible and infrared sensors, followed by microwave, gamma ray and rarely, ultraviolet. They may also be used to detect the [[emission spectra]] of various chemicals, providing data on chemical concentrations in the atmosphere.
*[[Polarimetry#Imaging|Spectropolarimetric Imaging]] has been reported to be useful for target tracking purposes by researchers at the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory]]. They determined that manmade items possess polarimetric signatures that are not found in natural objects. These conclusions were drawn from the imaging of military trucks, like the [[Humvee]], and trailers with their [[Acousto-optic modulator|acousto-optic tunable filter]] dual hyperspectral and spectropolarimetric VNIR Spectropolarimetric Imager.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, A.; Stann, B.; Gupta, N. (July 2003). "Multispectral, Hyperspectral, and Three-Dimensional Imaging Research at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory" (PDF).

* Simultaneous multi-spectral platforms such as Landsat have been in use since the 1970s. These thematic mappers take images in multiple wavelengths of electro-magnetic radiation (multi-spectral) and are usually found on [[Earth observation satellite]]s, including (for example) the [[Landsat program]] or the [[IKONOS]] satellite. Maps of land cover and land use from thematic mapping can be used to prospect for minerals, detect or monitor land usage, detect invasive vegetation, deforestation, and examine the health of indigenous plants and crops, including entire farming regions or forests.&lt;ref name=guo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ran&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ran | first=Lingyan | last2=Zhang | first2=Yanning | last3=Wei | first3=Wei | last4=Zhang | first4=Qilin | title=A Hyperspectral Image Classification Framework with Spatial Pixel Pair Features | journal=Sensors | volume=17 | issue=10 | date=2017-10-23 | doi=10.3390/s17102421 | url=http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/17/10/2421 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landsat images are used by regulatory agencies such as KYDOW to indicate water quality parameters including Secchi depth, chlorophyll a density and total phosphorus content.

* [[Hyperspectral imaging]] produces an image where each pixel has full spectral information with imaging narrow spectral bands over a contiguous spectral range. Hyperspectral imagers are used in various applications including mineralogy, biology, defence, and environmental measurements.
* Within the scope of the combat against [[desertification]], remote sensing allows researchers to follow up and monitor risk areas in the long term, to determine desertification factors, to support decision-makers in defining relevant measures of environmental management, and to assess their impacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csf-desertification.eu/dossier/item/remote-sensing-a-tool-to-monitor-and-assess-desertification Begni G.

=== Geodetic ===
* [[Geodesy|Geodetic]] remote sensing can be [[gravimetry|gravimetric]] or geometric. Overhead gravity data collection was first used in aerial submarine detection. This data revealed minute perturbations in the Earth’s [[gravitational field]] that may be used to determine changes in the mass distribution of the Earth, which in turn may be used for geophysical studies, as in [[GRACE (satellite)|GRACE]]. Geometric remote sensing includes position and deformation [[Radar imaging|imaging]] using [[InSAR]], LIDAR, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unavco.org/instrumentation/geophysical/imaging/imaging.html Geodetic Imaging]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acoustic and near-acoustic ===
* [[Sonar]]: ''passive sonar'', listening for the sound made by another object (a vessel, a whale etc.); ''active sonar'', emitting pulses of sounds and listening for echoes, used for detecting, ranging and measurements of underwater objects and terrain.
* [[seismograph|Seismograms]] taken at different locations can locate and measure [[earthquake]]s (after they occur) by comparing the relative intensity and precise timings.
* [[Ultrasound]]: Ultrasound sensors, that emit high frequency pulses and listening for echoes, used for detecting water waves and water level, as in tide gauges or for towing tanks.

To coordinate a series of large-scale observations, most sensing systems depend on the following: platform location and the orientation of the sensor. High-end instruments now often use positional information from [[satellite navigation system]]s. The rotation and orientation is often provided within a degree or two with electronic compasses. Compasses can measure not just azimuth (i. e. degrees to magnetic north), but also altitude (degrees above the horizon), since the magnetic field curves into the Earth at different angles at different latitudes. More exact orientations require [[inertial navigation system|gyroscopic-aided orientation]], periodically realigned by different methods including navigation from stars or known benchmarks.

== Data processing ==
{{See also|Inverse problem}}
Generally speaking, remote sensing works on the principle of the ''inverse problem''. While the object or phenomenon of interest (the '''state''') may not be directly measured, there exists some other variable that can be detected and measured (the '''observation''') which may be related to the object of interest through a calculation. The common analogy given to describe this is trying to determine the type of animal from its footprints. For example, while it is impossible to directly measure temperatures in the upper atmosphere, it is possible to measure the spectral emissions from a known chemical species (such as carbon dioxide) in that region. The frequency of the emissions may then be related via [[thermodynamics]] to the temperature in that region.

The quality of remote sensing data consists of its spatial, spectral, radiometric and temporal resolutions.

; Spatial resolution: The size of a [[pixel]] that is recorded in a [[raster graphics|raster image]] – typically pixels may correspond to square areas ranging in side length from {{convert|1|to|1000|m|ft}}.
; Spectral resolution: The wavelength of the different frequency bands recorded – usually, this is related to the number of frequency bands recorded by the platform. Current [[Landsat]] collection is that of seven bands, including several in the [[infrared]] spectrum, ranging from a spectral resolution of 0.7 to 2.1 μm. The Hyperion sensor on Earth Observing-1 resolves 220 bands from 0.4 to 2.5 μm, with a spectral resolution of 0.10 to 0.11 μm per band.
; Radiometric resolution: The number of different intensities of radiation the sensor is able to distinguish. Typically, this ranges from 8 to 14 bits, corresponding to 256 levels of the gray scale and up to 16,384 intensities or "shades" of colour, in each band. It also depends on the instrument [[noise]].
; Temporal resolution: The frequency of flyovers by the satellite or plane, and is only relevant in time-series studies or those requiring an averaged or mosaic image as in deforesting monitoring. This was first used by the intelligence community where repeated coverage revealed changes in infrastructure, the deployment of units or the modification/introduction of equipment. Cloud cover over a given area or object makes it necessary to repeat the collection of said location.

In order to create sensor-based maps, most remote sensing systems expect to extrapolate sensor data in relation to a reference point including distances between known points on the ground. This depends on the type of sensor used. For example, in conventional photographs, distances are accurate in the center of the image, with the distortion of measurements increasing the farther you get from the center. Another factor is that of the platen&lt;!-- "platen" is correctly spelled --&gt; against which the film is pressed can cause severe errors when photographs are used to measure ground distances. The step in which this problem is resolved is called [[georeference|georeferencing]], and involves computer-aided matching of points in the image (typically 30 or more points per image) which is extrapolated with the use of an established benchmark, "warping" the image to produce accurate spatial data. As of the early 1990s, most satellite images are sold fully georeferenced.

In addition, images may need to be radiometrically and atmospherically corrected.

; Radiometric correction: Allows avoidance of radiometric errors and distortions. The illumination of objects on the Earth surface is uneven because of different properties of the relief. This factor is taken into account in the method of radiometric distortion correction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ntv.ifmo.ru/en/article/13668/metod_korrekcii_radiometricheskih_iskazheniymnogozonalnyh_dannyh_distancionnogozondirovaniya_zemli.htm|title=Мethod of radiometric distortion correction of multispectral data for the earth remote sensing.|author=Grigoriev А.N.|journal=Scientific and Technical Journal of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics|volume=15|issue=4|pages=595–602|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Radiometric correction gives a scale to the pixel values, e. g. the monochromatic scale of 0 to 255 will be converted to actual radiance values.
; Topographic correction (also called terrain correction): In rugged mountains, as a result of terrain, the effective illumination of pixels varies considerably. In a remote sensing image, the pixel on the shady slope receives weak illumination and has a low radiance value, in contrast, the pixel on the sunny slope receives strong illumination and has a high radiance value. For the same object, the pixel radiance value on the shady slope will be different from that on the sunny slope. Additionally, different objects may have similar radiance values. These ambiguities seriously affected remote sensing image information extraction accuracy in mountainous areas. It became the main obstacle to further application of remote sensing images. The purpose of topographic correction is to eliminate this effect, recovering the true reflectivity or radiance of objects in horizontal conditions. It is the premise of quantitative remote sensing application.
; [[Atmospheric correction]]: Elimination of atmospheric haze by rescaling each frequency band so that its minimum value (usually realised in water bodies) corresponds to a pixel value of 0. The digitizing of data also makes it possible to manipulate the data by changing gray-scale values.

Interpretation is the critical process of making sense of the data. The first application was that of aerial photographic collection which used the following process; spatial measurement through the use of a [[light table]] in both conventional single or stereographic coverage, added skills such as the use of photogrammetry, the use of photomosaics, repeat coverage, Making use of objects’ known dimensions in order to detect modifications. Image Analysis is the recently developed automated computer-aided application which is in increasing use.

Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) is a sub-discipline of GIScience devoted to partitioning remote sensing (RS) imagery into meaningful image-objects, and assessing their characteristics through spatial, spectral and temporal scale.

Old data from remote sensing is often valuable because it may provide the only long-term data for a large extent of geography. At the same time, the data is often complex to interpret, and bulky to store. Modern systems tend to store the data digitally, often with [[lossless compression]]. The difficulty with this approach is that the data is fragile, the format may be archaic, and the data may be easy to falsify. One of the best systems for archiving data series is as computer-generated machine-readable [[ultrafiche]], usually in typefonts such as [[OCR-B]], or as digitized half-tone images. Ultrafiches survive well in standard libraries, with lifetimes of several centuries. They can be created, copied, filed and retrieved by automated systems. They are about as compact as archival magnetic media, and yet can be read by human beings with minimal, standardized equipment.

=== Data processing levels ===
To facilitate the discussion of data processing in practice, several processing "levels" were first defined in 1986 by NASA as part of its [[Earth Observing System]]&lt;ref&gt;NASA (1986), ''Report of the EOS data panel'', Earth Observing System, Data and Information System, Data Panel Report, Vol. IIa., NASA Technical Memorandum 87777, June 1986, 62 pp. Available at [http://hdl.handle.net/2060/19860021622 http://hdl.handle.net/2060/19860021622]&lt;/ref&gt; and steadily adopted since then, both internally at NASA (e. g.,&lt;ref&gt;C. L. Parkinson, A. Ward, M. D. King (Eds.) ''Earth Science Reference Handbook – A Guide to NASA’s Earth Science Program and Earth Observing Satellite Missions'', National Aeronautics and Space Administration Washington, D. C. Available at [http://eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp_docs/2006ReferenceHandbook.pdf http://eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp_docs/2006ReferenceHandbook.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415095934/http://eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp_docs/2006ReferenceHandbook.pdf |date=15 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and elsewhere (e. g.,&lt;ref&gt;GRAS-SAF (2009), ''Product User Manual'', GRAS Satellite Application Facility, Version 1.2.1, 31 March 2009. Available at [http://www.grassaf.org/general-documents/products/grassaf_pum_v121.pdf http://www.grassaf.org/general-documents/products/grassaf_pum_v121.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;); these definitions are:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Level
! Description
|-
| 0
| Reconstructed, unprocessed instrument and payload data at full resolution, with any and all communications artifacts (e. g., synchronization frames, communications headers, duplicate data) removed.
|-
| 1a
| Reconstructed, unprocessed instrument data at full resolution, time-referenced, and annotated with ancillary information, including radiometric and geometric calibration coefficients and georeferencing parameters (e. g., platform ephemeris) computed and appended but not applied to the Level 0 data (or if applied, in a manner that level 0 is fully recoverable from level 1a data).
|-
| 1b
| Level 1a data that have been processed to sensor units (e. g., radar backscatter cross section, brightness temperature, etc.); not all instruments have Level 1b data; level 0 data is not recoverable from level 1b data.
|-
| 2
| Derived geophysical variables (e. g., ocean wave height, soil moisture, ice concentration) at the same resolution and location as Level 1 source data.
|-
| 3
| Variables mapped on uniform spacetime grid scales, usually with some completeness and consistency (e. g., missing points interpolated, complete regions mosaicked together from multiple orbits, etc.).
|-
| 4
| Model output or results from analyses of lower level data (i. e., variables that were not measured by the instruments but instead are derived from these measurements).
|}

A Level 1 data record is the most fundamental (i. e., highest reversible level) data record that has significant scientific utility, and is the foundation upon which all subsequent data sets are produced. Level 2 is the first level that is directly usable for
most scientific applications; its value is much greater than the lower levels. Level 2 data sets tend to be less voluminous than Level 1 data because they have been reduced temporally, spatially, or spectrally. Level 3 data sets are generally smaller than lower level data sets and thus can be dealt with without incurring a great deal of data handling overhead. These data tend to be generally more useful for many applications. The regular spatial and temporal organization of Level 3 datasets makes it feasible to readily combine data from different sources.

While these processing levels are particularly suitable for typical satellite data processing pipelines, other data level vocabularies have been defined and may be appropriate for more heterogeneous workflows.

{{unsourced|section|date=August 2018}}
[[Image:Usaf.u2.750pix.jpg|thumb|The [[Lockheed U-2|TR-1]] reconnaissance/surveillance aircraft]]
[[Image:2001 mars odyssey wizja.jpg|thumb|The ''[[2001 Mars Odyssey]]'' used spectrometers and imagers to hunt for evidence of past or present water and volcanic activity on Mars.]]
The modern discipline of remote sensing arose with the development of flight. The balloonist G. Tournachon (alias [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]]) made photographs of Paris from his balloon in 1858. Messenger pigeons, kites, rockets and unmanned balloons were also used for early images. With the exception of balloons, these first, individual images were not particularly useful for map making or for scientific purposes.

Systematic [[aerial photography]] was developed for military surveillance and reconnaissance purposes beginning in [[World War I]] and reaching a climax during the [[Cold War]] with the use of modified combat aircraft such as the [[P-51]], [[P-38]], [[RB-66]] and the [[F-4C]], or specifically designed collection platforms such as the [[Lockheed U-2|U2/TR-1]], [[SR-71]], [[A-5 Vigilante|A-5]] and the [[OV-1]] series both in overhead and stand-off collection. A more recent development is that of increasingly smaller sensor pods such as those used by law enforcement and the military, in both manned and unmanned platforms. The advantage of this approach is that this requires minimal modification to a given airframe. Later imaging technologies would include infrared, conventional, Doppler and synthetic aperture radar.

The development of artificial satellites in the latter half of the 20th century allowed remote sensing to progress to a global scale as of the end of the Cold War. Instrumentation aboard various Earth observing and weather satellites such as [[Landsat program|Landsat]], the [[Nimbus program|Nimbus]] and more recent missions such as [[RADARSAT]] and [[Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite|UARS]] provided global measurements of various data for civil, research, and military purposes. Space probes to other planets have also provided the opportunity to conduct remote sensing studies in extraterrestrial environments, synthetic aperture radar aboard the [[Magellan probe|Magellan]] spacecraft provided detailed topographic maps of [[Venus]], while instruments aboard [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] allowed studies to be performed on the [[Sun]] and the [[solar wind]], just to name a few examples.

Recent developments include, beginning in the 1960s and 1970s with the development of [[image processing]] of [[satellite imagery]]. Several research groups in [[Silicon Valley]] including [[NASA Ames Research Center]], [[GTE]], and [[ESL Inc.]] developed [[Fourier transform]] techniques leading to the first notable enhancement of imagery data. In 1999 the first commercial satellite (IKONOS) collecting very high resolution imagery was launched.

== Training and education ==
At most universities remote sensing is associated with [[Geography]] departments. Remote Sensing has a growing relevance in the modern information society. It represents a key technology as part of the aerospace industry and bears increasing economic relevance – new sensors e.g. [[TerraSAR-X]] and [[RapidEye]] are developed constantly and the demand for skilled labour is increasing steadily. Furthermore, remote sensing exceedingly influences everyday life, ranging from [[weather forecasts]] to reports on [[climate change]] or [[natural disasters]]. As an example, 80% of the German students use the services of [[Google Earth]]; in 2006 alone the software was downloaded 100 million times. But studies have shown that only a fraction of them know more about the data they are working with.&lt;ref&gt;Ditter, R., Haspel, M., Jahn, M., Kollar, I., Siegmund, A., Viehrig, K., Volz, D., Siegmund, A. (2012) Geospatial technologies in school – theoretical concept and practical implementation in K-12 schools. In: International Journal of Data Mining, Modelling and Management (IJDMMM): FutureGIS: Riding the Wave of a Growing Geospatial Technology Literate Society; Vol. X&lt;/ref&gt; There exists a huge [[Knowledge gap hypothesis|knowledge gap]] between the application and the understanding of satellite images.
Remote sensing only plays a tangential role in schools, regardless of the political claims to strengthen the support for teaching on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Stork, E.J., Sakamoto, S.O., and Cowan, R.M. (1999) "The integration of science explorations through the use of earth images in middle school curriculum", Proc. IEEE Trans. Geosci. Remote Sensing 37, 1801–1817&lt;/ref&gt; A lot of the computer software explicitly developed for school lessons has not yet been implemented due to its complexity. Thereby, the subject is either not at all integrated into the curriculum or does not pass the step of an interpretation of analogue images. In fact, the subject of remote sensing requires a consolidation of physics and mathematics as well as [[Competence (human resources)|competences]] in the fields of media and methods apart from the mere visual interpretation of satellite images.

Many teachers have great interest in the subject "remote sensing", being motivated to integrate this topic into teaching, provided that the curriculum is considered. In many cases, this encouragement fails because of confusing information.&lt;ref&gt;Bednarz, S.W. and Whisenant, S.E. (2000) "Mission geography: linking national geography standards, innovative technologies and NASA", Proc. IGARSS, Honolulu, USA, 2780–2782 8&lt;/ref&gt; In order to integrate remote sensing in a sustainable manner organizations like the [[European Geosciences Union|EGU]] or [[Digital Earth]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150910112227/http://www.digital-earth.eu/ Digital Earth]&lt;/ref&gt; encourage the development of [[E-learning|learning modules]] and [[Learning management system|learning portals]]. Examples include: ''FIS – Remote Sensing in School Lessons'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fis.uni-bonn.de/node/92 FIS – Remote Sensing in School Lessons]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Geospektiv'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geospektiv.de/ geospektiv]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ychange'',&lt;ref&gt; [https://ychange.eu/ YCHANGE]&lt;/ref&gt; or Spatial Discovery,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landmap.ac.uk Landmap – Spatial Discovery]&lt;/ref&gt; to promote media and method qualifications as well as independent learning.

== Software ==
{{main|Remote sensing software}}
Remote sensing data are processed and analyzed with computer software, known as a [[remote sensing application]]. A large number of proprietary and open source applications exist to process remote sensing data. Remote sensing software packages include:
* [[ERDAS IMAGINE]] from Hexagon Geospatial (Separated from [[Intergraph]] SG&amp;I),
* [[PCI Geomatica]]
* [[TNTmips]] from MicroImages,
* [[IDRISI]] from Clark Labs,
* [[eCognition]] from [[Trimble Navigation|Trimble]],
* and [[RemoteView]] made by [[Overwatch Textron Systems]].
* [[Dragon (remote sensing)|Dragon/ips]] is one of the oldest remote sensing packages still available, and is in some cases free.

Open source remote sensing software includes:
* [[Opticks (software)]],
* [[Orfeo toolbox]]
* Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) from the European Space Agency (ESA)
* Others mixing remote sensing and GIS capabilities are: [[GRASS GIS]], [[ILWIS]], [[QGIS]], and TerraLook.

According to an NOAA Sponsored Research by Global Marketing Insights, Inc. the most used applications among Asian academic groups involved in remote sensing are as follows: ERDAS 36% ([[ERDAS IMAGINE]] 25% &amp; ERMapper 11%); [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] 30%; ITT Visual Information Solutions ENVI 17%; [[MapInfo Professional|MapInfo]] 17%.

Among Western Academic respondents as follows: ESRI 39%, ERDAS IMAGINE 27%, MapInfo 9%, and [[AutoDesk]] 7%.

In education, those that want to go beyond simply looking at satellite images print-outs either use general remote sensing software (e.g. [[QGIS]]), [[Google Earth]], [https://storymaps.arcgis.com/ StoryMaps] or a software/ web-app developed specifically for education (e.g. desktop: [http://leoworks.terrasigna.com/ LeoWorks], online: [https://server2.blif.de/ BLIF]).

== Satellites ==

First Satellite UV/VIS observations simply showed pictures of the
Earth's surface and atmosphere. Such satellite images are still used,
for instance as input for numerical weather forecast. The first
spectroscopic UV/VIS observations started in 1970 on board of the US
research satellite [[Nimbus 4]]. These measurements (backscatter
ultraviolet, BUV, later also called Solar BUV, SBUV) operated in [[nadir]]
geometry, i.e., they measured the solar light reflected from the ground
or scattered from the atmosphere. Like for the Dobson instruments also
the BUV/SBUV instruments measure the intensity in different narrow
spectral intervals. The intention of these BUV/SBUV observations was to
determine information on the atmospheric O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; profile, since the
penetration depth into the atmosphere strongly depends on wavelength.
For example, the light at the shortest wavelengths has only 'seen' the
highest parts of the O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; layer whereas the longest wavelengths have seen
the total column. While in principle the BUV/SBUV measurements worked
well, they suffered from instrumental instabilities.

The big breakthrough in UV/VIS satellite remote sensing of the
atmosphere took place in 1979 with the launch the Total Ozone Mapping
Spectrometer (TOMS) on [[Nimbus 7]]. TOMS is similar to the BUV/SBUV
instrument but measures light at longer wavelengths. Thus it is only
sensitive to the total O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; column (instead of the
O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; profile). However, compared to the BUV/SBUV instruments
the TOMS instruments were much more stable. The TOMS instrument on board
of Nimbus 7 yielded the so far longest global data set on O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
(1979 - 1992). This period in particular includes the discovery of the
ozone hole. Several further TOMS instruments have been launched on other
satellites. Like the Dobson instruments on the ground they yield very
accurate O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; total column densities using a relatively simple
method. Besides events of very strong atmospheric SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
absorption and aerosols they are, however, only sensitive to
O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

Since April 1995 the first [[Differential optical absorption spectroscopy|DOAS]] instrument is operating from space. The
Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) was launched on the European
research satellite ERS-2. Like SBUV and TOMS also GOME is a nadir
viewing instrument; unlike its predecessor instruments it covers a large
spectral range (240 - 790 nm) at a total of 4096 wavelengths arranged in
four 'channels' with a spectral resolution between 0.2 and 0.4 nm. Its
normal ground pixel size in 320 x 40 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Global coverage is achieved
after three days. For O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; profile measurements the intensities
at short wavelengths are observed (BUV/SBUV instruments). For the
determination of the total atmospheric O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; column the
intensities at larger wavelengths are used (TOMS instruments). In
contrast to the limited spectral information of BUV/SBUV and TOMS
instruments, GOME spectra yield a surplus of spectral information. By
applying the DOAS method to these measurements it is thus possible to
retrieve a large variety of atmospheric trace gases, the majority of
which are very weak absorbers (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, BrO, OClO,
HCHO, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). In
addition also other quantities like aerosol absorptions, the ground
albedo or indices characterising the solar cycle can be analysed.
Because of the high sensitivity of GOME it is in particular possible to
measure various tropospheric trace gases (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, BrO, HCHO,
H2O, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). A further important advantage is that the GOME
spectra can be analysed with respect to a spectrum of direct sun light,
which contains no atmospheric absorptions. Therefore in contrast to
ground based DOAS measurements the DOAS analysis of GOME spectra yields
total atmospheric column densities rather than the difference between
two atmospheric spectra.

In March 2002 a second DOAS satellite instrument, the SCanning Imaging
Absorption SpectroMeter for Atmospheric ChartographY ([[SCIAMACHY]]) was
launched on board of the European research satellite [[Envisat]]. In
addition to GOME it measures over a wider wavelength range (240 nm -
2380) including also the absorption of several greenhouse gases (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,
CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and CO in the IR. It also operated in
additional viewing modes (nadir, limb, [[occultation]]), which allows to
derive stratospheric trace gas profiles. Another advantage is that the
ground pixel size for the nadir viewing mode was significantly reduced
to 30 x 60 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (in a special mode even to 15 x 30
km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Especially for the observation of tropospheric trace
gases this is very important because of the strong spatial gradients
occurring for such species. The first tropospheric results of SCIAMACHY
showed that it was now possible to identify pollution plumes of
individual cities or other big sources.

'''''Rhein II''''' is a photograph made by German visual artist [[Andreas Gursky]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; In the image, a river (the [[Lower Rhine]]) flows horizontally across the field of view, between flat green fields, under an overcast sky.&lt;ref name=time/&gt; Extraneous details such as dog walkers and a factory building were removed by the artist using digital editing.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

In 2011, a print was auctioned for [[USD|$]]4.3 million (then [[GBP|£]]2.7m), making it the [[list of most expensive photographs|most expensive photograph]] ever sold.

== Production ==
The photograph was produced as the second (and largest) of a set of six depicting the river [[Rhine]].&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; In the image, the [[Lower Rhine]] flows horizontally across the field of view, between flat green fields, under an overcast sky.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;

Extraneous details such as dog walkers and a factory building were removed by the artist using digital editing.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Justifying this manipulation of the image, Gursky said "Paradoxically, this view of the Rhine cannot be obtained in situ, a fictitious construction was required to provide an accurate image of a modern river."&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; Gursky produced a very large [[chromogenic]] colour print of the photograph, mounted it onto [[acrylic glass]], and then placed it in a frame.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; The image itself measures {{convert|73|x|143|in|cm}}, while the frame measures {{convert|81|x|151|in|cm}}.&lt;ref name=christies/&gt;

== Reception and sale ==
The print was originally acquired by the [[Galerie Monika Sprüth]] in [[Cologne]], and subsequently bought by an anonymous German collector.&lt;ref name=christies/&gt; The collector sold the print by auction at [[Christie's|Christie's New York]] on 8 November 2011, who estimated it would fetch a price of $2.5–3.5m.&lt;ref name=christies/&gt; It actually sold for $4,338,500&lt;ref name=christies/&gt; (then about £2.7m); the identity of the buyer has not been revealed.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

The work has been described by arts writer Florence Waters in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' as a "vibrant, beautiful and memorable – I should say unforgettable – contemporary twist on [...] the romantic landscape"&lt;ref name=waters/&gt; and by journalist [[Maev Kennedy]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' as "a sludgy image of the grey Rhine under grey skies".&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

[[File:Tsubakurodake from Otenshodake 2002-8-22.jpg|thumb|A mountain ridge in Japan]]
[[File:Bristol tenn ridgelines2.jpg|thumb|A stratigraphic ridge within the Appalachian Mountains.]]
[[File:The Table1.jpg|thumb|The edges of [[tuya]]s can form ridges.]]


A '''ridge''' or a '''mountain ridge'''  is a geological feature consisting of a chain of mountains or hills that form a continuous elevated crest for some distance. The sides of the ridge slope away from narrow top on either side.The line along the crest formed by the highest points, with the terrain dropping down on either side, is called the '''ridgeline'''. Ridges are usually termed [[hill]]s or [[mountain]]s as well, depending on size.

==Types==
There are several main types of ridges:

*[[Dendritic drainage|Dendritic]] ridge: In typical [[dissected plateau]] terrain, the stream drainage valleys will leave intervening ridges. These are by far the most common ridges. These ridges usually represent slightly more [[erosion]] resistant rock, but not always – they often remain because there were more [[Joint (geology)|joint]]s where the valleys formed or other chance occurrences.  This type of ridge is generally somewhat random in orientation, often changing direction frequently, often with knobs at intervals on the ridge top.
*Stratigraphic ridge: In places such as the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]], long, even, straight ridges are formed because they are the uneroded remaining edges of the more resistant [[Strike and dip|dipping]] [[stratum|strata]] that were [[Fold (geology)|folded]] laterally.  Similar ridges have formed in places such as the [[Black Hills]], where the ridges form concentric circles around the [[igneous]] core.  Sometimes these ridges are called "[[Hogback (geology)|hogback ridges]]".
*[[Mid ocean ridge|Oceanic spreading ridge]]: In [[tectonic]] spreading zones around the world, such as at the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], the volcanic activity forming new plate boundary forms volcanic ridges at the spreading zone.  [[Isostasy|Isostatic]] settling and erosion gradually reduces the elevations moving away from the zone.
*Crater ridges: Large [[meteorite]] strikes typically form large [[impact crater]]s bordered by circular ridges.
*Volcanic crater/caldera ridges: Large [[volcano]]es often leave behind a central [[volcanic crater|crater]]/[[caldera]] bordered by circular ridges.
*Fault ridges: [[Fault (geology)|Faults]] often form [[escarpment]]s.  Sometimes the tops of the escarpments form not plateaus but slope back so that the edges of the escarpments form ridges.
*Dune ridges: In areas of large-scale [[dune]] activity, certain types of dunes result in [[sand]] ridges.
*Moraines and eskers: [[Glacier|Glacial]] activity may leave ridges in the form of [[moraine]]s and [[esker]]s. An [[arête]] is a thin ridge of rock that is formed by glacial erosion.
*Volcanic subglacial ridges: Many [[subglacial volcano]]es create ridge-like formations when [[lava]] erupts through a thick [[glacier]] or [[ice sheet]].
*[[Shutter ridge]]s: A shutter ridge is a ridge which has moved along a fault line, blocking or diverting drainage. Typically, a shutter ridge creates a valley corresponding to the alignment of the fault that produces it.

'''SS ''Cotopaxi''''' was a [[tramp steamer]] named after the [[Cotopaxi]] stratovolcano. She vanished in December 1925, while en route from [[Charleston, South Carolina]], United States, to [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], with all hands.

==Description==
''Cotopaxi'' is a cargo ship of {{GRT|2351}}. She was built by the [[Great Lakes Engineering Works]], [[Ecorse, Michigan]],&lt;ref name=GLEW&gt;{{cite book|title=The Great Lakes Engineering Works. The Shipyard and its Vessels |publisher=Marine Historical Society of Detroit |location=Detroit |page=311 |url=http://www.mhsd.org/publications/GLEW/indexglew.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1918 for the Clinchfield Navigation Company.&lt;ref name=EP270326&gt;{{cite news |title=Ships and the Sea |newspaper=''Evening Post'' |issue=27 March 1926 |page=27 |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19260327.2.161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt;

''Cotopaxi'' was {{convert|253|ft|m}} long [[between perpendiculars]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|44|ft|m}}. Her steam engine could propel her at {{convert|9.5|kn}}.&lt;ref name=Ellis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ellisisland.org/shipping/Formatship.asp?shipid=4039 |title=Cotopaxi |publisher=Ellis Island |accessdate=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final voyage==
On 29 November 1925, ''Cotopaxi'' departed [[Charleston, South Carolina]], for [[Havana]], [[Cuba]],&lt;ref name=Times311225/&gt; under Captain W. J. Meyer.&lt;ref name=SN061225&gt;{{cite news |title=Cotopaxi Still Lost; Lighthouse Men Watch; No Word Since Tuesday |newspaper=The Sunday News |issue=6 December 1925 |page=1 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=M4hJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9gsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=cotopaxi&amp;pg=2089%2C167535}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was carrying a cargo of coal and a crew of 32.&lt;ref name=SN061225/&gt; On 1 December, ''Cotopaxi'' radioed a distress call,&lt;ref name=Times311225/&gt; reporting that the ship was listing and taking on water&lt;ref name=EP270326/&gt; during a tropical storm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&amp;dat=19251201&amp;id=DRtiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sXUNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2892,926927&amp;hl=en Lawrence Journal-World December 1, 1925 .p.1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=0klj8wIChNAC&amp;dat=19251208&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en The Spokesman-Review December 8, 1925 .p.2 "Think Ship Typhoon Wreck]&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was officially listed as overdue on 31 December.&lt;ref name=Times311225&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Mails and Shipping |day_of_week=Thursday |date=31 December 1925 |page_number=18 |issue=44157 |column=D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the last radio transmission indicating that the ship was about to sink, she has since been connected to the legend of the [[Bermuda Triangle]].&lt;ref name="Morton2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ray Morton|title=Close encounters of the third kind: the making of Steven Spielberg's classic film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B-ERraCGxkYC&amp;pg=PA311|accessdate=10 March 2011|date=1 November 2007|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=978-1-55783-710-3|pages=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel de Champlain''' ({{IPA-fr|samyɛl də ʃɑ̃plɛ̃|lang}} born '''Samuel Champlain'''; on August 13, 1567&lt;ref name="birth"&gt;[[#Fichier Origine|Fichier Origine]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note name="birth2"&gt;For a detailed analysis of his baptismal record, see [[#Ritch|Ritch]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The baptism act does not contain information about the age of Samuel, neither his birth date or his place of birth.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; December 25, 1635), known as "The Father of [[New France]]", was a French settler, navigator, cartographer, draftsman, soldier, explorer, geographer, ethnologist, diplomat, and chronicler. He made from 21-29 trips across the Atlantic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/canadian-history-biographies/samuel-de-champlain|title=Samuel de Champlain facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Samuel de Champlain|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and founded New France and [[Quebec City]] on July 3, 1608. He is important to [[Canadian history]] because he made the first accurate map of the coast and he helped found the settlements.

Born into a family of mariners, Champlain, while still a young boy, began exploring [[North America]] in 1603 under the guidance of [[François Gravé Du Pont]], his uncle.&lt;ref name="Davignon"&gt;[[#Davignon|d'Avignon (2008)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Vaugeois2008|Vaugeois (2008)]]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1604 to 1607, Champlain participated in the exploration and settlement of the first permanent European settlement north of Florida, [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port Royal]], [[Acadia]] (1605) as well as the first European settlement that would become [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], [[New Brunswick]] (1604). Then, in 1608, he established the French settlement that is now [[Quebec City, Canada]].&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Thanks to [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons|Pierre Dugua de Mons]], who fully financed—at a loss—the first years of both French settlements in North America (first [[Acadia]], then [[Quebec City|Quebec]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Champlain was the first European to explore and describe the [[Great Lakes]], and published maps of his journeys and accounts of what he learned from the natives and the [[Métis people (Canada)|French living among the Natives]]. He formed relationships with local [[Innu people|Montagnais]] and [[Innu]] and later with others farther west ([[Ottawa River]], [[Lake Nipissing]], or [[Georgian Bay]]), with [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] and with [[Wyandot people|Wendat]], and agreed to provide assistance in the [[Beaver Wars]] against the [[Iroquois]].

In 1620, [[Louis XIII of France]] ordered Champlain to cease exploration, return to Quebec, and devote himself to the administration of the country.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;According to [[#Trudel|Trudel (1979)]], Louis was 18 years old, an inexperienced minor (age of majority was 25), and Champlain was lieutenant to [[Henry II de Bourbon, prince de Condé|the Prince de Condé]], the viceroy of New France since 1612, who, as Trudel writes, "was liberated [from jail, where he been for 3 years] in October 1619, and yielded his rights as viceroy to [[Henri II de Montmorency]], admiral of France. The latter confirmed Champlain in his office [...]. On 7 May 1620, Louis XIII wrote to Champlain to enjoin him to maintain the country 'in obedience to me, making the people who are there live as closely in conformity with the laws of my kingdom as you can.' From that moment Champlain was to devote himself exclusively to the administration of the country; he was to undertake no further great voyages of discovery; his career as an explorer had ended."&lt;/ref&gt; In every way but formal title, Samuel ''de'' Champlain served as [[Governor of New France]], a title that may have been formally unavailable to him owing to his non-noble status.&lt;ref group=Note name="honorifics"&gt;Some say that the King of France made him his "''royal'' geographer", but it is unproven and may only come from [[Marc Lescarbot]] books: Champlain never used that title. The honorific "''de''" was only added to his name from 1610, when he was already well-known, right after his patron, King [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], was murdered. This usage by a non-noble was tolerated so that he would continue to gain access to the court during the long regency of [[Louis XIII of France|King Louis XIII]] (who was only eight years old at the death of his father). Champlain received the official title of "lieutenant" (adjunct representative) of whichever noble was designated as Viceroy of [[New France]], the first being [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons]]. From 1629 Champlain was named "commandant" under the authority of the King Minister, [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]]. It was Champlain's successor, [[Charles Jacques Huault de Montmagny]], who was the first to be formally named as the governor of New France, when he moved to Quebec City in 1636 and became the first noble to live there in that century.&lt;/ref&gt; He established trading companies that sent goods, primarily fur, to France, and oversaw the growth of New France in the [[St. Lawrence River]] valley until his death in 1635.

Champlain is memorialized as the "Father of New France" and "Father of [[Acadia]]", and many places, streets, and structures in northeastern North America bear his name, or have monuments established in his memory. The most notable of these is [[Lake Champlain]], which straddles the border between northern [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Vermont]], extending slightly across the border into [[Canada]]. In 1609 he led an expedition up the [[Richelieu River]] and explored a long, narrow lake situated between the [[Green Mountains]] of present-day [[Vermont]] and the [[Adirondack Mountains]] of present-day [[New York (state)|New York]]; he named the lake after himself as the first European to map and describe it.

==Birth year, location and family==

Champlain was born to Antoine Champlain (also written ''Anthoine Chappelain'' in some records) and Marguerite Le Roy, in either [[Hiers-Brouage]], or the port city of [[La Rochelle]], in the [[France|French]] province of [[Aunis]]. He was born on or before August 13, 1574, according to a recent baptism record&lt;!--if the record of a 1574 baptism is "recent", it is surely bogus; should this read "recently found"?--&gt; found by Jean-Marie Germe, French genealogist.&lt;ref name="birth" /&gt;&lt;ref group=Note name="birth2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Germe&gt;[[#Germe|Germe]], p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Although in 1870, the Canadian Catholic priest Laverdière, in the first chapter of his ''Œuvres de Champlain'', accepted Pierre-Damien Rainguet's&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rainguet1851|Rainguet (1851)]]&lt;/ref&gt; estimate and tried to justify it, his calculations were based on assumptions now believed, or proven, to be incorrect. Although Léopold Delayant (member, secretary, then president of ''l'Académie des belles-lettres, sciences et arts de La Rochelle'') wrote as early as 1867 that Rainguet's estimate was wrong, the books of Rainguet and Laverdière have had a significant influence. The 1567 date was carved on numerous monuments dedicated to Champlain and is widely regarded as accurate. In the first half of the 20th century, some authors disagreed, choosing 1570 or 1575 instead of 1567. In 1978 Jean Liebel published groundbreaking research about these estimates of Champlain's birth year and concluded, "Samuel Champlain was born about 1580 in Brouage, France."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Liebel1978|Liebel (1978)]], p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Liebel asserts that some authors, including the Catholic priests Rainguet and Laverdière, preferred years when Brouage was under Catholic control (which include 1567, 1570, and 1575).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Liebel1978|Liebel (1978)]], pp. 229–237.&lt;/ref&gt;
Champlain claimed to be from Brouage in the title of his 1603 book and to be ''Saintongeois'' in the title of his second book (1613). He belonged to either a [[Protestant]] family, or a tolerant [[Roman Catholic]] one, since Brouage was most of the time a Catholic city in a Protestant region, and his [[Old Testament]] first name ([[Samuel]]) was not usually given to Catholic children.&lt;ref group=Note name="Laberge"&gt;According to many modern historians, including Alain Laberge, the 2008 Chair of the History Department at [[Quebec City]]'s [[Laval University]], a specialist in the history of New France, Champlain could have been born a [[Protestant]]. A guest on the February 6, 2008 [[CBC Radio|CBC]] radio program, ''[[Sounds Like Canada]]'', Professor Laberge said that the fact of Champlain's Protestantism would have been downplayed or omitted from educational materials in Quebec by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], who controlled [[Quebec]]'s education system from 1627 until 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note name="Richelieu"&gt;However, Champlain was born in or near a time when the city was taken by Protestants, but Brouage became a royal fortress and its governor, from 1627 until his death in 1642, was [[Cardinal Richelieu]], a strong anti-Protestant.&lt;/ref&gt; The exact location of his birth is thus also not known with certainty, but at the time of his birth his parents were living in [[Hiers-Brouage|Brouage]].&lt;ref group=Note&gt;His family lived in Brouage at the time of his birth; the exact place and date of his birth are unknown.[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/105187/Samuel-de-Champlain Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ChamplianStoneDingleTowerHalifaxNovaScotia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sir Sandford Fleming Park]], [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] – Stone from Samuel de Champlain's birthplace in [[Brouage]], [[France]] (1574)]]
Born into a family of mariners (both his father and uncle-in-law were sailors, or navigators), Samuel Champlain learned to navigate, draw, make [[nautical chart]]s, and write practical reports. His education did not include [[Ancient Greek]] or [[Latin]], so he did not read or learn from any ancient literature. As each French fleet had to assure its own defense at sea, Champlain sought to learn to fight with the firearms of his time: he acquired this practical knowledge when serving with the army of [[Henry IV of France|King Henry IV]] during the later stages of [[French Wars of Religion|France's religious wars]] in [[Brittany]] from 1594 or 1595 to 1598, beginning as a quartermaster responsible for the feeding and care of horses. During this time he claimed to go on a "certain secret voyage" for the king,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; and saw combat (including maybe the [[Siege of Fort Crozon]], at the end of 1594).&lt;ref name=F65&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], p. 65 Note: Fischer cites numerous other authorities in repeating this.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1597 he was a "capitaine d'une compagnie" serving in a garrison near [[Quimper, Finistère|Quimper]].&lt;ref name="F65" /&gt;

==Early travels==
[[File:SamuelDeChamplainStatueILMVT.JPG|thumb|Champlain and guide&lt;ref&gt;[[#Weber1967|Weber (1967)]]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Isle La Motte, Vermont]], at the site Champlain is said to have first set foot in [[Vermont]] (and encamped) in 1609. [[Lake Champlain]] is in the background. &lt;small&gt;(Sculptor E.L.Weber, 1967; Photo by Matt Wills, 2009)&lt;/small&gt;]]

In 1598, his uncle-in-law, a navigator whose ship ''Saint-Julien'' was chartered to transport Spanish troops to [[Cádiz]] pursuant to the [[Treaty of Vervins]], gave Champlain the opportunity to accompany him. After a difficult passage, he spent some time in Cadiz before his uncle, whose ship was then chartered to accompany a large Spanish fleet to the [[West Indies]], again offered him a place on the ship. His uncle, who gave command of the ship to Jeronimo de Valaebrera, instructed the young Champlain to watch over the ship.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Litalien|Litalien (2004)]], p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; This journey lasted two years, and gave Champlain the opportunity to see or hear about Spanish holdings from the Caribbean to [[Mexico City]]. Along the way he took detailed notes, and wrote an illustrated report on what he learned on this trip, and gave this secret report to King Henry,&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Three different handwritten copies of this report still exist. One of them is at the [[John Carter Brown Library]] at [[Brown University]].&lt;/ref&gt; who rewarded Champlain with an annual pension. This report was published for the first time in 1870, by Laverdière, as ''Brief Discours des Choses plus remarquables que Sammuel Champlain de Brouage a reconneues aux Indes Occidentalles au voiage qu'il en a faict en icettes en l'année 1599 et en l'année 1601, comme ensuite'' (and in English as ''Narrative of a Voyage to the West Indies and Mexico 1599–1602''). The authenticity of this account as a work written by Champlain has frequently been questioned, due to inaccuracies and discrepancies with other sources on a number of points; however, recent scholarship indicates that the work probably was authored by Champlain.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;For a detailed treatment of claims against Champlain's authorship, see the chapter by François-Marc Gagnon in [[#Litalien|Litalien (2004)]], pp. 84ff. [[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 586ff, also addresses these claims, and accepts Champlain's authorship.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Champlain's return to Cadiz in August 1600, his uncle, who had fallen ill, asked him to look after his business affairs. This Champlain did, and when his uncle died in June 1601, Champlain inherited his substantial estate. It included an estate near [[La Rochelle]], commercial properties in Spain, and a 150-ton merchant ship.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 98–99&lt;/ref&gt; This inheritance, combined with the king's annual pension, gave the young explorer a great deal of independence, as he was not dependent on the financial backing of merchants and other investors.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; From 1601 to 1603 Champlain served as a geographer in the court of King Henry IV. As part of his duties he traveled to French ports and learned much about [[North America]] from the fishermen that seasonally traveled to coastal areas from [[Nantucket]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] to capitalize on the rich fishing grounds there. He also made a study of previous French failures at colonization in the area, including that of [[Pierre de Chauvin de Tonnetuit|Pierre de Chauvin]] at [[Tadoussac]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 100–117&lt;/ref&gt; When Chauvin forfeited his monopoly on fur trade in North America in 1602, responsibility for renewing the trade was given to [[Aymar de Chaste]]. Champlain approached de Chaste about a position on the first voyage, which he received with the king's assent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 121–123&lt;/ref&gt;

Champlain's first trip to North America was as an observer on a fur-trading expedition led by [[François Gravé Du Pont]]. Du Pont was a navigator and merchant who had been a ship's captain on Chauvin's expedition, and with whom Champlain established a firm lifelong friendship. He educated Champlain about navigation in North America, including the [[Saint Lawrence River]], and in dealing with the natives there (and in [[Acadia]] after).&lt;ref name="Davignon"/&gt; The ''Bonne-Renommée'' (the ''Good Fame'') arrived at Tadoussac on March 15, 1603. Champlain was anxious to see for himself all of the places that [[Jacques Cartier]] had seen and described about sixty years earlier, and wanted to go even further than Cartier, if possible. Champlain created a map of the Saint Lawrence on this trip and, after his return to France on September 20, published an account as ''Des Sauvages: ou voyage de Samuel Champlain, de Brouages, faite en la France nouvelle l'an 1603'' ("Concerning the Savages: or travels of Samuel Champlain of Brouages, made in [[New France]] in the year 1603").&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Champlain did not begin using the honorific ''de'' in his name until at least 1610, when he married, the year King Henry was murdered. A reprint of this book in 1612 was credited to "sieur ''de'' Champlain, [http://www.civilization.ca/vmnf/expos/champlain/oeuv_eng.html civilization.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; Included in his account were meetings with [[Begourat]], a chief of the [[Innu people|Montagnais]] at Tadoussac, in which positive relationships were established between the French and the many Montagnais gathered there, with some [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] friends.

Promising to King Henry to report on further discoveries, Champlain joined a second expedition to New France in the spring of 1604. This trip, once again an exploratory journey without women and children, lasted several years, and focused on areas south of the St. Lawrence River, in what later became known as [[Acadia]]. It was led by [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons|Pierre Dugua de Mons]], a noble and Protestant merchant who had been given a fur trading monopoly in New France by the king. Dugua asked Champlain to find a site for winter settlement. After exploring possible sites in the [[Bay of Fundy]], Champlain selected [[Saint Croix Island, New Brunswick|Saint Croix Island]] in the [[Saint Croix River (Maine – New Brunswick)|St. Croix River]] as the site of the expedition's first winter settlement. After enduring a harsh winter on the island the settlement was relocated across the bay where they established [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port Royal]]. Until 1607, Champlain used that site as his base, while he explored the Atlantic coast. Dugua was forced to leave the settlement for France in September 1605, because he learned that his monopoly was at risk. His monopoly was rescinded by the king in July 1607 under pressure from other merchants and proponents of free trade, leading to the abandonment of the settlement.

In 1605 and 1606, Champlain explored the North American coast as far south as [[Cape Cod]], searching for sites for a permanent settlement. Minor skirmishes with the resident [[Nauset]]s dissuaded him from the idea of establishing one near present-day [[Chatham, Massachusetts]]. He named the area Mallebar ("bad bar").&lt;ref&gt;[[#NPS|NPS]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="map"&gt;[[#VermontMap|Vermont Map]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding of Quebec City==

[[File:Samuel de Champlain arrive à Québec - George Agnew Reid - 1909.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[George Agnew Reid]], done for the third centennial (1908), showing the arrival of Samuel de Champlain on the site of [[Quebec City]].&lt;ref group=Note name="ships" /&gt;]]

In the spring of 1608, Dugua wanted Champlain to start a new French colony and fur trading center on the shores of the St. Lawrence. Dugua equipped, at his own expense, a fleet of three ships with workers, that left the French port of [[Honfleur]]. The main ship, called the [[Don de Dieu (ship)|''Don-de-Dieu'']] (French for the ''Gift of God''), was commanded by Champlain. Another ship, the ''Lévrier'' (the ''Hunt Dog''), was commanded by his friend Du Pont. The small group of male settlers arrived at [[Tadoussac, Quebec|Tadoussac]] on the lower St. Lawrence in June. Because of the dangerous strength of the [[Saguenay River]] ending there, they left the ships and continued up the "Big River" in small boats bringing the men and the materials.&lt;ref group=Note name="ships"&gt;Only at his last arrival (in 1633), Champlain did not leave the ships at Tadoussac but sailed them directly to Quebec City.[[#Trudel|Trudel (1979)]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

On July 3, 1608, Champlain landed at the "point of Quebec" and set about fortifying the area by the erection of three main wooden buildings, each two stories tall, that he collectively called the "[[Habitation de Québec|Habitation]]", with a wooden [[stockade]] and a moat {{convert|12|ft|m|0}} wide surrounding them. This was the very beginning of [[Quebec City]]. Gardening, exploring, and fortifying this place became great passions of Champlain for the rest of his life.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

In the 1620s, the ''Habitation'' at Quebec was mainly a store for the ''Compagnie des Marchands'' (Traders Company), and Champlain lived in the wooden ''Fort Saint Louis'' newly built up the hill (south from the present-day ''Château Frontenac'' Hotel), near the only two houses built by the two settler families (the ones of [[Louis Hébert]] and Guillaume Couillard, his son-in-law).{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

==Murder of the King==
In May 1610, [[King Henry IV of France|King Henry]] was assassinated in Paris by a [[François Ravaillac|Catholic fanatic]], and rule fell to his wife, [[Marie de' Medici]], as [[regent]] for the nine-year-old [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]. Marie was a staunch Catholic with little interest in New France, and many of Champlain's Protestant financial supporters, including Pierre Dugua de Mons, were denied access to court. Champlain, on hearing the news, returned to France in September 1610 to establish new political connections in support of efforts at colonization.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 282–285&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
One route Champlain may have chosen to improve his access to the court of the regent was his decision to enter into marriage with the twelve-year-old [[Helene Boullé|Hélène Boullé]]. She was the daughter of Nicolas Boullé, a man charged with carrying out royal decisions at court. The marriage contract was signed on December 27, 1610 in presence of Dugua, who had dealt with the father, and the couple was married three days later. The terms of the contract called for the marriage to be consummated two years later.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 287–288&lt;/ref&gt; Champlain sought permission from her parents to consummate the marriage before that: "Many of those who entered into such relationships, such as Samuel de Champlain (d. 1635), the first governor of French Canada, agreed that they would not have sex with a 12-year-old bride until she was 14, as Champlain did unless he consulted with her family and received their permission to do so earlier. Apparently, he did."&lt;ref name="Bullough on Champlain"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bullough|first1=V.L.|title=Peer Commentaries on Green (2002) and Schmidt (2002): Pedophilia and Sexual Harassment: Do They Have Similarities?|date=202|pages=481|edition=Archives of Sexual Behavior, 31 (6)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Champlain's marriage was initially quite troubled, as Hélène rallied against joining him in August 1613. Their relationship, while it apparently lacked any physical connection, recovered and was apparently good for many years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 313–316&lt;/ref&gt; Hélène lived in Quebec for several years,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 374–5&lt;/ref&gt; but returned to Paris and eventually decided to enter a convent. The couple had no children, although Champlain did adopt three Montagnais girls named Faith, Hope, and Charity in the winter of 1627–28.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 399–400&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations and war with First Nations peoples==
[[File:DefeatOfIroquoisByChamplain.jpeg|thumb|left|Engraving based on a drawing by Champlain of his 1609 voyage. It depicts a battle between [[Iroquois]] and [[Algonquian people|Algonquian]] tribes near Lake Champlain]]

During the summer of 1609, Champlain attempted to form better relations with the local [[First Nations|native tribes]]. He made alliances with the [[Wyandot people|Wendat]] (derogatorily called ''Huron'' by the French) and with the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]], the [[Innu people|Montagnais]] and the Etchemin, who lived in the area of the [[St. Lawrence River]]. These tribes demanded that Champlain help them in their war against the [[Haudenosaunee|Iroquois]], who lived farther south. Champlain set off with nine French soldiers and 300 natives to explore the ''Rivière des Iroquois'' (now known as the [[Richelieu River]]), and became the first European to map [[Lake Champlain]]. Having had no encounters with the Haudenosaunee at this point many of the men headed back, leaving Champlain with only 2 Frenchmen and 60 natives.

On July 29, somewhere in the area near [[Ticonderoga, New York|Ticonderoga]] and [[Crown Point, New York]] (historians are not sure which of these two places, but [[Fort Ticonderoga]] historians claim that it occurred near its site), Champlain and his party encountered a group of Haudenosaunee. In a battle begun the next day, two hundred and fifty Haudenosaunee advanced on Champlain's position, and one of his guides pointed out the three chiefs. In his account of the battle, Champlain recounts firing his [[arquebus]] and killing two of them with a single shot, after which one of his men killed the third. The Haudenosaunee turned and fled. This action set the tone for [[Beaver Wars|poor French-Iroquois relations]] for the rest of the century.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;In 1701, [[Great Peace of Montreal|The Great Peace Treaty]] was signed in Montreal, involving the French and every Indigenous nation coming or living on the shores of the Saint Lawrence River except maybe in wintertime.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Battle of Sorel]] occurred on June 19, 1610, with Samuel de Champlain supported by the [[Kingdom of France]] and his allies, the [[Wyandot people|Wendat people]], [[Algonquin people]] and [[Innu people]] against the [[Mohawk people]] in [[New France]] at present-day [[Sorel-Tracy]], [[Quebec]]. The forces of Champlain armed with the [[arquebus]] engaged and slaughtered or captured nearly all of the Mohawks.  The battle ended major hostilities with the Mohawks for twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 577–578&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exploration of New France==
[[File:Baie des Chaleurs 1612.PNG|thumb|''[[Chaleur Bay]]'' and [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] — extract of Champlain 1612 map]]

On March 29, 1613, arriving back in New France, he first ensured that his new royal commission be [[proclamation|proclaimed]]. Champlain set out on May 27 to continue his exploration of the Huron country and in hopes of finding the "northern sea" he had heard about (probably [[Hudson Bay]]). He traveled the [[Ottawa River]], later giving the first description of this area.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;In 1953, a rock was found at a location now known as the [[Storyland (Ontario)|Champlain lookout]], which bore the inscription "Champlain juin 2, 1613". What about this finding?&lt;/ref&gt; Along the way, he apparently dropped or left behind a cache of silver cups, copper kettles, and a brass astrolabe dated 1603 [https://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/vmnf/champlain/expl5_en.shtml (Champlain's Astrolabe)], which was later found by a farm boy named Edward Lee near [[Cobden, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brebner |first1=John Bartlett |title=The Explorers of North America, 1492-1806 |date=1966 |publisher=The World Publishing Company |location=Cleveland, Ohio |page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in June that he met with [[Tessouat]], the Algonquin chief of [[L'Isle-aux-Allumettes, Quebec|Allumettes Island]], and offered to build the tribe a fort if they were to move from the area they occupied, with its poor soil, to the locality of the Lachine Rapids.&lt;ref name="map" /&gt;

By August 26, Champlain was back in [[Saint-Malo]]. There, he wrote an account of his life from 1604 to 1612 and his journey up the Ottawa river, his ''Voyages''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Champlain1613|Champlain (1613)]]&lt;/ref&gt; and published another map of New France. In 1614, he formed the "Compagnie des Marchands de Rouen et de Saint-Malo" and "Compagnie de Champlain", which bound the Rouen and Saint-Malo merchants for eleven years. He returned to New France in the spring of 1615 with four [[Recollects]] in order to further religious life in the new colony. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] was eventually given ''[[Seigneurial system of New France|en seigneurie]]'' large and valuable tracts of land, estimated at nearly 30% of all the lands granted by the [[King of France|French Crown]] in [[New France]].&lt;ref name="roydalton"&gt;[[#Dalton|Dalton (1968)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Champlain continued to work to improve relations with the natives, promising to help them in their struggles against the Iroquois. With his native guides, he explored further up the [[Ottawa River]] and reached [[Lake Nipissing]]. He then followed the [[French River (Ontario)|French River]] until he reached the freshwater sea he called Lac Attigouautau (now [[Lake Huron]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In 1615, Champlain was escorted through the area that is now [[Peterborough, Ontario]] by a group of Wendat. He used the ancient portage between [[Chemong Lake]] and [[Little Lake (Peterborough)|Little Lake]] (now Chemong Road) and stayed for a short period of time near what is now Bridgenorth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepeterboroughexaminer.com/2015/09/08/a-small-man-with-a-big-gun-not-everyone-in-the-peterborough-area-celebrates-the-anniversary-of-champlains-arrival-first-of-a-two-part-guest-column|title=A small man with a big gun|last=Williams|first=Doug|work=Peterborough Examiner|language=en-CA|date=September 8, 2015|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military expedition==
[[File:Champlain statue, Nepean Point, Ottawa.jpg|thumb|Samuel de Champlain, [[Nepean Point]], [[Ottawa]] by [[Hamilton MacCarthy]]]]
On September 1, 1615, at Cahiagué (a Wendat community on what is now called [[Lake Simcoe]]), he and the northern tribes started a military expedition against the Iroquois. The party passed [[Lake Ontario]] at its eastern tip where they hid their canoes and continued their journey by land. They followed the [[Oneida River]] until they arrived at the main Onondaga fort on October 10. The exact location of this place is still a matter of debate. Although the traditional location, Nichols Pond, is regularly disproved by professional and amateur archaeologists, many still claim that Nichols Pond is the location of the battle. {{convert|10|mi|km}} south of [[Canastota, New York]].&lt;ref name="Weiskotten, 1998"&gt;[[#Weiskotten1998|Weiskotten (1998)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Champlain attacked the stockaded Oneida village. He was accompanied by 10 Frenchmen and 300  Wendat. Pressured by the Huron Wendat to attack prematurely, the assault failed. Champlain was wounded twice in the leg by arrows, one in his knee. The conflict ended on October 16 when the French Wendat were forced to flee.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Although he did not want to, the Wendat insisted that Champlain spend the winter with them. During his stay, he set off with them in their great deer hunt, during which he became lost and was forced to wander for three days living off game and sleeping under trees until he met up with a band of First Nations people by chance. He spent the rest of the winter learning "their country, their manners, customs, modes of life". On May 22, 1616, he left the Wendat country and returned to Quebec before heading back to France on July 2.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Improving administration in New France==
[[File:Samuel de Champlain Carte geographique de la Nouvelle France.jpg|thumb|Map of [[New France]] (Champlain, 1612). A more precise map was drawn by Champlain in 1632.]]
[[File:Samuel de Champlain by Ronjat.jpg|thumb|right|250px|19th century artist's conception of Champlain by E. Ronjat.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Guizot|Guizot]], p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Champlain returned to New France in 1620 and was to spend the rest of his life focusing on administration of the territory rather than exploration. Champlain spent the winter building Fort Saint-Louis on top of Cape Diamond. By mid-May, he learned that the fur trading monopoly had been handed over to another company led by the Caen brothers. After some tense negotiations, it was decided to merge the two companies under the direction of the Caens. Champlain continued to work on relations with the natives and managed to impose on them a chief of his choice. He also negotiated a peace treaty with the Iroquois.

Champlain continued to work on the fortifications of what became Quebec City, laying the first stone on May 6, 1624. On August 15 he once again returned to France where he was encouraged to continue his work as well as to continue looking for a passage to China, something widely believed to exist at the time. By July 5 he was back at Quebec and continued expanding the city.

In 1627 the Caen brothers' company lost its monopoly on the fur trade, and [[Cardinal Richelieu]] (who had joined the Royal Council in 1624 and rose rapidly to a position of dominance in French politics that he would hold until his death in 1642) formed the [[Compagnie des Cent-Associés]] (the Hundred Associates) to manage the fur trade. Champlain was one of the 100 investors, and its first fleet, loaded with colonists and supplies, set sail in April 1628.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 404–410&lt;/ref&gt;

Champlain had overwintered in Quebec. Supplies were low, and English merchants pillaged [[Cap Tourmente]] in early July 1628.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 410–412&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anglo-French War (1627–1629)|A war]] had broken out between France and England, and [[Charles I of England]] had issued [[letters of marque]] that authorized the capture of French shipping and its colonies in North America.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], p. 409&lt;/ref&gt; Champlain received a summons to surrender on July 10 from some heavily armed, English based Scottish merchants, the [[David Kirke|Kirke brothers]]. Champlain refused to deal with them, misleading them to believe that Quebec's defenses were better than they actually were (Champlain had only 50 pounds of gunpowder to defend the community). Successfully bluffed, they withdrew, but encountered and captured the French supply fleet, cutting off that year's supplies to the colony.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 412–415&lt;/ref&gt; By the spring of 1629 supplies were dangerously low and Champlain was forced to send people to [[Gaspé Peninsula|Gaspé]] and into Indian communities to conserve rations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 418–420&lt;/ref&gt; On July 19, the Kirke brothers arrived before Quebec after intercepting Champlain's plea for help, and Champlain was forced to surrender the colony.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], p. 421&lt;/ref&gt; Many colonists were taken first to England and then to France by the Kirkes, but Champlain remained in London to begin the process of regaining the colony. A [[Treaty of Susa|peace treaty had been signed]] in April 1629, three months before the surrender, and, under the terms of that treaty, Quebec and other prizes were taken by the Kirkes after the treaty was supposed to be returned.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], p. 428&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1632)|1632 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] that Quebec was formally given back to France. (David Kirke was rewarded when Charles I knighted him and gave him a charter for [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].) Champlain reclaimed his role as commander of New France on behalf of Richelieu on March 1, 1633, having served in the intervening years as commander in New France "in the absence of my Lord the [[Armand Jean du Plessis, Cardinal Richelieu|Cardinal de Richelieu]]" from 1629 to 1635.&lt;ref name="Trudel"&gt;[[#Trudel|Trudel (1979)]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1632 Champlain published ''Voyages de la Nouvelle France'', which was dedicated to Cardinal Richelieu, and ''Traitté de la marine et du devoir d'un bon marinier'', a treatise on leadership, seamanship, and navigation. (Champlain made more than twenty-five round-trip crossings of the Atlantic in his lifetime, without losing a single ship.)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], p. 447&lt;/ref&gt;

==Last return, and last years working in Quebec==
Champlain returned to Quebec on May 22, 1633, after an absence of four years. Richelieu gave him a commission as [[Lieutenant General of New France]], along with other titles and responsibilities, but not that of [[Governor of New France|Governor]]. Despite this lack of formal status, many colonists, French merchants, and Indians treated him as if he had the title; writings survive in which he is referred to as "our governor".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 445–446&lt;/ref&gt; On August 18, 1634, he sent a report to Richelieu stating that he had rebuilt on the ruins of Quebec, enlarged its fortifications, and established two more habitations. One was 15 leagues upstream, and the other was at [[Trois-Rivières]]. He also began [[French and Iroquois Wars|an offensive]] against the Iroquois, reporting that he wanted them either wiped out or "brought to reason".{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Death and burial==
Champlain had a severe [[stroke]] in October 1635, and died on December 25, leaving no immediate heirs. [[Jesuit]] records state he died in the care of his friend and confessor [[Charles Lallemant]].{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

Although his will (drafted in November 17, 1635) gave much of his French property to his wife Hélène, he made significant bequests to the Catholic missions and to individuals in the colony of Quebec. However, Marie Camaret, a cousin on his mother's side, challenged the will in Paris and had it successfully overturned. It is unclear exactly what happened to his estate.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], p. 520&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidenreich|Heidenreich]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Le Blant1964|Le Blant (1964)]], pp 425–437&lt;/ref&gt;

Samuel de Champlain was temporarily buried in the church while a standalone chapel was built to hold his remains in the upper part of the city. Unfortunately, this small building, along with many others, was destroyed by a large fire in 1640. Though immediately rebuilt, no traces of it exist anymore: his exact burial site is still unknown, despite much research since about 1850, including several archaeological digs in the city. There is general agreement that the previous Champlain chapel site, and the remains of Champlain, should be somewhere near the [[Notre-Dame de Québec Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Travels|Champlain: Travels in the Canadian Francophonie]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#La Chapelle|La Chappelle]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The search for Champlain's remains supplies a key plot-line in the crime writer [[Louise Penny]]'s 2010 novel, ''Bury Your Dead''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Penny|Penny (2010)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials==

==Introduction==

Generally, [[spatial development]] is linked to include all the techniques used by planners, geographers and other actors of decision making to facilitate integrated balanced development. Spatial planning for development has no territorial barrier, ranging across continents, regions, nations and local communities. Various forms of spatial development qualities have been attributed mainly by the [[Developed World]], while the [[Developing World]] and [[Cameroon]] in particular, are still trying to integrate the formula into their system. As such, to understand better spatial development in Cameroon, a brief notion of the African context is necessary.

== Summary of Spatial Development in the Africa context==

Today, programmes that promotes spatial equity in national development are being given increased attention by international agencies and governments of developing nations, including Cameroon. Industrial expansion within the metropolitan centres is now given the same priority as agricultural policies. However, the inability to build a productive spatial system that integrates urban centres and rural hinterlands into mutual networks of production and exchange has led to a growing number of poor people in the developing nations.

One of the greatest challenges facing [[Africa]] today is to upgrade  [[sustainable development]] in areas where poverty and other economic problems are pronounced. The issue of environmental development needs to be enforced, especially as the world is today speaking the environmental language. It might be surprising to note that, only a few countries in Africa have concrete spatial development plans, most of them situated in the extreme South and North of the continent. Good examples are seen in the Republic of South Africa where there is a  development plan at the national level called Spatial Development Initiative (SDI), presently known as, the National Spatial Development Perspective (NSDP). The main aim of these plans is to encourage integrated development within a given space defined by its economic potential rather than by political boundaries. Most of the present day spatial development policies in African countries are linked to their colonial history. That is, development plans mainly in the form of transport and infrastructure were focused along the coast and other sources of raw materials in the hinterlands. This is one of the reasons for spatial inequality in most African countries. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new approaches of spatial development to obtain equity in enhancement.

==Cameroon and Spatial Development==

===History===
Spatial development in [[Cameroon]] dates as far back as the German colonial era. The influence of the Germans through trade and commerce, created a number of trading ports which later became townships. Development plans were purely aimed at export and recruiting areas for soldiers and labourers. Townships whose growth and development could be attributed to this include amongst others, Buea, Kumba, Bamenda, Yaoundé and Douala. Apart from the above policies, the Germans used zoning and racial residential segregation as instruments of land use in the country.

Like the Germans, when the British took over the Western part of Cameroon, they spent no time in establishing growth and development of settlements. Most of the government buildings were on hill tops, overlooking the remote indigenous settlements. Good examples are the GRAs (Government Residential Areas) in Limbe and Buea, and the hilltop station buildings in Bamenda, meant for high class residential only.

History of Cameroon has made it understandable that Cameroon’s experience in spatial planning began in 1966 and span up to 1976 with the introduction of the first and second Five Year Social and Economic Development Plans. The objective was to equitably share the economic resources and fruits of economic progress. The 1961 constitutions placed the spatial planning machinery exclusively into the hands of the Presidency and the National Assembly. In his capacity as the Chief of State of the United Republic of Cameroon, the President had to define the main lines of planning in a Presidential Circular and takes the major decision. On its part, the National Assembly debates and votes on laws to approve the plans.

Planning at the national level was carried out by the Ministry of Planning and Territorial Development. Together with its various departments the ministry was responsible for planning medium and long term development. At the provincial level,the Economic service collected, centralised and handed data to the Governor and the Minister and also organised social development plans at the Provincial Planning Board. At the Divisional level, the Divisional Development Committee was chaired by the Prefect and comprised Mayors, Deputies and private individuals.

===Present Situation===

Recent spatial planning and development policies in Cameroon are a legacy of its colonial history. Most of the land use plans initiated by the colonial masters have been maintained and strengthened by the country’s planning authorities. This has greatly increased the developmental gap between the colonial townships that are presently urban towns and the rural areas.

Cameroon cannot boast of a real National Spatial Development Plan. Most of the documents emphasising spatial development exist at the regional and local levels but are faced by problems of implementation. The country has a fashionable ‘integrated’, ‘basic need-oriented’, ‘bottom-up’ and ‘development-from-within’ regional policy programmes. In discussing such a programme and proposing elements of a modified development strategy, it can, however, be argued that even the first step of creating a basic regional development project has been far from satisfactory.  Furthermore, in spite of government public speaking, no regional development policy as normally defined exists. What do exist are regional effects of development projects. This prompts the question of whether it may be preferable to replace the term ‘regional development policy’, with regional ‘project policy’.

Since its formation on 1 October 1949 the [[China|People's Republic of China]]'s territorial claims have frequently been revised.

Until 1986, the total territory (or under control) of P.R.China was 10.45 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, including{{Cref|a}}:
* Continental mainland: ~9.40 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* [[Island]]s and [[reef]]s: ~75,400&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* Coastal [[beach]]es and shoaly lands: ~12,700&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 
* Inner sea (mainly [[Bohai Sea]]): ~693,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* [[Territorial waters|Territorial (sea only) waters]]: ~220,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

During the 1990s and 2000s, the official size and value of China's territory is rarely officially declared or published, partly because of the frequent and ongoing changes in their territorial claims.

The [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] government (on Taiwan) does not recognize the PRC's territorial changes in accordance with the [[Constitution of the Republic of China|1947 constitution]] (although amended in 1991 to include the [[Free area of the Republic of China|ROC's free area]]).

[[Image:DSCN1739-thomson-tide-machine.jpg|thumb|10-component tide-predicting machine of 1872-3, conceived by Sir William Thomson ([[Lord Kelvin]]), and designed by Thomson and collaborators, at the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]], South Kensington, London]]
A '''tide-predicting machine''' was a special-purpose mechanical [[analog computer]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, constructed and set up to predict the ebb and flow of sea tides and the irregular variations in their heights &amp;ndash; which change in mixtures of rhythms, that never (in the aggregate) repeat themselves exactly.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#refAMS-22|American Mathematical Society (2009) II.2]], showing how combinations of waves in non-commensurable frequencies cannot repeat their resultant patterns exactly.&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose was to shorten the laborious and error-prone computations of tide-prediction. Such machines usually provided predictions valid from hour to hour and day to day for a year or more ahead.

The first tide-predicting machine, designed and built in 1872-3, and followed by two larger machines on similar principles in 1876 and 1879, was conceived by Sir William Thomson (who later became [[Lord Kelvin]]). Thomson had introduced the method of [[Theory of tides#Harmonic analysis|harmonic analysis]] of tidal patterns in the 1860s and the first machine was designed by Thomson with the collaboration of Edward Roberts (assistant at the UK [[HM Nautical Almanac Office]]), and of Alexander Légé, who constructed it.&lt;ref&gt;The [[#refprocice|''Proceedings'' of the Inst.C.E. (1881)]] contains minutes of a somewhat disputatious discussion that took place in 1881 over who had contributed what details. Thomson acknowledged previous work of the 1840s relating to the general mechanical solution of equations, plus a specific suggestion he had from [[Beauchamp Tower]] to use a device of pulleys and a chain once used by [[Charles Wheatstone|Wheatstone]]; Thomson also credited Roberts with calculating the astronomical ratios embodied in the machine, and Légé with design of the drive gear details; Roberts claimed further credit for selecting other parts of the mechanical design.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1107|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, another tide-predicting machine on a different pattern (shown right) was designed by [[William Ferrel]] and built in 1881-2.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refferr1883|Ferrel (1883)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Developments and improvements continued in the UK, US and Germany through the first half of the 20th century.  The machines became widely used for constructing official tidal predictions for general marine navigation. They came to be regarded as of military strategic importance during [[World War I]],&lt;ref&gt;During World War I, Germany built its first tide-predicting machine in 1915-16 when it could no longer obtain British hydrographic data (see [[#reftpmde|Deutsches Museum exhibit, online]]), and when it specially needed accurate and independently-sourced tide data for conducting the [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|U-boat campaign]] (see [[#refdsm|German Maritime Museum exhibit, online]]).&lt;/ref&gt; and again during the [[World War II|Second World War]], when the US No.2 Tide Predicting Machine, described below, was [[Classified information|classified]], along with the data that it produced, and used to predict tides for the D-day [[Normandy landings]] and all the island landings in the [[Pacific war]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[#refobb|Ehret (2008)]] at page 44).&lt;/ref&gt; Military interest in such machines continued even for some time afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;During the '[[cold war]]', East Germany built its own tide-predicting machine in 1953-5 "at unbelievable expense", see [[#refdsm|German Maritime Museum (online exhibit)]].&lt;/ref&gt; They were made obsolete by digital electronic computers that can be programmed to carry out similar computations, but the tide-predicting machines continued in use until the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;The US No.2 machine was retired in the 1960s, see [[#refobb|Ehret (2008)]]; the machine used in Norway continued in use until the 1970s (see [[#refnortpm|Norway online exhibit]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Several examples of tide-predicting machines remain [[#Tide predicting machines on display|on display]] as museum pieces, occasionally put into operation for demonstration purposes, monuments to the mathematical and mechanical ingenuity of their creators.

==Background to the problem solved by the machines==

&lt;!-- see/reuse Tides#History of tidal physics --&gt;[[Image:099-ferreltpm.jpg|thumb|William Ferrel's tide-predicting machine of 1881-2, now at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History]]
Modern scientific study of tides dates back to Isaac Newton's 'Principia' of 1687, in which he applied the theory of gravitation to make a first approximation of the effects of the Moon and Sun on the Earth's tidal waters.  The approximation developed by Newton and his successors of the next 90 years is known as the 'equilibrium theory' of tides.

Beginning in the 1770s, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] made a fundamental advance on the equilibrium approximation by bringing into consideration non-equilibrium dynamical aspects of the motion of tidal waters that occurs in response to the tide-generating forces due to the Moon and Sun.

Laplace's improvements in theory were substantial, but they still left prediction in an approximate state.  This position changed in the 1860s when the local circumstances of tidal phenomena were more fully brought into account by [[Lord Kelvin|William Thomson]]'s application of [[Fourier analysis]] to the tidal motions. Thomson's work in this field was then further developed and extended by [[George Darwin]]: Darwin's work was based on the [[lunar theory]] current in his time.  His symbols for the tidal harmonic constituents are still used.  Darwin's harmonic developments of the tide-generating forces were later brought by [[Arthur Thomas Doodson|A. T. Doodson]] up to date and extended in light of the new and more accurate lunar theory of [[Ernest William Brown|E. W. Brown]] that remained current through most of the twentieth century.

The state to which the science of tide-prediction had arrived by the 1870s can be summarized:  Astronomical theories of the Moon and Sun had identified the frequencies and strengths of different components of the tide-generating force.  But effective prediction at any given place called for measurement of an adequate sample of local tidal observations, to show the local tidal response at those different frequencies, in amplitude and phase.  Those observations had then to be analyzed, to derive the coefficients and phase angles.  Then, for purposes of prediction, those local tidal constants had to be recombined, each with a different component of the tide-generating forces to which it applied, and at each of a sequence of future dates and times, and then the different elements finally collected together to obtain their aggregate effects.  In the age when calculations were done by hand and brain, with pencil and paper and tables, this was recognized as an immensely laborious and error-prone undertaking.

Thomson recognized that what was needed was a convenient and preferably automated way to evaluate repeatedly the sum of tidal terms such as:

:&lt;math&gt;A_1 \cos(\omega_1 t+\phi_1)+A_2 \cos(\omega_2 t+\phi_2)+A_3 \cos(\omega_3 t+\phi_3)+\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

containing 10, 20 or even more trigonometrical terms, so that the computation could conveniently be repeated in full for each of a very large number of different chosen values of the date/time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.  This was the core of the problem solved by the tide-predicting machines.

==How they worked to predict the tides==

Thomson conceived his aim as to construct a mechanism that would evaluate this trigonometrical sum physically, e.g. as the vertical position of a pen that could then plot a curve on a moving band of paper.

[[Image:099-tmpshaft.jpg|thumb|right|200px|mechanism for generating sinusoidal motion component]]
There were several mechanisms available to him for converting rotary motion into sinusoidal motion.  One of them is shown in the schematic (right).  A rotating drive-wheel is fitted with an off-center peg.  A shaft with a horizontally-slotted section is free to move vertically up and down.  The wheel's off-center peg is located in the slot.  As a result, when the peg moves around with the wheel, it can make the shaft move up and down within limits.  This arrangement shows that when the drive-wheel rotates uniformly, say clockwise, the shaft moves sinusoidally up and down.  The vertical position of the center of the slot, at any time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, can then be expressed as
&lt;math&gt;A_1 \cos(\omega_1 t+\phi_1)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; is the radial distance from the wheel's center to the peg, &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; is the rate at which the wheel turns (in [[radian]]s per unit of time), and &lt;math&gt;\phi_1&lt;/math&gt; is the starting phase angle of the peg, measured in radians from the 12 o'clock position to the angular position where the peg was at time zero.

This arrangement makes a physical analog of just one trigonometrical term.  Thomson needed to construct a physical sum of many such terms.

At first he inclined to use gears.  Then he discussed the problem with engineer [[Beauchamp Tower]] before the British Association meeting in 1872, and Tower suggested the use of a device that (as he remembered) was once used by [[Charles Wheatstone|Wheatstone]]. It was a chain running alternately over and under a sequence of pulleys on movable shafts.  The chain was fixed at one end, and the other (free) end was weighted to keep it taut. As each shaft moved up or down it would take up or release a corresponding length of the chain. The movements in position of the free (movable) end of the chain represented the sum of the movements of the different shafts.  The movable end was kept taut, and fitted with a pen and a moving band of paper on which the pen plotted a tidal curve.  In some designs, the movable end of the line was connected instead to a dial and scale from which tidal heights could be read off.

[[Image:099-tpm3-sk.jpg|thumb|Thomson's design for the third tide-predicting machine, 1879-81]]
One of Thomson's designs for the calculating part of a tide-predicting machine is shown in the figure (right), closely similar to the third machine of 1879-81. A long cord, with one end held fixed, passed vertically upwards and over a first upper pulley, then vertically downwards and under the next, and so on. These pulleys were all moved up and down by cranks, and each pulley took in or let out cord according to the direction in which it moved. These cranks were all moved by trains of wheels gearing into the wheels fixed on a drive shaft. The greatest number of teeth on any wheel was 802 engaging with another of 423. All the other wheels had comparatively small numbers of teeth. A flywheel of great inertia enabled the operator to turn the machine fast, without jerking the pulleys, and so to run off a year's curve in about twenty-five minutes. The machine shown in the figure was arranged for fifteen constituents in all.

Thomson acknowledged that the use of an over-and-under arrangement of the flexible line that summed the motion components was suggested to him in August 1872 by engineer [[Beauchamp Tower]].&lt;ref&gt;Beauchamp Tower was initially referred to in Thomson's acknowledgements only as 'Mr Tower', but he was more fully identified in discussion between Thomson and E Roberts at the Institution of Civil Engineers (reported in the ICE minutes in the [[#refprocice|''Proceedings'', 1881]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online demonstration of the mechanism==

An online demonstration is available to show the principle of operation of a 7-component version of a tide-predicting machine otherwise like Thomson's (Kelvin's) original design.&lt;ref&gt;See American Mathematical Society/[[Bill Casselman (mathematician)|Bill Casselman]] (2009), [http://www.ams.org/featurecolumn/archive/tidesIII3.html animated JAVA simulation based on Kelvin's Tide Predicting Machine] (the animation shows computing 7 harmonic components).&lt;/ref&gt; The animation shows part of the operation of the machine:  the motions of several pulleys can be seen, each moving up and down to simulate one of the tidal frequencies;  and the animation also shows how these sinusoidal motions were generated by wheel rotations and how they were combined to form the resulting tidal curve.  Not shown in the animation is the way in which the individual motions were generated in the machine at the correct relative frequencies, by gearing in the correct ratios, or how the amplitudes and starting phase angles for each motion were set in an adjustable way. These amplitudes and starting phase angles represented the local tidal constants, separately reset, and different for each place for which predictions were to be made.  Also, in the real Thomson machines, to save on motion and wear of the other parts, the shaft and pulley with the largest expected motion (for the M2 tide component at twice per lunar day) was mounted nearest to the pen, and the shaft and pulley representing the smallest component was at the other end, nearest to the point of fixing of the flexible cord or chain, to minimize unnecessary motion in the most part of the flexible cord.

==History of their building and use==

===The first tide-predicting machines 1872-1883===

The first tide predicting machine, designed in 1872 and of which a model was exhibited at the British Association meeting in 1873&lt;ref&gt;See [[#refprocice|''Proceedings'' of the Inst.C.E. (1881)]], at page 31.&lt;/ref&gt; (for computing 8 tidal components), followed in 1875-6 by a machine on a slightly larger scale (for computing 10 tidal components), was designed by Sir William Thomson (who later became [[Lord Kelvin]]).&lt;ref&gt;see [[#refthom1881|W Thomson (1881)]], a paper of Thomson's presented to the Institution of Civil Engineers in January 1881. Subsequent discussion at the same meeting of the Institution of Civil Engineers covered questions of history and priority about aspects of the design since 1872, see [[#refprocice|Proceedings for January 1881]] especially pages 30-31. The design had been described at the British Association Meeting of 1872 and a model for an 8-component prototype shown at the British Association meeting of 1873.&lt;/ref&gt; The 10-component machine and results obtained from it were shown at the Paris Exhibition in 1878.  An enlarged and improved version of the machine, for computing 20 tidal components, was built for the Government of India in 1879, and then modified in 1881 to extend it to compute 24 harmonic components.&lt;ref&gt;The 20-component instrument was described by [[#refrob1879|E Roberts (1879)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In these machines, the prediction was delivered in the form of a continuous graphical pen-plot of tidal height against time.  The plot was marked with hour- and noon-marks, and was made by the machine on a moving band of paper as the mechanism was turned.  A year's tidal predictions for a given place, usually a chosen seaport, could be plotted by the 1876 and 1879 machines in about four hours (but the drives had to be rewound during that time).

In 1881-2, another tide predicting machine, operating quite differently, was designed by [[William Ferrel]] and built in Washington under Ferrel's direction by E. G. Fischer (who later designed the successor machine described below, which was in operation at the US Coast and Geodetic Survey from 1912 until the 1960s).&lt;ref&gt;[[#refferr1883|W Ferrel (1883)]]; also [[#reffis-tpm2|E G Fischer (1912)]], at pages 273-275; also [[#refsci1884|''Science'' (1884)]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Ferrel's machine delivered predictions by telling the times and heights of successive high and low waters, shown by pointer-readings on dials and scales. These were read by an operator who copied the readings on to forms, to be sent to the printer of the US tide-tables.

These machines had to be set with local tidal constants special to the place for which predictions were to be made.  Such numbers express the local tidal response to individual components of the global tide-generating potential, at different frequencies.  This local response, shown in the timing and the height of tidal contributions at different frequencies, is a result of local and regional features of the coasts and sea-bed.  The tidal constants are usually evaluated from local histories of tide-gauge observations, by harmonic analysis based on the principal tide-generating frequencies as shown by the global [[theory of tides]] and the underlying [[lunar theory]].

Thomson was also responsible for originating the method of harmonic tidal analysis, and for devising a harmonic analyzer machine, which partly mechanized the evaluation of the constants from the gauge readings.

Development and improvement based on the experience of these early machines continued through the first half of the 20th century.

British Tide Predictor No.2, after initial use to generate data for Indian ports, was used for tide prediction for the British empire beyond India, and transferred to the National Physical Laboratory in 1903.  British Tide Predictor No.3 was sold to the French Government in 1900 and used to generate French tide tables.
[[File:Tide Predicting Machine No. 2 ("Old Brass Brains").jpg|alt=The face of Tide Predicting Machine No. 2|thumb|[[Tide-Predicting Machine No. 2]] ("Old Brass Brains"). The operator powered the machine by turning the crank at the left. The machine stopped when the simulation reached high and low tides, at which time the operator recorded the tide height and the day and time from the dials on the machine's face. The tide curve drawn on the paper above the dials was retained in case questions were raised later about the calculations.]]

Tide-predicting machines were built in Germany during World War I, and again in the period 1935-8.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#refdsm|German Maritime Museum]] online exhibit, and [[#reftpmde|Deutsches Museum]] online exhibit.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the last to be built were: 
* a TPM built in 1947 for the Norwegian Hydrographic Service by Chadburn of Liverpool, and designed to compute 30 tidal harmonic constituents;  used until 1975 to compute official Norwegian Tide Tables, before being superseded by digital computing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vannstand.statkart.no/Engelsk/hist_tilbake.php Norwegian Hydrographic Service - history].&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[#refpoltpm|Doodson-Légé TPM]] built in 1949,
* an East German TPM built 1953-5.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#refdsm|German Maritime Museum (online exhibit)]].&lt;/ref&gt;
Excluding small portable machines, a total of 33 tide-predicting machines are known to have been built, of which 2 have been destroyed and 4 are presently lost.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/513660/ P.

'''Villa Villekulla''' is a [[fiction]]al house that is the home of [[Pippi Longstocking]], a character in a series of books. She lives there with her horse and monkey, [[Mr. Nilsson]]. Outside stands a tree that grows [[Sockerdricka]], a soft drink sold in Sweden.

The house used during the TV series and some films with [[Inger Nilsson]] in the lead role was located in the locality of [[Vibble]] on the island of [[Gotland]] in Sweden. Until the 1970s, the house stood in a garden at the [[Gotland Regiment]] (P 18) south of [[Visby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Öhrman |first=Roger |title=Vägen till Gotlands historia |series=Gotländskt arkiv, 0434-2429 ; 66(1994):specialvol. |year=1994 |publisher=Gotlands fornsal |location=Visby |isbn=91-88036-13-8 |id={{LIBRIS|7768507}} |page=259 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then relocated to Kneippbyn and Kneippbyns Summerland about three kilometers away from where it stood during filming of Pippi Longstocking, where it remains standing to this day. The garden where the filming took place and where Villa Villekulla stood can still be seen. Today there is a [[Scots pine]] growing where it once stood.
