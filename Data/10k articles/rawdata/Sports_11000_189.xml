The '''Belarusian [[Super Cup]]''' is an annual one-match [[association football]] competition in Belarus organized by the [[Football Federation of Belarus]]. This competition serves as the season opener and is played between the [[Belarusian Premier League]] Champions and the [[Belarusian Cup]] Winners of the previous season. If a single team holds both titles, the Cup runners-up are invited. The match usually played in late February or early March each year.

==History==
The predecessor to Belarusian Super Cup - the semi-official competition named Season Cup was contested in July 1994 between then-current champions and Cup holders [[FC Dinamo Minsk|Dinamo Minsk]] and Cup runners-up [[FC Bobruisk|Fandok Bobruisk]]. Dinamo won the match 5–3. The tournament was scrapped after just one edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pressball.by/articles/football/belaruscup/65480 |title=Supercup 2010 preview |date=2010-03-04 |publisher=pressball.by}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official Belarusian Super Cup competition was introduced in 2010 and is held every year since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=1459483.html |title=BATE clinch Belarusian Super Cup |date=2010-03-08 |publisher=uefa.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717135530/http://www1.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid%3D1459483.html |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to climate restrictions, it is usually played in enclosed [[Football Manege (Minsk)|Football Manege]] in Minsk.

'''Bradner Stadium''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium|multi-purpose]] [[stadium]] in [[Olean, New York]].  The stadium, which can accommodate both [[baseball]] and [[American football|football]], served as home to minor-league baseball teams including the [[Olean Oilers]] and [[Olean Yankees]].  The stadium was built in 1926 and was substantially renovated in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, Chris (May 12, 2014). [http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/olean/bradner-stadium-makeover-almost-complete-field-house-is-next-20140511 Bradner Stadium makeover almost complete, field house is next]. ''The Buffalo News''. Retrieved May 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It holds 4,000 people and primarily serves as the home stadium of the Olean High School and Archbishop Walsh football teams, although other events are also held at the stadium.

During the stadium's original baseball years, the field became notorious for its poor drainage and its configuration that had batters facing blinding sunlight when a game was played near sunset, which forced baseball games to be suspended until the sun set below the horizon. The stadium's baseball configuration was removed in the 1970s in what was then a successful effort to improve the drainage in the stadium, and when the stadium was again reconfigured for baseball decades later, the diamond was reoriented to avoid the "sun breaks."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oleantimesherald.com/sports/article_5bdb0c7c-2390-11e5-ae50-67d557d2d7eb.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[semi-professional]] Southern Tier Diesel of the Northeastern Football Alliance relocated from [[Wayland (town), New York|Wayland]] to begin play at the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oleantimesherald.com/articles/2008/12/18/news/doc494a5d03ae6b2397128909.txt|title=Semi-pro football coming to Olean|work=Olean Times Herald|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Diesel were evicted after the 2015 season, with the mayor of Olean saying that the team had damaged the playing field during a game in the 2015 season that was played in a rainstorm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boudin|first=Kelsey|url=http://www.oleantimesherald.com/news/summer-sports-at-bradner-limited-to-baseball/article_b2ad72d2-a145-11e5-9340-2b852db7f1c9.html|title=Summer sports at Bradner limited to baseball|work=Olean Times Herald|date=December 13, 2015|accessdate=December 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Diesel were able to negotiate a compromise before the 2016 season that limits their home appearances to one game per month during baseball season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boudin|first=Kelsey|url=http://m.oleantimesherald.com/news/oilers-and-diesel-to-keep-sharing-revamped-venue/article_d0b52826-b4f8-11e5-b197-2350309b9224.html?mode=jqm|title=Oilers and Diesel to keep sharing revamped venue|work=Olean Times Herald|date=January 7, 2016|accessdate=January 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revived Olean Oilers, this version a member of the [[New York Collegiate Baseball League]], took up residence at the stadium in 2013.

The [[naming rights]] to the stadium have long been held by Bradner's, a local [[department store]]. The store shut down in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Donahue, Tom (August 25, 2014).

'''Brunton Park''' is a [[association football|football]] [[stadium]] and the home of [[Carlisle United FC]]. It is situated in the city of [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], [[Cumbria]] and has a certified capacity for the 2011/12 season of 18,202. The ground opened in 1909. Brunton Park's grandstand burned down in 1953 and the stadium flooded completely in 2005 and again in 2015.

Brunton Park is split into four separate stands; Warwick Road End, East Stand, Main (West) Stand and the Petteril End, which remains closed unless exceptionally large crowds are in attendance.

Brunton Park is the [[List of English football stadia by capacity|largest football stadium in England]] which is not all-seated. Carlisle United plan to move away from Brunton Park in the near future to a 12,000 capacity all-seater stadium.

Before the 2012/13 season Cumbria County Council inspected Brunton Park and they deemed that certain areas of the stadium were unsafe. As a result, they reduced the capacity to 17,001 for the forthcoming season.

== History ==
In 1904 Shaddongate United became Carlisle United F.C., an association football club who played at the Millholme Bank ground to the west of Carlisle. The ground was often too small for their purposes and they sometimes used the Rugby Ground which would later be the adjacent neighbour of Brunton Park. In 1905 United joined the Lancashire Combination league and required larger facilities so moved to Devonshire Park, a football ground which stood where [[Trinity School (Carlisle)|Trinity School]] now sits. In 1909 they were evicted from premises by the Duke of Devonshire and moved eastwards to establish Brunton Park, the club's home ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thebeautifulhistory.wordpress.com/clubs/carlisle-united/ |title=Carlisle United - The Beautiful History |accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grandstand fire===
In 1953 the original wooden grandstand which sat where the Main Stand now sits was burned to the ground in a fire cause by an electrical fault. The sale of local player [[Geoff Twentyman]] to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] for £12,500 enabled the club to rebuild the stadium into what is the West Stand today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.united-trust.org.uk/newsletters/05.pdf |title=Tribute to Geoff Twentyman | publisher= Carlisle and Cumbria United In dependant Supporters Trust |accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flooding===
;2005
On the evening of Friday 7 January 2005, the rivers Eden, Caldew and Petteril burst their banks in Carlisle due to as much as 180mm rainfall landing up stream that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/interesting/jan2005floods/ |title=Carlisle Floods January 2005| publisher=Met office |accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worst affected area was Warwick Road, where Brunton Park is situated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/cumbria/content/images/2005/01/31/carlisleo_0123_470x353_470x354.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

For the following six weeks Carlisle United were forced to play their home games at [[Christie Park (Morecambe, England)|Christie Park]] in [[Morecambe]] while repair work took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cumberlandnews.co.uk/brunton-park-will-rock-as-united-return-after-month-long-flooding-nightmare-1.412552?referrerPath=2.935 |title= Brunton Park will rock as United return after month-long flooding nightmare |publisher= The Cumberland News |accessdate= 25 April 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120309065120/http://www.cumberlandnews.co.uk/brunton-park-will-rock-as-united-return-after-month-long-flooding-nightmare-1.412552?referrerPath=2.935 |archivedate= 9 March 2012 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; United were still able, however, to reach the playoffs in the [[Conference National|Conference]] that season and win promotion back into [[the Football League]].

;2015

The Stadium was severely flooded following [[Storm Desmond]]. It caused the team to play fixtures at Preston's [[Deepdale]] Ground, Blackburn's [[Ewood Park]] and Blackpool's [[Bloomfield Road]].

;Other floods
In November 2009 and November 2015, half the pitch and the match day car park were flooded but the stadium wasn't damaged. The match day car park is flooded a least once every year.

== Layout ==

===Paddock / Main (West) Stand===
[[File:Main Stand Carlisle Utd.jpg|thumb|Paddock/Main Stand]]

The West Stand, is a 6,000 capacity mixed terraced and seated area. It is regarded as the main stand at Brunton Park and on average receives the highest attendance of home fans. The stand accommodates the club's offices and changing rooms as well as media facilities for radio and television coverage.

The lower tier is mainly a paddock terrace which runs the length of the pitch. The home and away dugouts are situated in front of this stand with the tunnel dividing it through the centre. To the north is an area for disabled supporters

The upper tier is known as the family stand with a small section to the south known as the 'A' Stand which houses school children. The full extent of the upper tier is seated and is the location of the stadium's most recent improvements, upgraded seating which was bought from [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]] in 2006 during the club's move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsf.org.uk/ground-guide/stadiums/carlisle/brunton-park-/|title=Brunton Park History|publisher=The FSF Ground Guide|accessdate=25 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230194834/http://www.fsf.org.uk/ground-guide/stadiums/carlisle/brunton-park-/|archivedate=30 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the north end of the stand is also a viewing gallery positioned in-between the two tiers of the stand. The gallery sits in front of Foxy's restaurant which offers hospitality packages to supporters.

===Warwick Road End===
[[File:Warwick Road End.jpg|thumb|Warwick Road End]]
The most distinctive of the four stands at Brunton Park, a unique covered terrace with a triple triangle roof, it is situated at the southern end of the stadium. Although currently called the 'Newcastle International Airport End' under a sponsorship deal, it is still affectionately known as 'the Warwick' to most Carlisle fans. The stand has a capacity of 3,500 and usually houses the most vocal supporters on match day. In the event low crowds are expected this stand can be closed to the public.

===East "Pioneer Foods" Stand===
Currently named the 'Pioneer Foods Stand', it is a 6,000 seater single-tiered cantilever stand. Although having been constructed a number of years ago, the club still have not completed the interior of the stand, thus the spaces at the top of the stand for executive boxes still stand empty. One peculiar thing fans may have noticed when visiting the ground is that the stand actually runs 20 yards past the goal line at the northern end of the pitch. This is because the club had erected the stand with a view of moving the pitch further northwards so a new stand at the southern end of the ground could also be built. These plans never materialised though, and the problem still stands today.

The north section of the East Stand most commonly houses the away fans, separated from the home fans by nets and a gate in the concourse. When large groups of home fans are expected away fans are sometimes restricted to the Petteril End.

In November 2010 local business and longtime supporters of the club the [[Stobart Group]] celebrated their 40th anniversary and bought 4,000 tickets on the East Stand for the [[League One]] fixture: Carlisle versus [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]]. The company then gave away the tickets to the local public. On this occasion the away fans were moved solely to the Petteril End.

===Waterworks End===
[[File:Waterworks.jpg|thumb|Petteril End]]
The Petteril is the only other uncovered stand in the ground alongside the lower tier paddock. The stand is a small capacity (2,000) terrace with a small seated area to the east. This stand usually remains closed unless exceptionally large crowds are expected.

To the west of the stand is a small control tower which is used to facilitate crowd supervision on match days. Also located here is the only scoreboard in the stadium and an advertising screen which sometimes displays goal replays.

===Premier League pitch===
[[File:Cumberland Building Society Stand cropped.jpg|thumb|A view from the south east corner of Brunton Park towards the East Stand]]
The [[Association football pitch|pitch]] at Brunton Park currently measures {{convert|104|by|67|m|yd|abbr=off}}. Originally a soil-based pitch was housed which was built over a landfill site; over the years this caused numerous settlement problems such as dips and crowns. When [[Bill Shankly]] joined the club in 1949 he called the ground "a glorified hen coop, everything was in terrible condition except for the pitch and that was always a good one".&lt;ref name="shanklypitch"&gt;{{cite news

During the flooding of January 2005, heavy deposits of silt were left on the playing field and a decision was made by the owners to build a new pitch and install a new primary drainage system.&lt;ref name="shop"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pitchcare.com/magazine/united-at-carlisle.html |title=United at Carlisle | publisher= Pitchcare.com |date=19 March 2008 |accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other areas===
[[File:Hughie McIlmoyle statue cropped.jpg|thumb|McIlmoyle statue outside Brunton Park]]

The stadium has on-site parking to the east and north of the ground as well as a smaller parking area to the west. To the north of the ground is a separate pitch which is used for training purposes as well as reserve games.

A club shop is situated south of the ground on Warwick Road. The shop was renovated before reopening after the flooding in 2005, turning over £20,000 on its first day back in business.&lt;ref name="shop-2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cumberlandnews.co.uk/hughie-to-unveil-statue-at-united-open-day-1.369702?referrerPath=2.935 |title=Hughie to unveil statue at United open day |publisher=The Cumberland News |date=29 July 2005 |accessdate=25 April 2011 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In front of the shop stands a life-size bronze statue of former player [[Hugh McIlmoyle]].

[[File:424px-BruntonParkPlan-en.png|thumb|A plan of Brunton Park. The shaded area indicates the section most commonly designated for away fans.]]
In 1982, Brunton Park hosted a [[rugby league]] match between Cumbria and [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]] during the Aussie's [[1982 Kangaroo tour]]. On their way to their first ever undefeated [[Kangaroo Tour|tour of Great Britain and France]], the Kangaroos, who would become known as "The Invincibles", defeated Cumbria 41-2 in front of just 5,748 fans.

In 2007 Brunton Park was transformed into a 20,000 capacity concert venue to host [[Elton John]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cumberlandnews.co.uk/news/blues-army-for-elton-at-brunton-park-1.171356?referrerPath=home/2.3080|title=Blues army for Elton at Brunton Park|publisher=Cumberland News|date=8 June 2007|accessdate=25 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309065130/http://www.cumberlandnews.co.uk/news/blues-army-for-elton-at-brunton-park-1.171356?referrerPath=home%2F2.3080|archivedate=9 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Brunton Park was used during the production of the BBC television programme ''[[United (TV drama)|United]]'', a docudrama centring on [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at the time of the [[Munich air disaster]]. The ground was chosen due to a likeness in parts of the stadium with 1950s [[Old Trafford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1417289_tv-drama-united-to-tell-story-of-busby-babes |title=TV drama ''United'' to tell story of Busby Babes| publisher=Manchester Evening News|first=Ian |last=Wylie |date=6 April 2011 |accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Records==
Record attendance: (tied) 27,500 Carlisle United-[[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], 5 January 1957, FA Cup 3rd Round &lt;br /&gt;
27,500 (Carlisle United-[[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], 7 February 1970, FA Cup 5th Round&lt;br /&gt;
Record gate receipts: £146,000 (Carlisle United-[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], 30 September 1997, Coca-Cola Cup 2nd Round

Brunton Park was the first ground to host an FA cup match between league clubs played under lights. Carlisle United played [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]] in a first round replay, losing 1-3.

==Planned developments==
By the time of the East Stand's opening in August 1996, plans were afoot to redevelop Brunton Park into a 28,000 capacity all-seater stadium. However, the club's lack of progress on the pitch over the next decade, along with the subsequent departure of ambitious owner [[Michael Knighton]], meant that the stadium remained unchanged from that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kynson.splathosting.com/RIOA/club/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425232222/http://www.kynson.splathosting.com/RIOA/club/history.htm |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 November 2011, with Carlisle United F.C. established in League One (third tier) for the sixth season, the club announced plans to leave Brunton Park for a new 12,000-seat stadium in the Kingmoor area of the city. These plans come under the slogan 'Project Blue Yonder'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15788028.stm | work=BBC News | title=Carlisle reveal ground move plans | date=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''City Park Ice Rink''' ({{lang-hu|Városligeti Műjégpálya}}) is a public ice rink located in the [[City Park (Budapest)|City Park]] of the Hungarian capital [[Budapest]], between the [[Hősök tere|Heroes' Square]] and the [[Vajdahunyad Castle]]. Opened in 1870, it is the largest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budapest.com/budapest_city_park_(varosliget)/ice-skating_rink_and_lake.en.html|title=Ice-Skating Rink and Lake|publisher=budapest.com|accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the oldest ice rinks in Europe. In summer months the area is filled up with water to create a pond, which is primarily used for boating, but also hosted several special events, such as the snowball fight world record attempt in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saatchi.hu/en/news/archive/snowball_fight_world_record_attempt_on_the__t-home_and_t-mobile_family_day|title=Snowball Fight World Record Attempt on the T-Home and T-Mobile Family Day|publisher=Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Hungary|date=2 February 2009|accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Art on Lake exhibition in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artonlake.hu/static.php?pmPage=exhibition|title=Contemporary art exhibition on boating lake at City Park Lake|publisher=artonlake.hu|accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It went through a complete renovation between 2009 and 2011, in which the main building was restored to its 19th-century look. The skating area was expanded to {{convert|12,000|m2|sqft}} and a standard ice hockey rink was set up as well. The skating rink re-opened on 16 December 2011 and it was the home of the [[2012 European Speed Skating Championships]] from 6 to 8 January.

The memorial of the [[Hungarian Ice Hockey Hall of Fame]] is also found at the City Park Ice Rink since its inauguration in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icehockey.hu/index.php?pg=news_13_3280 |title=A Városligeti Műjégen lesz látható a magyar hoki legendáit bemutató kiállítás |publisher=Hungarian Ice Hockey Federation |date=21 February 2012 |accessdate=25 February 2012 |language=Hungarian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510135156/http://icehockey.hu/index.php?pg=news_13_3280 |archivedate=10 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the second part of the nineteenth century the pleasant environment of the City Park became a beloved place for relaxation, entertainment and freetime activities. On the City Park Lake boating and rowing were popular sports to practice and during the winter skaters also appeared on the frozen lake.

In the end of 1869, with the guidance of [[Géza Kresz]] the [[Budapesti Korcsolyázó Egylet|Pesti Korcsolyázó Egylet]] (Skating Association of Pest) was founded, and they also obtained the permission of the city council to create an ice rink on a part of the City Park Lake. A wooden pavilion was built on the shore of the lake as well, where the visitors could warm up and change their skates. The official opening ceremony took place on 29 January 1870 in the presence of [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria]], and skating got underway immediately, with the first ever race held on 2 February.&lt;ref name=epulettar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epulettar.hu/projekt/24989.aspx|title=Városligeti Műjégpálya, Budapest XIV.|publisher=Épülettár|accessdate=17 December 2011|language=Hungarian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130217193944/http://www.epulettar.hu/projekt/24989.aspx|archivedate=17 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This time the association had only 35 members, which increased to 432 by the end of the year.&lt;ref name=varosliget1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varosliget.info/mujegpalya.html|title=Műjégpálya|publisher=varosliget.info|accessdate=17 December 2011|language=Hungarian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911005521/http://www.varosliget.info/mujegpalya.html|archivedate=11 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outset of figure skating in Hungary can be dated from 6 January 1871, when [[Jackson Haines]], who is regarded as the father of figure skating, presented his show for the Hungarian audience. He repeated his visit in the next year, due to that figure skating gained ground quickly among Hungarian skaters.&lt;ref name=hunskating&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moksz.hu/bemutatkozas.htm|title=A magyar korcsolyázósport története|trans-title=The history of the Hungarian skating sport|publisher=Hungarian National Skating Federation|accessdate=17 December 2011|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874 the wooden cottage was burnt down, following that a new stable building was erected by the plans of Hungarian secessionist architect [[Ödön Lechner]]. On the ground floor was found the changing room and warming room, while on the upstaris was placed the main hall and the music room.&lt;ref name=epulettar /&gt; For 1879 floodlights were installed to ensure a skating opportunity at nights.&lt;ref name=varosliget1 /&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Varosligeti Mujegpalya 1896.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The building of the skating rink in 1896]] --&gt;

Budapesti Korcsolyázó Egylet, as Pesti Korcsolyázó Egylet was known since the unification of Buda, Pest and Óbuda in 1873, was one of the five founding members of the [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) in 1892 and it won the organization rights of the [[1895 European Figure Skating Championships]], which took place at the City Park Ice Rink.&lt;ref name=hunskating /&gt;

For 1893 due to the increasing number of the visitors the main building was proved to be too small and was replaced by a bigger [[Baroque Revival architecture|neo-baroque]] style building designed by [[Imre Francsek]].&lt;ref name=varosliget1 /&gt;

Beside sport events the skating rink gave home of ice feasts and shows. The fortieth anniversary of the foundation of the Pesti Korcsolyázó Egylet in 1909 was celebrated with a costume festival, in which the coronation of [[Matthias I of Hungary]] was performed, that originally took place on the frozen Danube. The king was personated by Count Károly Andrássy.&lt;ref name=varosliget1 /&gt; In the same year in the Városliget was held the [[1909 World Figure Skating Championships]], the first ever World event in Hungary, in which local skater [[Lily Kronberger]] triumphed.&lt;ref name=budapestcity&gt;{{cite web|url=http://budapestcity.org/03-muemlekek/14/Jegpalya/index-hu.htm|title=Városligeti Műjégpálya|publisher=budapestcity.org|accessdate=17 December 2011|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the World War I skating life experienced a setback, as skaters began to return to the City Park Ice Rink slowly at first, however, it speeded up after the articifal skate rink was handed over on 26 November 1926. The season grew for 105 days long, which offered more time for exercising and organizing competitions that gave a boost for the sport.

[[File:Mujegpalya Ice Rink.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The skating rink with the [[Vajdahunyad Castle]] in the background]]

In 1929 Budapest hosted the [[1929 World Figure Skating Championships|Figure Skating World Championship]] for ladies and pairs and in the 1930s Hungarian figure skaters won a number of European and World titles: the [[Olga Orgonista]]–[[Sándor Szalay (figure skater)|Sándor Szalay]] pair won the European Championship, while the [[Emilia Rotter]]–[[László Szollás]] duo won four World Championships between 1931 and 1935. The latter ones also won bronze medal both at the 1932 and 1936 Winter Olympics.&lt;ref name=hunskating /&gt; By that time the seats of the grandstand was heated by electric plates. Prices were high, a seating place cost 5 [[Hungarian pengő|pengő]], from which one could buy a pair of shoes.&lt;ref name=varosliget2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://varosliget.info/mujegpalya.html?start=1|title=Műjégpálya|publisher=varosliget.info|accessdate=17 December 2011|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the World War II, in the 1944 bombings the rink suffered serious damages. After the end of the war works began to recostruct the skating rink and for the autumn of 1945 bigger part of it became serviceable again.&lt;ref name=hunskating /&gt; Further expansions took place in the 1960s when the skating area was enlarged,&lt;ref name=budapestcity /&gt; and standard, 400 metres long speed skating tracks were adapted.&lt;ref name=varosliget2 /&gt;

It is the only ice surface for [[bandy]] in Hungary and the [[Bandy World Championship 2004|Bandy World Championship 2004, Group B]], was played here,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bandyvm.se/RTE/my_documents/my_pictures/VM_2004/budapest.jpg Photo from the match between the home team and Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Bandy World Championship for women 2007]].

Most recently the Városligeti Műjégpálya was renovated and expanded from 2009 to 2011. The total cost of the amelioration process was 4.7 billion [[Hungarian Forint]] (approximately €16 million), of which about €3 billion came from the [[European Regional Development Fund]]. After the redevelopment the skating area grew by 15 percent, and now it consist a 180×67 metres skating rink and an international standard ice hockey rink.&lt;ref name=nda /&gt; The quality of the largest ice surface in Europe is ensured by the about {{convert|210|km|mi}} long embedded cooling tube system. The interior of the main building, which is a national monument, was restored to the 1926 state with its gilded pillars and banisters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hir24.hu/belfold/2011/12/13/kinyit-a-varosligeti-mujegpalya/|title=Kinyit a Városligeti Műjégpálya|publisher=hir24.hu|date=13 December 2011|accessdate=17 December 2011|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went through further expansions: a culture and tourism center, and an event hall was established inside the building, which make enable it to host conferences and to offer other activities (exhibitions, cultural programs) beside skating and boating.&lt;ref name=nda&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfu.hu/content/3349|title=2010 végéig megújul a Városligeti Műjégpálya|publisher=National Development Agency|date=24 June 2009|accessdate=17 December 2011|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Club Atlético Anglo''' is a [[football (soccer)|football]] club from [[Fray Bentos]] in [[Uruguay]].

Established on June 1, 1907 with the denomination Liebig Football Club, changed later.

On June 13, 1912, together with the [[Fray Bentos F.C.]] was established the [[Liga Departamental de Fútbol de Río Negro]].&lt;ref name="liga"&gt;[http://www.futboldelinterior.com/guia/liga-fraybentos.html Liga Departamental de Fútbol de Río Negro (Fray Bentos)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018065448/http://www.futboldelinterior.com/guia/liga-fraybentos.html |date=2011-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Anglo" is notable for its secular rivalry with the [[Laureles F.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laurelesfc.com.uy/SabiaUd/clasicoAnglo.html One of the oldest football derbies in the world] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212712/http://www.laurelesfc.com.uy/SabiaUd/clasicoAnglo.html |date=2016-03-03 }} (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clube Náutico da Ilha de Luanda''', short '''CNIL''' (''Nautical Club of Luanda Island''), is a sports club in the city of [[Luanda]], [[Angola]]. 

Founded on February 28, 1924, under the name "Nun'Alvares Sports Club" (''Clube Desportivo Nun’Alvares''), a name it kept until April 11, 1979, when following the order of the secretary of the National Council of Physical Education and Sport of Angola, which stated, that clubs with names related to colonialism should proceed to its replacement, the club had to change his name.&lt;ref name="CNIL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clubenautico.org/historia.aspx|title=CNIL history |first= |last= |work= |publisher=CNIL |language=Portuguese |accessdate=February 21, 2011 |quote= |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its foundation it is the yacht club with most titles in Angola to date.&lt;ref name="CNIL"/&gt;

{{refimprove|date=January 2008}}
In [[baseball]] and [[softball]], the '''count''' refers to the number of [[Strike zone|balls and strikes]] a batter has in his current [[plate appearance]]. It is usually announced as a pair of numbers, for example, 3-1 (pronounced as "three and one," or, alternatively, "a three-one count"), with the first number being the number of [[Base on balls|balls]] and the second being the number of [[Strike (baseball)|strikes]]. An individual [[Pitch (baseball)|pitch]] may also be referred to by the count prior to its delivery, for example, a pitch thrown with a count of three balls and one strike would be called a "three-one pitch." A count of 1-1 or 2-2 is called '''even'''.  Zero is commonly pronounced "oh," although a 0-0 count is rarely expressed as such — the count is typically not mentioned until at least one pitch has been thrown.

==About==
The home plate [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] will signal the count with the number of balls on his left hand, and the number of strikes on his right hand.  (As a result, it reads backwards when viewed from the pitcher's point of view.)  Individual umpires vary in how frequently they give this signal; it is often done as a reminder when there has been a slight delay between pitches (such as the batter stepping out of the [[batter's box]]).  It can also be a signal to the [[scoreboard]] operator that an incorrect count is being shown on the board.  Some umpires may also give the count verbally, although usually only the batter and the [[catcher]] can hear it.

An important part of [[baseball statistics]] is measuring which counts are most likely to produce favorable outcomes for the [[pitcher]] or the hitter. Counts of 3-1 and 2-0 are considered hitters' counts, because the pitcher—faced with the possibility of [[base on balls|walking]] the batter—is more likely to throw a ball in the [[strike zone]], particularly a [[fastball]]. Somewhat surprisingly, in general, a 3-0 count tends to yield fewer hittable pitches, depending on the situation.  (Baseball fans have often suggested that this is because umpires are reluctant to call four straight balls and as a result "ease up" on the fourth pitch, treating it as having a wider strike zone.)  Often batters will '''take''' (not swing at) a 3-0 pitch, since the pitcher has missed the strike zone three straight times already, and a fourth would earn the batter a walk. This is a sound strategy because the batter is more likely to eventually reach base even if the count becomes 3-1 than he is if he puts the ball in play on 3-0.&lt;ref&gt;Bickel, J. Eric. 2009. On the decision to take a pitch. Decision Anal. 6(3) 186-193.&lt;/ref&gt; In some situations, it is also advantageous to take on 2-0 and 3-1.&lt;ref&gt;Bickel, J. E. 2009. On the decision to take a pitch. Decision Anal. 6(3) 186-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Counts with two strikes (except 3-2) are considered pitchers' counts.  An 0-2 count is very favorable to a pitcher.  In such a count, the pitcher has the freedom to throw one (or sometimes two) pitches out of the strike zone intentionally, in an attempt to get the batter to '''chase''' the pitch (swing at it), and [[strikeout|strike out]]. Arguing as to whether a pitch was a ball or a strike (which is a judgment call by the umpire) is strictly prohibited by [[Major League Baseball]] rules.  Such an infringement, known as "arguing balls and strikes," will quickly lead to a warning from the umpire, and the player or [[manager (baseball)|manager]] may be ejected from the game if they continue to argue.&lt;ref&gt;http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/umpire_9.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Full count==
A '''full count''' (sometimes called a '''full house''', which is the usual term in [[softball]]) is the common name for a count where the [[batter (baseball)|batter]] has three balls and two [[strike zone|strikes]].  The term may derive from older [[scoreboard]]s, which had three spaces for balls and two for strikes, since this is the maximum number of each that can be achieved before the plate appearance ends (such as with a [[strikeout]], walk or hit). Many scoreboards still use light bulbs for this purpose, and thus a 3-2 count means all the bulbs are fully lit up. The alternative or variant term ''full house'' is likely to have been influenced by the [[poker]] term for a hand with three of a kind and a pair.

Another strike against the batter will result in a [[strikeout]], while another ball will result in a [[base on balls|walk]].  However, a batter may maintain the two strikes indefinitely by hitting [[foul ball]]s, so a full count does not always mean that only five pitches have been thrown, nor that there is only one more pitch to throw.

A [[pitch (baseball)|pitch]] which is thrown with a full count is often referred to as a "payoff pitch", since it is likely to be a good pitch for the batter to swing at.  With three balls already, the pitcher cannot afford to miss the [[strike zone]], which would result in ball four and a walk for the batter.

Baserunners often will run on the pitch, even if they are not very fast runners, especially with two outs, as runners cannot be caught stealing or doubled off because the batter either will strike out to end the inning, walk to force the runners to advance, or put the ball in play and an out would be the third in an inning (in the event of a foul ball, the runner must return to his original base).

'''Death spiral''' is a required element of [[pair skating]] performed with the man in a [[Glossary_of_figure_skating_terms#P|pivot]] position, one toe anchored in the [[ice]]. Holding his hand, the woman circles her partner on a deep edge with her body almost parallel to the ice. In 2011, the ISU introduced a requirement that the woman's head must at some time reach the level of her skating knee in order to receive a value.&lt;ref name=isu121001/&gt; The man should be in a full pivot position, and the death spiral must be held for a minimum amount of rotation, depending on the level.

==Variations==

[[Image:WC 2010 Tong Jian and Pang Qing (death spiral).jpg|right|thumb|150px|Woman in catch-foot position during back outside death spiral]]

Death spirals can be performed in all four variants of inside/outside and forward/backward edges. The outside edge death spirals are considered more difficult than the inside edge variants. The forward outside death spiral is seen as the hardest of all.

Pairs may increase their score by incorporating a difficult entry or exit and/or holding the position during the death spiral. These may be one of the [[Figure skating spiral|spiral positions]], the [[Biellmann spin|Biellmann]], [[List of figure skating terms|shoot-the-duck]], or other position. Pairs may also change the hand hold during the death spiral.

==History==
The backward outside death spiral was invented in 1928 by [[Charlotte Oelschlagel]] and [[Curt Neumann]],&lt;ref&gt;Kelli Lawrence, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7qSiLyFZy1YC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=%22death+spiral%22+skating+%22Charlotte+Oelschlagel%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Xp_ly_hZfo&amp;sig=Ft-EYsengomcxAw8miFYRm13f4k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0qjgUfiSG4nj4APGwIDgDQ&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw ''Skating on Air: The Broadcast History of an Olympic Marquee Sport''], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; although it was first performed with the skaters holding both hands and the woman not fully lowered toward the ice.{{fact|date=July 2013|reason= the date was until this edit off by abt 25 years, &amp; the Kelli Lawrence source does not hint that, and note the earlier Charlotte spiral (see that article) is NOT a death spiral.}} The current{{vague|date=July 2013|"current" seems to imply two-hands is obsolete, yet we have a 2-handed photo. Did the contributor perhaps mean that 2-handed is worthless in some or all competitions? A ref is almost always appropriate}} one-handed version was developed in the 1940s by the Canadian pair [[Suzanne Morrow]] and [[Wallace Diestelmeyer]].  The other death spiral variants were invented by [[Ludmila Belousova]] and [[Oleg Protopopov]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=poiLBOP/&gt; They assigned the following names to them: ''Cosmic spiral'' (backward inside), ''Life spiral'' (forward inside), and ''Love spiral'' (forward outside).

==ISU Judging System==
Under the [[ISU Judging System]], the death spiral is abbreviated as "Ds" in the protocol, and preceded by a capital F or B indicating the direction and lower-case i or o for the edge; the level appears as a digit following the four letters.&lt;ref name=isu1445/&gt; Thus the abbreviations are:

{| class="wikitable" 
|-
! Edge
! Abbreviation
|-
| Forward Inside 
| FiDs
|-
| Forward Outside
| FoDs
|-
| Backward Inside
| BiDs
|-
| Backward Outside
| BoDs
|}

A level three backward inside death spiral would be written as ''BiDs3''.

For the 2007-2008 season, the back inside death spiral was the required death spiral for the senior pairs [[short program (figure skating)|short program]]. For the 2008-2009 season, the required death spiral was the forward inside.&lt;ref name=isusr06/&gt;

'''Jack Dempsey's Broadway Restaurant''', known popularly as '''Jack Dempsey's''', was a [[restaurant]] located in the Brill Building on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] between 49th and 50th streets in [[Manhattan]], [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tipsontables.com/jackdempseys.html |title=Tips on Tables: Jack Dempsey's Is Notable For Special Dishes |first1=Robert W. |last1=Dana|publisher=Tips on Tables.com  |date=August 1, 1949 |accessdate=June 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/27/obituaries/jack-j-amiel-restaurateur-owned-1951-winner-of-derby.html|title=Jack J.

Owned by world [[Heavyweight]] [[boxing]] champion, [[Jack Dempsey]],&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; it was considered by many to be an American institution. The restaurant originally opened for business as Jack Dempsey's Restaurant on Eighth Avenue and 50th Street, directly across from the [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|third Madison Square Garden]], in 1935. Most nights would find Dempsey's famous proprietor on hand to greet guests, sign autographs, pose for pictures, and hold court with people from all walks of life.

Located next door to [[Jack J. Amiel|Jack Amiel's]] "Turf Restaurant" on [[Times Square]], Amiel became famous as the owner of the "underdog"  horse [[Count Turf]] who won the 1951 [[Kentucky Derby]]. A few years after his Derby win, Jack Amiel became a co-owner of Jack Dempsey's Restaurant, which closed in 1974.

A favorite attraction of the restaurant was its famous cheesecake. In a letter to New York Magazine in 1973 Dempsey wrote,"Jack Dempsey's cheesecake has been in existence for almost 40 years. And in New York it is an institution in itself. It is baked on our premises, eaten in our restaurant, as well as airmailed all over the United States and Europe. We have had requests for our cheesecake from tourists who come to New York from faraway places; we've fulfilled requests over the years from France's late President Charles DeGaulle, who had his cheesecakes sent several times a year." &lt;ref&gt; New York Magazine. Dec. 10, 1973. p.6. Letters:  Cheesecake.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

'''MOL Aréna''' is a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Dunajská Streda]], [[Slovakia]].  It is currently used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and is the home ground of [[DAC 1904 Dunajská Streda]].  The stadium holds currently 10,352 people (under renovation). The intensity of the floodlighting is 1,800 lux.

==History==
Stadium was opened in 1953. The main stand was built in the first half of the 1980s and was inaugurated for the 1985 [[Spartakiad]]. Capacity was 16,410 spectators. The stadium underwent reconstruction in 2008, when [[DAC 1904 Dunajská Streda]] started play in [[Corgoň Liga]] by merging with [[FC Senec]].

In the 2016-17 league season, DAC drew an average home attendance of 4,112&lt;ref&gt;http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, the highest in the league.

== 2016-2018 reconstruction ==
Between 2016 and 2018, the current stadium will be replaced by a new, modern, all-sitting arena with capacity of 12,700 spectators.

In spring 2016 the old stands (except the main stand) were demolished. In June 2016, the construction of the new stadium began. In the first phase two new stands were built with an edge-stand between them. The main construction works finished in September. In November the stadium was ready for Slovakia league matches.

In the next phase will be constructed the main stand with dressing rooms, VIP and press rooms, fanshop, club museum and restaurant.

At least, there will be constructed the last stand which will replace current main stage. In this phase the facade of the stadium will be also constructed.

The new arena will have 4-star UEFA standard so it can be used for international matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fcdac.sk/sk/spravy/2016/04/22/takto-vyrastie-novy-stadion|title=Takto vyrastie nový štadión|date=2016-04-22|website=Takto vyrastie nový štadión {{!}} FC DAC 1904 Dunajská Streda|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maple Leaf Gardens''' is a historic building located at the northwest corner of [[Carlton Street]] and [[Church and Wellesley|Church Street]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. The building was initially constructed as an arena to host [[ice hockey]] games, but has since been reconstructed for other uses. Today, Maple Leaf Gardens is a multi-purpose facility, with [[Loblaws]] occupying retail space on the lower floors and an arena for Toronto's [[Ryerson University]], known as Mattamy Athletic Centre at the Gardens, occupying the top level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Maple Leaf Gardens: From Shrine to Supermarket|first=Dana|last=Flavelle|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/companies/article/1092943--maple-leaf-gardens-from-shrine-to-supermarket|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=November 25, 2011|accessdate=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mattamyathleticcentre.ca/arena-info |title=Mattamy Athletic Centre :: Venue Info |publisher=Mattamyathleticcentre.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-01-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222133028/http://www.mattamyathleticcentre.ca/arena-info |archive-date=December 22, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered one of the "cathedrals" of ice hockey, it was home to the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]] from 1931 to 1999. The Leafs won the [[Stanley Cup]] 11 times  from 1932 to 1967 while playing at the Gardens.  The first NHL All-Star Game, albeit [[Ace Bailey Benefit Game|an unofficial one]], was held at the Gardens in 1934 as a benefit for Leafs forward [[Ace Bailey]], who had suffered a career-ending head injury. The first official annual [[National Hockey League All-Star Game]] was also held at Maple Leaf Gardens in 1947.

It was home to the [[Toronto Huskies]] (1946–1947) in their single season in the [[Basketball Association of America]] (a forerunner of the [[National Basketball Association]]), the [[Toronto Marlboros]] of the [[Ontario Hockey League]], the [[Toronto Toros]] of the [[World Hockey Association]] (1974–1976), the [[Toronto Blizzard (1971–84)|Toronto Blizzard]] of the [[North American Soccer League]] (1980–1982 indoor seasons), the [[Toronto Shooting Stars]] of the [[National Professional Soccer League (1984–2001)|National Professional Soccer League]] (1996–1997), and the [[Toronto Rock]] of the [[National Lacrosse League]] (1999–2000). The NBA's [[Buffalo Braves]] played a total of 16 regular season games at Maple Leaf Gardens from 1971 to 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Basketball/NBA/Toronto/2004/11/03/699007.html|title=The road was paved|date=2004-11-03|accessdate=2013-10-08|publisher=[[Toronto Sun]]|last=Buffery|first=Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NBA's [[Toronto Raptors]] played six games at the Gardens from 1997 to 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/sports/2013-04/18/c_132319610.htm|title=Raptors wrap up season with best attendance in 4 years|date=2013-04-18|accessdate=2013-10-05|agency=[[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]]|last=JIa|first=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/02/09/archive/main32282.shtm Bucks Blast Raptors Home Opener]&lt;/ref&gt; mostly when [[SkyDome]] was unavailable.

It was also one of the few venues outside the United States where [[Elvis Presley]] performed in concert (April 2, 1957). In 1972, Maple Leaf Gardens hosted game 2 of the famous [[Summit Series]] between Team Canada and the USSR. Team Canada won the game 4–1.

==History==

===Construction===
The Toronto Maple Leafs had been playing in the [[Mutual Street Arena|Arena Gardens]] on Mutual Street. It was built in 1912 and held 7,500 spectators for ice hockey. By 1930, Leafs managing director [[Conn Smythe]] decided the Arena was too small and he wanted to build a new arena, larger and more impressive.{{sfn|Smythe|Young|1981|p=102}} After considering various sites, the site at the corner of Carlton and Church was purchased from [[Eaton's|The T. Eaton Co. Ltd.]] for $350,000,{{sfn|Smythe|Young|1981|p=104}} (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|350000|1931}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars),{{inflation-fn|CA}} a price said to be $150,000 below market value. The new 12,473 seat (14,550 including standing room) arena was designed by the architectural firm of [[Ross and Macdonald]].
[[File:Maple Leaf Gardens' roof under construction, 1931 (public domain).png|thumb|225px|left|Maple Leaf Gardens roof under construction, pictured in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/toronto-feature-maple-leaf-gardens/|title=Toronto Feature: Maple Leaf Gardens| publisher = [[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] | website = thecanadianencyclopedia.ca | access-date = 20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
To finance the construction, Smythe launched [[Maple Leaf Gardens Limited]], (MLGL) a management company that would own the arena and the Maple Leafs.{{sfn|Smythe|Young|1981|p=102}} A public offering of shares in MLGL was made at [[Canadian dollar|C$]]10 each (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|10|1931}}}} in {{Inflation-year|CA}} dollars),{{inflation-fn|CA}} with a free common share for each five preferred shares purchased.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Ownership of the hockey team was transferred to MLGL in return for shares. Intending right from the start that the Gardens would host other events, [[W. A. Hewitt]], sports editor of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', was hired as general manager of Maple Leaf Gardens to oversee all events other than professional hockey.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited – Prospectus'', summary published in ''[[The Globe and Mail|The Globe]]'', March 5, 1931&lt;/ref&gt; His son, [[Foster Hewitt]], was hired to run the radio broadcasts, and oversaw the construction of the radio broadcast facilities.

The contract to construct the building was awarded to Thomson Brothers Construction of Port Credit in Toronto Township.&lt;ref name="contractor"&gt;{{cite news |title=Maple Leaf Gardens Contract Goes to Local Firm|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail|The Globe]]|location=Toronto|date=May 30, 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson Bros bid just under $990,000 for the project, the lowest of ten tenders received, mainly due to the fact that amongst the Thomson Brothers' various enterprises they had much of the sub contract work covered (Thomson Lumber, Thomson Bros.

===The Conn Smythe era: 1931–1960===
[[File:Maple Leaf Gardens Postcard 1931 (cropped) (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|Ceremonies for the opening of Maple Leaf Gardens, prior to a game between the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]].]]
The Gardens opened on November 12, 1931, with the Maple Leafs losing 2–1 to the [[Chicago Blackhawks]]. Reported attendance on opening night was 13,542.&lt;ref&gt;Rodden, Mike (November 13, 1931) "Over Thirteen Thousand Attend Opening Game" ''[[The Globe and Mail|The Globe]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The Leafs would go on to win their first [[Stanley Cup]] as the Maple Leafs that season (they had already won two previously—one as the [[Toronto Arenas]] and one as the [[Toronto St. Patricks]]).

The first professional wrestling show at the Gardens was held on November 19, 1931 and attracted 15,800 people to see world champion [[Jim Londos]] in the main event. The show was promoted by Jack Corcoran, who passed the reins to [[Frank Tunney]] and his [[Maple Leaf Wrestling]] promotion in 1939. Under Tunney, Toronto and the Gardens was for decades a thriving centre for professional wrestling. Local hero [[Whipper Billy Watson]] became the city's top wrestling attraction in the 1940s and 1950s. The last [[WWE]]-promoted event to be held at Maple Leaf Gardens was on September 17, 1995. Boxing was also a regular offering at the Gardens for many years. The first world title bout in the building was on September 19, 1932, with bantamweight champion [[Panama Al Brown]] knocking out challenger [[Émile Pladner]] in the first round.

Winston Churchill addressed a large audience at the Gardens in March 1932; when the arena's loudspeaker system broke down he tossed the microphone to one side, declared "Now that we have exhausted the resources of science we shall fall back upon Mother Nature and do our best", and continued.&lt;ref&gt;http://speeches.empireclub.org/60836/data&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1, 1946, Maple Leaf Gardens was the site of the first game in the history of the [[Basketball Association of America]] (later to become the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]), with the [[Toronto Huskies]] playing the [[New York Knicks|New York Knickerbockers]]. The Huskies played their last game at the Gardens on March 28, 1947, and the franchise folded shortly thereafter. In the 1946–47 NHL season, Maple Leaf Gardens was the first arena in the NHL to have [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|Plexiglas]] inserted in the end zones of the rink.&lt;ref&gt;''Hockey's Book of Firsts'', p.66, James Duplacey, JG Press, {{ISBN|978-1-57215-037-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smythe became the majority owner of Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. in 1947, following a power struggle between directors who supported him as president and those who wanted him replaced with [[Frank J. Selke]]. Toronto stock broker Percy Gardiner lent Smythe the money he needed to take control of the corporation. The loan was paid off in 1960.{{sfn|Smythe|Shea|2000}}

Beginning with the Canadian Grand Opera's production of ''Faust'' in 1936, the Gardens became home to more highbrow forms of entertainment. The Metropolitan Opera staged a number of its visiting productions there between 1952 and 1960.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/maple-leaf-gardens-emc/&lt;/ref&gt; The first rock and roll concert at the Gardens was held in 1956, featuring [[Bill Haley &amp; His Comets]]. [[Elvis Presley]]'s shows at the Gardens on April 2, 1957 were his first-ever concerts outside the United States. The Gardens also hosted evangelist [[Billy Graham]] during his Canadian Crusade, in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;http://heritagetoronto.org/maple-leaf-gardens&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smythe-Ballard-Bassett in partnership: 1961–1971===
[[File:Hockey game, Toronto Maple Leafs vs. Chicago Black Hawks, Maple Leaf Gardens.jpg|thumb|A hockey game between the Maple Leafs and the Black Hawks, c. 1960.]]
In 1961, Smythe sold most of his shares to a three-person partnership formed by his son, [[Stafford Smythe]], with [[Harold Ballard]] and [[John Bassett]]. The new ownership added 962 new seats to the Gardens in 1962 and added a private club, The Hot Stove Club, the following year. Even more seats were added in 1965 and new mezzanine galleries were constructed in 1966 and 1967. By 1968, [[seating capacity]] for hockey had grown to 16,485.&lt;ref&gt;''Maple Leaf Gardens: Fifty Years Of History'', Stan Obodiac, Van Nostrand Reinhold Ltd., 1981&lt;/ref&gt; This was achieved, in part, by making the seats narrower, so that—in the words of founder Conn Smythe—"only a young man could sit in them and only a fat old rich man could afford them." A large portrait of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] was removed to make room for more seats. When asked why he removed the picture, Ballard replied, "She doesn't pay me, I pay her. Besides, what the hell position can a queen play?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ballard: A Portrait of Canada's Most Controversial Sports Figure |first=William |last=Houston |publisher=Summerhill Press |year=1984 |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Leafs were so popular that the team sold out every game from 1946 to 1999. It was often called the "Carlton Street Cashbox" in sports reporting. Advertising was sold and placed throughout the building.

On November 8, 1963: Maple Leaf Gardens would be the first arena in the NHL to have separate penalty boxes.&lt;ref&gt;''Hockey's Book of Firsts'', p.72, James Duplacey, JG Press, {{ISBN|978-1-57215-037-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Beatles]] made a stop at Maple Leaf Gardens during each of their three North American tours: September 7, 1964, August 17, 1965, and August 17, 1966. It was the only venue to host the group on each tour.

In March 1966, Conn Smythe resigned from the board of directors after a [[Muhammad Ali]] boxing match was scheduled for the Gardens. He found Ali's comments about the [[Vietnam War]] to be offensive and said that by accepting the fight, Gardens owners had "put cash ahead of class."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Cash Rated Over Class' Conn Quits|first=Ken|last=McKee|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=March 8, 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1966, a new center-hung scoreboard with a digital clock was installed replacing the SporTimer which was an analog clock.  One of the designers of the new scoreboard, [[Paul Morris (PA announcer)|Paul Morris]], was by this time the arena's [[public address announcer]], a job he would hold until the Leafs left the arena.

Ballard and the younger Smythe were accused in 1969 of stealing money from the corporation and avoiding income taxes by having Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. pay for many of their personal expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Staff Smythe and Harold Ballard Charged with Income Tax Evasions|first=Ron|last=Lowman|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=July 9, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy created a rift between the two and Bassett, which led to Smythe and Ballard being fired from their management positions in 1969, only to win back control the following year. In September 1971, Bassett sold his shares to Stafford Smythe and Ballard. Just six weeks later, Smythe died. His brother and son tried to keep the shares within the Smythe family, but in February 1972 all of Smythe's shares were purchased by Ballard, leaving him with majority ownership of the building and the Leafs.

===Harold Ballard takes control: 1972–1990===
[[File:Johnny Valentine vs. NWA world wrestling champion Dory Funk Jr. at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto on February 11, 1973.jpg|thumb|Ring introductions for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] match between champion [[Dory Funk, Jr.]] and challenger [[Johnny Valentine]], February 11, 1973.]]
On July 7, 1974 the arena was the host of a [[Professional wrestling tournament]] which was called World Cup Wrestling. Various International stars competed in like [[Dara Singh]], [[Pat Roach]], [[Danny Lynch (wrestler)|Danny Lynch]], [[Tiger Jeet Singh]], Prince Mann Singh, [[Randhawa (wrestler)|Randhawa]], Than Yen Chang, Majid Ackra, Kashmir Singh, [[Tony Parisi (wrestler)|Tony Parisi]], [[Chris Tolos]], Golden Boy Apollo, and Terry Yorkston etc. In the main event match, world champion [[Dara Singh]] defeated [[Danny Lynch (wrestler)|Danny Lynch]] and retained his title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mapleleafwrestling.blogspot.in/2010/01/mlg-varsity-singhs.html |title=MLG, Varsity, &amp; The Singh's |publisher=[[Maple Leaf Wrestling]] |date=Jan 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlingdigest.com/2012/07/23/phantom-dara-singh-rip/ |title=Dara Singh – RIP…The Phantom of the Ring |publisher=Pro Wrestling Digest |date=Jul 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concert Promotions International was founded in 1973, by Bill Ballard, with [[Michael Cohl]] and David Wolinksy and brought many big-name music acts to the Gardens. The arena played host to The [[Rolling Thunder Revue]] Tour, with two consecutive shows, on December 1–2, 1975, headed by [[Bob Dylan]]. [[Bob Marley and The Wailers]] performed here on June 9, 1978 and November 1, 1979 in support of his Kaya Tour 1978 and Survival Tour 1979 respectively. The [[Bee Gees]] performed here on August 31, 1979. [[ABBA]] played here on Sunday, October 7, 1979, their last ever concert appearance in North America.&lt;ref&gt;[[ABBA: The Tour]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Who]] performed what was supposed to be their last concert in December 1982 at this venue and was filmed for the concert film ''[[The Who Rocks America]]'' (1982). It was also at this venue where The Who performed their final concert to a paying audience with drummer [[Keith Moon]] on October 21, 1976. The video for ''[[The Reflex]]'' by [[Duran Duran]] was shot at Maple Leaf Gardens in March 1984. Canadian rock trio [[Rush (band)|Rush]] recorded a live video for their [[Grace Under Pressure Tour (video)|Grace Under Pressure Tour]] at Maple Leaf Gardens. The arena played host to [[Amnesty International]]'s legendary [[Human Rights Now!]] Benefit Concert on September 15, 1988. The show was headlined by [[Bruce Springsteen]] &amp; The [[E Street Band]] and also featured [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Tracy Chapman]], [[Youssou N'Dour]] and [[k.d. lang]]. [[Pearl Jam]] performed at the arena on [[No Code Tour|September 21, 1996]] (the only Canadian date on the tour).
[[File:Maple Leaf Gardens 3.jpg|thumb|left|In 1982, the arena replaced its old centre-hung scoreboard with a newer model.]]
The Leafs continued to sell out every game through the Ballard era, even as the team's performance went into steep decline. The rink-side red seats were replaced with gold seats in 1974.{{sfn|Obodiac|1981}} In August 1979, to make room for private boxes, Ballard had his staff tear down the 48-year-old gondola from which [[Foster Hewitt]] regularly broadcast games across Canada and threw it into an incinerator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Oh No! Ballard's Trashed Hewitt's Gondola|first=Rick|last=Boulton|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=September 20, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an editorial, the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' called Ballard's actions the "barbaric destruction of one of Canada's great cultural monuments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Editorial|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=September 23, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Then in 1982, the centre-hung scoreboard that had been in use since 1966 was replaced by a new centre-hung scoreboard with a colour matrix message/animation screen on each side, which remained in use for the rest of the Maple Leafs' stay at the Gardens. Originally an American Sign and Indicator scoreboard, it was upgraded by [[Daktronics]] in the 1990s.

Prior to the launch of the [[Ottawa Nationals]] of the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA), the team had discussions with Ballard about locating the team in Toronto, but the talks did not get very far.  The team was a flop at the box office, averaging about 3,000 fans a game, and in March 1973—just before the end of the season—the City of Ottawa demanded payment of $100,000 to guarantee the club dates at the [[Ottawa Civic Centre]]. The team decided to leave Ottawa and played their home playoff games at Maple Leaf Gardens, attracting crowds of 5,000 and 4,000 in two games before being eliminated by the [[New England Whalers]]. At the end of the season, the team moved to Toronto permanently, and was sold to [[John F. Bassett]], son of former Leafs owner John Bassett.  They were renamed the Toronto Toros in June 1973.  Bassett wanted the team to play at a renovated [[CNE Coliseum]], while [[Bill Ballard]]—Harold's son, who was running the Gardens while his father served a prison sentence—wanted the team at the Gardens and opposed the plan to upgrade the Coliseum. The Toros ended up at [[Varsity Arena]] for the [[1973–74 WHA season|1973–74 season]].  The [[1974–75 WHA season|following season]], the Toros moved to the Gardens after negotiating a lease with Bill. However, by the time the team played their first game at the Gardens, Harold had been released from prison and regained control of the company. Ballard was a virulent opponent of the WHA; he never forgave the upstart league for decimating the Leafs' roster in the early 1970s. He made the Toros' lease terms at the Gardens as onerous as possible. The Toros' lease called for them to pay $15,000 per game. However, much to Bassett's outrage, the arena was dim for their first game.  It was then that Ballard demanded $3,500 for use of the lights. Ballard also denied the Toros access to the Leafs' locker room, forcing them to build their own at a cost of $55,000. He also removed the cushions from the home bench for Toros' games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hockeytraderumors.com/article3760.html Hockey Trade Rumors – NHL Rumors from around the league – 37 Year Cup Drought – The Legacy of Harold Ballard&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111145735/http://www.hockeytraderumors.com/article3760.html |date=November 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following two seasons of declining attendance and onerous lease terms at the Gardens, Bassett moved the club to [[Birmingham, Alabama]], where they were renamed the [[Birmingham Bulls]] for the [[1976–77 WHA season|1976–77 season]].

====Sexual abuse====
In 1997, allegations began to emerge that some employees of the Gardens had sexually abused young boys in the 1970s and 1980s. Martin Kruze was the first victim to come forward—contacting the new owners of Maple Leaf Gardens in 1993, and going public in February 1997. His story of abuses beginning in 1975 prompted dozens of other victims to come forward. In October 1997, Gordon Stuckless pleaded guilty to sexually abusing 24 boys dating back to 1969 and was sentenced to a jail term of two years less a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sex Abuser Jailed Less Than 2 Years|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=October 28, 1997|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, Kruze committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kruze Jumps to Death from Bridge: He was First Victim to Tell of His Abuse in Stuckless Sex Scandal|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/508993481.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Oct+31%2C+1997&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Spectator&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=C.1.FRO&amp;desc=Kruze+jumps+to+death+from+bridge%3A+He+was+first+victim+to+tell+of+his+abuse+in+Stuckless+sex+scandal|newspaper=[[The Hamilton Spectator]]|date=October 31, 1997|accessdate=February 28, 2013|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An appeals court later increased Stuckless' sentence to five years.

In January 2006, the Ontario government filed a $1.5 million lawsuit against Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment Ltd., seeking repayment of the medical costs to the province of treating the sex abuse victims.

===Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment: 1991–2003===
[[File:Tor chi 94.jpg|thumb|240px|Game 1 of the [[1994 Stanley Cup playoffs|1994 conference quarterfinal]] between the Maple Leafs and the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] at the Gardens after the Leafs scored a goal.]]
Ballard died in April 1990. The executors of his will were [[Steve Stavro]], Don Giffin and Don Crump. In 1991, Stavro paid off a $20 million loan that had been made to Ballard in 1980 by [[Molson]]. In return, he was given an option to buy Gardens shares from Ballard's estate. Molson also agreed to sell its stake in Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. to Stavro. That deal closed in 1994, and shortly after, Stavro bought Ballard's shares from the estate for $34 a share or $75 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Date-by-Date Story of Gardens Takeover Fight|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/512622201.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Nov+11%2C+1994&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Spectator&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=C.15&amp;desc=Date-by-date+story+of+Gardens+takeover+fight|newspaper=[[The Hamilton Spectator]]|date=November 11, 1994|page=C15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purchase was the subject of a securities commission review and a lawsuit from Ballard's son Bill Ballard, but the deal stood and Stavro and his partners in MLG Ventures became the new owner of the Leafs and Maple Leaf Gardens.

MLG Ventures took Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. private and the two corporations amalgamated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://osc.gov.on.ca/Enforcement/Proceedings/SOA/soa_19990321_mapleleafsport.jsp osc.gov.on.ca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717075356/http://www.osc.gov.on.ca/Enforcement/Proceedings/SOA/soa_19990321_mapleleafsport.jsp |date=July 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming [[Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment|Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment Ltd.]] after its acquisition of the [[Toronto Raptors]] in 1998. Initially, the majority owner of MLSE, holding 51% of the company, was MLG Holdings, a corporation controlled by Stavro, with minority shareholders Larry Tannenbaum (25%) and [[Toronto-Dominion Bank]] (20%). The other 49% of MLSE was owned by [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]]. In 2003 Stavro sold his shares and MLG Holdings was dissolved, leaving Teachers' as majority owners of MLSE.

During the 1990s, MLSE considered a number of sites for a new, modern arena to replace Maple Leaf Gardens, including the southeast corner of Bay and Dundas Streets near the [[Toronto Eaton Centre]] (the current site of the [[Ryerson University]] School of Business). By this time, Maple Leaf Gardens was considered too small and lacking in revenue-generating luxury boxes.

The Leafs had no plans to occupy the [[Air Canada Centre]], then under construction by the owners of the [[Toronto Raptors]], and it appeared for a time as though the stalemate between the two sports franchises would result in two new arenas being constructed in Toronto – one for hockey, one for basketball. When MLSE acquired the Toronto Raptors, however, the Air Canada Centre, which was still under construction, was retrofitted to accommodate both hockey and basketball.

The Raptors played their final game at the Gardens on February 9, 1999. A few days later, on February 13, 1999, the Toronto Maple Leafs ended a 67-year tradition when they played their last game at Maple Leaf Gardens, suffering a 6–2 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks. Former Leaf [[Doug Gilmour]] scored a fluke goal in that game and notorious tough guy [[Bob Probert]] scored the final NHL goal in MLG history during the third period.  During the emotional post-game ceremony, legendary Canadian singer [[Anne Murray]] performed ''[[The Maple Leaf Forever]]'', clad in a Leafs jersey.

The Gardens was the home arena for the [[Toronto Rock]] of the [[National Lacrosse League]] for the [[1999 NLL season|1999]] and [[2000 NLL season|2000]] seasons. The Rock won the [[Champion's Cup]] in both seasons, making them the building's last championship team. The 2000 NLL Championship game was ultimately the building's last professional event to be held at the MLG. They held training camp at the Gardens in 2001 and then moved to the ACC. Maple Leaf Gardens was then mostly dormant for a decade.

[[File:Maple Leaf Gardens (4) (3294778069).jpg|thumb|Early plans to redevelop the arena were abandoned when it was discovered the seating was supporting the exterior walls of the building.]]
MLSE refused to sell Maple Leaf Gardens to anyone who proposed to use it as an arena in competition with the Air Canada Centre. Among these turned down was [[Eugene Melnyk]], owner of the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] OHL hockey team and the Maple Leafs' rival team, the [[Ottawa Senators]]. Various redevelopment schemes were proposed, most notably an entertainment complex containing retail shops and cinemas (similar to the redevelopment of the [[Montreal Forum]]), but these plans were abandoned when it was discovered that the tiered arena seating was holding up the exterior walls of the building, acting as a form of interior [[flying buttress]]. If the bowl of seating were removed, therefore, the exterior walls would lose most of their support.

[[Loblaw Companies]], Canada's largest food retailer, purchased the Gardens in 2004 for $12 million under the condition that it not be used as a sports and entertainment facility, though MLSE eventually consented to allowing a small arena to be restored in the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citynews.ca/2011/10/19/maple-leaf-gardens-building-renamed/|title=Maple Leaf Gardens building renamed|last=Chu|first=Showwei|date=2011-10-19|accessdate=2014-01-16|publisher=[[CityNews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2009/11/30/ryerson_and_loblaws_make_a_deal_for_maple_leaf_gardens.html|title=Ryerson and Loblaws make a deal for Maple Leaf Gardens

Immediately, there was criticism that the conversion of the building to retail uses diminished its heritage value, and that Maple Leaf Gardens should continue to serve as an arena in accordance with its rich history and traditions. Others, however, noted that the structure had been deteriorating for a number of years, and that its ongoing use for minor league sports and events would not generate sufficient income to secure the building's preservation and restoration. Furthermore, the active re-use of the building would allow it to remain open to the public for years to come.

Needing an authentic stand-in for New York's [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|third Madison Square Garden]] during the [[Great Depression|Depression Era]], the producers shot the boxing sequences of ''[[Cinderella Man]]'' ([[Russell Crowe]] and [[Renée Zellweger]]) at Maple Leaf Gardens in 2004. Maple Leaf Gardens was stripped of some of its outdoor signage for production of an episode of Canadian-produced ''[[Flashpoint (TV series)|Flashpoint]]''. The arena was named "The Godwin Coliseum" in the episode titled "Behind the Blue Line" that originally aired on November 20, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shows.ctv.ca/Flashpoint/article/Sniper-in-Maple-Leaf-Gardens Sniper in Maple Leaf Gardens] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119072002/http://shows.ctv.ca/Flashpoint/article/Sniper-in-Maple-Leaf-Gardens |date=November 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 8, 2009, [[Matt Damon]] hosted a concert in support of the charity ONEXONE. It was the first concert at Maple Leaf Gardens in 8 years. The arena was used on May 8, 2009 for the International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association's convention tradeshow. Also in 2009, the arena was used as the venue for the [[Battle of the Blades (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[Battle of the Blades]]'', a [[CBC Television|CBC]]-produced [[reality competition]] pairing former [[National Hockey League|NHL]] hockey players with professional figure skaters in a pairs figure skating competition.

In 2009, Loblaws announced it had entered into discussions with [[Ryerson University]] regarding the possible future joint use of the arena. On November 30, 2009, the federal government agreed to contribute $20 million as part of a $60 million project to renovate the arena into a Loblaws grocery store and a new athletic facility for [[Ryerson University]] which included a fitness facility, studios, high-performance courts, and an NHL-sized ice hockey rink seating approximately 2,796 guests. The plans involved gutting the existing interior, and laying new floors for retail use at ground level, with the athletic centre located above. Construction began later that year.
[[File:Center Ice at Maple Leaf Gardens.jpg|thumb|upright|A red dot on the ground floor of the building marks the original location of centre ice.]]
After many delays including finding a creek running through the basement and a time capsule behind the 1931 cornerstone on Carlton Street, the new store opened on November 30, 2011. It incorporated many elements of Maple Leaf Gardens including original seats, a red dot on the ground floor marking the original centre ice location, the recreation of an original mural by the checkouts and a giant maple leaf made out of old seats from the arena among numerous other things. The centre also includes underground parking, a [[Joe Fresh]], an [[Liquor Control Board of Ontario|LCBO]] liquor store and a medical clinic. It is the chain's flagship location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Maple Leaf Gardens Set to Reopen as Massive Supermarket|first=Tristin|last=Hopper|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/11/21/maple-leaf-gardens-set-to-repoen-as-massive-supermarket/|newspaper=[[National Post]]|location=Toronto|date=November 21, 2011|accessdate=November 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transformation would win a World Architecture News Retail and Leisure Interiors Award in the "Retail outlets over {{Convert|200|m2|ft2}}" category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Urban Toronto |url=http://urbantoronto.ca/news/2013/03/world-architecture-news-awards-include-big-wins-and-canada |title=World Architecture News Awards include Big Wins for TO and Canada |date=March 11, 2013 |accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mattamy Athletic Centre at the Gardens==
On November 29, 2011, Ryerson University announced that Peter Gilgan, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Mattamy Homes Ltd., contributed a donation of $15 million to the university. In honour of Gilgan, the new athletic complex was renamed '''Mattamy Athletic Centre at the Gardens'''. The ice rink, which is located on the third level, was named '''Mattamy Home Ice'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Maple Leaf Gardens Gets a Makeover – and a New Name |first=James |last=Bradshaw |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/maple-leaf-gardens-gets-a-makeover-and-a-new-name/article2253522/ |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |location=Toronto |date=November 29, 2011 |accessdate=November 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201211121/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/maple-leaf-gardens-gets-a-makeover-and-a-new-name/article2253522/ |archive-date=December 1, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The athletic centre construction was completed in summer of 2012 and the ice rink became the new home for the [[Ryerson Rams]] hockey team. The first game took place on September 9, 2012 with the Rams taking a 5-4  victory over the [[University of Ontario Institute of Technology Ridgebacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rams Wins First Game at the New Gardens |first=Grace |last=Im |url=http://www.torontoobserver.ca/2012/09/09/rams-wins-first-game-at-the-new-gardens/ |newspaper=[[Centennial College|Toronto Observer]]|date=September 9, 2012|accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arena is home to the Ryerson Rams' hockey, basketball and volleyball teams.

During the Summer of 2012, the [[Canadian Lacrosse League]] announced the relocation of the Oshawa Machine to Toronto as the [[Toronto Shooting Stars (CLax)|Toronto Shooting Stars]]. It was also announced that the team would play out of the Mattamy Athletic Centre bringing Lacrosse back to the Gardens after a 13-year absence. The team held their first game on January 13, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torontoshootingstars.blogspot.ca/ |publisher=TorontoShootingStars.ca |title=Canadian Lacrosse League |date= |accessdate=22 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324105451/http://torontoshootingstars.blogspot.ca/ |archivedate=March 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-game honored former [[Toronto Rock]] and Tomahawk players. The team played one season at the arena before folding.

During the [[2012–13 NHL lockout]] the [[National Hockey League Players' Association]] (NHLPA) used the arena for a charity game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Locked-Out NHLers Take to the Ice at Former Maple Leaf Gardens for Charity|agency=[[The Canadian Press]]|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/story/2012/12/19/sp-hockey-nhlpa-charity-game-toronto-121219.html|work=[[CBC News]]|date=December 19, 2012|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, from January 25 to 27, 2013, the [[Ontario Liberal Party|Ontario Liberals]] used the Gardens for their [[Ontario Liberal Party leadership election, 2013|leadership convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ontario Liberals: Ontario Liberal Leadership Convention Coming to Maple Leaf Gardens|first=Rob|last=Ferguson|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1278874--ontario-liberals-ontario-liberal-leadership-convention-coming-to-maple-leaf-gardens|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=October 28, 2012|accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arena hosted the [[2013 Players' Championship]], a [[Capital One Grand Slam of Curling]] event.

On December 13–14, 2014, the arena was the host of two exhibition games between the [[Canada men's national junior ice hockey team]] and a team University All Stars of combined [[Ryerson Rams]], [[University of Toronto Varsity Blues]] and [[York Lions]] players in preparation for Canada's participation in the [[2015 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mattamyathleticcentre.ca/events/detail/canadian-national-junior-team-v-university-all-stars&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming rights==
On November 6, 2008, Hiroshima City gave [[Mazda]] Motor Corporation naming rights to the stadium. In October of that year, Mazda proposed to call the stadium "MAZDA Zoom-Zoom Stadium Hiroshima" for the period between April 1, 2009 and March 31, 2014. On December 24, 2008, Mazda entered into a contract with the City of Hiroshima regarding the stadiums name and made official the abbreviated name "'''{{Nihongo|Mazda Stadium|マツダスタジアム||}}'''". The "Zoom-Zoom" name was a reference to a marketing campaign by Mazda.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3578">[[File:Pushball.jpg|thumb|300px|Pushball game between New York Police and Fire Departments, 1939]]
'''Pushball''' is a [[game]] played by two sides on a field usually {{convert|140|yd|m}} long and {{convert|50|yd|m}} wide, with a ball {{convert|6|ft|m|}} in diameter and {{convert|50|lb|kg}} in weight. Occasionally, much heavier balls were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|journal=[[Atlas Obscura]]|author=Cara Giamo|title=The Best Sport of the Early 1900s Involved Pushing Around an Elephant-Sized Ball|date=9 December 2016|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/atlas_obscura/2016/12/09/the_sport_pushball_was_invented_specifically_to_be_amusing_to_spectators.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sides usually number eleven each, there being five forwards, two left-wings, two right-wings and two goal-keepers. The goals consist of two upright posts {{convert|18|ft|m}} high and {{convert|20|ft|m}} apart with a crossbar {{convert|7|ft|m}} from the ground. The game lasts for two periods with an intermission. Pushing the ball under the bar counts 5 points; lifting or throwing it over the bar counts 8. A touchdown behind goal for safety counts 2 to the attacking side.

[[File:Pushballwedstrijd.ogv|thumb|left|thumbtime=20|A pushball game in [[Volendam]], [[Netherlands]] in 1927]]The game was invented by [[M. G. Crane]] of [[Newton, Massachusetts]], in 1891, and was taken up at [[Harvard University]] the next year, but never attained any considerable vogue. [[Emory University]] students played pushball from 1923 to 1955 before the game was retired due to its increasingly rough nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Emory Magazine|url=http://www.emoryhistory.emory.edu/enigmas/Pushball.htm|title=Scoreless but not goreless|date=Autumn 2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207070601/http://emoryhistory.emory.edu/enigmas/Pushball.htm|archivedate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]] the first regular game was played at the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] in 1902 by teams of eight. The English rules are somewhat different from those obtaining in the United States. Pushball on horseback was introduced in 1902 at [[Durlands Riding Academy]] in New York, and has been played in England at the [[Military Tournament]].

"Pushball on horseback" variations continued in Europe, and recently resurfaced as a growing equine activity in the United States,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} with variations including "horse soccer", "equine soccer", and "hoofball". The various games provide great fun for both horse and rider,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} while serving as a valuable training tool that can be enjoyed by one or more horsemanship team players. The most important safety factor (aside from basic horsemanship foundation and equine communication skills) requires that the ball be at least as tall as the mount's breastbone. Some play with a durable {{convert|48|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} cageball – a tough bladder caged inside a separate nylon cover, available from sporting goods suppliers.

The '''Rafael Bolaños Stadium''' is a private multi use stadium located in El Coyol, in the outskirts of the city of [[Alajuela]], [[Costa Rica|Costa Rica.]]

It was inaugurated in 2003 and in 2017 it received an overhaul in the infrastructure. Is part of the [[Wílmer López|Wilmer López]] [[Sports complex|Sport Complex.]]

The stadium is used by [[A.D. Carmelita]] for his home games in the [[Liga FPD|Liga FDP]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nacion.com/puro-deporte/futbol-nacional/carmelita-al-fin-tendra-su-propio-estadio/4BJI7UNFD5D4DKVGP4BSZES2UM/story/|title=Carmelita al fin tendrá su propio estadio|work=La Nación, Grupo Nación|access-date=2018-10-26|language=es-LA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
When the Wilmer López Sport Complex was built, they had in thought building a place different than the other ones already existing. Is was built in mind of people enjoying the place and practicing sports, especially soccer (or football as is it called in Costa Rica). That's why it was built, taking the name of one of the most iconic soccer player that had ever played for the local team [[Liga Deportiva Alajuelense]].

It was inaugurated in 2003 within the Sport Complex, who already had 5 5v5 soccer fields, 1 7v7 soccer field, 1 9v9 soccer field, gym, a theater, restaurant, and a sports shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.complejowilmerlopez.com/index.php|title=Inicio|website=www.complejowilmerlopez.com|language=es-es|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the Sport Complex started building and renovating for a new soccer pitch that will allow a team to play their home games in the Costa Rican First Division of Soccer called [[Liga FPD|Liga FDP]] with a new artificial ground and a 2400 capacity seats.

It was inaugurated on January 2018 with a match between [[A.D. Carmelita]] against [[A.D. Municipal Pérez Zeledón]] for the winter season of the [[Liga FPD|Liga FDP]], with a 0-1 win for the visitors.

It was named "Rafael Bolaños" in honor of the father of the landlord and majority shareholder of the A.D. Carmelita team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nacion.com/puro-deporte/futbol-nacional/carmelita-presento-a-erick-cabalceta-nuevo/6ZWV4LKFQ5ENPLZSDFWYHKBWVM/story/|title=Carmelita presentó a Erick Cabalceta, nuevo uniforme y estadio|work=La Nación, Grupo Nación|access-date=2018-10-26|language=es-LA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sandsurfing''' or '''Desertsurfing''' is an [[extreme sport]] recently invented and involves "surfing on sand", mostly in [[deserts]]. It is similar to [[waterskiing]].

==Principles==
Sandsurfers attach a [[skateboard]] deck or other similar object to the back of an [[All-terrain vehicle|ATV]] or vehicle with a watersports tow rope.
The first sandsurfing in the Malibu area was done on san dunes approximately 35 miles north of Malibu off the coast highway in the early 1960s where young surfers would take their long boards and slide down the mountainside of sand when the surf was down.

==History and recognition==
Sandsurfing was invented and popularized by skateboarding and now Demigod of sandsurfing Joey Manalis. It was first recognized as an extreme sporting event in March '06 in the first annual sandsurfing tournament sponsored by ''[[Thrasher Magazine]]'', ''[[Skateboarder Magazine]]'', Pro Tec helmets, and DC shoe company. It was mentioned in the April '06 issue of ''Thrasher Magazine'' and the May '06 issue of ''SLAP'' magazine.

==Desert==
Sandsurfing is usually practiced in vast deserts where there is an abundance of sand dunes. Participants of this sport are to climb up the sand dune and surf downwards.
Sand Surfers must be extremely fit; as they must climb massive sand dunes in vast deserts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11213">'''Speed golf''' (also known as '''extreme golf''', '''fast golf'', ''fitness golf''' and '''hit and run golf''') is a variant of [[golf]] which scores both on strokes played and the time taken to complete the round.

==Rules==
One stroke is scored equally to one minute, such shooting 90 on a golf course in 59 minutes and 30 seconds would result in an overall speed golf score of 149:30.&lt;ref name = speedgolfinternational/&gt;

Rules and etiquette are generally the same for speed golf and regular golf with minor exceptions.&lt;ref name = speedgolfinternational/&gt;&lt;ref name="mygolfspy" /&gt; 
* In the interest of time, a golfer is allowed to putt with the flagstick left in the hole.
* Unless otherwise told by a tournament committee, speed golfers are expected to rake bunkers, fix ball marks and conform to normal golf course dress code, although most speed golfers will wear running shoes instead of golf shoes.
* In the case of a lost ball or one that is hit out of bounds, players are permitted to play it like a lateral hazard because it was thought to be too severe of a penalty to have to also be penalized the additional time to run back to where the original shot was played.

Aside from the normal 14-club maximum, there is no rule about how many clubs a player is allowed to bring. However, players typically carry 4–7 [[Golf club (equipment)|clubs]].

==History==
The sport was believed to have been started in 1979 [[California]] when former American record holder in the mile (3:47.69 in 1982) [[Steve Scott (athlete)|Steve Scott]] ran around a golf course in 29 minutes and 33 seconds shooting a 95 with only a 3-iron.&lt;ref name="mygolfspy" /&gt;

After hearing about Scott, a former ironman triathlete and teaching pro named Jay Larson became the person who many considered the top speed golfer of the 1990s. Larson once shot a 75 in 39 minutes and 9 seconds on a 6,500 course with a slope rating of 125 (using the old rules of speed golf where one could have a caddy in a cart riding out in front of you carrying your clubs and calling out distances as you approached the ball).&lt;ref name="mygolfspy" /&gt;

Towards the end of the 1990s, in an effort to help promote the sport, Oregonians and speed golfers Tim Scott (a former teaching pro turned school teacher), Christopher Smith, and Jim Kosciolek (a Chicago-based lawyer) founded a company called Speed Golf International.&lt;ref name="mygolfspy" /&gt;

Margaret Chodos may have been one of the oldest players of this sport, managing a hole-in-one at the age of 87, whilst racing around the golf course.

The sport is now played in [[North America]], [[Europe]] and [[Japan]], and major tournaments are telecast by channels such as [[ESPN]], [[CBS]], and [[The Golf Channel]].

==Tournaments==
The oldest known speed golf tournament is the Bob-n-Broc', which has been held each September in Minneapolis since 1998.

Throughout the 2000s, there were various competitions held throughout the United States, many of which were held at Bandon Dunes in Bandon, Oregon.&lt;ref name = speedgolfinternational/&gt;

===World championships===
'''2012 – Inaugural World Championships'''

The inaugural Speed Golf World Championships were held October 20–21, 2012 at Bandon Dunes Golf Resort in Bandon, Oregon on the Old MacDonald Course (October 20) and the Bandon Dunes Course (October 21).&lt;ref name="mygolfspy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bandondunesgolf.com/blog/bandon-dunes-host-inaugural-speedgolf-world-championships |title=Bandon Dunes Host Inaugural Speedgolf World Championships |publisher=[[Bandon Dunes Golf Resort]] |date= |accessdate=2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related sports==
Speed golf is sometimes contrasted with [[Cross-country BigBall]], in which players use soccer balls and baseball bats to reach a goal. Because the course and goals are chosen by the participants, Cross-country BigBall etiquette varies depending on whether the theater is a wooded or residential area.&lt;ref name=ccbb&gt;{{cite web | title = Cross-country BigBall Association | url=http://www.crosscountrybigball.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both sports require substantial physical stamina.

[[Speed disc]] golf is similar in concept and rules to speed golf.

The [[biathlon]] (skiing and shooting a rifle) is also sometimes compared to speed golf.

{{nihongo|'''Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium'''|東京体育館|Tōkyō Taiikukan}} is a sporting complex in [[Sendagaya]], [[Shibuya, Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. Built in 1954 for the World [[Amateur wrestling|Wrestling]] Championship, it was also used as the venue for [[Gymnastics at the 1964 Summer Olympics|gymnastics]] at the [[1964 Summer Olympics]], and will host the [[table tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics|table tennis]] competition at the [[2020 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Venue Plan|url=http://tokyo2020.jp/en/plan/venue/index.html|publisher=Tokyo 2020 Bid Committee|accessdate=11 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727040849/http://tokyo2020.jp/en/plan/venue/index.html|archivedate=27 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The gymnasium was rebuilt to a futuristic design created by [[Pritzker Prize]] winner [[Fumihiko Maki]] from 1986 to 1990.

The gymnasium is a one-minute walk from [[Sendagaya Station]] on the [[Chūō-Sōbu Line]] and [[Kokuritsu Kyogijo Station]] on the [[Toei Oedo Line]].

==Description and events==
The main arena includes a large indoor arena that hosts national and international sporting events. The arena holds 10,000 people (6,000 fixed, 4,000 temporary). An incomplete list of events held in the arena include:

*[[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] [[Toray Pan Pacific Open|Toray Pan Pacific]] Tennis Championships were held every February here, but from 2008 it has been held in the [[Ariake Coliseum]];

The sub-arena houses an olympic size (50mX20m, eight lanes) swimming pool with seating for 900 people. The Japan Waterpolo Championships is held here. There is also a 25m pool (25mX13m, 6 lanes), an outdoor oval running track; a weight training room, and conference rooms.

Since April 1, 2006, the Tokyo Lifelong Learning and Culture Foundation (東京都生涯学習文化財団), along with [[Suntory]] (サントリー株式会社), Tipness (株式会社ティップネス) and O-ence (株式会社オーエンス), manage the gymnasium.

On April 25 and 26, 2015, American singer-songwriter [[Katy Perry]] brought [[The Prismatic World Tour]] to the venue with two shows.

[[File:UCSB Events Center back by Dreamyshade.jpg|thumb|right|255px|The "back" side of the Thunderdome, from the point of view of one of the main student walkways.]]

'''UC Santa Barbara Events Center''', previously known as the '''Campus Events Center''', also known as '''The Thunderdome''', is a 5,600-seat, indoor multi-purpose [[arena]] on the campus of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]].

== History of The Thunderdome ==
The Thunderdome was built in 1979, originally under the name of Campus Events Center.  Along with [[Harder Stadium]], it has since become one of the most patronized venues at UC Santa Barbara.  After a naming contest and vote among students and faculty (which included some tongue in cheek nominations such as "Yankee Stadium", the Jerry Brown Arena, the Corrugated Fortress), it was eventually given the generic name "Campus Events Center".  Eventually, the name was unofficially shorted to the "ECen" (much like UCSB's [[University of California, Santa Barbara UCen|University Center]] being called the "UCen").

For basketball, the arena seats 5,600.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Floor Plans: Basketball |work=UC Santa Barbara Events Center |url=http://eventscenter.ucsb.edu/plan_an_event/plan_floorbb.html |accessdate=October 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other configurations result in differing capacities, most notably 5,814 as a maximum (for boxing or wrestling)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Floor Plans: Wrestling and Boxing |work=UC Santa Barbara Events Center |url=http://eventscenter.ucsb.edu/plan_an_event/plan_floorbox.html |accessdate=October 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 3,584 to 4,848 for concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Floor Plans: Concert (Alternate) |work=UC Santa Barbara Events Center |url=http://eventscenter.ucsb.edu/plan_an_event/plan_flooraltconc.html |accessdate=October 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Floor Plans: Concert (Standard) |work=UC Santa Barbara Events Center |url=http://eventscenter.ucsb.edu/plan_an_event/plan_floorconc.html |accessdate=October 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, the 5,600-seat arena is the third largest arena in the [[Big West Conference]], behind the 10,200-seat [[Stan Sheriff Center]] at the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa|University of Hawaii]] and the 8,000-seat [[The Pavilion at ARC|UC Davis Pavilion]].  The floor of the Thunderdome was named by [[Bleacher Report]] as the 11th best court design in [[college basketball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1689707-ranking-the-20-best-court-designs-in-college-basketball/page/11 |title=Ranking the 20 Best Court Designs in College Basketball |last=Novak |first=Thad |date=June 30, 2013 |website=[[Bleacher Report]] |accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transformation into The Thunderdome ===
At first, crowds were small, but with the hiring of [[Jerry Pimm]] in 1983, the [[UC Santa Barbara Gauchos men's basketball]] program began to experience greater success.  As the size of crowds began to increase (often exceeding the stated capacity), the Events Center gained a reputation as one of the loudest and most hostile venues in college basketball, creating significant problems for opposing teams.

After UCSB (led by future Laker [[Brian Shaw]]) upset [[Jim Valvano]]'s [[NC State Wolfpack men's basketball|North Carolina State Wolfpack]] team by double digits in 1987 before a sellout crowd, the Events Center acquired the unofficial nickname "The Thunderdome".   Credit has been given to the athletic director at that time, [[Stan Morrison]], for having coined the nickname.  Also many believe it was further reinforced from Valvano himself when he said in a postgame interview, "It was louder than thunder in there tonight."

=== The Tortilla Technical ===
During the 1980s, students threw toilet paper onto the court after the first Gaucho basket.  After the school cracked down on this practice around 1990, students started a new tradition of tossing [[tortilla]]s onto the court like frisbees after the first UCSB basket.&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite news|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1997-02-15/sports/sp-28879_1_santa-barbara|title=Santa Barbara's Pimm Is Pipping Hot Over Fresh Tortilla Controversy|last=Reid|first=Jason|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1997-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team would then be assessed a technical foul for delay of game while the tortillas were cleaned up, a tradition that became known as "The Tortilla Technical."&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, Ray. [http://lasvegassun.com/news/2011/nov/30/live-blog-unlv-basketball-face-big-time-test-first/ Live blog: Rebels survive UC Santa Barbara challenge, prevail 94-88 in double overtime].  [[Las Vegas Sun]], 2011-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

During an early 1990s game, one of ESPN's [[professional video camera]]s was ruined when tortilla fragments got into the mechanism.  While UCSB paid for a replacement camera, ESPN was skittish about returning to the Thunderdome.  Despite continued pleading from the players and coaches to stop the practice, the tradition continued unabated. When ESPN finally returned to the Thunderdome for a 1997 game against Pacific, the game was interrupted by three "Tortilla Technicals," including one incident late in the game where a tortilla nearly hit coach [[Jerry Pimm]] in the face.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Santa Barbara Upsets UOP 75-69 Despite Three Tortilla Technicals|last=Shi|first=Yier|publisher=The Daily Nexus|date=1997-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following this incident, UCSB officials began searching students for tortillas as they entered the arena.  Apart from a few sporadic instances of tortilla-tossing, the novelty has worn off.

While the tortillas have stopped flying at The Thunderdome, raucous students have brought the practice to [[Harder Stadium]], home of the 2006 NCAA champion [[UC Santa Barbara Gauchos men's soccer]] team, where no such penalties are enforced.

=== UC Santa Barbara Gauchos athletics ===
[[File:Thunderdome Graduation.jpg|thumb|left|Thunderdome hosting students about to graduate in June 2012.]]
The Thunderdome is the home to teams of the [[UC Santa Barbara Gauchos]] athletic program.  Currently, the [[UC Santa Barbara Gauchos men's basketball]] and [[UC Santa Barbara Gauchos women's basketball]] teams, as well as the [[UC Santa Barbara Gauchos women's volleyball]] team all call The Thunderdome home.  In 2002, 2,794 fans attended a women's volleyball match between UCSB and the [[USC Trojans volleyball|USC Trojans]] in which the 9th ranked Gauchos upset USC 3 games to 1.

=== Other events ===
The facility also hosted and the first and second-round games of the [[2004 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament]].  In addition to sporting events, The Thunderdome has seen many concerts, [[boxing]] matches, and performances come through.

[[Dave Chappelle]] performed comedy on June 2, 2004, while [[The Killers]] played at The Thunderdome on April 6, 2007 and the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] played an exhibition game on February 15, 2007.

The center hosts basketball camps by Michael Jordan and [[Kobe Bryant]]. These camps take place during the summer months. Michael Jordan's camp has happened yearly for several years and the Kobe Bryant camp has been happening since the summer of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eventscenter.ucen.ucsb.edu/index.php]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaeljordanbasketballcamp.com/vitalinfo.php]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kobeacademy.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;
