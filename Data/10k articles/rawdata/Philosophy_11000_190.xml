== Significance in dates ==
For various reasons, people ascribe different kinds of significance to dates and numbers; for example, the date of November 11, 2011, or "11/11/11", showed an increase in the number of [[marriage]]s taking place in different areas throughout the world, including the U.S.&lt;ref name="US 11-11-11 Marriages"&gt;{{cite web|title=11/11/11: 'Ones' in a lifetime|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-11-10/living/living_eleven-eleven-eleven_1_phone-numbers-carlson-special-celebration?_s=PM:LIVING|author=Basu, Moni|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2011-11-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111202621/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-11-10/living/living_eleven-eleven-eleven_1_phone-numbers-carlson-special-celebration?_s=PM%3ALIVING|archivedate=11 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and across the Asian continent.&lt;ref name="Asian 11-11-11 Marriages"&gt;{{cite web| title=11/11/11 spells marriage and magic| url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/RestOfAsia/11-11-11-spells-marriage-and-magic/Article1-768016.aspx| author=Savadove, Bill| publisher=Hindustan Times| accessdate=2011-11-11| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112050116/http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/RestOfAsia/11-11-11-spells-marriage-and-magic/Article1-768016.aspx| archivedate=12 November 2011| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many females were pregnant at this time, and babies born on this date also received special media attention.&lt;ref name="11-11-11 Baby"&gt;{{cite web|title=11/11/11 baby born at 11:11 a.m. on LI|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/11-11-11-baby-born-at-11-11-a-m-on-li-1.3314338| author=Murphy, William| publisher=Newsday| accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2000 Simpsonwood CDC conference''' (officially titled '''Scientific Review of Vaccine Safety Datalink Information''') was a two-day meeting convened in June 2000 by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), held at the Simpsonwood Methodist retreat and conference center in [[Norcross, Georgia]]. The key event at the conference was the presentation of data from the [[Vaccine Safety Datalink]] examining the possibility of a link between the mercury compound [[thiomersal|thimerosol]] in vaccines and neurological problems in children who had received those vaccines.

A [[Deadly Immunity|2005 article]] by [[Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.]], published by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and [[Salon.com]], focused on the Simpsonwood meeting as part of a conspiracy to withhold or falsify vaccine-safety information. However, Kennedy's article contained numerous major factual errors and, after a number of corrections, was ultimately retracted by Salon.com.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Offit-2008|Offit 2008]]: pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="salon-retraction"/&gt; Nonetheless, on the basis of Kennedy's claims, the conference gained notoriety in the [[anti-vaccination movement]].

== The conference ==

The conference was convened following a resolution by the [[Congress of the United States]] in 1997 requiring the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) to review the [[thimerosal]] content of approved drugs and biologics. Three vaccines of primary interest were discussed: [[hepatitis B vaccine]], [[DPT vaccine]], and the [[Hib vaccine]].

Attendees included experts in the fields of [[autism]], pediatrics, toxicology, epidemiology and vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Offit-2008|Offit 2008]]: p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Also in attendance were approximately half a dozen public-health organisations and pharmaceutical companies, as well as eleven consultants to the CDC, a [[rapporteur]],  and a statistician.&lt;ref&gt;[[#transcript|Transcript]]: pp. 3–10&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting served as a prelude to vaccine policy meetings held by the [[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices]] (ACIP), which sets U.S. vaccine policy for the CDC. The session was also to serve as the initial meeting of the ACIP work group on thimerosal and [[immunization]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#transcript|Transcript]]: p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Presentations and supporting documents from the conference were subject to a [[news embargo]] until June 21, 2000, at which point they were published by the ACIP.&lt;ref&gt;[[#transcript|Transcript]]: pp. 256–257&lt;/ref&gt; After the conference, researchers carried out a planned second phase to further analyze and clarify the study's preliminary findings. The results of this second analysis were published in 2003.&lt;ref name="Verstraeten 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/113/4/932 |journal=Pediatrics |issn=1098-4275 |oclc=38589589 |title=Thimerosal, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and GlaxoSmithKline |volume=113 |issue=4 |page=932 |author=Verstraeten T |date=April 2004 |accessdate=May 14, 2009|pmid=15060252|doi=10.1542/peds.113.4.932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the anti-vaccination movement ==
The June 20, 2005, issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' contained an article written by [[Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.]], entitled "[[Deadly Immunity]]". The article, which was also published on [[Salon.com]], focused on the Simpsonwood conference, and alleged that government and private industry had colluded to "thwart the Freedom of Information Act" and "withhold" vaccine-safety findings from the public.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;{{cite news |work=Rolling Stone | first = Robert | last = Kennedy | authorlink = Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. | title = Deadly Immunity | date = June 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy said that the Simpsonwood data linked thimerosal in vaccines to the rise in autism, but that the lead researcher later "reworked his data to bury the link between thimerosal and autism."&lt;ref name="Kennedy"/&gt; However, Kennedy's article contained numerous errors, including overstating the amount of [[ethylmercury]] in vaccines, wrongly claiming that a researcher held a patent on one of the discussed vaccines, and erroneously claiming that the [[rotavirus vaccine]] contained thimerosal.&lt;ref name="salon-corrections"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.salon.com/letters/corrections/2005/index.html | title = Salon: Corrections 2005 | publisher = [[Salon.com]] | accessdate =August 3, 2011 | date = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salon.com later said that the errors in the article "went far in undermining Kennedy’s exposé",&lt;ref name="salon-retraction"/&gt; and corrected it on five occasions. The publisher later retracted it in January 2011, stating that criticisms of the article and flaws in the science connecting autism and vaccines undermined its value.&lt;ref name="salon-retraction"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.salon.com/about/inside_salon/2011/01/16/dangerous_immunity/ |title=Correcting our record |quote=At the time, we felt that correcting the piece—and keeping it on the site, in the spirit of transparency—was the best way to operate. But subsequent critics […] further eroded any faith we had in the story's value. We've grown to believe the best reader service is to delete the piece entirely. |first=Kerry | last = Lauerman |date=January 1, 2011 |accessdate=August 3, 2011 |journal=[[Salon.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rolling Stone'', however, stood by its decision to publish Kennedy's article.

By the time the final study results discussed at Simpsonwood were published in 2003, the lead researcher, Thomas Verstraeten, had gone to work for [[GlaxoSmithKline]].&lt;ref name="Verstraeten 2004" /&gt; Kennedy contended that the delay in publication gave Verstraeten sufficient time to fix the data around the CDC's alleged objective of obscuring a link between thimerosal and autism. Verstraeten denied the allegations, and published an account of the matter in the journal ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]''.&lt;ref name="Verstraeten 2004" /&gt;

In September 2007, the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions rejected allegations of impropriety against Verstraeten and the CDC. Addressing Kennedy's statements, the Committee found that: "Instead of hiding the [Simpsonwood] data or restricting access to it, CDC distributed it, often to individuals who had never seen it before, and solicited outside opinion regarding how to interpret it. The transcript of these discussions was made available to the public."&lt;ref name="Senate 2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://help.senate.gov/Min_press/autism.pdf |format=PDF |author=Enzi MB |authorlink=Mike Enzi |publisher=U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions |title=Thimerosal and Autism Spectrum Disorders: Alleged Misconduct by Government Agencies and Private Entities   |accessdate=May 14, 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090327063553/http://help.senate.gov/Min_press/autism.pdf |archivedate = March 27, 2009|deadurl=yes |date=September  2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abu al-Hakam al-Kirmani''' ({{lang-ar|أبو الحكم الكرماني}}; d. 1066 CE) was a prominent philosopher and scholar from the Muslim [[al-Andalus]]. A student of [[Maslamah Ibn Ahmad al-Majriti]], he was a [[Neoplatonic]] advocate, and seen as an influence on [[Ibn 'Arabi]], but he also wrote extensively on [[geometry]] and [[logic]]. His exact date of death is not known as he fled to [[Morocco]] in the twelfth century. It is possible that it was he who returned to al-Andalus with the [[Epistles of the Brethren of Purity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Andalusi|first=Sa`id|author-link=Said Al-Andalusi|title=Science in the medieval world : book of the Categories of nations|year=1996|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|isbn=0292704690|editors=Sema`an I.

'''Alexander of Hales''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]]}} (also '''Halensis''', '''Alensis''', '''Halesius''', '''Alesius'''; {{circa|1185}}{{spaced ndash}}21 August 1245), also called ''Doctor Irrefragibilis'' (by [[Pope Alexander IV]] in the ''Bull De Fontibus Paradisi'') and ''Theologorum Monarcha'', was a theologian and philosopher important in the development of [[Scholasticism]] and of the [[Franciscan]] School.

==Life==
Alexander was born at Hales, [[Shropshire]] (today [[Halesowen]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]]), [[England]], between 1180 and 1186. He came from a rather wealthy country family. He studied at the University of Paris and became a master of arts sometime before 1210.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen,p.105&lt;/ref&gt; He began to read theology in 1212 or 1213, and became a regent master in 1220 or 1221. He introduced the [[Sentences]] of Peter Lombard as the basic textbook for the study of theology. During the University strike of 1229, Alexander participated in an embassy to Rome to discuss the place of Aristotle in the curriculum. Having held a prebend at Holborn (prior to 1229) and a canonry of St. Paul's in London (1226-1229), he visited England in 1230 and received a canonry and an archdeaconry in Coventry and Lichfield, his native diocese. He taught at Paris in the academic year 1232-33, but was appointed to a delegation by Henry III of England in 1235, along with Simon Langton and Fulk Basset, to negotiate for the renewal of the peace between England and France.

In 1236 or 1237, aged about 50, Alexander made the surprising step of entering the [[Franciscan]] Order, thus becoming the first Franciscan friar to hold a University chair. His doctrinal positions became the starting point for the Franciscan school of theology. He continued to teach and to represent the University, and participated in the [[First Council of Lyon]] in the winter of 1245.

After returning to Paris, Alexander fell ill, probably due to an epidemic then sweeping the city. Shortly before his death, he passed his chair on to [[John of La Rochelle]], setting the precedent for that chair to be held by a Franciscan.&lt;ref&gt;Principe p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander died at Paris on 21 August 1245.

As the first [[Franciscan]] to hold a chair at the [[University of Paris]], Alexander had many significant disciples. He was called ''Doctor Irrefragibilis'' (Irrefutable Teacher) and ''Doctor Doctorum'' (Teacher of Teachers).&lt;ref&gt;Brown and Flores, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; The latter title is especially suggestive of his role in forming several Franciscans who later became influential thinkers in the faculty, among them [[Saint Bonaventure]], John of La Rochelle, Odo Rigaldus, William of Middleton and [[Richard Rufus of Cornwall]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown and Flores, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Bonaventure, who may not have sat under Alexander directly, nevertheless referred to Alexander as his "father and master" and wished to "follow in his footsteps."&lt;ref&gt;Cullen,p.105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
[[Image:Alexander - Summa universae theologiae - 4316508.tif|thumb|''Summa universae theologiae'']]
{{Catholic philosophy}}
Alexander is known for reflecting the works of several other Middle Age thinkers, especially those of [[Anselm of Canterbury|Saint Anselm]] and [[Saint Augustine]]. He was also known to quote thinkers such as [[Bernard of Clairvaux|Saint Bernard]] and [[Richard of Saint-Victor]]. He differs from those in his genre as he is known to reflect his own interests and those of his generation.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Scholoasticism&lt;/ref&gt; When using the works of his authorities, Alexander does not only review their reasoning but also gives conclusions, expands on them, and offers his agreements and disagreement with them.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Scholasticism&lt;/ref&gt; He was also different in that he appeals to Pre-Lombardian figures, and in his use of [[Anselm of Canterbury]] and [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], whose works were not cited as frequently by other 12th-century scholastics.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Scholasticism&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle is also quite frequently quoted in Alexander's works. Alexander was fascinated by the Pseudo-Dionysian hierarchy of angels and in how their nature can be understood, given Aristotelian [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Scholasticism&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the doctrines which were specially developed and, so to speak, fixed by Alexander of Hales, are the ''thesaurus supererogationis perfectorum'' (treasury of supererogatory merits) and the ''[[character indelibilis]]'' (sacramental character) of [[baptism]], [[confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]], and [[Holy Orders|ordination]]. That doctrine had been written about much earlier by [[Augustine of Hippo]] and was eventually defined a [[dogma]] by the [[Council of Trent]]. He also posed an important question about the cause of the [[Incarnation]]: would Christ have been incarnated if humanity had never sinned? The question eventually became the focal point for a philosophical issue (the theory of possible worlds) and a theological topic on the distinction between God's absolute power (''potentia absoluta'') and His ordained power (''potentia ordinata'').

===Summa Universae Theologiae===
He had written the summary/commentary of Peter Lombard's four books of the ''Sentences''. It had exposed the trinitarian theology of the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Backus,p.301&lt;/ref&gt; This had been the most important writing that Alexander had claimed, and it had been the earliest in the genre. While it is common for scholars to state that Alexander was the first to write a commentary on the ''[[Sentences]]'' of [[Peter Lombard]], it is not quite accurate. Authorship is more contentious for this work; although he started this work, he died before it could be finished, and it most likely was more a product of people other than Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;Beiting p.5&lt;/ref&gt; There were a number of "commentaries" on the ''Sentences'', but Alexander's appears to have been the first magisterial commentary. Although it was Alexander's most significant writing, it had not been completed, therefore leaving historians with many questions on the reliability and quality of the writing. This was taken into consideration when the ''Summa'' had been examined by Father Victorin Doucet for different editions of them. The sources has seem to be the resulting problem of the ''Summa'', "counted there were 4814 explicit quotations and 1372 implicit quotations from [[Augustine]], more than one quarter of texts were cited in the body of the ''Summa''.&lt;ref&gt;"Backus,p.&amp;nbsp;303&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomprehensible inline|date=March 2016}}

Of Alexander's ''Summa'', which was on one occasion proclaimed by an assembly of seventy doctors to be infallible, [[Roger Bacon]] declared that, though it was as heavy as the weight of a horse, it was full of errors and displayed ignorance of physics, of metaphysics, and even of logic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Seymour Stevenson]], ''Robert Grosseteste: Bishop of Lincoln'' (1899) citing Roger Bacon's ''Opus Minus'' ed. Brewer pp. 325-327 &amp; ''Opus Tertium'' p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other historical works===
Alexander also influenced and sometimes is confused with [[Alexander Carpenter]], Latinized as ''Fabricius'' (fl. 1429), who was the author of the ''Destructorium viciorum'', a religious work popular in the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Robert Owst: ''The Destructorium viciorum of Alexander Carpenter'', Church Historical Society, [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]], London, 1952, 40 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Carpenter also authored other works, such as "''Homiliae eruditae''" ("Learned Sermons").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Carpenter, Alexander |volume=9|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Watson (ed.): ''The New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature, Volume 1, 600-1660''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1974, p. 803.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiographical contribution==
Alexander was said to have been among the earliest scholastics to engage with Aristotle's newly translated writings.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen,p.104&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1220 and 1227, he wrote ''Glossa in quatuor libros Sententiarum Petri Lombardi'' (''A Gloss on the [[Sentences|Four Books of the Sentences]] of [[Peter Lombard]]'') (composed in the mid-12th century), which was particularly important because it was the first time that a book other than the Bible was used as a basic text for theological study.&lt;ref&gt;Brown and Flores,p.10&lt;/ref&gt; This steered the development of scholasticism in a more systematic direction,&lt;ref&gt;Brown and Flores, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; inaugurating an important tradition of writing commentaries on the ''Sentences'' as a fundamental step in the training of master theologians.

===A medieval scholastic===
In doing so, he elevated Lombard's work from a mere theological resource to the basic framework of questions and problems from which masters could teach. The commentary (or more correctly titled a ''Gloss'') survived in student reports from Alexander's teaching in the classroom and so it provides a major insight into the way theologians taught their discipline in the 1220s. As is the case with ''Glossa'' and ''Quaestiones Disputatae'', much of his work is probably written in the form of notes on his oral teachings by students, though the content is definitely his.&lt;ref&gt;Principe 20&lt;/ref&gt;

For his contemporaries, however, Alexander's fame was his inexhaustible interest in disputation.  His disputations prior to his becoming a Franciscan cover over 1,600 pages in their modern edition.  His disputed questions after 1236 remain unpublished.  Alexander was also one of the first scholastics to participate in the ''Quodlibetal'', a university event in which a master had to respond to any question posed by any student or master over a period of three days.  Alexander's ''Quodlibetal questions'' also remain unedited.

===Theologian===
At the beginning of 1236, he entered the Franciscan order (he was at least 50) and was the first Franciscan to hold a chair at the University of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, p.104&lt;/ref&gt; He held this post until shortly before his death in Paris in 1245.&lt;ref&gt;Principe, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; When he became a Franciscan and thus created a formal Franciscan school of theology at Paris, it was soon clear that his students lacked some of the basic tools for the discipline.  Alexander responded by beginning a ''Summa theologiae'' that is now known as the ''Summa fratris Alexandri''.  Alexander drew mainly from his own disputations, but also selected ideas, arguments and sources from his contemporaries.  It treats in its first part the doctrines of [[God]] and his attributes; in its second, those of [[creation myth|creation]] and [[sin]]; in its third, those of [[Salvation|redemption]] and [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]]; and, in its fourth and last, those of the [[sacrament]]s. This massive text, which [[Roger Bacon]] would later sarcastically describe as weighing as much as a horse, was unfinished at his death; his students, William of Middleton and John of Rupella, were charged with its completion.  It was certainly read by the Franciscans at Paris, including [[Bonaventure]].

Alexander was an innovative theologian. He was part of the generation that first grappled with the writings of [[Aristotle]].  While there was a ban on using Aristotle's works as teaching texts, theologians like Alexander continued to exploit his ideas in their theology.  Two other uncommon sources were promoted by Alexander: [[Anselm of Canterbury]], whose writings had been ignored for almost a century, gained an important advocate in Alexander and he used Anselm's works extensively in his teaching on [[Christology]] and [[soteriology]]; and, [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], whom Alexander used in his examination of the theology of Orders and ecclesiastical structures.

Though he also continued the tradition of Aristotle- and Augustine-focused thought in the Franciscan school, he did so through an [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]]-directed lens.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen 104&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Alexander was one of the major influences for the advancement of Anselmian thought in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen,p.104&lt;/ref&gt; One such example is the idea of original sin as a lack of justice. Alexander believed that original sin is both a punishment as well as a cause for punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Beiting p.13&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, the body is corrupt, but the soul is clean. Alexander advances the idea that it would not be God's fault to create a being that would bind the ‘corrupt’ with the ‘clean’.&lt;ref&gt;Beiting p.7&lt;/ref&gt; He advanced a highly original response that the soul naturally desires the body.&lt;ref&gt;Beiting p.8&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, God is both merciful in giving the soul what it wants, as well as just in punishing the soul for binding with the corrupt flesh. Either the soul knew that the body was corrupt, or it did not (in which case it would be “laboring under ignorance”); both of these considerations are cause for divine punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Beiting p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander is also known for rejecting the idea that there are many things in God's mind, instead claiming that it is more perfect to know just one thing.&lt;ref&gt;Wood p.8&lt;/ref&gt; He did not start off with this view, though. In the ''Glossa'', he openly suggests the idea of the multiplicity of divine ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Wood p.8&lt;/ref&gt; In his later work, ''Quaestio disputata antequam erat Frater 46'', he finally rejects the plurality of divine ideas, and this theme continues through the rest of his works.&lt;ref&gt;Wood p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, in one of his last works, ''De scientia divina'', he concludes that the idea of [[wikt:plurality|plurality]] itself is strictly temporal, a human notion.&lt;ref&gt;Wood p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his more famous works, the ''Summa'', is important because of its system for determining if a war is just.&lt;ref&gt;Russell p.602&lt;/ref&gt; There are six requirements for determining this: authority and attitude (in reference to who declares the war), intention and condition (in reference to the soldiers), merit (of the enemy) and just cause.&lt;ref&gt;Russell p.602&lt;/ref&gt; Just cause becomes the overarching moral principle for declaring war in three ways: the relief of good people, coercion of the wicked, and peace for all.&lt;ref&gt;Russell p.603&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that Alexander put ‘peace for all’ at the end of the list to amplify its importance.&lt;ref&gt;Russell p.603&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arnold Dresden''' (1882–1954) was a Dutch-American mathematician in the first part of the twentieth century, known for his work in the [[calculus of variations]] and collegiate mathematics education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=David E. Zitarelli|title=In the Shadow of Giants: A Section of American Mathematicians, 1925-1950|journal=Mathematics Magazine|date=June 2005|volume=78|issue=3|pages=175–191|jstor=30044154|doi=10.2307/30044154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Edith R. Schneckenburger|title=News and Notices|journal=Amer. Math. Monthly|volume=61|year=1954|pages=497–498|jstor=2308099}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a president of the [[Mathematical Association of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/history/presidents/dresden.html MAA presidents: Arnold Dresden]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Dresden was born in [[Amsterdam]] on November 23, 1882, into a wealthy banking family. After matriculating for three years at the [[University of Amsterdam]] he used tuition money in 1903 to book passage on a ship to New York City. He then traveled to Chicago to help a friend, arriving 
there on his 21st birthday. Two years later, after saving money from working at various jobs, he enrolled in the graduate program at the [[University of Chicago]], where he earned his Ph.D. in 1909 under the direction of [[Oskar Bolza]] with thesis ''The Second Derivatives of the Extremal Integral''.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=5887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and teaching==
Dresden taught at the [[University of Wisconsin]] 1909–1927. During this time he wrote several papers on the calculus of variations and systems of linear differential equations. He directed one doctoral dissertation. He was recruited to [[Swarthmore College]] by [[Frank Aydelotte|President Frank Aydelotte]] to initiate an honors program in mathematics that ended up being a model for other colleges and universities throughout the U.S. Dresden remained at the elite Quaker college until retiring in 1952; he was adored by many of his students. In 1935–1936 he was on sabbatical at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], where he wrote ''An Invitation to Mathematics''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.ias.edu/files/pdfs/ar/publicationsofme00inst.pdf page 33, Publications of members, 1930–1954 Libraries, Institute for Advanced Study]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdm.itg.ias.edu/cdm/search/searchterm/Arnold Search on "Arnold Dresden" to find directory listing for Arnold Dresden as a Visiting Member of the Institute for Advanced Study.]&lt;/ref&gt; He died on April 10, 1954 in [[Swarthmore, Pennsylvania]], at age 71.
 
While at Wisconsin Arnold Dresden was active in and served as secretary of, the Chicago Section of the [[American Mathematical Society]]. A charter member of the Mathematical Association of America, he was elected President for 1933–1934. He also served as Vice-President during 1931 and as a member of the Board of Governors for 1935–1940 and 1943–1945. His retiring presidential address, “A program for mathematics,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dresden, Arnold|title=A Program for Mathematics|journal=Amer. Math. Monthly|date=Apr 1935|volume=42|issue=4|pages=198–208|jstor=2302098|doi=10.2307/2302098}}&lt;/ref&gt; encapsulated his deep concern about the place of mathematics in general culture and about the mathematical community's laissez-faire attitude toward the role it should play. A recurring theme was his belief that abstract concepts can be grasped by young people, which he preached in his 1936 book, An Invitation to Mathematics. He was also known as an ally to women in the field, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Margaret|title=Women Being Mathematicians:Creating a Professional Identity in Post-World War II America|date=2001|publisher=MIT Press|page=244|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sz78C8-PGUQC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;lpg=PA262&amp;dq=kentucky+women+mathematicians&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=juygOTdwTH&amp;sig=t-qHrDmJ4clbiWCwBr0sggW4BJQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwipwrW-p6HZAhUJzFMKHcKHB2UQ6AEIfjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=kentucky%20women%20mathematicians&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote three textbooks and translated [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|van der Waerden]]’s classic ''Science Awakening'' from Dutch into English.

[[Osama bin Laden]] took ideological guidance from individuals named [[Ibn Taymiyya]], [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah]], and [[Sayyid Qutb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeLong-Bas|first=Natana|title=Wahhabi Islam|year=2007|publisher=I. B. Tauris|location=London|pages=266, 273, 279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Laden also belonged to the [[Wahhabis|Wahhabi sect]] and was hence a follower of Ibn Abdul Wahhab Najdi.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1571144.stm&lt;/ref&gt; He subscribed to the [[Athari]] (literalist) school of Islamic theology.&lt;ref name="Halverson-80"&gt;{{cite book|last=Halverson|first=Jeffry R.|title=Theology and Creed in Sunni Islam: The Muslim Brotherhood, Ash'arism, and Political Sunnism |date=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IYzGAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=osama&amp;f=false| quote="It was there that he met the Athari-Wahhabite militant Osama bin Laden..."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To effectuate his beliefs, Osama bin Laden founded [[al-Qaeda]], a [[Sunni Islam]]ist militant organization.&lt;ref&gt;Scheuer, Michael, ''Through Our Enemies' Eyes: Osama Bin Laden, Radical Islam &amp; the Future of America'' (2003, Brassey's Inc. {{ISBN|1-57488-553-7}}); p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with several other Islamic leaders, he issued two [[fatwa]]s—[[Fatāwā of Osama bin Laden|in 1996 and then again in 1998]]—that [[Muslim]]s should fight those that either support [[Israel]] or support Western military forces in [[Muslim world|Islamic countries]], stating that those in that mindset are the enemy, including citizens from the [[United States]] and allied countries. His goal was for Western military forces to withdraw from the Middle East and for foreign aid to Israel to cease as it reflected negatively on Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html BIN LADEN'S FATWA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1998.html|title=Online NewsHour: Al Qaeda's 1998 Fatwa|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |accessdate=2006-08-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901093550/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1998.html |archivedate=1 September 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Sharia==
Following an extreme form of [[Islamism]], Bin Laden believed that the restoration of [[God in Islam|God]]'s law will set things right in the Muslim world. He stated, "When we used to follow [[Muhammad]]'s revelation we were in great happiness and in great dignity, to Allah belongs the credit and praise."&lt;ref name="LT246"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence Wright|title=The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11|publisher=Knopf|location=|year=2006|pages=246|isbn=0-375-41486-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed "the only Islamic country" in the [[Muslim world]] was [[Afghanistan]] under the rule of [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]]'s [[Taliban]] before that regime was overthrown in late 2001.&lt;ref name="MWSOBL143"&gt;{{cite book|author=Osama Bin Laden, Bruce Lawrence|title=Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama bin Laden|publisher=Verso|location=|year=2005|pages=143|isbn=1-84467-045-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences with Wahhabi Ideology==
Bin Laden's connection with contemporary [[Wahhabi]] Islam is disputed. Some believe his ideology is different in crucial ways. While modern Wahhabi doctrine states that only political leaders can call for ''jihad'', bin Laden believed he could declare jihad. Modern  Wahhabism forbids disobedience to a ruler unless the rule has commanded his/her subjects to violate religious commandments.&lt;ref name=Commins&gt;{{cite book|last=Commins|first=David|title=The Wahhabi Mission and Saudi Arabia|year=2006|publisher=I. B. Tauris|isbn=1-84511-080-3|pages=185, 190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the basic goals of bin Laden are different to contemporary Wahhabists. Bin Laden was most interested in "resisting western domination and combating regimes that fail to rule according to Islamic law,"&lt;ref name=Commins /&gt; while Wahhabism focuses on correct methods of worshiping God, removing idols, and ensuring adherence to Islamic law.&lt;ref name=Commins /&gt;

On the other hand, some believe&lt;ref name="Gold-12"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gold|first1=Dore|title=Hatred's Kingdom|date=2003|publisher=Regnery Publishing|location=Washington, DC|page=12|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;  bin Laden "adopted Wahhabi terminology" when they called America `the [[Hubal]] of the age`, since Hubal was a stone idol and idolatry ([[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]) was the primary Wahhabi sin.&lt;ref name="Gold-12"/&gt;

==Jihad==
In a January 2004 message Bin Laden called for the establishment of provisional underground ruling councils in Muslim countries to be made up of "[[ulema]], leaders who are obeyed among their people, dignitaries, nobles, and merchants." The councils would be sure "the people" had "easy access to arms, particularly light weapons; anti-armored rockets, such as [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPGs]]; and [[anti-tank mine]]s" to fight "raids" by "the Romans," i.e. United States.&lt;ref name="MWSOBL230"&gt;{{cite book|author=Osama Bin Laden, Bruce Lawrence |title=Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama bin Laden|publisher=Verso|location=|year=2005|pages=230|isbn=1-84467-045-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His interviews, video messages and other communications always mentioned and almost always dwelt on need for [[jihad]] to right what he believed were injustices against Muslims by the United States and sometimes other non-Muslim states,&lt;ref&gt;''Messages to the World'', (2005), p.xix, xx, editor Bruce Lawrence&lt;/ref&gt; the need to eliminate the state of [[Israel]], and to force the withdrawal of the U.S. from the [[Middle East]]. Occasionally other issues arose; he called for Americans to "reject the immoral acts of [[fornication]], [[homosexuality]], [[Psychoactive drug|intoxicants]], [[gambling]], and [[usury]]," in an October 2002 letter.&lt;ref&gt;Oct. 6, 2002. Appeared in Al-Qala'a website and then the London Observer Nov. 24, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MWSOBL166"&gt;{{cite book|author=Osama Bin Laden, Bruce Lawrence|title=Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama bin Laden|publisher=Verso|location=|year=2005
|pages=166|isbn=1-84467-045-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grievances against countries==

===East Timor===
In  his November 2001 statement, Osama bin Laden criticized the [[UN]] and [[Australian]] "[[Crusades|Crusader]]" forces for ensuring the independence of the mostly Catholic [[East Timor]] from the mostly Muslim state of [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/1636782.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Bin Laden rails against Crusaders and UN |date=2001-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Bin Laden considered India to be a part of the 'Crusader-Zionist-Hindu' conspiracy against the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/articles/2008/1130_india_terrorism_riedel.aspx Terrorism in India and the Global Jihad] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111191820/http://www.brookings.edu/articles/2008/1130_india_terrorism_riedel.aspx |date=November 11, 2011}}, [[Brookings Institution]], November 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saudi Arabia===
Bin Laden was born in Saudi Arabia and had a close relationship with the Saudi royal family, but his opposition to the Saudi government stemmed from his radical ideology. The Saudi decision to allow the U.S. military into the country in 1990 to defend against a possible attack by [[Saddam Hussein]] upset bin Laden, although he was not necessarily opposed to the royal family at this time or going to war with Iraq and even offered to send his mujahedeen from Afghanistan to defend Saudi Arabia should Iraq attack, an offer which was rebuked by [[King Fahd]]. From his point of view, "for the Muslim Saudi monarchy to invite non-Muslim American troops to fight against Muslim Iraqi soldiers was a serious violation of Islamic law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeLong-Bas|first=Natana|title=Wahhabi Islam|year=2007|publisher=I. B. Tauris|location=London|pages=267–269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden, in his 1996 [[fatwa|declaration]] entitled "Declaration of War against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places",&lt;ref name=PBS1996fatwa&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html |title=Online NewsHour: Bin Laden's Fatwa |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812060339/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html|archivedate=12 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified several grievances that he had about [[Saudi Arabia]], the birthplace and holy land of Islam. Bin Laden said these grievances about Saudi Arabia:

{{cquote|
# The intimidation and harassment suffered by the leaders of the society, the scholars, heads of tribes, merchants, academic teachers and other eminent individuals;
# The situation of the law within the country and the arbitrary declaration of what is Halal and Haram (lawful and unlawful) regardless of the Shari'ah as instituted by Allah;
# The state of the press and the media which became a tool of truth-hiding and misinformation; the media carried out the plan of the enemy of idolising cult of certain personalities and spreading scandals among the believers to repel the people away from their religion, as Allah, the Exalted said: {surely- as for- those who love that scandal should circulate between the believers, they shall have a grievous chastisement in this world and in the here after} (An-Noor, 24:19).
# Abuse and confiscation of human rights;
# The financial and the economical situation of the country and the frightening future in the view of the enormous amount of debts and interest owed by the government; this is at the time when the wealth of the Ummah being wasted to satisfy personal desires of certain individuals!! while imposing more custom duties and taxes on the nation. (the prophet said about the woman who committed adultery: "She repented in such a way sufficient to bring forgiveness to a custom collector!!").
# The miserable situation of the social services and infra-structure especially the water service and supply, the basic requirement of life.,
# The state of the ill-trained and ill-prepared army and the impotence of its commander in chief despite the incredible amount of money that has been spent on the army. The gulf war clearly exposed the situation.,
# Shari'a law was suspended and man made law was used instead.,
# And as far as the foreign policy is concerned the report exposed not only how this policy has disregarded the Islamic issues and ignored the Muslims, but also how help and support were provided to the enemy against the Muslims; the cases of Gaza-Ariha and the communist in the south of [[Yemen]] are still fresh in the memory, and more can be said.&lt;ref name=PBS1996fatwa/&gt;&lt;ref name="understanding-terrorism.blogspot.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://understanding-terrorism.blogspot.com/2008/07/why-is-osama-bin-laden-fighting.html |title=Understanding Terrorism: Why dies Osama bin Laden hate the USA and other Western nations? |publisher=Understanding-terrorism.blogspot.com |date=2008-07-19 |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;|cquote}}

Bin Laden wanted to overthrow the Saudi monarchy (and the governments of Middle Eastern states)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iasps.org/strategic/pmwbinladen.htm |title=Welcome to IASPS |publisher=Iasps.org |date=2001-09-27 |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and establish an "Islamic Republic" according to Shari'a law (Islamic Holy Law), to "[[Pan-Islamism|unite all Muslims]] and to establish a government which follows the rule of the [[Caliph]]s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/ladin.htm |title=al-Qa'ida (The Base) / World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders / Usama bin Laden |publisher=Fas.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100824212419/http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/ladin.htm| archivedate= 24 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
 commentary belongs not here. if there is an actual point, attributable to someone not you, refactor it into one //
&gt;However the US and other Western nations are supporting such regimes (in addition to killing Muslims through sanctions, wars, covert operations, bombing, and such) such as Saudi Arabia that bin Laden wants to overthrow.Thus, according to bin Laden, Muslims must fight against such "oppressors" by killing Americans (and other people), including innocent people. According to this line of thought, if the US and other Western governments could get out of the Middle East, then repressive and "un-Islamic" regimes could be overthrown, and the only way to get Western governments out of the Middle East is to attack the citizens of those countries.&lt;
--&gt;

===Soviet Union===
{{See also|Soviet–Afghan War}}
In 1979, bin Laden opposed the Soviet Union invading Afghanistan and would soon heed the call to arms by Afghan freedom fighters. Bin Laden would use his own independent wealth and resources to get Arab fighters from Egypt, Lebanon, Kuwait and Turkey to join the Afghans in their battle against the Soviets. While bin Laden praised the U.S. intervention early on, being happy that the Afghans were getting aid from all over the world to battle the Soviets, his view of the U.S. soon grew sour, stating "Personally neither I nor my brothers saw evidence of American help. When my mujahedin were victorious and the Russians were driven out, differences started..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/antisoviet-warrior-puts-his-army-on-the-road-to-peace-the-saudi-businessman-who-recruited-mujahedin-now-uses-them-for-largescale-building-projects-in-sudan-robert-fisk-met-him-in-almatig-1465715.html |location=London |work=The Independent |first=Robert |last=Fisk |title=Anti-Soviet warrior puts his army on the road to peace: The Saudi businessman who recruited mujahedin now uses them for large-scale building projects in Sudan.

After two years into the Soviet war, bin Laden headed to Sudan to continue his work as a construction engineer and an agriculturalist, building bridges alongside some of the people he had fought alongside during the war.

===United Kingdom===
Bin Laden believed that Israeli Jews controlled the British government, directing it to kill as many Muslims as it could. He cited British participation in 1998's [[Operation Desert Fox]] as proof of this allegation.&lt;ref name=Time1999&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,17676,00.html|title=Conversation With Terror|work=Time|date=January 1999|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States of America===
{{see also|Motivations of the September 11 attacks}}
Bin Laden's stated motivations of the September 11 attacks include the support of Israel by the United States, the presence of the U.S. military in the [[Saudi Arabia]]n borders, which he considered to be sacred Islamic territory, and the U.S. enforcement of [[Sanctions against Iraq|sanctions against]] [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]].  He first called for ''jihad'' against the United States in 1996. This call solely focused on U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia; bin Laden loathed their presence and wanted them removed in a "rain of bullets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeLong-Bas|first=Natana|title=Wahhabi Islam|year=2007|publisher=I. B. Tauris|location=London|pages=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden's hatred and disdain for the U.S. were also manifested while he lived in [[Sudan]]. There he told Al-Qaeda fighters-in-training:&lt;ref name="LT187"&gt;Wright, ''The Looming Tower'', p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|America appeared so mighty ... but it was actually weak and cowardly. Look at [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], look at [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|Lebanon]]. Whenever soldiers start coming home in body bags, Americans panic and retreat. Such a country needs only to be confronted with two or three sharp blows, then it will flee in panic, as it always has. ... It cannot stand against warriors of faith who do not fear death.}}

====Grievances against the United States====
In his 1998 fatwa entitled, "Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/980223-fatwa.htm |title=World Islamic Front Statement Urging Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders |publisher=Fas.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100907000331/http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/980223-fatwa.htm| archivedate= 7 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; bin Laden identified three grievances against the U.S.:

{{cquote|First, for over seven years the United States has been occupying the lands of Islam in the holiest of places, the Arabian Peninsula, plundering its riches, dictating to its rulers, humiliating its people, terrorizing its neighbors, and turning its bases in the Peninsula into a spearhead through which to fight the neighboring Muslim peoples.
&lt;br /&gt;If some people have in the past argued about the fact of the occupation, all the people of the Peninsula have now acknowledged it. The best proof of this is the Americans' continuing aggression against the Iraqi people using the Peninsula as a staging post, even though all its rulers are against their territories being used to that end, but they are helpless.

&lt;br /&gt;Second, despite the great devastation inflicted on the Iraqi people by the crusader-Zionist alliance, and despite the huge number of those killed, which has exceeded 1 million... despite all this, the Americans are once against trying to repeat the horrific massacres, as though they are not content with the protracted blockade imposed after the ferocious war or the fragmentation and devastation.
&lt;br /&gt;So here they come to annihilate what is left of this people and to humiliate their Muslim neighbors.

&lt;br /&gt;Third, if the Americans' aims behind these wars are religious and economic, the aim is also to serve the Jews' petty state and divert attention from its occupation of [[Jerusalem]] and murder of Muslims there. The best proof of this is their eagerness to destroy Iraq, the strongest neighboring Arab state, and their endeavor to fragment all the states of the region such as Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Sudan into paper statelets and through their disunion and weakness to guarantee Israel's survival and the continuation of the brutal crusade occupation of the Peninsula.
|cquote}}

Bin Laden criticized the United States in a "letter to the American people" published in late 2002,&lt;ref name=Letter2002&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130826184301/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver October 6, 2002. Appeared in Al-Qala'a website and then ''The Observer'' and ''The Guardian'' on November 24, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt; and further outlined his grievances with the United States in a 2004 speech directed towards the American people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Full transcript of bin Ladin's speech|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2004/11/200849163336457223.html|accessdate=31 March 2016|work=Al Jazeera|date=1 November 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101093303/http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2004/11/200849163336457223.html|archivedate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Favorable opinion of two American authors====
In 2011, in a review of a new book from former [[United States Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer [[Michael Scheuer]], professor and writer [[Fouad Ajami]] wrote that "[i]n 2007, [bin Laden] singled out two western authors whose knowledge he had high regard for: [[Noam Chomsky]] and" Scheuer.&lt;ref&gt;Ajami, Fouad, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/books/review/Ajami-t.html?ref=books "Osama Bin Laden: The Specter"], review of Michael Scheuer, ''Osama Bin Laden'', (2011, Oxford University Press {{ISBN|978-0-19-973866-3}}); ''The New York Times Book Review'', February 11, 2011 (February 13, 2011 p. BR20). Retrieved 2011-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

====John F. Kennedy conspiracy theory====
Bin Laden supported the conspiracy theory that [[John F. Kennedy]] was killed by the "owners of the major corporations who were benefiting from its ([[Vietnam War]]) continuation":
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the Vietnam War, the leaders of the White House claimed at the time that it was a necessary and crucial war, and during it, [[Donald Rumsfeld]] and his aides murdered two million villagers. And when Kennedy took over the presidency and deviated from the general line of policy drawn up for the White House and wanted to stop this unjust war, that angered the owners of the major corporations who were benefiting from its continuation.

And so Kennedy was killed, and al-Qaida wasn't present at that time, but rather, those corporations were the primary beneficiary from his killing. And the war continued after that for approximately one decade. But after it became clear to you that it was an unjust and unnecessary war, you made one of your greatest mistakes, in that you neither brought to account nor punished those who waged this war, not even the most violent of its murderers, Rumsfeld.&lt;ref name="Transcript"&gt;[http://www.notpopular.com/board/viewtopic.php?topic=45940&amp;forum=11&amp;17 Transcript]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Killing of non-Islamic believers==
According to bin Laden's ideology, non-Islamic believers may be deliberately killed in support of jihadism. This position evolved from an earlier, less violent one. In a 1998 interview, he alleged that in fighting jihad, "we differentiate between men and women, and between children and old people," unlike hypocritical "infidels" who "preach one thing and do another."&lt;ref&gt;''Messages'', (2005) p.70. ''Al Jazeera'' interview, December 1998, following Kenya and Tanzania embassy attacks.&lt;/ref&gt; But two years later he told another interviewer that those who say "killing a child is not valid" in Islam "speak without any knowledge of Islamic law", because killing non-Islamic believers may be done in vengeance.&lt;ref&gt;''Messages'', (2005), p.119, October 21, 2001 interview with Taysir Alluni of Al Jazeera&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, bin Laden's interpretation of Islamic doctrine allows retaliation against U.S. citizens because of perceived indiscriminate U.S. aggression against Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;"The Wahhabi Mission and Saudi Arabia", (2006) David Commins. p.189&lt;/ref&gt; To another question by a Muslim interviewer about Muslims killed in the September 11 attacks, bin Laden replied that "Islamic law says that Muslim should not stay long in the land of infidels," although he suggested Muslim casualties in the attack were [[collateral damage]].&lt;ref&gt;"The main targets [of 9/11] were the symbols of the United States: their economic and military power. ..." from Interview published in ''Al-Quds Al-Arabi'' in London Nov. 12, 2001 (originally published in Pakistani daily, ''Ausaf,'' Nov. 7, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other ideologies==
In his messages, bin Laden has opposed "[[pan-Arabism]], [[socialism]], [[communism]], [[democracy]] and other doctrines," with the exception of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;''Messages'', 2005, p.218. "Resist the New Rome, audiotape delivered to al-Jazeera and broadcast by it on 4 January 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Democracy and "legislative council[s] of representatives," are denounced, calling the first "the religion of ignorance," and the second "councils of polytheism."&lt;ref&gt;''Messages to the World'', (2005), p.208-9. "Quagmires of the Tigris and Euphrates," October 19, 2003, videotape delivered to al-Jazeera.&lt;/ref&gt; In what one critic has called a contradiction,&lt;ref&gt;''New York Review of Books'', 9 March 2006, "Their Master's Voice" by [[Max Rodenbeck]], review of ''Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama bin Laden''
&lt;/ref&gt; he has also praised the principle of governmental "accountability," citing the Western democracy of [[Spain]]: "Spain is an infidel country, but its economy is stronger than ours because the ruler there is accountable."&lt;ref&gt;''Messages'', (2005), p.227. "Resist the New Rome", audiotape delivered to al-Jazeera and broadcast by it on 4 January 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to music===
Bin Laden opposed [[music]] on religious grounds. Despite his love of [[horse racing]] and ownership of racing horses, the presence of a band and music at the [[Khartoum]] race track annoyed him so much that he stopped attending races in Sudan. "Music is the flute of the devil," he told his Sudanese stable-mate Issam Turabi.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''The Looming Tower'', p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for environmentalism===
Osama bin Laden and his aides have, on more than one occasion, denounced the United States for [[Environmental degradation|damaging the environment]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;You have destroyed nature with your [[industrial waste]] and [[Greenhouse gases|gases]] more than any other nation in history. Despite this, you refuse to sign the [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto agreement]] so that you can secure the profit of your greedy companies and industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Full text: bin Laden's 'letter to America' | date=2002-11-24 | accessdate=2010-04-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100418164357/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver| archivedate= 18 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], Osama bin Laden's aide, said [[global warming]] reflected &lt;blockquote&gt;how brutal and greedy the Western Crusader world is, with America at its top &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/2008/04/23/osama-bin-laden-s-aide-ayman-al-zawahiri-rants-on-global-warming-89520-20391770/ Osama bin Laden's aide Ayman al-Zawahiri rants on global warming - Mirror.co.uk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bin Laden has also called for a boycott of American goods and the destruction of the American economy as a way of fighting global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2010/01/29/2010-01-29_al_qaeda_leader_osama_bin_laden_blasts_us_in_tape_for_global_warming.html#ixzz0e2rB28Lx | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden blasts U.S. in audiotape spewing hate for... global warming | first=Brian | last=Kates | date=2010-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
On the subject of [[technology]], bin Laden is said to have ambivalent feelings –being interested in "earth-moving machinery and [[genetic engineering]] of plants, on the one hand," but rejecting "[[chilled water]] on the other."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''The Looming Tower'', p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; In Afghanistan, his sons' education reportedly eschewed the arts and technology and amounted to "little other than memoriz[ing] the [[Quran]] all day".&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''The Looming Tower'', p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Masturbation===
Osama bin Laden believed that [[masturbation]] was justifiable in "extreme" cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/02/01/osama-bin-ladens-secret-masturbation-fatwa/ |access-date=February 2, 2017 |publisher=''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' |title=Osama bin Laden’s Secret Masturbation Fatwa |first=Simon |last=Cottee |date=February 1, 2017 |quote=It is well-known that bin Laden was a fastidious and overbearing micromanager. But few would have suspected that it extended this far. And although it has been widely reported that he was in possession of a porn stash at his Abbottabad compound, it will no doubt come as a surprise that bin Laden, the foremost jihadi of his generation, had thought long and hard (no pun intended) on the issue of masturbation, as has current al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. Bin Laden’s edict, though, raises more questions than it clarifies: If knocking one out in times of “extreme need” is permitted, how does one define the emergency of “extreme need”: Is it a week, a month, or a mere day of celibacy? Alas, bin Laden’s letter doesn’t shed any light on these burning questions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ubl2017/english/Letter%20to%20Abu%20Muhammad%20Salah.pdf |page=3 |quote=Dr. Ayman has written us his opinion, and a summary of what we took from it (although this is only initial, not final, and cannot be ultimately relied upon) is this: God is not ashamed of the truth. As we see it, we have no objection to clarifying to the brothers that they may, in such conditions, masturbate, since this is an extreme case. The ancestors approved this for the community. They advised the young men at the time of the conquest to do so. It has also been prescribed by the legists when needed, and there is no doubt that the brothers are in a state of extreme need. |author=[[Osama bin Laden]] |title=Letter to Abu Muhammad Salah |publisher=[[Director of National Intelligence]] |access-date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jews, Christians, and Shia Muslims==
Bin Laden was profoundly [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]], and delivered many warnings against alleged Jewish conspiracies: "These Jews are masters of [[usury]] and leaders in treachery. They will leave you nothing, either in this world or the next."&lt;ref&gt;''Messages'', (2005), p.190. from 53-minute audiotape that "was circulated on various websites." dated Feb. 14, 2003. "Among a Band of Knights."&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, bin Laden's organization worked with [[Shia]] militants: "Every Muslim, from the moment they realize the distinction in their hearts, hates Americans, hates Jews, and hates Israelis. This is a part of our belief and our religion."&lt;ref&gt;''Messages" (2005), p.87. Al Jazeera interview December 1998, following Kenya and Tanzania embassy attacks&lt;/ref&gt; and was apparently inspired by the successes of Shia radicalism—such as the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]], the implementation of Sharia by [[Ayatollah Khomeini]], and the [[human wave attack]]s committed by radical Shia teenagers during the 1980s [[Iran–Iraq War]]. While in Sudan, "senior managers in al Qaeda maintained contacts with" Shia Iran and [[Hezbollah]], its closely allied Shia "worldwide terrorist organization. ... Al Qaeda members received advice and training from Hezbollah."&lt;ref name="9/11 Commission Report, p.240"&gt;''9/11 Commission Report'', p.240&lt;/ref&gt; where they are thought to have borrowed the techniques of suicide and simultaneous bombing.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''The Looming Tower'', p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the Shia-[[Wahhabi]] enmity, this collaboration could only go so far. According to the US 9/11 Commission Report, Iran was rebuffed when it tried to strengthen relations with al Qaeda after the October 2000 attack on {{USS|Cole|DDG-67|6}}, "because Bin Laden did not want to alienate his supporters in Saudi Arabia."&lt;ref name="9/11 Commission Report, p.240" /&gt;

'''Bertrand de Jouvenel des Ursins''' (31 October 1903 – 1 March 1987) was a French philosopher, [[political economist]], and [[Futures studies|futurist]].

==Life==
Bertrand was the heir of an old family from the French nobility, coming from the [[Champagne, France|Champagne region]]. He was the son of [[Henri de Jouvenel]] and [[Sarah Boas]], the daughter of a Jewish industrialist. Henri divorced Sarah in 1912 to become the second husband of French writer [[Colette]]. In 1920, when he was a mere 16, Bertrand began an affair with his stepmother, who was then in her late 40s. The affair ended Colette's marriage and caused a scandal. It lasted until 1924. Some believe Bertrand to be the role model for the title character in Colette's novel ''[[Chéri (novel)|Chéri]]'', but in fact she had published about half the book, in serial form, before she and her stepson met for the first time, in the spring of 1920. Their affair actually inspired Colette's novel ''[[Le Blé en herbe]]''. In the 1930s, he participated in the ''Cahiers Bleus'', the review of [[Georges Valois]]' [[Republican Syndicalist Party]]. From 1930 to 1934, Jouvenel had an affair with the American war correspondent [[Martha Gellhorn]]. They would have married had his wife agreed to a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed account of Jouvenel's affair with Martha Gellhorn see [[Caroline Moorehead]]: ''Martha Gellhorn: A Life'', Chatto &amp; Windus, London 2003, {{ISBN|0-7011-6951-6}} (hardback).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his memoirs, ''[[The Invisible Writing]]'', [[Arthur Koestler]] recalled that in 1934, Jouvenel was among a small number of French intellectuals who promised moral and financial support to the newly established ''Institut pour l'Étude du Fascisme'', a supposedly self-financing enterprise of the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]]. Other personalities to offer support were Professor [[Paul Langevin|Langevin]], the [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie|Joliot]]-[[Irène Joliot-Curie|Curies]], [[André Malraux]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Koestler, ''The Invisible Writing'', Collins and Hamish Hamilton, London 1954. Republished in 1969 by Hutchinson (Danube edition) {{ISBN|0-09-098030-1}}. p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;

However, that same year, Jouvenel was impressed by the [[6 February 1934 crisis|riot of the antiparliamentary leagues that occurred on 6 February 1934]], became disillusioned with traditional political parties and left the Radical Party. He began a paper with [[Pierre Andreu]] called ''La Lutte des jeunes'' (The Struggle of the Young) while at the same time contributing to the right wing paper ''Gringoire'', for which he covered the 1935 Nuremberg Congress in Germany where the infamous Nuremberg Laws were passed. He began frequenting royalist and nationalist circles, where he met [[Henri de Man]] and [[Pierre Drieu la Rochelle]].&lt;ref&gt;''Le siècle des intellectuels'' by Michel Winock, ed. Seuil, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was in favour of Franco-German rapprochement and created the "Cercle du grand pavois", which supported the ''Comité France–Allemagne'' (Franco-German Committee). Here he became friends with [[Otto Abetz]], the future German ambassador to Paris during the occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand de Jouvenel, Un voyageur dans le siècle (1903–1945), tome 1, éditions Robert Laffont, Paris, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1936 he interviewed Adolf Hitler for the journal ''Paris-Midi'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voxnr.com/cc/d_allemagne/EkFVlFpuAZnRVBkvAQ.shtml|title=Les grandes interviews du siècle: Adolf Hitler|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032503/http://www.voxnr.com/cc/d_allemagne/EkFVlFpuAZnRVBkvAQ.shtml|archivedate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which he was criticised for being too friendly to the dictator.

That same year he joined [[Jacques Doriot]]'s [[Parti populaire français]] (PPF).&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Kestel, " L'engagement de Bertrand de Jouvenel au PPF de 1936 à 1939, intellectuel de parti et entrepreneur politique ", French Historical Studies, n.30, hiver 2007, pp. 105–25&lt;/ref&gt; He became the editor in chief of its journal ''L'Émancipation nationale'' (National Emancipation), wherein he supported fascism. He broke with the PPF in 1938 when Doriot supported the Munich Agreement.

Jouvenel's mother passionately supported Czechoslovakian independence, and so he began his career as a private secretary to [[Edvard Beneš]], [[Czechoslovakia]]'s first prime minister. In 1947, along with [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Jacques Rueff]], and [[Milton Friedman]], he founded the [[Mont Pelerin Society]]. Later in life, de Jouvenel established the [[Futuribles International]] in Paris.

After the French defeat in 1940 Jouvenel stayed in Paris and under German occupation published Apres la Defaite, calling for France to join Hitler's New Order.He fled to Switzerland just before the liberation of Paris by the Allies. Jouvenel was among the very few French intellectuals to pay respectful attention to the economic theory and [[welfare economics]] that emerged during the first half of the 20th century in Austria, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This understanding of economics is shown by his work ''The Ethics of Redistribution''.

[[Dennis Hale (political scientist)|Dennis Hale]] of Boston College has co-edited two volumes of essays by Jouvenel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/political-science/people/faculty-directory/dennis-hale.html|title=Dennis Hale|publisher=Boston College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in his life, Jouvenel's views shifted back to the left. In 1960, he complained to Milton Friedman that the Mont Pelerin Society had "turned increasingly to a [[Manichaeism]] according to which the state can do no good and private enterprise can do no wrong."&lt;ref name="Rosenblatt"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rosenblatt |first1=Helena |title=French Liberalism from Montesquieu to the Present Day |date=2012 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=214–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sympathetic to the [[protests of 1968|student protests of 1968]] and critical of the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=De Dijn |first1=Annelien |title=Bertrand de Jouvenel and the Revolt Against the State in Post-War America |journal=Ethical Perspectives |date=2010 |volume=17 |issue=3 |page=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also expressed support for the Socialist [[François Mitterrand]].&lt;ref name="Rosenblatt" /&gt;

===The Sternhell controversy===
[[Zeev Sternhell]] published a book, ''Ni Droite, ni gauche'' ("Neither Right nor Left"), accusing De Jouvenel of having had fascist sympathies in the 1930s and 1940s. De Jouvenel sued in 1983, claiming nine counts of [[libel]], two of which the court upheld. However, Sternhell was required neither to publish a retraction, nor to strike any passages from future printings of his book.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wohl, 1991, "French Fascism, Both Right and Left: Reflections on the Sternhell Controversy", ''The Journal of Modern History 63'': 91–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bodymind''''' is a compound of [[Human body|body]] and [[mind]] and may be used differently in different meditation traditions.  These different understandings often inform each other. The Buddhist philosopher, [[Herbert V. Günther]], has stated:   
&lt;blockquote&gt;
What we call 'body' and 'mind' are mere abstractions from an identity experience that cannot be reduced to the one or the other abstraction, nor can it be hypostatized into some sort of thing without falsifying its very being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mipham|1973|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Modern Western cultures inherited the concept of [[Cartesian dualism]] which isn't evident in many other cultures. As a result of [[multiculturalism]] and [[globalization]], the [[bodymind]] philosophies found in other cultures, such as in [[Navajo]] and [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] societies, have been integrated into the bodymind concept adopted by the Western [[New Age movement]].

==Vajrayana and Zen Buddhism==
In [[Vajrayana]], [[Mahayana]], [[Theravada]] and [[Zen Buddhism]] the concept of bodymind, or ''[[namarupa]]'', is key. In Vajrayana, ''namarupa'' is informed by the related doctrines of [[heartmind]] and [[Yogachara]]'s [[mindstream]]. Within these traditions, Bodymind is held as a [[Mindstream|continuüm]] and field phenomenon.  Arpaia and Rapgay discuss the connection of mindbody in the eighth chapter of their book, ''Tibetan Wisdom for Modern Life '', entitled "Health: strengthening the mind-body connection". &lt;!-- What do they say ?--&gt;

David E. Shaner, PhD, coined the compound term "bodymind" in his thesis work at the University of Hawai'i, "The Bodymind Experience in Japanese Buddhism", which he defended in 1979 and published in 1985. Shaner translated the term 心身統一合氣道, Shinshintouitsu Aikidō.{{fact|date=January 2013}}

'''Brendan Cathbad Myers''' is a [[philosopher]] and author known for his contributions in environmental philosophy, [[Druidry]] and [[Neo-Druidism]], [[mythology]], and applied [[virtue ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/brendan-myers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy and writings==
Normative in their conception, Myers' works fundamentally examine ideas regarding the interconnectedness of creation and emphasize the importance of strong moral character as vital to the health and well-being of the world and society.  Myers criticizes utilitarian views, especially "negative" [[utilitarianism]], which holds that ethics require nothing more than the minimization of harm, and of deontological views, which emphasize social duties and adhering to social norms, i.e. rules. As an alternative to utilitarianism and deontology, Myers explores the [[ethics]] of character and identity, self-knowledge and shared life.

"My question was whether the environment is ethically significant, and what that must ultimately mean for the choices we make individually, politically and collectively. I wanted to know whether there is a 'right' way of living in and with the natural world.
"I invented a way to think about our ethical responsibilities to future generations – in
which an act that harms no one or infringes no one's rights is still considered to be morally wrong."

"The morally correct way to treat the environment is to shape it into the kind of world in which we may flourish best as human beings."

"Rather, I think we should involve ourselves in the world, shaping it and making use of its natural processes as a gardener might do, in order to make the whole landscape of the Earth into a garden fit to be the dwelling place of a peaceful and fully flourishing human community."

"It cannot be for lack of scientific or technical know-how that pollution and resource depletion continues to ruin our landscapes and make life hard for millions of people. If we want to change the world for the better, all we need do is muster the political will." P 14 March/April 2006 issue 29 ''SEPAView'' The Magazine of the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.

==Biographical information==
Born in 1974, in [[Guelph]], [[Ontario]], Canada, Brendan was raised in [[Elora Ontario]], a small village north of Guelph in [[Wellington County, Ontario]]. He was born the eldest son of an Irish-Canadian family and completed a bachelor's degree in drama and philosophy in 1996 and then a master's degree in philosophy in 1999, both from the [[University of Guelph]]. While at university, he became more involved in [[ethics]] and [[environmentalism]] and he converted from [[Catholicism]] to [[paganism]], becoming an [[activist]] member of the [[neo-pagan]] community. Myers continued his academic career in Ireland, and eventually completed a doctoral dissertation entitled "Time and the Land" at the [[National University of Ireland]], Galway.

==Professional life==
His first published work was a play entitled ''Visions of a Better Way'', which won a competition for [[high school]] students run by [[University of Guelph]]'s department of [[English studies|English]].

Myers attended the University of Guelph for undergraduate studies in [[drama]], starting in January 1992

He further attended [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]], reading [[folklore]] there in 1994.

Myers then began his [[Master's degree|master's]] studies at Guelph in 1998, majoring in [[philosophy]]. In 2000, he published a dissertation titled "Animism, Spirit, and Environmental Activism", and was matriculated.

For the two years following, he served as [[president]] of a [[labour union]] ([[CUPE]] local.)

Myers began [[doctoral studies]] in philosophy at the [[National University of Ireland]], [[Galway]] in 2001, touring the [[Europe|European continent]], especially [[England]] and [[Germany]].

He completed doctoral studies in 2005 with a dissertation entitled "Time and the Land: Four Approaches to Environmental Ethics, Climate Change, and Future Generations".

==Pagan activism==
Myers returned to Canada in late 2005, and taught philosophy at several universities and colleges in Ontario and Quebec. In 2007, he worked as a contract researcher for the [[Government of Canada]] studying [[Aboriginal values]] and [[ethics]], [[morals]] and [[logic]] in relation to [[police work]] and [[peacekeeping]] and [[consensus government]].

In 2008 he was awarded the [[Mount Haemus Award for research in Druidry]], from the [[OBOD]] in association with [[Salisbury Cathedral]].

Myers currently lives in [[Gatineau]], [[Quebec]], where he is [[professor]] of philosophy and [[humanities]] at [[CEGEP Heritage College]]. He claims to be the only openly [[pagan]] philosophy professor in the world.

==Academic influence==
Myers' works have been quoted in the published works of numerous [[neopagan]] writers, including [[Emma Restall-Orr]] (in "Living with Honour"), [[Philip Carr-Gomm]] (in "What do Druids Believe?"), [[Graeme Talboys]] (in "The Way of the Druid"), [[Janet Farrar]] and [[Gavin Bone]] (in "Progressive Witchcraft"), and [[Isaac Bonewits]] (in "Bonewits Essential Guide to Druidism"). His work also appears on pages 185 to 191 of "Out of the Broom Closet" edited by [[Arin Murphy-Hiscock]].

==Accolades from other artists and activists==
"Brendan Myers is smarter than me."
- Isaac Bonewits, at the "Fire in the Hearth" conference, Ottawa, July 2009.

"While Myers' ideas may not resonate with everyone, he should be commended for being at the forefront of an effort to write better Pagan books. He, along with some other authors of note, are writing those "advanced" books we all keep saying we want."
- Jason Pitzl-Waters, author of The Wild Hunt Blog (on 30 November 2008), the most read pagan blog on the Internet.

"Myers' analysis confronts our very raison d'être against our uncertain times. He asks the questions that most prefer not to ask."
- Michael York, Professor of Theology, Bath Spa University.

"Our guest [Brendan Myers] is a man of letters, a man for the people, a man who respects Mother Earth, and all her children. In my mind he is the perfect role model and a true purveyor of ancient teaching with passion and integrity."
- Yvonne Boyer, hostess of God Box Cafe podcast, in Episode 80 (6 November 2009).

In [[computing]], '''Ceph''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|f}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɛ|f}}) is a [[free-software]] [[Computer data storage|storage]] [[computing platform|platform]], implements [[object storage]] on a single distributed [[computer cluster]], and provides interfaces for object-, [[block storage|block-]] and [[Computer file|file]]-level storage. Ceph aims primarily for completely distributed operation without a [[single point of failure]], scalable to the [[exabyte]] level, and freely available.

As a result of its design, the system is both self-healing and [[self-management (computer science)|self-managing]], aiming to minimize administration time and other costs.

On April 21, 2016, the Ceph development team released "Jewel", the first Ceph release in which CephFS is considered stable.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} The CephFS repair and disaster recovery tools are feature-complete ([[Snapshot (computer storage)|snapshots]], multiple active [[metadata]] servers and some other functionality is disabled by default).&lt;ref name=Jewel&gt;{{cite web|date=2016-04-21 |author = Sage Weil |title=v10.2.0 Infernalis Released|url=http://ceph.com/releases/v10-2-0-jewel-released/ |publisher=Ceph Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The August, 2017 release (codename "Luminous") introduced the production-ready BlueStore storage format which avoids many shortcomings of the old filesystem-based filestore, providing better latency and additional storage features.&lt;ref name="luminous"/&gt;

All of these are fully distributed, and may run on the same set of servers. Clients directly interact with all of them.&lt;ref name=lwn&gt;{{cite web |date=2007-11-14 |author=Jake Edge |title=The Ceph filesystem |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/258516/ |publisher=[[LWN.net]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceph does [[striping]] of individual files across multiple nodes to achieve higher throughput, similar to how [[RAID0]] stripes partitions across multiple [[hard drive]]s. Adaptive [[load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] is supported whereby frequently accessed objects are replicated over more nodes.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} 
{{As of|2017|9}}, BlueStore is the default and recommended storage type for production environments,&lt;ref name=luminous/&gt; which is Ceph's own storage implementation providing better latency and configurability than the filestore backend, and avoiding the shortcomings of the filesystem based storage involving additional processing and caching layers. The Filestore backend is still considered useful and very stable; [[XFS]] is the recommended underlying filesystem type for production environments, while [[Btrfs]] is recommended for non-production environments. [[ext4]] filesystems are not recommended because of resulting limitations on the maximum RADOS objects length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hard Disk and File System Recommendations|url=http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/rados/configuration/filesystem-recommendations/|publisher=ceph.com|accessdate=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{Anchor|RADOS}}Object storage ===
[[File:Ceph stack.png|thumb|right|upright=1.9|An architecture diagram showing the relations between components of the Ceph storage platform]]

Ceph implements distributed [[object storage]]. Ceph’s software libraries provide client applications with direct access to the ''reliable autonomic distributed object store'' (RADOS) object-based storage system, and also provide a foundation for some of Ceph’s features, including ''RADOS Block Device'' (RBD), ''RADOS Gateway'', and the ''Ceph File System''.

The  "librados" [[software libraries]] provide access in [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[PHP]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]]. The RADOS Gateway also exposes the object store as a [[REST]]ful interface which can present as both native [[Amazon S3]] and [[Openstack#Object storage (Swift)|OpenStack Swift]] APIs.

=== {{Anchor|RBD}}Block storage ===
Ceph’s object storage system allows users to mount Ceph as a [[Thin provisioning|thin-provisioned]] [[block device]]. When an application writes data to Ceph using a block device, Ceph automatically stripes and replicates the data across the cluster. Ceph's ''RADOS Block Device'' (RBD) also integrates with [[Kernel-based Virtual Machine]]s (KVMs).

Ceph RBD interfaces with the same Ceph object storage system that provides the librados interface and the CephFS file system, and it stores block device images as objects. Since RBD is built on librados, RBD inherits librados's abilities, including read-only snapshots and revert to snapshot. By striping images across the cluster, Ceph improves read access performance for large block device images.

The block device can be virtualized, providing block storage to virtual machines, in virtualization platforms such as [[Apache CloudStack]], [[OpenStack]], [[OpenNebula]], [[Ganeti]], and [[Proxmox Virtual Environment]].

=== {{Anchor|CephFS}}File system ===
Ceph's file system (CephFS) runs on top of the same object storage system that provides object storage and block device interfaces. The Ceph metadata server cluster provides a service that maps the directories and file names of the file system to objects stored within RADOS clusters. The metadata server cluster can expand or contract, and it can rebalance the file system dynamically to distribute data evenly among cluster hosts. This ensures high performance and prevents heavy loads on specific hosts within the cluster.

Clients mount the [[POSIX]]-compatible file system using a [[Linux kernel]] client. On March 19, 2010, [[Linus Torvalds]] merged the Ceph client into Linux kernel version 2.6.34&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2010-02-19 |author=Sage Weil |title=Client merged for 2.6.34 |url=http://ceph.newdream.net/2010/03/client-merged-for-2-6-34/ |publisher=ceph.newdream.net }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was released on May 16, 2010. An older [[Filesystem in Userspace|FUSE]]-based client is also available. The servers run as regular Unix [[daemon (computer software)|daemons]].

== History ==
Ceph made its debut at the 2006 USENIX Conference on Operating System Design (OSDI 2006) in a paper by Weil, Brandt, Miller, Long and Maltzahn;&lt;ref&gt;1.   "Ceph: A scalable, high-performance distributed file system,SA Weil, SA Brandt, EL Miller, DDE Long, C Maltzahn, Proc. OSDI 2006&lt;/ref&gt; a more detailed description was published the following year in [[Sage Weil]]'s [[doctoral dissertation]],.&lt;ref name=thesis&gt;{{cite web |date=2007-12-01 |author = Sage Weil |title=Ceph: Reliable, Scalable, and High-Performance Distributed Storage |url=https://ceph.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/weil-thesis.pdf |publisher=[[University of California, Santa Cruz]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his graduation in fall 2007, Weil continued to work on Ceph full-time, and the core development team expanded to include Yehuda Sadeh Weinraub and Gregory Farnum. In 2012, Weil created [[Inktank Storage]] for professional services and support for Ceph.&lt;ref name=inktanklaunch&gt;{{cite web |date=2012-05-03 |author=Bryan Bogensberger |title=And It All Comes Together |url=http://www.inktank.com/uncategorized/and-it-all-comes-together-2/ |publisher=Inktank Blog |access-date=2012-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719100928/http://www.inktank.com/uncategorized/and-it-all-comes-together-2/# |archive-date=2012-07-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The 10 Coolest Storage Startups Of 2012 (So Far) |author= Joseph F.

In April 2014, [[Red Hat]] purchased Inktank, bringing the majority of Ceph development in-house.&lt;ref name=redhatacquisition&gt;{{cite web |date=2014-04-30 |accessdate=2014-08-19 |author = Red Hat Inc |title=Red Hat to Acquire Inktank, Provider of Ceph |url=http://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-acquire-inktank-provider-ceph |publisher=Red Hat }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, the Ceph Community Advisory Board was formed to assist the community in driving the direction of open source software-defined storage technology. The charter advisory board includes Ceph community members from global IT organizations that are committed to the Ceph project, including individuals from [[Canonical (company)|Canonical]], [[CERN]], [[Cisco]], [[Fujitsu]], [[Intel]], [[Red Hat]], [[SanDisk]], and [[SUSE]].&lt;ref name=advisoryboardformed&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.storagereview.com/ceph_community_forms_advisory_board|date=2015-10-28 |accessdate=2016-01-20|title=Ceph Community Forms Advisory Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Infernalis'' (v9.2.0){{snd}} on November 6, 2015, the Ceph development team released Infernalis, the ninth major stable release of Ceph. it will be the foundation for the next stable series. There have been some major changes since v0.94.x Hammer, and the upgrade process is non-trivial.&lt;ref name=infernalis&gt;{{cite web|date=2015-11-06 |author = Sage Weil |title=v9.2.0 Infernalis Released|url=http://ceph.com/releases/v9-2-0-infernalis-released/ |publisher=Ceph Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Jewel'' (v10.2.0){{snd}} on April 21, 2016, the Ceph development team released Jewel, the first Ceph release in which CephFS is considered stable. The CephFS repair and disaster recovery tools are feature-complete (bidirectional failover, [[N+1 redundancy|active/active]] configurations), some functionalities are disabled by default. This release includes new experimental RADOS backend named BlueStore which is planned to be the default storage backend in the upcoming releases.&lt;ref name="Jewel"/&gt;
* ''Kraken'' (v11.2.0){{snd}} on January 20, 2017, the Ceph development team released Kraken. The new BlueStore storage format, introduced in Jewel, has now a stable on-disk format and is part of the test suite. Despite still marked as experimental, BlueStore is near-production ready, and should be marked as such in the next release, Luminous.&lt;ref name=kraken&gt;{{cite web|date=2017-01-20 |author = Abhishek L |title=v11.2.0 Kraken Released|url=http://ceph.com/releases/v11-2-0-kraken-released/ |publisher=Ceph Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Luminous'' (v12.2.0){{snd}} on August 29, 2017, the Ceph development team released Luminous.&lt;ref name=luminous&gt;{{cite web|date=2017-08-29 |author = Sage Weil |title=v12.2.0 Luminous Released|url=http://ceph.com/releases/v12-2-0-luminous-released/ |publisher=Ceph Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other features the BlueStore storage format (using the raw disk instead of a filesystem) is now considered stable and recommended for use.

== Etymology ==
The name "Ceph" is an abbreviation of "[[cephalopod]]", a class of [[Mollusca|molluscs]] that includes the octopus. The name (emphasized by the logo) suggests the highly parallel behavior of an octopus and was chosen to connect the file system with UCSC's mascot, a [[banana slug]] called "Sammy".&lt;ref name="ibm-developerworks"/&gt; Both cephalopods and banana slugs are molluscs.

Standard histories of philosophy make him the midpoint in the development of [[German idealism]], situating him between [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], his mentor in his early years, and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], his former university roommate, early friend, and later rival. Interpreting Schelling's philosophy is regarded as difficult because of its evolving nature.

Schelling's thought in the large has been neglected, especially in the English-speaking world, as has been his later work on mythology and revelation, much of which remains untranslated. An important factor was the ascendancy of Hegel, whose mature works portray Schelling as a mere footnote in the development of idealism. Schelling's ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'' also has been attacked by scientists for its analogizing tendency and lack of empirical orientation.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=schelling |title=Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling |last=Bowie  |first=Andrew|date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some later philosophers have shown interest in re-examining Schelling's body of work.

==Life==

===Early life===
Schelling was born in the town of [[Leonberg]] in the [[Duchy of Württemberg]] (now [[Baden-Württemberg]]), the son of Joseph Friedrich Schelling and his wife Gottliebin Marie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[Richard H. Popkin]]|title=The Columbia History of Western Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ok4F_SawQaEC&amp;pg=PA529 |date=31 December 2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-10129-5|page=529}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[monastic school]] at [[Bebenhausen]], near [[Tübingen]], where his father was chaplain and an [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] professor.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=316}} From 1783 to 1784 Schelling attended a Latin school in [[Nürtingen]] and knew [[Friedrich Hölderlin]], who was five years his senior. On 18 October 1790,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Morley]] (ed.), ''[[The Fortnightly Review]]'', Voll. 10, 12, London: [[Chapman &amp; Hall]], 1870, [https://books.google.com/?id=LJxCAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA500&amp;dq=1790+%22On+the+18th+October,+Schelling%22 p. 500].&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of 15, he was granted permission to enroll at the [[Tübinger Stift]] (seminary of the [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg]]), despite not having yet reached the normal enrollment age of 20. At the Stift, he shared a room with [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] as well as Hölderlin, and the three became good friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Hegel |url=https://books.google.com/?id=N1ohAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |editor=[[Frederick C. Beiser]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1993 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=N1ohAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT419&amp;dq=%22Hegel%22%22Tübinger+Stift.+1789–1790+shares+a+roomwith+Hölderlin+and+Schelling+and+forms+friendship+with+them%22 419] |isbn=978-1-139-82495-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schelling studied the [[Church fathers]] and [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophers]]. His interest gradually shifted from Lutheran theology to philosophy. In 1792 he graduated with his [[master's thesis]], titled ''Antiquissimi de prima malorum humanorum origine philosophematis [[Book of Genesis|Genes.]] III. explicandi tentamen criticum et philosophicum'',&lt;ref&gt;''History of Philosophy: From Thales to the Present Time'', Volume 2, C. Scribner's Sons, 1874, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The thesis is available online at the [http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/resolve/display/bsb10888795.html Munich Digitization Center].&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1795 he finished his [[doctoral thesis]], titled ''De Marcione Paulinarum epistolarum emendatore'' (''On [[Marcion of Sinope|Marcion]] as emendator of the [[Pauline letters]]'') under [[Gottlob Christian Storr]]. Meanwhile, he had begun to study [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]], who influenced him greatly.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=316–318}}

In 1797, while tutoring two youths of an aristocratic family, he visited [[Leipzig]] as their escort and had a chance to attend lectures at [[Leipzig University]], where he was fascinated by contemporary physical studies including chemistry and biology. He also visited [[Dresden]], where he saw collections of the [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony|Elector of Saxony]], to which he referred later in his thinking on art. On a personal level, this Dresden visit of six weeks from August 1797 saw Schelling meet the brothers [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]] and [[Karl Friedrich Schlegel]] and his future wife Caroline (then married to August Wilhelm), and [[Novalis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert J. Richards]], ''The Romantic Conception of Life: Science and Philosophy in the Age of Goethe'' (2002), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jena period===
After two years tutoring, in October 1798, at the age of 23, Schelling was called to [[University of Jena]] as an extraordinary (i.e., unpaid) professor of philosophy. His time at Jena (1798–1803) put Schelling at the center of the intellectual ferment of [[Romanticism]]. He was on close terms with [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], who appreciated the poetic quality of the ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'', reading ''Von der Weltseele''. As the prime minister of the [[Duchy of Saxe-Weimar]], Goethe invited Schelling to Jena. On the other hand, Schelling was unsympathetic to the ethical idealism that animated the work of [[Friedrich Schiller]], the other pillar of [[Weimar Classicism]]. Later, in Schelling's ''Vorlesung über die Philosophie der Kunst'' (''Lecture on the Philosophy of Art'', 1802/03), Schiller's theory on the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] was closely reviewed.

In Jena, Schelling was on good terms with Fichte at first, but their different conceptions, about nature in particular, led to increasing divergence in their thought. Fichte advised him to focus on philosophy in its original meaning, that is, transcendental philosophy: specifically, Fichte's own ''Wissenschaftlehre''. But Schelling, who was becoming the acknowledged leader of the Romantic school, had begun to reject Fichte's thought as cold and abstract.

Schelling was especially close to August Wilhelm Schlegel and his wife, [[Caroline Schelling|Caroline]]. A marriage between Schelling and Caroline's young daughter, Auguste Böhmer, was contemplated by both. Auguste died of [[dysentery]] in 1800, prompting many to blame Schelling, who had overseen her treatment. Robert Richards, however, argues in his book ''The Romantic Conception of Life'' that Schelling's interventions were not only appropriate but most likely irrelevant, as the doctors called to the scene assured everyone involved that Auguste's disease was inevitably fatal.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, p. 171 note 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Auguste's death drew Schelling and Caroline closer. Schlegel had moved to Berlin, and a divorce was arranged (with Goethe's help). Schelling's time at Jena came to an end, and on 2 June 1803 he and Caroline were married away from Jena. Their marriage ceremony was the last occasion Schelling met his school friend Hölderlin, who was already mentally ill at that time.

In his Jena period, Schelling had a closer relationship with Hegel again. With Schelling's help, Hegel became a private lecturer (''Privatdozent'') at [[Jena University]]. Hegel wrote a book titled ''Differenz des Fichte'schen und Schelling'schen Systems der Philosophie'' (''Difference between Fichte's and Schelling's Systems of Philosophy'', 1801), and supported Schelling's position against his idealistic predecessors, Fichte and [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold]]. Beginning in January 1802, Hegel and Schelling published the ''Kritisches Journal der Philosophie'' (''Critical Journal of Philosophy'') as co-editors, publishing papers on the philosophy of nature, but Schelling was too busy to stay involved with the editing and the magazine was mainly Hegel's publication, espousing a thought different from Schelling's. The magazine ceased publication in the spring of 1803 when Schelling moved from Jena to [[Würzburg]].

===Move to Würzburg and personal conflicts===
After Jena, Schelling went to [[Bamberg]] for a time, to study Brunonian medicine (the theory of [[John Brown (doctor)|John Brown]]) with {{ill|Adalbert Friedrich Marcus|de}} and [[Andreas Röschlaub]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wallen |first=Martin |title=City of Health, Fields of Disease: Revolutions in the Poetry, Medicine, and Philosophy of Romanticism|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4hFdAAAAMAAJ |year=2004 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |isbn=978-0-7546-3542-0 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=4hFdAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22After+the+breakup+of+the+Jena+circle,+Schelling+traveled+to+Bamberg+specifically+to+study+Brunonian+medicine+with+two+of+its+major+proponents+in+Germany,+Andreas+Roschlaub+and+Adalbert+Marcus%22 123]}}&lt;/ref&gt; From September 1803 until April 1806 Schelling was professor at the new [[University of Würzburg]]. This period was marked by considerable flux in his views and by a final breach with Fichte and Hegel.

In Würzburg, a conservative Catholic city, Schelling found many enemies among his colleagues and in the government. He moved then to [[Munich]] in 1806, where he found a position as a state official, first as associate of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] and secretary of the [[Academy of Fine Arts Munich|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]], afterwards as secretary of the Philosophische Klasse (philosophical section) of the Academy of Sciences. 1806 was also the year Schelling published a book in which he criticized Fichte openly by name. In 1807 Schelling received the manuscript of Hegel's ''[[Phaenomenologie des Geistes]]'' (''Phenomenology of the Spirit'' or ''Mind''), which Hegel had sent to him, asking Schelling to write the foreword. Surprised to find remarks directed at his own philosophical theory, Schelling eventually wrote back, asking Hegel to clarify whether he had intended to mock Schelling's followers who lacked a true understanding of his thought, or Schelling himself. Hegel never replied. In the same year, Schelling gave a speech about the relation between the visual arts and nature at the Academy of Fine Arts; and Hegel wrote a severe criticism of it to one of his friends. After that, they criticized each other in lecture rooms and in books publicly until the end of their lives.

===Munich period===
Without resigning his official position in Munich, he lectured for a short time in [[Stuttgart]] (''Stuttgarter Privatvorlesungen'' [Stuttgart private lectures], 1810), and seven years at the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|University of Erlangen]] (1820–1827).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In 1809 Karoline died,{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=317}} just before he published ''Freiheitschrift'' (''Freedom Essay'') the last book published during his life. Three years later, introduced by Goethe,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Schelling married one of her closest friends, [[Pauline Gotter]], in whom he found a faithful companion.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=317}}

During the long stay at [[Munich]] (1806–1841) Schelling's literary activity came gradually to a standstill. It is possible that it was the overpowering strength and influence of the Hegelian system that constrained Schelling, for it was only in 1834, after the death of Hegel, that, in a preface to a translation by [[Hubert Beckers]] of a work by [[Victor Cousin]], he gave public utterance to the antagonism in which he stood to the Hegelian, and to his own earlier, conception of philosophy. The antagonism certainly was not then a new fact; the Erlangen lectures on the history of philosophy of 1822 express the same in a pointed fashion, and Schelling had already begun the treatment of [[mythology]] and [[religion]] which in his view constituted the true positive complements to the negative of logical or speculative philosophy.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=317}}

===Berlin period===
Public attention was powerfully attracted by these vague hints of a new system which promised something more positive, especially in its treatment of religion, than the apparent results of Hegel's teaching. The appearance of critical writings by [[David Friedrich Strauss]], [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Feuerbach]], and [[Bruno Bauer]], and the evident disunion in the Hegelian school itself, express a growing alienation from the then dominant philosophy. In Berlin, the headquarters of the Hegelians, this found expression in attempts to obtain officially from Schelling a treatment of the new system which he was understood to have in reserve. The realization of the desire did not come about till 1841, when the appointment of Schelling as Prussian privy councillor and member of the Berlin Academy, gave him the right, a right he was requested to exercise, to deliver lectures in the university.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=317}} Among those in attendance at his lectures were [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (who said Schelling talked "quite insufferable nonsense" and complained that he did not end his lectures on time),&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates]]'' by Søren Kierkegaard, 1841.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mikhail Bakunin]] (who called them "interesting but rather insignificant"), [[Jacob Burckhardt]], [[Alexander von Humboldt]]&lt;ref&gt;Lara Ostaric, ''Interpreting Schelling: Critical Essays'', Cambridge University Press, 2014, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131104230106/http://www.egs.edu/library/friedrich-wilhelm-joseph-schelling/biography/ "Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling - Biography"] at [[European Graduate School|egs.edu]]&lt;/ref&gt; (who never accepted Schelling's [[natural philosophy]]),&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaas A. Rupke, ''Alexander von Humboldt: A Metabiography'', University of Chicago Press, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Friedrich Engels]] (who, as a partisan of Hegel, attended to "shield the great man's grave from abuse").&lt;ref&gt;Tristram Hunt, ''Marx's General: The Revolutionary Life of Friedrich Engels'' (Henry Holt and Co., 2009: {{ISBN|0-8050-8025-2}}), pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The opening lecture of his course was listened to by a large and appreciative audience. The enmity of his old foe, [[Heinrich Paulus|H. E. G. Paulus]], sharpened by Schelling's apparent success, led to the surreptitious publication of a verbatim report of the lectures on the philosophy of revelation, and, as Schelling did not succeed in obtaining legal condemnation and suppression of this piracy, he in 1845 ceased the delivery of any public courses.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=317}}

==Works==
[[File:Schelling 1848.jpg|thumb|right|A February 1848 [[daguerrotype]] of Schelling]]
In 1793 Schelling contributed to [[Heinrich Eberhard Gottlob Paulus]]'s periodical ''Memorabilien''. His 1795 dissertation was ''De Marcione Paullinarum epistolarum emendatore'' (''On [[Marcion of Sinope|Marcion]] as emendator of the [[Pauline letters]]'').{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=316}} In 1794, Schelling published an exposition of Fichte's thought entitled ''Ueber&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; die Möglichkeit einer Form der Philosophie überhaupt'' (''On the Possibility of a Form of Philosophy in General'').{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=319}} This work was acknowledged by Fichte himself and immediately earned Schelling a reputation among philosophers. His more elaborate work, ''Vom Ich als Prinzip der Philosophie, oder über das Unbedingte im menschlichen Wissen'' (''On Self as Principle of Philosophy, or on the Unrestricted in Human Knowledge'', 1795), while still remaining within the limits of the Fichtean idealism, showed a tendency to give the Fichtean method a more objective application, and to amalgamate [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]'s views with it. He contributed articles and reviews to the ''Philosophisches Journal'' of Fichte and [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer]], and threw himself into the study of physical and medical science. In 1795 Schelling published ''Philosophische Briefe über Dogmatismus und Kritizismus'' (''Philosophical Letters on Dogmatism and Criticism''), consisting of 10 letters addressed to an unknown interlocutor that presented both a defense and critique of the Kantian system.

In the period 1796/97 there was written the seminal manuscript now known as the ''Das älteste Systemprogramm des deutschen Idealismus'' ("[[The Oldest Systematic Program of German Idealism]]"). It survives in Hegel's handwriting. On its first publication (1916) by [[Franz Rosenzweig]], it was attributed to Schelling. It has also been claimed for Hegel and Hölderlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crites  |first=Stephen |title=Dialectic and Gospel in the Development of Hegel's Thinking |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dz_fL1kLLXsC&amp;printsec=frontcover |date=1 November 2010 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=ucUvmQEACAAJ 1998] |publisher=Penn State Press |isbn=978-0-271-04386-9 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=dz_fL1kLLXsC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=%22Das+älteste+Systemprogramm+des+deutschen+Idealismus%22%22Rosenzweig+identified+the+handwriting+as+Hegel's,+identifying+it+as+a+copy+of+a+lost+original+by+Schelling,+who+had+written+it+under+the+considerable+influence+of+Hölderlin%22 62]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammermeister"&gt;Kai Hammermeister, ''The German Aesthetic Tradition'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1797 Schelling published the essay ''Neue Deduction des Naturrechts'' ("New Deduction of Natural Law"), which anticipated Fichte's treatment of the topic in the ''Grundlage des Naturrechts'' (''Foundations of Natural Law''). His studies of physical science bore fruit in the ''Ideen zu einer Philosophie der Natur'' (''Ideas Concerning a Philosophy of Nature'', 1797), and the treatise ''Von der Weltseele'' (''On the World-Soul'', 1798). In ''Ideen'' Schelling referred to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and quoted from his ''[[Monadology]]''. He held Leibniz in high regard because of his view of nature during his natural philosophy period.

In 1800 Schelling published ''System des transcendentalen Idealismus'' (''[[System of Transcendental Idealism]]''). In this book Schelling described transcendental philosophy and nature philosophy as complementary to one another. Fichte reacted by stating that Schelling was working on the basis of a false philosophical principle: in Fichte's theory nature as Not-Self (''Nicht-Ich'' = object) could not be a subject of philosophy, whose essential content is the subjective activity of the human intellect. The breach became unrecoverable in 1801, after Schelling published ''Darstellung des Systems meiner Philosophie'' ("Presentation of My System of Philosophy"). Fichte thought this title absurd, since in his opinion philosophy could not be personalized. Moreover, in this book Schelling publicly expressed his estimation of Spinoza, whose work Fichte had repudiated as dogmatism, and declared that nature and spirit differ only in their quantity, but are essentially identical (''Identität''). According to Schelling, the absolute was the indifference or identity, which he considered to be an essential subject of philosophy.

The "Aphorisms on ''Naturphilosophie''" published in the ''Jahrbücher der Medicin als Wissenschaft'' (1806–1808) are for the most part extracts from the Würzburg lectures, and the ''Denkmal der Schrift von den göttlichen Dingen des Herrn Jacobi''{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=317}} was a response to an attack by [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]] (the two accused each other of atheism&lt;ref&gt;John Laughland, ''Schelling Versus Hegel: From German Idealism to Christian Metaphysics'' (Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007: {{ISBN|0-7546-6118-0}}), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;). A work of significance is the 1809 ''Philosophische Untersuchungen über das Wesen der menschlichen Freiheit und die damit zusammenhängenden Gegenstände'' (''[[Philosophical Inquiries into the Essence of Human Freedom]]''), which carries out, with increasing tendency to [[mysticism]], the thoughts of the previous work, ''Philosophie und Religion'' (''Philosophy and Religion'', 1804).{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=317}} However, in a change from the Jena period works, now evil is not an appearance coming from the quantitative differences between the real and the ideal, but something substantial. This work clearly paraphrased Kant's distinction between intelligible and empirical character. Otherwise, Schelling himself called freedom "a capacity for good and evil".

The tract ''Ueber&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; die Gottheiten zu Samothrake'' ("On the Divinities of [[Samothrace]]") appeared in 1815, ostensibly a portion of a greater work, ''[[Weltalter]]'' ("The ages of the world"), frequently announced as ready for publication, but of which little was ever written. Schelling planned ''Weltalter'' as a book in three parts, describing the past, present, and future of the world; however, he began only the first part, rewriting it several times and at last keeping it unpublished. The other two parts were left only in planning. Christopher John Murray describes the work as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Building on the premise that philosophy cannot ultimately explain existence, he merges the earlier philosophies of Nature and identity with his newfound belief in a fundamental conflict between a dark unconscious principle and a conscious principle in God. God makes the universe intelligible by relating to the ground of the real but, insofar as nature is not complete intelligence, the real exists as a lack within the ideal and not as reflective of the ideal itself. The three universal ages — distinct only to us but not in the eternal God — therefore comprise a beginning where the principle of God before God is divine will striving for being, the present age, which is still part of this growth and hence a mediated fulfillment, and a finality where God is consciously and consummately Himself to Himself.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher John Murray, ''Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760-1850'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004: {{ISBN|1-57958-422-5}}), pp. 1001–02.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No authentic information on the new positive philosophy (''positive Philosophie'') of Schelling was available until after his death (at Bad [[Ragatz]], on 20 August 1854). His sons then began the issue of his collected writings with the four volumes of Berlin lectures: vol. i. ''Introduction to the Philosophy of Mythology'' (1856); ii. ''Philosophy of Mythology'' (1857); iii. and iv. ''Philosophy of Revelation'' (1858).{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=317}}

==Periodization==
Schelling at all stages of his thought called to his aid outward forms of some other system. Fichte, Spinoza, [[Jakob Boehme]] and the mystics, and finally, major Greek thinkers with their [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]], [[gnosticism|Gnostic]], and [[scholasticism|Scholastic]] commentators, give colouring to particular works. In Schelling's own view, his philosophy fell into three stages.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=317}} These were:
#the transition from Fichte's method to the more objective conception of nature i.e. the advance to ''Naturphilosophie''{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=317}}
#the definite formulation of that which implicitly, as Schelling claims, was involved in the idea of ''Naturphilosophie'', that is, the thought of the identical, indifferent, absolute substratum of both nature and spirit, the advance to ''Identitätsphilosophie''{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=317}}
#the opposition of negative and positive philosophy, an opposition which is the theme of his Berlin lectures, though its germs may be traced back to 1804.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=317}}

===''Naturphilosophie''===
{{main|Naturphilosophie}}

The function of Schelling's ''Naturphilosophie'' is to exhibit the ideal as springing from the real. The change which experience brings before us leads to the conception of  duality, the polar opposition through which nature expresses itself. The dynamical series of stages in nature are matter, as the equilibrium of the fundamental expansive and contractive forces; light, with its subordinate processes (magnetism, electricity, and chemical action); organism, with its component phases of reproduction, irritability and sensibility.&lt;ref&gt;"The briefest and best account in Schelling himself of Naturphilosophie is that contained in the ''Einleitung zu dem Ersten Entwurf'' (S.W. iii.). A full and lucid statement of Naturphilosophie is that given by K. Fischer in his Gesch. d. n. Phil., vi. 433-692" {{harv|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=318}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation and influence==
Some scholars characterize Schelling as a protean thinker who, although brilliant, jumped from one subject to another and lacked the synthesizing power needed to arrive at a complete philosophical system. Others challenge the notion that Schelling's thought is marked by profound breaks, instead arguing that his philosophy always focused on a few common themes, especially human freedom, the absolute, and the relationship between spirit and nature. Unlike Hegel, Schelling did not believe that the absolute could be known in its true character through rational inquiry alone.

Schelling's thought is still studied, although his reputation has varied over time. His work impressed the English romantic poet and critic [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], who introduced his ideas into English-speaking culture, sometimes without full acknowledgment, as in the ''[[Biographia Literaria]]''. Coleridge's critical work was itself influential, and it was he who introduced into English literature Schelling's concept of the unconscious. Schelling's ''[[System of Transcendental Idealism]]'' has been seen as a precursor of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s ''[[Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1899).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowie |first=Andrew |title=Aesthetics and Subjectivity. From Kant to Nietzsche |url=https://books.google.com/?id=q367AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=1990 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-719-04011-5 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=q367AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=%22The+577+is+a+difficult+work+because+it+tries+to+tell%22%22the+story+of+consciousness,+including+what+happens+before+self-consciousness%22%22analogies+of+this+project+to+what+Freud+was+to+attempt+one+hundred+years+later+in+the+Interpretation+of+Dreams%22 89]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1950s, Schelling was almost a forgotten philosopher even in Germany. In the 1910s and 1920s, philosophers of neo-Kantianism and neo-Hegelianism, like [[Wilhelm Windelband]] or [[Richard Kroner]], tended to describe Schelling as an episode connecting Fichte and Hegel. His late period tended to be ignored, and his philosophies of nature and of art in the 1790s and first decade of the 19th century were the main focus. In this context [[Kuno Fischer]] characterized Schelling's early philosophy as "aesthetic idealism", focusing on the argument where he ranked art as "the sole document and the eternal organ of philosophy" (''das einzige wahre und ewige Organon zugleich und Dokument der Philosophie''). From socialist philosophers like [[György Lukács]], he received criticism as anachronistic. An exception was [[Martin Heidegger]], who treated Schelling's ''[[On Human Freedom]]'' in his lectures in 1936. Heidegger found there central themes of Western ontology: the issues of being, existence, and freedom.

In the 1950s, the situation began to change. In 1954, the centennial of his death, an international conference on Schelling was held. Several philosophers including [[Karl Jaspers]] gave presentations about the uniqueness and relevance of his thought, the interest shifting toward his later work on being and existence, or, more precisely, the origin of existence. Schelling was the subject of the 1954 dissertation of [[Jürgen Habermas]].&lt;ref name=’Habermas’&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com./?id=IOLWAAAAMAAJ |title=Das Absolute und die Geschichte. Von der Zwiespältigkeit in Schellings Denken |first=Jurgen |last=Habermas |date=1954 |publisher=Gummersbach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 Jaspers published a book titled ''Schelling'', representing him as a forerunner of the [[existentialist]]s. [[Walter Schulz]], one of organizers of the 1954 conference, published a book claiming that Schelling had made German idealism complete with his late philosophy, particularly with his Berlin lectures in the 1840s. Schulz presented Schelling as the person who resolved the philosophical problems which Hegel had left incomplete, in contrast to the contemporary idea that Schelling had been surpassed by Hegel much earlier. Theologian [[Paul Tillich]] wrote: "what I learned from Schelling became determinative of my own philosophical and theological development".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Tillich, ''A History of Christian Thought'' 438 Simon and Schuster, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] likened his own project of natural ontology to Schelling's in his 1957-58 Course on Nature.

In the 1970s nature was again of interest to philosophers in relation to environmental issues. Schelling's philosophy of nature, particularly his intention to construct a program which covers both nature and the intellectual life in a single system and method, and restore nature as a central theme of philosophy, has been reevaluated in the contemporary context. His influence and relation to the German art scene, particularly to Romantic literature and visual art, has been an interest since the late 1960s, from [[Philipp Otto Runge]] to [[Gerhard Richter]] and [[Joseph Beuys]]. This interest has been revived in recent years through the work of the environmental philosopher [[Arran Gare]] who has identified a tradition of Schellingian science overcoming the opposition between science and the humanities, and offering the basis for an understanding of ecological science and ecological philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2013.03.002 |pmid=23562477 |title=Overcoming the Newtonian paradigm: The unfinished project of theoretical biology from a Schellingian perspective |journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology |volume=113 |issue=1 |pages=5–24 |year=2013 |last1=Gare |first1=Arran |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/GAROTN }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to psychology, Schelling was considered to have coined the term "[[Unconscious mind|unconsciousness]]". [[Slavoj Žižek]] has written two books attempting to integrate Schelling's philosophy, mainly his middle period works including ''Weltalter'', with the work of [[Jacques Lacan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Žižek |first1=Slavoj |title=The indivisible remainder: An essay on Schelling and related matters |date=1996 |publisher=Verso |location=London |isbn=978-1-859-84094-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Žižek|first1=Slavoj|title=The parallax view|date=2009|publisher=MIT|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0-26251268-8|edition=1st paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition and division in God and thus the problem of evil in God faced by the later Schelling influenced [[Luigi Pareyson]]'s thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Braidotti |first=Rosi |authorlink=Rosi Braidotti |title=After Poststructuralism.

==Quotations==
*"Nature is visible Spirit; Spirit is invisible Nature." (''Ideen'', "Introduction")
*"History as a whole is a progressive, gradually self-disclosing revelation of the Absolute." (''System of Transcendental Idealism'', 1800)
*"Now if the appearance of ''freedom'' is necessarily infinite, the total evolution of the Absolute is also an infinite process, and history itself a never wholly completed revelation of that Absolute which, for the sake of consciousness, and thus merely for the sake of appearance, separates itself into conscious and unconscious, the free and the intuitant; but which ''itself'', however, in the inaccessible light wherein it dwells, is Eternal Identity and the everlasting ground of harmony between the two." (''System of Transcendental Idealism'', 1800)
*"Has creation a final goal? And if so, why was it not reached at once? Why was the consummation not realized from the beginning? To these questions there is but one answer: Because God is ''Life'', and not merely Being." (''[[Philosophical Inquiries into the Nature of Human Freedom]]'', 1809)
*"Only he who has tasted freedom can feel the desire to make over everything in its image, to spread it throughout the whole universe." (''Philosophical Inquiries into the Nature of Human Freedom'', 1809)
*"As there is nothing before or outside of God he must contain within himself the ground of his existence. All philosophies say this, but they speak of this ground as a mere concept without making it something real and actual." (''Philosophical Inquiries into the Nature of Human Freedom'', 1809)
*"[The Godhead] is not divine nature or substance, but the devouring ferocity of purity that a person is able to approach only with an equal purity. Since all Being goes up in it as if in flames, it is necessarily unapproachable to anyone still embroiled in Being." (''The Ages of the World'', c. 1815)
*"God then has no beginning only insofar as there is no beginning of his beginning. The beginning in God is eternal beginning, that is, such a one as was beginning from all eternity, and still is, and also never ceases to be beginning." (Quoted in Hartshorne &amp; Reese, ''Philosophers Speak of God'', Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1953, p.&amp;nbsp;237.)

A '''gift''' or a '''present''' is an item given to someone without the expectation of payment or anything in return. An item is not a gift if that item is already owned by the one to whom it is given. Although gift-giving might involve an expectation of reciprocity, a gift is meant to be free. In many countries, the act of mutually exchanging [[money]], [[property|goods]], etc. may sustain social relations and contribute to social cohesion. Economists have elaborated the [[economics]] of gift-giving into the notion of a [[gift economy]]. By extension the term ''gift'' can refer to any item or act of service that makes the other [[happiness|happier]] or less sad, especially as a favor, including [[forgiveness]] and [[kindness]]. Gifts are also first and foremost presented on occasions such as birthdays and holidays.

== Presentation ==
In many cultures gifts are traditionally packaged in some way. For example, in Western cultures, gifts are often wrapped in [[wrapping paper]] and accompanied by a [[gift note]] which may note the occasion, the recipient's name and the giver's name. In Chinese culture, red wrapping connotes luck. Although inexpensive gifts are common among colleagues, associates and acquaintances, expensive or amorous gifts are considered more appropriate among close friends, romantic interests or relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brigham|first1=John Carl|title=Social Psychology|date=1986|page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotional Gifts ==
Promotional gifts vary from the normal gifts. The recipients of the gifts may be either employee of a company or the clients. Promotional gifts are mainly used for advertising purposes. They are used to promote the brand name and increase its awareness among the people. In promotional gifting procedures, the quality and presentation of the gifts hold more value than the gifts itself since it will act as a gateway to acquire new clients or associates.

== As reinforcement and manipulation ==
Giving a gift to someone is not necessarily just an altruistic act. It may be given in the hope that the receiver [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocates]] in a particular way. It may take the form of [[positive reinforcement]] as a [[Reward system|reward]] for [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]], possibly for an underhand [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] and [[abusive]] purpose.&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unwanted gifts==

A significant fraction of gifts are unwanted, or the giver pays more for the item than the recipient values it, resulting in a misallocation of economic resources known as a [[deadweight loss]].  Unwanted gifts are often [[regifted]], donated to charity, or thrown away.&lt;ref name="vox"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.vox.com/new-money/2016/12/21/14032662/christmas-gift-giving-wasteful|title=The economic case against Christmas presents |work=Vox |access-date=December 5, 2017 |date=December 21, 2016 |last=Lee |first=Timothy B. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A gift that actually imposes a burden on the recipient, either due to maintenance or storage or disposal costs, is known as a [[white elephant]].  

One means of reducing the mismatch between the buyer and receivers' tastes is advance coordination, often undertaken in the form of a [[wedding registry]] or [[Christmas list]]. Wedding registries in particular are often kept at a single store, which can designate the exact items to be purchased (resulting in matching housewares), and to coordinate purchases so the same gift is not purchased by different guests. One study found that wedding guests who departed from the registry typically did so because they wished to signal a closer relationship to the couple by personalizing a gift, and also found that as a result of not abiding by the recipients' preferences, their gifts were appreciated less often.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2016/06/24/483426485/new-study-explores-psychology-of-giving-wedding-gifts |title=New Study Explores Psychology Of Giving Wedding Gifts |last=Mendoza |first=Nohely |date=December 26, 2017 |location=Waco, Texas |newspaper= Nexstar Broadcasting }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated $3.4 billion was spent on unwanted Christmas gifts in the United States in 2017.&lt;ref name="cent"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.centexproud.com/news/local/biggest-return-day-of-the-year/888734842 |title=Biggest return day of the year |last=Mendoza |first=Nohely |location=Waco, Texas |access-date=September 19, 2018 |newspaper=Nexstar Broadcasting }}&lt;/ref&gt; The day after Christmas is typically the busiest day for returns in countries with large Christmas gift giving traditions.&lt;ref name="cent" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/unwanted-christmas-presents-returns-busiest-day-year-working-retail-a8138181.html |title=Unwanted Christmas presents set to rise on busiest day of the year for returns |newspaper=The Independent |date=January 2, 2018 |access-date=September 19, 2018 |last=Musaddique |first=Shafi }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total unredeemed value of [[gift cards]] purchased in the U.S. each year is estimated to be about a billion dollars.&lt;ref name="vox" /&gt;

== Legal aspects ==
{{Main|Gift (law)|Gift tax}}

At [[common law]], for a gift to have legal effect, it was required that there be (1) intent by the donor to give a gift, and (2) delivery to the recipient of the item to be given as a gift.

In some countries, certain types of gifts above a certain monetary amount are subject to taxation.  For the United States, see [[Gift tax in the United States]].

In some contexts, gift giving can be construed as [[bribery]].  This tends to occur in situations where the gift is given with an implicit or explicit agreement between the giver of the gift and its receiver that some type of service will be rendered (often outside of normal legitimate methods) because of the gift. Some groups, such as government workers, may have strict rules concerning gift giving and receiving so as to avoid the appearance of impropriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://oge.gov/web/oge.nsf/Gifts%20and%20Payments |title=Gifts and Payments |publisher=United States Office of Government Ethics |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=September 19, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious views ==
[[Lewis Hyde]] remarks in ''The Gift'' that [[Christianity]] considers the [[Incarnation]] and subsequent death of [[Jesus]] to be the greatest gift to humankind, and that the [[Jataka]] contains a tale of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] in his incarnation as the Wise Hare giving the ultimate [[alms]] by offering himself up as a meal for [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Sakka]]. (Hyde, 1983, 58-60)

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the bread and wine that are [[consecrated]] during the [[Divine Liturgy]] are referred to as "the Gifts." They are first of all the gifts of the community (both individually and corporately) to God, and then, after the [[epiklesis]], the Gifts of the [[Body of Christ|Body]] and [[Blood of Christ|Blood]] of [[Christ]] to the Church.

Ritual [[sacrifice]]s can be seen as return gifts to a [[deity]].

The '''Immaculate Conception''' is the [[Human fertilization|conception]] of the [[Virgin Mary]] free from [[original sin]] by virtue of the merits of her son [[Jesus]]. The Catholic Church teaches that God acted upon Mary in the first moment of her conception keeping her "immaculate".&lt;ref&gt;Denzinger, 1100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Immaculate Conception is commonly confused with the [[Virgin Birth of Jesus]], the latter being, rather, the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Doctrine of Incarnation]]. While all Christians believe in the Virgin Birth of Jesus, principally Roman Catholics along with various other Christian denominations believe in the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.

Although the belief that Mary was sinless, or conceived without original sin, has been widely held since [[Late Antiquity]], the doctrine was not [[dogma]]tically defined in the Catholic Church until 1854 when [[Pope Pius IX]], declared [[Papal_infallibility#Ex cathedra|ex cathedra]], i.e., using papal infallibility, in his [[papal bull]] ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p122a3p2.htm|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - "Conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary"|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Immaculate Conception to be doctrine. The Catholic Church celebrates the [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]] on December 8; in many [[Catholic countries]], it is a [[holy day of obligation]] or [[Patronages of the Immaculate Conception|patronal feast]], and in some a national [[public holiday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/beliefs/immaculateconception.shtml |title=Christianity: Immaculate Conception |publisher=BBC |accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The defined dogma of the Immaculate Conception states that
{{quote|the most Blessed Virgin Mary, in the first instance of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege granted by Almighty God, in view of the merits of Jesus Christ, the Saviour of the human race, was preserved free from all stain of original sin [''ab omni originalis culpae labe praeservatam immunem''].&lt;ref name=Ineffabilis&gt;
&lt;!--"We declare, pronounce, and define that the doctrine which holds that the most Blessed Virgin Mary, in the first instance of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege granted by Almighty God, in view of the merits of Jesus Christ, the Saviour of the human race, was preserved free from all stain of original sin, is a doctrine revealed by God and therefore to be believed firmly and constantly by all the faithful." 
(''declaramus, pronuntiamus et definimus doctrinam, quae tenet, beatissimam Virginem Mariam in primo instanti suae Conceptionis fuisse singulari omnipotentis Dei gratia et privilegio, intuitu meritorum Christi lesu Salvatoris humani generis, ab omni originalis culpae labe praeservatam immunem, esse a Deo revelatam, atque idcirco ab omnibus fidelibus firmiter constanterque credendam. Quapropter si qui secus ac a Nobis'')
--&gt;
[http://www.ewtn.com/LIBRARY/PAPALDOC/P9INEFF.htm Encyclical ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]'' of Pope Pius IX], 1854.
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The definition concerns [[original sin]] only, and it makes no declaration about the Church's belief that the Blessed Virgin was sinless in the sense of freedom from actual or personal sin.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|url=https://encyclopedia.jrank.org/I27_INV/IMMACULATE_CONCEPTION_THE.html|title=THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The doctrine teaches that from her conception Mary, being always free from original sin,  received the [[sanctifying grace]] that would normally come with baptism after birth.

===Possibility of personal sin===
The Encyclical ''Mystici Corporis'' from [[Pope Pius XII]] (1943) in addition holds that Mary was also sinless personally, "free from all sin, original or personal".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_29061943_mystici-corporis-christi_en.html Encyclical ''Mystici Corporis'', 110] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317235459/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_29061943_mystici-corporis-christi_en.html |date=March 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, Pius XII repeats a position already expressed by the [[Council of Trent]], which decreed "If anyone shall say that a man once justified can sin no more, nor lose grace, and that therefore he who falls and sins was never truly justified; or, on the contrary, that throughout his whole life he can avoid all sins even venial sins, except by a special privilege of God, as the Church holds in regard to the Blessed Virgin: let him be anathema."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catecheticsonline.com/SourcesofDogma9.php |title=Catechetics Online |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724140035/http://www.catecheticsonline.com/SourcesofDogma9.php |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Mary}}

===Mary's pre-redemption===
When defining the dogma in ''Ineffabilis Deus'', [[Pope Pius IX]] explicitly affirmed that Mary was redeemed in a manner more sublime. He stated that Mary, rather than being cleansed after sin, was completely prevented from contracting original sin in view of the foreseen merits of Jesus Christ, the Savior of the human race. In {{Bibleverse||Luke|1:47}}, Mary proclaims: "My spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour." This is referred to as Mary's pre-redemption by Christ. Since the [[Second Council of Orange]] against [[Semipelagianism|semi-pelagianism]], the Catholic Church has taught that even had man never sinned in the [[Garden of Eden]] and was sinless, he would still require God's grace to remain sinless.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catecheticsonline.com/SourcesofDogma2.php Council of Orange II, Canon 19 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113162800/http://www.catecheticsonline.com/SourcesofDogma2.php |date=2009-01-13 }} "That no one is saved except by God's mercy. Even if human nature remained in that integrity in which it was formed, it would in no way save itself without the help of its Creator; therefore, since without the grace of God it cannot guard the health which it received, how without the grace of God will it be able to recover what it has lost?"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Theology for Beginners'' by Francis Joseph Sheed 1958 {{ISBN|0-7220-7425-5}} pages 134-138&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misconceptions===
The doctrine of the immaculate conception (Mary being conceived free from original sin) is not to be confused with the [[virgin birth of Jesus|virginal conception]] of her son Jesus. Catholics believe that Mary was conceived of both parents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|work=Catholic Encyclopedia|year=1913|quote=Her body was formed in the womb of the mother, and the father had the usual share in its formation. The question does not concern the immaculateness of the generative activity of her parents.|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07674d.htm|title=Immaculate Conception|accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; traditionally known by the names of [[Saint Joachim]] and [[Saint Anne]]. In 1677, the [[Holy See]] condemned the error of Imperiali who taught that St. Anne in the conception and birth of Mary remained virgin, which had been a belief surfacing occasionally since the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01538a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Anne|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church celebrates the [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]] (when Mary was conceived free from original sin) on 8 December, exactly nine months before celebrating the [[Nativity of Mary]]. The feast of the [[Annunciation]] (which commemorates the virginal conception and the [[Incarnation]] of Jesus) is celebrated on 25 March, nine months before [[Christmas Day]].&lt;ref name="The Catholicism Answer Book' page 59-62"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Catholicism Answer Book|first1=John|last1=Trigilio|first2=Kenneth|last2=Brighenti|year=2007|isbn=1-4022-0806-5|pages=59–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=What Every Catholic Should Know about Mary|first=Terrence J.|last=McNally|isbn=1-4415-1051-6|pages=104–108&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

A feast of the Conception of the Most Holy and All Pure Mother of God was celebrated in Syria on 8 December perhaps as early as the 5th century. The title of ''achrantos'' (spotless, immaculate, all-pure) refers to the holiness of Mary, not specifically to the holiness of her conception.&lt;ref&gt;"The celebration of the Mother of God as immaculate (''achrantos''), is a clear and universal recognition of her exceptional and iconic sanctity. Orthodoxy did not follow the path of Roman Catholicism in moving towards a recognition of her Immaculate Conception". John Anthony McGuckin, ''[https://books.google.ie/books?id=KLIFfmipXcoC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=mcguckin+achrantos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=aMIqTo-jOI_oOYWLwc4K&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Orthodox Church: An Introduction to Its History, Doctrine, and Spiritual Culture]'' (Blackwell 2011) {{ISBN|978-1-4443-3731-0}}, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of Byzantium. Beginning with St. [[Gregory Nazianzen]], his explanation of the "purification" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of "purification" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism).  St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as ''prokathartheisa'' (prepurified). Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory.&lt;ref&gt;Patrologia Graeca 36: 326B 41-42; idem, 36: 633C 7-8&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Daley, "Gregory of Nazianzus", ''The Early Christian Church Fathers'', New York (2006), pp. 115-118.&lt;/ref&gt; Nazianzen's title of Mary at the Annunciation as "prepurified" was subsequently adopted by all theologians interested in his Mariology to justify the Byzantine equivalent of the Immaculate Conception. This is especially apparent in the Fathers St. Sophronios of Jerusalem and St. John Damascene, who will be treated below in this article at the section on Church Fathers. About the time of Damascene, the public celebration of the "Conception of St. Ann" (i.e., of the ''Theotokos'' in her womb) was becoming popular. After this period, the "purification" of the perfect natures of Jesus and Mary would not only mean moments of grace and glory at the Incarnation and Baptism and other public Byzantine liturgical feasts, but purification was eventually associated with the feast of Mary's very conception (along with her Presentation in the Temple as a toddler) by Orthodox authors of the 2nd millennium (e.g., St. Nicholas Cabasilas&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Cabasilas (†1371?). ''Homélies sur la Nativité, L'Annonciation et la Dormition de la Sainte Vierge'', ed. M. Jugie (Patrologia Orientalis 19), Turnhout 1990, pp. 456-512 (ch. 10, lines 1-8): "If there are some of the holy doctors who say that the Virgin is 'prepurified (προκεκαθάρθαι)' by the Spirit, then it is yet necessary to think that 'purification (κάθαρσιν)' (i.e. an addition of graces) is intended by these authors, and these [doctors] say that this is the way the angels are 'purified', with respect to whom there is nothing knavish."&lt;/ref&gt; and Joseph Bryennius).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Bryennius, ''Ιὠσῆφ Μαναχοῦ τοῦ Βρυεννίου τὰ εὐρεθέντα'', vol. 3, ed. E. Bulgaris (Thessaloniki: 1990), 31: "He says: 'Yet, on one hand, how did another Mother of God not come about?' But, on the other hand: 'Had she some sort of virtue/excellence, because of which she was honored above all women?' First, another woman was not chosen over her, because while God foreknew all women, he sanctified (ἡγίασεν) the future woman from her mother’s womb, purer (καθαρωτέραν) than other women, who were going to come to exist; but he eschewed all unworthy persons with respect to her, as is reasonable. But she procured for herself the excellence superior to all men and [procured for her] to be prepared as a containing receptacle of the divinity, which [same receptacle] was prepurified (τὸ προκαθαρθῆναι) by the Holy Spirit; O what a marvel, indeed!"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church Fathers===
It is admitted that the doctrine as defined by Pius IX was not explicitly mooted before the 12th century. It is also agreed that "no direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture".&lt;ref name=Holweck/&gt; But it is claimed that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teaching of the Fathers. Their expressions on the subject of the sinlessness of Mary are, it is pointed out, so ample and so absolute that they must be taken to include original sin as well as actual. Thus in the first five centuries such epithets as "in every respect holy", "in all things unstained", "super-innocent", and "singularly holy" are applied to her; she is compared to Eve before the fall, as ancestress of a redeemed people; she is "the earth before it was accursed". The well-known words of St. [[Augustine]] (d. 430) may be cited: "As regards the mother of God," he says, "I will not allow any question whatever of sin." It is true that he is here speaking directly of actual or personal sin. But his argument is that all men are sinners; that they are so through original depravity; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God, and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin "of every sort" (''omni ex parte'').&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Although the doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception appears only later among Latin (and particularly Frankish) theologians,&lt;ref&gt;Brian Reynolds, Gateway to Heaven: Marian Doctrine and Devotion Image and Typology in the Patristic and Medieval Periods, vol. 1 (NY: New City Press, 2012), 348-353.&lt;/ref&gt; it became ever more manifest among Byzantine theologians reliant on Gregory Nazianzen's Mariology in the Medieval or Byzantine East. Although hymnographers and scholars, like the Emperor Justinian I, were accustomed to call Mary "prepurified" in their poetic and credal statements, the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Sophronios of Jerusalem, In Sanctissimae Deiparae Annuntiationem (Patrologia Graeca 87.3:3248A 24): "Οὐδεὶς κατά σε μεμακάρισται, οὐδεὶς κατά σε καθαγίασται· οὐδεὶς κατά σε μεμεγάλυνται, οὐδεὶς κατά σε προκεκάθαρται· οὐδεὶς κατά σε περιηύγασται, οὐδεὶς κατά σε ἐκπεφώτισται." N.B., οὐδεὶς κατά σε προκεκάθαρται ''oudeis kata se prokekathartai'' was rendered in Latin as ''nemo, sicut tu, purificante gratia praeoccupatus est''.&lt;/ref&gt; In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate, when she was "purified" at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally "holier than all 'Men' born of woman" since Mary's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero.&lt;ref&gt;Sophronios of Jerusalem, In Sanctissimae Deiparae Annuntiationem (Patrologia Graeca, 87.3: 3273D 43): "Πνεῦμα ἅγιον ἐπὶ σὲ, τὴν ἀμόλυντον, κάτεισι, καθαρωτέραν σε ποιησόμενον, καὶ καρπογόνον σοι παρεξόμενον δύναμιν."; idem, Encomium in S. Iohannem Baptistam, p. 87:3332C&lt;/ref&gt; Sophronius' teaching is augmented and incorporated by St. [[John Damascene]] (d. 749/750).  John, besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation, grants her the unique honor of "purifying the waters of baptism by touching them". This honor was most famously and firstly attributed to Christ, especially in the legacy of Nazianzen. As such, Nazianzen's assertion of parallel holiness between the prepurified Mary and purified Jesus of the New Testament is made even more explicit in Damascene in his discourse on Mary's holiness to also imitate Christ's baptism at the Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;"The air, the fiery ether, the sky would have been made holy by the ascent of her spirit, as earth was sanctified by the deposition of her body. Even water had its share in the blessing: for she was washed in pure water, which did not so much cleanse her as it was itself consecrated." See John Damascene, ''On the Holy and Glorious Dormition and Transformation of Our Lady Mary, Mother of God and Ever-Virgin by Our Holy Father John, Monk of Damascus and Son of Mansour''. Homily 2, in ''On the Dormition of Mary: Early Patristic Homilies'', tr. B. Daley (Crestwood, NY :1998), 215.&lt;/ref&gt; The Damascene's hymnongraphy and ''De fide Orthodoxa'' explicitly use Mary's "pre-purification" as a key to understanding her absolute holiness and unsullied human nature. In fact, Damascene (along with Nazianzen) serves as the source for nearly all subsequent promotion of Mary's complete holiness from her Conception by the "all pure seed" of Joachim and the womb "wider than heaven" of St. Ann.&lt;ref&gt;Christiaan Kappes, "The Immaculate Conception: Why Thomas Aquinas Denied, While John Duns Scotus, Gregory Palamas, and Mark Eugenicus Professed the Absolute Immaculate Existence of Mary" (Bedford, MA: Academy of the Immaculate, 2014), pp. 39-61&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval dispute about the doctrine===
{{Catholic marian prayers sidebar}}
[[Bernard of Clairvaux]] in the 12th century raised the question of the Immaculate Conception. A feast of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin had already begun to be celebrated in some churches of the West. St Bernard blames the canons of the metropolitan church of [[Lyon]] for instituting such a festival without the permission of the Holy See. In doing so, he takes occasion to repudiate altogether the view that the conception of Mary was sinless. It is doubtful, however, whether he was using the term "conception" in the same sense in which it is used in the definition of Pope Pius IX. Bernard would seem to have been speaking of conception in the active sense of the mother's cooperation, for in his argument he says: "How can there be absence of sin where there is concupiscence (''libido'')?" and stronger expressions follow, showing that he is speaking of the mother and not of the child.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]] refused to concede the Immaculate Conception, on the ground that, unless the Blessed Virgin had at one time or other been one of the sinful, she could not justly be said to have been redeemed by Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VeP7kg-blnIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=summa+theologica+volume&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RmgsTs_jOou3hAfL8cWqCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22stain%20of%20original%20sin%22&amp;f=false|title=Summa Theologica, Volume 4 (Part III, First Section)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint [[Bonaventure]] (d. 1274), second only to Saint Thomas in his influence on the Christian schools of his age, hesitated to accept it for a similar reason.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; He believed that Mary was completely free from sin, but that she was not given this grace at the instant of her conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/faith/Teachings/marya2.htm|title=Mary's Immaculate Conception|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The celebrated [[John Duns Scotus]] (d. 1308), a [[Friar Minor]] like Saint Bonaventure, argued, on the contrary, that from a rational point of view it was certainly as little derogatory to the merits of Christ to assert that Mary was by him preserved from all taint of sin, as to say that she first contracted it and then was delivered.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Proposing a solution to the theological problem of reconciling the doctrine with that of universal redemption in Christ, he argued that Mary's immaculate conception did not remove her from redemption by Christ; rather it was the result of a more perfect redemption granted her because of her special role in salvation history.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi'' by Karl Rahner 2004 {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}} pages 896–898&lt;/ref&gt;

The arguments of Scotus, combined with a better acquaintance with the language of the early Fathers, gradually prevailed in the schools of the Western Church. In 1387 the university of Paris strongly condemned the opposite view.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Scotus's arguments remained controversial, however, particularly among the Dominicans, who were willing enough to celebrate Mary's ''sanctificatio'' (being made free from sin) but, following the Dominican Thomas Aquinas' arguments, continued to insist that her sanctification could not have occurred until after her conception.&lt;ref name=Holweck/&gt;

Popular opinion remained firmly behind the celebration of Mary's conception. In 1439, the [[Council of Basel]], which is not reckoned an [[ecumenical council]], stated that belief in the immaculate conception of Mary is in accord with the Catholic faith. By the end of the 15th century the belief was widely professed and taught in many theological faculties, but such was the influence of the Dominicans, and the weight of the arguments of Thomas Aquinas (who had been canonised in 1323 and declared "Doctor Angelicus" of the Church in 1567) that the Council of Trent (1545–1563)—which might have been expected to affirm the doctrine—instead declined to take a position.&lt;ref name=Holweck/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schroedel/&gt;

The papal bull defining the dogma, ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]'' (1854), mentioned in particular the patrististic interpretation of {{bibleverse||Genesis|3:15}} as referring to a woman, Mary, who would be eternally at enmity with the evil serpent and completely triumphing over him. It said the Fathers saw foreshadowings of Mary's "wondrous abundance of divine gifts and original innocence" "in that ark of Noah, which was built by divine command and escaped entirely safe and sound from the common shipwreck of the whole world; in the ladder which Jacob saw reaching from the earth to heaven, by whose rungs the angels of God ascended and descended, and on whose top the Lord himself leaned;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|28:12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that bush which Moses saw in the holy place burning on all sides, which was not consumed or injured in any way but grew green and blossomed beautifully;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|3:2}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that impregnable tower before the enemy, from which hung a thousand bucklers and all the armor of the strong;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Song|4:4}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that garden enclosed on all sides, which cannot be violated or corrupted by any deceitful plots;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Song|4:12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that resplendent city of God, which has its foundations on the holy mountains;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Psalm|87:1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that most august temple of God, which, radiant with divine splendours, is full of the glory of God;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|6:1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in very many other biblical types of this kind."

The bull recounts that the Fathers interpreted the angel's address to Mary, "highly favoured one" or "full of grace",&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|1:28}}&lt;/ref&gt; as indicating that "she was never subject to the curse and was, together with her Son, the only partaker of perpetual benediction"; they "frequently compare her to Eve while yet a virgin, while yet innocence, while yet incorrupt, while not yet deceived by the deadly snares of the most treacherous serpent".

===Definition of the dogma===

The theological underpinnings of Immaculate Conception had been the subject of debate during the [[Middle Ages]] with opposition provided by figures such as Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]], a Dominican. However, supportive arguments by Franciscans [[William of Ware]] and [[Duns Scotus]], and general belief among Catholics made the doctrine more acceptable, so that the [[Council of Basel]] supported it in the 15th century, but the [[Council of Trent]] sidestepped the question. [[Pope Sixtus IV]], a Franciscan, had tried to pacify the situation by forbidding either side from criticizing each other, and placed the feast of the Immaculate Conception on the [[Calendarium Romanum|Roman Calendar]] in 1477, but [[Pope Pius V]], a Dominican, changed it to the feast of the Conception of Mary. [[Clement XI]] made the feast universal in 1708, but still did not call it the feast of the Immaculate Conception.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=J0kQAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA379&amp;dq=Clement+XI+immaculate+conception&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FrvhUPeAONK4hAedsoDIBA&amp;sqi=2&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Clement%20XI%20immaculate%20conception&amp;f=false Edward Bouverie Pusey, ''First letter to the Very Rev.

During the reign of [[Pope Gregory XVI]] the bishops in various countries began to press for a definition as dogma of the teaching of Mary's immaculate conception.&lt;ref&gt;"These petitions were renewed in these our own times; they were especially brought to the attention of Gregory XVI". [http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius09/p9ineff.htm ''Ineffabilis Deus''].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1839, Mariano Spada (1796–1872), professor of theology at the Roman [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|College of Saint Thomas]], published ''Esame Critico sulla dottrina dell' Angelico Dottore S. Tommaso di Aquino circa il Peccato originale, relativamente alla Beatissima Vergine Maria'' ["A critical examination of the doctrine of St. Thomas Aquinas, the Angelic Doctor, regarding original sin with respect to the Most Blessed Virgin Mary"],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=du0CAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA579#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Pareri dell'episcopato cattolico, di capitoli ... etc., sulla definizione dogmatica dell'immaculato concepimento della b. v.

Spada furnished an interpretation whereby Pius IX was relieved of the problem of seeming to foster a doctrine not in agreement with the Aquinas' teaching.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1sFKhPgXC5MC&amp;pg=PA174#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=falseAccessed 3-11-2013; ''Il mistero di Maria: teologia, storia, devozione'' by Giuseppe Damigella, p. 175: "Pio IX si senti' sollevato dal peso teologico di dover sostenere una dottrina non fondata nel pensiero di san Tommaso, il cui insegnamento era allora, come oggi, ritenuto 'sicuro'." Cf. A. Andaloro, "P. Mariano Spada, o.p. interprete di San Tommaso sull'Immucolata Concezione", Catania, 1958]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pope Pius IX]] would later appoint Spada [[Master of the Sacred Palace]] in 1867.

Pius IX, at the beginning of his pontificate, and again after 1851, appointed commissions to investigate the whole subject, and he was advised that the doctrine was one which could be defined and that the time for a definition was opportune.

It was not until 1854 that [[Pope Pius IX]], with the support of the overwhelming majority of Roman Catholic [[bishop]]s, whom he had consulted between 1851–1853, promulgated the [[papal bull]] ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]'' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "Ineffable God"), which defined ''[[ex cathedra]]'' the [[dogma]] of the Immaculate Conception:&lt;ref&gt;''The Creeds of Christendom'' by Philip Schaff 2009 {{ISBN|1-115-46834-0}} page 211&lt;/ref&gt;

The dogma was defined in accordance with the conditions of [[papal infallibility]], which would be defined in 1870 by the [[First Vatican Council]].

The papal definition of the dogma declares with absolute certainty and authority that Mary possessed [[sanctifying grace]] from the first instant of her existence and was free from the lack of grace caused by the [[original sin]] at the beginning of human history. Mary's salvation was won by her son [[Jesus Christ]] through his [[Passion of Jesus|passion]], [[Death of Jesus|death]], and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and was not due to her own merits.&lt;ref name=Schroedel&gt;Jenny Schroedel, ''The Everything Mary Book'' (Adams 2006 {{ISBN|1-59337-713-4}}) pp. 180–181&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Miravalle (1993), ''Introduction to Mary'', Queenship Publishing {{ISBN|978-1-882972-06-7}} pages 64–70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claim of origin in Islamic doctrine===
{{see|Mary in Islam}}
[[File:Turkey.Konya035.jpg|thumb|Manuscript of [[Maryam (sura)|Chapter 19]] (''Sūratu Maryam'') from a 9th-century [[Qur'an]], Turkey.]]

[[George Sale]] in 1734 proposed that the doctrine of immaculate conception of Mary may be alluded to in the text of the [[Qur'an]]. 
Thus, commenting in 1734 on the passage   "I have called her Mary; and I commend her to thy protection, and also her issue, against Satan driven away with stones", Sale stated: "It is not improbable that the pretended immaculate conception of the virgin Mary is intimated in this passage. For according to a tradition of Mohammed, every person that comes into the world, is touched at his birth by the devil, and therefore cries out, Mary and her son only excepted; between whom, and the evil spirit God placed a veil, so that his touch did not reach them. And for this reason they say, neither of them were guilty of any sin, like the rest of the children of Adam."&lt;ref&gt;[http://posner.library.cmu.edu/Posner/books/pages.cgi?call=297_K84K_1734&amp;layout=vol0/part0/copy0&amp;file=0258 George Sale, ''Koran, commonly called the Alcoran of Mohammed'', chapter 3, p. 39]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Edward Gibbon]] in volume 5 of his ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', published in 1788,  wrote: "The [[Latin Church]] has not disdained to borrow from the Koran the immaculate conception of his virgin mother." That he was speaking of her immaculate conception by her mother, not of her own virginal conception of Jesus, is shown by his footnote: "In the xiith century the immaculate conception was condemned by St. Bernard as a presumptuous novelty."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qg4MAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=Gibbon+%22immaculate+conception%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FD0KUZLdJcW4hAeEs4CgCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Gibbon%20%22immaculate%20conception%22&amp;f=false Edward Gibbon, ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', vol. V, chapter 50]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the aftermath of the definition of the dogma in 1854, this charge was repeated in an article published in 1865: "Strange as it may appear, that the doctrine which the church of Rome has promulgated, with so much pomp and ceremony, 'for the destruction of all heresies, and the confirmation of the faith of her adherents', should have its origin in the Mohametan Bible; yet the testimony of such authorities as Gibbon, and Sale, and Forster, and Gagnier, and Maracci, leave no doubt as to the marvellous fact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=klslAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA431&amp;dq=Evangelical+Repository+%22origin+of+the+immaculate+conception%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XUUKUYKOOou1hAf0yID4CQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Evangelical%20Repository%20%22origin%20of%20the%20immaculate%20conception%22&amp;f=false|title=The Evangelical Repository and United Presbyterian Review|year=1865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without making Islamic belief the origin of the doctrine defined in 1854, a similarity between the two has been noted also by Roman Catholic writers such as Thomas Patrick Hughes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Thomas Patrick |last=Hughes|encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Islam|orig-year=First published London 1885|publisher=Asian Educational Services|year=2001|isbn=9788120606722|title=IMMACULATE CONCEPTION|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O84eYLVHvB0C&amp;q=immaculate.conception|accessdate=23 October 2018|quote=This doctrine was asserted by [[Muhammad]] (''[[Mishkat al-Masabih|Mishkāt]]'', book i., ch. iii., pt. 1).}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Bernard Ullathorne]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William Bernard|last=Ullathorne|title=The Immaculate Conception of the Mother of God: An Exposition|year=1855|isbn=1-110-89977-7|chapter=Mahomet and Martin Luther|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2po9AAAAYAAJ&amp;jtp=121#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Giancarlo Finazzo.&lt;ref&gt;Giancarlo Finazzo. [http://www.ewtn.com/library/mary/marykran.htm "The Virgin Mary in the Koran"]. ''L'Osservatore Romano'' Weekly Edition in English, 13 April 1978, page 4. Quote: "The dogma of the Immaculate Conception ... is univocally recognized by the Islamic religion."&lt;/ref&gt;

''The English Commentary of the Holy Quran'' {{year needed|date=July 2018}} argues that this interpretation is misleading, as Islam does not embrace the concept of original sin to begin with, so that Mary could not have been exempt from it.&lt;ref name="alislam.org"&gt;[[The English Commentary of the Holy Quran|English 5 Volume Commentary]] https://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=386&amp;region=E1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HzSQ7zjWtcgC&amp;pg=PA254&amp;dq=Islam+immaculate+conception+mary&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yksKUZOZCoizhAeZoIHoCQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Islam%20immaculate%20conception%20mary&amp;f=false Cleo McNelly Kearns, ''The Virgin Mary, Monotheism and Sacrifice'' (Cambridge University Press 2008] {{ISBN|978-0-52187156-3}}), p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, [[Saint Anne, Mother of Mary|Hannah's]] prayer in the Quran for her child to remain protected from [[Satan]] ([[Devil (Islam)|Shayṭān]]) was said ''after'' it had already been born, not before and expresses a natural concern any righteous parent would have.

A ''[[hadith]]'' nevertheless states that the only children born without the "touch of Satan" were Mary and Jesus-&lt;ref&gt;Bukhari, ''Anbiya'', 44; Muslim, ''Fada'il'', trad. 146, 147&lt;/ref&gt; 
The specific mention of Mary and Jesus in this hadith has been argued{{by whom|date=July 2018}}{{year needed|date=July 2018}} as taken to "represent a class of people", in keeping with the Arabic language and the Quranic verse ''[O Satan,] surely thou shalt have no power over My servants, except such of the erring ones as choose to follow thee'' (15:42).&lt;ref name="alislam.org"/&gt;

===Later developments===
For the Roman Catholic Church the dogma of the Immaculate Conception gained additional significance from the reputed apparitions of [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] in 1858. At [[Lourdes]] a 14-year-old girl, [[Bernadette Soubirous]], claimed that a beautiful woman appeared to her and said, "I am the Immaculate Conception". Many believe the woman to have been the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] and pray to her as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/2002/december/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20021208_immacolata_en.html|title=Prayer on the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary (December 8, 2002) - John Paul II|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Pius IX]] defined the [[Roman Catholic dogma|dogma]] of the Immaculate Conception "not so much because of proofs in [[Scripture]] or ancient [[tradition]], but due to a profound ''[[sensus fidelium]]'' and the Magisterium".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fides.org/eng/approfondire/totustuus/immacolata02.html |title=Agenzia Fides - Congregazione per l'Evangelizzazione dei Popoli |publisher=Fides.org |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615205831/http://www.fides.org/eng/approfondire/totustuus/immacolata02.html |archivedate=2009-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking of the witness of the [[Church Fathers]] in claiming for Mary titles such as "Free from all contagion of sin", [[Pope Pius XII]] wrote:
{{quote|If the popular praises of the Blessed Virgin Mary be given the careful consideration they deserve, who will dare to doubt that she, who was purer than the angels and at all times pure, was at any moment, even for the briefest instant, not free from every stain of sin?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_08091953_fulgens-corona_en.html Pope Pius XII, Encyclical ''Fulgens corona'', 10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429114450/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_08091953_fulgens-corona_en.html |date=2008-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Roman Catholic tradition has a well-established philosophy for the study of the Immaculate Conception and the veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the field of [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Mariology]], with Pontifical schools such as the [[Marianum]] specifically devoted to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.servidimaria.org/en/attualita/promotori2/promotori2.htm |title=Promoters of Marian Study and Culture |accessdate=February 28, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202032938/http://www.servidimaria.org/en/attualita/promotori2/promotori2.htm |archivedate=December 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Publisher’s Notice in the Second Italian Edition (1986), reprinted in English Edition, Gabriel Roschini, O.S.M.

According to [[Bernard Ullathorne]], a 19th-century English [[Roman Catholic]] prelate, "the expressions - The Immaculate Conception - The Immaculate Preservation - The Immunity - and Exception from original sin, are all phrases which bear the same signification, and are used equally to express one and the same mystery."&lt;ref&gt;Ullathorne, William Bernard, ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KNcCAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=immaculate+conc&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s The immaculate conception of the Mother of God, an exposition]'', 1855.

A number of countries are considered to be under the patronage of the Immaculate Conception by pontifical decree.

By royal decree under the [[House of Bragança]], it is the principal Patroness of [[Portugal]].

==Feast day==
[[File:Quadrittu (cropped).jpg|thumb|the procession of the ''Quadrittu'' of the Immaculate Conception taken on 7 December in [[Saponara]], [[Sicily]]]]
By 750, the feast of her conception (December 8) was widely celebrated in the Byzantine East, under the name of the Conception (active) of Saint Anne. In the West it was known as the feast of the Conception (passive) of Mary, and was associated particularly with the [[Normans]], whether these introduced it directly from the East&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/activities/view.cfm?id=1217 Francis X. Weiser, ''The Holyday Book'' (Harcourt, Brace and Co. 1956)]&lt;/ref&gt; or took it from English usage.&lt;ref name=Kunzler&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TObDrbvQFT4C&amp;pg=PA434&amp;dq=kunzler+liturgy+%22immaculate+conception%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Z-wqTuixFYiyhAf_oMSqCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Michael Kunzler, ''The Church's Liturgy'' (Continuum International 2002] {{ISBN|978-0-8264-1353-6}}), pp. 434-435&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of the feast, by now with the adjective "Immaculate" attached to its title, met opposition on the part of some, on the grounds that sanctification was possible only after conception.&lt;ref name=Holweck&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07674d.htm Frederick Holweck, "Immaculate Conception" in ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' 1910]&lt;/ref&gt; Critics included Saints [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Other theologians defended the expression "Immaculate Conception", pointing out that sanctification could be conferred at the first moment of conception in view of the foreseen merits of Christ, a view held especially by [[Franciscan]]s.&lt;ref name=Bunson&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dWpO1--eMrYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Matthew+Bunson,+#v=onepage&amp;q=Matthew%20Bunson%2C&amp;f=false Matthew Bunson, ''OSV's Encyclopedia of Catholic History'' (Our Sunday Visitor 2004] {{ISBN|978-1-59276-026-8}}), p. 455&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William of Ware]] and Blessed [[John Duns Scotus]] pointed out that Mary’s Immaculate Conception enhances Jesus’ redemptive work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/features/saints/saint.aspx?id=1223 Foley OFM, Leonard. "Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception", ''Saint of the Day'', (revised by Pat McCloskey OFM), AmericanCatholic.org]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the chief proponents of the doctrine was the Hungarian Franciscan [[Pelbartus Ladislaus of Temesvár]].

On 28 February 1476, [[Pope Sixtus IV]], authorized those dioceses that wished to introduce the feast to do so, and introduced it to his own diocese of Rome in 1477,&lt;ref name=Kunzler/&gt; with a specially composed Mass and Office of the feast.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Bryant, ''The Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God" (Boston 1855), p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; With his bull ''Cum praeexcelsa'' of 28 February 1477, in which he referred to the feast as that of the Conception of Mary, without using the word "Immaculate", he granted indulgences to those who would participate in the specially composed Mass or Office on the feast itself or during its [[octave (liturgical)|octave]], and he used the word "immaculate" of Mary, but applied instead the adjective "miraculous" to her conception.&lt;ref name="Catechetics Online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catecheticsonline.com/SourcesofDogma8.php|title=Catechetics Online|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724142046/http://www.catecheticsonline.com/SourcesofDogma8.php|archivedate=2011-07-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholicheritage.blogspot.com/search/label/Immaculate%20Conception|title=St. Conleth's Catholic Heritage Association: Immaculate Conception|author=Pilgrimages Committee|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 September 1483, referring to the feast as that of "the Conception of Immaculate Mary ever Virgin", he condemned both those who called it mortally sinful and heretical to hold that the "glorious and immaculate mother of God was conceived ''without'' the stain of original sin" and those who called it mortally sinful and heretical to hold that "the glorious Virgin Mary was conceived ''with'' original sin", since, he said, "up to this time there has been no decision made by the Roman Church and the Apostolic See."&lt;ref name="Catechetics Online"/&gt; This decree was reaffirmed by the [[Council of Trent]].&lt;ref name="Catechetics Online"/&gt;

[[Pope Pius V]], while including the feast in the [[Tridentine Calendar]], removed the adjective "Immaculate" and suppressed the existing special Mass for the feast, directing that the Mass for the Nativity of Mary (with the word "Nativity" replaced by "Conception") be used instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://civitas-dei.eu/cavendish.htm|title=cavendish|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.wdl.org/en/item/13761/ Decree of Our Most Holy Father Pope Paul V in Favor of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God]''.

On 6 December 1708, Pope Clement XI made the feast of the Conception of Mary, at that time still with the Nativity of Mary formula for the Mass, a [[Holy Day of Obligation]].&lt;ref name=Holweck/&gt; Until [[Pope Pius X]] reduced in 1911 the number of Holy Days of Obligation to 8, there were in the course of the year 36 such days, apart from Sundays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14342a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Supremi Disciplinae }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers such as Sarah Jane Boss interpret the existence of the feast as a strong indication of the Church's traditional belief in the Immaculate Conception.&lt;ref&gt;''Mary'' by Sarah Jane Boss, Neil Warmsley 2004 {{ISBN|0-8264-5788-6}} page 139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other churches==
For differing reasons, belief in Mary's immaculate conception in the Catholic doctrinal form is not part of the official doctrines of the [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches.

===Eastern Orthodox===
[[File:Perlez Mary-Immaculate.jpg|thumb|The Immaculate Conception is also portrayed by artists in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], for example Holy Mary in [[Perlez]], [[Vojvodina]], [[Serbia]].]]

Contemporary Eastern Orthodox Christians often object to the dogmatic declaration of her immaculate conception as an "over-elaboration" of the faith and because they see it as too closely connected with a particular interpretation of the doctrine of [[ancestral sin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=E16XzwPdJtsC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;dq=%22immaculate+conception%22+orthodox+church&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gKkuTtT1J4KwhQeXqYQp&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22mary%20did%20not%20die%22&amp;f=false John Meyendorff, ''The Orthodox Church: Its Past and Its Role in the World Today'' (St Vladimir's Seminary Press 1996] {{ISBN|978-0-913836-81-1}}), p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; All the same, the historical and authentic tradition of Mariology in Byzantium took its historical point of departure from Sophronios, Damascene, and their imitators. The most famous Eastern Orthodox theologian to imply Mary's Immaculate Conception was St. Gregory Palamas. Though many passages from his works were long known to extol and attribute to Mary a Christlike holiness in her human nature, traditional objections to Palamas' disposition toward the Immaculate Conception typically rely on a poor understanding of his doctrine of "the purification of Mary" at the Annunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Immaculate Conception: Why Thomas Aquinas Denied, While Duns Scotus, Gregory Palamas, and Mark Eugenicus Professed Absolute Immaculate Existence of Mary |date=Apr 28, 2014 |url=https://www.academia.edu/4375213/The_Immaculate_Conception_Why_Thomas_Aquinas_Denied_While_John_Duns_Scotus_Gregory_Palamas_and_Mark_Eugenicus_Professed_the_Absolute_Immaculate_Existence_of_Mary |author=Christiaan Kappes |pp=69-81 |location=Bedford, MA |publisher=Academy of the Immaculate |via=Academia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did he explicitly cite St. Gregory Nazianzen for his understanding of Jesus' purification at His baptism and Mary's at the Annunciation, but Theophanes of Nicaea, Joseph Bryennius, and Gennadios Scholarios all explicitly placed Mary's Conception as the first moment of her all-immaculate participation in the divine energies to such a degree that she was always completely without spot and graced.&lt;ref&gt;Christiaan Kappes, "The Immaculate Conception: Why Thomas Aquinas Denied, While John Duns Scotus, Gregory Palamas, and Mark Eugenicus Professed the Absolute Immaculate Existence of Mary" (Bedford, MA: Academy of the Immaculate, 2014), pp. 69-92, 157-169&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Emperor Manuel II and Gennadius Scholarius, St. Mark of Ephesus also fervently defended Mary's title as "prepurified" against the Dominican, Manuel Calecas, who was perhaps promoting thomistic Mariology that denied Mary's all-holiness from the first moment of her existence.&lt;ref&gt;Mark of Ephesus, On the Distinction between Essence and Energy: First Antirrhetic against Manuel Kalekas. Editio princeps, ed. M. Pilavakis (Unpublished doctoral dissertation), London 1987: "But He did so with her, after he prepurified (προκαθαρθείσῃ) her through a most profuse grace by means of the protecting Holy Spirit and divine power ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oriental Orthodox===
In the tradition of Ethiopian Orthodoxy, the [[Kebra Nagast]] says:
{{quote|He cleansed {{Smallcaps2|EVE'S}} body and sanctified it and made for it a dwelling in her for {{Smallcaps2|ADAM'S}} salvation. ''She [i.e., {{Smallcaps2|MARY}}] was born without blemish'', for He made her pure, without pollution, and she redeemed his debt without carnal union and embrace ... Through the transgression of {{Smallcaps2|EVE}} we died and were buried, and by the purity of {{Smallcaps2|MARY}} we receive honour, and are exalted to the heights.|[[Kebra Nagast]] (emphasis added)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/kn/kn096.htm|title=The Kebra Nagast: 96. Concerning the Prophecy about CHRIST|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Old Catholic===
While [[Old Catholics]] do not reject the Immaculate Conception of Mary, and some of their parishes venerate Mary as immaculately conceived and celebrate the feast of her Immaculate Conception, they do not accept its definition as a [[dogma]], since they reject papal infallibility and with it the Pope's authority to define dogma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naorcc.org/#!faq/civl |title=Frequently Asked Questions About The North American Old Roman Catholic Church |publisher=North American Old Roman Catholic Church |date= |accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestantism===
[[Martin Luther]], who initiated the [[Protestant Reformation]], said: "Mother Mary, like us, was born in sin of sinful parents, but the Holy Spirit covered her, sanctified and purified her so that this child was born of flesh and blood, but not with sinful flesh and blood. The Holy Spirit permitted the Virgin Mary to remain a true, natural human being of flesh and blood, just as we. However, he warded off sin from her flesh and blood so that she became the mother of a pure child, not poisoned by sin as we are. For in that moment when she conceived, she was a holy mother filled with the Holy Spirit and her fruit is a holy pure fruit, at once God and truly man, in one person."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brecht |first=Martin |year=1985 |series=Martin Luther |others=Translated by James Schaaf |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Fortress Press |volume=1 |title=His Road to Reformation, 1483–1521 |isbn=978-0-8006-2813-0 |page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Lutherans, such as the members of the [[Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church]], support the doctrine.

Most Protestants reject the doctrine because they do not consider the development of [[dogma]]tic [[theology]] to be authoritative apart from [[Bible|biblical]] [[exegesis]], and because the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception is not taught in the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Protestant faith'' by George Wolfgang Forell 1962 {{ISBN|0-8006-1095-4}} page 23&lt;/ref&gt; The formal pronouncement of Mary's Immaculate Conception by the Catholic Church in 1854 further alienated some Protestant churches largely due to its implication that not all have sinned.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus in history, thought, and culture: an encyclopedia, Volume 1'' by James Leslie Houlden 2003 {{ISBN|1-57607-856-6}} page&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anglicanism===
Belief in Mary's immaculate conception is not a doctrine within [[Anglicanism]], although it is shared by many [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholics]].&lt;ref&gt;''Our Lady Saint Mary'' by J.G.H. Barry, 2008, {{ISBN|0-554-24332-6}}, pages 25-27&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Church of England]]'s ''[[Common Worship]]'' prayer book, 8 December is designated a [[Lesser Festival]] of the ''Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary'' (without the adjective "immaculate").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hojrex0xtmEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Common+Worship&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MKYuTvrpNYbPhAel8dhP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Common Worship|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report "Mary: Faith and Hope in Christ", by the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission, concluded that the teaching about Mary in the two definitions of the Assumption and the Immaculate Conception can be said to be consonant with the teaching of the Scriptures and the ancient common traditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglicancommunion.org/ministry/ecumenical/dialogues/catholic/arcic/docs/mary_grace%20_and_hope.cfm Ecumenical Affairs - Dialogues - Anglican Roman Catholic] Paragraph 78 - Accessed 8 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; But the report expressed concerns that the Roman Catholic dogmatic definitions of these concepts implies them to be "revealed by God", stating: "The question arises for Anglicans, however, as to whether these doctrines concerning Mary are revealed by God in a way which must be held by believers as a matter of faith."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglicancommunion.org/ministry/ecumenical/dialogues/catholic/arcic/docs/mary_grace%20_and_hope.cfm Ecumenical Affairs - Dialogues - Anglican Roman Catholic] Paragraph 60 - Accessed 8 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than Anglo-Catholics, most [[Anglicans]] reject the doctrine that Mary was sinless and conceived without [[original sin]], often citing that it is not within the [[Holy Scripture]] and is against the redemptive role and purpose of [[Jesus Christ]] merited for all human beings.

==Prayers and hymns==
The [[Roman Missal]] and the [[Roman Rite]] [[Liturgy of the Hours]] naturally includes references to Mary's immaculate conception in the feast of the Immaculate Conception. An example is the antiphon that begins: "[[Tota pulchra es|Tota pulchra es, Maria, et macula originalis non est in te]]" ("You are all beautiful, Mary, and the original stain [of sin] is not in you." It continues: "Your clothing is white as snow, and your face is like the sun. You are all beautiful, Mary, and the original stain [of sin] is not in you. You are the glory of Jerusalem, you are the joy of Israel, you give honour to our people. You are all beautiful, Mary.")&lt;ref&gt;The text (in [[Latin]]) is given at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQh0jLR2Iks Tota Pulchra Es - GMEA Honor Chorus.]&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of the original [[Gregorian chant]] music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uJEr669ts|title=Tota pulchra es Maria, Canto gregoriano nella devozione mariana, studio di Giovanni Vianini, Milano|date=6 November 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; polyphonic settings have been composed by [[Anton Bruckner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k23PLEuG-h8|title=Anton Bruckner -  Tota pulchra es|date=3 October 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pablo Casals]], [[Maurice Duruflé]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhmVu7xgpBc|title=Maurice Duruflé: Tota pulchra es Maria|date=23 May 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grzegorz Gerwazy Gorczycki]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaqFtF2HDTk|title=Tota pulchra es - Grzegorz Gerwazy Gorczycki|date=17 June 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:no:Ola Gjeilo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DKooq6HWDI|title=TOTA PULCHRA ES GREX VOCALIS|date=21 May 2009|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[José Maurício Nunes Garcia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVH0fkNY-xA|title=Tota pulchra es, Maria Canto gregoriano nella devozione mariana|date=21 September 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[:de:Nikolaus Schapfl|Nikolaus Schapfl]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0KizZtM9-c|title=Tota Pulchra   -   Composed by Nikolaus Schapfl (*1963)|date=4 January 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other prayers honouring Mary's immaculate conception are in use outside the formal liturgy. The [[Immaculata prayer]], composed by Saint [[Maximillian Kolbe]], is a prayer of entrustment to Mary as the Immaculata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campus.udayton.edu/mary//prayers/consec01.html#2|title=Prayers of Consecration|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[novena]] of prayers, with a specific prayer for each of the nine days has been composed under the title of the Immaculate Conception Novena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/novena/immaculate.htm|title=Nine Days Of Prayer - Immaculate Conception|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ave Maris Stella]] is the vesper hymn of the feast of the Immaculate Conception.&lt;ref&gt;Sutfin, Edward J., ''True Christmas Spirit'', Grail Publications, St. Meinrad, Indiana, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; The hymn ''[[Immaculate Mary]]'', addressed to Mary as the Immaculately Conceived One, is closely associated with [[Our Lady of Lourdes|Lourdes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchyear.net/icprayers.html|title=Immaculate Conception Prayers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic representations==
{{Main|Roman Catholic Marian art}}
[[File:ImmaculateEmblem.jpg|thumb|right|Swiss emblem 16th century]]
During the Medieval period, the conception of Mary was symbolically depicted in the [[Joachim and Anne Meeting at the Golden Gate|Meeting at the Golden Gate]] and was an early scene in the many cycles of the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'', as a counterpart of the [[Annunciation]] showing the conception of Jesus. To some medieval viewers, the kiss was a literal representation of the moment of Mary's conception, while for others it was a symbolic representation. The 14th and 15th centuries were the highpoint of these depictions.  Gradually more allegorical depictions of the Immaculate Conception, featuring an adult Mary, replaced this scene in representing the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, James, ''Hall's Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art'', 1996 (2nd edn.), John Murray, {{ISBN|0719541476}}, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 1476 extension of the [[feast of the Immaculate Conception]] to the entire Latin Church reduced the likelihood of controversy for the artist or patron in depicting an image, so that [[emblem]]s depicting ''The Immaculate Conception'' began to appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/meditations/immac_con_images.html|title=The Immaculate Conception in Images|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many artists in the 15th century faced the problem of how to depict an abstract idea such as the Immaculate Conception, and the problem was not fully solved for 150 years. The Italian Renaissance artist [[Piero di Cosimo]] was among those artists [[Immaculate Conception (Piero di Cosimo)|who tried new solutions]], but none of these became generally adopted so that the subject matter would be immediately recognisable to the faithful.

The definitive [[iconography]] for the Immaculate Conception, drawing on the emblem tradition, seems to have been finally established by the master and then father-in-law of [[Diego Velázquez]], the painter and theorist [[Francisco Pacheco]]. Pacheco's iconography influenced other [[Spanish people|Spanish]] artists or artists active in Spain such as [[The Immaculate Conception Paintings by El Greco|El Greco]], [[Bartolomé Murillo]], [[Diego Velázquez]], and [[Francisco Zurbarán]], who each produced a number of artistic masterpieces based on the use of these same symbols.&lt;ref&gt;''Ésotérisme, gnoses &amp; imaginaire symbolique: mélanges offerts à Antoine Faivre'' by Richard Caron, Antoine Faivre 2001 {{ISBN|90-429-0955-2}} page 676&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Divine Mirrors: The Virgin Mary in the Visual Arts'' by Melissa R. Katz and Robert A. Orsi 2001 {{ISBN|0-19-514557-7}} page 98&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of this particular representation of ''The Immaculate Conception'' spread across the rest of Europe, and has since remained the best known artistic depiction of the concept: in a heavenly realm, moments after her creation, the [[spirit]] of Mary (in the form of a young woman) looks up in awe at (or bows her head to) God. The moon is under her feet and a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] of twelve stars surround her head, possibly a reference to "a woman clothed with the sun" from Revelation 12:1–2. Additional imagery may include clouds, a golden light, and [[putti]]. In some paintings the putti are holding [[Lilium|lilies]] and [[rose]]s, flowers often associated with Mary.&lt;ref&gt;''Our Lady in Art'' by Katherine Lee Rawlings Jenner 2009 {{ISBN|1-103-32689-9}} pages 3-9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TO JAVED'''&lt;br&gt;
''(On Receiving His First Letter From London)''

Create a place for thyself in the world of love;&lt;br&gt;
Create a new age, new days, and new nights.

If God grant thee an eye for nature's beauty,&lt;br&gt;
Converse with the silence of flowers; respond to their love.

Do not be beholden to the West's artisans,&lt;br&gt;
Seek thy sustenance in what thy land affords.

My ''ghazal'' is the essence of my life-blood,&lt;br&gt;
Create thy elixir of life out 'of this essence.

My way of life is poverty, not the pursuit of wealth;&lt;br&gt;
Barter not thy Selfhood; win a name in adversity.[http://www.allamaiqbal.com/works/poetry/urdu/bal/translation/part06/28.htm]

{{Other people|John Bacon}}

'''John Baconthorpe''' (also '''Bacon''', '''Baco''', and '''Bacconius''') ({{circa}} 1290 – 1347) was a learned English [[Carmelite]] [[monk]] and [[scholastic philosopher]].{{sfn|Zimmerman|1913}}

==Life==
John Baconthorpe was born at [[Baconsthorpe]], Norfolk,&lt;ref name="Pasnau"/&gt; he seems to have been the grandnephew of [[Roger Bacon]] (Brit. Mus. Add. MS. 19. 116). In youth, he joined the [[Carmelite]] Order, becoming a [[friar]]&lt;ref name="Gracia"&gt;Gracia, J. J. &amp; Noone, T. B. (2003). A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages. Oxford: Blackwell. pg. 338-9.&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Blakeney, Norfolk|Blakeney]],&lt;ref name="Pasnau"&gt;Pasnau, R. (2010), The Cambridge History of Medieval Philosophy, Vol. II. Cambridge. pg. 291–292.&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Walsingham]]. He studied at [[Oxford]]&lt;ref name="Pasnau"/&gt; and Paris. He became regent master of the theology faculty at Paris by 1323.&lt;ref name="Gracia"/&gt; He is believed to have taught theology at Cambridge and Oxford.&lt;ref name="Pasnau"/&gt; Eventually, he became known as ''doctor resolutus,''&lt;ref name="Nolan"&gt;Nolan, S. (2011) "John Baconthorp." Encyclopedia of Medieval Philosophy. Lagerlund: Springer, Henrik (Ed.) XXIII, 1423.&lt;/ref&gt; though the implication of this is unclear.

He was a provincial prior of England from 1327–33.&lt;ref name="Pasnau"/&gt; He appears to have anticipated [[John Wycliffe|Wycliffe]] in advocating the subordination of the clergy to the king. In 1333 he was sent for to Rome, where, we are told, he first maintained the pope's authority in cases of divorce; but this opinion he retracted. He died in London, around 1347.&lt;ref name="Pasnau"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gracia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nolan"/&gt;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Long after his death, during the Renaissance, he became known as the authority on Carmelite theology.&lt;ref name="Nolan"/&gt;

==Works==
There are various surviving written works by Baconthorpe. His best-known work, a commentary on the ''Sentences'' by Peter Lombard, survives in multiple versions.&lt;ref name="Pasnau"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gracia"/&gt; Nearly three centuries later, it was still studied at [[Padua]], the last home of [[Averroism]], and [[Lucilio Vanini]] spoke of him with great veneration.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} (The text can be found in original Latin under the title ''Doctoris resoluti Joannis Bacconis Anglici Carmelitae radiantissimi opus super quattuor sententiarum libris''.) Additionally, there are three ''Quodlibeta'', questions on canon law, and commentaries on the Gospel of Matthew, Augustine, and Anselm that have survived.&lt;ref name="Pasnau"/&gt;

==Philosophy==
Although well versed in various theological perspectives, Baconthorpe was first and foremost a Carmelite. As a theologian, he made a point to defend the doctrine of Immaculate Conception, and to assert the importance of his order in the context of historical and spiritual tradition.&lt;ref name="Nolan"/&gt; Similarly, Baconthorpe openly debated with his contemporaries, such as [[Henry of Ghent]], [[Duns Scotus]], and [[Peter Auriol]],&lt;ref name="Gracia"/&gt; and consistently challenged the perspectives of earlier philosophers.&lt;ref name="Nolan"/&gt; He even took issue with fellow Carmelites such as [[Gerard of Bologna]], [[Guido Terreni]], and [[Robert Walsingham (Carmelite)|Robert Walsingham]].&lt;ref name="Nolan"/&gt;

Baconthorpe is commonly viewed as an Averroist (a follower of [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd]], or Averroes in the Latin world), though it is unlikely he viewed himself as such. He was given the title ''princeps Averroistarum'', meaning "prince of Averroists," by masters at the University of Padua centuries after his death.&lt;ref name="Nolan"/&gt; Further, he was given this title not because he agreed with Averroes, but merely because of his skill in explaining some of Averroes' philosophical ideas.&lt;ref name="Nolan"/&gt; Most notably, in his ''Sentences'' commentary, he discusses the perspective of Averroes in great depth, along with that of [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="Gracia"/&gt; Similarly, [[Ernest Renan|Renan]] says that he merely tried to justify Averroism against the charge of [[heterodoxy]]. Averroes was certainly a relevant influence on Baconthorpe, and he would sometimes reference Averroes' commentaries in making his own arguments;&lt;ref name="Nolan"/&gt; however, he commonly referenced other theologians, including many of his contemporaries,&lt;ref name="Gracia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nolan"/&gt; thus it should not be assumed that Averroes was the primary influence on Baconthorpe's thinking.

Perhaps the most important influence on John Baconthorpe was the Oxford and Paris [[Condemnations of 1277]],&lt;ref name="Gracia"/&gt; in which teaching any of 219 philosophical and theological theses was prohibited by the Bishop, [[Stephen Tempier]].&lt;ref name="Thijssen"&gt;Thijssen, H. (2008, Fall). "Condemnation of 1277", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/condemnation/].&lt;/ref&gt; Baconthorpe openly disagreed with many of these prohibited works, such as those by [[Giles of Rome]] and [[Godfrey of Fontaines]].&lt;ref name="Nolan"/&gt; This ultimately served to support the doctrines of the church. He paid particular attention to [[Thomas Aquinas]]' works on natural philosophy,&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;Wallace, W. A. (1982). "St. Thomas’s conception of natural philosophy and its method", in ''La Philosophie de la nature de Saint Thomas d’Aquin'', Pontificia Editrice Vaticana. pg. 7–27.&lt;/ref&gt; which Baconthorpe comes to target in many of his arguments.&lt;ref name="Gracia"/&gt; In contrast to Aquinas, Baconthorpe's perspective was that there are two substances, the human body and the eternal soul.&lt;ref name="Gracia"/&gt; Baconthorpe’s perspective on angels was similarly influenced by the Condemnations at Paris, in strict opposition to Aquinas.&lt;ref name="Gracia"/&gt;

Many of Baconthorpe’s theological discussions focus largely on the form and function of humanity. In accordance with the notion that the human body and the eternal soul are separate entities, he asserted that the soul is the cause of intellect—specifically, that the soul is an intellectual substance which renders the human form intelligible.&lt;ref name="Etzwiler"&gt;Etzwiler, J. P. (1971), "Baconthorp and the Latin Averroism: The Doctrine of the Unique Intellect", Carmelus, 19: 235–292.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, he still believed that free will exists, without decisions necessarily having a cause.&lt;ref name="Gracia"/&gt; Effectively, he believed that souls make their own decisions which are imposed on human bodies, but God maintains a complete knowledge of each soul and each decision that will be made.&lt;ref name="Gracia"/&gt; As a result, he denies the possibility of any material mechanisms being involved in intellect.&lt;ref name="Nolan"/&gt;

'''Leonard Sylvan Peikoff''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|iː|k|ɑː|f}}; born October 15, 1933) is a [[Canadian-American]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]].&lt;ref name="sitebio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peikoff.com/biography/ |title=Biography |work=Peikoff.com |accessdate=January 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] and was a close associate of [[Ayn Rand]], who designated him heir to her estate after her death. He is a former professor of philosophy and host of a nationally syndicated [[Talk radio|radio talk show]]. He co-founded the [[Ayn Rand Institute]] (ARI) in 1985 and is the author of several books on philosophy.

==Early life and career==
Leonard Peikoff was born on October 15, 1933,&lt;ref name=cao&gt;''Contemporary Authors Online'', s.v. "Leonard Peikoff." Accessed March 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], Canada, to Samuel Peikoff, [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], a surgeon, and his wife Bessie, a band leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peikoff |first=Samuel |title=Yesterday's Doctor: An Autobiography |location=Winnipeg |publisher=Prairie Publishing |year=1980 |isbn=0-919576-16-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[University of Manitoba]] from 1950 to 1953 as a pre-med student, but following his early discussions with Rand, he transferred to [[New York University]] to study philosophy, where he received his BA, MA, and PhD degrees in philosophy in 1954, 1957, and 1964, respectively. His doctoral dissertation adviser was the noted American [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosopher [[Sidney Hook]], and his dissertation dealt with the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] status of the [[law of noncontradiction]]. He taught philosophy for many years at various colleges.&lt;ref name=cao/&gt;

==Early involvement in Objectivism==
{{obj}}
Peikoff first met [[Ayn Rand]] through his cousin [[Barbara Branden]] (then Barbara Weidman) in California when he was 17. He reports that this meeting with Rand made him aware of the profound importance of philosophy. When Rand moved to New York City in 1951, Peikoff decided to study philosophy at [[New York University]]. While studying at NYU, he frequently discussed philosophy privately with Rand in depth across a range of issues.

Peikoff, along with [[Nathaniel Branden]], [[Alan Greenspan]], Barbara Branden, and a number of other close associates, who jokingly called themselves "[[Objectivist movement#The Collective|The Collective]]", met frequently with Rand to discuss philosophy and politics, as well as to read and discuss Rand's then-forthcoming novel, ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', in her [[Manhattan]] apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=242–243}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, Branden founded the Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later renamed the [[Nathaniel Branden Institute]] (NBI), to promote Objectivism through lectures and educational seminars around the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peikoff was among NBI's first lecturers, teaching a course on the history of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1960s, NBI had representatives in multiple cities who replayed taped versions of the lectures to local audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions with Peikoff and [[Allan Gotthelf]] in the 1960s motivated Rand to complete an extended monograph on concept-formation, ''[[Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McConnell|2010|pp=339–340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand included Peikoff's essay on the "[[analytic-synthetic dichotomy]]" when it was published in book form in 1979.&lt;ref name="Gladstein2009p82"&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peikoff was also an active participant in Rand's 1969–71 "Workshops" on the monograph, as well as subsequent, smaller philosophy workshops at Rand's apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McConnell|2010|pp=341–342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peikoff later used the transcripts of these workshops to create an expanded edition of ''Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology'', which he co-edited with Harry Binswanger.&lt;ref name="Gladstein2009p82"/&gt;

Following the dissolution of NBI in 1968, Peikoff continued to give private lecture courses on a variety of topics to large Objectivist audiences, and recordings of these have been sold for many years. His lecture courses include: ''The History of Philosophy'' (in two "volumes" of lectures), ''An Introduction to Logic'', ''The Art of Thinking'', ''Induction in Physics and Philosophy'', ''Moral Virtue'', ''A Philosophy of Education'', ''Understanding Objectivism'', ''The Principles of Objective Communication'', and ''Eight Great Plays''. Rand endorsed his 1976 lecture series on Objectivism as the best exposition of her philosophy, the only one she knew to be accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |ref=harv |title=[[Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand]] |last=Peikoff |first=Leonard |location=New York |publisher=[[E. P. Dutton]] |year=1991 |isbn=0-452-01101-9 |oclc=28423965 |pages=xiii–xv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peikoff's first book, ''[[The Ominous Parallels]]'', was both an Objectivist explanation of the rise of the [[Third Reich]] and the [[Holocaust]], and a warning that America was being led down the road to [[totalitarianism]] because of far-reaching philosophical and cultural parallels between [[Weimar Germany]] and the present-day United States. In her introduction, Rand said it was the first book by an Objectivist philosopher other than herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |contributor-last=Rand |contributor-first=Ayn |last=Peikoff |first=Leonard |contribution=Introduction |year=1982 |title=The Ominous Parallels: The End of Freedom in America |publisher=Stein and Day |location=New York |isbn=0-8128-2850-X |pages=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After Rand's death==
Rand named Peikoff the legal heir to her estate. As the [[executor]] of Rand's will, Peikoff handles the copyrights to all of her works (with the exception of ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'', which has passed into the [[public domain]]). He has supervised the editing and release of Rand's unpublished works in several volumes, including her letters, philosophical journals, and the fiction not published in her lifetime, and he has written forewords for all the current printings of her fiction. For several years, he continued Rand's tradition of lecturing annually at [[Boston]]'s [[Ford Hall Forum]], and his other lecture appearances have included an address to the cadets at [[West Point Military Academy|West Point]] and another while cruising the [[Greek islands]].&lt;ref&gt;''Leonard Peikoff: In His Own Words'' (DVD), Ayn Rand Bookstore.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Peikoff founded the [[Ayn Rand Institute]]. Peikoff revised his 1976 lecture course on Rand's ideas into book form as ''[[Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand]]'', published in 1991, the first comprehensive presentation of Objectivism. In the mid-1990s, Peikoff taught courses at the Ayn Rand Institute's Objectivist Graduate Center (which was renamed the Objectivist Academic Center in 2000), along with [[Harry Binswanger]] and [[Peter Schwartz (writer)|Peter Schwartz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aynrand.org/academic/background_oac.html |title=Objectivist Academic Center: A Timeline of ARI's Academic Projects |date=December 14, 2001 |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011214144550/http://www.aynrand.org/academic/background_oac.html |archivedate=December 14, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1995 through 1999, Peikoff hosted a nationally syndicated [[talk radio|talk-radio]] show focusing on philosophy and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Objectively Speaking: Ayn Rand Interviewed |editor1-last=Podritske |editor1-first=Marlene |editor2-last=Schwartz |editor2-first=Peter |editor2-link=Peter Schwartz (writer) |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7391-3195-4 |oclc=267048088 |lastauthoramp=y |page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; From February 2006 to June 2007, Peikoff posted an online Q and A of questions relating that had been e-mailed to him. This was replaced with a podcast that debuted on October 22, 2007, and continued until October 31, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peikoff.com/2016/10/31/leonard-peikoffs-final-podcast/ |title=Leonard Peikoff's final podcast |first=Leonard |last=Peikoff |publisher=Peikoff.com |date=October 31, 2016 |access-date=October 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peikoff's lectures or books have been used extensively in the works of [[Allan Gotthelf]], [[Harry Binswanger]], [[Andrew Bernstein]], and [[Tara Smith (philosopher)|Tara Smith]], writers who are associated with the Ayn Rand Institute, and also in works such as [[David Kelley]]'s ''The Evidence of the Senses'', [[George H. Smith]]'s ''[[Atheism: The Case Against God]]'', and the treatise, ''What Art Is: the Esthetic Theory of Ayn Rand'' by Louis Torres and Michelle Marder Kahmi, despite these authors' other differences with him.&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g., Gotthelf, Allan, ''On Ayn Rand'', Wadsworth Philosophers Series, 2000, pp. 3, 100; Smith, Tara, ''Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics: the Virtuous Egoist'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 2006, pp. 148–191; Binswanger, Harry, ''The Biological Basis of Teleological Concepts'', ARI, 1990, pp. 234, 237; Bernstein, Andrew, ''The Capitalist Manifesto'',  University Press of America, 2005, pp. 172, 183, 188; Kelley, David, ''The Evidence of the Senses'', Louisiana State University Press, 1986, pp. vii, 120 (on p. vii, Kelley credits Peikoff with helping to "shape" his "understanding of many issues ... at the deepest level"); Smith, George H., ''Atheism: the Case Against God'', Prometheus, 1989, pp.125–162, 336–337, n17, n18, n31 (first pub. Nash, 1974; in note 31, p. 337, e.g., Smith indicates that his own "approach to certainty" is that presented by Peikoff in a series of lectures); Torres, Louis, and [[Michelle Marder Kamhi|Kamhi, Michelle Marder]], ''What Art Is: the Esthetic Theory of Ayn Rand'', Open Court, 2000, pp. 30, 32, 41, 51, 298–299, 305, 332n81, 333n5, 333n86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peikoff's 1983 lecture course ''Understanding Objectivism'' was edited into a book of the same title by Michael Berliner, editor of the ''[[Letters of Ayn Rand]]'', and Peikoff's theory of [[Inductive reasoning|logical induction]], first presented in the lecture courses ''Induction in Physics and Philosophy'' and ''Objectivism Through Induction'', has been developed further by David Harriman in his book, ''The Logical Leap: Induction in Physics''. In his 2012 book ''The DIM Hypothesis,'' Peikoff defines the three approaches to cognitive integration—disintegration, integration, and misintegration—and applies the hypothesis to [[physics]], [[philosophy]], [[education]], [[politics]], and other fields.

His articles have appeared in publications as diverse as ''[[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]]'' and ''[[The New Scholasticism]]'', and his television appearances have ranged from [[Bill Maher]]'s ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' and [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly's]] ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' to [[C-SPAN]] panel discussions. He also appears in ''[[Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life]]'', the [[Academy Award]]-nominated documentary by [[Michael Paxton]].

=== Split with David Kelley ===
Peikoff views Objectivism as a "closed system" that consists solely of the philosophical principles Rand herself had articulated, and he considers disagreement with any of these principles a departure from Objectivism. The Ayn Rand Institute promotes Peikoff's view of Objectivism.

The closed vs. open issue came to the fore when David Kelley, a philosopher then affiliated with Peikoff and ARI, published his essay "A Question of Sanction", arguing for greater open-mindedness in working with other groups. Kelley sees Objectivism as an "open system" that can evolve beyond Rand's own writings and beliefs. Peikoff presented his objections to Kelley in an article called "Fact and Value". arguing that Kelley's case itself contradicted Rand's understanding of the relationship between cognition and evaluation, facts, and moral values.  Peikoff concluded that Kelley was not a genuine Objectivist, and urged anyone agreeing with Kelley to leave the Objectivist movement.&lt;ref name=fav&gt;{{cite web |last=Peikoff |first=Leonard |url=https://ari.aynrand.org/issues/culture-and-society/religion-and-morality/Fact-and-Value |title=Fact and Value |publisher=[[Ayn Rand Institute]] |date=May 18, 1989 |access-date=October 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Kelley responded by founding the Institute for Objectivist Studies in 1990, which later changed its name to The Objectivist Center and finally [[The Atlas Society]]. (For more on the Peikoff-Kelley split, see [[Objectivist Movement#Peikoff–Kelley split]].)

===Library of Congress dispute===
Peikoff inherited many of Rand's [[manuscript]]s. During her lifetime, Rand had made a statement that she would bequeath her manuscripts to the [[Library of Congress]]. She later had reservations, and the bequest was not part of Rand's will. However, after her death, the Library of Congress requested the manuscripts. In July 1991, Peikoff had an assistant deliver the manuscripts of Rand's novels, except for the first and last pages of ''[[The Fountainhead]]'', which he had framed. In their stead, he had the pages photocopied so that the manuscripts would be "complete". On August 16, 1998, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published an article about Peikoff, including a joke he made about "stealing" the pages from the Library of Congress. The Library demanded that he deliver the pages to them, deeming them to be [[Federal government of the United States|U. S. government]] property. A complaint from the [[U. S. Department of Justice]] followed in October 2000, claiming over a million dollars in damages unless Peikoff turned over the pages. After consulting his lawyer, Peikoff released the pages to a representative of the Library of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=412–413}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Peikoff |first=Leonard |url=http://www.peikoff.com/essays/library.htm |title=Peikoff's Experience with the Library of Congress |date=February 13, 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417050423/http://www.peikoff.com/essays/library.htm |archivedate=April 17, 2008 |accessdate=September 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought==

===Epistemology===
In his book ''The Logical Leap: Induction in Physics'' (which he co-wrote with physicist David Harriman), Peikoff argues that there is no [[problem of induction]], because [[philosophy]] is itself an inductive science and, therefore, that any attempt to deny the validity of induction contradicts itself by implicitly accepting the validity of induction. Peikoff and Harriman also argue that scientific claims verified by induction should be considered true until new evidence warrants modifying or amending them because scientific knowledge derived from induction is contextual. In other words, those who on the basis of conclusive evidence make inductive scientific claims regarding science cannot argue that their claims are subject to no possible modification, but can argue that they are the only rational claims that can be believed based on the available evidence. They conclude that the same process of induction is essential to every rational field (except [[mathematics]]) and that, as a result, truth in any such field possesses the same [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] as that of [[physics]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Logical Leap: Induction in Physics'' NAL Trade&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
Peikoff supports ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]], arguing that the role of government in society should be limited to [[Minarchism|minarchist]] conceptions of protecting individuals from the [[initiation of force]] and [[fraud]]. He opposes [[taxation]], [[public education]], [[Welfare state|welfare]], business regulations, etc. He also opposes laws regulating [[pornography]], [[euthanasia]], [[stem cell research]], etc.  He is a supporter of abortion rights, but criticizes defenders of abortion who label themselves "[[pro-choice]]", arguing that the term ignores the deeper philosophical issues involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Leonard |last=Peikoff |url=http://www.capitalismmagazine.com/2003/01/abortion-rights-are-pro-life/ |title=Abortion Rights Are Pro-Life |date=January 23, 2003 |website=Capitalism Magazine |access-date=October 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that [[circumcision]] of a child too young to consent should be a crime and is evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Leonard |last=Peikoff |url=http://www.peikoff.com/2011/04/25/do-you-think-the-legal-guardians-of-a-male-child-have-the-right-to-circumcise-him-before-he-is-old-enough-to-refuse/ |title=Do you think the legal guardians of a male child have the right to circumcise him before he is old enough to refuse? |publisher=Peikoff.com |date=April 25, 2011 |access-date=October 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also continues Rand's opposition to libertarianism, remaining sharply opposed to any description of Objectivist political philosophy as "libertarian" and to any collaboration with most libertarian groups. He has been critical of American foreign policy, considering both [[Neoconservatism|neoconservative]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] views self-sacrificial. He objects to the terms "isolationist" or "interventionist" to describe his foreign policy views, stating that the only "intervention" the United States should enact is war and "only and when it is in self-defense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Leonard |last=Peikoff |url=http://www.peikoff.com/2010/04/06/are-you-dr-peikoff-an-interventionist-or-an-isolationist-in-regard-to-foreign-policy-2/ |title=Are you, Dr. Peikoff, an interventionist or an isolationist in regard to foreign policy? |publisher=Peikoff.com |date=April 6, 2010 |access-date=October 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Elián González====
Peikoff campaigned for [[Elián González]]'s right to remain in Florida, rather than returning to his father in [[Cuba]], stating, "To send a child to rot in the prison of Cuba for the alleged sake of his own well-being is criminal hypocrisy. To send him there in order to preserve his father's rights is absurdity, since there are no parental or other rights in Cuba. To send him there because 'He needs a father, no matter what' is a mindless bromide. Does he need a father who has no choice but to watch his son being broken in mind and starved in body?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capitalismmagazine.com/2000/01/a-sin-to-deport-eli/ |first=Leonard |last=Peikoff |title=A Sin to Deport Elian Gonzalez |website=Capitalism Magazine |date=January 20, 2000 |access-date=October 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Palestinians and Israel====
Peikoff claims that [[Palestinian people]] prior to the establishment of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] consisted solely of "nomadic tribes meandering across the terrain," and that "the Arabs" today have no concept of property rights; indeed, that their "primitivist" antagonism to such rights is the root cause of Arab terrorism. He argues that Israel is a moral beacon which should not return any territory to Arabs or even negotiate with them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://capitalismmagazine.com/1996/06/israels-and-americas-fundamental-choice-2/ ''Israel's and America's Fundamental Choice''], by Leonard Peikoff, ''Capitalism Magazine'', June 1, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iran and nuclear weapons====
Peikoff considers the nationalization of Middle Eastern oil properties developed by Western corporations — beginning with [[Iran]] in 1951 — to be in violation of international law and refers to such efforts as "confiscation" and supports covert actions to reverse such efforts, most notably [[Operation Ajax]] in 1953. He advocates bringing an end to what he claims are "terrorist states" and has routinely lobbied for [[regime change]] in Iran "as quickly as possible and with the fewest U.S. casualties, regardless of the countless innocents caught in the line of fire," not ruling out the use of nuclear weapons, arguing that moral responsibility for innocent deaths would lie with their governments rather than the United States. Conversely, he does not consider [[Saudi Arabia]] and other [[Salafism|Salafist]] monarchies to be "terrorist states" and views them as vital allies of the US and [[Israel]] against expanding Iranian influence in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Leonard |last=Peikoff |url=http://www.peikoff.com/essays_and_articles/end-states-who-sponsor-terrorism/ |title=End States Who Sponsor Terrorism |date=October 2, 2001 |access-date=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Presidential endorsements====
In April 1992, Peikoff endorsed "any Democrat nominated by his party for the [[President of the United States|Presidency]]", citing President [[George H. W. Bush]]'s "truly disgraceful" record, specifically [[Read my lips: no new taxes|tax hikes]], support for new employee protections, his foreign trade policy, [[foreign aid]] to [[Russia]], alleged hostility to Israel, the [[Gulf War]], [[United States pro-life movement|anti-abortion]] and [[United States obscenity law|anti-obscenity]] views, and alleged failure to defend [[Salman Rushdie]]'s freedom of speech during [[the Satanic Verses controversy|the ''Satanic Verses'' controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|2Ng8-dOSYHI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Peikoff endorsed [[John Kerry]] (despite thinking of Kerry as a "disgustingly bad" candidate) against [[George W. Bush]] (whom he called "apocalyptically bad"), on the basis of Bush's religiosity and his refusal to crush Islamic regimes, especially Iran, along with his "doomed" economic policies. In advance of the 2006 elections, Peikoff recommended voting only for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], to forestall what he sees is a rise in influence of the [[Christian right|religious right]], adding:

{{quote|Given the choice between a rotten, enfeebled, despairing killer [Democrats], and a rotten, ever stronger, and ambitious killer [Republicans], it is immoral to vote for the latter, and equally immoral to refrain from voting at all because "both are bad."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.peikoff.com/#whatsnew Q&amp;A: Peikoff on the coming election]", October 19, 2006, ''Peikoff.com''. Accessed November 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Of the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]], Peikoff said, "I wouldn't dream of voting", saying that the Republicans should be "wiped out" or "severely punished" for their association with the religious right. Furthermore, he characterized [[Barack Obama]] as "[[anti-American]]" and a "lying phoney" with troubling connections to both [[Islam]] and [[Jeremiah Wright controversy|Reverend Jeremiah Wright]]. He labelled Obama's running mate [[Joe Biden]] an "enjoyably hilarious windbag", and their Republican opponents [[John McCain]] and [[Sarah Palin]] as a "tired moron" and an "opportunist", respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peikoff.com/2008/10/20/dr-peikoff-for-whom-will-you-vote-for-the-presidential-election-this-november-2008-and-why/|title=Dr. Peikoff, for whom will you vote for the presidential election this November 2008, and why?  « Podcast « Peikoff|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 podcast,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peikoff.com/2010/07/05/what-is-the-proper-government-attitude-toward-immigration/|title=What is the proper government attitude toward immigration? « Featured Podcast « Peikoff|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peikoff explained why he supports immigration restrictions in the current context of the [[welfare state]], and why he does not see this as a contradiction to Objectivism's general rejection of immigration restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalismmagazine.com/politics/immigration/4620-Immigration-Quotas-Individual-Rights-The-Moral-and-Practical-Case-for-Open-Immigration.html Capitalism Magazine]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in a 2010 podcast, Peikoff explained that he does not support the building of a [[Park51 controversy|mosque near Ground Zero]] in [[New York City]], arguing that [[Private property|property rights]] are always contextual and that preventing the construction is a wartime necessity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Podcast|publisher=Leonard Peikoff|date= June 28, 2010|url=http://www.peikoff.com/2010/06/28/what-do-you-think-of-the-plan-for-a-mosque-in-new-york-city-near-ground-zero-isnt-it-private-property-and-therefore-protected-by-individual-rights/|accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, he supported the [[France|French]] ban on the ''[[burqa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peikoff.com/2010/11/15/what-should-an-objectivist-make-of-the-french-banning-of-burqas/|title=What should an Objectivist make of the French banning of burqas? « Podcast « Peikoff|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Peikoff endorsed [[Mitt Romney]] for the Presidency, citing President Obama's alleged [[nihilism]], [[taxation in the United States|taxation]], economic and [[Energy policy of the United States|energy policies]], [[Obamacare]], and his use of [[executive order]]s. However, Peikoff was not enthusiastic in his endorsement of Romney, calling him an "appeasing, directionless" candidate with "no political convictions" who would be useful for buying time. For the same reason, he endorsed the Republican [[United States Congress|Congressional]] nominees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peikoff.com/election/|title=Leonard on the Election « Peikoff|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, he called [[United States presidential election, 2012|Obama's re-election]] a "catastrophe", "the worst political event ever to occur in the history of this continent" and "worse than the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peikoff.com/2012/11/19/what-do-you-think-of-the-2012-presidential-election-results/|title=What do you think of the 2012 presidential election results? « Podcast « Peikoff|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luis Carlos Restrepo Ramírez''' (born 24 January 1954) is a Colombian psychiatrist and philosopher, who served as the 5th [[High Commissioner for Peace (Colombia)|High Commissioner for Peace of Colombia]] from August 2002 to March 2009.

While in Office, he was in charge of the controversial demobilization and disarmament of 32,000 paramilitaries of the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia]] and 13,000 guerrilla fighters.&lt;ref name=justiciao&gt;{{cite web|title=Justicia o persecución?|url=http://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/justicia-persecucion/253313-3/|publisher=[[Revista Semana]]|accessdate=1 July 2016|date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some time, the [[Government of Colombia]] considered him a [[fugitive]],&lt;ref name=pettesson&gt;{{cite web|last=Ohlsen Pettersson|first=Olle |title=Arrest warrant confirmed for Colombia’s ex-peace commissioner|url=http://colombiareports.com/arrest-warrant-confirmed-for-colombias-ex-peace-commissioner/|publisher=Colombia Reports|accessdate=4 July 2013|date=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dondeesta&gt;{{cite journal|title=¿Dónde está Luis Carlos Restrepo?|journal=[[Semana]]|date=19 January 2013|url=http://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/donde-esta-luis-carlos-restrepo/330074-3|accessdate=4 July 2013|location=Bogotá|language=Spanish|issn=0124-5473|oclc=7475329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dondeesta&gt;{{cite journal|title=Juez ordena captura de Luis Carlos Restrepo|journal=[[Semana]]|date=9 February 2012|url=http://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/juez-ordena-captura-luis-carlos-restrepo/253160-3|accessdate=4 July 2013|location=Bogotá|language=Spanish|issn=0124-5473|oclc=7475329}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the [[Supreme Court of Justice of Colombia]] issued an international [[arrest warrant]]&lt;ref name=pettesson/&gt;&lt;ref name=dondeesta/&gt; after Restrepo left the country on {{date|2012-01-08}} on a flight bound to the [[United States]];&lt;ref name=pettesson/&gt;&lt;ref name=dondeesta/&gt;&lt;ref name=dondeesta/&gt; his current whereabouts remain unknown, but he is presumed to have obtained [[political asylum]] in Canada.&lt;ref name=asylum&gt;{{cite web|title=Luis Carlos Restrepo consiguió asilo en Canadá|url=http://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/luis-carlos-restrepo-consiguio-asilo-en-canada/402054-3|publisher=[[Revista Semana]]|accessdate=1 July 2016|date=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ethnolinguistic map of China 1983.png|263x263px|thumb|right|The Geographic Distribution of Ethnic Minorities in the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Taiwan]]]]

The '''Theory of National Struggle''' ([[simplified Chinese]]: 民族斗争理论; [[traditional Chinese]]: 民族鬥爭理論; [[pinyin]]: Mínzú Dòuzhēng Lilùn), or '''Ethnic Struggle''', is one of [[Mao Zedong]]'s political theories on the application of [[Marxism]] in [[China]]. This theory is also [[Mao Zedong]]'s remedy to the "[[National Question]]" in Marxist theory. As a subset of the general philosophy of [[Mao Zedong Thought]], the theory of national struggle addresses the question of how classical Marxist-Leninist ideas of [[political economy]] should intersect with China's particular need for constructing a multi-ethnic national [[sovereignty]] without abandoning the universality of [[Marxism-Leninism]].

The amalgamation of Mao's two separate theories of revolution signified his theoretical departure from the general doctrine of [[Marxism-Leninism]] in [[Soviet Union]] and in [[Europe]], which strictly held the economic-determinist ideal that base determines superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knight|first1=Nick|title=Rethinking Mao: Explorations in Mao Zedong's Thought|date=2007|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Plymouth|isbn=0739117076|pages=197–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mao's theories not only addressed the primacy of nationalism in revolutionary mobilization, but also cast doubts on the classical Marxist notion of historical inevitability because Mao argued that a nationwide class consciousness could not be awaken in China unless cultivated by party leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dirlik|first1=Arif|title=Marxism in the Chinese Revolution|date=2005|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|location=Oxford|isbn=9780742530690|pages=75–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, by conflating the notions of "[[ethnicity]]" and "[[nationality]]," Mao justified the CCP's geopolitical claim over the former territories and ethnic minority subjects of the multi-ethnic [[Qing Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leibold|first1=James|title=Reconfiguring Chinese Nationalism: How the Qing Frontier and its Indigenes Became Chinese|date=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=1403974799|pages=81–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Mao came to power in the communist establishment during the [[Yan'an]] period, Mao's theory of "national struggle" became the guiding principle of ethnic and national liberation strategy of the Chinese Communist Party until his death in 1976.

{{Marxism–Leninism sidebar |expanded=concepts}}
One of the greatest theoretical conundrums in Marxism was the contradiction between internationalism and nationalism, the theory and praxis of proletarian revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Löwy|first1=Michael|title=Marxists and the National Question|url=https://newleftreview.org/I/96/michael-lowy-marxists-and-the-national-question|website=newleftreview.org|publisher=New Left Review|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the original [[Das Kapital]], Marx offered neither a systematic theory of the national question, a precise definition of the construct of the "nation," nor a general political strategy for the proletariat to seize state power. Even when Marx did talk about the political implications of the worker's state that he envisioned, his articles on the subject were, for the most part, strictly analytical and rooted in the concrete political cases derived from his historical observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Löwy|first1=Michael|title=Marxists and the National Question|url=https://newleftreview.org/I/96/michael-lowy-marxists-and-the-national-question|website=newleftreview.org|publisher=New Left Review|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the ambivalence on [[Power in international relations|statecraft]] in Marxist theory, Marxist theorists and revolutionaries from different regions and eras generally reinterpreted Marx in order to accommodate local demands for national sovereignty under pressure of global capitalist intervention.  In 1920, [[Lenin]] theorized that the creation of a national community must start with the unification of the oppressed races and ethnicities to create a worker's state, against the oppressive races and ethnicities of imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/chinese/Lenin/marxist.org-chinese-lenin-19200726.htm 列宁，1920，《民族和殖民地问题委员会的报告》]&lt;/ref&gt; In this process of unification, Lenin argued that the proletariat must lead the revolution by breaking through boundaries of geo-cultural of difference to reach people who were less enlightened, with the ultimate goal of creating a communist society under universal proletariat leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/chinese/Lenin/marxist.org-chinese-lenin-19221231.htm 列宁，1922，《关于民族或“自治化”问题》]&lt;/ref&gt; Lenin's approach to the classical "National Question" in 1920 also included a specific political strategy of liberation with regards to minority ethnicities, in which Lenin claimed that the oppressed races and ethnicities should reserve the right of ethnic-self determination once a universal worker's state is established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/chinese/Lenin/marxist.org-chinese-lenin-191402-05.htm 列宁，1914，《论民族自决权》]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Lenin argued that the principle of ethnic self-determination could prevent the proletariat from being corrupted by capitalist chauvinists, who would harness cultural difference and nationalism as a tool to divide the oppressed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/10900746.html 列宁，1914，《精致的民族主义对工人的腐蚀》]&lt;/ref&gt; In the later years of Soviet Union, [[Joseph Stalin]] would co-opt Lenin's approach to the "National Question" to advance and legitimize his own theory of "socialism in one state."

A devout critic of Stalin's "socialism in one state" theory, [[Leon Trotsky]] approached the "National Question" by combining Lenin's theory of "unified and uneven development" with his own insights on Marx's concept of "[[permanent revolution]]." Trotsky saw the [[Great War]] in Europe as a product of the contradiction between the productive forces and the restrictive framework of the nation-state, and he argued for the ultimate destruction of the nation-state system altogether once global communism was accomplished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Löwy|first1=Michael|title=Marxists and the National Question|url=https://newleftreview.org/I/96/michael-lowy-marxists-and-the-national-question|website=newleftreview.org|publisher=New Left Review|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He deemed the "National Question" as a temporary political form that would eventually diminish through the dialectics of historical development. Under Trotsky, Lenin's theory expanded into a revolutionary strategy which argued that backward countries do not need to pass through the same sequential stages of linear development already achieved by advanced societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trotsky|first1=Leon|title=Permanent Revolution and Results &amp; Prospects|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/pdf/prrp.pdf|website=marxists.org|publisher=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Trotsky argued that backwards societies and ethnic groups could "skip stages" of development by having the industrial proletariats from core nations lead the revolution and develop on their behalf. In doing so, Trotsky argued that the global proletariat could permanently prevent a capitalist restoration, advancing an internationalist vision of "unequal but simultaneous revolution" which fundamentally rejected Stalin's ideological premises.

In East Asia, theoretical approaches to the "National Question" were generally centered around the notions of ethnic development and national identity, since intellectuals in China and Japan constantly sought to redefine what it meant to be "modern" when their traditional cultural [[subjectivities]] were threatened, subverted, and dismembered by the colonial "west" in the wake of global capitalist intervention. Political scientist Germaine Hoston has recently written about the modification and reception of the "National Question" as it was transported from [[Europe]] and [[Soviet Union]] to East Asia by the [[Comintern]]. She argues that in [[Japan]] and [[China]], the significance of the national question expanded beyond the narrow focus of "nationality" in European Marxism (namely the attempt by ethnically distinct populations to construct their own national communities in the wake of rising transnational class consciousness) to include issues such as ethnic development, modernization, statecraft, cultural identity, and human agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoston|first1=Germaine|title=The state, identity, and the national question in China and Japan|date=1994|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=365–401|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, rather than simply being a political question of how to create a worker's state in latecomer societies, the "National Question" in East Asia evolved into a systematic power discourse which legitimized the absorption of culturally distinct minorities into the nascent multi-ethnic polity of  nation-building regimes like the [[PRC]]. In China, this metamorphism was generally lead by the CCP under the leadership of [[Mao Zedong]], although other important theorists also participated in the engineering of the theory of "National Struggle."

== History ==

Despite the canonization of [[Maoism]] in the People's Republic of China, Mao's theory of "national struggle" was not a monolithic construct that was unaffected by the vicissitudes of time. Neither was Mao the only contributor to China's unique Marxist political theory of ethnic liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knight|first1=Nick|title=Marxist Philosophy in China: From Qu Qiubai to Mao Zedong, 1923-1945|date=2005|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht, The Netherlands|isbn=1402038054|pages=1–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, Mao's political theory of "National Struggle" went through several stages of rhetorical and strategic development under the [[Long March]], the [[Yan'an Rectification Movement]], the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the [[Chinese Civil War]], and the [[People's Republic of China]]. Contemporary scholars of Mao Zedong Thought in the North American academia generally avoid periodizing the history of Maoist philosophy into strict categories of linear development. In the Chinese academia, however, the periodization and categorization of Mao Zedong Thought is encouraged by the state because it helps to establish Mao's theories as ideological doctrine. In general, Chinese scholars identify four to five developmental stages of Mao's National Struggle Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yang|first1=Haijiao|title=毛泽东民族理论论纲：历史演进、思想体系和实践价值|url=http://www.cssn.cn/zzx/xsdj_zzx/xrzl_yhj/201508/t20150819_2127459.shtml|website=cssn.cn|publisher=中国社会科学网|accessdate=19 November 2017|ref=探索}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early development: 1919–1934 ===
[[File:35-stalin-marxismandnationalquestion-russiandj.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Marxism and the National Question]]'' is s a short work of Marxist theory written by [[Joseph Stalin]] in January 1913 while living in Vienna. The book was reprinted in the USSR in 1934 as part of the book "Marxism and the National and Colonial Question.'']]

The First phase is the Inchoate Experimental Phase (May 1919 – October 1934).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yang|first1=Haijiao|title=毛泽东民族理论论纲：历史演进、思想体系和实践价值|url=http://www.cssn.cn/zzx/xsdj_zzx/xrzl_yhj/201508/t20150819_2127459.shtml|website=cssn.cn|publisher=中国社会科学网|accessdate=19 November 2017|ref=探索}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its early phase, leading Chinese Marxist intellectuals like [[Li Dazhao]] and [[Chen Duxiu]] focused on the direct application of classical Marxist theory in China, deriving insights from [[Karl Marx]]'s work "[[On the Jewish Question]]"  and Lenin and Stalin's commentary on the "[[National Question]]." To sum up, Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu believed that the "National Question" in China should be subservient to the larger transnational goal of proletarian liberation, blending Lenin's anti-imperialism theory with a vaguely nationalistic drive to create a strong Chinese nation with Marx's ultimate ideal of stateless communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoston|first1=Germaine|title=The state, identity, and the national question in China and Japan|date=1994|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=362–363|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less interested in the state's treatment of ethnic minority relationships or the political implications of ethnic liberation, both Li and Chen found Lenin's dichotomy of "the oppressed races against the oppressor races" a powerful tool which could end the national disunity that perpetuated China's humiliation after the 1919 [[Versailles treaty]] and the subsequent [[Twenty-One Demands]] from Japan. They argued for both the [[Comintern]] and the [[Chinese Communist Party]] to harness the momentum of nationalism as a binding social force for proletarian liberation, and urged for the collective self-determination of the "Chinese people" without considering how such theory could apply to marginal geographies and populations where class dynamism was less apparent. This intellectual trajectory would eventually confront great peril as the Chinese Communist Party was forced to reorganize itself after the 1927 [[Shanghai Massacre]], a notorious event which would later circulate in the CCP's orthodox historiography as a tragic case of class betrayal and state violence initiated by the capitalist [[Guomindang]] party.

Since the Shanghai coup in 1927 deprived the CCP of its ability to challenge Guomindang power in urban areas, the need for Chinese communists to reorganize its political power enabled the Moscow-based Comintern to directly intervene in CCP politics. According to the CCP's contemporary reconstructive memories about this period, the CCP since 1927 was plagued by an unfortunate succession of dogmatic leaders who obediently followed the Comintern's instructions by uncritically replicating Soviet policies onto the dissonant socioeconomic reality of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoston|first1=Germaine|title=The state, identity, and the national question in China and Japan|date=1994|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=362–363|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This orthodoxy maintains that, it was not until Mao's coming to power in the 1935 [[Zunyi Conference]] did the Chinese Communist Party finally confront with the errors of dogmatism and rectify its path towards a more systematic strategy of revolution which was complimentary to Mao's vision of national struggle. Nevertheless, the CCP leadership during this period espoused the notion that the Chinese approach to ethnic and national liberation must closely observe and corroborate the orthodoxy of the "New Philosophy" in the [[Soviet Union]], which were later canonized in the Constitution of Chinese Soviet Republic in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=中华苏维埃共和国宪法大纲 (1934)|url=http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66640/4489884.html|website=cpc.people.com.cn|publisher=中国共产党新闻|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Communist purge.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Guomindang troops rounding up Communist prisoners during the 1927 [[Shanghai Massacre]].]]

Before his ascension to political leadership in the Chinese Communist Party, Mao Zedong holistically embraced this Soviet ideological orthodoxy as the "correct" approach to the mobilization of ethnic minorities in China during the period of [[Guomindang]] administration. Corroborating the dominant Soviet thought in the Chinese Communist Party, Mao aligned himself with the Soviet strategy of ethnic liberation which saw the Leninist ethnic [[self-determination]] and confederate soviet socialist ethnic-autonomy as possible institutional models that China might follow if Communists might seize the power to create a multi-ethnic nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yang|first1=Haijiao|title=毛泽东民族理论论纲：历史演进、思想体系和实践价值|url=http://www.cssn.cn/zzx/xsdj_zzx/xrzl_yhj/201508/t20150819_2127459.shtml|website=cssn.cn|publisher=中国社会科学网|accessdate=19 November 2017|ref=探索}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the period of ideological dogmatism in the late 1920s and early 1930s, Mao grew increasingly skeptical of the Comintern leadership over the role of peasantry and rural-based nationalism in the Chinese Revolution. Especially after the [[Manchurian Incident]] in 1931 when Japan annexed the Chinese Northeast by establishing the puppet state of [[Manchukuo]], Mao and his followers placed themselves in direct opposition to the leadership of the Comintern to articulate a vision of socialism that was grounded on the immediate desire to restore Chinese national sovereignty from foreign colonial powers, deviating from the internationalist strategy of the Comintern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoston|first1=Germaine|title=The state, identity, and the national question in China and Japan|date=1994|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=362–363|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Mao's early writings reflect the growing schism in revolutionary theory. In February 1925, Mao wrote his first piece of ideological literature that directly dealt with the problem of ethnicity and national struggle in China. In his article named "the Analysis of Class Structure in Chinese Society (1925)," Mao identified two revolutionary groups in Chinese society, the peasants and the National Bourgeoisie, as potential allies of the Chinese proletariat revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mao|first1=Zedong|title=中国社会各阶级的分析 (1925)|url=https://www.marxists.org/chinese/maozedong/marxist.org-chinese-mao-19251201.htm|website=Marxists.org|publisher=Marxist Internet Archive|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mao, peasants are the most loyal and easily mobilized subjects of the Chinese revolutionary cause despite their obsession of commodity-exchange and land due to entrenched [[semi-feudal]], [[petty-bourgeois]] mentality. On the other hand, National bourgeoisies are only temporary allies of the [[proletariat]] because their major interests are [[capital accumulation]], which makes them dedicated to the preservation of national [[sovereignty]] and ethnic autonomy but not to the ultimate goal of socialist construction. These embryonic ideas of showed that Mao had already tried to fuse the notion of national and ethnic struggle with the theory of [[class struggle]] during the time of Soviet theoretical dominance.

=== Ideological consolidation: 1934–1937 ===
The second phase of theoretical development (October 1934 – July 1937) overlapped with the period of [[Long March]], when ideological hostilities toward the Guomindang's political theory of sovereignty coincided with the gradual accession of Maoist leadership within the Chinese Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yang|first1=Haijiao|title=毛泽东民族理论论纲：历史演进、思想体系和实践价值|url=http://www.cssn.cn/zzx/xsdj_zzx/xrzl_yhj/201508/t20150819_2127459.shtml|website=cssn.cn|publisher=中国社会科学网|accessdate=19 November 2017|ref=探索}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period of civil warfare, Mao's nascent political power cemented the dominance of his theory within the party leadership, which maintained that the project of restoring national sovereignty must take precedence before a nationwide campaign of class struggle.

[[File:Map of the Long March 1934-1935-en.svg|thumb|220px|left|Overview Map of the Route of the [[Long March]], 1934–1945. The Long March was a strategic military retreat to evade the continuous military pursuits by the [[Guomindang]].]]

When Mao ascended to party leadership in the CCP after the 1935 [[Zunyi Conference]] during the Long March, existing ideological schisms between Soviet and Chinese strategical approaches of the "National Question" and the "Ethnic Question" in China widened. One of the major disagreements was the role of ethnic minorities in Chinese revolution, which quickly expanded into a political debate about ethnic sovereignty and human agency. The original Leninist principle of ethnic liberation argued for a linear political strategy of liberation in which enlightened proletariats bind their revolutionary forces with ethnic minorities against capitalists, while assuming the responsibility to ideologically "uplift" and transform minorities into able proletariat fighters. Heralded by the pro-Comintern leaders of the CCP, this theory was the ideological cornerstone that buttressed CCP conceptions of statehood like national self-determination ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 民族自决; [[Pinyin]]: Minzu Zijue) and federated republic ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 联邦共和; [[pinyin]]: Lianbang Gonghe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leibold|first1=James|title=Reconfiguring Chinese Nationalism: How the Qing Frontier and its Indigenes Became Chinese|date=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=1403974799|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Mao disagreed with the Leninist model for two reasons: 1. The model of ethnic self-determination was inadequate for maintaining national unity; 2. The notion of ethnic "uplift" presupposes the passivity of ethnic minorities. For Mao, the ineffectuality of self-determination as a political model was self-explanatory, since this is the exact rhetoric which the Japanese Empire used to create the puppet state of [[Manchukuo]]. Shown in the example of [[Manchukuo]], the failure of China to maintain its territorial sovereignty in the Northeast was primarily due to Japan's appeal to ethnic minority (in this case, the Manchu ethnicity that was the ruling aristocrats of the former Qing dynasty) desires for self-determination. Thus, to prevent further national disunity in China as a result of capitalist imperialists using ethno-cultural difference to "divide-and-rule" the proletariat population, Mao argued for a stronger form of ethnic sovereignty with limited ethnic autonomy.

[[File:Manchukuo map.png|right|thumb|220px|Map of [[Manchukuo]], a [[puppet-state]] in Northeastern China created by the [[Japanese Empire]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and [[World War II]].]]

With regards to Mao's second disagreement with the Leninist principle, Mao argued for an active mobilization of ethnic minorities for the revolutionary war effort. As a remedy to Leninism's subjugation of minority agency, Mao replaced Lenin's overtly condescending phrase "small and weak ethnic groups" ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 弱小民族; [[Pinyin]]: ruoxiao minzu) with a more innocuous and ambiguous term "minority nationals" ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 少数民族; [[Pinyin]]: shaoshu minzu).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leibold|first1=James|title=Reconfiguring Chinese Nationalism: How the Qing Frontier and its Indigenes Became Chinese|date=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=1403974799|pages=100–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the fact that Mao refused to call ethnic minorities "inferior populations," he recognized that some of their conditions of socioeconomic production were more primitive than that of the Han-Chinese majority. As a result, Mao argued that the active mobilization of ethnic minorities must involve the simultaneous transformation of ethnic minority economic landscapes and the cultivation of class consciousness, which departed from the classical Marxist ideal of [[economic determinism]] ("base determines superstructure"). This notion of active transformation was predicated on the assumption that ethnic minorities inhabit in a more "backwards" (but not inferior) space of production.

In addition to the divergence from the Leninist principle of ethnic self-determination, Mao fervently rejected the Guomindang's theoretical conception of Chinese ethnic sovereignty. Here, the major disagreement came from Mao's idea that the "Chinese People" ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 中华民族; [[Pinyin]]: Zhonghua Minzu) was unified by ideology and cultural affinity, which contrasted with the Guomindang's narrative of a homogenous Chinese race tied by blood. In his writings, Mao dismissed the theory of Consanguineous Descent and Ethnic Sovereignty by the dominant [[Guomindang]] ([[Chinese Nationalist Party]]) regime. These dominant theories included the Three People's Ideology ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 三民主义; [[Pinyin]]: Sanmin Zhuyi) by [[Sun Yat-sen]] and the racial ideology of [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Sun Yat-sen's political ideal espoused the restoration of [[Han-Chinese]] dominance in China, which directly spoke to popular anti-[[Manchurian people|Manchurian]] sentiments during the late [[Qing Dynasty]]. Chiang Kai-shek went one step further by asserting that China is a racially and ethnically homogenous nation, with Han-Chinese being the ancestral inhabitant of China and all other ethnic minorities being sub-varieties of the Han.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mullaney|first1=Thomas S.|title=Coming to Terms with the Nation: Ethnic Classification in Modern China|date=2011|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520262782|pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mao critically rejected Chiang's theory and labelled him a "[[fascist]]" and "Han [[Chauvinist]]" for refusing to acknowledge the ethnic differences between Han-Chinese and other minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=毛泽东选集：第三卷|date=1991|publisher=人民出版社|location=北京|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mao's theory was also heralded by one of the key architects of the party ideology of Maoist thought, [[Li Weihan]], who pointed out the hypocrisy of Chaing's promise of "ethnic equality" in the KMT's national congress with regards to the ethnic education policies of the [[Hui Muslim]] population in Northwestern China. Like Mao, Li argued that the Hui Muslim population were not descendants of the Han people. Thus, the "correct" way to deal with their ethnic difference was not to impose traditional Han culture onto their ways of living, but to enforce ideological education in order to transform their belief from the Islamic religion to the "scientific truth of Marxism-Leninism." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yang|first1=Haijiao|title=毛泽东民族理论论纲：历史演进、思想体系和实践价值|url=http://www.cssn.cn/zzx/xsdj_zzx/xrzl_yhj/201508/t20150819_2127459.shtml|website=cssn.cn|publisher=中国社会科学网|accessdate=19 November 2017|ref=探索}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phase of theoretical development marks Mao's practical attempts to reconcile the internationalist rhetoric of Marxism-Leninism with the CCP's desire to construct a multi-ethnic nation-state.

=== Wartime nationalism: 1937–1949 ===

[[File:Mao proclaiming the establishment of the PRC in 1949.jpg|thumbnail|Mao declared the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] on October 1st, 1949. The seizure of state power by the CCP shifted the focus of Mao's National Struggle theory from "the protection of national sovereignty from external forces" to the "preservation of socialism from internal enemies." This paradigm shift would eventually lead to Mao's later decision to usher a "perpetual stage of internal struggle" during the intra-[[politicide]]s in the 1950s.]]

The third phase was the "New Democratic revolutionary phase" (July 1937 – October 1949).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yang|first1=Haijiao|title=毛泽东民族理论论纲：历史演进、思想体系和实践价值|url=http://www.cssn.cn/zzx/xsdj_zzx/xrzl_yhj/201508/t20150819_2127459.shtml|website=cssn.cn|publisher=中国社会科学网|accessdate=19 November 2017|ref=探索}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phase of theoretical development is marked by the consolidation of Mao's political theory as the party orthodoxy during the war against Japanese Invasion (also called the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]) from 1931–1945 and the subsequent war against the nationalists in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. During this period, Mao's political theory on ethnic sovereignty radically departed from the earlier Leninist approach that addressed the primacy of ethnic self-determination within the framework of Soviet Socialist Confederation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leibold|first1=James|title=Reconfiguring Chinese Nationalism: How the Qing Frontier and its Indigenes Became Chinese|date=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=1403974799|pages=147–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Mao dissented from Stalin's approach to the "National Question" which emphasized the creation of a Russia-centric Soviet Union ("Socialism in one country").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leibold|first1=James|title=Reconfiguring Chinese Nationalism: How the Qing Frontier and its Indigenes Became Chinese|date=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=1403974799|pages=147–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 13, 1941, the [[Soviet Union]] signed the [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact]] ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 日ソ中立条約 [[Romaji]]: Nisso Chūritsu Jōyaku), also known as the [[Japanese–Soviet Non-aggression Pact]] ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 日ソ不可侵条約 [[Romaji]]: Nisso Fukashin Jōyaku) with Japan two years after the brief Soviet–Japanese Border War (1939).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Japanese_Neutrality_Pact|website=en.wikipedia.org|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a retaliative reaction against USSR's non-aggression treaty with the [[Japanese Empire]] and Stalin's diplomatic recognition of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] as the head of China, Mao abandoned the USSR model of ethnic [[self-determination]] for the establishment of a unitary Chinese nation that would grant ethnic minorities partial ethnic autonomy under the Han-Chinese dominated CCP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leibold|first1=James|title=Reconfiguring Chinese Nationalism: How the Qing Frontier and its Indigenes Became Chinese|date=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=1403974799|pages=147–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian James Leibold, Mao's new ethnic-autonomy theory necessitated the construction of a new cultural narrative of what "China" consists of demographically, geo-politically, and ethnographically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leibold|first1=James|title=Reconfiguring Chinese Nationalism: How the Qing Frontier and its Indigenes Became Chinese|date=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=1403974799|pages=147–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mao's search for a nativist unity of the Chinese nation led to the theorization of a transitional phase of revolution that is absent in any other Marxist works outside of China. In Mao's theory of history, the stage of "[[New Democracy]]" is a transitional phase of interclass and interethnic unity before the seizure of state power by the Chinese Communist Party. In terms of the political ideal of "national struggle" and the theory of ethnic relationships, Mao proposed the construction of Ethnic Self-Autonomous prefectures under CCP leadership, deviating from the CCP's early conception of a loose multi-ethnic confederation as well as the so-called "[[fascist]]" conception of Han-centric homogeneous nationhood by the [[Guomindang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leibold|first1=James|title=Reconfiguring Chinese Nationalism: How the Qing Frontier and its Indigenes Became Chinese|date=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=1403974799|pages=147–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Liweihan2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Li Weihan]] (1896–84), a member of the 6th [[Politburo]] of the CCP and the head of the UFWD.]]

The CCP's theoretical departure from the USSR was accompanied by a series of institutional transformations. One of which was the establishment of a distinctively Chinese bureaucratic agency named the [[United Front Work Department]] (UFWD) ([[Written Chinese|Chinese]]: 中共中央统战部), dedicated to the regulation of ethnic relations and the preservation of national sovereignty under CCP leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Front Work Department|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Front_Work_Department|website=en.wikipedia.org|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UFWD was created in Yan'an in 1942 during the height of the Second-Sino Japanese War. Although the UFWD was originally designed exclusively to deal with ethnic problems and contrive strategies to mobilize non-party local elites for the war against Japanese invasion, the UFWD shifted its strategic focus to the antagonization of KMT and the mobilization of ethnic minorities for national unification after the defeat of Japanese empire in 1945. Until 1949, the UFWD dealt exclusively with the question of National Struggle in China, with its 9th Department and 10th Department specifically devoted to the regulation of wartime Sino-Tibetan and Sino-Uighur relationships. In 1942, [[Li Weihan]], the head of the UFWD, issued a strategic report to the CCP's Yan'an headquarters. In a report titled "Research on the Ethnic Question (1942)" ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 民族问题研究; [[Pinyin]]: Minzu wenti yanjiu) Li asserted that it was the responsibility of the "modern" Han majority, as China's ruling "Minzu" (ethnic group), to guide the Mongol, Hui, Tibetan, and other "backward minzus" toward their collective liberation and to foster the right environment in which "natural assimilation" ([[Written Chinese|Chinese]]: 自然同化) could forge a new, more evolutionarily robust national people. This argument was predicated on the assumption that ethnic minorities could skip stages of economic development and become actively transformed into modern proletariats by having their economic terrains and productive forces transformed by the CCP leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leibold|first1=James|title=Reconfiguring Chinese Nationalism: How the Qing Frontier and its Indigenes Became Chinese|date=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=1403974799|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Li Weihan's narrative corroborated Mao's innovative approach to the "National Question," which expanded the narrow focus on "national liberation" in European and Soviet Marxism to embrace issues as ethnic development, state building, cultural identity, and national sovereignty in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoston|first1=Germaine|title=The state, identity, and the national question in China and Japan|date=1994|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=365–401|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Practical confrontations: 1949–1965 ===
[[File:Xinjiang prfc map2.png|327x327px|thumb|right|Map of [[prefecture]]s of [[Xinjiang Autonomous Region]]. Regions highlighted in yellow are autonomous prefectures that are directly under the [[jurisdiction]] and [[administration (government)|administration]] of the [[Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps]] ([[Written Chinese|Chinese]]: 新疆生产建设兵团; pinyin: Xīnjiāng Shēngchǎn Jiànshè Bīngtuán), known as XPCC or Bingtuan (兵团; Bīngtuán) for short. Along with the Construction Corps sent to Heilongjiang ([[Manchuria]]), [[Yunnan]], [[Inner Mongolia]], and [[Fujian]] under the [[PRC]] regime, the Construction Corps in [[Xinjiang]] was one of the state-owned, para-institutional military enterprises that were dispatched to the frontiers of China for regional and ethnic development. The XPCC is the only surviving Corporation Corp in the PRC today.]]
[[File:Xizang prfc map.png|327x327px|thumb|right|Map of [[prefecture]]s of the [[Xizang Autonomous Region]], more widely known as [[Tibet]]. It was formally established in 1965 to replace the Tibet Area, an administrative division the PRC inherited from the KMT regime, about 5 years after the dismissal of the [[Kashag]] by the PRC following the [[1959 Tibetan uprising]], and about 13 years from the Tibet's incorporation into the PRC in 1951. Unlike the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, there were no Construction Corps sent to [[Tibet]]. Strategic constructions for national security were carried out directly by the Chinese military ([[People's Liberation Army|PLA]]). Before its incorporation into the PRC polity, the CCP had limited rule over Tibet. For further information, see [[History of Tibet (1950–present)]].]]

The fourth phase was the "Party Orthodoxy Phase" (October 1949 – May 1965), which was a period of ideological radicalization after the Chinese communists had seized state power in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yang|first1=Haijiao|title=毛泽东民族理论论纲：历史演进、思想体系和实践价值|url=http://www.cssn.cn/zzx/xsdj_zzx/xrzl_yhj/201508/t20150819_2127459.shtml|website=cssn.cn|publisher=中国社会科学网|accessdate=19 November 2017|ref=探索}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period of Maoist theoretical development is marked by the problems that stemmed from the CCP's practical confrontations with the reclamation of [[Manchuria]], [[Xinjiang]], and [[Tibet]]. Although Mao's political theory with regards to the regulation of ethnic minorities remained static during this time, this period is characterized by a series of political flip-flops, accomplishments, as well as disasters like the [[Hundred Flowers Campaign]], the [[land reforms]], the [[collectivization]] of agriculture, the [[Great Leap Forward]], and the [[Great Chinese Famine|Great Famine]].

The most salient ideological crisis during this period was the inconsistency between the theory and praxis of the CCP with regards to local bureaucratic administration, ethnic education, and cultural preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leibold|first1=James|title=Reconfiguring Chinese Nationalism: How the Qing Frontier and its Indigenes Became Chinese|date=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=1403974799|pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, these problems entailed the paradoxical treatment of ethnic [[Tibetans]], [[Uyghurs]] and [[Hui Muslim]] people by the Chinese Communist Party. On the one hand, the CCP promised ethnic equality by allowing limited degrees of cultural autonomy for minorities. On the other hand, the CCP imposed ideological education in ethnic schools and discouraged minorities from observing their cultural religious traditions because they have contradicted with the CCP's conception of Socialist [[Modernity]]. The theoretical remedy by Mao was to establish a unifying principle of "continuous National Struggle" that was unilaterally applied to each jurisdictional territories of ethnic autonomy. As a modification of Mao's earlier "National Struggle" theory, this theory argues that the quest for national struggle continues after the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949. This is because Mao reasoned that there was an unequal development of economic modes of production, social relations of production, and class consciousness between the ethnic minority hinterlands and the Han-majority urban areas in China. For example, in the Conference of the Central Committee in 1953, Mao stated that "some ethnic groups in Yunnan region continue to practice tribalism and live in primitive economic conditions of production."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=关于过去几年内党在少数民族中进 行工作的主要经验总结 (1953)|url=http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66659/4492943.html|website=cpc.people.com.cn|publisher=中国共产党新闻|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mao's solution to this problem was the criminalization of the practice of ethnic religions, accompanied by a series of land redistribution campaigns and technological experiments directed by sent-down cadres of the Constructions Corps.

During the prelude to the [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1966–1976, the difficulties of maintaining China's ethnic sovereignty also intersected with the problem of what Mao called the "Restoration of [[Capitalism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Esherick|first1=Joseph W.|title=On the "Restoration of Capitalism": Mao and Marxist Theory|journal=Modern China|date=1979|volume=5|issue=1|pages=41–78|ref=Sage Publications, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mao's unique view of [[historical materialism]] rendered his conclusion that seizure of [[Political power|state power]] and [[means of production]] by the Communists was not the end goal, but the beginning of socialist construction. Having based his revolution on the [[peasantry]] — the [[petty bourgeoisie]] of the countryside according to [[Lenin]] — Mao reasoned that the only way for the nation to secure its path towards Socialist Construction was to usher a perpetual campaign of national, ethnic, and class struggle even after the Communists have nationalized private capital and controlled the state apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Esherick|first1=Joseph W.|title=On the "Restoration of Capitalism": Mao and Marxist Theory|journal=Modern China|date=1979|volume=5|issue=1|pages=41–78|ref=Sage Publications, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Throughout the years of political radicalization, the Maoist theory of "national struggle" gradually diverged from the Soviet theory of revolution, which was guided by the Leninist principle of national [[self-determination]] within the [[USSR]] and [[Leon Trotsky]]'s internationalist approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Löwy|first1=Michael|title=Marxists and the National Question|url=https://newleftreview.org/I/96/michael-lowy-marxists-and-the-national-question|website=newleftreview.org|publisher=New Left Review|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Mao initially followed Stalin's strategy towards the "National Question," Mao eventually discarded that idea when he faced a different demographic geography of ethnic identities in China's vast multi-ethnic terrain. In practice, Chinese communists under Mao's leadership approached the question of [[Xinjiang]] Insurrection, [[Tibet]]an Independence, and [[Hui Muslim]] dissent as problems that challenged the Chinese national sovereignty after the establishment of the PRC regime in 1949. The theoretical solution by Mao's party state was to reduce all of problems arising from the state's regulation of ethnocultural difference into an unequal distribution of the forces and relations of production.

== Impact ==
The international reception of Mao's theory of "national struggle" ranges from total rejection to critical appreciation. In the United States, rightist theorists have criticized Mao's theory of "national struggle" as the classical demonstration of hypocrisy within the socialist rhetoric of liberation. Other leftist scholars saw Mao's political theory as a capricious desire to subordinate Marx's dialectical historicism in the favor of China's particular realities in justification of Mao's political power. During the Cold War, the Maoist theory of "national liberation" was heralded by some French Marxists and Pan-Africanists as genuine political guidelines that could possibly provide a solution for self-sufficient development in [[third world]] economies if properly applied. After the death of Mao and the conclusion of the [[Cultural Revolution]] in 1976, public perception of Mao's political theory started turn negative globally. However, the contention over Maoism's contributions still exists today, as some scholars maintain that Mao's theory was actually rooted in Marx's dynamic notion of [[dialectical materialism]], rather than the dogmatic application of Soviet stagiest theories of [[economic determinism]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

'''Martha Kneale''' (née ''Hurst''; 14 August 1909 – 2 December 2001) was a British [[philosopher]].

==Education and career==

Martha Hurst was born in Skipton, Yorkshire. She obtained her B.A. degree from [[Somerville College, Oxford]] in 1933. Martha was a tutor and Fellow in philosophy at [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford]] from 1936 to 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Grayling|editor1-first=A.C.|editor2-last=Goulder|editor2-first=Naomi|editor3-last=Pyle|editor3-first=Andrew|chapter=Kneale, Martha (1909–2001)|title=The Continuum Encyclopedia of British Philosophy|date=2006|publisher=Continuum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martha married [[William Kneale]] in 1938; they had two children, George (born 1942) and [[Jane Heal|Jane]] (married name Heal; born 1946). She was one of the first women fellows at Oxford University to maintain a fellowship after marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Brown, Stuart|author=Chavez-Arvizo, Enrique|chapter=Kneale, Martha|title=Dictionary of Twentieth-century British philosophers|date=2005|publisher=Thommes|page=516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kneale is best known for 1962 book that she co-wrote with her husband, William, ''The Development of Logic''. She wrote the chapters on ancient Greek logic. The "History" is commonly referred to in the academic world simply as "Kneale and Kneale". It was the only major history of logic available in English in the mid-twentieth century, and the first major history of logic in English since ''The Development of Symbolic Logic'' published in 1906 by A. T. Shearman. The treatise has been a standard work in the history of logic for decades.

She also worked on early modern philosophy particularly Leibniz and Spinoza and the metaphysical implications of their thought. She was also interested in [[parapsychology]], writing a number of papers on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Melton, J.|chapter=Martha Hurst Kneale|title=Encyclopedia of occultism &amp; parapsychology|date=1996|publisher=Gale|isbn=081035487X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1971–72.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Council|url=https://www.aristoteliansociety.org.uk/about/the-council/|website=Aristotelian Society|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Khan was born in Village Badharia, in district [[Azamgarh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]] in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jammu-kashmir.com/insights/maulana_wahiduddin_index.html Maulana Wahiduddin Khan]&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from a seminary of traditional Islamic learning. Like [[Javed Ahmad Ghamidi]], [[Israr Ahmed]] and [[ Naeem Siddiqui]], Khan also remained in close touch with [[Amin Ahsan Islahi]] and [[Syed Abul Ala Maududi]] (1903–1979) before opening an Islamic Center in [[Delhi]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[[Javed Ahmad Ghamidi#Interaction with other Islamic scholars]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}} 

He joined the [[Jamaat-e-Islami]] in 1949. He quit it fifteen years later, arguing that Maududi had overly politicized Islam. He set out his ideas in his book, ''Tabeer kee Ghalati'' (The Error in Interpretation).{{Citation needed|date= January 2018}}

==Publications==
The ''Ar-risala'' (The Message) [[Urdu language|Urdu]] magazine was started in 1976 consisting of almost entirely his articles and writing. An [[English language|English]] edition of the magazine was started in February 1984 and a [[Hindi language|Hindi]] version in December 1990. His articles include 'Hijacking&amp;nbsp;— A Crime',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jammu-kashmir.com/insights/insight20000215a.html Hijacking - A Crime&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 'Rights of Women in Islam',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jammu-kashmir.com/insights/insight20000215b.html Rights of Women in Islam&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 'The Concept of Charity in Islam'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jammu-kashmir.com/insights/insight20000330a.html The Concept of Charity in Islam&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and 'The Concept of Jihad'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jammu-kashmir.com/insights/insight20000223a.html The Concept of Jihad&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He has written a book on the issue of blasphemy from a dissenting perspective. It was banned in Punjab, the most populous province in [[Pakistan]], on 26 October 1998.{{Citation needed|date= January 2018}}

==Outlook==
Many traditional Islamic scholars find Khan's outlook and opinions distasteful. Some of them have even dubbed him a fitna (source of strife).{{Citation needed|date= January 2018}} His advice to Muslims has been to not treat unpleasant or unwanted situations as problems as this would only yield negative results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/15032002/1503200247.htm Analysis of the writings of Maulana Wahiduddin Khan - i, The Milli Gazette, Vol. 3 No. 6&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mind–body dualism''', or '''mind–body duality''', is a view in the [[philosophy of mind]] that [[mind|mental]] phenomena are, in some respects, [[non-physical entity|non-physical]],&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;Hart, W.D. (1996) "Dualism", in ''A Companion to the Philosophy of Mind'', ed. Samuel Guttenplan, Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 265-7.&lt;/ref&gt; or that the [[mind]] and [[Human body|body]] are distinct and separable.&lt;ref name="Crane2001p1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Crane |first1=Tim |last2=Patterson |first2=Sarah |year=2001 |title=History of the Mind-Body Problem |chapter=Introduction |pages=1–2 |quote=the assumption that mind and body are distinct (essentially, dualism)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it encompasses a set of views about the relationship between mind and matter, and between [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] and [[object (philosophy)|object]], and is contrasted with other positions, such as [[physicalism]] and [[enactivism]], in the [[mind–body problem]].&lt;ref name="Hart" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crane2001p1" /&gt;

[[Aristotle]] shared [[Plato]]'s view of multiple [[Soul (spirit)|souls]] and further elaborated a hierarchical arrangement, corresponding to the distinctive functions of plants, animals, and people: a nutritive soul of growth and metabolism that all three share; a perceptive soul of pain, pleasure, and desire that only people and other animals share; and the faculty of reason that is unique to people only. In this view, a soul is the [[hylomorphism|hylomorphic form]] of a viable organism, wherein each level of the hierarchy formally [[supervenience|supervenes]] upon the [[substance theory|substance]] of the preceding level. Thus, for Aristotle, all three souls perish when the living organism dies.&lt;ref name="Ari2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ari1"&gt;Aristotle (c. mid 4th century BC) ''Metaphysics (Metaphysica)'', ed. W.D. Ross, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1924, 2 vols; Books IV-VI, trans. C.A. Kirwan, Clarendon Aristotle Series, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1971; Books VII-VIII trans. D. Bostock, Clarendon Aristotle Series, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994; Books XIII-XIV trans. J. Annas, Clarendon Aristotle Series, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; For Plato however, the soul was not dependent on the physical body; he believed in [[metempsychosis]], the migration of the soul to a new physical body.&lt;ref name="Plat"&gt;Plato (390s-347 BC) ''Platonis Opera'', vol. 1, ''Euthyphro, Apologia Socratis, Crito, Phaedo, Cratylus, Theaetetus, Sophistes, Politicus'', ed. E.A. Duke, W.F. Hicken, W.S.M. Nicoll, D.B. Robinson and J.C.G. Strachan, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dualism is closely associated with the thought of [[René Descartes]] (1641), which holds that the mind is a nonphysical—and therefore, non-spatial—substance. Descartes clearly identified the mind with [[consciousness]] and self-awareness and distinguished this from the [[brain]] as the seat of [[intelligence]].&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;Robinson, Howard, "Dualism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2003 Edition), ed. Edward N. Zalta, http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2003/entries/dualism/.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, he was the first to formulate the mind–body problem in the form in which it exists today.&lt;ref name="De"&gt;Descartes, R. (1641) ''Meditations on First Philosophy'', in ''The Philosophical Writings of René Descartes'', trans. by J. Cottingham, R. Stoothoff and D. Murdoch, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984, vol. 2, pp. 1-62.&lt;/ref&gt; Dualism is contrasted with various kinds of [[monism]]. [[#Substance dualism|Substance dualism]] is contrasted with all forms of [[materialism]], but [[property dualism]] may be considered a form of [[emergent materialism]] or non-reductive physicalism in some sense.

==Types==
[[Ontology|Ontological]] dualism makes dual commitments about the nature of existence as it relates to mind and matter, and can be divided into three different types:

# ''Substance dualism'' asserts that mind and matter are fundamentally distinct kinds of foundations.&lt;ref name="Hart" /&gt;
# ''Property dualism'' suggests that the ontological distinction lies in the differences between properties of mind and matter (as in [[emergentism]]).&lt;ref name="Hart" /&gt;
# ''Predicate dualism'' claims the irreducibility of mental predicates to physical predicates.&lt;ref name="Hart" /&gt;

==={{anchor|Substance dualism|Cartesian dualism}}Substance or Cartesian dualism===
Substance dualism is a type of dualism most famously defended by [[René Descartes]], which states that there are two kinds of foundation: mental and body.&lt;ref name="SEP" /&gt; This philosophy states that the mental can exist outside of the body, and the body cannot think. Substance dualism is important historically for having given rise to much thought regarding the famous [[mind–body problem]]. Substance dualism is a philosophical position compatible with most [[theology|theologies]] which claim that immortal souls occupy an independent realm of existence distinct from that of the physical world.&lt;ref name="Hart" /&gt;

===Property dualism===
{{Main|Property dualism}}

Property dualism asserts that an ontological distinction lies in the differences between properties of mind and matter, and that consciousness is ontologically irreducible to [[neurobiology]] and physics. It asserts that when matter is organized in the appropriate way (i.e., in the way that living human bodies are organized), mental properties emerge. Hence, it is a sub-branch of [[emergent materialism]]. What views properly fall under the ''property dualism'' rubric is itself a matter of dispute. There are different versions of property dualism, some of which claim independent categorisation.&lt;ref name="ist-socrates.berkeley.edu"&gt;Searle, John (1983) "Why I Am Not a Property Dualist", {{cite web |url=http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~jsearle/132/PropertydualismFNL.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210160023/http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~jsearle/132/PropertydualismFNL.doc |archivedate=2006-12-10 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-reductive physicalism is a form of property dualism in which it is asserted that all mental states are causally reducible to physical states. One argument for this has been made in the form of [[anomalous monism]] expressed by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], where it is argued that mental events are identical to physical events, and there can be strict law-governed causal relationships. Another argument for this has been expressed by [[John Searle]], who is the advocate of a distinctive form of physicalism he calls [[biological naturalism]]. His view is that although mental states are ontologically irreducible to physical states, they are causally reducible (see [[causality]]). He has acknowledged that "to many people" his views and those of property dualists look a lot alike. But he thinks the comparison is misleading.&lt;ref name="ist-socrates.berkeley.edu"/&gt;

====Epiphenomenalism====
{{Main|Epiphenomenalism}}

[[Epiphenomenalism]] is a form of property dualism, in which it is asserted that one or more mental states do not have any influence on physical states (both ontologically and causally irreducible). It asserts that while material causes give rise to [[Sensation (psychology)|sensations]], [[Volition (psychology)|volitions]], [[idea]]s, etc., such mental phenomena themselves cause nothing further: they are causal dead-ends. This can be contrasted to [[Interactionism (philosophy of mind)|interactionism]], on the other hand, in which mental causes can produce material effects, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Rob"&gt;Robinson, H. (2003) "Dualism", in ''The Blackwell Guide to Philosophy of Mind'', ed. S. Stich and T. Warfield, Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 85-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predicate dualism===
Predicate dualism is a view espoused by [[nonreductive physicalism|nonreductive physicalists]] such as [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] and [[Jerry Fodor]], who maintain that while there is only one ontological category of substances and properties of substances (usually physical), the predicates that we use to describe mental events cannot be redescribed in terms of (or reduced to) physical predicates of natural languages.&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;Donald Davidson (1980) ''Essays on Actions and Events'', Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-924627-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, Jerry (1968) ''Psychological Explanation'', Random House. {{ISBN|0-07-021412-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If we characterize ''predicate monism'' as the view subscribed to by [[eliminative materialism|eliminative materialists]], who maintain that such intentional predicates as believe, desire, think, feel, etc., will eventually be eliminated from both the language of science and from ordinary language because the entities to which they refer do not exist, then ''predicate dualism'' is most easily defined as the negation of this position. Predicate dualists believe that so-called "folk psychology", with all of its [[propositional attitude]] ascriptions, is an ineliminable part of the enterprise of describing, explaining and understanding human mental states and behavior.

Davidson, for example, subscribes to [[Anomalous Monism]], according to which there can be no strict psycho-physical laws which connect mental and physical events under their descriptions as ''mental'' and ''physical'' events. However, all mental events also have physical descriptions. It is in terms of the latter that such events can be connected in law-like relations with other physical events. Mental predicates are irreducibly different in character (rational, holistic and necessary) from physical predicates (contingent, atomic and causal).&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;

==Dualist views of mental causation==
[[File:DualismCausationViews3.svg|400px|thumb|Four varieties of dualist causal interaction. The arrows indicate the direction of causations. Mental and physical states are shown in red and blue, respectively.]]

This part is about causation between properties and states of the thing under study, not its substances or predicates. Here a state is the set of all properties of what's being studied. Thus each state describes only one point in time.

===Interactionism===
{{Main|Interactionism (philosophy of mind)}}
Interactionism is the view that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, causally interact with physical states. This is a position which is very appealing to common-sense intuitions, notwithstanding the fact that it is very difficult to establish its validity or correctness by way of [[logic]]al argumentation or empirical proof. It seems to appeal to common-sense because we are surrounded by such everyday occurrences as a child's touching a hot stove (physical event) which causes him to feel pain (mental event) and then yell and scream (physical event) which causes his parents to experience a sensation of fear and protectiveness (mental event) and so on.&lt;ref name="SEP" /&gt;

===Non-reductive physicalism===
{{Main|Physicalism#Non-reductive_physicalism|l1=Non-reductive physicalism}}

[[Physicalism#Non-reductive physicalism|Non-reductive physicalism]] is the idea that while mental states are physical they are not reducible to physical properties, in that an ontological distinction lies in the differences between the properties of mind and matter. According to non-reductive physicalism all mental states are causally reducible to physical states where mental properties map to physical properties and vice versa. A prominent form of non-reductive physicalism called [[anomalous monism]] was first proposed by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] in his 1970 paper ''Mental events'', where it is claimed that [[mental event]]s are identical with physical events, and that the mental is anomalous, i.e. under their mental descriptions these mental events are not regulated by strict [[physical law]]s.

===Epiphenomenalism===
{{Main|Epiphenomenalism}}
[[Epiphenomenalism]] states that all mental events are caused by a physical event and have no physical consequences, and that one or more mental states do not have any influence on physical states. So, the mental event of deciding to pick up a rock ("''M1''") is caused by the firing of specific neurons in the brain ("''P1''"). When the arm and hand move to pick up the rock ("''P2''") this is not caused by the preceding mental event ''M1'', nor by ''M1'' and ''P1'' together, but only by ''P1''. The physical causes are in principle reducible to fundamental physics, and therefore mental causes are eliminated using this [[reductionist]] explanation. If P1 causes both ''M1'' and ''P2'', there is no [[overdetermination]] in the explanation for ''P2''.&lt;ref name="SEP" /&gt;

The idea that even if the animal were conscious nothing would be added to the production of behavior, even in animals of the human type, was first voiced by [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie|La Mettrie]] (1745), and then by [[Pierre Jean George Cabanis|Cabanis]] (1802), and was further explicated by [[Hodgson]] (1870) and [[T.H.

===Parallelism===
{{main|Parallelism (philosophy)}}
Psycho-physical parallelism is a very unusual view about the interaction between mental and physical events which was most prominently, and perhaps ''only'' truly, advocated by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz]]. Like Malebranche and others before him, Leibniz recognized the weaknesses of Descartes' account of causal interaction taking place in a physical location in the brain. Malebranche decided that such a material basis of interaction between material and immaterial was impossible and therefore formulated his doctrine of [[occasionalism]], stating that the interactions were really caused by the intervention of God on each individual occasion. Leibniz's idea is that God has created a [[pre-established harmony]] such that it only seems ''as if'' physical and mental events cause, and are caused by, one another. In reality, mental causes only have mental effects and physical causes only have physical effects. Hence the term ''parallelism'' is used to describe this view.&lt;ref name="Rob" /&gt;

===Occasionalism===
{{main|Occasionalism}}
Occasionalism is a philosophical doctrine about causation which says that created substances cannot be efficient causes of events. Instead, all events are taken to be caused directly by God himself. The theory states that the illusion of efficient causation between mundane events arises out of a constant conjunction that God had instituted, such that every instance where the cause is present will constitute an "occasion" for the effect to occur as an expression of the aforementioned power. This "occasioning" relation, however, falls short of efficient causation. In this view, it is not the case that the first event causes God to cause the second event: rather, God first caused one and then caused the other, but chose to regulate such behaviour in accordance with general laws of nature. Some of its most prominent historical exponents have been [[Louis de la Forge]], [[Arnold Geulincx]], and [[Nicholas Malebranche]].&lt;ref name="Malebranche"/&gt;

===Kantianism===
{{main|Kantianism}}
According to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s philosophy, there is a distinction between actions done by desire and the ones performed by liberty ([[categorical imperative]]). Thus, not all physical actions are caused by either matter or freedom. Some actions are purely animal in nature, while others are the result of mental action on matter.

==Historical overview==

===Plato and Aristotle===
In the dialogue ''[[Phaedo]]'', [[Plato]] formulated his famous [[Theory of forms|Theory of Forms]] as distinct and immaterial substances of which the objects and other phenomena that we perceive in the world are nothing more than mere shadows.&lt;ref name="Plat" /&gt;

Plato makes it clear, in the ''Phaedo'', that the Forms are the ''universalia ante res'', i.e. they are ideal universals, by which we are able to understand the world. In his [[allegory of the cave]] Plato likens the achievement of philosophical understanding to emerging into [[metaphor of the sun|the sun]] from a dark cave, where only vague shadows of what lies beyond that prison are cast dimly upon the wall. Plato's forms are non-physical and non-mental. They exist nowhere in time or space, but neither do they exist in the mind, nor in the [[pleroma]] of matter; rather, matter is said to "participate" in form (μεθεξις ''methexis''). It remained unclear however, even to Aristotle, exactly what Plato intended by that.

[[Aristotle]] argued at length against many aspects of Plato's forms, creating his own doctrine of [[hylomorphism]] wherein form and matter coexist. Ultimately however, Aristotle's aim was to perfect a theory of forms, rather than to reject it. Although Aristotle strongly rejected the independent existence Plato attributed to forms, his [[metaphysics]] do agree with Plato's ''a priori'' considerations quite often. For example, Aristotle argues that changeless, eternal substantial form is necessarily immaterial. Because matter provides a stable substratum for a change in form, matter always has the potential to change. Thus, if given an eternity in which to do so, it ''will'', necessarily, exercise that potential.

Part of Aristotle's ''psychology'', the study of the soul, is his account of the ability of humans to reason and the ability of animals to perceive. In both cases, perfect copies of forms are acquired, either by direct impression of environmental forms, in the case of perception, or else by virtue of contemplation, understanding and recollection. He believed the mind can literally assume any form being contemplated or experienced, and it was unique in its ability to become a blank slate, having no essential form. As thoughts of earth are not heavy, any more than thoughts of fire are causally efficient, they provide an immaterial complement for the formless mind.&lt;ref name="Ari2"&gt;Aristotle (c. mid 4th century BC) ''On the Soul (De anima)'', ed. R.D. Hicks, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1907; Books II-III trans. D.W. Hamlyn, Clarendon Aristotle Series, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

===From Neoplatonism to scholasticism===
In the philosophical school of [[Neoplatonism]], most active in Late Antiquity, claimed that the physical and the spiritual are both emanations of ''the One''. Neoplatonism exerted a considerable influence on [[Christianity]], as did the philosophy of Aristotle via [[scholasticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker (1901) ''The Neo-Platonists'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the scholastic tradition of [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]], a number of whose doctrines have been incorporated into Roman Catholic [[dogma]], the soul is the substantial form of a human being.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1075.htm#article2 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083516/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1075.htm |date=2012-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas held the ''Quaestiones disputate de anima'', or "Disputed questions on the soul", at the Roman ''studium provinciale'' of the [[Dominican Order]] at [[Santa Sabina]], the forerunner of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] during the academic year 1265-66.&lt;ref&gt;Torrell, op. cit., 162&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1268 Aquinas had written at least the first book of the ''Sententia Libri De anima'', Aquinas' commentary on Aristotle's ''De anima'', the translation of which from the Greek was completed by Aquinas' Dominican associate at [[Viterbo]] [[William of Moerbeke]] in 1267.&lt;ref&gt;Torrell, 161 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like Aristotle, Aquinas held that the human being was a unified composite substance of two substantial principles: form and matter. The soul is the substantial form and so the first actuality of a material organic body with the potentiality for life.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, de Anima II. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; While Aquinas defended the unity of human nature as a composite substance constituted by these two inextricable principles of form and matter, he also argued for the incorruptibility of the intellectual soul,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1075.htm#article6 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083516/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1075.htm |date=2012-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the corruptibility of the vegetative and sensitive animation of plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1075.htm#article3 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083516/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1075.htm |date=2012-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His argument for the subsistence and incorruptibility of the intellectual soul takes its point of departure from the metaphysical principle that operation follows upon being (''agiture sequitur esse''), i.e., the activity of a thing reveals the mode of being and existence it depends upon. Since the intellectual soul exercises its own ''per se'' intellectual operations without employing material faculties, i.e. intellectual operations are immaterial, the intellect itself and the intellectual soul, must likewise be immaterial and so incorruptible.  Even though the intellectual soul of man is able to subsist upon the death of the human being, Aquinas does not hold that the human person is able to remain integrated at death.  The separated intellectual soul is neither a man nor a human person. The intellectual soul ''by itself'' is ''not'' a human person (i.e., an individual ''supposit'' of a rational nature).&lt;ref&gt;Summa theologiae, I. 29.1; 75.4ad2; Disputed Questions on the Soul I.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, Aquinas held that "soul of St. Peter pray for us" would be more appropriate than "St. Peter pray for us", because all things connected with his person, including memories, ended with his corporeal life.&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas, Thomas (1266-71) ''Summa Theologica''. trans. Fathers of the English Dominican Province, 2d, rev. ed., 22 vols., London: Burns, Oates &amp; Washbourne, 1912-36; reprinted in 5 vols., Westminster, MD: Christian Classics, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic]] doctrine of the [[resurrection of the body]] does nor subscribe that, sees body and soul as forming a whole and states that at the [[second coming]], the souls of the departed will be reunited with their bodies as a whole person (substance) and witness to the [[apocalypse]]. The thorough consistency between dogma and contemporary science was maintained here&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Consistency with science, logic, philosophy, and faith remained a high priority for centuries, and a university doctorate in theology generally included the entire science curriculum as a prerequisite. This doctrine is not universally accepted by Christians today. Many believe that one's immortal soul goes directly to [[Heaven]] upon death of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Spong, John Selby (1994) ''Resurrection: Myth or Reality'', New York: HarperCollins Publishing. {{ISBN|0-06-067546-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descartes and his disciples===
In his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', [[René Descartes|Descartes]] embarked upon a quest in which he called all his previous beliefs into doubt, in order to find out of what he could be certain.&lt;ref name="De" /&gt; In so doing, he discovered that he could doubt whether he had a body (it could be that he was dreaming of it or that it was an illusion created by an evil demon), but he could not doubt whether he had a mind. This gave Descartes his first inkling that the mind and body were different things. The mind, according to Descartes, was a "thinking thing" ({{lang-la|[[res cogitans]]}}), and an immaterial [[Substance theory|substance]]. This "thing" was the essence of himself, that which doubts, believes, hopes, and thinks. The body, "the thing that exists" ({{lang-la|[[res extensa]]}}), regulates normal bodily functions (such as heart and liver). According to Descartes, animals only had a body and not a soul (which distinguishes humans from animals). The distinction between mind and body is argued in ''Meditation'' VI as follows: I have a clear and distinct idea of myself as a thinking, non-extended thing, and a clear and distinct idea of body as an extended and non-thinking thing. Whatever I can conceive clearly and distinctly, God can so create.

The central claim of what is often called ''Cartesian dualism'', in honor of Descartes, is that the immaterial mind and the material body, while being ontologically distinct substances, causally interact. This is an idea that continues to feature prominently in many non-European philosophies. Mental events cause physical events, and vice versa. But this leads to a substantial problem for Cartesian dualism: How can an immaterial mind cause anything in a material body, and vice versa? This has often been called the "problem of interactionism."

Descartes himself struggled to come up with a feasible answer to this problem. In his letter to [[Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Palatine]], he suggested that spirits interacted with the body through the [[pineal gland]], a small gland in the centre of the [[brain]], between the two [[Cerebral hemispheres|hemispheres]].&lt;ref name="De" /&gt; The term "Cartesian dualism" is also often associated with this more specific notion of causal interaction through the pineal gland. However, this explanation was not satisfactory: ''how'' can an immaterial mind interact with the physical pineal gland? Because Descartes' was such a difficult theory to defend, some of his disciples, such as [[Arnold Geulincx]] and [[Nicholas Malebranche]], proposed a different explanation: That all mind–body interactions required the direct intervention of [[God]]. According to these philosophers, the appropriate states of mind and body were only the ''occasions'' for such intervention, not real causes. These [[occasionalism|occasionalists]] maintained the strong thesis that all causation was directly dependent on God, instead of holding that all causation was natural except for that between mind and body.&lt;ref name="Malebranche"&gt;Schmaltz, Tad, "Nicolas Malebranche", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2002 Edition), ed. Edward N. Zalta, http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2002/entries/malebranche/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent formulations===
In addition to already discussed theories of dualism (particularly the Christian and Cartesian models) there are new theories in the defense of dualism. [[Naturalistic dualism]] comes from Australian philosopher, [[David Chalmers]] (born 1966) who argues there is an explanatory gap between objective and subjective experience that cannot be bridged by reductionism because consciousness is, at least, logically autonomous of the physical properties upon which it supervenes. According to Chalmers, a naturalistic account of property dualism requires a new fundamental category of properties described by new laws of [[supervenience]]; the challenge being analogous to that of understanding electricity based on the mechanistic and Newtonian models of materialism prior to [[Maxwell's equations]].

A similar defense comes from Australian philosopher [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] (born 1943) who revived the theory of [[epiphenomenalism]] which argues that mental states do not play a role in physical states. Jackson argues that there are two kinds of dualism. The first is ''substance dualism'' that assumes there is second, non-corporeal form of reality. In this form, body and soul are two different substances. The second form is ''property dualism'' that says that body and soul are different ''properties'' of the same body. He claims that functions of the mind/soul are internal, very private experiences that are not accessible to observation by others, and therefore not accessible by science (at least not yet). We can know everything, for example, about a bat's facility for echolocation, but we will never know how the bat experiences that phenomenon.

==Arguments for dualism==
[[File:Descartes-reflex.JPG|thumb|right|Another one of Descartes' illustrations. The fire displaces the skin, which pulls a tiny thread, which opens a pore in the ventricle (F) allowing the "animal spirit" to flow through a hollow tube, which inflates the muscle of the leg, causing the foot to withdraw.]]

===The subjective argument===
An important fact is that minds perceive intramental states differently from sensory phenomena,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prinz|first=Wolfgang|title=Why don't we perceive our brain states?|journal=European Journal of Cognitive Psychology|date=January 1992|volume=4|issue=1|doi=10.1080/09541449208406240 |pages=1–20}}&lt;!--|accessdate=19 November 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and this cognitive difference results in mental and physical phenomena having seemingly disparate properties. The subjective argument holds that these properties are irreconcilable under a physical mind.

Mental events have a certain ''subjective'' quality to them, whereas physical seem not to. So, for example, one may ask what a burned finger feels like, or what the blueness of the sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like.&lt;ref name="Nag"&gt;Nagel, Thomas (1986) ''The View From Nowhere'', New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers of mind call the subjective aspects of mental events ''[[qualia]].'' There is something ''that it's like'' to feel pain, to see a familiar shade of blue, and so on. There are ''qualia'' involved in these mental events. And the claim is that qualia cannot be reduced to anything physical.&lt;ref name="Hart" /&gt;

[[Thomas Nagel]] first characterized the problem of qualia for physicalistic monism in his article, "[[What Is It Like to Be a Bat?]]". Nagel argued that even if we knew everything there was to know from a third-person, scientific perspective about a bat's sonar system, we still wouldn't know what it is like to ''be'' a bat. However, others argue that ''qualia'' are consequent of the same neurological processes that engender the bat's mind, and will be fully understood as the [[neural correlates of consciousness|science]] develops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dennett|first=Daniel C.|title=Consciousness Explained|year=1991|publisher=Little, Brown and Co|isbn=0-316-18065-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] formulated his well-known ''knowledge argument'' based upon similar considerations. In this [[thought experiment]], known as [[Mary's room]], he asks us to consider a neuroscientist, Mary, who was born, and has lived all of her life, in a black and white room with a black and white television and computer monitor where she collects all the scientific data she possibly can on the nature of colours. Jackson asserts that as soon as Mary leaves the room, she will come to have new knowledge which she did not possess before: the knowledge of the experience of colours (i.e., what they are like). Although Mary knows everything there is to know about colours from an objective, third-person perspective, she has never known, according to Jackson, what it was like to see red, orange, or green. If Mary really learns something new, it must be knowledge of something non-physical, since she already knew everything about the physical aspects of colour.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Frank (1977) ''Perception: A Representative Theory'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Jackson]] later rejected his argument and embraced [[physicalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Hear|first=Anthony|title=Mind and Illusion, in "Minds and Persons"|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that Mary obtains knowledge not of color, but of a new intramental state, ''seeing color''.&lt;ref name="Jackson 2003 251"/&gt; Also, he notes that Mary might say "wow," and as a mental state affecting the physical, this clashed with his former view of [[epiphenomenalism]]. [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]]' response to this argument, now known as the ''ability'' argument, is that what Mary really came to know was simply the ability to recognize and identify color sensations to which she had previously not been exposed.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, David (1988) "What Experience Teaches", in ''Papers in Metaphysics and Epistemology'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999, pp. 262-290.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]] and others also provide arguments against this notion (see [[Mary's room#Objections|Objections]]).

===The zombie argument===
{{main|Philosophical zombie}}
The [[p-zombie|zombie argument]] is based on a [[thought experiment]] proposed by [[David Chalmers]]. The basic idea is that one can imagine, and, therefore, conceive the existence of, an apparently functioning human being/body without any conscious states being associated with it.

Chalmers' argument is that it seems plausible that such a being could exist because all that is needed is that all and only the things that the physical sciences describe and observe about a human being must be true of the zombie. None of the concepts involved in these sciences make reference to consciousness or other mental phenomena, and any physical entity can be described scientifically via [[physics]] whether it is conscious or not. The mere logical possibility of a p-zombie demonstrates that consciousness is a natural phenomenon beyond the current unsatisfactory explanations. Chalmers states that one probably could not build a living p-zombie because living things seem to require a level of consciousness. However (unconscious?) robots built to simulate humans may become the first real p-zombies. Hence Chalmers half-joking calls for the need to build a "consciousness meter" to ascertain if any given entity, human or robot, is conscious or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Chalmers, David |title=The Conscious Mind |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1997 |isbn=0-19-511789-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Chalmers, David |title=The Character of Consciousness|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2010 |isbn=0-19-531110-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others such as Dennett have [[Philosophical zombie#Criticism|argued]] that the notion of a philosophical zombie is an incoherent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dennett, Daniel |title=The unimagined preposterousness of zombies |year=1995 |journal=J Consciousness Studies|volume=2 |pages=322–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; or unlikely,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, Daniel |title=Consciousness Explained|publisher=Little, Brown and Co. |year=1991 |page=95 |isbn=0-316-18065-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; concept. In particular, nothing proves that an entity (e.g., a computer or robot) which would perfectly mimic human beings, and especially perfectly mimic expressions of feelings (like joy, fear, anger, ...), would not indeed experience them, thus having similar states of consciousness to what a real human would have. It is argued that under [[physicalism]], one must either believe that anyone including oneself might be a zombie, or that no one can be a zombie—following from the assertion that one's own conviction about being (or not being) a zombie is a product of the physical world and is therefore no different from anyone else's.

===Special sciences argument===
Robinson argues that, if predicate dualism is correct, then there are "special sciences" that are irreducible to physics. These allegedly irreducible subjects, which contain irreducible predicates, differ from hard sciences in that they are interest-relative. Here, interest-relative fields depend on the existence of minds that can have interested perspectives.&lt;ref name="Rob" /&gt; [[Psychology]] is one such science; it completely depends on and presupposes the existence of the mind.

Physics is the general analysis of [[nature]], conducted in order to understand how the [[universe]] behaves. On the other hand, the study of [[meteorology|meteorological]] weather patterns or [[Behavioral science|human behavior]] is only of interest to humans themselves. The point is that having a perspective on the world is a psychological state. Therefore, the special sciences presuppose the existence of minds which can have these states. If one is to avoid ontological dualism, then the mind that ''has'' a perspective must be part of the physical reality to which it ''applies'' its perspective. If this is the case, then in order to perceive the physical world as psychological, the mind must have a perspective on the physical. This, in turn, presupposes the existence of mind.&lt;ref name="Rob" /&gt;

However, [[cognitive science]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pylyshyn|first=Zenon W.|title=Computation and Cognition|year=1986|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262660587|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[psychology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwarz|first=Jeffrey M.|author2=Stapp, Henry P. |author3=Beauregard, Mario |title=Quantum Physics in Neuroscience and Psychology: A Neurophysical Model of Mind-Brain Interaction|journal=Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences|date=June 2005|volume=360|issue=1458|pages=1309–1327|jstor=30041344|doi=10.1098/rstb.2004.1598}}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 November 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; do not require the mind to be irreducible, and operate on the assumption that it has physical basis.

===Argument from personal identity===
This argument concerns the differences between the applicability of [[counterfactual conditionals]] to physical objects, on the one hand, and to conscious, personal agents on the other.&lt;ref name="MG"&gt;Madell, G. (1981) ''The Identity of the Self'', Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of any material object, e.g. a printer, we can formulate a series of counterfactuals in the following manner:

# This printer could have been made of straw.
# This printer could have been made of some other kind of plastics and vacuum-tube transistors.
# This printer could have been made of 95% of what it is actually made of and 5% vacuum-tube transistors, etc..

Somewhere along the way from the printer's being made up exactly of the parts and materials which actually constitute it to the printer's being made up of some different matter at, say, 20%, the question of whether this printer is the same printer becomes a matter of arbitrary convention.

Imagine the case of a person, Frederick, who has a counterpart born from the same egg and a slightly [[genetically modified sperm]]. Imagine a series of counterfactual cases corresponding to the examples applied to the printer. Somewhere along the way, one is no longer sure about the identity of Frederick. In this latter case, it has been claimed, ''overlap of constitution'' cannot be applied to the identity of mind. As Madell puts it:

:"But while my present body can thus have its partial counterpart in some possible world, my present consciousness cannot. Any present state of consciousness that I can imagine either is or is not mine. There is no question of degree here."&lt;ref name="MG" /&gt;

If the counterpart of Frederick, Frederickus, is 70% constituted of the same physical substance as Frederick, does this mean that it is also 70% mentally identical with Frederick? Does it make sense to say that something is mentally 70% Frederick?&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, S. and Swinburne, R. (1984) ''Personal Identity'', Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; A possible solution to this dilemma is that of [[open individualism]].

===Argument from reason===
{{main|Argument from reason}}

Philosophers and scientists such as [[Victor Reppert]], [[William Hasker]], and [[Alvin Plantinga]] have developed an argument for dualism dubbed the "argument from reason". They credit [[C.S. Lewis]] with first bringing the argument to light in his book ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles]]''; Lewis called the argument "The Cardinal Difficulty of Naturalism", which was the title of chapter three of ''Miracles''.&lt;ref name=Reppert&gt;Victor Reppert ''C.S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea''. Downers Grove, Illinois: InterVarsity Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8308-2732-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument postulates that if, as naturalism entails, all of our thoughts are the effect of a physical cause, then we have no reason for assuming that they are also the consequent of a reasonable ground. However, knowledge is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if naturalism were true, there would be no way of knowing it (or anything else), except by a fluke.&lt;ref name=Reppert /&gt;

Through this logic, the statement "I have reason to believe naturalism is valid" is inconsistent in the same manner as "I never tell the truth."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/darek_barefoot/dangerous.html A Response to Richard Carrier's Review of C.S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220020836/http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/darek_barefoot/dangerous.html |date=2008-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, to conclude its truth would eliminate the grounds from which to reach it. To summarize the argument in the book, Lewis quotes [[J. B. S. Haldane]], who appeals to a similar line of reasoning:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/Intro/csl3.html The Cardinal Difficulty Of Naturalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220015347/http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/Intro/csl3.html |date=2008-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=If my mental processes are determined wholly by the motions of atoms in my brain, I have no reason to suppose that my beliefs are true ... and hence I have no reason for supposing my brain to be composed of atoms.|sign=J. B. S. Haldane|source=Possible Worlds, ''page 209''}}

In his essay "Is Theology Poetry?", Lewis himself summarises the argument in a similar fashion when he writes:

{{Quote|text=If minds are wholly dependent on brains, and brains on biochemistry, and biochemistry (in the long run) on the meaningless flux of the atoms, I cannot understand how the thought of those minds should have any more significance than the sound of the wind in the trees.|sign=C. S. Lewis|source=[[The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses]], ''page 139''}}

But Lewis later agreed with [[Elizabeth Anscombe]]'s response to his ''Miracles'' argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sayer|first=George|title=Jack: A Life of C. S. Lewis|year=2005|publisher=Crossway|isbn=978-1581347395}}&lt;/ref&gt; She showed that an argument could be valid and ground-consequent even if its propositions were generated via [[causality (physics)|physical cause and effect]] by non-rational factors.&lt;ref&gt;''The Socratic Digest'', No. 4 (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to Anscombe, [[Richard Carrier]] and John Beversluis have written extensive objections to the [[argument from reason]] on the untenability of its first postulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beversluis|first=John|title=C.S. Lewis and the Search for Rational Religion (Revised and Updated)|year=2007|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1591025313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments against dualism==

===Causal interaction===
[[File:Dualism-vs-Monism.png|320px|thumb|right|Cartesian dualism compared to three forms of monism.]]
One argument against Dualism is with regard to causal interaction. If consciousness (the mind) can exist independently of physical reality (the brain), one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness. Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical reality. One of the main objections to dualistic interactionism is lack of explanation of how the material and immaterial are able to interact. Varieties of dualism according to which an immaterial mind causally affects the material body and vice versa have come under strenuous attack from different quarters, especially in the 20th century. Critics of dualism have often asked how something totally immaterial can affect something totally material—this is the basic ''problem of causal interaction''.

First, it is not clear ''where'' the interaction would take place. For example, burning one's finger causes pain. Apparently there is some chain of events, leading from the burning of skin, to the stimulation of nerve endings, to something happening in the peripheral nerves of one's body that lead to one's brain, to something happening in a particular part of one's brain, and finally resulting in the sensation of pain. But pain is not supposed to be spatially locatable. It might be responded that the pain "takes place in the brain." But evidently, the pain is in the finger. This may not be a devastating criticism.

However, there is a second problem about the interaction. Namely, the question of ''how'' the interaction takes place, where in dualism "the mind" is assumed to be non-physical and by definition outside of the realm of science. The ''mechanism'' which explains the connection between the mental and the physical would therefore be a philosophical proposition as compared to a scientific theory. For example, compare such a mechanism to a physical mechanism that ''is'' well understood. Take a very simple causal relation, such as when a cue ball strikes an eight ball and causes it to go into the pocket. What happens in this case is that the cue ball has a certain amount of momentum as its mass moves across the pool table with a certain velocity, and then that momentum is transferred to the eight ball, which then heads toward the pocket. Compare this to the situation in the brain, where one wants to say that a decision causes some neurons to fire and thus causes a body to move across the room. The intention to "cross the room now" is a mental event and, as such, it does not have physical properties such as force. If it has no force, then it would seem that it could not possibly cause any neuron to fire. However, with Dualism, an explanation is required of how something without any physical properties has physical ''effects''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=c. Problems of Interaction|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/dualism/#SH7c|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=15 November 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028131436/http://www.iep.utm.edu/dualism/#SH7c|archivedate=28 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Replies to the argument====
[[Alfred North Whitehead]] and, later, [[David Ray Griffin]] framed a new ontology ([[process philosophy]]) seeking precisely to avoid the pitfalls of ontological dualism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Weber]] and Anderson Weekes (eds.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279961/Process_Approaches_to_Consciousness_in_Psychology_Neuroscience_and_Philosophy_of_Mind Process Approaches to Consciousness in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Philosophy of Mind (Whitehead Psychology Nexus Studies II)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408022540/http://www.academia.edu/279961/Process_Approaches_to_Consciousness_in_Psychology_Neuroscience_and_Philosophy_of_Mind |date=2015-04-08 }}'', Albany, New York, State University of New York Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The explanation given by [[Arnold Geulincx]] and [[Nicholas Malebranche]] is that of [[occasionalism]], where all mind–body interactions require the direct intervention of God.

At the time [[C. S. Lewis]] wrote ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |author= Lewis, C.S
 |title= Miracles
 |year= 1947
 |isbn= 0-688-17369-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[quantum mechanics]] (and physical [[Quantum indeterminacy|indeterminism]]) was only in the initial stages of acceptance, but still Lewis stated the logical possibility that, if the physical world was proved to be indeterministic, this would provide an entry (interaction) point into the traditionally viewed closed system, where a scientifically described physically probable/improbable event could be philosophically described as an action of a non-physical entity on physical reality. He states, however, that none of the arguments in his book will rely on this. It should also be noted that, while some [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations]] of quantum mechanics consider [[wave function collapse]] to be indeterminate,&lt;ref name=SEPQD&gt;{{cite web|title=Causal Determinism of Quantum Mechanics|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/#QuaMec|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in others this event is defined and deterministic.&lt;ref name=SEPQD/&gt;

===Argument from physics===
The argument from physics is closely related to the argument from causal interaction. Many [[physicists]] and consciousness researchers have argued that any action of a nonphysical mind on the [[brain]] would entail the violation of physical laws, such as the [[conservation of energy]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, D. L. (1999). "Mind-brain interaction and the violation of physical laws." In B. Libet, A. Freeman, &amp; K. Sutherland (Eds.), ''The Volitional Brain'' (pp. 185–200). Thorverton, UK: Imprint Academic.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohrhoff, U. (1999). "The physics of interaction." In B. Libet, A. Freeman, &amp; K. Sutherland (Eds.), ''The Volitional Brain'' (pp. 165–184). Thorverton, UK: Imprint Academic.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jaswal | first1 = L | year = 2005 | title = Isolating disparate challenges to Hodgson's account of free will | url = | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 43–46 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clark | first1 = T. W. | year = 2005a | title = Hodgson's black box | url = | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 38–59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By assuming a deterministic physical universe, the objection can be formulated more precisely. When a person decides to walk across a room, it is generally understood that the decision to do so, a mental event, immediately causes a group of neurons in that person's brain to fire, a physical event, which ultimately results in his walking across the room. The problem is that if there is something totally nonphysical ''causing'' a bunch of neurons to fire, then there is no ''physical'' event which causes the firing. This means that some physical energy is required to be generated against the physical laws of the deterministic universe—this is by definition a miracle and there can be no scientific explanation of (repeatable experiment performed regarding) where the ''physical'' energy for the firing came from.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Gordon and Morris, Katherine J. (1996) ''Descartes' Dualism'', London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Such interactions would violate the fundamental [[physical law|laws of physics]]. In particular, if some external source of energy is responsible for the interactions, then this would violate the law of the [[conservation of energy]].&lt;ref&gt;Lycan, William (1996) "Philosophy of Mind" in ''The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy'', ed. Nicholas Bunnin and E. P. Tsui-James, Oxford: Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Dualistic interactionism has therefore been criticized for violating a general [[heuristic]] principle of science: the [[causal closure]] of the physical world.

====Replies to the argument from physics====
The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;ref name="SEP" /&gt; and the ''[[New Catholic Encyclopedia]]''&lt;ref name="CathEn"&gt;Maher, Michael (1909) "The Law of Conservation of Energy", ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', vol. 5, pp. 422 ff, {{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05422a.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701235022/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05422a.htm |archivedate=2007-07-01 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; give two possible replies to the above objections. The first reply is that the mind may influence the ''distribution'' of energy, without altering its quantity. The second possibility is to deny that the human body is causally closed, as the [[conservation of energy]] applies only to closed systems. However, physicalists object that no evidence exists for the causal non-closure of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Nancy|title=Downward Causation and the Neurobiology of Free Will|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3642032042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robin Collins responds&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Robin "Modern Physics and the Energy Conservation Objection to Mind-Body Dualism" ''The American Philosophical Quarterly'', Volume 45, Number 1, January 2008, pp. 31-42&lt;/ref&gt; that energy conservation objections misunderstand the role of energy conservation in physics. Well understood scenarios in general relativity violate energy conservation and quantum mechanics provides precedent for causal interactions, or correlation without energy or momentum exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newdualism.org/papers/R.Collins/EC-PEC.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625152408/http://www.newdualism.org/papers/R.Collins/EC-PEC.htm |archivedate=2017-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not mean the mind spends energy and, despite that, it still not exclude the supernatural.

Another reply is akin to parallelism—Mills holds that behavioral events are causally [[overdetermination|overdetermined]], and can be explained by either physical or mental causes alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mills|first=E.|title=Interactionism and Overdetermination|journal=American Philosophical Quarterly|year=1996|volume=33|pages=105–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; An overdetermined event is fully accounted for by multiple causes at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Althusser|first=Louis|title="Contradiction and Overdetermination," in For Marx|year=1985|isbn=0-902308-79-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[J. J. C. Smart]] and [[Paul Churchland]] have pointed out that if physical phenomena fully determine behavioral events, then by [[Occam's razor]] an unphysical mind is unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Churchland|first=Paul|title=Matter and Consciousness, Revised Edition|year=1984|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262530743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson suggests that the interaction may involve [[dark energy]], [[dark matter]] or some other currently unknown scientific process.&lt;ref name="Rob"/&gt; However, such processes would necessarily be physical, and in this case dualism is replaced with physicalism, or the interaction point is left for study at a later time when these physical processes are understood.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Another reply is that the interaction taking place in the human body may not be described by "billiard ball" [[classical mechanics]]. If a nondeterministic interpretation of [[quantum mechanics]] is correct then microscopic events are [[indeterminism|indeterminate]], where the degree of [[determinism]] increases with the scale of the system (see [[Quantum decoherence]]). Philosophers [[Karl Popper]] and [[John Carew Eccles|John Eccles]] and physicist [[Henry Stapp]] have theorized that such indeterminacy may apply at the macroscopic scale.&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Karl R. and Eccles, John C. (1977) ''The Self and Its Brain'', Berlin: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Max Tegmark]] has argued that classical and quantum calculations show that [[quantum decoherence]] effects do not play a role in brain activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tegmark|first=Max|title=Importance of quantum decoherence in brain processes|journal=Phys. Rev. E|date=April 2000|volume=61|issue=4|pages=4194–4206|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.61.4194|url=http://pre.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v61/i4/p4194_1|accessdate=18 November 2012|arxiv=quant-ph/9907009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130223204431/http://pre.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v61/i4/p4194_1|archivedate=23 February 2013|df=|bibcode=2000PhRvE..61.4194T}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, macroscopic quantum states have only ever been observed in superconductors [[Macroscopic quantum state|near absolute zero]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Yet another reply to the interaction problem is to note that it doesn't seem that there is an interaction problem for all forms of substance dualism. For instance, Thomistic dualism (the dualism of Thomas Aquinas) doesn't obviously face any issue with regards to interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2016/09/mind-body-interaction-whats-problem.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-04-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425032034/http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2016/09/mind-body-interaction-whats-problem.html |archivedate=2017-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Breuer in 1994 had proven&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://homepages.fhv.at/tb/cms/?download=tbDISS.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426203604/https://homepages.fhv.at/tb/cms/?download=tbDISS.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-26 |df= }} Thomas Breuer. Classical observables, measurement and quantum mechanics&lt;/ref&gt; that physical theories valid for the whole universe are impossible. Any theory will be wrong when applied to a system which contains the observer himself due to self-reference.{{Dubious|date=December 2013}} This proves that the observer's own body does not follow the same physical laws as the rest of the universe. But other people from the observer's point of view will obey the usual physical laws, so conducting experiments on them would not indicate any divergence from the physical predictions.

===Argument from brain damage===
This argument has been formulated by [[Paul Churchland]], among others. The point is that, in instances of some sort of [[brain damage]] (e.g. caused by automobile accidents, drug abuse, pathological diseases, etc.), it is always the case that the mental substance and/or properties of the person are significantly changed or compromised. If the mind were a completely separate substance from the brain, how could it be possible that every single time the brain is injured, the mind is also injured? Indeed, it is very frequently the case that one can even predict and explain the kind of mental or psychological deterioration or change that human beings will undergo when specific parts of their brains are damaged. So the question for the dualist to try to confront is how can all of this be explained if the mind is a separate and immaterial substance from, or if its properties are ontologically independent of, the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Churchland, Paul (1988) ''Matter and Consciousness'', Revised Edition, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Property dualism]] and [[William Hasker]]'s "emergent dualism"&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties-emergent/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "Emergent Properties"]. Excerpt: "William Hasker (1999) goes one step further in arguing for the existence of the mind conceived as a non-composite substance which ‘emerges’ from the brain at a certain point in its development. He dubs his position ‘emergent dualism,’ and claims for it all the philosophical advantages of traditional, Cartesian substance dualism while being able to overcome a central difficulty, viz., explaining how individual brains and mental substances come to be linked in a persistent, ‘monogamous’ relationship. Here, Hasker, is using the term to express a view structurally like one (vitalism) that the British emergentists were anxious to disavow, thus proving that the term is capable of evoking all manner of ideas for metaphysicians."&lt;/ref&gt; seek to avoid this problem. They assert that the mind is a property or substance that emerges from the appropriate arrangement of physical matter, and therefore could be affected by any rearrangement of matter.

[[Phineas Gage]], who suffered destruction of one or both frontal lobes by a projectile iron rod, is often cited as an example illustrating that the brain causes mind. Gage certainly exhibited some mental changes after his accident. This physical event, the destruction of part of his brain, therefore caused some kind of change in his mind, suggesting a correlation between brain states and mental states. Similar examples abound; neuroscientist [[David Eagleman]] describes the case of another individual who exhibited escalating [[pedophile|pedophilic]] tendencies at two different times, and in each case was found to have tumors growing in a particular part of his brain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2943-brain-tumour-causes-uncontrollable-paedophilia.htmlNewScientist.com, "Brain tumour causes uncontrollable paedophilia"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412195711/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2943-brain-tumour-causes-uncontrollable-paedophilia.htmlNewScientist.com, |date=2015-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophybites.com/2011/05/david-eagleman-on-morality-and-the-brain.htmlDavid Eagleman, Philosophy Bites Podcast, "David Eagleman on Morality and the Brain"]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Case studies aside, modern experiments have demonstrated that the relation between brain and mind is much more than simple correlation. By damaging, or manipulating, specific areas of the brain repeatedly under controlled conditions (e.g. in monkeys) and reliably obtaining the same results in measures of mental state and abilities, neuroscientists have shown that the relation between damage to the brain and mental deterioration is likely causal. This conclusion is further supported by data from the effects of neuro-active chemicals (such as those affecting [[neurotransmitters]]) on mental functions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11190987 | volume=25 | issue=1 | title=Verbal and visual memory improve after choline supplementation in long-term total parenteral nutrition: a pilot study | year=2001 | journal=JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr | pages=30–5 |vauthors=Buchman AL, Sohel M, Brown M |doi=10.1177/014860710102500130|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also from research on [[neurostimulation]] (direct electrical stimulation of the brain, including [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Alterations of sociomoral judgement and glucose utilization in the frontomedial cortex induced by electrical stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in Parkinsonian patients (2004):'' {{cite web |url=http://www.egms.de/de/meetings/dgnc2004/04dgnc0207.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040903084719/http://www.egms.de/de/meetings/dgnc2004/04dgnc0207.shtml |archivedate=2004-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argument from biological development===
Another common argument against dualism consists in the idea that since human beings (both [[phylogenesis|phylogenetically]] and [[ontogenesis|ontogenetically]]) begin their existence as entirely physical or material entities and since nothing outside of the domain of the physical is added later on in the course of development, then we must necessarily end up being fully developed material beings. There is nothing non-material or ''mentalistic'' involved in conception, the formation of the [[blastula]], the [[gastrula]], and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnold|first=Sebastian J.|author2=Robertson, Elizabeth J.|title=Making a commitment: cell lineage allocation and axis patterning in the early mouse embryo|journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|date=February 2009|volume=10|doi=10.1038/nrm2618|url=http://www.nature.com/nrm/journal/v10/n2/full/nrm2618.html|accessdate=16 November 2012|issue=2|pages=91–103|pmid=19129791|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901143043/http://www.nature.com/nrm/journal/v10/n2/full/nrm2618.html|archivedate=1 September 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The postulation of a non-physical mind would seem superfluous.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Argument from simplicity===
The argument from simplicity is probably the simplest and also the most common form of argument against dualism of the mental. The dualist is always faced with the question of why anyone should find it necessary to believe in the existence of two, ontologically distinct, entities (mind and brain), when it seems possible and would make for a simpler thesis to test against scientific evidence, to explain the same events and properties in terms of one. It is a heuristic principle in science and philosophy not to assume the existence of more entities than is necessary for clear explanation and prediction (see [[Occam's razor]]).

This argument was criticized by [[Peter Glassen]] in a debate with [[J. J. C. Smart]] in the pages of ''[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]'' in the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glassen | first1 = Peter | year = 1976 | title = J. J. C.

The idea is that Occam's razor may not be as "unrestricted" as it is normally described (applying to all qualitative postulates, even abstract ones) but instead concrete (only applies to physical objects). If one applies Occam's Razor unrestrictedly, then it recommends monism until pluralism either receives more support or is disproved. If one applies Occam's Razor only concretely, then it may not be used on abstract concepts (this route, however, has serious consequences for selecting between hypotheses ''about'' the abstract).&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/ Plato Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Simplicity]. Excerpt: "Perhaps scientists apply an unrestricted version of Occam's Razor to that portion of reality in which they are interested, namely the concrete, causal, spatiotemporal world. Or perhaps scientists apply a 'concretized' version of Occam's Razor unrestrictedly. Which is the case? The answer determines which general philosophical principle we end up with: ought we to avoid the multiplication of objects of whatever kind, or merely the multiplication of concrete objects? The distinction here is crucial for a number of central philosophical debates. Unrestricted Occam's Razor favors monism over dualism, and nominalism over platonism. By contrast, 'concretized' Occam's Razor has no bearing on these debates, since the extra entities in each case are not concrete".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===

A native of [[Bucharest]], he was descended from an aristocratic [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] family.&lt;ref name="Nicolai"&gt;{{ro icon}} Bogdan Nicolai, [http://www.presa-zilei.ro/stire/614/familia-djuvara.html "«Regret ca numele Djuvara va disparea odata cu mine»" ("«I Regret that the Name of Djuvara Will Be Extinguished with Me»")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927091825/http://www.presa-zilei.ro/stire/614/familia-djuvara.html |date=September 27, 2007 }}, interview with Neagu Djuvara, in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', January 22, 2006 (hosted by www.presa-zilei.ro), retrieved June 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roman"&gt;{{ro icon}} Toma Roman Jr, [http://www.plai-cu-boi.ro/protect/11/djuvara.html "«Politiceşte, Ion Antonescu habar n-avea ce face»" ("«Politically, Ion Antonescu Had No Idea of What He Was Doing»")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050214182150/http://www.plai-cu-boi.ro/protect/11/djuvara.html |date=February 14, 2005 }}, interview with Neagu Djuvara, in ''Plai cu Boi'', No. 11, retrieved June 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Marcel, a graduate of the [[Technical University of Berlin]] and a captain in the [[Romanian Royal Army]]'s Engineer Corps, died of [[Spanish flu]] in 1918;&lt;ref name="Nicolai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roman"/&gt; his mother, Tinca, was the last descendant of the [[Gradişteanu family]] of [[boyar]] origins (according to Djuvara, she was related to all boyar families in [[Wallachia]]).&lt;ref name="Nicolai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roman"/&gt; Djuvara's uncles [[Trandafir G. Djuvara|Trandafir]] and [[Alexandru Djuvara]] were notable public figures.&lt;ref name="Nicolai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roman"/&gt; Djuvara was born during [[World War I]]; as an infant, he was taken by his family into refuge in [[Iași]] after the [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)|occupation of southern Romania]] by the [[Central Powers]], and then, through [[Imperial Russia]], into Belgium (where Trandafir Djuvara was [[Minister Plenipotentiary]]).&lt;ref name="Roman" /&gt;

He attended ''[[Secondary education in France|lycée]]'' in [[Nice]], France, and graduated in Letters (1937) and Law (1940) from the [[University of Paris]] (his Law thesis dealt with the [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] legislation passed by the governments of [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] in Romania).&lt;ref name="Roman"/&gt; Djuvara later stated that, at the time, his political sympathies veered towards the far right: he became a supporter of the Romanian fascist movement, the [[Iron Guard]], and took part in the [[6 February 1934 crisis|February 1934 riot]] against the French [[Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party|Radical-Socialist]] government of [[Édouard Daladier]].&lt;ref name="Roman"/&gt;

During [[World War II]], he returned to Romania, where he married and fathered a daughter.&lt;ref name="Roman"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/romanian-historian-neagu-djuvara-dead-101-52627310|title=Romanian historian Neagu Djuvara dead at 101|last=|first=|date=2018-01-26|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-01-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126143730/http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/romanian-historian-neagu-djuvara-dead-101-52627310|archive-date=2018-01-26|dead-url=yes|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Romanian Armed Forces]] and was stationed in [[Ploiești]] under the Iron Guard's [[National Legionary State|National Legionary government]].&lt;ref name="Roman"/&gt;

Following the establishment of [[Ion Antonescu]]'s dictatorship and the start of [[Operation Barbarossa]] (''see [[Romania during World War II]]''), as an [[officer cadet]], he fought on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], saw action in [[Bassarabia]] and [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]], before being wounded in the arm during the [[Battle of Odessa (1941)|Battle of Odessa]] (1941).&lt;ref name="Nicolai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Giju"&gt;{{ro icon}} Dan Giju, [http://www.presamil.ro/OM/2004/18/pag%2018.htm "Neagu Djuvara – Curierul de Stockholm" ("Neagu Djuvara -the Stockholm Courier")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927173557/http://www.presamil.ro/OM/2004/18/pag%2018.htm |date=September 27, 2007 }}, interview with Djuvara at the Romanian Defense Ministry site, retrieved June 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that he gave up his interest in the far right after a 1943 dialog with fellow diplomat [[Victor Rădulescu-Pogoneanu]], who convinced Djuvara to become "a supporter of [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]]".&lt;ref name="Roman"/&gt;

===Diplomat===

Subsequently, Djuvara decided to apply for office in the [[diplomatic corps]], won the competition, and was sent by [[List of Romanian Foreign Ministers|Foreign Minister]] [[Mihai Antonescu]] as a [[diplomatic courier]] to Sweden, on the very day Ion Antonescu was toppled by a coup d'état and Romania pulled out of the [[Axis Powers]] to join the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] (August 23, 1944).&lt;ref name="Nicolai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deletant"&gt;[[Dennis Deletant]], ''Communist Terror in Romania: Gheorghiu-Dej and the Police State, 1948–1965'', C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers, London, 1999 {{ISBN|1-85065-386-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this capacity, he was instructed to communicate to the Romanian Ambassador in [[Stockholm]], [[Frederic Nanu]], that he was to ask the Soviet representative [[Alexandra Kollontai]] whether earlier terms advanced by [[Joseph Stalin]] in regard to peace with Romania were still valid (Nanu was also told not to inform the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] of these talks).&lt;ref name="Deletant"/&gt;

Speaking in retrospect, he argued against claims made by Nanu, according to which Ion Antonescu had thus indicated his willingness to step down and hand leadership of Romania to [[King of Romania|King]] [[Michael I of Romania|Mihai I]].&lt;ref name="Deletant"/&gt; According to Djuvara, the last Soviet offer for Antonescu made only minor concessions – the entire country was to be occupied by the [[Red Army]], with the exception of a random western [[Counties of Romania|county]] (to function as a provisional administrative center), and 15 days were given to the Romanian government to reach an [[armistice]] with [[Nazi Germany]]&lt;ref name="Roman"/&gt; (Djuvara considered this latter expectation particularly unrealistic, as it involved Germany consciously abandoning Romanian territory to its enemy).&lt;ref name="Roman"/&gt; Furthermore, Djuvara indicated, "Neither I nor Nanu were mandated to sign any document, to launch into any peace process".&lt;ref name="Roman"/&gt;

Appointed [[Legation]] Secretary in Stockholm by the [[Constantin Sănătescu]] executive, Djuvara was dismissed by the new [[Romanian Communist Party]] officials upon [[Ana Pauker]]'s appointment as Foreign Minister (1947).&lt;ref name="Roman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Giju"/&gt;

===Exile===

Having been implicated ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' in the series of [[show trial]]s inaugurated in the wake of [[Communist Romania]] by the [[Tămădău Affair]], accused of being a spy,&lt;ref name="Roman"/&gt; he decided to remain abroad.&lt;ref name="Nicolai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roman"/&gt; He left for Paris and was subsequently involved in advocacy of [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] political causes and the rallying of exiled intellectuals.&lt;ref name="Roman"/&gt; Briefly employed by the [[International Refugee Organization]], Djuvara became involved with the body of Romanian exiles, the [[Romanian National Committee]], and helped organize American-assisted drops of voluntary [[paratrooper]]s in support of the [[Romanian anti-communist resistance movement|Romanian anti-communist resistance]] (most of whom were captured by the [[Securitate]]).&lt;ref name="Roman"/&gt; He renounced his position by 1951,&lt;ref name="Roman"/&gt; and subsequently worked for the exile magazine ''Casa Românească''.&lt;ref name="Nicolai" /&gt;

In 1961, he settled in [[Niger]], serving as an adviser for the country's [[Foreign relations of Niger|Foreign Ministry]] (extending a two-year contract until 1984),&lt;ref name="Nicolai"/&gt; and was a professor of [[International Law]] and [[Economic History]] at the [[Abdou Moumouni University of Niamey|University of Niamey]]. Djuvara was an acquaintance of [[Heads of state of Niger|President]] [[Hamani Diori]], and notably accompanied him on official duty to [[Addis Ababa]], attending the opening session of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (1963).&lt;ref name="Nicolai"/&gt; Having already begun to further his studies of Philosophy in Paris, he received a [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] ''[[Habilitation|doctorat d'État]]'' in the [[Philosophy of history]] (with the thesis ''Civilisations et lois historiques'', guided by [[Raymond Aron]]).&lt;ref name="Giju"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Longre"/&gt; He was later awarded a diploma in Philology from [[Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales|INALCO]].

After 1984, he returned to Europe, resuming his activities with ''Casa Românească'' and other Romanian cultural institutions in exile.&lt;ref name="Nicolai"/&gt; Djuvara was an active contributor to [[Radio Free Europe]],&lt;ref name="Longre"&gt;{{fr icon}} Jean-Pierre Longre, [http://www.sitartmag.com/bucarestparisniamey.htm "Les tribulations d’un Roumain dans le monde" ("The Tribulations of a Romanian throughout the World")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630201556/http://www.sitartmag.com/bucarestparisniamey.htm |date=June 30, 2007 }}, at ''Sitartmag'', retrieved June 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and divided his time between Paris and [[Munich]] (occasionally traveling to Canada and the United States).&lt;ref name="Longre"/&gt;

===Post-1989===

Djuvara returned to his native country soon after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]]. Between 1991 and 1998, he was an [[associate professor]] at the [[University of Bucharest]]. During the early 1990s, he was a noted critic of Romanian political developments, and especially of the [[Mineriad]] and the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] government.&lt;ref name="Nicolai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Longre"/&gt;

He later joined the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]],&lt;ref name="Şimonca"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ovidiu Şimonca, [http://atelier.liternet.ro/arhiva/3993/Ovidiu-Simonca/Neagu-Djuvara-Sint-foarte-ingrijorat-de-viitorul-Europei-unite-.html "Neagu Djuvara: Sînt foarte îngrijorat de viitorul Europei unite" ("Neagu Djuvara: I Am Very Worried over the Future of United Europe")], interview with Neagu Djuvara at LiterNet, retrieved June 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and expressed his concern that [[President of Romania|President]] [[Traian Băsescu]] was unable to complete planned reforms in the wake of [[Accession of Romania to the European Union|Romania's accession]] to the [[European Union]], as well as his belief that the former [[Securitate]] was still in a position of power.&lt;ref name="Şimonca"/&gt; He also took a conservative stance on European affairs, being a vocal critic of Europe's [[multiculturalism]].&lt;ref name="Şimonca"/&gt; In August 2016, Djuvara [[Centenarian|turned 100]], and upon the occasion was made a knight of the [[Order of the Star of Romania]].&lt;ref name="Steaua"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.gandul.info/stiri/istoricul-neagu-djuvara-si-filosoful-mihai-sora-decorati-de-iohannis-cu-ordinul-steaua-romaniei-15557512' "Istoricul Neagu Djuvara şi filosoful Mihai Şora, decoraţi de Iohannis cu Ordinul 'Steaua României'"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, in ''Gândul'', retrieved August 18, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; He died from pneumonia in [[Bucharest]] on 25 January 2018, at the age of 101 years and 160 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.digi24.ro/stiri/actualitate/a-murit-neagu-djuvara-866628|title=A murit Neagu Djuvara.

&lt;!-- Most of his works in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] were published by [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]]. citation needed --&gt;

==Work as a historian==

Most of Djuvara's work concerns the [[history of Romania]] and that of the [[Romanians|Romanian people]], although he published significant works pertaining to the [[philosophy of history]], particularly questioning the existence of what he called "truthful history".&lt;ref name="TruthfulHistory"&gt;''Există istorie adevarată?'' ("Is There a Truthful History?"), Humanitas, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding Romanian history, Djuvara advocated continued and extensive research into what he believed was still unexplored territory. His views were often seen as undermining a Romanian national identity, mainly because of his expressing doubts on the scientific accuracy of most historic research done in Romania since the unification of 1918, and putting forward controversial hypotheses concerning the [[origin of the Romanians]], such as advancing the theory that the vast majority of the nobility in the medieval states that made up the territory of modern-day Romania was of [[Cumans|Cuman]] origin.&lt;ref name="BlackCumans"&gt;{{ro icon}} Eugen Istodor, [http://www.cotidianul.ro/index.php?id=11653&amp;art=30762&amp;cHash=1ad1d04d47' "Revolutia lui Djuvara: „Romanii erau numiti cumanii negri“ "], interview with Neagu Djuvara in ''Cotidianul'', retrieved June 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RTV"&gt;{{ro icon}} Robert Turcescu, [http://www.realitatea.net/playlive2.php?emisiuni&amp;file=20070618_2200_47.flv&amp;titlulive=100% "Neagu Djuvara invited at 100% talk-show with Robert Turcescu on Realitatea TV"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203150/http://www.realitatea.net/playlive2.php?emisiuni&amp;file=20070618_2200_47.flv&amp;titlulive=100% |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also published extensively regarding the relationship between his native Romania and Europe, placing the country politically and culturally "between East and West",&lt;ref name="EastAndWest1"&gt;''Les pays roumains entre Orient et Occident. Les Principautés danubiennes au début du XIXe siecle'' ("The Romanian Lands between Orient and Occident. The [[Danubian Principalities]] at the Beginning of the 19th Century"), Publications Orientalistes de France, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EastAndWest2"&gt;''Între Orient şi Occident. Ţările române la începutul epocii moderne'' ("Between East and West. The Romanian Lands at the Beginning of the Modern Era"), Humanitas, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PoporulRoman"&gt;''Cum s-a născut poporul român?'' ("How Was the Romanian People Born?"), Humanitas, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; citing it as the "last to enter what is commonly called the ''European concert''",&lt;ref name="RTV" /&gt; referring not to Romania's 2007 accession to the [[European Union]], but to the country's change of orientation towards adopting a Western political and cultural model. He has voiced his concern regarding [[multiculturalism]] in Europe, a policy which he views as detrimental to stability within the EU.&lt;ref name="Şimonca" /&gt;

He was a critic of what he perceived to be an excessively pro-Western attitude in [[Politics of Romania|Romanian politics]], suggesting that Romanian society and [[Culture of Romania|culture]] could not be classified as Western, citing [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity|Orthodoxy]] as the predominant religion, the presence of many non-Latin elements in the modern [[Romanian language]] and the country's history in the past centuries as arguments.&lt;ref name="RTV" /&gt;

He also wrote about what he called the "American [[hegemony]]" and its premises, analysing the influence which the United States and its foreign policy have had on the world and, more specifically, on Europe. He characterised the efforts of the United States to establish what resembles a hegemony in Europe and other parts of the world as a "Seventy-Seven Years' War" waged throughout most of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Hegemony"&gt;''Războiul de şaptezeci şi şapte de ani (1914–1991) şi premisele hegemoniei americane'' ("The Seventy-Seven Years' War (1914–1991) and the Premises of the American Hegemony", ''Humanitas'', 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Djuvara can be seen as a populariser and "de-mystifier" of history, having published books aimed a younger audience as well as books seeking to explain the historical basis for mythical figures such as [[Dracula]] or [[Radu Negru|Negru Vodă]]. He also published memories from his exile, recounting his life and work in Paris, France and [[Niamey]], Niger.&lt;ref name="BucharestParisNiamey"&gt;''Bucarest-Paris-Niamey et retour ou Souvenirs de 42 ans d'exil (1948–1990)'' ("[[Bucharest]]-Paris-[[Niamey]] and Back or Recollections from 42 Years of Exile (1948–1990)"), [[L'Harmattan]], 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4032">'''Nomothetic''' and '''idiographic''' are terms used by [[Neo-Kantian]] philosopher [[Wilhelm Windelband]] to describe two distinct approaches to knowledge, each one corresponding to a different intellectual tendency, and each one corresponding to a different branch of academe.
* ''[[Nomothetic]]'' is based on what Kant described as a tendency to generalize, and is typical for the [[natural sciences]].  It describes the effort to derive laws that explain ''[[type (metaphysics)|types]]'' or ''categories'' of [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] phenomena, in general.
* ''Idiographic'' is based on what Kant described as a tendency to specify, and is typical for the [[humanities]]. It describes the effort to understand the meaning of contingent, unique, and often [[culture|cultural]] or [[Subjectivity|subjective]] [[phenomena]].

==Use in the social sciences==
The problem of whether to use nomothetic or idiographic approaches is most sharply felt in the social sciences, whose subject are unique individuals (idiographic perspective), but who have certain general properties or behave according to general rules (nomothetic perspective).

Often, nomothetic approaches are quantitative, and idiographic approaches are qualitative, although the "Personal Questionnaire" developed by M.B. Shapiro, and its further developments (e.g. [[Discan]] scale) are both quantitative and idiographic.  Personal cognition (D.A. Booth) is idiographic, qualitative and quantitative, using the individual's own narrative of action within situation to scale the ongoing biosocial cognitive processes in units of discrimination from norm (with M.T. Conner 1986, R.P.J. Freeman 1993 and O. Sharpe 2005).

In [[psychology]], ''idiographic'' describes the study of the individual, who is seen as a unique agent with a unique life history, with properties setting him/her apart from other individuals (see [[idiographic image]]). A common method to study these unique characteristics is an (auto)biography, i.e. a [[narrative]] that recounts the unique sequence of events that made the person who she is.  ''Nomothetic'' describes the study of classes or cohorts of individuals. Here the subject is seen as an exemplar of a population and their corresponding [[personality trait]]s and [[Behavior|behaviours]]. The terms idiographic and nomothetic were introduced to American psychology by [[Gordon Allport]] in 1937. 

[[Theodore Millon]] (1995) states that when spotting and diagnosing [[personality disorders]], first we start with the nomothetic perspective and look for various general scientific laws; then when you believe you have a disorder, you switch your view to the idiographic perspective to focus on the specific individual and his or her unique traits.

In [[sociology]], the nomothetic model tries to find independent variables that account for the variations in a given phenomenon (e.g. What is the relationship between timing/frequency of childbirth and education?). Nomothetic explanations are probabilistic and usually incomplete. The idiographic model focuses on a complete, in-depth understanding of a single case (e.g. Why do I not have any children?).

In [[anthropology]], idiographic describes the study of a group, seen as an entity, with specific properties that set it apart from other groups. Nomothetic refers to the use of generalization rather than specific properties in the same context.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22079">'''Organizational technoethics''' ('''OT''') is a branch stemming from [[technoethics]]. Advances in technology and their ability to transmit vast amounts of information in a short amount of time have changed the way information is being shared amongst co-workers and managers throughout organizations across the globe. Starting in the 1980s with information and communications technologies ([[ICTs]]), organizations have seen an increase in the amount of technology that they rely on to communicate within and outside of the workplace. However, these implementations of technology in the workplace create various ethical concerns and in turn a need for further analysis of technology in organizations. As a result of this growing trend, a subsection of technoethics known as organizational technoethics has emerged to address these issues.

==Changes to organizational structure==
Organizational technoethics "focuses on how technological advances are redefining organizations and how they operate within an evolving knowledge economy".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H-SZbuxSGDMC|title=Technoethics and the Evolving Knowledge Society: Ethical Issues in Technological Design, Research, Development, and Innovation: Ethical Issues in Technological Design, Research, Development, and Innovation|first=Luppicini|last=Rocci|date=31 January 2010|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=9781605669533|location=Hershey, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|182}} This new focus on knowledge and information within organizations has changed the way they function on a daily basis and has made it apparent that "as knowledge-intensive work gradually becomes the cornerstone of this economy, understanding its control practices is consequential to organizational effectiveness, [[job satisfaction|worker satisfaction]] and ethical conditions of organizational governance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=clcom_facpub | title=Identity and technology: Organizational control of knowledge-intensive work | author=Guowei Jian |year=2008|journal=Qualitative Research Reports in Communication|volume=9|issue=1|pp=62–71|doi=10.1080/17459430802400365}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this "knowledge intensive work" at the forefront of most organizations, the efficient transmission of this knowledge and information now becomes a major priority to be carried out in the workplace. The introduction of the Internet in the workplace allowed employees to transmit information electronically not only to others in their own office but those in other countries as well. Technology began to facilitate the rapid exchange of information for these organizations and thus contributed to a structural change in how they operate. These changes prompted researchers to delve deeper into the issues surrounding organizational technoethics in how technology was shaping the workplace, whether positively or negatively, and the ethical issues that may arise.
The use of [[ICTs]] within organizations have given way to a new kind of office setting where physically being in the office is not mandatory to get the job done. This recent trend coined by many as the virtual workplace involves several workplaces that are connected through technology and are not hindered by physical restraints. Telecommuting, the hot desk, and virtual teams are the three major types of virtual workplaces that have been made possible through the use of technology and have changed the way many organizations communicate and transmit information.

==New ethical challenges==
The increasing use of ICTs in the workplace has presented organizations with new ethical challenges. It has been argued that ICT use in organizational settings can contribute to [[counterproductive work behaviour|counterproductive behaviour]] and deviancy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Counterproductive use of technology at work: Information &amp; communications technologies and cyberdeviancy | author=Terrance G. Weatherbee | journal=Human Resource Management Review | year=2010 | volume=20 | issue=1 | pages=35–44 | doi=10.1016/j.hrmr.2009.03.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the line between personal and professional lives becomes blurred.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Usually this behaviour consists of non-sanctioned use of ICTs during work hours, such as updating personal blogs, playing games, doing personal banking online, and using email for non-work related activities.
In response to these popular misuses of technology in the workplace, some organizations have implemented [[workplace surveillance]] technologies and content-control software to monitor and restrict employees' activities online.
ICT use in medical organizations has also given rise to new ethical dilemmas, such as the use of electronic medical records. These have created privacy concerns relating to potential breaches of doctor-patient confidentiality as well as concerns with information storage.

=== Organizational restrictions on social networking ===

One area of technoethics that is growing increasingly popular{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} is [[organizational ethics]] and technology. The introduction of technology into organizations has fueled many different questions. Among these many questions is whether or not the technology being used is ethical. Many different case studies have been conducted in organizations around the world. In these case studies, new technology that has been introduced to an organization is examined. During the examination, one ethical question that seems to be a main focus for researchers is whether or not the new technology maintains users' privacy.
The advent of technology has also opened up new avenues and opportunities for individuals to misbehave; for example, [[cyberloafing]], the act of employees using their companies' Internet access for personal purposes during work hours. While access to the internet may not result in an increase in production deviance with more people engaging in loafing per se, the temptation to do so is certainly higher since the Internet makes it so much easier and convenient to loaf in this manner. It is suggested by Lim when organizations are distributively, procedurally and interactionally unjust in their treatment of their employees (i.e., organizations have not given expected rewards or fair treatment in exchange for fair work), these employees are more likely to invoke the neutralization technique to legitimize their subsequent engagement in the act of cyberloafing. (Lim 2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.500.9309&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf | title=The IT way of loafing on the job: cyberloafing, neutralizing and organizational justice | author=VIVIEN K. G. LIM | journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior | year=2002 | volume=23 | pages=675–694 | doi=10.1002/job.161 | citeseerx=10.1.1.500.9309}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One technology that has grown in popularity in recent years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Growth of Social Media: From Passing Trend to International Obsession [Infographic] | url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/the-growth-of-social-media-from-trend-to-obsession-infographic/ | work=Adweek | date=January 27, 2014 | accessdate=March 26, 2017 | author=Kimberlee Morrison}}&lt;/ref&gt; is [[social networking]] sites, as many people use sites such as [[Facebook]] for personal and professional reasons. Organizations all over the world, including those in the Canadian province of Ontario, have begun to block access to Facebook and have led to [[criticism of Facebook]]. For example, in May 2007, Ontario government employees, Federal public servants, MPPs and cabinet ministers were blocked from access to Facebook on government computers. Employees trying to access Facebook received a warning message that read "The Internet website that you have requested has been deemed unacceptable for use for government business purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 5, 2008|url=https://www.thestar.com/News/article/210014|title=Facebook banned for Ontario staffers|publisher=The Toronto Star|date=May 3, 2007|author=Benzie, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of social networking sites led to a fear that government offices would become more vulnerable to [[Computer virus|viruses]] and [[hackers]]. However, with the government denying the use of these websites in their offices, many ethical questions arise about whether or not denying employees access to something that is readily available to everyone else is an infringement on the employees' rights and freedoms as Canadian citizens.

=== Technoethical challenges in medical organizations ===

Another area of organizational technoethics that has been becoming increasingly popular is in the field of medicine. [[Medical ethics]] are based on values and judgments in a practical clinical placement where six values are portrayed the most: autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, dignity, truthfulness and honesty. Many of the issues in medical ethics are due to a lack of communication between the patients, family members, and health care team. An asset to medical ethics that has brought attention to its advantages and disadvantages are [[electronic medical record|electronic medical records (EMRs)]]. This is a new way to update, organize and store patients' medical records in a database that can be accessible to other doctors by using the network.

An issue in organizational technoethics in the medical field that is an increasing matter is the privacy issue with electronic medical records. To start, some advantages of EMRs are that they can minimize errors, keep records safe in the database, it is cost efficient, translates into a better treatment for the patients and can even give some control over health records to the patients. On the other hand, EMRs have brought upon some disadvantages mainly around privacy issues. First, it threatens a patient's privacy. Having a patient's medical history recorded in the database loses the confidentiality between the doctor and patient since anyone who has access to the system is able to retrieve these files.

Moreover, some do not feel their medical records are safe in the database since others are able to get into personal files and potentially change medical records or misuse the information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Health WorldNet|year=2009|title=Electronic medical records: the pros and cons. |work=Health WorldNet Heads or Tails?|accessdate=February 16, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104160518/http://healthworldnet.com/HeadsOrTails/electronic-medical-records-the-pros-and-cons/?C=6238|archivedate=2010-01-04|url=http://healthworldnet.com/HeadsOrTails/electronic-medical-records-the-pros-and-cons/?C=6238}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of researchers conducted a study on the privacy issues raised by the use of EMRs. They concluded that all electronic systems around us have this [[point-to-multipoint|one-to-many]] exchange such as the internet and email just like the EMR system. However, more clarity needs to be provided around patient consent and patient restrictions as well as confidentiality issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= van der Linden, H.|author2=Kalra, D.|author3= Hasman, A.|author4=Talmon, J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=Inter-organizational future proof EHR systems: A review of the security and privacy related issues|journal=International Journal of Medical Informatics|volume=78|issue=3|pp=141–160|doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2008.06.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the issue of privacy at hand, many ethical questions have surfaced on whether this electronic system is safe or a hazard to patients due to the easy access and misuse of a patient's information.

=== Technoethics and surveillance ===

Organizational surveillance is becoming a reoccurring issue in the modern day workforce. Today's organizations are facing the ethical dilemma of [[privacy rights]] and meeting the societal demands of efficient productivity performances from employees. Organizations have restrictions on employees Web pages and have also implemented surveillance over workers email, [[Web browsing]], and even [[video surveillance]] at the workplace. Surveillance has become a technoethical challenge because the rapid development of surveillance technologies. Surveillance is a prominent technoethical challenge because it threatens democracy, privacy, power, as well as brings various types of rights together. Surveillance is a technoethical challenge because it encompasses many ethical dilemmas made by new technology. Surveillance is a technoethical challenges because it threatens personal liberties.&lt;ref name=globalist&gt;{{cite web|last=Haggerty &amp; Samatas|title=Surveillance and Democracy|url=http://www.cosmopolis.globalist.it/Detail_News_Display?ID=23835|work=The Globalist|date=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveillance is said to corrode interpersonal trust, which is essential for democratic governance.&lt;ref name=globalist/&gt; Citizens with access to new technologies are becoming more aware of the pervasiveness of these technologies.&lt;ref name=globalist/&gt; Surveillances has evolved from people called informers to technology. Citizens are now seen as consumers, and their preferences are monitored in order to feed citizens their preferences rather than serve them with broad perspective.&lt;ref name=globalist/&gt; This poses the question: Is it ethical to implement informational narrowcasting (only feeding citizens their preferences)? Surveillance also falls under many other categories and raises other ethical dilemmas. Another ethical dilemma would be: Should citizens be involved in the design process of technological policy on surveillance?

Surveillance can be ethical if states use it to protect national security and do not monitor citizens in the privacy of their bedroom and public washrooms.&lt;ref name=encyc&gt;{{cite web|last=Macnish|first=K.|title=Copyright &amp; Reprint Information|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/home/copyright/|work=Surveillance Ethics|publisher=International Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 " New surveillance" introduced by technological advances added to the degree of complexity and mobility, that society had not seen before.&lt;ref name=encyc/&gt; Surveillance has captured many areas of ethics and technology which translates into Technoethics. Surveillance has looked at power relationships in society, trust and autonomy, privacy, causes, authority as well as necessity, means, distance and social sorting.&lt;ref name=encyc/&gt; Technoethics refers to the systems approach taken to look at all of these issues surrounding dilemmas such as surveillance.

The branch of [[utilitarian]] ethical theories are "based on the assumption of the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{rp|26–27}} Under this perspective of ethical theories, organizational surveillance for the workers does not bring happiness; "Workplace surveillance has consequences for employees, affecting employee well-being, work culture, productivity, creativity and motivation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ball|first=K.|title=Workplace surveillance: An overview|journal=Labour History|year=2010|volume=51|series=1|pages=87–106|doi=10.1080/00236561003654776}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this report, the results show that surveillance produces the exact opposite results in which surveillance was implemented for, to increase workplace productivity. With organizational surveillance creating a workplace environment where employees feel unmotivated and as a result productivity will decrease. If the productivity of employees lack than the organization may not experience the rate of growth and success as wanted by management and ultimately, will lead to an overall unhappiness for both parties, employees and the organization.

Another branch of ethical theories which can be applied is [[duty ethics]]. Duty ethics is "concerned with the obligations one has to others in society".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{rp|26–27}} Under this perspective, organizations have the obligation to provide services and goods to society. In order to produce services and goods for society, organizations must be efficient in productivity. As result of this need, organizations have implemented surveillance on employees in order to meet this obligation. Also, employees have the obligation to meet their own performance goals at the workplace, which align with the overall goals of the organization.

=== Organizational restrictions on Internet publishing ===

{{See also|Internet censorship}}

The Internet has become a popular medium of expression and accessing information and data. As the Internet community expands, there has been great debate on whether or not the internet should be censored, and if so, by whom. In Canada, there are many public and private organisations with the authority to censor, including many self-censoring associations and service providers. [[Censorship in Canada|Canadian internet censorship]] is not specifically regulated; however local laws do apply to websites hosted in Canada as well as to residents who host sites on servers in other jurisdictions. Canada has seen many cases regarding websites including [[defamatory]] material&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fitzpatrick|first=M|title=Internet links not libel, top court rules|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/10/19/pol-scoc-hyperlink.html|work=CBC News|date=2011-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and material [[hate speech|promoting hatred or contempt]].

Important Canadian cases that raise the question of control of the flow of content on the Internet include:

* The [[Karla Homolka]] case. In 1993, the judge presiding over the trial of Karla Homolka placed a Canadian [[publication ban]] on the proceedings.&lt;ref name=peterson&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson &amp; Hutchinson|title=Interpreting Censorship in Canada|year=1999|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=0-8020-4164-7|pages=244–246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of the internet, internationally published materials were then made available in Canada, undermining the court order. McGill University, followed by a number of other universities, immediately took responsibility of the university law under law to control the reception of content within its own constituency because of its liability as an Internet Service Provider (ISP) to restrict Bernardo-Holmolka material to its internet users, and later extended these restrictions by removing access to various [[Usenet]] newsgroups which the administrators felt might be violating the Canadian laws regarding obscenity and hate literature.&lt;ref name=peterson/&gt;
* The [[Ernst Zündel]] case. Ernst Christof Friedrich Zundel, a German [[Holocaust denier]] living in Ontario, Canada and author of various works such as ''Did Six Million Really Die?'' and ''The Hitler We Loved and Why'' was charged by the Canadian Human Rights Commission for violation of [[Canadian Human Rights Commission free speech controversy#Section 13.281.29 of the Canadian Human Rights Act|Section 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act]], for promoting "hatred or contempt" against Jews through the American-based and operated "Zundelsite" Internet website. He was deported to Germany in 2005, after being declared a threat to Canada's [[national security]] in 2003.

Many cases were ruled through Section 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, such as the [[Marc Lemire]] case, which featured a "white nationalist" website hosted out of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. However, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (CHRT) found that Section 13 was unconstitutional and refused to apply the provisions against the individual for reasons of freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lemire|first=M.|title=Internet Censorship Case Finally gets Court Date|url=http://canadianhumanrightscommission.blogspot.ca/2011/05/internet-censorship-case-finally-gets.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; All other Section 13 cases in Canada have been postponed pending on final decision of the applicability of Section 13.

==Future==
Organizational ethics and technology is a hot-bed for discussion. Whether it is about the maintenance of worker's privacy or the censoring of social network sites, organizations are striving to find a way to balance both their worker's agency and their productivity. It seems the fluid nature of the Internet is forcing the hand of companies to allow their workers some benefits to access the sites they normally would outside of the office, while at the same time maintaining a strict policy to not abuse any privileges meted out.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The medical field has brought on a new technology that hopes to effectively and systematically ease the process of updating, storing, and organizing patient's records in a manner that suits both the patients and the doctors that treat them.
With the advent of electronic medical records (EMR), the field of medical ethics has also seen an influx in ethical discourse. While the technology is different from [[social media]] per se, the efforts to protect the worker's (or patient's) privacy is similar and equally paramount to their survival. Patients will look to online databases to ensure that their information is both correct and secure, while trying to maintain the pseudo-ageless "[[doctor-patient confidentiality]]", even with full knowledge that their information is accessible worldwide with the click of a button.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
Looking ahead to how EMR advances, and whether or not organizations will always feel the need to block social network sites all depends on how they continue to be used as people become more complacent with the technology. There will always be instances of ethical debates concerning technology within an organizational context, as the only things that seem to change are the technologies surrounding them.

'''Paul Haeberlin''' (17 February 1878, [[Kesswil]] – 29 September 1960, [[Basel]]) was a Swiss [[philosopher]] who at different times in his career took the standpoint that either religion or theoretical knowledge was the answer to human problems. He always gave philosophy an important role, but [[religion]] was to him the only way man could understand his real position in existence. Haeberlin made contributions to [[characterology]] and [[psychotherapeutics]], and was especially successful in treating psychopathic youth and teens. Made a full [[professor]] of philosophy, psychology and pedagogics at the [[University of Basel]].

[[Croatian Parliament|The Croatian Parliament]] voted in favour of Minister with 72 votes for and 49 against.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/glasovanje-o-povjerenju-ministru-pavi-barisicu---466370.html|title=Ministru Barišiću izglasano povjerenje u Saboru [The Croatian Parliament voted trust for Minister Barišić]|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in February 2018, the [[University of Augsburg]] also discarded any suspicion of the inappropriate scientific conduct in the case of his doctoral dissertation. The Prime Minister [[Andrej Plenković]] stated, “Barišić deserves an apology from those who attacked him”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/pavo-barisic-plagiranje-njemacka-misljenje-1229694|title=Plenković: Pavo Barišić zaslužuje ispriku onih koji su ga napadali [Plenković: Pavo Barišić deserves an apology from those who attacked him]|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

===  World and Ethos ===
The main topic of the book ''Welt und Ethos'' (1992) is [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel's]] attitude towards the sundown of the occidental spiritual development. It analyses the turning point from the pinnacle of the absolute [[idealism]] to the [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] eclipse of the European metaphysics''.'' In focus of its reconsideration is the concept of the world as ethos of the man, his whereabouts, abode, domicile, home, ecumene, the inhabited earth. It sheds light on Hegel's re-narration of the teleological order of events in the world history.

The book finishes with a famous parable on the spirit as a seed. Through this comparison, the ambiguous and dialectical nature of Hegel's view emerges into the broad daylight: "He has proved that the western spiritual life has attained its ripeness. After that, the ripened seed has to fall off, decay and decline. However, Hegel's position differs substantially from the nihilism that followed it; thus, he does not consider only one side of the completion of the spirit in the world. The development does not end in the sheer ruination of the thousands years’ work of the spirit in the world. From the ripened fruit arises a new seed, a new principle and life."&lt;ref&gt;Barišić, Pavo (1992): Welt und Ethos. Hegels Stellung zum Untergang des Abendlandes. Würzburg: Königshausen &amp; Neumann, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Erwin Hufnagel explains that this study "propounds all substantial parts of Hegel's philosophy" and "takes into consideration the relevant secondary literature with a rare systematic potency and impressive capability of differentiation".&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Hufnagel (1995): Philosophischer Literaturanzeiger. Frankfurt a. M.  48/1, p. 49. "Barišić evades the temptation conjured up just by Hegelianism to decay philosophy as a sheer history of philosophy. The Hegel presentation of Barišić breaths from the first to the last page the spirit of the pertaining and existential founded philosophising.  The order-thinking of Hegel should be set against the (post)enlightenment's destructions of the teleological interpretation of world and man as salvation challenge. Hegel's philosophy appears as a culmination of the occidental teleological thinking to which is promised – contrary to enlightenment's intentions – a worldwide future."&lt;/ref&gt;

===   Ethical Ideal of Democracy ===
In the thematic issue on ''Democracy and Political Education,'' edited on the 150th anniversary of John Dewey, Barišić highlights two ''key moral criteria'' "that in a special way point to the superiority of the educational ideal in a democratic community over any other form of social integration. First, there is the level of common interest that is realised in a society. The second principle is that of freedom to develop new common and individual interests in various forms of association."&lt;ref&gt;Barišić, Pavo (2010): Democracy and Political Education. Introduction. Synthesis Philosophica. Zagreb. 25/49 (1/2010), p. 4. http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=88274&lt;/ref&gt;

The main question is whether the ethical ideal of humanity could be applied as a philosophical basis for the evaluation and justification of democratic practices. The study considers that Dewey's advocacy of strengthening the moral and participative democracy links in local communities was the reason why his model of democracy has found its way into the [[Communitarianism|communitarian]] discourse. [[John Dewey|Dewey]] does not destroy the foundations of liberalism and democracy by emphasising the substantial ''communication-community-common'' connection, but rather enriches, strengthens, and takes the same to a higher level.&lt;ref&gt;Barišić, Pavo (2010): Ethisches Ideal der Demokratie. [Ethical Ideal of Democracy]. Synthesis Philosophica. Zagreb. 25/49 (1/2010), p. 56. http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=88295&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deliberative Democracy ===
In his essay on ''Aristotle's Thinking of the Many and Deliberation'', Barišić argues against the elitist theory of democracy. His standpoint is that, through the process of [[deliberation]], a group of people acquire a new quality; they become a unity and a community. When citizens get together to deliberate and make common decisions upon thoughtful consideration, they reach a cognitive and moral level which is higher than the level of a minority of experts and honourable individuals, the so-called ''elite'', regardless of their individually achieved perfections.

Barišić elaborates five arguments of Aristotle's in favour of the democratic deliberation of the multitude: [[Politics|political]], [[Ethics|ethical]], [[Dianetics|dianoetic]], [[Teleology|teleological]], and [[collective responsibility]]. He concludes that [[Aristotle]] brought to light fundamental arguments on deliberation and the advantages of the rule of the many that are, in some way, still valid today. Politics is neither a mere procedure ([[John Rawls|Rawls]]) nor a purely a rational discourse ([[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]]). It is practical wisdom, judgment, and a matter of deliberation and pooling by the many.&lt;ref&gt;Barišić, Pavo (2015): Aristoteles’ Vielheitsdenken und die Deliberation [Aristotle's Thinking of the Many and Deliberation]. In: Ottmann, Henning / Barišić, Pavo (eds.), Deliberative Demokratie. Baden-Baden: Nomos. 13-49. http://www.nomos-shop.de/Ottmann-Barisic-Deliberative-Demokratie/productview.aspx?product=23952&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Ideal of the Rule of the People ===
In his book The Ideal of the Rule of the People, Barišić reconsiders certain significant stations of the historical sailing of the ship of democracy. His central reflections are devoted to contemporary straits, cliffs and storms that democracy is facing at different meridians. Particular attention is paid to global perspectives and projections of advantages and perils that the democracy vessel is to expect in the future.

Barišić argues that the great story of the rule of the people in the world has not ended yet. It continues indeed, with democracy thus being regenerated and rejuvenated. "It has not withered in ‘post-democracy’. Irrespective of all the deficiencies and shortcomings which are observable in political acting, the crucial goals which politics aspires to pursue in achieving freedom, equality, justice, human rights and the common good are something that makes politics precious and noble. The democratic path to these objectives is shorter and safer than others."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ideal vladavine puka. Uvod u filozofiju demokracije [The Ideal of the Rule of the People. Introduction to the Philosophy of Democracy]|last=Barišić|first=Pavo|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=Zagreb/Split|pages=260|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cosmopolitan Democracy ===
The book on [[Cosmopolitan democracy|Cosmopolitan Democracy]], edited with Henning Ottmann, rounds out their trilogy on the contemporary issues of the “rule by the people”. In his reconsideration of the “scope and aporias of cosmopolitan democracy”, Barišić comes to the final verdict that the idea of cosmopolitan democracy is a noble-hearted vision that, for the time being, contains a “flaw” of appropriate realization in the present realpolitik.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kosmopolitische Demokratie (Cosmopolitan Democracy)|last=Ottmann|first=Henning|last2=Barišić|first2=Pavo|publisher=Nomos|year=2018|isbn=|location=Baden-Baden|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, he argues for the unique historical project of the [[European Union]] as one of the successful attempts to transfer the content of human rights protection on the transnational level.&lt;ref&gt;“Einzigartiges historisches Projekt der Europäischen Union ist eins der erfolgreichen Versuche, wie man den Inhalt der Menschenrechtsverbürgung auf einer demokratischen Grundlage auch übernational fortbilden kann.” Ibid. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Poitiers]], he became a pupil of [[Thierry of Chartres]] at [[Paris]] in the 1130s, also teaching [[grammar]] and [[rhetoric]] in his school. Around 1155 he returned to Poitiers where he later died.&lt;ref name="Kneepkens"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8u2CeWdd6FEC|page=Ch. 3, pp. 512−513|chapter=Peter Helias|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2005|author=C.

Through Thierry, he is meant to have been influenced particularly by [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]; other influences include [[William of Conches]]. He contributed to the theory of substance and influenced [[Roger Bacon]]'s ''[[Overview of Grammar]]''.

In [[linguistics]], he is regarded as having contributed ideas key to the development of grammatical categories such as [[Lexical category|parts of speech]].

'''Shaikh Mohammad Razaullah Ansari''' is a historian of science, physicist, astronomer and author from [[India]].

==Biography==
Shaikh Mohammad Razaullah Ansari (born 8 April 1932 in [[Delhi]])) was born to a family of scholars. He got  his B.Sc.(Honours) and M.Sc. in Physics from [[Delhi University]] in 1953 and 1955 respectively. In 1956 he joined as a lecturer in Physics in [[Zakir Husain College|Delhi College]], Delhi (now renamed as [[Zakir Hussain College]]). He secured a research fellowship of [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation]] (Bonn, Germany) in 1959.

He worked there first at the Institute of Theoretical Physics  and later shifted to [[Eberhard Karl University]] at [[Tuebingen]] (Germany), where he completed his D.Sc. ([[Dr. rer. nat.]]) in 1966 in [[Mathematical Physics]]. During his sojourn in Germany,  he specialized also in the history of exact science in India and Islamic countries. He researched during 1966-1969 as a research scholar/associate  of German Council of Research in various capacities.

In  1969, he was invited by the [[Aligarh Muslim University]] to join the Physics Department as a Reader in theoretical physics. There he established a research group of astrophysics. His astrophysical work in Solar physics and Interstellar Matter was recognized both nationally and internationally by his election as a Fellow of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] (UK) in 1972 and as a Member of [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) in 1973. Besides joining IAU Commissions of his specialty, Ansari joined also IAU Commission 41(History of Astronomy)in which he became so active that he was elected as its Vice-president for 1991–1994, and President for 1994-1997. Ansari was the first Indian/Asian President of  Commission 41 since its inception.

In 1997 he organized a symposium on History of Oriental Astronomy at the General Assembly of IAU, held in Kyoto, the proceedings of which  was edited by  him and published. Thereafter, Ansari shifted his research field to history of astronomy and mathematics, particularly of Medieval India, which, after his retirement in 1994 from Aligarh Muslim University, has become his passion for researching primary sources of history of science.

==Works and achievements==
His works are extant in the field of [[Planet]], [[Venus]], [[Transit of Venus]], [[Sun]], [[Astronomy in medieval Islam]] and [[Indian astronomy]] where he is well cited&lt;ref&gt;Astronomical Archives in India http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/~pbrosche/iaucomm41/meetings/ga2000/as_ansari.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded Humboldt Fellowship, [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation]] to work in [[Germany]]

==Books==
He contributed many chapters on history of science in many books, but here are some of his books based on [[Zij]], [[Avempace]], [[Qotb al-Din Shirazi]] that he edited:

'''Sante Poromaa''' Roshi is a [[Zen]] Buddhist priest and teacher, in the lineage of Harada-Yasutani. He was born in 1958 in Kiruna, Sweden, and commenced his Zen training in the early eighties, as a student of Roshi [[Philip Kapleau]]. When Roshi Kapleau went into semi-retirement, he also became a student of Kapleau's successor, Roshi [[Bodhin Kjolhede]].&lt;ref name="Ford, 159"&gt;Ford, 159&lt;/ref&gt;

Poromaa was ordained as a Zen priest in 1991. He finished his formal koan training in 1993. In 1998, he was authorized to teach by Roshi Kjolhede, and has been teaching full-time since then. Together with his co-teacher [[Kanja Odland]] Roshi, he has been instrumental in the creation of a full-time training temple in rural Sweden called Zengården, as well as the growth and development of a network of city Zen Centers in Sweden, Finland and Scotland.
  
Poromaa offers regular [[sesshin]] (meditation retreats) at Zengården, in English.  He also gives public talks on Zen and contributes to Swedish public life through participation in panel discussions on current social,  philosophical and religious issues.

Although an artist by training, Poromaa has had a lifelong interest in science. His investigations of the possibility of finding common ground between the Buddhist and scientific worldviews led to the publication in 2009 of his book “The Net of Indra – Rebirth in Science and Buddhism”.

'''Shadia B. Drury''' (born 1950) is a Canadian academic and [[political commentator]] of [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] [[Copts|Coptic]] origin. She is [[Canada Research Chair]] in [[Social Justice]] at the [[University of Regina]], in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], the provincial capital of [[Saskatchewan]], Canada. In 2005, she was elected to fellowship in the [[Royal Society of Canada]]. She is a columnist for ''[[Free Inquiry]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Inquiry editorial staff|url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=fi&amp;page=details}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and academic interests==

Drury was educated at [[Queen's University]] (BA Hons, MA), in Kingston, Ontario, and [[York University]] (Ph.D., Political Science, 1978) in Toronto, Ontario.  Her doctoral thesis was entitled ''The Concept of Natural Law''.

Drury has taught Political Science and [[Philosophy]] at two western Canadian universities: first at the [[University of Calgary]] and now at the [[University of Regina]], where she holds the [[Canada Research Chair]] in Social Justice. Her objective in the position is to undertake an extensive publishing program, which includes books on [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]'s theory of [[justice]] and its relation to the current [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] trends, a critique of the rise of [[populism]] in Canada, an analysis of the [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[conservatism|conservative]] approaches to tradition (''Tradition and Taboo''), and a book on the relationship between Western liberalism and the growth of radical [[feminism]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

==Criticism==
Several political philosophers consider Drury's attacks on Strauss and his followers to be unfounded. In his 2009 book, ''Straussophobia: Defending Leo Strauss and Straussians against Shadia Drury and Other Accusers'', Peter Minowitz argues that Drury’s work is “plagued by exaggerations, misquotations, contradictions, factual errors, and defective documentation.”&lt;ref&gt;Peter Minowitz, Straussophobia: Defending Leo Strauss and Straussians against Shadia Drury and Other Accusers (Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Oluwole was born in [[Igbara-oke]], [[Ondo State]], in 1936. She went to school in [[Ife]], and was critical of the education system in the 1940s, saying a woman's career prospects were "not your ambition: it was your parents' ambition."&lt;ref name="punchng.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://punchng.com/mum-never-believed-become-professor-sophie-oluwole/|title=My mum never believed I could become a professor –Sophie Oluwole|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview Jesusegun Alagbe, Oluwole describes an event during school, where she was sent to a hospital to distribute food and medicine, and was scared by the desperately sick patients, saying "That day, I knew I was not going to be a nurse."&lt;ref name="punchng.com"/&gt;

She studied History, Geography and Philosophy at the [[UNILAG]] in Lagos, and eventually settled on philosophy. Following her first degree, she was employed in UNILAG for a time as an assistant lecturer in 1972, and went on to complete her PhD in philosophy at the [[University of Ibadan]]. Oluwole is the first female doctorate degree holder in philosophy in Nigeria.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; Now a qualified professor, Oluwole taught African Philosophy at UNILAG for six years between 2002 and 2008.

Oluwole's teachings and works are generally attributed to the Yoruba school of philosophical thought, which was ingrained in the cultural and religious beliefs([[Ifá]]) of the various regions of [[Yorubaland]]. According to Oluwole, this branch of philosophy predates the Western tradition, as the ancient African philosopher [[Orunmila]] predates [[Socrates]] by her estimate. These two thinkers, representing the values of the African and Western traditions, are two of Oluwole's biggest influences, and she compares the two in her book ''Socrates and Orunmila.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ajeluorou|first1=Anote|title=Socrates and Orunmila… Putting Premium On Africa’s Indigenous Philosophy|url=https://guardian.ng/art/socrates-and-orunmila-putting-premium-on-africas-indigenous-philosophy/|newspaper=[[The Guardian (Nigeria)]]|accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''third man argument''' (commonly referred to as '''TMA'''; {{lang-grc-gre|τρίτος ἄνθρωπος}}), first appears in [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]''. (132a–b) [[Parmenides]] (speaking to [[Socrates]]) uses the example of μέγεθος (''mégethos''; "greatness") in a [[philosophical]] criticism of the [[theory of Forms]]. The theory of forms is formulated based on the speeches of characters across various dialogues by Plato, although it is often attributed to Plato himself. The argument was furthered by [[Aristotle]] (''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' 990b17–1079a13, 1039a2; ''[[Sophistic Refutations]]'' 178b36 [[wikt:ff.|ff.]]) who, rather than using the example of "greatness" (μέγεθος), used the example of a man (hence the name of the argument) to explain this objection to the theory, which he attributes to Plato; Aristotle posits that if a man is a man because he partakes in the form of man, then a third form would be required to explain how man and the form of man are both man, and so on, ''[[ad infinitum]]''.

==Principles of Plato's theory of Forms==
Plato's [[theory of Forms]], as it is presented in such dialogues as the ''[[Phaedo]]'', ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' and the first part of the ''Parmenides'', seems committed to the following principles: 

"F" stands for any [[Theory of Forms#Forms|Form]] ("appearance, property")—''forma'' is a Boethian translation for εἶδος (''eidos''), which is the word that Plato used. Plato, in the ''Parmenides'', uses the example "greatness" (μέγεθος) for "F-ness"; Aristotle uses the example "man".&lt;ref&gt;"No proper exposition of Plato’s Third ''Great'' Paradox appears in the surviving texts of Aristotle. There are only scattered references in the text to an [[argument]] that Aristotle calls the "Third ''Man''" (''Metaphysics'' 84.23-85.3, 93.1-7, 990b 17=1079a 13, 1039a 2, 1059b 8; ''Sophistic Refutations'' 178b 36), which is commonly considered essentially the same argument", [http://www.philos.msu.ru/fac/dep/scient/confdpt/2007/theses/Vandoulakis.pdf]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, retrieved 2008-01-18&lt;/ref&gt;

*One-over-many: For any plurality of F things, there is a form of F-ness by virtue of partaking of which each member of that plurality is F.
*Self-predication: Every form of F-ness is itself F.
*Non-self-partaking: No form partakes of itself.
*Uniqueness: For any property F, there is exactly one form of F-ness.
*Purity: No form can have contrary properties.
*One/many: The property of being one and the property of being many are contraries.
*Oneness: Every form is one.

==The argument==
However, the TMA shows that these principles are mutually contradictory, as long as there is a plurality of things that are F:

(In what follows, μέγας [''megas''; "great"] is used as an example; however, the argumentation holds for any F.)

Begin, then, with the assumption that there is a plurality of great things, say (A, B, C). By one-over-many, there is a form of greatness (say, G1) by virtue of partaking of which A, B, and C are great. By self-predication, G1 is great. 

But then we can add G1 to (A, B, C) to form a new plurality of great things: (A, B, C, G1). By one-over-many, there is a form of greatness (say, G2) by virtue of partaking of which A, B, C, and G1 are great. But in that case G1 partakes of G2, and by Non-Self-Partaking, G1 is not identical to G2. So there are at least two forms of greatness, G1 and G2. This already contradicts Uniqueness, according to which there is exactly one (and hence no more than one) form of greatness.

But it gets worse for the theory of Forms. For by Self-Predication, G2 is great, and hence G2 can be added to (A, B, C, G1) to form a new plurality of great things: (A, B, C, G1, G2). By One-Over-Many, there is a form of greatness (say, G3) by virtue of partaking of which A, B, C, G1, and G2 are great. But in that case G1 and G2 both partake of G3, and by Non-Self-Partaking, neither of G1 and G2 is identical to G3. So there must be at least three forms of greatness, G1, G2, and G3.

Repetition of this reasoning shows that there is an infinite hierarchy of forms of greatness, with each form partaking of the infinite number of forms above it in the hierarchy. According to Plato, anything that partakes of many things must itself be many. So each form in the infinite hierarchy of forms of greatness is many. But then, given Purity and One/Many, it follows that each form in the infinite hierarchy of forms of greatness is not one. This contradicts Oneness.

== Interpretation ==
Some scholars (including [[Gregory Vlastos]]) believe that the TMA is a "record of honest perplexity". Other scholars think that Plato means us to reject one of the premises that produces the infinite regress (namely, One-Over-Many, Self-Predication, or Non-Self-Partaking). But it is also possible to avoid the contradictions produced by the TMA by rejecting Uniqueness and Purity (while accepting One-Over-Many, Self-Predication, and Non-Self-Partaking).

In the [[Catholic Church]], the veneration of [[Mary, mother of Jesus]], encompasses various [[Marian devotion]]s which include prayer, pious acts, visual arts, poetry, and music devoted to the Blessed Virgin Mary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|date=27 March 1927|title=Santa Maria|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,730158-1,00.html|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|doi=|pmid=|access-date=6 June 2016|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFFJb3uNxdUC&amp;pg=PA151|title=Symbolic Scores: Studies in the Music of the Renaissance|last=Elders|first=Willem|publisher=E.J.

The term "[[Mariolatry]]" is a [[Protestant]] pejorative label for perceived excessive Catholic devotion to Mary.

Belief in the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] of [[God the Son]] through Mary is the basis for calling her the [[Mother of God (Roman Catholic)|Mother of God]], which was declared a dogma at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431. At the [[Second Vatican Council]] and in [[Pope John Paul II]]'s encyclical ''[[Redemptoris Mater|Redemptoris mater]]'', she is spoken of also as Mother of the Church.&lt;ref name="RedMater" /&gt;

Growth of Roman Catholic veneration of Mary and [[Mariology (Roman Catholic)|Mariology]] has often come not from official declarations, but from [[Mariology of the saints|Marian writings of the saints]], popular devotion, and at times reported [[Marian apparitions]]. The [[Holy See]] approves only a select few as worthy of belief; most recently the 2008 recognition of apparitions as far back as 1665.&lt;ref name="catholicnewsagency1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/vatican_recognizes_marian_apparitions_in_france/|title=Vatican recognizes Marian apparitions in France|date=5 May 2008|work=[[Catholic News Agency]]|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="catholicnewsagency2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/expert_explains_churchs_criteria_for_confirming_marian_apparitions/|title=Expert explains Church’s criteria for confirming Marian apparitions.|last=Perrella|first=Salvatore M.|date=8 May 2008|work=[[Catholic News Agency]]|publisher=|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further pious veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary encouraged by [[Pope]]s are exhibited in the [[canonical coronation]]s granted to popular Marian images venerated in a particular locality all over the world, while [[Marian movements and societies]] with millions of members have arisen from belief in events such as [[Our Lady of Akita|Akita]], [[Our Lady of Fatima|Fátima]], and [[Our Lady of Lourdes|Lourdes]], and other reasons.&lt;ref name="udayton1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/index.php|title=Pastoral Marian Organizations in the United States|last=Hogan|first=Robert|last2=Kulkarni|first2=Sumithra|date=7 February 2012|website=International Marian Research Institute|publisher=The Marian Library/International Marian Research Institute|orig-year=1995|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==From Christ to Mary in the Roman Catholic tradition==
{{Roman Catholic Mariology}}

In Roman Catholic teachings, the veneration of Mary is a natural consequence of [[Christology]]: Jesus and Mary are son and mother, redeemer and redeemed.&lt;ref name="Rahner903"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|year=2004|title=Mariology|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Theology: A Concise Sacramentum Mundi|publisher=St Pauls|location=Mumbai|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WtnR-6_PlJAC|accessdate=6 June 2016|last=Schmaus|first=Michael|date=|origyear=1975|editor-last=Rahner|editor-first=Karl|pages=893–905|isbn=9780860120063}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This sentiment was expressed by [[Pope John Paul II]] in his encyclical ''Redemptoris mater'': "At the centre of this mystery, in the midst of this wonderment of faith, stands Mary. As the loving Mother of the Redeemer, she was the first to experience it: 'To the wonderment of nature you bore your Creator'!"&lt;ref name="RedMater"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25031987_redemptoris-mater_en.html|title=''Redemptoris mater''|date=25 March 1987|location=Rome|work=The Holy See|accessdate=6 June 2016|author=Pope John Paul II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Roman Catholic tradition Mariology is seen as Christology developed to its full potential.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Pope Pius XII]], ''[[Mystici corporis Christi]]''; [[John Henry Cardinal Newman]]: ''Mariology is always christocentric'', in Michael Testa, ''Mary: The Virgin Mary in the Life and Writings of John Henry Newman'' (2001); and ''Mariology Is Christology'' in [[Vittorio Messori]], "The Mary Hypothesis" (Rome, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Mary is seen as contributing to a fuller understanding of the life of Jesus. In this view, a Christology without Mary is not based on the total revelation of the Bible. Traces of this parallel interpretation go back to the early days of Christianity and numerous saints have since focused on it.&lt;ref name=Rahner903 /&gt;

The development of this approach continued into the 20th century. In his 1946 publication ''Compendium Mariologiae'', [[Mariology(RC)|Mariologist]] [[Gabriel Roschini]] explained that Mary not only participated in the birth of the physical Jesus, but, with conception, she entered with him into a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] union. The divine salvation plan, being not only material, includes a permanent spiritual unity with Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mary for Evangelicals: Toward an Understanding of the Mother of Our Lord|last=Perry|first=Tim|last2=Abraham|first2=William J.|publisher=InterVarsity Press|year=2006|isbn=9780830825691|edition=Illustrated|location=Downers Grove, Illinois|pages=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t_JtmrGDLB4C|title=Mary's Pope: John Paul II, Mary, and the Church Since Vatican II|last=Nachef|first=Antoine|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2000|isbn=9781580510776|location=Franklin, Wisconsin|pages=9|access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0L_WmgEACAAJ|title=Mariologie|last=Schmaus|first=Michael|publisher=Hueber|year=1955|isbn=|series=''Katholische Dogmatik'' [''Catholic Dogma'']|volume=5|location=|pages=328|trans-title=Mariology|access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger (later [[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote: "It is necessary to go back to Mary if we want to return to that 'truth about Jesus Christ,' 'truth about the Church' and 'truth about man' that [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] proposed as a program to all of Christianity," in order to ensure an authentic approach to Christology via a return to the "whole truth about Mary".&lt;ref name="BurkeMariology"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ez0VRbQi1i4C|title=Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, Seminarians and Consecrated Persons|publisher=Seat of Wisdom Books|year=2007|isbn=9781579183554|editor-last=Miravalle|editor-first=Mark I.|location=Goleta, Georgia|pages=xxi–xxiii|chapter=Editor's Introduction|access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==From veneration to theology==
It is possible that the practice of invoking the aid of the Mother of Christ had become more familiar to the faithful some time before any expression of it in the writings of the [[Early Church Fathers]].&lt;ref name="Thurston"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary|encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|location=New York|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15459a.htm|accessdate=6 June 2016|last=Thurston|first=Herbert|date=1912|volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christians' love for Mary intuited, frequently in anticipation, certain aspects of the mystery of the Blessed Virgin, calling the attention of theologians and pastors to them.&lt;ref name="gaudience"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ewtn.com/library/papaldoc/jp2bvm4.htm|title=Church Grew in Understanding of Mary's Role|last=Pope John Paul II|date=15 November 1995|publisher=The Cathedral Foundation|newspaper=[[L'Osservatore Romano]]|page=11|access-date=6 June 2016|via=[[EWTN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venerative and devotional practices have often preceded formal theological declarations by the [[Magisterium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DWdk0AZlzZIC|title=The Liturgy and Time|last=Martimort|first=Aimé Georges|last2=Dalmais|first2=Irénée Henri|last3=Jounel|first3=Pierre|publisher=The Liturgical Press|others=Translated by Matthew J.

The veneration of the Blessed Virgin takes place in various ways. Marian prayers and hymns usually begin with praise of her, followed by petitions.&lt;ref name=MMiles /&gt; The number of Marian titles continued to grow as of the 3rd century, and many titles existed by the 5th century, growing especially during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, Volume 2'' by André Vauchez et al 2001 {{ISBN|1-57958-282-6}} page 919&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theological basis for the veneration of Mary===
Veneration for Mary is based on the reference in the Gospel of Luke to Mary as the selected handmaid of the Lord who is greeted and praised by both [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]] and the angel [[Gabriel]]. God's work is further illuminated in the Marian dogmas of the Roman Catholic Church such as the [[Immaculate Conception]] and the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]], and are, in the Roman Catholic view, part of the apostolic tradition and divine revelation.&lt;ref name= McNally132&gt;McNally, Terrence, ''What Every Catholic Should Know about Mary'' {{ISBN|1-4415-1051-6}} p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bäumer, 597&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics distinguish veneration from worship.

===Mary's role in salvation and redemption===
[[File:Retable de l'Agneau mystique (3).jpg|thumb|left|180px|The Virgin Mary from the [[Ghent Altarpiece]], 1432]]

One of the components of the Catholic veneration of Mary is the focus on her participation in the processes of salvation and redemption.&lt;ref&gt;Haffner, Paul. ''The mystery of Mary'', 2004 {{ISBN|0-85244-650-0}} p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; This has been explored by such writers as [[Edward Schillebeeckx]] and [[Adrienne von Speyr]].&lt;ref&gt;Schillebeeckx, Edward. ''Mary, mother of the redemption'', 1964, ASIN B003KW30VG pp. 82–84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Speyr, Adrienne, ''Mary in the Redemption'', 2003 {{ISBN|0-89870-955-5}} pp. 2–7&lt;/ref&gt;

John's Gospel records her presence at the beginning and end of his public life. Particularly significant is Mary's presence at the Cross, when she received from her dying Son the charge to be mother to the beloved disciple and, in him, to all Christians.&lt;ref name=gaudience/&gt; The Acts of the Apostles expressly numbers the Mother of Jesus among the women of the first community awaiting Pentecost. [[John Eudes]] wrote that: "The Virgin Mary began to cooperate in the plan of salvation, from the moment she gave her consent to the Incarnation of the Son of God".&lt;ref name=Aumann&gt;''Spiritual Theology'' by Jordan Aumann 1980 {{ISBN|0-7220-8518-4}} pp. 62–67&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Lumen gentium]]'', the 1964 Dogmatic Constitution of the Church recognized, "...all the salvific influence of the Blessed Virgin on men originates, not from some inner necessity, but from the divine pleasure. It flows forth from the superabundance of the merits of Christ, rests on His mediation, depends entirely on it and draws all its power from it."&lt;ref name=ppvi&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html Pope Paul VI. ''Lumen gentium'', §60, 21 November 1964]&lt;/ref&gt; In a singular way she cooperated by her obedience, faith, hope, and burning charity in the work of the Savior in giving back supernatural life to souls. "Wherefore she is our mother in the order of grace."{{sfn|''Lumen gentium'', §61}}

One of the first scholars to offer theological foundations on the subject of the [[Immaculate Conception]] was the Franciscan [[Duns Scotus]] who developed the concept that Mary was preserved from sin by the redemptive virtue of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;''Summa Theologiae: Volume 51, Our Lady: 3a. 27–30'' by Thomas Aquinas, Thomas R. Heath 2006 {{ISBN|0-521-02959-7}} page 114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi'' by Karl Rahner 2004 {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}} pages 896–898 [https://books.google.com/books?id=WtnR-6_PlJAC&amp;pg=PA897&amp;dq=mary+redemption&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6gSdTIyGLsiVswab37DmDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAjge#v=onepage&amp;q=mary%20redemption&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3'' by Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley 2003 {{ISBN|90-04-12654-6}} page 407 [https://books.google.com/books?id=7ly4DgtT3LkC&amp;pg=PA407&amp;dq=mary+redemption&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MAOdTO_KNs3Lswb1pbTmDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=mary%20redemption&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Devotions to and the veneration of the Virgin Mary continued to spread, as she came to be seen as the helpful mother of Christians, and by the 15th century these practices had oriented many Catholic devotions.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, Volume 2'' by André Vauchez, Richard Barrie Dobson, Adrian Walford, Michael Lapidge 2001 {{ISBN|1-57958-282-6}} page 919&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint [[Veronica Giuliani]] expressed how Mary's suffering in Calvary united her heart with that of Jesus as she suffered each torment along with him.&lt;ref&gt;''Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, Seminarians, and Consecrated Persons'' by Raymond Burke et al. 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-57918-355-4}} pages 372–373&lt;/ref&gt; The joint devotion to the hearts was formalized by Jean Eudes who organized the scriptural and theological foundations and developed its liturgical themes.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Calkins, ''The Theology of the Alliance of the Two Hearts'', [[Missio Immaculatae]] (English Edition) Year III, N° 4 (May to December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The venerative aspects of the united nature of the two hearts continued through the centuries and in 1985 Pope [[John Paul II]] coined the term ''[[Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary]]'', and in 1986 addressed the international conference on that topic held at [[Fátima, Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/1986/september/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19860922_simposio-maria-gesu_en.html | publisher = Vatican | accessdate = October 4, 2010 | title = Address of his Holiness John Paul II to the Participants of the Study Week of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences|author=Pope John Paul II}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/angelus/1985/documents/hf_jp-ii_ang_19850915_it.html|title=Angelus, 15 settembre 1985 - Giovanni Paolo II|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Proceedings of the International Theological Symposium on the Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary'', September 1986, Fatima, Portugal&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 18th century, the continued growth of Marian veneration had emphasized the role of the Virgin Mary in salvation. The Catholic focus on the role of Mary in salvation and redemption continued with [[Pope John Paul II]]'s 1987 encyclical ''Redemptoris mater''&lt;ref name="RedMater" /&gt;

===Mary as protectress and intercessor===
{{see also|Mother of the Church}}
[[File:Sano di Pietro. Madonna of Mercy.1440s Private coll..jpg|thumb|The ''[[Virgin of Mercy]]'' protecting a group of nuns under her mantle. [[Sano di Pietro]], 15th century.]]
It was through Mary's intercession, through compassion for the hosts, at the marriage feast of Cana, that Jesus worked his first miracle.{{sfn|''Lumen gentium'', §61}}

The ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' states: "From the most ancient times the Blessed Virgin has been honored with the title of 'Mother of God,' to whose protection the faithful fly in all their dangers and needs."&lt;ref name="ccc971"/&gt; The [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] observe the feast of the [[Intercession of the Theotokos]] in October.

Roman Catholic views of the Virgin Mary as refuge and advocate of sinners, protector from dangers and powerful intercessor with her Son, Jesus are expressed in prayers, artistic depictions, theology, and popular and devotional writings, as well as in the use of religious articles and images.&lt;ref&gt;Bunson, Matthew. ''Our Sunday Visitor's Catholic Almanac'', 2009 {{ISBN|1-59276-441-X}} p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laughlin, Corinna and Lee, Sara McGinnis. ''The Catholic Handbook for Visiting the Sick and Homebound''2010 {{ISBN|978-1-56854-886-9}} p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known prayer to Mary, the ''[[Sub tuum praesidium]]'', ("Under your protection") dates from about the 3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marian.org/mary/prayers/|title=Our Blessed Mother's Intercession - Marians of the Immaculate Conception|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artistic depictions of the [[Virgin of Mercy]] portray the role of Mary as the protector of Christians, as she shelters them under her mantle. The Virgin of Mercy depictions sometimes include arrows raining from above, with the Virgin's cloak protecting the people.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, James. 1983, ''A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art'' {{ISBN|0-7195-3971-4}} page 222&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholics have continued to seek the protection of Mary as the [[Mother of Sorrows]] and relied on her intercession as the [[Queen of Heaven]] since the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, James P., ''Mary and the Saints: Companions on the Journey'', 2001 {{ISBN|0-8294-1725-7}} pp. 41–45&lt;/ref&gt; Building on that sentiment, popes have entrusted specific causes to the protection of the Virgin Mary. Pope [[Benedict XV]] entrusted the protection of the world through the intercession of Mary Queen of Peace during the [[World War I|First World War]] .&lt;ref&gt;Sri, Edward P., and Hahn, Scott. ''Queen Mother: A Biblical Theology of Mary's Queenship'', 2005 {{ISBN|1-931018-24-3}} p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy]], also known as the order of ''Our Lady of Ransom'' or ''Order of Captives'' began in the 13th century in the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] (Spain) to ransom captive Christians (slaves) held in Muslim hands. The order now focuses on the role of the Virgin Mary as the protector of captives and prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;by Joseph, Chandlery Peter. ''Mary's Praise on Every Tongue: A Record of Homage Paid to Our Blessed Lady'', 2009 {{ISBN|1-113-16154-X}} p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

The depictions of [[Our Lady of Navigators]] arose from the prayers and devotions of Portuguese navigators, who saw the Virgin Mary as their protector during storms and other hazards. Prayers to Our Lady of Navigators are well known in South America, specially [[Brazil]], where its February 2 feast is an official holiday.&lt;ref&gt;Goucher, Candice Lee. 2007 ''World history: journeys from past to present'' {{ISBN|0-415-77137-4}} p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;del Rio, Vicente. ''Contemporary urbanism in Brazil'', 2009  {{ISBN|0-8130-3281-4}} p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Virgin of the Navigators]], depicting ships under her mantle, is the earliest known painting whose subject is the discovery of the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;Noble, John et al.

[[File:Guadalupano.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Miguel Hidalgo]]'s 1810 [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|Guadalupan]] flag.]]
Both [[Miguel Hidalgo]] and [[Emiliano Zapata]] flew flags of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] as their protector, and Zapata's men wore the Guadalupan image around their necks and on their [[sombrero]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Secular ritual'' by Falk Moore, Sally and  Myerhoff, Barbara G., 1977 {{ISBN|90-232-1457-9}} p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brunk, Samuel. ''Emiliano Zapata'' 1995 {{ISBN|0-8263-1620-4}} p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 ceremony Pope [[John Paul II]] placed [[Mexico]] under the protection of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]].&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Edward R., ''The Roman Catholic Church: an illustrated history'' ISBN p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

The prayer, the ''[[Memorare]]'' begins: "Remember O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled to Thy protection, implored Thy help or sought Thy intercession, was left unaided."&lt;ref&gt;Foster, David. ''Catholic Prayerbook: From Downside Abbey'', (2001), {{ISBN|0-567-08669-0}} p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint [[Louis de Montfort]] taught that God appointed Mary as "the dispenser of grace", and to receive grace from God, one can receive it through the hands of the Blessed Virgin, as a child receives from a mother.&lt;ref name=Aumann /&gt; ''[[Lumen gentium]]'' states: "This, however, is to be so understood that it neither takes away from nor adds anything to the dignity and efficaciousness of Christ the one Mediator."&lt;ref name=ppvi/&gt;

===Development of Marian doctrines===
The theological development of devotion to Mary begins with [[Justin Martyr]] (100–165) who articulated Mary’s role in salvation history as the Second Eve.&lt;ref name=Ellington&gt;[http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/820 Spivey Ellington, Donna. review of ''Mother of God: A History of the Virgin Mary'', Reviews in History, (review no. 820)]&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed up by [[Irenæus]], whom [[Herbert Thurston]] calls "the first theologian of the Virgin Mother".&lt;ref name=Thurston/&gt;

The Church's magisterium has identified four teachings about Mary as dogmas of faith. These include belief in her [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virginal conception of Jesus]], taught by the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. The [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431 applied to her the description "[[Mother of God (Roman Catholic)|Mother of God]]", (''[[Theotokos]]''). The [[perpetual virginity of Mary]] was taught by the [[ecumenical council|ecumenical]] [[Second Council of Constantinople]] in 553, which described her as "ever virgin", and was expressed also, by the Lateran synod of October 649,&lt;ref&gt;Denzinger, [http://denzinger.patristica.net/#n200 256 (old numbering)], [http://catho.org/9.php?d=bxq 503 (new numbering)]&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine of the [[Immaculate Conception]] states that from the first moment of her existence Mary was without [[original sin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07674d.htm Holweck, Frederick. "Immaculate Conception." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 4 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This doctrine was proclaimed a dogma ''[[ex cathedra]]'' by Pope [[Pius IX]] in 1854. The dogma of the [[Assumption of Mary]], defined by Pope Pius XII in 1950, states that, at the end of her earthly life, she was assumed into [[heaven|heavenly glory]] body and soul.,&lt;ref&gt;

===Liturgical aspects===
In the first three centuries the emphasis was on the veneration of [[martyrs]], as a continuation of the yearly celebrations of their death, e.g. as noted in the early Christian text on the [[Martyrdom of Polycarp]].&lt;ref&gt;''A brief history of saints'' by Lawrence Cunningham 2005 {{ISBN|1-4051-1402-9}} pages 16–19&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Eastern traditions Mariology developed through liturgical veneration within the framework of the feasts relative to the Incarnation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=1407 Samaha, John M., "Mary in Byzantine Liturgy", ''The Homiletic &amp; Pastoral Review'', 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; In the early part of the 3rd century, [[Hippolytus of Rome]] recorded the first liturgical reference to the Virgin Mary, as part of the ordination rite of a bishop.{{sfn|McNally, pp.68-69}} Marian feasts appeared in the 4th century, and the feast of the "Memory of Mary, Mother of God" was celebrated on August 15 in Jerusalem by the year 350.{{sfn|McNally, pp.68-69}}&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Adam, ''Liturgie,'' 1985, p.291&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Catholic liturgy is one of the most important elements of [[Marian devotions]]. Many Marian feasts are superior to the feast days of the saints. The liturgical texts of the Marian feast days all link Mary to Jesus Christ.

==History==

===Early veneration===
[[File:Madonna catacomb.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Earliest fresco of the Virgin Mary, [[Catacomb of Priscilla]], 2nd century.&lt;ref name= Lossky &gt;Vladimir Lossky, 1982 ''The Meaning of Icons'' {{ISBN|978-0-913836-99-6}} page 173&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Mary, as the mother of Jesus, is documented in Roman [[catacombs]]: paintings from the first half of the 2nd century show her holding the [[Christ Child]].&lt;ref name=Thurston/&gt; Excavations in the crypt of [[St Peter's Basilica]] uncovered a very early fresco of Mary together with Saint Peter.&lt;ref&gt;M Guarducci Maria nelle epigrafi paleocristiane di Roma 1963, 248&lt;/ref&gt;
The Roman [[Priscilla catacomb]]s depict the oldest Marian paintings from the middle of the 2nd century:&lt;ref&gt;I Daoust, ''Marie dans les catacombes'', 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Mary is shown with [[Jesus]] on her lap, a standing man with tunic left hand a book right hand a star over his head symbol of messiahs. Priscilla also has a depiction of the [[annunciation]].&lt;ref name= Lossky /&gt;
The [[edict of Milan]] (AD 313) allowed Christians to worship openly. This new freedom also permitted literary development of the veneration of Mary, [[Hippolytus of Rome]] being an early example.{{sfn|McNally, pp.68-69}}&lt;ref name="umer1"&gt;Bäumer 520&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Ambrose]], who lived in Rome before going to Milan as its bishop, venerated Mary as an example of Christian life and is credited with starting a Marian cult of virginity in the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;''A new history of ecclesiastical writers, Volumes 1–2' by Louis Ellies Du Pin et al 2010 {{ISBN|1-171-18698-3}} page 212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--His house in Rome is said to have been first female convent ''[[Sant'Ambrogio della Massima]]''.&lt;ref name="umer1" /&gt; --&gt;

Marian veneration was theologically sanctioned with the adoption of the title ''[[Theotokos]]'' at the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431. The earliest known churches dedicated to Mary were built shortly after that date, among these the [[Church of the Seat of Mary]] (''Kathisma'') near [[Mar Elias Monastery]], between Jerusalem and Bethlehem.
The first [[Marian church]]es in Rome date from the 5th and 6th centuries: [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], [[Santa Maria Antiqua]] and [[Santa Maria Maggiore]].&lt;ref name=Thurston/&gt;
However, the very earliest church dedicated to the Virgin Mary still dates to the late 4th century in [[Syria]],{{dubious|date=April 2017}} where{{clarify|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--"it's in Syria"... a little more info please?--&gt; an inscription dedicating it to the [[Theotokos]] (Mother of God) was found among the ruins.&lt;ref&gt;''Butler's lives of the saints, Volume 1'' by Alban Butler, David Hugh Farmer, Paul Burns 2000 {{ISBN|0-86012-250-6}} p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth of Marian culture===
[[File:Piazza Esquilino, Santa Maria Maggiore.JPG|thumb|240px|[[Santa Maria Maggiore]], the first Marian church in [[Rome]], originally built between 430 and 440.&lt;ref&gt;''Rome'' by Yvonne Labande-Mailfert et al, 1961 ASIN: B0007E741C page 115&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the early Middle Ages, veneration of Mary was particularly expressed in monasteries, especially those of the [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictines]]. Chants such as [[Ave Maris Stella]] and the [[Salve Regina]] emerged and became staples of monastic plainsong.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, John L. "Early Medieval Painting in San Clemente, Rome: The Madonna and Child in the Niche" ''Gesta'' 20.2 (1981:299–310) and (note 9) referencing T. Klauser, Rom under der Kult des Gottesmutter Maria, ''Jahrbuch für der Antike und Christentum'' 15 (1972:120–135).&lt;/ref&gt; In the 8th century, [[Little Office of Our Lady|The Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary]] developed from the monks' practice of praying the [[Canonical hours]]. The Carolingians encouraged Marian piety by the celebration of Marian feast days and the dedication of churches in her honor.&lt;ref name=Ellington/&gt; Devotional practices grew in number.

The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] period saw the construction of major [[Roman Catholic Marian churches|Marian churches]], such as [[Speyer Cathedral]] (also known as the [[Mariendom]]) in [[Speyer]], Germany, and [[Our Lady of Flanders]] Cathedral in [[Tournai, Belgium]]. From the year 1000 onward more and more churches, including many of Europe's greatest cathedrals were dedicated to Mary. Gothic cathedrals, such as [[Notre Dame de Paris]] as well as [[Our Lady of Chartres]] near Paris, were major masterworks of the time. Construction of [[Santa Maria Assunta, Siena|Santa Maria Assunta]] Cathedral in [[Siena, Italy]] and [[Notre-Dame Cathedral, Luxembourg]] increased the number of [[Roman Catholic Marian churches|churches devoted to the Virgin Mary]].

The 12th and 13th centuries saw an extraordinary growth of the cult of the Virgin in Western Europe, inspired in part by the writings of theologians such as [[Bernard of Clairvaux]]. The movement found its grandest expression in the French cathedrals, often dedicated to “Our Lady", such as [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] and [[Notre-Dame de Bayeux]] among others.&lt;ref name=Heilbrunn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/virg/hd_virg.htm|title=The Cult of the Virgin Mary in the Middle Ages|author=Department of Medieval Art and The Cloisters|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Our Lady of Walsingham|Walsingham]] and other places of Marian pilgrimage developed large popular followings. At the height of the pilgrimage movement in the 11th and 12th centuries, hundreds of people were traveling almost constantly from one Marian shrine to the next.&lt;ref&gt;''Renaissance and Reformation'' by William Roscoe Estep 1986 {{ISBN|0-8028-0050-5}}, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 14th century, Mary had become greatly popular as a compassionate intercessor and protector of humanity, and during the great plagues (such as the [[Black Death]]) her help was sought against the just judgment of God.&lt;ref&gt;''Daily life during the Black Death'' by Joseph Patrick Byrne 2006 {{ISBN|0-313-33297-5}}, page 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Renaissance]] witnessed a dramatic growth in venerative Marian art.&lt;ref&gt;''Mary in Western art'' by Timothy Verdon, Filippo Rossi 2005 {{ISBN|0-9712981-9-X}}, page 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 16th century, the [[Protestant Reformation]] had introduced a tide against Marian venerations in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''Renaissance and Reformation'' by William Roscoe Estep 1986 {{ISBN|0-8028-0050-5}} pages 140–144&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the same time new Marian devotions were starting in Latin America based on Saint [[Juan Diego]]'s 1531 reported vision of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]]. The ensuing Marian pilgrimages have continued to date and the Marian Basilica on [[Tepeyac Hill]] remains the most visited Catholic shrine in the world.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/ZSHRINE.HTM | publisher = ZENIT International News Agency | accessdate = October 1, 2010 | title = Shrine of Gualdalupe Most Popular in World}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th and 18th centuries writings by the saints, coupled with papal encouragements, increased the growth of Marian devotions, and gave rise to the definition and declaration of new Marian doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;''The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3'' by Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley 2003 {{ISBN|90-04-12654-6}} pages 406–409&lt;/ref&gt;

Marian culture continues to develop within the Catholic Church. In 1974, after 4 years of preparation, [[Pope Paul VI]] issued the Apostolic Letter ''[[Marialis Cultus]]''. In this document, (which was subtitled ''For the Right Ordering and Development of Devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary'') Paul VI not only discussed the history of Marian devotions but also overviewed their rationale and provided suggestions for their future direction, emphasising their theological and pastoral value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_p-vi_exh_19740202_marialis-cultus_en.html | title = Marialis Cultus at the Vatican website | publisher = Vatican.va | accessdate = November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/resources/documents/MC.html | title = University of Dayton | publisher = Campus.udayton.edu | accessdate = November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catholic saints and veneration of Mary==
{{Main|Mariology of the saints}}

Roman Catholic devotions have relied on the writings of numerous saints throughout history who have attested to the central role of Mary in God's plan of salvation.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Alban ''Lives of the saints, Volume 1'' 2007 {{ISBN|1-60506-312-6}} p. 429&lt;/ref&gt;

Early saints included [[Irenaeus of Lyons]] in the 2nd century who was perhaps the earliest of the Church Fathers to write systematically about the Virgin Mary, and he set out a forthright account of her role in the economy of salvation.&lt;ref&gt;Osborn, Eric Francis. ''Irenaeus of Lyons'' 2001 {{ISBN|0-521-80006-4}} p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''De Carne Christi'' 17&lt;/ref&gt;[[Ambrose of Milan]] (339–397) based the veneration of Mary not only on her virginity but also on her extraordinary courage.&lt;ref&gt;Neumann, Charles William. ''The Virgin Mary in the works of Saint Ambrose'', 1962 ASIN: B0007J9CX0 p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, [[CSEL]] 32, 505, and De inst. Virginum 49&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle Ages, [[Bernhard of Clairvaux]] highlighted her virginity and humility as the basis for her veneration.&lt;ref&gt;Schäfer, Peter. ''Mirror of His beauty'', 2002 {{ISBN|0-691-09068-8}} p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmaus, Michael. ''Mariologie, Katholische Dogmatik'', München Vol V, 1955207 p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; A particularly significant contribution to Mariology came from John [[Duns Scotus]] who in the 13th century defended the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.&lt;ref&gt;Wolter, Allan B. and O'Neill, Blane. ''John Duns Scotus: Mary's Architect'', Franciscan Press, Illinois, 1983, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Scotus identified the key theological foundations which led to the declaration of the dogma of Immaculate Conception centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/2002/february/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20020216_frati-minori_en.html | title = Address of John Paul II to the Members of the Scotus Commission | publisher = Vatican.va | date = February 16, 2002 | accessdate = November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, Saint [[Ignatius of Loyola]] instructed the Jesuits to preserve ''[[Madonna della Strada]]'', which was later enshrined in the [[Church of the Gesu]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americamagazine.org/content/culture.cfm?cultureid=83 Waldrop, Gregory. "Object of Devotion: The story of a dramatic restoration". ''America'', October 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Filippo Neri]], a contemporary of Ignatius, is credited with the innovation of daily Marian devotions during the [[May devotions to the Blessed Virgin Mary|month of May]].&lt;ref&gt;Venturoli, A., ''S. Filippo Neri'', Roma, 1988, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

In his classic book ''[[The Glories of Mary]]'', [[Alphonsus Liguori]] explained how God gave Mary to mankind as the "Gate of Heaven", quoting [[Saint Bonaventure]], "No one can enter Heaven unless by Mary, as though through a door."&lt;ref&gt;Liguori, Alphonsus. ''The Glories of Mary'', Liguori Publications, 1868, {{ISBN|0-7648-0664-5}} p. 623&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis de Montfort]]'s book ''[[True Devotion to Mary]]'' synthesized many of the writings of earlier saints. His approach of "total consecration to Jesus Christ through Mary" had a strong impact on Marian devotion both in popular piety and in the spirituality of [[religious institute]]s.

The earliest Christian feasts that relate to Mary grew out of the cycle of feasts that celebrated the [[Nativity of Jesus]]. By the 7th century a feast dedicated to Mary was celebrated just before Christmas in the churches of [[Milan]] and [[Ravenna]] in Italy.&lt;ref name =MaryClayton&gt;''The Cult of the Virgin Mary in Anglo-Saxon England'' by Mary Clayton 2003 {{ISBN|0-521-53115-2}} pages 26–37&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the number of feasts (and the associated [[titles of Mary]]) and the venerative practices that accompany them increased and today the [[Catholic Church]] has more Marian feasts, titles, and venerative practices than any other Christian body.&lt;ref name="FrankFlinn" /&gt; Marian feasts have continued to be developed in the Catholic Church, e.g. the feast of the [[Queenship of Mary]] was declared in the 1954 in the papal encyclical ''[[Ad Caeli Reginam]]'' by pope [[Pius XII]].&lt;ref name="AdCaeli"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_11101954_ad-caeli-reginam_en.html | work = Ad Caeli Reginam | publisher = Vatican | accessdate = October 4, 2010 | title = Encyclical of Pope Pius XII on Proclaiming the Queenship of Mary|author=Pope Pius XII}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|date=8 November 1954|title=Religion: The Queenship of Mary|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,857668,00.html|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|doi=|pmid=|access-date=6 June 2016|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the month of May, [[May devotions to the Blessed Virgin Mary]] take place in many Catholic regions. These may include the singing of Marian anthems, crowning of statues of Mary with floral wreaths, readings from [[scripture]]s, a [[sermon]], and or presentation by local choirs.&lt;ref&gt;''Maiden and Mother: Prayers, Hymns, Devotions, and Songs to the Beloved Beloved Virgin Mary Throughout the Year'' by M.

A large number of titles to honor Mary or ask for her intercession are used by Roman Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Catholicism by Frank K. Flinn'', J. Gordon Melton 2007 {{ISBN|0-8160-5455-X}} pages 443–444&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Mater Dei'' (i.e. "Mother of God" as confirmed by the [[First Council of Ephesus]], 431) is common in Latin, a large number of other titles have been used by Roman Catholics – far more than any other Christians.&lt;ref name=FrankFlinn /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.x.xvi.i.html | title = The Canons of the Two Hundred Holy and Blessed Fathers Who Met at Ephesus | publisher = Ccel.org | date = June 1, 2005 | accessdate = November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Christian theology reader'' by Alister E. McGrath 2006 {{ISBN|1-4051-5358-X}} page 273&lt;/ref&gt;

Titles used to refer to the Virgin Mary throughout history, at times reflect the changing attitudes towards her. ''[[Dominus (title)|Domina]]'' (lady), ''Regina'' (queen) and ''[[Our Lady, Star of the Sea|Stella Maris]]'' (star of the sea) are some of the early titles of Mary, of which Regina is the earliest. ''Domina'' and ''Sella Maris'' are found in [[Jerome]] who perhaps originated the [[etymology]] of Mary as ''Stella Maris'' in the 5th century. While the early emphasis in Stella Maris was on Mary as the Star that bore Christ, by the 9th century, the attention had focused on Mary herself, as indicated in the hymn [[Ave Maris Stella]]. By the 11th century, Mary herself had emerged as the star that acted as a guiding light.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cult of the Virgin Mary in Anglo-Saxon England'' by Mary Clayton 2003 {{ISBN|0-521-53115-2}} pages 249–252&lt;/ref&gt; By the 13th century, as [[Mariology]] was growing, Saint [[Anthony of Padua]] had composed [[Mary Our Queen]].&lt;ref&gt;''The greatest Marian prayers: their history, meaning, and usage'' by Anthony M.

===Antiphons===
The [[Liturgy of the Hours]] includes several offices to be sung, including [[Compline]]. At the close of this office, one of four ''[[Marian antiphon]]s'' is sung. These songs, ''[[Alma redemptoris mater]], ''[[Ave Regina caelorum]]'', ''[[Regina caeli]]'', and ''[[Salve Regina]]'', have been described as "among the most beautiful creations of the late Middle Ages".&lt;ref&gt;Willi Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' 1958 {{ISBN|0-253-20601-4}} p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Music In Western Civilisation'' by Craig M. Wright, Bryan R. Simm 2005 {{ISBN|0-495-00867-2}} page 137&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest Marian compositions is the popular [[Salve Regina]] in [[Latin]] from a Benedictine monk, which exists in several Gregorian versions. [[Hermann of Reichenau]] (July 18, 1013 – September 24, 1054), composed the [[Alma redemptoris mater]] and hymns to Mary became part of daily life at monasteries such as the [[Benedictine]] [[Abbey of Cluny]] in France.&lt;ref name=ChristianRaab&gt;:''The Tradition of Catholic Prayer'' by Christian Raab, Harry Hagan 2007 {{ISBN|0-8146-3184-3}} page 234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=AgaDx-NSiMYC&amp;pg=RA4-PA472&amp;dq=Alma+Redemptoris+Mater#v=onepage&amp;q=Alma%20Redemptoris%20Mater&amp;f=false | title = Handbook of Prayers | author = James Socías | year = 2006 |isbn = 978-0-87973-579-1 | page = 472 | publisher = | accessdate = November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the date of the composition of [[Ave Regina Coelorum]] is uncertain, conjecture that it antedates the fourth century seems to be without any warrant of external or internal evidence. It is found in the St. Alban's Book of the twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02149b.htm Henry, Hugh. "Ave Regina." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 2.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[Little Office of Our Lady|Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary]]'' probably originated as a [[monastic]] devotion around the middle of the eighth century.&lt;ref name=toke&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09294a.htm Toke, Leslie. "Little Office of Our Lady." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 1 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It is a variation of the Common of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] (Divine Office). It may have originally been put together to be prayed in connection with the Votive Masses of Our Lady on Saturday, which were written by [[Alcuin]], the liturgical master of Charlemagne’s court.&lt;ref name=dayton&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.udayton.edu/imri/mary/l/little-office-what-is.php|title=Little Office, What is : University of Dayton, Ohio|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Little Office did not come into general use before the tenth century.

During the 11th century, as the number of monasteries grew, so did Marian prayers. There is little or no trace of the [[Hail Mary]] as an accepted devotional formula before about 1050. All the evidence suggests that it took its rise from certain versicles and responsories occurring in the Little Office or Cursus of the Blessed Virgin which just at that time was coming into favour among the monastic orders. Two Anglo-Saxon manuscripts at the British Museum, one of which may be as old as the year 1030, show that the words "Ave Maria" etc. and "benedicta tu in mulieribus et benedictus fructus ventris tui" occurred in almost every part of the Cursus, and though it is not clear that these clauses were at first joined together so as to make one prayer, there is conclusive evidence that this had come to pass only a very little later.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, Herbert. "The Hail Mary" ''The Month'', Nov., 1901, pp. 486-8&lt;/ref&gt; As regards the addition of the word "Jesus," it is commonly said that this was due to the initiative of Pope Urban IV (1261) although the evidence does not seem sufficiently clear to warrant positive statement on the point.&lt;ref name=Thurston/&gt; This was the prayer as known to [[Thomas Aquinas]] when he gave a Lenten sermon on the "Salutation of the Blessed Virgin" in 1273.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas. ''The Three Greatest Prayers'', (Laurence Shapcote, trans.) Burns, Oates &amp; Washburn, Ltd. (London 1937)&lt;/ref&gt; By the fourteenth century it was not uncommon to conclude with an appeal for sinners and especially for help at the hour of death. Official recognition of the Ave Maria in its complete form was finally given in the Roman Breviary of 1568.&lt;ref name=Thurston/&gt;
 
[[File:Jean-François Millet Angelus.jpg|thumb|"The Angelus", Jean-François Millet]]
[[Three Hail Marys]] is a traditional Roman Catholic devotional practice of reciting three Hail Marys as a petition for purity and other virtues. The practice of saying three Hail Marys in the evening somewhere about sunset had become general throughout Europe in the first half of the fourteenth century and it was recommended by [[Pope John XXII]] in 1318. The practice was observed by [[Franciscan]]s and eventually developed into the [[Angelus]] prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01486b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Angelus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Angelus is a prayer commemorating the Incarnation. It originated with the 11th-century monastic custom of reciting three Hail Marys during the evening, or Compline bell. It was traditionally recited in Roman Catholic churches, convents, and monasteries three times daily: 6:00 am, noon, and 6:00 pm and is usually accompanied by the ringing of the Angelus bell, which is a call to prayer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01486b.htm Thurston, Herbert. "Angelus." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 13 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12th century [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] gave sermons (De duodecim stellis), from which an extract has been taken by the Roman Catholic Church and used in the ''Offices of the Compassion'' and of the ''Seven Dolours''. Saint Bernard wrote: "Take away Mary, this star of the sea, the sea truly great and wide: what is left but enveloping darkness and the shadow of death and the densest blackness?"&lt;ref name=ChristianRaab /&gt; There are pious meditations on the ''[[Hail Mary|Ave Maria]]'' and the ''[[Salve Regina]]'', usually attributed either to [[Anselm of Lucca|St. Anselm of Lucca]] (d. 1080) or [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard]]; and also in the large book "De laudibus B. Mariae Virginis" (Douai, 1625) by Richard de Saint-Laurent.

Other famous Marian prayers include the [[Magnificat]], and the [[Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary]].

The mostly anonymous Middle English Lyrics of the Later Middle Ages show passionate forms of personal worship, known as affective devotion. The lyrics, reflecting the theology, depict Mary as not just the woman but also the ideal that all humanity should strive for.

Mary’s humility is one of the qualities highlighted by in the Middle English Lyrics. 
The lyric “Gabriel, from hevenë king/ sent to the maidë swetë” is an excellent example of Mary’s humility. The lyric’s author builds upon this theme throughout the lyric. The second stanza “Mildëliche him gan answere/ The midlë maiden thannë." The theme of humity is fully developed in the third stanza;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

When the maiden understood/
And th’angles wordës herdë,/
Mildëliche with mildë mod/
To th’angel she answerdë:/
‘Our Lordës thew-maiden i-wis/
Ich am, that her-aboven is./
Anentës me/
Fulforthëd be/
Thy, sawë;/
That Ich, sithe His wil is,/
Maiden, withouten lawë,/

[[File:Rosary&amp;scapular.jpg|thumb|[[Rosary and scapular]]]]

The term "[[wikt:devotion|devotion]]s" is commonly understood to refer to those external practices of piety by which the faith of an individual finds expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20020513_vers-direttorio_en.html|title=Directory on popular piety and the liturgy. Principles and guidelines|publisher=Congregation for Divine Worship|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such prayers or acts may be accompanied by specific requests for Mary's [[Intercession of saints|intercession]] with [[God in Christianity|God]].&lt;ref&gt;Marmion, Columba. ''Christ, the Ideal of the Priest'', 2006 {{ISBN|0-85244-657-8}} p. 332&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Burke667 &gt;Burke, Raymond L.; et al. (2008). Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, Seminarians, and Consecrated Persons {{ISBN|978-1-57918-355-4}} pages 667-679&lt;/ref&gt; Devotion to the Virgin Mary does not, however, amount to worship - which is reserved for God.

A wide range of [[Marian devotion]]s are followed by Catholics ranging from simple [[Rosary]] recitations to formalized, multi-day Novenas to activities which do not involve any prayers, such the wearing of scapulars or maintaining a [[Mary garden]].&lt;ref&gt;Ann Ball, 2003 ''Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices'' {{ISBN|0-87973-910-X}} pages 11 and 341&lt;/ref&gt; Two well known Marian devotions are the Rosary recitation and the wearing of the Brown Scapular. Following their joint growth in the 18th and 19th centuries, by the early 20th century the [[Rosary]] and the devotional [[Scapular]] had gained such a strong following among Catholics worldwide that the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] of 1914 stated: "''Like the Rosary, the Brown Scapular has become the badge of the devout Catholic''."&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Scapular}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his encyclical ''[[Rosarium Virginis Mariae]]'' [[Pope John Paul II]] emphasized the importance of the Rosary. The [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Mariological]] basis of the Scapular devotion is effectively the same as Marian consecration, as discussed in the dogmatic constitution ''[[Lumen gentium]]'' of the [[Second Vatican Council]], namely the role of the Virgin Mary as "''the mother to us in the order of grace''" which allows her to intercede for "''the gift of eternal salvation''".&lt;ref name="vatican.va"&gt;Vatican website: ''[[Lumen gentium]]'' No 61 and No 62 [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The same Council decree clarified that the many ways in which Mary can encourage and assist us "neither takes away from nor adds anything to the dignity and efficaciousness of Christ the one Mediator."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lumen gentium]]'' 62&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman Catholic]] tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as ''[[Acts of Reparation to the Virgin Mary]]'' for insults that she suffers. The [[Raccolta]] Roman Catholic prayer book (approved by a Decree of 1854, and published by the [[Holy See]] in 1898) includes a number of such prayers. These prayers do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to ''[[Acts of reparation|repair the sins]] of others'' against the Virgin Mary.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Ball, 2003 ''Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices ''{{ISBN|0-87973-910-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Raccolta}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph P.

===Consecration and entrustment to Mary===
{{Main|Consecration and entrustment to Mary}}
For centuries, Marian devotions among Roman Catholics have included many examples of personal or collective acts of [[consecration]] and entrustment to the Virgin Mary; the Latin terms ''oblatio'', ''servitus'', ''commendatio'', and ''dedicatio'' were used in this context.&lt;ref name="VaticanEntrust"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20020513_vers-direttorio_en.html#Chapter%20Five | title = Veneration of the Holy Mother of God, item 204 | accessdate = November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Consecration and entrustment to Mary|Consecration]] is an act by which a person is dedicated to a sacred service, or an act which separates an object, location or region from a common and profane mode to one for sacred use.&lt;ref name="CathEncyConsecration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04276a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Consecration|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Murphy96 &gt;''Mary's Immaculate Heart'' by John F. Murphy 2007 {{ISBN|1-4067-3409-8}} pages 96–103&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church makes it clear that "...the faithful should be carefully instructed about the practice of consecration to the Blessed Virgin Mary...it is, in reality, only analogously a 'consecration to God,' and should be expressed in a correct liturgical manner: to the Father, through Christ in the Holy Spirit, imploring the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, to whom we entrust ourselves completely, so as to keep our baptismal commitments and live as her children."&lt;ref name="VaticanEntrust" /&gt;

Individuals declaring their "entrustment" to Mary seek her intercession before God through her son Jesus Christ, for she herself has no divine power.&lt;ref name="CathEncyConsecration" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Murphy96"/&gt; In Catholic teachings, consecration to Mary does not diminish or substitute the love of God, but enhances it, for all consecration is ultimately made to God.&lt;ref name="CatholicismAnswerTrigilioBrighenti"&gt;''The Catholicism Answer Book'' by John Trigilio, Kenneth Brighenti 2007 {{ISBN|1-4022-0806-5}} page 325&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, [[John Paul II|Pope John Paul II]] clarified consecration to Mary in his 1987 encyclical, ''Redemptoris mater'', in which he stated, "Mary's motherhood...is a gift which Christ himself makes personally to every individual."&lt;ref name="RedMater" /&gt;

==Catholic view of Marian apparitions==
{{Main|Marian apparitions}}

Many ''[[Marian apparition]]'' have been reported by believers, including [[Our Lady of Lourdes]], [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], and [[Our Lady of Fatima]].&lt;ref name=Freze &gt;Michael Freze, 1993, ''Voices, Visions, and Apparitions'', OSV Publishing {{ISBN|0-87973-454-X}} pages 257–265&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Short Biography of Padre Pio http://www.padrepiodevotions.org/index.asp?pagename=biography {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012172959/http://www.padrepiodevotions.org/index.asp?pagename=biography |date=October 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The book ''Mother Maria Pierina'' by Maria Rigamonti http://www.cenacle.co.uk/products.asp?partno=B0532&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases (e.g. Saint [[Padre Pio]] or Sister [[Maria Pierina|Maria Pierina De Micheli]]) these have involved [[visions of Jesus and Mary]] and sometimes include a spoken element.

The official position of the [[Holy See]] is that while the [[Holy Office]] has approved a few apparitions of the Virgin Mary, Roman Catholics at large are not required to believe them. However, many Catholics express belief in Marian apparitions.&lt;ref&gt;''Habits of Devotion'' by James M. O'Toole 2005 {{ISBN|0-8014-7255-5}} page 121&lt;/ref&gt; This has included popes, e.g. four popes, i.e. [[Pope Pius XII]], [[Pope John XXIII]], [[Pope Paul VI]], and [[Pope John Paul II]] have supported the [[Our Lady of Fátima]] messages as supernatural.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} [[Pope John Paul II]] was particularly attached to Fátima and credited Our Lady of Fátima with saving his life after he was shot in Rome on the Feast Day of Our Lady of Fátima in May 1981. He donated the bullet that wounded him on that day to the Roman Catholic sanctuary at [[Fátima, Portugal|Fátima]] [[Portugal]].&lt;ref name=Freze /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNally, Terrence, ''What Every Catholic Should Know about Mary'' {{ISBN|1-4415-1051-6}} page 166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Reuters | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/16/world/pope-donates-bullet-to-fatima-sanctuary.html | title = NY Times |location=Czestochowa (Poland); Fatima (Portugal) | publisher = NY Times | date = May 16, 1984 | accessdate = November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a historical pattern, Vatican approval seems to have followed general acceptance of a vision by well over a century in most cases. According to Father Salvatore M. Perrella of the [[Marianum|Mariunum Pontifical Institute]] in Rome, of the 295 reported apparitions studied by the [[Holy See]] through the centuries only 12 have been approved, the latest being in May 2008.&lt;ref name="catholicnewsagency1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="catholicnewsagency2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vatican News on [[Benoite Rencurel]] http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/avantgo/new.php?n=12546 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212214242/http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/avantgo/new.php?n=12546 |date=December 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catholic News on [[Benoite Rencurel]] http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=27848 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513224745/http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=27848 |date=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veneration through Marian art==

{{Main|Marian art in the Catholic Church}}

[[File:Geertgen tot Sint Jans - The Glorification of the Virgin - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Glorification of the Virgin]]'' ({{circa}} 1490–1495) by [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]]]]

The tradition of honoring Mary by venerating images of her goes back to 3rd-century Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic Customs and Traditions: A Popular Guide'' by Greg Dues 1993 {{ISBN|0-89622-515-1}} page 126 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ajZ_aR-VXn8C&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=catholic+venerate+image+mary&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3VagTIrnDsqNjAf4nYjDBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the period of [[iconoclasm]], the position of the Church with respect to the veneration of images was formalized at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787. A summary of the doctrine is included in the current ''Catechism of the Catholic Church''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Christian veneration of images is not contrary to the first commandment which proscribes idols. Indeed, "the honour rendered to an image passes to its prototype," and "whoever venerates an image venerates the person portrayed in it." The honour paid to sacred images is a "respectful veneration," not the adoration due to God alone: Religious worship is not directed to images in themselves, considered as mere things, but under their distinctive aspect as images leading us on to God Incarnate. The movement toward the image does not terminate in it as image, but tends towards that whose image it is.&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|2132}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No other image (in either the [[Western Church|Western]] or the [[Eastern Church]]) permeates Christian art as much as the image of Madonna and Child.&lt;ref&gt;''The Celebration of Faith: The Virgin Mary'' by Alexander Schmemann 2001 {{ISBN|0-88141-141-8}} page 11 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Sls53hUSodgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ISBN+0881411418&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4j6jTOC3EIOA4QaZrLzbAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The images of the Virgin Mary have become central [[icon]]s of [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[Christianity]] where Mary remains a central artistic topic.&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster's encyclopedia of world religions'' by Wendy Doniger, 1999 {{ISBN|0-87779-044-2}} page 696&lt;/ref&gt; Byzantine images of the ''Theotokos'' were adopted in the West, where Byzantine models became widely distributed in by the 7th century. The Virgin Mary has been one of the major subjects of [[Christian Art]], [[Art in Roman Catholicism|Catholic Art]] and [[Western Art]] since [[Early Christian art]] and she has been very widely portrayed in iconic "portraits", often known as [[Madonna (art)|Madonnas]], with the infant Jesus in the ''[[Madonna and Child]]'', and in a number of narrative scenes from her life known as the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'', as well as scenes illustrating particular doctrines or beliefs: from masters such as [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] and [[Botticelli]] to [[folk art]].&lt;ref&gt;''Grieving with Mary: Finding Comfort and Healing in Devotion to the Mother of God'' by Mary K. Doyle 2009 {{ISBN|0-87946-397-X}} page 42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mary in Western art'' by Timothy Verdon, Filippo Rossi 2005 {{ISBN|0-9712981-9-X}} page 11&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman Catholic Marian art|Marian art]] enjoys a significant level of diversity, e.g. with distinct styles of statues of the Virgin Mary present on different continents (as depicted in the galleries in [[Roman Catholic Marian art]]). These depictions are not restricted to European art, and also appear in South American paintings.&lt;ref&gt;''The Virgin, saints, and angels: South American paintings 1600–1825'' by Suzanne L. Stratton-Pruitt 2006 {{ISBN|88-7624-613-4}} pages 34&lt;/ref&gt; The South American tradition of Marian veneration through art dates back to the 16th century, with the [[Virgin of Copacabana]] gaining fame in 1582.&lt;ref&gt;Donahue-Wallace, Kelly (2008).

Black, Pamela Gravestock 2006 {{ISBN|0-7546-5174-6}} page 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14120a.htm | title = Catholic encyclopedia | publisher = Newadvent.org | accessdate = November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the 16th century, the [[Holy See]] endorsed the [[Sodality of Our Lady]] and [[Pope Gregory XIII]] issued a [[Papal Bull]] commending it and granting it [[indulgences]] and establishing it as the ''mother sodality'', and other sodalities were formed thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sodality of Our Lady: historical sketches'' by P.J.

The 18th and 19th centuries saw a number of missionary Marian organizations such as [[Company of Mary]], the [[Marianists]], the [[Marist Fathers]], and the [[Marist Brothers]]. Some of these missionaries, e.g. Saint [[Peter Chanel]], were martyred as they travelled to new lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11769a.htm | title = Catholic encyclopedia | publisher = Newadvent.org | date = February 1, 1911 | accessdate = November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09749d.htm | title = Catholic encyclopedia | publisher = Newadvent.org | date = October 1, 1910 | accessdate = November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 20th century witnessed the formation of Marian organizations with millions of members, e.g. the [[Legion of Mary]] and [[Blue Army of Our Lady of Fatima]].&lt;ref&gt;Joan Carroll Cruz, ''Saintly Men of Modern Times'' (2003) {{ISBN|1-931709-77-7}} pages 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas McGonigle, 1996, ''A History of the Christian Tradition'' Paulist Press {{ISBN|978-0-8091-3648-3}} page 222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A pilgrim's handbook to Fatima'' by Leo Madigan 2001 {{ISBN|0-85244-532-6}} page 207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic Dictionary'' by Peter M.

In the [[Roman Catholic]] Church a [[shrine]] is a church or sacred place
which receives many faithful pilgrims for a specific pious reason. The local [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] must approve the shrine.&lt;ref&gt;''New commentary on the Code of Canon Law'' by John P. Beal, James A. Coriden, Thomas J. Green 2002 {{ISBN|0-8091-4066-7}} page 1437 (Canon 1230)&lt;/ref&gt;

Marian shrines account for major veneration centers and pilgrimage sites for Roman Catholics. According to Bishop Francesco Giogia, at the end of the 20th century, the most visited Catholic shrine in the world was that of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] in Mexico City. In third place was [[Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida|Our Lady of Aparecida]] in Brazil, with the non-Marian shrine of [[San Giovanni Rotondo]] in second place.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; The visual effect of Marian pilgrimages can be dramatic, e.g. on May 13 and October 13 of each year close to one million Catholic pilgrims walk the country road that leads to the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima]].&lt;ref&gt;Trudy Ring, 1996, ''International Dictionary of Historic Places'', {{ISBN|978-1-884964-02-2}} page 245&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2 million pilgrim journey up [[Tepeyac hill]] on December 12 each year to visit the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe]].&lt;ref&gt;''Pilgrimage: from the Ganges to Graceland : an encyclopedia, Volume 1'' by Linda Kay Davidson, David Martin Gitlitz 2002 {{ISBN|1-57607-004-2}} page 213&lt;/ref&gt; While in 1968 Aparecida had about four million pilgrims,&lt;ref&gt;''Brazil rediscovered'' by Roberta C.

There are other Marian pilgrimage sites such as [[Medjugorje]], which is not considered a shrine by the [[Holy See]], but yet receives a large number of pilgrims every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/medjugorje.htm | publisher = EWTN | accessdate = October 1, 2010 | title = Medjugorje}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of pilgrims who visit some of the approved shrines every year can be significant. E.g. [[Lourdes]] with a population of around 15,000 people, receives about 5,000,000 pilgrims every year.&lt;ref&gt;''Sacred worlds: an introduction to geography and religion'' by Chris C. Park 1994 {{ISBN|0-415-09012-1}} page 283&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 a French priest, [[Julien Gouyet]], led by the [[visions of Jesus and Mary]] of the [[Beatification|Blessed]] [[Anne Catherine Emmerich]] ([[Klemens Brentano]], 1852) discovered the [[House of the Virgin Mary]] near [[Ephesus]] in [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Ancient Traditions of the Virgin Mary's Dormition and Assumption'' by Stephen J.

A number of countries, cities, and professions consider the Blessed Virgin their [[patron saint]]. For a list, see [[Patronage of the Blessed Virgin Mary]].

==Cultural adaptations==
Echoing the Byzantine depiction of [[Christ Pantocrator]], the Eastern Church portrayed Mary as the regal Queen of Heaven. As this theme spread to the West, prayers such as the ''[[Regina Coeli]]'',&lt;ref name=MMiles /&gt; ''[[Ave Regina Caelorum]]'', and ''[[Salve Regina]]'' were composed.

An example of the cultural adaptation of perspective include the view of the Virgin Mary as a mother with humility (rather than a heavenly queen) as the Franciscans began to preach in China, and its similarity to the local Chinese motherly and merciful figure of [[Kuanyin]], which was much admired in south China.&lt;ref&gt;Lauren Arnold, 1999 ''Princely Gifts &amp; Papal Treasures: The Franciscan Mission to China'' by {{ISBN|0-9670628-0-2}} page 151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lauren Arnold in ''Atlantic Monthly'', September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The great encounter of China and the West'' by David E. Mungello 1999 {{ISBN|0-8476-9439-9}} page 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A history of ideas and images in Italian art'' by James Hall 1983 {{ISBN|0-06-433317-5}} page 223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Iconography of Christian Art'' by Gertrud Schiller 1971 ASIN: B0023VMZMA page 112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Renaissance art: a topical dictionary'' by Irene Earls 1987 {{ISBN|0-313-24658-0}} page 174&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the Saint [[Juan Diego]]'s account of the appearance of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] in 1531 as a tanned [[Aztec]] princess who spoke in his local [[Nahuatl]] language. The clothing of the Virgin of Guadalupe image has been identified{{by whom|date=April 2015}} as that of an Aztec princess.&lt;ref&gt;''Mujer del maiz'' by Angel Vigil 1994 {{ISBN|1-56308-194-6}} pages 16–19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Somervill &gt;''Empire of the Aztecs'' by Barbara A.

However, the Vatican has generally been reluctant to approve of modern miracles, unless they have been subject to extensive analysis and scrutiny.

is the belief that an [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] (or "deep-seated") negative response to some thing, idea, or practice should be interpreted as [[evidence]] for the [[intrinsic]]ally harmful or [[evil]] character of that thing. Furthermore, it refers to the notion that [[wisdom]] may manifest itself in feelings of [[disgust]] towards anything which lacks [[Goodness and value theory|goodness]] or wisdom, though the feelings or the reasoning of such 'wisdom' may not be immediately explicable through [[reason]].

==Origin and usage==
The term "wisdom of repugnance" was coined in 1997 by [[Leon Kass]], chairman (2001–2005) of the [[President's Council on Bioethics]], in an article in ''[[The New Republic]]'',&lt;ref name="Kass 1997"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Kass, Leon R.|title=The Wisdom of Repugnance|work=[[The New Republic]]|volume=216|issue=22 |date=June 2, 1997 |pages=17&amp;ndash;26|publisher=[[CanWest]]|location=[[Washington, DC]]|authorlink=Leon Kass}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later expanded into a further (2001) article in the same magazine,&lt;ref name="Kass 2001"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kass|first=Leon R|title=Preventing a Brave New World: Why We Should Ban Human Cloning Now|work=The New Republic|date=May 21, 2001|volume=224|issue=21|pages=30&amp;ndash;39}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also incorporated into his 2002 book ''Life, Liberty, and the Defense of Dignity''.&lt;ref name="Kass 2002"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kass|first=Leon R.|title=Life, Liberty, and the Defense of Dignity|year=2002|publisher=Encounter Books|isbn=1-893554-55-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kass stated that disgust was not an argument ''per se'', but went on to say that "in crucial cases... repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate."

The term remains largely confined to discussions of [[bioethics]], and is somewhat related to the term "yuck factor". However, unlike the latter, it is used almost exclusively by those who accept its underlying premise; i.e., that repugnance does, in fact, indicate wisdom. It is thus often viewed as [[loaded language]], and is primarily used by certain [[Techno-progressivism#Contrasting stance|bioconservatives]] to justify their position.

The term has since migrated to other controversies, such as [[same-sex marriage]]{{Example needed}}, [[pornography]]{{Example needed}}, [[marijuana legalization]]{{Example needed}}, [[alternative sexuality|alternative sexualities]]{{Example needed}} and, in some cases, legalization of early [[abortion]]{{Example needed}}. In all cases, it expresses the view that one's "[[Feeling#Stomach feeling|gut reaction]]" might justify objecting to some practice even in the absence of a persuasive rational case against that practice.

==Criticism==
The wisdom of repugnance has been criticized, both as an example of a [[Fallacy|fallacious]] [[appeal to emotion]] and for an underlying premise which seems to reject [[rationalism]]. Although mainstream science concedes that a sense of [[disgust]] most likely [[Evolution|evolved]] as a useful [[defence mechanisms|defense mechanism]] (e.g. in that it tends to prevent or prohibit potentially harmful behaviour such as [[inbreeding]], [[cannibalism]], and [[coprophagia]]), social psychologists question whether the instinct can serve any moral or logical value when removed from the context in which it was originally acquired.

[[Martha Nussbaum]] explicitly opposes the concept of a disgust-based [[morality]]. Nussbaum notes that disgust has been used throughout history as a justification for [[persecution]]. For example, at various times [[racism]], [[antisemitism]], [[sexism]], and [[homophobia]] have all been driven by popular repulsion.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum 2004"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Nussbaum, Martha C.|url= http://chronicle.com/free/v50/i48/48b00601.htm |title=Danger to Human Dignity: The Revival of Disgust and Shame in the Law|work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=August 6, 2004|accessdate=2007-11-24|location=Washington, DC|authorlink= Martha Nussbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] has remarked that "our prejudices often overwhelm our limited information. &amp;#91;They&amp;#93; are so venerable, so reflexive, so much a part of our second nature, that we never stop to recognize their status as social decisions with radical alternatives&amp;mdash;and we view them instead as given and obvious truths."&lt;ref name="Gould 1997"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Gould, Stephen Jay|year=1997|title=[[Full House: The Spread of Excellence From Plato to Darwin]]|publisher=Harmony|isbn=0-517-70849-3|authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British bioethicist [[John Harris (bioethicist)|John Harris]] replied to Kass's view by arguing that, "there is no necessary connection between phenomena, attitudes, or actions that make us uneasy, or even those that disgust us, and those phenomena, attitudes, and actions that there are good reasons for judging unethical. Nor does it follow that those things we are confident are unethical must be prohibited by legislation or regulation."&lt;ref name="Harris 1998"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Harris, John|title=Clones, Genes, and Immortality: Ethics and the Genetic Revolution|location=[[Oxford, England|Oxford]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1998|page=37|isbn=0-19-288080-2|authorlink=John Harris (bioethicist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--This paragraph is of highly questionable relevance.--&gt;The word ''[[wiktionary:squick|squick]]'' was created within [[BDSM]] subculture in reaction to this sort of reasoning, and denotes a "gut reaction" of disgust without the implication of any sort of actual moral judgment.&lt;ref name="DTDSquick"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/squick/ |title=Squick|work=Double-Tongued Dictionary|date=June 23, 2005|accessdate=2007-11-24|author=Barrett, Grant (ed.)|location=[[Brooklyn, NY]]|publisher=Grant Barrett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wish list.jpg|thumb|A child's Christmas wish list from 1990]]
A '''wish list''' or '''want list''' is an itemization of goods or services that a person or organization desires. The author may distribute copies of their list to family, friends, and other [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s who are likely to purchase gifts for the would-be recipient, or to offer some of the listed items for sale. The goal of a wish list is to facilitate communication between the gift receiver and the gift giver. Wish lists often contain items that a gift purchaser can obtain from a variety of retailers.  Some wish lists are specialized for particular purposes or concentrated at individual retailers, such as [[gift registry|gift registries]] (e.g., [[bridal registry|bridal registries]]).

==Occasions==
In some cultures, people often exchange wish lists before major holidays that include gift giving, such as [[Christmas]] and [[birthday]]s. Other common occasions for issuing wish lists include [[baby shower]]s, [[housewarming party|housewarming]]s, [[wedding]]s, and [[drive (charity)|charity drives]].

== Types ==

* A [[gift registry]] is a type of wish list that contains only items that can be purchased at the store which manages the registry.
* An online wish list is a type of wish list that is hosted on the Internet. Online wish lists can be associated with a retailer or universal. 
* A product wish list is similar to a list of functional [[requirement]]s. The difference is mainly the importance of the requested functionality. Items that might be on the wish list at one time may be expected to be requirements later.
* A software user wishlist is a type of wish list that is created by the software manufacturer (such as the software development company or the website owner) or by user groups.
* A "bucket list" is a type of personal wish list consisting of things a person wishes to do before they die (e.g., "[[kick the bucket]]") or before they reach a life stage milestone (e.g., the end of childhood; the end of high school, etc.)

==Online==
An online wish list typically allows a registered user to create a wish list, add wishes to it and then spread a link to the wish list via email or social media like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. Visitors to the published wish list can in most cases comment wishes and reserve them. This adds a collaborative perspective among the viewers that would be much harder to achieve for analog wish lists. Online wish lists on retailer websites allow you to save items you prefer from that retailer's site for future reference. Universal online wish lists allow you to add items from multiple retailers and even non-retail ideas &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Online Wish List Best Practices |url=https://www.dreamlist.com/best/ |website=DreamList.com |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Software users==
Software user wish lists are a compilation of user suggestions for requested features. Many enterprise websites and software packages offer users the option to add a "wish" - a suggestion for improvement or change - and to vote on the importance of suggestions supplied by the publisher or author of the website or software, and they attempt to give a quick response to the suggestions.  For example, [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] has a "community" menu, and [[Facebook]] has a "suggestions" section.

In many cases, when a company fails to supply such a framework, users create their own lists, in [[Internet forum]]s or in [[blog]]s. When such a list becomes popular, the company must respond to the common requests.

Having software user wish lists has become popular since 2007 when a football gaming community FIFPlay started collecting fans wishlist for [[Electronic Arts]] for pre-development of [[FIFA (video game series)]] and it has collected over 10,000 ideas and suggestions for [[FIFA 08]].
