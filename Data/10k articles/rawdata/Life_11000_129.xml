==Biography==
Ibn Rawahah was from the [[Tribes of Arabia|Arabian tribe]], the [[Banu Khazraj]].&lt;ref name="sunnipath2"&gt;[[The Sealed Nectar]] [http://www.sunnipath.com/Resources/PrintMedia/Books/B0033P0017.aspx The Second ‘Aqabah Pledge] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128120537/http://www.sunnipath.com/Resources/PrintMedia/Books/B0033P0017.aspx |date=November 28, 2006 }} on sunnipath.com&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when writing was not a common skill he was a scribe and a poet.&lt;ref name="islamic-council.org"&gt;[http://www.islamic-council.org/lib/men/ABD-ALLAH-IBN-RAWAAHAH.html O My Soul, Death Is Inevitable, So It Is Better for You to Be Martyred] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630073952/http://www.islamic-council.org/lib/men/ABD-ALLAH-IBN-RAWAAHAH.html |date=June 30, 2006 }}, URL accessed 2009-09-30&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the twelve representatives of the [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]] who took an oath of allegiance initially, before the ''[[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]]'' and later spread [[Islam]] to [[Medina]]. Also [[Second pledge at al-Aqabah|he was among the 73 that pledged allegiance to Muhammad]] in Medina.

He is said to have been alert to the supposed plots of [[Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy]].&lt;ref name="islamic-council.org"/&gt;

'Abd Allah ibn Rawahah was third in command during the [[Battle of Mu'tah]] and was subsequently killed during the battle.

He also led his own expedition known as the [[Expedition of Abdullah ibn Rawaha]], where he was sent to assassinate al Yusayr ibn Rizam.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13303">'''2 Base Encoding''', also called '''SOLiD''' ('''sequencing by oligonucleotide ligation and detection'''), is a [[next-generation sequencing]] technology developed by [[Applied Biosystems]] and has been commercially available since 2008. These technologies generate hundreds of thousands of small sequence reads at one time. Well-known examples of such [[DNA sequencing]] methods include 454 [[pyrosequencing]] (introduced in 2005), the Solexa system (introduced in 2006) and the SOLiD system (introduced in 2007). These methods have reduced the cost from $0.01/base in 2004 to nearly $0.0001/base in 2006 and increased the sequencing capacity from 1,000,000 bases/machine/day in 2004 to more than 100,000,000 bases/machine/day in 2006.

2-base encoding is based on ligation sequencing rather than sequencing by synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Jay Shendure et al. (2005) Accurate Multiplex [[Polony Sequencing]] of an Evolved Bacterial Genome. Science 309(5741) , 1728 - 1732&lt;/ref&gt; However, instead of using fluorescent labeled 9-mer probes that distinguish only 6 bases, 2-base encoding takes advantage of fluorescent labeled 8-mer probes that distinguish the two 3 prime most bases but can be cycled similar to the Macevicz method, thus greater than 6bp reads can be obtained (25-50bp published,&lt;ref&gt;Sequence and structural variation in a human genome uncovered by short-read, massively parallel ligation sequencing using two-base encoding.

==General features==
The general steps common to many of these next-generation sequencing techniques include:

# Random fragmentation of genomic DNA
# Immobilization of single DNA fragments on a solid support like a bead or a planar solid surface
# Amplification of DNA fragments on the solid surface using PCR and making polymerase colonies&lt;ref&gt;Chetverin, NAR, 1993, Vol.21, No. 10 2349-2353&lt;/ref&gt;
# Sequencing and subsequent in situ interrogation after each cycle using fluorescence scanning or chemiluminescence.&lt;ref&gt;MATTHEW E. HUDSON (2008) Sequencing breakthroughs for genomic ecology and evolutionary biology.
Molecular Ecology Resources 8 (1) , 3–17&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1988, Whiteley ''et al.'' demonstrated the use of fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide ligation for the detection of DNA variants.&lt;ref&gt;Whiteley US patent number 4,883,750&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 Macevicz&lt;ref&gt;Macevicz US patent number 5,750,341&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated repeated ligation of oligonucleotides to detect contiguous DNA variants. In 2003, Dressman ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Transforming single DNA molecules into fluorescent magnetic particles fr detection and enumeration of genetic variations,PNAS July 22, 2004 Vol. 100 no. 15, 8817-8822&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated the use of emulsion PCR to generate millions of clonally amplified beads which one could perform these repeated ligation assays on.
In 2005, Shendure ''et al.'' performed a sequencing procedure which combined Whiteley and Dressman techniques performing ligation of fluorescent labeled "8 base degenerate" 9-mer probes which distinguished a different base according to the probes label and non degenerate base. This process was repeated (without regenerating an extendable end as in Macevicz) using identical primers but with probes with labels which identified different non-degenerate base to sequence 6bp reads in 5-&gt;3 direction and 7bp reads in the 3-&gt;5 direction.

==How it works==
The SOLiD Sequencing System uses probes with dual base encoding.

The underlying chemistry is summarized in the following steps:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.appliedbiosystems.com/cms/groups/mcb_marketing/documents/generaldocuments/cms_058265.pdf Applied Biosystems&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

- Step 1, Preparing a Library: This step begins with shearing the genomic DNA into small fragments. Then, two different adapters are added (for example A1 and A2). The resulting library contains template DNA fragments, which are tagged with one adapter at each end (A1-template-A2).

- Step 2, Emulsion PCR: In this step, the emulsion (droplets of water suspended in oil) PCR reaction is performed using DNA fragments from library, two primers (P1 and P2) that complement to the previously used adapters (P1 with A1 and P2 with A2), other PCR reaction components and 1μm beads coupled with one of the primers (e.g. P1). make dilution from DNA library to maximize the droplet that contain one DNA fragment and one bead into a single emulsion droplet. 

In each droplet, DNA template anneals to the P1-coupled bead from its A1 side. Then DNA polymerase will extend from P1 to make the complementary sequence, which eventually results in a bead enriched with PCR products from a single template. After PCR reaction, templates are denatured and disassociate from the beads. Dressman ''et al.'' first describe this technique in 2003.

- Step 3, Bead Enrichment: In practice, only 30% of beads have target DNA. To increase the number of beads that have target DNA, large polystyrene beads coated with A2 are added to the solution. Thus, any bead containing the extended products will bind polystyrene bead through its P2 end. The resulting complex will be separated from untargeted beads, and melt off to dissociate the targeted beads from polystyrene. This step can increase the throughput of this system from 30% before enrichment to 80% after enrichment.

After enrichment, the 3’-end of products (P2 end) will be modified which makes them capable of covalent bonding in the next step. Therefore, the products of this step are DNA-coupled beads with 3’-modification of each DNA strand.  

- Step 4, Bead Deposition: In this step, products of the last step are deposited onto a glass slide. Beads attach to the glass surface randomly through covalent bonds of the 3’-modified beads and the glass.

- Step 5, Sequencing Reaction: As mentioned earlier, unlike other next-generation methods which perform sequencing through synthesis, 2-base encoding is based on sequencing by ligation. The ligation is performed using specific 8-mer probes:

These probes are eight bases in length with a free hydroxyl group at the 3’ end, a fluorescent dye at the 5’ end and a cleavage site between the fifth and sixth nucleotide. The first two bases (starting at the 3' end) are complementary to the nucleotides being sequenced.  Bases 3 through 5 are degenerate and able to pair with any nucleotides on the template sequence.  Bases 6-8 are also degenerate but are cleaved off, along with the fluorescent dye, as the reaction continues.  Cleavage of the fluorescent dye and bases 6-8 leaves a free 5' phosphate group ready for further ligation.  In this manner positions n+1 and n+2 are correctly base-paired followed by n+6 and n+7 being correctly paired, etc.  The composition of bases n+3,n+4 and n+5 remains undetermined until further rounds of the sequencing reaction.

The sequencing step is basically composed of five rounds and each round consists of about 5-7 cycles (Figure 2). Each round begins with the addition of a P1-complementary universal primer. This primer has, for example, n nucleotides and its 5’-end matches exactly with the 3’-end of the P1. In each cycle, 8-mer probes are added and ligated according to their first and second bases. Then, the remaining unbound probes are washed out, the fluorescent signal from the bound probe is measured, and the bound probe is cleaved between its fifth and sixth nucleotide. Finally the primer and probes are all reset for the next round.

In the next round a new universal primer anneals the position n-1 (its 5’-end matches to the base exactly before the 3’-end of the P1) and the subsequent cycles are repeated similar to the first round. The remaining three rounds will be performed with new universal primers annealing positions n-2, n-3 and n-4 relative to the 3'-end of P1.  
 
A complete reaction of five rounds allows the sequencing of about 25 base pairs of the template from P1. 

- Step 6, Decoding Data: For decoding the data, which are represented as colors, we must first know two important factors. First, we must know that each color indicates two bases.  Second, we need to know one of the bases in the sequence: this base is incorporated in the sequence in the last (fifth) round of step5. This known base is the last nucleotide of the 3’-end of the known P1. Therefore, since each color represents two nucleotides in which the second base of each dinucleotide unit constitutes the first base of the following dinucleotide, knowing just one base in the sequence will lead us to interpret the whole sequence(Figure 2).&lt;ref&gt;[http://seqanswers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=10 Tech Summary: ABI's SOLiD (Seq. by Oligo Ligation/Detection) - SEQanswers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==2 Base Encoding considerations==
In practice direct translation of color reads into base reads is not advised as the moment one encounters an error in the color calls it will result in a frameshift of the base calls. To best leverage the "error correction" properties of two base encoding it is best to convert your base reference sequence into color-space. There is one unambiguous conversion of a base reference sequence into color-space and while the reverse is also true the conversion can be wildly inaccurate if there are any sequencing errors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genomics-array.blogspot.com/2010/09/color-space-to-fastq.html] Colorspace to FastQ example&lt;/ref&gt;

Mapping color-space reads to a color-space reference can properly utilize the two-base encoding rules where only adjacent color differences can represent a true base polymorphism. Direct decoding or translation of the color reads into bases cannot do this efficiently without other knowledge.

More specifically, this method is not an error correction tool but an error transformation tool. Color-space transforms your most common error mode (single measurement errors) into a different frequency than your most common form of DNA variation (SNPs or single base changes). These single base changes affect adjacent colors in color space. There are logical rules which help correct adjacent errors into 'valid' and 'invalid' adjacent errors.

The likelihood of getting two adjacent errors in a 50-bp read can be estimated. There are 49 ways of making adjacent changes to a 50 letter string (50-bp read). There are 1225 ways of making non-adjacent changes to a 50 letter string (50 choose 2). Simplistically, if one assumes errors are completely random (they are usually higher frequency at the end of reads) only 49 out of 1225 errors will be candidates for SNPs. In addition, only one third of the adjacent errors can be valid errors according to the known labeling of the probes thus delivering only 16 out of 1225 errors which can be candidates for SNPs. This is particularly useful for low coverage SNP detection as it reduces false positives at low coverage, Smith ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Smith et al., Genome Research 2008 18:1638-1642&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
Each base in this sequencing method is read twice. This changes the color of two adjacent color space calls, therefore in order to miscall a SNP, two adjacent colors must be miscalled. Because of this the SNP miscall rate is on the order of e^2, where e is the device error rate.

==Disadvantages==
When base calling single color miscalls cause errors on the remaining portion of the read. In SNP calling this can be corrected, which results in a lower SNP calling error rate. However for simplistic de novo assembly you are left with the raw device error rate which will be significantly higher than the 0.06% reported for SNP calling. Quality filtering of the reads can deliver higher raw accuracy reads which when aligned to form color contigs can deliver reference sequences where 2 base encoding can be better leveraged. Hybrid assemblies with other technologies can also better utilize the 2 base encoding.

Moti '''Abba Bok'a''' was a [[King]] of the [[Gibe region|Gibe]] [[Kingdom of Jimma]] (reigned 1859&amp;ndash;1862). He was the son of [[Abba Magal]], and brother of [[Abba Jifar I]].

==Reign==
Because the son of his nephew, Moti [[Abba Rebu]], was an infant when he was killed, Abba Bok'a was made King. A devout believer unlike his predecessors, he advocated [[Islam in Ethiopia|Islam]] in Jimma, building many [[mosque]]s and sending educated [[Muslim]]s to proselytize and teach in his provinces.

Abba Bok'a was very old at the time he became King, and died from natural causes.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert S. Lewis, ''A Galla Monarchy: Jimma Abba Jifar, Ethiopia'' (Madison, Wisconsin, 1965), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shrine Complex of Sheikh 'Abd al-Samad, Natanz 04.jpg|right|thumb|Tomb of Abdossamad in Natanz, built in 1304CE.]]

Sheikh '''Abdussamad Esfahani,''' ({{lang-fa|شیخ عبدالصمد اصفهانی}}), also spelled '''Abdul Samad''', ''''Abd al-Samad''', or '''Abd-ul-Samad''', was a famous [[Ilkhanid]] era [[Sufi]] of the 13th century. 

After Abdussamad's death in 1299 CE, his disciple, the [[Ilkhanid]] [[vizier]] Zayn al-Din Mastaria, built a {{illm|Abd al-Samad Isfahani Shrine|fa|مسجد شیخ عبدالصمد|lt=shrine}} in [[Natanz]] in his honor.

The technique was developed in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Jang |first=Jyh-Shing R |title=Fuzzy Modeling Using Generalized Neural Networks and Kalman Filter Algorithm |year=1991

'''Emmanuel Gazmey Santiago''', (born November 26, 1992) known professionally as '''Anuel AA''', is a Puerto Rican rapper. He is considered to be one of the first pioneers of the [[Latin trap]] movement.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

== Early life ==
Gazmey was born on November 26, 1992, in Carolina, Puerto Rico. His father, José Gazmey, was the vice president of [[Sony Music]] in Puerto Rico and was friends with the rapper [[Tempo (rapper)|Tempo]]. Gazmey studied at the Catholic school [[Colegio María Auxiliadora]] which was located in Carolina. Ever since his early teen years, Gazmey showed great interest in music and in 2010, he decided to become a rapper using his father's influence to secure a deal with the record-label [[Maybach Music Group]].

==Career==
Backed by his father, Tempo, and fellow rapper [[Ñengo Flow]], Gazmey released his first song with Ñengo Flow, "Demonia" in 2011. This was followed several collaborations with the likes of [[Nova &amp; Jory|Jory Boy]], Magazeen, [[De La Ghetto]], [[Arcángel (singer)|Arcángel]] and [[Ozuna (singer)|Ozuna]].

Gazmey rose to prominence following the hit "Esclava" alongside [[Bryant Myers]], Almighty and Anonimus. His first single hit "Sola" was very well received and was followed by a remix featuring [[Daddy Yankee]], [[Wisin]], [[Farruko]], and [[Zion &amp; Lennox]].

Gazmey's music theme relates to issues such as street life, violence, sex, and drugs. One of his most popular catchphrases in his songs is "Real Hasta La Muerte" or "Real Until Death". After being released from prison on July 17, 2018, Gazmey released his first full-length album titled ''Real Hasta La Muerte'' which contained 12 songs and landed at number one on the [[Billboard Top Latin Albums|''Billboard'' Top Latin Albums]] chart in less than 24 hours.

In August 2018, he released a song with the New York rapper [[6ix9ine]] called "Bebé".

==Arrest and imprisonment==
Gazmey was arrested and held in the [[Metropolitan Detention Center, Guaynabo]] on April 3, 2016 with three companions when police found three pistols including one stolen, nine clips, and 152 bullets. He signed a plea deal for 30 months in federal prison for gun possession charges.

Following his arrest, the #FreeAnuel movement became viral among his fans as he continued to release tracks from prison. Being able to record his voice over the phone, Anuel AA mostly participated in collaborations with other artists such as [[Nicky Jam]], [[Cosculluela]], [[Bad Bunny]] and [[J Balvin]].

While incarcerated, Gazmey spent 90 days in solitary confinement following an incident with another inmate.

During his trial, Gazmey stated that the lyrics in his music did not represent his true character. The presiding judge [[Aida Delgado-Colon]] said she had never heard any of his songs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.primerahora.com/noticias/policia-tribunales/nota/anuelaasentenciadoa30mesesdecarcel-1231090/|title=Anuel AA sentenciado a 30 meses de cárcel|last=Pacheco|first=Istra|date=2017-06-19|work=Primera Hora|access-date=2018-09-11|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 2018, Gazmey was released from federal prison into a state prison in Miami. During this time, he told ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' that while imprisoned, he kept listening to the radio and what was happening in the streets, to draw inspiration for his songwriting.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://remezcla.com/lists/music/anuel-aa-billboard-trap-kingz-interview-entrevista/|title=Anuel AA Opens Up About His Time in Prison in First Interviews After His Release|last=Herrera|first=Isabelia|date=2018-07-18|work=Remezcla|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, Anuel AA was featured along with [[Future (rapper)|Future]] and [[Bad Bunny]] on the single "Thinkin" by Spiff TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vibe.com/2018/04/spiff-tv-thinkin-future-bad-bunny-anuel-aa/|title=Spiff TV Shares 'Thinkin' Feat. Future, Bad Bunny, Anuel AA|last=Centeno|first=Tony|date=2018-04-09|work=Vibe|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
On September 15, Anuel AA released a diss track aimed at fellow rapper [[Cosculluela]]. The track was widely criticized due to its foul language and offensive remarks about homosexuality and HIV patients. Due to the public backlash, Gazmey's concert at the [[José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum|Coliseo de Puerto Rico]] venue scheduled for October 12 was canceled by his production staff and main producer Paco López.

==Personal life==
Anuel AA has a son.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While he was able to see pictures of his son and speak to him on the phone while in prison, his son was not permitted to visit him in person.

{{Ismailis|Ismaili History}}

'''Order of Assassins''' or simply '''Assassins''' is the common name used to refer to an [[Islamic]] [[sect]] formally known as the [[Nizari Ismailis]]. Based on texts from [[Alamut]], their grand master [[Hassan-i Sabbah]] tended to call his disciples Asāsiyyūn (أساسيون, meaning "people who are faithful to the foundation [of the faith]"), but some foreign travellers like Marco Polo&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZDh8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Travels of Marco Polo|last=Komroff|first=Manuel|date=2013-04-16|publisher=Read Books Ltd|isbn=9781446545997|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; misunderstood the name as deriving from the term [[hashish]].&lt;ref name=Burman70/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis30/&gt;&lt;ref name=Daftary12/&gt;&lt;ref name=Daftary13/&gt;

Often described as a secret order led by a mysterious "[[Rashid ad-Din Sinan|Old Man of the Mountain]]", the Nizari Ismailis formed in the late [[11th century|11th&amp;nbsp;century]] after a split within [[Ismailism]] &amp;ndash; a branch of [[Shia Islam]].

The Nizaris posed a strategic threat to [[Sunni]] [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuq authority]] by capturing and inhabiting several [[List of Ismaili castles|mountain fortresses]] throughout [[Persia]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and later [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], under the leadership of [[Hassan-i Sabbah]].  [[Asymmetric warfare]], [[psychological warfare]], and [[surgical strike]]s were often a tactic of the assassins, drawing their opponents into submission rather than risk killing them.&lt;ref name="Lane-Poole 1906"&gt;{{cite book|last= Lane-Poole |first= Stanley |authorlink= Stanley Lane-Poole |title= Saladin and the Fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem |publisher= [[G.

While "Assassins" typically refers to the entire sect, only a group of acolytes known as the ''[[Fedayeen|fida'i]]'' actually engaged in conflict. Lacking their own army, the Nizari relied on these warriors to carry out espionage and assassinations of key enemy figures, and over the course of 300&amp;nbsp;years successfully killed two caliphs, and many viziers, sultans, and [[Crusades|Crusader]] leaders.&lt;ref name=Acosta-21&gt;{{cite book|last1=Acosta|first1=Benjamin|editor1-last=Stanton|editor1-first=Andrea L.|editor2-last=Ramsamy|editor2-first=Edward|title=Cultural Sociology of the Middle East, Asia, and Africa: An Encyclopedia|date=2012|publisher=Sage|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GtCL2OYsH6wC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=history+Hashishin+killed+caliphs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBwhyyoualwayslyingQ6AEwAGoVChMI67L3hf2_yAIVQZQNCh2D4Qtk#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20Hashishin%20killed%20caliphs&amp;f=false|accessdate=October 13, 2015|chapter=Assassins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the rule of Imam [[Rukn-ud-Din Khurshah]], the Nizari state declined internally, and was eventually destroyed as the Imam surrendered the castles to the [[Mongol invasions and conquests|invading Mongols]]. The Mongols destroyed and eliminated their Order. Mentions of Assassins were preserved within European sources &amp;ndash; such as the writings of [[Marco Polo]] &amp;ndash; where they are depicted as trained killers, responsible for the systematic elimination of opposing figures. The word "[[wikt:assassin|assassin]]" has been used ever since to describe a hired or professional killer, leading to the related term "[[wikt:assassination|assassination]]", which denotes any action involving murder of a high-profile target for political reasons.

The Nizari were acknowledged and feared by the [[Crusaders]]. The stories of the Assassins were further embellished by [[Marco Polo]]. European [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] historians in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century &amp;ndash; such as [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall]] &amp;ndash; also referred to the Nizari in their works and tended to write about the Nizari based on accounts by medieval Sunni Arab and Persian authors.

==Origins==
''Further information: [[Alamut]]''
[[File:Asabah2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|220px|Artistic rendering of [[Hassan-i Sabbah]].]]
The origins of the Assassins can be traced back to just before the [[First Crusade]], around 1094 in Alamut, north of modern Iran, during a crisis of succession to the [[Fatimid caliphate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Eddé |first=Anne-Marie |editor-last=Vauchez  |editor-first=André |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages |title=Assassins |year=2003 |publisher=Oxford |isbn=9780227679319}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been great difficulty finding out much information about the origins of the Assassins because most early sources are written by enemies of the order, are based on legends, or both.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Most sources dealing with the order's inner workings were destroyed with the capture of [[Alamut castle|Alamut]], the Assassins' headquarters, by the [[Mongols]] in 1256. However, it is possible to trace the beginnings of the cult back to its first Grandmaster, [[Hassan-i Sabbah]] (1050s–1124).

A passionate devotee of Isma'ili beliefs, [[Hassan-i Sabbah]] was well-liked throughout [[Cairo]], [[Syria]] and most of the [[Middle East]] by other Isma'ili, which led to a number of people becoming his followers. Using his fame and popularity, Sabbah founded the Order of the Assassins. While his motives for founding this order are ultimately unknown, it was said to be all for his own political and personal gain and to also exact vengeance on his enemies. Because of the unrest in [[the Holy Land]] caused by the [[Crusades]], Hassan-i Sabbah found himself not only fighting for power with other [[Muslims]], but also with the invading Christian forces.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|first=Laurence|last= Lockhart|title= Hasan-i-Sabbah and the Assassins|publisher=University of London|location= London|year=1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After creating the Order, Sabbah searched for a location that would be fit for a sturdy headquarters and decided on [[Alamut Castle|the fortress]] at [[Alamut]] in what is now northwestern [[Iran]]. The Alamut castle was built by the [[Justanid]] ruler, Wahsudan b. Marzuban, a follower of zaydi Shiaism, around 865 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=cSO9zh61AGEC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=865+alamut+justanid&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiz1MeVgu_cAhUDL48KHSrFBZEQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=865%20alamut%20justanid&amp;f=false|title=The Isma'ilis: Their History and Doctrines|last=Daftary|first=Farhad|date=2007-09-20|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139465786|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sabbah and adapted the fortress to suit his needs not only for defense from hostile forces, but also for indoctrination of his followers. After laying claim to the fortress at Alamut, Sabbah began expanding his influence outwards to nearby towns and districts, using his agents to gain political favour and to intimidate the local populations.

Spending most of his days at Alamut producing religious works and developing doctrines for his Order, Sabbah would never leave his fortress again in his lifetime. He had established a secret society of deadly assassins, which was built on a hierarchical structure. Below Sabbah, the Grand Headmaster of the Order, were those known as "Greater Propagandists", followed by the normal "Propagandists", the Rafiqs ("Companions"), and the Lasiqs ("Adherents"). It was the Lasiqs who were trained to become some of the most feared assassins, or as they were called, "Fida'in" (self-sacrificing agents).&lt;ref name="Nowell 1947"&gt;
{{cite journal |first=Charles E. |last= Nowell |title= The Old Man of the Mountain |journal=Speculum |volume=22 |issue=4 |year=1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is unknown how Hassan-i-Sabbah was able to get his "Fida'in" to perform with such fervent loyalty. One theory, possibly the best known but also the most criticized, comes from the reports of [[Marco Polo]] during his travels to the Orient. He recounts a story he heard of a man who would drug his young followers with [[hashish]], lead them to a "paradise", and then claim that only he had the means to allow for their return. Perceiving that Sabbah was either a prophet or magician, his disciples, believing that only he could return them to "paradise", were fully committed to his cause and willing to carry out his every request.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|first=John |last= Frampton|title= The Most Noble and Famous Travels of Marco Polo|year=1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this story is disputed{{By whom|date=April 2015}} because Sabbah died in 1124 and [[Rashid ad-Din Sinan|Sinan]], who is frequently known as the "Old Man of the Mountain", died in 1192, whereas Marco Polo was not born until around 1254.&lt;ref name="Italiani nel sistema solare"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TiTXdptskSsC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=marco+polo+15+settembre+1254&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FHywUuKYKMHnywPTnoKIDA&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=marco%20polo%2015%20settembre%201254&amp;f=false Italiani nel sistema solare] di Michele T. Mazzucato&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Many sources state "around 1254"; {{Harvnb|Britannica|2002|p=571}} states, "born in or around 1254".&lt;/ref&gt;

With his new weapons, Sabbah began to order assassinations, ranging from politicians to great generals. Assassins would rarely attack ordinary citizens though, and tended not to be hostile towards them.

Although the "Fida'yin" were the lowest rank in Sabbah's order and were only used as expendable pawns to do the Grandmaster's bidding, much time and many resources were put into training them. The Assassins were generally young in age, giving them the physical strength and stamina which would be required to carry out these murders. However, physical prowess was not the only trait that was required to be a "Fida'i". To get to their targets, the Assassins had to be patient, cold, and calculating. They were generally intelligent and well-read because they were required to possess not only knowledge about their enemy, but his or her culture and their native language. They were trained by their masters to disguise themselves and sneak into enemy territory to perform the assassinations, instead of simply attacking their target outright.&lt;ref name="Nowell 1947"/&gt;

==Etymology==

The word "ASAS" in Arabic means principle. The "Asasyun" (plural, literary Arabic, official texts, proper form) were as defined in Arabic; people of principle. Asasi (singular) and asasin pronounced "asaseen" (plural, literary variation as well as regular spoken Arabic, more commonly used) The term "assassin" can easily, however unlikely in this instance, be thought as finding its roots in "hashshāshīn"(hashish smokers or users). It is far more likely to be a mispronunciation of the original Asasyun. However, not a mispronunciation of "asaseen". One can therefore see how its origins became assassin in Western languages. Originally referring to the methods of political control exercised by the Asasyun as defined by their activities and Later, the almost identical borrowed term assassin(s) used in several languages to describe similar activities anywhere.

The Assassins were finally linked by the 19th-century orientalist scholar [[Silvestre de Sacy]] to the Arabic word ''[[hashish]]'' using their variant names ''assassin'' and ''assissini'' in the 19th century. Citing the example of one of the first written applications of the [[Arabic]] term ''hashish'' to the Ismailis by 13th-century historian Abu Shama, de Sacy demonstrated its connection to the name given to the Ismailis throughout Western scholarship.&lt;ref name="Daftary 1998, p. 14"&gt;Daftary 1998, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The first known usage of the term ''hashishi'' has been traced back to 1122 when the [[Fatimid]] [[caliph]] [[Al-Amir|al-Āmir]] employed it in derogatory reference to the Syrian Nizaris.&lt;ref name="Daftary 1998, p. 14"/&gt; Used figuratively, the term ''hashishi'' connoted meanings such as outcasts or rabble.&lt;ref name="Daftary 1998, p. 14"/&gt; Without actually accusing the group of using the hashish drug, the [[Caliph]] used the term in a pejorative manner. This label was quickly adopted by anti-Ismaili historians and applied to the Ismailis of Syria and Persia. The spread of the term was further facilitated through military encounters between the Nizaris and the [[Crusades|Crusaders]], whose chroniclers adopted the term and disseminated it across Europe.

During the [[medieval]] period, Western scholarship on the Ismailis contributed to the popular view of the community as a radical sect of assassins, believed to be trained for the precise murder of their adversaries. By the 14th century, European scholarship on the topic had not advanced much beyond the work and tales from the Crusaders.&lt;ref name="Daftary 1998, p. 14"/&gt; The origins of the word forgotten, across Europe the term Assassin had taken the meaning of "professional murderer".&lt;ref name="Daftary 1998, p. 14"/&gt; In 1603, the first Western publication on the topic of the Assassins was authored by a court official for [[Henry IV of France|King Henry IV]] of [[France]] and was mainly based on the narratives of [[Marco Polo]] from his visits to the [[Near East]]. While he assembled the accounts of many Western travellers, the author failed to explain the etymology of the term Assassin.&lt;ref&gt;Daftary 1998, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Lebanese writer [[Amin Maalouf]], based on texts from Alamut, Hassan-i Sabbah tended to call his disciples ''Asāsīyūn'' ({{lang|ar|أساسيون}}, meaning "people who are faithful to the foundation [of the faith]"), and derivation from the term ''hashish'' is a misunderstanding by foreign travelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Amin|last=Maalouf|authorlink=Amin Maalouf|title=Samarkand|publisher=Interlink Publishing Group|location= New York|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another modern author, Edward Burman, states that:
{{quote|text=Many scholars have argued, and demonstrated convincingly, that the attribution of the epithet "hashish eaters" or "hashish takers" is a misnomer derived from enemies of the Isma'ilis and was never used by Muslim chroniclers or sources. It was therefore used in a pejorative sense of "enemies" or "disreputable people". This sense of the term survived into modern times with the common Egyptian usage of the term Hashasheen in the 1930s to mean simply "noisy or riotous". It is unlikely that the austere Hassan-i Sabbah indulged personally in drug taking&amp;nbsp;... there is no mention of that drug hashish in connection with the Persian Assassins – especially in the library of Alamut ("the secret archives").&lt;ref name=Burman70&gt;{{cite book|first=Edward|last= Burman|title= The Assassins – Holy Killers of Islam|publisher=Crucible|location= Wellingborough|year=1987}} p.70.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The name "Assassin" is often said to derive from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''Hashishin'' or "users of [[hashish]]",&lt;ref name=Lewis30&gt;Lewis, Bernard (1967), ''The Assassins: a Radical Sect of Islam'', pp 30-31, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;(which can be used as a derogatory term in Arabic and it is the equivalent of "drug addict", in this case, "hashish addict") was originally applied to the Nizari Ismaelis by the rival [[Mustali]] Ismailis during the fall of the Ismaili [[Fatimid Empire]] and the separation of the two Ismaili streams,&lt;ref name=Daftary12&gt;Daftary, Farhad (1990). ''The Ismailis: Their history and doctrines.'' Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press. Page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; there is little evidence hashish was used to motivate the assassins, contrary to the beliefs of their medieval enemies.&lt;ref name=Daftary13&gt;Daftary, Farhad (1990). ''The Ismailis: Their history and doctrines.'' Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press. Page 13. quote=[p.13]"the tale of how the Nizari chiefs secretly administered hashish to the fadaeen in order to control and motivate them has been accepted by many scholars since Arnold of Lueback. But the fact remains that neither the Isma'ili texts which have come to light in modern times nor any serious ..." [p.353] "However, contrary to the medieval legends fabricated by uninformed writers and the enemies of the sect, there is no evidence that hashish was used in any way for motivating the fidaeen who displayed an intensive groups sentiment and solidarity."&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the term ''hashishiyya'' or ''hashishi'' in Arabic sources was used metaphorically in its abusive sense relating to use of hashish, which due to its effects on the mind state, is outlawed in Islam. Modern versions of this word include ''Mahashish'' used in the same derogatory sense, albeit less offensive nowadays, as the use of the substance is more widespread.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[Idries Shah]], a [[sufi]] scholar using ''Arkon Daraul'' as a [[pen name]], described them as 'druggers' that used hashish "in stupefying candidates for the ephemeral visit to ''paradise''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Arkon|last= Daraul|title= A History of Secret Societies|publisher=Citadel Press|year=1961}} p. 13, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sunni]] Muslims also used the term ''[[mulhid]]'' to refer to the Assassins, which is also recorded by the traveller [[William of Rubruck]] as ''{{lang|la|mulidet}}''.&lt;ref&gt;

In pursuit of their religious and political goals, the Ismailis adopted various military strategies popular in the [[Middle Ages]]. One such method was that of assassination, the selective elimination of prominent rival figures. The murders of political adversaries were usually carried out in public spaces, creating resounding intimidation for other possible enemies.&lt;ref name="Daftary 1998, p. 129"&gt;Daftary 1998, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout history, many groups have resorted to assassination as a means of achieving political ends. In the Ismaili context, these assignments were performed by ''fida'is'' (devotees) of the Ismaili mission. The assassinations were committed against those whose elimination would most greatly reduce aggression against the Ismailis and, in particular, against those who had perpetrated massacres against the community. A single assassination was usually employed in contrast with the widespread bloodshed which generally resulted from factional combat. Hashashin are also said to be adept in ''[[furusiyya]]'', or the Islamic warrior code, where they are trained in combat, disguises, and [[equestrianism]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} [[Codes of conduct]] are followed, and the hashashin are taught in the art of war, linguistics, and strategies. Hashashin never allowed their women to be at their fortresses during military campaigns, both for protection and secrecy. This is a tradition first made by Hassan when he sent his wife and daughters to [[Girdkuh]] when a [[famine]] was created during the Seljuk siege of Alamut.&lt;ref name="Wasserman, p. 102"&gt;Wasserman, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; For about two centuries, the hashashin specialized in assassinating their religious and political enemies.&lt;ref name="Wasserman, p. 102"/&gt;

[[File:Masyaf - Gesamtansicht.jpg|thumb|[[Rashid ad-Din Sinan]] the Grand Master of the Assassins at [[Masyaf]] successfully kept [[Saladin]] off his territory.]]

The first instance of murder in the effort to establish a Nizari Ismaili state in Persia is widely considered to be the killing of [[Great Seljuk Empire|Seljuq]] [[vizier]], [[Nizam al-Mulk]].&lt;ref&gt;Willey, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Carried out by a man dressed as a [[Sufi]] whose identity remains unclear, the vizier's murder in a Seljuq court is distinctive of exactly the type of visibility for which missions of the ''fida'is'' have been significantly exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;Willey p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; While the Seljuqs and [[Crusaders]] both employed murder as a military means of disposing of factional enemies, during the Alamut period almost any murder of political significance in the Islamic lands was attributed to the Ismailis.&lt;ref name="Daftary 1998, p. 129"/&gt; So inflated had this association grown that, in the work of orientalist scholars such as [[Bernard Lewis]], the Ismailis were equated with the politically active ''fida'is'' and thus were regarded as a radical and [[heresy|heretical]] sect known as the Assassins.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Lewis | first1 = Bernard | authorlink1 = Bernard Lewis | title = The Assassins: A Radical Sect in Islam | publisher = Phoenix | year = 2003 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rRZAPgAACAAJ | accessdate = September 15, 2010 | isbn = 978-1-84212-451-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The military approach of the Nizari Ismaili state was largely a defensive one, with strategically chosen sites that appeared to avoid confrontation wherever possible without the loss of life.&lt;ref&gt;Willey, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; But the defining characteristic of the Nizari Ismaili state was that it was scattered geographically throughout Persia and Syria. The Alamut castle therefore was only one of a nexus of strongholds throughout the regions where Ismailis could retreat to safety if necessary. West of Alamut in the Shahrud Valley, the major fortress of Lamasar served as just one example of such a retreat. In the context of their political uprising, the various spaces of Ismaili military presence took on the name ''dar al-hijra'' ({{lang|ar|دار الهجرة}}; land of migration, place of refuge). The notion of the ''dar al-hijra'' originates from the time of [[Muhammad]], who migrated with his followers from persecution to a safe haven in ''Yathrib'' ([[Medina]]).&lt;ref name="Hodgson"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hodgson | first1 = Marshall G. S. | authorlink1 = Marshall Hodgson | title = The Secret Order of Assassins: The Struggle of the Early Nizârî Ismâʻîlîs Against the Islamic World | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 2005 | location = Philadelphia | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GU7uAAAAMAAJ | accessdate = September 15, 2010 | isbn = 978-0-8122-1916-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the [[Fatimid]]s found their ''dar al-hijra'' in North Africa. From 1101 to 1118, attacks and sieges were made on the fortresses, conducted by combined forces of Seljuk, Berkyaruq, and Sanjar. Although with the cost of lives and the capture and execution of assassin [[Da'i|dai]] Ahmad ibn Hattash, the hashashin managed to hold their ground and repel the attacks until the Mongol invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, during the revolt against the Seljuqs, several fortresses served as spaces of refuge for the Ismailis.

===Assassination===
{{further|Assassination|Asymmetrical warfare|Psychological warfare|List of assassinations by the Assassins}}
[[File:Assassination of Nizam al-Mulk.jpg|thumb|260px|14th-century painting of the successful assassination of [[Nizam al-Mulk]], vizier of the Seljuq Empire, by an Assassin. It is often considered their most significant assassination.]]

At their peak, many of the [[assassinations]] of the day were often attributed to the hashashin. Even though the Crusaders and the other factions employed personal assassins, the fact that the hashashin performed their assassinations in full view of the public, often in broad daylight, gave them the reputation assigned to them.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychological warfare]], and attacking the enemy's psyche was another often employed tactic of the hashashin, who would sometimes attempt to draw their opponents into submission rather than risk killing them.&lt;ref name="Lane-Poole 1906"/&gt;

During the Seljuk invasion after the death of [[Malik-Shah I|Muhammad Tapar]], a new Seljuk sultan emerged with the coronation of Tapar's son [[Ahmad Sanjar|Sanjar]]. When Sanjar rebuffed the hashashin ambassadors who were sent by Hassan for peace negotiations, Hassan sent his hashashin to the sultan. Sanjar woke up one morning with a dagger stuck in the ground beside his bed. Alarmed, he kept the matter a secret. A messenger from Hassan arrived and stated, "Did I not wish the sultan well that the dagger which was struck in the hard ground would have been planted on your soft breast". For the next several decades there ensued a ceasefire between the Nizaris and the Seljuk. Sanjar himself pensioned the hashashin on taxes collected from the lands they owned, gave them grants and licenses, and even allowed them to collect tolls from travelers.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Downfall and aftermath==
[[File:Siege of Alamut (1256).jpeg|thumb|upright|View of Alamut besieged. The last Grand Master of the Assassins at [[Alamut]] Imam Rukn al-Din Khurshah (1255–1256) was executed by [[Hulagu Khan]] after a devastating siege]]
The Assassins were eradicated by the [[Mongol Empire]] during the well-documented invasion of [[Khwarizm]]. They probably dispatched their assassins to kill [[Möngke Khan]]. Thus, a decree was handed over to the Mongol commander [[Kitbuqa]] who began to assault several Hashashin fortresses in 1253 before [[Hulagu Khan|Hulagu's]] advance in 1256. The [[Mongols]] besieged [[Alamut]] on December 15, 1256. The Assassins recaptured and held Alamut for a few months in 1275, but they were crushed and their political power was lost forever.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The Syrian branch of the Assassins was taken over by the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] [[Baibars|Sultan Baibars]] in 1273. The Mamluks continued to use the services of the remaining Assassins: in the 14th century [[Ibn Battuta]] reported their fixed rate of pay per murder. In exchange, they were allowed to exist. Eventually, they resorted to the act of [[Taqiyya|Taqq'iya]] (dissimulation), hiding their true identities until their Imams would awaken them.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

According to the historian [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]], the [[Böszörmény]], (Izmaleita or Ismaili/[[Nizari]]) denomination of Muslims who lived in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] from the 10th to the 13th centuries, were employed as mercenaries by the kings of Hungary. However, following the establishment of the Christian [[Kingdom of Hungary]], their community was vanquished by the end of the 13th century due to the [[Inquisition]]s ordered by the Catholic Church during the reign of [[Coloman, King of Hungary]]. It is said that the Assassins are the ancestors of those given the surname Hajaly, derived from the word "hajal", a rare species of bird found in the mountains of Syria near [[Masyaf]]. The [[Chukar Partridge|hajal]] (bird) was often used as a symbol of the Assassin's order.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Legends and folklore==
The legends of the Assassins had much to do with the training and instruction of Nizari ''fida'is'', famed for their public missions during which they often gave their lives to eliminate adversaries. Historians have contributed to the tales of ''fida'is'' being fed with hashish as part of their training.&lt;ref name="Ivanow"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ivanov | first1 = Vladimir | authorlink1 = Vladimir Alexeyevich Ivanov | title = Alamut and Lamasar: two mediaeval Ismaili strongholds in Iran, an archaeological study | publisher = Ismaili Society | year = 1960 | page = 21 |location = Tehran, Iran | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O_NtAAAAMAAJ | accessdate = September 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether ''fida'is'' were actually trained or dispatched by Nizari leaders is unconfirmed, but scholars including [[Vladimir Alexeyevich Ivanov|Vladimir Ivanov]] purport that the assassinations of key figures including Saljuq vizier Nizam al-Mulk likely provided encouraging impetus to others in the community who sought to secure the Nizaris protection from political aggression.&lt;ref name="Ivanow" /&gt; Originally, a "local and popular term" first applied to the Ismailis of Syria, the label was orally transmitted to Western historians and thus found itself in their histories of the Nizaris.&lt;ref name="Hodgson" /&gt;

The tales of the ''fida'is''{{'}} training collected from anti-Ismaili historians and orientalist writers were compounded and compiled in Marco Polo's account, in which he described a "secret garden of paradise".&lt;ref name="Daftary 1998, p. 16"&gt;Daftary 1998, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; After being drugged, the Ismaili devotees were said to be taken to a paradise-like garden filled with attractive young maidens and beautiful plants in which these ''fida'is'' would awaken. Here, they were told by an "old" man that they were witnessing their place in Paradise and that should they wish to return to this garden permanently, they must serve the Nizari cause.&lt;ref name="Hodgson" /&gt; So went the tale of the "Old Man in the Mountain", assembled by Marco Polo and accepted by [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall]], an 18th-century [[Austrians|Austrian]] orientalist writer responsible for much of the spread of this legend. Until the 1930s, von Hammer's retelling of the Assassin legends served as the standard account of the Nizaris across Europe.&lt;ref name="Daftary 1998, p. 16"/&gt;

Another one of Hassan's recorded methods includes causing the hashashin to be vilified by their contemporaries. One story goes that Hassan al-Sabah set up a trick to make it appear as if he had [[decapitated]] one of his hashashin and the "dead" hashashin's head lay at the foot of his throne. It was actually one of his men buried up to his neck covered with blood. He invited his hashashin to speak to it. He said that he used special powers to allow it to communicate. The supposed talking head would tell the hashashin about paradise after death if they gave all their hearts to the cause. After the trick was played, Hassan had the man killed and his head placed on a stake in order to cement the deception.&lt;ref name="Daftary 1998, p. 17"&gt;Daftary 1998, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known legend tells how Count Henry of Champagne, returning from [[Armenia]], spoke with Grand Master Rashid ad-Din Sinan at al-Kahf. The count claimed to have the most powerful army and at any moment he claimed he could defeat the Hashshashin, because his army was 10 times larger. Rashid replied that his army was instead the most powerful, and to prove it he told one of his men to jump off from the top of the castle in which they were staying. The man did. Surprised, the count immediately recognized that Rashid's  army was indeed the strongest, because it did everything at his command, and Rashid further gained the count's respect.&lt;ref&gt;''The Assassins: A Radical Sect in Islam'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern works on the Nizaris have elucidated their history and, in doing so, dispelled popular histories from the past as mere legends. In 1933, under the direction of the [[Imam]] [[Aga Khan III|Sultan Muhammad Shah]], [[Aga Khan III]], the Islamic Research Association was developed. Historian Vladimir Ivanov was central to both this institution and the 1946 Ismaili Society of [[Bombay]]. Cataloguing a number of Ismaili texts, Ivanov provided the ground for great strides in modern Ismaili scholarship.&lt;ref name="Daftary 1998, p. 17"/&gt;

In recent years, Peter Willey has provided interesting evidence that goes against the Assassin folklore of earlier scholars. Drawing on its established esoteric doctrine, Willey asserts that the Ismaili understanding of Paradise is a deeply symbolic one. While the [[Qur'an]]ic description of Heaven includes natural imagery, Willey argues that no Nizari ''fida'i'' would seriously believe that he was witnessing Paradise simply by awakening in a beauteous garden.&lt;ref name="Willey, p. 55"&gt;Willey, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The Nizaris' symbolic interpretation of the Qur'anic description of Paradise serves as evidence against the possibility of such an exotic garden used as motivation for the devotees to carry out their armed missions. Furthermore, Willey points out that a courtier of [[Hulagu Khan]], [[Ata al-Mulk Juvayni|Juvayni]], surveyed the Alamut castle just before the Mongol invasion. In his reports about the fortress, there are elaborate descriptions of sophisticated storage facilities and the famous Alamut library. However, even this anti-Ismaili historian makes no mention of the gardens on the Alamut grounds.&lt;ref name="Willey, p. 55"/&gt; Having destroyed a number of texts in the library's collection, deemed by Juvayni to be heretical, it would be expected that he would pay significant attention to the Nizari gardens, particularly if they were the site of drug use and temptation. Having not once mentioned such gardens, Willey concludes that there is no sound evidence in favour of these legends.

These legends feature in certain works of fiction, including [[Vladimir Bartol]]'s 1938 novel ''[[Alamut (1938 novel)|Alamut]]'', and [[Simon Acland]]'s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cookie Dude Web Design |url=http://www.simonacland.com |title=simonacland.com |publisher=simonacland.com |date=June 1, 2012 |accessdate=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; First Crusade novels ''The Waste Land'' and ''The Flowers of Evil''. In the latter, the author suggests that the origin of the name Assassin is the Turkish word ''hashhash'' meaning opium, partly on the basis that this drug is more suitable for producing the effects suggested in the legends than hashish.

==Fortresses in Syria==
[[File:Map Crusader states ca. 1100.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Map of the [[Crusader states]], showing the area controlled by the Assassins around [[Masyaf]], slightly above the center, in white.]]
During the mid-12th century the Assassins captured or acquired several fortresses in the [[An-Nusayriyah Mountains|Nusayriyah Mountain Range]] in coastal Syria, including [[Masyaf]], [[Al-Rusafa, Syria|Rusafa]], [[Al-Kahf Castle|al-Kahf]], [[al-Qadmus]], [[Khawabi]], [[Sarmin]], [[Quliya]], [[Ulayqa]], [[Maniqa]], [[Abu Qubays]] and [[Harim Mountains|Jabal al-Summaq]]. For the most part, the Assassins maintained full control over these fortresses until 1270–73 when the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] sultan [[Baibars]] annexed them. Most were dismantled afterwards, while those at Masyaf and Ulayqa were later rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael, 2011, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, the Ismailis maintained limited autonomy over those former strongholds as loyal subjects of the Mamluks.&lt;ref&gt;Daftary, 2007, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{details|Assassins in popular culture}}
The Hashashin were part of [[Medieval]] culture, and they were either demonized or romanticized. The Hashashin appeared frequently in the art and literature of the Middle Ages, sometimes illustrated as one of the knight's archenemies and as a quintessential villain during the crusades.&lt;ref&gt;The Assassins: A Radical Sect in Islam p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

The word Assassin, in variant forms, had already passed into European usage in this general sense as a term for a hired professional murderer. The Florentine chronicler [[Giovanni Villani]], who died in 1348, tells how the lord of Lucca sent 'his assassins' (i suoi assassini) to Pisa to kill a troublesome enemy there. Even earlier, [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], in a passing reference in the 19th canto of the ''[[Dante's Inferno|Inferno]]'', speaks of 'the treacherous assassin' (lo perfido assassin); his fourteenth-century commentator Francesco da Buti, explaining a term which for some readers at the time may still have been strange and obscure, remarks: 'Assassino è colui che uccide altrui per danari' (An assassin is one who kills others for money).&lt;ref&gt;The Assassins: A Radical Sect in Islam p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assassins appear in many [[role-playing game]]s and [[video game]]s, especially in [[massively multiplayer online game]]s. The [[Assassin (character class)|assassin character class]] is a common feature of many such games, usually specializing in single combat and stealth skills, often combined in order to defeat an opponent without exposing the assassin to counter-attack.

* The ''[[Exile (1988 video game series)|Exile]]'' series of [[action role-playing game]]s revolves around a time-travelling Syrian Assassin who assassinates various religious historical figures and modern world leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/exile/exile.htm|title=Hardcore Gaming 101: Exile / XZR|last=Szczepaniak|first=John|date=April 11, 2009|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|accessdate=August 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leo Chan, [http://www.neoseeker.com/news/12552-sunsoft-scores-telenet-japan-franchises/ Sunsoft scores Telenet Japan franchises], Neoseeker, December 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' video game series portrays a heavily fictionalised Ḥashshāshīn order, which has expanded beyond its Levantine confines and is depicted to have existed throughout recorded history (along with their nemesis, the [[Knights Templar]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/11/12/the-history-of-assassins-creed The History of Assassin's Creed by IGN]&lt;/ref&gt;  Both orders are presented as fundamentally philosophical, rather than as religious, in nature, and are expressly said to predate the faiths that their real-life counterparts arose from, thus allowing for the expansion of their respective "histories" both before and after their factual time-frames. However, ''Assassin's Creed'' draws much of its content from historical facts, and even incorporates as the creed itself the purported last words from [[Hassan i Sabbah]]: "Nothing is true; everything is permitted" (though the sources for that quote are largely unreliable). The series has since developed into a franchise, comprising novels, comic books, and a [[Assassin's Creed (film)|film]].
* In the ''Sword of Islam'' [[Downloadable content|DLC]] for [[Paradox Interactive]]'s [[grand strategy]] game ''[[Crusader Kings II]]'', the Hashashin are a holy order associated with [[Shi'a Islam]]. Once established, Shi'ite rulers may hire the Hashashin to fight against non-Shi'a realms, and can potentially [[vassal]]ize them. The ''Monks and Mystics'' DLC expands their role, making the Assassins a unique secret society that Shi'a characters may join.
* In the [[Netflix]] series ''[[Marco Polo (TV series)|Marco Polo]]'', the emperor [[Kublai Khan]] is attacked by a group of assassins, which is said to be the work of the Hashshashin who are led by the Old Man of the Mountain according to the Taoist Monk, [[Hundred Eyes]], in the King's court. The Old Man of the Mountain is then pursued by Marco Polo and Byamba. The show shows how the Old Man leads Marco Polo into a hallucination state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3798176/plotsummary "Marco Polo" Hashshashin (TV Episode 2014) - Plot Summary - IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Louis L'Amour]], in his book ''[[The Walking Drum]]'', used the assassins and the stronghold of Alamut as the location of his main character's enslaved father.  Mathurin Kerbouchard, who initially seeks his father in the 12th century Moor-controlled Spain, then throughout Europe, must ultimately travel to the Stronghold of Alamut in order to rescue Jean Kerbouchard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/12268583 |title=The walking drum |last=L'Amour |first=Louis |date=1984|publisher=Bantam Books |isbn=9780553249231 |location=Toronto|oclc=12268583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Behavior tree (artificial intelligence, robotics and control) }}

A '''Behavior Tree''' ('''BT''') is a [[mathematical model]] of [[Automated planning and scheduling|plan]] execution used in [[computer science]], [[robotics]], [[control systems]] and [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|video games]]. They describe switchings between a finite set of tasks in a modular fashion. Their strength comes from their ability to create very complex tasks composed of simple tasks, without worrying how the simple tasks are implemented. BTs present some similarities to [[State machine|hierarchical state machines]] with the key difference that the main building block of a behavior is a task rather than a state. Its ease of human understanding make BTs less error prone and very popular in the game developer community. BTs have been shown to generalize several other control architectures.&lt;ref name = "Colledanchise TRO16"&gt;Colledanchise Michele, and Ögren Petter 2016.

BTs originate from the computer game industry as a powerful tool to [[Behavior model|model the behavior]] of [[non-player character]]s (NPCs).&lt;ref name = "Damian Isla"&gt;Isla D. 2005.

== Relation to other Control Architectures ==
It has been shown that BTs generalize a number of earlier control architectures, such as
* The [[subsumption architecture|Subsumption Architecture]] by Brooks &lt;ref name = "colledanchise2"/&gt; 
* The Teleo-Reactive Programs by  [[Nils John Nilsson]] &lt;ref name = "colledanchise3"&gt;Colledanchise, Michele and Ögren Petter. "How Behavior Trees Generalize

* Sequential Behavior Decompositions &lt;ref name = "colledanchise2"/&gt;
* [[Decision Tree]]

== Key concepts ==

BT is graphically represented as a directed  [[Tree (set theory)|tree]] in which the nodes are classified as root, control flow nodes, or execution nodes (tasks). For each pair of connected nodes the outgoing node is called parent and the incoming node is called child. The root has no parents and exactly one child, the control flow nodes have one parent and at least one child, and the execution nodes have one parent and no children. Graphically, the children of a control flow node are placed below it, ordered from left to right.&lt;ref name = "craft ai"&gt;craft ai 2015. [http://www.craft.ai/blog/bt-101-behavior-trees-grammar-basics/  BT 101 – Behavior Trees grammar basics]&lt;/ref&gt;

The execution of a BT starts from the root which sends ticks with a certain frequency to its child. A tick is an enabling signal that allows the execution of a child. When the execution of a node in the BT is allowed, it returns to the parent a status '''running''' if its execution has not finished yet, '''success''' if it has achieved its goal, or '''failure''' otherwise.

=== Control flow node ===

A control flow node is used to control the subtasks of which it is composed. A control flow node may be either a selector (fallback) node or a sequence node. They run each of their subtasks in turn. When a subtask is completed and returns its status (success or failure), the control flow node decides whether to execute the next subtask or not.

==== Selector (fallback) node ====

[[File:Fallback in Behavior tree.png|thumb|right|Figure I. Graphical representation of a fallback composition of N tasks.]]

Fallback nodes are used to find and execute the first child that does not fail. A fallback node will return immediately with a status code of success or running when one of its children returns success or running (see Figure I and the pseudocode below). The children are ticked in order of importance, from left to right.

In pseudocode, the algorithm for a fallback composition is:

 1 '''for''' i from 1 to n '''do'''
 2     childstatus ← Tick(child(i))
 3     '''if''' childstatus = running
 4        '''return''' running
 5     '''else if''' childstatus = success
 6        '''return''' success
 7 '''end'''
 8 '''return''' failure

==== Sequence node ====

[[File:Sequence composition in behaviour trees.png|thumb|right|Figure II. Graphical representation of a sequence composition of N tasks.]]
Sequence nodes are used to find and execute the first child that has not yet succeeded. A sequence node will return immediately with a status code of failure or running when one of its children returns failure or running (see Figure II and the pseudocode below). The children are ticked in order, from left to right.

In pseudocode, the algorithm for a sequence composition is:

 1 '''for''' i from 1 to n '''do'''
 2     childstatus ← Tick(child(i))
 3     '''if''' childstatus = running
 4        '''return''' running
 5     '''else if''' childstatus = failure
 6        '''return''' failure
 7 '''end'''
 8 '''return''' success

== Mathematical state space definition ==

In order to apply control theory tools to the analysis of Behavior Trees,
BT can be  defined as three-tuple.&lt;ref name="colledanchise2"&gt;Colledanchise Michele, and Ögren Petter.[http://www.csc.kth.se/~miccol/Michele_Colledanchise/Publications_files/IROS14_CO.pdf "How Behavior Trees Modularize Robustness and Safety in Hybrid Systems." In Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2014 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on, IEEE, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
 T_i=\{f_i,r_i, \Delta t\}, 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; i\in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the index of the tree, &lt;math&gt;f_i: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow  \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is a vector field representing the right hand side of an ordinary difference equation, &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; is a time step and 
&lt;math&gt;r_i: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow  \{R_i,S_i,F_i\}&lt;/math&gt; is the return status, that can be equal to either 
Running &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;,
Success &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt;, or
Failure &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Note''': A task is degenerate BT with no parent and no child.

=== Behavior tree execution ===

The execution of a BT is described by the following standard ordinary difference equations:

&lt;math&gt;x_{k+t}(t_{k+1})=f_i( x_{k}(t_{k}))  &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;t_{k+1}=t_{k}+\Delta t &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; k\in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; represent the discrete time, and  &lt;math&gt; x \in \mathbb{R}^n  &lt;/math&gt; is the state space of the system modelled by the behavior tree.

=== Fallback composition ===

Two BTs &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_j&lt;/math&gt; can be composed into a more complex BT &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; using a Fallback operator.

&lt;math&gt;T_0=\mbox{fallback}(T_i,T_j).&lt;/math&gt;

Then return status &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; and the vector field &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt; associated with &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; are defined as follows:

&lt;math&gt;
r_0(x_k) = 
\begin{cases}
r_j(x_k) &amp; \text{ if } x_k \in \mathcal{F}_1\\
r_i(x_k) &amp; \text{ otherwise }.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
f_0(x_k) = 
\begin{cases}
f_j(x_k) &amp; \text{ if } x_k \in \mathcal{F}_1\\
f_i(x_k) &amp; \text{ otherwise }.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Sequence composition ===

Two BTs &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_j&lt;/math&gt; can be composed into a more complex BT &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; using a Sequence operator.

&lt;math&gt;T_0=\mbox{sequence}(T_i,T_j).&lt;/math&gt;

Then return status &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; and the vector field &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt; associated with &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; are defined as follows:

&lt;math&gt;
r_0(x_k) = 
\begin{cases}
r_j(x_k) &amp; \text{ if } x_k \in \mathcal{S}_1\\
r_i(x_k) &amp; \text{ otherwise }.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
f_0(x_k) = 
\begin{cases}
f_j(x_k) &amp; \text{ if } x_k \in \mathcal{S}_1\\
f_i(x_k) &amp; \text{ otherwise }.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Blame''' is the act of [[censuring]], holding responsible, making negative statements about an individual or group that their action or actions are socially or morally irresponsible, the opposite of [[praise]].  When someone is [[morally responsible]] for doing something wrong their action is blameworthy. By contrast, when someone is morally responsible for doing something right, we may say that his or her action is [[praise]]worthy. There are other senses of praise and blame that are not ethically relevant. One may praise someone's good dress sense, and blame their own sense of style for their own dress sense.

== Neurology ==
Blaming appears to relate to include brain activity in the [[temporoparietal junction]] (TPJ).&lt;ref&gt;

==Sociology and psychology==
Humans - consciously and unconsciously - constantly make [[judgments]] about other people. The psychological criteria for judging others may be partly ingrained,{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} negative and rigid indicating some degree of [[grandiosity]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Blaming provides a way of devaluing others, with the end result that the blamer feels superior, seeing others as less worthwhile making the blamer "perfect". Off-loading blame means putting the other person down by emphasizing his or her flaws.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, N.W., ''Coping With Infuriating, Mean, Critical People – The Destructive Narcissistic Pattern'' (2006)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Victims of [[psychological manipulation|manipulation]] and [[abuse]] frequently feel responsible for causing negative feelings in the manipulator/abuser towards them and the resultant [[anxiety]] in themselves. This self-blame often becomes a major feature of [[victim mentality|victim status]].

The victim gets trapped into a [[self-image]] of [[victimization]]. The psychological profile of victimization includes a pervasive sense of helplessness, passivity, loss of control, pessimism, negative thinking, strong feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[shame]], [[remorse]], self-blame and [[depression (mood)|depression]]. This way of thinking can lead to hopelessness and despair.&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;
Braiker, H.B., ''Who's Pulling Your Strings? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation'' (2006)
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-blame===
Two main types of [[self-blame (psychology)|self-blame]] exist:

# '''behavioral self-blame'''&amp;nbsp;– undeserved blame based on actions. Victims who experience behavioral self-blame feel that they should have done something differently, and therefore feel at fault.
# '''characterological self-blame'''&amp;nbsp;– undeserved blame based on character. Victims who experience characterological self-blame feel there is something inherently wrong with them which has caused them to deserve to be victimized.

Behavioral self-blame is associated with feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] within the victim. While the belief that one had control during the abuse (past control) is associated with greater psychological distress, the belief that one has more control during the recovery process (present control) is associated with less distress, less withdrawal, and more cognitive reprocessing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frazier | first1 = P.A. | last2 = Mortensen | first2 = H. | last3 = Steward | first3 = J. | year = 2005 | title = Coping Strategies as Mediators of the Relations Among Perceived Control and Distress in Sexual Assault Survivors | url = | journal = Journal of Counseling Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 3| pages = 267–78 | doi=10.1037/0022-0167.52.3.267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Counseling responses found helpful in reducing self-blame include:&lt;ref&gt;
Matsushita-Arao, Y. (1997). Self-blame and depression among forcible rape survivors. ''Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering''. 57(9-B). p. 5925.&lt;/ref&gt;

* supportive responses
* psychoeducational responses (learning about [[rape trauma syndrome]] for example)
* responses addressing the issue of blame.

A helpful type of therapy for self-blame is [[cognitive restructuring]] or [[cognitive–behavioral therapy]]. Cognitive reprocessing is the process of taking the facts and forming a logical conclusion from them that is less influenced by shame or guilt.&lt;ref&gt;
Branscombe, N.R.; Wohl, M.J.A.; Owen, S.; Allison, J.A.; N'gbala, A. (2003). Counterfactual Thinking, Blame Assignment, and Well-Being in Rape Victims. ''Basic &amp; Applied Social Psychology'', 25(4), p. 265, 9p.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victim blaming===
{{main article|Victim blaming}}
Victim blaming is holding the victims of a [[crime]], an [[accident]], or any type of [[abusive]] maltreatment to be entirely or partially [[moral responsibility|responsible]] for the incident that has occurred.

===Individual blame versus system blame===
In sociology [[individual blame]] is the tendency of a group or society to hold the individual responsible for his or her situation, whereas [[system blame]] is the tendency to focus on social factors that contribute to one's fate. 

===Blame shifting===
{{See also|Buck passing}}
Blaming others can lead to a "[[kick the dog]]" effect where individuals in a [[hierarchy]] blame their immediate subordinate, and this propagates down a hierarchy until the lowest rung (the "dog"). A 2009 experimental study has shown that blaming can be contagious even for uninvolved onlookers.&lt;ref&gt;
Jeanna Bryner: [http://livescience.com/culture/blame-contagious-100119.html Workplace Blame Is Contagious and Detrimental], [[LiveScience]], 2010-01-19, citing the January 2010 issue of the ''[[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]]''.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a propaganda technique===
[[Labeling theory]] accounts for blame by postulating that when intentional actors act out to continuously blame an individual for nonexistent psychological traits and for nonexistent variables, those actors aim to induce irrational [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] at an unconscious level. Blame in this case becomes a [[propaganda]] tactic, using repetitive blaming behaviors, [[innuendos]], and [[hyperbole]] in order to assign negative status to normative humans. When innocent people are blamed fraudulently for nonexistent psychological states and nonexistent behaviors, and there is no qualifying deviance for the blaming behaviors, the intention is to create a negative valuation of innocent humans to induce fear, by using [[fear mongering]]. For centuries, governments have used blaming in the form of [[demonization]] to influence public perceptions of various other governments, to induce feelings of [[nationalism]] in the public. Blame can [[objectify]] people, groups, and nations, typically negatively influencing the intended subjects of propaganda, compromising their objectivity.{{Citation needed|reason=Cannot determine the source of objectification in a propaganda context|date=July 2018}} Blame is utilized as a [[social control|social-control]] technique.{{Citation needed|reason=Blame is not mentioned in the linked article, cannot determine source|date=July 2018}}

=== In organizations ===
{{See also|Kiss up kick down}}
Some [[systems theory|systems theorists]] and [[management consultant]]s, such as [[Gerald Weinberg]], see the flow of blame in an [[organization]] as one of the most important indicators of that organization's robustness and integrity. Blame flowing upwards in a [[Hierarchical organization|hierarchy]], Weinberg argues, proves that superiors can take [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] for their orders to their inferiors, and supply them with the resources required to do their jobs. But blame flowing downwards, from management to staff, or laterally between professionals, indicate organizational failure. In a blame culture, problem-solving is replaced by blame-avoidance. Weinberg emphasizes that blame coming from the top generates "fear, malaise, errors, accidents, and [[passive-aggressive]] responses from the bottom", with those at the bottom feeling powerless and lacking emotional safety.&lt;ref&gt;
Gerald M. Weinberg: [http://www.ayeconference.com/beyondblaming/ ''Beyond Blaming''], March 5, 2006, AYE Conference&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''no-blame culture'' has been widely{{quantify|date=May 2014}} considered as a means to increase [[safety]], in particular in areas where the consideration of possible [[human error]] is important, for instance in hospitals and in aviation. Together with questions of [[accountability]], this has also been subsumed under the concept of creating a ''Just culture''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [https://www.academia.edu/1035403/Medical_regulation_spectacular_transparency_and_the_blame_business research] conducted by [[King's College London]] found that increasing transparency and regulation in health care had unintended consequences of increasing defensive practice.  Linked to rare but high-profile scandals, a self-interested blame business was found to be increasing a presumption of "guilty until proven innocent"&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Brother's Keeper''''' is a 1992 [[Documentary film|documentary]] directed by [[Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky]].  The film is about an alleged 1990 murder in the village of [[Munnsville, New York|Munnsville]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The film is in the "[[Direct Cinema]]" style of the [[Albert and David Maysles|Maysles brothers]], who had formerly employed Berlinger and Sinofsky. 

The film contrasts two groups of society; people from rural areas and those from larger cities. It also exhibits how the media flocked to the town to cover the story.

This movie displays two completely opposite views of the Ward brothers. One opinion is that of the locals, who defend the Ward brothers as simple country folk. The other is that of the press, who stereotype the brothers as uneducated hicks.

The Ward sister was not featured in this film because of her death in the 1980s. However, her daughter Pat makes an appearance in the DVD's special features.

==The Ward brothers==
In a rural farming community near [[Syracuse, New York]], four brothers lived in a dilapidated house.  The brothers were Roscoe (July 23, 1919 - June 23, 2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roscoe Ward|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=18743511|website=Find a Grave|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Lyman George (July 7, 1923 - August 15, 2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lyman George Ward|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=18743563|website=Find a Grave|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, William Jay (July 10, 1926 - June 6, 1990)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William Jay Ward|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=18743654|website=Find a Grave|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Adelbert Daniel (known as Delbert) (October 5, 1931 - August 6, 1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adelbert Daniel "Delbert" Ward|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=18743603|website=Find a Grave|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The men were barely literate, had no formal education, and farmed land that had been in their family for generations.

==William's death==
William Ward, who had been ill for years, was found dead one morning.  Delbert was accused of killing him, perhaps by smothering. The prosecution's theory at trial was that Delbert had performed a [[mercy killing]] in order to put William out of his misery after a period of severe headaches and declining health. As the film progresses, it is revealed that during the coroner's examination of William's body, [[semen]] was found on clothing and on William's leg, leading to the suggestion that Delbert had killed William in an episode of "sex gone bad." The film never follows up on this media sensation.

Delbert Ward was acquitted at trial, largely because the lack of any physical evidence and that the [[New York State Police]] violated Delbert's rights by coercing a confession (which he later retracted) and by having him sign a written statement which he could not understand due to illiteracy.

==The brothers' fates==
Delbert Ward died at age 68 at Bassett Hospital in [[Cooperstown, New York]] on August 6, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rootsweb.com/~nymadiso/bit-of-past/borg/moadwar1.htm Adelbert Ward obituary]. Rootsweb.com. Retrieved on 2011-06-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computational neuroscience''' (also known as '''theoretical neuroscience''' or '''mathematical neuroscience''') is a branch of&amp;nbsp;[[neuroscience]]&amp;nbsp;which employs mathematical models, theoretical analysis and abstractions of the brain to understand the principles that govern the&amp;nbsp;[[Developmental neuroscience|development]],&amp;nbsp;[[Neuroanatomy|structure]], [[Neurophysiology|physiology]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Cognitive neuroscience|cognitive abilities]]&amp;nbsp;of the&amp;nbsp;[[nervous system]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Computational Neuroscience|last=Trappenberg|first=Thomas P.|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|year=2002|isbn=978-0-19-851582-1|location=United States|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;What is computational neuroscience?

Computational neuroscience focuses on the description of [[Biology|biologically]] plausible [[neuron]]s (and [[Nervous system|neural systems]]) and their physiology and dynamics, and it is therefore not concerned with biologically unrealistic disciplines such as [[connectionism]], [[machine learning]], [[artificial neural network]]s, [[artificial intelligence]] and [[computational learning theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encephalos.gr/48-1-01e.htm|title=Encephalos Journal|website=www.encephalos.gr|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zorzi|first=Marco|last2=Testolin|first2=Alberto|last3=Stoianov|first3=Ivilin P.|date=2013-08-20|title=Modeling language and cognition with deep unsupervised learning: a tutorial overview|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00515|issn=1664-1078|pmc=3747356|pmid=23970869}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e953/59bc80e624a963a3d8c943e3b2898a397ef7.pdf|title=Organismically-inspired robotics: homeostatic adaptation and teleology beyond the closed sensorimotor loop|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pPv0STSos8C&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=%22biological+realism%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22biological%20realism%22&amp;f=false|title=Connectionism in Perspective|last=Pfeifer|first=R.|last2=Schreter|first2=Z.|last3=Fogelman-Soulié|first3=F.|last4=Steels|first4=L.|date=1989-08-23|publisher=Elsevier|year=|isbn=9780444598769|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&amp;context=comparativephilosophy|title=ANALYTIC AND CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shai|first=Adam|last2=Larkum|first2=Matthew Evan|date=2017-12-05|title=Branching into brains|url=https://elifesciences.org/articles/33066|journal=eLife|language=en|volume=6|doi=10.7554/eLife.33066|issn=2050-084X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-02-22|title=Turing centenary: Is the brain a good model for machine intelligence?|url=https://doi.org/10.1038/482462a|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=482|issue=7386|pages=462–463|doi=10.1038/482462a|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uV9TZzOITMwC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=%22biological%20plausibility%22&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q=%22biological%20plausibility%22&amp;f=false|title=Neural Network Perspectives on Cognition and Adaptive Robotics|last=Browne|first=A.|date=1997-01-01|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780750304559|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, computational neuroscience would be a sub-field of theoretical neuroscience which employs computational simulations to validate and solve the mathematical models. However, since the biologically plausible mathematical models formulated in neuroscience are in most cases too complex to be solved analytically, the two terms are essentially synonyms and are used interchangeably.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The term mathematical neuroscience is also used sometimes, to stress the quantitative nature of the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gutkin|first=Boris|last2=Pinto|first2=David|last3=Ermentrout|first3=Bard|date=March 2003|title=Mathematical neuroscience: from neurons to circuits to systems|journal=Journal of Physiology, Paris|volume=97|issue=2-3|pages=209–219|doi=10.1016/j.jphysparis.2003.09.005|issn=0928-4257|pmid=14766142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematical models formulated in computational neuroscience are useful since they capture the essential features of the biological system at multiple spatial-temporal scales, from membrane currents, proteins, and chemical coupling to [[neural oscillation|network oscillations]], columnar and topographic architecture, and learning and memory. Furthermore, these computational models frame hypotheses that can be directly tested by biological or psychological experiments.

==History==

The term 'computational neuroscience' was introduced by [[Eric L. Schwartz]], who organized a conference, held in 1985 in [[Carmel, California]], at the request of the Systems Development Foundation to provide a summary of the current status of a field which until that point was referred to by a variety of names, such as neural modeling, brain theory and neural networks. The proceedings of this definitional meeting were published in 1990 as the book ''Computational Neuroscience''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schwartz, Eric |title=Computational neuroscience |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |year=1990 |pages= |isbn=0-262-19291-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first open international meeting focused on Computational Neuroscience was organized by [[James M. Bower]]  and John Miller in [[San Francisco, California]] in 1989 and has continued each year since as the annual CNS meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bower, James M. |title=20 years of Computational neuroscience |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin, Germany |year=2013 |isbn=978-1461414230}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first graduate educational program in computational neuroscience was organized as the Computational and Neural Systems Ph.D. program at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1985.

The early historical roots of the field can be traced to the work of people such as [[Louis Lapicque]], [[Alan Hodgkin|Hodgkin]] &amp; [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley]], [[David H. Hubel|Hubel]] &amp; [[Torsten Wiesel|Wiesel]], and [[David Marr (psychologist)|David Marr]], to name a few. Lapicque introduced the [[integrate and fire]] model of the neuron in a seminal article published in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lapicque L |title= Recherches quantitatives sur l'excitation électrique des nerfs traitée comme une polarisation |journal=J. Physiol. Pathol. Gen. |volume=9 |pages=620–635 |year=1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model is still popular today for [[artificial neural network]]s studies because of its simplicity (see a recent review&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brunel N, Van Rossum MC |title= Lapicque's 1907 paper: from frogs to integrate-and-fire |journal=Biol. Cybern. |volume=97 |pages=337–339 |year=2007 |pmid=17968583 |doi=10.1007/s00422-007-0190-0 |issue=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

About 40 years later, Hodgkin &amp; Huxley developed the [[voltage clamp]] and created the first biophysical model of the [[action potential]]. Hubel &amp; Wiesel discovered that neurons in the [[primary visual cortex]], the first cortical area to process information coming from the [[retina]], have oriented receptive fields and are organized in columns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hubel DH, Wiesel TN |title=Receptive fields, binocular interaction and functional architecture in the cat's visual cortex |journal=J. Physiol. |volume=160 |pages=106–54 |year=1962 |pmid=14449617 |pmc=1359523 |doi= 10.1113/jphysiol.1962.sp006837|url=http://www.jphysiol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14449617 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Marr's work focused on the interactions between neurons, suggesting computational approaches to the study of how functional groups of neurons within the [[hippocampus]] and [[neocortex]] interact, store, process, and transmit information. Computational modeling of biophysically realistic neurons and dendrites began with the work of [[Wilfrid Rall]], with the first multicompartmental model using [[cable theory]].

==Major topics==
Research in computational neuroscience can be roughly categorized into several lines of inquiry. Most computational neuroscientists collaborate closely with experimentalists in analyzing novel data and synthesizing new models of biological phenomena.

===Single-neuron modeling===
{{main|Biological neuron models}}
Even single neurons have complex biophysical characteristics and can perform computations (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Forrest MD |title=Intracellular Calcium Dynamics Permit a Purkinje Neuron Model to Perform Toggle and Gain Computations Upon its Inputs. |journal=Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience |volume=8 |pages=86 |year=2014 | doi=10.3389/fncom.2014.00086 | url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fncom.2014.00086/full |pmid=25191262 |pmc=4138505}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Hodgkin and Huxley's [[Hodgkin–Huxley model|original model]] only employed two voltage-sensitive currents (Voltage sensitive ion channels are glycoprotein molecules which extend through the lipid bilayer, allowing ions to traverse under certain conditions through the axolemma), the fast-acting sodium and the inward-rectifying potassium. Though successful in predicting the timing and qualitative features of the action potential, it nevertheless failed to predict a number of important features such as adaptation and [[shunting]]. Scientists now believe that there are a wide variety of voltage-sensitive currents, and the implications of the differing dynamics, modulations, and sensitivity of these currents is an important topic of computational neuroscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wu, Samuel Miao-sin |author2=Johnston, Daniel |title=Foundations of cellular neurophysiology |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |year=1995 |isbn=0-262-10053-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The computational functions of complex [[dendrites]] are also under intense investigation. There is a large body of literature regarding how different currents interact with geometric properties of neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Koch, Christof |title=Biophysics of computation: information processing in single neurons |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1999 |isbn=0-19-510491-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some models are also tracking biochemical pathways at very small scales such as spines or synaptic clefts.

There are many software packages, such as  [[GENESIS (software)|GENESIS]] and [[Neuron (software)|NEURON]], that allow rapid and systematic ''in silico'' modeling of realistic neurons. [[Blue Brain]], a project founded by [[Henry Markram]] from the [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]], aims to construct a biophysically detailed simulation of a [[cortical column]] on the [[Blue Gene]] [[supercomputer]].

Modeling the richness of biophysical properties on the single-neuron scale can supply mechanisms that serve as the building blocks for network dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Forrest MD|year=2014|title=Intracellular Calcium Dynamics Permit a Purkinje Neuron Model to Perform Toggle and Gain Computations Upon its Inputs.|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fncom.2014.00086/full|journal=Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience|volume=8|pages=86|doi=10.3389/fncom.2014.00086|pmc=4138505|pmid=25191262}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, detailed neuron descriptions are computationally expensive and this can handicap the pursuit of realistic network investigations, where many neurons need to be simulated. As a result, researchers that study large neural circuits typically represent each neuron and synapse with an artificially simple model, ignoring much of the biological detail. Hence there is a drive to produce simplified neuron models that can retain significant biological fidelity at a low computational overhead. Algorithms have been developed to produce faithful, faster running, simplified surrogate neuron models from computationally expensive, detailed neuron models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Forrest MD |title=Simulation of alcohol action upon a detailed Purkinje neuron model and a simpler surrogate model that runs &gt;400 times faster |journal= BMC Neuroscience | volume=16 |issue=27 | date=April  2015 |doi=10.1186/s12868-015-0162-6 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/16/27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development, axonal patterning, and guidance===
Computational neuroscience aims to address a wide array of questions. How do [[axons]] and [[dendrites]] form during development? How do axons know where to target and how to reach these targets? How do neurons migrate to the proper position in the central and peripheral systems? How do synapses form? We know from [[molecular biology]] that distinct parts of the nervous system release distinct chemical cues, from [[growth factors]] to [[hormones]] that modulate and influence the growth and development of functional connections between neurons.

Theoretical investigations into the formation and patterning of synaptic connection and morphology are still nascent. One hypothesis that has recently garnered some attention is the ''minimal wiring hypothesis'', which postulates that the formation of axons and dendrites effectively minimizes resource allocation while maintaining maximal information storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chklovskii DB, Mel BW, Svoboda K |title=Cortical rewiring and information storage |journal=Nature |volume=431 |issue=7010 |pages=782–8 |date=October 2004|pmid=15483599 |doi=10.1038/nature03012 |bibcode = 2004Natur.431..782C }}&lt;br/&gt;Review article&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensory processing===
Early models of sensory processing understood within a theoretical framework are credited to [[Horace Barlow]]. Somewhat similar to the minimal wiring hypothesis described in the preceding section, Barlow understood the processing of the early sensory systems to be a form of  [[efficient coding hypothesis|efficient coding]], where the neurons encoded information which minimized the number of spikes. Experimental and computational work have since supported this hypothesis in one form or another.

Current research in sensory processing is divided among a biophysical modelling of different subsystems and a more theoretical modelling of perception. Current models of perception have suggested that the brain performs some form of [[Bayesian approaches to brain function|Bayesian inference]] and integration of different sensory information in generating our perception of the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weiss|first1=Yair|last2=Simoncelli|first2=Eero P.|last3=Adelson|first3=Edward H.|title=Motion illusions as optimal percepts|journal=Nature Neuroscience|date=20 May 2002|volume=5|issue=6|pages=598–604|doi=10.1038/nn0602-858}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ernst|first1=Marc O.|last2=Bülthoff|first2=Heinrich H.|title=Merging the senses into a robust percept|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=April 2004|volume=8|issue=4|pages=162–169|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2004.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memory and synaptic plasticity===
{{main|Synaptic plasticity}}
Earlier models of [[memory]] are primarily based on the postulates of [[Hebbian learning]]. Biologically relevant models such as  [[Hopfield net]] have been developed to address the properties of associative (also known as "content-addressable") style of memory that occur in biological systems. These attempts are primarily focusing on the formation of medium- and [[long-term memory]], localizing in the [[hippocampus]]. Models of [[working memory]], relying on theories of network oscillations and persistent activity, have been built to capture some features of the prefrontal cortex in context-related memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Durstewitz D, Seamans JK, Sejnowski TJ |title=Neurocomputational models of working memory |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=3 |issue=Suppl |pages=1184–91 |year=2000 |pmid=11127836 |doi=10.1038/81460 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major problems in neurophysiological memory is how it is maintained and changed through multiple time scales. Unstable [[synapses]] are easy to train but also prone to stochastic disruption. Stable  [[synapses]] forget less easily, but they are also harder to consolidate. One recent computational hypothesis involves cascades of plasticity that allow synapses to function at multiple time scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fusi S, Drew PJ, Abbott LF |title=Cascade models of synaptically stored memories |journal=Neuron |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=599–611 |year=2005 |pmid=15721245 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2005.02.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereochemically detailed models of the [[acetylcholine receptor]]-based synapse with the [[Monte Carlo method]], working at the time scale of microseconds, have been built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Coggan JS, Bartol TM, Esquenazi E |title=Evidence for ectopic neurotransmission at a neuronal synapse |journal=Science |volume=309 |issue=5733 |pages=446–51 |year=2005 |pmid=16020730 |pmc=2915764 |doi=10.1126/science.1108239 |bibcode = 2005Sci...309..446C |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that computational tools will contribute greatly to our understanding of how synapses function and change in relation to external stimulus in the coming decades.

===Behaviors of networks===
Biological neurons are connected to each other in a complex, recurrent fashion. These connections are, unlike most [[artificial neural networks]], sparse and usually specific.  It is not known how information is transmitted through such sparsely connected networks, although specific areas of the brain, such as the [[Visual cortex]], are understood in some detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olshausen|first=Bruno A.|last2=Field|first2=David J.|date=1997-12-01|title=Sparse coding with an overcomplete basis set: A strategy employed by V1?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698997001697|journal=Vision Research|volume=37|issue=23|pages=3311–3325|doi=10.1016/S0042-6989(97)00169-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also unknown what the computational functions of these specific connectivity patterns are, if any.

The interactions of neurons in a small network can be often reduced to simple models such as the [[Ising model]]. The [[statistical mechanics]] of such simple systems are well-characterized theoretically. There has been some recent evidence that suggests that dynamics of arbitrary neuronal networks can be reduced to pairwise interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schneidman E, Berry MJ, Segev R, Bialek W |title=Weak pairwise correlations imply strongly correlated network states in a neural population |journal=Nature |volume=440 |issue=7087 |pages=1007–12 |year=2006 |pmid=16625187 |pmc=1785327 |doi=10.1038/nature04701 |bibcode=2006Natur.440.1007S|arxiv = q-bio/0512013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known, however, whether such descriptive dynamics impart any important computational function. With the emergence of [[two-photon microscopy]] and [[calcium imaging]], we now have powerful experimental methods with which to test the new theories regarding neuronal networks.

In some cases the complex interactions between ''inhibitory'' and ''excitatory'' neurons can be simplified using [[mean field theory]], which gives rise to the [[Wilson-Cowan model|population model]] of neural networks. While many neurotheorists prefer such models with reduced complexity, others argue that uncovering structural functional relations depends on including as much neuronal and network structure as possible. Models of this type are typically built in large simulation platforms like GENESIS or NEURON. There have been some attempts to provide unified methods that bridge and integrate these levels of complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Anderson, Charles H. |author2=Eliasmith, Chris |title=Neural Engineering: Computation, Representation, and Dynamics in Neurobiological Systems (Computational Neuroscience) |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-262-55060-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognition, discrimination, and learning===
Computational modeling of higher cognitive functions has only recently{{When|date=February 2016}} begun. Experimental data comes primarily from [[single-unit recording]] in [[primates]].  The [[frontal lobe]] and [[parietal lobe]] function as integrators of information from multiple sensory modalities. There are some tentative ideas regarding how simple mutually inhibitory functional circuits in these areas may carry out biologically relevant computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Machens CK, Romo R, Brody CD |title=Flexible control of mutual inhibition: a neural model of two-interval discrimination |journal=Science |volume=307 |issue=5712 |pages=1121–4 |year=2005 |pmid=15718474 |doi=10.1126/science.1104171 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307.1121M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[brain]] seems to be able to discriminate and adapt particularly well in certain contexts. For instance, human beings seem to have an enormous capacity for memorizing and [[face perception|recognizing faces]]. One of the key goals of computational neuroscience is to dissect how biological systems carry out these complex computations efficiently and potentially replicate these processes in building intelligent machines.

The brain's large-scale organizational principles are illuminated by many fields, including biology, psychology, and clinical practice. [[Integrative neuroscience]] attempts to consolidate these observations through unified descriptive models and databases of behavioral measures and recordings. These are the bases for some quantitative modeling of large-scale brain activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robinson PA, Rennie CJ, Rowe DL, O'Connor SC, Gordon E | title=Multiscale brain modelling | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B | volume=360 | issue=1457|pages=1043–1050|year=2005|doi=10.1098/rstb.2005.1638 |pmid=16087447 |pmc=1854922 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Computational Representational Understanding of Mind ([[CRUM]]) is another attempt at modeling human cognition through simulated processes like acquired rule-based systems in decision making and the manipulation of visual representations in decision making.

===Consciousness===
One of the ultimate goals of psychology/neuroscience is to be able to explain the everyday experience of conscious life. [[Francis Crick]] and [[Christof Koch]] made some attempts to formulate a consistent framework for future work in [[neural correlates of consciousness]] (NCC), though much of the work in this field remains speculative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Crick F, Koch C |title=A framework for consciousness |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=119–26 |year=2003 |pmid=12555104 |doi=10.1038/nn0203-119|url= https://zenodo.org/record/852680 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational clinical neuroscience===
[[Computational Clinical Neuroscience]] is a field that brings together experts in neuroscience, [[neurology]], [[psychiatry]], [[decision sciences]] and computational modeling to quantitatively define and investigate problems in [[neurological disorders|neurological]] and [[mental disorders|psychiatric diseases]], and to train scientists and clinicians that wish to apply these models to diagnosis and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Adaszewski S1, Dukart J, Kherif F, Frackowiak R, Draganski B; Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative|title=How early can we predict Alzheimer's disease using computational anatomy?|journal=Neurobiol Aging |volume=34 |issue=12 |pages=2815–26 |year=2013 |doi=10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2013.06.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Friston KJ, Stephan KE, Montague R, Dolan RJ |title=Computational psychiatry: the brain as a phantastic organ |journal=Lancet Psychiatry |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=148–58 |year=2014 |doi=10.1016/S2215-0366(14)70275-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Covenant Group.jpg|thumb|300px|Clockwise from left: a Covenant Hunter, Brute, Jackals, and Grunts as they appear in ''[[Halo 3]]'' (2007).]]

The '''Covenant''' are a fictional theocratic military alliance of alien races who serve as the main antagonists in the first trilogy of the [[Halo (series)|''Halo'']] video game series.  They are composed of a variety of diverse species, united under the religious worship of the [[Forerunner (Halo)|Forerunners]] and their belief that Forerunner ringworlds known as [[Halo (megastructure)|Halos]] will provide a path to salvation. After the Covenant leadership—the [[Characters of Halo#High Prophets|High Prophets]]—declare humanity an affront to their gods, claiming the extermination of [humanity] is the 'will of their gods and [the Covenant] are [the gods'] instrument', the more advanced extraterrestrials subsequently prosecute a lengthy genocidal campaign against the technologically inferior human species.

The Covenant were first introduced in the 2001 video game ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' as enemies of the playable character, a human super soldier known as [[Master Chief (Halo)|the Master Chief]]. Not realizing the Halos were meant as weapons of destruction rather than salvation, the Covenant attempt to activate the rings on two separate occasions throughout the series, inadvertently releasing a virulent parasite known as the [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]] in the process.

To develop a distinctive look for the various species of the Covenant, [[Bungie]] artists drew inspiration from reptilian, ursine, and avian characteristics. A Covenant design scheme of purples and reflective surfaces was made to separate the alien from human architecture. The Covenant were generally well received by critics who appreciated the challenge they provided to players; several critics lamented the change of the main enemies from Elites to Brutes in ''Halo 3'' and conversely praised their return in the later ''Halo: Reach''.

==Game development==
Like most of the other characters and species in the ''Halo'' universe, the Covenant were slowly developed during the initial concept phase and refined as ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' progressed. During the course of development of ''Halo'', the designers decided upon three "schools" of architecture, for each of the races represented — the humans, the Covenant, and [[Forerunners (Halo)|the Forerunners]]. For the Covenant, the team decided on "sleek and shiny", with reflective surfaces, organic shapes, and use of purples.&lt;ref name=aoh86&gt;[[#art of halo|Trautmann (2004)]], 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the character designs, Covenant technology, architecture, and design continually changed throughout development, occasionally for practical reasons as well as aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;[[#art of halo|Trautmann (2004)]], 98.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eric Arroyo, the Covenant cruiser ''Truth and Reconciliation'', which plays a major role in ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', was to be boarded by the player by a long ramp. However, due to technical considerations of having a fully textured ship so close to the player, the designers came up with a "gravity lift", which allowed the ship to be farther away (thus not requiring as much processing power for detail) as well as adding a "visually interesting" component of Covenant technology.&lt;ref&gt;[[#art of halo|Trautmann]], 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The art team also spent a large amount of time on Covenant weaponry, in order to make them suitably alien yet still recognizable to players.&lt;ref&gt;[[#art of halo|Trautmann (2004)]], 125.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the designers wanted all aspects of Covenant technology, especially the vehicles, to act plausibly.&lt;ref&gt;[[#art of halo|Trautmann]], 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Bungie ended up looking at films and other media for inspiration on almost every aspect of the race.&lt;ref&gt;[[#art of halo|Trautmann (2004)]], 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Species===
[[File:Shieldandswordeq0.png|thumb|right|Covenant Elites as they appeared early in ''Halo''{{'}}s development.]]

To design the various species of the Covenant, [[Bungie]]'s artists looked at live animals and films for inspiration;&lt;ref name=aoh51&gt;[[#art of halo|Trautmann]], 51.&lt;/ref&gt; as a result, the species within the Covenant bear [[simian]], [[Reptile|reptilian]], [[Bird|avian]], and [[Bear|ursine]] characteristics.&lt;ref name=aoh51 /&gt;

====Elites (Sangheili)====

One of the strongest and toughest foes (and allies) of the games, Elites (who are from Sanghelios) are called Sangheili in the fictitious Covenant language. They stand around {{height|ft=8|in=0}} and feature recharging personal shields. The Elites initially had simple mouths, which developed into pairs of split mandibles substituting for the lower jaws. Bungie concept artist Shi Kai Wang noted that project lead [[Jason Jones (programmer)|Jason Jones]] had, at one point, been insistent on giving the Elites a tail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Trautmann|first=Eric|title=The Art of Halo|year= 2004|publisher= Del Ray Publishing|location=New York |isbn=0-345-47586-0 |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Wang thought it made the aliens look too animalistic, the idea was eventually dropped due to practical considerations, including where the tail would go when the Elites were driving vehicles.&lt;ref name=aoh38/&gt; "At one point, we considered just having the Elites tuck their tails forward, between their legs," Wang noted, "But [we] abandoned that... for obvious reasons."&lt;ref name=aoh38&gt;{{cite book |last= Trautmann|first=Eric|title=The Art of Halo|year= 2004|publisher= Del Ray Publishing|location=New York |isbn=0-345-47586-0 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Paul Russel, when Bungie was bought by Microsoft and ''Halo'' was turned into an Xbox launch title, Microsoft took issue with the design of the Elites, as they felt that the Elites had a resemblance to cats that might alienate [[Japan]]ese consumers.&lt;ref name="podcast-russell"&gt;{{cite video|people=Jarrard, Brian; Smith, Luke, &amp;c |date=2008-08-21 |title=Bungie Podcast: With Paul Russell and Jerome Simpson |url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/d/c/4dcc4b82-fee5-4570-b28f-b573a1ad1631/Bungie_Podcast_082108.mp3 |format=MP3 |medium=Podcast |publisher=[[Bungie]] |location=Kirkland, Washington |accessdate=2008-08-27 |time= |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203173816/http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/d/c/4dcc4b82-fee5-4570-b28f-b573a1ad1631/Bungie_Podcast_082108.mp3 |archivedate=2009-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grunts (Unggoy)====
Among the other races developed were Grunts, or Unggoy (from the planet Balaho), viewed in game's fiction as [[cannon fodder]]. Depicted as squat and cowardly fighters, Grunts generally break formation, panicking and fleeing in terror if a player or an [[Non-player character|NPC]] kills their commanding officer. However, they are also notable for attempting suicide runs against enemies on higher difficulties, charging at their foe with a plasma grenade in each hand in an attempt to kill the opponent and/ or themselves.

Unggoy are intelligent, having been industrialized before their induction into the Covenant. The novels ''Halo: Fall of Reach'' and ''Halo: The Flood'', described the Unggoy as dog-like [[methane]]-breathers. They are stocky, possessing both an [[arthropod]]-like [[exoskeleton]], and a spinal-based [[nervous system]]. Their powerful forearms evolved for climbing vertical terrain. Unggoy have methane suits that allow them to remove the breathing apparatuses they usually wear to sustain them in a non-methane atmosphere. In Halo Reach, if a player kills a Unggoy in a particular way, their methane tank will ignite causing them to fly and bounce around the area out of control, causing damage if they hit the player.&lt;ref name="ign-halo-review1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Boulding, Aaron|date=2001-11-09|url=http://xbox.ign.com/articles/165/165922p1.html|title=Halo: Combat Evolved Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jackals and Skirmishers (Kig-Yar)====

Jackals, or Kig-Yar, (from the moon of Eayn, orbiting [[HD 69830 d|Chu'ot]]) carry energy shields or ranged weaponry. Shield or armor colors denotes the rank of each caste. In some cases, such as with the Jackals, the overall design was honed once the enemy's role was clearly defined.&lt;ref&gt;Trautmann, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; They look like bird-like creatures or raptors. This particular species did not come into the Covenant in the same way as other species. They work as mercenaries, as their culture is based on piracy and do not follow the religious beliefs like the other species. In the ''Halo'' book, ''Halo: Contact Harvest'', it was revealed that Jackals were the first species in the Covenant to encounter humanity. The resulting events initiated the start of the Human-Covenant War.

====Hunters (Mgalekgolo)====

Hunters, or Mgalekgolo, (from the planet Te) are, according to Bungie's mythology, collectives of worm-like aliens, singularly known as Lekgolo, encased in tough armor.&lt;ref name="halo2races"&gt;Bungie (2004), 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Initial concepts were less humanoid-looking and softer than the final shape, with angular shields and razor-sharp spines.&lt;ref&gt;Trautmann, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The species are armed with a heavy plasma repeater cannon and also carry a massive shield.

====Engineers (Huragok)====

Floating, serene aliens known as Engineers, or Huragok, were pulled from ''Combat Evolved'', but made later appearances in the ''Halo'' novels. They also appeared in ''Halo Wars'', ''Halo 3: ODST'', and ''Halo: Reach''. They serve no actual combat role, although in ''Halo 3: ODST,'' ''Halo Wars'' and ''Halo Reach'' they can aid players or enemies. They are actually artificial lifeforms created by the vanished technologically superior race known as the Forerunners, and are enslaved by the Covenant to build, repair and maintain their technology.

====Prophets (San'Shyuum)====

The Prophets, or San'Shyuum, (from the planet Janjur Qom) serve as the royal rulers of the Covenant, and were primarily designed by Shi Kai Wang and Eric Arroyo. Originally, the Prophets were built in a more unified way, with the gravity thrones they used for flotation and movement fused with the Prophet's organic structures.&lt;ref name=aof55&gt;Trautmann, 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The characters were also designed to be feeble, yet sinister.&lt;ref name=aof55/&gt; The three Prophet Hierarchs were each individually designed.&lt;ref&gt;Trautmann, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brutes (Jiralhanae)====
Brutes (from the planet Doisac) are one of the new fighting forces that were added in ''Halo 2''. They were made physically taller and stronger than the Elites, with their society organized around tribal chieftains. Inspired by the animators watching biker films, the Brutes incorporated simian and ursine elements while retaining an alien look.&lt;ref&gt;Trautmann, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Wang's final concept for the creature, replete with bandoliers and human skulls, was simplified for the game.&lt;ref&gt;Trautmann, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Brutes were meant to typify the abusive alien menace of the Covenant and in the words of design lead Jaime Griesemer, to serve as "barbarians in Rome".&lt;ref name="et tu brute"&gt;{{cite video |people=|date=December 2006|title=ViDoc: Et Tu, Brute?|url=http://www.bungie.net/News/Media.aspx?mid=13858&amp;age_verify=1 |format= |medium= |publisher=[[Bungie]] |location= |accessdate=2009-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the final installment in the ''Halo'' trilogy, ''Halo 3'', designers had to refine the Covenant for the move to more powerful Xbox 360 hardware. Bungie was dissatisfied with the Brutes in ''Halo 2''; they were added in late in development, resulting in the Brutes functioning merely as "damage sponges" and "not interesting to fight." Their design was also limited, being little more than hairy apes with a [[bandoleer]] (reminiscent of the ''Star Wars'' character [[Chewbacca]]). With the Elites leaving the Covenant in the game's story, the Brutes became the player's main enemy, necessitating radical changes in the character's behavior and design. For the new look of the Brutes, concept artists took inspiration from rhinoceros and gorillas. The designers added armor with buckles, gauntlets, and leather straps to bring them more in line with the Covenant aesthetic. The more seasoned the Brute, the more ornate clothing and helmets; the armor was designed to convey a culture and tradition to the species, and emphasize their mass and power. Designs for ''Halo 3'' took cues from [[ancient Greek]] [[Sparta]]ns. Character animators recorded intended actions for the new Brutes in a padded room at Bungie. A new addition to the Brute artificial intelligence was a pack mentality; leader Brutes direct large-scale actions simultaneously, such as throwing grenades towards a player.

====Drones (Yanme'e)====

Another addition to the fighting force debuting in ''Halo 2'' were Drones, or Yanme'e (from the planet Palamok); the animators found the creatures challenging, as they had to be animated to walk, run, crawl, or fly on multiple surfaces. Old concept art from ''Combat Evolved'' was re-purposed in influencing the Drone's final shape, which took cues from cockroaches, grasshoppers, and wasps.&lt;ref name="aof55"/&gt;

===Society===

Technologically, the Covenant are described in ''[[Halo: The Flood|The Flood]]'' and ''[[Halo: First Strike|First Strike]]'' to be imitative rather than innovative—most of the Covenant's sophisticated weaponry and propulsion systems are based on Forerunner artifacts, rather than the Covenant's own research.&lt;ref&gt;[[#first strike|Nylund (2003)]], 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Covenant weapons are generally based on Forerunner technology and utilize [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. These weapons are built around a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] that generates plasma and discharges it at a target.&lt;ref&gt;Bungie (2004), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Frank O'Connor, Bungie's former public relations head, hinted that there may be something more to the Covenant's weaponry, saying "the actual technology is not plasma as we know it, but something far more dangerous, arcane, and destructive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=O'Conner, Frank|date=2006-09-18|url=http://carnage.bungie.org/haloforum/halo.forum.pl?read=743326|title=Frankie discusses the possibilities of the Covenant's weapons|publisher=[[Halo.Bungie.Org]]|accessdate=2007-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few of the Covenant's weapons are not plasma-based, including the Needler, which fires razor-sharp pink needles capable of "homing in" on organic foes and exploding. A weapons expert noted parallels between the Needler and ancient Greek Amazons painting their daggers pink as a psychological weapon in an issue of gaming magazine ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''.&lt;ref name="egm-needler"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Samoon, Evan|date=July 2008|title=Gun Show: A real military expert takes aim at videogame weaponry to reveal the good, the bad, and the just plain silly|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|volume=1|issue=230|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bungie designed the majority of Covenant technology to mirror the aesthetic of the Elites; the exteriors are sleek and graceful, with a more angular and complex core underneath hinting at the fictional Forerunner origins of the technology.&lt;ref&gt;de Govia, 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the sleek Elite-based designs of the Covenant at large, the Brutes were given their own visual design distinct from the other Covenant. Weaponry was designed to reflect the Brute's "souls" distilled to its purest form—conveyed by dangerous shapes, harsh colors, and objects that looked "dangerous to be around".&lt;ref&gt;de Govia, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; A UNSC weapon designed for ''Combat Evolved'' in 1999 that was discarded at the time was re-purposed as the Brute's "Mauler" weapon.&lt;ref&gt;de Govia, 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Covenant society is a [[caste]] system composed of many races, some of which were forcibly incorporated. Each race is required to provide a specific number of troops to remain within the Covenant.&lt;ref name="Beastiarum"&gt;{{cite video |title=Halo 3 Essentials [Disc 2]| medium=DVD|publisher=Microsoft|date=2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the games, the races are identified by their common [[United Nations Space Command|UNSC]] designation;&lt;ref name="halo2races"/&gt; their Covenant names are supplied by the "Halo 2" Limited Edition and "Halo 3" Limited Edition manuals and several novels.

==Appearances==

The majority of events in the story arc of the ''Halo'' series occur during the "Ninth Age of Reclamation." The Covenant's organization of time and dates is not elaborated on in detail in the game or during any of the novelizations; Bungie cinematic director [[Joseph Staten]], in an interview on ''Halo'' fansite [[Halo.Bungie.Org|halo.bungie.org]], said that the Covenant's date system is split into seven [[wikt:epoch|epochs]], split into the following Ages: Abandonment, Conflict, Discovery, Reconciliation, Conversion, Doubt, and Reclamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Staten, Joseph |author2=Claude Errera |date=2004-10-22|url=http://halosm.bungie.org/story/staten102204.html|title=Interview with Joe Staten, 10/22/2004|publisher=[[Halo.Bungie.Org]]|accessdate=February 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2001 and 2007 novels ''[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]'' and ''[[Halo: Contact Harvest]]'' describe humanity's first contact with the Covenant in the year 2525. In ''The Fall of Reach'', a lone Covenant ship bombards the Harvest colony with plasma, turning the planet's crust into molten glass. The lone ship, broadcasts the Covenant edict, "Your destruction is the will of the gods, and we are their instrument", and destroys several [[Factions of Halo#United Nations Space Command|United Nations Space Command]] (UNSC) ships sent to attack it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#fall of reach|Nylund (2001)]], 94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- xbox timeline --&gt; ''Contact Harvest'' describes a lengthy ground engagement between human militia and Covenant before the total assault on Harvest. The Covenant claim that humans are an offense to their gods, but in reality, three Covenant Prophets have learned from a relic left by their gods, the [[Factions of Halo#Forerunner|Forerunners]], that humans, who may possibly be genetically related to the Forerunners, have been chosen by the Forerunners as their Reclaimers. Realizing such a revelation would splinter the Covenant, the newly crowned Hierarchs decide to obliterate the humans instead and declare that a new Age of the Covenant has begun.&lt;ref&gt;[[#contact harvest|Staten (2007)]], 145-158.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Covenant's superior technology allow them to annihilate the outer human colonies within four years; the Covenant begin to destroy the inner colonies soon thereafter.&lt;ref name="Nylund 2001 127"&gt;{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]|year= 2001|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45132-5 |pages=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- halo timeline --&gt; As a defensive measure, the UNSC creates the "Cole Protocol"; human ships are prohibited from directly traveling to human worlds to avoid detection by the Covenant, and destruction of a ship's navigation databases and [[artificial intelligence]] if threatened with capture. In 2552, the Covenant track the UNSC ship ''Iroquois'' to the world of Reach, Earth's most well-defended colony, by a hidden transmitter. A massive Covenant fleet arrives at Reach and lays waste to much of the planet.

The Covenant's first appearance in the video games is in ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' (2001), which picks up towards the end of ''The Fall of Reach''. A detachment of Covenant follow the human vessel ''Pillar of Autumn'' from Reach to [[Halo (megastructure)#Installation 04|Halo]], a ring-shaped Forerunner relic that the Covenant believe sacred. Wary of accidentally damaging the ring,&lt;ref&gt;''[[#the flood|The Flood]]'', pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; the Covenant are forced to fight the humans on foot, and accidentally release the [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]]. The Flood, a virulent parasite that infests sentient life, attack human and Covenant alike and threaten to capture a Covenant cruiser to escape their prison on Halo. Meanwhile, the human "Spartan" supersoldier [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]] detonates the ''Pillar of Autumn{{'}}''s engines, destroying the ring and the Covenant armada. The novelization of the game, ''[[Halo: The Flood]]'' (2003), describes additional events not seen in the game. In the novel ''First Strike'', The Master Chief, survivors of the ''Autumn'' and surviving Spartans from Reach destroy a Covenant fleet they learn is preparing to strike Earth, and race home to warn of the impending attack.

In the video game ''[[Halo 2]]'' (2004), a member of the Covenant Prophet triumvirate, Regret, arrives at Earth with a fleet. Most of his fleet is destroyed; Regret's ship flees to another ring, [[Halo (megastructure)#Installation 05|Delta Halo]], and is followed by the human ship ''In Amber Clad'' and the Master Chief aboard her. The Chief kills Regret before the majority of the Covenant fleet arrives at Delta Halo, along with the Covenant's holy city of ''High Charity''. The death of Regret leads the remaining Prophets to promote the Brutes as their guards, replacing the Elites. The Elites, outraged, threaten to resign from the Covenant high council; in turn the Prophets give the Brutes ''carte blanche'' to kill the Elites, sparking a civil war. In the midst of these developments, the Flood are again released; the High Prophet Mercy is killed by the parasite, while the last remaining leader, Truth, flees to Earth in a Forerunner ship, entrusting the activation of Halo to the Brute [[Characters of Halo#Tartarus|Tartarus]]. The Elites ally with the humans of ''In Amber Clad'' to stop the firing of the ring, but inadvertently set all the remaining Halo rings to be remotely activated from a location known as the Ark, placed outside the range of the Halo Array to protect certain species from the firing of the Halo rings, built as a foundry for the rings including replacing any that get destroyed.

By the events of ''[[Halo 3]]'' (2007), the Flood intelligence known as the [[Gravemind]] infests and captures ''High Charity'', while the Elites assist humans on Earth in defending themselves. Truth's forces excavate a portal to the Ark, located outside the Milky Way. The Elites chase Truth, and the Covenant [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]] (a holy warrior) kills Truth ultimately ending the Covenant. After the Flood controlled ''High Charity'' arrives at the Ark, the Arbiter and Master Chief decide to activate a partially built Halo ring (the replacement for the ring that the Master Chief destroyed in the first game) destroying the Flood and sparing the rest of the galaxy. The remaining humans and Elites escape back through the portal. The Human-Covenant war ends in December 2552, and the Arbiter leads his Elites back to their homeworld.

A rogue splinter faction of the former Covenant were featured in ''[[Halo 4]]'' (2012),.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Halo Bulletin: 3.07.12|url=http://halo.xbox.com/blogs/Headlines/post/2012/03/08/The-Halo-Bulletin-30712.aspx|publisher=Official Halo Website|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group was led by the Elite Jul 'Mdama. This faction still follows the ideology of the old Covenant religion and seeks to find a powerful weapon on Requiem, the fictional planet on which the majority of ''Halo 4'' is set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ian|first=Cheong|title=Halo 4 OXM Feature Sheds Light on Rogue Covenant Faction|url=http://www.gameranx.com/updates/id/8350/article/halo-4-oxm-feature-sheds-light-on-rogue-covenant-faction/|publisher=Gameranx|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jul 'Mdama's faction also appears in Halo 5: Guardians, although they are not the game's main antagonists.

The Covenant made a cameo in ''[[Halo Wars 2]]'' with a flashback of how Atriox betrayed them and formed the Banished.

== Reception ==

The reception of the Covenant as enemies in ''Combat Evolved'' was generally favorable. The ability to experience the storyline of ''Halo 2'' from the Covenant perspective was described as a "brilliant stroke of game design". Allowing the player to assume the role of an Elite was described as providing an unexpected plot twist, and allowing the player to experience a "newfound complexity to the story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kasavin, Greg|date=2004-11-07|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/halo2/review.html?page=2|title=''Halo 2'' for Xbox Review|publisher=Gamespot|accessdate=2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some reviewers thought that this provided the series with a significant plot element&amp;mdash;[[IGN]] referred to it as the "intriguing side story of the Arbiter and his Elites"&amp;mdash;and its elimination in ''[[Halo 3]]'' was pointed to as responsible for reducing the role of the Arbiter within the series plot.&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web| author=Goldstein, Hillary|  url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/821/821911p1.html| title=''Halo 3'' Review|publisher=[[IGN]]| date=2007-09-23| accessdate=2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 [[IGN]] ranked Covenant 26th in the "Top 100 Videogames Villains".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/videogame-villains/26.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520061954/http://www.ign.com/videogame-villains/26.html |archivedate=2010-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Domingo Faustino Sarmiento''' (February 15, 1811 &amp;ndash; September 11, 1888) was an [[Argentine]] activist, intellectual, writer, statesman and the seventh [[President of Argentina]].  His writing spanned a wide range of genres and topics, from journalism to autobiography, to political philosophy and history.  He was a member of a group of intellectuals, known as the ''[[1837 generation|Generation of 1837]]'', who had a great influence on nineteenth-century [[Argentina]]. He was particularly concerned with educational issues and was also an important influence on the region's literature.

Sarmiento grew up in a poor but politically active family that paved the way for much of his future accomplishments. Between 1843 and 1850 he was frequently in exile, and wrote in both [[Chile]] and in Argentina. His greatest literary achievement was ''[[Facundo]]'', a critique of [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], that Sarmiento wrote while working for the newspaper ''El Progreso'' during his exile in Chile. The book brought him far more than just literary recognition; he expended his efforts and energy on the war against dictatorships, specifically that of Rosas, and contrasted enlightened Europe&amp;mdash;a world where, in his eyes, democracy, social services, and intelligent thought were valued&amp;mdash;with the barbarism of the ''[[gaucho]]'' and especially the ''[[caudillo]]'', the ruthless strongmen of nineteenth-century Argentina.

While president of Argentina from 1868 to 1874, Sarmiento championed intelligent thought—including education for children and women—and democracy for Latin America. He also took advantage of the opportunity to modernize and develop train systems, a postal system, and a comprehensive education system. He spent many years in ministerial roles on the federal and state levels where he travelled abroad and examined other education systems.

Sarmiento died in [[Asunción]], Paraguay, at the age of 77 from a heart attack. He was buried in [[Buenos Aires]]. Today, he is respected as a political innovator and writer. [[Miguel de Unamuno]] considered him among the greatest writers of Castilian prose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Campobassi |first1=José Salvador |title=Sarmiento y su época, Volumen 1 |date=1975 |publisher=Losada |location=Buenos Aires}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Youth and influences ==
[[Image:Argentina-CIA WFB Map.png|thumb|170px|left|A current map of Argentina, showing some of the key locations in Sarmiento's life such as San Juan (to the West) and Buenos Aires (in the East)]]
Sarmiento was born in Carrascal, a poor suburb of [[San Juan, Argentina]] on February 15, 1811.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, José Clemente Quiroga Sarmiento y Funes, had served in the military during the wars of independence, returning prisoners of war to San Juan.&lt;ref name="Bunkley 1969 p=31"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Doña Paula Zoila de Albarracín e Irrázabal, was a very pious woman,&lt;ref name="bunkley24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; who lost her father at a young age and was left with very little to support herself.&lt;ref name="bunkley24" /&gt; As a result, she took to selling her weaving in order to afford to build a house of her own. On September 21, 1801, José and Paula were married. They had 15&amp;nbsp;children, 9 of whom died; Domingo was the only son to survive to adulthood.&lt;ref name="bunkley24"/&gt; Sarmiento was greatly influenced by his parents, his mother who was always working hard, and his father who told stories of being a patriot and serving his country, something Sarmiento strongly believed in.&lt;ref name="Bunkley 1969 p=31"/&gt; In Sarmiento's own words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I was born in a family that lived long years in mediocrity bordering on destitution, and which is to this day poor in every sense of the word. My father is a good man whose life has nothing remarkable except [for his] having served in subordinate positions in the War of Independence... My mother is the true figure of Christianity in its purest sense; with her, trust in Providence was always the solution to all difficulties in life."&lt;ref&gt;Mi Defensa, in Obras Completas de Domingo Faustino Sarmiento (henceforth OC), vol. 3 (Buenos Aires: Editorial Luz Del Dia, 1948), pp. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the age of four, Sarmiento was taught to read by his father and his uncle, José Eufrasio Quiroga Sarmiento, who later became Bishop of [[Cuyo, Argentina|Cuyo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another uncle who influenced him in his youth was Domingo de Oro, a notable figure in the young Argentine Republic who was influential in bringing [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] to power.&lt;ref name="bunkley26"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Sarmiento did not follow de Oro's political and religious leanings, he learned the value of intellectual integrity and honesty.&lt;ref name="bunkley26" /&gt; He developed scholarly and oratorical skills, qualities which de Oro was famous for.&lt;ref name="bunkley26" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[José Ignacio García Hamilton|García Hamilton, José Ignacio]] (1998).
''Cuyano alborotador: la vida de Domingo Faustino Sarmiento''. Editorial Sudamericana, p. 270-271. ISBN
9500712504 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1816, at the age of five, Sarmiento began attending the primary school ''La Escuela de la Patria''. He was a good student, and earned the title of First Citizen (''Primer Ciudadano'') of the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing primary school, his mother wanted him to go to [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] to become a priest. He had spent a year reading the Bible and often spent time as a child helping his uncle with church services,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Sarmiento soon became bored with religion and school, and got involved with a group of aggressive children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarmiento's father took him to the Loreto Seminary in 1821, but for reasons unknown, Sarmiento did not enter the seminary, returning instead to San Juan with his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1823, the Minister of State, [[Bernardino Rivadavia]], announced that the six top pupils of each state would be selected to receive higher education in Buenos Aires. Sarmiento was at the top of the list in San Juan, but it was then announced that only ten pupils would receive the scholarship.  The selection was made by lot, and Sarmiento was not one of the scholars whose name was drawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political background and exiles==
[[File:Sarmiento-Joven.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Sarmiento at the time of his exile in Chile, by [[Franklin Rawson]].]]
[[File:Ignacio Baz - Domingo F. Sarmiento - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Sarmiento portrayed by [[Ignacio Baz]].]]
[[File:Portrait of Sarmiento.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Portrait of Sarmiento painted by his granddaughter Eugenia.]]
In 1826, an assembly elected [[Bernardino Rivadavia]] as president of the [[United Provinces of the Río de la Plata]]. This action roused the ire of the provinces, and [[civil war]] was the result. Support for a strong, centralized Argentine government was based in Buenos Aires, and gave rise to two opposing groups. The wealthy and educated of the [[Unitarian Party]], such as Sarmiento, favored centralized government. In opposition to them were the [[Federalist Party (Argentina)|Federalists]], who were mainly based in rural areas and tended to reject European mores. Numbering figures such as [[Manuel Dorrego]] and [[Juan Facundo Quiroga]] among their ranks, they were in favor of a loose federation with more autonomy for the individual provinces.&lt;ref name="moss171"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moss|Valestuk|1999|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinion of the Rivadavia government was divided between the two [[ideology|ideologies]]. For Unitarians like Sarmiento, Rivadavia's presidency was a positive experience. He set up a European-staffed university and supported a public education program for rural male children. He also supported theater and opera groups, publishing houses and a museum. These contributions were considered as civilizing influences by the Unitarians, but they upset the Federalist constituency. Common laborers had their salaries subjected to a government cap, and the [[gaucho|''gauchos'']] were arrested by Rivadavia for vagrancy and forced to work on public projects, usually without pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moss &amp; Valestuk|1999|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1827, the Unitarians were challenged by Federalist forces. After the resignation of Rivadavia, [[Manuel Dorrego]] was installed as governor of Buenos Aires province. He quickly made peace with Brazil but, on returning to Argentina, was overthrown and executed by the Unitarian general [[Juan Lavalle]], who took Dorrego's place.&lt;ref name="moss173"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moss|Valestuk|1999|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lavalle did not spend long as governor either: he was soon overthrown by militias composed largely of ''gauchos'' led by Rosas and [[Estanislao López]]. By the end of 1829 the old legislature that Lavalle had disbanded was back in place and had appointed Rosas as governor of Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name="moss173" /&gt;

The first time Sarmiento was forced to leave home was with his uncle, José de Oro, in 1827, because of his military activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; José de Oro was a priest who had fought in the [[Battle of Chacabuco]] under [[General San Martín]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, Sarmiento and de Oro went to [[San Francisco del Monte]], in the neighbour province of [[San Luis Province|San Luis]]. He spent much of his time with his uncle learning and began to teach at the only school in town.  Later that year, his mother wrote to him asking him to come home. Sarmiento refused, only to receive a response from his father that he was coming to collect him.&lt;ref name="bunkley49"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father had persuaded the governor of San Juan to send Sarmiento to Buenos Aires to study at the College of Moral Sciences (''Colegio de Ciencias Morales'').&lt;ref name="bunkley49" /&gt;

Soon after Sarmiento's return, the province of San Juan broke out into civil war and [[Facundo Quiroga]] invaded Sarmiento's town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; As historian William Katra describes this "traumatic experience":
{{quote|text=At sixteen years of age, he stood in front of the shop he tended and viewed the entrance into San Juan of Facundo Quiroga and some six hundred mounted ''[[montonera]]'' horsemen.  They constituted an unsettling presence [. . . ].  That sight, with its overwhelmingly negative associations, left an indelible impression on his budding consciousness.  For the impressionable youth Quiroga's ascent to protagonist status in the province's affairs was akin to the rape of civilized society by incarnated evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Katra|1996|p= 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Unable to attend school in Buenos Aires due to the political turmoil, Sarmiento chose to fight against Quiroga.&lt;ref name="bunkley77"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined and fought in the unitarian army, only to be placed under house arrest when San Juan was eventually taken over by Quiroga&lt;ref name="bunkley77" /&gt; after the battle of Pilar.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, pp.52-61&lt;/ref&gt; He was later released, only to join the forces of [[José María Paz|General Paz]], a key unitarian figure.&lt;ref name=Ham&gt;Hamilton, pp. 62-65&lt;/ref&gt;

===First exile in Chile===

Fighting and war soon resumed, but, one by one, Quiroga vanquished the main allies of General Paz, including the Governor of San Juan, and in 1831 Sarmiento fled to Chile.&lt;ref name=Ham/&gt; He did not return to Argentina for five years.&lt;ref name="crowley10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Chile was noted for its good public administration, its constitutional organization, and the rare freedom to criticize the regime. In Sarmiento's view, Chile had "Security of property, the continuation of order, and with both of these, the love of work and the spirit of enterprise that causes the development of wealth and prosperity."&lt;ref&gt;"Los diez años precedentes," ''El Nacional'' May 1, 1841 [Hmm.  This reference looks a little dodgy!]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a form of freedom of expression, Sarmiento began to write political commentary.  In addition to writing, he also began teaching in [[Los Andes, Chile|Los Andes]].  Due to his innovative style of teaching, he found himself in conflict with the governor of the province. He founded his own school in Pocuro as a response to the governor. During this time, Sarmiento fell in love and had an illegitimate daughter named Ana Faustina, who Sarmiento did not acknowledge until she married.&lt;ref name="historiador"&gt;Felipe Pigna, [http://www.elhistoriador.com.ar/biografias/s/sarmiento.php "Domingo Faustino Sarmiento"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215162701/http://www.elhistoriador.com.ar/biografias/s/sarmiento.php |date=February 15, 2008 }}.

===San Juan and second and third exiles in Chile===

In 1836, Sarmiento returned to San Juan, seriously ill with typhoid fever; his family and friends thought he would die upon his return, but he recovered and established an anti-federalist journal called ''El Zonda''.&lt;ref name="crowley16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of San Juan did not like Sarmiento's criticisms and censored the magazine by imposing an unaffordable tax upon each purchase. Sarmiento was forced to cease publication of the magazine in 1840.  He also founded a school for girls during this time called the Santa Rosa High School, which was a preparatory school.&lt;ref name="crowley16" /&gt; In addition to the school, he founded a Literary Society.&lt;ref name="crowley16" /&gt;

It is around this time that Sarmiento became associated with the so-called "[[1837 generation|Generation of 1837]]".  This was a group of activists, who included [[Esteban Echeverría]], [[Juan Bautista Alberdi]], and [[Bartolomé Mitre]], who spent much of the 1830s to 1880s first agitating for and then bringing about social change, advocating republicanism, free trade, freedom of speech, and material progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Katra|1996|pp=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though, based in San Juan, Sarmiento was absent from the initial creation of this group, in 1838 he wrote to Alberdi seeking the latter's advice;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|1993|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in time he would become the group most fervent supporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|1993|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1840, after being arrested and accused of conspiracy, Sarmiento was forced into exile in Chile again.&lt;ref name="galvani20"&gt;Galvani, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  It was en route to Chile that, in the baths of Zonda, he wrote the graffiti "On ne tue point les idées,"&lt;ref name="galvani20" /&gt; an incident that would later serve as the preface to his book ''Facundo''.  Once on the other side of the Andes, in 1841 Samiento started writing for the [[Valparaíso]] newspaper ''[[El Mercurio]]'', as well working as a publisher of the ''Crónica Contemporánea de Latino América'' ("Contemporary Latin American Chronicle").&lt;ref name="crowley9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1842, Sarmiento was appointed the Director of the first [[Normal School]] in South America; the same year he also founded the newspaper ''El Progreso''.&lt;ref name="crowley9" /&gt;  During this time he sent for his family from San Juan to Chile. In 1843, Sarmiento published ''Mi Defensa'' ("My Defence"), while continuing to teach.&lt;ref name="crowley10" /&gt;  And in May 1845, ''El Progreso'' started the serial publication of the first edition of his best-known work, ''Facundo''; in July, ''Facundo'' appeared in book form.&lt;ref&gt;Galvani, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the years 1845 and 1847, Sarmiento travelled on behalf of the [[Chilean government]] across parts of South America to [[Uruguay]], Brazil, to Europe, France, Spain, [[Algeria]], Italy, [[Armenia]], Switzerland, England, to [[Cuba]], and to North America, the United States and Canada in order to examine different education systems and the levels of education and communication. Based on his travels, he wrote the book ''Viajes por Europa, África, y América'' which was published in 1849.&lt;ref name="crowley10" /&gt;

In 1848, Sarmiento voluntarily left to Chile once again. During the same year, he met widow Benita Martínez Pastoriza, married her, and adopted her son, Domingo Fidel, or Dominguito,&lt;ref name="crowley10" /&gt; who would be killed in action during the [[Paraguayan War|War of the Triple Alliance]] at [[Battle of Curupaity|Curupaytí]] in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recoletacemetery.com/?cat=12&amp;paged=5 After Life: Recoleta Cemetery]&lt;/ref&gt; Sarmiento continued to exercise the idea of freedom of the press and began two new periodicals entitled ''La Tribuna'' and ''La Crónica'' respectively, which strongly attacked Juan Manuel de Rosas. During this stay in Chile, Sarmiento's essays became more strongly opposed to Juan Manuel de Rosas. The Argentine government tried to have Sarmiento extradited from Chile to Argentina, but the Chilean government refused to hand him over.&lt;ref name="historiador"/&gt;

In 1850, he published both ''[[Argirópolis]]'' and ''Recuerdos de Provincia'' (Recollections of a Provincial Past). In 1852, Rosas's regime was finally brought down.  Sarmiento became involved in debates about the country's new constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Katra|1996|pp=173–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Argentina===
[[File:Sarmiento courret 1864.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Sarmiento in 1864. Photograph by [[Eugenio Courret]].]]
In 1854, Sarmiento briefly visited Mendoza, just across the border from Chile in Western Argentina, but he was arrested and imprisoned.  Upon his release, he went back to Chile.&lt;ref name="crowley10" /&gt;  But in 1855 he put an end to what was now his "self-imposed" exile in Chile:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Katra|1996|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; he arrived in Buenos Aires, soon to become editor-in-chief of the newspaper ''El Nacional''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galvani|1990|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also appointed town councillor in 1856, and 1857 he joined the provincial Senate, a position he held until 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Katra|1996|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in 1861, shortly after Mitre became Argentine president, that Sarmiento left Buenos Aires and returned to San Juan, where he was elected governor, a post he took up in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galvani|1990|pp= 23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then that he passed the ''Statutory Law of Public Education'', making it mandatory for children to attend primary school. It allowed for a number of institutions to be opened including secondary schools, military schools and an all-girls school.&lt;ref name="penn387"&gt;{{Harvnb|Penn|1946|p=387}}&lt;/ref&gt; While governor, he developed roads and infrastructure, built public buildings and hospitals, encouraged agriculture and allowed for mineral mining.&lt;ref name="historiador"/&gt; He resumed his post as editor of ''El Zonda''. In 1863, Sarmiento fought against the power of the ''[[caudillo]]'' of La Rioja and found himself in conflict with the Interior Minister of [[Bartolomé Mitre|General Mitre's government]], [[Guillermo Rawson]]. Sarmiento stepped down as governor of San Juan to become the Plenipotentiary Minister to the United States, where he was sent in 1865, soon after the assassination of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Moved by the story of Lincoln, Sarmiento ended up writing his book ''Vida de Lincoln''.&lt;ref name="historiador"/&gt; It was on this trip that Sarmiento received an honorary degree from the [[University of Michigan]]. A bust of him stood in the Modern Languages Building at the University of Michigan until multiple student protests prompted its removal.  Students installed plaques and painted the bust red to represent the controversies surrounding his policies towards the indigenous people in Argentina.  There still stands a statue of Sarmiento at [[Brown University]]. While on this trip, he was asked to run for President again. He won, taking office on October 12, 1868.&lt;ref name="historiador"/&gt;

== President of Argentina, 1868-1874==
[[File:Sarmiento (1873).jpg|thumb|right|180px|President Sarmiento in 1873.]]
Domingo Faustino Sarmiento served as President of the Republic of Argentina from 1868–1874, becoming president despite the maneuverings of his predecessor [[Bartolomé Mitre]].&lt;ref name="rock130"&gt;Rock, 1985, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;  According to biographer Allison Bunkley, his presidency "marks the advent of the middle, or land-owning classes as the pivot power of the nation.  The age of the gaucho had ended, and the age of the merchant and cattleman had begun."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=449}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sarmiento sought to create basic freedoms, and wanted to ensure civil safety and progress for everyone, not just the few. Sarmiento's tour of the United States had given him many new ideas about politics, democracy, and the structure of society, especially when he was the Argentine ambassador to the country from 1865 to 1868. He found [[New England]], specifically the [[Boston]]-[[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] area to be the source of much of his influence, writing in an Argentine newspaper that New England was "the cradle of the modern republic, the school for all of America." He described Boston as ''"The pioneer city of the modern world, the Zion of the ancient [[Puritans]] ... Europe contemplates in New England the power which in the future will supplant her."''&lt;ref&gt;Obras, 31: 197, article written Oct. 9, 1865, for El Zonda, Obras, 24: 71. JSTOR [this reference is very confusing; please clarify]&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only did Sarmiento evolve political ideas, but also structural ones by transitioning Argentina from a primarily agricultural economy to one focused on cities and industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[David Rock (historian)|David Rock]] notes that, beyond putting an end to caudillismo, Sarmiento's main achievements in government concerned his promotion of education.  As Rock reports, "between 1868 and 1874 educational subsidies from the central government to the provinces quadrupled."&lt;ref name="rock130" /&gt;  He established 800 educational and military institutions, and his improvements to the educational system enabled 100,000&amp;nbsp;children to attend school.

He also pushed forward modernization more generally, building infrastructure including {{convert|5000|km|mi}} of telegraph line across the country for improved communications, making it easier for the government in Buenos Aires and the provinces to communicate; modernizing the postal and train systems which he believed to be integral for interregional and national economies, as well as building the Red Line, a train line that would bring goods to Buenos Aires in order to better facilitate trade with Great Britain. By the end of his presidency, the Red Line extended {{convert|1331|km|mi}}. In 1869, he conducted Argentina's first national census.&lt;ref name="historiador"/&gt;

Though Sarmiento is well known historically, he was not a popular president.&lt;ref name="crowley21"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, Rock judges that "by and large his administration was a disappointment".&lt;ref name="rock130" /&gt;  During his presidency, Argentina conducted an unpopular war against Paraguay; at the same time, people were displeased with him for not fighting for the [[Straits of Magellan]] from Chile.&lt;ref name="crowley21" /&gt;  Although he increased productivity, he increased expenditures, which also negatively affected his popularity.&lt;ref name="crowley22"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p= 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the arrival of a large influx of European immigrants was blamed for the outbreak of [[Yellow Fever in Buenos Aires]] and the risk of civil war.&lt;ref name="crowley22" /&gt;  Moreover, Sarmiento's presidency was further marked by ongoing rivalry between Buenos Aires and the provinces.  In the war against Paraguay, Sarmiento's adopted son was killed.&lt;ref name="historiador"/&gt; Sarmiento suffered from immense grief and was thought to never have been the same again.

On August 22, 1873, Sarmiento was the target of an unsuccessful assassination attempt, when two Italian [[anarchist]] brothers shot at his [[Coach (carriage)|coach]]. They had been hired by federal caudillo [[Ricardo López Jordán]].&lt;ref name="historiador"/&gt; A year later in 1874, he completed his term as President and stepped down, handing his presidency over to [[Nicolás Avellaneda]], his former Minister of Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years==
[[File:Muelle desemb restos sarmiento 1888.jpg|thumb|right|The coffin with the Sarmiento's body, arriving to Buenos Aires to be buried.]]
In 1875, following his term as President, Sarmiento became the General Director of Schools for the Province of Buenos Aires.  That same year, he became the Senator for San Juan, a post that he held until 1879, when he became Interior Minister.&lt;ref name="galvani25"&gt;{{Harvnb|Galvani|1990|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he soon resigned, following conflict with the Governor of Buenos Aires, [[Carlos Tejedor (politician)|Carlos Tejedor]]. He then assumed the post of Superintendent General of Schools for the National Education Ministry under President Roca and published ''El Monitor de la Educación Común'', which is a fundamental reference for Argentine education.&lt;ref name="efemerides"&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.me.gov.ar/efeme/sarmiento/index.html Domingo Faustino Sarmiento] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123235029/http://www.me.gov.ar/efeme/sarmiento/index.html |date=January 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882, Sarmiento was successful in passing the sanction of Free Education allowing schools to be free, mandatory, and separate from that of religion.&lt;ref name="historiador"/&gt;

In May 1888, Sarmiento left Argentina for Paraguay.&lt;ref name="galvani25" /&gt; He was accompanied by his daughter, Ana, and his companion Aurelia Vélez. He died in [[Asunción]] on September 11, 1888, from a heart attack, and was buried in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name="crowley10" /&gt;  His tomb at [[La Recoleta Cemetery]] lies under a sculpture, a condor upon a pylon, designed by himself and executed by [[Victor de Pol]].  [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], the Emperor of Brazil and a great admirer of Sarmiento, sent to his funeral procession a green and gold crown of flowers with a message written in Spanish remembering the highlights of his life: "[[Facundo|Civilization and Barbarism]], [[Battle of The Tonelero Pass|Tonelero]], [[Battle of Caseros|Monte Caseros]], [[Petrópolis]], Public Education. Remembrance and Homage from Pedro de Alcântara."&lt;ref&gt;Calmon, Pedro. ''História de D. Pedro II''. v.1. Rio de Janeiro: José Olympio, 1975, pp. 407-8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
[[File:Domingo Sarmiento Rodin Palermo II.jpg|right|thumb|160px|[[Statue]] of Sarmiento made by [[Auguste Rodin]].]]
[[File:Sarmiento statue inaug 1900.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The statue of Sarmiento when being unveiled in 1900.]]

Sarmiento was well known for his modernization of the country, and for his improvements to the educational system. He firmly believed in democracy and European liberalism, but was most often seen as a romantic. Sarmiento was well versed in Western philosophy including the works of [[Karl Marx]] and [[John Stuart Mill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Katra|1994|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly fascinated with the liberty given to those living in the United States, which he witnessed as a representative of the Peruvian government. He did, however, see pitfalls to liberty, pointing for example to the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]], which he compared to Argentina's own [[May Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Katra 1994 p=79"&gt;{{Harvnb|Katra|1994|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that liberty could turn into anarchy and thus civil war, which is what happened in France and in Argentina. Therefore, his use of the term "liberty" was more in reference to a laissez-faire approach to the economy, and religious liberty.&lt;ref name="Katra 1994 p=79"/&gt; Though a Catholic himself, he began to adopt the ideas of separation of church and state modeled after the US.&lt;ref name="crowley39"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that there should be more religious freedom, and less religious affiliation in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of many ways in which Sarmiento tried to connect South America to North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarmiento believed that the material and social needs of people had to be satisfied but not at the cost of order and decorum. He put great importance on law and citizen participation. These ideas he most equated to Rome and to the United States, a society which he viewed as exhibiting similar qualities. In order to civilize the Argentine society and make it equal to that of Rome or the United States, Sarmiento believed in eliminating the caudillos, or the larger landholdings and establishing multiple agricultural colonies run by European immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Katra|1994|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming from a family of writers, orators, and clerics, Domingo Sarmiento placed a great value on education and learning. He opened a number of schools including the first school in Latin America for teachers in Santiago in 1842: ''La Escuela Normal Preceptores de Chile''.&lt;ref name="penn387"/&gt; He proceeded to open 18 more schools and had mostly female teachers from the USA come to Argentina to instruct graduates how to be effective when teaching.&lt;ref name="penn387" /&gt; Sarmiento's belief was that education was the key to happiness and success, and that a nation could not be democratic if it was not educated.&lt;ref name="penn388"&gt;{{Harvnb|Penn|1946|p=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We must educate our rulers," he said. "An ignorant people will always choose Rosas."&lt;ref&gt;qtd. {{Harvnb|Penn|1946|p=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==

===Major works===

* '''''[[Facundo]] - Civilización y Barbarie - Vida de Juan Facundo Quiroga''''', 1845. Written during his long exile in Chile. Originally published in 1845 in Chile in installments in ''El Progreso'' newspaper, ''Facundo'' is Sarmiento's most famous work.  It was first published in book form in 1851, and the first English translation, by Mary Mann, appeared in 1868.&lt;ref name="ross18"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ross|2003|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent modern edition in English was translated by Kathleen Ross. ''Facundo'' promotes further civilization and European influence on Argentine culture through the use of anecdotes and references to [[Juan Facundo Quiroga]], Argentine caudillo general. As well as being a call to progress, Sarmiento discusses the nature of Argentine peoples as well as including his thoughts and objections to Juan Manuel de Rosas, governor of Buenos Aires from 1829 to 1832 and again from 1835, due to the turmoil generated by Facundo's death, to 1852. As literary critic Sylvia Molloy observes, Sarmiento claimed that this book helped explain Argentine struggles to European readers, and was cited in European publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Molloy|1991|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written with extensive assistance from others, Sarmiento adds to his own memory the quotes, accounts, and dossiers from other historians and companions of Facundo Quiroga. ''Facundo'' maintains its relevance in modern-day as well, bringing attention to the contrast of lifestyles in Latin America, the conflict and struggle for progress while maintaining tradition, as well as the moral and ethical treatment of the public by government officials and regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ross|2003|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''[[Recuerdos de Provincia]]''''' (''Recollections of a Provincial Past''), 1850. In this second autobiography, Sarmiento displays a stronger effort to include familial links and ties to his past, in contrast to ''Mi defensa'', choosing to relate himself to San Juan and his Argentine heritage. Sarmiento discusses growing up in rural Argentina with basic ideologies and simple livings. ''Recuerdos'' discusses his Similar to ''Facundo'', Sarmiento uses previous dossiers filed against himself by enemies to assist in writing ''Recuerdos'' and therefore fabricating an autobiography based on these files and from his own memory. Sarmiento's persuasion in this book is substantial. The accounts, whether all true or false against him, are a source of information to write ''Recuerdos'' as he is then able to object and rectify into what he creates as a 'true account' of autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Lacayo, Herberto. "Untitled." Hispania 32.2 (1949):pp.409-410&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other works===

Sarmiento was a prolific author.  The following is a selection of his other works:

* ''Mi defensa'', 1843. This was Sarmiento's first autobiography in a pamphlet form, which omits any substantial information or recognition of his illegitimate daughter Ana. This would have discredited Sarmiento as a respected father of Argentina, as Sarmiento portrays himself as a sole individual, disregarding or denouncing important ties to other people and groups in his life.&lt;ref name="crowley26" /&gt;
* ''Viajes por Europa, África, y América'' 1849. A description and observations while travelling as a representative of the Chilean government to learn more about educational systems around the world.&lt;ref name="crowley26" /&gt;
* ''Argirópolis'' 1850. A description of a future utopian city in the River Plate States.&lt;ref name="crowley29"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Commentarios sobre la constitución'' 1852. This is Sarmiento's official account of his ideologies promoting civilization and the "Europeanization" and "Americanization" of Argentina. This account includes dossiers, articles, speeches and information regarding the pending constitution.&lt;ref name="crowley28"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Informes sobre educación'', 1856. This report was the first official statistic report on education in Latin America includes information on gender and location distribution of pupils, salaries and wages, and comparative achievement. ''Informes sobre educación'' proposes new theories, plans, and methods of education as well as quality controls on schools and learning systems.&lt;ref name="crowley29" /&gt;
* ''Las Escuelas, base de la prosperidad y de la republica en los Estados Unidos'' 1864. This work, along with the previous two, were intended to persuade Latin America and Argentines of the benefits of the educational, economic and political systems of the United States, which Sarmiento supported.&lt;ref name="crowley26" /&gt;
* ''Conflicto y armonías de las razas en América'' 1883, deals with race issues in Latin America in the late 1800s. While situations in the book remain particular to the time period and location, race issues and conflicts of races are still prevalent and enable the book to be relevant in the present day.&lt;ref name="Crowley 1972 p=24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Vida de Dominguito'', 1886. A memoir of Dominguito, Sarmiento's adopted son who was the only child Sarmiento had always accepted. Many of the notes used to compile ''Vida de Dominguito'' had been written 20 years prior during one of Sarmiento's stays in Washington.&lt;ref name="Crowley 1972 p=24"/&gt;
* ''Educar al soberano'', a compilation of letters written from 1870 to 1886 on the topic of improved education, promoting and suggesting new reforms such as secondary schools, parks, sporting fields and specialty schools. This compilation was met with far greater success than ''Ortografía, Instrucción Publica'' and received greater public support.&lt;ref name="crowley29" /&gt;

* ''Inmigración y colonización'', a publication which led to mass immigration of Europeans to mostly urban Argentina, which Sarmiento believed would assist in 'civilizing' the country over the more barbaric gauchos and rural provinces. This had a large impact on Argentine politics, especially as much of the civil tension in the country was divided between the rural provinces and the cities. In addition to increased urban population, these European immigrants had a cultural effect upon Argentina, providing what Sarmiento believed to be more civilized culture similar to North America's.&lt;ref name="crowley26"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of Domingo Faustino Sarmiento is most obviously seen in the establishment of September 11 as [[Americas|Panamerican]] [[Teacher's Day]] which was done in his honor at the 1943 Interamerican Conference on Education, held in [[Panama]]. Today, he is still considered to be Latin America's teacher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.me.gov.ar/efeme/sarmiento Domingo Faustino Sarmiento&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113115938/http://www.me.gov.ar/efeme/sarmiento |date=January 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his time, he opened countless schools, created free public libraries, opened immigration, and worked towards a Union of Plate States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His impact was not only on the world of education, but also on Argentine political and social structure. His ideas are now revered as innovative, though at the time they were not widely accepted.&lt;ref name="crowley166"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a self-made man and believed in sociological and economic growth for Latin America, something that the Argentine people could not recognize at the time with the soaring standard of living which came with high prices, high wages, and an increased national debt.&lt;ref name="crowley166" /&gt;

There is a building named in his honor at the Argentine embassy in [[Washington D.C.]].

Today, there is a statue in honor of Sarmiento in [[Boston]] on the [[Commonwealth Avenue, Boston|Commonwealth Avenue Mall]], between Gloucester and Hereford streets, erected in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian Art Institution]].

&lt;!-- [[File:DovieThurman.jpg|thumb|Little Dovie and Virgina Bowers]] --&gt;
'''Little Dovie Thurman''' (1946 – April 7, 1997) was a community activist who dedicated her life to the social and political development of poor communities. She is most known for her involvement in [[Chicago]] [[welfare rights]] campaign of the 1960s. Thurman worked toward welfare rights and reform with a local organization on the north side of the city called J.O.I.N. (Jobs or Income Now), as well as Uptown Voices advocating for quality, affordable housing for low-income people in [[Uptown, Chicago]] and its surrounding communities. As President, Dovie worked to empower community members through participation in housing advocacy, development, rehabilitation and management.

== Personal life ==
Dovie Thurman was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1946. She was known as Little Dovie by family and friends after her aunt Dovie Coleman, or Big Dovie. Dovie’s father passed when she was only 1 year old leaving her to be raised by her grandmother. In 1965, after years of living in an all black community in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] Thurman and her two children at the time moved back to Chicago where she settled in the Uptown neighborhood. She was 19 years old and married to a man stationed in [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;A Conversation with Studs Terkel: Dovie Thurman 06 Mar. 1997. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community activism ==
Thurman began her career as community activist in 1965.  That same year, she met [[Peggy Terry]], a white southern migrant worker who relocated to the neighborhood as a [[civil rights]] activist, in a storefront office in Uptown. By 1966, a local organization was gaining popularity amongst students sand residents for its efforts of reducing [[urban poverty]].&lt;ref name=Sonnie&gt;Sonnie, Amy. "Uptown's JOIN Community Union." AREA Chicago Uptowns JOIN Community Union Comments. AREA Chicago, n.d. Web. 23 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs or Income Now (JOIN) included noted organizers like Rennie Davis, Richard Rothstein, and Casey Hayden lived in Uptown, undertaking the slow and uneven process of pushing locals towards political action. Early successes included a sit-in at the city welfare office, and tenant strikes that resulted in contracts between collectivized renters and landlords.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Devin. "When Police Brutality Protest Was White." Dvhunter. N.p., 30 Aug. 2014. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts antagonized most of the local political and social elites. The chapter was permanently relocated to the Uptown neighborhood, focusing attention on a wider range of pressing, and therefore actionable, community issues: welfare, housing conditions, unemployment and police brutality. As more student organizers began to arrive in Chicago, JOIN also welcomed an influx of community members who became a steady force in the organization. Peggy Terry and Candy Hockenberry came to JOIN around the same time, along with Thurman, her aunt Big Dovie, and Virginia Bowers. The five women became fast friends and, together, they formed the core of JOIN’s welfare committee and became the backbone of the organization's housing rights work.&lt;ref name=Sonnie /&gt; Thurman who served as chairperson for the committee recollects her participation with JOIN as her first involvement in the civil rights movement and her first encounter with poor whites. "I had never seen poor white people," says Thurman. After meeting these women she stated, "We found out we had more in common than we ever thought. It’s because we began to communicate." Her involvement with JOIN was an eyeopening experience that allowed for the intersection of two communities to cultivate a movement unprecedented in Uptown.

== Notability ==
Thurman was highly respected in her community, working as an activist for many social issues, she acknowledges one of her greatest gains as the Welfare, "Know Your Rights" campaign in which she traveled to educate people in different communities about the importance on staying informed on the happenings of the system, and how to advocate for yourself within the system. After spending the majority of her life working for civil rights not only in Chicago but also in Alabama and Washington D.C., Thurman decided to document her story of activism in an oral history produced by old friend [[Studs Terkel]]. The interview was featured in a series of oral projects featuring community organizers. Thurman’s interview finally shed the emotions and tribulations faced by women like Dovie who humbly fought for years without formal recognition for her works.

== Death ==
Thurman’s documentary was produced only a month before her passing. Reporting on the announcement ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'''s Mary Schmich wrote, "Thurman gave her own heart away, marching and protesting and speechifying on behalf of poor people, never mind that for years the doctors told her to sit still, lie down, stay quiet. Some politicians would have been happier if she'd obeyed." &lt;ref&gt;Heise, Kenan. "Dovie Thurman, Community Activist." Tribunedigital-chicagotribune. ChicagoTribune, 09 Apr. 1997. Web. 11 May 2015. &lt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-04-09/news/9704090307_1_heart-saul-alinsky-voice&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 7, 1997 Dovie Thurman died at the age of 51 from heart failure in Chicago, Illinois. Thurman is survived by her three children, James, Kim, and Lynn.

Rose was born in [[Eagle Butte, South Dakota]], on September 23, 1926, to Forest{{mdash}}a [[cowboy]] and [[rodeo]] rider{{mdash}} and Lena Berghuis Rose.&lt;ref name="Iowa City Press-Citizen"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Munson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt; He grew up on a remote ranch 26 miles from Eagle Butte on the [[Cheyenne River Indian Reservation]].&lt;ref name="Iowa City Press-Citizen"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Munson/&gt; Rose was reported to have ridden his horse five miles to get to school.&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt; According to his memoirs, he attended "one room country grade schools" before going to high school in Eagle Butte.&lt;ref name="University of Iowa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to the Earl F.

In the spring of 1944, at the end of his junior year, the 17-year-old Rose dropped out of high school and enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] where he served on a submarine, the [[USS Sea Devil (SS-400)|USS ''Sea Devil'']], in the [[Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II|Pacific theater of World War II]].&lt;ref name="Iowa City Press-Citizen"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Munson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt; According to Rose, at the end of hostilities his boat moored in [[Shanghai]] and [[Tsingtao, China]], and served as a "military presence" patrolling the [[China Seas]].&lt;ref name="University of Iowa"/&gt; He was discharged from the Navy in 1946, then attended [[Yankton College]] from which he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] 1949.&lt;ref name="Iowa City Press-Citizen"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Iowa"/&gt; While at Yankton, he met Marilyn Preheim, who was a medical tech student at a nearby hospital.&lt;ref name=Munson/&gt; The couple married in the [[Mennonite Church (1725–2002)|Mennonite Church]] on July 28, 1951, and eventually had a son and five daughters.&lt;ref name="Iowa City Press-Citizen"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Munson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Iowa"/&gt;

Rose studied [[medicine]] for two years at the [[University of South Dakota]], then earned his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] from [[University of Nebraska Medical Center|the University of Nebraska]] in 1953.&lt;ref name="Iowa City Press-Citizen"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Iowa"/&gt; In the mid-1950s, he interned in [[Denver, Colorado]], worked in private practice in [[Lemmon, South Dakota]], then completed specialty training with residencies at [[Baylor University Medical Center]] in Dallas ([[surgical pathology]]) and [[DePaul Hospital]] in St. Louis ([[clinical pathology]]).&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Iowa"/&gt; Rose then sub-specialized with a residency in [[forensic pathology]] at the [[Medical College of Virginia]].&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Iowa"/&gt; He worked as a forensic pathologist in [[Virginia]] where he held the title of Deputy Chief Examiner for the [[Tidewater region of Virginia|Tidewater Region of Virginia]].&lt;ref name="Iowa City Press-Citizen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Iowa"/&gt;

In June 1963, Rose moved to Dallas where he became medical examiner for the city and county of Dallas.&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Iowa"/&gt; According to ''The New York Times'', he was "hired by the county to establish a scientifically valid medical examiner’s system to replace its existing system of elected lay coroners."&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt; While working as a medical examiner in Dallas, Rose received a law degree from [[Southern Methodist University]].&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;

==Kennedy assassination==

===John F. Kennedy===
{{See also|John F. Kennedy autopsy#Background}}
On November 22, 1963, Rose was in his office at Parkland Memorial Hospital across the corridor from Trauma Room 1 when he received word that Kennedy was pronounced dead.&lt;ref name=Stafford/&gt; He walked across the corridor to the trauma room occupied by [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]] and a priest who had been called in to administer [[last rites]].&lt;ref name=Stafford/&gt; There, Rose was met by Secret Service agent [[Roy Kellerman]] and Kennedy's personal physician George Burkley who told him that there was no time for an autopsy because Mrs. Kennedy would not leave Dallas without her husband's body which was to be delivered promptly to the airport.&lt;ref name=Stafford/&gt; At the time of the assassination of Kennedy, the murder of a United States President was not covered by federal law.&lt;ref name=Munson/&gt; Rose objected, insisting that Texas law required him to perform a post-mortem examination prior to the removal of the body.&lt;ref name=Munson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stafford/&gt; A heated exchange ensued as he argued with Kennedy's aides.&lt;ref name=Munson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stafford/&gt; Kennedy's body was placed in a casket and, accompanied by Mrs. Kennedy, rolled down the corridor on a gurney.&lt;ref name=Stafford/&gt; Rose was reported to have stood in a hospital doorway, backed by a policeman, in an attempt to prevent the removal of the coffin.&lt;ref name=Munson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stafford/&gt; According to [[Robert Caro]]'s ''[[The Years of Lyndon Johnson#Book Four: The Passage of Power .282012.29|The Years of Lyndon Johnson: The Passage of Power]]'', the President's aides "had literally shoved [Rose] and the policeman aside to get out of the building."&lt;ref name=Stafford/&gt; In an interview with ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'', Rose stated that he stepped aside feeling that it was unwise to exacerbate the tension.&lt;ref name=Stafford/&gt;

Rose received criticism for arguing with federal officials at Parkland.&lt;ref name="Quad-City Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Medical examiner could have quelled JFK critics|url=http://qctimes.com/news/state-and-regional/medical-examiner-could-have-quelled-jfk-critics/article_0537c797-05f8-5199-b135-1b456466bc0b.html|accessdate=April 2, 2013|newspaper=Quad-City Times|date=November 14, 2003|agency=AP|location=Davenport, Iowa}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his role in the immediate aftermath of the assassination, he was disparaged by [[William Manchester]] in his 1967 book ''[[The Death of a President]]''.&lt;ref name=Munson/&gt; Describing Manchester's portrayal of Rose, Peter Knight wrote: "If Dallas and Oswald are the overt culprits of the crime, then Earl Rose is the cameo villain of the book."&lt;ref name=Knight&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Peter|title=The Kennedy Assassination|year=2007|publisher=Edinburgh University Press Ltd.|location=Edninburgh|isbn=9781934110324|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MRs2Tu714ZUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=April 1, 2013|chapter=History|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=MRs2Tu714ZUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2003 AP report, Rose's son, Forrest, believed that the book "depicted [Rose] as an unreasonable, petty state bureaucrat with a gripe."&lt;ref name="Quad-City Times"/&gt; ''[[BMJ]]'' wrote that he was "portrayed almost comically as a small time official trying to act important; a portrayal most now see as unjustified."&lt;ref name=Stafford/&gt;

In a 1992 interview published in the ''Journal of the American Medical Association'', Rose said, "The law was broken" and that "[a] Texas autopsy would have assured a tight chain of custody on all the evidence."&lt;ref name="Iowa City Press-Citizen"/&gt; In 2003, Rose said he still believed that he and his staff should have been allowed to perform the post-mortem examination of Kennedy and that many [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories about the assassination]] would have been quelled had he examined the President.&lt;ref name="Quad-City Times"/&gt;

===J. D. Tippit===
Rose began his autopsy of Dallas Police Officer J.D. Tippit at 3:14 pm on November 22.&lt;ref name=Bugliosi&gt;{{cite book|last=Bugliosi|first=Vincent|title=Four Days in November: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy|year=2007|publisher=W. W.

===Lee Harvey Oswald===
{{See also|Lee Harvey Oswald#Death}}
Two days after the assassination of Kennedy, Rose was called out of church to tend to Oswald, who had been fatally shot by Jack Ruby.&lt;ref name=Munson/&gt; Announcing the results of the gross autopsy, Rose said: "The two things that we could determine were, first, that he died from a hemorrhage from a gunshot wound, and that otherwise he was a physically healthy male."&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Post-Gazette"&gt;{{cite news|title=Autopsy Shows Oswald Healthy; Little of History of Slayer Is Revealed|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mZ1RAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YGwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1386%2C5383871|accessdate=April 4, 2013|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=November 30, 1963|agency=AP|location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|page=f}}&lt;/ref&gt; His examination found that Ruby's bullet entered Oswald's left side in the front part of the abdomen and caused damage to his [[spleen]], [[stomach]], [[aorta]], [[vena cava]], [[kidney]], [[liver]], [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], and [[eleventh rib]] before coming to rest on&lt;!--reference states "on"--&gt; his right side.&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Post-Gazette"/&gt;

In 1979, [[Michael Eddowes]]{{mdash}}who wrote a book claiming that the man who assassinated Kennedy was a [[look-alike]] of Oswald put in place by Soviet secret police{{mdash}}filed suit in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], in order to [[exhume]] Oswald's body for verification of its identity. There was reported to have been some controversy regarding Rose's measurement of Oswald's height and that he did not note a [[mastoidectomy]] scar which was claimed to exist by others.&lt;ref name="Observer–Reporter"&gt;{{cite news|title=Body Was Oswald's, Medical Man Says|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uvddAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nV8NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2830%2C1936999|accessdate=April 4, 2013|newspaper=Observer–Reporter|date=November 12, 1979|agency=AP|location=Washington, Pennsylvania|page=C-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose said he did not object to the exhumation. He was reported to have met Eddowes and to have had "great respect" for him.&lt;ref name="Observer–Reporter"/&gt;

===Jack Ruby===
On January 3, 1967, Ruby (the murderer of Oswald) died at Parkland Hospital.&lt;ref name="Spokane Daily Chronicle"&gt;{{cite news|title=Issue Clouded: Jack Ruby's Body Goes to Chicago|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=N1ZYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ufcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7486%2C703986|accessdate=April 4, 2013|newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle|date=January 4, 1967|agency=AP|location=Spokane, Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose began the autopsy on Ruby an hour after his death, and a report released the following month indicated that three doctors from the [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical School]] assisted him in the post-mortem examination.&lt;ref name="St. Joseph News-Press"&gt;{{cite news|title=Says Autopsy Revealed Ruby Had Brain Tumor|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fA1UAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cjkNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=779%2C485760|accessdate=April 4, 2013|newspaper=St. Joseph News-Press|date=February 3, 1967|agency=AP|location=St. Joseph, Missouri.|page=4A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of death was determined to be a [[pulmonary embolism|lung obstruction due to a massive blood clot]].&lt;ref name="St. Joseph News-Press"/&gt; Rose was quoted as saying that the clot originated in one of Ruby's legs and traveled through his heart to the lungs.&lt;ref name="Spokane Daily Chronicle"/&gt; After what was initially thought to be [[pneumonia]], Ruby was diagnosed with [[cancer]] at Parkland in December 1966.&lt;ref name="The Tuscaloosa News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Eight Tumors In Ruby Brain, Doctors Report|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MCUeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JZsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7184%2C566602|accessdate=April 4, 2013|newspaper=The Tuscaloosa News|date=February 5, 1967|agency=AP|location=Tuscaloosa, Alabama|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose indicated that the same type of cancer that affected Ruby's lungs was found in his [[brain]], [[lymph nodes]], [[liver]], [[pancreas]], [[pleura]], [[ribs]], and [[vertebra]].&lt;ref name="The Tuscaloosa News"/&gt; He said that eight tumors were found in his brain, with the largest being three-fourths of an inch.&lt;ref name="The Tuscaloosa News"/&gt; Rose told reporters that he could not definitively answer whether or not the tumors were present in Ruby's brain at the time he shot Oswald, but he indicated [[metastasis]] from the lungs to the brain could not have occurred prior to 1964 since X-rays at the county jail that year revealed that his lungs were clear.&lt;ref name="The Tuscaloosa News"/&gt; He added that he found no evidence of [[epilepsy]] or other brain abnormalities.&lt;ref name="The Tuscaloosa News"/&gt; Rose stated that his death certificate would note cancer as a contributing cause, but that the clot would likely have killed Ruby even if he had not been weakened by cancer.&lt;ref name="Spokane Daily Chronicle"/&gt;

==Later life==
In 1966, Rose performed autopsies on the crew of [[American Flyers Flight 280]] and testified about his findings in a hearing before the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]].&lt;ref name="The Altus-Times Democrat"&gt;{{cite news|title=Co-Pilot May Have Been At Doomed Jet's Controls|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=peFQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BK8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2719%2C4529345|accessdate=April 17, 2013|newspaper=The Altus-Times Democrat|date=May 27, 1966|agency=UPI|location=Altus, Oklahoma|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:EdwardBrongersma.jpg|thumb|Edward Brongersma]]

'''Edward Brongersma''' (31 August 1911 in [[Haarlem]], [[Netherlands]] &amp;ndash; 22 April 1998 in [[Bloemendaal]]/[[Overveen]], Netherlands) was a Dutch politician and doctor of law. For a number of years he was a member of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]] for the [[Dutch Labour Party|Labour Party]], and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He was primarily known as a defender of the rights of [[pedophile|paedophiles]] and an advocate of more lax legislation on public morality.

==Early life==
Brongersma was born in Haarlem as the son of an [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]]. He studied law at the [[University of Amsterdam]] (1931–1935) and obtained his degree in 1935. From 1935 to 1937 he was associated with a law firm in Haarlem while working on his doctoral dissertation on the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] constitution of 1933 and Portuguese [[corporatism]] of [[Antonio de Oliveira Salazar]], whom he much admired at the time. In 1940 he received his Doctor of Law degree ''cum laude'' from the [[Catholic University of Nijmegen]]. His dissertation, on the subject of the corporative state in Portugal, was published as a book and was reprinted several times.

==Career==
After [[World War II]] he quickly made a career for himself as a lawyer and politician as well as a prolific writer. He worked as an attorney in Amsterdam from 1940 to 1950, and between 1946 and 1950 he was active within the editorial board of the Dutch journal for the legal profession, Nederlands Juristenblad. In 1946, he was elected to the Dutch Senate for the Dutch Labour Party (PvdA); his term lasted from 1946 to 1950 and later he had a second term, from 1963 to 1977. In the same period (1946–1950), he was a member for the Dutch Labour Party of the Provincial States of North Holland and served on the town council of Heemstede.

His career was abruptly interrupted in 1950, when he was arrested for having sexual relations with a 17-year-old male. At the time, the [[age of consent]] for [[homosexual]] contacts was 21, based on article 248bis [[Dutch Criminal Code]]. The conviction of Brongersma resulted in 11 months imprisonment.

He subsequently continued his career in the 1950s as a journalist and critic. From 1953 to 1956, he was a member of the executive committee of the Dutch Labour Party in the Utrecht region. In 1956 he was recruited for a four-year term as director of community work in Haarlem. As a result of his conviction, he had been disbarred in 1950, but re-admitted to the Dutch Bar in 1959. He resumed his legal practice and continued to work as a lawyer until 1980.

From 1960 to 1967, he was a senior lecturer at the Criminological Institute of [[Utrecht University]], where he worked very closely with Professor of Law W. Pompe. In 1963, at the request of the Dutch Labour Party, he rejoined the Senate for a second term which would last until his resignation in 1977. From 1969 to 1977 he was chairman and spokesman for the Permanent Senate's Committee for Justice. For his political service, he was made a Companion in the Order of the Dutch Lion on 29 April 1975. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee he functioned from 1969 to 1977.

Brongersma was primarily known for his publications and his advocacy of more liberal morality legislation, a subject in which he was keenly interested. Because of his expertise, he played a major role in 1971 as a member of the Senate in abolishing Article 248bis of the Dutch Criminal Code, the same article on the basis of which he had been convicted in 1950. The age of consent for homosexual contacts was then lowered from 21 to 16 (the same as for heterosexual contacts). He advocated lowering the age of consent even further and allowing young people greater freedom to enter into sexual relations.

In the course of his lifetime he collected a huge number of scientific and academic publications on these themes, consisting of a library and personal archives. In 1979 he donated them to a foundation bearing his name, the object of which as stated in its articles of association was "promoting scientific study and publications in the field of sexual relations between adults and young people". In 1992 the objective was broadened to "promoting research of the sexual-emotional health of children and young people".

After resigning from the Dutch Senate in 1977, Brongersma devoted himself completely to the objectives of his foundation. It was then that he wrote his magnum opus "Loving Boys" (published in two parts, 1987 and 1990), while continuing to expand his collections.

==Work==
Brongersma published extensively on a wide variety of topics, authoring some 1200 books and articles between 1930 and 1998 on social and philosophical subjects such as criminal law, constitutional law, criminology, philosophy, religion, sexology, legislation on public morals and literary topics.  Able to speak ten Western European languages, he has written books on the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War in Spain]], Portugal and the Portuguese, [[penal law]] and social problems. Beginning with his years at the Criminological Institute, he has written extensively in the area of sexology, especially on [[pornography]], [[ephebophilia]], [[pedophilia]] and the [[age of consent]].  His books on this subjects include: ''Das Verfehmte Geschlecht'' (in German, 1970), ''Sex en Straf'' ("Sex and Punishment", 1972), ''Over pedofielen en kinderlokkers'' ("On Pedophiles and Child Molesters", 1975), and his last work is his ''magnum opus'' and entitled ''Loving Boys'' (two volumes, 1988–1990).

Brongersma's work and activism regarding pedophilia focused exclusively on [[homosexual pedophilia]] between males&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Boy-Lovers and Their Influence on Boys: Distorted Research and Anecdotal Observations|author=Edward Brongersma|journal=Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | year=1990|doi=10.1300/j082v20n01_10 | pages=145–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=October 2008}} and admitted several times that he knew little or nothing about heterosexual or lesbian pedophila.  Brongersma opposed the other prominent figure in the [[History of pro-pedophile activism|1970s pedophile emancipation movement in the Netherlands]], psychologist [[Frits Bernard]], who considered pedophilia not [[pathology|pathological]] irrespective of the gender of the participants.

==Death==
Brongersma died in 1998 by means of [[voluntary euthanasia]]. His health failed and he grew lonely as his best friends died one by one. The social changes that had started in the 1980s, in response to the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1970s, caused him to become dispirited. Initially his pleas to liberalise legislation on public morals and the rights of paedophiles had been positively received by some, both in the Netherlands and internationally. But gradually the social climate became less receptive to these ideas. Following his death, discussion flared up in the Netherlands as to whether people who were weary of life should be allowed to end their lives with the aid of a physician. [[Flip Sutorius]], the doctor from [[Overveen]] who helped Brongersma in his chosen death, was prosecuted but not punished.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.nrc.nl/W2/Nieuws/2000/10/31/Vp/01.html "Rechtbank in zaak-Brongersma: Ook zonder ziekte hulp bij zelfdoding"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://medischcontact.artsennet.nl/discussie/nieuwsartikel/Hof-veroordeelt-Sutorius-in-zaakBrongersma.htm "Hof veroordeelt Sutorius in zaak-Brongersma"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110720172046/http://medischcontact.artsennet.nl/discussie/nieuwsartikel/Hof-veroordeelt-Sutorius-in-zaakBrongersma.htm |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The verdict was finally maintained in 2002 by the ''Hoge Raad'' ([[Supreme Court of the Netherlands|Dutch Supreme Court]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://medischcontact.artsennet.nl/discussie/nieuwsartikel/Sutorius-na-verwerping-hoger-beroep-Ik-ben-opgelucht.htm "Sutorius na verwerping hoger beroep : 'Ik ben opgelucht'"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110720172138/http://medischcontact.artsennet.nl/discussie/nieuwsartikel/Sutorius-na-verwerping-hoger-beroep-Ik-ben-opgelucht.htm |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A great deal of commotion ensued following his death when some of the visual material in his collections was seized. The images were deemed to be [[child pornography]]. Legislation passed in 1996 made it an offence to have such pictures "on hand".

After his death, his entire social-sexuological collections as well as his private archives were placed in the International Institute for Social History (IISG) in Amsterdam (www.iisg.nl), this without the visual material which had been seized by the authorities. The executive board of the foundation continued its activities; in 1998, the "Fund for Scientific Research of Sexuality" was set up, with the stated aims of: obtaining more insight into sexual development processes in relation to social, emotional, cognitive and physical development; contributing to sexual health and to helping develop the capacity for relationships, and a sense of responsibility; supporting parents, guardians, educators, teachers, public relations officers and care and welfare workers by effectively channelling the knowledge gained from research; and promoting debate in circles of lawyers, sociologists, government officials and politicians on various social and legal frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research programme|url=http://www.fondsseksualiteit.nl/eng/onderzoek.htm|website=Fund for Scientific Research of Sexuality|accessdate=20 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006111052/http://www.fondsseksualiteit.nl/eng/onderzoek.htm|archivedate=6 October 2007|language=en|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3974">'''Engaged Spirituality''' refers to religious or spiritual people who actively engage in the world in order to transform it in positive ways while finding nurturance, inspiration and guidance in their spiritual beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Parachin, Janet W. 1999. Engaged Spirituality: Ten Lives of Contemplation and Action. St. Louis, Missouri: Chalice Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was inspired by [[Engaged Buddhism]] a concept and set of values developed  by the Vietnamese Buddhist monk [[Thich Nhat Hanh]].  Engaged Spirituality encompasses people committed to social change from all the major faith traditions as well as people who refer to themselves as “spiritual but not religious.”{{cn|date=July 2012}} It has numerous iterations in practice yet common themes unite the many forms it takes.  For some in the [[Catholic]] tradition, [[Liberation Theology]] guides their form of engaged spirituality.

== Common characteristics ==

Individuals who practice this mode of spirituality tend to hold [[Progressivism|progressive]] values that, supported by their spiritual practices galvanize their efforts for social change.&lt;ref&gt;Stanczak, Gregory C. 2006. Engaged Spirituality: Social Change and American Religion. New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; They see a deep connection between personal and social transformation such that they feel compelled to engage in organized causes or service activities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tikkun.org/article.php/Butigan-what-is-engaged-spirituality&lt;/ref&gt; Their activities are infused with their spiritual sensibilities regarding how matters of ultimate concern – the overarching context delineated by their faith tradition – are related to daily living, habits and practices. Examples of activities are: peace activism, civil rights and human rights activism for minority groups, environmental activism, and service on behalf of the poor and homeless.&lt;ref&gt;Stanczak, Gregory C. 2006. Engaged Spirituality: Social Change and American Religion. New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike much of the pop spirituality that is promoted in countless books, audio programs, and internet sites, engaged spirituality maintains a focus on societal transformation. Pop spirituality on the other hand, despite its politically liberal leanings, tends to concern itself primarily with personal, psychological betterment that lacks a deep commitment to social change and activism.&lt;ref&gt;Nangle, Joseph. 2008. Engaged spirituality: FaithLlife in the Heart of the Empire. Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Engaged spirituality involves a synthesis of individual, subjective experiences and outer, collective activities. The individual and the collective mutually support, shape and transform each other. For example, prayer or meditation may serve as a way for an individual to gather strength and gain insight that will guide and enhance the efficacy of their social change efforts. Their experiences gathered in their outer activities – which involve relating to and learning from others – may influence the texture of their prayer or meditation experiences. Thus there is a continual, interwoven process of spiritual growth and reaffirmation to improving one’s local/global community.&lt;ref&gt;Stanczak, Gregory C. 2006. Engaged Spirituality: Social Change and American Religion. New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Armoiries Bretagne - Arms of Brittany.svg|200px|right|thumb|Coat of Arms of Francis II, Duke of Brittany.]]
'''Francis II of Brittany''' (in [[Breton language|Breton]] '''Frañsez II''', in [[French language|French]] '''François II''') (23 June 1433{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} &amp;ndash; 9 September 1488) was '''[[Duke of Brittany]]''' from 1458 to his death. He was the grandson of [[John IV, Duke of Brittany]]. A recurring theme in Francis' life would be his quest to maintain the quasi-independence of [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]] from [[France]]. As such, his reign was characterized by conflicts with King [[Louis XI of France]]&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Brittany |volume=4 |pages=617–618}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with his daughter, [[Anne of France]], who served as regent during the minority of her brother, King [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]]. The armed and unarmed conflicts between 1484–1488 have been called the [[Mad War]] (''la Guerre Folle'') and also the "War of the Public Weal".&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Early life==

Francis II was born on 23 June 1433 to [[Richard of Brittany, Count of Étampes]] (1395–1438) and his wife, [[Margaret of Orléans, Countess of Etampe|Margaret of Orléans]], Countess of Vertus (1406–1466). Richard of Brittany was the youngest son of Duke John IV of Brittany. Richard's older brothers, [[John V, Duke of Brittany|John V]] and [[Arthur III, Duke of Brittany|Arthur III]], both succeeded their father as duke, but upon Arthur's death in 1458, the only legitimate male heir was Francis his nephew.

==Relationship with English royalty==

===Protector of the House of Lancaster===

Duke Francis II unforeseenably became the protector of England's [[House of Lancaster]] in exile from 1471–1484.

During the latter half of the 15th century, [[Wars of the Roses|civil war]] existed in England as the [[House of York]] and House of Lancaster fought each other for the English throne. In 1471, the Yorkists defeated their rivals in the battles of [[Battle of Barnet|Barnet]] and [[Battle of Tewkesbury|Tewkesbury]]. The Lancastrian king, [[Henry VI of England]] and his only son, [[Edward of Westminster]], died in the aftermath of the Battle of Tewkesbury. Their deaths left the House of Lancaster with no direct claimants to the throne. Subsequently, the Yorkist king, [[Edward IV of England]], was in complete control of England.{{sfn|Ross|1997|pp=172–173}}  He [[Attainder|attainted]] those who refused to submit to his rule, such as [[Jasper Tudor]] and his nephew [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]] (later King Henry VII of England), naming them as traitors and confiscating their lands.

The Tudors tried to flee to France but strong winds in the [[English Channel]] forced them to land at [[Le Conquet]] in [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]], where they were taken into the custody of Duke Francis II.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=17}} Henry Tudor, the only remaining Lancastrian noble with a trace of royal bloodline, had a weak claim to the throne,{{sfn|Ross|1997|pp=172–173}} and King Edward IV regarded him as "a nobody."{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=192}}  However, Francis II viewed Henry as a valuable tool to bargain for England's aid, when in conflicts with France, and therefore kept the Tudors under his protection.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=192}} He housed Jasper Tudor, Henry Tudor, and the core of their group of exiled Lancastrians at the [[Château de Suscinio]] in [[Sarzeau]], where they remained there for 11 years. There, Francis II generously supported this group of exiled Englishmen against all the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] demands that he should surrender them.

In October 1483, Henry Tudor launched a failed invasion of England from Brittany. Duke Francis II supported this invasion by providing 40,000 gold crowns, 15,000 soldiers, and a fleet of transport ships. Henry's fleet of 15 chartered vessels was scattered by a storm, and his ship reached the coast of England in company with only one other vessel. Henry realized that the soldiers on shore were the men of the new Yorkist king, [[Richard III of England]], and so he decided to abandon the invasion and return to Brittany. As for Henry's main conspirator in England, [[Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Henry Stafford, Duke of Buckingham]], he was convicted of treason and beheaded on 2 November 1483, way before Henry's ships landed in England.{{sfn|Williams|page=25}} For Henry's conspiracy against King Richard III had been unravelled, and without the Duke of Buckingham or Henry Tudor, the rebellion was easily crushed.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=117}}

Survivors of the failed uprising then fled to Brittany, where they openly supported Henry Tudor's claim to the throne.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=118}}  On Christmas Day in 1483 at the [[Rennes Cathedral]], Henry swore an oath to marry King Edward IV's daughter, [[Elizabeth of York]], and thus unite the warring houses of York and Lancaster.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=196}}  Henry's rising prominence made him a great threat to King Richard III, and the Yorkist king made several overtures to Duke Francis II to surrender the young Lancastrian. Francis II refused, holding out for the possibility of better terms from the King.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=19}}  In mid-1484, Francis was incapacitated by one of his periods of illness, and while recuperating, his treasurer, [[Pierre Landais]], took over the reins of government. Landais reached an agreement with King Richard III to send Henry and his uncle Jasper back to England in exchange for a pledge of 3,000 English archers to defend Brittany against a threatened French attack. John Morton, a bishop of [[Flanders]],&lt;!--not [[John Morton (archbishop)]], who was Bishop of Ely at this time --&gt; learned of the scheme and warned the Tudors in time. The  Tudors then managed to separately escape, hours ahead of Landais' soldiers, across the nearby border into France.{{sfn|Lander|1981|p=324}}  They were received at the court of King [[Charles VIII of France]] who allowed them to stay and provided them with resources.{{sfn|Kendall|page=297}} Shortly afterwards, when Francis II had recovered, he offered the 400 remaining Lancastrians, still at and around the Château de Suscinio, safe-conduct into France and even paid for their expenses. For the French, the Tudors were useful pawns to ensure that King Richard III did not interfere with French plans to acquire Brittany.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=31}} Thus, the loss of the Lancastrians seriously played against the interests of Francis II.{{efn|On 16&amp;nbsp;March 1485, Richard's queen, [[Anne Neville]], died,{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=144}} and rumours spread across the country that she was murdered to pave the way for Richard to marry his niece, Elizabeth. The gossip alienated Richard from some of his northern supporters,{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=145–146}} and upset Henry across the [[English Channel]].{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=38}}  The loss of Elizabeth's hand in marriage could unravel the alliance between Henry's supporters who were Lancastrians and those who were loyalists to Edward IV.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=39}}  Anxious to secure his bride, Henry assembled approximately 2,000&amp;nbsp;men and set sail from France on 1&amp;nbsp;August.{{sfn|Lander|1981|p=325}} Henry's second successful invasion of England ended with his victory at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]].}}

===Titular Earl of Richmond===

Circa 1136, [[King Stephen of England]] named [[Alan, 1st Earl of Richmond|Alan of Penthièvre of Brittany]] (also known as Alan the Black) the 1st [[Earl of Richmond]]. After Alan, the title and its possessions (the [[Honour of Richmond]]) were typically bestowed upon the Dukes of Brittany, with a few interruptions, through the ducal reign of [[John IV, Duke of Brittany|John IV]], which ended in 1399. After John IV, the English kings would bestow the title Earl of Richmond on nobles other than the Dukes of Brittany, including [[Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond|Edmund Tudor]], Henry Tudor's father. However the dukes of Brittany from [[John V, Duke of Brittany|John V]] through Francis II would continue to use the titulary Earl of Richmond. It is possible that Francis willed whatever remained of his claims to the earldom and the Honour of Richmond to Henry Tudor. On successfully gaining the English crown after the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] in 1485, Henry VII merged the earldom and its possessions into the crown.{{efn| History has shown that those with conflicting claims to titles can work as temporary allies, such as the many cooperations between monarchs of England and France, despite their many wars.}}

===Relationship with French royalty===

====King Louis XI====
Louis XI was renowned as a cunning adversary and a master at diplomacy, if not the military arts. His contemporary nickname was "The Universal Spider," reflecting his constant political plotting.

Francis II became a member of the [[League of the Public Weal]].{{efn|League of the Public Weal in French is ''La ligue du Bien public''}} This was an alliance of feudal nobles organized in 1465 in defiance of the centralized authority of King [[Louis XI]] of France, whose declared aim was to enlarge the French royal domain by annexing all of the duchies – Burgundy, Berry, Normandy, Orléans, Brittany, etc. It was masterminded by [[Charles the Bold]], Count of Charolais, son of the [[Philip the Good|Duke of Burgundy]], with the king's brother [[Charles de Valois, Duc de Berry|Charles, Duke of Berry]], as a figurehead.

In 1467 Charles the Bold inherited the Duchy of Burgundy, which held fiefs in France that included the counties of [[County of Artois|Artois]] and [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], and the Imperial lands of [[Holland]], [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], and [[Duchy of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]]. As Duke of Burgundy, Charles aspired to forge a kingdom of his own between France and Germany, approximating the former domains of the Frankish Emperor [[Lothair I]]. In pursuit of this goal, Charles was killed in 1477 at the [[Battle of Nancy]] against [[René II, Duke of Lorraine]] and a hired army of Swiss mercenaries, and Louis was saved from his greatest adversary. The great Duchy of Burgundy was then absorbed into the Kingdom of France, and the League of the Public Weal was essentially defeated, although several members would re-ally for the [[Mad War]] in 1485.

The fortunes of Francis II and Brittany would continue to suffer after Louis XI's death in 1483, as Louis' daughter [[Anne of France]] would serve as regent for his successor, Charles VIII.

====Regency of Anne of France====
Francis II was anxious to maintain his duchy's autonomy during the minority of [[Charles VIII of France]]. He aligned himself with [[Louis XII of France|Louis, the Duke of Orléans]] (the future Louis XII) and [[Charles, Count of Angoulême]], against the regency of [[Anne of France]]. Anne had been pursuing the same underhand politics as her father, Louis XI, towards Brittany.

In focusing on relations with his neighbour France, however, Francis II neglected his own realm. His corrupt and oppressive prime minister, Guillaume Chauvin, was overthrown by  treasurer general [[Pierre Landais]] in 1477. A large part of the nobility had been bribed by Anne and Charles and supported them in their eagerness to subjugate Brittany. These nobles performed a ''coup d'état'' against Landais, who was eventually hanged in 1485.

In 1486, the Estates of Brittany confirmed the succession of Brittany on Francis' daughter [[Anne, Duchess of Brittany|Anne]], to further assure the Duchy's autonomy from France. The Treaty of Chateaubriant was signed with France in 1487 and reaffirmed Brittany's autonomy. Despite the Treaty of [[Chateaubriant]], however, the French continued to harass the Duchy. Under the leadership of [[Louis II de la Trémoille]], the French royal army struck against [[Vannes]] and [[Fougères]], controlling access to Brittany.

=====''La Guerre Folle'' (The Mad War)=====

Francis II then allied with [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], against France. [[Alain d'Albret]], a rebel lord, believing he would marry Francis' daughter Anne, reinforced the Breton army with 5000 troops supplied by the king of Spain. Maximilian I of Austria also sent 1500 men, and [[Edward Woodville, Lord Scales]], brought over a force of archers from Britain.{{sfn|Currin|page=379-412}} However Brittany was defeated 28 July 1488 in the [[Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier (1488)|Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier]]. This battle also destroyed the power-base of the warring noble leaders as Edward Woodville was killed, and Louis of Orléans and [[John IV of Chalon-Arlay|Jean, Prince of Orange]] were captured. [[Alain d'Albret]] and the [[Jean IV de Rieux|Maréchal de Rieux]] succeeded in escaping, and played an important part in continuing the conflict.

A few days later, on 10 August, Francis was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Verger]]. Under the terms of the treaty, the duke was compelled to submit himself and his duchy as a [[vassal]] of the king of France, and to expel foreign princes and troops from Brittany. It also restricted his ability to marry his children to suitors of his choosing and required that he cede territory in [[Saint-Malo]], [[Fougères]], [[Dinan]], and [[Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier|Saint-Aubin]] to the king as a guarantee that in the absence of a male successor the king would determine the succession. Francis died a few months later as a result of a fall from his horse during a leisurely ride. He left only a daughter, [[Anne of Brittany]], so the treaty was used to force her, as his successor, to marry Charles VIII, and later Louis XII. Despite the French victory and the signing of the treaty, la Guerre Folle dragged on beyond Francis II's death for three more years until December 1491, when Anne married Charles VIII.

Francis II is interred in an [[Tomb of Francis II, Duke of Brittany|elaborate tomb]] in the [[Nantes Cathedral]]. His tomb was commissioned by his daughter Anne, and is an important early example of Renaissance sculpture in France.{{efn|Francis II's tomb was designed by [[Jean Perréal]] and sculpted by [[Michel Colombe]].}}

==Family==
Francis II was married twice.

His first wife was [[Margaret of Brittany]], the eldest daughter of [[Francis I, Duke of Brittany]] (his first cousin) and [[Isabella of Scotland]]. They had one son who died shortly after his birth: 
* John, Count of Montfort (29 June- 25 August 1463)

His second wife was [[Margaret of Foix]], Princess of [[Navarre]], daughter of [[Gaston IV, Count of Foix]] and Queen [[Eleanor of Navarre]]. They had two children:
* [[Anne of Brittany]] (1477–1514), his only legitimate heir to reach adulthood.
* Isabeau of Brittany (1478–1490), betrothed to [[John III of Navarre|Jean d'Albret]] in 1481, died young, and was buried at the [[Rennes Cathedral]].

Francis II also had five illegitimate children with [[Antoinette de Maignelais]], the former mistress of King [[Charles VII of France]].

==Legacy==
Breton nobles acted to safeguard Anne as their Duchess and to protect the Duchy's autonomy for which Francis had fought so hard. In 1489 these nobles signed the [[Treaty of Redon]] with Henry VII; that treaty between Brittany and England was intended to prevent the annexation of Brittany by France. However, in 1491 [[Charles VIII of France]] invaded Brittany and forced Anne to marry him,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; thereby gaining control of the duchy. Then in 1492 Henry VII signed the [[Treaty of Etaples]] with France, effectively removing England's defense of Breton autonomy in return for promises from the French to no longer support [[Perkin Warbeck]], pretender to the English throne, and to pay a war indemnity. The duchy's autonomy was all but lost as the process of merging it into the French crown began, and Brittany's strongest ally was neutralized. [[Anne, Duchess of Brittany|Anne]], however, would become a formidable Queen Consort and would fight to preserve Brittany's autonomy and Francis II's legacy for herself, the Breton people, and her descendants.

'''Fritz-Julius Lemp''' (19 February 1913 – 9 May 1941) was a captain in the [[Kriegsmarine]] during [[World War II]] and commander of {{GS|U-28|1936|2}}, {{GS|U-30|1936|2}} and {{GS|U-110|1940|2}}. He sank the British passenger liner ''[[SS Athenia]]'' in September 1939, in violation of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague conventions]]. Germany’s responsibility for the sinking was suppressed by Admiral [[Karl Dönitz]] and the [[Nazi propaganda]]. Lemp died on 9 May 1941 when the U-boat he commanded was captured.

==Career==

===Sinking of SS ''Athenia''===
On 3 September 1939, while in command of U-30, he sank the 13,581 ton passenger ship {{SS|Athenia||2}}, the first British ship sunk in World War II. Lemp later claimed that the fact she was steering a zigzag course which seemed to be well off the normal shipping routes made him believe she was either a troopship or an [[armed merchant cruiser]]; when he realized his error he took the first steps to conceal the facts by omitting to make an entry in the submarine's log, and swearing his crew to secrecy. Adolf Hitler decided the incident should be kept secret for political reasons, and the German newspaper ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'' published an article which blamed the loss of the ''Athenia'' on the British, accusing [[Winston Churchill]], then First Lord of the Admiralty, of sinking the ship to turn neutral opinion against Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Davidson|1997|p=381}} The truth did not emerge until January 1946 at the Nuremberg trials, during the case against [[Erich Raeder|Grand Admiral Erich Raeder]], when a statement by [[Karl Dönitz|Admiral Dönitz]] was read in which he admitted that ''Athenia'' had been torpedoed by ''U-30'' and every effort had been made to cover it up, including ordering Lemp to alter his log book.{{sfn|Hadley|1995|p=111}}

===U-110===
''U-110'' was captured on 9 May 1941 in the North Atlantic south of Iceland by the destroyers {{HMS|Bulldog|H91|6}}, [[USS Hunt (DD-194)|HMS ''Broadway'']] and the British corvette {{HMS|Aubretia}}. After depth charges forced the boat to the surface, where she was shelled, Lemp ordered the crew to abandon ship and open the vents in order to sink the crippled U-boat.

Lemp was not among the 34 survivors rescued by the Allied vessels, and one account of his fate has him swimming back to the submarine when he realized that the scuttling charges were not going to detonate and either being shot and killed by the boarding party or drowning in the icy water. After the war the Germans claimed that Lemp had been shot in the water, either by Sub-Lieutenant Balme's boarding party from HMS ''Bulldog'' or from the ''Bulldog''. Balme, however, assured German journalists that no shot had been fired at any time by his party. [[Joe Baker-Cresswell]], commander of the ''Bulldog'', also denied that Lemp had been shot, and the official British explanation remains that Lemp committed suicide by drowning when he realized the consequences of his failure.{{sfn|McCormick|2008|p=44}}
Balme's party boarded the U-boat, capturing an intact [[Enigma machine]] and the code books, which would contribute to the deciphering of German military codes by British intelligence based at [[Bletchley Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Andrew, 2002.

In psychology, '''frustration''' is a common [[emotional]] response to opposition, related to [[anger]], [[annoyance]] and [[disappointment]], frustration arises from the perceived resistance to the fulfillment of an individual's [[Will (philosophy)|will]] or goal&lt;ref name="The Consolations of Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Botton|first1=Alain|title=The Consolations of Philosophy|date=April 2011|publisher=Vintage Books, a division of Random House Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-679-77917-5|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is likely to increase when a will or goal is denied or blocked. There are two types of frustration; internal and external. Internal frustration may arise from challenges in fulfilling [[Personality psychology|personal]] [[objective (goal)|goals]], [[Desire (philosophy)|desires]], instinctual drives and needs, or dealing with perceived [[:wikt:deficiency|deficiencies]], such as a lack of [[confidence]] or [[fear]] of social situations. [[Emotional conflict|Conflict]], such as when one has competing goals that interfere with one another, can also be an internal source of frustration and can create [[cognitive dissonance]]. External causes of frustration involve conditions outside an individual's control, such as a physical roadblock, a difficult task, or the perception of wasting time.&lt;ref name="Frustration"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frustration|url=http://www.psychologistanywhereanytime.com/emotional_problems_psychologist/pyschologist_frustration.htm|website=Psychologist Anywhere Anytime|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple ways individuals [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] with frustration such as [[passive–aggressive behavior]], [[anger]], or violence, although frustration may also propel positive processes via enhanced effort and strive.&lt;ref name="FrustrationIndivDiff"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeronimus | displayauthors=etal|title= Encyclopedia of Personality and Individual Differences |chapter=Frustration|date=Jan 2018|publisher=Springer |location=New York|editors= Zeigler-Hill, V., Shackelford, T.K. |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-28099-8_815-1|page=1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This broad range of potential outcomes makes it difficult to identify the original cause(s) of frustration, as the responses may be indirect. However, a more direct and common response is a propensity towards aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The [[Frustration aggression theory|frustration–aggression hypothesis]] | last = Miller | first = NE | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 48 | issue = 4 |date=July 1941 | pages = 337–42 | doi=10.1037/h0055861}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Frustration originates from feelings of uncertainty and insecurity which stems from a sense of inability to fulfill needs. If the needs of an individual are blocked, uneasiness and frustration are more likely to occur. When these needs are constantly ignored or unsatisfied, anger, depression, loss of self-confidence, annoyance, aggression, and sometimes violence are likely to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Overcome Frustration|url=http://www.eruptingmind.com/how-to-overcome-frustration/|website=Erupting Mind|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needs can be blocked two different ways; internally and externally. Internal blocking happens within an individual's mind, either through lack of ability, confidence, conflicting goals and desires, and/or fears. External blocking happens to an individual outside their control such as physical roadblocks, difficult tasks, or perceived waste of time.

Some people are predisposed towards feelings of frustration, indexed in terms of [[temperament]] (frustration), in adolescence and [[neuroticism]] in adulthood.&lt;ref name="FrustrationIndivDiff"/&gt; Temperamental frustration is associated with perceptual alterations including changes in perceived relationship affection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Laceulle, O.M. | displayauthors=etal| year = 2015 | title = Why Not Everyone Gets Their Fair Share of Stress: Adolescent's Perceived Relationship Affection Mediates Associations Between Temperament and Subsequent Stressful Social Events | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/per.1989/full| journal = European Journal of Personality| volume = 29 | issue = 2| page = 125 | doi=10.1002/per.1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==

Frustration can be considered a problem–response behavior and can have a number of effects, depending on the mental health of the individual. In positive cases, this frustration will build until a level that is too great for the individual to contain or allow to continue, and thus produce action directed at solving the inherent problem in a disposition that does not cause social or physical harm. In negative cases, however, the individual may perceive the source of frustration to be outside their control, and thus the frustration will continue to build, leading eventually to further problematic behavior (e.g. violent reaction against perceived oppressors or enemies).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berkowitz|first=Leonard|title=Frustration-aggression hypothesis: Examination and reformulation.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.106.1.59|journal=Psychological Bulletin|language=en|volume=106|issue=1|pages=59–73|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.106.1.59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stubborn refusal to respond to new conditions affecting the goal, such as removal or modification of the barrier, sometimes occurs. As pointed out by [[J.A.C. Brown]], severe punishment may cause individuals to continue non-adaptive behavior blindly: "Either it may have an effect opposite to that of reward and as such, discourage the repetition of the act, or, by functioning as a frustrating agent, it may lead to fixation and the other symptoms of frustration as well. It follows that [[punishment]] is a dangerous tool, since it often has effects which are entirely the opposite of those desired".&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;{{Citation | first = JAC | last = Brown | title = The Social Psychology of Industry | place = Baltimore, MD | publisher = Penguin | year = 1954 | pages = 253–54}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frustration tolerance==
Frustration tolerance is one's ability to resist becoming frustrated when facing difficult tasks. Having a [[low frustration tolerance]] is related to trait anger and a higher level of frustration tolerance is related to lower levels of anger and longer persistence on difficult tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Szasz|first1=P.L.|last2=Szentagotai|first2=A.|last3=Hofmann|first3=S.|title=The Effect of Emotion Regulation Strategies on Anger|journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy|date=30 November 2010|volume=49|issue=2|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000579671000238X|accessdate=27 November 2016|doi=10.1016/j.brat.2010.11.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a child with a high frustration tolerance may be able to deal with repeated challenges and failures without experiencing significant frustration. The child with a low frustration tolerance can be quick to experience frustration when asked to perform tasks of moderate difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liden|first1=C.|title=9 Traits You Should Know About Your Temperament|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000579671000238X|website=The Being Well Center|accessdate=26 November 2016|doi=10.1016/j.brat.2010.11.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5751">'''Gaius Asinius Gallus Saloninus''' (before 38 BC - AD 33) was the son of [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|Gaius Asinius Pollio]], consul in 40 BC, and [[Quinctia (gens)|Quinctia]]. He is best known as the second husband of [[Vipsania Agrippina|Vipsania]], eldest daughter of [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] and first wife of [[Tiberius]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Annales (Tacitus)|Annales]]'' [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/tac/a01010.htm 1.2]&lt;/ref&gt;, who ultimately imprisoned him.

== Biography ==
In 11 BC he married [[Vipsania Agrippina]], daughter of [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] and his first wife [[Caecilia Attica]], and the former wife of [[Tiberius]]. Their union proved fruitful and produced at least six children. Gallus also claimed true paternity of [[Julius Caesar Drusus]], earning him Tiberius' animosity.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, LVII, 2.7&lt;/ref&gt; If Gallus' claim was true, he might also have been the father of the child Vipsania was expecting on her divorce. 

He is mentioned among the speakers at the senate meeting discussing Augustus' funeral in 14; on the subject of last honours he proposed that the funeral train should pass under a triumphal gateway.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'', 1.8.1.&lt;/ref&gt; When the senate met to discuss the transfer of power, Gallus made a joke at Tiberius' expense; when Tiberius remarked he would undertake charge of whichever department was assigned to him, Gallus responded by asking him to choose whichever he wishes. This embarrassed Tiberius publicly, and although Gallus attempted to quell the emperor's anger, he was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'', Book I, 12.1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', Book LVII, 2.6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 30, he was arrested on Tiberius' order. At Tiberius' instigation, the Senate declared Gallus a public enemy, and he was held in conditions of solitary confinement:&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]] 58.3&lt;/ref&gt; "He had no companion or servant with him, spoke to no one, and saw no one, except when he was compelled to take food. And the food was of such quality and amount as neither to afford him any satisfaction or strength nor yet to allow him to die."

He died in prison of starvation in the year 33 (others mistakenly say 30).&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annales'' 6.23&lt;/ref&gt; When Agrippina died in October of that same year, Tiberius accused her of "having had Asinius Gallus as a paramour and being driven by his death to loathe existence".&lt;ref&gt;''Annales'' 6.25&lt;/ref&gt; His name was erased from public monuments (a practice known as ''[[damnatio memoriae]]''), though they were restored after Tiberius' death.

== Marriage and children ==
Asinius Gallus' marriage to Vispania (11 BC) produced the following known children:

*[[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 23)|Gaius Asinius Pollio]] 
**He was consul in 23; exiled as an accuser of a conspiracy and later was put to death on orders from Empress [[Valeria Messalina]].
*[[Marcus Asinius Agrippa]] 
**He was consul in 25 and died in 26
*Gnaeus Asinius Saloninus, or simply Asinius Saloninus. 
**[[Tacitus]] describes him as an ‘eminent’ person. Saloninus was intended to marry one of the granddaughters of Emperor Tiberius.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' 3.75&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 22.
*[[Servius Asinius Celer]]. 
**He was ''consul suffectus'' in 38. From Emperor [[Caligula]] he purchased a fish at an enormous price. He is mentioned in  [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s satire ''[[The Pumpkinification of Claudius]]'', where he is listed among the many people killed by that emperor. His death probably occurred sometime before mid-47. Asinius Celer seems to have had a daughter by the name of Asinia Agrippina, though her existence is obscure.
*Lucius Asinius Gallus (sometimes wrongly called Gallo). 
**In 46 he conspired with [[Titus Statilius Taurus Corvinus]] against [[Claudius]] and was forced to go into exile. [[Cassius Dio]]&lt;ref&gt;60.27.5&lt;/ref&gt; describes him as being "very small and ugly". Later rehabilitated, he became [[Roman consul|Consul]] in 62.
*Gnaeus Asinius. 
**His existence is recorded by the townsfolk of Puteoli, whose patron he was.&lt;ref&gt;{{CIL|10|1682}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may have been identical with Asinius Saloninus or the foregoing Asinius Gallus. Since the ''Asinius Gallus'' seems to have been the ''Lucius Asinius Gallus'' who became a Consul in 60, by exclusion of parts the ''Gnaeus Asinius'' must be the ''Asinius Saloninus''.

== In fiction ==

In the BBC television series [[I, Claudius]], Gallus is portrayed by [[Charles Kay]].

In Lloyd C Douglas's novel ''The Robe'', Gallus is furnished with a fictional daughter Diana, the love interest of the story.

'''Gapjil''' ([[Hangul]]: 갑질) refers to the arrogant and authoritarian attitude or actions of people in [[South Korea]] who have positions of power over others.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opendict.korean.go.kr/dictionary/view?sense_no=1295950&amp;viewType=confirm|title=우리말샘 - 내용 보기|publisher=opendict.korean.go.kr|language=en|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gapjil is a [[neologism]] made by combining the word '''Gap''' (갑; 甲)—which is used to introduce the first party in a contract, but also refers to a party's superior status—and '''jil''' (-질), a [[suffix]] that negatively refers to particular actions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.econovill.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=277288|title=끊이지 않는 '갑질'의 역사, 유형을 진단해 보면 - 이코노믹리뷰|date=2016-01-12|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko-KR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=2070466&amp;cid=55570&amp;categoryId=55570|title=갑을관계|access-date=2017-12-03|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a phenomenon associated with the hierarchical nature of Korean society and work culture—a structure which results in the social superiority of those with higher wealth. Various incidents, such as the [[nutrage|nut rage]], have brought this phenomenon to the attention of the world media.

== Causes ==
Song Jae-ryung, a professor of [[sociology]] at [[Kyung Hee University|Kyunghee University]], points out that Gapjil is not simply a matter of an individual's [[morality]], but a societal problem. As the bottom of Korean society is constituted by the repressive role of Gap and submissive attitude of Eul, individuals follow the [[culture]] of the elite. In other words, the cause of gapjil is a cultural tendency for people to merely perform the roles which are shaped by the high [[power distance]] in Korea. This is why an individual who was Eul in another situation is doing the same thing (gapjil) in another relationship when he or she becomes another Gap. In order to solve the gapjil problem, Prof. Song says, each individual needs to admit the social position that is different horizontally, not vertically, and the social atmosphere that fosters this awareness needs to be formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.kukinews.com/news/article.html?no=359870|title=[기획] "돈이면 다냐?" 갑갑한 대한민국… 갑(甲)질 공통점 살펴보니…|publisher=news.kukinews.com|language=ko|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of gapjil ==
According to an article in Economic Review, a Korean magazine, there are some obvious types of gapjil depending on the context: owner gapjil, push-driven distribution gapjil, and passion-pay.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Owner gapjil ===
'Owner gapjil' is the most common type of gapjil, where representatives or [[Chaebol|executive family members of a company]] treat their employees with contempt, using abusive language or even assault. Owner gapjil reflects the mistaken view that employers can treat employees however they want because of the extreme vertical relationship between the two.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== 'Monggo Food' Kim Man-sik scandal ====
On 23 December 2015, there was a report that Kim Man-sik, honorary president of Monggo Food, had used abusive language and assaulted his [[chauffeur]] 'B'. The assaulted employee said, "President Kim indulges in violence and hurl abuses almost like a habit, if his mood is bad". After Monggo Food posted an apology on its website on 23 December, Kim Man-sik and Kim Hyeon-seung, CEO of the firm, apologized to the public and to the person directly involved, on 25 December in a press conference. Although there had been a disagreement with victims concerning a problem of reinstatement, an amicable settlement was made with the victims of the assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ilyosisa.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=92779|title=몽고식품 '긴박했던 4박5일' 풀스토리 - 일요시사|date=2015-12-31|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 April 2016, the Masan Branch of the Changwon District Public Prosecutor's Office requested that Kim Man-sik issue a summary order of 7,000,000 [[South Korean won|won]] (about 6,000 dollars as of July 2018) in fines relating to habitual assaults, violence and violation of labour standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sisafocus.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=144705|title='회장님 갑질' 몽고식품 김만식 전 회장 벌금형|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 'M&amp;M' Choi Cheol-won scandal ====
In October 2010, Choi Cheol-won, the CEO of M&amp;M, called a tank truck driver—who had gone on a demonstration in front of the [[SK Group|SK]] headquarters—to his office and assaulted them with such things as a baseball bat. As a result, the driver suffered injuries requiring two weeks of medical treatment. This incident was reported in the [[editorial]] program of [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]], which aired on 28 November 2010. Huge amounts of public criticism, particularly resulting from a memorandum that had been written to certify that the driver was given 20,000,000 won (about 20,000 dollars as of July 2018) as compensation for the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nocutnews.co.kr/news/778110|title="SK 최태원 회장 사촌동생, 야구방망이로 노동자 폭행"|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko-KR}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Choi Cheol-won had been charged on 30 November, the police started to investigate the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mbn.mk.co.kr/pages/news/newsView.php?category=mbn00003&amp;news_seq_no=1016552|title=경찰 '맷값 폭행' 최철원 입국 통보 요청|publisher=mbn.mk.co.kr|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 February 2011, the [[Seoul]] Central District [[Court]] sentenced him to 18 months in prison and the appellate tribunal sentenced him to 18 months in prison with three years of [[probation]] and 120 hours of community service. The judgement of the court's decision saying, "Social criticism is a reason for the sentence" caused controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fnnews.com/news/201102081101576523?t=y|title='맷값 폭행'최철원 징역 1년6월|date=2011-02-08|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 'Korean Air' Cho Hyun-min scandal ====
When [[Korean Air]] executive ‘Cho Hyun-min’ allegedly sprayed water on company's employees, foreign media paid attention. In March 2018, the allegations of yelling and spraying water to an advertising agent caused rising controversy. When concerns over Cho's behavior became widespread, Korean Air explained, “It is true that during the meeting, the water rose and splashed when the bucket fell on the floor, but it did not spray water on the staff”.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}  Cho apologized for her behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2018/04/15/0302000000AEN20180415000800320.html|title=Korean Air heiress returns home amid probe into violent tantrum|work=Yonhap News Agency|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident caused many foreign media to start using the word "gapjil" directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/world/asia/nut-rage-sister-korean-air.html|title=Sister of Korean ‘Nut Rage’ Heiress Accused of Throwing Her Own Tantrum|last=Sang-Hun|first=Choe|date=2018-04-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Push-driven distribution gapjil ===
'Push-driven distribution gapjil' is a type of gapjil where large corporations make pressing delivery (or supply) demands to small businesses (franchises).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Namyang Dairy Products Corporation high-pressure sales to franchises scandal ====
[[File:Namyang logo.png|thumb|logo of Namyang]]
In May 2013, Namyang Co. was criticised following an accusation that the firm had pressed local franchises to buy products for a long time, as well as a tape-recording of rough words to local owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ktv.go.kr/content/view?content_id=462589|title='밀어내기' 전방위 조사···남양유업 '사과'|publisher=ktv.go.kr|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Namyang Co. caused more than 20 billion wons' worth (about 18 million dollars as of July 2018) of damage through illegal activities—such as high-pressure sales and shifting wages of salesmen to local franchises—for the past seven years, for which the Seoul Central District Court convicted it in January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?code=940301&amp;artid=201401242119415|title=법원 "남양유업 '밀어내기' 모두 유죄 인정"|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this case, the chronic gapjil problem in Korean society became a public social issue. There was also a boycott against Namyang Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ytn.co.kr/_ln/0103_201305101519365078|title=남양유업 사과, 진정성이 없다 [YTN FM]|publisher=www.ytn.co.kr|language=ko|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hyundai Mobis high-pressure sales scandal ====
[[File:Hyundai Mobis Logo.svg|thumb|Hyundai Mobis Logo]]
In September 2017, [[Hyundai Mobis]] was suspected of pressure to achieve sales goals and forced sales by 1600 branches of local maintenance shops from January 2010 to November 2013. The manager of the local shops was pressed to buy unnecessary parts of an automobile under the name of "Random Sales" and "Negotiated Sales" in order to achieve the goal of the head office. Hyundai Mobis admitted carrying out these acts and since then has been establishing a plan to ensure they do not reoccur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.donga.com/3/all/20170911/86278451/1|title=현대모비스 '물량 밀어내기' 혐의 인정… 공정위 "미흡하다"|date=2017-09-12|work=동아닷컴|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Passion-pay ===
[[File:Lee Sang-Bong from acrofan.jpg|thumb|Lie Sang Bong]]
Passion-pay is a type of labour extortion where the corporation pays less than minimum wage, or even nothing, for the labor of young job seekers who have trouble finding a job.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Lie Sang Bong Design Studio's passion-pay scandal ====

In January 2015, Lie Sang Bong design studio, which is managed by Korean fashion designer Lie Sang Bong, was embroiled in controversy about passion-pay. Although the studio imposed excessive workloads on workers, the studio offered relatively low wages: 100,000 won (about 100 dollars as of July 2018) for apprentices, 300,000 won (about 300 dollars) for interns and 1,100,000 won (about 1,100 dollars) for regular workers. After the controversy, Lie Sang Bong said "I deeply apologized to the youths of the fashion industry who get hurt with working environment and treatment, and I'll try to improve the overall problem of the fashion industry in this opportunity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ytn.co.kr/_ln/0103_201501151554510194|title='열정페이' 논란 이상봉 결국 사과|publisher=www.ytn.co.kr|language=ko|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seoul National University Hospital.jpg|thumb|Seoul National University Hospital]]

==== Seoul National University Hospital nurse passion-pay scandal ====
In September 2017, [[Seoul National University Hospital]] (SNUH) was in a controversy because it did passion-pay on newly graduated nurses for five years since 2012, for "probationary education period". It turned out that SNUH only paid 360,000 won (about 360 dollars as of July 2018) for 24 days work to 1,212 nurses in their period of education. Based on an eight hour working day, the sum of 360,000 won is equivalent to an hourly rate of 1,800 won (about 2 dollars), which is far below the [[minimum wage]] of 6,470 won (about 6 dollars). The hospital explained that they did not know whether they should pay full wages during the training session. In addition, they plan to provide retroactive payment to nurses under three years, which is a period appointed by the recent labor standard law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.kmib.co.kr/article/view.asp?arcid=0011807211&amp;code=61121211&amp;sid1=o|title=서울대병원 첫 월급 36만원…용돈보다 적은 간호사 열정페이|publisher=news.kmib.co.kr|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social responses ==
=== Boycott ===
[[Boycott]] can be defined as a movement of consumers' refusal to buy a particular item in order to accomplish a specific purpose.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1104927&amp;cid=40942&amp;categoryId=31614|title=불매운동|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike gapjil (which is a structural problem between 'Gap' and 'Eul', like the franchise-maker and the retailer), the boycott campaign showed that it can explode instantly when the problem touches consumer's feelings.&lt;ref name="갑질과 불매는 비례하지 않는다? - 더피알"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.the-pr.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=24561|title=갑질과 불매는 비례하지 않는다? - 더피알|date=2017-10-02|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because consumers think that not consuming products of gapjil firms is the best thing they can do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.insight.co.kr/news/78758|title=소비자 불매운동 불러온 대한민국 '갑질' 7|work=인사이트|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko-KR}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement suggests that the gapjil of company owners or executives is becoming a 'self-harm' activity which decreases corporate profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news2day.co.kr/82049|title=[뉴투기획] 똘똘 뭉친 소비자들, 갑질기업에 불매운동으로 응징|publisher=www.news2day.co.kr|language=ko|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts emphasize that in order to reduce corporate ethical problems, such as gapjil, consumers need to change their perception as a consumer in a larger frame of mind. Corporations will be changed when consumer involvement such as resentment at gapjil and boycott is increased.&lt;ref name="갑질과 불매는 비례하지 않는다? - 더피알"/&gt; A consumer movement group staged boycott campaigns and received favourable responses from consumers, but there has not yet been a massive and organised boycott.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== 24-hour call center for reporting damages by gapjil ===
On 11 April 2016, the Korean [[civil society organisation]] Public Welfare Committee (PWC) opened a 24-hour [[call centre]] for reporting gapjil damages and behavior. It is operated for rooting out irregular practices. PWC explained that the purpose of the call center was to prevent gapjil behavior, which is prevalent in South Korean society, and to conduct criminal and civil measures through case verification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/739236.html#csidxb1f9587a88ced499d98289a45266476|title="잘못된 갑질 신고하세요"시민단체 24시간 콜센터|date=2016-04-11|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Kim Sang-jo was inaugurated as chairperson of the [[Fair Trade Commission (South Korea)|Korean Fair Trade Commission]] (FTC), the FTC started an investigation of all industrial head offices and franchises to resolve all gapjil cases in four major areas: [[Distribution (business)|distribution]], [[Affiliate (commerce)|affiliate]], subcontract, and [[Franchising|franchise]].

Beginning 10 August 2017, the FTC began investigating the transactions between headquarters and agencies, which targeted about 4,800 headquarters, 70 franchises and group of franchises of all domestic industry. The investigation was conducted as a survey targeting the headquarters between August and September, and since then targeted the franchises and groups of franchises from September to December. The FTC said the purpose of the investigation was to secure basic data to prevent unfair trade practices between headquarters and franchises, in order to prepare policies and improve the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pressian.com/news/article.html?no=165286|title=공정위, '갑질' 정조준...70만개 대리점 전수조사|publisher=www.pressian.com|language=ko|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ombudsman ===
In July 2017, the FTC established an [[ombudsman]] for permanent surveillance of protection measures about franchises. The ombudsman was organised with former and current merchants with experience in franchise trading and 13 members of the FTC. They planned to expand the members to 30, including wholesale, retail, and service sectors. The ombudsman regularly monitors trading practices in franchise sectors and reports to the FTC when signs of unfair trade are detected. In addition, they state their opinion in policy enforcement, and they suggest ideas to improve the system by collecting problems information on the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/economy_general/804522.html|title=프랜차이즈 갑질, 공정위가 상시 감시한다|date=2017-07-27|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unfair damage counseling center in Seoul ===
[[File:Seal of Seoul Metropolitan Government.png|thumb|Seal of Seoul|alt=|150x150px]]
For the first time in local government, the [[Seoul Metropolitan Government]] started to eradicate unfair practices in the franchise industry, declaring, "2016 economic democratisation city, Seoul". The Seoul Metropolitan Government has operated an unfair damage counselling centre, where anyone who suffered from unfair damages can report their case through the member's office.

Not only the franchiser who is operating the franchise but also an ex-franchiser and even a group of franchisers can report and gather unfair cases of members. When the report is received, first, the government identifies the exact facts of the incident through an in-depth consultation with the franchiser who reported the incident, then meeting with a group of franchisers. According to the issue, the government recommends to the headquarters of the franchise a voluntary corrective action or handles arrangements. Depending on the degree of violation of the law, the investigation request to the FTC or the prosecution are reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ecomedia.co.kr/news/newsview.php?ncode=1065594442127896|title=서울시, 프랜차이즈 가맹정 '갑(甲)질 피해' 실태점검|work=환경미디어}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media responses ==
In December 2014, the [[nut rage incident]] was covered by numerous international media, and gapjil reached a level of global prominence. In February 2015, the [[Reuters]] news agency reported about Korean gapjil culture and the judgement of the nut rage incident. According to the article, it seemed that Korean gapjil culture originates from a traditional vertical hierarchy in Korean society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-nuts-backlash/nut-rage-prompts-south-korea-to-consider-law-against-high-handed-conduct-idUSKBN0LJ05Z20150215|title='Nut rage' prompts South Korea to consider law against high-handed conduct|date=February 15, 2015|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, ''[[The Independent]]'', British newspaper, reported on the No-Look Pass issue of Korean politician [[Kim Moo-sung]], and pointed out that most gapjil is done by Korean adult men, especially middle aged men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/south-korean-politician-kim-moo-sung-suitcase-push-viral-video-entitled-middle-aged-men-a7753041.html|title=Politician's suitcase incident goes viral for summing up entitled middle-aged men|date=2017-05-24|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geriatric trauma'''  refers to a [[trauma (medicine)|traumatic]] injury that occurs to an [[Old age|elderly]] person. The three prevailing causes of traumatic death in the elderly are [[Falling (accident)|falls]] (which account for 40% of traumatic death in this age group), [[traffic collision]]s and [[burn]]s.&lt;ref name=pre/&gt;&lt;ref name=ATLS2008&gt;{{cite book|first=American College of Surgeons|last=Committee on Trauma|authorlink=American College of Surgeons|title=ATLS: Advanced Trauma Life Support Program for Doctors|publisher=American College of Surgeons|location=Chicago|edition=8th|chapter=Chapter 10: Extremes of Age|pages=243–74|year=2008|isbn=978-1-880696-31-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biomechanics of injury==
A progressive decline in [[central nervous system]] function leads to a loss of [[proprioception]], [[Equilibrioception|balance]] and overall [[motor coordination]], as well as a reduction in [[eye–hand coordination]], [[Mental chronometry|reaction time]] and an unsteady [[gait]].&lt;ref name=ATLS2008/&gt; These degenerative changes are often accompanied by [[osteoarthritis]] (degenerative joint disease), which leads to a reduction in the [[range of motion]] of the head, neck and extremities. Furthermore, elderly people frequently take multiple [[Pharmaceutical drug|medications]] for control of various diseases and conditions. The side effects of some of these medications may either predispose to injury, or may cause a minor trauma to result in a much more severe condition. For example, a person taking [[warfarin]] (Coumadin) and/or [[clopidogrel]] (Plavix) may experience a life-threatening [[intracranial hemorrhage]] after sustaining a relatively minor [[closed head injury]], as a result of the defect in the [[Hemostasis|hemostatic mechanism]] caused by such medications. The combined effects of these changes greatly predisposes elderly people to traumatic injury. Both the incidence of falls and the severity of associated complications increase with advancing age.&lt;ref name=ATLS2008/&gt;

==Physiologic differences in the elderly==
Virtually all organ systems experience a progressive decline in function as a result of the [[ageing|aging]] process.&lt;ref name="pre"&gt;{{cite book |author=Grande, Christopher M. |author2=Søreide, Eldar |title=Prehospital trauma care|publisher=Marcel Dekker|location=New York, N.Y |year=2001 |pages=441–50|isbn=0-8247-0537-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brady"&gt;{{cite book |author=Campbell, John Creighton|title=ITLS|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall |location=Upper Saddle River, N.J |year=2008 |pages=279–87 |isbn=0-13-237982-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is a decline in [[circulatory system]] function caused in part by thickening of the [[cardiac muscle]]. This can lead to [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure]] or [[pulmonary edema]].&lt;ref name="btls"&gt;{{cite book|author=Campbell, John Creighton|title=Basic trauma life support for paramedics and other advanced providers|publisher=Brady/Prentice Hall Health|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|year=2000|pages=231–8|isbn=0-13-084584-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Peitzman2008&gt;{{cite book|veditors=Peitzman AB, Rhodes M, Schwab CW, Yealy DM, Fabian TC|title=The Trauma Manual|edition=3rd|year=2008|chapter=Chapter 48: Geriatric Trauma|pages=524–32|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0-7817-6275-8|url=https://www.amazon.com/Trauma-Manual-Surgery-Lippincott-Formerly/dp/0781762758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Atrophy]] of the brain begins to accelerate at around seventy years of age,&lt;ref name=Peitzman2008/&gt; which leads to a significant reduction in brain mass. Since the skull does not decrease in size with the brain, there is significant space between the two when this occurs which puts the elderly at a higher risk of a [[subdural hematoma]] after sustaining a closed head injury.&lt;ref name="brady"/&gt; The reduction of brain size can lead to issues with [[Visual perception|eyesight]], [[cognition]] and [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]].&lt;ref name=Peitzman2008/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Elderly people are the most rapidly growing [[Demographics|demographic]] in [[Developed country|developed nations]]. Although they sustain traumatic injury less commonly than [[Pediatric trauma|children]] and young adults, the [[mortality rate]] for trauma in the elderly is higher than in younger people.&lt;ref name=ATLS2008/&gt; In the United States, this population accounts for 14% of all traumatic injuries, of which a majority are secondary to falls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = 8th|title = Rosen's Emergency Medicine - Concepts and Clinical Practice|url = |publisher = Saunders|date = August 29, 2013|isbn = 9781455706051|first = John|last = Marx|first2 = Robert|last2 = Hockberger|first3 = Ron|last3 = Walls|pages = 324–9}}&lt;!--|access-date = 2015-04-21--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
===Early fights===
Davis made his debut at the age of 18 on February 22, 2013 against Desi Williams, who had a professional record of no wins and 4 losses, all by stoppage. The fight took place at the [[D.C.

By August 2014, Davis had recorded 8 wins and no losses, with all wins coming inside the distance. Davis was taken the six round distance for the first time in October 2014 against veteran 28 year old [[Germán Meraz|German Meraz]] (47–31–1, 25 KOs).

===IBF super featherweight champion===

==== Davis vs. Pedraza ====
On November 15, 2016 ESPN announced that Davis would challenge for the [[List of IBF world champions#Junior lightweight|IBF junior lightweight]] title against undefeated [[José Pedraza (boxer)|José Pedraza]] (22–0, 12 KOs) on January 14, 2017 at the [[Barclays Center]] in [[Brooklyn]] on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. The fight would take place as an undercard fight to the super middleweight world title unification fight between [[James DeGale|James Degale]] and [[Badou Jack]]. The IBF granted Pedraza an exception to fight Davis, as he had a mandatory fight against British boxer [[Liam Walsh (boxer)|Liam Walsh]] looming. prior to the fight being announced, Mayweather promotions matchmaker tried to make a deal for Davis to fight titleholder [[Jason Sosa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/18051178/jose-pedraza-defend-130-pound-crown-gervonta-davis-jan-14|title=Pedraza to defend title vs. Mayweather protege Davis|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis defeated Pedraza in a seventh-round knockout to win the IBF junior lightweight title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/18476170/gervonta-davis-takes-junior-lightweight-belt-away-jose-pedraza|title=Gervonta Davis takes junior lightweight belt away from Jose Pedraza|author=Dan Rafael|date=January 15, 2017|website=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fight, Davis said that he had studied the early career of his promoter and mentor, [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]], in order to stay composed. He said, "I had a lot of experience [from the amateur ranks], but I learned how to keep my composure. Floyd told me to stay calm, and I studied Floyd Mayweather [videos] when he was 'Pretty Boy.' My uppercut was my best shot, and it was landing all night. It felt really good to fight the way I did. I could take it and dish it out." Mayweather Jr. himself enthusiastically branded his protégé as the future of boxing. For the fight, Davis earned $75,000 compared to Pedraza, who earned the lions share of $225,000, in what was his third defence. At the time of stoppage, Davis was ahead 59–55 on all three judges scorecards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxingscene.com/gervonta-davis-this-i-studied-pretty-boy-floyd-not-money--112676 "Gervonta Davis: For This I Studied 'Pretty Boy' Floyd, Not 'Money'"].

His first attempt, although he was naked, he weighed two ounces over. He was then given the two hours to attempt to lose the extra weight, although he came back earlier thinking he had lost it. He eventually met the limit of 130 pounds on his third attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/gervonta-davis-makes-weight-on-third-try-walsh-fight--116734|title=Gervonta Davis Makes Weight on Third Try for Walsh Fight - Boxing News|website=www.boxingscene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis stopped Walsh in the third-round to retain his IBF title. After two cagey rounds, which were controlled by Davis, he came out with power punches at the start of the third. Walsh's legs looked to give way and David pounced with accurate hooks to the head, eventually dropping Walsh. Walsh beat the count on unsteady legs. The fight resumed and Davis went on the attack again, connected with every shot he threw, forcing referee Michael Alexander to stop the fight. The time of stoppage was 2 minutes and 11 seconds of round 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/gervonta-davis-takes-out-liam-walsh-three-rounds-results--116783|title=Gervonta Davis Takes Out Liam Walsh in Three Rounds - Boxing News|website=www.boxingscene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many at ringside believed the stoppage was premature, including Walsh, "That was a bad stoppage. He's very fast and very active but it was too quick. He won fair and square but in England sometimes they stop the fight too early." Davis believed he would have caught Walsh eventually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/19426231/floyd-mayweather-protege-gervonta-davis-outclasses-liam-walsh-london|title=Davis outclasses Walsh in three rounds|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/39989209|title=Gervonta Davis retains IBF super-featherweight title by stopping Liam Walsh|date=2017-05-20|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight was shown live on Showtime in the USA averaging 228,000 viewers and peaking at 253,000 viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.badlefthook.com/2017/5/24/15684896/crawford-diaz-sets-the-bar-for-hbo-ratings-this-year|title=Crawford-Diaz sets the bar for HBO ratings this year|date=2017-05-24|website=Bad Left Hook|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====  Davis vs. Fonseca ====
According to [[TMZ|TMZ Sports]] in early July 2017, it was reported that Davis would feature in the co-main event of [[Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Conor McGregor]] on August 26, 2017 at the [[T-Mobile Arena]] in Paradise, Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2720323-gervonta-davis-will-fight-in-co-main-event-at-mayweather-vs-mcgregor|title=Gervonta Davis Will Fight in Co-Main Event at Mayweather vs. McGregor|last=Chiari|first=Mike|work=Bleacher Report|access-date=2017-07-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 29, The Ring Magazine reported that Davis would likely defend his IBF title against former WBO champion [[Román Martínez (boxer)|Román 'Rocky' Martínez]], whose last fight was a knockout loss to Vasyl Lomachenko in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ringtv.com/505704-gervonta-davis-likely-defend-title-roman-martinez-aug-26/|title=Gervonta Davis likely to defend title against Roman Martinez on Aug. 26 - The Ring|date=2017-07-29|work=The Ring|access-date=2017-07-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 10, Ringtv reported that Davis would instead fight unbeaten prospect [[Francisco Fonseca (boxer)|Francisco Fonseca]] (19-0-1, 13 KOs), who at the time was ranked number 7 by the IBF. According to some sources, the potential fight with Martínez was dropped due to notice and Martínez would not have had enough time to make the 130 pound limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ringtv.com/513684-gervonta-davis-defend-title-francisco-fonseca-aug-26/|title=Gervonta Davis to defend title against Francisco Fonseca on Aug. 26 - The Ring|date=2017-08-10|work=The Ring|access-date=2017-08-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the fight being announced, the IBF had ordered Fonseca to fight their number 3 ranked [[Billy Dib]] (42-4, 24 KOs) in a final eliminator, as they were the two highest ranked available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/dib-vs-fonseca-eliminator-set-gervonta-davis-mandatory--119055|title=Dib vs. Fonseca Eliminator To Set Gervonta Davis' Mandatory - Boxing News|website=www.boxingscene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the weigh in, Fonseca came in at the 130 pound limit. Davis showed up an hour late and came in at 132 pounds, 2 pounds over the weight limit. Davis declined to weigh in after two hours, forcing the IBF to strip him of the title. The title was declared vacant, but the title would be still up for grabs if Fonseca secured victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingnewsonline.net/gervonta-davis-loses-ibf-title-on-the-scales/|title=Gervonta Davis loses IBF title on the scales - Boxing News|date=2017-08-26|work=Boxing News|access-date=2017-08-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In what was billed as an easy fight for Davis, he won the fight via knockout in round 8, with the ending being controversial. The final punch appeared to be an illegal punch to the back of the head to Fonseca and referee Russell Mora counted him out 39 seconds into the round. After the fight, Davis mocked Fonseca.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ringtv.com/515298-gervonta-davis-stops-francisco-fonseca-mayweather-mcgregor-card/|title=GERVONTA DAVIS STOPS FRANCISCO FONSECA ON MAYWEATHER-MCGREGOR CARD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fonseca appeared hurt before the knockout blow, which Davis, who was being booed by the crowd, explained to [[Jim Gray (sportscaster)|Jim Gray]] of Showtime in the post fight interview, “I actually caught him with a body shot before that and he was hurt. So he took advantage of me hitting him in the back of his head and went down.” With the win, Davis scored his 10th straight knockout victory. Due to Davis winning the fight, the IBF title remained vacant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/gervonta-davis-knocks-out-francisco-fonseca-results--119878|title=Gervonta Davis Knocks Out Francisco Fonseca in Eight - Boxing News|website=www.boxingscene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/20468285/badou-jack-demolishes-nathan-cleverly-win-light-heavyweight-belt|title=Mayweather-McGregor undercard recap: Jack demolishes Cleverly to win light heavyweight belt|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the fight, Davis earned a purse of $600,000 compared to the amount $35,000 that Fonseca received.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/8/25/16207748/purses-revealed-for-all-fighters-on-floyd-mayweather-conor-mcgregor-card-ufc-boxing-mma+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk|title=Purses revealed: Mayweather $100M, McGregor $30M|work=Bloody Elbow|access-date=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== WBA (super) super featherweight champion ===

==== Davis vs. Cuellar ====
On November 15, 2017 Leonard Ellerbe, CEO of Mayweather Promotions announced that Davis would be making his in ring return in the first quarter of 2018 alongside stablemate Badou Jack. He also revealed that Davis would fight a high-level opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/gervonta-davis-set-return-early-2018-says-ellerbe--122460|title=Gervonta Davis Set To Return in Early 2018, Says Ellerbe - Boxing News|website=www.boxingscene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mayweather Promotions CEO Leonard Ellerbe, Davis would remain at super featherweight and likely challenge for a world title in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/ellerbe-gervonta-davis-staying-130-tabiti-back-early-2018--122940|title=Ellerbe: Gervonta Davis Staying at 130, Tabiti Back in Early 2018|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 24, 2018 Showtime announced that Davis would next appear on television on the undercard of [[Adrien Broner|Broner]] vs. [[Jessie Vargas|Vargas]] on April 21 at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/broner-figueroa-stevenson-jack-lara-hurd-set-showtime--124600|title=Broner-Figueroa, Stevenson-Jack, Lara-Hurd Set For Showtime|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-01-26|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day later,  Ellerbe stated a deal was close to being reached for Davis to fight Australian former world champion and IBF #3 [[Billy Dib]] (43-4, 24 KOs, 2 NC) in what would be an IBF eliminator. A purse bid, which was due to take place on January 25 was postponed to February 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/gervonta-davis-vs-billy-dib-close-deal-purse-bid-postponed--124628|title=Gervonta Davis vs. Billy Dib - Close To Deal, Purse Bid Postponed|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-01-26|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 21, it was reported by ESPN, the fight would not happen. Instead it was stated Davis's likely opponent would be former featherweight champion [[Jesús Cuellar]] (28-2, 21 KOs). On March 5, the fight was finalized for the vacant [[List of WBA world champions#Super featherweight|WBA 'Regular']] super featherweight title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/gervonta-davis-cuellar-my-toughest-opponent-date--125933|title=Gervonta Davis: Cuellar is My Toughest Opponent To Date|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the fight, Albert Machado, the 'Super' Champion at the same weight class, was inexplicably downgraded to "Regular' Champion, and the Davis-Cuellar fight was upgraded to be for Machado's [[list of WBA world champions#Super featherweight|WBA (Super) super featherweight title]].

In front of 13,964 in attendance, Davis knocked out Cuellar in round 3. Davis first knocked down Cuellar in round 2 courtesy of a left hook to the body and then put him down twice in round 3 to get the stoppage. Referee Benjy Esteves Jr. stopped the action at the 2:45 mark. Davis landed 49% of his power shots in the fight. Both boxers earned $350,000 apiece. After the fight, Davis stated he wanted to unify with the winner of [[Tevin Farmer]] vs. [[Billy Dib]], which would be contested for the IBF belt, the same belt Davis was stripped off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/23280163/charlo-ko-centeno-becomes-one-ggg-mandatory-challengers|title=Charlo KO's Centeno, becomes one of GGG's mandatory challengers|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/gervonta-davis-crushes-jesus-cuellar-three-results--127417|title=Gervonta Davis Crushes Jesus Cuellar in Three For WBA Title|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldboxingnews.net/2018/04/22/news/gervonta-davis-drops-jesus-cuellar-three-times-regains-130-pound-world-title|title=Gervonta Davis drops Jesus Cuellar three times, regains 130 pound world title|last=Cuellar|first=Davis v|work=WBN - World Boxing News|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bout opened Showtime’s broadcast and averaged 460,000 viewers and peaked at 527,000 viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/broner-vargas-telecast-peaked-891000-viewers-on-showtime--127498|title=Broner-Vargas Telecast Peaked at 891,000 Viewers on Showtime|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outside of boxing ==
On September 19, 2017 an arrest warrant was issued for Davis, who was being accused of [[Assault|first-degree aggravated assault]]. According to Maryland court records, the alleged incident took place on August 1, 2017 but did not indicate who was involved or what happened. An amount of $100,000 unsecured bond was posted for Davis' release. Davis was due to appear in court on October 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/gervonta-davis-facing-first-degree-aggravated-assault-charge--120740|title=Gervonta Davis Facing First Degree Aggravated Assault Charge - Boxing News|website=www.boxingscene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charge was later changed to misdemeanor second-degree assault, which carries a maximum potential sentence of 10 years or a fine of $2,500 or both. At the court, Anthony Wheeler, a childhood friend, complained that Davis punched him on the side of the head with a 'gloved fist'. He then stated he was diagnosed with a concussion in hospital. The incident took place at the Upton Boxing Center in West Baltimore. It was said that Davis would stand trial on November 29, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/gervonta-davis-stand-trial-on-assault-charge-on-november-29--121579|title=Gervonta Davis To Stand Trial on Assault Charge on November 29 - Boxing News|website=www.boxingscene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In court, the charges were dropped by Wheeler. The [[The Baltimore Sun|Baltimore Sun]] stated that Davis and Wheeler both embraced and walked out of the courtroom together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/gervonta-davis-all-smiles-final-assault-charge-dropped--122921|title=Gervonta Davis All Smiles as Final Assault Charge is Dropped|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 14, 2018 Davis was arrested in Washington D.C. According to a police report, he and another man started a fist fight. Punches were being landed around the upper body. It was said that some had tried to break up the fight and both men tried to flee before the police arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/gervonta-davis-arrested-over-street-fight--131808|title=Gervonta Davis Arrested Over Street Fight|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the morning of 1 October 2015, Persepolis team manager [[Mahmoud Khordbin]] announced that the club captain Hadi Norouzi died in his sleep from a heart attack due to [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]]. Resuscitation attempts on the way to the hospital failed. Norouzi was 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persianleague.com/the-news/1-latest-news/9796-persepolis-captain-hadi-norouzi-passes-away.html|title=PERSEPOLIS CAPTAIN HADI NOROUZI PASSES AWAY|work=persianleague.com|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persepolis manager [[Branko Ivanković]] describes the news as a big shock for him and his team. Persepolis players and legends like [[Ali Parvin]], [[Ahmad Reza Abedzadeh]], [[Karim Bagheri]] and former managers [[Afshin Ghotbi]] and [[Ali Daei]] paid tributes to Norouzi and his family in their messages. [[Iran Pro League]] clubs also paid tributes to Persepolis club and fans in [[Twitter]]. [[Iran national football team]] players observed a [[minute's silence]] for Norouzi at their training camp in United Arab Emirates. Many fans also immediately flocked to Persepolis' training ground, [[Derafshifar Stadium]] where he had participated in a training session in last day without any problem, to lay flowers and light candles.

A memorial was held at [[Azadi Stadium]] on 2 October which was attended by 20,000 mourners which rivals [[Esteghlal F.C.|Esteghlal]] fans also attended the ceremony. His body remained at the stadium for one day and then was transferred to [[Babol]]. His funeral was held on the following day and he was buried at his hometown, [[Kapur Chal, Mazandaran|Kapur Chal]] village at [[Babol]].

On 4 October 2015, former teammate [[Karim Ansarifard]] dedicated his goal in his team's 5–1 [[Greek Super League]] win to him, by raising a shirt with his name and number (#24, REST IN PEACE CAPTAIN). [[Iran national under-23 football team]] players also dedicated their win to Hadi Norouzi during their match against [[Bahrain national under-23 football team|Bahrain]] at [[2015 WAFF U-23 Championship]].

In Persepolis' first match after the death of Norouzi, fans cheered-up him in 24th minute. They also made a mosaique at the stadium which shows Norouzi's name and number, "Hadi 24". Persepolis and his native city's club [[Khoneh Be Khoneh Mazandaran F.C.|Khoneh Be Khoneh]] retired their number 24 shirt in his honour. A city square was also renamed to Hadi Norouzi square in his home town [[Babol]].

'''José Rosario Oviedo''' (October 5, 1885{{spaced ndash}}1927), better known as '''Malanga''', was a Cuban [[Cuban rumba|rumba]] dancer. He is considered one of the most famous [[Cuban rumba#Columbia|columbia]] dancers and his mysterious death has been the subject of numerous essays, poems and songs, most notably "Malanga murió", written by Faustino Drake and performed by [[Arsenio Rodríguez]] amongst others.

== Life and career ==

===Early life===
José Rosario Oviedo was born on October 5, 1885 in "La Esperanza", an [[Engenho|ingenio]] near the village of Alacranes in the [[Unión de Reyes]] municipality, [[Matanzas Province]], [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name="Roy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roy|first1=Maya|title=Músicas cubanas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ylUYYWXumY8C|date=2003|publisher=Akal|location=Tres Cantos, Spain|page=59|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecured"&gt;[http://www.ecured.cu/index.php/Jos%C3%A9_Rosario_Oviedo José Rosario Oviedo "Malanga"]. ''[[EcuRed]]'' (in Spanish). Retrieved June 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|In the past, some researchers believed he had been born in Sabanilla del Encomendador, a nearby village now known as Juan Gualberto Gómez. However, this has been shown to be false.&lt;ref name="Doc"&gt;Interview with Unión de Reyes historian Henry García. ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoDdBE1Z_3U Rumba cubana]''. Retrieved June 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;}} He was [[Infant baptism|baptisted]] on November 29 as the son of an "unknown father".&lt;ref name="Ecured" /&gt; His mother, Funciana Oviedo, was an ex-slave and raised him in the town of Unión de Reyes after living in several ingenios such as "Majagua" and "San Gonzalo".&lt;ref name="Ecured" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fire"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leymarie|first1=Isabel|title=Cuban Fire: Musiques populaires d'expression cubaine|date=1997|publisher=Outre Mesure|location=Paris, France|page=29|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; His godmother Saturnina Oviedo and his grandfather (also his godfather) José Quintero played an important role in his upbringing.&lt;ref name="Ecured" /&gt; Despite being christened in the [[Catholic]] faith, Malanga became a [[Santería]] practitioner; his [[orisha]] was [[Oshosi|Ochosí]].&lt;ref name="Doc" /&gt; He soon became a talented rumba dancer, performing with a group which featured Ángel Timbo, Ángel Calazán, Faustino Drake and Donato Torres.&lt;ref name="Ecured" /&gt; The percussionists played [[cajón|cajones]], wooden boxes that preceded the [[conga drum]].

===Style and professional career===
Malanga's style of dancing was unlike that of his contemporaries. He danced on his tiptoes, like [[ballet]] dancers, and often danced "on top of a dining room table with a glass of water on his head, making all the movements of the dance or picking up a handkerchief off the floor without spilling the water".&lt;ref&gt;Vázquez, Omar (2000). "Malanga, el timbero mayor". ''Salsa Cubana'' 4:11.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="sublette"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sublette|first1=Ned|title=Cuba and its Music: From the First Drums to the Mambo|date=2004|publisher=Chicago Review Press|location=Chicago, IL|pages=269–270|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fZZ4QKZEumIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to famous [[tres (instrument)|tres]] player [[Isaac Oviedo]], "he moved blindfolded with a glass of water on his head (...) without ever losing his step or the rhythm".&lt;ref name="sublette" /&gt;

Apart from being a dancer, Malanga worked as a representative for the [[Liberal Party of Cuba|Partido Liberal]] in Unión de Reyes, and as a [[sugar cane]] cutter, especially in the 1910s and 1920s, when work opportunities decreased in the region. During the ''[[Zafra (agriculture)|zafra]]'' season he had to migrate to the "sugar triangle" towns of [[Florida, Cuba|Florida]], [[Morón, Cuba|Morón]] and [[Ciego de Ávila]].&lt;ref name="Roy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecured" /&gt;

In the summer of 1927, when returning alone from Morón, Malanga died in unexplained circumstances.{{refn|group=nb|He is often incorrectly said to have died in 1923, a year cited from Helio Orovio's 1994 work ''Música por el Caribe''.&lt;ref name="Roy" /&gt;}} The most popular account of Malanga's death has been given by Crescencio Hernández "Chencho", according to whom Malanga was murdered with broken glass hidden in his food at a dance contest in Ceballos, near Morón.&lt;ref name="Ecured" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Doc" /&gt; However, this ''modus operandi'' has generally been debunked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mikkelson|first1=Barbara|title=Pain in the Glass|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/poison/glass.asp|website=Snopes|accessdate=June 23, 2015|date=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; No death certificate had been found,&lt;ref name="Ecured" /&gt; and the location of his grave remains unknown.&lt;ref name="montuno"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dalmace|first1=Patrick|title=Malanga|url=http://www.montunocubano.com/Tumbao/biographies/malanga.htm|website=Montuno Cubano|accessdate=June 23, 2015|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
Together with others such as Mulense, Chenche and Tanganica, Malanga is one of Cuba's "legendary ''rumberos''", being remembered as one of the most notable rumba dancers, especially in the columbia style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shepherd|first1=John|last2=Horn|first2=David|title=Bloomsbury Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World, Volume 9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=liV8AwAAQBAJ|date=2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|location=London, UK|page=719|chapter=Rumba}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, his life and especially his death have been the subject of many works, from essays to poems and songs. Cuban poet Fernando García González wrote a poem in 1985 dedicated to Malanga entitled "Canto al Rumbero Mayor".&lt;ref name="Ecured" /&gt;

Cajón de quinto drummer Faustino Drake, one of Malanga's dearest friends, composed the song "Malanga murió", also known as "A Malanga" in 1927 as an [[elegy]]. It is one of the most popular [[guaguancó]]s and its tone is remarkably solemn, as summarized by its well-known chorus: "Unión de Reyes llora / porque Malanga murió" (Unión de Reyes cries / because Malanga died). The song was originally sung by Roncona and later recorded by [[Arsenio Rodríguez]] as "[[Arsenio Rodríguez discography|Llora timbero]]" in 1941.&lt;ref name="Garcia"&gt;{{cite book|last1=García|first1=David|title=Arsenio Rodríguez and the Transnational Flows of Latin Popular Music|date=2006|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=147–166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4e5GF9NwHucC|chapter=Discography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marie-Louise Bruyère''', mostly known as '''Madame Bruyère''', or simply as '''Bruyère''' (pronounced Broo-yair),&lt;ref name=butterick&gt;{{cite book|title=Butterick dressmaking book|year=1940|publisher=Butterick Company|pages=90|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=twGUUJDEOceN0wXC-oGIBQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=hExEAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22Madame+Bruyere%22&amp;q=%22Madame+Bruyere%22#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a French fashion designer of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, operating out of [[Paris]], and importing her fashion lines abroad.

==Fashion career==
Before Bruyère opened her [[haute couture]] house in 1928, she learned her trade from [[Callot Soeurs]] and [[Jeanne Lanvin]].&lt;ref name=kyoto&gt;{{cite book|last=Fukai|first=Akiko|title=Fashion : the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute: a history from the 18th to the 20th century| year=2002 |publisher=Taschen |location=Köln [etc.] |isbn=3822812064 |pages=713}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her establishment was located on the [[Place Vendôme]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;''International Pattern'', [[Los Angeles Times]], December 30, 1954, pg. B4.&lt;/ref&gt; An early collection in 1930 established Bruyère as comparable to [[Elsa Schiaparelli|Schiaparelli]], [[Grès|Alix]], [[Rochas]] and [[Mainbocher]],&lt;ref name=butterick/&gt; with her coats and tailored suits proving a particular strength. Her suits were particularly noted for their subtle and unusual design elements.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; In August 1932 ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' noted that her designs were rather more successful with Americans than with the French, who did not visit Bruyère's shop on the Rue de Mondovi.&lt;ref name=fortune&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff writer |title=The Dressmakers of France |url=http://www.gbacg.org/costume-resources/original/articles/dressmakers.pdf |accessdate=19 November 2015 |work=Fortune |publisher=Time, Inc |date=August 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruyère's designs were imported to the United States,&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;''Fine Touches Make the Beauty of Newest Models Imported From Paris'', [[New York Times]], January 1, 1933, pg. X11.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1932, ''Fortune'' noted that a survey of copies of Paris couture gowns in the stores of [[Manhattan]] showed that Bruyère was the third most popular name, behind [[Madeleine Vionnet|Vionnet]] and Lanvin.&lt;ref name=fortune/&gt;

Bruyère continued to present collections during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation]], now taking into account the needs of Frenchwomen who needed practical clothing that could handle the bitter winters and harsh realities of life while occupied.&lt;ref&gt;''Fashion under the occupation'', Dominique Veillon, [[Berg Publishers]], 2002, pg. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war ended, Bruyère was not a supporter of the full-skirted New Look as popularised by [[Christian Dior]], instead offering extremely simple, slim-line dresses and suits with plunging necklines in 1951.&lt;ref name=toomey&gt;{{cite news |last1=Toomey |first1=Elizabeth |title=Parisian Styles Come To America With Fall Show. |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&amp;dat=19510808&amp;id=PPs-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TU0MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5826,2963504 |accessdate=12 December 2014 |work=The Tuscaloosa News |date=8 August 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, Bruyère began to focus on [[ready-to-wear]] clothing.&lt;ref name=vfg&gt;{{cite web |last=Bramlett |first=Lizzie |title=Vintage Fashion Guild: Label Reference: Bruyere |url=http://vintagefashionguild.org/label-resource/bruyere/ |accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She came to an agreement in 1951 with the Baron-Peters dress firm in the United States to reproduce her designs for the American medium-priced ready-to-wear market, carefully emphasising that the designs were pure replicas of her Paris collection, and not "whipped up for American tastes."&lt;ref name=toomey2&gt;{{cite news |last1=Toomey |first1=Elizabeth |title=Paris Springs Another Label in America|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1999943/el_paso_heraldpost/ |accessdate=16 March 2015 |work=El Paso Herald-Post |agency=United Press |date= 22 August 1951 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 it was noted that most of Bruyère's business came from American clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bergmann |first1=Shirley |title=What Goes on Behind the Doors of a Leading Fashion House |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1999812/freeport_journalstandard/ |accessdate=16 March 2015 |work=Freeport Journal-Standard |date=7 August 1952 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 Bruyère was noted alongside a number of other female Parisian fashion designers, her designs described as flowing and ladylike, and worn by many famous actresses and socialites.&lt;ref name=iris&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hartman |first1=Iris |title=Women Lead in Creation of Fashions |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=953&amp;dat=19580302&amp;id=QPZPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=X1UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5752,268536|accessdate=12 December 2014|work=St Petersburg Independent|date=2 March 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is thought to have ceased business during the 1950s.&lt;ref name=kyoto/&gt;&lt;ref name=vfg/&gt;

'''''Misty of Chincoteague''''' is a children's novel written by [[Marguerite Henry]], illustrated by [[Wesley Dennis (illustrator)|Wesley Dennis]], and published by Rand McNally in 1947. Set in the island town of [[Chincoteague, Virginia]], the book tells the story of the Beebe family and their efforts to raise a filly born to a wild horse. It was one of the runners-up for the annual [[Newbery Medal]], now called Newbery Honor Books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/newberymedal/newberyhonors/newberymedal.cfm|title=Newbery Medal and Honor Books, 1922-Present|first=|last=admin|date=30 November 1999|publisher=|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1961 film ''[[Misty (film)|Misty]]'' was based on the book.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055186/ ''Misty'' at the Internet Movie Database].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
''Misty of Chincoteague'' begins with an account of the wreck of a [[Spanish galleon]] on the shores of [[Assateague Island]] off the coast of Virginia. The ponies in the hold of the galleon swim to Assateague and become feral as the years and eventually the centuries pass.&lt;ref name=LCC1/&gt;

The book then tells the story of two orphan children, Paul and Maureen Beebe, who move in with their grandparents after their parents die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-12-28/features/1997362169_1_misty-of-chincoteague-pony-paul-and-maureen|title='Misty of Chincoteague' tale gallops on Horse: Marguerite Henry, who died recently, wrote 59 books, but her tale of two orphans and a horse remains a breed apart.|publisher=|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul and Maureen work to earn money to buy a Chincoteague pony [[mare]] named the Phantom, who has escaped the roundup men on Pony Penning Day for the past two years. Paul and Maureen save enough to buy Phantom, and Paul is able to capture her on the roundup because she is slowed down by her new foal, Misty. However, a man from the mainland buys the pair of ponies for his son before Paul and Maureen can give their money to the fire chief. Paul and Maureen are distressed, but they end up being able to buy Phantom and Misty because the original buyer's son won a colt in the yearly raffle and then decided he didn't need another pony, and chose the colt from the raffle.&lt;ref name=LCC1/&gt;

Paul and Maureen eventually break the Phantom to ride, and the next year Paul races her on Pony Penning Day. Phantom wins, but the next day becomes distressed when she sees the herd she once belonged to, led by a [[stallion]] called Pied Piper, being released to swim back to Assateague. Paul releases Phantom, and she gallops to join Pied Piper and the herd as they return to freedom on their ancestral island. Misty remains behind with Paul and Maureen.&lt;ref name=LCC1/&gt;

==Inspiration for novel==

''Misty'' was inspired by a real-life [[Chincoteague Pony]] by the same name. The real-life Misty was foaled in domesticity in 1946, on Chincoteague at the [[Beebe Ranch]], not in the wild on [[Assateague Island]] as told in the book. As in the book, however, she was in fact sired by a chestnut pinto [[stallion]] named Pied Piper, from a smokey-black pinto [[Mare|dam]] called Phantom. Although these horses also were domesticated in real life, they too provided inspiration to Henry for the [[feral horse|wild ponies]] portrayed in the novel.&lt;ref name=MistyHeaven2/&gt;

Misty was a chestnut and white [[pinto horse|pinto]], whose coloration and markings included a large patch of white on her side shaped much like the United States. Her hoof prints are impressed in the cement of the sidewalk outside the Roxy Movie Theatre in Chincoteague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chincoteaguechamber.com/i-roxy-theatre.html|title=Island Theatre - Chincoteague Chamber|publisher=|accessdate=21 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414101950/http://www.chincoteaguechamber.com/i-roxy-theatre.html|archivedate=14 April 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being purchased by Marguerite Henry as a [[weanling]] in November 1946, and spending her early life at Henry's [[Wayne, Illinois]] home, she was later moved back to the Beebe Ranch in Chincoteague in 1957.&lt;ref name=MistyHeaven2&gt;[http://www.mistysheaven.com/historyofmisty.html "History of Misty of Chincoteague", ''Misty's Heaven'' - Misty'sHeaven.com] Retrieved 2015-08-07&lt;/ref&gt; A goodbye party with over 300 children and 160 adults in attendance was held by Henry in Wayne for Misty when she left for Chincoteague.&lt;ref name=MistyHeaven2/&gt;

Back in Chincoteague, Misty had three foals: "Phantom Wings" in 1960, "Wisp O' Mist" in 1961, and "[[Stormy, Misty's Foal|Stormy]]", a chestnut pinto [[filly]] with a [[Horse markings|blaze]] in the shape of a crescent moon on her forehead, in 1962.&lt;ref name=MistyHeaven2/&gt; As of 2015, there were almost 200 known descendants of Misty.&lt;ref name=MistyHeaven1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mistysheaven.com|title=Misty's Heaven: Descendants of Misty of Chincoteague|accessdate=2015-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Beebe died in a car accident in 1957 at the age of 21. Clarence Beebe died two months later in 1957 after Paul's accident. Three years later Ida Beebe died in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.dailypress.com/1989-07-26/news/8907260145_1_grandma-beebe-misty-pony|title=Era Draws To Close At Home Of `Misty'|publisher=|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misty died in 1972. Her body, and that of her foal Stormy who died in 1993, have been preserved through [[taxidermy]], and can be seen at the [[Beebe Ranch]].&lt;ref name=MistyHeaven2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delmarvanow.com/dayinthelife/chincoteague/pages/chincoteaguestory7.html Chincoteague story]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadsideamerica.com/pet/misty.html Misty profile] at roadsideamerica.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The Misty of Chincoteague Foundation was formed by Marguerite Henry and Rebecca Guisti in 1990, with the two-fold mission of preserving Misty's legacy, and promoting reading by children. Funds were raised to commission a statue of Misty, sculpted by Brian Maughan, to be erected on Chincoteague, which was formally unveiled on July 29, 1997. An identical casting of the Maughan statue was also placed at [[Kentucky Horse Park]] in [[Lexington, KY|Lexington, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name=MistyHeaven2/&gt;

In the second novel, ''Sea Star'', published only two years after the original, Misty is "sold to be shared with children the country over" and the Beebe children rescue a "tiny orphaned colt" after the Pony Penning.&lt;ref name=kirkus2&gt;[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/marguerite-henry/mistys-twilight/ "Sea Star: Orphan of Chincoteague"] (starred review). ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''. No date. Retrieved 2015-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third novel, ''Stormy, Misty's Foal'', was published in 1963. It tells of the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962 on Chincoteague, and the birth of Misty's last foal Stormy. Misty and Stormy had made appearances at theaters and schools in the area to help raise funds for replenishment of the herds on Assateague in the aftermath of the 1962 storm.&lt;ref name=MistyHeaven2/&gt;

The fourth novel, ''Misty's Twilight'', was published after Henry's 90th birthday, and almost 30 years after the third. ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' observed that it was "billed as fiction but more like a fictionalization concerning one of Misty's descendants". It concluded its contemporary review, "this adult-centered narrative about an affluent doctor—whose troubles with her horse are always addressed by hiring yet another trainer—may be authentic, it will be of interest mostly to those who relish every crumb about Misty's family."&lt;ref name=kirkus4&gt;[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/marguerite-henry/mistys-twilight/ Misty's Twilight"].

==50th anniversary release==

For the 50th anniversary in 1997 of the original novel, only the month before Henry's death, Simon &amp; Schuster released a diary garnished with quotations from ''Misty of Chincoteague'' and new illustrations by Bill Farnsworth&lt;!--http://lccn.loc.gov/n93006057--&gt; (Little Simon, October 1997); {{ISBN|9780689817694}}.

==Misty's legacy in other literature==

Several of the real-life Misty's descendants have been featured in books by other authors, in addition to Henry:
* ''Windy of Chincoteague'' by Ronald Keiper (1987) — small non-fiction book about Misty's first granddaughter Windy.
* ''Pony Promise'' by Lois Szymanski (1996) — fiction, but based on the true story of Windy nursing her half-sister Misty II along with her own foal Cyclone, because of Stormy rejecting Misty II.
* ''Nightmist the Miracle Pony'' by Jessie-Ann Friend (2005) — children's book about Misty's great-grandson Nightmist. 
* ''The Forgotten Pony'' by Jessie Ann-Friend (2007) — children's book about Misty's great-grandson, Rainy's Boy. 

A series of children's books by Misty family pony-breeder Kendy Allen debuted in 2006. The series includes: 
* ''Misty's Heart of the Storm''
* ''Misty's Black Mist and the Christmas Parade''
* ''A Chincoteague Pony Named Misty III''
* ''Ember's Story, The Misty Miracle Pony''&lt;ref name=MistyHeaven2/&gt;

'''Axel Damián Blumberg''' (March 2, 1981 – March 22, 2004) was an [[Argentines|Argentine]] [[engineering]] student at the [[Instituto Tecnológico de Buenos Aires|Technological Institute of Buenos Aires]], who died at the age of 23,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/argentina/tough.htm|title=Get tough on crime, public demands|last=Cova|first=Tony de la|website=www.latinamericanstudies.org|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; after being [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] for several days in March 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01w7jzm|title=BBC World Service - Witness, The Kidnap and Murder of Axel Blumberg|website=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2004/04/07/the-tipping-point|title=The tipping point|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
He was returning from his girlfriend's home when he was intercepted by his kidnappers. Allegedly, local police were involved in the kidnapping or at least in the protection of the kidnappers. Neighbours of the kidnappers had called the police when they saw Blumberg escaping then being beaten by his captors; the police turned a blind eye. Argentina was at the time in the midst of a wave of extortive kidnappings, which often remained unsolved after badly conducted investigations. In three cases in that decade, the extortive kidnappings ended in murder: Juan Manuel Canillas, who was killed by his kidnappers in July 2002; Diego Peralta, in August of the same year; and the aforementioned Axel Blumberg, in March 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://misionesonline.net/paginas/principal.php?db=nacionales&amp;id=9716 ''Misiones Online''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311045852/http://misionesonline.net/paginas/principal.php?db=nacionales&amp;id=9716 |date=2007-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2004/04/02/g-735330.htm ''Clarín'']&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Aftermath==
A large portion of Argentine society have viewed the police forces as corrupt and inefficient, political leaders as unsupportive, and penal laws excessively lenient; in this context, Blumberg's murder caused an uproar and was the catalyst for massive demonstrations, protesting the perceived impunity and supporting Axel's father, [[Juan Carlos Blumberg]], in his search for justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.ca/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=https://www.lagaceta.com.ar/nota/72305/argentina/argentina-postblumberg.html&amp;prev=search|title=Google Translate|website=translate.google.ca|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barbara Ann Barnes''' was an [[Americans|American]] schoolgirl who was murdered in December 1995 at the age of thirteen. The case remains [[cold case|unsolved]] to this day. Many have speculated that her grandfather may have been responsible for her death, but others believe that the crime was committed by someone local to the area.&lt;ref name=who&gt;{{cite book|last=Swaint|first=Jack|title=Who killed--?

==Background==
Barnes was described as having been a soft-spoken girl who did well in school. She was in eighth grade and attended the nearby Harding Middle School. Because of the short distance between her home and her school, she walked to and from it every day, along with many other students.&lt;ref name=who/&gt; Her father had been shot to death in 1989, which had affected her to the point where her personality had changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goddard|first1=Alexandria|title=Who Killed Barbara?|url=http://prinniefied.com/wp/2012/05/13/who-killed-barbara/|accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance and murder==

It was reported by a classmate that Barnes was walking to [[school]] in her hometown of [[Steubenville, Ohio]] when she was [[kidnapping|abducted]] on December 7, 1995. After she failed to return home, an investigation began, including statewide searches.&lt;ref name=wells&gt;{{cite web|last=Connors|first=Fred|title=All Cases Summary|url=http://ovcoldcasessummary.blogspot.com/|accessdate=May 20, 2014|date=June 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 22, 1996, her remains were discovered by [[quantity surveyor|surveyors]] in a riverbed and the cause of death was determined by examiners to have been by [[strangulation]] and she had also been raped.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Swaint|first1=Jack|title=Unsolved Murders In The Mountain State|url=http://westvirginianews.blogspot.com/2009/09/unsolved-murder-in-mountain-state.html|website=westvirginianews.blogspot.com|accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==

Although her body was discovered on the property of her uncle, Louis Boyce, he was not charged with her murder. Boyce has remained under suspicion due to the fact that he reportedly did not pass a [[polygraph]] test regarding the murder of Barbara. He is also believed by Barnes' family as well as members of the city to have been partially responsible for the murder of Barbara's father, although one man is currently serving life in prison for his death.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

A friend of Boyce expressed that it was unlikely that her grandfather had anything to do with the murder, stating that it was not likely for him to have harmed any of his grandchildren. Other leads include a Florida man convicted of abducting children who had been present in Steubenville when Barbara Barnes was abducted, although some members of the police department are skeptical, supporting the theory that she may have been murdered by someone native to the area.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;&lt;ref name=wells/&gt;

'''Destiny Anne Norton''' (November 30, 2000 &amp;ndash;  July 16, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foundagrave.com/grave/destiny-norton/|title=Destiny Norton - Found a Grave|work=Found a Grave|access-date=August 25, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a victim of [[kidnap]]ping and [[murder]].

==Murder==
Until her death, she lived in [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]]. On July 16, 2006, she disappeared from her home. Her body was found fewer than 100 feet from her home in the basement of her neighbor, 20-year-old Craig Roger Gregerson.

She was last seen as she left her home after arguing with her parents about going to bed. She lived in a small ranch house with her parents, and about ten other couples and friends who shared the house for economic reasons.

Volunteers posted missing posters throughout Salt Lake City, describing her several silver capped teeth on the bottom row of her mouth, blonde hair and green eyes, and dressed in a grey shirt with black stripes.

==Investigation==
After a massive eight-day search by about 5,000 community volunteers, FBI and police, Destiny's body was found on July 24, 2006, less than 100 feet from her home in the basement of her neighbor, 20-year-old Craig Roger Gregerson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=380101|title=Destiny Norton Found Dead, Suspect Arrested|date=July 25, 2006|publisher=KSL.com|accessdate=August 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family and friends were initially outraged after the search ended, and accused authorities of mishandling the investigation. An apology on behalf of the family and friends was later issued in a press conference.

==Aftermath==
Gregerson was formally charged on July 27, 2006 with kidnapping and aggravated murder. He waived his rights to a [[speedy trial]], and later waived his rights to a preliminary hearing which had originally been scheduled for October 3 and 4, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kutv.com/local/local_story_219121551.html |title= October Preliminary Hearing Set For Gregerson|publisher=kutv.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312104342/http://kutv.com/local/local_story_219121551.html|archivedate=March 12, 2007|date=August 7, 2006|accessdate=August 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a plea bargain to avoid the death penalty, he pleaded guilty to capital murder and child kidnapping on December 4, and was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the murder, and fifteen years to life for the kidnapping. The sentences will be served consecutively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/650212485/Gregerson-pleads-guilty-gets-life-for-killing-Destiny.html|title=Gregerson pleads guilty, gets life for killing Destiny|date=December 5, 2006|publisher=Desert News|author=Ben Winslow |accessdate=August 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Destiny Search Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://destinysearchproject.org/ |title= Destiny Search Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; was formed in memory of Destiny Norton. The group is organized to assist with volunteer operations in missing persons cases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7921">The '''Julie Jensen case''' involves the trial of a [[Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin|Pleasant Prairie]], [[Wisconsin]] man, Mark Jensen, on charges that he [[murder]]ed his wife, Julie Jensen on December 3, 1998. The case is notable for the eventual admission into [[evidence]] of a letter written by the deceased prior to her death, expressing suspicion of her husband's intentions.

Julie Jensen investigated her husband, checking his planner, photographing a note and documenting her suspicions.&lt;ref name="cnn220208"&gt;{{cite news | last = Simon | first = Mallory | title = Jury: Letter from grave was 'road map' to murderer | work = CNN.com/crime | publisher = CNN | date = 25 February 2008 | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/02/22/jensen.jurors/index.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; She gave the letter to a neighbor with instructions to hand it to police if anything should happen to her. She wrote that she would never commit [[suicide]] and that if she died, police should consider her husband a suspect. "I pray that I am wrong and nothing happens, but I am suspicious of Mark's suspicious behaviors and fear for my early demise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Antlfinger | first = Carrie | title = Wis. jury hears dead wife's letter | work = USA Today | agency= Associated Press | date = 7 January 2008| url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-01-07-1500659240_x.htm | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Mark Jensen was convicted of [[first degree murder]] and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] without the possibility of [[parole]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Neill|first1=Anne|title=Husband guilty of murder in 'letter from grave' case|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/02/21/jensen.verdict/|website=cnn.com|publisher=CNN|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a verdict which was later overturned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bohr|first1=Nick|title=Man accused of poisoning wife with antifreeze wins appeal|url=http://www.wisn.com/article/man-accused-of-poisoning-wife-with-antifreeze-wins-appeal/6328483|website=wisn.com|publisher=ABC 12 WISN|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Julie Griffin was working at a [[Sears]] department store in [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin|Oshkosh]] when she met Mark Jensen in 1981. Both were students at a local college; Mark graduated but Julie did not. The couple moved to the [[Carol Beach, Wisconsin|Carol Beach]] neighborhood of [[Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin]] and had two children, David and Douglas, aged 8 and 3 at the time of Julie's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Timeline |url=http://www.oursisterjulie.com/Julie/Timeline.html |accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=May 2017}} Julie was described as having a complicated family life (her mother was an alcoholic and her younger brother died in an accident as a toddler), but was a devoted mother to her children.{{cn|date=May 2017}} At the time of her death, Julie worked a part-time job for the Port Authority in [[Chicago]], while Mark Jensen was employed at a construction firm.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

==Trial==
Special [[Prosecutor]] Robert Jambois contended that Mark Jensen poisoned his wife Julie, then 40, with [[ethylene glycol]] ([[antifreeze]]) and then suffocated her inside the garage of their home in [[Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin|Pleasant Prairie]] on December 3, 1998. The trial was moved from [[Kenosha County, Wisconsin|Kenosha County]] to [[Walworth County, Wisconsin|Walworth County]] in response to pre-trial publicity. [[Defense (legal)|Defense]] counsel Craig Albee argued that Julie Jensen was a depressed woman who killed herself and framed her husband. Moreover, the deceased had seen a therapist at least three times for [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and was aware of her husband's extramarital affair with a co-worker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Julie Jensen's Letter Points Finger at Mark | work = 620 WTMJ Newsradio | publisher = WTMJ | year = 2008 | url = http://www.620wtmj.com/news/local/45320097.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly LaBonte Grieman whom Mark Jensen later married, and who assumed custody of the Jensens' two sons after Mark's eventual imprisonment. Evidence was introduced showing that Mark Jensen had discussed poisoning his wife with co-workers and a jailhouse associate, as well as searching on the [[internet]] for information relating to spousal murder and poisoning techniques. The prosecution contended further that Jensen remained angry over his wife's brief affair in 1991 with co-worker Perry Tarica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = At Jensen trial, the other man takes the stand | work = CNN | date = 25 January 2008 | url = http://insession.blogs.cnn.com/2008/01/25/at-jensen-trial-the-other-man-takes-the-stand/  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter's use by the prosecutors was controversial, because such evidence has been blocked from court for years by strict [[hearsay]] rules based on criminal defendants' right, under the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]] to confront their accusers. But the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]], guided by a [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling ([[Crawford v Washington]] 541 U.S. 36 (2004)), created a hearsay exception that permitted the use of Julie Jensen's letter and statements as a [[dying declaration]] — that is, evidence of her state of mind at the time of her death.
 
The letter was the critical factor in the trial that ended on February 22, 2008. The jury found Jensen, 48, guilty of his wife's murder after more than 30 hours of deliberations. He was sentenced by Kenosha County Circuit Court Judge Bruce Schroeder on February 27, 2008 to life in prison with no chance of [[parole]].&lt;ref name="cnn220208" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn270208"&gt;{{cite news | title = Husband gets life without parole in 'letter from the grave' case | work = CNN.com/crime | publisher = CNN | date = 27 February 2008 | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/02/27/jensen.sentence/index.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appellate proceedings ==
On December 19, 2013, a federal judge overturned Jensen's conviction, and ordered he be released from prison within 90 days. The court agreed with Jensen's argument that the state's use of his dead wife's words violated his Constitutional right to confront witnesses testifying against him. The state of Wisconsin appealed the case, but in 2015 the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] upheld the district court's decision on September 8, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2015/D09-08/C:14-1380:J:Tinder:dis:T:fnOp:N:1617867:S:0&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutors decided to retry Jensen for the murder of his wife in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://fox6now.com/2016/01/06/wisconsin-man-convicted-in-wifes-death-could-go-free-after-bail-hearing Judge sets bail at $1.2M for Mark Jensen as he awaits retrial in 1998 death of his wife]".

[[File:American bullfrog 1.jpg|thumb|A [[American bullfrog|bullfrog]] (''Rana catesbeiana''), the species which travelled on the OFO-A flight]]
[[Image:Scout launch vehicle.jpg|thumb|A [[Scout (rocket)|Scout B rocket]], like this one, launched the OFO.]]

The '''Orbiting Frog Otolith''' (OFO) was a [[NASA]] space program which sent two bullfrogs into orbit on 9 November 1970 for the study of [[weightlessness]]. The name, derived through common use, was a functional description of the biological experiment carried by the satellite. ''[[Otolith]]'' referred to the frog's [[inner ear]] balance mechanism.

The Orbiting Frog Otolith Program was a part of the research program of NASA's Office of Advanced Research and Technology (OART). One of the goals of the OART was to study the [[vestibular system]] function in space and on Earth. The experiment was designed to study the adaptability of the [[otolith]] to sustained [[weightlessness]], to provide information for crewed space flight. The otolith is a structure in the [[inner ear]] that is associated with equilibrium control: acceleration with respect to gravity as its primary sensory input.

The Frog Otolith Experiment (FOE) was developed by Torquato Gualtierotti of the [[University of Milan]], [[Italy]], when he was assigned to the [[Ames Research Center]] as a resident Research Associate sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SP-4402 Origins of NASA Names |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4402/ch2.htm#62 |website=NASA History |accessdate=29 November 2018 |ref=sp4402}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally planned in 1966 to be included on an early [[Apollo mission]], the experiment was deferred when that mission was canceled. In late 1967 authorization was given to orbit the FOE when a supporting spacecraft could be designed. The project, part of NASA's Human Factor Systems program, was officially designated "OFO" in 1968. After a series of delays, OFO was launched into orbit on 9 November 1970.

After the successful OFO-A mission in 1970, interest in the research continued. A project called Vestibular Function Research was initiated in 1975 to fly a [[vestibular system|vestibular]] experiment in an Earth-orbiting spacecraft. This flight project was eventually discontinued, but a number of ground studies were conducted. The research has given rise to several very useful offshoots, including the ground-based Vestibular Research Facility located at [[NASA Ames Research Center|ARC]].&lt;ref name="4cOFO"&gt;{{cite web |title=Orbiting Frog Otolith Program |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929213211/http://lis.arc.nasa.gov/lis/Programs/OFO/OFO_overview/OFO.html |website=[[Ames Research Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OFO should not to be confused with similar acronyms describing the [[Orbiting Observatory]] series of spacecraft, such as [[Orbiting Geophysical Observatory]] (OGO), [[Orbiting Solar Observatory]] (OSO), and [[Orbiting Astronomical Observatory]] (OAO).

==The OFO spacecraft==
[[Image:Orbiting Frog Otolith 1.png|thumb|left|Launch of the Orbiting Frog Otolith (OFO) capsule]]
[[Image:Scout B.png|thumb|left|Diagram of Scout B launch vehicle]]
The OFO experiment was originally designed for flight within the [[Apollo Applications Program]], which was established to make optimum use of hardware used in [[Apollo lunar missions]]. However, because the low acceleration levels needed for the experiment could not easily be maintained in a manned Apollo spacecraft, an unmanned satellite was later chosen as a more suitable vehicle. The satellite's design eliminated exposures to acceleration levels above 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;''g'' (10&amp;nbsp;mm/s²). This meant that the experimental specimens could experience an almost weightless state.

The spacecraft had a diameter of approximately 30 in (760&amp;nbsp;mm) and a length of 47 in (1,190&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref name="4cOFO" /&gt; The octagonal lower section of the spacecraft housed the electronic apparatus. The upper section, which contained the experiment package, was shaped like a truncated cone. A [[heat shield]] covering this upper section protected the experiment during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. A [[yo-yo de-spin]] assembly was located around the girth of the spacecraft. Four booms, folded against the side of the spacecraft, were located radially around the satellite. After the spacecraft separated from the launch vehicle, the yo-yo despin subsystem slowed spacecraft rotation. The four booms were then released to extend from the side of the spacecraft. The extension of the booms increased the [[moment of inertia]] of the spacecraft, permitting the acceleration level to remain below 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;g.&lt;ref name="4cOFO" /&gt;

The OFO-A mission was launched on November 9, 1970 (06:00 GMT) from [[Wallops Island]] launch site. The satellite carrying the OFO-A experiment remained in orbit for almost seven days. Recovery of the spacecraft was not planned. The payload was the [[#Frog_Otolith_Experiment_Package_.28FOEP.29|Frog Otolith Experiment Package]] (FOEP).

The objective of the experiment was to investigate the effect of microgravity on the otolith, a sensory organ that responds to changes in an animal's orientation within the Earth's gravitational field.

Two [[American bullfrog]]s (''Rana catesbeiana'') were used as experimental subjects in the flight experiment. The bullfrog was chosen for study because its [[Labyrinth (inner ear)|inner ear labyrinth]] is very similar to that of humans. Since it is an amphibian, preflight surgery could be performed above water, but it could be kept in water during the flight. The water medium served to cushion the vibration and acceleration of launch, and to facilitate gas exchange with the organisms.

Both flight frogs had [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) electrodes implanted in their [[thoracic cavity|thoracic cavities]] and microelectrodes implanted in their [[vestibular nerve]]s. The frogs were demotorized by cutting their limb nerves to prevent them from dislodging their implanted electrodes, and to reduce their metabolic rates.&lt;ref name="ofo_a"&gt;{{cite web |title=Orbiting Frog Otolith-A |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929212029/http://lis.arc.nasa.gov/lis/Programs/OFO/OFO_A/OFO_A.html |website=[[Ames Research Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this lowered metabolic activity, the frogs could survive in good health without being fed for as long as one month. Immersion in water allowed the frogs to breathe through their skin. The water medium also helped to move [[carbon dioxide]] and heat away from the animals.

===Hardware===
The flight hardware unit, the [[#Frog_Otolith_Experiment_Package_.28FOEP.29|FOEP]], was a pressure-tight canister containing a water-filled [[centrifuge]] that housed the two frogs. The centrifuge was a cylindrical structure that rotated the frogs' heads at scheduled intervals.&lt;ref name="ofo_a" /&gt; The FOEP also contained a life support system which could maintain a regulated environment for the frogs. This system consisted of two closed loops, one containing liquid and the other containing gas. The interface between the two loops was a selectively permeable [[silicone rubber]] that acted as an artificial lung. Oxygen passed through the membrane from the gas to the liquid side, and carbon dioxide from the liquid to the gas side. The frogs were immersed in the liquid loop. A pump circulated oxygen through the gas-containing loop. Carbon dioxide entering the gas loop was removed by an absorbent and the purified oxygen returned to the pump for recirculation. A water evaporator and an electric heater maintained the water temperature at about 60 °F (15 °C). An amplifier system in the FOEP increased voltage output from the microelectrodes implanted in the animals to the level required by the telemetry apparatus.

===Operations===
[[Image:FOEP FrogDecombined.png|thumb|A drawing of how a bullfrog fitted with electrodes was to sit inside the centrifuge of the Frog Otolith Experiment Package]]
Surgical preparation of the flight frogs was completed about 12 hours before launch, and the animals were sealed inside the FOEP. A backup FOEP was also prepared with similar specimens. The flight FOEP was installed in the satellite about three hours before launch.

The centrifuge was activated as soon as possible once the satellite was in orbit and stabilized at 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;''g'' (10&amp;nbsp;mm/s²). The centrifuge applied gravity stimuli in cycles. Each cycle lasted about 8 minutes, and consisted of the following: a 1-minute period without acceleration, an 8-second period when rotation slowly began, 14 seconds of constant 0.6 ''g'' (6&amp;nbsp;m/s²), an 8-second period when rotation slowly stopped, and a 6-minute period when aftereffects of rotation could be measured.&lt;ref name="ofo_a" /&gt; Cycles were performed every 30 minutes during the initial 3 hours in orbit, and less frequently during the rest of the flight.

The OFO experiment continued until the seventh day in orbit, at which time the onboard battery failed. Recovery of the OFO spacecraft and FOEP hardware were not required.

===Results===
The experiment was successful. [[Electrocardiography]] (ECG) indices showed the flight frogs to be in good health during the entire flight. [[Vestibular system|Vestibular]] recordings were made as expected. Two equipment malfunctions occurred during the flight: pressure in the canister increased to {{convert|11|psi|kPa}}, and the temperature decreased to {{convert|55|°F|°C}} for nine hours. However, control experiments performed on the ground showed that these malfunctions had little effect on the outcome of the flight experiment.

Several vestibular response changes were noted during the early period in weightlessness. All of the observed changes reverted to normal during the last 10 to 20 hours of the flight, suggesting [[acclimatization]].&lt;ref name="ofo_a" /&gt;

==Frog Otolith Experiment Package (FOEP)==
[[Image:Orbiting Frog Otolith 2.png|thumb|left|Orbiting Frog Otolith (OFO) with booms. Booms out increased the moment of inertia.]]
[[Image:FOEP FrogCombined L.png|thumb|Frog Otolith Experiment Package]]
The Frog Otolith Experiment Package (FOEP) contains all apparatus necessary to assure survival of two frogs. Specimens are housed in a water-filled, self-contained centrifuge which supplies the test acceleration during orbit. Frogs are demotorized to prevent dislodging of implanted electrodes and to reduce their metabolic rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frog Otolith Experiment Package (FOEP) |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929221449/http://lis.arc.nasa.gov/lis/Hardware_App/foep.html |website=[[Ames Research Center]] |ref=foep}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life Support System (LSS): The LSS maintains a regulated environment within the FOEP to assure the survival and normal functioning of two demotorized frogs. The lower bulkhead of the inner assembly structure provides mounting space for all life support equipment.

The package's dimensions were 18 in (457&amp;nbsp;mm) diameter × 18 in length, weighed 91&amp;nbsp;lb (41&amp;nbsp;kg) when loaded. Data acquisition consisted of ECG, body temperature, and vestibular activity. There was also a ground-based FOEP test unit which the FOEP could be connected preflight for ventilation and verification of environmental conditions prior to loading in the spacecraft.

===Canister===
The outer housing of the FOEP is a pressure-tight canister 18&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; inches (458.8&amp;nbsp;mm) in diameter and 18½ inches (470&amp;nbsp;mm) long. The bottom closure and removable top lid are both slightly domed to prevent implosion should pressure reversals be encountered. The inner assembly structure is fastened to a support ring approximately 6 inches from the bottom of the canister and consists of upper and lower bulkheads joined by a cylinder. Cutouts in the cylinder permit access to the centrifuge, which houses the frogs. Near the top of the canister are two electrical feed-through receptacles for the power supply and data line.

===Centrifuge===
The centrifuge is a hollow cylinder 6 inches in diameter and 13.5 inches long with both end caps in place. The cylinder is mounted perpendicular to the canister and supported by ball bearings housed in the upper and lower bulkheads. The rotational axis of the centrifuge is formed by shafts centrally located in the vertical plane at right angles to the cylinder, held in place by the ball bearings. Thin, shallow-domed end caps are bolted to each end of the centrifuge with intervening rubber gaskets to prevent leakage. In the center of each cap is a fitting which allows frog specimens to be fully instrumented and mounted directly to the end caps before insertion into the centrifuge, and immersion. The water serves as a cushion for the high accelerations and vibrations of launch and as a medium for gas exchange via the frogs' skin. The centrifuge is locked in position and not released until after the spacecraft orbit is fully stabilized. The motor which drives the centrifuge is mounted to the upper bulkhead. Signal amplifiers and an accelerometer are mounted on the centrifuge.

===Neutral-buoyancy electrode===
The micro-electrode consists of a probe of tungsten wire 50 [[µm]] in diameter, sharpened electrically to a point less than 1&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter and completely insulated to the tip. A bubble of air trapped in the polyethylene tubing which contains the probe adds buoyancy and makes the electrode the same density as the nerve in which it is implanted, thereby allowing the two to move together. A section of paraffin is used to connect the electrode to a handle which is used only during the implantation process, then removed. Nerve impulses detected by the microelectrodes are fed into a preamplifier directly attached to the frog's jaw, and passed on to a post-data amplifier for spacecraft telemetry.

==Life support system (LSS)==
[[Image:FEOP LSS L.png|thumb|Life Support System (LSS)]]
The life support system (LSS) of the Frog Otolith Experiment Package (FOEP) maintains a regulated environment within the FOEP to assure the survival and normal functioning of the experimental specimens. The LSS is designed to meet the physiological requirements of two demotorized frogs weighing 350 g (12&amp;nbsp;oz) each. Frogs are demotorized by cutting the limb nerves, which reduces their metabolic rate. In this condition, the frogs require no artificial respiration and can remain healthy without being fed, for as long as a month. After being installed in the centrifuge the frogs are completely immersed in water, which serves as the medium for exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide and heat through the frog's skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Life Support System (LSS) |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321042233/http://lis.arc.nasa.gov/lis/Hardware_App/foep_lss.html |website=[[Ames Research Center]] |ref=foeplss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LSS primarily consists of two closed loops: one containing liquid and the other containing gas. The lower bulkhead of the inner assembly structure provides mounting space for all LSS equipment. The oxygen supply system operates through these loops and includes a 4.5&amp;nbsp;cm³ capacity oxygen bottle, a pressure reducer and regulator, an artificial lung, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorber, and water supply. Limited control over the temperature of the frogs' environment is available by means of a water evaporator/heater.

===Artificial lung===
The interface between loops occurs at a selectively permeable membrane of silicon rubber which separates the liquid and gas. This membrane, called the lung, passes oxygen from the gas loop to the liquid loop, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the liquid loop to the gas loop.

===Liquid loop===
The frogs, housed in the centrifuge, are in the liquid loop. Moving from the lung to the frogs, the loop contains water and dissolved oxygen; moving from the frogs back to the lung, it contains water and free CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A double layer of polyurethane foam lining the interior of the centrifuge prevents frog waste matter from fouling the water circulation system. Water is circulated through the liquid loop using a small pump and must pass through the filter before leaving the centrifuge.

===Gas loop===
The gas loop consists of a circuit in the lower bulkhead through which oxygen is circulated by a small pump. The pump delivers pure oxygen to the lung where some of it passes into the liquid loop, while the remainder becomes mixed with the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coming from the liquid loop. From the lung, the oxygen-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixture is passed through a bed of Baralyme which absorbs the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Pure oxygen is returned from the Baralyme to the pump and recirculated. The oxygen supply is replenished by gas from the small oxygen tank.

===Evaporator/heater===
Augmented by the thermal environment of the spacecraft, the water evaporator and 8 Watt electric heater will maintain water temperature at 60±5 °F (15.5±3 °C). The water supply for the evaporator is contained in a rubber bladder supported by a ring in the canister immediately above the lower dome. When water temperature exceeds the nominal 60 °F, a ground command actuates a timing circuit operating a valve. As a result of the ambient pressure inside the canister, water is forced from the bladder through the valve and into the evaporator. Internal heat loads are transferred through a heat exchanger to the evaporator and are dissipated in evaporating the water.

'''The Orderud case''' ({{lang-no|Orderud-saken}}) was a notorious case of [[murder|triple murder]] that occurred in Norway on 22 May 1999. The victims were 47-year-old '''Anne Orderud Paust''', her mother 84-year-old '''Marie Orderud''' and her father 81-year-old '''Kristian Orderud''' who were found shot and killed at their country estate in [[Sørum]], [[Akershus]].

Eventually Anne's brother '''Per Kristian Orderud''', his wife '''Veronica Orderud''', Veronica's sister '''Kristin Kirkemo''' and Kristin's ex-boyfriend '''Lars Grønnerød'''  were arrested and were convicted of complicity to premeditated murder in 2001. The mysterious triple murder case is the criminal case that has probably generated the most media attention in Norwegian history. Despite four people being convicted, the actual killer has never been caught.&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite web|title=Orderud saken|url=http://snl.no/Orderud-saken|work=Kriminalitet|publisher=Store Norske Leksikon|accessdate=30 December 2012|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
On 17 July 1998, while heading to work at the Ministry of Defence, the [[Minister of Defence (Norway)|Norwegian defense minister's]] personal secretary, Anne Orderud Paust discovered a charge of explosives under her truck. The 500g explosive device was of the type [[Solex]]. The incident was given "extremely high priority" with the Oslo police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Feil på eksosanlegget" var dynamitt|url=http://tux1.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/d48836.htm|accessdate=29 December 2012|newspaper=Aftenposten|date=12 August 1998|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 12. August her husband Per Paust, a high level [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] official, stated that there had been an attempt to ignite a propane gas tank at the stairwell of their apartment in [[Skillebekk]], [[Oslo]]. He discovered the 5-kilo tank with an open vent, outside his door which was doused in gasoline. Officials from the fire department claimed that the whole building could easily have been "blown apart".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Arnseth|first=Andreas|title=Ingen siktet i Paust-saken|url=http://tux1.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/d63605.htm|accessdate=30 December 2012|newspaper=Aftenposten.no|date=30 December 1998|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These two assassination attempts received wide publicity and caused a media sensation. In the end no one was charged or arrested in connection with either of the two incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paust fornøyd|url=http://tux1.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/d63587.htm|accessdate=30 December 2012|newspaper=Aftenposten.no|date=30 December 1998|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple then spent a few months in [[New York City]] where Per worked as a temporary Consul-General, returning to Norway in January 1999. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dette er Orderud-saken|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/trippeldrapet/saken.html|accessdate=30 December 2012|newspaper=Dagbladet.no|date=16 April 2001|language=Norwegian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110214736/http://www.dagbladet.no/trippeldrapet/saken.html|archivedate=10 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 15 May, an anonymous person called and warned the authorities that Anne Paust and her parents would be murdered. Despite extensive searches, the caller was never found, and one week later the same people were found dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jensen|first=Sveinung|title=Resultatløs jakt på 180-mannen|url=http://tux1.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/d102243.htm|accessdate=30 December 2012|newspaper=Aftenposten.no|date=30 September 1999|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders==
On the night of 22 May, Anne Orderud Paust and her parents, Marie (b. 1915) and Kristian Orderud (b. 1918), were shot and killed in the parents' home, on the Olerud Estate in Sørum, Akershus.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; Hiding in the adjacent woods until the cover of nightfall, the assailant entered the house sometime between midnight and 5am by climbing on to the second floor porch and breaking the window on the [[Verandah|veranda door]].

Probably awoken by the noise, 84-year old Marie Orderud confronted the intruder as he was entering the house and was shot at close range and killed instantly. Meanwhile, their daughter 47-year old Anne, also entered the room and was likewise shot and killed in the same manner, both women were found in their nightgowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=VG|title=-Skutt i nattøyet|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=3731476|accessdate=30 December 2012|newspaper=Vg.no|date=25 September 1999|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assailant then went to the couples bedroom where 80-year-old Kristian Orderud was lying. He was impaired by his old age and was unable to escape or otherwise offer any resistance to the gunman. He was executed from [[point-blank range]]. The gunman then proceeded to escape through the same back-door from which he had entered, the only visible trace being the broken door-window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=VG|title=Likvidert etter tur|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=7407273|accessdate=30 December 2012|newspaper=vg.no|date=25 September 1999|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next morning, Kristian's brother Hans came to visit, and upon seeing the broken door went in for a closer look. He then discovered the bodies of his family members and contacted the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jensen|first=Sveinung|title=Politijakt på trippelmorder|url=http://tux1.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/d82661.htm|accessdate=30 December 2012|newspaper=Aftenposten.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The killings happened just weeks after Anne Orderud Paust had voluntarily declined to be assigned close protection officers from the [[Norwegian Police Security Service|Police Security Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Norsk|first=Telegrambyrå|title=Politibeskyttelsen opphevet kort tid før drapet|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=9999615|accessdate=30 December 2012|newspaper=Vg.no|date=25 September 1999|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
Early in the investigation, the police felt confident that the assailant or assailants were familiar with the victims and that the victims probably knew their killer. The investigators theorized that the time of the killings had not been coincidental. Based on the fact that only a handful of people knew that Anne would be visiting on that precise time, the investigators concluded that the killer had the house under careful surveillance, and acting when seeing her car parked outside. The main theory is that Anne Orderud Paust was the main target of the killer or killers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spanet på boligen|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=548168|accessdate=30 December 2012|newspaper=Vg.no|date=11 July 1999|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The gunman had to have known the number of occupants in the house at the time.
* The perpetrator also had to know that the daughter Anne was visiting. The blue car which Anne utilized was visibly parked at the front yard.
* Furthermore, the perpetrator must have had knowledge on where to enter the house unnoticed and with ease. The porch in the back lies relatively out of sight.
* The perpetrator must have known exactly where in the house the occupants resided. The bedroom where Kristian Orderud was killed is some distance away from the living room where the two others were found.

The police further speculated that the victims did not initially realize the danger they were facing, the location of the bodies in the estate's second floor indicated that they did not consider escaping when they faced their intruder, and in spite of the unexpected and dramatic break-in nobody made any effort to alert the police or others. One explanation may be that the victims initially did not feel the intruder to be threatening or did not see it necessary to contact the police. The fact that Kristian Orderud was killed while lying in his bed, indicated that the perpetrator was not a random predator without intimate knowledge of the family, but rather knew exactly who his victims were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vg|title=- Kjente morderen|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=2221478|accessdate=30 December 2012|newspaper=Vg.no|date=27 September 1999|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was backed up by the fact that nothing was missing from the house, ruling out a robbery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ingenting stjålet på Orderud|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=9999731|accessdate=30 December 2012|newspaper=Vg.no|date=28 May 1999|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, four people were charged with premeditated murder or complicity in to premeditated murder: Anne Orderud Paust's brother Per Kristian Orderud (b. 1954), his wife Veronica Orderud (b. 1972), Veronica Orderud's half sister Kristin Kirkemo (later Kristin Kirkemo Haukeland (b. 1973)) and her former partner Lars Grønnerød (b. 1958). The motive for the killings were according to the prosecution a conflict of ownership of the Orderud estate and farm. Marie and Kristian Orderud were registered as the owners of the farm even though their son for years had operated it and wanted to take it over. Prosecutors believed that all four were involved in the murder, but neither the investigation nor the subsequent trials gave answers to who actually carried out the brutal killings.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

==Verdict==
On 22 June 2001, both Per and Veronica Orderud, along with Kristin Kirkemo was found guilty on all charges and each received sentences of 21 years in prison. Lars Grønnerød was found guilty of illegal weapons charges and sentenced to two and a half years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=VG NETT|title=Gråt for 21 års fengsel|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=3886497|accessdate=30 December 2012|newspaper=Vg.no|date=22 June 2001|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The murder of Anne Orderud Paust and her parents received media attention like that of no other criminal case in the country's history, with almost daily coverage in the month after the killings, and very intimate account of the accused individuals under the full name. The media coverage led to debate about the media's handling of the case and the police and the defenders' leaks to the media.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

==Balkan theory==
According to [[NRK]] ''[[Brennpunkt]]'', reliable sources independently tie both Per Paust and Anne Orderud Paust to Norwegian intelligence services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first1=Frode|last1=Nielsen|first2=Ebbe|last2=Ording|title=EOS-utvalget fikk ikke innsyn|url=http://www.nrk.no/dokumentar/kontrollutvalget-fikk-ikke-innsyn-1.6581238|publisher=NRK|date=22 September 2009|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per Paust's death fourteen days before the Orderud murders, reportedly from cancer after short-term sickness, has been suspected by people close to him to in reality have been caused by poisoning.&lt;ref name="Brennpunkt"&gt;{{Cite news|first1=Frode|last1=Nielsen|first2=Ebbe|last2=Ording|title=Sporene til Balkan|url=http://www.nrk.no/dokumentar/sporene-til-balkan-1.6581867|publisher=NRK|date=28 April 2009|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per Paust had worked in [[Serbia]] during the 1999 [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]], describing it in private as his most difficult task ever, with balancing acts between the two sides in the conflict and involved in work attempting to stop illegal weapons smuggling.&lt;ref name="Brennpunkt"/&gt; Anne Orderud Paust in turn worked with managing threats against the Foreign Ministry.&lt;ref name="Brennpunkt"/&gt;

Kristin Kirkemo, who was convicted for co-conspiracy to the murders, had in turn established close ties to Yugoslavian mafia in Oslo.&lt;ref name="Brennpunkt"/&gt; The godparents to her son are considered by police to be part of Yugoslavian mafia involved in weapons trade, drug trade, and illegal gambling.&lt;ref name="Brennpunkt"/&gt; Income from the mafia reportedly financed Kosovo Albanian guerilla activity.&lt;ref name="Brennpunkt"/&gt; In early 1999 Norwegian police took part in a European-wide crackdown on Kosovo Albanian mafia, including [[Princ Dobroshi]] which has been proposed as background for the murders, although no direct link has been uncovered.&lt;ref name="Brennpunkt"/&gt; Although overturned in the [[Eidsivating Court of Appeal]], the Nes District Court initially deemed it proven that Kristin Kirkemo placed dynamite under Anne Paus Orderud's car in the 1998 assassination attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Granskere avviser e-påstander i Orderud-saken|url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/nyheter/innenriks/Granskere-avviser-e-pastander-i-Orderud-saken-1922107.html|work=Stavanger Aftenblad|date=23 April 2010|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cousin to Per Orderud claims to have been in contact with criminal sources in Oslo, which alleges that two Yugoslavians from Sweden committed the murders in an ordered hit.&lt;ref name="Brennpunkt"/&gt; Private investigator [[Tore Sandberg]] in 2009 produced the name of a suspected killer from Balkan who allegedly committed the murders along with two others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Utpeker ny Orderud-skytter|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/trippeldrapet-paa-orderud-gaard/utpeker-ny-orderud-skytter/a/588147/|work=Verdens Gang|date=3 November 2009|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4120">'''Pantropy''' is a hypothetical process of [[space colonization]] in which rather than [[terraforming]] other planets or building [[space habitat]]s suitable for human habitation, humans are modified (for example via [[genetic engineering]]) to be able to thrive in the existing environment. The term was coined by [[science fiction author]] [[James Blish]], who wrote a series of short stories based on the idea (collected in the anthology ''[[James Blish#The Seedling Stars (Pantropy)|The Seedling Stars]]'').

==Science fiction works depicting pantropy==

* 1930—In the science fiction [[novel]] ''[[Last and First Men]]'' by [[Olaf Stapledon]], when humanity migrates from [[Earth]] to [[Venus]] and later from Venus to [[Neptune]], human beings are [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] to fit the new environments in which they will be living.
* 1944—One of the first science fiction stories about pantropy (the word had not yet been coined) was the [[short story]] "Desertion," by [[Clifford D. Simak]], which appeared in the November 1944 ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]''. In this story, human colonists living in a [[domed city]] on the planet [[Jupiter]] are put through a biological converter that converts their bodies into the form of the indigenous Jovian lifeform called the "Lopers."  The head director of the domed colony, Kent Fowler, wondering why none of those biologically converted ever come back, goes into the biological converter himself with his [[dog]] and finds that the reason they never come back is that the Lopers have [[brain]]s and [[sense]]s so much in advance of humans that they don't want to come back.  He also finds that he is able to completely accurately [[telepathy|telepathically communicate]] with his dog Towser (whose intelligence has also greatly increased) after going through the converter.  He himself decides not to go back.&lt;ref&gt;Conklin, Groff (editor) ''[[Big Book of Science Fiction]]'' New York:1950 Crown Publishers "Desertion," by [[Clifford D. Simak]] Pages 413-423&lt;/ref&gt; The story was incorporated into the novel ''[[City (novel)|City]]'' (1952).
* 1957—''[[James Blish#The Seedling Stars (Pantropy)|The Seedling Stars]]'', by [[James Blish]], a collection of science fiction stories about pantropy. The best-known of these is "[[Surface Tension (short story)|Surface Tension]]", often anthologized in its original 1952 standalone version.
* 1976—[[Frederik Pohl]]'s novel ''[[Man Plus]]'' is a story about the transformation of a human into a hybrid/[[cyborg]] in order to allow him to live comfortably on [[Mars]].  In the sequel, ''[[Mars Plus]]'', some colonists opt for an intermediate existence, and are known as [[Creole peoples|Creoles]].
* 1981-1983—[[Jack L. Chalker]]'s ''[[Four Lords of the Diamond]]'' series describes the changes in personality that result from physical changes caused by a symbiotic microorganism that adapts humans into a form that can survive on each of 4 different planets.
* 1989-1997—''[[Dan Simmons]]''' ''[[Hyperion Cantos]]'' is a series of four books featuring a faction known as the Ousters, which use pantropy as a way of living in harmony with nature and space.
* 2000—[[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]]'s novels repeatedly deal with pantropy as an approach to the far future of the human species.
* 2002—[[Timothy Zahn]]'s novel Manta's Gift features technology capable of transmitting human consciousness to an alien body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hromic |first1=Alma |title=The SF Site Featured Review: Manta's Gift |url=https://www.sfsite.com/02a/ma145.htm |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2009—[[James Cameron]]'s film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' is a somewhat different take on pantropy.
* 2011—In the manga ''[[Terra Formars]]'', humans sent to Mars undergo genetic modification to inherit the characteristics of other organisms.
* 2014—In the video game ''[[Civilization: Beyond Earth]]'', the Harmony affinity represents pantropy.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3563">{{Evolutionary algorithms}}
'''The promoter based genetic algorithm''' ('''PBGA''') is a [[genetic algorithm]] for neuroevolution developed by F. Bellas and R.J. Duro in the [[Integrated Group for Engineering Research]] (GII) at the University of Coruña, in Spain. It evolves variable size feedforward [[artificial neural network]]s (ANN) that are encoded into sequences of genes for constructing a basic ANN unit. Each of these blocks is preceded by a gene promoter acting as an on/off switch that determines if that particular unit will be expressed or not.

==PBGA basics==

The basic unit in the PBGA is a [[neuron]] with all of its inbound connections as represented in the following figure:

[[File:pbga2.jpg]]

The [[genotype]] of a basic unit is a set of real valued weights followed by the parameters of the [[neuron]] and proceeded by an integer valued field that determines the promoter gene value and, consequently, the expression of the unit. By concatenating units of this type we can construct the whole network.

With this encoding it is imposed that the information that is not expressed is still carried by the genotype in evolution but it is shielded from direct selective pressure, maintaining this way the diversity in the population, which has been a design premise for this algorithm. Therefore, a clear difference is established between the search space and the solution space, permitting information learned and encoded into the genotypic representation to be preserved by disabling promoter genes.

==Results ==

The PBGA was originally presented&lt;ref name="bellasIASTED"&gt;F. Bellas, R. J. Duro, (2002) Statistically neutral promoter based GA for evolution with dynamic fitness functions, Proc. of IASTED International Conference Artificial Intelligence and Applications&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bellasICONIP"&gt;F. Bellas, R. J. Duro, (2002) Modelling the world with statiscally neutral PBGAs. Enhancement and real applications, Proc. 9th Internacional Conference on Neural Information Processing&lt;/ref&gt; within the field of autonomous robotics, in particular in the real time learning of environment models of the robot.

It has been used inside the [[Multilevel Darwinist Brain]] (MDB) cognitive mechanism  developed in the GII for real robots on-line learning. In another paper&lt;ref name="bellas06"&gt;F. Bellas, A. Faiña, A. Prieto, and R.J. Duro (2006), Adaptive Learning Application of the MDB Evolutionary Cognitive Architecture in Physical Agents, Lecture notes on artificial intelligence, vol 4095, 434-445&lt;/ref&gt; it is shown how the application of the PBGA together with an external memory that stores the successful obtained world models, is an optimal strategy for adaptation in dynamic environments. 

Recently, the PBGA has provided results that outperform other neuroevolutionary algorithms in non-stationary problems, where the fitness function varies in time.&lt;ref name="bellas09"&gt;F. Bellas, J.A. Becerra, R. J. Duro, (2009), Using Promoters and Functional Introns in Genetic Algorithms for Neuroevolutionary Learning in Non-Stationary Problems, Neurocomputing 72, 2134-2145&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2704">The term '''recovery consistency objective''' (RCO) is used in [[business continuity planning]] in addition to [[recovery point objective]] (RPO) and [[recovery time objective]] (RTO). It applies [[data consistency]] objectives to [[continuous data protection]] services. Following the definitions for RPO and RTO, RCO defines a measurement for the consistency of distributed business data within interlinked systems after a disaster incident. Similar terms used in this context are "Recovery Consistency Characteristics" (RCC) and "recovery object granularity" (ROG). 
&lt;ref&gt;"How to evaluate a recovery management solution." West World Productions, 2006 [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/How+to+evaluate+a+recovery+management+solution-a0147748661]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term RCO focuses on business data consistency across multiple systems in [[Service-oriented architecture|SOA]]-driven business applications such as [[SAP ERP]]. It can be defined per business processes and reflects the individual requirements of corresponding business data and cross-system consistency. While RTO and RPO are absolute per-system values, RCO is expressed as percentage measuring the deviation between actual and targeted state of business data across systems for individual business processes or process groups.

The following formula calculates RCO with "n" representing the number of business processes and "entities" representing an abstract value for business data:


&lt;math&gt;\text{RCO} = 1 - \frac{(\text{number of inconsistent entities})_n}{(\text{number of entities})_n}&lt;/math&gt;


Targeting 100% RCO for a business process (distributed across several systems) would mean that no business data deviation is allowed after a disaster incident whereas any target below 100% allows deviation. Target values for RCO increase with the criticality of the underlying business data: logistics and banking-related business processes are often characterized by higher RCO requirements than those of CRM or HR systems. 

Including RCO considerations in addition to RTO and RPO in the [[business impact analysis]] helps to focus on the integrity of business data and processes in complex application environments.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Krischer, Donna Scott, Roberta J. Witty: "Six Myths About Business Continuity Management and
Disaster Recovery", Gartner Research [http://www.gartner.com/it/content/868800/868812/six_myths_about_bcm.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; RCO considerations should be included in the [[Disaster Recovery]] Architecture by manually defining multiple consistency points across the landscape or by special Disaster Recovery mirroring tools.

'''Skinning''' is the act of skin removal. The  process is done with animals, mainly as a means to prepare the [[Muscle|muscle tissues]] beneath for consumption or for use of the fur or [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] of the skin. The skin may also be used as a trophy, sold on the fur market, or, in the case of a declared [[Pest (organism)|pest]], used as proof of kill to obtain a [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] from a government health, agricultural, or game agency.{{cn|date= October 2017}}

Two common methods of skinning are '''open skinning''' and '''case skinning'''. Typically, large animals are open skinned and smaller animals are case skinned.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill 1983, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinning, when it is performed on live humans as a form of capital punishment or murder, is referred to as ''[[flaying]]''.

== Skinning methods ==
''Case skinning'' is a method where the skin is peeled from the animal like a sock. This method is usually used if the animal is going to be stretched out or put in dry storage.&lt;ref&gt;Burch 2002, p.63&lt;/ref&gt; Many smaller animals are case skinned, leaving the skin mostly undamaged in the shape of a tube.&lt;ref&gt;Burch 2002, p.66&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the methods of case skinning individual animals vary slightly, the general steps remain the same. To case skin an animal, it is hung upside down by its feet. A cut is made in one foot, and continued up the leg, around the anus and down the other leg. From there the skin is pulled down the animal as though removing a sweater.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill 1983, p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

''Open skinning'' is a method where the skin is removed from the animal like a jacket. This method is generally used if the skin is going to be [[Tanning (leather)|tanned]] immediately or frozen for storage. A skin removed by the open method can be used for wall hangings or rugs.&lt;ref&gt;Burch 2002, p.63&lt;/ref&gt; Larger animals are often skinned using the open method.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill 1983, p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

To open skin an animal, the body is placed on a flat surface. A cut is made from the anus to the lower lip, and up the legs of the animal. The skin is then opened and removed from the animal.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill 1983, p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

The final step is to scrape the excess fat and flesh from the inside of the skin with a blunt stone or bone tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Ray Wiens|Wiens, Ray]] | title = Taxidermy and Field Care Tips and Tricks | work = [[Hunting Tips and Tricks]] | url = http://www.huntingtipsandtricks.com/a/Skinning_for_a_shoulder_mount | accessdate = March 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dorsal skinning'' is very similar to open skinning, however instead of making a cut up the stomach of the animal, the cut is made along the spine. This method of skinning is very popular among [[taxidermists]], as the backbone is easier to access and cleaner than the stomach and between the legs.&lt;ref&gt;Triplett 2006, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;
A dorsal incision is made by laying the animal on its abdomen and making a single cut from the base of the tail to the shoulder region. The animal’s skin is easier to remove if the animal has been freshly killed.&lt;ref&gt;Triplett 2006, p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cape skinning'' is the process of removing the shoulder, neck and head skin for the purpose of displaying the animal as a trophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Ray Wiens|Wiens, Ray]] | title = Taxidermy and Field Care Tips and Tricks | work = [[Hunting Tips and Tricks]] | url = http://www.huntingtipsandtricks.com/a/Skinning_for_a_shoulder_mount | accessdate = March 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal skins and Native Americans==
[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] used skins for many purposes other than decoration, clothing and blankets. Animal skin was  a staple in the Native Americans' daily lives. It was used to make tents, to build boats, to make bags, to create musical instruments such as drums, and to make [[quiver]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Pritzer, Barry. A Native American Encyclopedia: History, Culture, and Peoples. New York: Oxford University Press, 2000. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Native Americans were practiced in the means of acquiring and manipulating animal skin, [[fur trading]] developed from contact between them and Europeans in the 16th century. Animal skin was a valuable currency which the Native Americans had in excess and would trade for things such as iron-based tools and tobacco which were common in the more developed European areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Ann M. Carlos, Frank D. Lewis|Carlos, Ann M., Frank D. Lewis]] | title = The Economic History of the Fur Trade: 1670 to 1870 | date = February 1, 2011 | work = [[EH.net encyclopedia]] | url = http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/carlos.lewis.furtrade | accessdate = March 17, 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130308055848/http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/carlos.lewis.furtrade | archivedate = March 8, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beaver hats became very popular towards the end of the 16th century, and skinning beavers was necessary to acquire their wool. In this time, the beaver skin drastically rose in demand and in value. However, the high number of beavers being harvested for their [[Fur|pelts]] led to a depletion of beavers, and the industry had to slow down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Ann M. Carlos, Frank D. Lewis|Carlos, Ann M., Frank D. Lewis]] | title = The Economic History of the Fur Trade: 1670 to 1870 | date = February 1, 2011 | work = [[EH.net encyclopedia]] | url = http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/carlos.lewis.furtrade | accessdate = March 17, 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130308055848/http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/carlos.lewis.furtrade | archivedate = March 8, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==PETA's stance on skinning==
To raise animals for the purpose of collecting their skin is called ''[[fur farming]]''. [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) alleges that fur farmers are involved in skinning live animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Fur Farms | work = [[PETA]] | url = http://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-clothing/fur-farms.aspx | accessdate = March 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Killing tactics deemed brutal by PETA are also a concern. Many fur farms allegedly skin animals alive to keep the pelts intact from damage that could occur while killing them. To avoid bullet holes, tears or slits from a knife, fur farmers use methods such as beating the animal, electrocuting them, using poison to paralyse them, or breaking their necks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Fur Farms | work = [[PETA]] | url = http://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-clothing/fur-farms.aspx | accessdate = March 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these methods ensure an undamaged pelt, they are sometimes not enough to confirm the death of the animal, leaving the creature to be skinned alive.

The fur trade, however, insists that the only evidence of a fur animal ever being skinned alive was almost certainly staged by animal rights activists. This was a video taken in a Chinese market of a raccoon dog being skinned alive, released in 2005 by Swiss Animal Protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://furcommission.com/chinese-fur-farms-media-wary-of-latest-shock-video/|title=Chinese Fur Farms: Media Wary of Latest Shock Video {{!}} Fur Commission USA|website=furcommission.com|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The fur trade furthermore insists that, for several reasons, animals are never skinned alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.truthaboutfur.com/blog/5-reasons-animals-are-not-skinned-alive/|title=5 Reasons Why Animals Are Never Skinned Alive|date=2016-01-20|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the inhumanity and illegality of such an act, it says that skinning an animal that was still alive would expose the operator to the risk of infection from the animal's claws and teeth, as well as to the risk of being cut with their own knife; would take longer than skinning a dead animal; and would result in a spoiled fur because the animal's beating heart would cover it in blood.

Among many campaigns, one of PETA’s goals is to enforce animal rights so that animals will not be used in any way as tools for humans; including as family pets. This includes utilizing their skin for clothing or decoration, and especially hurting the animals in any way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/25760/animal-rights|title=Animals rights|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=March 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, regardless of the method used for animal skinning, PETA is against the industry in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.peta.org/about/why-peta/default.aspx|title=Uncompromising Stands on Animal Rights|work=[[PETA]]|accessdate=March 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the book was translated into [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=קאקו|first1=מיצ'יו|title=העתיד של המוח|date=2015|publisher=הוצאת אריה ניר|location=רמות השבים|language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The book discusses various possibilities of advanced technology that can alter the brain and mind. Looking into things such as [[telepathy]], [[telekinesis]], [[consciousness]], [[artificial intelligence]], and [[transhumanism]], the book covers a wide range of topics. In it, Kaku proposes a "[[spacetime]] theory of consciousness". Similarly to [[Ray Kurzweil]], he believes the advances in silicon computing will serve our needs as opposed to producing a generation of robot overlords.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/books/review/michio-kakus-future-of-the-mind.html?mcubz=0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In March 16, 2014, ''The Future of the Mind'' made number one on [[The New York Times Bestseller|''The New York Times'' Bestseller]] list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2014-03-16/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html|publisher=[[nytimes.com]]|title=THE FUTURE OF THE MIND, by Michio Kaku.

'''Vadú''', nickname of '''Osvaldo Furtado''', (January 31, 1977 &amp;ndash; January 12, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inforpress.publ.cv/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=23745|title= Câmara da Praia vai financiar transladação dos restos mortais do artista Vadú|newspaper=Inforpress|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  was a Cape Verdean singer and musician.  He defined himself as a real "Badiu" or ironically as a "civilized Black".

He was a nephew the brothers of Zezé and Zeca di Nha Reinalda, two great names of the Santiago Island musical scene, Vadú studied in Cuba between 1990 and 1993 where he "drank" the [[Music of Cuba|current of Cuban music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visaonews.com/nm/templates/ra.aspx?articleid=4174&amp;zoneid=1|title=Vadu foi a enterrar em Santo Antão|newspaper=Visão News|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He appeared in music in 2002 with his first album ''Ayan'' (English: yes, Portuguese: sim), in which he contributed three tracks, accompanied by  members of the [[funaná]] sensational group Ferro Gaita, he later recorded two discs, ''Nha raiz'' (or ''Nha rais'', ''My roots'') in 2004 with the participation of renowned Cape Verdean musicians and ''Dixi Rubera'' in 2007 where he continued the path of popular rhythms and interior styles of Santiago including [[batuque (music and dance)|batuque]], [[tabanka]] and funaná along with Latin influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liberal.sapo.cv/noticia.asp?idEdicao=64&amp;id=23572&amp;idSeccao=518&amp;Action=noticia|title= Entrevista com Osvaldo Furtado - Vadú|trans-title=Interview with Osvaldo Furtado - Vadú|newspaper=Liberal|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also a virtuoso guitarist, he took part in Cape Verdean music festivals including Gamboa and [[Festival de Baía das Gatas|Baía das Gatas]] and abroad especially Portugal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cultura.fnac.pt/Agenda/fnac-lisboa/fnac-cascais/2009/5/1/vadu|title= Ao vivo: Vadu - Dixie Rubera|trans-title=Live: Vadú - Dixie Rubera|language=pt|date=2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 32nd Dunya Festival in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forcv.com/articles/post/2009/05/31/Vadu-Alistado-Entre-os-Grandes-Nomes-da-32c2aa-Edicao-Dunya-Festival.aspx|title= Vadú alistado entre os grandes nomes da 32.ª edição Dunya Festival|trans-title=Vadú Listed on the Big Names at the 32nd Dunya Festival|publisher=forcv.com|language=pt|date=2009-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died at the age of 32 of a car accident as his vehicle fell 50 meters into the ravine.  His body was found two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmjornal.xl.pt/noticia.aspx?channelid=00000021-0000-0000-0000-000000000021&amp;contentid=06F8B53A-9F55-44CD-B935-52FE5E52B4D4&amp;h=6|title=Cabo Verde: Corpo de Vadú resgatado do mar|trans-title=Body of Vadú Rescued from the Sea|newspaper=CM Journal|location=Lisbon|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Weston school shooting''' was a [[school shooting]] that occurred on September 29, 2006, in [[Weston High School (Wisconsin)|Weston High School]] in [[Cazenovia, Wisconsin|Cazenovia]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The perpetrator, student Eric Hainstock, entered the school's main hallway with a [[revolver]] and fatally shot principal John Klang. He is serving a life sentence and will be eligible for parole in 2037.

==Details==
On 29 September 2006, Eric Hainstock, a 15 year old [[freshman]] at Weston High School, entered the main hallway of the school with a [[.22 LR|.22 caliber]] [[revolver]] and a [[Gauge (bore diameter)|20-gauge]] [[shotgun]] taken from his father's locked gun cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel3000.com/news/9965185/detail.html Principal Dies In School Shooting – News Story – WISC Madison]&lt;/ref&gt; After arriving at school around 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., he aimed the shotgun at a social studies teacher. The school custodian, Dave Thompson, wrestled the shotgun away from Hainstock. Principal John Alfred Klang then entered the hallway and confronted Hainstock, who was still armed with the handgun. Hainstock grabbed the revolver from inside his jacket and fired several shots. Klang then grabbed Hainstock, wrestled him to the ground and swept away the gun. Klang was on top of Hainstock, a pool of blood by Klang's leg. Staff and students apprehended Hainstock, holding him until the police arrived.&lt;ref&gt;"Boy, 15, guns down Weston High School principal." ''La Crosse Tribune''. September 20, 2006; November 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Klang was treated at Reedsburg Area Medical Center where he underwent surgery, and was then flown to the [[University of Wisconsin Hospital]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], where he died shortly after 3&amp;nbsp;p.m. Klang was the only one shot in the shooting. For his actions in wrestling away the gun and subduing Hainstock, Klang was posthumously awarded the Carnegie Medal by the [[Carnegie Hero Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plumsystems.com/db/chf/plum_press2.asp?id=79725|title=John A.

The high school students were initially taken to the elementary school gym, where they had the option to talk to a crisis counselor or go home. The elementary students were taken home by bus or by their parents. The homecoming events were canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15060698|title=Details emerge about teen held in Wis. shooting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perpetrator==
The perpetrator of the shooting was 15-year-old '''Eric Hainstock''', a freshman at Weston High School. Hainstock lived with his father and stepmother in a two-story A-Frame farm house about four miles northwest of [[Cazenovia, Wisconsin|Cazenovia]] in [[La Valle, Wisconsin|La Valle]] located on a hill surrounded by farm land. Eric Hainstock was born on April 4, 1991 in [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]] to Shawn Hainstock and Lisa Marie Buttke.&lt;ref name=free&gt;{{cite web|title=Eric Hainstock: Free at last|url=http://www.isthmus.com/isthmus/article.php?article=23349}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents divorced when he was two years old, and in December 1995 went to court to seek custody of Eric. When Hainstock was nine, his mother's parental rights were terminated by court-order after she failed to pay child support.&lt;ref name=free/&gt;

His father remarried and Eric was adopted by his stepmother. Hainstock's father was unemployed and received disability pensions. In September 2001, the Sauk County Department of Children and Families were called to the residence after he had allegedly kicked his son.&lt;ref name=free/&gt; By court-order, Eric was forced to live with his paternal grandmother, before he returned to his father's care in April 2002. In a letter he submitted to [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] based newspaper ''[[Isthmus (newspaper)|Isthmus]]'', Eric claimed he was treated like a slave by his father, having to do all of the cleaning, even having to clean past midnight. He claimed to have been severely disciplined by his father. He claimed that his father would make him stand in his bedroom corner with his nose touching a wall and holding one of his legs in the air for long periods.

At Weston High School, Eric claimed that about 25 to 30 students bullied him. When he complained to the faculty at the school, Eric claims that nothing was done to prevent the bullying. In early 2006, Hainstock had started his fifth year at Weston High School where he had transferred in 6th grade, after having behavior problems and relatively poor test scores at his previous school. On one occasion shortly before the shooting, Eric and his stepmother were involved in a physical confrontation and Eric was left with human bite marks on him. After Eric shot John Klang, he told police that he had not meant to hurt him; his goal was to confront him and "make him listen" about the bullying. He reported that he was only allowed to shower once a week, which left him with poor hygiene. The clothes and shoes that his father bought for him were in poor condition and were not the right size.&lt;ref name=free/&gt;

It later transpired that as a student, Eric had been under medication and using [[prescription drugs]] in a bid to treat ADHD. Dr. Peter Breggin, a doctor and an expert on the US drug industry  has theorized that there is a possibility that these prescription drugs could have caused imbalances in Eric, leading to him carrying out the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knezev|first1=Sasha|title=The big lie : American Addict 2 (Interview with Dr. Breggin)|publisher=Director: Sasha Knezev|accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in prison, Michael Caldwell from [[Middleton, Wisconsin]] diagnosed Eric with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]].&lt;ref name=free/&gt;

== Imprisonment ==
Hainstock was charged with [[first-degree murder]] by the [[Sauk County]] District Attorney's office, and was found guilty on August 2, 2007. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, and will be eligible for parole in 2037 when he is 46 years old.&lt;ref name=free/&gt;

Hainstock is currently serving his sentence at the [[Wisconsin Secure Program Facility]] in [[Boscobel, Wisconsin]] after previously being incarcerated at the [[Green Bay Correctional Institution]] in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]. While in prison, he has allowed ''Isthmus'' to share his story. He has written a ten-page letter with the help of his cell-mate. According to Hainstock, he has gained 50 pounds, his reading went from a fourth grade level to a tenth grade level, and he is working on his [[General Educational Development|GED]]. Hainstock's father and stepmother Priscilla visit him about every month. In his letter, Hainstock takes responsibility for what he did, but he believes that he is not to blame for everything.&lt;ref name=free/&gt; In October 2008, Hainstock's supportive cellmate at Green Bay was reassigned without any official explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isthmus.com/isthmus/article.php?article=26112|title=Crime and Punishment: Part 2: A rebirth behind bars}}&lt;/ref&gt;
