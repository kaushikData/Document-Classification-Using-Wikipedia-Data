      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2464">The '''African Beach Games''' is a continental multi-sport event held among athletes from the Africa. The Games are organised under the governance of the [[Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa]] (ANOCA). The Games were announced by the ANOCA President, '''Lassana Palenfo''', in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1027341/palenfo-encouraged-to-run-for-fourth-term-as-anoca-president-as-african-beach-games-receives-green-light|title=Palenfo encouraged to run for fourth term as ANOCA President as African Beach Games receives green light|date=1431759780|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the competing nations are from the [[Africa|African]] continent. The first Games are due to be held on the island of [[Sal, Cape Verde (municipality)|Sal]], Cabo Verde ([[Cape Verde]]) in June 2019. The Games were awarded to the Cabo Verdean Olympic Committee (COC) at the ANOCA General Assembly in Djibouti in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1046957/cape-verde-set-to-be-awarded-african-beach-games-at-anoca-general-assembly|title=Cape Verde set to be awarded African Beach Games at ANOCA General Assembly|date=1486905480|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The host contract was signed in March 2018 between the City Hall of Sal, the [[Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa]] (ANOCA) and the Cabo Verdean Olympic Committee (COC), to carry out of the first African Beach Games 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.inforpress.publ.cv/sal-city-hall-formalizes-agreement-to-host-the-2019-african-beach-games/?lang=en|title=Sal: City Hall formalizes agreement to host the 2019 African Beach Games - Inforpress|date=2018-03-14|work=Inforpress|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albert Fratellini''' was a famous [[cheese]][[circus]] [[clown]] who helped to redefine the role of the [[clown#Clown types|Auguste]]. He was a member of the [[Fratellini Family]]. Albert was born in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], in 1886. He died in [[Épinay-sur-Seine|Épinay]], [[France]], in 1961. He had two brothers: 
[[François Fratellini]] (1879 - 1951) and [[Paul Fratellini]] (1877 - 1940).

The '''All Thailand Golf Tour''' (or simply as '''ATGT''') is the main [[professional golf tour]] played by both [[men]] and [[women]] in [[Thailand]]. All Thailand Golf Tour office is headquartered in [[Bangkok]], Thailand. Originally the "TPC Tour", it adopted the name "All Thailand Golf Tour" in 1999.

The tour is open to professionals and amateurs. Each tournament is a stroke play event held over four days of approximately 72 holes with the cut being made after two days after approximately 36 holes.

==History==
The tour began in 1999 and was advanced by the first chairman of [[Asian Tour]], Supphaphorn Marphongphong, who further gathered more support from other professional golfers in Thailand and correspondingly became All Thailand Golf Tour's first commissioner. [[Boonchu Ruangkit]], professional golfer, has been the Chairman of All Thailand Golf Tour Tournament Player Committee (TPC) since 1999 and is still actively involved with ATGT's development.

In 2018, the [[OWGR]] announced that the All Thailand Golf Tour would be added into the world rankings starting in 2019.

[[Musicology]] commonly classifies [[scale (music)|scale]]s as either '''hemitonic''' or '''anhemitonic'''. Hemitonic scales contain one or more [[semitone]]s, while anhemitonic scales do not contain semitones. For example, in [[Music of Japan#Traditional music|traditional Japanese music]], the anhemitonic [[yo scale|''yo'' scale]] is contrasted with the hemitonic [[in scale|''in'' scale]].&lt;ref&gt;Anon. (2001) "Ditonus", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]]. London: Macmillan Publishers; [[Bence Szabolcsi]] (1943), "Five-Tone Scales and Civilization", ''Acta Musicologica'' 15, Fasc. 1/4 (January–December): pp. 24–34, citation on p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest and most commonly used scale in the world is the atritonic anhemitonic [[Pentatonic scale#Hemitonic and anhemitonic|"major" pentatonic scale]]. The [[whole tone scale]] is also anhemitonic.

[[Image:Hungarian minor scale on C.png|thumb|right|Hungarian minor scale on C, a cohemitonic scale.&lt;ref name="Kahan"&gt;Kahan, Sylvia (2009). ''In Search of New Scales'', p. 39. {{ISBN|978-1-58046-305-8}}. Cites Liszt. ''Des Bohémians'', p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; {{audio|Hungarian minor scale on C.mid|Play}}]]

A special subclass of the hemitonic scales is the '''cohemitonic''' scales.&lt;ref&gt;Christ, William (1966). ''Materials and Structure of Music'', v.1, p. 39. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice–Hall. LOC 66-14354.&lt;/ref&gt; Cohemitonic scales contain two or more semitones (making them hemitonic) such that two or more of the semitones appear consecutively in scale order.  For example, the [[Hungarian minor scale]] in C includes F{{music|#}}, G, and A{{music|b}} in that order, with a semitone between F{{music|#}} and G, and then a semitone between G and A{{music|b}}.

[[Image:Octatonic scales on C.png|thumb|right|330px|Octatonic scales on C, hemitonic but ancohemitonic {{audio|Octatonic scales on C.mid|Play}}.]]

'''Ancohemitonic''' scales, in contrast, either contain no semitones (and thus are anhemitonic), or contain semitones (being hemitonic) where none of the semitones appear consecutively in scale order.&lt;ref&gt;Tymoczko, Dmitri (1997). "The Consecutive-Semitone Constraint on Scalar Structure: A Link between Impressionism and Jazz", ''Intégral'', v.11, (1997), p. 135-179.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2015}}&lt;!--The term is not found in the cited source.--&gt;  Some authors, however, do not include anhemitonic scales in their definition of ancohemitonic scales.  Examples of ancohemitonic scales are numerous, as ancohemitonia is favored over cohemitonia in the world's musics: [[diatonic scale]], melodic major/[[Melodic minor#Melodic minor scale|melodic minor]], [[Hungarian major scale]], [[harmonic major scale]], [[Harmonic minor#Harmonic minor scale|harmonic minor scale]], and the so-called [[octatonic scale]].

Hemitonia is also quantified by the number of semitones present. Unhemitonic scales have only one semitone; dihemitonic scales have 2 semitones; trihemitonic scales have 3 semitones, etc.  In the same way that an anhemitonic scale is less dissonant than a hemitonic scale, an unhemitonic scale is less dissonant than a dihemitonic scale.

The qualification of cohemitonia versus ancohemitonia combines with the cardinality of semitones, giving terms like: dicohemitonic, triancohemitonic, and so forth.  An ancohemitonic scale is less dissonant than a cohemitonic scale, the count of their semitones being equal.  In general, the number of semitones is more important to the perception of dissonance than the adjacency (or lack thereof) of any pair of them.  Additional adjacency between semitones (once adjacency is present) does not necessarily increase the dissonance, the count of semitones again being equal.&lt;ref name="Keith, Michael 1991. p. 45"&gt;Keith, Michael. 1991. ''From Polychords to Polya : Adventures in Musical Combinatorics'', p. 45. Princeton: Vinculum Press. {{ISBN|978-0963009708}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to these semitone classifications are '''tritonic''' and '''atritonic''' scales.  Tritonic scales contain one or more [[tritone]]s, while atritonic scales do not contain tritones.  A special monotonic relationship exists between semitones and tritones as scales are built by projection, q.v. below.

The harmonic relationship of all these categories comes from the perception that semitones and tritones are the severest of [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonances]], and that avoiding them is often desirable.  The most-used scales across the planet are anhemitonic. Of the remaining hemitonic scales, the ones most used are ancohemitonic.

== Quantification of hemitonia and its relationship to ancohemitonia ==
Most of the world's music is anhemitonic, perhaps 90%.&lt;ref name="Keith, Michael 1991. p. 43"&gt;Keith, Michael. 1991. ''From Polychords to Polya : Adventures in Musical Combinatorics'', p. 43. Princeton: Vinculum Press. {{ISBN|978-0963009708}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Of that other hemitonic portion, perhaps 90% is unhemitonic, predominating in chords of only 1 semitone, all of which are ancohemitonic by definition.&lt;ref name="Keith, Michael 1991. p. 43"/&gt; Of the remaining 10%, perhaps 90% are dihemitonic, predominating in chords of no more than 2 semitones.  The same applies to chords of 3 semitones.&lt;ref&gt;Keith, Michael. 1991. ''From Polychords to Polya : Adventures in Musical Combinatorics'', p. 48-49. Princeton: Vinculum Press. {{ISBN|978-0963009708}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In both later cases, however, there is a distinct preference for ancohemitonia, as the lack of adjacency of any two semitones goes a long way towards softening the increasing dissonance.

The following table plots sonority size (downwards on the left) against semitone count (to the right) plus the quality of ancohemitonia (denoted with letter A) versus cohemitonia (denoted with letter C).  In general, ancohemitonic combinations are fewer for a given chord or scale size, but used much more frequently so that their names are well known.

Column "0" represents the most commonly used chords.,&lt;ref name="Keith, Michael 1991. p. 45"/&gt; avoiding intervals of M7 and chromatic 9ths and such combinations of 4th, chromatic 5ths, and 6th to produce semitones.  Column 1 represents chords that barely use the harmonic degrees that column "0" avoids.  Column 2, however, represents sounds far more intractable.&lt;ref name="Keith, Michael 1991. p. 45"/&gt;

Column 0, row 5 are the full but pleasant chords: 9th, 6/9, and 9alt5 with no 7.&lt;ref name="Wilmott, Brett 1994 p.210"&gt;Wilmott, Brett. (1994) ''Mel Bays Complete Book of Harmony Theory and Voicing'', p.210. Pacific, Missouri: Mel Bay. {{ISBN|978-1562229948}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Column "0", row "6", is the unique [[whole tone scale]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.367. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt;  Column "2A", row "7", a local minimum, refers to the [[diatonic scale]] and melodic major/[[Melodic minor#Melodic minor scale|melodic minor]] scales.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.362-363. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ancohemitonia, inter alii, probably makes these scales popular.  Column "2C", row "7", another local minimum, refers to the [[Neapolitan major scale]], which is cohemitonic and somewhat less common but still popular enough to bear a name.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.363. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt;  Column "3A", row "7", another local minimum, represents the [[Hungarian major scale]], and its involution, and the [[harmonic major scale]] and involution [[Harmonic minor#Harmonic minor scale|harmonic minor scale]] of the same.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.364. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt;  Column "3A", row "6", are the hexatonic analogs to these four familiar scales,&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.369. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt; one of which being the [[Augmented scale]],&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.368. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt; and another the analog of the [[Octatonic scale]] - which itself appears, alone and solitary, at Column "&gt;=4A". row "8".&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.360. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt;  Column "2A", row "4", another minimum, represents a few frankly dissonant, yet strangely ''resonant'' harmonic combinations: mM9 with no 5, 11{{music|flat}}9, dom13{{music|flat}}9, and M7{{music|sharp}}11.&lt;ref name="Wilmott, Brett 1994 p.210"/&gt;

As music tends towards increasing dissonance through history, perhaps someday Column 2 will be as acceptable as even Column 1 might be, and Column 3 will finally have a place in the harmony of the world.

Note, too, that in the highest cardinality row for each column before the terminal zeros begin, the sonority counts are small, except for row "7" and the "3" columns of all sorts.  This explosion of hemitonic possibility associated with note cardinality 7 (and above) possibly marks the lower bound for the entity called "scale" (in contrast to "chord").

As shown in the table, anhemitonia is a property of the domain of note sets cardinality 2 through 6, while ancohemitonia is a property of the domain of note sets cardinality 4 through 8 (3 through 8 for improper ancohemitonia including unhemitonia as well).  This places anhemitonia generally in the range of "chords" and ancohemitonia generally in the range of "scales".

== Example: hemitonia and tritonia of the perfect-fifth projection ==
The interrelationship of semitones, tritones, and increasing note count can be demonstrated by taking five consecutive pitches from the [[circle of fifths]];&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Paul. 1973. ''Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach'', p. 18. New York: Dodd, Mead. {{ISBN|0-396-06752-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; starting on C, these are C, G, D, A, and E. Transposing the pitches to fit into one [[octave]] rearranges the pitches into the [[Major pentatonic scale#Major pentatonic scale|major pentatonic scale]]: C, D, E, G, A.  This scale is anhemitonic, having no semitones; it is atritonic, having no tritones.

|}

In addition, this is the maximal number of notes taken consecutively from the circle of fifths for which is it still possible to avoid a semitone.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.29. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding another note from the circle of fifths gives the major hexatonic scale: C D E G A B.  This scale is hemitonic, having a semitone between B and C; it is atritonic, having no tritones.  In addition, this is the maximal number of notes taken consecutively from the circle of fifths for which is it still possible to avoid a tritone.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.40. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding still another note from the circle of fifths gives the major heptatonic scale: C D E F G A B (when the fifth is added from below the tonic).  This scale is strictly ancohemitonic, having 2 semitones but not consecutively; it is tritonic, having a tritone between F and B.  Past this point in the projection series, no new intervals are added to the [[Interval vector]] analysis of the scale,&lt;ref name="HansonHoward1"&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p. 33. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt; but cohemitonia results.

[[File:Ionian mode C.png|thumb|right|300px|P7 projection/major heptatonic on C {{audio|Ionian mode C.mid|Play}}.]]

Adding still another note from the circle of fifths gives the major octatonic scale: C D E F F{{music|sharp}} G A B (when the fifth is added from above the top note in the series--B in this case).  This scale is cohemitonic, having 3 semitones together at E F F{{music|sharp}} G, and tritonic as well.&lt;ref name="HansonHoward1" /&gt;

Similar behavior is seen across all scales generally, that more notes in a scale tend cumulatively to add [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant intervals]] (specifically: hemitonia and tritonia in no particular order) and cohemitonia not already present.  While also true that more notes in a scale tend to allow more and varied intervals in the [[interval vector]], there might be said to be a ''point of diminishing returns'', when qualified against the also increasing dissonance, hemitonia, tritonia and cohemitonia.  It is near these points where most popular scales lie.&lt;ref name="HansonHoward1" /&gt;

== Cohemitonic and hemitonic scales ==

Though less used than ancohemitonic scales, the cohemitonic scales have an interesting property.  The sequence of two (or more) consecutive halfsteps in a scale presents the opportunity to "split" the scale by placing the [[Tonic (music)|tonic note]] of the scale on the middle note of the halfstep span.  This allows a [[leading tone]] from below [[Resolution (music)|resolving]] upwards, as well as a descending [[Neapolitan chord|flat-supertonic]] upper [[Neighbor note#Neighbor tone|neighbor]], both converging on the tonic.  The split turns a weakness - dissonance of cohemitonia - to a strength: [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] convergence on the tonic.  It is very common that a cohemitonic (or even hemitonic) scale (e.g.: [[Hungarian minor]] { C D E{{music|flat}} F{{music|#}} G A{{music|flat}} B }) be [[Modulation (music)#Parallel key modulation|displaced preferentially]] to a mode where the halfstep span is split (e.cont.: [[Double harmonic scale]] { G A{{music|flat}} B C D E{{music|flat}} F{{music|#}} }), and by which name we more commonly know the same [[Necklace (combinatorics)|circular series]] of intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Schillinger, Joseph. (1941) ''The Schillinger System of Musical Composition'', v.1, p. 113ff. New York: Carl Fischer. {{ISBN|0306775212}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cohemitonic scales with multiple halfstep spans present the additional possibility of [[Modulation (music)|modulating]] between tonics each furnished with both upper and lower neighbors.

== Modes of heptatonic scales and the key signature system ==

[[File:A-major f-sharp-minor.svg|thumb|right|150px|Key signature [[A major]] / [[F-sharp minor|F{{music|#}} minor]], an ancohemitonic heptatonic scale.]]

Western music's system of [[key signature]] is based upon the assumption of a [[heptatonic scale]] of 7 notes, such that there are never more than 7 accidentals present in a valid key signature.  The global preference for anhemitonic scales combines with this basis to highlight the 6 ancohemitonic heptatonic scales,&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p. 362ff. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt; most of which are common in [[romantic music]], and of which most Romantic music is composed:
* [[Diatonic scale]]
* Melodic major/[[Melodic minor#Melodic minor scale|melodic minor]]
* [[Hungarian major scale]]
* involution of Hungarian major
* [[Harmonic major scale]]
* [[Harmonic minor#Harmonic minor scale|Harmonic minor scale]].

These cohemitonic scales are less common:
* [[Double harmonic major scale]]
* [[Neapolitan major scale]]
* [[Neapolitan minor scale]]
* Ionian {{music|b}}5 scale
* Persian scale
* Locrian {{music|#}}7 scale.
Adhering to the definition of heptatonic scales, these all possess 7 [[Mode (music)|modes]] each, and are suitable for use in [[Modulation (music)#Parallel key modulation|modal mutation]].&lt;ref&gt;Christ, William (1966). ''Materials and Structure of Music'', v.1, p. 45. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall. LOC 66-14354.&lt;/ref&gt;  They appear in the table above in Row "7", Columns "2A" and "3A".

===Table of key signatures===
The following lists the key signatures for all possible untransposed modes of the aforementioned heptatonic scales using the note C as the tonic.

'''Big Rapids Distribution''' was a [[Detroit]]-based [[distribution (business)|distributor]] focusing on [[underground newspaper]]s, radical literature, and [[underground comix]]. They were responsible for the unusually good coverage that underground comix and underground papers got in the Michigan area in the early 1970s, when they could be found in most full-service newsstands there. At its height, shortly before it went bankrupt in 1980, Big Rapids was functioning as an alternative independent distributor in the central and southern Michigan areas, selling a full line of magazines and paperbacks, as well as comics.

== Services ==
Among the periodicals distributed by Big Rapids were the ''[[Berkeley Barb]]'', ''[[Fifth Estate (periodical)|Fifth Estate]]'', ''[[Creem]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and ''[[High Times]]'', in addition to a plethora of underground comix.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Big Rapids was founded as a [[Detroit]]-area [[cooperative]] circa 1970 as the '''Keep On Truckin' Coop'''. They eventually changed their name when they moved their headquarters to [[Big Rapids, Michigan]], but retained their [[co-op]] structure. Jim Kennedy, Big Rapids' "first-among-equals," described the company as an "alternative [[direct market|Independent Distributor]]."

=== Rise to prominence ===
Big Rapids' entry into mainstream comics distribution came in early 1975, when [[Donahoe Brothers Inc.]] of [[Ann Arbor]] went under and Big Rapids purchased its assets. (Up to that point, Big Rapids had bought its mainstream comics from Donohoe Brothers.)

Moving their headquarters back to Detroit, Big Rapids was aggressive, often taking over the businesses of customers who ran up large debts (ironic, given that their delivery vehicles carried pictures of [[Karl Marx]] on the inside doors). At its height, Big Rapids was actually functioning as an alternative independent distributor in the Detroit and central and southern Michigan areas, selling a full line of magazines and paperbacks, as well as comics.

==== Acquisitions ====
; Distributors acquired by Big Rapids:
* [[The Comic Distributor]] — run by Jim Friel. Big Rapids called in Friel's debt in 1979 and he became an employee for a year. (The name "The Comic Distributor" was later taken by Mark Hylton of [[Comic Carnival]].)
* [[Isis News]] (Minneapolis, Minnesota)
* [[Nova (distributor)|Nova]] (Los Angeles, California)
* [[Well News Co.]] (Columbus, Ohio) — their personnel became the nucleus of an early [[Capital City Distribution]] branch
* [[Wisconsin Independent News Distributors]] (WIND) — run by [[Milton Griepp]] and John Davis, who later founded [[Capital City Distribution]]&lt;ref name="ICv2"&gt;[http://icv2.com/about/ "Who We Are: Milton Griepp," ICv2.com.] Accessed October 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bankruptcy and dissolution ===
In 1980, despite being the largest of many distributors in the direct market, Big Rapids went bankrupt and their assets were liquidated.

There was a scramble to fill the void; a couple of new companies that grew briefly from the wreckage lasted only briefly — [[Comic Kingdom]] (Bob Hellems' company in Detroit) and [[Common Ground Distributors]] ([[Robert Beerbohm]]'s in the San Francisco Bay Area). Most of the pieces were picked up by the brand-new [[Capital City Distribution]] or by [[New Media Distribution]].

'''Bris Funny Fest''' is a fringe [[comedy festival]] held for the first time in September 2016 in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]. 

The festival was started by Kath Marvelley in 2016 as an alternative once it became clear that the annual Brisbane Fringe Festival was not going to be running in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/brisbanefringefestival/posts/1062889803784570|title=Brisbane Fringe Festival|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now the second largest comedy festival in [[Queensland]] with over 50 events as part of its 2017 program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brisfunnyfest.com/#gallery|title=Bris Funny Fest Shows|website=brisfunnyfest.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring bigger acts such as [[Matt Okine]]. It encompasses genres such as [[stand-up comedy]], [[Improvisational theatre]], [[sketch comedy]] and [[musical theatre]] amongst others. It "showcases everything from established international artists to emerging performers putting on a show for the first time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brisfunnyfest.com/|title=Bris Funny Fest|website=brisfunnyfest.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival is an open access "[[unjuried]]" festival (the model used by the [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]]). There is no fee to be part of the festival, with the organisation being managed by a team of volunteers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brisfunnyfest.com/Home/Team|title=Bris Funny Fest Team|website=brisfunnyfest.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; led in 2017 by [[Steven Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stevenmorgan.wales/comedy/|title=Comedy &amp; Acting|date=2016-09-22|work=Steven Morgan|access-date=2017-07-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://inputerror.co.uk/features/8909-running-a-festival-in-a-foreign-country|website=InpuTerror.co.uk|title=Running A Festival In A Foreign Country|date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://medium.com/@ma0sm/lessons-learned-organising-a-comedy-festival-e71292123e78|website=Medium.com|title=Lessons Learned Organising A Comedy Festival|date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 it was announced that Adam O'Sullivan was taking over as festival director.

Bris Funny Fest operates in venues all over Brisbane, though the majority of events take place at Heya Bar in [[Fortitude Valley, Queensland]]. Performers are free to approach any venue to host their event, with guidance offered to both performer and venue by the organisers.

== Previous Brisbane Fringe Festival ==
The Brisbane Fringe Festival ran from 2012 to 2015, co-directed by Kylie Southwell&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecreativeissue.com.au/lessons-from-brisbane-fringe-2013/|title=Lessons from Brisbane Fringe 2013|date=2013-10-21|work=The Creative Issue - News for Creatives|access-date=2017-07-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; with comedy curation by Scott Black&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2013/08/20/3829519.htm|title=Brisbane Fringe Comedy Festival|date=2013-08-20|website=www.abc.net.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; who now works as an advisor on Bris Funny Fest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brisfunnyfest.com/Home/Team|title=Bris Funny Fest Team|website=brisfunnyfest.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Although this broadcasting station belongs to JNN/JRN/NRN, its relation with Asahi Shimbun is also deep once. Therefore, on BSS radio, the Asahi Shimbun news of independence work are broadcast during the morning.
* That key stations differ on radio and television Since the system of the area of the television station opened from the second half of the 1950s to the second half of the 1960s was 1 prefecture 1 wave in principle when beginning television broadcasting of this broadcasting station, In Tottori Prefecture in which [[Nihonkai Television|Nihonkai TV]] (日本海テレビ) which had already begun broadcast at this time exists, it is because its service cannot be started, but it is Shimane Prefecture which had not prepared the television station yet then and its service was to be started first.
** And already, the request of a start of television broadcasting was replied to Tottori Prefecture, and Tottori Prefecture has also started television broadcasting at last in September, 1972.
* Simultaneous broadcast of the program besides the series which Nihonkai TV, such as a "morning news show" and "DORAEMON", and [[San-in Chuo Television Broadcasting|San-in Chuo TV]] (山陰中央テレビ) are treating to one time in television broadcasting till September, 1989 might be carried out also by BSS.

The '''Chris Benoit double-murder and suicide''' refers to a three-day period between June 22 and June 24, 2007, when [[Chris Benoit]], a 40-year-old veteran [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] employed by [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE), killed his wife [[Nancy Benoit]] and strangled their 7-year-old son Daniel before hanging himself. [[Autopsy]] results showed that Benoit's wife was murdered first as she was bound at the feet and wrists and died of [[asphyxia]]tion on June 22. Nancy was found wrapped in a towel and with blood under her head, although [[Fayette County, Georgia|Fayette County]] [[District Attorney]] Scott Ballard reported no other signs of a struggle.

The couple's son, Daniel Christopher Benoit, also died of asphyxia, apparently killed as he lay in bed on the morning of June 23. Then, on the evening of June 24, Benoit died by [[suicide]] in his [[Weight training|weight room]], when he used a weight lifting machine to hang himself, breaking his own neck. He placed copies of the [[Bible]] alongside the bodies of his wife and son, as well as a third Bible on his weight lifting machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,286834,00.html |title=Wrestler Chris Benoit Double Murder-Suicide: Was It 'Roid Rage'? |publisher=Foxnews.com |date=2007-06-27 |accessdate=2011-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628221021/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,286834,00.html |archive-date=June 28, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sherwood |first=Roxanna |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/Story?id=3562665&amp;page=1 |title=Benoit's Dad, Doctors: Multiple Concussions Could Be Connected to Murder-Suicide – ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2007-09-05 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Benoit's suicide, numerous explanations for his actions have been proposed, including [[brain damage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=3560015&amp;page=1 |title=Benoit's Brain Showed Severe Damage From Multiple Concussions, Doctor and Dad Say – ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2007-09-05 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[steroid]] abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,289649,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Wrestler Chris Benoit Used Steroid Testosterone; Son Sedated Before Murders | date=2007-07-17 | access-date=November 13, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904025150/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,289649,00.html | archive-date=September 4, 2009 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a failing marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wsbtv.com/news/15281734/detail.html |title=Police Report: Chris Benoit Thought His Marriage Was Failing;... |publisher=www.wsbtv.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829064034/http://www.wsbtv.com/news/15281734/detail.html |archivedate=August 29, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident led to numerous media accounts, and a federal investigation into [[Doping in sport|steroid abuse]] in [[professional wrestling]].

== Murders and suicide ==

=== Nancy Benoit ===
{{Main|Nancy Benoit}}
On Friday, June 22, Chris Benoit killed his wife Nancy in an upstairs bedroom. Her limbs were bound, and her body was wrapped in a towel. A copy of the [[Bible]] was left by her body. Injuries indicated that Benoit had pressed a knee into her back while pulling on a cord around her neck, causing [[Strangling|strangulation]]. Blood was also found under her head, suggesting that she may have tried to fend off Benoit.{{contradict-inline|reason=Contradicts next sentence (isn't attempting to fend off an attack a type of struggle?)|date=September 2018}} Officials said that there were no signs of immediate struggle.&lt;ref name="press conference2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Officials: unknown attacker Strangled Wife, Suffocated Son, did drugs|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,286737,00.html |author=Blane Bachelor |publisher=Fox News Channel|accessdate=2008-05-21 |date=2007-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toxicologists found alcohol in her body, but were unable to determine whether it had been present before death or was a [[decomposition]] product. Decomposition also made it difficult to estimate pre-death levels of [[hydrocodone]] and [[alprazolam]], found in "therapeutic levels" in her body. In any case, her medical examiner saw no evidence that she was sedated, as her son had been when he was killed.&lt;ref name="Decomposition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingnewsworld.com/wwe-news/b_live_coverage_benoit_toxicology_results_press_conference_b.php|title=Toxicology Results Of Chris, Nancy, &amp; Daniel Benoit Revealed|publisher=Wrestling News World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Daniel Benoit ===
Daniel Christopher Benoit (February 25, 2000{{spaced ndash}}June 23, 2007) was Chris' third child and second son, having older paternal half-siblings named David and Megan via Chris's first wife, Martina. He was Nancy's only child, as she had no children with her ex-husbands Jim Daus and [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Daniel was suffocated and killed in his bedroom, and a copy of the Bible was left by his body.&lt;ref name="Divorce"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/fayette/stories/2007/06/25/0625benoit.html |archivedate=June 29, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629211435/http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/fayette/stories/2007/06/25/0625benoit.html |title=Police: Benoit killed wife, son, left Bibles by their bodies |author1=SAEED AHMED |author2=KATHY JEFCOATS |author3=S.A.

It was later alleged that Daniel had [[Fragile X syndrome]], and that this was the cause of domestic problems in the Benoit family.&lt;ref name="DivorceNotes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Police: An unknown attacker killed Benoit's wife, son, left Bibles by their bodies |work=The Atlanta-Journal Constitution |date=2007-06-25 |url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/fayette/stories/2007/06/25/0625benoit.html |accessdate=2008-05-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070709161213/http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/fayette/stories/2007/06/25/0625benoit.html|archivedate=July 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also suggested that needle marks on Daniel's arms were the result of growth hormones given to him because Benoit and his family considered him undersized due to Fragile X.&lt;ref name="Needle+2ndText"&gt;{{cite news |title=Steroids discovered in probe of slayings, suicide |publisher=ESPN |author=Mike Fish |date=2007-06-27 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=2917133 |accessdate=2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benoit's coworker and best friend, wrestler [[Chris Jericho]], stated that from his own research on the condition, the symptoms "fit Daniel to a tee, all across the board". With regard to those who had publicly stated that they had no knowledge of Daniel having the condition, Jericho said, "If Chris had decided that he wanted to keep it to himself, you wouldn't have been able to pry that out of him with anything."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= Nancy Grace|series=Nancy Grace|network= [[CNN]]|station= |airdate= 2007-06-28|season= |seriesno= |number= |minutes= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC5oFj_yCnE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Chris Jericho's initial statements regarding Daniel, he later stated in his 2011 book ''Undisputed'', "It turned out that Daniel didn't have Fragile X, but at the time it made sense because I was grasping at straws."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title= Chapter 46 Benoit|series= Chris Jericho – Undisputed: How to Become the World Champion in 1,372 Easy Steps|url= https://www.scribd.com/doc/51894120/46/CHAPTER-46-Benoit|access-date= September 9, 2017|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121108084050/http://www.scribd.com/doc/51894120/46/CHAPTER-46-Benoit|archivedate= November 8, 2012|deadurl= yes|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

District Attorney Ballard later released a statement saying that a source with access to Daniel's medical files found no mention of any pre-existing mental or physical ailments. Likewise, Daniel Benoit's teachers reported that he was on par with other students and not about to be held back as previously thought.&lt;ref name="Needle+3rdText"&gt;{{cite news |title=Prosecutor disputes that Benoit son had Fragile X |publisher=ESPN |date=2007-07-03 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=2925280 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking publicly for the first time in a major public interview on a ''[[Chris Jericho#Podcast|Talk is Jericho]]'' podcast in 2016, Nancy's sister Sandra Toffoloni, who was intimately related with the Benoit family, unequivocally denied any claims that Daniel had ever had Fragile X or any other such sickness. She also stated that claims of needle track marks on Daniel's arms were "preposterous".&lt;ref name="TIJ-SandraT"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jericho|first1=Chris|title=Inside The Benoit Family Tragedy on Talk Is Jericho - EP259|url=http://podcastone.com/pg/jsp/program/episode.jsp?programID=593&amp;pid=1658885|website=podcastone.com|publisher=[[PodcastOne]]|accessdate=25 June 2016|date=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After the murders ===
At about 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. EDT on Saturday, June 23, fellow wrestler and close friend [[Chavo Guerrero Jr.|Chavo Guerrero]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pro Wrestling Torch: Chavo Guerrero interview on Greta van Susteren show |url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_21032.shtml |first=Wade|last=Keller|authorlink=Wade Keller|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch |date=2007-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; received a [[voicemail]] message from Benoit's phone stating that he had overslept and missed his flight and would be late for that night's [[house show]] in [[Beaumont, Texas]]. Guerrero called Benoit back and found that Benoit sounded tired and groggy as he confirmed everything that he had said in his voice message. Guerrero, who was "concerned about Benoit's tone and demeanor," called him back 12 minutes later. Benoit did not answer the call, and Guerrero left a message asking Benoit to call back.

At 3:44&amp;nbsp;p.m. EDT, Benoit called Guerrero back, stating that he had not answered the call because he was on the phone with [[Delta Air Lines]] changing his flight. Benoit stated that he had a stressful day due to Nancy and Daniel "being sick from food poisoning." Guerrero then replied with "All right man, if you need to talk, I'm here for you." Benoit ended the conversation by saying "I love you, Chavo." During a 2014 appearance on [[Chris Jericho#Podcast|Chris Jericho's Talk is Jericho podcast]], Guerrero said Benoit sounded "off" when he talked to him, especially when he said "I love you". Another co-worker who often traveled with Benoit called him from outside the [[Houston]] airport and Benoit answered. Benoit told the coworker that Nancy was vomiting blood and that Daniel was also vomiting.

On Sunday, June 24, five text messages were sent to co-workers between 3:51&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 3:58&amp;nbsp;a.m. using both Chris Benoit's and Nancy Benoit's cell phones. Four of them were the Benoits' address; the fifth said that the family's dogs were in the enclosed pool area, and also noted that a garage side door had been left open. Guerrero and [[Scott Armstrong (wrestler)|Scott Armstrong]] were two of the recipients of these texts.

During this time, Benoit called and left a voicemail for an unknown friend. Benoit later called WWE's talent relations office stating that his son was vomiting and that he and Nancy were at the hospital with him. He also stated that he would be taking a later flight into Houston where he was scheduled to face [[CM Punk]] for the vacant [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship]] at [[Vengeance: Night of Champions]], but did not make the live event in Beaumont.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2007/06/27/2007-06-27_chris_benoit_timeline-2.html |title=Chris Benoit Timeline|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]] |work=[[Daily News (New York)]] |accessdate=2008-05-21 |date=2007-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chris Benoit ===
Chris Benoit, according to District Attorney Ballard and the city sheriff, committed [[suicide by hanging]].&lt;ref name="press conference"/&gt; Benoit used a weight machine cord to hang himself by creating a [[noose]] from the end of the cord on a [[Pulldown exercise|pull-down]] machine from which the bar had been removed. When Benoit released the weights, the move caused his [[Strangling|strangulation]]. Ballard said Benoit was found hanging from the pulley cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/06/27/officials-wrestler-strangled-wife-suffocated-son-hanged-self.html|title=Officials: Wrestler Strangled Wife, Suffocated Son, Hanged Self|date=2007-06-27|work=Fox News|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 2016 ''Talk is Jericho'' podcast, Nancy's sister Sandra Toffoloni clarified some details further. She said that over the weekend after the murders, the search history on Benoit's computer showed he had researched "the quickest and easiest way to break a neck". He had then later used a towel around his neck attached to the handle of the machine, which he pulled down using a very heavy weight and let go, breaking his neck instantly.&lt;ref name="TIJ-SandraT" /&gt;

=== Discovery of the bodies ===
On Monday, June 25, 2007, [[WWE]] (specifically [[John Laurinaitis]], the WWE's Senior Vice President of Talent Relations) was notified of the text messages sent to Chavo Guerrero and Scott Armstrong. The company asked the Fayette County Sheriff's Department to check on the Benoit family. After discovering the bodies, the police notified WWE around 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m., informing them that they had discovered three bodies at the Benoit home and the house was now ruled as a "major [[crime scene]]".&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;

A [[suicide note]] was not discovered during the initial investigation, but a note was later discovered in another Bible that had been included in Benoit's possessions that were sent to his first wife. According to professional wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer, "There was a note that was found in a Bible by the mother of Chris's two children (Martina Benoit) who lives in Canada. The Bible was mixed in with Chris' personal belongings that were shipped to them." Chris Benoit's father Michael Benoit stated, "He had a hand-written notation in there saying 'I'm preparing to leave this Earth.'"&lt;ref name="Suicide+Note1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Chris Benoit's father: Murderous rampage resulted from brain damage, not steroids |publisher=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=2010-10-16 |url=http://www.ajc.com/news/chris-benoits-father-murderous-683532.html |accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suicide+Note2"&gt;{{cite news |title=New information comes out about Chris Benoit and his murder-suicide |publisher=Cageside Seats |date=2010-12-22 |url=http://www.cagesideseats.com/2010/12/22/1892494/new-information-comes-out-about-chris-benoit-and-his-murder-suicide |accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible motives ==
WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt appeared on ''[[Verdict with Dan Abrams|Live with Dan Abrams]]'' on July 17, 2007, and said that Benoit was prescribed [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] as part of a treatment for testosterone replacement therapy, which McDevitt said was a common medical practice for people who had used [[Anabolic steroid|steroids]] in the past, and had suffered [[Testicle|testicular]] damage as a result.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Former wrestler [[Christopher Nowinski]] stated that Benoit may have been suffering from repeated, untreated concussions throughout his wrestling career, ultimately leading to an unstable mental state. Nowinski was quoted as saying that Benoit "was one of the only guys who would take a chair shot to the back of the head&amp;nbsp;... which is stupid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/27/us/27wrestler.html |title=Wrestler Killed Wife and Son, Then Himself |author=Brenda Goodman |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2008-05-21 |date=2007-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests conducted on Benoit's brain by Julian Bailes, the head of [[neurosurgery]] at [[West Virginia University]], showed "Benoit's brain was so severely damaged it resembled the brain of an 85-year-old [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]] patient".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=3560015&amp;page=1 |title=Benoit's Brain Showed Severe Damage From Multiple Concussions, Doctor and Dad Say |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=2007-09-05 |date=2007-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other tests conducted on Benoit's [[Human brain|brain tissue]] revealed severe [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE),&lt;ref name=cte&gt;{{cite web |title=Wrestler Chris Benoit Brain's Forensic Exam Consistent With Numerous Brain Injuries |publisher=Science Daily |date=2007-09-06 |accessdate=2008-05-01 |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070905224343.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and damage to all four [[lobes of the brain]] and [[brain stem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Benoit's Brain Showed Severe Damage From Multiple Concussions, Doctor and Dad Say |publisher=[[ABC News]] |work=[[Good Morning America]] |date=2007-09-05 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Story?id=3560015&amp;page=2 |accessdate=2008-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bailes and his colleagues concluded that repeated concussions can lead to [[dementia]], which can contribute to severe behavioral problems. Benoit's father said that brain damage may have been the leading cause of the double [[murder-suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wsbtv.com/news/14047066/detail.html/ |title=Brain Study: Concussions Caused Benoit's Rage |publisher=WSB Atlanta |accessdate=2007-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116191052/http://www.wsbtv.com/news/14047066/detail.html |archivedate=November 16, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A statement released by WWE dismissed this idea as "speculative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-09-05-benoit_N.htm |title=Doctor: Wrestler Benoit had 'shocking' brain damage |work=USA Today |author=Jon Swartz |accessdate=2008-05-21 |date=2007-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nancy Benoit had filed for divorce in May 2003, allegedly after [[Domestic violence|domestic abuse]] from Chris, but had withdrawn it in August 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aolcdn.com/tmz_documents/0626_benoit_dismiss.pdf |title=Benoit Divorce Papers |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627232104/http://www.aolcdn.com/tmz_documents/0626_benoit_dismiss.pdf |archive-date=June 27, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' (''AJC'') reported that Nancy may have suspected her husband of having an affair with a [[WWE Diva|female]] WWE wrestler, and that they may have also argued over a [[life insurance]] policy. The ''AJC'' claimed the source was a recently released report from the [[Fayette County, Georgia|Fayette County]] Sheriff's Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Benoit's wife may have been planning to leave him |work=The Atlanta-Journal Constitution |first=John|last= Hollis |date=2008-02-15 |url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/fayette/stories/2008/02/15/benoit_0217.html |accessdate=2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking on the matter in his autobiography ''The Hardcore Truth'', [[Hardcore Holly]] speculates the main influence in Benoit's actions was alcohol abuse rather than steroids. Holly and Benoit traveled together on the road during their time together in WWE, and Holly did not believe steroids played a factor and that Benoit had tended to drink more than he normally would consume when issues with Nancy arose.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

== Responses ==

=== World Wrestling Entertainment ===
The deaths were first reported to fans of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) on their WWE Mobile Alerts Service and posted to its official website soon after. On its website, the company released the following statement:

{{bquote|World Wrestling Entertainment is deeply saddened to report that today [[Chris Benoit]] and his family were found dead in their home. There are no further details at this time, other than the Benoit family residence is currently being investigated by local authorities. Tonight’s ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' on [[USA Network]] will serve as a tribute to Chris Benoit and his family. WWE extends its sincerest thoughts and prayers to the Benoit family’s relatives and loved ones in this time of tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2007/2007_06_25.jsp |title=WWE Superstar Chris Benoit Found Dead |publisher=WWE Corporate |accessdate=2008-05-21 |date=2007-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516081401/http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2007/2007_06_25.jsp |archivedate=May 16, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

WWE canceled the scheduled three-hour-long live ''Raw'' show on June 25 (which, coincidentally, was supposed to be a memorial for the [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon]] character), and replaced the broadcast version with a tribute to his life and career, featuring past matches, segments from the ''Hard Knocks: The Chris Benoit Story'' [[DVD]], and comments from wrestlers and announcers from the ''[[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]]'', ''[[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown!]]'', and ''[[ECW (WWE)|ECW]]'' brands. Shortly after the program aired, many of the aired comments were posted on WWE.com. It was not until the program was nearly over that reports surfaced that police were working under the belief that Benoit murdered his wife and son before killing himself.

The next night, after some of the details of the deaths became available, the company aired a recorded statement by [[Vince McMahon]] before its ''ECW'' broadcast:

{{bquote|Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Last night on ''Monday Night Raw'', the WWE presented a special tribute show, recognizing the career of Chris Benoit. However, now some 26 hours later, the facts of this horrific tragedy are now apparent. Therefore, other than my comments, there will be no mention of Mr. Benoit's name tonight. On the contrary, tonight's show will be dedicated to everyone who has been affected by this terrible incident. This evening marks the first step of the healing process. Tonight, WWE performers will do what they do better than anyone else in the world: entertain you.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.cnbc.com/id/19448064/ WWE's McMahon Should Have Apologized]'';by [[Darren Rovell]]; by [[Darren Rovell]]; ''[[CNBC]]'', 26 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After learning about the full details of his and his family's deaths, WWE quickly distanced itself from Chris Benoit:
* With the exception of his results and listings in WWE's title history (though the summaries of his title reigns have been removed), and select press releases from WWE's corporate subsite,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2007/2007_07_17.jsp |title=World Wrestling Entertainment Issues Statement |publisher=WWE Corporate |accessdate=2008-05-21 |date=2007-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516085626/http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2007/2007_07_17.jsp |archivedate=May 16, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; the WWE website removed all past mentions of Benoit, including all news articles relating to the specific details of the incident, as well as his biography and the video tribute comments from Benoit's peers.
* WWE pulled the tribute episode from international markets which aired ''Raw'' on a tape delay basis. Several channels announced the episode was being withheld for legal reasons. A substitute ''Raw'', hosted by [[Todd Grisham]] from WWE Studios, was created featuring recaps of [[WWE Championship]] and [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] matches which had occurred over the past year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work= Wrestlinginc.com |url= http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2016/0805/615235/chris-benoit-tribute-raw-episode-added-to-wwe-network/ |title= RAW Episode That Was Originally Chris Benoit Tribute Added To WWE Network, NXT Tickets, WWE Shop |accessdate= 2018-04-18 |date= 2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some countries that received WWE programming up to three weeks late had all Chris Benoit matches edited out.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* The merchandising website, WWEShop.com, followed suit with regard to all Benoit-related merchandise removed from the online store.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* WWE Niagara Falls, a WWE operated retail store and attraction in Niagara Falls, Ontario, removed the cement handprints of Benoit following the incident. Any and all merchandise regarding Benoit were removed from the store as well.
*  Benoit's name was removed from his previous theme song, "Rabid," on the MP3 release of ''[[WWE Anthology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008HS8AOA/ref=dm_dp_trk32|title=Amazon.com: Rabid: WWE &amp; Jim Johnston: MP3 Downloads|work=amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Benoit, along with his "[[Crippler Crossface]]" and other signature moves, were removed from the ''[[WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008]]'' video game, after Benoit was originally included in the game as a playable character. However, starting with ''[[WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010|WWE SmackDown vs Raw 2010]]'', the move was reinstated under "Crossface".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wrestlingobserver.com/wo/news/headlines/default.asp?aID=21568 |title=Jereme Warneck has strong opinions regarding aspects of Smackdown Vs.

* [[WWE Classics On Demand]], WWE's subscription [[video on demand]] service, began removing the likeness and mentions of both Chris and Nancy Benoit from archival footage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pwpix.net/headlines/185532428.php |title=Benoit Edited Off Of WWE 24/7, Heated Warrior Interview, Lance Storm |accessdate=2007-07-08 |publisher=PWPix.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707134413/http://www.pwpix.net/headlines/185532428.php |archivedate=July 7, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rajah.com/base/node/8452 |title=Possible WrestleMania XXV Sites, Benoit Match On WWE 24/7, Raw Rating Delayed |accessdate=2007-07-08 |publisher=Rajah.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually returned Nancy to programming, but continued to remove Chris from bi-weekly uploaded episodes of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]''.
* Matches and other footage involving Benoit appeared very sparingly on any WWE DVD releases following his death, with all of them being footage involving multiple wrestlers such as a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] or a multiple-person [[tag team]] match. The [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]] [[WarGames match|WarGames]] DVD by WWE, which features all of the WarGames matches, does include the [[Fall Brawl (1997)|1997 WCW Fall Brawl]] WarGames match between the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] versus the [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]], featuring Benoit (who wasn't involved in the finish of the match), but has commentary about Benoit edited out,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/0620/563559/cm-punk-trying-to-get-colt-cabana-a-job-with-wwe/|title=CM Punk Trying To Get Colt Cabana A Job With WWE, Rock Loses Money On Mansion, Chris Benoit|work=WrestlingInc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|certain=y|date=May 2017}} though Benoit is referred to as a "mystery partner". 
* Footage of Benoit is available on the [[WWE Network]], though no results are shown when searching his name. There were initially no bookmarks available for matches he participated in, but {{as of|2017|lc=y|df=US}}, his matches are bookmarked with the name(s) of his opponent(s), but not with his name (e.g. "Hardy Boyz and Chris Jericho in a Six-Man Tag Match"). A parental advisory is shown before a program featuring Benoit begins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_75440.shtml#.UsxTGvspqSo |title= WWE NEWS: Ross returns to TV on ESPN, Benoit/WWE Network update, top indie tag team turned down? |publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch |first=James |last=Caldwell |accessdate=2014-01-03 |date=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WWE Network shows the June 25, 2007 internationally aired episode of Raw that deals with Cena's title wins instead of the original Benoit tribute show. The opening promo for the June 26, 2007 ECW show with Vince McMahon, mentioning Chris Benoit, has also been omitted from the broadcast. Additionally, some pay-per-view posters which featured Benoit have been replaced with new artwork on the Network's menu screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2014/0224/571576/details-on-wwe-network-handling-of-chris-benoit-footage-advisory/ |publisher=Wrestlinginc.com |first=Daniel |last=Pena |accessdate=2016-12-23 |date=2014-02-24 |title=Details On WWE Network's Handling Of Chris Benoit Footage - Advisory Shown Prior To Shows}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|certain=y|date=May 2017}}
*  In 2015, Benoit's name was mentioned as part of the WWE Network ''Monday Night Wars'' series that looks back at the fall of WCW. This marked the first time Benoit was mentioned by name on new WWE programming since 2007. The segment featured the 2000 invasion angle with Benoit, Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko and Perry Saturn however when the footage was shown it focused more on the other three and less on Benoit.
* In a 2009 interview with [[WWE Magazine]], Vince McMahon discussed Benoit's legacy saying "it's not right to pretend he didn't exist. It's one thing to include him as part of a historical perspective, which I believe is okay, and it's another thing to promote him, which is not okay. The situation is very similar to that of [[O. J. Simpson|O.J. Simpson]] despite his controversy, O.J. was still a part of the [[National Football League|NFL]] scene. You can't deny that he existed."
* Benoit is listed in the ''WWE Encyclopedia'', where his wrestling career up to where he lost the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] to [[Randy Orton]] is detailed, along with his title history.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* Promotional materials for the [[Royal Rumble]] pay-per-view regularly state that only two wrestlers have ever won the Royal Rumble match from the number one entry. However, only [[Shawn Michaels]] is mentioned by name. {{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* In ''[[WWE 2K15]]'', in the 2K Showcase Mode Storyline, "Best Friends, Bitter Enemies," circulating around the rivalry between Triple H and Shawn Michaels from 2002 to 2004, it was mentioned that after their Last Man Standing Match at the [[Royal Rumble (2004)|2004 Royal Rumble]], both Triple H and Shawn Michaels would compete in a Triple Threat Match at [[WrestleMania XX]] which neither of them won, but the third competitor in that match, Benoit, is not mentioned in this case.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* Canadian rock band [[Our Lady Peace]], who had written Benoit's theme song "Whatever" in 2001, were asked if they would ever perform the song again in a 2012 interview. The band responded that they felt they couldn't given the circumstances of Benoit's death. They had not performed the song for several years prior to Benoit's death, however.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Professional wrestling industry ===
Numerous individuals in professional wrestling, past and present, commented on the deaths and their aftermath:
* Semi-retired professional wrestler and [[WWE Hall of Fame]]r [[Hulk Hogan]] commented on Benoit's personality and his thoughts on the crime, saying: "He was peaceful and kept to himself" and "I think it had to be something personal, a domestic problem between him and his wife."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hulk Hogan talks to ''US'' About the Killer Wrestler |url=http://usmagazine.com/hulk_hogan_talks_to_i_us_i_about_the_killer_wrestler |work=Us Weekly |date=2007-07-03 | accessdate=2008-05-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080324151143/http://www.usmagazine.com/hulk_hogan_talks_to_i_us_i_about_the_killer_wrestler |archivedate = 2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kurt Angle, then [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) employee and now WWE Hall of Famer chose to comment more on the frenzy created by the crime, stating "This is not WWE’s fault and this is not Vince McMahon’s fault.

* [[CM Punk]], in a 2011 interview with ''[[GQ]]'', briefly touched on the subject of the Benoit murder/suicide. He described it as "a pretty... low point in everyone's life.

* Former WCW and WWF rival [[Sean Waltman]], in a 2014 interview, said of Benoit: "He was a pleasant guy, but always had a darkness about him... a sadness, or something". Waltman added that Benoit had a bleak sense of humor, finding amusement in "things that were a little bit bent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Sean "X-Pac" Waltman|url=http://www.podcastone.com/The-Ross-Report?showAllEpisodes=true|accessdate=September 13, 2015|series=The Ross Report|network=PodcastOne|date=December 9, 2014|number=43|minutes=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Benoit was inducted into the [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame]]. As a result of the double [[murder-suicide]], his induction underwent a recall election in 2008. Although over 50% of voters decided to remove Benoit from the Hall, Dave Meltzer (head of the Observer) had set a 60% requirement prior to the election, allowing Benoit to remain in.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Media ===

When the news was released about Benoit's death, most mainstream news outlets covered the story, including [[MSNBC]] and [[Fox News Channel]].&lt;ref name=eye&gt;{{cite news |title=Cops eye 'roid rage in wrestler's murder-suicide |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19424899/ |publisher= [[MSNBC]] |agency=Associated Press |date=2007-06-27 |accessdate=2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cops Suspect Murder-Suicide in Killings of Pro Wrestler Chris Benoit and His Family |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,286673,00.html |publisher=Fox News Channel|date=2007-06-26 |accessdate=2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benoit made the cover of ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine. [[ECW Press]] (which has no affiliation with [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]], a promotion for which Benoit once worked) announced on July 16 that noted wrestling writer Irvin Muchnick had written a book on the Benoit case, due out in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Irvin |last=Muchnick |title=Chris and Nancy Story of Benoit Murder-Suicide |url=http://benoitbook.muchnick.net/ |publisher=ECW News |date=2007-07-16 |accessdate=2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the ''[[Comedy Central Roast of Flavor Flav]]'' in August 2007, [[Jimmy Kimmel]] joked to honoree [[Flavor Flav]] that "Chris Benoit is a better father than Flavor Flav", which drew a shocked, appalled response, and laughs from the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Comedy Central Roast of Flavor Flav |episodelink= |series=[[Comedy Central Roast]] |serieslink= |credits= |network=[[Comedy Central]] |station= |airdate=2007-08-12 |season= |seriesno= |number=5 |minutes=90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government ===
With Benoit and his death allegedly linked to [[Anabolic steroid|steroid]] abuse, WWE went under investigation by the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]] regarding their [[World Wrestling Entertainment#Wellness Program|talent wellness policy]].&lt;ref name=steroid&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20002071/ |title=Congress wants WWE's info on steroids, doping |agency=Associated Press |publisher=MSNBC |date=2007-07-28 |accessdate=2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress did not take action against either the WWE or any other professional wrestling company in the wake of the event. In January 2009, [[Henry Waxman]], outgoing chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, requested that the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] chief, [[John P. Walters]], "examine steroid use in professional wrestling and take appropriate steps to address this problem." In the letter, Waxman stated "In the first year of WWE's testing program, which began in March 2006, 40% of wrestlers tested positive for steroids and other drugs, even after being warned in advance that they were going to be tested." He also wrote about how wrestlers who test positive for performance enhancers receive light punishment and afterwards can often participate in wrestling events. The committee investigation also uncovered how easily wrestlers can secure "therapeutic use exemptions" (TUEs, permission to take banned substances for medical reasons) so they can continue performing while using steroids. When Waxman's staff interviewed Dr. Tracy Ray, a physician contracted by WWE, Ray claimed there was "shadiness in almost every [TUE] case that I've reviewed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more_sports/2009/01/02/2009-01-02_congress_needles_wrestling.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Congress needles wrestling | first=Christian | last=Red | date=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronic traumatic encephalopathy reports==

At the time of the incident, research into chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), led by forensic neuropathlogist [[Bennet Omalu]], in former players of gridiron football codes was a fast-growing issue in the sport that had been at the forefront following Dr. Omalu's 2002 report on [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] member [[Mike Webster]] done after his death.  Numerous recently deceased NFL players whose brains were analysed after their deaths in later years agreed with the report on Webster's death, as each player showed the kind of brain damage previously seen in people with Alzheimer's disease or dementia, as well as in some retired boxers.  Michael Benoit agreed to have his son's brain analysed by the same neurosurgeons.  On September 5, 2007, Julian Bailes, the chief of neurosurgery at West Virginia University, conducted a news conference in New York City to announce the results of Benoit's postmortem brain examination.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trotta|first1=Daniel|title=Brain injury, not steroids, seen in wrestler death|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-wrestler/brain-injury-not-steroids-seen-in-wrestler-death-idUSN0523057520070905|accessdate=2018-03-22|work=Reuters|agency=Thompson Reuters|date=2007-09-05|ref=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"When the (Sports Legacy Institute) approached Michael Benoit about testing Chris’ brain as part of the Sports Legacy Project, our goal was to determine if there was evidence of CTE caused by repeated trauma to the head sustained during Chris Benoit’s career. We have now confirmed multiple concussions are part of his medical history, along with clinical symptoms associated with CTE.  Because my SLI colleagues and I have found evidence of CTE in the brains of four former professional football players, we felt an examination of Chris Benoit’s brain may bring awareness to CTE’s existence outside of boxers and football players.

In December 2009, nearly 30 months after Benoit's death, Dr. Omalu confirmed to ESPN's "Outside the Lines" that the death of a second WWE wrestler, [[Test (wrestler)|Andrew Martin]], known in WWE by his ring name Test, was attributed to CTE.  Bailes told ESPN, "When we announced our findings about Chris, some in the media said it was 'roid rage. We said at the time the real finding was that repeated head trauma was the cause.  With Andrew Martin as the second case, the WWE and the sport in general have to ask themselves, 'Is this a trend?' The science tells us that jumping off 10-foot ladders and slamming people with tables and chairs is simply bad for the brain."&lt;ref name="OTL"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garber|first1=Greg|title=Doctors: Wrestler had brain damage|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/otl/news/story?id=4724912|accessdate=2018-03-22|work=ESPN|publisher=ESOB|date=2009-12-09|ref=OTL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WWE noted the research was new at the time, but released the following statement to ESPN for "Outside the Lines":

{{quote|While this is a new emerging science, the WWE is unaware of the veracity of any of these tests, be it for Chris Benoit or Andrew Martin. Dr. Omalu claims that Mr. Benoit had a brain that resembled an 85-year-old with Alzheimer's, which would lead one to ponder how Mr. Benoit would have found his way to an airport, let alone been able to remember all the moves and information that is required to perform in the ring.&lt;ref name="OTL" /&gt;}}

By late 2017, CTE research in professional wrestling reached a point where numerous wrestlers who died had their brains inspected for research in postmortem research, where numerous wrestlers were later found to have CTE.  These included [[Axl Rotten]], [[Balls Mahoney]], [[Jimmy Snuka]], and [[Mr. Fuji]].&lt;ref name="Balls Mahoney CTE"&gt;{{cite web |title=Axl Rotten And Balls Mahoney Were Diagnosed With CTE |url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2016/1021/618654/first-mma-fighter-diagnosed-with-cte/ |author=William Windsor |website=wrestlinginc.com |accessdate=2017-09-12 |date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |website=[[Ars Technica]] |date=19 July 2016 |accessdate=20 July 2016 |first=Sam |last=Machkovech |title=53 wrestlers file class-action civil suit against WWE over concussions, CTE |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/07/53-wrestlers-file-class-action-civil-suit-against-wwe-over-concussions-cte/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2018|September|df=US}}, over 60 professional wrestlers and representatives of deceased wrestlers are in litigation against WWE in an attempt to hold the organisation accountable for their "long-term neurological injuries" as a result of multiple concussions and CTE.  They are represented by Konstantine Kyros of Kyros Law Firm, PC, who previously represented former NFL players in a CTE-related lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2017/11/04/three-pro-wrestlers-diagnosed-with-cte-similar-disease/waa7bg18APiBZBS0SNa6XM/story.html?s_campaign=bostonglobe%3Asocialflow%3Atwitter Three pro wrestlers diagnosed with CTE or similar disease]&lt;/ref&gt;  The case was initially dismissed, but Kyros is appealing.

== Steroids debate ==

=== Background ===
Steroids were found in the home, leading some media organizations to hypothesize that a steroid-induced rage may be the cause of Benoit's actions, as some doctors have linked steroid use to uncontrollable anger, among other psychological issues which include [[paranoia]].&lt;ref name=eye/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,286834,00.html |title=Wrestler Chris Benoit Double Murder-Suicide: Was It 'Roid Rage'? |author=Catherine Donaldson-Evans |publisher=Fox News Channel |accessdate=2008-05-21 |date=2007-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628221021/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,286834,00.html |archive-date=June 28, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; WWE released a press-statement, challenging the "roid-rage" claims. One part of the statement reads:

{{bquote|The physical findings announced by authorities indicate deliberation, not rage. The wife’s feet and hands were bound and she was [[asphyxia]]ted, not beaten to death.

WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt stated that "they believe the facts of this crime do not support the hypothesis that 'roid rage' played a role in the murders."

=== Toxicology results ===
At the press conference held by the [[Georgia Bureau of Investigation]] on July 17, 2007, it was announced that three different drugs were found in Nancy Benoit's system: [[hydrocodone]], [[hydromorphone]] and [[Alprazolam|Xanax]]. All three drugs were found to be at levels investigators considered normal for therapeutic treatment (as opposed to recreational use or abuse.) A [[Blood alcohol content|blood-alcohol level]] was found at 0.184. Dr. Kris Sperry, the [[medical examiner]], added it was impossible to say whether any of the blood findings was due to ingestion of alcohol or the post-mortem process.&lt;ref name="Decomposition" /&gt; It was also ruled out that Nancy was sedated by Chris before she was murdered.&lt;ref name=AJCToxocResults&gt;{{cite news |title=GBI: Benoit, family had drugs in bodies |author=Greg Bluestein |work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=2007-07-17 |url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/fayette/stories/2007/07/17/benoit_0717.html?cxntlid=homepage_tab_newstab |accessdate=2008-05-21 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xanax was found in Daniel Benoit's system. District Attorney Scott Ballard noted this was not a drug that would be given to a child under normal circumstances. It is believed that Daniel was [[Sedative|sedated]] prior to being murdered, with Sperry ruling out that Daniel died of a drug overdose.&lt;ref name=AJCToxocResults/&gt; The GBI, however, said in the press conference that it could not perform tests for steroids or human growth hormones on Daniel because of a lack of [[urine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Steroids, other drugs found in Benoit's body |publisher=MSNBC |date=2007-07-17 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19810373/?GT1=10150 |accessdate=2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xanax and hydrocodone were also found in Chris Benoit's system, at levels investigators called consistent with therapeutic use. Elevated levels of synthetic anabolic steroid [[testosterone cypionate]] were found in his urine; investigators believed that the level found suggested it had been taken recently. While the synthetic anabolic steroid testosterone cypionate was found in his urine, there was no evidence of GHB contrary to speculation.&lt;ref name=AJCToxocResults/&gt; Benoit also tested negative for blood alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wrestler's slain son was probably sedated, investigators say |agency=Associated Press |publisher=CNN |date=2007-07-17 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/07/17/wrestler.murder/index.html |accessdate=2018-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Benoit/2007/07/17/4346517-ap.html |title=Steroid found in Benoit's body |work=Slam!

=== Drug charges against Benoit's doctor ===
Dr. Phil C. Astin III was the personal doctor for Chris Benoit. His attorney, Manny Aurora, asked a judge to throw out evidence seized during a raid on Astin's office after Benoit and his family died. He claimed the search exceeded authority granted in a search warrant and that police seized other patients' records and three years of bank records and computers.&lt;ref&gt;This comes from the ''Wrestling Observer'', a newsletter dedicated to [[professional wrestling]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Associated Press]] in February 2008, Astin was charged with overprescribing medication in a case not connected to Benoit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.princegeorgecitizen.com/20080204110990/sports/wire-sports/defence-seeks-delay-in-trial-of-personal-physician-of-late-pro-wrestler-benoit.html |title=Defence seeks delay in trial of personal physician of late pro wrestler Benoit |last=Weber |first=Harry R. |date=2008-02-04 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Prince George Citizen |accessdate=2009-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718131954/http://www.princegeorgecitizen.com/20080204110990/sports/wire-sports/defence-seeks-delay-in-trial-of-personal-physician-of-late-pro-wrestler-benoit.html |archivedate=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 29, 2009, he admitted he illegally prescribed drugs, sometimes without examining the patients first, and pleaded guilty to all 175 counts against him.

== Aftermath and legacy ==
In the years following the incident, it continued to be referred to in the media. The murders led to many fans and critics of WWE believing them to be the cause that led WWE to change their programming. Within a few months it was speculated that chair shots to the head were banned in WWE, along with the use of coarse language, blood, and adult oriented situations in storylines becoming limited to nonexistent, although the programming that was on WWE television at the time of the murders was already considerably toned down compared to the [[Attitude Era]], of which Benoit joined WWE at the tail end. This was finalized in mid 2008 in the WWE's switch from a [[TV Parental Guidelines#TV-14|TV-14]] rating to its current [[TV Parental Guidelines#TV-PG|TV-PG]] rating.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

There have been discussions in whether Benoit would ever be inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]]. [[Steve Austin]] commented on Benoit, believing that while he was an important aspect of the business, he would never be inducted into the Hall of Fame due to his actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/1221/568533/steve-austin-talks-about-chris-benoit/|title=Steve Austin Talks About Chris Benoit, Says He Will Never Be In WWE's Hall Of Fame - WrestlingInc.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|certain=y|date=May 2017}} [[Chris Jericho]] also stated that Benoit should never be in the Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/chris-jericho-responds-chris-benoit-hall-of-fame-question|title=Chris Jericho responds to Chris Benoit Hall of Fame question|date=October 16, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*On July 26–27, 2012, the rap group [[Insane Clown Posse]] released a music video for the song called "[[Chris Benoit (song)|Chris Benoit]]". The song and video, however, are not about Benoit himself, but a man's breakdown that's similar to Benoit's.&lt;ref name=freep&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20120625/ENT04/120625074/Insane-Clown-Posse-Chris-Benoit-Violent-J-Shaggy-2-Dope-Juggalos|title=Music - Detroit Free Press - freep.com|work=Detroit Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song and music video, however, does include stock footage and a recording of Chris Benoit before his death. A remix with rappers [[Ice Cube (rapper)|Ice Cube]] and [[Scarface (rapper)|Scarface]] was later released.
*On December 1, 2012, [[Kansas City Chiefs]] linebacker [[Jovan Belcher]] murdered his girlfriend, then took his own life at the Chiefs training facility near [[Arrowhead Stadium]]. The circumstances surrounding that murder-suicide drew some comparisons to the Benoit situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rantsports.com/pro-wrestling/2012/12/02/the-jovan-belcher-tragedy-hits-close-to-home-with-pro-wrestling-fans/|title=The Jovan Belcher Tragedy Hits Close To Home With Pro Wrestling Fans|work=RantSports}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In March 2013, ''Murder's Magazine'' produced a front page/article on the Chris Benoit incident launching further questions.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
*In a July 2013 interview, Nancy Benoit's sister Sandra Toffoloni said she believes a blackout caused him to murder her sister. She stated that the medical examiner who examined Benoit's body stated he had only ten more months to live due to an enlarged heart. Sandra Toffoloni also stated that Benoit was contemplating retirement and opening a wrestling school but he decided to continue due to being in one of the main events at Vengeance for the ECW Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://network.yardbarker.com/all_sports/article_external/chris_benoits_sister_in_law_comments_on_2007_murdersuicide_and_more/13946689/ |title=Chris Benoit’s Sister-In-Law Comments on 2007 Murder/Suicide and More |work=yardbarker.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714184300/http://network.yardbarker.com/all_sports/article_external/chris_benoits_sister_in_law_comments_on_2007_murdersuicide_and_more/13946689/ |archivedate=July 14, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/78625/nancy-benoits-sister-discusses-the-benoit-tragedy-for-the-first-time-says-chris-benoit-was-within-a-year-of-dying-at-time-of-benoit-tragedy.html?p=1|title=NANCY BENOIT'S SISTER DISCUSSES THE BENOIT TRAGEDY FOR THE FIRST TIME, SAYS CHRIS BENOIT WAS WITHIN A YEAR OF DYING AT TIME OF BENOIT TRAGEDY|author=Mike Johnson|date=July 1, 2013|publisher=PWInsider.com|accessdate=February 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yardbarker.com/all_sports/articles/chris_benoits_sister_in_law_comments_on_2007_murdersuicide_and_more/13946689/|title=Chris Benoit’s Sister-In-Law Comments on 2007 Murder/Suicide and More|work=Yardbarker}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A biopic titled ''Crossface'' is being developed, which will be based on Matthew Randazzo's book ''Ring of Hell: The Story of Chris Benoit and the Fall of the Pro Wrestling Industry''. It shows Benoit from his early days being trained by the [[Hart wrestling family|Hart family]], to his rise with ECW, WCW and WWE, to the deaths of his wife, son and his own suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/film/liev-schreiber-to-play-chris-benoit-in-crossface-movie.php#lZAGIRBwIu7zJlsC.99|title=Liev Schreiber To Play Chris Benoit In Crossface Movie|work=WhatCulture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie was originally announced in 2011 with plans to begin filming in 2012; however, they were delayed.
*In light of further reports on CTE where numerous WWE wrestlers were diagnosed post-mortem with CTE, litigation has been filed by various wrestlers.

'''Clermont Carn''', variously spelt as "Clermont Cairn", "Clairmont Carn/Cairn" and Carnán Mhaighréid Náir in [[Irish language|Irish]] is a 510m &lt;ref name="mv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mountainviews.ie/mv/index.php?mtnindex=434|title=Cooley Area - Clermont Carn|publisher=MountainViews.ie|accessdate=2008-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; high peak in the [[Cooley Mountains]] in [[County Louth]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], which is also home to a main [[2RN (RTÉ Networks)|2RN]] transmission site.&lt;ref name="rte"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/radio/NE.html |title=RTÉ, Ireland's National Radio Broadcaster |accessdate=2008-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526065828/http://www.rte.ie/radio/NE.html |archivedate=26 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transmission site==
This transmission site in [[County Louth]], was opened in 1981 to provide UHF television coverage for the North East of the [[Republic of Ireland]], counties Louth, Meath, and North county Dublin. However, with the site being less than 1&amp;nbsp;km from the border it was clear that this transmitter would be used to provide [[RTÉ]] services into [[Northern Ireland]]. Initially the two channels [[RTÉ 1]] and [[RTÉ 2]] were carried on Ch52 and Ch56 with [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]]  (Ch66) and [[TG4]] (Ch68) following later. In 1982, a 2M [[Amateur Radio]] Repeater was installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dundalk Amateur Radio Society|title=EI2CCR Repeater|url=http://ei7dar.com/repeater.html|publisher=www.ei7dar.com|accessdate=2013-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  FM radio transmission was also added providing coverage of the five national channels to a wide area.

In 2002 a new cable-stayed mast 120m tall was erected, this greatly improved coverage into Northern Ireland. The existing self-supporting tower was truncated, and is now only used for microwave links and the Amateur Radio Repeater.

[[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]], digital radio broadcasting from Clermont Carn began in 2006 and [[Digital terrestrial television]] (DTT) trials started in 2008.

In common with all [[2RN (RTÉ Networks)|2RN]] transmitters in Ireland, analogue television transmissions from this site ended on 24 October 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Analogue consigned to broadcasting history|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/1025/1224325680199.html|accessdate=2012-06-12|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
but uniquely, Clermont Carn is the only main television transmitter in Ireland that is vertically [[Antenna (radio)#Polarization|polarised]], and does not service any [[Broadcast relay station|relay transmitters]]. Today the Irish digital television service [[Saorview]] is broadcast from here to a sizeable area including a large tract of Northern Ireland, with a good signal being received in [[Belfast]] and beyond. 
This overspill has been welcomed by the UK’s [[Ofcom]] who have provided information for viewers in Northern Ireland about receiving TG4 and the RTÉ channels, both from within Northern Ireland on the UK's [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] service, and via the [[Saorview]] overspill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ofcom|title=Digital Terrestrial TV Coverage Map of TG4  and RTÉ in Northern Ireland|url=http://consumers.ofcom.org.uk/files/2012/07/NIMuxFactsheet4.pdf|publisher=Ofcom|accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Viewing card.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Sky Viewing Card]]

The '''Digibox''' is a [[Information appliance|device]] marketed by [[Sky UK]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] to enable home users to receive digital [[satellite television]] broadcasts (satellite receiver) from the [[SES Astra|Astra]] satellites at [[Astra 28.2°E|28.2° east]]. An [[Internet]] service is also available through the device, similar in some ways to the American [[MSN TV]]. The first Digiboxes shipped to consumers in mid-1998, and the hardware reference design is unchanged since. Compared to other satellite receivers, they are severely restricted. 
==Base technical details==
The Digibox's internal hardware specifications are not publicly disclosed, however some details are clearly visible on the system. All early boxes except the Pace Javelin feature dual [[SCART]] outputs, an [[RS232]] serial port, a dual-output [[RF modulator]] with passthrough, and [[RCA]] socketed audio outputs, as well as a 33.6 [[modem]] and an [[Low-noise block converter|LNB]] cable socket. A [[VideoGuard]] card slot, as well as a second smart-card reader are fitted to the front (these are for the Sky viewing card and other interactive cards). All share an identical user interface and [[Electronic program guide|EPG]], with the exception of Sky+ HD boxes which use the new Sky+ HD Guide. The latest DRX595 has dropped the RF modulator outputs. A PC type interface was fitted internally to some early standard boxes but was never utilised by Sky. The latest HD boxes only have a single scart socket but have a RCA/phono socket for composite video output. All Sky+ and HD boxes have an optical sound output.

The serial port outputs data used for the [[Sky Gnome]] and Sky Talker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dusky-control.com/gnome-protocol.shtml Dusky Control documentation for Sky Gnome protocol]&lt;/ref&gt; The Sky Gamepad sends data to the box via the serial port.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heenan.me.uk/control-sky-from-pc/gamepad-protocol.html Gamepad protocol documentation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Uniquely, the second RF port outputs a 9&amp;nbsp;V power signal which is used to power 'tvLINK' devices that can be attached to the RF cable next to a TV in a remote room. The tvLINK has an IR detector and sends commands from the remote control back to the digibox on a 6&amp;nbsp;MHz carrier on the RF cable. This allows the sky box to be viewed and controlled from another room by running a single RF cable.

All Digiboxes used to run on OpenTV (the latest HD boxes now use what is known internally as Project Darwin software) with Sky's EPG software and [[News Datacom|NDS]] [[VideoGuard]] conditional access. The Digibox receives software updates over the air, even when in standby mode should an update be available. The software features Sky-controlled channel numbering, the ability to view OpenTV or [[WapTV]] applications provided as "interactive" or "teletext" content on channels, parental controls, the ability to order [[Pay per view|PPV]] events and some basic control over lists of favourite channels and show reminders.

Early decoders seemingly support only 700 channels approximately in their channel listing, as Sky has announced it is halting SD channels' launch applications,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rapidtvnews.com/default.asp?sourceid=&amp;smenu=1&amp;twindow=Default&amp;mad=No&amp;sdetail=2053&amp;wpage=&amp;skeyword=&amp;sidate=&amp;ccat=&amp;ccatm=&amp;restate=&amp;restatus=&amp;reoption=&amp;retype=&amp;repmin=&amp;repmax=&amp;rebed=&amp;rebath=&amp;subname=&amp;pform=&amp;sc=1966&amp;hn=rapidtvnews&amp;he=.com]&lt;/ref&gt; with over 100 awaiting launch, over 600 existing channels, and an average closure rate of 1 per week.

==Digibox remote control==
[[File:Sky remote.png|thumb|right|150px|The Standard Sky Remote in blue]]The Digibox [[remote control]] comes in four physical designs - blue with new Sky logo, blue with old Sky logo (this version was being issued from around the first year of the Sky service, although that logo fell out of use before it launched), black with new Sky logo (Sony boxes only) and silver with new Sky logo. However, all have multiple variations at present with a new version of Sky remote control being produced every year, to support the addition of new televisions to its [[universal remote control]] capabilities.

==Use outside Sky's system==
The units are [[DVB-S]] compatible, and usually carry the DVB logo on the front. However, their use as a DVB-S receiver for anything other than Sky services is seriously limited by their reduced choice of [[symbol rate]]s (22,000 and 27,500; additionally 28,250 and 29,000 on [[Sky+ HD]]), and their inability to store more than 50 (fewer still on some models) non-EPG channels without losing them. Following a software "upgrade" the digibox will not display programmes from non 28.2 East Satellites. Additionally, once any form of parental controls are enabled, the "Other Channels" menu requires PIN entry on every use.

The box also refuses to let users view channels which are free-to-air but displaying flags claiming encryption, which locks out some channels even on the satellites Sky use themselves, such as Free to View channels.

==Manufacturers and non-common features==
Digiboxes have been made by [[Amstrad]], [[Sony]], [[Thomson SA|Thomson]], [[Panasonic]], [[Grundig]], and most commonly, [[Pace Micro Technology|Pace]]. Although the reference designs were identical, a number of digibox lines have specific faults or traits, such as failing modems on Grundig units, and unstable tuners on older model Pace boxes. Some units add features not found on other models, such as [[S-Video]] sockets on some Grundig units, and [[TOSLINK]] output on Sony's.

For a long period of time in 2004 and 2005, only one Digibox was in production, the Pace DS430N, but Amstrad and Thomson have resumed production with the DRX500 and DSi4212 boxes respectively. Digiboxes for new customers are assigned randomly, and cannot be chosen, creating an after market for specific boxes due to their individual features. Sky bought out Amstrad satellite production in 2007 and now only distribute boxes which initially appeared as Amstrad models but are now badged merely as Sky.

==Standardised design==
In late 2005, it was announced that all future Digiboxes would have a standardised cosmetic design, although retain the three current makers, and have a slightly redesigned remote control, which would be recoloured white with some blue keys.

Thomson and Amstrad began supplying these boxes in late 2005, with Pace following in late 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tech/news/a27526/new-design-for-skys-digibox.html|title=New Design For Skys Digibox|publisher=Digital Spy|date=21 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standardised design is known as the "Flow" design.

==Other Digiboxes==
A second generation of Digibox exists, marketed as [[Sky+]]. These [[Digital video recorder|PVR]] units have three versions: the 40&amp;nbsp;GB PVR1, the 40&amp;nbsp;GB PVR2, and the PVR3 which is fitted with a 160&amp;nbsp;GB HDD with 80GB available for user recordings, and the remaining 80&amp;nbsp;GB reserved for use by Sky Anytime. All have dual LNB inputs and an optical digital audio output, as well as all other features of the Sky box. These units are manufactured by Amstrad, Pace and Thomson only, and use a different remote control. USB ports are fitted to the PVR3. When Sky+ was launched, there was an additional £10 monthly charge to access the Sky+ functionality if two or more premium packages were not subscribed to. Sky have now removed this charge, effective 1 July 2007. Without a Sky+ Subscription, the Sky+ box reverts to the functionality of a normal Digibox, albeit without Autoview modes.

The [[Sky+]]2TB box has 2&amp;nbsp;TB to record to and is manufactured solely by Thomson. This unit is also fitted with USB ports. (this unit has been discontinued)

A third generation of Digibox also exists, with the additional ability to receive [[DVB-S2]] [[HDTV]] signals in the [[MPEG-4]] format. The initial sole manufacturer of these [[Sky+ HD]] boxes was Thomson, and made their debut on 22 May 2006 with the launch of HDTV channels on Sky. Although around 17,000 digiboxes were initially produced, they could not meet demand and some had to wait for longer for their SkyHD Digibox. Past manufacturers are Thomson, Pace, Amstrad and Samsung.

These boxes have all the features of a Sky+ box, as well as a [[HDMI]] output, and the early Thomson DSI8215 model has component video output. Both [[Serial ATA|SATA]] and [[Ethernet]] ports are also supplied, currently used for the [[Sky Anytime+]] service. As well as requiring a Sky+ subscription or any subscription, HD versions of the subscription channels require the payment of an additional £10.25 (or €15) per month, although HD channels can be viewed on free-to-air services such as [[BBC One|BBC One HD]], [[BBC Two|BBC Two HD]], [[BBC Three|BBC Three HD]], [[BBC Four|BBC Four HD]], CBBC  HD, [[ITV HD]], [[ITVBe|ITVBe HD]], [[Channel 4|Channel 4 HD]], [[NHK World|NHK World HD]] and with a Freesat from Sky card, [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5 HD]].

On 16 March 2011, Sky launched the Sky HD box, primarily targeted at multiroom subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/news/a309271/sky-launches-new-multiroom-hd-box.html|title=Sky launches new Multiroom HD box|publisher=Digital Spy|date=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also used for Freesat from Sky installations. The Sky HD box is not a personal video recorder, meaning it has no hard disk and cannot support the Sky+ functionality. These were later replaced with Sky+HD boxes, which had both sets of functionality.

==Card Pairing==
All Sky boxes, whether Digiboxes, Sky+ or SkyHD incorporate card pairing. This involves the 'marrying' or 'pairing' of a viewing card to one particular STB, thus preventing one card (and indeed subscription) being used on multiple digiboxes. During installation the engineer will initiate a 'callback' from the STB to Sky via modem and telephone line, transmitting details of the viewing card number and the box in which it is installed. Once this step has been completed it is no longer possible to view premium channels such as Movies or Sports on any other box besides that which the card was paired with. Notably, the card can still be used to view non-premium channels such as [[Sky1]] but will display an error message when attempting to watch a movie channel or sports channel with an unpaired box and card combination. A card can be 're-paired' in some instances such as STB replacement or multiroom relocation, however this must be initiated by Sky and cannot be completed by an end-user.

==Power consumption==
Standard Digiboxes use almost as much power in standby as when active; the "standby" setting merely mutes the sound and cuts off the picture, but internal signal processing continues at the same rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dusky-control.com/power-consumption.shtml Sky Digibox power consumption]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sky+ boxes are believed to reduce their power consumption more significantly in standby because they can spin down hard disks. Power consumption for the standard box varies from around 10 to 18 Watts. Most Sky+HD boxes consume up to 60W when active, falling to ~30W when the disc is powered down. To some degree, this has been addressed with the latest DRX890/895 HD boxes. These have a power consumption of 45W max but now have a "deep sleep" mode consuming around 1/2 W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3004">'''Elise Stevenson''' (February 9, 1878 &amp;ndash; November 18, 1967) was a British-born [[United States|American]] [[soprano]] singer who recorded commercially successful [[popular music|popular songs]] in the early years of the 20th century.

==Biography==
She was born Eliza Stevens in [[Liverpool]], [[England]], and emigrated to the United States.  She became a member of the Lyric Quartet, with [[Harry Macdonough]], [[Frank C. Stanley|Frank Stanley]], and Corrine Morgan, and also of the Trinity Choir. From 1907, she recorded as a solo singer for [[Victor Records]].  Frank Stanley was her manager, as well as her partner in many duet recordings; she also recorded with Harry Macdonough, and [[Henry Burr]].&lt;ref name="whitburn memories"/&gt;  Her most successful recordings included "The Linger Longer Girl" (1907), "Because You're You" (1907), "Are You Sincere?" (1908), "[[Good Evening, Caroline]]" (with Frank Stanley, 1909), and "[[Shine On, Harvest Moon]]" (with Harry Macdonough, 1909).&lt;ref name="whitburn memories"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Whitburn | first1 = Joel| title = Pop Memories 1890-1954: The History of American Popular Music| location = Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin| publisher = Record Research, Inc. | year= 1986| pages = 412| isbn = 0-89820-083-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/jukebox/artists/detail/id/2537/  Library of Congress, National Jukebox]. Retrieved 16 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

She married Milton Rusling Wood in 1905,&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/F63X-74R New York, Marriages, 1686-1980]&lt;/ref&gt; and thereafter was occasionally billed as Elise (or Elsie) Wood.  She retired from recording at the peak of her popularity, soon after 1911, to raise a family.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=q4mXh7krTxkC&amp;pg=PT198&amp;dq=%22Elise+Stevenson%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hp6UUZiOJLCX0QX-jYDoAw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Elise%20Stevenson%22&amp;f=false  Tim Gracyk, ''Popular American Recording Pioneers: 1895-1925'', Routledge, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Faria: A World of Mystery and Danger!''''', known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Faria Fuuin no Tsurugi'''''|ファリア 封印の剣||lit. "Faria: Sealed Sword"}}, is an [[action role-playing game]] (RPG) for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. It was developed by [[Game Arts]], published in Japan by Hi-Score in 1989, and published by Nexoft in North America in 1991.

== Story ==
The game begins with the protagonist, identified as a female soldier from a foreign country, waking up in an inn in the Kingdom of Faria. The soldier quickly learns that an evil being known as the Wizard has kidnapped the princess of Faria, and the king has offered the princess's hand in marriage to anyone able to rescue her. The soldier travels to the tower where the princess is held, defeats the monsters within, and returns the princess safely. The King laments the fact that the protagonist is a woman and cannot marry the princess, and decides to throw a party to celebrate the princess's return instead. It soon becomes apparent that the food given away by the king at the party was poisoned by a mysterious man, and the soldier has to travel to a faraway town to obtain medicine for the townspeople.

The soldier eventually obtains the cure and delivers it to the sick townspeople, only to discover that in her absence the king had been transformed into stone. The princess informs her that the only way to restore the king is to defeat the one who cast the spell, so the soldier sets out once again. After an arduous journey across the northern continent and a land set in the clouds, the Soldier reaches the town of Zellia where an old man informs her that the princess is an impostor. The Wizard kidnapped the princess, transformed himself into the princess's double, allowed himself to be "rescued" by the soldier, poisoned the townspeople, and turned the king to stone all in a bid to steal Faria's royal scrolls. The old man gives the soldier a Crystal of Truth so that she may enter the Phantom Tower, a tower projecting five identical fake images that confound anyone trying to enter. Using the crystal, the soldier manages to enter the real tower and destroy the monster within, discovering that it was guarding the real princess. The pair returns to confront the fake princess, where the Wizard sheds his disguise and attacks the soldier. The soldier defeats the Wizard, only for the Wizard to use the power of the royal scrolls to begin transferring his spirit into the body of a dragon.

Though his spirit escaped, the destruction of the Wizard's body lifts the curse on the king; additionally, in a flash of light the soldier is transformed into a man, revealing himself to be the prince of a frontier kingdom whose men had been turned into women by the Wizard. Before anyone can celebrate the lifting of the curses, the Wizard's spirit uses its power to block out the sun, shrouding the world in darkness. The prince sets out to kill the dragon before the Wizard's spirit is able to completely merge with it, passing through a series of icy caves that surround the Final Tower where the dragon's body resides. Discovering a legendary sword within the tower, the prince uses its power to defeat the dragon and seal the Wizard's spirit within the sword. Having restored the world, the prince returns to the king, who asks the prince to stay and offers the princess's hand in marriage. The prince declines, needing to return to his own country, but the princess asks to go with him and the king consents. The pair return to the prince's country together, and scenes from the protagonist's journey are shown as the game ends.

== Gameplay ==
Faria is an [[action role-playing game]] in which the player controls a sword-wielding hero, with a number of similarities to [[The Legend of Zelda (1986 video game)|The Legend of Zelda]].&lt;ref name=HG101&gt;Fenner, Robert (14 July 2015) {{cite web|title=Hardcore Gaming 101: Faria: A World of Mystery and Danger!|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/faria-a-world-of-mystery-and-danger/|website=Hardcore Gaming 101|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with many RPGs, the game is broken into towns, an overworld, and dungeons. Activities in town include talking to [[non-player character]]s to gather information and items, traversing the overworld involves combat that takes place on a separate battle screen, while dungeons consist of combat in the same window used to navigate and puzzling through increasingly complex mazes. Combat consists of moving the player character's sprite around the screen while swinging its equipped sword or using a handful of items including bombs and a bow &amp; arrows.&lt;ref name=HG101/&gt;

== Development ==
Faria was one of Game Arts' first RPGs, which the company would later become famous for through series such as [[Grandia (series)|Grandia]] and [[Lunar (series)|Lunar]].&lt;ref name=GB /&gt; The game was an early project for [[Takeshi Miyaji]], [[Asari Yoshito|Yoshito Asari]] designer for the Lunar games and director of the first two Grandia games,&lt;ref name=HG101 /&gt; and [[Akihiko Yoshida]], designer and illustrator on the first two [[Ogre Battle: The March of the Black Queen|Ogre Battle]] games and several [[Square (company)|Squaresoft]] properties.&lt;ref name=GB /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faria: A World of Mystery &amp; Danger!

==History==
[[File:Barefaced Chic Photo.JPG|thumb|left|(from left to right) [[Adèle Anderson]], [[Dillie Keane]] and Marilyn Cutts performing in ''Barefaced Chic!'' at the [[Lyric Hammersmith]].]]
Fascinating Aïda was founded in March 1983 by [[Dillie Keane]],&lt;ref name="BTG-DK"/&gt; along with Marilyn Cutts and Lizzie Richardson. The members have varied frequently, but the central two have been [[Adèle Anderson]] — who joined the group in 1984 — and Keane. The trio started performing in a [[West End of London|West End]] [[wine bar]], but they soon caught the attention of the media and performed on television for the first time in July 1983.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Over the years, they gained a growing fanbase and national popularity, earning three [[Laurence Olivier Award|Olivier Award]] nominations for ''[[Laurence Olivier Award for  Best Entertainment|Best Entertainment]]'', in 1995, 2000 and 2004. They were voted ''Most Popular Act 1985'' by [[City Limits (magazine)|City Limits]] magazine and also earned a [[if.comedy award|Perrier Comedy Award]] nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedyawards.co.uk/comedyshow.asp |title=Best comedy show |work=Foster's Edinburgh Comedy Awards |accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group broke up in 1989&lt;ref name="GBA-FA"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently reformed in 1994, and performed for a further ten years, releasing a number of albums, before breaking up again in 2004. Their 20th anniversary show, ''One Last Flutter'', ran from 13 November to 6 December 2003 at the [[Comedy Theatre]] in London, when original member Marilyn Cutts joined the group for one last time.&lt;ref name="CN371175"/&gt;&lt;ref name="COM-FA"&gt;

[[Liza Pulman]] joined in early 2004. That year, they performed their show ''Absolutely Fabulous'' twice in New York. First in June for the Brits Off-Broadway Festival, then from September to November at the Acorn Theatre, Manhattan.

The group wrote songs for radio and television programmes such as [[Stop The Week|Stop the Week]], After Hours, [[People Like Us (mockumentary)|People Like Us]] and [[TV-am]].&lt;ref name="CN371175"/&gt;
Some of their most famous songs include ''Shattered Illusions'', ''Herpes Tango'', ''Lieder'' and ''Taboo''.  They were the subject of several [[BBC]] documentaries. All the current members are also established actresses, mainly in musical theatre. Dillie Keane is also a writer, having written a column in ''[[The Stage]]'' magazine for ten years, and written two books, ''The Joy of Sequins'' in 1995 and ''Fascinating Who?'' in 1985. Keane says she now spends her time "juggling acting, cabaret and writing". The group have an official mascot—a pure bred [[Irish setter]] called "Dillie", born in 1999.

After the death in 2007 of the group's pianist and musical director, [[Russell Churney]],&lt;ref name="NYT040601"/&gt; plans for a new show were shelved. It was announced in early March 2008 that they would get together again for a short spell of concerts and possibly a brief tour to celebrate their 25th anniversary, and the show would include new songs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fascinating-aida.co.uk/faframe.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228012309/http://www.fascinating-aida.co.uk/faframe.htm |date=28 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=nathan@bluekitedesigns.com for Jermyn Street Theatre |url=http://www.jermynstreettheatre.co.uk/ |title=Jermyn Street Theatre, the official online home of London's leading Off-West-End venue |publisher=Jermynstreettheatre.co.uk |accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colekitchenn.com/ |title=COLE KITCHENN LTD – Producers – General Management – Personal Management |publisher=Colekitchenn.com |accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 they performed at the [[Jermyn Street Theatre]], followed by three nationwide tours.

'''''Guardians''''' ({{lang-ru|Защитники|''Zashchitniki''}}) is a 2017 Russian [[superhero film]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Todd|url=http://screenanarchy.com/2015/08/russia-gets-a-superhero-team-of-their-own-with-guardians.html |title=Russia gets a superhero team of their own with "Guardians" (Защитники)|publisher=[[Screen Anarchy]]|date=10 August 2015|accessdate=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by Russian-Armenian filmmaker [[Sarik Andreasyan]] and starring Sebastien Sisak, Anton Pampushnyy, Sanzhar Madiyev, Alina Lanina, Valeriya Shkirando and Stanislav Shirin.

The film tells about a team of Soviet [[superhero]]es created during the [[Cold War]]. The team includes representatives of the different nationalities of the [[USSR]]. Each of the protagonists' superpowers reflect the strengths and traditions of the people of the USSR.

''Guardians'' was met with strongly negative critical reception in Russian media.&lt;ref name="kritik"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kritikanstvo.ru/movies/zashhitniki/|title=Рецензии на фильм Защитники / Zashchitniki (2017), отзывы|website=Критиканство|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie debuted at the top of Russian box office; however its gross quickly dropped,&lt;ref name="2week"&gt;[http://www.kinobusiness.com/news/kassovye-sbory-v-rossii-i-sng-za-uik-end-2-5-marta-2017/ Кассовые сборы в России и СНГ за уик-энд 2 – 5 марта, 2017] - Новости | Кинопортал Кинобизнес сегодня&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Guardians'' is believed to be a [[box office bomb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://esquire.ru/russian-defenders|title="Защитники": история одного провала|publisher=|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was released by Shout Factory on DVD in the USA on September 5, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.screamhorrormag.com/shout-factory-bringing-russian-superhero-flick-guardians-disc/|title=Shout Factory Bringing Russian Superhero Flick Guardians to Disc - THE HORROR ENTERTAINMENT MAGAZINE|date=2017-06-28|work=THE HORROR ENTERTAINMENT MAGAZINE|access-date=2017-07-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
During the [[Cold War]], a secret organization known as "Patriot" gathers a team of Soviet [[superhero]]es, altering and augmenting the DNA of many selected individuals throughout the former state's territory, in order to defend the homeland from superhuman threats. The team includes representatives of the different nationalities of the [[Soviet Union]] and allegedly implies restoration of former USSR. Arseniy, codenamed Ursus ([[Anton Pampushny]]), can change into a huge, incredible strong bear-man. Temirkhan, codenamed Khan ([[Sanjar Madi]]), has super-speed and wields a pair of curved swords. Lernik, codenamed Ler ([[Sebastien Sisak]]), has the ability to control earth and stone. Finally, Xenia ([[Alina Lanina]]) has the power of invisibility and can transform her body into water. 

The program succeeds where a second program called Module-1 fails. This prompts Professor August Kuratov (Stanislav Shirin), creator of Module-1, to flee to the remote wilderness, away from Soviet authorities, to continue working on his experiments. When the military is summoned to arrest him, he bombs the Patriot laboratory, surviving because he was covered with some chemicals. He rebuilds his damaged body making himself into a [[cyborg]]. This gives him the power to generate electricity and control machines. He also created an army of clones of himself, and sets out to prove to the world that he is a genius. After the explosion, Arsus, Ler, Khan, and Xenia go into hiding for years.

In the present day, several walking robots used in a training exercise turn against their supervising officials and kill them. This leads to the [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Ministry of Defence]] holding a meeting and deciding to revive the Patriot organization under the leadership of Major Elena Larina (Valeriya Shkirando) and to locate their missing super agents. She finds Ler spending his time meditating in the [[Khor Virap]] Monastery in [[Armenia]]; Khan living on the steppes of [[Kazakhstan]]; Ursus in a remote cabin on the [[Putorana Plateau]] in northern [[Siberia]]; and Xenia performing stunts in a circus in Moscow. Their first task is to raid Kuratov's laboratory within an old factory, but they are captured.

Kuratov offers the Guardians a chance to join him but they refuse. This angers him and he keeps three of them trapped within a magnetic force field and injures Ler. He later goes to a military facility at [[Noginsk]] to take control of the tanks and other vehicles stationed there. Using them, he launches an invasion of Moscow and makes preparations to use the [[Ostankino Tower]] and the [[Federation Tower]] for his Module-2 Projec. He intends to transmit a signal through an old Soviet satellite, which will then be sent to every other satellite orbiting Earth, and use it to seize control of all technology in the world. He uses a force field to protect his beacon-tower and destroy several jet fighters that are sent to stop him. When a collaborator within the Russian military, Major-General Nikolai Dolgov, asks Kuratov for a reward for his help, Kuratov strangles him to death.

While Ler recovers, he reflects on the fact that his superhuman abilities prevent him from aging normally. He has stayed the same age while his wife and grandchildren have grown older and passed away. At the meantime, Major Elena frees the other team members from Kuratov's laboratory. She sends Kuratov's former rival to study one of Kuratov's clones. Unfortunately the real Kuratov releases poison gas to kill him. Arsus and the other Guardians are trained in the Patriots' facility and are given suits and weapons.

The Guardians go to Moscow: Xenia and Ursus advance through the streets, Ler defeats several soldiers patrolling an underground car park, and Khan uses an airplane to try to fly above Kuratov's force field. The three Guardians enter a shopping mall, and cross an iron bar linking it to the tower-beacon, but are attacked by more of Kuratov's troops. Khan jumps from the airplane and slices the pipe, causing Kuratov's troops to fall.

While the other Guardians figure out a way to destroy the power source for Kuratov's beacon, Xenia touches the power source and injures herself, temporarily disabling the beacon's transmissions and causing the force field to collapse. The Guardians battle Kuratov on the platform, but fail to defeat and kill him. As the guardians leave on a grappling rope hanging from an airplane, Kuratov's beacon interferes with the plane's controls. Khan cuts the grappling rope linking them to the falling airplane and they land to a river.

As they swim to a road, they consider going back to Kuratov's beacon to destroy it and kill Kuratov, but Major Elena arrives and commands them not to. She tells them that as superhumans, they can also pool their energy and release it as a blast, but doing so can be fatal. The Guardians touch each other and generate a blast of energy that damages Kuratov's tower, causing Kuratov to fall to his death. Major Elena says that, while Kuratov boasted that he created the Guardians, they really created themselves.

The Guardians recover, rendezvousing with Major Elena on a bridge in the rebuilt Moscow. Although they choose to go back to their normal lives, they also consider continuing their service to the Patriot organization. In a post-credits scene, Elena is seen attacking a soldier after his truck stops. When she questions the soldier, he tells her that "Ferrum" has sent him as part of an unspecified mission.

==Cast==
* Sebastien Sisak as Ler (լեռ, [[Armenian language|Armenian]] for "mountain"; found in [[Khor Virap]] Monastery, [[Armenia]]).
:Landman.  He is armed with earth manipulation abilities, and is able to control and levitate rocks, dust and soil in his vicinity, or cause them to orbit him.  He can even summon rock onto his body, covering himself in rock to make an exoskeletal armor to physically enhance himself. Along with his abilities, he is armed with a small chain with a large rock cemented on its end, which he can use as a type of flail. Like the rest of the team, he was given a special costume to increase his effectiveness and abilities, as well as an extendable chain of rocks linked together by electric-like energy that can be manipulated by him and used as a whip or be curled into a shield. Ler became a hermit after his family died of old age (his wife, daughter and even grandchildren); meanwhile he remained youthful due to his superpowers.
* Anton Pampushnyy as Ursus (found in [[Putorana Plateau]], northern [[Siberia]])
:Wildman.  Ursus (Latin for bear) is a type of [[berserker]] or [[werebear]], and has the [[Therianthropy|ability to transform himself into a large bear]], though he can control how much of his body is transformed and can transform partially if he wills it. This transformation ability can allow him to seamlessly alter his size, bulk and musculature and transform himself into a burly humanoid, as well as use his transformations to physically augment his physical abilities, resulting in his having superhuman strength and bulletproof durability. He has multiple phases of transformation due to his ability to partially transform. His phases can make him physically a hybrid between bear and human, such as giving him the head, paws and bulk of a bear while keeping the shape of a man.  He can use his superhuman physicality to fight, especially when he is in full bear form. With this, no normal person can physically overpower him, and he is immune to their strength. Desperate, loyal and determined, he is known for his drive to "break the enemy into small pieces". Like the rest of the team, he was given a special costume to increase his effectiveness and abilities. Part of this costume's equipment is a hand-held mini-gun and its battery pack, both of which are harnessed to his torso for battle, while he carries them on his back when fully transformed. Even while not transformed, he is shown to be strong enough to wield the large weapon and its power source. Ursus fears losing control of his powers and someday transforming into a bear without being able to return to human form.
* Sanzhar Madiyev as Khan (found in southern [[Kazakhstan]])
:Windman.  Masterfully skilled with all kinds of blades, as well as with many kinds of martial arts. Along with other blades, he is primarily armed with twin, crescent like blades, each of which resemble a [[scimitar]], [[scythe]] or sickle and can be joined at the hilts to form a double bladed weapon. His strong blades can slice through the metal of cars with enough force and without going blunt or being damaged. He is also physically augmented, possessing a degree of superhuman strength that allows him to smash through brick walls with a single punch and send men flying through the air with his attacks, as well as superhuman mobility that gives him acrobatic and gymnastic capabilities and the ability to effortlessly dodge and evade attacks, even gunfire at point-blank range. He also possesses inhuman speed, enough that he almost appears to teleport. Using his speed requires him first to focus hard, achieving a meditative state that causes his eyes to turn completely white and allowing him to perceive faster than any human can. While in this state, he sees everything as being in slow motion while he, himself, moves at normal speed, or somewhat faster. Whenever he moves in this state, a black gaseous trail appears behind him to outline his movements. His strength and speed allows him to generate enough force to slice a car and anyone in it in two with his blades. Like the rest of the team, he was given a special costume to increase his effectiveness and abilities, as well as a grappling line mounted on his wrist. He volunteered for the Patriot proyect because he wanted to be "invincible" and stop living out of the shadow of his sister (who was a better martial artist), but after gaining his powers he lost his temper during combat with his sister, killing her.
* Alina Lanina as Xenia (found in [[Moscow]])
:Waterwoman. A skilled acrobat, gymnast, and martial artist, She has the ability to move on water as if it were solid ground, as well as to seamlessly floating through it as it if were air. This gives her higher mobility in water compared to the fastest, or most maneuverable sea creature. She cannot feel temperature differences and can survive in an airless vacuum, which allows her to survive underwater without any negative effects. She can also transform her body into a clear, transparent liquid, which allows her to become gelatinous and viscous, allowing her to flow like liquid, while being able to physical touch and interact at the same time. In this form, her body becomes silhouetted and nearly featureless, with her hair disappearing and the only features on her being her the shape of her ears and nose.  She can even use this form to become invisible, while she also wears a special costume designed also become invisible with her and allow her to project her invisibility onto objects or people that she touches. She has amnesia and don't remenber anything prior 1978, so at first she don't recognises Lar, Khan and Ursus when they contact her.
* Valeriya Shkirando as Major Elena Larina, the head of the secret organization, codenamed "Patriot".
* [[Vyacheslav Razbegaev]] as Major-general Nikolai Dolgov. He gives Major Larina the order to assemble the Guardians but is a ploy of Kuratov, who wants them in his side. Kuratov kills him after he is no longer useful to his plans.
* Stanislav Shirin as August Kuratov.
: Main antagonist. Owns a machine named "Module-1" which allows him to control any technical equipment by generating electric-like energy. This mechanized exoframe-like harness enhances his physical abilities to the point where he can overpower physically superhuman opponents, such as Khan, a fully transformed Arsus or Ler/Landman, while the latter is using his rock exoskeleton. Kuratov decides to build his own army of clones in order to capture Moscow, in preparation to control the whole world. He later attempts to use the [[Ostankino Tower]] and the [[Federation Tower]] as a beacon to transmit his commands to an old Soviet nuclear satellite, and use it to control every other satellite orbiting the Earth and thus control all technology.

==Reception==
The reception of ''Guardians'' was overwhelmingly negative. The film was almost universally panned in Russian media,&lt;ref name="kritik"/&gt; such as [[Meduza]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://meduza.io/feature/2017/02/23/filmy-na-nedelyu-patrioticheskie-i-uzhasayuschie-zaschitniki-a-takzhe-dzheki-toni-erdmann-i-slishkom-svobodnyy-chelovek|title=Фильмы на неделю: патриотические (и ужасающие) "Защитники", а также "Джеки", "Тони Эрдманн" и "Слишком свободный человек" — Meduza|publisher=|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Afisha]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://daily.afisha.ru/cinema/4639-zaschitniki-nash-otvet-govardu-utke/|title="Защитники" Сарика Андреасяна: наш ответ Говарду-утке|publisher=|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rg.ru/2017/02/24/zashchitniki-sarika-andreasiana-naskolko-eto-ploho.html|title="Защитники" Сарика Андреасяна: насколько это плохо|website=Российская газета|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mir Fantastiki]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mirf.ru/kino/zaschitniki|title="Защитники" — идиотическая четвёрка - Кино - Мир фантастики|date=24 February 2017|publisher=|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others. It was mainly criticized for having a derivative plot, bad acting and direction, cheap CGI, [[plot holes]] and overall low quality. Critics outside Russia were only slightly kinder to ''Guardians''; however, the reviews in [[Times of India]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/english/movie-reviews/guardians-the-superheroes/movie-review/57296789.cms|title=Guardians - The Superheroes Review {2/5}: Stay home and do a Marvel marathon instead|website=The Times of India|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birth Movies Death&lt;ref&gt;[http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2017/03/02/guardians-review-russias-underwhelming-avengers GUARDIANS Review: Russia’s Underwhelming Avengers] | Birth.Movies.Death.&lt;/ref&gt; and Mid-Day.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/guardians-the-superheroes-movie-review-hollywood-news/18023191|title='Guardians: The Superheroes' - Movie Review|publisher=|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; were negative.

In July 2017, [[Enjoy Movies]], the production company behind ''Guardians'', filed for [[bankruptcy]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kinopoisk.ru/news/2989167/ Компания Enjoy Movies приготовилась признать себя банкротом — новости на КиноПоиске]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Cinema Foundation of Russia]], which provided part of the budget, sued the company, demanding return of the investment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lenta.ru/news/2017/07/05/zashitniki/ Фонд кино потребовал 51 миллион рублей у продюсеров «Защитников»: Кино: Культура: Lenta.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible sequel==
Initially, long before the premiere of the original film and in case of success, a sequel was announced, in which it was supposed to add another superhero from China&lt;ref&gt;In the continuation of the film "Guardians" may appear [https://ria.ru/culture/20160531/1441227013.html Chinese superhero]&lt;/ref&gt;. Prior to this, the release date of the second part has not yet been announced. Later a sequel, ''Guardians 2'', has been approved, with Turbo Films, the Chinese distributor of the first film, as a co-production company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/russian-superhero-film-china-release-868671|title= Russian Cold War Superhero Film to Get China Release Under Import Quota|first= Vladimir|last= Kozlov|date= February 23, 2016|accessdate= February 26, 2016|work= [[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will reportedly be partially shot in China and have some Chinese characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chinafilminsider.com/china-russia-team-take-avengers-communist-superheroes/|title= China, Russia Team up to Take on ‘The Avengers’ with Communist Superheroes.|first= Fergus|last= Ryan|date= January 16, 2017|accessdate= January 17, 2017|work= China Film Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the failure of the box office and negative reviews of the film and the declaration of bankruptcy "Enjoy Movies", the director of the first part of the film, Sarik Andreasyan said that the continuation will still be, stating also that with their team they are discussing "Who from the superheroes will die" &lt;ref&gt;[https://shazoo.ru/2017/06/29/53712/sarik-andreasyan-i-komanda-obsuzhdayut-sikvel-zashitnikov Sarik Andreasyan and the team are discussing the sequel to the "Guardians"]&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the film will also be filmed in conjunction with the “Big Cinema”, also founded by the brothers Andreasyans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sub-cult.ru/kino/novosti-kino/8132-andreasyan-bolshoe-kino Andreasyans brothers will do only "Big cinema"]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, 2018, in an interview with the CINEMA HOUSE, Sarik replied that he was unlikely to make a sequel, and even if it came out, someone else would probably make it, but without his participation&lt;ref name="Защитники_2_без_Сарика_Андреасяна"&gt;[https://www.domkino.tv/news/11524 Сарик Андреасян – Нагиев, Непрощенный и продолжение Защитников]&lt;/ref&gt;. "I think not. Well, even if we create it, then without me! You see, the thing is, when we created this film, it seemed to us that “Wow, this is so cool! We compose our superheroes, here they do not exist in reality, but we will compose them and people will get used to them! ”But this turned out to be not the right approach. Because here [[Last Knight (film)|Last Knight]] came out and .. well, it’s as if I became very cash because it’s very important to have some kind of cultural code! Here Bogatyr is a cultural code, [[Baba Yaga]] is a cultural code. All grew up on this, everyone takes their children there with great pleasure. No one there would have led his child to the Guardians because he knows nothing about it. No matter how much you advertise it, it’s too hard. That's when the French make [[Asterix|Asterix and Obelix]] ... They were these comics back in the forties. And how would it be clear why this is accepted because several generations have grown on it. That is, in theory, how could you probably create the three parts of the Guardians and in ten or fifteen years suddenly ... Well, how would it be part of some kind of culture, but you know, this is not a charity. So why torture yourself like that? And what is it .. Well, today there would still be an opportunity to do it, you probably would be looking for something inherent in literature or in fairy tales. Well, that is, they would try to do it, but still something that is what the heart is pouring. When you, for example, do not have to re-understand it because, for example, Americans have seen [[Superman]] fifteen years ago and [[Batman]] and in the early nineties, that is, they put our viewers on a comic strip for a long time. So the first successful comic was only in 2010 or 2011 in Russia, which began to earn, that is, the first [[X-Men]], which came out in 2002 or in 2003. There were no spectators because they did not understand “Why do we have to watch this?” And in a year .. That is, for example, twenty years have passed and therefore we simply do not have such a time! That's all!&lt;ref name="Защитники_2_без_Сарика_Андреасяна" /&gt;"

== Comics book ==
Simultaneously with the film, a [[Guardians (comics)|comics book]] was published, which was a prequel of the film.&lt;ref&gt;Elena Yakovleva, [http://www.aif.ru/culture/freeway/lenin_evtushenko_i_supergeroi_gid_po_meropriyatiyam_biblionochi-2017 Lenin, Yevtushenko and Superheroes.

Ross" in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in the 1930s and later collected in two books, ''The Education of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N'' and ''The Return of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N''.&lt;ref name=rubin&gt;

Rosten noted that he was frequently asked if Mr Kaplan was his [[alter ego]], and that he often felt it was the other way around.

The first collection (''Education'', 1937) was a "close second" for one U.S. [[National Book Award]] [[List of winners of the National Book Award#1935 to 1941|in 1938]].&lt;ref name=nyt1938&gt;

Curie' Gets Non-Fiction Award TWO OTHERS WIN HONORS Fadiman Is 'Not Interested' in What Pulitzer Committee Thinks of Selections", ''The New York Times'', p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;
For 1937 the [[American Booksellers Association]] gave awards in four categories, of which ''Hyman Kaplan'' may have been a contender for the Fiction, the Bookseller Discovery, or the Most Original Book, most likely the latter (not the Nonfiction award). Next-day coverage by ''The New York Times'' named the four Awards and their winners first, of course, and later named the four "close seconds" in order that cannot match. The Most Original Book and ''The Education of Hyman Kaplan'' were both fourth on their respective lists.&lt;/ref&gt;
The second collection (''Return'', 1959) was one of eighteen [[National Book Award for Fiction]] finalists in 1960.&lt;ref name=nba1960&gt;[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1960 "National Book Awards – 1960"]. NBF. Retrieved 2012-04-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosten rewrote the two books as one, with many changes, published as ''O K*A*P*L*A*N! My K*A*P*L*A*N!'' in 1976.

The books were [[theatrical adaptation|adapted as a]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] play produced in 1968, namely ''[[The Education of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N]]''.&lt;ref name=ibd&gt;

==Hyman Kaplan==

Mr Kaplan is an immigrant and a pupil at a New York night class in English. He is extremely diligent and enthusiastic, but seems completely incapable of learning: the teacher, Mr Parkhill, is eventually driven to conclude that, although Mr Kaplan admits that English has rules – "good rules, sensible rules" – he is quite unable to admit that the rules apply to ''him.'' (In ''The Return of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N'', Kaplan's English pronunciation has improved substantially between semesters.)

Mr Kaplan is extroverted and highly assertive, particularly when his moral sense has been outraged by some perceived injustice in class or in American history, and he frequently gets into noisy disagreements with other members of the class.

Mr Kaplan usually signs his name in colored crayon with green stars between red letters outlined in blue.&lt;ref name=vangelder&gt;
{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1937/08/29/archives/a-mr-malaprop-in-the-bronx-idiom-the-education-of-hyman-kaplan-by.html|publisher=''The New York Times''|title=A Mr. Malaprop in the Bronx Idiom|author=Robert van Gelder|date=August 29, 1937|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the last story of all, "Mr K*A*P*L*A*N the Eumoirous", he signs a note to his teacher simply "Hyman Kaplan", but addresses it to "Mr P*A*R*K*H*I*L*L". Mr Parkhill wonders if he will ever again be so honored.

Mr Kaplan was born in [[Kiev]], has lived in America for fifteen years, and claims (on [[Columbus Day]]) that his birthday is October 12. From his pronunciation of English (the characters' various idioms are a major source of the stories' humor), it appears that Mr Kaplan's native language is [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]. This would seem to be confirmed when Kaplan calls flowers "bloomers", and a fellow student reminds him not to mix up two languages, leading the teacher to reflect that Mr Kaplan's native language refers to flowers as ''blumen''.

== The teacher ==

'''Mr Parkhill''' is the point-of-view character in the stories, a staid, kind-hearted, mild-mannered teacher with a tendency to think of his pupils in terms of classical literature. Mr Parkhill is rigorously fair-minded, often to his own detriment when faced with Mr Kaplan's very individual brand of logic. He is also a lonely and rather tragic character: when the class present him with a new briefcase with the initials "M.P." on it as a birthday present, he is at first puzzled since his first name does not begin with M; then realizes that the letters stand for "Mr Parkhill" and that he cannot remember the last time anyone addressed him by his first name.

== Other members of the class ==

*'''Mr Norman Bloom''' (in the first book) and '''Mr Reuben Plonsky''' (in the second book; renamed Olansky in the combined version), both of whom are better than Mr Kaplan at grasping the rules of English, but who somehow end up on the losing side of the arguments that erupt between them.
*'''Miss Rose Mitnick''', a quiet, shy young woman whose grasp of English is almost perfect, but who generally withers before the force of Mr Kaplan's rhetorical passion. Eventually she starts a relationship with the ebullient '''Nathan P. Nathan'''.
*'''Mrs Sadie Moskowitz''', characterized by Mr Parkhill as "the [[Niobe]] of the beginners' grade", a large, lugubrious middle-aged lady who is baffled by the English language and spends much of the time asleep, waking only to punctuate a particularly intimidating fact with a despairing exclamation of "Oy!"
*'''Miss Olga Tarnova''', an emotional old Russian woman, a retired ballerina who recalls the Imperial days with nostalgia and despises Communism. Her compositions often deal either with her former life or with her interest in [[Spiritualism]].
*'''Mr Sam Pinsky''', a loyal ally of Mr Kaplan.
*'''Miss Carmen Caravello''', an Italian woman prone to loud disagreement with Mr Kaplan.
*'''Gus Matsoukas''', the only Greek in the class, whose dogged pursuit of English is accompanied by near-constant muttering to himself. His one moment of enthusiasm comes when Mr Parkhill begins pointing out how many English words have Greek roots. He eventually returns to Greece.

{{About|the sketch revue |the book|Settling Accounts: In at the Death}}

'''''In At The Death''''' was a sketch revue performed at The Bush Theatre, London in 1978, most notable for being the first time that future colleagues [[Victoria Wood]] and [[Julie Walters]] would work together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The show is described in Neil Brandwood's biography of Wood as an "alternative theatre company's sketch show about mortality."

After being impressed by Wood's songwriting skills, director Dusty Hughes invited her to be part of a six strong writing team. The topicality of the review was also deemed suitable for her, as she'd just finished writing weekly topical songs on the [[BBC1]] consumer show ''[[That's Life!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers included were [[Ken Campbell]], [[Snoo Wilson]], Ken Hutchinson and Nigel Baldwin. They were asked to write short items based on the weeks newspapers around the theme of death. Campbell took stories from the ''Malaysian New Strait Times'', Baldwin the ''Holyhead and Anglesey Chronicle'', but to be more accessible, Wood drew her inspiration strictly from the tabloids.

Wood wrote six items in the first half of the show, including a requiem for [[Guy the Gorilla]], a song about 'battered wives' (inspired by an article in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' about domestic violence). A song called 'Road Blocks' about a motorcycle accident, and a melancholy number titled '[http://www2.prestel.co.uk/cello/LoveSong.htm Love Song]'. The second half featured a sketch by Wood called 'Dear Mum', about a middle classed woman who refuses to visit her mother in hospital, and also a harrowing song titled 'Abortion.'&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In the cast was Julie Walters. Having only met Wood briefly eight years before, the two hit it off immediately. Wood also performed in the show, but said later "There was a sketch set in Belfast and I couldn’t do the accent, so they made me a deaf mute." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.prestel.co.uk/cello/LoveSong.htm Love Song/Victoria_Wood.asp|title=Love Song introduction by Victoria Wood|publisher=Robert England|date=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood received much critical acclaim for her work on the show though. The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' said her songs "successfully blend a gallows humour with an unexpected touch of humanity", and [[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] wrote "Victoria Wood's musical epigrams brilliantly embroider the action".

The revue was initially too short, and making up the shortfall, Wood discovered a new talent, writing comedy sketches. The sketch 'Sex' was set in a [[Manchester]] library and starred Walters as a teenage girl who thinks she's pregnant asking Alison Fiske (as the librarian) advice. As almost the only comedy in the show, it came as a welcome relief to the audience and went down extremely well. During the writing process, Wood said she discovered her true voice. "It was the first thing I'd written with proper jokes and I thought "aha!" I'd suddenly found something I could do. It was a blinding flash, like learning a new language." ''[[The Times]]'' said of the sketch that she was a "great discovery" who "got more poetry out of Manchester speech than I had heard for years".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The cast also included Godfrey Jackman, [[Philip Jackson (actor)|Philip Jackson]] and [[Clive Merrison]]. The production ran from 13 July to 6 August 1978.

Due to Wood's acclaim, then theatre director [[David Leland]] commissioned her first play ''[[Talent (1978 play)|Talent]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9379">'' '''Irène''' '' is a tragedy in five acts by [[Voltaire]], and his penultimate play. It was written in 1776-1777 and premiered in Paris on March 16, 1778.&lt;ref name="Trousson2015"/&gt;

==Composition==
[[File:Voltaire Irene Edition Originale Paris 1779.jpg|thumb|Original Edition of Voltaire's Irène, Paris 1779]]
[[File:Couronnement de Voltaire.jpg|thumb|The crowning of Voltaire’s bust after the sixth performance of Irène, 30 March 1778]]
[[File:Moreau Voltaire Irene.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jean-Michel Moreau]]: Illustration of Irène, 1786]]
Recent scholarship has suggested that the original inspiration for the story, though not its setting, was an account of the death of a young woman in China who prayed for death rather than betrayal of her faith. At the time he was working on the early versions of the play, Voltaire was reading ''Mémoires concernant l’histoire, les sciences, les arts, les mœurs, les usages, etc., des Chinois'' by the [[Jesuit]] priest [[Jean Joseph Marie Amiot]] and corresponding with [[d'Alembert]] and [[Diderot]] about what he read. The theme of a woman who chooses death before disloyalty is also classically [[Confucian]].&lt;ref name="Hua Meng"/&gt; 

The play was written as part of Voltaire’s plan to make a triumphal return to Paris after having spent nearly twenty years in self-imposed exile in [[Ferney-Voltaire|Ferney]]. He wished to end his life with a great theatrical success that would secure his position for posterity and prevent his enemies from taking any action against him. He therefore set about writing a classical tragedy that would affirm his reputation and enable his return to the centre of French cultural life.&lt;ref name="Pearson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger Pearson|title=Voltaire Almighty: A Life in Pursuit of Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FbklD47SK1UC&amp;pg=PT336|date=15 December 2010|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4088-2080-3|pages=336–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

To this end, in the early part of 1777, Voltaire was working on two plays at the same time; one was ''Irène'' and the other was ''[[Agathocle]]''.&lt;ref name="WS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Agathocle |url=https://fr.m.wikisource.org/wiki/Agathocle |last=Moland |first=Louis |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1877 |publisher=Garnier |page=389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondence with his friend [[Charles-Augustin de Ferriol d'Argental|d'Argental]] indicated that he was initially unsure which would be more successful; he gradually came to consider that ''Irène'' would work better on stage, and it was indeed ''Irène'' that was rehearsed and performed while he was alive.&lt;ref name="WS"/&gt; Having previously sent him the manuscript of ''Agathocle'', he wrote to d'Argental on 25 October ‘I'm sending you something (''Irène'') more passionate, more theatrical, and more interesting.'&lt;ref name="Trousson2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond Trousson|title=Voltaire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VLtSCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT499|date=2015|publisher=Tallandier|isbn=979-10-210-0908-0|page=499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original working title for ''Irène'' was ''Alexis Comnène'' and it was only in a later revision that the title and the focus of the plot was changed to the heroine. The action is very loosely based in the historical setting of the overthrowing of the Byzantine emperor [[Nikephoros III Botaneiates]] by [[Alexios I Komnenos]] in the year 1081.&lt;ref name="Pearson2010"/&gt;

Voltaire also wrote a letter to the [[Académie Française]], which he prefaced to the tragedy. In this letter he emphasized the independence and importance of French poetry in relation to the English tradition in the wake of [[Shakespeare]], referring to a debate launched by [[Louis-Sébastien Mercier]] and [[Michel-Jean Sedaine]].

==Action==
Irène, compelled by her family to marry Nicéphore, Emperor of Constantinople, loves the prince Alexis. Alexis, returning victorious from campaign to Constantinople against the will of the Emperor, wishes to declare his love to Irène, but Nicéphore orders him to leave the city. Alexis refuses, so the Emperor orders his arrest and execution. Warned by his attaché Memnon, Alexis and his army confront the emperor. Defeated by Alexis but spared, Nicéphore is killed by the people. Alexis ascends the throne. As a widow, Irène is then obliged to enter a convent by her father Léonce. Irène renounces her love for Alexis at her father’s insistence. Furious that Léonce will deprive him of his love, Alexis puts the father in chains. Irène appeals for his release and then kills herself, unable to reconcile the claims of love and duty.&lt;ref name="gens-de-lettres..1778"&gt;{{cite book|author=Une Société de gens-de-lettres..|title=L'Esprit des journaux franc̜ais et étrangers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ng9cAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA293|year=1778|publisher=Valade|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voltaire himself remarked that people might think the play a comedy because 'people may laugh at a woman who takes her own life rather than sleep with the man who has conquered and murdered her husband, when she doesn't love the husband and absolutely adores the murderer.'&lt;ref name="Pearson2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aldridge2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred Owen Aldridge|title=Voltaire and the Century of Light|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bEl9BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA401|date=8 March 2015|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-6695-3|page=401}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also commented that "I had great hopes when beginning the work, but at the end I see nothing but ridicule... nothing can undo the failings of a subject which does not exist in nature.'&lt;ref name="Hua Meng"&gt;{{cite book |title=Le Bonheur de la littérature.

The play was read through at Ferney on 23 October and first performed at Voltaire's private house theatre there for the wedding of the two of Voltaire's friends and protégés, the [[Charles, marquis de Villette|Marquis de Villette]] and [[Reine Philiberte de Varicourt]].&lt;ref name="Trousson2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrews1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wayne Andrews|title=Voltaire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gm6ADMDnXfoC&amp;pg=PA145|year=1981|publisher=New Directions Publishing|isbn=978-0-8112-0802-4|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its public premiere was on March 16, 1778 at the [[Comédie-Française]].  The cast was Vanhove (Nicéphore); (fr) [[:fr:François-René Molé|Molé]] (Alexis Comnène); (fr) [[:fr:Brizard (acteur)|Brizard]] (Léonce); [[Jacques Marie Boutet|Monvel]] (Memnon); Dusaulx (officier); Mme Vestris (Irène); Mlle Saint-Val cadette (Zoé).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Irène |url=http://lagrange.comedie-francaise.fr/notice?ref=00003818&amp;p=1 |website=lagrange.comedie-francaise.fr |publisher=Comédie Française |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary reception==
Voltaire's appearance in Paris caused immense public excitement; he was hailed wherever he went and the success of his play was more a tribute to his public standing than to its artistic merits. The dress rehearsal on 14 March 1778 indicated that the play would not fail.&lt;ref name="Andrews1981"/&gt; The play opened on 16 March in the presence of [[Marie Antoinette]], though Voltaire was too ill to attend; messengers were dispatched to him at the end of each act to report the audience's reception.&lt;ref name="Carlson"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marvin A. Carlson|title=Voltaire and the Theatre of the Eighteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OoIaRFoCG-4C&amp;pg=PA152|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30302-9|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the sixth performance of the play on 21 March, the king's brother [[Charles X of France|the comte d'Artois]] sent the captain of his guards to congratulate Voltaire, who then attended the performance in person. The audience shouted demands for him to be crowned, upon which one of the actors placed a wreath of laurels on his head. 'My God! Do you want to kill me with glory?' he exclaimed, weeping tears of joy.&lt;ref name="Andrews1981"/&gt; The play was performed twice that evening, and the actors then inaugurated a bust of Voltaire in the theatre, which they also crowned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Hall Standish|title=The Life of Voltaire: With Interesting Particulars Respecting His Death, and Anecdotes and Characters of His Contemporaries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TzhBAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA373|year=1821|publisher=J. Andrews|page=373}}&lt;/ref&gt; After six further performances the play was taken off the stage.

==Printed versions==
''Irène'' was printed posthumously in Paris in 1779, with another imprint in Lausanne. In neither case is the name of the printer known.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2869">'''KC2XAK''' was the world's first [[Ultra High Frequency|UHF]] television station. It was simply a [[rebroadcaster|rebroadcast]]/[[broadcast translator]] [[transmitter]] of [[New York City, New York|New York City's]] WNBT (today’s [[WNBC]]), and broadcast on 529-535 MHz in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]]. It went on the air on December 29, 1949.

The station's launch was code-named "'''Operation Bridgeport'''", as a test by [[RCA]] and [[NBC]], to determine if the UHF spectrum was feasible to use for communications and broadcasting.

The station used a 1&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter with a 20-dB [[antenna gain|gain antenna]] on a {{convert|210|ft|m|sing=on}} tower elevated {{convert|450|ft|m}} above average terrain. This resulted in an [[Effective Radiated Power]] of 10&amp;nbsp;kW.

'''Operation Bridgeport''' was apparently a success, but was shut down by RCA and NBC on August 23, 1952, after two and a half years of operation. [[Empire Coil]] purchased the KC2XAK transmitter, and the transmitter and support equipment was dismantled in Bridgeport under supervision of RCA. Dismantling began on August 25, and was shipped via truck and fast [[freight train]] to [[Portland, Oregon]]. It was re-assembled as a {{convert|250|ft|m|sing=on}} tower on Council Crest, more than {{convert|1000|ft|m}} above Portland on September 9, 1952. This became a transmitter for Portland's [[KPTV]] as well being the first commercial UHF television station in the country.

Although KC2XAK was the first UHF station on the air, it was an experimental station. The first full-fledged UHF commercial [[television station]] honor goes to [[KPTV]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], which broadcast on UHF Channel 27 in 1952, although it has operated on VHF Channel 12 since 1957.

Bridgeport is now covered [[terrestial television|over-the-air]] by WNBC, and the other [[Template:NYC TV|New York City broadcast stations]].

In each match, two teams compete. Each team consists of five humans and five elephants. There is no monetary prize.

'''Sven Lennart Green''' (born 25 December 1941) is a Swedish world champion close-up/card [[magic (illusion)|magician]], a title which he won in 1991 at the [[FISM]] convention in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fism.org/web/championship-contests/fism-winners/fism-winners-1991-to-1997/ |title=World Championship of Magic – Winners 1991 to 1997 |publisher=FISM |date= |accessdate=2013-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his seemingly chaotic routines which, in spite of first appearances, display great skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elusionist.com/audio/Lennart-Preview.wmv |title=Informal video of Green performing |date= |accessdate=2013-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; His original techniques and presentation style form an unorthodox and innovative contribution to [[sleight of hand]] magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/19002/ |title=Lennart Green and the Modern Drama of Sleight of Hand |date= |accessdate=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green began practicing magic at the age of 18&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyaxK3HXQJ0&lt;/ref&gt;. Green competed at the 1988 [[FISM]] convention in [[The Hague]], Netherlands, and was erroneously disqualified because the judges believed he had used [[shill|stooges]] in his act to shuffle the cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.geniimagazine.com/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=210405 |title=Lennert Green Biography (translated and posted here) |publisher=Geniimagazine.com |date=1941-12-25 |accessdate=2013-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, he performed the same act but insisted that the judges themselves shuffle the cards to prove that he used no stooges. The judges then awarded him first place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://93.97.176.48/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=63&amp;lang=en FISM History Part 6&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green has appeared on the fourth [[The World's Greatest Magic|World's Greatest Magic]] [[television]] special. He lives in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden, and lectures internationally.

He appeared at [[TED (conference)|TED]] in February 2005, where he performed his signature card routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/lennart_green_does_close_up_card_magic.html |title=TED Talks: Lennart Green does close-up card magic |publisher=Ted.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Privately, Green has worked 7 years as a doctor in Sweden&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyaxK3HXQJ0&lt;/ref&gt;.
In 2014 Green suffered a stroke that prevented him from performing lectures in the following months. He has since fully recovered&lt;ref&gt;http://www.m.geniimagazine.com/viewtopic.php?t=44861&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''London Calling!''''' was a [[musical revue]], produced by [[André Charlot]] with music and lyrics by Noël Coward, which opened at London's [[Duke of York's Theatre]] on 4 September 1923. It is famous for being Noël Coward's first publicly produced musical work and for the use of a 3-D [[stereoscopic]] [[shadowgraph]] as part of its opening act. The revue's song "Parisian Pierrot", sung by [[Gertrude Lawrence]], was Coward's first big hit and became one of his signature tunes.

==Background and productions==
The basis of ''London Calling!'' began at the Swiss resort of [[Davos]] in Christmas 1922, when Coward presented a musical outline of a new project involving himself and Lawrence, to benefactor, Edward William Bootle Wilbraham, 3rd Earl of Lathom, who was also a friend of André Charlot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lathom-park-trust.org.uk/theatre20s.html ''The History of Latham''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120133825/http://www.lathom-park-trust.org.uk/theatre20s.html |date=20 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lathom had liked it and approached Charlot to produce it. Charlot's West End musical production ''Rats'', which premiered on 21 February 1923 at the [[Vaudeville Theatre]], also starred Lawrence. At first Charlot did not have Coward in mind for performing in ''London Calling!'', but Coward used his contractual right of veto to turn down all other suggestions for leading man. Charlot gave way and paid him a wage of £40 a week with the success of the show.&lt;ref&gt;Morley, Sheridan. ''Coward'', p. 27, Haus, 2005 {{ISBN|1-904341-88-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;£40 in 1923 would equate to at least £1,600 in 2007 terms [http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/result.php measuringworth.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The revue featured 25 sketches, skits, songs and dance routines, with choreographic assistance by [[Fred Astaire]] who was working in London's [[Shaftesbury Theatre]] with his sister [[Adele Astaire|Adele]] at the time. Astaire taught Coward tap-dancing at the nearby Guildhall School of Music.&lt;ref&gt;''New Theatre Quarterly'' 39:37 ISSN 0266-464X&lt;/ref&gt; West End's leading lady Gertrude Lawrence made her singing debut with Coward's musical works, an association that would continue throughout their careers. Lawrence had previously worked with him on the [[Liverpool]] production of [[Gerhart Hauptmann]]'s play ''Hannele'' in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Day, Barry (ed.) ''The Letters of Noel Coward''. (Page 34) Random House, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-375-42303-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revue sketches made light of London society at the time, with one sketch called "The Swiss Family Whittlebot" poking fun at [[The Sitwells]], known for their avant-garde poetry and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Morley, Sheridan. ''Coward''. (Page 29) Haus, 2005 {{ISBN|1-904341-88-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revue ran for 367 performances. Charlot was developing a new production entitled ''André Charlot's London Revue of 1924'' and had replaced Lawrence with singer Joyce Barbour in January 1924, at which point the production was nearing the end of its 5-month run. Coward's next project was the controversial play ''[[The Vortex]]'' (1924).

==Shadowgraph and connections with radio==
The opening act of ''London Calling!'' utilised [[Laurens Hammond]]'s patented 3-D [[shadowgraph]] process, which required the patrons to wear special colour-tinted glasses. American inventor Hammond had earlier developed a [[Teleview]] sequential viewing system for use as part of the successful productions of the ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'' (1907–1931).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3dmovingpictures.com/shadows.html |title=Shadows on the Wall |publisher=3dmovingpictures.com |date= |accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use influenced producer André Charlot, who was in the United States at the time of the ''Follies'', to attempt something similar in Europe. Because the patent did not have immediate effect in foreign countries, Hammond was unable to collect any royalties from the production of ''London Calling!''. With the success of the show, Charlot became referred to as "the British Ziegfeld", a title he loathed.&lt;ref&gt;Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/1920bway2.htm ''History of the Musical Stage''] at Musicals101.com, The Cyber Encyclopedia of Musical Theatre, Film and Television&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the influence between productions on the use of shadowgraph, the first song title mentioning the medium of radio was in the ''Ziegfeld Follies of 1922''. The name of the song was "Listening on Some Radio". The phrase "London Calling!" was the call sign of [[BBC Radio]] in London (2LO), which also began transmitting in 1922.

{{nihongo|'''''Lost Universe'''''|ロスト・ユニバース|Rosuto Yunibāsu}} is a series of [[science fiction]] [[light novel]]s, running from 1992 to 1999, by Japanese author [[Hajime Kanzaka]]. It was later adapted into a 26-episode [[anime]] television series that ran throughout the summer of 1998 on [[TV Tokyo]] during the same time slot that the anime adaptation of Kanzaka's previous work, ''[[Slayers]]'', ran.

This anime is called "Universe Police" in China and Hong Kong.

==Plot==
In ''[[Slayers]]'', it was mentioned that the main characters of that series live on a world that is one of the four created by the mother of all creation, called the [[List of Slayers characters#Lord of Nightmares|Lord of Nightmares]]. This world was known as the Red World. ''Lost Universe'', however, takes place in a different world, known as the Black World. Whereas the demi gods of the various worlds such as Ruby-Eye Shabranigdo and Dark Star Dugradigdo had physical presence in that world, they appear in the Black World as "Lost Ships", intelligent space ships of unknown origin that have powerful or somewhat divine powers with more advanced technology than any other device in the universe. Their rarity and superiority has sparked suggestions that they have been made by an advanced ancient alien civilization or by coming from the beginning of the universe itself. Being a central part to the plot the "Lost Ships" are intelligent beings with different loyalties and even their own agenda. Kane Blueriver, a "trouble contractor," inherits a "Lost Ship" from his grandmother and from there, he and his sidekick Milly, together with Canal, the ship's computer, journey to find a source of the evil that threatens the universe.

==Characters==
; {{va|Kain Blueriver}}
{{anime voice|[[Souichiro Hoshi]]|Steve Metz}}
:{{nihongo|Kain Blueriver||カイン・ブルーリバー|Kain Burūribaa}} is an intergalactic trouble-Contractor. He is a tough and reckless adventurer who captains Sword-Breaker, the legendary lost space ship from an ancient civilization. He acquired his spaceship from his grandmother and constantly recites quotes of her. A free spirit, keeps an open mind whatever the situation. Ever the optimist, he is always confident he will prevail over whatever troubles await him. His motto is "carry out any difficult assignment to the end!" Kain is the master of the Psi-Blade, a weapon of psi energy, requiring tremendous mental strength. He wears a black cloak, likes his grandmother.

;{{va|Mille}}
{{anime voice|[[Tomoko Ishimura]]|Larissa Wolcott}}
:{{Nihongo|Millennium Feria "Millie" Nocturne|ミレニアム・フェリア・ノクターン|Mireniamu Feria Nokutaan}}, is a happy-go-lucky girl whose catchphrase is that she aspires to be the "best in the universe". She joins Kain on their space adventures as an assistant and sometimes private detective. She has very basic detecting skills like opening a locked door with her hair pin. At work, she is indeed the best shot in the universe, but at home on Sword-Breaker, is another matter. Providing a bit of comedy, she routinely blows up the kitchen, but somehow the meals turn out delicious.

; {{va|Canal Volfield|Canal Vorfeed}}
{{anime voice|[[Megumi Hayashibara]]|Jessica Schwartz}}
:{{nihongo|Canal Volfeld|キャナル・ヴォルフィード|Kyanaru Vorufiido}} is a female human-like hologram that serves as the ''Sword-Breaker'' ship's computer. She has green hair styled in two long braids. She has a distinctive personality, emotions and reasoning abilities. Her usual form is a teenage girl, but if necessary, and she can morph her form into a baby, a noble lady or other objects, whatever is needed to help Kain in his missions. Her motto is "carry out any difficult assignment to the end, as long as it shows a profit!" In this respect she is much like [[Lina Inverse]], from the series ''[[Slayers]]''. Ironically they are voiced by the same actress. Canal's mind functions as a computer, and she is very practical, analytical and logical. On the other hand, she sometimes shows her emotions when she teases Kain for his mistakes or has a quarrel with Millie. She is a bit selfish, doing a lot of negative actions for the Sword-Breaker owner (Kain Blueriver), like turning off Life System only for getting a job that Kain did not want.

; {{va|Rail Claymore}}
{{anime voice|[[Hikaru Midorikawa]]|[[Bill Wise]]}}
:A handsome and smart police inspector of Interstellar Police. Kain has a sort of inescapable "give-and-take" relationship with this young inspector. He often contacts the crew of the Sword breaker with mission requests, that are not always requests.

; {{va|Nina Mercury}}
{{anime voice|[[Masami Suzuki]]|Camille Chen}}
:The secretary of Raily Claymore. Nina is so deeply in love with Raily that she is fascinated by his gaze and forgets what she is doing. Two running gags in the series focus on her accidentally spilling coffee on Rail, and shortening out any machine with the slightest touch. The latter is actually useful in several adventures.

; {{va|Stargazer}}
{{anime voice|[[Jouji Nakata]]|[[George Spelvin]]}}
:The master of a giant company called Gazer Konzern and the boss of mega-crime organization; Nightmare. He is the master of the Lost Ship Dark star and intends to control the whole universe. Stargazer possesses a power to destroy the mind of a person from afar.

; {{va|Spreader of Darkness}}
{{anime voice|[[Yasunori Matsumoto]]|David Stokey}}
:A young-looking guy who works for Stargazer, and master of Goln-Nova, one of the legendary Lost Ships. He commands Glen and Carly at Nightmare. He was injured in the battle with Alice 10 years ago and has since been in stasis. He woke up after sleeping for 87016 hours in a capsule.

{{main|List of Lost Universe episodes}}
''Lost Universe'' ran for 26 episodes, and was plagued with numerous production problems. Most notably, large amounts of the raw work for the first few episodes was destroyed in a studio fire and had to be quickly replaced leading to fairly sketchy quality for those episodes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} It also ran in during the Southeast Asian financial crisis of 1998 which severely limited budgets for anime series across all studios. A ''Lost Universe'' film was rumored in 1998, but was cancelled in favor of more ''Slayers'' films.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

''Lost Universe'' is distributed in North America by [[Enoki Films]], and was originally licensed for American distribution by [[ADV Films]] who released the series onto both dubbed and subtitled VHS tapes and bilingual DVD. The rights have since transferred to [[Nozomi Entertainment]] who re-released the complete series in a new bilingual DVD box set.

The 4th episode entitled {{nihongo|''Yashigani Hofuru''|ヤシガニ屠る)||lit. "feasting on [[coconut crab]]"}}, which aired on April 24, 1998, was initially worked on by a [[South Korea]]n animation company, San Ho Studio. They only had basic manuals of the characters. The result was so dismal in quality that it was later reworked for the [[Laserdisc]] releases. The San Ho depiction of that episode is no longer considered [[canon (fiction)|canon]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

[[File:Marie Lloyd by Langfier Ltd.jpg|250px|thumb|Marie Lloyd]]
'''Matilda Alice Victoria Wood''' (12 February 1870&amp;nbsp;– 7 October 1922), professionally known as '''Marie Lloyd''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɑː|r|i}};&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; was an English [[music hall]] singer, comedian and [[musical theatre]] actress. She was best known for her performances of songs such as  "[[The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery]]", "[[My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)]]" and "[[Oh! Mr Porter|Oh Mr Porter What Shall I Do]]".  She received both criticism and praise for her use of [[innuendo]] and [[double entendre]] during her performances, but enjoyed a long and prosperous career, during which she was affectionately called the "Queen of the Music Hall".

Born in London, she was showcased by her father at the Eagle Tavern in [[Hoxton]].  In 1884, she made her professional début as Bella Delmere; she changed her stage name to Marie Lloyd the following year.  In 1885, she had success with her song "The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery", and she frequently topped the bill at prestigious theatres in London's [[West End theatre|West End]].  In 1891, she was recruited by the [[impresario]] [[Augustus Harris]] to appear in that year's spectacular [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] Christmas [[pantomime]] ''Humpty Dumpty''. She starred in a further two productions at the theatre, ''Little Bo Peep'' (1892) and ''Robinson Crusoe'' (1893).  By the mid-1890s, Lloyd was in frequent dispute with Britain's theatre censors due to the risqué content of her songs.

Between 1894 and 1900, she became an international success when she toured France, America, Australia and Belgium with her solo music hall act. In 1907, she assisted other performers during the [[Music Hall War of 1907|music hall war]] and took part in demonstrations outside theatres, protesting for better pay and conditions for performers.  During the First World War, in common with most other music hall artists, she supported recruitment into the armed services to help the [[war effort]], touring hospitals and industrial institutions to help boost morale. In 1915, she performed her only wartime song "Now You've Got Your Khaki On", which became a favourite among front-line troops.

Lloyd had a turbulent private life that was often the subject of press attention: she was married three times, divorced twice, and frequently found herself giving court testimony against two of her husbands who had physically abused her.  In later life, she was still in demand at music halls and had a late success in 1919 with her performance of "My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)", which became one of her most popular songs. Privately, she suffered from bouts of ill-health and became alcohol-dependent, both of which imposed restrictions on her performing career by the 1920s.  In 1922, she gave her final performance at the [[Alhambra Theatre]], London, during which she became ill on stage. She died a few days later at the age of 52.

Lloyd was born on 12 February 1870 in [[Hoxton]], London.  Her father, John Wood (1847–1940), was an [[artificial flower]] arranger and waiter; her mother, Matilda Mary Caroline ''[[née]]'' Archer (1849–1931), was a dressmaker and costume designer.{{refn|John "Brushie" Wood was of Irish descent; the son of a willow-cutter father and a willow-weaver mother, he grew up in the English countryside.  Matilda Wood's parents were boot makers from London.  John and Matilda married in [[Bethnal Green]], London in April 1869.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} Lloyd was the eldest of nine children&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Gray, Frances.

Lloyd often took career advice from her mother, whose influence was strong in the family. Lloyd attended a school in Bath Street, London, but disliked formal education and often played truant;&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; with both her parents working, she adopted a maternal role over her siblings, helping to keep them entertained, clean and well cared-for.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Along with her sister [[Alice Lloyd (actor)|Alice]], she arranged events in which the Wood children performed at the family home.&lt;ref&gt;Farson, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;  Lloyd enjoyed entertaining her family and decided to form a [[Minstrel show|minstrel]] act in 1879 called the Fairy Bell [[Dance troupe|troupe]], comprising her siblings.&lt;ref name=Farson36&gt;Farson, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|In 1880, the act featured Lloyd's brother Johnny (age 9), and sisters Alice (7), Grace (5), Daisy (3), and Anne (18 months).&lt;ref name=Farson36/&gt;|group= n}}

Costumed by Matilda,&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; they toured local [[Flophouse|doss-houses]] in [[East London]], where they performed [[temperance movement|temperance]] songs, teaching people the dangers of alcohol abuse.&lt;ref name=Farson36/&gt;{{refn|In one sketch, Lloyd dressed in clothes borrowed from her father and played the part of an alcoholic husband, who arrives home late in a drunken state.

She returned home that evening and declared that she wanted a permanent career on the stage.  Although happy to have her performing in her spare time, her parents initially opposed the idea of her appearing on the stage full-time. She recalled that when her parents "saw that they couldn't kick their objections as high as [she] could kick [her] legs, they very sensibly came to the conclusion to let things take their course and said 'Bless you my child, do what you like'."&lt;ref name=Farson37&gt;Farson, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career and first marriage===
[[File:Hoxton Hall.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Hoxton Hall]] (formerly the Blue Ribbon Gospel Temperance Mission)]]
On 9 May 1885, at the age of 15, Lloyd made her professional solo stage début at the Grecian [[music hall]] (in the same premises as the Eagle Tavern),&lt;ref name=GILLIES11&gt;Gillies, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; under the name "Matilda Wood".&lt;ref name=GILLIES16&gt;Gillies, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;  She performed "In the Good Old Days" and "My Soldier Laddie",&lt;ref name=GILLIES16/&gt; which proved successful, and earned her a booking at the [[Falstaff|Sir John Falstaff]] music hall in [[Old Street]] where she sang a series of romantic ballads.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after this, she chose the stage name Bella Delmere&lt;ref name="Gillies, p. 18"&gt;Gillies, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|This stage name was spelled differently by various biographers, including Bella Delmare (by [[Naomi Jacob]]); Belle Delamere (by [[W. J. MacQueen-Pope]] in ''The Melodies Linger On'' and Bella Delmore in ''Queen of the Music Halls''); and Bella Delmere (by M.W. Disher and Colin Macinnes). Lloyd's biographer Daniel Farson chooses the latter spelling calling Disher "the most accurate authority".&lt;ref name=Farson37/&gt;|group= n}} and appeared on stage in costumes designed by her mother.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;  Her performances were a success, despite her singing other artists' songs without their permission,&lt;ref name=Farson37/&gt; a practice which brought her a threat of an [[injunction]] from one of the original performers.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; News of her act travelled; that October, she appeared at the Collins music hall in [[Islington]] in a special performance to celebrate the theatre's refurbishment, the first time she had appeared outside Hoxton, and two months later, she was engaged at the Hammersmith Temple of Varieties and the [[New London Theatre|Middlesex Music Hall]] in [[Drury Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 February 1886, she appeared at the prestigious Sebright Music Hall in [[Bethnal Green]], where she met George Ware, a prolific composer of music hall songs. Ware became her agent and,&lt;ref name="Gillies, p. 18"/&gt; after a few weeks, she began performing songs purchased from little-known composers.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; As her popularity grew, Ware suggested that she change her name. "Marie" was chosen for its "posh" and "slightly French" sound, and "Lloyd" was taken from an edition of ''[[Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper]]''.&lt;ref name=DNB2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Farson38&gt;Farson, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloyd established her new name on 22 June 1886,&lt;ref name="Gillies, p. 18"/&gt; with an appearance at the Falstaff Music Hall, where she attracted wide notice for the song "[[The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery]]" (which was initially written for [[Nelly Power]] by Lloyd's agent George Ware).&lt;ref name=Farson38/&gt; By 1887, her performance of the song had become so popular that she was in demand in London's [[West End theatre|West End]],&lt;ref name=VandA/&gt; including the Oxford Music Hall, where she excelled at [[Skirt dance|skirt dancing]].&lt;ref&gt;Pope, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; George Belmont, the Falstaff's proprietor, secured her an engagement at the Star Palace of Varieties in [[Bermondsey]]. She soon began making her own costumes, a skill she learned from her mother, and one she used for the rest of her career.&lt;ref name=ERA2&gt;"A Chat With Marie Lloyd", ''The Era'', 28 October 1893, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; She undertook a month-long tour of Ireland at the start of 1886, earning £10 per week after which she returned to East London to perform at, amongst others, the Sebright Music Hall, Bethnal Green.&lt;ref name=Farson38/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.overthefootlights.co.uk/20.pdf "Sebright Music Hall, Hackney"], Over the Footlights.co.uk, accessed 28 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Other performers on the bill included the Sergeant Simms Zouave Troupe, the King of Egypt, a one-legged champion, and others.&lt;ref name=Farson38/&gt;|group= n}} On 23 October, ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'' called her "a pretty little soubrette who dances with great dash and energy."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Farson, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Empire Theatre (1911).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Empire, Leicester Square]], in 1911]]
By the end of 1886, Lloyd was playing several halls a night&lt;ref&gt;Farson, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; and earned £100 per week. She was now able to afford new songs from established music hall composers and writers,&lt;ref&gt;Pope, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; including "Harry's a Soldier", "She Has a Sailor for a Lover",  and "Oh Jeremiah, Don't you Go to Sea".{{refn|"Oh Jeremiah, Don't you Go to Sea", was written in 1889 by Tom Maguire.

While appearing at the Foresters music hall in [[Mile End]], she met and began dating Percy Charles Courtenay,&lt;ref&gt;Pope, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; a ticket [[tout]] from [[Streatham]], London.  The courtship was brief, and the couple married on 12 November 1887 at [[St John the Baptist, Hoxton]].{{refn|On the marriage certificate, Courtenay gave his profession as a captain in the British army.

In October 1888, Lloyd  returned from maternity leave and joined rehearsals for the 1888–89 pantomime ''The Magic Dragon of the Demon Dell; or, The Search for the Mystic Thyme'', in which she was cast as Princess Kristina.  The production, which was staged between [[Boxing Day]] and February at the Britannia theatre in Hoxton, gave her the security of working close to home for a two-month period.  The engagement also gave her much-needed experience of playing to a big audience.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, she appeared at more Bohemian venues including the [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire]] and the [[Alhambra Theatre|Alhambra]] theatres, the [[London Trocadero|Trocadero Palace of Varieties]], and the [[Victoria Palace Theatre|Royal Standard playhouse]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, she gave birth to a [[stillbirth|stillborn]] child, which further damaged her marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leicester-square-1874-iln.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Alhambra Theatre]], Leicester Square]] 
By the start of the 1890s, Lloyd had built up a successful catalogue of songs, which included "What's That For, Eh?", about a little girl who asks her parents the meaning of various everyday household objects. Her biographer and theatre historian [[W. J. MacQueen-Pope]] described the song as being "blue" and thought that it spoke volumes about her reputation thanks to her "wonderful wink, and that sudden, dazzling smile, and the nod of the head."&lt;ref name="POPE68-69"&gt;Pope, pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar-styled songs followed; "She'd Never had her Ticket Punched Before", told the story of a young, naive woman travelling to London on her own by train.  This was followed by "The Wrong Man Never Let a Chance go By"; "We Don't Want to Fight, But, by Jingo, If we Do";&lt;ref name="POPE68-69"/&gt; "Oh You Wink the Other Eye"&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/pdf/O1243530/then-you-wink-the-other-sheet-music-w-t-lytton/ Sheet music - Then You Wink The Other Eye], Victoria and Albert Museum website, accessed 26 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and "Twiggy Vous"—a song which won her much success and increased her popularity abroad.&lt;ref name="POPE68-69"/&gt; After an evening's performance at the Oxford music hall, a French well-wisher requested a conversation and to meet Lloyd backstage.  Flanked by Courtenay, she appeared at the stage door, where Courtenay threatened the man with violence as both had become suspicious of his interest in her. She took a chance and invited the man into her dressing room, where he identified himself as a member of the French government. He confirmed to her that "Twiggy Vous" was "most popular in Paris"; she was delighted at the news.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of the year, Lloyd returned to London where she appeared in the Christmas pantomime ''Cinderella'' in Peckham alongside her sister Alice.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, pp. 129–130&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1891 and 1893, Lloyd was recruited by the [[impresario]] [[Augustus Harris]] to appear alongside Dan Leno in the spectacular and popular [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] Christmas [[pantomimes]].{{refn|Walter Macqueen-Pope called Lloyd a Principal Girl and noted that "There is often a misconception about this and a belief that she was Principal Boy there. She was Principal Boy in other pantomimes but never at Drury Lane."&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen-Pope, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} While lunching with Harris in 1891 to discuss his offer, Lloyd played coy, deliberately confusing the theatre with the lesser known venue [[New London Theatre|the Old Mo]] so as not to appear conscious of Drury Lane's successful reputation; she compared its structure to that of a prison. Secretly, she was thrilled with the offer,&lt;ref name="GILLIES53"/&gt; for which she would receive £100 per week. The pantomime seasons lasted from Boxing Day to March&lt;ref name=Farson45&gt;Farson, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; and were highly lucrative, but Lloyd found working from a script restrictive.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt;  Her first role was Princess Allfair in ''Humpty Dumpty; or, The Yellow Dwarf and the Fair One'',&lt;ref name=GILLIES53&gt;Gillies, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; which she dismissed as being "Bloody awful, eh?"&lt;ref name="Farson, p. 46"&gt;Farson, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; She received mixed reviews for her opening performance. ''The Times'' described her as being "playful in gesture, graceful in appearance, but not strong in voice."&lt;ref name="GILLIES53"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Humpty Dumpty", ''The Times'', 28 December 1891, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the weak start (which Lloyd blamed on nerves), the pantomime received glowing reviews from the theatrical press.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The ''London Entr'acte'' thought that she "delivere[d] her text quite pungently, and sings and dances with spirit too."&lt;ref&gt;"Humpty Dumpty Triumph", ''London Entr'acte'', 2 January 1892, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; She was noted for her acrobatic dancing on stage, and was able to display handstands, tumbles and high kicks.  As a boy, the writer [[Compton Mackenzie]] was taken to the show's opening night and admitted that he was "greatly surprised that any girl should have the courage to let the world see her drawers as definitely as Marie Lloyd."&lt;ref&gt;Compton Mackenzie's memoirs, p. 232, as quoted in Gillies, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloyd's biographer [[Midge Gillies]] defines 1891 as being the year that she officially "made it" thanks to a catalogue of hit songs and major success in the halls and pantomime. When she appeared at the Oxford music hall in June, the audience cheered so loudly for her return that the following act could not be heard; ''The Era'' called her "the favourite of the hour".&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Miss Marie Lloyd at the Oxford", ''The Era'', 12 September 1891, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer months, she toured North England, including [[Liverpool]], [[Birmingham]] and [[Manchester]].

I think of little besides her."&lt;ref&gt;''Letters to Reggie'' as quoted in Gillies, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 January 1892, Lloyd and Courtenay brawled drunkenly in her Drury Lane dressing room after an evening's performance of ''Little Bo-Peep''.

Lloyd made her American stage début in 1893, appearing at [[Koster and Bial's Music Hall]] in New York.  She sang  "Oh You Wink the Other Eye", much to the delight of her American audiences. Other numbers were  "After the Pantomime" and "You Should Go to France and See the Ladies Dance", which both required her to wear provocative costumes.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; Her performances pleased the theatre proprietors, who presented her with an antique tea and coffee service.&lt;ref name=ERA2/&gt;{{refn|The inscription on the service read: "Marie Lloyd from Koster and Bial, Friday 12 December 1890, New York."

Her biographer [[Daniel Farson]] thought that she received "greater acclaim than any other English comedienne who had preceded her".&lt;ref&gt;Farson, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; She changed the lyrics to some of her best-known songs for her French audience and retitled them, "The Naughty Continong"; "Twiggy Vous"; "I'm Just Back from Paris" and "The Coster Honeymoon in Paris".&lt;ref&gt;Farson, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Despite the audience's obvious joy, Lloyd grew insecure of her French performances.

In May 1894, Courtenay followed Lloyd to the Empire, Leicester Square, where she was performing, and attempted to batter her with a stick, shouting: "I will gouge your eyes out and ruin you!"  His assault missed Lloyd, but struck Burge in the face instead.

====Risqué reputation and transatlantic tours====
[[File:Laura Chant in 1893.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Laura Ormiston Chant]]]]
By 1895, Lloyd's risqué songs were receiving frequent criticism from theatre reviewers and influential [[feminist]]s. As a result, she often experienced resistance from strict theatre censorship which dogged the rest of her career.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; The writer and feminist [[Laura Ormiston Chant]], who was a member of the Social Purity Alliance, disliked the bawdiness of music hall performances, and thought that the venues were attractive to prostitutes.  Her campaign persuaded the [[London County Council]] to erect large screens around the promenade at the Empire Theatre in Leicester Square, as part of the licensing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Farson, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LMA1&gt;[https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/london-metropolitan-archives/visitor-information/Documents/47-theatre-and-music-hall-sources-at-lma.pdf "Sources for the history of London Theatres and Music Halls at London Metropolitan Archives"], London Metropolitan Archives, Information Leaflet Number 47, pp. 6–7, accessed 23 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The screens were unpopular and protesters, among them the young [[Winston Churchill]], later pulled them down.&lt;ref name="GILLIES315"&gt;Gillies, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; That November at the [[Tivoli Music Hall (London)|Tivoli theatre]], Lloyd performed "Johnny Jones", a ditty about a girl who is taught the facts of life by her best male friend.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; The song, although not lyrically obscene, was considered to be offensive largely because of the manner in which Lloyd sang it, adding winks and gestures, and creating a conspiratorial relationship with her audience.  Social reformers cited "Johnny Jones" as being offensive, but less so compared to other songs of the day.&lt;ref name=GILLIES102&gt;Gillies, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the expiry of a music hall's entertainments licence, the Licensing Committee tried to use the lyrical content of music hall songs as evidence against a renewal.&lt;ref name=LMA1/&gt; As a result, Lloyd was summoned to perform some of her songs in front of a council committee.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;  She sang "Oh! Mr Porter" (composed for her by [[George Le Brunn]]), "A Little of What You Fancy"&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; and "She Sits Among the Cabbages and Peas",&lt;ref&gt;Nuttall, Carmichael, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; which she retitled  "I Sits Amongst the Cabbages and Leeks" after some protest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/comedy/8730911/The-BBC-should-see-thefunny-side-of-risque-humour.html "The BBC should see the funny side of risqué humour"], ''The Telegraph'' (online edition), accessed 8 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers were sung in such a way that the committee had no reason to find anything amiss. Feeling disgruntled at the council's interference, she then rendered [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson's]] [[drawing-room]] ballad "[[Come into the Garden, Maud]]" and displayed leers and nudges, to illustrate each innuendo.  The committee were left stunned at the performance,&lt;ref&gt;Pope, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; but Lloyd argued afterwards that the rudeness was "all in the mind".&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Despite their opposing views on music hall entertainment, Lloyd and Chant shared similar political views, and were wrongly assumed by the press to be enemies.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;{{refn|Chant's pressure for censorship was based on the [[Contagious Diseases Act]], which prevented the spread of [[venereal infection]] by allowing the police to arrest prostitutes and force them to undergo a medical examination. Chant was also a campaigner against [[domestic violence]], something that Lloyd experienced in all of her marriages.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;|group= n}} An inspector who reported on one of Lloyd's performances at the Oxford music hall thought that her lyrical content was fine but her knowing nods, looks, smiles and the suggestiveness in her winks to the audience suggested otherwise.&lt;ref name=LMA1/&gt; The restrictions imposed on the music halls were, by now beginning to affect trade, and many were threatened with closure.&lt;ref&gt;Farson, pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid social unrest, Hackney council scrapped the licensing restrictions on 7 October 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Farson, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, Lloyd sailed to South Africa with her daughter, who appeared as Little Maudie Courtenay on the same bill as her mother.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd came to the attention of [[Barney Barnato]], a British entrepreneur who was responsible for [[randlord|mining diamond and gold]].  Barnato lavished gifts on her in an attempt to woo her, but his attempts were unsuccessful; nevertheless, the two remained friends until his death in 1897.  The tour was a triumph for Lloyd, and her songs became popular among her South African audience. She performed "Wink the Other Eye", "Twiggy-Vous", "Hello, Hello, Hello",&lt;ref name=FARSON77&gt;Farson, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; "Whacky, Whacky, Whack!", "Keep Off the Grass",&lt;ref&gt;Pope, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; and "Oh!

[[File:Marie Lloyd 02.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lloyd on stage in the 1890s]]
The following year, Lloyd travelled to New York where she re-appeared at Koster and Bial's Music Hall. Her first song was about a young woman who lacked confidence in finding a suitor. The chorus, "Not for the very best man that ever got into a pair of trousers", proved hilarious; ''The Era'' observed that the line "tickled the audience immensely". Following this, she performed a song about a French maid who appeared innocent and petite at first sight, but turned out not to be so. ''The Era'' described the character as being "not so demure as she looked, for she confided to her auditors that she 'knew a lot about those tricky little things they don't teach a girl at school'." Many other songs followed and were all warmly received.  At the conclusion of each performance, she received gifts from the audience including bouquets and floral structures.&lt;ref name=ERA3&gt;"Marie Lloyd In New York", ''The Era'', 23 October 1897, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Era'' commented that "Miss Lloyd's clever character work, her versatility and unflagging endeavours to please were rewarded with deserved success".&lt;ref name=ERA3/&gt;  After the tour, Lloyd returned to London, and moved to Hampstead with Hurley.&lt;ref name="Gillies, p. 124"&gt;Gillies, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; That Christmas, she appeared in pantomime, this time at the Crown Theatre in [[Peckham]] in a production of ''Dick Whittington'' in which she played the title role. In it, she sang "A Little Bit Off the Top", which MacQueen-Pope describes as being "one of the pantomime songs of the year". ''The Music Hall and Theatre Review'' was equally complimentary, saying: "Brilliant Repertory, Charming Dresses, A Unique Personality!"&lt;ref&gt;Pope, pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; During the Christmas period of 1898–9, Lloyd returned to the Crown where she took her benefit, during which she appeared in ''Dick Whittington''.  The entertainment culminated with a song from [[Vesta Victoria]], and a short piece called ''The Squeaker'', starring [[Joe Elvin]].&lt;ref&gt;"Miss Marie Lloyd's Benefit", ''The Era'', 25 February 1899, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

It was staged at the Tivoli theatre, in celebration of the Coronation of King Edward VII.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd and Courtenay's divorce became absolute on 22 May 1905, and she married Hurley on 27 October 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Farson, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Hurley, although ecstatic with his earlier success in Australia, began feeling sidelined by his wife's popularity.

Shortly after her marriage to Hurley, Lloyd went to [[Bournemouth]] to recuperate from exhaustion.  Within days she was back performing in London music halls.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; From the start of the new century, music hall artistes and theatre managers had been in dispute over working conditions, a reduction in pay and perks, and an increased number of matinée performances.  The first significant rift was a 1906 strike,&lt;ref&gt;Pope, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; initiated by the [[Variety Artistes' Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, [[Music Hall War of 1907|the Music Hall War]] commenced, which saw the Federation fight for more freedom and better working conditions on behalf of music-hall performers.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt; Although popular enough to command her own fees, Lloyd supported the strike,&lt;ref&gt;Farson, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; acted as a [[picketing (protest)|picket]] for the strikers and gave generously to the strike fund.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; To raise spirits, she often performed on picket lines and took part in a fundraising performance at the [[Scala Theatre]]. During one demonstration, she recognised someone trying to enter and shouted, "Let her through, girls, she'll close the music hall faster than we can." The singer was [[Belle Elmore]], later murdered by her husband, [[Dr. Crippen]]. The dispute ended later the same year with a resolution broadly favourable to the performers.&lt;ref name="Pope, p. 133"&gt;Pope, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, Lloyd appeared at the Gaiety Theatre in [[Dundee]] where a critic for ''The Courier'' noted "Her bright smile and fascinating presence has much to do with her popularity, while her songs are of the catchy style, perhaps not what a Dundee audience is familiar with, but still amusing and of an attractive style."&lt;ref&gt;"Marie Lloyd at the Gaiety", ''The Courier'', 30 March 1909, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relationship with Bernard Dillon====
[[File:Bernard Dillon Vanity Fair 12 September 1906.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Bernard Dillon]]]]
Despite their marital problems, Lloyd went on an American tour with Hurley in 1908. She was eager to equal the success of her sister Alice, who had become popular in the country a few years previously.&lt;ref name="Pope, p. 133"/&gt; By 1910, Marie's relationship with Hurley had ended, due in part to her endless parties and her developing friendship with the jockey [[Bernard Dillon]], winner of the 1910 [[Derby (horse race)|Derby]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=FARSON85&gt;Farson, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn| Dillon was born in 1888 in [[Tralee]], Ireland and moved to England at age thirteen, where he took up horse racing. Dillon met Lloyd at one of her parties in 1910, having been invited by Marie Jr.&lt;ref name=FARSON85/&gt;|group= n}}  Lloyd and the young sportsman began an open and passionate affair.  For the first time, her private life eclipsed her professional career. She was seldom mentioned in the theatrical press in 1910, and when she did perform, it was not to the best of her abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;  The writer [[Arnold Bennett]], who witnessed her on stage at the Tivoli Theatre in 1909, admitted that he "couldn't see the legendary cleverness of the vulgarity of Marie Lloyd" and accused her songs of being "variations of the same theme of sexual naughtiness."&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; As with Courtenay years previously, the shy and retiring Dillon was finding it hard to adapt to Lloyd's elaborate and sociable lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Dillon's success on the racecourse was short lived.&lt;ref name="GILLIES232-33"&gt;Gillies, pp. 232–233&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, he was expelled from the [[Jockey Club]] for borrowing £660 to bet on his own horses to win.&lt;ref&gt;"Mr Dillon's debt", ''The Times'', 6 June 1913, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Dillon's horses lost, and he ended up in debt to trainers.&lt;ref name="GILLIES232-33"/&gt; He became jealous of Lloyd's successful life in the spotlight.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;  Depression led to drink and obesity, and he started to abuse her.&lt;ref&gt;Farson, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;  Hurley, meanwhile, had initiated divorce proceedings, the strain of which caused him to drink heavily, which in turn finished his theatrical career.&lt;ref&gt;Farson, pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd left the marital home in Hampstead and moved to [[Golders Green]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5396390 "A Jockey Divorced"], ''The Advertiser'', 19 December 1913, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; with Dillon, a move which MacQueen-Pope describes as being "the worst thing she ever did."&lt;ref&gt;Pope, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
A new show in London in 1912 showcased the best of music hall's talent.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Royal Variety Performance|Royal Command Performance]] took place at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] in London, which was managed by [[Alfred Butt]].&lt;ref&gt;Farson, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; The show was organised by [[Oswald Stoll]], an Australian impresario who managed a string of [[West End of London|West End]] and provincial theatres.  Stoll, although a fan of Lloyd's, disliked the vulgarity of her act and championed a return to a more family-friendly atmosphere within the music hall.&lt;ref&gt;Farson, pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, and her participation in the earlier music hall war, Stoll left her out of the line-up.&lt;ref name=VandA/&gt; He placed an advert in ''The Era'' on the day of the performance warning that "Coarseness and vulgarity etc are not allowed&amp;nbsp;... this intimation is rendered necessary only by a few artists".&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'' as quoted in Jacob, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; In retaliation, Lloyd staged her own show at the [[London Pavilion]], advertising that "every one of her performances was a command performance by order of the British public".&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pope, pp. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; She performed "One Thing Leads to Another", "Oh Mr Porter", and "The Boy I Love Is up in the Gallery" and was hailed as "the Queen of Comedy" by critics.&lt;ref&gt;Farson, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, she travelled to [[Devon]] where she appeared at the Exeter Hippodrome to much success. ''The Devon and Exeter Gazette'', reported that Lloyd's performance of "Every Movement Tells a Tale", was "thoroughly enjoyed" by the audience and "[received] round after round of applause".  The paper also praised her recital of a "Cockney girl's honeymoon in Paris", which was met by "roars of laughter".&lt;ref&gt;"Marie Lloyd At Exeter Hippodrome", ''The Devon and Exeter Gazette'', 27 August 1912, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scandal in America====
In 1913, Lloyd was booked by the Orpheum Syndicate to appear at the [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)|New York Palace Theatre]]. She and Dillon set sail on the [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']] under the name Mr and Mrs Dillon&lt;ref&gt;Farson, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; and were met at the American port by her sister Alice, who had resided in the country for many years.&lt;ref name=Courier1&gt;"Miss Marie Lloyd Is Ordered to Be Deported From America", ''The Courier'', 3 October 1913, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arrival, Lloyd and Dillon were refused entry when the authorities found out that they were not married, as they had claimed when applying for entry visas. They were detained and threatened with deportation on the grounds of [[moral turpitude]]&lt;ref&gt;Farson, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; and were sent to [[Ellis Island]] while an enquiry took place.&lt;ref&gt;"The Detention of Miss Marie Lloyd and Dillon", ''Derby Daily Telegraph'', 4 October 1913, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  Dillon was charged under the [[Mann Act|White Slave Act]] with attempting to take into the country a woman who was not his wife, and Lloyd was charged with being a passive agent.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  After a lengthy enquiry, a surety of $300 each, and an imposed condition that they were to live apart while in America, the couple were allowed to stay until March 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Farson, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;  Alice later stated that "the indignity of the subsequent experience [while in custody] went to Marie's heart in a way she never survived.  She could not bear to talk of that awful twenty-four hours."&lt;ref&gt;"My sister Marie Lloyd", ''Lloyds Sunday News'', 10 December 1922, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edward F Albee 1857 1930 USA.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Edward Franklin Albee II|Edward Albee]], the organiser of Lloyd's final trip to America]]
Despite the problems, the tour was a success, and Lloyd performed to packed theatres throughout America. Her act featured the songs "The Tiddly Wink", "I'd Like to Live in Paris All the Time (The Coster Girl in Paris)", and "The Aviator". The numbers were popular, partly due to the Americanisation of each song's lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; On a personal level, Lloyd's time in America was miserable and was made worse by the increasing domestic abuse she received from Dillon.  The assaults caused her to miss several key performances, which angered the theatre manager, [[Edward Franklin Albee II|Edward Albee]], who threatened her with a breach of contract action.  She claimed that illness made it difficult for her to perform and protested at her billing position.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; The theatrical press were not convinced. The ''New York Telegraph'' speculated  "In vaudeville circles her domestic relations are thought to be at the bottom of her attacks of disposition."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Telegraph'', 26 November 1913; as quoted in Gillies, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; Back in England, Hurley had died of [[pleurisy]] and [[pneumonia]] on 6 December 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Farson, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd heard the news while appearing in Chicago and sent a wreath with a note saying "until we meet again".&lt;ref name=FARSON103&gt;Farson, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;  She was reported in ''[[The Morning Telegraph]]'' as saying: "With all due respect to the dead, I can cheerfully say that's the best piece of news I've heard in many years, for it means that Bernard Dillon and I will marry as soon as this unlucky year ends."&lt;ref&gt;The ''Morning Telegraph'', 1913 (full date not given); as quoted in Gillies, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd married Dillon on 21 February 1914,  the ceremony taking place at the British [[Consulate]] in [[Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;"Marie Lloyd Married", ''Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advisor'', 23 February 1914, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; When the tour finished, Lloyd commented, "[I will] never forget the humiliation to which I have been subjected and I shall never sing in America again, no matter how high the salary offered."&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Sun'', 4 October 1913, p. 3;  as quoted in Gillies, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

====First World War and final years====

Lloyd and Dillon returned to England in June 1914.&lt;ref name="FARSON103"/&gt;  Lloyd started a provincial tour of Liverpool, [[Aldershot]], [[Southend]], Birmingham and [[Margate]], and finished the summer season at the London Hippodrome.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; She sang "The Coster Honeymoon in Paris" and "Who Paid the Rent for Mrs Rip Van Winkle?", the latter of which had been received particularly well with her American audiences.  Within a fortnight, Britain was [[World War I|at war]], which threw the music-hall world into disarray. The atmosphere in London's music halls had turned patriotic, and theatre proprietors often held charity events and benefits to help the [[war effort]].&lt;ref&gt;Farson, pp. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd played her part and frequently visited hospitals, including the Ulster Volunteer Force Hospital in [[Belfast]],&lt;ref name="Gillies, p. 256"&gt;Gillies, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; where she interacted with wounded servicemen.  She also toured munitions factories to help boost public morale,&lt;ref&gt;Farson, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; but received no official recognition for her work.&lt;ref&gt;Farson, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; During 1914, she scored a hit with "A Little of What you Fancy", which critics thought captured her life perfectly up until that point.  The song is  about a middle-aged woman who encourages the younger generation to enjoy themselves, rather than indulging in life's excitement herself.  During the rendition, Lloyd depicts a young couple who cuddle and kiss on a railway carriage, while she sits back and recalls memories of her doing the same in years gone by.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, pp. 257–258&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1915, Lloyd appeared at the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] where she entertained over ten thousand troops.  At the end of that year, she performed her only war song, "Now You've Got your Khaki On", composed for her by Charles Collins and Fred W. Leigh, about a woman who found the army uniform sexy and thought that wearing it made the average pot-bellied gentleman look like a muscle-toned soldier.  Lloyd's brother John appeared with her on stage dressed as a soldier and helped characterise the ditty. Following this, she sang the already well-established songs "If You Want to Get On in Revue", which depicted a young girl who offered sexual favours to promote her theatrical career, and "The Three Ages of Woman", which took a cynical look at men from a woman's perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; She seldom toured during the war, but briefly performed in [[Northampton]], [[Watford]] and [[Nottingham]] in 1916. By the end of that year, she had suffered a nervous breakdown which she blamed on her hectic workload and a delayed reaction to Hurley's death.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, pp. 254–255&lt;/ref&gt; During the war years, Lloyd's public image had deteriorated.&lt;ref name="GILLIES257"/&gt; Her biographer Midge Gillies thought that Lloyd's violent relationship with Dillon and professional snubs in public had left the singer feeling like "someone's mother, rather than their sweetheart."&lt;ref name="GILLIES257"/&gt;
[[File:Marie Lloyd Jr..jpg|thumb|left|upright|Marie Lloyd Jr. (1888–1967), Lloyd's daughter]]
In July 1916, Dillon was conscripted into the army, but disliked the discipline of regimental life. He applied for exemption on the grounds he had to look after his parents and four brothers,&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 29 July 1916, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; but his claim was rejected. In a later failed attempt, he tried to convince army officials that he was too obese to carry out military duties.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, pp. 255–256&lt;/ref&gt;  On the rare occasions when Dillon was allowed home on leave, he would often indulge in drinking sessions.  One night, Lloyd's friend Bella Burge received a knock at the front door to find a hysterical Lloyd covered in blood and bruises.  When asked to explain what had caused her injuries, she stated that she had caught Dillon in bed with another woman and had had a showdown with her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Farson, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; By 1917, Dillon's drinking had become worse. That June, two constables were called to Lloyd and Dillon's house in Golders Green after Dillon committed a drunken assault on his wife.  Police entered the house and found Lloyd and her maid cowering beneath a table.  Dillon confronted the constables and assaulted one of them, which resulted in him being taken to court, fined and sentenced to a month's hard labour.&lt;ref&gt;"Marie Lloyd's Husband Gets Months Hard Labour for Assault on Police", ''The Evening Telegraph and Post'', 7 June 1917, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd began drinking to escape the trauma of her domestic abuse.  That year, she was earning £470 per week&lt;ref name=FARSON116&gt;Farson, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; performing in music halls and making special appearances. By 1918, she had become popular with the British-based American soldiers, but had failed to capture the spirits of their English counterparts,&lt;ref name="GILLIES257"&gt;Gillies, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; and began feeling sidelined by her peers; [[Vesta Tilley]] had led a very successful recruitment drive into the services, and other music hall performers had been honoured by royalty.&lt;ref name="Gillies, p. 256"/&gt; The following year, she performed perhaps her best known song, "[[My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)]]", which was written for her by Fred W. Leigh and Charles Collins.  The song depicts a mother fleeing her home to avoid the rent man.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, pp. 261–262&lt;/ref&gt;  The lyrics reflected the hardships of working class life in London at the beginning of the 20th century, and gave her the chance to costume the character in a worn out dress and black straw boater, while carrying a birdcage.&lt;ref&gt;Farson, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1919, Lloyd was again left off the cast list for the Royal Variety Performance, which paid tribute to the acts who helped raise money and boost morale during the war years. She was devastated at the snub and grew bitter towards her rivals who had been acknowledged. Her biographer Midge Gillies compared Lloyd to a "talented old aunt who must be allowed to have her turn at the piano even though all everyone really wants is jazz or go to the Picture Palace".&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; She toured [[Cardiff]] in 1919, and in 1920 she was earning £11,000 a year.&lt;ref name=FARSON116/&gt; Despite the high earnings, she was living beyond her means, with a reckless tendency to spend money. She was famous for her generosity, but was unable to differentiate between those in need and those who simply exploited her kindness.&lt;ref name="GILLIES81"&gt;Gillies, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|A family legend has it that one day Lloyd was met by a man who asked for an advance in order to help him with his new invention. She thought the request sounded too elaborate so declined to help, causing [[Guglielmo Marconi]] to look elsewhere. Stories of her spending included hiring an East End hotel so she could provide 150 beds for the area's homeless children; buying her family a hotel in [[Hastings]] and a pub in [[Soho]];&lt;ref name= "GILLIES81"/&gt; and buying two house boats on the Thames called ''Moonbeam'' and ''Sunbeam''.&lt;ref name="Gillies, p. 124"/&gt;|group= n}} Her extravagant tastes, an accumulation of [[writ]]s from disgruntled theatre managers, an inability to save money, and generous hand-outs to friends and family,&lt;ref&gt;Farson, pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in severe money troubles during the final years of her life.&lt;ref name="FARSON116"/&gt;

===Decline and death===
[[File:Marielloydgrave.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Lloyd's grave in [[Hampstead Cemetery]], London]]
In 1920, Lloyd appeared twice at [[Hendon]] Magistrates Court and gave evidence of the abuse she had suffered from Dillon.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon afterwards, she separated from him and, as a result, became depressed.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  When asked by [[Counsel|prosecutors]] how many times Dillon had assaulted her since Christmas 1919, Lloyd replied "I cannot tell you, there were so many [occasions].  It has happened for years, time after time, always when he is drunk."&lt;ref&gt;Farson, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; By now, she was becoming increasingly unreliable on stage; she appeared at a theatre in Cardiff for a mere six minutes before being carried off by stage hands. During the performance, she seemed dazed and confused, and she stumbled across the stage.  She was conscious of her weak performances and frequently cried between shows. [[Virginia Woolf]] was among the audience at the Bedford Music Hall on 8 April 1921 and described Lloyd as "A mass of corruption – long front teeth – a crapulous way of saying 'desire', and yet a born artist – scarcely able to walk, waddling, aged, unblushing."&lt;ref name="GILLIES271"&gt;Gillies, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1922, Lloyd collapsed in her dressing room after singing "The Cosmopolitan Girl" at the Gateshead Empire in Cardiff. Her doctor diagnosed exhaustion, and she returned to the stage in August.  Her voice became weak, and she reduced her act to a much shorter running time.&lt;ref name=FARSON118&gt;Farson, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Her biographer [[Naomi Jacob]] thought that Lloyd was "growing old, and [she] was determined to show herself to her public as she really was&amp;nbsp;... an old, grey-faced, tired woman".&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 August 1921, Lloyd failed to show for an appearance at the [[London Palladium]], choosing instead to stay at home and write her will.&lt;ref name="GILLIES271"/&gt;{{refn|Lloyd left her brother John £300 and her maid £100. The rest was split between Lloyd's daughter and a group of Hoxton charities.&lt;ref name="GILLIES271"/&gt;|group= n}}

In early 1922, Lloyd moved in with her sister Daisy to save money.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 October, against her doctor's advice,&lt;ref name=FARSON118/&gt; she appeared at the Empire Music Hall in [[Edmonton, London|Edmonton]], North London, where she sang "I'm One of the Ruins That Cromwell Knocked About a Bit".  Her performance was weak, and she was unsteady on her feet, eventually falling over on stage.  Her erratic and brief performance proved hilarious for the audience, who thought that it was all part of the act.&lt;ref&gt;Farson, pp. 119–120&lt;/ref&gt;  Three days later, while appearing at the Alhambra Theatre, she was taken ill on stage and was found later in her dressing room crippled with pain, complaining of stomach cramps.  She returned home later that evening, where she died of heart and kidney failure three days later, aged 52.{{refn|Lloyds death certificate diagnosed  "Nitral Regurgitation – 14 months; Nephritis (an inflammation of the kidneys) – 14 months; and Uraemic Coma – 3 days."&lt;ref&gt;Farson, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}   More than 50,000 people attended her funeral at [[Hampstead Cemetery]] on 12&amp;nbsp;October 1922.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/10/13/107073644.pdf "50,000 Mourn as Marie Lloyd is Buried"], ''The New York Times'', 13 October 1922, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Marie Lloyd Buried", ''The Western Times'', 13 October 1922, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Six [[hearses]] were used to carry the flowers during the funeral procession.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;|group= n}}  Lloyd was penniless at the time of her death and her estate, which was worth £7,334,&lt;ref&gt;"What Marie Lloyd Left", ''Evening Telegraph'', 8 November 1922, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; helped to pay off debts that she and Dillon had incurred over the years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/oct/09/death-of-marie-lloyd "The Death of Marie Lloyd"], ''The Guardian'' (Archive), 22 October 1922&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Dial]]'' magazine the following month, [[T.S. Eliot]] claimed: "Among [the] small number of music-hall performers, whose names are familiar to what is called the lower class, Marie Lloyd had far the strongest hold on popular affection."&lt;ref name="DIAL"/&gt; Her biographer and friend MacQueen-Pope thought that Lloyd was "going downhill of her own volition. The complaint was incurable, some might call it heartbreak, perhaps a less sentimental diagnosis is disillusionment."&lt;ref&gt;Pope, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; The [[impersonator]] Charles Austin paid tribute by saying "I have lost an old pal, and the public has lost its principal stage favourite, one who can never be replaced."&lt;ref&gt;"Miss Marie Lloyd", ''The Sunday Post'', 8 October 1922, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Orbliquet Stort 1.jpg|thumb|350px|The Unofficial Orbliquet Badge 2007.]]

'''Orbliquet''', pronounced Orb-li-kit, is the [[South African]] [[Four Square]].

== Origin ==

Orbliquet is the South African version of the ever-popular game Four Square. Played at St Stithians College and all over the country, it has become one of the most popular break-time games in many schools. Although similar to the English and Australian rules, Orbliquet has its own individuality, namely relegation.

== Aim ==

The game is made up of four ranks: [[King (card)]], [[Queen (card)]], [[Jack (card)]], and Dunce. The aim of the game is for a player to make their way up from Dunce, the lowest ranking position, through Jack and Queen, to King. This is done by killing (eliminating) players who are in a higher rank. Dunce and Jack have no privileges while Queen has the luxury of serving. King, on the other hand, does not get eliminated. King goes down to Dunce when he has been killed, and everyone else moves up. When a player is eliminated, everyone ranked below that player will move up until Dunce is open. An 'Inactive Player' who is waiting in the queue will then take up Dunce.

== Location and Restrictions ==

Four square is played on a square court divided into four smaller squares of equal size. It is preferable to play Orbliquet in a squash court because there are wall which allow the game to become continuous.

The new rules of Orbliquet state that the outside lines of the court are considered in. This means that a ball landing on any portion of an outside line is part of play and therefore playable. The inside lines are considered 'lines', as it can not be determined who is responsible for the ball and balls landing on any portion of an inside line are retaken. 'Obstructions' may be called if an inactive player interferes with game play. Then the round will be restarted.

== Serving ==

Each round of the game begins with the Queen serving the ball. The Queen gets full discretion when it comes to serving and can therefore serve the ball as high, as low or with as much spin as he so chooses. It is up to the receiving player to determine whether or not he would like to return the service. If the ball is caught or missed, the service is retaken, but if the ball is touched, it is considered returned, and if it is not returned properly, the player is eliminated.

== Regular Gameplay ==

The rules are those of Four Square, with the only difference being one can use any part of his or her body, but may only touch the ball once. The game is not customizable; one may not make his own rules.

== Elimination ==

A player is eliminated (killed) when:

* A player hits the ball directly to another player. 
* A player touches the ball twice or longer than a half-second(scoop).
* A player allows the ball to bounce twice in his or her square. 
* A player hits the ball out of bounds.
* A player stops the ball illegally.

== Officiation ==

Orbliquet is entirely self-governed. It is important that the players be honest and fair at all times.

== Relegation ==

If there are more than eight Inactive Players, one may call Relegation into effect. This means there will be two simultaneous Orbliquet games that are interconnected. This means that if Dunce dies in court 1, he is relegated to court 2. He then has to work his way up to King in court 2 and retain the title for more than two rounds before he can be promoted to court one. If King in court 1 dies when he is at Dunce, he does not get relegated. He just joins the end of the court 1 waiting queue. This rule is a good way of increasing the level of gameplay as the Dunce is forced to kill or be relegated.

[[File:Pajatso Forum Marinum.JPG|thumb|right|Early payazzo, possibly from 1920s/30s, on display at the [[Forum Marinum]] maritime museum]]
[[File:Pajatso.JPG|thumb|right|More modern payazzo from the 1980s]]

'''Payazzo''' (or '''pajatso''') is a traditional [[Finland|Finnish]] [[gambling]] [[arcade game]], dating back to the 1920s, when it was introduced into Finland from [[Germany]].  The object of payazzo is to flick a coin into one of the winning slots. When the attempt is successful, the machine rewards the player with a couple of coins. If the attempt is unsuccessful, the player loses the flicked coin.

==Name==

The game is called ''pajatso'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. It is a Fennicized form of ''bajazzo'', the name of the early [[Germany|German]] models. ''Bajazzo'' refers to an Italian-style clown (''pagliaccio'' in Italian). [[Finland's Slot Machine Association]] (Finnish: ''Raha-automaattiyhdistys'' or ''RAY''), the manufacturer of today's payazzo machines, uses ''payazzo'' in English for ''pajatso''.

In Finland the game is often referred to informally as ''Jasso''. The popularity of the nickname was proven as the manufacturer decided to use only the informal form in the names of some models of payazzo combining coin flicking with an electronic game of luck. These models are ''Hedelmäjazzo'' (''Fruit Jazzo'') from the early nineties and ''Komeetta Jasso'' (''The Comet-Jasso''), which is used today. The manufacturer also bought the Finnish domain '''www.jasso.fi''' to redirect traffic to their website.

==Description of a payazzo machine==

Physically, a payazzo machine looks like an [[arcade cabinet]], but it is slightly wider than an ordinary video game arcade cabinet. The front panel of the machine is transparent to allow the player see the flight of the coin.

Behind the transparent front panel there is a vertical playing area that is less than a meter wide and approximately twenty centimeters high (for machines with a single row of winning slots). The thickness of the playing area is slightly more than the thickness of the coin. In the playing area, there are the winning slots, typically nine in modern models, in one row (two rows in some models). The row spans horizontally the entire length of the playing area, and it is slightly below the point where the coin enters the playing area.

A metal ring used to hit the coin is on the right side of the machine (rather than on the front panel) at the height of a typical user's chest. In traditional models, the slot for feeding coins into the machine is on the top of the machine.

In traditional models, also the supply of coins available for paying winnings is visible through the transparent front panel. This way the player can estimate whether there is enough money in the machine to pay potential winnings.

==Description of the game==

The player feeds a coin into the machine and flicks it by hitting a metal ring with a finger. The power of hitting controls the initial speed of the coin; determining the initial speed is the only way the player can control the movement of the coin. The initial flying direction of the coin is constant (to the left and slightly upwards).

The coin enters the playing area from the right side. It [[elastic collision|bounces]] off the edges of the playing area and '''gates''', small obstacles next to the entries to the winning slots.

Eventually the coin either drops into one of the winning slots or it falls down between the slots. The positioning of the gates usually makes the latter possibility more likely. In the former case, the player gets a prize of a couple of coins, and in the latter case the player loses the flicked coin. The size of the prize for each winning slot is printed next to the winning slot, varying from two times the value of the flicked coin to ten or even one hundred times the flicked coin. The most valuable winning slots are in the middle of the playing area, and in modern machines the
most valuable slot has a variable payoff so that the best payoff may not be even in principle achievable with every flick.

==History==

The predecessors of payazzo machines, called ''bajazzo'' machines, were manufactured in Germany in the beginning of the 20th century. The game arrived in Finland in the middle of the 1920s, and Finns started calling it ''pajatso''.

The bajazzo machines differed from payazzo machines. In a bajazzo game, a ball was dropped from the top of the machine and the player attempted to catch it into a hat held by a bajazzo figure. The first true payazzo machine was developed in the Germany in the late 1920s, and it was called '''Blau Wunder'''. In Finland, the name ''pajatso'' was used also for this machine.

It became prohibited to operate payazzos in Finland in 1933, except to raise funds for charity. Since 1937, the state-owned operator of gambling machines, Raha-automaattiyhdistys has a [[government monopoly|monopoly]] for payazzos. The profits of Raha-automaattiyhdistys are distributed to various [[Charitable organization|charity]] organizations who promote public health and social welfare.

Raha-automaattiyhdistys has manufactured payazzos since 1938. The basic structure of payazzo remained the same for a long time, except that the denomination of the coin the game was played with varied due to inflation. It is customary to identify the old machines by announcing the denomination of the coin used to play the game, these old machines include 20 [[Finnish markka|penni]] payazzo (1958), 50 penni payazzo (1967) and one [[Finnish markka|markka]] payazzo (1976).

With the introduction of the 50 penni payazzo, the gates were introduced. By adjusting the gates, the operator of payazzo can control the difficulty of the game more accurately.

The first electronic payazzo was introduced in 1982; older payazzos were completely mechanical. In electronic payazzos, the actual game is played with a real, physical coin, but the electronics are used to determine if the player feeds money into the machine, to register whether a coin falls into a winning slot and to pay winnings to the player. By using the electronics, it was possible program variable winning sums for each slot.

==Today's models==

Nowadays, Raha-automaattiyhdistys operates three models of payazzo machines. The first model is '''Pajatso''', which provides a playing experience similar to the traditional mechanical games. The second model is '''Komeetta Jasso''', which combines the payazzo-style coin flicking with an electronic game of luck. In Komeetta Jasso, the player can also change the winning sums the machine pays by flicking a coin into a designated slot. Both of these models are played with the [[20 cent euro coins|20 cent coin]]. The third model is '''Pajatso RAY''', which is played with coin-like metal disks. In addition to the traditional single-flick game, Pajatso Ray has other games consisting of several flicks.

In Finland, payazzos can be found in special gambling arcades, and also in pubs, restaurants and supermarkets.

==Outside Finland==

During its history, Raha-automaattiyhdistys has exported payazzos into [[Norway]], [[Soviet Union]], [[Hungary]], [[Australia]], [[Netherlands]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Iceland]] and [[Sweden]]. Nowadays, payazzo can be played, in addition to Finland, in [[Chile]], where a local operator uses Finnish electronic payazzos.

==In popular culture==

* In the song ''[[Iisalmi|Iisalmen]] discossa'' [[Juice Leskinen]] sings that he skipped a slow dance while he played payazzo in a [[discotheque]].
* In the song ''Raptori'' the rap group [[Raptori]] sings that they bought their leather jackets at a thrift store after winning a jackpot in payazzo.
* From December 2008 to September 2009, the [[Apple App Store]] contained the coin game entitled "Pajatzo".&lt;ref&gt;http://appshopper.com/games/pajatzo&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Red Barrels Inc.''' is a Canadian [[video game developer]] based in [[Montreal]]. The company was founded by Philippe Morin, David Chateauneuf and Hugo Dallaire in 2011. The three were previously developers for [[Ubisoft Montreal]] and [[EA Montreal]], but founded the company after the origination of an original [[intellectual property]] by Dallaire in 2010. After leaving their respective workplaces, the team's online presence began in July 2012 and a [[Trailer (promotion)#Video game trailers|trailer]] for the game that became ''[[Outlast]]''.

== History ==
Philippe Morin, David Chateauneuf and Hugo Dallaire were originally [[video game developer]]s for [[Ubisoft Montreal]] and were hired in 1997–1998, with Chateauneuf helping develop ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell (video game)|Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell]]'', and Morin and Dallaire developing ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pressa2join.com/developer-focus/taking-risks-and-reaping-rewards-with-outlast-developer-red-barrels |title=Taking Risks and Reaping Rewards With Outlast Developer Red Barrels |first=Paul |last=Policarp |date=August 8, 2016 |website=[[PressA2Join]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morin left Ubisoft Montreal in 2009 and worked for [[EA Montreal]] in 2010 for an original [[intellectual property]] concept by Dallaire, but was cancelled within the same year. With no other options, Morin left in January 2011 to pursue Red Barrels. Chateauneuf remained a part of Ubisoft Montreal and was involved with level design work for the first ''[[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]]'' game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/the-making-of-assassins-creed/ |title=The Making Of: Assassin's Creed |author=Edge Staff |date=March 24, 2013 |website=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327034149/http://www.edge-online.com/features/the-making-of-assassins-creed/ |archivedate=March 27, 2013 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After resigning, Morin met Chateauneuf and Dallaire after the trio left their jobs, agreeing to start their own company. After a technical difficulty with a prior submission, the group acquired {{CAD|300,000|link=yes}} in funding from the [[Canada Media Fund]] during the 2012–2013 [[fiscal year]], and {{CAD|1&amp;nbsp;million|long=no}} in the 2013–2014 year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-11-06-dont-think-of-going-indie-as-romantic-says-outlast-dev |title=Don't think of going indie as romantic, says Outlast dev |first=Brendan |last=Sinclair |date=November 7, 2013 |website=[[GamesIndustry.biz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cmf-fmc.ca/en-ca/news-events/news/july-2012/25-canadian-companies-receive-more-than-$14-millio |title=25 Canadian companies receive more than $14 million for their interactive digital media projects |first=Pierre |last=Campeau |date=July 9, 2012 |website=[[Canada Media Fund]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, the company announced ''[[Outlast]]'', which was released in September 2013. The following October, Morin announced that a sequel, ''[[Outlast 2]]'', was in development. ''Outlast 2'' was released in April 2017. In July that year, the company released the first issue of comic mini-series ''The Murkoff Account'', which was set for five comics detailing the narrative gap between ''Outlast'' and ''Outlast 2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/red-barrels-launches-outlast-horror-comic-series/ |title=Red Barrels launches Outlast horror comic series |first=Joe |last=Donnelly |date=July 18, 2016 |website=[[PC Gamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2745">Theaters of Russian tsars appeared as the 17th century. But only members of the Imperial family and their immediate surroundings could enjoy of this performances.

Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia]] issued a Decree dated August 30, 1756, to establish a public Imperial troupe.&lt;ref name=te&gt;[http://bookz.ru/authors/avtor-neizvesten-3/theatre_encicl/page-266-theatre_encicl.html Theatre encyclopedia ru: Театральная энциклопедия]&lt;/ref&gt; Decree United in one system several different theatre companies, already existing at the time when under the Empire. Even earlier the theatre was given a mansion on Vasilievsky island, which housed a troupe [[Fyodor Volkov]]. The Director of the theatre was appointed [[Alexander Sumarokov]]. Thus arose the Petersburg Imperial troupe.

Gradually this system theatres grew. The troupe was one: drama, ballet and opera. Every actor did what he could.

In 1801 the Moscow Imperial troupe appeared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slovari.yandex.ru/dict/mos/article/mos/19000/52378.htm ru: Энциклопедия «Москва»]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gagarinlib.ru/fonds/articles/zverev/st01.pdf Московская антреприза Михаила Медокса]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Private troupes in Moscow and St. Petersburg were banned until 1882&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dissercat.com/content/organizatsionno-tvorcheskie-problemy-imperatorskikh-teatrov-rossii-vtoroi-poloviny-xix-veka- ru: Организационно-творческие проблемы Императорских театров России второй половины XIX века: реформы 1882 года]&lt;/ref&gt;

Imperial troupe lasted until the Russian revolution of 1917.

Theatres, belonged to the St Petersburg Imperial troupe:
* Home of opera at the edge of Neva (ru: Невская першпектива; on 1742 - 1749)
* the Home of opera near the [[Summer Garden]] (ru: Летний сад; on 1750 - 1763)
* the [[Karl Knipper Theatre|Theatre Free Russian]] or the theatre of Karl Knipper (founded in 1777; in 1783 is bought to imperial treasure; then called the Wooden City Theater (ru: Городской Деревянный театр) — on 1797)
* [[Hermitage Theatre]] (from 1785)
* the Imperial theater in the [[Gatchina Palace]] (to [[Paul I of Russia]], the end of the 18th century)
* [[Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre]] (on 1784 - 1886)
* Imperial theatre of [[Petergof]]
* [[Alexandrinsky Theatre]] (from 1832; then the theatre became dramatic)
* [[Mikhaylovsky Theatre]] (from 1833)
* [[Mariinsky Theatre]] (from 1860)

'''''Show Boat''''' (1959 [[Studio recording|studio cast album]]) is a studio recording of the 1927 musical ''[[Show Boat]]'' by [[Jerome Kern]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]. The album was recorded in the summer of 1959 at the [[Abbey Road Studios|No.1 studio, Abbey Road]], London, and issued by the '[[His Master's Voice]]' label, a subsidiary of [[EMI]], which was run at this time by [[Norman Newell]]. It features a cast that was formed for this recording only; this cast did not perform the show live in any theatre production.

The album features the debut recordings made by [[Shirley Bassey]] for EMI, here she performs two songs in the role of Julie LaVerne. Previously she had successfully recorded at [[Philips Records]] but in 1959 her partner and manager Kenneth Hume arranged a contract with [[EMI]]/[[Columbia Records|Columbia]]. These are also her first recordings made and released in stereo. The album also features the actress [[Dora Bryan]], who appeared in films from the mid-1950s. She was later frequently seen on British television, most recently in the BBC series ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]''.

The album was originally issued in two formats, a long-playing album in mono and stereo and as a two EP set, which featured highlights from the recording. A CD release was issued in mono by the Australian EMI company AXIS in the mid-1990s; it was finally issued in stereo in 2005 on the EMI label ''Classics For Pleasure'' where it appeared on a collection of Jerome Kern compositions such as ''[[Music in the Air]]'' and ''[[Roberta]]'' titled ''Kern - Show Boat etc.''.

==Background==
On October 1, 2012, [[E-40]] announced he would be releasing ''The Block Brochure: Welcome To The Soil'' 4, 5 and 6 on March 26, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horowitz |first=Steven J. |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.21369/title.e-40-the-block-brochure-welcome-to-the-soil-4-5-6-release-date |title=E-40 "The Block Brochure: Welcome To The Soil 4, 5 &amp; 6" Release Date |publisher=HipHop DX |date=2012-10-01 |accessdate=2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 12, 2013, the album covers were revealed for ''The Block Brochure: Welcome To The Soil'' 4, 5 and 6.&lt;ref name="xxlmag1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/06/e-40-reveals-cover-art-for-the-block-brochure-welcome-to-the-soil-parts-4-5-6-2/ |title=E-40 Reveals Cover Art For 'The Block Brochure: Welcome To The Soil' Parts 4, 5 &amp; 6' - XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date=2013-06-12 |accessdate=2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, E-40 explained why he was releasing three albums in one day, saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;"I’m a score and a nickel deep in the game! That’s 25 years with real studio albums on the shelf. If an artist can release two and three mixtapes a year for free, I can release two or three official studio albums a year for money. As an independent artist I do what I want, not what I can. I’m putting out three albums because I’ve got 3 decades of fans that I gotta satisfy. I’ve been through hella different eras of music and I survived successfully! It took William Shakespeare 20 years of experience to write Hamlet! I make Slaps and paint pictures with my raps and I’m in my prime with 25 years of experience. You ain’t gotta like me but you gotta respect me!"&lt;ref name="xxlmag1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In a December 2013, interview with [[HipHopDX]], [[E-40]] spoke about the direction he went on the album, saying: "I just wanna keep it right in the pocket of what they been listening to with a new school twist, but keep the old school twist too. You feel me? So I want to make sure it's the right recipe. The right... When you dip your finger in that sauce, the seasoning is perfect."&lt;ref name="hiphopdx1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Aguilar |first=Andrea |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.2236/title.e-40-considers-releasing-his-book-of-slang-as-a-software-app |title=E-40 Considers Releasing His "Book Of Slang" As A Software App |publisher=HipHop DX |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same interview he spoke about how he decided who he would collaborate with on the album, saying: "You know, a lot of times, we get the beats early. The beat is always first. Us as artists, we like, "This the perfect beat. Do you know who would sound good on here? Big K.R.I.T. and Z-Ro." And I rock with 'em. I got love for 'em, so let's see if they can get on this with me, and that's how it all unfolds."&lt;ref name="hiphopdx1"/&gt;

In a December 2013, interview with ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'', E-40 spoke about the process of recording three album's, saying: "I’m not going to lie, this one was tough to do. To come back with 4, 5 and 6, three albums, it comes to a point where I can do one album standing on my head, easy. I’d probably have it done within three weeks or a month the way I work. ''The Block Brochure'' 4, 5 and 6, it was a trip because I did over a hundred songs and I shaved it all the way down to 42 songs. But I shaved it down because I wanted every song to poke out like nipples. And that’s what it’s doing. Just throw it in and just ride, just have a good time."&lt;ref name="xxlmag2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/12/e-40-says-nobody-tells-stories-in-hip-hop-anymore/ |title=E-40 Says Nobody Tells Stories In Hip-Hop Anymore - XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went on to discuss how long it took to record, saying: "You know, guest appearances help a lot. When you do a song with other artists—’cause everybody wants to hear another artist with their favorite artist—one thing you got make sure is when you take that first verse and that second verse, you got to be a part of the whole song. Whether you on the hook on there talking or repeating the ad-libs, that’s one thing I learned to do over the years. Now just imagine, from March 2010 I dropped ''Revenue Retrievin’: Day Shift'' and ''Night Shift''. Here it is, December 2013. Within that amount of time—just to show you my work progress—within that amount of time I dropped 10 solos and two duos, with me and Too $hort. So that’s 12 albums [from] March 2010 to now when ''The Block Brochure'' 4, 5, and 6 comes out. That’s three and a half years."&lt;ref name="xxlmag2"/&gt;

He also spoke about the deadline for the release date, saying: "You know what’s the trip about it? At the end, I was trying to reach deadline, [and] then I said fuck that, we coming out December 10. Then I finally got stressed out after things was done. Ain’t that a trip? Neck got tight and shit. I’m like, it’s done, it’s turned in, I got my release date. I got my album done and all the covers. Everything is in promotions. But I guess it just caught up with me. But I’m back."&lt;ref name="xxlmag2"/&gt;

He also spoke about some of the features on the album, saying: "I try to do collaborations that a lot of people don’t do. When it’s already predictable it’s not so much of a special song. I got a song with me, Big K.R.I.T. and Z-Ro ["In Dat Cup"]; me, T.I., and Chris Brown ["Episode"]. I never did a song with T.I., I always had love for him. We both had mutual respect for each other but never did one. Never did a song with Chris Brown singing. We did a rap song remix with him with “Function” [and] he killed it, that’s a great song too. My son Droop-E and Work Dirty, first of all they [on] Sick Wid’ It Records—my label—and they also family and always in the studio with me. Decades produced the beat, he family too. That was just one of those moments where it’s, “Lets come with it.” My boy Stressmatic came with the hook, “Yellow Gold.” Soon as he did the hook we was on the case. But that’s what it’s about, doing songs with people like me, Danny Brown and ScHoolboy Q ["All My Niggas"]. Three unique different styles, unorthodox, different voices, doing what everybody else don’t."&lt;ref name="xxlmag2"/&gt; On January 7, 2014, the music video was released for "Turn Up or Burn Up" featuring [[Skeme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2014/01/e-40-f-skeme-turn-up-or-burn-up |title=E-40 f/ Skeme "Turn Up or Burn Up" |publisher=Complex |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

''The Block Brochure: Welcome to the Soil 6'' received generally positive reviews from [[music critic]]s. Ronald Grant of [[HipHopDX]] gave the album three out of five stars, saying "All in all, E-40 has built an entire career out of Hip Hop that’s relatable, yet adventurous, playful and entertainingly repetitious. ''The Block Brochure: Welcome To The Soil'' Parts 4, 5, &amp; 6 continues in that tradition. While it’s a lot to ask of today’s stunted attention spans and isn’t without lapses, ''The Block Brochure'' proves that E-40 is still more ahead of the curve at crafting imaginative Hip Hop music than many new artists can ever hope to be."&lt;ref name="hiphopdx2"/&gt; David Jeffries of [[AllMusic]] gave the album three out of five stars, saying "Although Pt. 6 is the weakest of the three by a bit, featuring highlights with B-Legit ("Mob Shit"), Rick Ross and French Montana ("Champagne"), Gucci Mane and Trinidad James ("Pablo"), plus the great solo E-40 cut "Rep Yo District," which overflows with both hooks and hometown pride. The rest of the disc comes off as fun yet forgettable filler."&lt;ref name="allmusic1"/&gt;

'''The Combine''' was the name given to the association between exhibitor ''Union Theatres'' and the production and distribution company [[Australasian Films]] on 6 January 1913. The Combine had a powerful influence on the Australian film industry of the 1910s and 1920s and was frequently criticised for hampering Australian production by filmmakers such as [[Raymond Longford]].&lt;ref&gt;Graham Shirley and Brian Adams, ''Australian Cinema: The First Eighty Years'', Currency Press 1989 p 32-33&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On 4 March 1911 the firm of Johnson and Gibson merged with J and N Tait to form [[Amalgamated Pictures]]. This company then merged with the General Film Company of Australia, [[West's Pictures]] and [[Charles Cozens Spencer|Spencer's Pictures]] then, in January 1913, Greater J.D. Williams Amusement Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article120355629 |title=AMALGAMATED PICTURES, LIMITED. |newspaper=[[Sunday Times |Sunday Times (Sydney, NSW : 1895 - 1930)]] |location=Sydney, NSW |date=12 April 1914 |accessdate=2 October 2013 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some states the name ''Union Theatres'' remained the recognised name, despite the 'combine' name &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Union Picture Theatres | title=Ten years of progress in the motion picture industry of Australia | publication-date=1921 | publisher=Sydney Union Picture Theatres | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/22426050 | accessdate=18 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Combine dominated the Australian film industry for a number of years and later evolved into the [[Greater Union]] organisation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afcarchive.screenaustralia.gov.au/downloads/policies/early%20history_final1.pdf Early history of Australian Film, ''Screen Australia''] accessed 24 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yat Malmgren''' (28 March 1916 &amp;ndash; 6 June 2002) was a Swedish dancer and acting teacher, born in [[Gävle]], [[Sweden]] to Gustaf Sigurd Eriksson and Signe Emma Maria Malmgren.

Born Gert Olof Sigurd Eriksson, he changed his surname due to a strained relationship with his father, to Malmgren, which was his mother's maiden name. He became known as Yat rather than Gert when he lived in England because of difficulties with the Swedish pronunciation of the letter G.

==Early Life and Performing Career==
At 16 Malmgren intended to become a priest, but was dissuaded by his father. Instead in 1935 he began training as an actor with Julia Hakanson of the Svenska Teatern, and the following year as a dancer with Sven Trop, Ballet Master of the Royal Opera in Stockholm. In 1938 he went to Berlin to train with Eugenie Edwardova, former character dancer with [[Anna Pavlova|Pavlova]], and with Trude Engelhardt of the [[Mary Wigman]] company. While still in training he gave solo recitals throughout Sweden, followed in 1939-40 by solo recitals in Stockholm, Berlin, Warsaw and Paris where he began studying with Mme Preobrajenska. He was awarded the Gold medal at the ''Concours de la Danse'' in Brussels in 1939 and was spotted by [[Kurt Jooss]] who invited him to join Ballets Jooss based at [[Dartington Hall]]. It was here that he first met [[Rudolf Laban]] with whom he later collaborated in developing his theory of Movement Psychology. During the war he toured as a soloist with Ballets Jooss throughout the British Isles, Ireland, Canada, North and South America. He left the company in Buenos Ayres and spent the rest of the war period in Brazil, partnering the ballerina [[Nini Theilade]] in solo recitals and opening a movement school in Rio de Janeiro.

He returned to Europe in 1947 to give recitals in Sweden and Finland with Nini Theilade. In 1948 he was invited to join the International Ballet Company as premier danseur, and continued his training with Judith Espinosa in London, and Mmes Preobrajenska and Egorova in Paris. He appeared as 'the Baron' in ''Gaite Parisienne'' opposite the choreographer [[Massine]], in his old role. A season at Teatro Municipal in Rio de Janeiro with Tatiana Leskova in 1950 was followed by tours throughout Britain and Europe.

In 1954, following a serious injury he was forced to retire as a dancer, and began teaching classes at the International School of Ballet in London. The actor Harold Lang persuaded him to start giving movement classes in the Anna Northcote studio in West Street, [[Covent Garden]], and actors including [[Sean Connery]], [[Diane Cilento]], [[Patricia Neal]], [[Gillian Lynne]], Brian Bedford and [[Anthony Hopkins]] together with directors [[Tony Richardson]], Bill Gaskill, Alexsander Mackendrick and Seth Holt all attended. He worked privately with Sean Connery for a year who appeared in 'Anna Christie' in Oxford, and particularly as Dionysus in [[Euripides]]'s [[the Bacchae]] before his first success as [[James Bond]].

==Teaching career==
Malmgren was a key figure at the [[Drama Centre London]] along with co-founder [[Christopher Fettes (director)|Christopher Fettes]], John and Catherine Blatchley (Clouzot), Harold Lang and Doreen Cannon. His teaching approach drew from the applied psychology of movement developed by Laban. Malmgren's method of character development is concerned with a technique for expressing the inner state of a character through movement, and is a synthesis of Laban's theory of movement expression, [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]]'s character types (published in 1923) and key principles of acting established by [[Constantin Stanislavski]].
Malmgren taught a number of famous actors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Famous Graduates - Drama Centre London|url=http://www.arts.ac.uk/csm/drama-centre-london/graduating-student-and-alumni-profiles/famous-graduates/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fettes|first=Christopher|title=Yat Malmgren|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jun/13/guardianobituaries.obituaries|newspaper=The Guardian|date=June 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Background Information Yat Malmgren|url=http://www.focal.ch/1263/1263.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;   including: [[Sean Connery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sean Connery - Biography|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000125/bio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Connery|first=Sean|title=Being a Scot|publisher=Phoenix|isbn=978-0753826317|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierce Brosnan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pierce Brosnan - Trivia|url=https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000112/trivia}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colin Firth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Margolies|first=Danny|title=Firth class|url=https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000112/trivia|newspaper=Backstage West|date=10 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alison|first=Maloney|title=Colin Firth: The Biography|publisher=Michael O'Mara|isbn=9781843176886|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Hopkins]], [[Andrew Tiernan]], [[Geraldine James]], [[Helen McCrory]], [[Paul Bettany]], [[Russell Brand]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hitchcock|first=Henrietta|title=Russell Brand: From Essex to LA|url=http://www.artslondonnews.com/2013/02/07/russell-brand-essex-to-la/|newspaper=Arts London News|date=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brand|first=Russell|title=My Booky Wook|publisher=Hodder Paperbacks|isbn=978-0340936177|pages=158, 162, 181, 185, 194}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anne-Marie Duff]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kellaway|first=Kate|title=Anne-Marie Duff: 'I wondered if I should lie about my background'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/may/19/anne-marie-duff-shameless-oneill-national|newspaper=The Observer for The Guardian|date=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Simm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drama Centre London - Prospectus 2012/13|url=http://www.arts.ac.uk/media/arts/colleges/csm/drama-centre-london/documents/drama-centre-prospectus-final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sean Harris]], [[Andrew Pleavin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andrew Pleavin - Biography|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0687091/bio}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diane Cilento]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diane Cilento – Post Production Script|url=http://www.australianbiography.gov.au/subjects/cilento/script.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Fassbender]] and [[Tom Hardy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haydock|first=James|title=Tom Hardy-Dark Star Rising|publisher=John Blake Publishing|isbn=9781857826678|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
An article describing the main features of Malmgren's approach to actor training, and bringing these up to date with aspects of contemporary thinking on cognitive science was published in April 2015: Vladimir Mirodan, "Acting the Metaphor - The Laban-Malmgren system of movement psychology and character analysis", Theatre, Dance and Performance Training Journal, Vol. 6, Issue 1. The system is also described in detail in two PhD theses. The first, entitled "The Way of Transformation (The Laban – Malmgren System of Character Analysis)" is by Vladimir Mirodan, Principal of the Drama Centre 2001-2011. This thesis is available online through the [[British Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Mirodan|first=Vladimir|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.285166}}|oclc=557338954|title=The way of transformation (the Laban-Malmgren system of dramatic character analysis)|degree=PhD |year=1997|url=http://copac.jisc.ac.uk/id/9502406?style=html|website=copac.jisc.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second, entitled "The Knowing Body: Meaning and method in Yat Malmgren's actor training technique" is by Janys Hayes and is available through the [[National Library of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Janys, [http://trove.nla.gov.au/version/47600691 "The Knowing Body: meaning and method in Yat Malmgren's actor training technique"], PhD thesis, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Several institutions around the world teach the method developed by Malmgren, which has come to be known as the "Yat" method of character analysis. These institutions include- in London, the [[Drama Centre]], Room One, the [[Giles Foreman Centre for Acting]], where Christopher Fettes continues to teach Yat's method (GFCA also partners with studios in Paris, Luxembourg and Zurich), and [[Central School of Speech and Drama]]; Schott Acting Studio in Berlin; [[Gothenburg University]] - where Yat became an honorary doctor, in Sweden;  Australia's [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]] in Sydney and the [[University of Wollongong]] in New South Wales; and the Yat/Bentley Centre for Performance in the United States and Canada. His work also influences training in Israel, Peru, Iran, Brazil, and Iceland, amongst many others.

'''Yoté''' is a traditional [[Abstract strategy game|strategy]] [[board game]] of [[West Africa]], where it is a popular gambling game due to its fast pace and surprising turnarounds. A player wins by capturing all opposing pieces. Yoté is related to the game [[Choko (game)|Choko]].

==Rules==
The game is played on a 5×6 board, which is empty at the beginning of the game. Each player has twelve pieces ''{{boardgloss|in hand}}''. Players alternate turns, with White moving first. In a move, a player may either:
* Place a piece in hand on any empty cell of the board.
* Move one of their pieces already on the board [[Orthogonality|orthogonally]] to an empty adjacent cell.
* Capture an opponent's piece if it is orthogonally adjacent to a player's piece, by jumping to the empty cell immediately beyond it. The captured piece is removed from the board, and the capturing player removes ''another'' of the opponent's pieces of his choosing from the board.

The player who captures all the opponent's pieces is the winner. The game can end in a draw if both players are left with three or fewer pieces.

===Optional rules===
Yoté is sometimes played using one or more additional rules:
* Captures are never mandatory.
* Multiple successive jumps by a piece in a single turn are permitted. After a multi-jump, the player chooses and removes from the board one piece of the opponent for each piece jumped.
* Capturing entitles the capturing player to a bonus turn.
* A player can jump one of their own pieces; the piece jumped remains {{boardgloss|in play}}.  
* If both players are left with three or fewer pieces, the game immediately ends in a draw.
* If a player to move has no move available, the game ends and the player with the greater number of pieces remaining is the winner.

'''Yummy mummy''' is a slang term used to describe young, attractive and wealthy mothers with rich, high powered husbands.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The term developed in the late 20th century, and was often applied to celebrity mothers such as [[Elizabeth Hurley]]&lt;ref name="I hate yummy - the times" /&gt; or [[Victoria Beckham]],&lt;ref name="daily telegraphy mums depressed" /&gt; who appeared to quickly regain their pre-pregnancy figures after giving birth, and would continue to lead carefree and affluent lifestyles. Episode 13 of [[List of The Nanny episodes#Season 6 (1998/99)|series six]] of ''[[The Nanny]]'' (airing in 1999) was called "The Yummy Mummy". A stereotypical ''yummy mummy'' was described by [[Nirpal Singh Dhaliwal|Nirpal Dhaliwal]] in ''[[The Times]]'' as having an existence "bankrolled by a husband working himself to death in the City, [dressing] in designer outfits... carries the latest must-have bag [and] whose hair and nails are perfectly groomed".&lt;ref name="I hate yummy - the times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dhaliwal|first=Nirpal|title=I hate yummy mummies|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/families/article1271972.ece|accessdate=8 July 2011|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=28 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''yummy mummy'' would have several children and yet remain a "girl-about-town", dressing fashionably and appearing well-groomed and carefree.&lt;ref name="death of the yummy mummy - daily mail"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jenkins|first=Amy|title=Death of the Yummy Mummy: They made us feel so inadequate but at last they're being credit crunched to extinction|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1136923/Death-Yummy-Mummy-They-feel-inadequate-theyre-credit-crunched-extinction.html|accessdate=11 July 2011|newspaper=[[The Daily Mail]]|date=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported in 2008 that celebrity ''yummy mummys'' were contributing to levels of depression in young mothers, making new mothers feel "saggy, baggy and depressed" about their own bodies.&lt;ref name="daily telegraphy mums depressed"&gt;{{cite news|last=Donnelly|first=Laura|title='Yummy mummies' make mothers depressed|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1580472/Yummy-mummies-make-mothers-depressed.html|accessdate=8 July 2011|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
