Agglomeration is a unit operation during which native particles are assembled to form bigger agglomerates, in which the original particle can still be distinguished. &lt;ref name="Handbook of food powders"&gt; B. Cuq, S. Mandato, R. Jeantet, K. Saleh and T. Ruiz, 7 - Agglomeration/granulation in food powder production, In Woodhead Publishing Series in Food Science, Technology and Nutrition, Woodhead Publishing, 2013, Pages 150-177, Handbook of Food Powders.&lt;/ref&gt; Agglomeration can be achieved through processes that use liquid as a binder (wet methods) or methods that do not involve any binder (dry methods).  The liquid used in wet methods can be added directly to the product or via a humid environment.  Using a [[fluidized bed]] dryer and multiple step [[spray drying]] are two examples of wet methods while roller compacting and [[extrusion]] are two examples of dry methods. 

Advantages of agglomeration for food include:

# Dust reduction:  Dust reduction is achieved when the smallest particles (or "fines") in the product are combined into larger particles.
# Improved flow:  Flow improvement occurs as the larger, and sometimes more spherical, particles more easily pass over each other than the smaller or more irregularly-shaped particles in the original material.
# Improved dispersion and/or solubility: Improved dispersion and solubility is sometimes achieved with instantization, in which the solubility of a product allows it to instantly dissolve upon its addition to water.  For a powder to be considered instant it should go through wettability, sinkability, dispersibility, and solubility within a few seconds.&lt;ref name="Fellows"&gt;Fellows, Peter. Food Processing Technology: Principles and Practice. Second ed., CRC Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-fat dry milk and high quality protein powders are good examples of instant powders. 
# Optimized [[bulk density]]: Consistent bulk density is important in accurate and consistent filling of packaging.
# Improved product characteristics&lt;ref name="Feeco"&gt; Feeco International. "The Agglomeration Handbook." http://go.feeco.com/acton/attachment/12345/f-00b2/1/-/-/-/-/Agglomeration-Handbook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
# Increased [[homogeneity]] of the finished product, reducing segregation of fine particles (such as powdered vitamins or spray-dried flavors) from larger particles (such as granulated sugars or acids). As a powder is agitated, smaller particles will fall to the bottom, and larger raise to the top.  Agglomeration can reduce the range of particle sizes present in the product, reducing segregation. 

Disadvantages of food agglomeration:

#  Extra cost.  The benefits of handling an agglomerate often outweigh the extra cost involved in processing. 
#  Additional processing time.  Agglomeration of a finished blend is an additional step after blending.

Particle size distribution is an important parameter to monitor in agglomerated food products.  In both wet and dry agglomeration, particles of undesired sizes must be removed to ensure the best possible finished product performance. High-powered cyclones are the most common way to separate undesired fine particles (or "fines") from larger agglomerates (or "overs"). Cyclones utilize the combination of wind power and the different densities of the two products to pull the fines out of the mix. The fines can then be reworked through the agglomeration process to reduce yield loss. In contrast, shaker screens are often used to separate out the overs from the rest of the product. The overs can be reworked into the process by first being broken into smaller particles.

== Wet agglomeration methods==

Wet agglomeration is a process that introduces a liquid binder to develop adhesion forces between the dry particles to be agglomerated.  Mixing disperses the liquid over the particles evenly and promotes growth of the aggregate to the desired size. A final drying step is required to stabilize the agglomerates&lt;ref name="Handbook of food powders"/&gt;. 

In all wet agglomeration methods, the first step is wetting the particles.  This initiates adhesion forces between the particles.  The next step, nucleation, is the process by which the native particles come together and are held with liquid bridges and capillary forces.  Then, through coalescence or the growth phase, these small groups of particles come together to create larger particles until the particles are the desired size.  Consolidation occurs as the agglomerates increase in density and strength through drying and collisions with other particles.  Mixing as the powder dries also causes some particles to break and erode, creating smaller particles and fines. To achieve the correct particle size, erosion and growth must be balanced. The last step in wet agglomeration is the final stabilization through drying.  The agglomerated particles are dried to less than 5% water content, and cooled to below their glass transition temperature. &lt;ref name="Handbook of food powders"/&gt;

Wet agglomeration falls into to categories based on method of agitation: Mechanical mixing and pneumatic mixing.

=== Pneumatic mixing ===

[[File:Visual_Representation_of_Agglomeration.png|thumb|right|Visual Representation of Agglomeration with pneumatic mixing]]

# Steam-jet agglomeration: A [[continuous process]] wherein fine powders are exposed to steam to provide the necessary adhesion properties.  Agglomeration is controlled by particle size distribution in the raw materials, gas and steam flow conditions and the adhesion forces between the particles. After the steam section the particles are exposed to warm air flowing upwards and countercurrent to the particles, which solidifies the liquid bridges formed between the particles. Advantages: used for many years in the food industry, a continuous process 
#Spray drying: Spray drying starts with a liquid raw material which is sprayed as fine droplets into heated air which causes the droplets to dry into fine particles. To agglomerate, fully dried particles (collected from the dry air outlet) are re-introduced at the point where the particles are partly dried and still sticky, to collide and create porous agglomerates.  Spray drying agglomeration creates irregularly shaped, highly porous particles with excellent instant properties. &lt;ref name="Handbook of food powders" /&gt;
#Fluid bed agglomeration uses an air stream to both agitate the particles and to dry the agglomerates.  Fluidized bed dryers are hot-air driers in which the air is forced up through a layer of product. The air is evenly distributed along the chamber to maintain a uniform velocity and prevent areas of higher velocities. These dryers can either be batch or continuous. [[Batch processing]] methods tend to have more uniform moisture content throughout the product after drying whereas continuous driers vary more throughout the process and may require a finishing set. &lt;ref name="Fellows2"&gt;Fellows, Peter. Food Processing Technology: Principles and Practice. Second ed., CRC Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; When used for agglomeration, fluidized bed dryers have spray nozzles located at various heights within the chamber, allowing a spray of water or a solution of other ingredients (the binding solution) to be sprayed on the particles as they are fluidized.  This encourages the particles to stick together, and can impart other properties to the finished product.  Examples of binding solutions are a water/sugar solution, or lecithin.  In this method, particle wetting, growth, consolidation, erosion and drying all occur at the same time.[[File:Agglomeration_via_spray_dry.svg|thumb|Basic diagram that describes the process of creating agglomerated particles via spray dry principles.]][[File:Diagram_of_a_Fluid_Bed_Agglomerator.png|thumb|right|Diagram of a Fluid Bed Agglomerator]]

=== Mechanical mixing ===

[[File:Visual_Representation_of_Wet_Granulation.png|thumb|right|Visual Representation of the Wet Granulation Process in Mechanical Mixing]]

# Pan or disk agglomerators (rarely used for food powders): Pan or disk agglomerators use the rotation of a disk or bowl to agitate the powder as it is sprayed with water.  This type of agglomeration creates agglomerates with higher density than agglomerates produced in fluidized beds. &lt;ref name="Handbook of food powders"/&gt;
# Drum agglomerators: use a drum to agitate the powder as liquid is added via spraying along the drum.  This is a continuous process, and the agglomerates are spherical due to the rotation of the drum.  Advantages: can successfully agglomerate powders with a wide particle size distribution, and have lower energy needs than fluidized bed agglomerators.  Drum agglomerators can handle very large capacities, but this is not an advantage in the food industry.  Disadvantage: broad particle size distribution.&lt;ref&gt; Le Capitaine, Shane, and Craig Peppin. “Rotary Dryer or Fluid Bed Dryer.” FEECO International Inc., 19 July 2017, feeco.com/rotary-dryer-or-fluid-bed-dryer/.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Mixer agglomeration: Mixer agglomerators agitate the powder with the use of a blade inside a bowl.  The geometry of mixer agglomerators vary widely.  The blade can be oriented vertically, horizontally or obliquely.  Shear is variable, and the wetting solution is sprayed over the bulk of the powder as it is mixing.  Advantages: can work with powders of large particle size distribution, and allow for good distribution of viscous liquids. Equipment is straight forward and common.  This type of agglomeration results in relatively dense and spherical agglomerates. &lt;ref name="Handbook of food powders"/&gt;

== Dry agglomeration methods ==

Dry agglomeration is agglomeration performed without water or binding liquids, instead using compression only.  

=== Roller compaction ===
[[File:Schematic_of_a_Roller_Compaction_System_Patent_US7998505B2.png|thumb|right|Schematic of a Roller Compactor, Patent US7998505B2, Figure 3]]Roller compaction is a process in which powders are forced between two rolls, which compress the powders into dense sticks or sheets.  These sticks or sheets are then ground into granules. &lt;ref name="Feeco" /&gt; Material properties will affect the mechanical properties of the resulting granules.  Food particles with crystalline structures will deform plastically under pressure, and amorphous materials will deform viscoelastically.&lt;ref name="Handbook of food powders" /&gt;  Roller compaction is more commonly used on individual ingredients of a finished powdered food product, than on a blend of ingredients producing a granulated finished product.

Some advantages of roller compaction are 
# No need for binding solution 
# Dust-free powders are possible 
# Consistent granule size and bulk density. 
# Good option for moisture and heat-sensitive materials, as no drying is required &lt;ref&gt;http://www.welchdry.com/rollercompaction.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Disadvantages: 
# May not be easily soluble in cold water due to high density and low porosity
# High amount of fines which need to be re-worked may be produced
# Specialized equipment is required, typically with large batch sizes (&gt; 3k pounds)

Examples of agglomerated food powders: Sucrose, sodium chloride, monosodium glutamate and fibers. &lt;ref name="Handbook of food powders"/&gt;
[[File:Roller compaction samples.jpg|thumb|Roller-compacted sheets and powder after milling]]

=== Extrusion ===
Extrusion is executed by mixing the powder with liquid, additives, or dispersants and then compressing the mixture and forcing it through a die.  The product is then dried and broken down to the desired particle size. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dhanalakshmi, K., et al. “Agglomeration of Food Powder and Applications.” Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition, vol. 51, no. 5, 2011, pp. 432–441., doi:10.1080/10408391003646270.&lt;/ref&gt; . Extruded powders are dense. &lt;ref name="Handbook of food powders"/&gt;  Extrusion is typically used for ingredients such as minerals and highly-hygroscopic products which benefit from reduced surface area, as well as products that are subject to oxidation. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   Extrusion for agglomeration should not be confused with the more common [[food extrusion]] process that involves creating a dough that is cooked and expands as it passes through the die.

[[File:Air-tractor1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=|The air-tractor sledge in 1912]]
Sir Douglas Mawson's '''air-tractor sledge''' was a converted [[fixed-wing aircraft]] taken on the 1911–14 [[Australasian Antarctic Expedition]], the first plane to be taken to the [[Antarctic]].&lt;ref name="Bickel p. 39"&gt;Bickel (2000), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Expedition leader [[Douglas Mawson]] had planned to use the [[Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane]] as a reconnaissance and [[search and rescue]] tool, and to assist in publicity, but the aircraft crashed heavily during a test flight in [[Adelaide]], Australia, only two months before Mawson's scheduled departure date. The plane was nevertheless sent south with the expedition, after having been stripped of its wings and metal sheathing from the fuselage. Engineer [[Frank Bickerton]] spent most of the 1912 winter working to convert it to a [[sledge]], fashioning brakes from a pair of geological drills and a steering system from the plane's [[landing gear]]. It was first tested on 15&amp;nbsp;November 1912 and subsequently assisted in laying depots for the summer sledging parties, but its use during the expedition was minimal.

Towing a train of four sledges, the air-tractor accompanied a party led by Bickerton to explore the area to the west of the expedition's base at [[Cape Denison]]. The freezing conditions resulted in the jamming of the engine's pistons after just {{convert|10|mi}}, and the air-tractor was left behind. Some time later it was dragged back to Cape Denison, and its frame was left on the ice when the expedition returned home in 1913. In 2008 a team from the [[Mawson's Huts|Mawson's Huts Foundation]] began searching for the remains of the air-tractor sledge; a seat was found in 2009, and fragments of the tail assembly a year later.

The Mawson's Huts Foundation has undertaken extensive investigation using sophisticated equipment in 2009 and 2010.  Results indicate that the air tractor, or parts of it, is still buried under 3m of ice where it was abandoned at Cape Denison.

== Background ==
[[Douglas Mawson]] had accompanied [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s 1907–09 [[Nimrod Expedition|British Antarctic Expedition]]. Along with [[Edgeworth David]] and [[Alistair Mackay]], he had been part of a [[Manhauling|man-hauled]] sledging expedition, the first to reach the area of the [[South Magnetic Pole]]. Upon his return from Antarctica, he recommenced to his post as geology lecturer at the [[University of Adelaide]].&lt;ref name="ADB"&gt;{{cite web

He approached Shackleton, who not only approved of his plan but was prepared to lead the expedition himself.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh pp. 37-38"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; Although Shackleton withdrew from the expedition in December 1910, he continued to assist Mawson with publicity and fund-raising.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh pp. 38-40"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 38–40&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Purchase ===
Mawson travelled to Britain in early 1911 to raise funds, hire crew, and purchase equipment.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 41"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; He considered taking a [[aeroplane|plane]] to the Antarctic, which could work as a reconnaissance tool, transport cargo, and assist with search and rescue. Crucially, as no plane had yet been taken to the continent, it could also be used to generate publicity.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 45"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Unsure of the type of plane he should take, but considering a [[Blériot Aéronautique|Blériot]], Mawson mentioned his plans to Scott's wife [[Kathleen Scott]], an aircraft enthusiast. She recommended he take a [[monoplane]], and conveyed his interest to Lieutenant [[Hugh Evelyn Watkins]] of the [[Essex Regiment]]. Watkins had connections with the ship and aircraft manufacturer [[Vickers Limited]], which had recently entered into a licence agreement to build and sell aircraft in Britain designed by the Frenchman [[Robert Esnault-Pelterie]].&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 49"&gt;Ayres (1999), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burke p. 210"&gt;Burke (1994), p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Mawson on 18 May, Kathleen wrote:

[[File:Mawson's plane 2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|The plane in testing, before being shipped to Australia]]

{{quote|I believe I can help you about aeroplanes. I think you can do far better than a Bleriot&amp;nbsp;... There is a machine that the Vickers people have bought which is infinitely more stable, heavier and more solid and will carry more weight. Its cost is £1000, but I think it could be worked to get it for £700 or even less&amp;nbsp;... A man I know who had only before driven biplanes, drove it and it stayed up half an hour, which speaks very well for its stability&amp;nbsp;... If you think it's worth considering, I can let you meet the man concerned early next week and he can show you the machine and take you up in it.&lt;ref name="Ayres pp. 49-50"&gt;Ayres (1999), pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On Kathleen Scott's advice, Mawson purchased a [[Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane]], one of only eight built.{{refn|Bethany Robinson (2004) suggests the British aviator [[Claude Grahame-White]] may also have assisted Mawson with the choice of the Vickers.&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 71"&gt;Robinson (2004), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the eight monoplanes was designated a number. As the second monoplane built, Vickers assigned Mawson's plane the designation "No.&amp;nbsp;2". However, the original "No.&amp;nbsp;1" monoplane crashed, and Vickers redesignated Mawson's plane "No.&amp;nbsp;1" before it was shipped to Australia.&lt;ref name="Henderson p. 32"&gt;Henderson (2010), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}}&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 71"/&gt; It was fitted with a five-cylinder R.E.P. engine developing {{convert|60|hp}}, and had a maximum range of {{convert|300|mi}} at a cruising speed of {{convert|48|kn}}.&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 71"/&gt; Its wingspan was {{convert|47|ft}}, and its length {{convert|36|ft}}. The pilot used a [[joystick]] for pitch and roll, with lateral control by [[wing warping]]. Mawson opted for a two-seater version, in a tandem arrangement, with a spare ski undercarriage.&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 50"&gt;Ayres (1999), p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; The total bill, dated 17 August 1911, came to [[£sd|£]]955&amp;nbsp;4s&amp;nbsp;8d.{{refn|Updated value £{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|955|1911|r=-3}}}} using the [[Retail Price Index]].&lt;ref name="Measuring Worth"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Plane crash (air-tractor).jpg|thumb|left|alt=|The wreckage of the plane after it crashed at [[Cheltenham Park Racecourse|Cheltenham Racecourse]] in Adelaide]]

=== Crash ===
A series of public demonstrations were planned in Australia to assist in fund-raising, the first of which was scheduled for 5 October 1911 at the [[Cheltenham Park Racecourse|Cheltenham Racecourse]] in Adelaide.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 49"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; During a test flight the day before, excessive pressure in the [[fuel tank]] caused it to rupture, almost blinding Watkins. That problem resolved, Watkins took [[Frank Wild]], whom Mawson had hired to command a support base during the expedition, on another test flight the morning of the demonstration.&lt;ref name="Ayres pp. 55-56"&gt;Ayres (1999), pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; In Watkins' account, which he addressed to Vickers' Aviation Department, he wrote: "[we were] about 200 ft. up. I got into a fierce tremor, and then into an air pocket, and was brought down about 100 ft., got straight, and dropped into another, almost a vacuum. That finished it. We hit the ground with an awful crash, both wings damaged, one cylinder broken, and the Nose bent up, the tail in half, etc."&lt;ref name="Ayres pp. 55-56"/&gt;

Although the two men were only slightly injured, the plane was damaged beyond repair. Mawson decided to salvage the plane by converting it into a motorised [[sledge]]. He fitted the skis, and removed the wings and most of the sheathing to save weight.&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 71"/&gt; In his official account of the expedition, ''The Home of the Blizzard'', Mawson wrote that the advantages of this "air-tractor sledge" were expected to be "speed, steering control, and comparative safety from [[crevasse]]s owing to the great length of the runners".&lt;ref name="Mawson p. 243"&gt;Mawson (1996), p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; No longer needing a pilot, and believing him to be responsible for the crash, Mawson dismissed Watkins.&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 56"&gt;Ayres (1999), p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 50"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

The air-tractor sledge was taken to Hobart, where the expedition ship [[SY Aurora|SY ''Aurora'']] was being loaded. It was secured on board in a crate lined with [[tin]], which weighed far more than the sledge itself, on top of the ship's [[forecastle]] and two boat-skids.&lt;ref name="Mawson p. 11"&gt;Mawson (1996), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 56"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; To fuel the sledge, along with the [[Launch (boat)|motor launch]] and the [[wireless]] equipment, the ''Aurora'' also carried {{convert|4000|impgal|L}} of [[Petroleum ether|benzine]] and {{convert|1300|impgal|L}} of [[kerosene]].&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh pp. 55-56"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; Fully loaded, the ship left Hobart on 2 December 1911.&lt;ref name="Mawson p. 13"&gt;Mawson (1996), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Aurora'' reached the Antarctic mainland on 8 January 1912, after a two-week stop on [[Macquarie Island]] to establish a wireless relay station and research base.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 59"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition's main base was established in [[Adélie Land]], at [[Cape Denison]] in [[Commonwealth Bay]].{{refn|During the voyage south, Mawson consolidated the planned third base into his own main base; the remaining [[Western Base party]], under Wild, was established on the [[Shackleton Ice Shelf]].&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 62"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition party at Cape Denison later discovered their base was situated at one of the windiest places on earth;&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 49" /&gt; Mawson later wrote that he was "quite sure that anybody who had been out in [the wind] for a few minutes would gladly exchange for hell."&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 86"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}}&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 62"/&gt; While the ''Aurora'' was unloading, a violent [[Whirlwind (atmospheric phenomenon)|whirlwind]] lifted the {{convert|300|lb|adj=on}} lid off the air-tractor's crate, throwing it {{convert|50|yd}}. The main hut was erected immediately, but the strong winds meant that work on the air-tractor's hangar was delayed until March.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 69"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; When the winds abated, a {{convert|10|ft|adj=on}} by {{convert|35|ft|adj=on}} hangar was constructed next to the main hut, from empty packing cases.&lt;ref name="Burke p. 210"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 71"/&gt;

Bickerton began work on the air-tractor sledge on 14 April 1912.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 80"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; His first job was to repair the sledge, which had been damaged in transit when a violent storm hit the ''Aurora''. A giant wave had slammed into the crate containing the sledge, driving the fuselage {{convert|4|ft}} through its side.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh pp. 56–57"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt; With the repair completed, Bickerton began the serious work of converting the plane into a sledge. He constructed brakes from a pair of geological drills, and a steering system from the landing gear. Bickerton painted the engine and fuel tank black to absorb heat better and protect them from freezing.&lt;ref name="Robinson pp. 72-73"&gt;Robinson (2004), pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; By June he had the engine running properly, and during a lull in the winds in early September he fitted the skis.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 93"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, he raised the fuselage {{convert|5|ft}} off the ground to allow the propeller free movement.&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 72"&gt;Robinson (2004), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Air-tractor in motion.jpg|thumb|left|alt=|The air-tractor sledge in motion]]

On 27 October 1912, Mawson outlined the summer sledging program. Seven sledging parties would depart from Cape Denison, surveying the coast and interior of Adélie Land and neighbouring [[King George V Land]]. They were required to return to the base by 15 January, when the ''Aurora'' was due to depart; any later, it was feared, and she would be trapped by ice. Bickerton was to lead one of the parties, which would use the air-tractor to haul four sledges and explore the coast to the west of the hut. Most of the parties left in early November, but Bickerton's Western party delayed until December, in the hope of avoiding the ferocious winter winds.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh pp. 98-99"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 98–99&lt;/ref&gt; Work on the air-tractor sledge was delayed by the fierce winds, and the first trial took place on 15 November, between the main base and Aladdin's Cave—a depot which had been established on the plateau above Cape Denison.&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 72"/&gt; The air-tractor reached a speed of {{convert|20|mph}}, covering the {{convert|5|mi}}, expedition member [[Charles Francis Laseron|Charles Laseron]] recorded, "in great style".&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burke pp. 210-211"&gt;Burke (1994), pp. 210–211&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, the sledge began hauling cargo up the slope, laying depots for the summer sledging parties.&lt;ref name="Robinson p. 72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Henderson p. 30"&gt;Henderson (2010), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Broken ===
The Western party left Cape Denison on 3 December 1912.&lt;ref name="Burke p. 211"&gt;Burke (1994), p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Accompanying Bickerton and the air-tractor were cartographer [[Alfred Hodgeman]] and surgeon [[Leslie Whetter]].&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 99"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; The air-tractor made slow progress hauling its train of sledges, and about {{convert|10|mi}} out from the base its engine began experiencing difficulty.&lt;ref name="Burke p. 211"/&gt; Bickerton shut it down and the three set up camp. At 4&amp;nbsp;am the next morning the party set off again,&lt;ref name="Mawson p. 243"/&gt; but the engine continued to struggle; oil ejected from an idle cylinder and the cylinder's lack of compression led Bickerton to suspect broken [[piston ring]]s to be the root of the problem. This would take only a matter of hours to fix. As he later recorded, "These thoughts were brought to a sudden close by the engine, without any warning, pulling up with such a jerk that the propeller was smashed. On moving the latter, something fell into the oil in the crank-case and fizzled, while the propeller could only be swung through an angle of about 30&amp;nbsp;[degrees]."&lt;ref name="Henderson pp. 30-31"&gt;Henderson (2010), pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

The party continued without the air-tractor, man-hauling the sledges to a point {{convert|158|mi}} west of Cape Denison, and returned to base on 18 January 1913.&lt;ref name="Mawson p. 246"&gt;Mawson (1996), p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 149"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Mawson's [[Far Eastern Party]] failed to return, and six men, including Bickerton, remained for an extra winter. On 8 February, just hours after ''Aurora'' left Commonwealth Bay after waiting for three weeks, Mawson staggered alone into base, his colleagues [[Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis]] and [[Xavier Mertz]] dead.{{refn|The party had used [[sledge dog]]s to explore the land beyond the [[Mertz Glacier|Mertz]] and [[Ninnis Glacier]]s to the east of Cape Denison. {{convert|310|mi}} from base, Ninnis and the sledge he was walking beside were lost when they broke through the lid of a crevasse. Their supplies severely compromised, Mawson and Mertz struggled back west, using the remaining sledge dogs to supplement their scarce rations. About {{convert|100|mi}} from Cape Denison, Mertz succumbed to the combined effects of starvation and food poisoning; the dogs' livers contained dangerously high levels of [[vitamin A]].&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; Mawson pushed on alone, and reached base in very poor health; much of the skin on his lower body had peeled off, his hair was falling out, and he was experiencing digestive problems.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 154"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Aurora'' had arrived in Commonwealth Bay on 13 January 1913 and waited for the sledging parties to return. However, her master, [[John King Davis]], was concerned about the encroaching ice, and left for Wild's party on 8 February.&lt;ref name="Ayres pp. 86-87"&gt;Ayres (1999), pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}}&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 145"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 151"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; As Mawson was being nursed back to health, Bickerton dragged the air-tractor sledge back to base to diagnose the reason for its failure. He found that the freezing conditions had caused the [[Motor oil|engine oil]] to congeal, jamming the pistons.&lt;ref name="Robinson pp. 72-73"/&gt; He abandoned the sledge at Boat Harbour, next to the base. When ''Aurora'' returned to Cape Denison for the final time on 13&amp;nbsp;December 1913, only the engine and propeller were taken back to Australia.&lt;ref name="Henderson p. 31"&gt;Henderson (2010), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 171"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recovery efforts ==
[[File:Air-tractor 1931.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|The frame of the air-tractor in 1931]]
The bill for the plane remained unpaid. In 1914 Vickers reminded Mawson, who had apparently forgotten the outstanding debt. Mawson wrote to Vickers director [[Trevor Dawson|Sir Trevor Dawson]] in November 1916, requesting the company write off the bill as a donation. His company buoyed by armaments contracts, Dawson agreed.&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 119"&gt;Ayres (1999), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The next expedition to take a plane to the Antarctic was Shackleton's 1921–22 [[Shackleton–Rowett Expedition|''Quest'' Expedition]], but the [[Avro Baby]] remained grounded owing to missing parts.&lt;ref name="Fisher and Fisher, p. 452"&gt;Fisher and Fisher (1957), p. 452&lt;/ref&gt; Not until 16&amp;nbsp;November 1928—when [[Hubert Wilkins]] and [[Carl Ben Eielson]] flew for 20&amp;nbsp;minutes around [[Deception Island]], just over a year before Admiral [[Richard Evelyn Byrd]]'s first flight over the South Pole—was a plane airborne in the Antarctic.&lt;ref name="Burke p. 34"&gt;Burke (1994), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burke pp. 60-63"&gt;Burke (1994), pp. 60–63&lt;/ref&gt;

The frame of the air-tractor sledge remained on the ice at Boat Harbour where Bickerton had left it. The last expedition to Cape Denison to see the frame was in 1976; the next expedition, in 1981, could find no trace of it. The ice in that location does not move, and the implication is that the frame sank through the ice.  It is therefore possible the frame is still there.

In 2007-8 a team from the [[Mawson's Huts|Mawson's Huts Foundation]] began to search for the remnants of the plane. Using photographs from 1913, 1931 and 1976 it was possible to derive transits between the frame and distant objects which located the frame to a small area of ice about 50 m from the hut.  Comparison with a 1931 photograph by Frank Hurley confirmed this location.

The following summer (2008–9), the team extensively surveyed the area where they believed the air-tractor to be, using [[ground-penetrating radar]].  A 3 metre deep trench was dug in a promising area, but nothing was found except fragments of seaweed indicating the overlying ice must have melted sometime in the past. Temperature records from the nearby [[Dumont d'Urville Station]] showed that there had been extended periods (each of about six weeks) of above average temperatures in 1976 and 1981, suggesting the ice around the harbour could have melted.&lt;ref name="Henderson p. 31"/&gt; Dr Chris Henderson, the leader of the team, believes "the frame sank in situ to the rock surface, three metres below the present ice surface".&lt;ref name="Henderson p. 31"/&gt;

Next year (the 2009–10 season) further search was undertaken using [[differential GPS]], [[bathymetry]] equipment, ice [[auger(drill)|auger]]s, a magnetometer and a metal detector (whose sensor was placed down the ice auger holes after drilling).&lt;ref name="Henderson pp. 31-32"&gt;Henderson (2010), pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; The ice showed signs of having extensively melted in the past, was about 3 metres thick and covering smooth rock which extended Northwards to become the harbour bottom.  Visual examination of the harbour bottom during the bathymetry survey did not reveal any fragments of the frame in the first 30 metres of the harbour.

The most significant findings from the ice survey were a positive reading from the metal detector, coupled with a significant echo from the Ground Penetrating Radar, both from the small area where the frame is assumed to have sunk.&lt;ref name="Henderson p. 32" /&gt;

Parts of the Air Tractor are already known to exist: The Australian Antarctic Division has one wheel from the frame, and its ice-rudder – both of which were found in the harbour.  In January 2009 the remains of a seat from the air-tractor were found in rocks near the hut, about {{convert|200|m}} from where the team believes the frame to be buried.&lt;ref name="Henderson p. 32"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC 21/1/2009"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate= 2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 January 2010, a day of unusually low tide, 4 small capping pieces from the end section of the tail were found by the edge of the harbour. The tail and a section of fuselage had been removed from the rest of the air-tractor before it was abandoned in 1913, therefore this discovery did not shed much light on the location of the rest of the frame, but it suggests that "the frame, or parts of it, can survive for nearly 100&amp;nbsp;years in this environment".&lt;ref name=" Henderson p. 32"/&gt;

The team returned to Cape Denison over the 2010–11 summer, but the crash of a French helicopter near Dumont d'Urville Station in October 2010 forced deployment of a much reduced team with no resources to continue the search.&lt;ref name="ABC 5/1/2011"&gt;{{cite web

|date= 2011-01-05
|accessdate= 2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The findings to date (2011) suggest that metal object(s) exist at a depth of 3 metres, on rock, in the location where the frame was last known to have been seen in 1976.  This is likely to be the remains of Mawson's Air Tractor, but confirmation awaits a future opportunity.

==Life==

He was born on 12 October 1816 in [[Edinburgh]], the son of [[Robert Bryson]] [[FRSE]] (1778-1852), a watchmaker, and Janet Gillespie (1788-1858). 

He attended the High School in Edinburgh then trained as a watchmaker and entered the family business, then renamed Robert Bryson &amp; Son.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

His first wife, Elizabeth Waterstone Gillespie (possibly a cousin) bore him two children who died in infancy, and a daughter and son ([[William Alexander Bryson]]) and died 10 April 1855 aged 44.

His second wife, Catherine McDonald Cuthbertson, also died young in September 1859, aged only 32, after bearing him another son.

His third wife, Jane Thomson, bore him another son, Leonard Horner Bryson, survived him and remarried.

He was President of the Royal Scottish Society of Antiquarians 1860-1861. He was President of the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh in 1863. He was also a member of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh and the Edinburgh Geological Society.

In 1858 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. He was President of the [[Royal Scottish Society of the Arts]] 1860-61.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rssa.org.uk/history/past-presidents.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on 7 December 1866 at  [[Hawkhill House]], a country villa between [[Leith]] and [[Edinburgh]]. He is buried in [[New Calton Cemetery]] with his two wives next to his parents.

The '''Allen Mouse and Human Brain Atlases''' are projects within the [[Allen Institute for Brain Science]] which seek to combine [[genomics]] with [[neuroanatomy]] by creating [[gene expression]] maps for the mouse and human brain. They were initiated in September 2003 with a $100 million donation from [[Paul Allen|Paul G. Allen]] and the first atlas went public in September 2006.&lt;ref name="AalokMehta2006"&gt;{{cite news |first=Aalok |last=Mehta |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=First-Ever Brain 'Atlas' Completed |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/09/060926-brain-atlas.html |work=[[National Geographic News]] |publisher= |date=26 September 2006 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{As of|May 2012}}, seven [[brain atlas]]es have been published: Mouse Brain Atlas, Human Brain Atlas, Developing Mouse Brain Atlas, Developing Human Brain Atlas, Mouse Connectivity Atlas, Non-Human Primate Atlas, and Mouse Spinal Cord Atlas.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} There are also three related projects with data banks: Glioblastoma, Mouse Diversity, and Sleep.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} It is the hope of the Allen Institute that their findings will help advance various fields of science, especially those surrounding the understanding of neurobiological diseases. The atlases are free and available for public use online.

==History==
In 2001, Paul Allen gathered a group of scientists, including [[James D. Watson|James Watson]] and [[Steven Pinker]], to discuss the future of neuroscience and what could be done to enhance neuroscience research (Jones 2009). During these meetings David Anderson from the [[California Institute of Technology]] proposed the idea that a three-dimensional atlas of gene expression in the mouse brain would be of great use to the neuroscience community. The project was set in motion in 2003 with a 100 million dollar donation by Allen through the [[Allen Institute for Brain Science]]. 
The project used a technique for mapping gene expression developed by Gregor Eichele and colleagues at the [[Max Planck]] Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Goettingen, Germany. The technique uses colorimetric [[in situ hybridization]] to map gene expression. The project set a 3-year goal of finishing the project and making it available to the public.

An initial release of the first atlas, the mouse brain atlas, occurred in December 2004. Subsequently, more data for this atlas was released in stages. The final genome-wide data set was released in September 2006. However, the final release of the atlas was not the end of the project; the Atlas is still being improved upon. Also, other projects including the human brain atlas, developing mouse brain, developing human brain, mouse connectivity, non-human primate atlas, and the mouse spinal cord atlas are being developed through the Allen Institute for Brain Science in conjunction with the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas.

==Goals for the project==
[[File:Allen Institute Logo.jpg|thumb|right|Allen Institute for Brain Science]]
The overarching goal and motto for all Allen Institute projects is "fueling discovery". The project strives to fulfill this goal and advance science in a few ways. First, they create brain atlases to better understand the connections between genes and brain functioning. They aim to advance the research and knowledge about neurobiological conditions such as [[Parkinson's]], [[Alzheimer's]], and [[Autism]] with their mapping of gene expression throughout the brain. 
The Brain Atlas projects also follow the "Allen Institute" motto with their open release of data and findings. This policy is also related to another goal of the Institute: collaborative and multidisciplinary research. Thus, any scientist from any discipline is able to look at the findings and take them into account while designing their own experiments. Also available to the public is the Brain Explorer application.

==Research techniques==
The [[Allen Institute for Brain Science]] uses a project-based philosophy for their research. Each brain atlas focuses on its own project, made up of its own team of researchers. To complete an atlas, each research team collects and synthesizes brain scans, medical data, genetic information and psychological data. With this information, they are able to construct the 3-D biochemical architecture of the brain and figure out which proteins are expressed in certain parts of the brain. To gather the needed data, scientists at the Allen Institute use various techniques. One technique involves the use of postmortem brains and brain scanning technology to discover where in the brain genes are turned on and off. Another technique, called [[in situ hybridization]], or ISH, is used to view gene expression patterns as in situ hybridization images.

Within the Brain Atlases, these 3-D ISH digital images and graphs reveal, in color, the regions where a given gene is expressed. In the Brain Explorer, any gene can be searched for and selected resulting in the in situ image appearing as an easily manipulated and explored fashion. Part of the creation of this anatomy-centred database of gene expression, includes aligning ISH data for each gene with a three-dimensional coordinate space through registration with a reference atlas created for the project.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Lein, [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v445/n7124/full/nature05453.html "Genome-wide atlas of gene expression in the adult mouse brain"], ''Nature'', 6 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions to neuroscience==
The different types of cells in the central nervous system originate from varying [[gene expression]]. A map of gene expression in the brain allows researchers to correlate forms and functions. The Allen Brain Atlas lets researchers view the areas of differing expression in the brain which enables the viewing of neural connections throughout the brain. Viewing these pathways through differing gene expression as well as functional imaging techniques permits researchers to correlate between gene expression, cell types, and pathway function in relation to behaviors or phenotypes.

Even though the majority of research has been done in mice, 90% of genes in mice have a counterpart in humans. This makes the Atlas particularly useful for modeling neurological diseases. The gene expression patterns in normal individuals provide a standard for comparing and understanding altered phenotypes. Extending information learned from mouse diseases will help better the understanding of human neurological disorders. The atlas can show which genes and particular areas are effected in neurological disorders; the action of a gene in a disease can be evaluated in conjunction with general expression patterns and this data could shed light on the role of the particular gene in the disorder.

==Brain explorer==
The Allen Brain Atlas website contains a downloadable 3-D interactive Brain explorer. The explorer is essentially a search engine for locations of gene expression; this is particularly useful in finding regions that express similar genes. Users can delineate networks and pathways using this application by connecting regions that co-express a certain gene. [[File:Allen Brain Explorer.jpg|thumb|right|Allen Brain Atlas Image]] The explorer uses a multicolor scale and contains multiple planes of the brain that let viewers see differences in density and expression level. The images are a composite of many averaged samples so it is useful when comparing to individuals with abnormally low gene expression.

==Atlases==

===Mouse Brain===
The Allen Mouse Brain Atlas is a comprehensive genome-wide map of the adult mouse brain that reveals where each gene is expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Allen Mouse Brain Atlas | url = http://www.alleninstitute.org/science/public_resources/atlases/mouse_atlas.html | accessdate = 20 April 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120421041910/http://www.alleninstitute.org/science/public_resources/atlases/mouse_atlas.html | archive-date = 21 April 2012 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mouse brain atlas was the original project of the Allen Brain Atlas and was finished in 2006. The purpose of the atlas is to aid in the development of neuroscience research. The hope of the project is that it will allow scientists to gain a better understanding of brain diseases and disorders such as [[autism]] and [[depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name="AalokMehta2006"/&gt;

===Human Brain===
The Allen Human Brain Atlas was made public in May 2010. It was the first anatomically and genomically comprehensive three-dimensional human brain map.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Allen Human Brain Atlas Updated with Comprehensive gene Map | publisher = TS-Si | url =  http://ts-si.org/neuroscience/29735-allen-human-brain-atlas-updated-with-comprehensive-gene-map | accessdate = 20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The atlas was created to enhance research in many neuroscience research fields including neuropharmacology, human brain imaging, human genetics, neuroanatomy, genomics and more. The atlas is also geared toward furthering research into mental health disorders and brain injuries such as [[Alzheimer's disease]], autism, [[schizophrenia]] and [[substance abuse|drug addiction]].

===Developing Mouse Brain===
The Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas is an atlas which tracks gene expression throughout the development of a C57BL/6 mouse brain. The project began in 2008 and is currently ongoing. The atlas is based on [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI). It traces the growth, [[white matter]], connectivity, and development of the [[C57BL/6]] mouse brain from embryonic day 12 to postnatal day 80.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Holzman | first = David C. | title = Innovative Technologies: MRI-Based Atlas of the Developing Mouse Brain Debuts | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 119 | issue = 4 | pages = 165 | date = April 2011 | pmc=3080956 | pmid=21459709 | doi=10.1289/ehp.119-a165}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This atlas enhances the ability of neuroscientists to study how pollutants and [[genetic mutations]] effect the development of the brain. Thus, the atlas may be used to determine what [[toxins]] pose special threats to children and pregnant mothers.

===Mouse Brain Connectivity===
The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas was launched in November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Allen Mouse Brain Atlas | url = http://www.alleninstitute.org/science/public_resources/atlases/connectivity_atlas.html | accessdate = 20 April 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120920065104/http://www.alleninstitute.org/science/public_resources/atlases/connectivity_atlas.html | archive-date = 20 September 2012 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other atlases from the Allen Institute, this atlas focuses on the identification of neural circuitry that govern behavior and brain function. This neural circuitry is responsible for functions like behavior and perception. This map will allow scientists to further understand how the brain works and what causes brain diseases and disorders, such as [[Parkinson's disease]] and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Allen Institute for Brain Science launches new atlas, adds new data and tools to others | url = http://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-11-allen-brain-science-atlas-tools.html | date = 14 November 2011 | accessdate = 20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mouse Spinal Cord===
Unveiled in July 2008, the Allen Mouse Spinal Cord Atlas was the first genome-wide map of the mouse spinal cord ever constructed. The spinal cord atlas is a map of genome wide gene expression in the spinal cord of adult and juvenile C57 black mice. The initial unveiling included data for 2,000 genes and an anatomical reference section. A plan for the future includes expanding the amount of data to about 20,000 genes spanning the full length of the spinal cord.

The aim of the spinal cord atlas is to enhance research in the treatment of spinal cord injury, diseases, and disorders such as Lou Gehrig's diseases and spinal muscular atrophy. The project was funded by an array of donors including the Allen Research Institute, [[Paralyzed Veterans of America]] Research Foundation, the [[ALS Association]], [[Wyeth Research]], PEMCO Insurance, [[National Multiple Sclerosis Society]], International Spinal Research Trust, and many other organizations, foundations, corporate and private donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{  cite web | last = Duyo | first = D. | title = The Allen Spinal Cord Atlas Unveiled | publisher = American Medical Writers Association | date = September 2008 | url = http://www.amwa-midatlantic.org/archive/2008SpinalAtlas.html | accessdate = 20 April 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120227151844/http://www.amwa-midatlantic.org/archive/2008SpinalAtlas.html | archive-date = 27 February 2012 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amiga support and maintenance software''' performs service functions such as formatting media for a specific [[filesystem]], diagnosing failures that occur on formatted media, data recovery after media failure, and installation of new software{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} for the [[Amiga|Amiga family of personal computers]]&amp;mdash;as opposed to application software, which performs business, education, and recreation functions.

The Amiga came with some embedded utility programs, but many more were added over time, often by third-party developers and companies.

==Original utilities==
Commodore included utility programs with the operating system.  Many of these were original features, which were adopted into other systems:

*Installer is a tool for the installation of Amiga software.  It features a [[LISP]]-like language to handle installations.  The Amiga Installer does not support dependencies or track where the installed files are delivered; it simply copies them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aminet.net/package/util/misc/Installer-43_3|title=Installer.guide|date=1996-04-29|accessdate=2017-01-23|author=ESCOM AG}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webalice.it/fulvio.peruggi/public/Pegasos&amp;MorphOS/Articles/04_RiseAndFallOfIPs/Rise_and_Fall_of_IPs_3.html|title=Rise and Fall of Installation Procedures|author1=Dr.Morbius|author2=Tokai}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[AmigaGuide]] is a [[hypertext markup]] scheme and a browser for writing and reading web page-like documents.  AmigaGuide files are text files in a simple markup language, which facilitates editing and localization in any ASCII text editor.  [[Commodore International|Commodore]] developed the AmigaGuide format before the [[World Wide Web]] was widely known.  Consumers who bought Amiga computers in a store did not receive documentation on how to write AmigaGuide documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aminet.net/package/text/hyper/aguide34|title=ReadMe|author=Commodore-Amiga, Inc.|date=1993-03-26|accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utilities borrowed from other systems===
*'''Update tools''':
**AmiUpdate was provided{{by whom|date=January 2017}} to keep installed third-party programs up to date.
**Grunch is a software center for [[AmigaOS]] and [[MorphOS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geit.de/eng_grunch.html|title=Grunch for MorphOS, AmigaOS and compatible Systems| date= | accessdate=November 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**MorphUP allows MorphOS users to install and update new third-party software.
None of these update systems was widely used by the Amiga community.

==Commodities and utilities==
Amiga places system utilities in two standard directories:

* The ''Utilities'' directory contains programs like ''IconEdit''.
* The ''Commodities'' directory (volume SYS:Tools/Commodities/ or SYS:Utilities/Commodities under AmigaOS4) contains executable [[applet]]-like utilities which enhance system usability, like for example the ''ScreenBlanker'', the default screen saver shipped with AmigaOS.  Commodities are usually loaded at system startup.  Many require no interaction and do not feature any GUI interface.
* A system utility called ''Exchange'' allows the user to disable, enable, hide, show, and quit Commodities.

==Hard disk partitioning==
[[AmigaOS]] features a standard centralized utility to partition and format hard disks, called ''HDToolBox''.

[[MorphOS]] uses an updated version of the ''SCSIConfig'' utility (since MorphOS version 2, ''HDConfig'') implemented by third party vendor [[Phase5]].  In spite of the name, "SCSIConfig" possessed a unique feature at the time, which was providing a consistent mechanism to manage all types of disk interfaces, including IDE, irrespective of which interface the disk(s) in question used.

==Diagnostic tools==
AmigaOS diagnostic tools are usually programs which display the current state of Exec and [[AmigaDOS]] activities.

*'''Active process explorer:''' Scout, Ranger
*'''System calls and messages:''' SnoopDOS, Snoopium
*'''Memory management:''' CyberGuard, Enforcer, MemMungWall, TLSFMem by Chris Hodges
*'''Virtual memory:''' GigaMem, VMM
*'''Benchmark utilities''' AmiBench, AIBB
*'''Degrading tools:''' Degrader (which "degrades" modern Amiga systems to performance and hardware equivalents of legacy Amiga models)

==Promoting tools==
Promoter and ForceMonitor are utilities that allow the user to control the resolution of [[Intuition (Amiga)|Intuition]] screens for Amiga programs.

==Game loaders==
[[WHDLoad]] is a utility to install legacy Amiga games on a hard disk and load them from Workbench desktop instead of floppies, on which they were often delivered.

jst is an older utility which the developer abandoned in order to concentrate efforts on WHDLoad.  Old jstloaders can be read with WHDLoad, and jst itself has some early level of WHDLoad compatibility.

==Command line interfaces and text-based shells==
The original Amiga CLI (Command Line Interface) had some basic editing capabilities, command templates, and other features such as [[ANSI]] compatibility and color selection. In AmigaOS 1.3, the program evolved into a complete text-based shell called [[AmigaShell]], with command history and enhanced editing capabilities.

Third-party developers created improved shells because the console-handler standard command line device driver (or "handler" in Amiga technical language) is independent of the command-line interpreter.  This program controlled text-based interfaces into Amiga.  Console-handler replacements include KingCON,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aminet.net/package/util/shell/KingCON_1.3|title=KingCON|last=Larsson|first=David|date=1994-06-01|accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ViNCEd,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aminet.net/package/util/shell/ViNCEd|title=ViNCEd|first=Thomas|last=Richter|date=2000-09-06|accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Conman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aminet.net/package/util/shell/Conman|title=Conman|first=William|last=Hawes|date=1991-01-02|accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some well-known shells from other platforms were ported to Amiga.  These included [[bash (Unix shell)|bash]] (Bourne Again SHell), [[C shell|CSH]] (C Shell), and [[Z shell|ZSH]] (Z shell).  The shells taken from Unix and [[Linux]] were adapted into Amiga and improved with its peculiar capabilities and functions.{{clarify|date=January 2017}}

The MorphOS Shell is an example of Z shell mixed with the KingCON console handler.  It originated as a Unix-like shell and is provided with all the features expected from such a component: AmigaDOS commands (more than 100 commands, most of which are Unix-like), local and global variables, command substitution, command redirection, named and unnamed pipes, history, programmable menus, multiple shells in a window, ANSI compatibility, color selection, and so on.  It also includes all the necessary commands for scripting.

==Amiga WIMP GUI interfaces==
Starting from the original Amiga [[WIMP (computing)|WIMP]] standard desktop, Workbench, Amiga interfaces were enhanced by third-party developers.  Amiga users are free to replace the original Workbench interface with [[Scalos]] and [[Directory Opus]].  The standard GUI toolkit, called [[intuition.library|Intuition]], was enhanced in OS2.x with the introduction of GadTools; and third parties created their own toolkits such as [[Magic User Interface]] (MUI) (the standard on MorphOS systems) and ClassAct, which evolved into [[ReAction GUI]] (the standard GUI on AmigaOS 4.0).

==Amiga Advanced Graphics Systems==
{{main|retargetable graphics}}
Many users have added advanced graphics drivers to their Amiga.  This lets the AmigaOS handle high resolution graphics, enhanced with millions of colors.  Standard GUI interfaces with this capability are [[CyberGraphX]], [[Enhanced Graphics System|EGS]], and Picasso96.

===Graphical engines===
Graphical [[library (software)|libraries]] available on the Amiga include:
* [[Warp3D]], a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] graphic engine for Amiga
* TinyGL (MorphOS) and [[MiniGL]] (AmigaOS), implementations of subsets of the [[OpenGL]] graphics engine
* [[X11]], also available through the Amiga versions of [[Cygnix]]{{clarify|date=January 2017}}
* [[Cairo (graphics)|Cairo]] Vector Library, available on AmigaOS 4 and MorphOS
* SSA (Super Smooth Animation), a proprietary system for playback at 50&amp;nbsp;Hz or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz.  [[proDAD]] Adorage was the first product to use this. 
* [[GTK]].  On Amiga it is being developed as a GTK_MUI wrapper, to map any existing graphical features of GTK to the standard [[Magic User Interface]] (MUI) graphic user interface system.

All Amiga systems can also support the [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]] (Simple DirectMedia Layer) cross-platform, multimedia, and free software libraries written in C which creates an abstraction over various platforms' graphics, sound, and input APIs, allowing a developer to write a computer game or other multimedia application once and run it on many operating systems.{{clarify|date=November 2012}}

===PostScript===
Amiga supports [[PostScript]] through [[Ghostscript]] and SaxonScript (included with Saxon Publisher).  [[Ghostview]] is the foremost used graphical GUI for GhostScript on the Amiga.

Since AmigaOS 2.1, in the Prefs (Preferences) system directory, there is a printer preferences program called ''PrinterPS'', which allows the use of PostScript printers on the Amiga.

===TrueType fonts, color and anim fonts===
Original Amiga [[outline font]]s (also called vector fonts) were [[Agfa Monotype|Agfa Compugraphic]] fonts available since AmigaOS 2.0 with the standard utility [[Fountain]] (later called IntelliFont) from Commodore.  Third-party developers added support for [[Computer font#TrueType font|TrueType fonts]] using various libraries, such as [[TrueType Library]] I and II, and [[FreeType|LibFreeType library]].

The standard diskfont.library also supported bitmap multicolour fonts (ColorFonts), such as the commercial [[Kara Fonts]], or even animated fonts also originally created by [[Kara Computer Graphics]].

===Font designer software===
Commodore provided a bitmap font editor called FED.  [[Personal Fonts Maker]] was the most widely used Amiga software to create bitmap fonts, while [[TypeSmith]] v.2.5b was the ''de facto'' standard utility to create outline fonts.

==File management==

===Backup and recovery===
In the first Amiga OS releases, Commodore included a standard floppy disk recovery utility called DiskDoctor.  Its purpose was to recover files from mangled floppy disks.  Unfortunately, this utility worked only with AmigaDOS standard disks.  A major fault was that it did not save the recovered data on different disks, rather it saved the info on the original and performed its operations directly on the original.  It wrote on original disks and destroyed non-AmigaDOS disks (mainly autobooting games) by overwriting their bootblock.  DiskDoctor renamed recovered disks to "[[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]]" (after the resurrected man in the [[New Testament]]).

These features were undocumented and led to an Amiga [[urban legend]] that there was a [[computer virus]] nicknamed the Lazarus Virus,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/d.html DiskDoctor in Amiga Glossary on AmigaHistory Site]&lt;/ref&gt; whose final purpose was to make disks unreadable and renaming it with that name.  Third-party developers released data recovery programs such as DiskSalv,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landley.net/history/mirror/commodore/haynie.html|title=Dave Haynie|last=Witteveen|first=Kees|date=2003-10-01|accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was more often used to [[Verification and Validation (software)|validate]] Amiga filesystems on hard disk partitions.

Other Amiga disk repair and backup tools included:
*Floppy only: Disk Mechanic, Disk Repair, Dr.Ami
*Floppy and hard drive: Ami-Back Tools, Ami-Filesafe Pro, Quarterback Tools, Amiga Tools DeLuxe, Diavolo Backup
*[[Smart File System]] (SFS): SFS Recover Tool, SFSDoctor, SFSCheck 2, SFSResize 1.0

===Disk copiers===
During the [[8-bit era|8 bit]] and 16/[[32 bit]] era, copying software was not considered illegal in many countries, and [[Software piracy|piracy]] was not perceived as being a crime by the users of home computers (usually young people).  [[Commodore 64]] and [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]] software was copied using [[audio cassettes]], while [[IBM PC]], [[Atari]], and Amiga software was copied using special programs called disk copiers which were engineered to copy any floppy disk surface byte by byte, often using special, efficient, and advanced techniques of programming and "Disk Track driving" to maintain [[Disk read-and-write head|Floppy Disk read/write head]] alignment.

In the early days of the Amiga platform, about 16 disk copiers were created in a short amount of time (1985&amp;ndash;1989) that enabled copying Amiga floppy disks, including Nibbler, QuickNibble, ZCopier, XCopy/Cachet, FastCopier, Disk Avenger, Tetra Copy (which enabled the user to play [[Tetris]] while copying disks), Cyclone, Maverick, D-Copy, Safe II, PowerCopier, Quick Copier, Marauder II (styled as "Marauder //"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Info|issue=18|date=January–February 1988|page=97|url=https://archive.org/stream/info-magazine-18/Info_Issue_18_1988_Jan_Feb#page/n95/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rattle Copy, and BurstNibble.

Many were legal in many countries until years later.{{clarify|date=January 2017}}  These programs (for example, Marauder, X-Copy, and Nibbler) were then sold in packages complete with instructions, warranty, and [[EULA]] like other productivity software.  Some floppy drives included [[LED]] track indicators to show if the disks were hacked by the original programmers to support up to track 82 of the disk.  There were also copying solutions that included both hardware and software, like Super Card Ami II and Syncro Express I/II/III.

DFC5{{clarify|date=January 2017}} could only copy standard AmigaOS formatted disks for backup purposes; however, it multitasked inside of the Amiga Workbench GUI.

X-COPY III, and later the final version, X-COPY Pro, were the most popular Amiga copy programs.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}  They were capable of bit-by-bit copying, also called "nibbling".  Although incapable of true multitasking, the programs were capable of taking advantage of Amiga configurations with multiple floppy drives; for instance, on Amiga systems with four floppy drives, X-COPY was capable of simultaneously copying from a source drive to three others.  Coupled with excellent bit-by-bit replication capabilities, these features made X-COPY the ''de facto'' standard for copying floppy disks on the Amiga.

Another popular copying program was D-COPY,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ulisses32.sitesled.com/amiga/soft/uzytki/dcopy.png D-COPY]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; by a Swedish group "D-Mob", which, in spite of some innovative features and better/faster copying routines, failed to gain dominance.

===Archives and compression utilities===
The most popular archivers were [[LHA (file format)|LhA]] and [[LZX]].  Programs to archive [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]], [[Gzip]], [[Bzip2]], and [[RAR (file format)|RAR]] files were available but seldom used, and many have an Amiga counterpart, such as [[7-Zip]].  Utilities were available for reading and writing archive formats such as [[ARC (file format)|ARC]], [[ARJ]] (unarchive only), the [[Cabinet (file format)|CAB]] files common in Windows installation, [[StuffIt]] SIT archives from Macintosh, [[Uuencode]] (used for encoding binary attachments of e-mail messages), [[Tar (file format)|TAR]] (common on UNIX and GNU/Linux), [[RPM Package Manager|RPM]] (from Red Hat), and more.

Amiga supported "packed" or "crunched" (meaning compressed) executables, which were common in the age of floppy disks, when disk space and memory conservation was critical.  These executable binary files had a decompress routine attached to them that would automatically unpack or decrunch (decompress) the executable upon loading into memory.

The Amiga also included "level depacking", implemented by "Titanics Cruncher", which enabled a binary executable to be decrunched as it was being loaded, requiring a very small amount of memory to do so.  In general, packing and crunching was taken from the Commodore 64 cracking scene.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}  Some crunchers, such as Time Cruncher, were "ported" from Commodore 64, displaying the same visual effects during decrunching.  The CPU in the Amiga was completely different from the one in the Commodore 64, requiring a complete rewrite.

Noteworthy were TurboImploder and PowerPacker, as they were easy to use, with graphical interfaces. Other popular crunchers were DefjamPacker, TetraPack, DoubleAction, Relokit, StoneCracker, Titanics and CrunchMania. The ability to compress and decompress single files and directories on the fly has been present on the AmigaOS since at least 1994.

A similar feature was implemented relatively recently as a property in the [[ZFS|ZFS filesystem]].

The AmigaOS packers and cruncher libraries are centralized by using the XPK system.  The XPK system consists of a master library and several (de)packer sublibraries.  Programs use only the master library directly, while sublibraries (akin to [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]]s) implement the actual (de)compression.  When unpacking/decrunching, the applications do not need to know which library was used to pack or crunch the data.  XPK is a wrapper for crunchers; to decrunch non-XPK packed formats requires [[XFD]].

Another important invention on the Amiga platform was the [[Amiga Disk File|ADF]] format for creating images of Amiga floppy disks, either standard AmigaDOS floppies or non-DOS ("NDOS") ones, for use in Amiga emulators, such as [[WinUAE]].  Amiga emulators and AmigaOS (with third-party software) can use these files as if they were virtual floppy disks.  Unlimited virtual floppies could be created on modern Amigas, although WinUAE on a real PC can handle only four at a time, the maximum number of floppy drives that the Amiga hardware could have connected at any one time.

All the popular Amiga compression implementations and archive files are now centralized and implemented by a single system library called [[XAD (software)|XAD]], which has a front-end GUI named Voodoo-X.  It is included in AmigaOS 3.9 and up with UnArc.  This library is modular and can handle more than 80 compression formats.

===Filesystems===
Amiga can use various filesystems.  The historical standards are the original Amiga filesystem, called the [[Amiga Old File System|Old File System]].  This was good for [[floppy disks]] but wasted space on [[hard disks]] and is considered obsolete.

The [[Amiga Fast File System|Fast File System]] (FFS) can handle file names up to 30 characters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DCFS and LNFS Low Level Data Structures|url=http://wiki.amigaos.net/wiki/DCFS_and_LNFS_Low_Level_Data_Structures#History_and_purpose_2|date=2016-08-29|accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; has international settings (it can optionally recognise upper- and lower-case accented letters as equivalent) and could also be cached, if the users chose to format the partition with the cache option.  The FFS filesystem evolved into FFS2.

Modern [[journaling file system]]s for Amiga are the [[Smart File System]] (SFS) and [[Professional File System]] (PFS).

The [[MultiUser File System]] (MuFS) supports multiple users.  Using MuFS the owner of the system could grant various privileges on files by creating privileges for groups and users.  It was first available with the Ariadne Ethernet card, and later standalone.  The Professional File System suite has a utility to let PFS to be patched to support MuFS and MuFS features.  The latest version is 1.8 and was released in 2001.

[[CrossDOS]] is a utility to read MS-DOS formatted floppy disks in FAT12 and FAT16 filesystem, either 720&amp;nbsp;KiB double-density format or high-density (1440&amp;nbsp;KiB) (on connected floppy drives that can read 1440 MS-DOS disks).  It is a commercial product, and a slightly cut-down version was included with AmigaOS beginning with version 2.1.

The [[FAT95]] library recognizes partitions of various filesystems common in other systems such as [[FAT16]] and [[FAT32]].  It also reads DOS floppies and USB pen drives formatted with FAT16 or FAT32.

Filesystems like [[ext2]] for Linux, [[NTFS]] from Microsoft, and more are supported by third-party developers.

[[MorphOS]] natively supports SFS, FFS/FFS2, PFS, MacOS HFS, HFS+, Linux Ext2, FAT16, FAT32, and NTFS filesystems.

===Data/file types===
The Datatype system of AmigaOS is a centralized, expandable, modular system describing any kind of file (text, music, image, videos).  Each has a standard load/save module.

Any experienced programmer, using the Amiga Datatype programming guidelines, could create new standard datatype modules.  The module could be left visible to the whole Amiga system (thus to all Amiga programs) by copying the datatype into the system directory ''SYS:Classes/DataTypes/'', and the descriptor (used to identify files) into ''DEVS:DataTypes/''.

This allows programs to load and save any files for which the corresponding datatypes exist.  File descriptors did not need to be embedded in the executable code.  An independent system of loaders was not needed for new productivity software.  Amiga productivity software tools therefore have a smaller size and a more clean design than similar programs running in other operating systems.

Supported Amiga datatypes include:
{{columns-list|colwidth=18em|
* [[AIFF]]
* [[JPEG]]
* [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]]
* [[TIFF]]
* [[IFF ANIM]]
* [[CDXL]]
* [[BMP file format|BMP]]
* GIF (still and animated)
* [[JPEG Network Graphics|JNG]]
* [[HTML]]
* [[8SVX]]
* HyperGuide
* [[ILBM]]
* MPEG audio
* MPEG video
* [[Portable pixmap|PBM]]
* [[Microsoft Word]]
* PhotoCD
* [[Protracker]]
* RGBx
* RIFF [[WAV]]E
* [[WordPerfect]]
* [[WordStar]]
* [[XBM]]
* [[Super Smooth Animation|SSA]] [[Adorage and ClariSSA|proDAD]]  
}}

===MultiView===
''MultiView'' is the Amiga universal viewer.  It can load and display any file for which a corresponding datatype exists.

===MIME types===
Modern Amiga-like operating systems such as AmigaOS 4.0 and MorphOS can handle also [[File format#MIME types|MIME types]].  Any kind of file, due to its peculiar characteristics (thanks to [[File format#Filename extension|filename extensions]]), or data embedded into the file itself (for example into file [[Header (computing)|header]]) can be associated with a program that handle it, and this feature improves and completes the capabilities of Amiga to recognize and deal with any kind of file.

==Device support==

===USB ===
The only known historical [[USB]] stack for the Amiga was created for the MacroSystem DraCo Amiga clone.  It supported only USB 1.0 and ceased with the demise of that platform.

Modern USB support drivers for Amiga are:
* [[Poseidon (USB stack)|Poseidon]] USB stack available for AmigaOS 3, AROS, and MorphOS by Chris Hodges ([[open-source software]]).  Poseidon has a modular approach to USB, and various hardware devices are supported by a certain number of [[Human interface device|HID]] devices.
* [[Sirion USB Stack|Sirion]] USB stack of AmigaOS 4.0
* [[ANAIIS]] (Another Native Amiga IO Interface Stack) by Gilles Pelletier

===FireWire (IEEE 1394)===
The only known historical Amiga support for [[IEEE 1394|FireWire]] was built for the [[DraCo]] Amiga clone by Macrosystem.

Only one FireWire interface exists for Amiga.  It is named Fireworks, and it was created for the MorphOS system by programmer [[Pavel Fedin]].  It is still in an early stage of development and is freely downloadable.

===Printer drivers===
The [[print manager]] program [[TurboPrint]], by German firm [[IrseeSoft]], is the ''de facto'' standard for advanced printing on the Amiga.  It is a modular program with many drivers which support many modern printers.  [[PrintStudio Professional]] I and II are another well known printer driver system for the Amiga.

[[PrintManager]] v39 by [[Stephan Rupprecht]], available at the Aminet repository, is a print [[spooler]] for AmigaOS 3.x and 4.0.

===Video digitizers===
Video digitizing includes [[DigiView]]; the [[FrameMachine]] Zorro II expansion card for A2000, 3000, 4000; the [[Impact Vision IV24]] from [[Great Valley Products|GVP]]; the [[VidiAmiga]] real time digitizer; and the [[Paloma module]] for the [[Picasso IV]] graphics card.

===Graphic Tablets===
In the 1980s, [[SummaGraphics]] tablets were common.  Summagraphics directly supported Amiga with its drivers.

In 1994, [[GTDriver]] (Graphic Tablet Driver) was the most common driver for [[serial port]] tablets, like Summagraphics MM, Summagraphics Bitpadone, [[CalComp]] 2000, [[Cherry]], [[TekTronix]] 4967, and [[Wacom (company)|WACOM]].  It could also be used as a mouse driver.

Graphics tablets now are mainly USB devices and are automatically recognized by Amiga USB stacks.  The most widely used driver for graphic tablets is [[FormAldiHyd]].  FormAldiHyd can be used with [[Aiptek]], [[Aldi]], [[Tevion]], and [[Wacom (company)|WACOM]] IV (Graphire, ArtPad, A3, A4, A5, and PenPartner) graphic tablets.

The Poseidon USB driver, written by the same author as FormAldiHyd, Chris Hodges, directly supports USB graphics tablets, including ones more modern than FormAldiHyd. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amiga-news.de/en/news/AN-2005-11-00091-EN.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scanner drivers===
Amiga programs often have scanner drivers embedded in their interface and are limited to some ancient scanner models.  One example is Art Department Professional (ADPro).

In recent times, scanner management is managed by the Amiga Poseidon USB stack.  Poseidon detects scanners from their signature, and loads the corresponding HIDD scanner module.  The graphical interface is managed by programs like [[ScanTrax]] and [[ScanQuix]].

===Genlocks, chromakey, signal video inverters===
The Amiga has special circuitry to support a [[genlock]] signal and [[chromakey]].  Genlock software{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} vendors included [[Great Valley Products|GVP]] (Great Valley Products) (an American hardware manufacturer) and [[Hama GmbH &amp; Co KG|Hama]], [[Electronic Design]], and [[Sirius Genlock|Sirius]] genlocks from [[Germany]].

===Infrared/remote controls===
The [[IRCom]] class is a driver that supports the IRCom standard and is available for the USB Poseidon Stack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geit.de/deu_ircom.html IRCom Remote]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pegasos]] computers have an internal [[IrDA]] port connector for connecting infrared devices, but MorphOS offers no support for it.  The internal IrDA port can be used by installing [[Linux]].

===WiFi and Bluetooth===
The Amiga can use [[WiFi]] external [[Router (computing)|routers]] connected physically through [[Ethernet]] cable and talk with remote WiFi devices.  Drivers are available for Prism2 internal [[Conventional PCI|PCI]] and [[PCMCIA]] WiFi expansion cards, but there are no drivers for [[Bluetooth]] standard devices like [[mobile phones]], [[Bluetooth wireless headsets|Bluetooth handsets]], keyboards, or mice.{{clarify|reason=Is there Bluetooth hardware available?|date=January 2017}}

A USB class exists for the  Poseidon stack to use the "Wireless PC Lock" USB device by [http://www.sitecom.com/ Sitecom Europe BV] and engage its security functions.  It is called [http://www.geit.de/deu_wirelesspclock.html Wireless PC Lock].

===Others===
In the past, drivers and hardware cards were available to drive the [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] Freeze Frame Digital Camera System [[Polaroid Digital Palette CI-3000]] and [[Digital Palette CI 5000]], with Polaroid software.

Drivers for single-frame video recorders allow users to save on tape the 3D animations created on the Amiga using [[Ampex]] and [[Betacam]] devices.  Also available are time-base correctors (TBCs), a family of devices correcting timing errors; one was the [[Personal TBC]] series.

The Amiga helped to create and launch{{fact|date=January 2017}} digital recorders coupled with an internal hard disk and a DVD drive for file transfer.  One was [http://www.amigis.nl/elite.html Broadcaster Elite], one of the first digital video recorders, based on a SCSI system and a Zorro II Amiga expansion card.

Expansion cards could transform an Amiga into a waveform monitor or [[vectorscope]].

The Phonepak card from GVP&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amigis.nl/phonepak.html Amiga Phonepak]&lt;/ref&gt; transformed the Amiga into a telephone switchboard, fax system, and SOHO (small office/home office) answering machine.

The Amiga was used as a video titler system in the experimental era of [[high-definition television]].  A battery of three Amigas was used as a video titler on [[Analog high-definition television systems|analog HDTV]] experiments on HDTV NTSC 1125 lines standard, by channels like [[ESPN]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and [[NBC]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The term '''cognitive neuroscience''' was coined by [[George Armitage Miller]] and [[Michael Gazzaniga]] in year 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gazzaniga|first=Michael |authorlink=Michael S. Gazzaniga|date=1984|title=Handbook of Cognitive Neuroscience|pages=vii|chapter=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive neuroscience is the scientific field that is concerned with the study of the [[Biology|biological]] processes and aspects that underlie [[cognition]],&lt;ref&gt;Gazzaniga, Ivry and Mangun 2002, cf. title&lt;/ref&gt; with a specific focus on the neural connections in the brain which are involved in [[mental process]]es. It addresses the questions of how cognitive activities are affected or controlled by neural circuits in the brain.  Cognitive neuroscience is a branch of both [[neuroscience]] and [[psychology]], overlapping with disciplines such as [[behavioral neuroscience]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[physiological psychology]] and [[affective neuroscience]].&lt;ref name="Gazzaniga 2002, p. xv"&gt;Gazzaniga 2002, p. xv&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive neuroscience relies upon theories in [[cognitive science]] coupled with evidence from [[neurobiology]], and [[Computational neuroscience|computational modeling]].&lt;ref name="Gazzaniga 2002, p. xv"/&gt;

Parts of the brain play an important role in this field. [[Neuron]]s play the most vital role, since the main point is to establish an understanding of cognition from a neural perspective, along with the different lobes of the [[cerebral cortex]].

Methods employed in cognitive neuroscience include experimental procedures from [[psychophysics]] and [[cognitive psychology]], [[functional neuroimaging]], [[electrophysiology]], [[cognitive genomics]], and [[behavioral genetics]].

Studies of patients with cognitive deficits due to brain [[lesion]]s constitute an important aspect of cognitive neuroscience. The damages in lesioned brains provide a comparable basis with regards to healthy and fully functioning brains. 
These damages change the neural circuits in the brain and cause it to malfunction during basic cognitive processes, such as [[memory]] or [[learning]]. With the damage, we can compare how the healthy neural circuits are functioning, and possibly draw conclusions about the basis of the affected cognitive processes.

Also, cognitive abilities based on brain development are studied and examined under the subfield of [[developmental cognitive neuroscience]]. This shows brain development over time, analyzing differences and concocting possible reasons for those differences.

Theoretical approaches include [[computational neuroscience]] and [[cognitive psychology]].

==Historical origins==
[[File:Historycognitiveneuroscience.jpg|thumb|alt=Timeline of development of field of cognitive neuroscience|Timeline showing major developments in science that led to the emergence of the field cognitive neuroscience.|400px]]

Cognitive neuroscience is an interdisciplinary area of study that has emerged from [[neuroscience]] and [[psychology]].&lt;ref name="Kosslyn, S, M. &amp; Andersen, R, A. (1992). Frontiers in cognitive neuroscience. Cambridge, MA: MIT press."&gt;Kosslyn, S, M. &amp; Andersen, R, A. (1992). Frontiers in cognitive neuroscience. Cambridge, MA: MIT press.&lt;/ref&gt; There were several stages in these disciplines that changed the way researchers approached their investigations and that led to the field becoming fully established.

Although the task of cognitive neuroscience is to describe how the brain creates the mind, historically it has progressed by investigating how a certain area of the brain supports a given mental faculty. However, early efforts to subdivide the brain proved to be problematic. The phrenologist movement failed to supply a scientific basis for its theories and has since been rejected. The aggregate field view, meaning that all areas of the brain participated in all behavior,&lt;ref name="Erickson-Davis"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ida.mtholyoke.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10166/626/153.pdf?sequence=1 | title=Neurofeedback Training for Parkinsonian Tremor and Bradykinesia | accessdate=2013-05-23 | author=Cordelia Erickson-Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt; was also rejected as a result of brain mapping, which began with [[Hitzig]] and [[Gustav Fritsch|Fritsch]]’s experiments&lt;ref name="G. Fritsch, E. Hitzig, Electric excitability of the cerebrum (Über die elektrische Erregbarkeit des Grosshirns), Epilepsy &amp; Behavior, Volume 15, Issue 2, June 2009, Pages 123-130, ISSN 1525-5050, 10.1016/j.yebeh.2009.03.001."&gt;G.

===Origins in philosophy===
Philosophers have always been interested in the mind: "the idea that explaining a phenomenon involves understanding the mechanism responsible for it has deep roots in the History of Philosophy from atomic theories in 5th century B.C. to its rebirth in the 17th and 18th century in the works of Galileo, Descartes, and Boyle. Among others, it’s Descartes’ idea that machines humans build could work as models of scientific explanation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sirgiovanni|first1=Elisabetta|title=The Mechanistic Approach to Psychiatric Classification|journal=Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences|date=2009|volume=2|issue=2|pages=45–49|url=http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-C09-02.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, [[Aristotle]] thought the brain was the body’s cooling system and the capacity for intelligence was located in the heart. It has been suggested that the first person to believe otherwise was the Roman physician [[Galen]] in the second century AD, who declared that the brain was the source of mental activity,&lt;ref name="Uttal, W, R. (2011). Mind and brain: A critical appraisal of cognitive neuroscience. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press"&gt;Uttal, W, R. (2011). Mind and brain: A critical appraisal of cognitive neuroscience. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; although this has also been accredited to [[Alcmaeon of Croton|Alcmaeon]].&lt;ref name="Gross, C, G. (1995) Aristotle on the Brain. The Neuroscientist(1) 4."&gt;Gross, C, G. (1995) Aristotle on the Brain. The Neuroscientist(1) 4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Galen believed that personality and emotion were not generated by the brain, but rather by other organs. [[Andreas Vesalius]], an anatomist and physician, was the first to believe that the brain and the nervous system are the center of the mind and emotion.&lt;ref name="Smith, C, U. (2013). Cardiocentric neurophysiology. the persistence of a delusion.  Journal of the History of Neuroscience 22(1) 6-13."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = C | year = 2013 | title = Cardiocentric neurophysiology. the persistence of a delusion | url = | journal = Journal of the History of Neuroscience | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 6–13 | doi=10.1080/0964704x.2011.650899| pmid = 23323528 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psychology]], a major contributing field to cognitive neuroscience, emerged from philosophical reasoning about the mind.&lt;ref name="Hatfield, G.

Psychology, Philosophy, and Cognitive Science: Reflections on the History and Philosophy of Experimental Psychology.  Mind and Language. 17(3) 207-232.&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===

====Phrenology====
[[Image:Phrenology-journal.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A page from the ''American Phrenological Journal'']]
{{Main article|Phrenology}}
One of the predecessors to cognitive neuroscience was [[phrenology]], a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] approach that claimed that behavior could be determined by the shape of the [[scalp]]. In the early 19th century, [[Franz Joseph Gall]] and [[J. G. Spurzheim]] believed that the human brain was localized into approximately 35 different sections. In his book, The Anatomy and Physiology of the Nervous System in General, and of the Brain in Particular, Gall claimed that a larger bump in one of these areas meant that that area of the brain was used more frequently by that person. This theory gained significant public attention, leading to the publication of phrenology journals and the creation of phrenometers, which measured the bumps on a human subject's head. While phrenology remained a fixture at fairs and carnivals, it did not enjoy wide acceptance within the scientific community.&lt;ref name=" Bear et al. 2007, pp. 10-11"&gt;Bear et al. 2007, pp. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; The major criticism of phrenology is that researchers were not able to test theories empirically.&lt;ref name="Kosslyn, S, M. &amp; Andersen, R, A. (1992). Frontiers in cognitive neuroscience. Cambridge, MA: MIT press." /&gt;

====Localizationist view====
The localizationist view was concerned with mental abilities being localized to specific areas of the brain rather than on what the characteristics of the abilities were and how to measure them.&lt;ref name="Kosslyn, S, M. &amp; Andersen, R, A. (1992). Frontiers in cognitive neuroscience. Cambridge, MA: MIT press." /&gt; Studies performed in Europe, such as those of [[John Hughlings Jackson]], supported this view. Jackson studied patients with [[brain damage]], particularly those with [[epilepsy]]. He discovered that the epileptic patients often made the same [[clonus|clonic]] and tonic movements of muscle during their seizures, leading Jackson to believe that they must be occurring in the same place every time. Jackson proposed that specific functions were localized to specific areas of the brain,&lt;ref&gt;Enersen, O. D. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; which was critical to future understanding of the [[brain lobes]].

====Aggregate field view====
According to the aggregate field view, all areas of the brain participate in every mental function.&lt;ref name="Erickson-Davis"/&gt;

[[Pierre Flourens]], a French experimental psychologist, challenged the localizationist view by using animal experiments.&lt;ref name="Kosslyn, S, M. &amp; Andersen, R, A. (1992). Frontiers in cognitive neuroscience. Cambridge, MA: MIT press." /&gt; He discovered that removing the [[cerebellum]] in rabbits and pigeons affected their sense of muscular coordination, and that all cognitive functions were disrupted in pigeons when the [[cerebral hemisphere]]s were removed. From this he concluded that the [[cerebral cortex]], [[cerebellum]], and [[brainstem]] functioned together as a whole.&lt;ref name = "Boring, E.G. (1957). A history of experimental psychology. New York. "&gt;Boring, E.G. (1957). A history of experimental psychology. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; His approach has been criticised on the basis that the tests were not sensitive enough to notice selective deficits had they been present.&lt;ref name="Kosslyn, S, M. &amp; Andersen, R, A. (1992). Frontiers in cognitive neuroscience. Cambridge, MA: MIT press." /&gt;

====Emergence of neuropsychology====
Perhaps the first serious attempts to localize mental functions to specific locations in the brain was by [[Paul Broca|Broca]] and [[Wernicke]]. This was mostly achieved by studying the effects of injuries to different parts of the brain on psychological functions.&lt;ref&gt;Uttal, W, R. (2011). Mind and brain: A critical appraisal of cognitive neuroscience. Cambridge, MA: MIT PressUttal, W, R. (2011). Mind and brain: A critical appraisal of cognitive neuroscience. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; In 1861, French neurologist Paul Broca came across a man who was able to understand language but unable to speak. The man could only produce the sound "tan". It was later discovered that the man had damage to an area of his left frontal lobe now known as [[Broca's area]]. Carl Wernicke, a [[Germany|German]] [[neurologist]], found a patient who could speak fluently but non-sensibly. The patient had been the victim of a [[stroke]], and could not understand spoken or written language. This patient had a lesion in the area where the left parietal and temporal lobes meet, now known as [[Wernicke's area]]. These cases, which suggested that lesions caused specific behavioral changes, strongly supported the localizationist view.

====Mapping the brain====
In 1870, German physicians [[Eduard Hitzig]] and [[Gustav Fritsch]] published their findings about the behavior of animals. Hitzig and Fritsch ran an electric current through the cerebral cortex of a dog, causing different muscles to contract depending on which areas of the brain were electrically stimulated. This led to the proposition that individual functions are localized to specific areas of the brain rather than the cerebrum as a whole, as the aggregate field view suggests.&lt;ref name="G. Fritsch, E. Hitzig, Electric excitability of the cerebrum (Über die elektrische Erregbarkeit des Grosshirns), Epilepsy &amp; Behavior, Volume 15, Issue 2, June 2009, Pages 123-130, ISSN 1525-5050, 10.1016/j.yebeh.2009.03.001." /&gt; [[Korbinian Brodmann|Brodmann]] was also an important figure in brain mapping; his experiments based on Franz Nissl’s tissue staining techniques divided the brain into fifty-two areas.

===20th century===

====Cognitive revolution====
At the start of the 20th century, attitudes in America were characterised by pragmatism, which led to a preference for [[behaviorism]] as the primary approach in [[psychology]]. [[John B. Watson|J.B. Watson]] was a key figure with his stimulus-response approach. By conducting experiments on animals he was aiming to be able to predict and control behaviour. Behaviourism eventually failed because it could not provide realistic psychology of human action and thought – it focused primarily on stimulus-response associations at the expense of explaining phenomena like thought and imagination. This led to what is often termed as the "cognitive revolution".&lt;ref name="Mandler, G. (2002) Origins of the cognitive (r)evolution. J. Hist. Behav. Sci. Fall 38(4)339-53."&gt;Mandler, G. (2002) Origins of the cognitive (r)evolution. J. Hist. Behav. Sci. Fall 38(4)339-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neuron doctrine====
{{Main article|Neuron doctrine}}
In the early 20th century, Santiago Ramón y Cajal and Camillo Golgi began working on the structure of the neuron. Golgi developed a [[Golgi's method|silver staining method]] that could entirely stain several cells in a particular area, leading him to believe that neurons were directly connected with each other in one cytoplasm. Cajal challenged this view after staining areas of the brain that had less myelin and discovering that neurons were discrete cells. Cajal also discovered that cells transmit electrical signals down the neuron in one direction only. Both Golgi and Cajal were awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1906 for this work on the neuron doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1906/|title= The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mid-late 20th century ===
Several findings in the 20th century continued to advance the field, such as the discovery of ocular dominance columns, recording of single nerve cells in animals, and coordination of eye and head movements. Experimental psychology was also significant in the foundation of cognitive neuroscience. Some particularly important results were the demonstration that some tasks are accomplished via discrete processing stages, the study of attention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carrasco |first1=Marisa |title=Visual attention: The past 25 years |journal=Vision Research |date=2011 |volume=51 |issue=13 |pages=1484–1525 |doi=10.1016/j.visres.2011.04.012|pmid=21549742 |pmc=3390154 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kastner |first1=Sabine |last2=Ungerleider |first2=Leslie G. |title=Mechanisms of visual attention in the human cortex |journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience |date=2000 |volume=23 |pages=315–41|pmid=10845067 |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.23.1.315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the notion that behavioural data do not provide enough information by themselves to explain mental processes. As a result, some experimental psychologists began to investigate neural bases of behaviour. 
Wilder Penfield created maps of primary sensory and motor areas of the brain by stimulating cortices of patients during surgery. Sperry and Gazzaniga’s work on split brain patients in the 1950s was also instrumental in the progress of the field.&lt;ref name="Uttal, W, R. (2011). Mind and brain: A critical appraisal of cognitive neuroscience. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press" /&gt;

====Brain mapping ====
New brain mapping technology, particularly [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] and [[positron emission tomography|PET]], allowed researchers to investigate experimental strategies of [[cognitive psychology]] by observing brain function. Although this is often thought of as a new method (most of the technology is relatively recent), the underlying principle goes back as far as 1878 when blood flow was first associated with brain function.&lt;ref name="Raichle 2009" /&gt; [[Angelo Mosso]], an Italian psychologist of the 19th century, had monitored the pulsations of the adult brain through neurosurgically created bony defects in the skulls of patients. He noted that when the subjects engaged in tasks such as mathematical calculations the pulsations of the brain increased locally. Such observations led Mosso to conclude that blood flow of the brain followed function.&lt;ref name="Raichle 2009" /&gt;

==Emergence of a new discipline==

===Birth of cognitive science===
On September 11, 1956, a large-scale meeting of [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivists]] took place at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. [[George Armitage Miller|George A. Miller]] presented his "[[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two]]" paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |doi=10.1037/h0043158 |pmid=13310704|year=1956 |title=The magical number seven plus or minus two: Some limits on our capacity for processing information |journal=Psychological Review |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=81–97 |citeseerx=10.1.1.308.8071 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Allen Newell|Newell]] &amp; [[Herbert A. Simon|Simon]] presented their findings on [[computer science]]. [[Ulric Neisser]] commented on many of the findings at this meeting in his 1967 book ''Cognitive Psychology''. The term "psychology" had been waning in the 1950s and 1960s, causing the field to be referred to as "cognitive science". Behaviorists such as Miller began to focus on the representation of language rather than general behavior. [[David Marr (psychologist)|David Marr]] concluded that one should understand any cognitive process at three levels of analysis. These levels include computational, algorithmic/representational, and physical levels of analysis.&lt;ref name="weebly.com"&gt;[http://jungminded.weebly.com/cognitive-psychology/approaches-in-cognitive-psychology Approaches in Cognitive Psychology]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combining neuroscience and cognitive science===
Before the 1980s, interaction between neuroscience and cognitive science was scarce.&lt;ref name="petemandik.com"&gt;not available, http://www.petemandik.com/philosophy/papers/brookmadik.com.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} not available&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive neuroscience began to integrate the newly laid theoretical ground in cognitive science, that emerged between the 1950s and 1960s, with approaches in experimental psychology, neuropsychology and neuroscience. (Neuroscience was not established as a unified discipline until 1971&lt;ref&gt;Society for Neuroscience. Date of the first meeting of the Sociefy for Neuroscience&lt;/ref&gt;). In the very late 20th century new technologies evolved that are now the mainstay of the methodology of cognitive neuroscience, including [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|TMS]] (1985) and [[fMRI]] (1991). Earlier methods used in cognitive neuroscience include [[EEG]] (human EEG 1920) and [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] (1968). Occasionally cognitive neuroscientists utilize other brain imaging methods such as [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[SPECT]]. An upcoming technique in neuroscience is [[Near infrared spectroscopy|NIRS]] which uses light absorption to calculate changes in oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin in cortical areas. In some animals [[Single-unit recording]] can be used. Other methods include [[microneurography]], facial [[Electromyography|EMG]], and [[eye tracking]].  [[Integrative neuroscience]] attempts to consolidate data in databases, and form unified descriptive models from various fields and scales: biology, psychology, anatomy, and clinical practice.&lt;ref name="boundless.com"&gt;https://www.boundless.com/psychology/history-psychology/origin-psychology/growth-of-psychology-as-a-science--31/{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, [[Stanislas Dehaene]], [[Giacomo Rizzolatti]] and [[Trevor Robbins]], were awarded the [[Grete Lundbeck European Brain Research Prize|Brain Prize]] "for their pioneering research on higher brain mechanisms underpinning such complex human functions as literacy, numeracy, motivated behaviour and social cognition, and for their efforts to understand cognitive and behavioural disorders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebrainprize.org/flx/prize_winners/prize_winners_2014|title=The Brain Prize}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brenda Milner]], [[Marcus Raichle]] and [[John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)|John O'Keefe]] received the [[Kavli Prize]] in Neuroscience “for the discovery of specialized brain networks for memory and cognition"&lt;ref name="Kavli"&gt;http://www.kavliprize.org/prizes-and-laureates/prizes/2014-kavli-prize-laureates-neuroscience&lt;/ref&gt; and O'Keefe shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in the same year with [[May-Britt Moser]] and [[Edvard Moser]] "for their discoveries of cells that constitute a positioning system in the brain".&lt;ref name="nobelmedicine"&gt;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2014/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, [[Wolfram Schultz]], [[Peter Dayan]] and [[Ray Dolan (scientist)|Ray Dolan]] were awarded the Brain Prize "for their multidisciplinary analysis of brain mechanisms that link learning to reward, which has far-reaching implications for the understanding of human behaviour, including disorders of decision-making in conditions such as gambling, drug addiction, compulsive behaviour and schizophrenia".,&lt;ref name="2017BBC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gallager|first1=James|title=Scientists win prize for brain research|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-39183178|accessdate=6 March 2017|work=BBC|date=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major contributors to the field ==

=== Hubel and Wiesel – 1960s ===
[[David H. Hubel]] and [[Torsten Wiesel]], both [[Neurophysiologist|neurophysiologists,]] studied the [[visual system]] in cats to better understand [[sensory processing]]. They performed experiments which demonstrated the specificity of the responding of neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hubel|first=D. H.|last2=Wiesel|first2=T. N.|date=1959-10-01|title=Receptive fields of single neurones in the cat's striate cortex|journal=The Journal of Physiology|volume=148|issue=3|pages=574–591|issn=0022-3751|pmc=1363130|pmid=14403679|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1959.sp006308}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their experiments showed that neurons fired rapidly at some angles, and not so much at others. A difference was also found in light and dark settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hubel|first=D. H.|last2=Wiesel|first2=T. N.|date=1962-01-01|title=Receptive fields, binocular interaction and functional architecture in the cat's visual cortex|journal=The Journal of Physiology|volume=160|issue=1|pages=106–154.2|issn=0022-3751|pmc=1359523|pmid=14449617|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1962.sp006837}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their studies gave rise to the idea of complex visual representations being formed from relatively simple stimuli.

They also discovered the [[simple cell]] and [[complex cell]]. These exist in the primary visual cortex and respond differentially to differently oriented presentations of light.

==Recent trends==
Recently the foci of research have expanded from the localization of brain area(s) for specific functions in the adult brain using a single technology, studies have been diverging in several different directions: exploring the interactions between different brain areas, using multiple technologies and approaches to understand brain functions, and using computational approaches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Takeo|first=Watanabe|title=Cognitive neuroscience Editorial overview|url=http://people.bu.edu/takeo/takeo/Editorial%20(Current%20Opinion).pdf|access-date=2011-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224221332/http://people.bu.edu/takeo/takeo/Editorial%20(Current%20Opinion).pdf|archive-date=2012-12-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Advances in non-invasive functional neuroimaging and associated data analysis methods have also made it possible to use highly naturalistic stimuli and tasks such as feature films depicting social interactions in cognitive neuroscience studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hasson|first=Uri|title=Intersubject Synchronization of Cortical Activity During Natural Vision |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/303/5664/1634.short|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In sociology, '''cultural capital''' consists of the social assets of a person (education, intellect, style of speech and dress, etc.) that promote [[social mobility]] in a stratified society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Music studies|last=J.P.E Harper-Scott and Jim Samson|first=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=52–55|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural capital functions as a social-relation within an economy of practices (system of exchange), and comprises all of the material and symbolic goods, without [[Distinction (sociology)|distinction]], that society considers rare and worth seeking.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dictionary of Human Geography'', 5th Ed., (2009), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; As a social relation within a system of exchange, cultural capital includes the accumulated cultural knowledge that confers [[social status]] and [[Power (social and political)|power]].&lt;ref&gt;Harker, 1990:13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0761973419&amp;id=ACA5u-F2PlMC&amp;pg=PA37 ''The Sage Dictionary of Cultural studies'' by Chris Barker]&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Cultural Reproduction and Social Reproduction" (1977), [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Jean-Claude Passeron]] presented ''cultural capital'' to conceptually explain the differences among the levels of performance and academic achievement of children within the educational system of France in the 1960s; and further developed the concept in the essay "The Forms of Capital" (1985) and in the book ''The State Nobility: Élite Schools in the Field of Power'' (1996).

==Types of capital==
In the sociological essay, "The Forms of Capital" (1985), Pierre Bourdieu identifies three categories of capital:

# [[capital (economics)|Economic capital]]: command of economic resources (money, assets, property).
# [[Social capital]]: actual and potential resources linked to the possession of a durable network of institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. "The Forms of Capital" (1985), ''Handbook of Theory of Research for the Sociology of Education'' (1986) p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Cultural capital''': A person's education (knowledge and intellectual skills) that provides advantage in achieving a higher social-status in society.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. "The Forms of Capital" (1985), ''Handbook of Theory of Research for the Sociology of Education'' (1986) pp. 46–58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
There are three types of cultural capital: (i) Embodied capital; (ii)  Objectified capital; and (iii) Institutionalised capital:

#'''Embodied cultural capital''' comprises the knowledge that is consciously acquired and the passively inherited, by [[socialization]] to culture and tradition. Unlike property, cultural capital is not transmissible, but is acquired over time, as it is impressed upon the person's [[habitus (sociology)|habitus]] (character and way of thinking), which, in turn, becomes more receptive to similar cultural influences. '''Linguistic cultural capital''' is the mastery of language and its relations; the embodied cultural capital, which is a person's means of communication and self-presentation, acquired from the national culture.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, 1990:114.&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Objectified cultural capital''' comprises the person's property (e.g. a work of art, scientific instruments, etc.) that can be transmitted for economic profit (buying-and-selling) and for symbolically conveying the possession of cultural capital facilitated by owning such things. Yet, whilst possessing a work of art (objectified cultural-capital) the person can consume the art (understand its cultural meaning) only with the proper conceptual and historical foundations of prior cultural-capital. As such, cultural capital is not transmitted in the sale of the work of art, except by coincidental and independent causation, when the seller explains the artwork's significance to the buyer.
#'''Institutionalized cultural capital''' comprises an institution's formal recognition of a person's cultural capital, usually academic credentials or professional qualifications. The greatest social role of institutionalized cultural-capital is in the labor market (a job), wherein it allows the expression of the person's array of cultural capital as qualitative and quantitative measurements (which are compared against the measures of cultural capital of other people). The institutional recognition facilitates the conversion of cultural capital into economic capital, by serving as a [[heuristic]] (practical solution) with which the seller can describe his or her cultural capital to the buyer.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, 1986:47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitus and field==
The cultural capital of a person is linked to his or her [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]] (embodied disposition and tendencies) and [[Field (Bourdieu)|field]] (social positions), which are configured as a social-relation structure.&lt;ref&gt;King, 2005:223&lt;/ref&gt; The field is the place of social position that is constituted by the conflicts that occur when social groups endeavour to establish and define what is cultural capital, within a given social space; therefore, depending upon the social field, one type of cultural capital can simultaneously be legitimate and illegitimate. In that way, the legitimization (societal recognition) of a type of cultural capital can be arbitrary and derived from [[symbolic capital]].

The habitus of a person is composed of the [[intellectualism|intellectual]] dispositions inculcated to him or her by family and the familial environment, and are manifested according to the nature of the person.&lt;ref&gt;Harker, 1990, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webb, 2002, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gorder, 1980, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the social formation of a person's habitus is influenced by family,&lt;ref&gt;Harker ''et al.'', 1990, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; by objective changes in [[social class]],&lt;ref&gt;King, 2005, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; and by social interactions with other people in daily life;&lt;ref&gt;Gorder, 1980, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; moreover, the habitus of a person also changes when he or she changes social positions within the field.&lt;ref&gt;Harker, 1990, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical research==
The concept of cultural capital has received widespread attention all around the world, from theorists and researchers alike. It is mostly employed in relation to the education system, but on the odd occasion has been used or developed in other discourses. Use of Bourdieu's cultural capital can be broken up into a number of basic categories. First, are those who explore the theory as a possible means of explanation or employ it as the framework for their research. Second, are those who build on or expand Bourdieu's theory. Finally, there are those who attempt to disprove Bourdieu's findings or to discount them in favour of an alternative theory. The majority of these works deal with Bourdieu's theory in relation to education, only a small number apply his theory to other instances of inequality in society.

===Traditional application===
Those researchers and theorists{{Who|date=October 2016}} who explore or employ Bourdieu's theory use it in a similar way as it was articulated by Bourdieu. They usually apply it uncritically,{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}, and depending on the measurable indicators of cultural capital and the fields within which they measure it, Bourdieu's theory either works to support their argument totally, or in a qualified way.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}. These works to help portray the usefulness of Bourdieu's concept in analysing (mainly educational) inequality but they do not add anything to the theory.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

One work which does employ Bourdieu's work in an enlightening way is that of Emirbayer &amp; Williams (2005) who use Bourdieu's notion of fields and capital to examine the power relations in the field of social services, particularly homeless shelters. The authors talk of the two separate fields that operate in the same geographic location (the shelter) and the types of capital that are legitimate and valued in each. Specifically they show how homeless people can possess "staff-sanctioned capital" or "client-sanctioned capital" (2005:92) and show how in the shelter, they are both at the same time, desirable and undesirable, valued and disparaged, depending on which of the two fields they are operating in. Although the authors do not clearly define staff-sanctioned and client-sanctioned capital as cultural capital, and state that usually the resources that form these two capitals are gathered from a person's life as opposed to their family, it can be seen how Bourdieu's theory of cultural capital can be a valuable theory in analyzing inequality in any social setting.

===Expansion===
A number of works expand Bourdieu's theory of cultural capital in a beneficial manner, without deviating from Bourdieu's framework of the different forms of capital. In fact, these authors can be seen to explore unarticulated areas of Bourdieu's theory as opposed to constructing a new theory. For instance, Stanton-Salazar &amp; Dornbusch (1995:121) examine how those people with the desired types of cultural (and linguistic) capital in a school transform this capital into "instrumental relations" or social capital with institutional agents who can transmit valuable resources to the person, furthering their success in the school. They state that this is simply an elaboration of Bourdieu's theory. Similarly, Dumais (2002) introduces the variable of gender to determine the ability of cultural capital to increase educational achievement. The author shows how gender and social class interact to produce different benefits from cultural capital. In fact in Distinction (1984:107), Bourdieu states "sexual properties are as inseparable from class properties as the yellowness of lemons is inseparable from its acidity". He simply did not articulate the differences attributable to gender in his general theory of [[cultural reproduction|reproduction]] in the education system.

On the other hand, two authors have introduced new variables into Bourdieu's concept of cultural capital. Emmison &amp; Frow's (1998) work centers on an exploration of the ability of Information Technology to be considered a form of cultural capital. The authors state that "a familiarity with, and a positive disposition towards the use of bourgeoisie technologies of the information age can be seen as an additional form of cultural capital bestowing [[Digital divide|advantage on those families that possess them]]". Specifically computers are "machines" (Bourdieu, 1986:47) that form a type of objectified cultural capital, and the ability to use them is an embodied type of cultural capital. This work is useful because it shows the ways in which Bourdieu's concept of cultural capital can be expanded and updated to include cultural goods and practices which are progressively more important in determining achievement both in the school and without.

Hage uses Bourdieu's theory of cultural capital to explore multiculturalism and racism in Australia. His discussion around race is distinct from Bourdieu's treatment of migrants and their amount of linguistic capital and habitus. Hage actually conceives of "whiteness" (in Dolby, 2000:49) as being a form of cultural capital. 'White' is not a stable, biologically determined trait, but a "shifting set of social practices" (Dolby, 2000:49). He conceptualizes the nation as a circular field, with the hierarchy moving from the powerful center (composed of 'white' Australians) to the less powerful periphery (composed of the 'others'). The 'others' however are not simply dominated, but are forced to compete with each other for a place closer to the centre. This use of Bourdieu's notion of capital and fields is extremely illuminating to understand how people of non-Anglo ethnicities may try and exchange the cultural capital of their ethnic background with that of 'whiteness' to gain a higher position in the hierarchy. It is especially useful to see it in these terms as it exposes the arbitrary nature of what is "Australian", and how it is determined by those in the dominant position (mainly 'white' Australians). In a path-breaking study, Bauder (2006) uses the notions of habitus and cultural capital to explain the situation of migrants in the labor market and society.

In the article "Against School" (2003), the retired teacher John Taylor Gatto addresses education in modern schooling. The relation of cultural capital can be linked to ''Principles of Secondary Education'' (1918), by Alexander Inglis, which indicates how American schooling is what like Prussian schooling in the 1820s. The objective was to divide children into sections, by distributing them by subject, by age, and by test score. Inglis introduces six basic functions for modern schooling; functions three, four, and five are related to cultural capital, and describe the manner in which schooling enforces the cultural capital of each child, from a young age. Functions three, four, and five are: '''3. Diagnosis and direction''':
School is meant to determine the proper social role of each student, by logging mathematic and anecdotal evidence into cumulative records. '''4. Differentiation''': Once the social role of a student is determined, the children are sorted by role and trained only as merited for his or her social destination. '''5. Selection''': This refers to Darwin's theory of natural selection applied to "the favored races".

The idea is to help American society, by consciously attempting to improve the breeding stock. Schools are meant to tag the socially unfit with poor grades, remedial-schooling  placement, and other notable social punishments that their peers will then view and accept them as intellectually inferior, and effectively bar them from the reproductive (sexual, economic, and cultural) sweepstakes of life. That was the purpose of petty humiliation in school: "It was the dirt down the drain." The three functions are directly related to cultural capital, because through schooling children are discriminated by [[social class]] and cognitively placed into the destination that will make them fit to sustain that social role. That is the path leading to their determined social class; and, during the fifth function, they will be socially undesirable to the privileged children, and so kept in a low social stratum.

Paul DiMaggio expands on Bourdieu's view on cultural capital and its influence on education saying: "Following Bourdieu, I measure high school students' cultural capital using self-reports of involvement in art, music, and literature." In his journal article titled Cultural Capital and School Success: The Impact of Status Culture Participation on the Grades of U.S. High School Students in the ''American Sociological Review''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=2094962| title=Cultural Capital and School Success: The Impact of Status Culture Participation on the Grades of U.S. High School Students | journal=American Sociological Review | year=1982 | volume=47 | issue=2| doi = 10.2307/2094962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, Richard A. Peterson and A Simkus (1992) extended the cultural capital theory, exclusively on (secondary) analysis of survey  data on Americans, in 'How musical tastes mark occupational status groups', with the term "cultural omnivores" as a  particular higher status section in the US that has broader cultural engagements and tastes spanning an eclectic range from [[highbrow]] arts to [[popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Understanding cultural omnivorousness, or the myth of the cultural omnivore | author=Alan Warde|author2=David Wright|author3=Modesto Gayo-Cal|author4=Tony Bennett|author5=Elizabeth Silva|author6= Mike Savage |url=http://sifo.no/files/Alanmfl.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, it was Peterson (1992) who coined the term 'cultural omnivore' to address an anomaly observed in the evidence revealed by his work with Simkus (Peterson and Simkus, 1992) which showed that people of higher social status, contrary to elite-mass models of cultural taste developed by French scholars with French data, were not averse to participation in activities associated with popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Omnivores Versus Snobs? Musical Tastes in the United States and France | author=Christin, Angèle | year=2010 | publisher=Princeton University | url=http://www.princeton.edu/~artspol/workpap/WP40-Christin.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work rejected the universal adaptation of the cultural capital theory, especially in the 20th century in advanced post-industrialist societies like the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=raPbbFuYOG4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA152 | title=Cultivating Differences: Symbolic Boundaries and the Making of Inequality | publisher=University of Chicago Press | author=Lamont, Michèle | year=1992 | isbn=9780226468143 | chapter=How Musical Tastes Mark Occupational Status Groups | editor1=Michèle Lamont | editor2=Marcel Fournier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, Louise Archer and colleagues (2015) developed the concept of [[science capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Archer|first=Louise|last2=Dawson|first2=Emily|last3=DeWitt|first3=Jennifer|last4=Seakins|first4=Amy|last5=Wong|first5=Billy|date=2015|title="Science capital": A conceptual, methodological, and empirical argument for extending bourdieusian notions of capital beyond the arts|url=|journal=Journal of Research in Science Teaching|volume=52|pages=922–948|doi=10.1002/tea.21227}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of science capital draws from the work of Bourdieu, in particular his studies focusing on the reproduction of social inequalities in society. Science capital is made up of science related cultural capital and [[social capital]] as well as [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]]. It encapsulates the various influences that a young person's life experiences can have on their science identity and participation in science-related activities. The empirical work on science capital builds from a growing body of data into students' aspirations and attitudes to science, including [https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/departments-centres/departments/education-practice-and-society/aspires/ ASPIRES] and [http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/education/research/Research-Centres/cppr/Research/currentpro/Enterprising-Science/index.aspx Enterprising Science]. The concept of science capital was developed as a way to understand why these science-related resources, attitudes and aspirations led some children to pursue science, while others did not. The concept provides policy makers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmsctech/162/162.pdf|title=Science communication and engagement Eleventh Report of Session 2016–17|last=House of Commons|first=|publisher=House of Commons Science and Technology Committee|year=2017|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and practitioners&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/science-education-tracker-wellcome-feb16.pdf|title=Wellcome Trust: SET Development 2016|last=Wellcome Trust|first=|date=February 2016|website=Wellcome Trust|access-date=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a useful framework to help understand what shapes young people's engagement with (and potential resistance to) science.

Bourdieu's theory has been expanded to reflect modern forms of cultural capital, such as internet memes. Studies conducted by Asaf Nissenbaum and Limor Shifman &lt;ref&gt;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1461444815609313&lt;/ref&gt; on the topic of internet memes; utilised the website [https://www.4chan.org/ 4chan] to analyse how these memes can be seen as forms of cultural capital. Discourse demonstrates the different forums and mediums that memes can be expressed through, such as different 'boards' on 4chan. 

==Criticism==
Criticisms of Bourdieu's concept have been made on many grounds, including a lack of conceptual clarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sullivan, A.|year=2002|title=Bourdieu and Education: How Useful is Bourdieu's Theory for Researchers?|journal= Netherlands Journal of Social Sciences|volume=38|issue=2|pp=144–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps due to this lack of clarity, researchers have operationalised the concept in diverse ways, and have varied in their conclusions. While some researchers may be criticised for using measures of cultural capital which focus only on certain aspects of 'highbrow' culture, this is a criticism which could also be leveled at Bourdieu's own work. Several studies have attempted to refine the measurement of cultural capital, in order to examine which aspects of middle-class culture actually have value in the education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sullivan, A.|year=2001|title=Cultural Capital and Educational Attainment|journal=Sociology|volume=35|issue=4|pages=893–912|doi=10.1177/0038038501035004006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=DiMaggio, P.|year=1982|title=Cultural Capital and School Success|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=47|issue=2|pages=189–201|url=https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Stratification%20%28Gender%2C%20Race%2C%20and%20Class%29%20Copies%20of%20Articles%20from%202009/DiMaggio-ASR-1982.pdf|doi=10.2307/2094962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Crook, C.

It has been observed that Bourdieu's theory, and in particular his notion of habitus, is entirely deterministic, leaving no place for individual agency or even individual consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=DiMaggio, P.|year=1979|title=Review Essay: On Pierre Bourdieu|type=Review|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=84|issue=6|pages=1460–74|doi=10.1086/226948}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=King, A.|year=2000|title=Thinking with Bourdieu Against Bourdieu: A 'Practical' Critique of the Habitus|journal= Sociological Theory|volume=18|issue=3|pages=417–433|doi=10.1111/0735-2751.00109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bourdieu claimed to have transcended the dichotomy of structure and agency, this is not necessarily convincing. For example, the Oxford academic John Goldthorpe has long argued that:

{{quote|Bourdieu's view of the transmission of cultural capital as a key process in social reproduction is simply wrong. And the more detailed findings of the research, as noted above, could then have been taken as helping to explain just why it is wrong. That is, because differing class conditions do not give rise to such distinctive and abiding forms of habitus as Bourdieu would suppose; because even within more disadvantaged classes, with little access to high culture, values favouring education may still prevail and perhaps some relevant cultural resources exist; and because, therefore, schools and other educational institutions can function as important agencies of re-socialisation – that is, can not only underwrite but also in various respects complement, compensate for or indeed counter family influences in the creation and transmission of "cultural capital", and not just in the case of Wunderkinder but in fact on a mass scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Bourdieu has also been criticised for his lack of consideration of gender. Kanter (in Robinson &amp; Garnier, 1986) point out the lack of interest in gender inequalities in the labour market in Bourdieu's work. 
However, Bourdieu addressed the topic of gender head-on in his 2001 book ''Masculine Domination''. Bourdieu stated on the first page of the prelude in this book that he considered masculine domination to be a prime example of [[symbolic violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bourdieu, Pierre|year=2001|title=Masculine Domination|location=Stanford|publisher=Stanford University Press|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dirac large numbers hypothesis''' ('''LNH''') is an observation made by [[Paul Dirac]] in 1937 relating ratios of size scales in the [[Universe]] to that of force scales. The ratios constitute very large, dimensionless numbers: some [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1039|40 orders of magnitude]] in the present cosmological epoch. According to Dirac's hypothesis, the apparent similarity of these ratios might not be a mere coincidence but instead could imply a [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] with these unusual features:
*The strength of gravity, as represented by the [[gravitational constant]], is inversely proportional to the [[age of the universe]]: &lt;math&gt;G \propto 1/t\,&lt;/math&gt;
*The mass of the universe is proportional to the square of the universe's age: &lt;math&gt;M \propto t^2&lt;/math&gt;.
Neither of these two features has gained wide acceptance in mainstream physics.

== Background ==

LNH was Dirac's personal response to a set of large number 'coincidences' that had intrigued other theorists of his time. The 'coincidences' began with [[Hermann Weyl]] (1919),&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; who speculated that the observed radius of the universe, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt;, might also be the hypothetical radius of a particle whose rest energy is equal to the gravitational self-energy of the electron:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {R_U}{r_e}\approx \frac{r_H}{r_e} \approx 10^{42} ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_e = \frac {e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 m_e c^2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_H = \frac {e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 m_H c^2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;m_H c^2 = \frac {Gm_e^2}{r_e}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[classical electron radius]], ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of the electron, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the mass of the hypothetical particle, and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; is its electrostatic radius.

The coincidence was further developed by [[Arthur Eddington]] (1931)&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |author=A. Eddington
 |year=1931
 |title=Preliminary Note on the Masses of the Electron, the Proton, and the Universe

 |bibcode=1931PCPS...27...15E
 |doi=10.1017/S0305004100009269
}}&lt;/ref&gt; who related the above ratios to '''N''', the estimated number of charged particles in the universe:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 Gm_e^2} \approx \sqrt {N} \approx 10^{42}.&lt;/math&gt;

In addition to the examples of Weyl and Eddington, Dirac was also influenced by the [[primeval-atom hypothesis]] of [[Georges Lemaître]], who lectured on the topic in Cambridge in 1933. The notion of a varying-G cosmology first appears in the work of [[Edward Arthur Milne]] a few years before Dirac formulated LNH. Milne was inspired not by large number coincidences but by a dislike of Einstein's [[general theory of relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Milne, space was not a structured object but simply a system of reference in which relations such as this could accommodate Einstein's conclusions:
:&lt;math&gt;G = \left(\frac{c^3}{M_U}\right)t,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''M''&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of the universe and ''t'' is the age of the universe in seconds. According to this relation, ''G'' increases over time.

== Dirac's interpretation of the large number coincidences==

The Weyl and Eddington ratios above can be rephrased in a variety of ways, as for instance in the context of time:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {ct}{r_e} \approx 10^{40},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' is the age of the universe, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]] and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the classical electron radius. Hence, in units where ''c''=1 and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, the age of the universe is about 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; units of time. This is the same [[order of magnitude]] as the ratio of the [[electromagnetic force|electrical]] to the [[gravitational]] [[force]]s between a [[proton]] and an [[electron]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 G m_p m_e} \approx 10^{40}.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, interpreting the [[electric charge|charge]] &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; of the [[electron]], the [[mass]] &lt;math&gt;m_p&lt;/math&gt;/&lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; of the proton/electron, and the permittivity factor &lt;math&gt; 4 \pi \epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; in atomic units (equal to 1), the value of the [[gravitational constant]] is approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−40&lt;/sup&gt;. Dirac interpreted this to mean that &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; varies with time as &lt;math&gt;G \approx 1/t\,&lt;/math&gt;. Although [[George Gamow]] noted that such a temporal variation does not necessarily follow from Dirac's assumptions,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a corresponding change of G has not been found.&lt;ref&gt;

 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.75.403
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to general relativity, however, G is constant, otherwise the law of conserved energy is violated. Dirac met this difficulty by introducing into the [[Einstein field equations]] a gauge function {{lang|grc|β}} that describes the structure of spacetime in terms of a ratio of gravitational and electromagnetic units. He also provided alternative scenarios for the continuous creation of matter, one of the other significant issues in LNH:
*'additive' creation (new matter is created uniformly throughout space) and
*'multiplicative' creation (new matter is created where there are already concentrations of mass).

== Later developments and interpretations ==

Dirac's theory has inspired and continues to inspire a significant body of scientific literature in a variety of disciplines. In the context of [[geophysics]], for instance, [[Edward Teller]] seemed to raise a serious objection to LNH in 1948&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; how a simple revision of the parameters (in this case, the age of the Solar System) can invalidate Teller's conclusions. The debate is further complicated by the choice of LNH [[Cosmology|cosmologies]]: In 1978, G. Blake&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that paleontological data is consistent with the 'multiplicative' scenario but not the 'additive' scenario. Arguments both for and against LNH are also made from astrophysical considerations. For example, D. Falik&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that it ''is'' consistent. One argument that has created significant controversy was put forward by [[Robert Dicke]] in 1961. Known as the [[anthropic coincidence]] or [[fine-tuned universe]], it simply states that the large numbers in LNH are a necessary coincidence for intelligent beings since they parametrize [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] of [[hydrogen]] in [[star]]s and hence carbon-based [[life]] would not arise otherwise.

Various authors have introduced new sets of numbers into the original 'coincidence' considered by Dirac and his contemporaries, thus broadening or even departing from Dirac's own conclusions. Jordan (1947)&lt;ref&gt;

Several authors have recently identified and pondered the significance of yet another large number, approximately [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#Larger than 10100|120 orders of magnitude]]. This is for example the ratio of the theoretical and observational estimates of the [[Vacuum energy|energy density of the vacuum]], which Nottale (1993)&lt;ref&gt;

Early harvest scheme is a precursor to a [[free trade agreement]] (FTA) between two trading partners. This is to help the two trading countries to identify certain products for tariff liberalisation pending the conclusion of FTA negotiation. It is primarily a confidence building measure.

'''Earth orbit rendezvous''' ('''EOR''') is a potential methodology for conducting round trip human flights to the Moon, involving the use of [[space rendezvous]] to assemble, and possibly fuel, components of a translunar vehicle in [[low Earth orbit]].&lt;ref&gt;"LOW EARTH ORBIT RENDEZVOUS STRATEGY FOR LUNAR MISSIONS" http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc06papers/158.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  It was considered and ultimately rejected in favor of [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] (LOR) for [[NASA]]'s [[Apollo Program]] of the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;"Lunar Orbit Rendezvous and the Apollo Program" http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/Rendezvous.html&lt;/ref&gt; Three decades later, it was planned to be used for [[Project Constellation]], until that program’s [[Barack Obama space policy speech at Kennedy Space Center|cancellation in October 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;Connolly, John F. (October 2006). "Constellation Program Overview" http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/163092main_constellation_program_overview.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gemini and Agena target vehicle==
The [[Agena target vehicle]] (ATV) was used for testing Earth orbit rendezvous in the NASA [[Gemini Program]]. [[Gemini 6]] and [[Gemini 7]] rendezvoused in orbit in 1965, but without Agena. Next, [[Gemini 8]] successfully docked  with the Agena on March 16, 1966. The Agena-Gemini rendezvous also achieved other objectives in later Gemini launches, including docked orbital maneuvering ([[Gemini 10]] and [[Gemini 11]]), inspection of the abandoned Gemini 8 ATV (Gemini 10) and space walks ([[Gemini 12]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/124970031|title=Spaceflight : the complete story from Sputnik to shuttle -- and beyond|last=Sparrow|first=Giles|date=2007|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Ltd|year=2007|isbn=9781405318181|location=London|pages=110|oclc=124970031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apollo==
[[File:Apollo Earth Orbit Rendezvous - 10 launches required.jpg|thumb|200px|1961 sketch showing 10 C-1 launches required to assemble in Earth orbit an Apollo lunar landing mission.]]
The EOR proposal for Apollo consisted of using a series of small [[rocket]]s half the size of a [[Saturn V]] to put different components of a [[spacecraft]] to go to the Moon in [[orbit]] around the [[Earth]], then assemble them in orbit.  Experiments of [[Project Gemini]] involving docking with the [[Agena target vehicle]] were designed partly to test the [[Logical possibility|feasibility]] of this program.{{fact|date=October 2016}}

In the end, NASA employed the [[Lunar Orbit Rendezvous]] for the [[Project Apollo|Apollo Program]]: a  Saturn V would simultaneously lift both the [[Apollo Command Module|Apollo Command]] and [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Modules]] into low Earth orbit, and then the Saturn V third stage would fire again ([[Trans-lunar injection]]) to send both spacecraft to the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Constellation==
This mode had been revived for [[Project Constellation]] as the [[Earth Departure Stage]] (EDS) and [[Altair (spacecraft)|Altair]] (LSAM), which would be launched into low Earth orbit on the [[Ares V]] rocket.  The EDS and Altair would  be met by the separately launched [[Orion (Constellation program)|Orion]] (CEV). Once joined in low Earth orbit, the three would then travel out to the Moon and the Orion/Altair combination would fly a [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] flight pattern.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The '''engineering design process''' is a methodical series of steps that engineers use in creating functional products and processes. The process is highly [[iterative]] - parts of the process often need to be repeated many times before another can be entered - though the part(s) that get iterated and the number of such cycles in any given project may vary.

{{quote|…It is a [[decision making]] process (often iterative) in which the basic sciences, mathematics, and engineering sciences are applied to convert resources optimally to meet a stated objective.  Among the fundamental elements of the [[design process]] are the establishment of objectives and criteria, synthesis, analysis, construction, testing and evaluation.|[[ABET]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.me.unlv.edu/Undergraduate/coursenotes/meg497/ABETdefinition.htm|title=ABET Definition of Design: "Engineering design is the process of devising a system, component, or process to meet desired needs|author=|date=|website=www.me.unlv.edu|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The steps tend to get articulated, subdivided, and/or illustrated in different ways, but they generally reflect certain core principles regarding the underlying concepts and their respective sequence and interrelationship.

==Common Stages of the Engineering Design Process==

One framing of the engineering design process delineates the following stages: ''research, conceptualization, feasibility assessment, establishing design requirements, preliminary design, detailed design, production planning and tool design, and production''.&lt;ref name="refB"&gt;Ertas, A. &amp; Jones, J. (1996). The Engineering Design Process. 2nd ed. New York, N.Y., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, noting that "different authors (in both research literature and in textbooks) define different phases of the design process with varying activities occurring within them," have suggested more simplified/generalized models - such as ''problem definition, conceptual design, preliminary design, detailed design, and design communication''.&lt;ref&gt;Dym, C.L. &amp; Little, P. (2009). Engineering Design. 3rd ed. New York, N.Y., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; A standard summary of the process in European engineering design literature is that of ''clarification of the task, conceptual design, embodiment design, detail design''.&lt;ref&gt;Pahl, G. &amp; Beitz, W. (1988). Engineering Design: a systematic approach. London, UK, The Design Council.&lt;/ref&gt; In these examples, other key aspects - such as concept evaluation and prototyping - are subsets and/or extensions of one or more of the listed steps. It's also important to understand that in these as well as other articulations of the process, different terminology employed may have varying degrees of overlap, which affects what steps get stated explicitly or deemed "high level" versus subordinate in any given model.

===Research===
Various stages of the design process (and even earlier) can involve a significant amount of time spent on locating information and [[research]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;A.Eide, R.Jenison, L.Mashaw, L.Northup. Engineering: Fundamentals and Problem Solving. New York City: McGraw-Hill Companies Inc.,2002&lt;/ref&gt; Consideration should be given to the existing applicable literature, problems and successes associated with existing solutions, costs, and marketplace needs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The source of information should be relevant, including existing solutions.  [[Reverse engineering]] can be an effective technique if other solutions are available on the market.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Other sources of information include the Internet, local [[libraries]], available government documents, personal organizations, [[trade journal]]s, vendor catalogs and individual [[experts]] available.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Design requirements===
Establishing design [[requirements]] and conducting [[requirement analysis]], sometimes termed '''problem definition''' (or deemed a related activity), is one of the most important elements in the design process,&lt;ref&gt;Ralph, P., and Wand, Y. A Proposal for a Formal Definition of the Design Concept. In, Lyytinen, K., Loucopoulos, P., [[John Mylopoulos|Mylopoulos, J.]], and Robinson, W., (eds.), Design Requirements Engineering: A Ten-Year Perspective: Springer-Verlag, 2009, pp. 103-136.&lt;/ref&gt; and this task is often performed at the same time as a feasibility analysis. The design requirements control the design of the product or process being developed, throughout the engineering design process. These include basic things like the functions, attributes, and [[specification]]s - determined after assessing user needs. Some design requirements include hardware and software parameters, [[maintainability]], [[availability]], and [[testability]].&lt;ref name="refB"/&gt;

===Feasibility===
In some cases, a [[feasibility study]] is carried out after which schedules, resource plans and estimates for the next phase are developed. The feasibility study is an evaluation and analysis of the potential of a proposed project to support the process of [[decision making]]. It outlines and analyses alternatives or methods of achieving the desired outcome. The feasibility study helps to narrow the scope of the project to identify the best scenario.
A feasibility report is generated following which Post Feasibility Review is performed.

The purpose of a feasibility assessment is to determine whether the engineer's project can proceed into the [[design phase]].  This is based on two criteria: the project needs to be based on an achievable idea, and it needs to be within [[cost accounting|cost constraint]]s. It is important to have engineers with experience and good judgment to be involved in this portion of the feasibility study.&lt;ref name="refB"/&gt;

===Conceptualization===
A concept study ([[conceptualization]], [[conceptual design]]) is often a phase of project planning that includes producing ideas and taking into account the pros and cons of implementing those ideas. This stage of a project is done to minimize the likelihood of error, manage costs, [[risk assessment|assess risks]], and evaluate the potential success of the intended project. In any event, once an engineering issue or problem is defined, potential solutions must be identified.  These solutions can be found by using [[Ideation (idea generation)|ideation]], the mental process by which ideas are generated. In fact, this step is often termed '''Ideation''' or "Concept Generation." The following are widely used techniques:&lt;ref name="refB"/&gt;

*trigger word - a word or phrase associated with the issue at hand is stated, and subsequent words and phrases are evoked.  
*[[morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis]] - independent design characteristics are listed in a chart, and different engineering solutions are proposed for each solution.  Normally, a preliminary sketch and short report accompany the morphological chart.
*[[synectics]] - the engineer imagines him or herself as the item and asks, "What would I do if I were the system?"  This unconventional method of thinking may find a solution to the problem at hand. The vital aspects of the conceptualization step is synthesis. Synthesis is the process of taking the element of the concept and arranging them in the proper way. Synthesis creative process is present in every design.
*[[brainstorming]] - this popular method involves thinking of different ideas, typically as part of a small group, and adopting these ideas in some form as a solution to the problem

Various generated ideas must then undergo a '''concept evaluation''' step, which utilizes various tools to compare and contrast the relative strengths and weakness of possible alternatives.

===Preliminary design===
The preliminary design, or high-level design includes  (also called [[Front-end engineering|FEED]]), often bridges a gap between design conception and detailed design, particularly in cases where the level of conceptualization achieved during ideation is not sufficient for full evaluation. So in this task, the overall system configuration is defined, and [[schematic]]s, [[diagram]]s, and [[:wikt:layout|layout]]s of the project may provide early project configuration. (This notably varies a lot by field, industry, and product.) During detailed design and optimization, the parameters of the part being created will change, but the preliminary design focuses on creating the general framework to build the project on.&lt;ref name="refB"/&gt;

S. Blanchard and J. Fabrycky describe it as:
“The ‘whats’ initiating conceptual design produce ‘hows’ from the conceptual design evaluation effort applied to feasible conceptual design concepts. Next, the ‘hows’ are taken into preliminary design through the means of allocated requirements. There they become ‘whats’ and drive preliminary design to address ‘hows’ at this lower level.”

===Detailed design===
Following FEED is the Detailed Design (Detailed Engineering) phase, which may consist of [[procurement]] of materials as well.
This phase further elaborates each aspect of the project/product by complete description through [[solid modeling]], [[drawings]] as well as [[specification]]s.

===Design for manufacturability=== 
[[Design for manufacturability]] (DFM) is the general engineering art of designing products in such a way that they are easy to manufacture.

*Operating parameters
*Operating and nonoperating environmental stimuli
*Test requirements
*External dimensions
*Maintenance and testability provisions
*Materials requirements
*[[Reliability engineering|Reliability]] requirements
*External surface treatment
*Design life
*[[Packaging]] requirements
*External marking

[[Computer-aided design]] (CAD) programs have made detailed design phase more efficient.  For example, a CAD program can provide [[optimization]] to reduce volume without hindering a part's quality.  It can also calculate [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] and [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] using the [[finite element method]] to determine stresses throughout the part. &lt;ref name="refC"&gt;Widas, P. (1997, April 9). Introduction to finite element analysis. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.sv.vt.edu/classes/MSE2094_NoteBook/97ClassProj/num/widas/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514233218/http://www.sv.vt.edu/classes/MSE2094_NoteBook/97ClassProj/num/widas/history.html |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production planning===
The [[production planning]] and tool design consists of planning how to [[mass-produce]] the product and which tools should be used in the [[manufacturing]] process.  Tasks to complete in this step include selecting materials, selection of the production processes, determination of the sequence of operations, and selection of tools such as jigs, fixtures, metal cutting and metal or plastics forming tools.  This task also involves additional [[prototype testing]] iterations to ensure the mass-produced version meets [[qualification testing]] standards.&lt;ref name="refB"/&gt;

==Comparison with the Scientific Method==
Engineering is formulating a problem that can be solved through design. Science is formulating a question that can be solved through investigation. 
The engineering design process bears some similarity to the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt; Braha, Dan; Maimon, Oded (1997).

An '''equatorial ring''' was an astronomical instrument used in the [[Hellenistic world]] to determine the exact moment of the [[spring (season)|spring]] and [[autumn]] [[equinoxes]]. Equatorial rings were placed before the temples in [[Alexandria]], in [[Rhodes]], and perhaps in other places, for [[calendar]] purposes. 

The easiest way to understand the use of an equatorial ring is to imagine a ring placed vertically in the east-west plane at the Earth's [[equator]]. At the time of the equinoxes, the [[Sun]] will rise precisely in the [[east]], move across the [[zenith]], and set precisely in the [[west]]. Throughout the day, the bottom half of the ring will be in the shadow cast by the top half of the ring. On other days of the year, the Sun passes to the [[north]] or [[south]] of the ring, and will illuminate the bottom half. For [[latitudes]] away from the equator, the ring merely needs to be placed at the correct angle in the equatorial plane. At the Earth's [[Geographical pole|poles]], the ring would be [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]].

The equatorial ring was about one to two [[cubits]] (45cm-90cm) in diameter. Because the Sun is not a point source of light, the width of the shadow on the bottom half of the ring is slightly less than the width of the ring. By waiting until the shadow was centered on the ring, the time of the equinox could be fixed to within an hour or so. If the equinox happened at [[night]], or if the sky was [[cloudy]], an interpolation could be made between two days' measurements.

The main disadvantage with the equatorial ring is that it needed to be aligned very precisely or false measurements could occur. [[Ptolemy]] mentions in the ''[[Almagest]]'' that one of the equatorial rings in use in Alexandria had shifted slightly, which meant that the instrument showed the equinox occurring twice on the same day. False readings can also be produced by [[atmospheric refraction]] of the Sun when it is close to the [[horizon]].

Equatorial rings can also be found on [[armillary sphere]]s and equatorial [[sundials]].

'''Experimetrics''' refers to the application of [[econometrics]] to [[economics]] experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Camerer, ''Behavioral Game Theory: Experiments in Strategic Interaction'' (2003), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;  Experimetrics refers to formal procedures used in designed investigations of economic hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;Houser, D. (2008) [http://mason.gmu.edu/~dhouser/experimetrics.pdf "Experiments and Econometrics"] In: Durlauf, S. and Blume L. (Eds.), New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd edition. Palgrave-MacMillan. {{ISBN|0-333-78676-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

One branch of experimetrics uses experiments to evaluate the performance of econometric estimators &lt;ref&gt;Cox,J.C., Oaxaca, R.L. (2009) "Chapter 114 Experimetrics: The Use of Market Experiments to Evaluate the Performance of Econometric Estimators", In: Charles R. Plott and Vernon L. Smith, Editor(s) (2008) ''Handbook of Experimental Economics Results'', Elsevier, 2008, Volume 1, Pages 1078-1086, {{ISBN|978-0-444-82642-8}}, {{DOI| 10.1016/S1574-0722(07)00114-X}} [https://excen.gsu.edu/jccox/research/Experimetrics.pdf PDF preprint]&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, experimetrics is the field of study that lies at the intersection of [[experimental economics]] and econometrics.  It refers to a  broad swath of the economics literature, and encompasses both the theoretical and statistical basis of econometrics, as well as the methodology of the experimental method.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4446">In [[English language|English]] [[grammar]], a '''flat adverb''' or '''bare adverb''' is an [[adverb]] that has the same form as a related [[adjective]].&lt;ref name=garner&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=FwmQpyibKkAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA879#v=onepage&amp;q=%22flat%20adverb%22&amp;f=false Garner's Modern American Usage], p. 897&lt;/ref&gt; It does not end in ''-ly'', e.g.  "drive ''slow''", "drive ''fast''". A flat adverb is sometimes also called ''simple adverb''.&lt;ref name=oos&gt;  {{Cite book |title= Origins of the Specious: Myths and Misconceptions of the English Language |page=30 |last1=O'Conner |first1=P.T.  |last2= Kellerman |first2=S. |isbn=9781588368560 |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=2Ju-Vu0v6GQC&amp;pg=PA30 |date= 2009 |publisher= Random House Publishing Group}} &lt;/ref&gt; Flat adverbs were once quite common but have been largely replaced by their ''-ly'' counterparts. In the 18th century, grammarians believed flat adverbs to be adjectives, and insisted that adverbs needed to end in ''-ly''. According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, "It's these grammarians we have to thank for ... the sad lack of flat adverbs today".&lt;ref name="mw"&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/video/drive-safe-in-praise-of-flat-adverbs "Drive Safe: In Praise of Flat Adverbs" with Emily Brewster], part of the "Ask the Editor" series at Merriam-Webster.com&lt;/ref&gt; There are now only a few flat adverbs, and some are widely thought of as incorrect.&lt;ref name="mwfa"&gt; {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7C6V9zRxSPkC&amp;lpg=PA373&amp;dq=flat%20adverbs&amp;pg=PA373|title=Merriam-Webster's Manual for Writers and Editors|last1=Merriam-Webster, Inc|date=1998|publisher=Merriam-Webster|isbn=9780877796220|page=373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite bare adverbs being grammatically correct and widely used by respected authors, they are often incorrectly stigmatized.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wc/when-adverbs-fall-flat/ When Adverbs Fall Flat], including list of the most common bare adverbs&lt;/ref&gt; There have been public campaigns against street signs with the traditional text "go slow" and the innovative text "drive friendly".&lt;ref name="oos" /&gt;

=== Bare adverbs that alternate with -ly forms ===
For most bare adverbs, an alternative form exists ending in ''-ly'' (''slowly''). ''S''ometimes the -ly form has a different meaning (''hardly'', ''nearly'', ''cleanly'', ''rightly'', ''closely'', ''lowly''), and sometimes the -ly form  is not used for certain meanings (''sit tight'', ''sleep tight'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TkKVwYcG8Q4C&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=flat%20adverbs&amp;pg=PA125#v=onepage&amp;q=flat%20adverbs&amp;f=false Working with Words: An Introduction to English Linguistics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mw" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailywritingtips.com/flat-adverbs-are-flat-out-useful Flat Adverbs Are Flat-Out Useful]&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Bare adverbs that don't alternate ===
Some bare adverbs don't alternate; e.g. ''fast'', ''soon'', ''straight'', ''tough'', ''far'', ''low.'' In addition, the ending ''-ly'' is also found on some words that are both adverbs and adjectives (e.g. ''friendly'') and some words that are only adjectives (e.g. ''lonely'').

=== Analyses of bare adverbs ===

=== Acceptability over time ===
A survey carried out in the 1960s studied peoples attitudes towards usage problems in English. The examples "you'd better go slow" (rather than ''slowly'') and "he did it quicker than he'd ever done it before" (rather than ''more quickly'') contained flat adverbs – and the latter was found to be acceptable by just 42% of respondents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Attitudes to English Usage: An Enquiry by the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne Institute of Education English Research Group|last=Mittens|first=W.H.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1970|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a follow-up by the Leiden University Centre for Linguistics, using the same examples from the 1960s survey and others containing flat adverbs, they found that acceptance of flat adverbs has become much more widespread in recent years. ''Quicker'' was found to have an acceptance rate of 75%, while "you'd better go slow" was universally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tieken-Boon van Ostade|first=Ingrid|date=2015|title="Flat Adverbs: Acceptable Today?"|url=|journal=English Today|volume=31|pages=9-10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[statistics]], the '''generalized Pareto distribution''' (GPD) is a family of continuous [[probability distribution]]s. It is often used to model the tails of another distribution. It is specified by three parameters: location &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, scale &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, and shape &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=An Introduction to Statistical Modeling of Extreme Values |last=Coles |first=Stuart |publisher=Springer |page=75 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2nugUEaKqFEC |isbn=9781852334598 |date=2001-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dargahi-Noubary | first1 = G.

==Definition==
The standard cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the GPD is defined by&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Embrechts |first1=Paul |last2=Klüppelberg |first2=Claudia |last3=Mikosch |first3=Thomas |title=Modelling extremal events for insurance and finance |page=162 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BXOI2pICfJUC |isbn=9783540609315 |date=1997-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;F_{\xi}(z) = \begin{cases}
1 - \left(1+ \xi z\right)^{-1/\xi} &amp; \text{for }\xi \neq 0, \\
1 - e^{-z} &amp; \text{for }\xi = 0.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the support is &lt;math&gt; z \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; \xi \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; 0 \leq z \leq - 1 /\xi &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; \xi &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;f_{\xi}(z) = \begin{cases}
(\xi  z+1)^{-\frac{\xi +1}{\xi }} &amp; \text{for }\xi \neq 0, \\
e^{-z} &amp; \text{for }\xi = 0.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Characterization==
The related location-scale family of distributions is obtained by replacing the argument ''z'' by &lt;math&gt;\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; and adjusting the support accordingly: The [[cumulative distribution function]] is

: &lt;math&gt;F_{(\xi,\mu,\sigma)}(x) = \begin{cases}
1 - \left(1+ \frac{\xi(x-\mu)}{\sigma}\right)^{-1/\xi} &amp; \text{for }\xi \neq 0, \\
1 - \exp \left(-\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right) &amp; \text{for }\xi = 0.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt; x \geqslant \mu &lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt; \xi \geqslant 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \mu \leqslant x \leqslant \mu - \sigma /\xi &lt;/math&gt;  when &lt;math&gt; \xi &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mu\in\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\xi\in\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[probability density function]] (pdf) is

: &lt;math&gt;f_{(\xi,\mu,\sigma)}(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma}\left(1 + \frac{\xi (x-\mu)}{\sigma}\right)^{\left(-\frac{1}{\xi} - 1\right)}&lt;/math&gt;,

or equivalently

: &lt;math&gt;f_{(\xi,\mu,\sigma)}(x) = \frac{\sigma^{\frac{1}{\xi}}}{\left(\sigma + \xi (x-\mu)\right)^{\frac{1}{\xi}+1}}&lt;/math&gt;,

again, for &lt;math&gt; x \geqslant \mu &lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt; \xi \geqslant 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \mu \leqslant x \leqslant \mu - \sigma /\xi &lt;/math&gt;  when &lt;math&gt; \xi &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

The pdf is a solution of the following [[differential equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{array}{l}
f'(x) (-\mu \xi +\sigma+\xi x)+(\xi+1) f(x)=0, \\
f(0)=\frac{\left(1-\frac{\mu \xi}{\sigma}\right)^{-\frac{1}{\xi }-1}}{\sigma}
\end{array}\right\}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Special cases==
*If the shape &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; and location &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; are both zero, the GPD is equivalent to the [[exponential distribution]].
*With shape &lt;math&gt;\xi &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and location &lt;math&gt;\mu = \sigma/\xi&lt;/math&gt;, the GPD is equivalent to the [[Pareto distribution]] with scale &lt;math&gt;x_m=\sigma/\xi&lt;/math&gt; and shape &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1/\xi&lt;/math&gt;.
*If &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;GPD&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mu  = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; Y = \log (X)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;exGPD&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mu  = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;)&lt;/math&gt;, where exGPD is the [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03610926.2018.1441418 exponentiated generalized Pareto distribution]. Unlike GPD, exGPD has moments of all orders regardless of its parameter conditions and possesses separate interpretations for the scale parameter and shape parameter, which makes parameter estimation more efficient.
*GPD is quite similar to the [[Burr distribution]].

== Generating generalized Pareto random variables ==
If ''U'' is [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly distributed]] on
(0,&amp;nbsp;1&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt; X = \mu + \frac{\sigma (U^{-\xi}-1)}{\xi} \sim \mbox{GPD}(\mu, \sigma, \xi \neq 0)&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; X = \mu - \sigma \ln(U) \sim \mbox{GPD}(\mu,\sigma,\xi =0).&lt;/math&gt;

Both formulas are obtained by inversion of the cdf.

In Matlab Statistics Toolbox, you can easily use "gprnd" command to generate generalized Pareto random numbers.

=== GPD as an Exponential-Gamma Mixture ===

A GPD random variable can also be expressed as an exponential random variable, with a Gamma distributed rate parameter. 

:&lt;math&gt;X|\Lambda \sim Exp(\Lambda)   &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda \sim Gamma(\alpha, \beta)   &lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;X \sim GPD(\xi = 1/\alpha, \ \sigma = \beta/\alpha)   &lt;/math&gt;

Notice however, that since the parameters for the Gamma distribution must be greater than zero, we obtain the additional restrictions that:&lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; must be positive.

'''Heather Dewey-Hagborg''' (born June 4, 1982, [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]) is an information artist and [[Do-it-yourself biology|bio-hacker]].&lt;ref name="Brodwin, E."/&gt; She is most noted for her project [[#Stranger Visions|''Stranger Visions'']]: a series of portraits created from [[DNA]] she recovered from discarded items, such as hair, cigarettes and chewing gum while living in [[Brooklyn, New York]].&lt;ref name="Aldous, Peter"/&gt; She sequenced the DNA at the Brooklyn open [[biotechnology]] laboratory, [[Genspace]].&lt;ref name="Wang, L."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson Center"/&gt; From the extracted DNA, she determined gender, ethnicity and other factors and then used face-generating software and a [[3D printer]] to create a speculative, algorithmically determined 3D portrait. While critical of technology and surveillance, her work has been found disturbing by some critics.&lt;ref name="Aldous, P."/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/04/tech/innovation/dna-face-sculptures/ Natalie Angley, "Artist creates faces from DNA left in public"], CNN.com, September 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:Spurious Memories.jpg|thumb|''Spurious Memories'' (2007)]]
Dewey-Hagborg is an information and bio artist whose works explore the intersection between art and science.&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."&gt;{{cite web|last1=Colanduno|first1=Derek|authorlink=Derek Colanduno|title=Pieces of You #223|url=http://www.skepticality.com/piecesofyou|website=Skepticality|accessdate=August 5, 2014|date=December 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a student in the Information Arts program at [[Bennington College]],&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, A."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Alec|title=Mask Crusader|journal=New Yorker|date=July 1, 2013|volume=89|issue=19|pages=22–23|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/07/01/mask-crusader|accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; she participated in computer science classes, which laid the groundwork for the science-based artwork she would later envision using [[algorithms]], [[electronics]], and [[computer programming]].&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt; She earned a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in 2003.

Dewey-Hagborg continued refining her work as an artist and computer programmer, studying [[artificial intelligence]],&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt; while obtaining a Master of Professional Studies (M.P.S.) in Interactive Telecommunications from [[New York University]] (NYU)&lt;ref name="Schwendener1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwendener|first1=Martha|title=Populism, Technology, and Interactivity|publisher=The New York Times|date=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007. It was here she curated a robotic performance art show called ''Robots on the March!'' in March 2005, and exhibited a piece called ''Lighter than Air: an experiment in constructing an autonomous flying robot''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photosynthesis and Experiments in Sustainable Robotics|url=http://www.atasite.org/calendar/archive/index-24133.html|website=Artists' Television Access|accessdate=August 5, 2014|date=March 25 – April 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dewey-Hagborg|first1=Heather|title=Lighter Than Air|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJmu-AzrXH4|website=YouTube|accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a final project at NYU, Dewey-Hagborg explored the question "Can computers be creative?" in an exhibit she called Spurious Memories. She developed an autonomous face categorizing and generating software program which recognized facial components, made comparisons and adjustments, and produced unique representations of the human face through mass exposure to facial images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dewey-Hagborg|first1=Heather|title=Spurious Memories|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1elpx1rz_R0|website=YouTube|accessdate=August 5, 2014|date=April 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected projects==
===Totem===
[[File:Heather Dewey-Hagborg Totem.jpg|thumb|''Totem'' (2010)]]
Dewey-Hagborg's ''Totem'' (2010) was a site-specific multimedia sculpture characterizing her earlier work. ''Totem'', an idol, was designed to explore the implications of language and artificial intelligence using [[machine learning]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Event Guide July thru December 2011|url=http://issuu.com/groundsforsculpture/docs/summerfall2011|website=ISSUU.com|accessdate=August 5, 2014|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploiting audio surveillance techniques to eavesdrop on and record conversations at the installation site, Dewey-Hagborg wrote algorithms to then isolate word sequences and grammatical structures into commonly used units. Influenced by [[Hebbian theory]], she programmed the sculpture's computer to generate speech based on the most frequently occurring language structures in any given recording period. Over time, the least frequently elicited words or units would fade or be dropped from the sculpture's spoken vocabulary. The remaining units, stored in the sculpture's memory, were then spoken at random intervals.&lt;ref name=Totem/&gt;

The piece also reflected the writings of psychologist [[Julian Jaynes]]. According to Dewey-Hagborg, Jaynes theorized that an early form of human consciousness evolved as a result of hallucinated speech experienced by the Mari civilization of the [[Euphrates]]. The ancient people interpreted water trickling through a goddess statue as whispers or vocalizations from the goddess herself.&lt;ref name=Totem/&gt; Dewey-Hagborg saw a parallel between the "mystical and authoritative power of language in the ancient world and the force of power of technology today"&lt;ref name="Totem"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dewey-Hagborg|first1=Heather|title=Totem|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsTu3Iv1408|website=YouTube|accessdate=August 5, 2014|date=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, with this piece, sought to explore how technology is used to shape public opinion and behavior.

Martha Schwendener, of ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote that ''Totem'' showed promise, but, because of audio difficulties and its fragmented, randomly generated speech, the piece "failed to connect human speech, meaning, and technology in a profound fashion."&lt;ref name="Schwendener, M."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwendener|first1=Martha|title=Populism, Technology, and Interactivity|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/28/nyregion/at-grounds-for-sculpture-works-by-james-surls-and-daniel-henderson-review.html?_r=0|accessdate=August 5, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of her research for ''Stranger Visions'', Dewey-Hagborg took a three-week crash-course&lt;ref name="Wang, L."/&gt; in biotechnology at Genspace, a non-profit, community-based biotechnology laboratory in New York. She was astonished to learn how much an amateur biologist could learn about someone.&lt;ref name="Brodwin, E."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang, L."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Linda|title=Guarding Our DNA: Art project exposes the vulnerability of the genetic material we unintentionally leave behind|journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|date=June 24, 2013|volume=91|issue=25|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pauwels|first1=Eleanore|title=Leave me your DNA ... and I'll 3-D print your face|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/01/dna-art-recreate-faces|accessdate=August 7, 2014|work=The Guardian|date=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She began the process of extracting DNA from the samples she collected. The extraction involves treating a hair sample, for example, with a gel that dissolves the hair, and a primer specifically developed to help locate characteristics like eye color or gender along the [[genome]].&lt;ref name="Squires, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gruber, B."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gruber|first1=Ben|title=Artist stirs privacy debate with portraits from DNA|url=https://www.reuters.com/video/2013/07/02/artist-stirs-privacy-debate-with-portrai?videoId=243713123|accessdate=August 7, 2014|work=Reuters|date=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey-Hagborg might repeat this process up to 40 times,&lt;ref name="Andersen, K."/&gt; looking for genetic variants influencing traits like eye color, hair color, and racial ancestry, in order to complete a portrait.&lt;ref name="Aldous, P."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aldous|first1=Peter|title=Artwork highlights legal debate over 'abandoned' DNA|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23677-artworks-highlight-legal-debate-over-abandoned-dna.html#.U-N6YUi9g7A|accessdate=August 7, 2014|work=New Scientist|date=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the DNA strands are extracted from the samples, Dewey-Hagborg then amplifies, or copies, specific regions of the genome, using a technique called [[Polymerase Chain Reaction]], or PCR, a process advanced by [[Kary Mullis]], a winner of the [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry (1993).&lt;ref name="Dawsey, J"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang, L."/&gt; These amplified regions of the genome make it possible to identifying [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]], or SNPs (pronounced "snips"),&lt;ref name=Passarello/&gt; which contain variables in the base pairs that give clues to a person's individual genetic make up (e.g., whether or not a person's eyes might be blue, brown or green). These results are then sent for analysis to a company for sequencing. Dewey-Hagborg used [[23andMe]],&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, K."/&gt; a DNA analysis service, for ''Stranger Visions''.

The genetic blueprint&lt;ref name="Squires, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gruber, B."/&gt; she receives in return is a text file full of coded information identifying the unique positioning of the 4 [[nucleobase]]s [[adenine]], [[thymine]], [[cytosine]], and [[guanine]], or ATC and G, that make up the sections of the genome she is interested in.&lt;ref name="Squires, A."/&gt; This data is then entered into a customized computer program she wrote.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, A."/&gt; The program interprets the code and provides her with a list of traits, including propensity for obesity, eye color, hair color, hair curl, skin tone, freckles, and gender.&lt;ref name="Wang, L."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."/&gt; She then takes these traits, as many as 50, and enters them into a face-generating program to configure the 3-D portraits.&lt;ref name="Brodwin, E."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang, L."/&gt; Her previous experience with facial recognition algorithms gave her the ability to repurpose an existing [[facial recognition system|facial recognition program]], from [[Basel]], Switzerland.&lt;ref name="Walters, H."&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walters|first1=Helen|title=A Portrait from a Single Hair: The Work of Heather-Dewey Hagborg|url=http://ideas.ted.com/2013/06/20/generating-a-sculpture-from-a-hair-the-work-of-heather-dewey-hagborg/|website=Ideas.Ted.Com|accessdate=August 7, 2014|date=June 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She reworked the program to generate faces instead of just recognizing facial features.&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt; The resulting model changes facial dimensions (e.g., width of the nose and mouth) and characteristics with the genetic information it receives. Before making the final 3-D print,&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."/&gt; Dewey-Hagborg generates several different versions of the face, finally choosing the one she finds most aesthetically pleasing.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, K."&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Kurt|title=Making Portraits out of DNA|url=http://www.studio360.org/story/267842-making-portraits-out-of-dna|website=Studio 360|accessdate=August 7, 2014|date=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of Dewey-Hagborg's ''Stranger Visions'' question whether or not the work crosses ethical and legal boundaries.&lt;ref name="Aldous, Peter"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aldous|first1=Peter|title=Who's looking through your discarded DNA?|journal=New Scientist|date=2013-06-15|volume=281|issue=2921|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They make a distinction between an artist's right to express societal concerns through artwork and the act of collecting personal, genetic information without informed consent.&lt;ref name="Gruber, B."/&gt; The fact that DNA samples are regularly "left behind" or abandoned does not mean those people have relinquished their interest in how that information is used.&lt;ref name="Wilson Center"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aldous, P."/&gt;&lt;ref name=Passarello/&gt;

Some laws, like that of the [[Human Tissue Act of 2004]] in the United Kingdom, prohibit private individuals from collecting biological samples for DNA analysis.&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."/&gt; What laws that exist to regulate the collection and use of DNA samples in the United States are not consistent among the states and rarely address the private sector.&lt;ref name="Wilson Center"/&gt; Only some states, like New York, outlaw most DNA testing without written consent.&lt;ref name="Aldous, Peter"/&gt; Others worry about the misuse of the information, fearing discrimination based on existing medical or mental health issues or a predisposition for disease-related illnesses or "unreasonable" searches of DNA evidence by law enforcement.&lt;ref name="Wilson Center"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aldous, P."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."/&gt;&lt;ref name=Passarello/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, K."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Enserink, M."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Enserink|first1=Martin|title=Emerging Forensics Field May Hit Legal and Ethical Obstacles|journal=Science|date=February 18, 2011|volume=331|doi=10.1126/science.331.6019.840|pages=840|pmid=21330505}}&lt;!--|accessdate=August 7, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One scientist and one gallery, according to Dewey-Hagborg, turned down her proposal fearing the project would "cause a fright" among people.&lt;ref name="Dawsey, J"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang, L."/&gt;

Other critics focus on the growing do-it-yourself or [[Do-it-yourself biology|biohacking]] movement. Supporters like Genspace's Ellen Jorgensen claim projects like ''Stranger Visions'' engage the public and make the new technology more accessible.&lt;ref name="Krulwich, R."/&gt; Detractors fear unintended or unexpected consequences from unregulated experiments conducted by D.I.Y. amateur biologists developed in non-traditional laboratory settings.&lt;ref name="Brodwin, E."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aldous, P."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."/&gt;

Still others, including Daniel MacArthur, an assistant professor at [[Harvard Medical School]], [[John D. Hawks]], an anthropologist at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], Michelle N. Meyer, an academic fellow at the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology &amp; Bioethics at Harvard Medical School, and [[Arthur Caplan]], PhD, Director of the Division of Medical Ethics, N.Y.U., report that the technological capability to construct an accurate likeness of a human face based on DNA evidence is not currently available.&lt;ref name="Herper, M."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, K."/&gt;

Although it is possible to identify certain genetic markers linked to facial structures, scientists have yet to isolate all the genes and their variations needed to produce an accurate likeness with a computer simulation.&lt;ref name=Passarello/&gt; Meyer, who analyzed the data from Dewey-Hagborg's website concludes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;So far as I can tell, she's working with sex; ancestral groups that are usually very broad, and in any event only reflects half of the individual's DNA (from which she presumably guesses hair color and texture and bone structure); and a decent guess at eye color. There are hundreds of thousands (at least) of people who would fit these descriptions even if each of her phenotype predictions were accurate, and in many cases, one or more of the predictions are probably going to be wrong.&lt;ref name="Herper, M."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Squires, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name=Passarello/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The environment, the probabilistic nature of interpreting the DNA data collected, and limitations of computer technology all influence the outcome.&lt;ref name="Wilson Center"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt; She likens her work to that of a sketch artist.&lt;ref name="Squires, A."/&gt; At most, her portraits bear only a vague, family resemblance to the people whose genetic information was used as a foundation for the portraits.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, K."/&gt;

===''A Becoming Resemblance''===
In the summer of 2017 Dewey-Hagborg's collaborative exhibition with transgender activist [[Chelsea E. Manning]] opened at Fridman Gallery. The exhibition was an iteration of the artist's successful and controversial ''Stranger Visions'' project.&lt;ref name="Kobler, J."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kobler|first1=Jason|title=Don't Give Your DNA to Giant Genetic Databases|work=Vice|date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of ''A Becoming Resemblance'', Dewey-Hagborg created a series titled ''Radical Love'', 30 3-D printed portraits of Manning, based on cheek swabs and hair clippings that Manning sent her while incarcerated for leaking classified information to WikiLeaks. While all 30 portraits were based on Manning's DNA, their variances in skin color and features presents the malleability of DNA data. The installation demonstrated how much the human genome is up for interpretation once condensed and subjectively interpreted. "&lt;ref name="Nevins, J."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nevins|first1=Jake|title=A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA.|work=The Guardian|date=August 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Becoming Resemblance'' has since traveled to numerous institutions for exhibition, including The Transmedial in Berlin&lt;ref name="Taylor, A."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Alan|title=Photos of the Week: Super Blue Blood Moon, Starry Night, Stratofortress|work=The Atlantic|date=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delaware===
[[File:Invisible-3.tif|thumb|''Invisible'' (2014)]]
In 2013, Dewey-Hagborg was contacted by an assistant medical examiner in Delaware,&lt;ref name="Dawsey, J"/&gt; as a result of her work with ''Stranger Visions''. The project involved developing a portrait of an unidentified woman whose case has remained unsolved for 20 years. She agreed to be an adviser to assist with the case.&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt; Though the resulting portrait based on the unidentified woman's DNA could only be as accurate as existing technology allowed, leaving room for speculation, Dewey-Hagborg viewed working on the case as the only potential use for this type of face-generating technology.&lt;ref name="Squires, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Herper, M."/&gt; "If you can add anything at all to her description, if you can increase the possibility her loved ones may find her even one little bit I think it's worth it."&lt;ref name="Herper, M."/&gt; Critics of Dewey-Hagborg's involvement in the Delaware case express concern for what they call "D.I.Y. forensic science" and question the role of civilians in state investigations.&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."/&gt;

Dewey-Hagborg's work with ''Stranger Visions'' and interest in issues surrounding genetic surveillance lead to the development of two products whose purpose is to eliminate DNA traces. The first, ''Erase'', is a bleaching spray that cleans surfaces (e.g., cups, silverware) of DNA evidence. The second, ''Replace'', is a spray consisting of a blend of genes designed to introduce foreign DNA evidence to the surface, therefore masking any of the original DNA remaining in that area.&lt;ref name="Brodwin, E."/&gt; Dewey-Hagborg views these as a "citizens' defense against the looming DNA surveillance state."&lt;ref name="Hartnett, K."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hartnett|first1=Kevin|title=How to cover your DNA trail|work=Boston Globe|date=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Helen Verran''' is an Australian [[History of science|historian]] and empirical [[Philosophy of science|philosopher of science]], primarily working in the [[Science and Technology Studies|Social Studies of Science and Technology (STS)]],&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20181027123752/http://stsinfrastructures.org/content/helen-verran/essay&lt;/ref&gt; and currently Adjunct Professor at [[Charles Darwin University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cdu.edu.au/the-northern-institute/helen-verran&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Verran is from New South Wales, Australia (born c1945/6?). She trained as a scientist and teacher in the 1960s (BSc, DipEd, [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]] and has a PhD in metabolic biochemistry (UNE, 1972). She then spent eight years lecturing in science education at [[Obafemi Awolowo University]] in Ile-Ife, southwestern Nigeria. In the 1980s she became lecturer and later Associate Professor at the [[University of Melbourne]], working in a unit dedicated to the study of history and philosophy of science. She retired in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person13380&lt;/ref&gt; On retiring she became Adjunct Professor at the Northern Institute, [[Charles Darwin University]] in Darwin, NT, Australia where she still teaches.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwfRyZRnqXc&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://vimeo.com/75547709&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==

===Numbers and Enumerated Entities===
Verran is best known for her book, ''Science and an African Logic'' (University of Chicago Press, 2001), for which she received the [[Ludwik Fleck Prize]] in 2003. It analyses [[counting]], and its relation to the ontology of [[numbers]] based on her lengthy field observations as a mathematics lecturer and teacher in [[Nigeria]]. The book draws on her sudden realisation of the radically different nature of [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] counting and discusses how this realisation grounded her [[post-relativism|post-relativist]] theorising.

===Actor-network theory (ANT)===
She contributed to [[actor-network theory]], working with British sociologist [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]]. Specifically, she is credited for contributing with postcolonial studies to nuancing STS.&lt;ref&gt;Pinboards and books: Juxtaposing, learning and materiality https://web.archive.org/web/20170112220113/http://heterogeneities.net/publications/Law2006PinboardsAndBooks.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Her work is also seen as part of ANT's [[ontological turn]].&lt;ref&gt;New ontologies? Reflections on some recent 'turns' in STS, anthropology and philosophy http://www.academia.edu/download/54964282/New_ontologies_SA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-colonial STS===
Her work on [[Yolngu]] Aboriginal Australians understandings of the world, their use of technology, and their knowledge systems ranges from the 1990s to current engagement.

Starting with work on alternative modes of knowing nature management through [[fire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Verran|first=Helen|year=2002|title=A Postcolonial Moment in Science Studies: Alternative Firing Regimes of Environmental Scientists and Aboriginal Landowners|journal=Social Studies of Science|volume=32|pages=729–762|doi=10.1177/030631270203200506}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Verran's recent work contributed to social studies of [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{cite journal|last=Verran|first=Helen|year=2012|title=The changing lives of measures and values: from centre stage in the fading ‘disciplinary’ society to pervasive background instrument in the emergent ‘control’ society|journal=The Sociological Review|volume=59|pages=60–72|doi=10.1111/j.1467-954X.2012.02059.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the exclamation attributed to Archimedes|Eureka (word)}}
'''Heureka''' is a Finnish [[Science museum#Science_center|science center]] in [[Vantaa]], [[Finland]], north of [[Helsinki]], designed by [[Heikkinen – Komonen Architects]]. The aim of the science centre, which opened its doors to the public in 1989, is to popularize scientific information and to develop the methods used to teach science and scientific concepts. The name ‘Heureka’ (eureka in English) refers to the Greek exclamation, presumably uttered by Archimedes, to mean “I’ve found it!” (made a discovery). The Science Centre Heureka features both indoor and outdoor interactive exhibitions with exhibits that enable visitors to independently test different concepts and ideas. There is also a digital planetarium with 135 seats.

The Heureka Science Centre is a non-profit organization run by the Finnish Science Centre Foundation. The Finnish Science Centre Foundation is a broadly based co-operation organization that includes the Finnish scientific community, education sector, trade and industry, and national and local government. The ten background organisations of the Foundation support, develop and actively participate in the activities of Heureka. The foundation’s highest body is the Board of Trustees, whose decisions are implemented by the Governing Board. Everyday activities are the responsibility of Heureka’s Director assisted by a management team and other staff.

==History==
[[File:Vantaa-heureka.jpg|thumb|320px|The Heureka science center]]
The roots of the Finnish Science Centre Heureka can be traced back to the University of Helsinki and scientists, who had become acquainted with different science centres located around the world. The initial spark was lit by Adjunct Professors Tapio Markkanen, Hannu I. Miettinen and Heikki Oja. It all began with the Physics 82 exhibition held at the [[House of the Estates]] in Helsinki on 20–26 May 1982. During autumn of that same year, the science centre project was launched with the initial support of the Academy of Finland, the Ministry of Education, and various foundations. The project led to the establishment of the Finnish Science Centre Foundation during 1983-1984. The original founding members of the foundation included the University of Helsinki, the Helsinki University of Technology, the Federation of Finnish Learned Societies, and the Confederation of Industries.

In 1984, the City of Vantaa offered to be the host city and partial financier for the Science Centre, and also designated a property lot located in the southern end of Tikkurila as the future site of the centre. An architectural competition, held in 1985, turned out two first prizes from which the winning design was selected; namely the “Heureka” design submitted by Mikko Heikkinen, Markku Komonen and Lauri Anttila. That's how the Finnish Science Centre Heureka got its apt name!
Before the building was completed, a number of test exhibitions were set up at other sites. The interior plan for the Science Centre was completed in 1986. The foundation for the building was laid in October 1987, and the construction work was completed one year later. The overall area of the building is 8,200 m2, of which 2,800 m2 is exhibition space. The Finnish Science Centre Heureka opened its doors to the public on 28 April 1989.

==Exhibitions and planetarium==
[[File:Cubes at Heureka, optical illusion.jpg|thumb|The symbol of Heureka, ''Neljä kuutiota'' ("Four cubes"), is an optical illusion appearing to be a group of cubes]]

===Interior of the building===

The main exhibition hall houses about 200 exhibits related to different fields of science. The main exhibition was renewed completely in 1999, but there are small changes taking place in the main exhibition hall each year as well. The topics include, for example, digestion and the functions of the intestines, the production of money and traffic. The exhibition ‘The Wind in the Bowels’ has been designed in co-operation with the Finnish Medical Society Duodecim.  The exhibition ‘About a Coin’ was implemented through collaboration with the Mint of Finland to mark the company’s 150th anniversary.

As an extension of the main exhibition, the Heureka Classics exhibition was opened in 2009 in honour of Heureka’s 20th anniversary. From the beginning of August 2009, Heureka has also had the Science on a Sphere exhibit on display. 

In addition to the main exhibition, Heureka generally also houses two temporary exhibitions. The topics of past temporary exhibitions have included, for example, dinosaurs, humans, sports, forests, the art of film, flying and ancient cultures. Since Heureka’s opening, the most successful exhibitions have been the dinosaur exhibitions. The 2001 exhibition about the family life of dinosaurs, for example, attracted 406,000 visitors. Many of the exhibitions independently produced by Heureka have made guest appearances in numerous science centres all over the world. Heureka also features exhibitions imported from abroad.

===Outdoor areas===

Heureka’s outdoor exhibition area, Science Park Galilei, opened in 2002. This area of the centre can be visited annually during the summer season. Galilei is a sort of “scientific playground”. The 7,500 m2 area holds dozens of exhibits, many of which feature water as the primary element. The exhibits are based on mathematical, physical and musical phenomena. The outdoor park also contains moving works of art, such as the sand plotter created by well-known Finnish artist Osmo Valtonen. Galilei also features an arboretum with species of conifers from the northern hemisphere.

The area in front of Heureka features a permanent bedrock exhibition, which contains both common and rare types of rocks found in Finland’s bedrock. The rocks are situated to reflect their distribution throughout different geographical provinces of Finland. Leading up to the front entrance, visitors are also greeted by perennial gardens that were planted in accordance with the historical classification system designed by Carolus Linnaeus. The front of the entrance is tiled in [[Penrose tiling]].

===Heureka’s planetarium===

The hemispheric-shaped planetarium primarily presents films dealing with astronomy. Until 2007, the theatre was called the Verne Theatre, and it ran super films and multimedia programmes made with special slide projectors that took advantage of the entire 500 m2 surface of the hemispheric screen. At the end of 2007, the theatre was entirely renovated, and reopened on 26 December 2007 as one of Europe’s most modern digital planetariums. There are altogether 135 seats in Heureka’s planetarium.

===Other daily programmes===

In addition to the exhibitions and planetarium films, Heureka also offers the opportunity to view daily science theatre shows, to participate in supervised programmes and to watch Rat Basketball games. Furthermore, a number of other individual events, such as Science Days, science holidays and science camps in the summer are organised at Heureka. Public lectures with different themes are also regularly held in Heureka’s auditorium. Public lectures are given in the planetarium as well. Other services at Heureka include a science shop and a restaurant, as well as conference facilities and a 220-seat auditorium for meetings.

==Facts about Heureka==

===Visitors===

From 1989 to 2011, an average of about 280,000 people has visited Heureka each year. The total number of visitors exceeded six million in May 2010. Altogether more than 22 million people have viewed Heureka’s exhibitions on display both in Finland and abroad.
Of the average 280,000 people who visit Heureka each year, more than half represent families, one fourth school students, about 10% are corporate visits, and the rest are individual visitors. About 6-10% of the visitors arrive from abroad, with the highest percentage coming from Russia and Estonia. The number of visitors is affected by, for example, the general economic situation, the weather and the excursion funds available to school groups.

===The Finnish Science Centre Foundation and funding===

Heureka is run by the Finnish Science Centre Foundation, whose original members include the University of Helsinki, the Helsinki University of Technology (nowadays Aalto University), the Federation of Finnish Learned Societies, and the Confederation of Industries (nowadays Confederation of Finnish Industries, EK), the City of Vantaa, the Ministry of Education (nowadays Ministry of Education and Culture), the Ministry of Trade and Industry (nowadays Ministry of Employment and the Economy), the Ministry of Finance, the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK), and the Trade Union of Education in Finland (OAJ).

Heureka’s funding is provided through subsidies from the City of Vantaa and the Ministry of Education and Culture, as well as through its own operational revenue: admission and rental fees, fundraising and exhibition export. Heureka’s overall funding is approximately nine million euro, of which the revenue from own operations was 48% in 2011. The share of the funding provided by the City of Vantaa and the Ministry of Education and Culture was altogether 52% in 2011. The public support is notably less than for many other cultural institutions. Part of the funding also comes through corporate co-operation. The temporary exhibitions are often sponsored by main partners and other partners. Heureka also has two companies owned entirely by the Foundation, namely the Science Shop Magneetti Oy, which runs the Heureka Shop at Heureka and at the Kamppi Shopping Centre in central Helsinki, and Heureka Overseas Productions Oy Ltd, which manages the export activities of Heureka.

===Other===

At the end of 2014, the Foundation had a staff of 68 full-time salaried employees and 32 part-time or fixed-term employees. The total number of person-years was 77. Additionally 7 206 hours were carried out by volunteers. There have been volunteers in Heureka since 1998, and there are currently about 60-70 volunteers in the service of Heureka.

The center is a member of three associations of science centers:
*ASTC ([[Association of Science-Technology Centers]])
*ECSITE ([[The European Collaborative for Science, Industry and Technology]])
*NSCF ([[Nordic Science Centre Association|Nordisk Science Centerförbundet]])

The '''''Index Kewensis''''' ('''IK'''), maintained by the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], is a publication that aims to register all [[botanical names]] for [[seed plant]]s at the rank of [[species]] and [[genus|genera]]. It later came to include names of taxonomic [[family (biology)|families]] and ranks below that of species.

The ''Index'' is currently maintained as part of the [[International Plant Names Index]] in combination with the [[Gray Herbarium]] and [[Australian Plant Name Index|Australian Plant Name]] indexes. This database is anticipated to complete the task of creating a complete list of plant names, although it does not determine which are accepted species names.&lt;ref name="Lughadha"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Lughadha  |first=Eimear Nic |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=April 29, 2004 |title=Towards a working list of all known plant species |journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci |volume=359 |issue=1444 |pages=681–687 | pmid =15253353 |pmc=1693359 |quote= |doi=10.1098/rstb.2003.1446 |last2= Okada |first2= M |last3= Hirata |first3= Y |last4= Saito |first4= T |last5= Arisato |first5= N |last6= Ishigaki |first6= S |last7= Niitsu |first7= Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The preparation for this venture was made by [[Benjamin Daydon Jackson]] of the [[Linnaean Society]], directed by [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] at Kew. [[Charles Darwin]] provided the funding for the indexing project.  When he died in 1882 his will stipulated that provision be made for [[£]]250 per annum over a 5-year period. 
In providing citations of plant names, the starting point was taken from 1753 onward; the year of publication for the ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' of [[Linnaeus]]. 
Darwin had found difficulties in applying these to the plants he studied, and Hooker's directive was to ‘the compilation of an Index to the Names and Authorities of all known flowering plants and their countries’.&lt;ref&gt;Hooker, 1893 Preface. In ''Index Kewensis'': an enumeration of the genera and species of flowering plants from the time of Linnaeus to the year 1885 inclusive (ed. B. D. Jackson). Oxford: Clarendon.&lt;/ref&gt; 
While the ''Index'' has never fulfilled this original charter, it was the most comprehensive for over 100 years.

Previous attempts at a comprehensive index had relied on secondary sources, this was the first attempt to provide the original publication details of the names. 
A note on the country of origin was also included. 
The publications of [[A. P. de Candolle|De Candolle]], [[Ludwig Karl Georg Pfeiffer|Pfeiffer]], and [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]] provided models for the acceptance of names. 
However, the editor admitted that not all earlier sources were included; this sometimes led to subsequent errors in [[botanical nomenclature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://www.anbg.gov.au/cpbr/databases/apni-introduction.html  | title = Australian Flora and Fauna Series - Number 12. Australian Plant Name Index  | accessdate =   | author = Arthur D. Chapman  | authorlink =   | date = 14 December 2006  | work = Australian Biological Resources Study, Canberra  | publisher = [[Australian National Botanic Gardens]]  | quote = Introduction to the original 1991 printed version  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope of the project was also changed in early editions, the editor noting that to include a full synonymy was too ambitious. The work originally indicated acceptance of a name, acting as a [[wiktionary:nomenclator|nomenclator]] rather than an index, but by 1913 it avoided making taxonomic judgement in its citations. 
The integrity of the document was liable to criticism as only representing the 'Kew view' on nomenclatural validity, the objective task of indexing gave the work itself greater international acceptance.&lt;ref name="Lughadha"/&gt;

A description of Hooker's systematic works by [[Frederick Orpen Bower|F O Bower]] notes the "scheme originated in the difficulty he had found in the accurate naming of plants", and anticipates the importance of this work,&lt;ref name="mbb"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bower|first=Frederick Orpen |title=Makers of British Botany|editor=Francis Wall Oliver|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=London|year=1913|pages=314–315|chapter=Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker 1817—1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Surely no greater technical benefit was ever conferred upon a future generation by the veterans of science than this Index. It smooths the way for every systematist who comes after. It stands as a monument to an intimate friendship. It bears witness to the munificence of Darwin, and the ungrudging personal care of Hooker."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Editions==
A [[hard copy]] was reprinted in 1996, providing access to the original publication details of plant names; these were also made available in [[microfiche]] format as the Cumulated Index Kewensis. The publication titled '''Kew Index''' was issued from 1986 until 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://www.kew.org/data/reference.html  | title = Reference Works, Bibliographies, etc  | accessdate =  2018-04-02 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090507200520/https://www.kew.org/data/reference.html|archive-date= 2009-05-07|author =   | authorlink =   | work = Data and Publications  | publisher = [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]]  | quote = Cumulated Index Kewensis: Original 2 volumes plus supplements 1-16: Microfiche version of cut-up set in Kew Library.  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first index contained the scientific names of 400,000 species, regular supplements were then issued on newly published names. The supplements were issued every five years, each one adding around 6000 names to the index, eventually forming a compilation of over 1,000,000 entries.  
The sixteenth supplement began to include bibliographic details at the rank of family and below, the later annual supplements included [[fern]]s and their allies. A digitalized version of the index was issued on a [[Compact Disc]]. A digital version was incorporporated with other indexes as the ''[[International Plant Names Index]]'' (IPNI), and may fulfill the original intention - a complete index of plant names.&lt;ref name="Lughadha"/&gt; Entries at IPNI are designated with the abbreviation "(IK)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://www.ipni.org/ik_blurb.html  | title = About the Index Kewensis  | accessdate =  | author =   | authorlink =   | year = 2004  | work =   | publisher = [[International Plant Names Index]]  | quote =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Whenever a gas is forced through a tube, the gaseous molecules are deflected by the tube’s walls. If the speed of the gas is much less than the [[speed of sound]], the gas density will remain constant and the velocity of the flow will increase. However, as the speed of the flow approximates the speed of sound, [[compressibility]] effects on the gas are to be considered. The [[density]] of the gas becomes position dependent. While considering flow through a tube, if the flow is very gradually compressed (i.e. area decreases) and then gradually expanded (i.e. area increases), the flow conditions are restored (i.e. return to its initial position). So, such a process is a reversible process. According to the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]], whenever there is a reversible and adiabatic flow, constant value of entropy is maintained. Engineers classify this type of flow as an ''[[isentropic]]'' flow of fluids. Isentropic is the combination of the Greek word "iso" (which means - same) and entropy.
 
When the change in flow variables is small and gradual, isentropic flows occur. The generation of [[sound waves]] is an isentropic process. A [[supersonic]] flow that is turned while there is an increase in flow area is also isentropic. Since there is an increase in area, therefore we call this an ''isentropic expansion''. If a supersonic flow is turned abruptly and the flow area decreases, the flow is irreversible due to the generation of [[shock waves]]. The isentropic relations are no longer valid and the flow is governed by the [[oblique shock|oblique or normal shock]] relations.

==Stagnation properties==
[[File:Enthalpy–entropy diagram illustrating the definition of stagnation state.jpg|thumb|Enthalpy-Entropy diagram of stagnation state|391x391px]]
In fluid dynamics, a [[stagnation point]] is a point in a flow field where the local velocity of the fluid is zero. The isentropic stagnation state is the state a flowing fluid would attain if it underwent a reversible [[adiabatic]] deceleration to zero velocity. There are both ''actual'' and the ''isentropic'' stagnation states for a typical gas or vapor. Sometimes it is advantageous to make a distinction between the actual and the isentropic stagnation states. The actual stagnation state is the state achieved after an actual deceleration to zero velocity (as at the nose of a body placed in a fluid stream), and there may be irreversibility associated with the deceleration process. Therefore, the term "stagnation property" is sometimes reserved for the properties associated with the actual state, and the term total property is used for the isentropic stagnation state. The [[enthalpy]] is the same for both the actual and isentropic stagnation states (assuming that the actual process is adiabatic). Therefore, for an [[ideal gas]], the actual [[stagnation temperature]] is the same as the isentropic stagnation temperature. However, the actual stagnation pressure may be less than the isentropic stagnation pressure. For this reason the term "total pressure" (meaning isentropic stagnation pressure) has particular meaning compared to the actual stagnation pressure.

==Flow analysis==
The isentropic efficiency is h1-h2a/h1-h2.
The variation of fluid density for [[compressible flow]]s requires attention to density and other fluid property relationships. The fluid [[equation of state]], often unimportant for incompressible flows, is vital in the analysis of compressible flows. Also, temperature variations for compressible flows are usually significant and thus the energy equation is important. Curious phenomena can occur with compressible flows.
* For simplicity, the gas is assumed to be an ideal gas.
* The gas flow is isentropic.
* The gas flow is constant.
* The gas flow is along a straight line from gas inlet to exhaust gas exit.
* The gas flow behavior is compressible.

There are numerous applications where a steady, uniform, isentropic flow is a good approximation to the flow in conduits. These include the flow through a [[jet engine]], through the nozzle of a rocket, from a broken gas line, and past the blades of a turbine.

 Mach number = M                                    Velocity = V
 Universal gas constant = R                         Pressure = p

Energy equation for the steady flow:
 &lt;math&gt;q_{net} + h + \frac{\vec{V}^2}{2} = w_{net} + h_o + \frac{\vec{V_o}^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

To model such situations, consider the control volume in the changing area of the conduit of Fig. The continuity equation between two sections an infinitesimal distance dx apart is
 &lt;math&gt; \rho AV = (\rho + d\rho)(A+dA)(V +dV)&lt;/math&gt;
If only the first-order terms in a differential quantity are retained, continuity takes the form                       
 &lt;math&gt;\frac{dV}{V} + \frac{dA}{A} + \frac{d\rho}{\rho} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
The energy equation is:
 &lt;math&gt;\frac{V^2}{2} + \frac{k}{k-1}.\frac{p}{\rho} = \frac{(V+dV)^2}{2} + \frac{k}{k-1}.\frac{p+dp}{\rho + d\rho}&lt;/math&gt;
 
[[File:Steady, uniform, isentropic flow through a conduit.jpg|thumb|Steady, uniform, isentropic flow through a conduit|372x372px]]

This simplifies to, neglecting higher-order terms,:
                            &lt;math&gt; VdV + \frac{k}{k-1}.\frac{\rho dp - pd\rho}{\rho^2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
Assuming an isentropic flow, the energy equation becomes:
                            &lt;math&gt; VdV + \frac{k.p}{\rho^2}.d\rho = 0&lt;/math&gt;
Substitute from the continuity equation to obtain
                                  &lt;math&gt; \frac{dV}{V}.(\frac{\rho V^2}{k p} - 1) = \frac{dA}{A}&lt;/math&gt;
or, in terms of the [[Mach number]]:
                                         &lt;math&gt;\frac{dV}{V}.(M^2-1) = \frac{dA}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

This equation applies to a steady, uniform, isentropic flow.
There are several observations that can be made from an analysis of Eq. (9.26).
They are:
* For a subsonic flow in an expanding conduit (M &lt;1 and dA&gt;0), the flow is decelerating (dV &lt;0).
* For a subsonic flow in a converging conduit (M &lt;1 and dA &lt;0), the flow is accelerating (dV &gt;0).
* For a supersonic flow in an expanding conduit (M &gt;1 and dA &gt;0), the flow is accelerating (dV &gt;0).
* For a supersonic flow in a converging conduit (M &gt;1 and dA &lt;0), the flow is decelerating (dV &lt;0).
* At a throat where dA =0, either M =1 or dV =0 (the flow could be accelerating through M =1, or it may reach a velocity such that dV =0).

=== Supersonic flow ===
[[File:Fig, A supersonic nozzle.jpeg|thumb|Fig: A supersonic nozzle|384x384px]]
A nozzle for a supersonic flow must increase in area in the flow direction, and a diffuser must decrease in area, opposite to a nozzle and diffuser for a subsonic flow. So, for a supersonic flow to develop from a reservoir where the velocity is zero, the subsonic flow must first accelerate through a converging area to a throat, followed by continued acceleration through an enlarging area.

The nozzles on a rocket designed to place satellites in orbit are constructed using such converging-diverging geometry. The energy and continuity equations can take on particularly helpful forms for the steady, uniform, isentropic flow through the nozzle. Apply the energy equation with Q_ W_S 0 between the reservoir and some location in the nozzle to obtain
                                                &lt;math&gt; c_p.T_o = \frac{V^2}{2} + c_p.T&lt;/math&gt;

Any quantity with a zero subscript refers to a stagnation point where the velocity is zero, such as in the reservoir. Using several thermodynamic relations equations can be put in the forms:

 &lt;math&gt;\frac{T_o}{T} = 1 + \frac{k-1}{2}M^2&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\frac{p_0}{p} = \left(1+\frac{k-1}{2}M^2 \right)^\left(\frac{k}{k-1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\frac{\rho_o}{\rho} = \left(1+\frac{k-1}{2}M^2 \right)^\left(\frac{1}{k-1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

If the above equations are applied at the throat (the critical area signified by an
Asterisk (*) superscript, where M =1), the energy equation takes the forms

 &lt;math&gt;      \frac{T^*}{T_o} = \frac{2}{k+1} &lt;/math&gt; 
 &lt;math&gt;      \frac{p^*}{p_o} = \left(\frac{2}{k+1}\right)^\left(\frac{k}{k-1}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;      \frac{\rho^*}{\rho_o} = \left(\frac{2}{k+1}\right)^\left(\frac{1}{k-1}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

The critical area is often referenced even though a throat does not exist. For air with k =1.4, the equations above provide
    T* = 0.833333·T&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;
    p* = 0.528282·p&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;
    ρ* = 0.633938·ρ&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;

The mass flux through the nozzle is of interest and is given by:

      &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}= \rho AV = \frac{p}{RT}\times A\times M \sqrt{kRT} = p \sqrt{k \over RT} AM&lt;/math&gt;

With the use of Eq. (9.28), the mass flux, after applying some algebra, can be
Expressed as
                             
                  &lt;math&gt;   \dot{m}=p_o MA \sqrt{\frac{k}{RT_o}} \left(1+\frac{k-1}{2}M^2\right)^\frac{k+1}{-2(k-1)}&lt;/math&gt;
                                         
If the critical area is selected where M =1, this takes the form

                        &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}= p_o A^* \sqrt{\frac{k}{RT_o}} \left(1+\frac{k-1}{2}\right)^{\frac{k+1}{-2(k-1)}}&lt;/math&gt; 
which, when combined with previous it provides:
          
	&lt;math&gt;\frac{A}{A^*} = \frac{1}{M} \left(\frac{2+(k-1).M^2}{k+1}\right)^{\frac{k+1}{2(k-1)}}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Converging nozzle ====
[[File:A Converging Nozzle.jpg|thumb|Fig: A Converging Nozzle]]

Consider a converging nozzle connecting a reservoir with a receiver. If the reservoir pressure is held constant and the receiver pressure reduced, the Mach number at the exit of the nozzle will increase until Me=1 is reached, indicated by the left curve in figure 2. After Me =1 is reached at the nozzle exit for &lt;math&gt;p_r =0.5283p_0&lt;/math&gt;, the condition of choked flow occurs and the velocity throughout the nozzle cannot change with further decreases in&lt;math&gt; p_r&lt;/math&gt;. This is due to the fact that pressure changes downstream of the exit cannot travel upstream to cause changes in the flow conditions.
The right curve of Fig2. represents the case when the reservoir pressure is increased and the receiver pressure is held constant. When &lt;math&gt;M_e=1&lt;/math&gt;, the condition of choked flow also occurs; but Eq indicates that the mass flux will continue to increase as &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt; is increased. This is the case when a gas line ruptures.

[[File:The pressure variation in the nozzle.jpg|thumb|Fig2: The pressure variation in the nozzle.]]

It is interesting that the exit pressure &lt;math&gt;p_e&lt;/math&gt; is able to be greater than the receiver pressure &lt;math&gt;p_r&lt;/math&gt;. Nature allows this by providing the streamlines of a gas the ability to make a sudden change of direction at the exit and expand to a much greater area resulting in a reduction of the pressure from &lt;math&gt;p_e&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;p_r&lt;/math&gt;. The case of a converging-diverging nozzle allows a supersonic flow to occur, providing the receiver pressure is sufficiently low. This is shown in Fig. 9.6 assuming a constant reservoir pressure with a decreasing receiver pressure. If the receiver pressure is equal to the reservoir pressure, no flow occurs, represented by curve &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. If pr is slightly less than p_0, the flow is subsonic throughout, with a minimum pressure at the throat, represented by curve B. As the pressure is reduced still further, a pressure is reached that result in M =1 at the throat with subsonic flow throughout the remainder of the nozzle.
There is another receiver pressure substantially below that of curve C that also results in isentropic flow throughout the nozzle, represented by curve D; after the throat the flow is supersonic. Pressures in the receiver in between those of curve C and curve D result in non-isentropic flow (a shock wave occurs in the flow) and will be considered in the next section. If pr is below that of curve D, the exit pressure pe is greater than pr. Once again, for receiver pressures below that of curve C, the mass flux remains constant since the conditions at the throat remain unchanged. It may appear that the supersonic flow will tend to separate from the nozzle, but just the opposite is true. A supersonic flow can turn very sharp angles, since nature provides expansion fans that do not exist in subsonic flows. To avoid separation in subsonic nozzles, the expansion angle should not exceed 10°. For larger angles, vanes are used so that the angle between the vanes does not exceed 10°.

Biases have a variety of forms and appear as cognitive ("cold") bias, such as mental noise,&lt;ref name="HilbertPsychBull" /&gt; or motivational ("hot") bias, such as when beliefs are distorted by [[wishful thinking]]. Both effects can be present at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.259 |last=Maccoun |first=Robert J. |year=1998|title=Biases in the interpretation and use of research results |journal=Annual Review of Psychology|pmid=15012470 |volume=49 |pages=259–87 |url=http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~maccoun/MacCoun_AnnualReview98.pdf |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nickerson |first=Raymond S. |authorlink=Raymond S.

There are also controversies over some of these biases as to whether they count as useless or [[irrationality|irrational]], or whether they result in useful attitudes or behavior. For example, when getting to know others, people tend to ask [[leading question]]s which seem biased towards confirming their assumptions about the person. However, this kind of [[confirmation bias]] has also been argued to be an example of [[social skills|social skill]]: a way to establish a connection with the other person.&lt;ref name="dardenne"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dardenne |first=Benoit |first2=Jacques-Philippe |last2=Leyens|title=Confirmation Bias as a Social Skill |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=1995 |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=1229–1239 |doi=10.1177/01461672952111011|issn=1552-7433|url=http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/handle/2268/28639 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this research overwhelmingly involves human subjects, some findings that demonstrate bias have been found in non-human animals as well. For example, [[hyperbolic discounting]] has been observed in rats, pigeons, and monkeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alexander|first=William H.|author2=Brown, Joshua W. |title=Hyperbolically Discounted Temporal Difference Learning|journal=Neural Computation|date=1 June 2010|volume=22|issue=6|pages=1511–1527|doi=10.1162/neco.2010.08-09-1080|pmc=3005720|pmid=20100071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision-making, belief, and behavioral biases==
Many of these biases affect belief formation, business and economic decisions, and human behavior in general.

==Memory errors and biases==
{{main|List of memory biases}}
In [[psychology]] ''and'' [[cognitive science]], a memory bias is a [[cognitive bias]] that either enhances or impairs the recall of a [[memory]] (either the chances that the memory will be recalled at all, or the amount of time it takes for it to be recalled, or both), or that alters the content of a reported memory. There are many types of memory bias, including:

| The tendency for people of one race to have difficulty identifying members of a race other than their own.
|-
| [[Cryptomnesia]]

| [[Leveling and sharpening]]
| Memory distortions introduced by the loss of details in a recollection over time, often concurrent with sharpening or selective recollection of certain details that take on exaggerated significance in relation to the details or aspects of the experience lost through leveling.

For example, consider a list of 30 items ("L30") and a list of 100 items ("L100"). An individual may remember 15 items from L30, or 50%, whereas the individual may remember 40 items from L100, or 40%. Although the percent of L30 items remembered (50%) is greater than the percent of L100 (40%), more L100 items (40) are remembered than L30 items (15).&lt;ref name=memcog&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kinnell |first1=Angela |last2=Dennis |first2=S. |date=2011 |title=The list length effect in recognition memory: an analysis of potential confounds |journal=Memory &amp; Cognition |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=348–63 |doi=10.3758/s13421-010-0007-6|pmid=21264573 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Further explanation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Common theoretical causes of some cognitive biases==
* [[Bounded rationality]] – limits on optimization and rationality
** [[Prospect theory]]
** [[Mental accounting]]
** [[Adaptive bias]] – basing decisions on limited information and biasing them based on the costs of being wrong
* [[Attribute substitution]] – making a complex, difficult judgment by unconsciously substituting it by an easier judgment&lt;ref name="revisited"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |author2=Shane Frederick |title=Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment |editor=Thomas Gilovich |editor2=Dale Griffin |editor3=Daniel Kahneman |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |pages=49–81 |chapter=Representativeness Revisited: Attribute Substitution in Intuitive Judgment |isbn=978-0-521-79679-8 |oclc=47364085}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Attribution theory]]
** [[Salience (neuroscience)|Salience]]
** [[Naïve realism (psychology)|Naïve realism]]
* [[Cognitive dissonance]], and related:
** [[Impression management]]
** [[Self-perception theory]]
* [[Heuristics in judgment and decision making]], including:
** [[Availability heuristic]] – estimating what is more likely by what is more available in memory, which is biased toward vivid, unusual, or emotionally charged examples&lt;ref name="h_and_b" /&gt;
** [[Representativeness heuristic]] – judging probabilities on the basis of resemblance&lt;ref name="h_and_b"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tversky |first=Amos |author2=Daniel Kahneman |date=September 27, 1974 |title=Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases |journal=Science |volume=185 |issue=4157 |pages=1124–1131 |pmid=17835457 |doi=10.1126/science.185.4157.1124 |bibcode=1974Sci...185.1124T }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Affect heuristic]] – basing a decision on an emotional reaction rather than a calculation of risks and benefits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Slovic |first=Paul |author2=Melissa Finucane |author3=Ellen Peters |author4=Donald G. MacGregor |chapter=The Affect Heuristic |pages=397–420 |editor=Thomas Gilovich |editor2=Dale Griffin |editor3=Daniel Kahneman |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |title=Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment |isbn=978-0-521-79679-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some theories of [[emotion]] such as:
** [[Two-factor theory of emotion]]
** [[Somatic markers hypothesis]]
* [[Introspection illusion]]
* Misinterpretations or [[misuse of statistics]]; [[innumeracy]].

A 2012 ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]'' article suggested that at least eight seemingly unrelated biases can be produced by the same [[information-theoretic]] generative mechanism that assumes noisy information processing during storage and retrieval of information in human memory.&lt;ref name="HilbertPsychBull"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Martin Hilbert|year=2012|url=http://www.martinhilbert.net/HilbertPsychBull.pdf|layurl=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2011-27261-001|title=Toward a synthesis of cognitive biases: How noisy information processing can bias human decision making|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=138|issue=2|pages= 211–237|doi=10.1037/a0025940|pmid=22122235|citeseerx=10.1.1.432.8763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual differences in decision making biases==
People do appear to have stable individual differences in their susceptibility to decision biases such as [[Overconfidence effect|overconfidence]], [[temporal discounting]], and [[bias blind spot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bias Blind Spot: Structure, Measurement, and Consequences|journal = Management Science|date = 2015-04-24|doi = 10.1287/mnsc.2014.2096|first = Irene|last = Scopelliti|first2 = Carey K.|last2 = Morewedge|first3 = Erin|last3 = McCormick|first4 = H. Lauren|last4 = Min|first5 = Sophie|last5 = Lebrecht|first6 = Karim S.|last6 = Kassam|volume=61|issue = 10|pages=2468–2486}}&lt;/ref&gt; That said, these stable levels of bias within individuals are possible to change. Participants in experiments who watched training videos and played debiasing games showed medium to large reductions both immediately and up to three months later in the extent to which they exhibited susceptibility to six cognitive biases: [[anchoring]], bias blind spot, [[confirmation bias]], [[fundamental attribution error]], [[projection bias]], and [[Representativeness heuristic|representativeness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Debiasing Decisions Improved Decision Making With a Single Training Intervention|url = http://bbs.sagepub.com/content/2/1/129|journal = Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date = 2015-10-01|issn = 2372-7322|pages = 129–140|volume = 2|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/2372732215600886|first = Carey K.|last = Morewedge|first2 = Haewon|last2 = Yoon|first3 = Irene|last3 = Scopelliti|first4 = Carl W.|last4 = Symborski|first5 = James H.|last5 = Korris|first6 = Karim S.|last6 = Kassam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debiasing==
[[Debiasing]] is the reduction of biases in judgment and decision making through incentives, nudges, and training. [[Cognitive bias mitigation]] and [[cognitive bias modification]] are forms of debiasing specifically applicable to cognitive biases and their effects. [[Reference class forecasting]] is a method for systematically debiasing estimates and decisions, based on what [[Daniel Kahneman]] has dubbed the [[outside view]].

{{dynamic list}}
This is a '''list of file formats''' used by [[computer]]s, organized by type. [[Filename extension]]s are usually noted in parentheses if they differ from the [[file format]] name or abbreviation. Many [[operating system]]s do not limit filenames to one extension shorter than 4 characters, as was common with some operating systems that supported the [[File Allocation Table]] (FAT) file system.  Examples of operating systems that do not impose this limit include [[Unix-like]] systems, and [[Microsoft Windows]] [[Windows NT|NT]], [[Windows 95|95]], [[Windows 98|98]], and [[Windows Me|Me]] which have no three character limit on extensions for [[32-bit]] or [[64-bit]] applications on [[file system]]s other than pre-Windows 95 and Windows NT 3.5 versions of the FAT file system.  Some filenames are given extensions longer than three characters.

Some file formats may be listed twice or more. An example is the .txt .

== Video game storage media ==
List of the most common filename extensions used when a game's [[ROM image]] or storage medium is copied from an original [[read-only memory]] (ROM) device to an external memory such as [[hard disk]] for [[back up]] purposes or for making the game playable with an [[emulator]]. In the case of cartridge-based software, if the platform specific extension is not used then filename extensions ".rom" or ".bin" are usually used to clarify that the file contains a copy of a content of a ROM. ROM, disk or tape images usually do not consist of one file or ROM, rather an entire file or ROM structure contained within one file on the backup medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emutalk.net/archive/index.php/t-21512.html|title=.GCM file extension!

The giant sequoia (''[[Sequoiadendron giganteum]]'') is the world's most massive tree,&lt;ref name=Martin2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=GSNM2010/&gt; and arguably the [[Largest organisms|largest living organism]] on Earth.&lt;ref name=NPS2010/&gt; It is neither the tallest [[Extant taxon|extant]] species of tree (that distinction belongs to the [[Sequoia sempervirens|coast redwood]]),&lt;ref name=Martin2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ssempervirens2011/&gt; nor is it the widest (that distinction belongs to the [[Adansonia digitata|baobab tree]] or [[Taxodium mucronatum|Montezuma Cypresses]]), nor is it the [[List of oldest trees|longest-lived]] (that distinction belongs to the [[Pinus longaeva|Great Basin bristlecone pine]]).&lt;ref name=Plongaeva2011/&gt; However, with a height of {{Convert|286|ft|m|0}} or more, a circumference of {{Convert|113|ft|m|0}} or more, an estimated [[Trunk (botany)|bole]] volume of up to {{Convert|52500|ft3|m3|0}}, and an estimated life span of 1800–2700 years,&lt;ref name=NPS2009/&gt; the giant sequoia is among the tallest, widest and [[List of long-living organisms|longest-lived of all organisms]] on Earth.

Giant sequoias grow in well-defined [[Grove (nature)|groves]] in [[California mixed evergreen forest]]s, along with other [[old-growth forest|old-growth]] species such as California incense-cedar (''[[Calocedrus decurrens]]''). Because most of the neighboring trees are also quite large, it can be difficult to appreciate the size of an individual giant sequoia. The largest giant sequoias are as tall as a 26-story building, and the width of their bases can exceed that of a city street. They grow at such a rate as to produce roughly {{Convert|40|ft3|m3}} of wood each year, approximately equal to the volume of a 50-foot-tall tree one foot in diameter.&lt;ref name=NPS2009/&gt; This makes them among the fastest growing organisms on Earth, in terms of annual increase in mass.

==Distribution==
[[File:General Grant Tree in Kings Canyon National Park.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[General Grant (tree)|General Grant tree]], [[General Grant Grove]], [[Kings Canyon National Park]], 2007]]

Giant sequoias occur naturally in only one place on Earth—the western slope of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountain range in [[California]], on moist, [[Glacier|unglaciated]] ridges and valleys&lt;ref name=Zinke1994/&gt; at an altitude of {{Convert|5000|to|8000|ft|m|0}} [[above mean sea level]]. There are 65–75 groves of giant sequoias in the Sierra Nevada, depending upon the criteria used to define a grove.&lt;ref name=GSNM2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Willard1994/&gt; The northernmost of these groves is [[Tahoe National Forest#Groves|Placer County Grove]] in the [[Tahoe National Forest]], [[Placer County, California]],&lt;ref name=Schaffer1998/&gt; while the southernmost grove is [[Deer Creek Grove]] in the [[Giant Sequoia National Monument]], [[Tulare County, California]].&lt;ref name=Willard1994/&gt; The combined total area of [[List of giant sequoia groves|all groves of giant sequoias]] is approximately {{Convert|35600|acre|ha|0}}.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Fire limits growth==
{{anchor|Damaging agents}}

Giant sequoias are in many ways adapted to forest fires. Their bark is unusually fire resistant, and their cones will normally open immediately after a fire.&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Magazine, December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, fire is also the most serious damaging agent of giant sequoias. Seedlings and saplings are highly susceptible to death or serious injury by fire. Larger giant sequoias are more resistant to fire damage, due to their thick protective layer of nonresinous [[Bark (botany)|bark]] and elevated crowns. However, repeated fires over many centuries may penetrate the bark and destroy the [[vascular cambium]]. Nearly all of the larger trees have fire scars, many of which cover a large area of the base of the tree. Older trees are rarely killed by fire alone, but the resulting structural damage may predispose a tree to collapse and fire scars also provide entry for [[fungus|fungi]] which may cause [[Laminated root rot|root disease]] and [[heart rot]]. The resulting decayed wood is then more easily consumed by subsequent fires. The result of this cycle is further structural weakening of the tree, which may eventually lead to its collapse.&lt;ref name=Weatherspoon1990/&gt;

Fire scars are thought to be the main cause of dead tops. Although [[lightning strike]]s rarely kill mature trees, lightning sometimes knocks out large portions of crowns or ignites dead tops. The most common cause of death in mature giant sequoias is toppling, due to weakening of the roots and lower trunk by fire and decay. The extreme weight of the trees coupled with their shallow root systems contributes to this weakening. Other causative factors include wind, water-softened soils, undercutting by streams, and heavy [[Crown snow-load|snow loads]] in the crowns&lt;ref name=Weatherspoon1990/&gt;
[[File:Washington Tree 2007.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Washington (tree)|Washington tree]], Giant Forest Grove, Sequoia National Park, 2007]]

The [[Washington (tree)|Washington tree]], located in the [[Giant Forest|Giant Forest Grove]] in [[Sequoia National Park]] provides a good example of the aforementioned phenomenon. This tree was the second largest tree in the world (only the [[General Sherman (tree)|General Sherman tree]] was larger) until just a few years ago.&lt;ref name=Martin2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sillett2001/&gt; In September 2003, the tree lost a portion of its crown as a result of a fire caused by a lightning strike. This reduced its height from nearly {{convert|255|ft|m}} to about {{convert|229|ft|m}}. The structurally weakened tree partially collapsed in January 2005, as the result of a heavy snow load in the remaining portion of its crown; it is now approximately {{convert|115|ft|m}} tall.&lt;ref name=Martin2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Block2005/&gt;

==Tree measurement==
As with other trees, measurement of giant sequoias is conducted using established [[dendrometry|dendrometric]] techniques. The most frequent measurements acquired in the field include the height of the tree, the horizontal dimension of its canopy, and its [[diameter at breast height]] (DBH). These measurements are then subjected to [[tree allometry]], which employs certain mathematical and [[Statistics|statistical]] principles to estimate the amount of [[Lumber|timber]] volume in a tree.

Calculating the volume of a standing tree is the practical equivalent of calculating the [[Volume#Cone|volume of an irregular cone]],&lt;ref name=NPS1997/&gt; and is subject to error for various reasons. This is partly due to technical difficulties in measurement, and variations in the shape of trees and their trunks. Measurements of trunk [[circumference]] are taken at only a few predetermined heights up the trunk, and assume that the trunk is circular in [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section]], and that taper between measurement points is even. Also, only the volume of the trunk (including the restored volume of basal fire scars) is taken into account, and not the volume of wood in the branches or roots.&lt;ref name=NPS1997/&gt; The volume measurements also do not take cavities into account. For example, while studying sequoia tree canopies in 1999, researchers discovered that the Washington tree in Giant Forest Grove was largely hollow.&lt;ref name=Block2005/&gt;

==List of largest giant sequoias by trunk volume==
The following table is a list of the largest giant sequoias, all of which are located in California. The table is sorted by [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] volume, ignoring wood in the branches of the tree. Many sequoias cut down in the past were probably far larger, such as the [[Mother of the Forest]].

* The trees named "Franklin", "Column", "Monroe", "Hamilton" and "Adams" were named by Wendell Flint and others. These five are now included on the official map of Giant Forest, where they are all situated.
* The [[Washington Tree]] was previously arguably the second largest tree with a volume of {{convert|47850|cuft|m3}} (although the upper half of its trunk was hollow, making the calculated volume debatable), but after losing the hollow upper half of its trunk in January 2005 following a fire, it is no longer of great size.
* The [[Hazelwood Tree]] (not listed above) had a volume of {{convert|36228|cuft|m3}} before losing half its trunk in a lightning storm in 2002, if it were still at full size it would currently be the 17th largest giant sequoia on earth.

The English word "palace" is used to translated the Chinese word 宮 (pronounced "gōng" in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]). This character represents two rooms connected (呂), under a roof (宀). Originally the character applied to any residence or mansion, but starting with the [[Qin Dynasty]] (3rd century BC) it was used only for the residence of the emperor and members of the imperial family. Chinese palaces are different from post-Renaissance European palaces in the sense that they are not made up of one building only (however big and convoluted the building may be), but are in fact huge spaces surrounded by a wall and containing large separated halls (殿 diàn) for ceremonies and official business, as well as smaller buildings, galleries, courtyards, gardens, and outbuildings, more like the Roman or Carolingian ''palatium.''

=== List of Chinese imperial palaces, in chronological order ===
* [[Xianyang Palace]] (咸陽宮), in (Qin) Xianyang (咸陽), now 15&amp;nbsp;km/9 miles east of modern [[Xianyang]], [[Shaanxi]] province: this was the royal palace of the [[state of Qin]] before the Chinese unification, and then the palace of the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor]] when China was unified.
* [[Epang Palace]] (阿房宮 – probable meaning: "The Palace on the Hill"), 20&amp;nbsp;km/12 miles south of (Qin) Xianyang (咸陽), now 15&amp;nbsp;km/9 miles west of [[Xi'an]] (西安), [[Shaanxi]] province: the fabulous imperial palace built by the First Emperor in replacement of Xianyang Palace.
* [[Weiyang Palace]] (未央宮 – "The Endless Palace"), in (Han) [[Chang'an]] (長安), now 7&amp;nbsp;km/4 miles northeast of downtown [[Xi'an]] (西安), [[Shaanxi]] province: imperial palace of the prestigious [[Western Han Dynasty]] for two centuries. This is the largest palace ever built on Earth, covering 4.8&amp;nbsp;km² (1,200 acres), which is 6.7 times the size of the current [[Forbidden City]], or 11 times the size of the [[Vatican City]].
* [[Southern Palace]] (南宮) and [[Northern Palace]] (北宮), in [[Luoyang]] (洛陽), [[Henan]] province: imperial palaces of the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] for two centuries, the Southern Palace being used for court hearings and audiences, the Northern Palace being the private residence of the emperor and his concubines.
* [[Taiji Palace]] (太極宮 – "The Palace of the [[Supreme Ultimate]]"), also known as the Western Apartments (西内), in (Tang) [[Chang'an]] (長安), now downtown [[Xi'an]] (西安), [[Shaanxi]] province: imperial palace during the [[Sui Dynasty]] (who called it Daxing Palace – 大興宮) and in the beginning of the [[Tang Dynasty]] (until A.D. 663). Area: 4.2&amp;nbsp;km² (1,040 acres), imperial section proper: 1.92&amp;nbsp;km² (474 acres).
* [[Daming Palace]] (大明宮 – "The Palace of the Great Brightness"), also known as the Eastern Apartments (東内), in (Tang) [[Chang'an]] (長安), now downtown [[Xi'an]] (西安), [[Shaanxi]] province: imperial palace of the [[Tang Dynasty]] after A.D. 663 (it was briefly named Penglai Palace (蓬萊宮) between 663 and 705), but the prestigious Taiji Palace remained used for major state ceremonies such as coronations. Area: 3.11&amp;nbsp;km² (768 acres).
* [[Kaifeng Imperial Palace]] (東京大内皇宮), in Dongjing (東京), now called [[Kaifeng]] (開封), [[Henan]] province: imperial palace of the [[Northern Song Dynasty]].
* [[Hangzhou Imperial Palace]] (臨安大内禁宮), in Lin'an (臨安), now called [[Hangzhou]] (杭州), [[Zhejiang]] province: imperial palace of the [[Southern Song Dynasty]].
* [[Karakorum]] (哈拉和林)，site of the imperial palace of the [[Mongol Empire]].
* [[Shangdu]] (元上都) and [[Khanbaliq]] (元大都)，site of the imperial palace of the [[Yuan dynasty]].
* [[Ming Palace|Ming Imperial Palace]] (明故宮), in [[Nanjing]] (南京), [[Jiangsu]] province: imperial palace of the [[Ming Dynasty]] until 1421.
[[File:Forbidden City1.JPG|thumbnail|right| Hall of Supreme Harmony, [[Forbidden City]], Beijing]]
[[File:Xinhua Gate.jpg|thumbnail|right|Xinhua Gate, formal entrance to the [[Zhongnanhai]] compound.]]
* [[Forbidden City]] (紫禁城), now known in China as Beijing's Old Palace (北京故宫), in Jingshi (京師), now called [[Beijing]] (北京): imperial palace of the [[Ming Dynasty]] and [[Qing Dynasty]] from 1421 until 1924. Area: 720,000 m²  (178 acres).

Apart from the main imperial palace, [[Chinese dynasties]] also had several other imperial palaces in the capital city where the empress, crown prince, or other members of the imperial family dwelled. There also existed palaces outside of the capital city called "away palaces" (離宮) where the emperors resided when traveling. The habit also developed of building garden estates in the countryside surrounding the capital city, where the emperors retired at times to get away from the rigid etiquette of the imperial palace, or simply to escape from the summer heat inside their capital. This practice reached a zenith with the [[Qing Dynasty]], whose emperors built the fabulous Imperial Gardens (御園), now known in China as the Gardens of Perfect Brightness (圓明園), and better known in English as the [[Old Summer Palace]]. The emperors of the Qing Dynasty resided and worked in the Imperial Gardens, 8&amp;nbsp;km/5 miles outside of the walls of [[Beijing]], the Forbidden City inside Beijing being used only for formal ceremonies.

These gardens were made up of three gardens: the Garden of Perfect Brightness proper, the Garden of Eternal Spring (長春園), and the Elegant Spring Garden (綺春園); they covered a huge area of 3.5&amp;nbsp;km² (865 acres), almost 5 times the size of the [[Forbidden City]], and 8 times the size of the [[Vatican City]].  comprising hundreds of halls, pavilions, temples, galleries, gardens, lakes, etc. Several famous landscapes of southern China had been reproduced in the Imperial Gardens, hundreds of invaluable Chinese art masterpieces and antiquities were stored in the halls, making the Imperial Gardens one of the largest museum in the world. Some unique copies of literary work and compilations were also stored inside the Imperial Gardens. In 1860, during the [[Second Opium War]], the British and French expeditionary forces looted the [[Old Summer Palace]]. Then on October 18, 1860, in order to "punish" the imperial court, which had refused to allow Western embassies inside [[Beijing]], the British general [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] – with protestations from the French – purposely ordered to set fire to the huge complex which burned to the ground. It took 3500 British troops to set the entire place ablaze and took three whole days to burn. The burning of the Gardens of Perfect Brightness is still a very sensitive issue in China today.

Following this cultural catastrophe, the imperial court was forced to relocate to the old and austere [[Forbidden City]] where it stayed until 1924, when the [[Puyi|Last Emperor]] was expelled by a republican army. Empress dowager [[Empress Dowager Cixi|Cixi]] (慈禧太后) built the [[Summer Palace]] (頤和園 – "The Garden of Nurtured Harmony") near the [[Old Summer Palace]], but on a much smaller scale than the [[Old Summer Palace]]. There are currently some projects in China to rebuild the Imperial Gardens, but this appears as a colossal undertaking, and no rebuilding has started yet.

[[German language|German]] has two contrasting words for what may be considered a palace: ''Schloss'' which connotes a seat that is ''enclosed'' by walls, a fastness or keep, and ''Palast'' (or mostly ''Palais''), a more conscious borrowing, with the usual connotations of splendour. In practice, the ''Schloss'' is more likely to be a royal or ducal palace or a noble manor house.

{{Educational research}}
A '''Lénárt sphere''' is a teaching and educational research model for [[spherical geometry]]. The Lénárt sphere is a modern replacement of a "spherical blackboard".&lt;ref name="Brummelen"&gt;{{cite book |first=Glen |last=Van Brummelen |title=Heavenly Mathematics: The Forgotten Art of Spherical Trigonometry  |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-691-14892-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0BCCz8Sx5wkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=van+brummelen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0SXuULbUFOLo2QXWqYCwDA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA 60-page preview of Van Brummelen], see p. xiii on Lenart (image redacted on Google)&lt;/ref&gt;
It can be used for visualizing [[sphere|spherical]] [[polygon]]s (especially [[triangle]]s) showing the relationships between the [[Edge (geometry)|sides]] and the [[angle]]s.

==Basic set==

The Lenart Sphere Basic Set includes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lenart Sphere|url=http://www.cymaths.co.uk/khxc/gbu0-prodshow/Lenart_Sphere.html|website=Chartwell-Yorke Maths ICT Store|access-date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A transparent plastic, eight-inch [[sphere]]
* A ring-shaped support, called a [[torus]], to place under the sphere
* Hemispherical transparencies that fit over the sphere so that students can draw on these with colored markers and cut out shapes with scissors
* A spherical ruler with two scaled edges for drawing and measuring arcs, angles, and great circles on the sphere
* A spherical compass and center locator for drawing circles on the sphere
* A set of transparency markers for writing and drawing on the sphere and transparencies
* A hanger for displaying your spherical constructions and designs
* A 16-page booklet, "Getting Started on the Lenart Sphere", with activities one can begin as soon as you open the box
* A four-color [[polyconic projection]] of the earth that one can cut out and transform into a globe

==Related products==
[[File:Lenart sphere equilateral triangle.jpg|thumb|Equilateral triangle constructed on a Lenart sphere.]]
Other products for studying spherical geometry include [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]] software programs such as [[The Geometer's Sketchpad]], [[GeoGebra]] and Spherical Easel &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://merganser.math.gvsu.edu/easel/|title=Spherical Easel|website=merganser.math.GVSU.edu|access-date=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;(see External links for Spherical Easel information, and visit [[List of interactive geometry software]] for non-Euclid, and many other interactive [[Projective geometry]] apps and programs).
Where these products only work on a flat [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], the Lénárt sphere is giving [[hands-on experience]] of spherical geometry.

== History ==
{{See also|History of trigonometry}}

The Lénárt sphere was invented by István Lénárt in Hungary in the early 1990s and its use is described in his 2003 book comparing planar and spherical geometry.&lt;ref name="The Lenart Sphere"&gt;{{citation |first=Istvan |last=Lenart |title=Non-Euclidean Adventures on the Lenart Sphere: Activities Comparing Planar and Spherical Geometry  |publisher=Key Curriculum Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-1559531030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spherical trigonometry]] used to be an important mathematics topic from antiquity through the end of [[World War II]], and has been replaced in modern education and (in navigation) with more algorithmic methods as well as [[GPS]], including the [[Haversine formula]], linear algebraic [[matrix multiplication]], and [[Spherical trigonometry#Napier's Pentagon|Napier's pentagon]]. The Lénárt sphere is still widely used throughout Europe in [[non-Euclidean geometry]] as well as [[GIS]] courses.

== Spherical tessellation ==

The Lénárt sphere is useful in modeling and demonstrating spherical tesselation techniques, especially as they apply to finite analysis problems. Using 3D graphics programs or Python code (see external reference link 8 for open source Python code examples vs. [[NURBS]]), greater and greater numbers of polygons can be projected to and from the sphere both for analysis of finite elements, and synthesis of objects and features on the sphere, such as the asteroid ridden planet in the example. In this case, the Lénárt sphere is useful for tesselation (tiling) as a simplification or approximation shortcut to the extremely complex differential math of finite analysis and construction (technically: modeling), especially of animated objects.&lt;ref name=Mechtley&gt;{{cite book |first=Adam |last=Mechtley |title=Maya Python for Games and Film  |publisher=[[Morgan Kaufmann]] |year=2011 |isbn=978-0123785787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a collaboration of [[Alan Dressler]] and Augustus Oemler, Jr., at [[Carnegie Institution for Science#Observatories of the CIW|Observatory of the Carnegie Institute of Washington]], [[Warrick Couch|Warrick J. Couch]] at the [[University of New South Wales]], [[Richard Ellis (astronomer)|Richard Ellis]] at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], Bianca M. Poggianti at the [[University of Padua]], [[Amy Barger]] at the [[University of Hawaii|University of Hawaii's]] [[Institute for Astronomy]], [[Harvey Raymond Butcher|Harvey Butcher]] at [[ASTRON]], and Ray M. Sharples and Ian Smail at [[Durham University]]. Results were published through 2000.

The collaboration sought answers to the differences in the origins of the various galaxy types — [[Elliptical galaxy|elliptical]], [[Lenticular galaxy|lenticular]], and [[Spiral galaxy|spiral]]. The studies found that elliptical galaxies were the oldest and formed from the violent merger of other galaxies about two to three billion years after the [[Big Bang]]. Star formation in elliptical galaxies ceased about that time. On the other hand, new stars are still forming in the spiral arms of spiral galaxies. Lenticular galaxies (SO) are intermediate between the first two.  They contain structures similar to spiral arms, but devoid of the gas and new stars of the spiral galaxies. Lenticular galaxies are the prevalent form in rich galaxy clusters, which suggests that spirals may be transformed into lenticular galaxies as time progresses.  The exact process may be related to high galactic density, or to the total mass in a rich cluster’s central core. The Morphs collaboration found that one of the principal mechanisms of this transformation involves the interaction among spiral galaxies, as they fall toward the core of the cluster.

The Inamori Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph (IMACS) Cluster Building Survey is the follow-on project to the Morphs collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://obs.carnegiescience.edu/research/adressler/ "Alan Dressler"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925110325/http://obs.carnegiescience.edu/research/adressler/ |date=2011-09-25 }} Carnegie Institution for Science&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pott's fracture''', also known as '''Pott's syndrome I''' and '''Dupuytren fracture''', is an archaic term loosely applied to a variety of [[Bimalleolar fracture|bimalleolar]] ankle fractures.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, T., Peltier, L.F. Lund, P. J. (2000). ''[http://radiographics.rsnajnls.org/cgi/content/full/20/3/819 Radiographics. 20:819-736]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The injury is caused by a combined abduction external rotation from an eversion force. This action strains the sturdy medial (deltoid) ligament of the ankle, often tearing off the [[medial malleolus]] due to its strong attachment. The [[talus bone|talus]] then moves laterally, shearing off the [[lateral malleolus]] or, more commonly, breaking the [[fibula]] superior to the tibiofibular [[syndesmosis]]. If the tibia is carried anteriorly, the posterior margin of the distal end of the tibia is also sheared off by the talus. A fractured fibula in addition to detaching the medial malleolus will tear the tibiofibular syndesmosis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Moore and Agur. Essential Clinical Anatomy. Lippincotts Williams and Wilkins. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The combined fracture of the medial malleolus, lateral malleolus, and the posterior margin of the distal end of the tibia is known as a "trimalleolar fracture".&lt;ref&gt;Moore and Dalley. Clinically Oriented Anatomy. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of Pott's fracture would be in a sports tackling injury. The player receives a blow to the outside of the ankle, causing the ankle to roll inwards (so that the sole of the foot faces laterally). This damages the ligaments on the inside of the ankle and fractures the fibula at the point of contact (usually just above the tibiofibular syndesmosis). A better way to visualize this is the two hands of a clock, with one hand facing 12 and the other facing 6. The vertical line they form represents the fibula of the person's right leg. The lateral force approaches from 3 o'clock, sending the lower hand snapping outwards to point at 5 o'clock.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Bimalleolar fractures are less likely to result in arthritis than [[trimalleolar fracture]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid10901648"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wilson FC |title=Fractures of the ankle: pathogenesis and treatment |journal=Journal of the Southern Orthopaedic Association |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=105–15 |year=2000 |pmid=10901648 |doi= |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewpublication/137_toc?vol=9&amp;iss=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In [[physics]], the '''Rayleigh–Jeans Law''' is an approximation to the [[spectral radiance]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] as a function of [[wavelength]] from a [[black body]] at a given temperature through classical arguments. For wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, it is:

:&lt;math&gt;B_{\lambda} (T) = \frac{2 ck_{\mathrm{B}} T}{\lambda^4},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;B_{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; is the  [[spectral radiance]]; the power emitted per unit emitting area, per steradian, per unit wavelength, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;  is the [[speed of light]], &lt;math&gt;k_{\mathrm{B}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[temperature]] in [[kelvin]]s.  For [[frequency]] &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;, the expression is instead

:&lt;math&gt;B_{\nu}(T) = \frac{2 \nu^2 k_{\mathrm{B}} T}{c^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Rayleigh–Jeans law agrees with experimental results at large wavelengths (low frequencies) but strongly disagrees at short wavelengths (high frequencies).  This inconsistency between observations and the predictions of [[classical physics]] is commonly known as the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]].&lt;ref&gt;''Astronomy: A Physical Perspective'', Mark L. Kutner pp. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Radiative Processes in Astrophysics'', Rybicki and Lightman pp. 20–28&lt;/ref&gt; Its resolution in 1900 with the derivation by [[Max Planck]] of [[Planck's law]], which gives the correct radiation at all frequencies, was a foundational aspect of the development of [[quantum mechanics]] in the early 20th century.

==Historical development==

In 1900, the British physicist [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]] derived the ''λ''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;4&lt;/sup&gt; dependence of the Rayleigh–Jeans law based on classical physical arguments and empirical facts.&lt;ref&gt;''Astronomy: A Physical Perspective'', Mark L. Kutner pp. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  A more complete derivation, which included the proportionality constant, was presented by Rayleigh and Sir [[James Jeans]] in 1905.  The Rayleigh–Jeans law revealed an important error in physics theory of the time.  The law predicted an energy output that diverges towards [[Infinity#Physics|infinity]] as wavelength approaches zero (as frequency tends to infinity).  Measurements of the spectral emission of actual black bodies revealed that the emission agreed with the Rayleigh–Jeans law at low frequencies but diverged at high frequencies; reaching a maximum and then falling with frequency, so the total energy emitted is finite.

==Comparison to Planck's law==

In 1900 [[Max Planck]] empirically obtained an expression for [[black-body radiation]] expressed in terms of wavelength {{nowrap|''λ'' {{=}} ''c''/''ν''}} ([[Planck's law]]):

:&lt;math&gt;B_\lambda(T) = \frac{2 h c^2}{\lambda^5}~\frac{1}{e^\frac{hc}{\lambda k_\mathrm{B} T}-1},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]] and {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}} the [[Boltzmann constant]].  The Planck's law does not suffer from an ultraviolet catastrophe, and agrees well with the experimental data, but its full significance (which ultimately led to quantum theory) was only appreciated several years later. Since,

:&lt;math&gt;e^x = 1 + x + {x^2 \over 2!} + {x^3 \over 3!} + \cdots. &lt;/math&gt;

then in the limit of high temperatures or long wavelengths, the term in the exponential becomes small, and the exponential is well approximated with the [[Taylor series|Taylor polynomial's]] first-order term,

:&lt;math&gt;e^{\frac{hc}{\lambda k_\mathrm{B} T}} \approx 1 + \frac{hc}{\lambda k_\mathrm{B} T}.&lt;/math&gt;

So,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{e^\frac{hc}{\lambda k_\mathrm{B} T}-1} \approx \frac{1}{\frac{hc}{\lambda k_\mathrm{B} T}} = \frac{\lambda k_\mathrm{B} T}{hc}.&lt;/math&gt;

This results in Planck's blackbody formula reducing to
:&lt;math&gt;B_{\lambda}(T) = \frac{2 ck_\mathrm{B} T}{\lambda^4},&lt;/math&gt;
which is identical to the classically derived Rayleigh–Jeans expression.

The same argument can be applied to the blackbody radiation expressed in terms of frequency {{nowrap|''ν'' {{=}} ''c''/''λ''}}. In the limit of small frequencies, that is &lt;math&gt; h \nu \ll k_\mathrm{B} T &lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;B_\nu(T) = \frac{2 h\nu^3}{c^2}\frac{1}{e^\frac{h\nu}{k_\mathrm{B} T} - 1} \approx \frac{2 h\nu^3}{c^2} \cdot \frac{k_\mathrm{B} T}{h\nu} = \frac{2 \nu^2 k_\mathrm{B} T}{c^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This last expression is the Rayleigh–Jeans law in the limit of small frequencies.

==Consistency of frequency and wavelength dependent expressions==

When comparing the frequency and wavelength dependent expressions of the Rayleigh–Jeans law it is important to remember that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{d{\lambda}} = B_{\lambda}(T)&lt;/math&gt;, and 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{d{\nu}} = B_{\nu}(T)&lt;/math&gt; 
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;B_{\lambda}(T) \neq B_{\nu}(T)&lt;/math&gt;
even after substituting the value &lt;math&gt;\lambda =c/\nu&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;B_{\lambda}(T)&lt;/math&gt; has units of energy emitted per unit time per unit area of emitting surface, per unit solid angle, '''per unit wavelength''', whereas &lt;math&gt;B_{\nu}(T)&lt;/math&gt; has units of energy emitted per unit time per unit area of emitting surface, per unit solid angle, '''per unit frequency'''.  To be consistent, we must use the equality
:&lt;math&gt;B_{\lambda} \, d\lambda = dP = B_{\nu} \, d\nu&lt;/math&gt;
where both sides now have units of power (energy emitted per unit time) per unit area of emitting surface, per unit solid angle.

Starting with the Rayleigh–Jeans law in terms of wavelength we get
:&lt;math&gt;B_{\lambda}(T) = B_{\nu}(T) \times \frac{d\nu}{d\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\nu}{d\lambda} = \frac{d}{d\lambda}\left(\frac{c}{\lambda}\right) = -\frac{c}{\lambda^2}&lt;/math&gt;.
This leads us to find:
:&lt;math&gt;B_{\lambda}(T) = \frac{2k_\mathrm{B} T\left( \frac{c}{\lambda}\right)^2}{c^2} \times \frac{c}{\lambda^2} = \frac{2ck_\mathrm{B} T}{\lambda^4}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Other forms of Rayleigh–Jeans law==

Depending on the application, the Planck function can be expressed in 3 different forms.  The first involves energy emitted per unit time per unit area of emitting surface, per unit solid angle, per spectral unit.  In this form, the Planck function and associated Rayleigh–Jeans limits are given by
:&lt;math&gt;B_\lambda(T) = \frac{2 hc^2}{\lambda^5}~\frac{1}{e^\frac{hc}{\lambda k_\mathrm{B} T}-1} \approx \frac{2c k_\mathrm{B} T}{\lambda^4}&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;B_\nu(T) = \frac{2h\nu^3}{c^2}\frac{1}{e^\frac{h\nu}{k_\mathrm{B} T} - 1} \approx \frac{2k_\mathrm{B} T\nu^2}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, Planck's law can be written as an expression &lt;math&gt;I(\nu,T) = \pi B_\nu(T)&lt;/math&gt; for emitted power integrated over all solid angles.  In this form, the Planck function and associated Rayleigh–Jeans limits are given by
:&lt;math&gt;I(\lambda,T) =  \frac{2\pi hc^2}{\lambda^5}~\frac{1}{e^\frac{hc}{\lambda k_\mathrm{B} T}-1} \approx \frac{2\pi ck_\mathrm{B} T}{\lambda^4}&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;I(\nu,T) =  \frac{2\pi h\nu^3}{c^2}\frac{1}{e^\frac{h\nu}{k_\mathrm{B} T} - 1} \approx \frac{2 \pi k_\mathrm{B} T\nu^2}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

In other cases, Planck's law is written as &lt;math&gt;u(\nu,T) = \frac{4\pi}{c} B_\nu(T)&lt;/math&gt; for energy per unit volume (energy density).  In this form, the Planck function and associated Rayleigh–Jeans limits are given by
:&lt;math&gt;u(\lambda,T) = \frac{8 \pi hc}{\lambda^5}~\frac{1}{e^\frac{hc}{\lambda k_\mathrm{B} T}-1} \approx \frac{8\pi  k_\mathrm{B} T}{\lambda^4}&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;u(\nu,T) = \frac{8\pi h\nu^3}{c^3}\frac{1}{e^\frac{h\nu}{k_\mathrm{B} T} - 1} \approx \frac{8 \pi k_\mathrm{B} T\nu^2}{c^3}&lt;/math&gt;

However, with [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]], these electrons can act as mobile [[Cooper pairs]] and are able to superconduct.

==Description==
[[File:Valence bond solid.png|thumb|right|The RVB state with [[valence bond]] coupling of nearest-neighbor electrons.]]
The physics of Mott insulators is described by the repulsive Hubbard model [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]:

:&lt;math&gt;H=-t\sum_{\langle ij\rangle}c^{\dagger}_{i\sigma}c_{j\sigma}+\text{h.c.}+U\sum_in_{i\uparrow}n_{i\downarrow}&lt;/math&gt;

In 1971, Anderson first suggested that this Hamiltonian can have a non-degenerate ground state that is composed of disordered spin states. Shortly after the high-temperature superconductors were discovered, Anderson and Kivelson et al. proposed a ''resonating valence bond'' ground state for these materials, written as

:&lt;math&gt;|\text{RVB}\rangle=\sum_C|C\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; represented a covering of a lattice by nearest neighbor dimers. Each such covering is weighted equally. In a [[mean field approximation]], the RVB state can be written in terms of a [[Gutzwiller projection]], and displays a superconducting phase transition per the [[Kosterlitz-Thouless]] mechanism.&lt;ref name=baskaran2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baskaran|first=Ganapathy|title=Five-fold way to new high Tc superconductors|journal=Pramana|year=2009|volume=73|issue=1|pages=61–112|doi=10.1007/s12043-009-0094-8|url=http://www.ias.ac.in/pubs/splpubs/pjubileebook/279.pdf|accessdate=8 April 2012|bibcode = 2009Prama..73...61B }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a rigorous proof for the existence of a superconducting ground state in either the Hubbard or the t-J Hamiltonian is not yet known.&lt;ref name=baskaran2009 /&gt;  Further the stability of the RVB ground state has not yet been confirmed.&lt;ref name=kotliar1989&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dombre|first=Thierry|author2=Gabriel Kotliar |title=Instability of the long-range resonating valence bond state in the mean-field approach|journal=Physical Review B|year=1989|volume=39|issue=1|pages=855–857|url=http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~kotliar/papers/PRB_39_855.pdf|accessdate=8 April 2012|bibcode = 1989PhRvB..39..855D |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevB.39.855 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic trends ===
Pacific Island economies are mostly dependent on natural resources, with a tiny manufacturing sector and no heavy industry. In Fiji and Papua New Guinea, for instance, there is a need to adopt automated machinery and design in forestry and to improve training, in order to add value to exports.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=693–731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papua New Guinea experienced the strongest economic growth between 2005 and 2013 (60%), during the commodities boom. Even during the global financial and economic crisis of 2008-2009, its economy grew by 13%. Vanuatu saw the next strongest growth (35%) over this period, including 10% growth in 2008-2009. Growth was more pedestrian in the Marshall Islands (a cumulative 19%), Tuvalu (16%), Samoa (15%), Kiribati (13%), Fiji (12%) and Tongo (8%). The economies of the Federated States of Micronesia and Palau actually shrank over this nine-year period. Samoa, the Marshall Islands and Fiji all experienced recession in 2008 and 2009.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The trade balance is more skewed towards imports than exports, with the exception of Papua New Guinea, which has a mining industry. There is growing evidence that Fiji is becoming a re-export hub in the Pacific; between 2009 and 2013, its re-exports grew threefold, accounting for more than half of all exports by Pacific Island states. Samoa can also expect to become more integrated in global markets from now on, having joined the [[World Trade Organization]] in 2012. Fiji, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands are also members of the World Trade Organization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Pacific Island states make up a very small share of the South Pacific's high-tech exports. These exports receded between 2008 and 2013 by 46% for Fiji and by 41% for Samoa, according to the United Nations' Comtrade database. Fiji's high-tech exports were down from US$5.0 million to US$2.7 million and Samoa's from US$0.3 to US$0.2 million.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2013, the majority of Fijian high-tech exports were pharmaceutical products (84%), whereas Samoa exports mainly scientific instruments (86%) and Kiribati non-electrical machinery (79%). Armaments make up 92% of high-exports from the Solomon Islands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Internet access ===
By 2013, one in three inhabitants of Fiji, Tonga and Tuvalu had Internet access. Growth in internet access since 2010 has levelled out the disparity between countries to some extent, although connectivity remained extremely low in Vanuatu (11%), the Solomon Islands (8%) and Papua New Guinea (7%) in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Advances in mobile phone technology have clearly been a factor in the provision of internet access to remote areas. The flow of knowledge and information through internet is likely to play an important role in the more effective dissemination and application of knowledge across the vast Pacific Island nations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Regional initiatives ==

=== Regional bodies addressing technological issues ===
The lack of national and regional policy frameworks has been a major stumbling block for developing integrated national agendas. Since 2010, Pacific Island states have moved forward in this regard by establishing a number of regional bodies to address technological issues for sectorial development. None of these agencies has a specific mandate for science and technology policy however. Examples are the:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Secretariat of the Pacific Community for climate change, fisheries and agriculture;
* Pacific Forum Secretariat for transport and telecommunications; and
* Secretariat of the Pacific Region Environmental Programme for related issues.

=== Pacific–Europe Network for Science, Technology and Innovation ===
The establishment of the Pacific–Europe Network for Science, Technology and Innovation (PACE-Net Plus) goes some way towards filling the void in science policy, at least temporarily. Funded by the European Commission within its Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2007–2013), this project has spanned the period 2013–2016 and thus overlaps with the European Union’s [[Horizon 2020]] programme.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The objectives of PACE–Net Plus are to reinforce the dialogue between the Pacific region and Europe in science, technology and innovation; to support biregional research and innovation through calls for research proposals; and to promote scientific excellence and industrial and economic competition. Ten of its 16 members come from the Pacific region and the remainder from Europe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Pacific partners are the Australian National University, Montroix Pty Ltd (Australia), University of the South Pacific, Institut Malardé in French Caledonia, National Centre for Technological Research into Nickel and its Environment in New Caledonia, South Pacific Community, Landcare Research Ltd in New Zealand, University of Papua New Guinea, Samoa National University and the Vanuatu Cultural Centre.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The other six partners are: the Association of Commonwealth Universities, the Institut de recherche pour le développement in France, the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation, a joint international institution of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States and the European Union, the Sociedade Portuguesa de Inovação, United Nations Industrial Development Organization and Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Ecology in Germany.

PACE-Net Plus focuses on three societal challenges:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Health, demographic change and well-being;
* Food security, sustainable agriculture, marine and maritime research and the bio-economy; and
* Climate action, resource efficiency and raw materials.
PACE–Net Plus has organized a series of high-level policy dialogue platforms alternately in the Pacific region and in Brussels, the headquarters of the [[European Commission]]. These platforms bring together key government and institutional stakeholders in both regions, around STI issues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A conference held in Suva (Fiji) in 2012 under the umbrella of PACE–Net Plus produced recommendations for a strategic plan for research, innovation and development in the Pacific. The conference report published in 2013 identified R&amp;D needs in the Pacific in seven areas:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* health;
* agriculture and forestry;
* fisheries and aquaculture;
* biodiversity and ecosystem management;
* freshwater;
* natural hazards; and
* energy.

=== Pacific Islands University Research Network ===
Noting the general absence of regional and national policies and plans for science, technology and innovation in the Pacific, the PACE–Net Plus conference established the Pacific Islands University Research Network to support intra- and inter- regional knowledge creation and sharing and to prepare succinct recommendations for the development of a regional policy framework for science, technology and innovation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This formal research network will complement the Fiji-based [[University of the South Pacific]], which has campuses in other Pacific Island countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Importance of data to inform policy ===
It was intended for the policy role of the Pacific Islands University Research Network to be informed by evidence gleaned from measuring capability in science, technology and innovation but the absence of data presents a formidable barrier. As of 2015, only Fiji had recent data on expenditure on research and development (R&amp;D) and there were no recent data on researchers and technicians for any of the developing Pacific island countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Without relevant data, it will be difficult for developing Pacific Island states to monitor their progress towards [https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg9 Sustainable Development target 9.5], namely: ''Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries, including, by 2030, encouraging innovation and substantially increasing the number of research and development workers per 1 million people and public and private research and development spending''. The two indicators chosen by the United Nations to measure progress are research and development expenditure as a proportion of GDP (9.5.1) and Researchers (in full-time equivalent) per million inhabitants (9.5.2).

== National policy issues ==

=== Fiji ===

==== Higher education ====
Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Samoa all consider education to be one of the key policy tools for driving science, technology and innovation, as well as modernization. Fiji, in particular, has made a supreme effort to re-visit existing policies, rules and regulations in this sector. The Fijian government allocates a larger portion of its national budget to education than any other Pacific Island country (4.2% of GDP in 2011), although this is down from 6% of GDP in 2000. The proportion of the education budget allocated to higher education (0.5% of GDP) amounts to 13% of the public education budget. Scholarship schemes like National Toppers, introduced in 2014, and the availability of student loans have made higher education attractive and rewarding in Fiji.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to an internal investigation into the choice of disciplines in school-leaving examinations (year 13), Fijian students have shown a greater interest in science since 2011. A similar trend can be observed in enrolment figures at all three Fijian universities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Many Pacific Island countries take Fiji as a benchmark for education. The country draws education leaders from other Pacific Island countries for training and, according to the Ministry of Education, teachers from Fiji are in great demand in these countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One important initiative has been the creation of the Higher Education Commission (FHEC) in 2010, the regulatory body in charge of tertiary education in Fiji. FHEC has embarked on registration and accreditation processes for tertiary-level education providers to improve the quality of higher education in Fiji. In 2014, FHEC allocated research grants to universities with a view to enhancing the research culture among faculty.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Research and development ====
Fiji is the only developing Pacific Island country with recent data for gross domestic expenditure on research and development (GERD). The national Bureau of Statistics cites a GERD/GDP ratio of 0.15% in 2012. Private-sector research and development (R&amp;D) is negligible. Between 2007 and 2012, government investment in R&amp;D tended to favour agriculture. Scientists publish much more in geosciences and medical sciences than in agricultural sciences, however.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===== Agriculture =====
Food security has been given high priority in the ''Fiji 2020 Agriculture Sector Policy'', as part of a shift from subsistence to commercial agriculture and agro-processing. Strategies outlined in Fiji 2020 include:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* modernizing agriculture in Fiji;
* developing integrated systems for agriculture;
* improving delivery of agricultural support systems;
* enhancing innovative agricultural business models; and
* strengthening the capacity for policy formulation.
Fiji has taken the initiative of shifting away from subsistence agriculture towards commercial agriculture and agro-processing of root crops, tropical fruits, vegetables, spices, horticulture and livestock. In 2013, the Ministry of Agriculture revived Fiji’s ''Agricultural Journal'' in 2013, which had been dormant for 17 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2007, agriculture and primary production accounted for just under half of government expenditure on R&amp;D, according to the Fijian National Bureau of Statistics. By 2012, this had risen to almost 60%. Scientists publish much more in the field of geosciences than in agriculture, though. Between 2008 and 2014, agriculture accounted for only 11 out of Fiji's 460 articles catalogued in Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded), compared to 85 articles in geosciences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The rise in government spending on agricultural research has come to the detriment of  research in education, which dropped to 35% of total research spending between 2007 and 2012. Government expenditure on health has remained fairly constant, at about 5% of the total for research, according to the Fijian National Bureau of Statistics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===== Health =====
Over the six years to 2012, government expenditure on health remained fairly constant but low in Fiji, at about 5% of the total for research, according to the Fijian National Bureau of Statistics. This may explain why medical sciences accounted for only 72 out of Fiji's 460 articles catalogued in Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded) between 2008 and 2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Fijian Ministry of Health is seeking to develop endogenous research capacity through the ''Fiji Journal of Public Health'', which it launched in 2012. A new set of guidelines are now in place to help build endogenous capacity in health research through training and access to new technology. The new policy guidelines require that all research projects initiated in Fiji with external bodies demonstrate how the project will contribute to local capacity-building in health research.

===== Fisheries =====
The desire to ensure that fisheries remain sustainable is fuelling the drive to use science and technology to make the transition to value-added production. The fisheries sector in Fiji is currently dominated by the catch of tuna for the Japanese market. The Fijian government plans to diversify this sector through aquaculture, inshore fisheries and offshore fish products such as sunfish and deep-water snapper. Accordingly, many incentives and concessions are being offered to encourage the private sector to invest in these areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===== ICT sector =====
Fiji has shown substantial growth in access to Internet and mobile phone services. This trend has been supported by its geographical location, service culture, pro-business policies, English-speaking population and well-connected [[e-society]]. Relative to many other South Pacific Islands, Fiji has a fairly reliable and efficient telecommunications system with access to the Southern Cross submarine cable linking New Zealand, Australia and North America. A recent move to establish the University of the South Pacific Stathan ICT Park, the Kalabo ICT economic zone and the ATH technology park in Fiji should boost the ICT support service sector in the Pacific region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Papua New Guinea ===

==== Higher education ====
In its ''Higher Education Plan III 2014–2023'', Papua New Guinea sets out a strategy for transforming tertiary education and R&amp;D through the introduction of a quality assurance system and a programme to overcome its limited R&amp;D capacity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Research and development ====
The ''National Vision 2050'' was adopted in 2009. It has led to the establishment of the Research, Science and Technology Council. At its gathering in November 2014, the Council re-emphasized the need to focus on sustainable development through science and technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Vision 2050''’s medium-term priorities are:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* emerging industrial technology for downstream processing;
* infrastructure technology for the economic corridors;
* knowledge-based technology;
* Science and engineering education; and
* to reach the target of investing 5% of GDP in R&amp;D by 2050.

Between 2008 and 2014, 82% of scientific articles from Papua New Guinea concerned the biological and medical sciences.  Less than 10% of the country's 517 articles catalogued in Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded) focused on geosciences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Sustainable development ==

=== Disaster resilience ===
Countries around the Pacific Rim are seeking ways to link their national knowledge base to regional and global advances in science. One motivation for this greater interconnectedness is the region’s vulnerability to geohazards such as earthquakes and tsunamis – the Pacific Rim is not known as the [[Ring of Fire]] for nothing. In 2009, Samoa suffered a submarine [[2009 Samoa earthquake and tsunami|earthquake]] of a magnitude of 8.1 on the Richter Scale, the strongest earthquake recorded that year. The subsequent tsunami caused substantial damage and loss of life in [[Samoa]], [[American Samoa]], and [[Tonga]].

The need for greater disaster resilience is inciting countries to develop collaboration in the geosciences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Climate change ===
Climate change is a parallel concern, as the Pacific Rim is also one of the most vulnerable regions to rising sea levels and increasingly capricious weather patterns. In March 2015, for instance, much of Vanuatu was flattened by Cyclone Pam.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Climate change seems to be the most pressing environmental issue for Pacific Island countries, as it is already affecting almost all socio-economic sectors. The consequences of climate change can be seen in agriculture, food security, forestry and even in the spread of communicable diseases. Climate change mostly concerns marine issues, such as the growing frequency and severity of storms, rising sea levels and the increased salinity of soils and groundwater.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Secretariat of the Pacific Community has initiated several activities to tackle problems associated with climate change. These cover a great variety of areas, including fisheries, freshwater, agriculture, coastal zone management, disaster management, energy, traditional knowledge, education, forestry, communication, tourism, culture, health, weather, gender implications and biodiversity. Almost all Pacific Island countries are involved in one or more of these activities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Pacific Adaptation to Climate Change ====
The first major scheme focusing on adaptation to climate change and climate variability dates back to 2009. Pacific Adaptation to Climate Change involves 13 Pacific Island nations, with international funding from the [[Global Environment Facility]], as well as from the US and Australian governments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Secretariat of the Pacific Region Environment Programme ====
Several projects related to climate change are also being co-ordinated by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]], within the Secretariat of the Pacific Region Environmental Programme (SPREP). The aim of SPREP is to help all members improve their ‘capacity to respond to climate change through policy improvement, implementation of practical adaptation measures, enhancing ecosystem resilience to the impacts of climate change and implementing initiatives aimed at achieving low-carbon development’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Samoa Pathway ===
The blueprint for the subregion’s sustainable development over the coming decade is the [[Samoa Pathway,|''Samoa Pathway'',]] the action plan adopted by countries at the third United Nations Conference on Small Island Developing States in Apia (Samoa) in September 2014. The ''Samoa Pathway'' focuses on, inter alia, sustainable consumption and production; sustainable energy, tourism and transportation; climate change; disaster risk reduction; forests; water and sanitation, food security and nutrition; chemical and waste management; oceans and seas; biodiversity; desertification, land degradation and drought; and health and non-communicable diseases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/samoapathway.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]

=== Forestry ===
Forestry is an important economic resource for Fiji and Papua New Guinea. However, forestry in both countries uses low and semi-intensive technological inputs. As a result, product ranges are limited to sawed timber, veneer, plywood, block board, moulding, poles and posts and wood chips. Only a few limited finished products are exported. Lack of automated machinery, coupled with inadequately trained local technical personnel, are some of the obstacles to introducing automated machinery and design. Policy-makers need to turn their attention to eliminating these barriers, in order for forestry to make a more efficient and sustainable contribution to national economic development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Energy ===
On average, 10% of the GDP of Pacific Island countries funds imports of petroleum products but in some cases this figure can exceed 30%. In addition to high fuel transport costs, this reliance on fossil fuels leaves Pacific economies vulnerable to volatile global fuel prices and potential spills by oil tankers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Consequently, many Pacific Island countries are convinced that renewable energy will play a role in their socio-economic development. In Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Vanuatu, renewable energy sources already represent significant shares of the total electricity supply: 60%, 66%, 37% and 15% respectively. Tokelau has even become the first country in the world to generate 100% of its electricity using renewable sources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to the [[Secretariat of the pacific community|Secretariat of the Pacific Community]], renewable energy still represented less than 10% of total energy use in the 22 Pacific Island countries and territories in 2015. The [[Secretariat of the pacific community|Secretariat of the Pacific Community]] observed that, 'while Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Samoa are leading the way with large-scale hydropower projects, there is enormous potential to expand the deployment of other renewable energy options such as solar, wind, geothermal and ocean-based energy sources'.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spc.int/edd/fr/section-01/energy-overview/energy?start=12|title=Pacific-first centre of excellence for renewable energy and energy efficiency takes shape|last=|first=|date=18 June 2015|work=Secretariat of Pacific Community press release|access-date=17 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International development partners are participating in several projects to develop renewable energy in the Pacific island states.

==== Cook Islands Renewable Energy Chart Implementation Plan ====
In the Cook Islands, for instance, the [[Asian Development Bank]] plans to supply electricity from renewable energy to all inhabited islands by 2020, within the ''Cook Islands Renewable Energy Chart Implementation Plan for 2012–2020''. New solar photovoltaic power plants with lithium-ion batteries were being built on up to six islands of the Southern Group in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.mfem.gov.ck/images/MFEM_Documents/DCD_Docs/ADB/Pacific_Initiatives_and_PPSDI/Pacific_Energy_updates/2014-ADB_Pacific-energy-update.pdf|title=Pacific Energy Update 2014|last=|first=|publisher=Asian Development Bank|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pacific Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency ====
In April 2014, Pacific Ministers for Energy and Transport agreed to establish the Pacific Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, 'a first for the Pacific'. The centre will become part of the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]]'s network of regional Sustainable Energy for All Centres of Excellence, along with centres for the Caribbean Community, [[Economic Community of West African States]], the Southern African Development Community and the East African Community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Renewable Energy in Pacific Island Countries Developing Skills and Capacity programme ====
Efforts are under way to improve countries’ capacity to produce, conserve and use renewable energy. For example, the European Union has funded the Renewable Energy in Pacific Island Countries Developing Skills and Capacity programme (EPIC). Since its inception in 2013, EPIC has developed two master’s programmes in renewable energy management and helped to establish two Centres of Renewable Energy, one at the [[University of Papua New Guinea]] and the other at the [[University of Fiji]]. Both centres became operational in 2014 and aim to create a regional knowledge hub for the development of renewable energy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Adapting to Climate Change and Sustainable Energy programme ====
In February 2014, the European Union and the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat signed an agreement for a programme on Adapting to Climate Change and Sustainable Energy worth €37.26 million which will benefit 15 Pacific Island states. These are the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Inclusion of traditional knowledge ===
Limited freedom of expression and, in some cases, religious conservatism discourage research in certain areas but the experience of Pacific Island countries shows that sustainable development and a green economy can benefit from the inclusion of traditional knowledge in formal science and technology, as underlined by the ''Sustainable'' ''Development Brief'' prepared by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Renewable energy targets ===
Many Pacific Island countries established new targets for renewable energy between 2010 and 2012.

== Scientific output in the region ==

=== Trends in scientific authorship ===
According to the Web of Science, Papua New Guinea had the largest number of publications (110) among Pacific Island states in 2014, followed by Fiji (106). Fijian research was concentrated in a handful of scientific disciplines, such as medical sciences, geosciences and biology. Nine out of ten scientific publications from Papua New Guinea focused on immunology, genetics, biotechnology and microbiology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This pattern contrasts with the trend observed in the French territories of New Caledonia and French Polynesia, where there was a strong emphasis on geosciences: six to eight times the world average for this field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Trends in international co-authorship ===
More than three-quarters of articles published by scientists from Pacific Island nations between 2008 and 2014 were signed by international collaborators, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science, Science Citation Index Expanded. International co-authorship was higher for Papua New Guinea and Fiji (90% and 83% respectively) than for New Caledonia and French Polynesia (63% and 56% respectively).

All countries counted North American partners among their top five partners. Fijian research collaboration with North American partners even exceeded that with India, even though a large proportion of Fijians are of Indian origin.

Research partnerships also involved Australia and countries in Europe. Surprisingly, there was little co-authorship with authors based in France, with the notable exception of Vanuatu. Some Pacific Island states counted their neighbours among their closest scientific collaborators, as in the case of the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Many of the smaller Pacific Island states have a near-100% rate of co-authorsip This extremely high rate can be a double-edged sword. According to the Fijian Ministry of Health, research collaboration often results in an article being published in a reputed journal but gives very little back in terms of strengthening health in Fiji. A new set of guidelines are now in place in Fiji to help build endogenous capacity in health research through training and access to new technology. The new policy guidelines require that all research projects initiated in Fiji with external bodies demonstrate how the project will contribute to local capacity-building in health research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== A need to focus on local goals ===
Countries are struggling to steer their scientific efforts toward sustainable development, at a time when the United Nations’ [[Sustainable Development Goals]] have taken over from the [[Millennium Development Goals]] in 2016. It has been suggested that countries could begin by encouraging their scientists to focus more on attaining local goals for sustainable development, rather than on publishing in high-profile international journals on topics that may be of lesser local relevance. The difficulty with this course of action is that the key metrics for recognizing scientific quality are publications and citation data. The answer to this dilemma most likely lies in the need to recognize the global nature of many local development problems. 'We are dealing with problems without boundaries and we underestimate the scale and nature of their consequences at our collective peril. As global citizens, the research and policy communities have an obligation to collaborate and deliver, so arguing for national priorities seems irrelevant'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scidev.net/global/governance/editorials/global-priorities-local-context-a-governance-challenge-1.html|title=Global priorities: local context: a governance challenge|last=Perkins|first=Nick Ishmael|date=2012|work=SciDev.net|access-date=17 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New scientific journals ===
In 2012, the Fijian Ministry of Health launched the ''Fiji Journal of Public Health'', in an attempt to develop endogenous research capacity. In parallel, the Ministry of Agriculture revived Fiji’s ''Agricultural Journal'' in 2013, which had been dormant for 17 years.

In addition, two regional journals were launched in 2009 as a focus for Pacific scientific research, the ''Samoan Medical Journal'' and the ''Papua New Guinea Journal of Research, Science and Technology''.

'''Test Stand VII''' ({{lang-de|Prüfstand VII}}, P-7) was the principal  [[V-2 rocket]] testing facility at [[Peenemünde Airfield]] and was capable of static firing of rocket motors up to 200 tons thrust.  Notable events at the site include the [[List of V-2 test launches|first successful V-2 launch]] on 3 October 1942, visits by German military leaders, and Allied reconnaissance overflights and bombing.

==Description==
Two distinguishing features of P-7 were the 670-yard-long&lt;ref name=Irving&gt;

The concrete trench, nearly {{convert|25|ft|m}} wide with {{convert|3|ft|m}} concrete walls, sloped gradually away from each side of the flame deflector to a depth of {{convert|20|ft|m}}, rising again symmetrically toward the side of the arena.   Beside the flame pit was a long underground room where {{convert|4|ft|m}} diameter delivery pipes were housed to route cooling water at 120 gallon per second from three huge pumps in the pumphouse to the flame deflector in the pit.&lt;ref name=Dornberger&gt;

While the elliptical sand wall was for blocking high sea winds and blown sand, concrete structures were integrated into the wall and under the ground to protect equipment and personnel from rocket explosions and enemy bombing (a sand-filled dummy warhead, called "the elephant", was normally used).  A large gap in the wall allowed easy entry by vehicles (particularly railcars with propellants), and an open tunnel through the ellipse wall at the narrower southern end also allowed entry. Integrated into the ellipse wall next to the tunnel was a massive observation and measuring [[blockhouse]] containing the control center.  The control center had a double door with a bulletproof glass window from which an observer maintained telephone communication with the Telemetering Building at a remote location from P-7.  A receiver in a lighthouse near [[Koserow]] provided telemetry from rockets with the Wolman System&lt;ref name=Neufeld&gt;

:{{note|2|Note 2}}:  For automatic motor cutoff, in 1940-1941 Professor Wolman of Dresden created an alternative of his tracking system to use a ground signal transponded by the A-4 to measure the velocity of the missile and, by triangulating from multiple sites, determined the trajectory.&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Doppler radar|Doppler]] tracking.&lt;ref name=Pocock&gt;

{{cite book |last=Pocock|first=Rowland F|title=German Guided Missiles of the Second World War|year=1967 |publisher=Arco Publishing Company, Inc. |location=New York |isbn= |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For rockets that used radio control for V-2 engine cutoff, the [[Brennschluss]] equipment included a transmitter on the bank of the [[Peene]] about {{convert|7.5|mi|km}} from P-7 and the [[Doppler radar]] at [[Lubmin]] (a motorized [[Würzburg radar]], the "rhinoceros").&lt;ref name=Dornberger/&gt;&lt;ref name=Huzel/&gt;

===Control room===
The control room also had switchboards, a row of four [[periscope]]s, [[manometer]]s, frequency gauges, [[voltmeter]]s and [[ammeter]]s, green/red/white signal lamps, and switches at the propulsion console and guidance panel to dynamically display approximately 15 measurement points within the rocket. Additionally, the control room had a big "X-time" [[countdown]] clock that display the time until launch, which was announced via loudspeakers as "''X minus four minutes''", etc.  In addition to the control room, the blockhouse also contained offices, a conference room, a small dormitory with double bunks and an adjoining shower, a wash room, and a workshop. A long underground corridor led from the measurement blockhouse to a room in the concrete foundation by the flame pit, and multiple rows of measurement cables covered the walls of the tunnel. A different gradually rising tunnel led from the long flame pit room to the exterior of the arena near the pumphouse ({{lang-de|Pumpenhaus}}). Near the pumphouse were high wooden towers to cool the water, and {{convert|25|ft|m}} high tanks for the recooling water were integrated into the ellipse wall.&lt;ref name=Dornberger/&gt;&lt;ref name=Huzel/&gt;

===Test tower===
The prominent tower within the arena was a mobile test frame/crane (''Fahrbare Kranbühne'')&lt;ref name=Klee/&gt; which could be moved over the flame pit to position the rocket nozzle 25 feet above the deflector, and which allowed an entire missile to be gimbaled in two directions up to five degrees from vertical.  The tower included an elevator and a German-made [[Mettler Toledo|Toledo scale]] for thrust measurements.  Actual launches were from a steel table-like structure (firing stand, ''Brennstand'') across the railway from the flame pit on the test stand's large concrete foundation.  Under the concrete foundation were the recorder room, a small shop, an office, compressed nitrogen storage cylinders, and catch tanks.  The arena also included an engine cold-calibration pad for conducting flow test measurements by pumping water (instead of [[Liquid oxygen]]) and [[List of Stoffs|alcohol]] (which was recovered afterward) via the turbopump through the combustion chamber.  Since the V-2 motor had no controller for the turbopump, cold-calibration allowed the determination of "freak cases" of equipment.&lt;ref name=Dornberger/&gt;&lt;ref name=Huzel/&gt;

{{Quote box |width=25em |align=left  |bgcolor=#B0C4DE
|title=Launch Description
|quote=The heavy missile ... rose only 15 feet above the firing table.  Then it stood still!  It stood upright in the air, showing no desire to turn over or to revolve about its longitudinal axis.  It was an unbelievable sight.  At any moment the rocket would topple or fall back, crash and explode.  ... But I still kept my binoculars on the rocket. ... There must have been an interruption in the output of the steam generator for the propellant-pump turbine. ... The film operator, Kühn, had taken up position facing me on the [elliptical] wall of the test stand.  He must have had good nerves.  The rocket hung in the air just 100 yards away.[from Kühn]  Nothing daunted, ... He certainly knew from experience that the moment the projectile fell back he would be in mortal danger.  He just went on cranking.  ... Our exhaust vanes were doing a wonderful job.  The rocket stood unsupported in the air, as straight as a ramrod.  Only 4 seconds had passed, ... The rocket was bound to topple now.  The tilt [for trajectory control] would now begin automatically. ... The rocket grew lighter owing to the steady fuel consumption.  Almost imperceptibly, yard by yard, it began to climb.  Its nose turned very gradually eastward. ... At a height of 30 to 40 feet it moved slowly, still practically upright, toward the cameraman.  He went on cranking.  I caught my breath.  Just a little more tilt and the rocket would certainly capsize and explode ... Now it was over the wall.  Kühn knelt down and pointed his camera almost straight upward.  It was going to be some film!  ... I knew what was bound to come.  ... I saw him get up slowly, still cranking.  His camera was now practically horizontal.  Then he pointed it diagonally down from the high wall.  Boom! ... Smoke, flames, fragments of sheet-metal, branches, and sand whirled through the air.  The rocket had crashed ... 40 yards beyond the wall ... The cameraman was still cranking. ... I was filled with an immense pride.  ... only with men like this, could we finish the job that lay before us.

The roof of the hangar had camera stations for filming events.

==Allied reconnaissance and bombing==
On 15 May 1942 after photographing German destroyers berthed at the port of [[Kiel#History|Kiel]], [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] pilot Flight Lieutenant D. W. Stevenson photographed 'heavy construction work' near the Peenemünde aerodrome.  Later in the month [[Constance Babington Smith]] decided ''the scale was too small ... then something unusual caught my eye ... some extraordinary circular embankments ... I then dismissed the whole thing from my mind.''&lt;ref name=Irving/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ordway&gt;

{{cite book |last=Ordway |first=Frederick I, III|authorlink= |author2=Sharpe, Mitchell R |title=The Rocket Team|series= Apogee Books Space Series 36|year=1979|publisher=Thomas Y. Crowell|location=New York|pages=98,114,295}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Then a year later on 22 April 1943, Bill White and Ron Prescott in RAF [[de Havilland Mosquito]] DZ473 were sent from [[RAF Leuchars|Leuchars]] to photograph damage from Allied bombing at the [[History of Szczecin#In the Third Reich (1933-1945)|Stettin]] railyards: "On leaving Stettin, we left our cameras running all down the north coast of Germany, and when the film was developed, it was found to contain pictures of Peenemünde."  The [[RAF Medmenham|Medmenham]] interpreters studied the elliptical earthworks (originally photographed in May 1942) and noticed an "object" {{convert|25|ft|m}} long projecting from what was thought to be a service building, although it had mysteriously disappeared on the next frame.&lt;ref name=Bowman&gt;

{{cite book |last=Bowman|first=Martin W. |year=1999 |title=Mosquito Photo-Reconnaissance Units of World War 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gx85T-eYPdQC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;sig=U121jgQ9ZHqXpIbCc0tMUhygrUE|publisher=Osprey Publishing, Limited |location= |isbn=978-1-85532-891-4|accessdate=6 October 2008 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 April 1943 a large cloud of steam was photographed near the embankments, which was later identified as coming from a rocket  engine being test fired.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt;{{Rp|433}} [[Duncan Sandys]]' first photographic reconnaissance report on Peenemünde was circulated on 29 April 1943, which identified that the lack of power-station activity (Germany had installed electrostatic dust and smoke removers on the power station near [[Stavenhagen#Subdivisions|Kölpin]]) indicates that "''The circular and elliptical constructions are probably for the testing of explosives and projectiles.  ... In view of the above, it is clear that a heavy long-range rocket is not an immediate threat.''"  Then on 14 May, an "''unusually high level of activity''" was visible at "the Ellipse" on photos from two sorties on 14 May, which was the date the Reich Director of Manpower (Gauleiter [[Fritz Sauckel]]) was a distinguished visitor at a launch.&lt;ref name=Irving/&gt;
The first solid evidence of the existence of a rocket came with a sortie (N/853) on 12 June, when a [[Supermarine Spitfire operational history|Spitfire]] flown by Sqn Ldr Gordon Hughes photographed Peenemünde: one photograph included an object on a railway truck.  [[Reginald Victor Jones]] identified the object on 18 June as "''a whiteish [sic] cylinder about 35 feet long and 5 or so feet in diameter with a blueish nose and fins at the other end...I had found the rocket.''"&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;

{{cite book |last=Jones|first=R.V |authorlink=Reginald Victor Jones|title=Most Secret War:British Scientific Intelligence 1939-1945|year=1979|publisher=Coronet Books (Hodder and Stoughton)|location=London UK|pages=433–435}}&lt;br&gt;
:{{note|2|Note 2}}:  On 13 June, Dr Jones sent a note to Sandys and "''two or three days later an addendum was '''added the report by from''' Sandys' interpreter, saying that '''an object''' was visible on the photograph without any mention that anyone but himself had found it. This experience certainly confirmed my impression that my help was being avoided.''"{{Rp|435}}{{Verify source|Pages 434 &amp; 435 do not appear to have this info or the "I had found the rocket" statement for 18 June, and "added the report by from" appears to be spelled incorrectly|date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|434}}
After [[Operation Hydra (1943)|Operation Hydra]] bombed other areas of [[Peenemünde]] in 1943, the P-7 blockhouse roof was reinforced, and in a [[Bombing of Peenemünde in World War II#1944 Bombings|1944 raid]], the blockhouse occupants suffered one injury when a periscope fell.&lt;ref name=Huzel/&gt;{{Rp|105,115}}  (Hermann Weidner's Test Stand 8 was lost in the 1944 July and August raids).&lt;ref name=Ordway/&gt;{{Rp|98}}

The last V-2 launch at Peenemünde was in February 1945, and on 5 May 1945, the [[2nd Belorussian Front]] under General [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]] captured the port of [[Świnoujście|Swinemünde]] and the [[Usedom]] island.  Russian infantry under Major Anatole Vavilov stormed Peenemünde and found it "75 per cent wreckage" (the research buildings and test stands had been demolished.)&lt;ref name=Ley&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6761">This is an alphabetical list of useful timber trees, indigenous (cultivated and natural) and exotic, growing in the [[Gauteng]] area of [[South Africa]]. These trees range in size up to some 1.5m [[Diameter at breast height|DBH]], such as ''Cedrus deodara'', the Himalayan Cedar. Hobbyists will seek out even small pieces of highly valued timber, such as ''Buxus macowanii'', the South African counterpart of ''[[Buxus sempervirens]]'', for [[turnery]] or the making of boxes and small items. Despite the wealth of useful woods available in Gauteng, most of the trees, felled or fallen, are dumped or cut into short lengths for fuel. Trees grown in urban or suburban environments are rarely pruned and are consequently often knotty. Timber frequently holds nails, wire and spikes, attesting to a variety of abuse during the lifetime of a tree, and requiring the use of a metal detector by the sawmiller. Garden cuttings are piled below trees and burnt, leaving charred scars and inclusions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2546">The '''unidentified infrared emission''' (UIR or UIE) bands are [[infrared]] discrete emissions from circumstellar regions, interstellar media, star-forming regions and extragalactic objects for which the identity of the emitting materials is unknown. The main infrared features occur around 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.2, and 12.7 μm, although there are many other weak emission features within the ~ 5–18 μm spectral range. In the 1980s, astronomers discovered that the origin of the UIR emission bands is inherent in compounds made of [[Aromaticity|aromatic]] C–H and C=C chemical bonds, and hypothesized that the materials responsible should be [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]] (PAH) molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal|bibcode=1984A&amp;A...137L...5L|title=Identification of the 'unidentified' IR emission features of interstellar dust?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal| title=Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and the unidentified infrared emission bands - Auto exhaust along the Milky Way| bibcode=1985ApJ...290L..25A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal| title=Interstellar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons - The infrared emission bands, the excitation/emission mechanism, and the astrophysical implications| bibcode=1989ApJS...71..733A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, data recorded with the ESA's [[Infrared Space Observatory]] and NASA's [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] have suggested that the UIR emission bands arise from compounds that are far more complex in composition and structure than PAH molecules. Moreover, the UIR bands follow a clear evolutionary spectral trend that is linked to the lifespan of the astronomical source; from the time the UIR bands first appear around evolved stars in the [[protoplanetary nebula]] stage to evolved stages such as the [[planetary nebula]] phase.&lt;ref name=CBS-origin /&gt;

The UIR emission phenomenon has been studied for approximately 30 years.&lt;ref name=CBS-origin&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-205_162-20126579/new-clues-to-the-origin-of-creation/ |title=New clues to the origin of creation |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=2011-10-27 |accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The object was discovered using information from [[NASA]]'s [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer|WISE]] (Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer) and the [[2MASS]] (Two Micron All-Sky Survey). Researchers inferred the young age for WISEA 1147 because it is a member of a group of stars that is only 10 million years old, and they  estimated its mass using evolutionary models for brown dwarf cooling.
