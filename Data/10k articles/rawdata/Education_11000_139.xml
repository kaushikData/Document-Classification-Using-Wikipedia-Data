'''Block scheduling''' or blocking is a type of academic scheduling used in schools in the American [[K-12|K-12 system]], in which each [[pupil]] has fewer classes per day. It is more common in middle and high schools than in primary schools.  Each class is scheduled for a longer period of time than normal (e.g. 90 minutes instead of 50). In one form of block scheduling, a single class will meet every day for a number of days, after which another class will take its place. In another form, daily classes rotate through a changing daily cycle.&lt;ref name="Tai"/&gt;

Blocks offer more concentrated experiences of subjects, with fewer, usually half as many if going through a schedule transfer, classes daily.

==Description==
Under a traditional American schedule, pupils in a [[High school (North America)|high school]] will study seven subjects a day for 45 minutes for each day of the week for a [[semester]]. There will be two semesters in the year so 14 subjects could be studied. Some pupils will not study all seven subjects. There was great variety as each school board was free to decide the requirement.&lt;ref name="Owl"&gt;{{cite web|last1=H|first1=Natasha|title=What Is High School Block Scheduling?

Conversion to block scheduling became a relatively widespread trend in the 1990s for middle schools and high schools in the [[United States]].  Prior to that, many schools scheduled classes such that a student saw every one of their teachers each day. Classes were approximately 40–60 minutes long, but under block scheduling, they became approximately 90 minutes long.

==Schedules==
Many forms of block scheduling were devised. &lt;ref name="Owl"/&gt;
=== A/B Block Scheduling ===
One variety of block scheduling, called A/B block scheduling, is shown in the example table.  Instead of taking six classes every day, students attend three classes every other day and spend double the amount of continuous time in each class. Students can take 4 classes during one semester and another 4 the next. The example given reverts to a six-period day on Fridays.

=== 4x4 Block Scheduling ===
A method called 4×4 block scheduling splits the academic year into quarters, and uses a four-period day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internet-high.com/4x4/may93.zip|title=Organizing a World Class High School|author=Clarence M. Edwards|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815000000/http://www.internet-high.com/4x4/may93.zip|archivedate=August 15, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This leaves eight slots available for classes during a semester (four classes in each of two quarters).  The 4×4 method is somewhat more flexible in that students can take two sequential classes (such as Algebra 1 and 2) in the same semester (in different quarters), which would not be possible on a traditional schedule. This also allows students in their final year to fail a third-quarter class but repeat it in the fourth quarter in order to graduate.

=== 2 Core 2 Electives ===
Another common block system exists in which students spend up to 100 minutes per class, and earn four credits each semester. Excluding very rare occasions, students at    schools using this system take two core classes and two electives per semester.  Some schools modify this system further to use one of the mid-day periods for students to take optional year-long classes (usually band) that take half of the period length and take another year-long class during the rest of the period (such as math or journalism).  Under such a system most of the classes taken on a year-long basis have all students participating, however it is not uncommon for journalism or yearbook classes to operate under the normal system and only have a few students who leave or arrive halfway through the period. It is also not uncommon for these classes to be scheduled as two credits, and taken both semesters.

===Waldorf blocking===
[[Waldorf schools]] traditionally employ a mixed approach. Certain academic subjects are taught in intensive three to five week blocks known as ''main lesson blocks'', while other subjects are taught in regularly meeting skills classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trostli|first=Robert|title=Main lesson block teaching in the Waldorf School|journal=Research Bulletin of the Research Institute for Waldorf Education|date=January 2001|volume=6|issue=1|url=http://www.waldorflibrary.org/Journal_Articles/RB6107.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105011709/http://www.waldorflibrary.org/Journal_Articles/RB6107.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colleges and Universities==
Within the context of post K-12 establishments, such as in [[medical school]] or other intensive university program, a '''block schedule''' may mean taking one class at a time, all day, every day, until all of the material is covered.  A normal university course might then be completed in three or four weeks of focused effort on a single topic.  This is sometimes called "One Course At A Time" ("OCAAT") (see [[Colorado College]] and [[Cornell College]]).  When used as a supplement change instead of the normal schedule, this approach is sometimes called a ''mini-mester''.

== Effectiveness ==
"Where we were able to combine data to produce summary effect sizes, we found that 4 x 4 block scheduling resulted in higher cross subject achievement than traditional schedules. However, the outcome average cross-subject achievement could conceal worsening performance in some subjects and better performance in others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Block Schedules and Student Performance on AP® Examinations|publisher=The College Board|date=May 1998|url=http://professionals.collegeboard.com/profdownload/pdf/block_schedules_10409.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727133107/http://professionals.collegeboard.com/profdownload/pdf/block_schedules_10409.pdf|archivedate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some schools have compensated for this by making AP courses last for the entire school year, providing essentially double the instruction time of normal classes, but this results in a dramatic reduction in the number of courses a student can take. Some schools that make AP courses year long offset this by having students always choose a pair of AP courses during class registration. The student will go to the first AP class one day, and the other AP course the next day. Therefore, the student takes the same number of courses as other students, but both AP classes last for the duration of the year.

A systematic review on Block Scheduling was also conducted by Dickson et al. (2010) at the EPPI-Centre which asserts that there is no conclusive evidence to support the introduction of policy guidance on the use of block scheduling in secondary schools in the UK. Although the findings do not indicate that participating in block schedules would produce negative outcomes for pupils across subjects, neither are the positive effects of block scheduling strong enough to recommend their implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx?tabid=2476|title=What is the effect of block scheduling on academic achievement? A systematic review|work=EPPI-Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some critics believe that certain subjects suffer from a lack of daily exposure to subject matter and practice that occurs with an A/B block schedule. Courses like mathematics, foreign languages, and music may benefit from daily practice and suffer from a lack thereof.&lt;ref name="Lindsay" /&gt;
Block scheduling can result in gaps of a day or days (or even weeks or months in some circumstances) where students are receiving no reinforcement of instruction in a specific subject like math or history, and critics say this results in retention problems and the need for more remedial review.&lt;ref name="Lindsay"&gt;[http://www.jefflindsay.com/Block3.shtml "The Case Against Block Scheduling"] by [[Jeff Lindsay (engineer)|Jeff Lindsay]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some observers similarly feel that summer vacation has a similar effect of interrupting the learning and retention process forcing a need to repeat material at the start of a new school year in the Fall.

A [[University of Virginia]] study of 8,000 college students found that students who had block scheduling in [[high school]] performed worse in university science courses.&lt;ref name="Tai"&gt;[http://www.virginia.edu/insideuva/2006/08/block_scheduling.html "Block scheduling: Not helping high school students perform better in college science"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123143800/http://www.virginia.edu/insideuva/2006/08/block_scheduling.html |date=January 23, 2008 }} by [[Robert Tai]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Students who miss a block-scheduled day can miss a considerable amount of material in a single subject, possibly making it more difficult to catch up. One way this can be mitigated is by making course material available online, which allows students to catch up outside of school, and another way is by using a [[flipped classroom]] system.

Some students are better able to manage their time with nightly homework in every class, while other students do better with larger homework assignments that are spaced out over several days. Some subjects may benefit from daily drills while other subjects may lend themselves to less frequent homework projects.  Mid-term transfers between schools with different schedules can be problematic in cases where the schedules are different.&lt;ref name="Lindsay" /&gt;

'''Child development in Africa''' addresses the variables and social changes that occur in African children from [[Infant|infancy]] through [[adolescence]]. Three complementary lines of scholarship have sought to generate knowledge about child development in Africa, specifically rooted in endogenous, African ways of knowing: analysis of traditional [[proverb]]s, theory-building, and documentation of parental ethno-theories. The  first approach has examined the indigenous formulations of [[child development]] and socialisation values embedded in [[Languages of Africa|African languages]] and [[oral tradition]]s. Several collections of proverbs have been published in different African languages,&lt;ref&gt;Milimo, J. T. 1972. Bantu Wisdom. Lusaka, NECZAM.&lt;/ref&gt; and their content has been analysed to show the recurrence of the themes of shared communal responsibility for children’s moral guidance and the importance of providing it early in life.&lt;ref&gt;Abubakar, A. 2011. Proverbs as sources of philosophical ideas about African education. In Nsamenang, A. B. and Tchombe, T. M. (eds). ''Handbook of African Educational Theories and Practices: a Generative Teacher Education''. Yaounde, Cameroun, Presses universitaires d’Afrique.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002335/233558E.pdf|title=Investing against Evidence: The Global State of Early Childhood Care and Education|last=Marope|first=P.T.M.|last2=Kaga|first2=Y.|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100113-0|location=|pages=231–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nsamenang's view ==
The African social [[ontogeny]] proposed by Nsamenang&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Nsamenang, A. B. 1992. ''Human Development in Cultural Context''. Newbury Park, CA, Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; is phrased within an eco-cultural perspective, and draws from writings by African scholars in philosophy and the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;Mbiti, J. S. 1969. ''African Religions and Philosophy''. Oxford, Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moumouni, A. 1968. ''Education in Africa''. New York, Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory explains a worldview shared among various ethnic groups, and is grounded in systematic observational research and personal experience of the socialisation practices of the rural [[Nso people|Nso]] people of [[Cameroon]].&lt;ref&gt;Nsamenang, A. B. and Lamb, M. E. 1995.  e force of beliefs: How the parental values of the Nso of Northwest Cameroon shape children’s progress towards adult models. ''Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology'', 16, pp. 613-627.&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of social selfhood takes place in seven phases, each characterized by a developmental task. In the first phase, the naming ceremony projects the kind of socialized being the [[neonate]] should become. The major task of this phase is success in social priming: babies are cuddled and teased to smile along with adults; parents and other caregivers offer food items and playthings, and lure them verbally and nonverbally to return the ‘gifts’ – a prelude towards induction into the ‘sharing and exchange norms’ that bond the social system. Rabain&lt;ref&gt;Rabain, J. 1979. ''L’Enfant du lignage''. Paris, Payot.&lt;/ref&gt; and Mtonga&lt;ref name="Mtonga, M 2012"&gt;Mtonga, M. 2012. ''Children’s Games and Plays in Zambia''. Lusaka, UNZA Press.&lt;/ref&gt; describe similar infant teasing practices among the [[Wolof people|Wolof]] of [[Senegal]] and among the [[Chewa people|Chewa]] and [[Tumbuka people|Tumbuka]] of [[Zambia]]. Such interactions are believed to cultivate generosity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The second phase, ‘social apprenticing’, roughly corresponds with childhood. Its principal task is to recognize and rehearse social roles that pertain to four hierarchical spheres of life: self, household, network, and public. Adults assign responsibility to preadolescent and adolescent children including the care and socialization of younger children which serves the function of priming the emergence of social responsibility. The priming strategies embedded in indigenous African childcare practices have important implications for the design of culturally appropriate forms of intervention to optimize developmental opportunities for children. In many African communities, far from a form of exploitation, caregiving responsibilities assigned to preadolescents and adolescents are part of ‘an indigenous educational strategy that keeps children in contact with existential realities and the activities of daily life [that] represents the participatory component of social integration’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A case study in Zambia found that this strategy was successfully integrated into a service-learning programme at a primary school that promoted social responsibility among both girls and boys and generated improved academic performance.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Serpell, R. 2008. Participatory appropriation and the cultivation of nurturance: a case study of African primary health science curriculum development. In Dasenm P. R., and Akkari, A. (eds). ''Educational Theories and Practices from the Majority World''. New Delhi, India, Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The generalisability of Nsamenang’s ‘West African’ theory across the many different societies in sub-Saharan Africa is debatable. For instance, there are mother-infant interactions among the [[Gusii people|Gusii]] of rural [[Kenya]] in the 1950s and 1970s that stands in marked contrast to Nsamenang’s description of social priming through cuddling and teasing.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;LeVine, R. A., Levine, S., Dixon, S., Richman, A., Leiderman, P. H., Keefer, C. H. and Brazelton, T. B. 1994. ''Childcare and Culture: Lessons from Africa''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Gusii mothers, ‘are not expected to talk to or gaze at their infants or play with them’,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and they explain how this (strange to Western eyes) emotional detachment is compatible with healthy emotional development in later life. Part of their explanation is that the infants receive playful stimulation and emotional support from their elder siblings and other child caregivers. The contrast between these ethnographic accounts serves as a warning that wide variations occur across different ethnocultural groups within the African region,&lt;ref&gt;DeLoache, J. and Gottlieb, A. 2000. ''A World of Babies: Imagined Childcare Guides for Seven Societies''. Cambridge. MA, USA, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and that further detailed research on socialization practices is needed.&lt;ref&gt;Marfo, K., Pence, A. R., LeVine, R. A. and LeVine, S. 2011. Introduction to the special section: Strengthening Africa’s contributions to child development research. ''Child Development Perspectives'', 5 (2), pp. 104-111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== African games and songs ==
Another significant feature of the developmental niche described by many researchers on African early childhood is the prominence of elaborate play activities, unsupervised by adults. Marfo and Biersteker&lt;ref&gt;Marfo, K. and Biersteker, L. 2011. Exploring culture, play and early childhood education practice in African contexts. In Rogers, S. (ed.) ''Rethinking Play and Pedagogy in Early Childhood Education''. New York, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; note that while major Western psychological theories attribute to play an important role in child development, this is mainly focused on cognition, whereas anthropological studies in Africa&lt;ref&gt;Fortes, M. 1970. ''Time and Social Structure, and Other Essays''. London, Athlone Press, New York,Humanities Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwartzman, H. B. 1978. ''Transformation: the Anthropology of Children’s Play''. New York, Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lancy, D. 1996. ''Playing on the Mother Ground: Cultural Routines for Children’s Development''. New York, Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; have emphasised that play also serves as an interactive process of social enculturation, structuring opportunities for the rehearsal, critique and appropriation of cultural practices. The cognitive and social structure of African games has been extensively documented. Music and dance are notably rich dimensions of most African cultures and children participate in both from an early age. Mtonga&lt;ref name="Mtonga, M 2012"/&gt; analysed the texts of Chewa and Tumbuka children’s songs and games observed in rural and urban areas of Zambia, highlighting how they reveal ‘reasoning and understanding the psychology of other participants’, and ‘playful and skilful manipulation of certain word-sounds in order to distort meaning, create new concepts, or paint a satirical caricature...’. He also notes that children’s play in these communities is generally inclusive of multiple age groups and of children with physical handicaps.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Yet indigenous games are seldom deployed as resources for enrichment in [[Early childhood education|early childhood care and education]] (ECCE) programmes in Africa, despite the heavy emphasis on play in the curricula imported from Western preschool orthodoxy. Okwany, Ngutuku and Muhangi&lt;ref&gt;Okwany, A., Ngutuku, E. and Muhangi, A. 2011. ''The Role of Knowledge and Culture in Childcare in Africa: a Sociological Study of Several Ethnic Groups in Kenya and Uganda''. Lewiston, New York, USA, Edwin Mellen Press.&lt;/ref&gt; describe a number of recent initiatives in Kenya and [[Uganda]] where a systematic attempt was made to ‘leverage indigenous knowledge for child care’, by deploying local traditional songs, proverbs, and food production, preparation and preservation practices as resources for the enrichment of children’s intellectual, emotional and nutritional development, rather than ‘downgrading’ them in favour of those imported from the West. Unfortunately, as Hyde and Kabiru&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, K. A. L. and Kabiru, M. N. 2006. ''Early Childhood Development as an Important Strategy to Improve Learning Outcomes''. ADEA (Association for the Development of Education in Africa), Working Group on Early Childhood Development). &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.adeanet.org&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; note, such efforts are relatively rare, and ‘centre-based programmes in Africa tend to be heavily influenced by [[Western culture]] and sometimes are not relevant to the needs of children and society’.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Child-to-Child approach (CtC) ==
Despite robust efforts by African governments over recent decades to broaden access to schooling, the structure of formal educational provision in most countries requires most of those who start out in Grade 1 to ‘[[High school dropouts|drop out]]’ long before completion of the full 12-year curriculum. Thus the process of formal education is perceived by teachers, parents and pupils alike as one in which students are challenged to climb up a narrowing staircase.&lt;ref&gt;Serpell, R. 1999b. ''Local accountability to rural communities: a challenge for educational planning in Africa''. In F. Leach and A. Little (eds). Education, Cultures and Economics: Dilemmas for Development. New York, Garland.&lt;/ref&gt; Dropping out at earlier stages is perceived as failure, and the individual’s return to the community a source of disappointment. The experience of a few years of schooling is not generally perceived as adding value to the individual’s productive capacity within the community. Thus, the purpose of schooling is widely understood as extractive recruitment of the best and brightest individuals out of the community into a higher, powerful, elite social stratum. A number of different ways of focusing education have been proposed in search of alternatives to the narrowing staircase model, including apprenticeship, [[Lifelong learning|life-long learning]], school production units, [[health education]], and the Child-to-Child approach (CtC).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

CtC is designed to mobilise children as agents of health education.&lt;ref&gt;Pridmore, P. and Stephens, D. 2000. ''Children as Partners for Health: A Critical Review of the Child-to-Child approach''. London, UK, ZED Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from the narrowing staircase model by focusing on the promotion of social responsibility in pre-adolescent children, an educational goal that resonates with the Chewa concept of nzelu. The widespread African practice of entrusting preadolescent children with the care of younger siblings was a major inspiration for the original proponents of CtC, which has been applied in more than 80 countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;CtC Trust (n.d.) &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.child-to-child.org&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A case study was conducted of integrative curriculum development by a group of Zambian primary school teachers using the CtC approach.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The insight that pre-adolescent children can take on responsibility as agents of infant care and nurture, within the context of primary health care and progressive social change, was re-appropriated by the African teachers at this school as a way of incorporating traditional cultural practices into the formal educational process. Striking long-term benefits were claimed by the graduates of the school’s CtC curriculum, including a growth of egalitarian relations between the genders, even within adult marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Serpell, R., Mumba, P. and Chansa-Kabali, T. 2011. ''Early educational foundations for the development of civic responsibility: an African experience''. In Flanagan, C. A. and Christens, B. D. (eds), Youth Civic Development: Work at the Cutting Edge. New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development, 134, pp. 77-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Spence received a Bachelor of Education degree from [[York University]], a Master of Education degree from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1993 and a Doctor of Education degree from the University of Toronto's [[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="tdsb.on.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spec"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/oise/About_OISE/In_the_Media.html|title=OISE In the News|publisher=OISE|access-date=January 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became Director of Education for the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board on September 1, 2004, and served until July 2009, when he became the Director of Education for the Toronto District School Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/making-every-head-count/article1276775/ |title=Making every head count|last=Gee |first=Marcus |date=2009-09-04 |newspaper=Globe and Mail |access-date=September 6, 2009 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 9, 2013, Spence apologized for plagiarizing several passages in an op-ed piece he wrote for the ''Toronto Star'' on extracurricular activities. The plagiarism was verified by the ''Star'''s [[public editor]]. Among the plagiarized material was this paragraph lifted from a 1989 opinion piece in the ''New York Times'': "We are challenged through sport to use our minds in guiding our bodies through the dimensions of time and space on the field of play. Learning the skills of sport provides opportunity to experience success."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.thestar.com/living/parent/article/1312380--toronto-school-board-director-admits-plagiarism-in-star-article | title=Toronto school board director admits plagiarism in Star article | publisher=''Toronto Star'' | date=January 9, 2013 | accessdate=January 11, 2013 | author=Rushowy, Kristin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/19/sports/l-an-open-letter-to-president-bush-756789.html | title=An Open Letter to President Bush | publisher=''New York Times'' | date=February 19, 1989 | accessdate=January 11, 2013 | author=Defrantz, Anita L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 10, 2013, Spence tendered his resignation as director effective immediately after additional incidents of plagiarism in earlier articles and blog entries were uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2013/01/10/toronto-plagiarism-chris-spence-school326.html|title=Toronto school board head resigns, plagiarism allegations grow| work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passages of his 1996 Ed.D. dissertation were also revealed to have been copied from other sources without attribution;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TDSB director resigns over plagiarism, PhD dissertation includes unattributed passages|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/tdsb-director-resigns-over-plagiarism-phd-dissertation-includes-unattributed-passages/article7167752/|accessdate=January 10, 2013|newspaper=Globe and Mail|date=January 10, 2013|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of Toronto]] is investigating the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U of T checking Chris Spence's dissertation for plagiarism|url=https://www.thestar.com/living/parent/article/1313707--u-of-t-reviewing-chris-spence-s-dissertation-for-plagiarism|access-date=February 11, 2013|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 20, 2016, the [[Ontario College of Teachers]] announced that Spence's teaching license had been revoked as a result of the findings of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/12/19/chris-spence-former-tdsb-education-director-stripped-of-teaching-licence.html|title=Chris Spence, former TDSB education director, stripped of teaching licence|first=Alicja|last=Siekierska|date=December 19, 2016|publisher=|access-date=January 1, 2018|via=Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His Doctor of Education has been recommended to be revoked by an independent tribunal due to 67 counts of plagiarism in his dissertation.&lt;ref name="Tribunal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/yourtoronto/education/2017/06/20/tribunal-recommends-chris-spence-be-stripped-of-doctorate.html|title=Tribunal recommends Chris Spence be stripped of doctorate|first=Andrea|last=Gordon|date=June 20, 2017|publisher=|access-date=January 1, 2018|via=Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 20, 2017, an independent tribunal at the [[University of Toronto]] recommended that Chris Spence be stripped of his Doctor of Education degree and that he be expelled from the university based on 67 instances of plagiarism in his 1996 doctorate dissertation that show a clear intention to plagiarize such as paragraph after paragraph and page after page of plagiarism that was edited from American to Canadian spelling and edited to appear as his own opinion.&lt;ref name="Tribunal"/&gt;

In 2018, Spence lost his fight to keep his PhD. The appeals tribunal stated that the "nature and extent [of plagiarism] found in Spence's thesis is a very serious offence." The matter, however is not settled. His lawyer, Darryl Singer, wrote in an email that Spence intends to seek judicial review of the decision in Ontario divisional court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/02/07/chris-spence-loses-appeal-to-keep-phd-amid-plagiarism-findings.html|title=Chris Spence loses appeal to keep PhD amid plagiarism findings|last=Gordon|first=Andrea|date=2018-02-07|work=The Toronto Star|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en-CA|issn=0319-0781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2012 through until the present time (2018), Chris Spence has repeatedly claimed to the Ontario College of Teachers as well as to the University of Toronto, that he has been battling with mental health issues such as depressive episodes and anxiety attacks. This can be substantiated from the various articles already referenced on this page, however not by googling "Chris Spence" and "anxiety attacks" or "depression" or "mental health" for more news articles referencing these claims.

He is the author of ''Skin I'm in: Racism, Sports and Education'' (Fernwood Publishing Company, 2000, {{ISBN|978-1-55266-017-1}}) and ''On Time! On Task! On a Mission!''

'''Constructivism''' is a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] viewpoint about the nature of [[knowledge]]. Specifically, it represents an [[Ontology|ontological]] stance.

There are many flavors of constructivism, but one prominent theorist is [[Jean Piaget]], who focused on how humans make meaning in relation to the interaction between their [[Experience|experiences]] and their [[Idea|ideas]]. He considered himself to be a [[Genetic epistemology|genetic epistemologist]], meaning he was interested in the genesis of knowledge. His views tended to focus on human development in relation to what is occurring with an [[individual]] as distinct from development influenced by other persons.&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, J., ''Psychology and Epistemology: Towards a Theory of Knowledge'' (New York: Grossman, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

Views more focused on human development in the context of the social world include the [[Sociocultural perspective|sociocultural]] or socio-historical perspective of [[Lev Vygotsky]] and the [[situated cognition]] perspectives of [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Jean Lave]] and [[Etienne Wenger]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation|last1=Lave|first1=Jean|last2=Wenger|first2=Etienne|date=27 September 1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42374-8}}{{Page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown, Collins and Duguid;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=J.S.|last2=Collins|first2=A.|last3=Duguid|first3=P.|date=|year=1989|title=Situated cognition and the culture of learning|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA204690|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=18|issue=1|pages=32–42|doi=10.3102/0013189x018001032|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newman, Griffin and Cole,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Construction Zone: Working for Cognitive Change in School|last1=Newman|first1=Denis|last2=Griffin|first2=Peg|last3=Cole|first3=Michael|date=28 April 1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-38942-6}}{{Page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Barbara Rogoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Apprenticeship in thinking: cognitive development in social context|last=Rogoff|first=Barbara|date=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press}}{{Page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[concept]] of constructivism has influenced a number of disciplines, including [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[education]] and the [[history of science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=Fallible or Inerrant?  A Belated review of the "Constructivist Bible"|journal=British Journal for the History of Science|date=2004|volume=37|pages=93–8 | doi = 10.1017/s0007087403005338 |url=https://www.academia.edu/3426767/Fallible_or_Inerrant_On_the_Constructivists_Bible_British_Journal_for_the_History_of_Science_37_2004_93-98}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its infancy, constructivism examined the interaction between human experiences and their reflexes or behavior-patterns. Piaget called these systems of knowledge "schemes."

Schemes are not to be confused with [[Schema (psychology)|''schema'']], a term that comes from [[Schema (psychology)|schema theory]], which is from [[Information processing|information-processing]] perspectives on human [[cognition]]. Whereas Piaget's schemes are content-free, schemata (the plural of schema) are [[Concept|concepts]]; for example, most humans have a schema for "[[Grandparent|grandmother]]", "[[egg]]", or "[[magnet]]."

Constructivism does not refer to a specific [[pedagogy]], although it is often confused with [[Constructionist learning|constructionism]], an [[Educational sciences|educational theory]] developed by [[Seymour Papert]], inspired by constructivist and [[experiential learning]] ideas of Piaget.

Piaget's theory of constructivist learning has had wide-ranging impact on [[learning theory (education)|learning theories]] and [[teaching method]]s in education, and is an underlying theme of [[education reform]] movements.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Research support for constructivist teaching techniques has been mixed, with some studies in support and others contradicting constructivist results.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==History==
{{Further|constructivist epistemology}}
Earlier [[educational philosophies]] did not place much value on what would become constructivist ideas; children's [[Play (activity)|play]] and [[exploration]] were seen as aimless and of little importance.{{Citation needed |date=November 2016}}  Jean Piaget did not agree with these traditional views; he saw play as an important and necessary part of the student's [[cognitive development]] and provided [[scientific evidence]] for his views. Today, constructivist theories are influential throughout the formal and informal learning sectors. In [[museum education]], constructivist theories inform [[exhibit design]]. One good example of constructivist learning in a non-formal setting is the Investigate Centre at [[Natural History Museum, London|The Natural History Museum, London]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Here visitors are encouraged to explore a collection of real [[natural history]] specimens, to practice some scientific skills and make discoveries for themselves.  Writers who influenced constructivism include:
*[[John Dewey]] (1859–1952)
*[[Maria Montessori]] (1870–1952)
*[[Władysław Strzemiński]] (1893–1952)
*[[Jean Piaget]] (1896–1980)
*[[Lev Vygotsky]] (1896–1934)
*[[Heinz von Foerster]] (1911–2002)
*[[George Kelly (psychologist)|George Kelly]] (1905–1967)
*[[Jerome Bruner]] (1915–2016)
*[[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] (1916–2001)
*[[Paul Watzlawick]] (1921–2007)
*[[Ernst von Glasersfeld]] (1917–2010)
*[[Edgar Morin]] (* 1921)
*[[Humberto Maturana]] (* 1928)

==Individual==

The formalization of constructivism from a within-the-human perspective is generally attributed to Jean Piaget, who articulated mechanisms by which [[information]] from the environment and ideas from the individual interact and result in internalized structures developed by learners. He identified processes of ''assimilation'' and ''accommodation'' that are key in this interaction as individuals construct new knowledge from their experiences.
 
When individuals ''assimilate'' new information, they incorporate it into an already existing framework without changing that framework. This may occur when individuals' experiences are aligned with their internal representations of the world, but may also occur as a failure to change a faulty understanding; for example, they may not notice events, may misunderstand input from others, or may decide that an event is a fluke and is therefore unimportant as information about the world. In contrast, when individuals' experiences contradict their internal representations, they may change their perceptions of the experiences to fit their internal representations.
 
According to the theory, ''accommodation'' is the process of reframing one's mental representation of the external world to fit new experiences. Accommodation can be understood as the mechanism by which failure leads to learning: when we act on the expectation that the world operates in one way and it violates our expectations, we often fail, but by accommodating this new experience and reframing our model of the way the world works, we learn from the experience of failure, or others' failure.

It is important to note that constructivism is not a particular pedagogy. In fact, constructivism is a theory describing how learning happens, regardless of whether learners are using their experiences to understand a lecture or following the instructions for building a [[Model aircraft|model airplane]]. In both cases, the theory of constructivism suggests that learners construct knowledge out of their experiences.

However, constructivism is often associated with pedagogic approaches that promote [[active learning]], or learning by doing. There are many critics of "learning by doing" (a.k.a. "[[discovery learning]]") as an instructional strategy (e.g. see the criticisms below).&lt;ref name="Kirschner, P.A. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirschner|first=P. A.|last2=Sweller|first2=J.|last3=Clark|first3=R. E.|date=|year=2006|title=Why minimal guidance during instruction does not work: an analysis of the failure of constructivist, discovery, problem-based, experiential, and inquiry-based teaching|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1|journal=[[Educational Psychologist (academic journal)|Educational Psychologist]]|volume=41|issue=2|pages=75–86|doi=10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tobias, S. 2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tobias |first=S. |last2=Duffy |first2=T. M. |year=2009 |title=Constructivist instruction: Success or failure? |location=New York |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=9780415994231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is much enthusiasm for constructivism as a design strategy, according to Tobias and Duffy "... to us it would appear that constructivism remains more of a philosophical framework than a theory that either allows us to precisely describe instruction or prescribe design strategies."&lt;ref name="Tobias, S. 2009"/&gt;{{Rp|4}}

===Constructivist learning intervention===

====The nature of the learner====
[[Social constructivism]] not only acknowledges the [[uniqueness]] and complexity of the learner, but actually encourages, utilizes and rewards it as an integral part of the learning process.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Vygotsky and the social formation of mind|last=Wertsch|first=James V.|date=1997|publisher=Harvard Univ. Press|year=|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=|oclc=489891986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====The importance of the background and culture of the learner=====
Social constructivisms or socioculturalism encourage the learner or learners to arrive at his or her version of the truth, influenced by his or her background, culture or embedded [[worldview]]. Historical developments and symbol systems, such as language, [[logic]], and [[mathematical systems]], are inherited by the learner as a member of a particular culture and these are learned throughout the learner's life. This also stresses the importance of the nature of the learner's [[Social relation|social interaction]] with knowledgeable members of the society. Without the social interaction with other more knowledgeable people, it is impossible to acquire social meaning of important symbol systems and learn how to utilize them. Young children develop their thinking abilities by interacting with other children, adults and the physical world. From the social constructivist viewpoint, it is thus important to take into account the background and culture of the learner throughout the learning process, as this background also helps to shape the knowledge and truth that the learner creates, discovers and attains in the learning process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=====Responsibility for learning=====
Furthermore, it is argued that the responsibility of learning should reside increasingly with the learner. [[Social constructivism]] thus emphasizes the importance of the learner being actively involved in the learning process, unlike previous educational viewpoints where the responsibility rested with the instructor to teach and where the learner played a passive, receptive role. Von Glasersfeld (1989) emphasized that learners construct their own understanding and that they do not simply mirror and reflect what they read. Learners look for meaning and will try to find regularity and order in the events of the world even in the absence of full or complete information.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Constructivism in Science Education|last=Von Glasersfeld|first=Ernst|date=1998|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|year=|isbn=978-0-7923-4924-2|location=|pages=11–30|chapter=Cognition, Construction of Knowledge, and Teaching|chapterurl=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED294754.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====The Harkness discussion method=====
It is called the "Harkness" discussion method because it was developed at [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] with funds donated in the 1930s by [[Edward Harkness]]. This is also named after the Harkness table and involves students seated in a circle, motivating and controlling their own discussion. The teacher acts as little as possible. Perhaps the teacher's only function is to observe, although he/she might begin or shift or even direct a discussion. The students get it rolling, direct it, and focus it. They act as a team, cooperatively, to make it work. They all participate, but not in a competitive way. Rather, they all share in the responsibility and the goals, much as any members share in any team sport. Although the goals of any discussion will change depending upon what's under discussion, some goals will always be the same: to illuminate the subject, to unravel its mysteries, to interpret and share and learn from other points of view, to piece together the puzzle using everyone's contribution. Discussion skills are important. Everyone must be aware of how to get this discussion rolling and keep it rolling and interesting. Just as in any sport, a number of skills are necessary to work on and use at appropriate times. Everyone is expected to contribute by using these skills.

=====The motivation for learning=====
Another crucial assumption regarding the nature of the learner concerns the level and source of [[motivation]] for learning. According to Von Glasersfeld, sustaining motivation to learn is strongly dependent on the learner's [[confidence]] in his or her potential for learning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These feelings of competence and belief in potential to solve new problems, are derived from first-hand experience of mastery of problems in the past and are much more powerful than any external acknowledgment and motivation.&lt;ref name=prawat1994&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prawat|first1=Richard S.|last2=Floden|first2=Robert E.|date=1 January 1994|title=Philosophical perspectives on constructivist views of learning|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Floden/publication/243777968_Philosophical_perspectives_on_constructivist_views_of_learning/links/55cb536408aea2d9bdce2446/Philosophical-perspectives-on-constructivist-views-of-learning.pdf|journal=Educational Psychologist|volume=29|issue=1|pages=37–48|doi=10.1207/s15326985ep2901_4|issn=0046-1520}}&lt;/ref&gt; This links up with [[Vygotsky]]'s "[[zone of proximal development]]" where learners are challenged within close proximity to, yet slightly above, their current level of development. By experiencing the successful completion of challenging tasks, learners gain confidence and motivation to embark on more complex challenges.&lt;ref name=vygotsky1978&gt;{{cite book|title=Mind in Society: Development of Higher Psychological Processes|last1=Vygotsky|first1=L. S.|last2=Cole|first2=Michael|date=1978|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-57629-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The role of the instructor====

=====Instructors as facilitators=====
According to the social constructivist approach, instructors have to adapt to the role of facilitators and not teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Bauersfeld, 1995{{Full citation needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas a teacher gives a [[Didacticism|didactic]] lecture that covers the subject matter, a facilitator helps the learner to get to his or her own understanding of the content. In the former scenario the learner plays a passive role and in the latter scenario the learner plays an active role in the learning process. The emphasis thus turns away from the instructor and the content, and towards the learner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of the Sociology of Education|last1=Gamoran|first1=Adam|last2=Secada|first2=Walter G.|last3=Marrett|first3=Cora B.|date=2000|publisher=Springer, Boston, MA|year=|isbn=978-0-387-32517-0|editor-last=Hallinan|editor-first=M.T.|series=Handbooks of Sociology and Social Research|location=|pages=37–63|chapter=The Organizational Context of Teaching and Learning|chapterurl=http://content.schweitzer-online.de/static/catalog_manager/live/media_files/representation/zd_std_orig__zd_schw_orig/001/428/476/9780387325170_content_pdf_2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dramatic change of role implies that a facilitator needs to display a totally different set of skills than that of a teacher.&lt;ref name=browstein2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brownstein|first=Bonnie|date=22 December 2001|title=Collaboration: the foundation of learning in the future|journal=Education|volume=122|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A teacher tells, a facilitator asks; a teacher lectures from the front, a facilitator supports from the back; a teacher gives answers according to a set curriculum, a facilitator provides guidelines and creates the environment for the learner to arrive at his or her own conclusions; a teacher mostly gives a monologue, a facilitator is in continuous dialogue with the learners.&lt;ref name=rhodes1999&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rhodes|first1=Lynn K.|last2=Bellamy|first2=G. Thomas|date=1 January 1999|title=Choices and Consequences in the Renewal of Teacher Education|journal=Journal of Teacher Education|volume=50|issue=1|pages=17–26|doi=10.1177/002248719905000103|issn=0022-4871}}&lt;/ref&gt; A facilitator should also be able to adapt the learning experience 'in mid-air' by taking the initiative to steer the learning experience to where the learners want to create value.

The learning environment should also be designed to support and challenge the learner's thinking.&lt;ref name=divesta1987&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Foundations of Educational Psychology|last=Di Vesta|first=Francis J.|date=1987|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=978-1-4899-3622-6|series=Perspectives on Individual Differences|location=Boston|pages=203–233|chapter=The Cognitive Movement and Education|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-3620-2_11}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is advocated to give the learner ownership of the problem and solution process, it is not the case that any activity or any solution is adequate. The critical goal is to support the learner in becoming an effective thinker. This can be achieved by assuming multiple roles, such as consultant and coach.

A few strategies for cooperative learning include 
* Reciprocal Questioning: students work together to ask and answer questions
* Jigsaw Classroom: students become "experts" on one part of a group project and teach it to the others in their group
* Structured Controversies: Students work together to research a particular controversy&lt;ref&gt;Woolfolk 2010{{Full citation needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Constructivism====

=====Learning is an active process=====
Social constructivism, strongly influenced by Vygotsky's (1978) work, suggests that knowledge is first constructed in a social context and is then appropriated by individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cognitive Psychology and Instruction|last1=Bruning|first1=Roger H.|last2=Schraw|first2=Gregory J.|last3=Ronning|first3=Royce R.|date=1999|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc|year=|isbn=978-0-13-716606-0|edition=3rd|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to social constructivists, the process of sharing individual perspectives — called ''collaborative elaboration'' — results in learners constructing understanding together that wouldn't be possible alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meter|first1=Peggy Van|last2=Stevens|first2=Robert J.|date=1 January 2000|title=The Role of Theory in the Study of Peer Collaboration|journal=The Journal of Experimental Education|volume=69|issue=1|pages=113–127|doi=10.1080/00220970009600652|issn=0022-0973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greeno|first1=James G|last2=Collins|first2=Allan M|last3=Resnick|first3=Lauren B|date=1996|title=Cognition and learning|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/46366404/GCR.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1517376985&amp;Signature=oYYP%2FGxkZH6kxynAMhltyJb2RKA%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DCognition_and_learning.pdf|journal=Handbook of educational psychology|volume=77|pages=15–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social constructivist scholars view learning as an active process where learners should learn to discover principles, concepts and facts for themselves, hence the importance of encouraging guesswork and [[intuitive thinking]] in learners.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ackerman|first=Phillip L.|date=1 March 1996|title=A theory of adult intellectual development: Process, personality, interests, and knowledge|journal=Intelligence|volume=22|issue=2|pages=227–257|doi=10.1016/S0160-2896(96)90016-1|issn=0160-2896}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, for the social constructivist, reality is not something that we can discover because it does not pre-exist prior to our social invention of it. Kukla (2000) argues that reality is constructed by our own activities and that people, together as members of a society, invent the properties of the world.

Other constructivist scholars agree with this and emphasize that individuals make meanings through the interactions with each other and with the environment they live in. Knowledge is thus a product of humans and is socially and culturally constructed.&lt;ref name=prawat1994 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernest 1991.{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon (1997) agrees that learning is a social process. He further states that learning is not a process that only takes place inside our minds, nor is it a passive development of our behaviors that is shaped by external forces and that meaningful learning occurs when individuals are engaged in social activities.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;McMahon 1997.{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vygotsky (1978) also highlighted the convergence of the social and practical elements in learning by saying that the most significant moment in the course of intellectual development occurs when speech and practical activity, two previously completely independent lines of development, converge. Through practical activity a child constructs meaning on an intra-personal level, while speech connects this meaning with the interpersonal world shared by the child and her/his culture.&lt;ref name=vygotsky1978 /&gt;

=====Good relationship between instructor and learner=====
A further characteristic of the role of the facilitator in the social constructivist viewpoint, is that the instructor and the learners are equally involved in learning from each other as well.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holt|first1=Dan G.|last2=Willard-Holt|first2=Colleen|date=1 November 2000|title=Let's Get Real™: Students Solving Authentic Corporate Problems|journal=Phi Delta Kappan|volume=82|issue=3|pages=243–246|doi=10.1177/003172170008200315|issn=0031-7217}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the learning experience is both subjective and objective and requires that the instructor's culture, values and background become an essential part of the interplay between learners and tasks in the shaping of meaning. Learners compare their version of the truth with that of the instructor and fellow learners to get to a new, socially tested version of truth (Kukla 2000). The task or problem is thus the interface between the instructor and the learner.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This creates a dynamic interaction between task, instructor and learner. This entails that learners and instructors should develop an awareness of each other's viewpoints and then look to their own beliefs, standards and values, thus being both subjective and objective at the same time.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Savery|first=Lawson K.|date=1 June 1994|title=The Influence of the Perceived Styles of Leadership on a Group of Workers on their Attitudes to Work|journal=Leadership &amp; Organization Development Journal|volume=15|issue=4|pages=12–18|doi=10.1108/01437739410059863|issn=0143-7739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies argue for the importance of mentoring in the process of learning.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Archee|first1=Ray|last2=Hill Duin|first2=DA|date=1995|title=The World Wide Web and Distance Education: Congergenece or Cacophony?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZiM77RkNBMC&amp;pg=PA348|conference=AUUG Conference Proceedings|publisher=AUUG, Inc.|volume=|pages=348–356|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social constructivist model thus emphasizes the importance of the relationship between the student and the instructor in the learning process.

Some learning approaches that could harbour this interactive learning include reciprocal teaching, peer collaboration, [[cognitive apprenticeship]], problem-based instruction, web quests, [[Anchored Instruction]] and other approaches that involve learning with others.

====Collaboration among learners====
{{main|Learning by teaching}}
Learners with different skills and backgrounds should collaborate in tasks and discussions to arrive at a shared understanding of the truth in a specific field.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite book|title=Constructivism and the Technology of Instruction: A Conversation|date=1992|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|isbn=978-0-8058-1272-5|editor-last=Duffy|editor-first=Thomas|location=Hillsdale, New Jersey|editor-last2=Jonassen|editor-first2=}}{{Page needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some social constructivist models also stress the need for collaboration among learners, in direct contradiction to traditional competitive approaches.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; One Vygotskian notion that has significant implications for peer collaboration, is that of the zone of proximal development. Defined as the distance between the actual [[Child development stages|developmental level]] as determined by independent problem-solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem-solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers, it differs from the fixed biological nature of [[Theory of cognitive development|Piaget's stages of development]]. Through a process of 'scaffolding' a learner can be extended beyond the limitations of physical maturation to the extent that the development process lags behind the learning process.&lt;ref name="vygotsky1978" /&gt;

If students have to present and train new contents with their classmates, a non-linear process of collective knowledge-construction will be set up.

=====The importance of context=====
The social constructivist paradigm views the context in which the learning occurs as central to the learning itself.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Underlying the notion of the learner as an active processor is "the assumption that there is no one set of generalised learning laws with each law applying to all domains".&lt;ref name=divesta1987 /&gt;{{rp|208}} [[Contextualism|Decontextualised]] knowledge does not give us the skills to apply our understandings to authentic tasks because we are not working with the concept in the complex environment and experiencing the complex interrelationships in that environment that determine how and when the concept is used.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; One social constructivist notion is that of authentic or [[situated learning]], where the student takes part in activities directly relevant to the application of learning and that take place within a culture similar to the applied setting.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Cognitive apprenticeship has been proposed as an effective constructivist model of learning that attempts to "enculturate students into authentic practices through activity and social interaction in a way similar to that evident, and evidently successful, in craft apprenticeship".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|25}}

Holt and Willard-Holt (2000) emphasize the concept of dynamic assessment, which is a way of assessing the true potential of learners that differs significantly from conventional tests. Here the essentially interactive nature of learning is extended to the process of assessment. Rather than viewing assessment as a process carried out by one person, such as an instructor, it is seen as a two-way process involving interaction between both instructor and learner. The role of the assessor becomes one of entering into dialogue with the persons being assessed to find out their current level of performance on any task and sharing with them possible ways in which that performance might be improved on a subsequent occasion. Thus, assessment and learning are seen as inextricably linked and not separate processes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

According to this viewpoint instructors should see assessment as a continuous and interactive process that measures the achievement of the learner, the quality of the learning experience and courseware. The feedback created by the assessment process serves as a direct foundation for further development.

====The selection, scope, and sequencing of the subject matter====

=====Knowledge should be discovered as an integrated whole=====
Knowledge should not be divided into different subjects or compartments, but should be discovered as an [[emergence|integrated whole]].&lt;ref name=divesta1987 /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

This also again underlines the importance of the context in which learning is presented.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The world, in which the learner needs to operate, does not approach one in the form of different subjects, but as a complex myriad of facts, problems, dimensions, and perceptions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=====Engaging and challenging the learner=====
Learners should constantly be challenged with tasks that refer to skills and knowledge just beyond their current level of mastery. This captures their motivation and builds on previous successes to enhance learner confidence.&lt;ref name=browstein2001 /&gt; This is in line with Vygotsky's zone of proximal development, which can be described as the distance between the actual developmental level (as determined by independent problem-solving) and the level of potential development (as determined through problem-solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers).&lt;ref name=vygotsky1978 /&gt;

Vygotsky (1978) further claimed that instruction is good only when it proceeds ahead of development. Then it awakens and rouses to life an entire set of functions in the stage of maturing, which lie in the zone of proximal development. It is in this way that instruction plays an extremely important role in development.&lt;ref name=vygotsky1978 /&gt;

To fully engage and challenge the learner, the task and learning environment should reflect the complexity of the environment that the learner should be able to function in at the end of learning. Learners must not only have ownership of the learning or problem-solving process, but of the problem itself.&lt;ref&gt;Derry 1999.{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the sequencing of subject matter is concerned, it is the constructivist viewpoint that the foundations of any subject may be taught to anybody at any stage in some form.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This means that instructors should first introduce the basic ideas that give life and form to any topic or subject area, and then revisit and build upon these repeatedly. This notion has been extensively used in curricula.

It is  important for instructors to realize that although a curriculum may be set down for them, it inevitably becomes shaped by them into something personal that reflects their own belief systems, their thoughts and feelings about both the content of their instruction and their learners.&lt;ref name=rhodes1999 /&gt; Thus, the learning experience becomes a shared enterprise. The [[emotion]]s and [[life]] contexts of those involved in the learning process must therefore be considered as an integral part of learning. The goal of the learner is central in considering what is learned.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=====The structuredness of the learning process=====
It is important to achieve the right balance between the degree of structure and flexibility that is built into the learning process. Savery (1994) contends that the more structured the learning environment, the harder it is for the learners to construct meaning based on their conceptual understandings. A facilitator should structure the learning experience just enough to make sure that the students get clear guidance and parameters within which to achieve the learning objectives, yet the learning experience should be open and free enough to allow for the learners to discover, enjoy, interact and arrive at their own, socially verified version of truth.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

====In adult learning====
Constructivist ideas have been used to inform [[adult education]]. Current trends in higher education push for more "active learning" teaching approaches which are often based on constructivist views.

Approaches based on constructivism stress the importance of mechanisms for mutual planning, diagnosis of learner needs and interests, cooperative learning climate, sequential activities for achieving the objectives, formulation of learning objectives based on the diagnosed needs and interests. While adult learning often stresses the importance of personal relevance of the content, involvement of the learner in the process, and deeper understanding of underlying concepts, all of these are principles that may benefit learners of all ages as even children connect their every day experiences to what they learn.

==Pedagogies based on constructivism==
{{main|Constructivist teaching methods}}

Various approaches in pedagogy derive from constructivist theory. They usually suggest that learning is accomplished best using a hands-on approach. Learners learn by experimentation, and not by being told what will happen, and are left to make their own [[inference]]s, discoveries and conclusions.

=== Supportive research and evidence===

Hmelo-Silver, Duncan, &amp; Chinn cite several studies supporting the success of the constructivist [[Problem-based learning|problem-based]] and inquiry learning methods. For example, they describe a project called GenScope, an [[Inquiry-based learning|inquiry-based]] science software application. Students using the GenScope software showed significant gains over the control groups, with the largest gains shown in students from basic courses.&lt;ref name="hmelo"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.cogtech.usc.edu/publications/hmelo_ep07.pdf |title=Scaffolding and Achievement in Problem-Based and Inquiry Learning: A Response to Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark (2006) |last=Hmelo-Silver |last2=Duncan |last3=Chinn |year=2007 |journal=Educational Psychologist |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=99–107 |doi=10.1080/00461520701263368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hmelo-Silver et al. also cite a large study by Geier on the effectiveness of inquiry-based science for middle school students, as demonstrated by their performance on high-stakes standardized tests. The improvement was 14% for the first cohort of students and 13% for the second cohort. This study also found that inquiry-based teaching methods greatly reduced the achievement gap for African-American students.&lt;ref name="hmelo" /&gt;

Guthrie et al. (2004) compared three instructional methods for third-grade reading: a traditional approach, a strategies instruction only approach, and an approach with strategies instruction and constructivist motivation techniques including student choices, collaboration, and hands-on activities. The constructivist approach, called CORI (Concept-Oriented Reading Instruction), resulted in better student reading comprehension, cognitive strategies, and motivation.&lt;ref name="Guthrie"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.cori.umd.edu/research/publications/2004-guthrie-wigfield-etal.pdf |title=Increasing Reading Comprehension and Engagement Through Concept-Oriented Reading Instruction |last=Guthrie |year=2004 |journal=[[Journal of Educational Psychology]] |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=403–423 |doi= 10.1037/0022-0663.96.3.403|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jong Suk Kim found that using constructivist teaching methods for 6th graders resulted in better student achievement than traditional teaching methods. This study also found that students preferred constructivist methods over traditional ones. However, Kim did not find any difference in student self-concept or learning strategies between those taught by constructivist or traditional methods.&lt;ref name="kim"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/2a/5a/af.pdf |last=Kim |year=2005 |title=The Effects of a Constructivist Teaching Approach on Student Academic Achievement, Self-Concept, and Learning Strategies |journal=Asia Pacific Education Review |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=7–19 |doi= 10.1007/bf03024963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doğru and Kalender compared science classrooms using traditional teacher-centered approaches to those using student-centered, constructivist methods. In their initial test of student performance immediately following the lessons, they found no significant difference between traditional and constructivist methods. However, in the follow-up assessment 15 days later, students who learned through constructivist methods showed better retention of knowledge than those who learned through traditional methods.&lt;ref name="Doğru"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/2d/77/67.pdf |last=Doğru |last2=Kalender |year=2007 |title=Applying the Subject 'Cell' Through Constructivist Approach during Science Lessons and the Teacher's View |journal=Journal of Environmental &amp; Science Education |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=3–13 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Several cognitive psychologists and educators have questioned the central claims of constructivism.  It is argued that constructivist theories are misleading or contradict known findings.&lt;ref name="Kirschner, P.A. 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Anderson | first1=John R. | last2=Reder | first2=Lynne M. | last3=Simon | first3=Herbert A. | title=Applications and misapplications of cognitive psychology in mathematics education | date=1998 | url=http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/papers/misapplied.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwcsi.unian.it/educa/inglese/matthews.html Constructivism in Science and Mathematics Education], Michael R.

In the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]] it is maintained that learning at any age depends upon the processing and representational resources available at this particular age.  That is, it is maintained that if the requirements of the concept to be understood exceeds the available processing efficiency and [[working memory]] resources then the concept is by definition not learnable. This attitude toward learning impedes the learning from understanding essential theoretical concepts or, in other words, reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Warmaudit31%205.pdf |title=Why We Don't Really Know What "Statistical Significance" Means: A Major Educational Failure* |author1=Raymond Hubbard |author2=J.

If this condition is not met, construction goes astray.&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou, A. (1998). Cognitive development. In A. Demetriou, W. Doise, K. F. M. van Lieshout (Eds.), ''Life-span developmental psychology'' (pp. 179–269). London: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou, A., Shayer, M., &amp; Efklides, A. (1992). ''Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development'': ''Implications and applications to education''. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

Several educators have also questioned the effectiveness of this approach toward instructional design, especially as it applies to the development of instruction for novices&lt;ref name="Kirschner, P.A. 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt; While some constructivists argue that "learning by doing" enhances learning, critics of this instructional strategy argue that little empirical evidence exists to support this statement given novice learners.&lt;ref name= "Kirschner, P.A. 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt; Sweller and his colleagues argue that novices do not possess the underlying mental models, or "schemas" necessary for "learning by doing".&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sweller|first=J|date=June 1988|title=Cognitive load during problem solving: Effects on learning|journal=Cognitive Science|volume=12|issue=2|pages=257–285|doi=10.1016/0364-0213(88)90023-7|issn=0364-0213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Mayer (2004) reviewed the literature and found that fifty years of empirical data do not support using the constructivist teaching technique of pure discovery; in those situations requiring discovery, he argues for the use of guided discovery instead.&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt;

Mayer (2004) argues that not all teaching techniques based on constructivism are efficient or effective for all learners, suggesting many educators misapply constructivism to use teaching techniques that require learners to be behaviorally active. He describes this inappropriate use of constructivism as the "constructivist teaching fallacy". "I refer to this interpretation as the constructivist teaching fallacy because it equates active learning with active teaching."&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt;{{Rp|15}} Instead Mayer proposes learners should be "cognitively active" during learning and that instructors use "guided practice."

In contrast, Kirschner ''et al.'' (2006)&lt;ref name= "Kirschner, P.A. 2006"/&gt; describe constructivist teaching methods as "unguided methods of instruction." They suggest more structured learning activities for learners with little to no prior knowledge. Slezak states that constructivism "is an example of fashionable but thoroughly problematic doctrines that can have little benefit for practical pedagogy or teacher education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slezak|first=Peter|date=2010|title=Radical Constructivism: Epistemology, Education and Dynamite.|journal=Constructivist Foundations|volume=6|issue=1|issn=1782-348X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar views have been stated by Meyer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meyer |first=D. L. |year=2009 |title=The Poverty of Constructivism |journal=Educational Philosophy and Theory |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=332–341 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-5812.2008.00457.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boden, Quale and others.

Kirschner ''et al.'' group a number of learning theories together (Discovery, Problem-Based, Experiential, and Inquiry-Based learning) and stated that highly scaffolded constructivist methods like problem-based learning and inquiry learning are ineffective.&lt;ref name= "Kirschner, P.A. 2006"/&gt; Kirschner ''et al.'' described several research studies that were favorable to problem-based learning given learners were provided some level of guidance and support.&lt;ref name="Kirschner, P.A. 2006" /&gt;

===A rebuttal to the criticisms of Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark===
While there are critics of the Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark&lt;ref name= "Kirschner, P.A. 2006" /&gt; article, Sweller and his associates have written in their articles about:
#instructional designs for producing procedural learning (learning as behavior change);&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
#their grouping of seemingly disparate learning theories&lt;ref name= "Kirschner, P.A. 2006"/&gt; and;
#a continuum of guidance beginning with worked examples that may be followed by practice, or transitioned to practice&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; (Renkl, Atkinson, Maier, and Staley, 2002)

Kirschner ''et al.'' (2006) describe worked examples as an instructional design solution for procedural learning.&lt;ref name="Kirschner, P.A. 2006" /&gt; Clark, Nguyen, and Sweller (2006) describe this as a very effective, empirically validated method of teaching learners procedural skill acquisition. Evidence for learning by studying worked-examples, is known as the [[worked-example effect]] and has been found to be useful in many domains (e.g. music, chess, athletics)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Atkinson |first=R.

Kirschner ''et al.'' (2006)&lt;ref name="Kirschner, P.A. 2006"/&gt; describe why they group a series of seemingly disparate learning theories (Discovery, Problem-Based, Experiential, and Inquiry-Based learning). The reasoning for this grouping is because each learning theory promotes the same constructivist teaching technique—"learning by doing." While they argue "learning by doing" is useful for more knowledgeable learners, they argue this teaching technique is not useful for novices. Mayer states that it promotes behavioral activity too early in the learning process, when learners should be cognitively active.&lt;ref name="Mayer"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/vtt/MayerThreeStrikesAP04.pdf |last=Mayer |year=2004 |title=Should There Be a Three-Strikes Rule Against Pure Discovery Learning? |journal=American Psychologist |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=14–19 |doi= 10.1037/0003-066x.59.1.14 |pmid=14736316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Sweller and his associates describe a continuum of guidance, starting with worked examples to slowly fade guidance. This continuum of faded guidance has been tested empirically to produce a series of learning effects: the worked-example effect,&lt;ref name=sweller1985&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sweller |first=J. |last2=Cooper |first2=G.

===Criticism of discovery-based teaching techniques===
{{quote|After a half century of advocacy associated with instruction using minimal guidance, there appears no body of research supporting the technique. In so far as there is any evidence from controlled studies, it almost uniformly supports direct, strong instructional guidance rather constructivist-based minimal guidance during the instruction of novice to intermediate learners. Even for students with considerable prior knowledge, strong guidance while learning is most often found to be equally effective as unguided approaches. Not only is unguided instruction normally less effective; there is also evidence that it may have negative results when students acquire misconceptions or incomplete or disorganized knowledge|Why Minimal Guidance During Instruction Does Not Work: An Analysis of the Failure of Constructivist, Discovery, Problem-Based, Experiential, and Inquiry-Based Teaching by Kirschner, Sweller, Clark&lt;ref name="Kirschner, P.A. 2006" /&gt;}}

Mayer (2004) argues against discovery-based teaching techniques and provides an extensive review to support this argument. Mayer's arguments are against pure discovery, and are not specifically aimed at constructivism: "Nothing in this article should be construed as arguing against the view of learning as knowledge construction or against using hands-on inquiry or group discussion that promotes the process of knowledge construction in learners. The main conclusion I draw from the three research literatures I have reviewed is that it would be a mistake to interpret the current constructivist view of learning as a rationale for reviving pure discovery as a method of instruction."&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt;

Mayer's concern is how one applies discovery-based teaching techniques. He provides empirical research as evidence that discovery-based teaching techniques are inadequate. Here he cites this literature and makes his point "For example, a recent replication is research showing that students learn to become better at solving mathematics problems when they study worked-out examples rather than when they solely engage in hands-on problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Instructional Design in Technical Areas|last=Sweller|first=John|date=1999|publisher=ACER Press|isbn=978-0-86431-312-6|series=Australian education review|location=Camberwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today's proponents of discovery methods, who claim to draw their support from constructivist philosophy, are making inroads into educational practice. Yet a dispassionate review of the relevant research literature shows that discovery-based practice is not as effective as guided discovery."&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt;{{Rp|18}}

Mayer's point is that people often misuse constructivism to promote pure discovery-based teaching techniques. He proposes that the instructional design recommendations of constructivism are too often aimed at discovery-based practice.&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt; Sweller (1988) found evidence that practice by novices during early schema acquisition, distracts these learners with unnecessary search-based activity, when the learner's attention should be focused on understanding (acquiring schemas).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The study by Kirschner et al. from which the quote at the beginning of this section was taken has been widely cited and is important for showing the limits of minimally-guided instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Nilson | first = Linda Burzotta | title = Teaching at Its Best: A Research-Based Resource for College Instructors | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | year = 2010 | location = San Francisco | pages = 176 | isbn = 9780470401040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hmelo-Silver et al. responded,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hmelo-Silver | first = Cindy E. |author2=Ravit Golan Duncan |author3=Clark A. Chinn  | title = Scaffolding and Achievement in Problem-Based and Inquiry Learning: A Response to Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark (2006) | journal = Educational Psychologist | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 99–107 | year = 2007 | doi=10.1080/00461520701263368}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out that Kirschner et al. conflated constructivist teaching techniques such as inquiry learning with "discovery learning". (See the preceding two [[Constructivism (learning theory)#Criticisms of Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark|sections]] of this article.) This would agree with Mayer's viewpoint that even though constructivism as a theory and teaching techniques incorporating guidance are likely valid applications of this theory, nevertheless a tradition of misunderstanding  has led to some question "pure discovery" techniques.

===The math wars and discovery-based teaching techniques===
{{main|Math Wars}}
The [[math wars]] controversy in the United States is an example of the type of heated debate that sometimes follows the implementation of constructivist-inspired curricula in schools. In the 1990s, mathematics textbooks based on new [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics#1989 Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics|standards]] largely informed by constructivism were developed and promoted with government support. Although constructivist theory does not require eliminating instruction entirely, some textbooks seemed to recommend this extreme. Some parents and mathematicians protested the design of textbooks that omitted or de-emphasized instruction of standard mathematical methods. Supporters responded that the methods were to be eventually discovered under direction by the teacher, but since this was missing or unclear, many insisted the textbooks were designed to deliberately eliminate instruction of standard methods. In one commonly adopted text, the standard formula for the area of a circle is to be derived in the classroom, but not actually printed in the student textbook as is explained by the developers of [[Connected Mathematics|CMP]]: "The student role of formulating, representing, clarifying, communicating, and reflecting on ideas leads to an increase in learning. If the format of the texts included many worked examples, the student role would then become merely reproducing these examples with small modifications."&lt;ref&gt;[http://connectedmath.msu.edu/parents/faq.html#q15 CMP2 Parent Website FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, this approach has been applied to reading with [[whole language]] and inquiry-based science that emphasizes the importance of ''devising'' rather than just performing hands-on experiments as early as the elementary grades (traditionally done by research scientists), rather than studying facts. In other areas of curriculum such as social studies and writing are relying more on "higher order thinking skills" rather than memorization of dates, grammar or spelling rules or reciting correct answers. Advocates of this approach counter that the constructivism does not require going to extremes, that in fact teachable moments should regularly infuse the experience with the more traditional teaching. The primary differentiation from the traditional approach being that the engagement of the students in their learning makes them more receptive to learning things at an appropriate time, rather than on a preset schedule.

===Importance of structure in constructivist learning environments===

During the 1990s, several theorists began to study the [[cognitive load]] of novices (those with little or no prior knowledge of the subject matter) during problem solving. Cognitive load theory was applied in several contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paas|first=Fred G.|date=1992|title=Training strategies for attaining transfer of problem-solving skill in statistics: A cognitive-load approach.|url=|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|volume=84|issue=4|pages=429–434|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.84.4.429|issn=1939-2176|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moreno|first1=Roxana|last2=Mayer|first2=Richard E.|date=1999|title=Cognitive principles of multimedia learning: The role of modality and contiguity.|url=http://visuallearningresearch.wiki.educ.msu.edu/file/view/Moreno%20%26%20Mayer%201999.pdf|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|volume=91|issue=2|pages=358–368|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.91.2.358|issn=0022-0663}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mousavi|first1=Seyed Yaghoub|last2=Low|first2=Renae|last3=Sweller|first3=John|date=1995|title=Reducing cognitive load by mixing auditory and visual presentation modes.|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|volume=87|issue=2|pages=319–334|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.87.2.319|issn=0022-0663}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chandler|first1=Paul|last2=Sweller|first2=John|date=June 1992|title=The split-attention effect as a factor in the design of instruction|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d81d/3e4514b69578aaa769d888adade75355b563.pdf|journal=British Journal of Educational Psychology|volume=62|issue=2|pages=233–246|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8279.1992.tb01017.x|issn=0007-0998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sweller1985 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=Graham|last2=Sweller|first2=John|date=1987|title=Effects of schema acquisition and rule automation on mathematical problem-solving transfer|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|volume=79|issue=4|pages=347–362|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.79.4.347|issn=0022-0663}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the results of their research, these authors do not support the idea of allowing novices to interact with ill-structured learning environments. Ill-structured learning environments rely on the learner to discover problem solutions. Jonassen (1997) also suggested that novices be taught with "well-structured" learning environments.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jonassen|first=David H.|date=March 1997|title=Instructional design models for well-structured and III-structured problem-solving learning outcomes|url=|journal=Educational Technology Research and Development|volume=45|issue=1|pages=65–94|doi=10.1007/BF02299613|issn=1042-1629|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonassen (1997) also proposed well-designed, well-structured learning environments provide scaffolding for problem-solving. Finally both Sweller and Jonassen support problem-solving scenarios for more advanced learners&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luga, Ayres, Chandler, and Sweller, 2003.{{Full citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweller and his associates even suggest well-structured learning environments, like those provided by worked examples, are not effective for those with more experience—this was later described as the "[[expertise reversal effect]]".&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Cognitive load theorists suggest worked examples initially, with a gradual introduction of problem solving scenarios; this is described as the "guidance fading effect"&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychology of Learning and Motivation|last=Sweller|first=J|date=2003|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-543343-3|editor-last=Ross|editor-first=Brian|location=San Diego|chapter=Evolution of human cognitive architecture|chapterurl=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/bookseries/00797421/43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these ideas provides more evidence for Anderson's ACT-R framework.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, R. E. &amp; Elen, J., (2006). When less is more: Research and theory insights about instruction for complex learning. In R. E. Clark &amp; J. Elen (Eds.) Handling Complexity in Learning Environments: Research and Theory. London: Elsevier. 283-295.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[ACT-R]] framework suggests learning can begin with studying examples.

Finally Mayer states: "Thus, the contribution of psychology is to help move educational reform efforts from the fuzzy and unproductive world of educational ideology—which sometimes hides under the banner of various versions of constructivism—to the sharp and productive world of theory-based research on how people learn."&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt;{{Rp|18}}

==Confusion between constructivist and maturationist views==

Many people confuse constructivist with [[maturationist]] views. The constructivist (or cognitive-developmental) stream "is based on the idea that the [[dialectic]] or [[interactionist]] process of development and learning through the student's active construction should be facilitated and promoted by adults".&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite book|title=Developing constructivist early childhood curriculum: practical principles and activities|last=|first=|date=2002|publisher=Teachers College Press|year=|isbn=978-0-8077-4121-4|editor-last=DeVries|editor-first=Rheta|series=Early childhood education series|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas, "The romantic maturationist stream is based on the idea that the student's naturally occurring development should be allowed to flower without adult interventions in a permissive environment."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In other words, adults play an active role in guiding learning in constructivism, while they are expected to allow children to guide themselves in maturationism.

== Radical constructivism ==
[[Ernst von Glasersfeld]] developed [[radical constructivism]] by coupling Piaget's theory of learning and philosophical viewpoint about the nature of knowledge with Kant's rejection of an objective reality independent of human perception or reason.&amp;nbsp;Radical constructivism does not view knowledge as an attempt to generate ideas that match an independent, objective reality.&lt;ref&gt;Glasersfeld, E. v. (1995). Radical constructivism : a way of knowing and learning. London ; Washington, D.C. : Falmer Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, theories and knowledge about the world, as generated by our senses and reason, either fit within the constraints of whatever reality may exist and, thus, are viable or do not and are not viable.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst von Glasersfeld, a. (1990). Chapter 2: An Exposition of Constructivism: Why Some Like It Radical. Journal For Research In Mathematics Education. Monograph, 19. doi:10.2307/749910&lt;/ref&gt;  As a theory of education, radical constructivism emphasizes the experiences of the learner, differences between learners and the importance of uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Gash, H. (2014). Constructing Constructivism. Constructivist Foundations, 9(3), 302-310.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relational constructivism ==

[[Björn Kraus]] [[relational constructivism]] can be perceived as a relational consequence of the radical constructivism. In contrary to social constructivism, it picks up the epistemological threads and maintains the radical constructivist idea that humans cannot overcome their limited conditions of reception. In spite of the subjectivity of human constructions of reality, relational constructivism focusses on the relational conditions applying to human perceptional processes.&lt;ref&gt;See Björn Kraus: ''The Life We Live and the Life We Experience: Introducing the Epistemological Difference between “Lifeworld” (Lebenswelt) and “Life Conditions” (Lebenslage)'' Social Work and Society. International Online Journal. Vol. 13, No. 2 2015, http://www.socwork.net/sws/article/view/438; Björn Kraus: Plädoyer für den Relationalen Konstruktivismus und eine Relationale Soziale Arbeit. in Forum Sozial (2017) 1 pp. 29-35, http://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/51948&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social constructivism ==
In recent decades, constructivist theorists have extended the traditional focus on individual learning to address collaborative and social dimensions of learning. It is possible to see ''[[social constructivism (learning theory)|social constructivism]]'' as a bringing together of aspects of the work of Piaget with that of Bruner and Vygotsky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How Children Think and Learn|last=Wood|first=David|date=1998|publisher=Blackwell|year=|isbn=978-0-631-20007-9|edition=2nd|series=Understanding children's worlds|location=Oxford, UK|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communal constructivism ==
The concept ''Communal constructivism'' was developed by Leask and Younie&lt;ref name="Leask and Younie"&gt;Leask, M., and Younie, S. (2001a) 'Communal Constructivist Theory: pedagogy of information and communications technology &amp; internationalisation of the curriculum', Journal of Information Technology for Teacher Education, Vol. 10, Nos 1 &amp; 2, pp117 –134&lt;/ref&gt; in 1995 through their research on the [[European SchoolNet]]&lt;ref name="Younie and Leask"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Younie | first1 = S. | last2 = Leask | first2 = M. | year = 2001b | title = The European SchoolNet: An online community for European teachers? A valuable professional resource? | url = http://www.editlib.org/p/94352/ | journal = Teacher Development | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 157–172 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which demonstrated the value of experts collaborating to push the boundaries of knowledge  i.e. communal construction of new knowledge between experts rather than social construction of knowledge as described by Vygotsky where there is a learner to teacher scaffolding relationship. "Communal constructivism" as a concept applies to those situations in which there is currently no expert knowledge or indeed research to underpin knowledge in an area. "Communal constructivism" refers specifically to the process of experts working together to create, record and publish new knowledge in emerging areas. In the seminal European SchoolNet research where for the first time academics were testing out how the internet could support classroom practice and pedagogy, experts from a number of countries set up test situations to generate and understand new possibilities for educational practice.

Bryn Holmes in 2001 applied this to student learning as described in an early paper, "in this [[model (abstract)|model]], students will not simply pass through a course like [[water]] through a [[sieve]] but instead leave their own imprint in the learning process."&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;{{cite document|last1=Holmes|first1=Bryan|last2=Tangney|first2=Brendan|last3=FitzGibbon|first3=Ann|last4=Savage|first4=Tim|last5=Mehan|first5=Siobhan|title=Communal Constructivism: Students constructing learning for as well as with others|url=https://www.scss.tcd.ie/publications/tech-reports/reports.01/TCD-CS-2001-04.pdf|publisher=Trinity College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence on computer science ==
Constructivism has influenced the course of programming and computer science. Some famous [[programming language]]s have been created, wholly or in part, for [[education]]al use, to support the [[Constructionism (learning theory)|constructionist]] theory of Seymour Papert. These languages have been [[dynamic typing|dynamically typed]], and [[reflection (computer science)|reflective]]. [[Logo programming language|Logo]] is the best known of them. Constructivism has also informed the design of interactive [[machine learning]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarkar|first=Advait|date=2016-01-01|title=Constructivist Design for Interactive Machine Learning|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2851581.2892547|journal=Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI EA '16|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=1467–1475|doi=10.1145/2851581.2892547|isbn=9781450340823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Delft Management Society''' (DMS) is a student organization independent of any educational institution that acts as a bridge between students and the corporate world. The society is focused on the academic, career and social development of [[Delft University of Technology]] students. The society is based in [[Delft]], [[Netherlands]]. The society has partners at multiple universities worldwide. 

The society is an interfaculty initiative and provides an international platform for the exchange, foreign and Dutch [[Delft University of Technology]] students (15,321 students). DMS provides all students in Delft with the opportunity to manage their own projects or events. This is guided by a board consisting of four students.

{{Life in the Republic of Ireland}}
The levels of '''Ireland's education''' are [[primary education|primary]], [[Secondary education|secondary]] and [[higher education|higher]] (often known as "third-level" or [[tertiary education|tertiary]]) education. In recent years [[further education]] has grown immensely. Growth in the [[economy of the Republic of Ireland|economy]] since the 1960s has driven much of the change in the education system. For universities there are student service fees (up to €3,000 in 2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third_level_education/fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/fees.html|title=Third-level student fees and charges|first=|last=Citizensinformation.ie|website=citizensinformation.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; which students are required to pay on registration, to cover examinations, insurance and registration costs.&lt;ref name="studentfinance.ie"&gt;{{cite web

The [[Department of Education and Skills (Ireland)|Department of Education and Skills]], under the control of the [[Minister for Education and Skills]], is in overall control of policy, funding and direction, while other important organisations are the [[National Qualifications Authority of Ireland]], the [[Higher Education Authority]], and on a local level the [[Education and Training Board]]s are the only comprehensive system of government organisation. There are many other statutory and non-statutory bodies that have a function in the education system. The current Minister for Education is [[Joe McHugh]].

==History==
Under the penal codes, the Irish Catholics were not allowed to have schools. Instead they set up highly informal secret operations that met in private homes, called "[[hedge school]]s."&lt;ref&gt;Tony  Lyons, "The Hedge Schools Of Ireland." ''History'' 24#6 (2016).  pp 28-31 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/histirel.24.6.28 online]&lt;/ref&gt;   Historians generally agree that they provided a kind of schooling, occasionally at a high level, for up to 400,000 students by the mid-1820s. J. R. R. Adams says the hedge schools testified “to the strong desire of ordinary Irish people to see their children receive some sort of education.”  Antonia McManus argues that there “can be little doubt that Irish parents set a high value on a hedge school education and made enormous sacrifices to secure it for their children....[the hedge schoolteacher was] one of their own”.&lt;ref&gt;Historians Adams and McManus are quoted in Michael C. Coleman, ''American Indians, the Irish, and Government Schooling: A Comparative Study''  (2005) p 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  The penal laws were dropped in the 1790s, making the hedge schools legal although still not receiving government help or funding.  
Formal schools for Catholics under trained teachers began to appear after 1800. [[Edmund Ignatius Rice]] (1762-1844)  founded two religious institutes of religious brothers: the Congregation of Christian Brothers and the Presentation Brothers. They opened numerous schools, which were visible, legal, and standardized. Discipline was notably strict.&lt;ref&gt;Dáire Keogh,  "Forged in the Fire of Persecution: Edmund Rice (1762–1844) and the Counter-Reformationary Character of the Irish Christian Brothers." in  Brendan Walsh, ed., ''Essays in the History of Irish Education'' (2016) pp. 83-103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the 1831 law establishing the [[National school (Ireland)|National School]] system, public money became available. British government appointed the commissioner of national education whose task was to upgrade the quality of teaching and increase literacy in English.  Hedge schools declined after 1831 as the Catholic bishops preferred this, as the new schools would be largely under the control of the Catholic Church and allow better control of the teaching of Catholic doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Donald H. Akenson, ''The Irish Educational Experiment: The National System of Education in the Nineteenth Century'' (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century==
Students must go to school from ages 6 to 16 or until they have completed three years of second-level of education.
&lt;ref&gt;Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 [https://web.archive.org/web/20110612232154/http://193.178.1.79/2000/en/act/pub/0022/sec0017.html (Section 17)], archived&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Constitution of Ireland]], parents are not obliged "in violation of their conscience and lawful preference to send their children to schools established by the State, or to any particular type of school designated by the State."&lt;ref&gt;Article 42.3.1, [[:s:Constitution of Ireland|Constitution of Ireland]], 1937&lt;/ref&gt; However the parental right to home-educate his/her child has met legal contests over minimum standards in the absence of constitutional provision for State-defined educational standards.

In 1973 the [[Irish language]] requirement for a [[State Examinations Commission|second-level certificate]] was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Burke, Minister for Education [http://www.scoilnet.ie/lookathistory/Video2.aspx?FolderId=2&amp;Id=515&amp;ref=9 announced at press conference on 5 April 1973] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234523/http://www.scoilnet.ie/lookathistory/Video2.aspx?FolderId=2&amp;Id=515&amp;ref=9 |date=26 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However the Irish language remains a core subject taught in all public schools with exemptions given to individual pupils on grounds of significant periods lived abroad, or with learning difficulties etc.

While English is the primary [[medium of instruction]] at all levels in most schools across the state, [[Gaelscoil]]eanna i.e. Irish-language schools, have become increasingly popular outside Gaeltacht regions where they have traditionally been. In these schools, Irish is the primary medium of instruction at all levels and English is taught as a second language.

At third level, most university programs are through English with only a few Irish options. Some universities offer courses partly through French, German or Spanish.

Ireland has one of the best education systems in the world with regard to higher education achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationinireland.com/en/Why-Study-in-Ireland-/|title=Why Study In Ireland|first=Admin|last=pTools|website=educationinireland.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Years===

Education is compulsory for all children in Ireland from the ages of six to sixteen '''or''' until students have completed three years of second level education and including one sitting of the Junior Certificate examination. Primary education commonly starts at four to five years old. Children typically enroll in a Junior Infant class at age four or five depending on parental wishes. Some schools enrollment policies have age four by a specific date minimum age requirements.

====Pre-school====

Most play schools in Ireland are in the private sector. Increasingly children of working parents, who are below school age, attend a myriad of crèches, play-schools, Montessori schools, etc., which have sprung up in response to the needs of modern families. These operate as businesses and may charge often substantial childcare fees. Since 2009, in response public demand for affordable childcare, children may receive two years free preschool the years prior to starting primary schools under the "Early Childcare and Education Scheme".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre_school_education_and_childcare/early_childhood_care_and_education_scheme.html|title=Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme|first=|last=Citizensinformation.ie|website=citizensinformation.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish language [[Naíonra]]í are growing rapidly across Ireland. Nearly 4,000 preschoolers attend 278 preschool groups.

====Primary School ====

*Junior Infants (age 4-5/5-6)
*Senior Infants (age 5-6/6-7)
*First Class (age 6-7/7-8)
*Second Class (age 7-8/8-9)
*Third Class (age 8-9/9-10)
*Fourth Class (age 9-10/10-11)
*Fifth Class (age 10-11/11-12)
*Sixth Class (age 11-12/12-13)

Children usually start at 9 a.m. and finish at 1.30 in Junior &amp; Senior infants, while older children finish at 3 p.m.

====Secondary School====

=====Junior Cycle=====
The Junior Cycle is a three-year programme, culminating in the [[Junior Certificate]] examination. The Junior Certificate examination is sat in all subjects (usually 10 or 11) in early June, directly after the end of Third Year. 
*First Year (age 12–14)
*Second Year (age 13–15)
*Third Year (age 14–16)

=====Transition Year=====
*[[Transition Year]] sometimes called Fourth Year (age 15–17)&amp;nbsp;– depending on school, this may be compulsory, optional or unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ty.slss.ie/ Transition Year Support Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402082324/http://ty.slss.ie/ |date=2 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Senior Cycle=====
The Senior Cycle is a two-year programme to prepare students for the [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate]] examinations.  The Leaving Certificate examinations take place directly after the end of Sixth Year, with the first exam being held on the Wednesday following the June public holiday (the first Monday in June).
*Fifth Year (age 16–18 or age 15–17 if Transition Year is skipped)
*Sixth Year (age 17–19 or age 16–18 if Transition Year is skipped)

To prepare students for the State examination in both the Senior (Leaving Certificate) and Junior (Junior Certificate) cycles, many schools hold Mock Examinations (also known as Pre-Certificate Examinations) around February each year. These "mocks" are not state examinations: independent companies provide the exam papers and marking schemes&amp;nbsp;– and are therefore not mandatory across all schools.

==Primary education==
The Primary School Curriculum (1999) is taught in all schools. The document is prepared by the [[National Council for Curriculum and Assessment]] and leaves to the church authorities (usually the [[Catholic Church]] but not universally) the formulation and implementation of the religious curriculum in the schools they control. The curriculum seeks to celebrate the uniqueness of the child:&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 1, [http://www.ncca.ie/eng/index.asp?docID=120 Primary School Curriculum], NCCA, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

:''...as it is expressed in each child's personality, intelligence and potential for development. It is designed to nurture the child in all dimensions of his or her life—spiritual, moral, cognitive, emotional, imaginative, aesthetic, social and physical...''

The Primary Certificate Examination (1929–1967) was the terminal examination at this level until the first primary-school curriculum, ''Curaclam na Bunscoile'' (1971), was introduced, though informal standardised tests are still performed. The primary school system consists of eight years: Junior and Senior Infants, and First to Sixth Classes. Most children attend primary school between the ages of four and twelve although it is not compulsory until the age of six. A minority of children start school at three.

Virtually all state-funded primary schools — almost 97 percent — are under church control. Irish law allows schools under church control to consider religion the main factor in admissions. Oversubscribed schools often choose to admit Catholics over non-Catholics, a situation that has created difficulty for non-Catholic families. The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child in Geneva asked [[James Reilly (Irish politician)|James Reilly]], the [[Minister for Children and Youth Affairs|Minister for Children]] at that time, to explain the continuation of preferential access to state-funded schools on the basis of religion. He said that the laws probably needed to change, but noted it may take a referendum because the Irish constitution gives protections to religious institutions. The issue is most problematic in the Dublin area. A petition initiated by a Dublin attorney, Paddy Monahan, has received almost 20,000 signatures in favour of overturning the preference given to Catholic children. A recently formed advocacy group, Education Equality, is planning a legal challenge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/world/europe/ireland-catholic-baptism-school.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news Catholic Church’s Hold on Schools at Issue in Changing Ireland] The New York Times, January 21, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of school===
Primary education is generally completed at a [[National school (Ireland)|national school]], a [[multidenominational school]], a gaelscoil or a [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]].
*[[National school (Ireland)|National school]]s date back to the introduction of state primary education in 1831. They are usually controlled by a board of management under [[diocese|diocesan]] [[patronage]] and often include a local clergyman.&lt;ref name="citizensinformation-ownership-primary-schools"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-primary-school/ownership-of-primary-schools|title=Ownership of primary schools|first=|last=Citizensinformation.ie|website=citizensinformation.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dept-education-new-model"/&gt; The term "national school" has of late become partly synonymous with [[primary education|primary school]] in some parts. Recently, there have been calls from many sides for fresh thinking in the areas of funding and governance for such schools, with some wanting them to be fully secularised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0131/6news.html RTÉ News (31 January 2007) - ''Primary school principals gather in Dublin''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213144041/http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0131/6news.html |date=13 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Gaelscoileanna'' are a recent movement, started in the mid 20th century. The Irish language is the working language in these schools and they can now be found countrywide in English-speaking communities. They differ from Irish-language national schools in Irish-speaking regions in that most are under the patronage of a voluntary organisation, ''[[An Foras Pátrúnachta na Scoileanna LánGhaeilge Teo|Foras Pátrúnachta na Scoileanna Lán-Ghaeilge]]'', rather than a diocesan patronage.&lt;ref name="citizensinformation-ownership-primary-schools"/&gt; Approximately 6% of primary school children attend Gaelscoils and approximately 3% attend Gaelcholáistí with 187 primary and post-primary schools across the country making it the fastest growing education sector.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}
*[[Multidenominational school]]s are another innovation. They are generally under the patronage of a non-profit limited company without share capital. They are often opened due to parental demand and students from all religions and backgrounds are welcome. Many are under the patronage of voluntary organisations such as ''[[Educate Together]]'' or ''[[An Foras Pátrúnachta na Scoileanna LánGhaeilge Teo|An Foras Pátrúnachta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaelscoileanna with a Multidenominational characteristic spirit|url=http://www.foras.ie/en/our-schools/type-of-school-immersion-education-gaelic-culture/|pages=Gaelscoileanna with a Multidenominational characteristic spirit}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one proposed school has been approved under the patronage of the regional ETB, who generally run vocational secondary schools.&lt;ref name="dept-education-new-model"&gt;[http://www.education.ie/robots/view.jsp?pcategory=10861&amp;language=EN&amp;ecategory=41296&amp;link=link001&amp;doc=34229 17 February 2007 - Minister Hanafin announces intention to pilot new additional model of Primary School Patronage], [[Department of Education and Skills (Ireland)|Department of Education and Science]] press release, 17 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
*Preparatory schools are [[independent school|independent]], fee-paying primary schools that are not reliant on the state for funding. These typically serve to prepare children for entry to fee-paying independent or [[Voluntary secondary school|voluntary]] secondary schools. Most are under the patronage of a religious order.

==Secondary education==
Most students enter secondary school aged 12–13. Most students attend and complete secondary education, with approximately 90% of school-leavers taking the terminal [[Test (assessment)|examination]], the [[Leaving Certificate Examination|Leaving Certificate]], at age 16–19 (in 6th Year at secondary school). Secondary education is generally completed at one of four types of school:&lt;ref name="citizensinformation-types-secondary"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Voluntary secondary school]]s, or just "secondary schools", are owned and managed by religious communities or private organisations. The state funds 90% of teachers' salaries and 95% of other costs. Such schools cater for 57% of secondary pupils.
* [[Vocational school]]s are owned and managed by [[Education and Training Board]]s, with 93% of their costs met by the state. These schools educate 28% of secondary pupils.
* [[Comprehensive school]]s or [[Community school (Ireland)|community school]]s were established in the 1960s, often by amalgamating voluntary secondary and vocational schools. They are fully funded by the state and run by local boards of management. Nearly 15% of secondary pupils attend such schools.
*[[Gaelcholáiste]]'s or Gaelcholáistí are the second-level schools for the Irish-language medium education sector in English-speaking communities. Approximately 3% of secondary students attend these schools. (see [[Gaelscoil]]eanna for the Irish language primary level sector).
*[[Grinds|Grind Schools]] are fee paying privately run schools outside the state sector, who tend to run only the Senior Cycle curriculum for 5th and 6th Year students as well as a one-year repeat Leaving Certificate programme.
In urban areas, there is considerable freedom in choosing the type of school the child will attend. The emphasis of the education system at second level is as much on breadth as on depth; the system attempts to prepare the individual for society and further education or work. This is similar to the [[Education in Scotland|education system in Scotland]]. Although in 2012, the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (Pisa) found Ireland to be 7th in reading and 20th in mathematics in a world survey at the age of 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-26249042|title=Pisa tests: Top 40 for maths and reading|date=2015-10-14|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some students opt for [[grinds]] to improve their grades.

=== Types of programme ===
The document ''Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools'' published by the Department of Education and Skills sets out the minimum standards of education required at this level. Examinations are overseen by the [[State Examinations Commission]]. Additional documents set out the standard in each element, module or subject.

* The '''Junior Cycle''' builds on the education received at primary level and culminates with the [[Junior Certificate|Junior Certificate Examination]]. Students usually begin this at the age of 12 or 13. The Junior Certificate Examination is taken after three years of study and not before fourteen years of age. It consists of exams in English, Irish, maths and science (unless the student has an exemption in one of these) as well as a number of chosen subjects. This is typically a selection of subjects including Art, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Latin, Ancient Greek and Classical Studies, Music, Business Studies, Technology, Home Economics, Materials Technology (Woodwork, Metalwork), History, Geography, Civic Social and Political Education (CSPE), and Religious Education. The selection of optional and compulsory subjects varies from school to school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.examinations.ie/index.php?l=en&amp;mc=ca&amp;sc=sc|title=State Examination Commission - Candidates|first=Ecom|last=Ireland|website=examinations.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most students take around ten examined subjects altogether. Other non-examined classes at Junior Cycle level include Physical Education and Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE).
* '''[[Transition Year]]''' is a one-year informal course taken by an increasing number of students usually ages 15 or 16. The content of this is left to the school to model on the local needs. It is compulsory in some schools but optional in others. Some schools do not offer it. Students may attend structured classes, but do not cover material relevant to the Senior Cycle or the Leaving Certificate exams, and therefore students who choose not to do this year are in no way academically disadvantaged when entering the Senior Cycle. The range of activities in Transition Year or Fourth Year differs greatly from school to school, but many include activities such as work experience placements, project work, international trips or exchanges and excursions. Students may participate in courses such as creative writing, sailing, film-making, public speaking and so on, or enter competitions in science, fashion, motor sport and others that would normally be too time-consuming for a full-time student. Proponents{{who|date=March 2017}} of TY believe that it allows students an extra year to mature, engage in self-directed learning, explore career options and to choose subjects for senior cycle (the results of the Junior Certificate examination do not become available until midway through September, by which time students not taking Transition Year will already have chosen their classes and begun attending). Opponents believe that a year away from traditional study and the classroom environment can distract students and cause problems when they return to the Senior Cycle. They also believe that the activities undertaken in TY prevent some students from enrolling in this year, as they can be costly and most schools charge a fee of a few hundred euro to cover these activities.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
* The '''Senior Cycle''' builds on the junior cycle and culminates with the [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate Examination]]. Students normally begin this aged 15–17 the year following the completion of the Junior Cycle or Transition Year. The Leaving Certificate Examination is taken after two years of study usually at the ages of 17-19.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Therefore, a typical secondary school will consist of First to Third Year (with the Junior Certificate at the end of Third), the usually optional Transition Year (though compulsory in some schools), and Fifth and Sixth Year (with the Leaving Cert. at the end of Sixth).

The vast majority of students continue from lower level to senior level, with only 12.3% leaving after the Junior Certificate. This is lower than the EU average of 15.2%.&lt;ref name="Measuring Ireland's Progress - 2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/releasespublications/documents/other_releases/2007/progress2007/measuringirelandsprogress.pdf|title=Server Error 404 - CSO - Central Statistics Office|website=cso.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ireland's secondary students rank above average in terms of academic performance in both the OECD and EU; having reading literacy, mathematical literacy and [[scientific literacy]] test scores better than average. Ireland has the second best reading literacy for teenagers in the EU, after Finland.&lt;ref name="Measuring Ireland's Progress - 2007"/&gt;

Available assistance includes an allowance for school clothing and footwear, assistance with purchasing school books (administered by school principals), exemption from examination fees for the Leaving Certificate and Junior Certificate exams, and a 'remote areas boarding grant' that facilitates students living in remote areas to attend secondary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary_and_post_primary_education/educational_supports/school_books_scheme.html |title=Financial help with going to school |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=3 September 2018 |website=Citizens Information |access-date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year is broken up into three terms: from the first week of September or last week in August to the week before Christmas. From the week after New Year's Day to the week before Easter Sunday and from the week after Easter Sunday to the end of May/Start of June. For 1st, 2nd and 5th Year secondary school students, their term finishes in the last week of May as they do not have state exams. Some schools allow Transition students to finish even earlier than 1st 2nd and 5th Years as they don't have any Summer Examinations. There is a mid-term (one week off halfway through a school term) around the Halloween bank holiday, two weeks off for Christmas: generally the last week in December and the first week in January, another mid-term in February, two weeks off for Easter and summer holidays. Bank Holidays are also taken off. Primary schools usually have July and August off, while secondary schools have June, July and August off except for 3rd and 6th Years sitting State exams in the first three weeks of June.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.schoolholidayseurope.eu/ireland.html|title=School holidays Ireland|last=Krimpen|first=Jeroen van|website=schoolholidayseurope.eu|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Esther Duflo''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] ({{IPA-fr|dyflo|lang}}; born 25 October 1972) is a [[France|French]] [[United States of America|American]]  [[economist]], Co-Founder and Director of the [[Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab]] (J-PAL), and [[Professor]] of [[Poverty Alleviation]] and [[Development economics|Development Economics]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. Duflo is an [[NBER]] [[Research Associate]],&lt;ref name=NBER /&gt; serves on the board of the Bureau for Research and Economic Analysis of Development (BREAD),&lt;ref name=BREAD /&gt; and is Director of the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]]'s [[development economics]] program.&lt;ref name=CEPR /&gt;

Her research focuses on [[microeconomics|microeconomic]] issues in [[developing countries]], including [[family economics|household behavior]], [[education]], [[access to finance]], [[health]], and [[policy analysis|policy evaluation]]. Together with [[Abhijit Banerjee]], [[Dean Karlan]], [[Michael Kremer]], [[John A. List]], and [[Sendhil Mullainathan]], she has been a driving force in advancing [[field experiment]]s as an important [[methodology]] to discover [[causality|causal relationships]] in [[economics]].

== Early life ==
Duflo was born in 1972 in Paris. Her father [[Michel Duflo]] was a mathematics professor and her mother was a doctor. At age 8, she decided to become a historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = The Poverty Lab|url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/05/17/the-poverty-lab|newspaper = The New Yorker|date = 2010-05-17|access-date = 2016-02-01|issn = 0028-792X|first = Ian|last = Parker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
After studying in [[Lycée Henri-IV]]'s [[Classes préparatoires aux grandes écoles|Classes préparatoires]] "B/L", Duflo entered her undergraduate studies at [[École normale supérieure (Paris)|École normale supérieure]] in Paris to study history. In her second year at university, she questioned her future as a professor and began considering a career in the civil service or politics. She spent ten months in [[Moscow]] starting in 1993. She taught French and worked on a history thesis that told how the [[Soviet Union]] "had used the big construction sites, like the [[Stalingrad]] tractor factory, for propaganda, and how propaganda requirements changed the actual shape of the projects." In Moscow, she also worked as a research assistant for a French economist then connected to the [[Bank of Russia]] and, separately, for [[Jeffrey Sachs]], the American economist at [[Harvard]]  advising the Minister of Finance. The research posts helped her to conclude that "economics had potential as a lever of action in the world" and she could satisfy academic ambitions while doing "things that mattered".

She finished her degree in history and economics at École Normale Supérieure in 1994, and she received a master's degree from DELTA, now the [[Paris School of Economics]], jointly with the [[École des hautes études en sciences sociales]] and the École Normale Supérieure in 1995. Subsequently, she completed a PhD in economics at [[MIT]] in 1999, under joint supervision of [[Abhijit Banerjee]] and [[Joshua Angrist]]. Upon completing her PhD, she was appointed assistant professor of [[economics]] at MIT and has been at MIT ever since, aside from being on leave to [[Princeton University]] in 2001–2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.povertyactionlab.org/duflo|title=Esther Duflo - The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab|website=www.povertyactionlab.org|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was promoted to associate professor (with [[tenure]]) in 2002, at 29, making her among the youngest faculty to be awarded tenure.

== Major contributions ==
Her PhD dissertation focused on effects of a [[natural experiment]] from data of an Indonesian school-expansion program of the 1970s to provide the first conclusive evidence that in a developing country, more education resulted in higher wages.

In 2003, she co-founded [[Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab|Poverty Action Lab]] at MIT, which has since conducted over 200 empirical development experiments and train development practitioners in running [[randomized controlled trial]]s.

== Awards ==
She won the 2014 [[Infosys Prize]] in Social Science-Economics.

She is a recipient of the 2010 [[John Bates Clark Medal]] for economists under 40 made the most significant contribution to economic thought and knowledge.&lt;ref name=JBCL /&gt; She received her (first) honorary doctorate from the [[Université catholique de Louvain]], on 2 February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uclouvain.be/308413.html Inaugural lecture by Esther Duflo at the conferral of her honorary doctorate, Université catholique de Louvain (French).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225075551/http://www.uclouvain.be/308413.html |date=2012-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Excellence in Cities''' (EiC) programme was launched by the UK's [[Labour Party (UK)#"New Labour" – in government, 1997–2010|Labour Government]] in March 1999 to raise standards and promote inclusion in [[Inner city|inner cities]] and other [[urban area]]s. Initially targeted at [[secondary school]]s, the programme was later expanded to include [[primary school]]s, working alongside the [[Primary National Strategy]].&lt;ref name=EiCEvaluation&gt;{{cite web|title=Excellence in Cities: The National Evaluation of a Policy to Raise Standards in Urban Schools 2000-2003|url=http://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/RR675a.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130401151715/http://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/RR675a.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 April 2013|website=National Archives|publisher=DfES|accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OfstedEiCReport&gt;{{cite web|title=Excellence in Cities|url=http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/5642/1/Excellence%20in%20Cities%20managing%20associated%20initiatives%20to%20raise%20standards%20%28PDF%20format%29.pdf|website=DERA|publisher=Ofsted|accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme was funded by the government, with '''£200 million''' being spent on it in 2001-02, and an additional '''£300 million''' in 2002-03. Over '''1300''' secondary schools and '''3600''' primary schools in 58 [[local education authority|local education authorities]] were involved in the EiC programme. In summer 2001, the percentage point increase in pupils achieving five [[GCSE]]s at A*-C in ''Excellence in Cities'' schools was almost double that of schools who weren't in the programme.[http://www.literacytrust.org.uk/Database/secondary/excellence.html]

The programme tackled underachievement in schools, including the development of '''Learning Mentors''', the development of '''Learning Support Units''', provision for [[Talented and Gifted program|Gifted and Talented]] pupils and the construction of [[City Learning Centre]]s. The programme also ran alongside the '''Leadership Incentive Grant''' and the '''Behaviour Improvement Programme'''. The '''Excellence Cluster''' concept was introduced to identify small groups of schools in pockets of deprivation, in both urban and rural areas that would benefit from EiC initiatives.&lt;ref name="EiCEvaluation"/&gt;

Research into the Excellence in Cities (EiC) initiative also found that while it had boosted results in [[Mathematics education|Mathematics]], it did not improve performance in [[English studies|English]] and [[Science]] of children aged 11 to 14 in [[Key Stage 3]].

==Growth==
The programme started off covering just 25 ''local education authorities'' in September 1999, but gradually expanded that to include many more over the following years.

* September 1999 ''(First Phase)'': Covered [[Secondary school]]s in 25 local education authorities.
* September 2000 ''(Second Phase)'': A further 22 areas joined, along with [[primary school]] pilots in Phase One areas. 
* September 2001 ''(Third Phase)'': A further 10 areas joined the programme, extending it to more than 1,000 schools - about a third of all secondary-age pupils in the country at the time.

'''Eye2eye Software Ltd''' is a UK educational software publisher, which has systematically photographed Britain in 360 degree panoramas and stills, publishing the collection as the school resource and home reference '''''Eye2eye Britain'''''. Using a portable panoramic camera developed by themselves they have followed a 'points of interest' approach--taking panoramas on mountains, beaches, inside parliaments, factories, heritage sites, etc. rather than a street (car) based approach like [[Google street view]].&lt;ref name=eye2eyews&gt;[http://www.eye2eyesoft.co.uk Eye2eye Software Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Eye2eye Software Ltd, based in Cambridge, England, was founded in 1998 by Martin Clemoes, son of the late [[Peter Clemoes]]. Eye2eye Britain may have been partly inspired by 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]] developed by [[Acorn Computers Ltd]] where Martin worked before.

November 1998 - first edition of Eye2eye Britain (1.0) published. Supplied on CD-ROM, this mapped out Britain in 10,000 digital photos (no panoramas). Each photo is captioned and indexed using metadata, e.g. topic, date of heritage sites on a timeline, as well as map location.

1999 - Press interest in Eye2eye Britain.
* The Guardian started an article ''CoastBusters''&lt;ref&gt;Newnham, D: ''Coastbusters'', The Guardian, 20 February 1999&lt;/ref&gt; with the line "Ever had an urge to explore the entire coastline of mainland Britain? Put away that sou'wester and boot up your PC instead. For a round trip from John O'Groats to John O'Groats, its not rainwear you need, but software."
* Personal Computer World subtitled a review&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson, N: ''Eye2eye Britain'', Personal Computer World, July 1999&lt;/ref&gt; with "A hugely impressive reference work that focuses on places of note in the British Isles".

January 2005 - First Panoramic Edition of Eye2eye Britain published. Added 950 full screen 360 by 105 degree panoramas, of England from Leeds in Yorkshire South, to 10,000 photos.

2005-06 - Consumer press critical, better feedback for education.
* Before 2007 launch of [[Google street view]], consumer press did not see appeal of exploring with panoramas - e.g. 5 May Computer Shopper review&lt;ref&gt;Bedford, M: ''Eye2eye Britain - Panorama Edition'', Computer Shopper, 17 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; ending with "As no information is provided for people who want to visit the places featured in Eye2eye Britain, it's more suitable as an educational product than for use by day-trippers or holiday-makers."
* With whiteboards becoming widely used in UK schools, education press more enthusiastic, e.g. in 6 December Education Guardian article called ''Bring maps to life and save the world''.&lt;ref&gt;Parkinson, A: ''Bring maps to life and save the world'', Education Guardian, 12 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

January 2010 - Latest edition - Eye2eye Britain Panoramic 5 - published. 1,500 panoramas and 10,800 photos now cover mainland England, Wales and Scotland plus the largest of Britain's many islands.&lt;ref name=eye2eyews /&gt; Edition 5 also supports other school needs such as [[Virtual learning environment]].

==Panorama technology==
Eye2eye's approach to panoramic photography depends on two technologies they have developed themselves:&lt;ref name=eye2eyews /&gt;
# A portable panoramic camera system capturing a 360 by 105 degree  panorama in a single click.
# Panorama rendering software for the PC that syncs with screen refresh, rendering a perspective view frame for each screen refresh (e.g. 60 frames per second) for smooth panorama movement.

This technology has shaped their approach to panorama-photographing Britain. They have used their portable camera system to capture points of interest panoramas on foot, e.g. interiors, beaches, tower-top or mountain-top views. Single-click capture copes well with places with movement, e.g. crowds, waves on beach. This approach has the advantage of covering places of [inter]national interest, but the disadvantage of being labour-intensive, so the quantity of panoramas (currently around 1,500) is less than in car-based projects like [[Google Street View]]. Eye2eye have also been able to write captions and indexes for each panorama.

She was a champion of black rights in employment and education.

== Biography ==
She was born as Florence Ruth Barrett on March 17, 1898 to Frank C. and Maude (née Lawson) Barrett in [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She attended [[Wilberforce University]] and later moved to Boston in 1935.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; LeSueur had been a long-time resident of the [[South End, Boston|South End]], a neighborhood in Boston, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

From 1948 until 1951 she served as the president of the Boston branch of the NAACP, and was the first woman president nationwide. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/africanamericans00hayd_0|title=African-Americans in Boston : more than 350 years|last=Hayden|first=Robert C.|date=1991|publisher=Boston : Trustees of the Public Library of the City of Boston|others=Boston Public Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=81cEAAAAMBAJ&amp;dq|title=The Crisis|last=|first=|publisher=The Crisis Publishing Company, Inc.|year=April 1951|location=New York, New York|pages=273|issn=0011-1422}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her time with the NAACP, six black men were hired as [[Boston Elevated Railway]] drivers (the predecessor of the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]]), due to her unrelenting determination.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In order to persuade transit system officials that blacks deserved better job roles, LeSuerer organized demonstrations near the [[Dudley Square (MBTA station)]] and she led delegations for the cause, this eventually resulted in getting them hired at a higher job level as drivers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For more than 20 years she was a director of the NAACP branch.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, in 1959 she served as president of the Harriet Tubman House (now part of [[United South End Settlements]]).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Free Knowledge Institute''' ('''FKI''') is a [[non-profit organisation]] founded in 2006 in the Netherlands. Inspired by the [[free software movement]], the FKI fosters the [[Free content|free exchange of knowledge]] in all areas of society by promoting freedom of use, modification, [[Copyleft|copying]], and distribution of knowledge pertaining to education, technology, culture, and science.

The FKI coordinates and participates in projects concerning education, [[access to knowledge]], [[intellectual property]], and [[open educational resources]].

== Vision ==
Communication networks, and especially the Internet, have become the driving force of a revolution only comparable to the one that followed the invention of the printing press. In its years of existence, the Internet has given wings to our natural tendency to share information.

However, still a dominant sector of society thinks that knowledge should be protected by several legal regimes commonly referred to with the term '[[intellectual property]]'. This term suggests that knowledge can be exclusively owned and neglects the differences between tangible and intangible goods: while tangible goods have a scarcity problem, intangible goods can be copied and shared without limit and, when shared, tend to increase their total value.

A countermovement started in the 1980s with the rise of the Free Software movement and open standards, which have produced a tremendous wealth of free software applications and form the basis of the current internet. The principles behind [[Free Software]] have inspired the unrestricted sharing and reusing of artistic and cultural works in the free content movement (including [[Creative Commons]]) and the creation and use of free educational materials in the educational sector. In a similar way, the [[Open access (publishing)|Open Access]] movement promotes the sharing and open publication of research for advancing scientific knowledge.

The Free Knowledge Institute believes that by promoting the use of Free Knowledge in the fields of Technology, Education, Culture and Science more individuals and organisations will profit from the benefits of sharing knowledge.

== Founding principles ==
The Free Knowledge Institute has formulated a set of principles that it considers basic for being consistent with its vision. These founding principles take as a starting point the sharing of knowledge in the tradition of [[copyleft]] and include the use of [[free software]], adherence to [[open standards]], the importance of education, respect for diversity and different cultures, transparency and consensus.&lt;ref&gt;The founding principles of the Free Knowledge Institute: http://freeknowledge.eu/about/principles&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
In order to work towards this vision, the Free Knowledge Institute participates in political debates and activism to highlight the wrongs of certain policies and propose alternatives. For that reason the FKI works together in various networks and coalitions with other groups and organisations. With the Open Net Coalition,&lt;ref&gt;The Open Net Coalition operates the Blackout Europe website: http://www.blackouteurope.eu/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Open Letter to the European Parliament to protect [[Network Neutrality]]: http://www.laquadrature.net/en/we-must-protect-net-neutrality-in-europe-open-letter-to-the-european-parliament&lt;/ref&gt; a collective warning has been formulated about policy proposals in the EU parliament threatening internet neutrality.

== Projects ==

=== SELF Project ===
The SELF Platform aims to become a collaborative web platform with high quality educational and training materials about [[Free Software]] and [[Open Standards]]. It is based on world-class Free Software technologies that permit both reading and publishing free materials, and is driven by a worldwide community.

[http://www.selfproject.eu SELF] (Science, Education and Learning in Freedom) is an international project that was initially financed by the [[European Commission]] which has developed a platform to encourage creative cooperation and the sharing of educational materials and continuous training, paying special attention to free software and open standards. Inspired by the Wikipedia model, the SELF Platform is open to the contributions of all those who would like to bring their knowledge to it, and share this knowledge without restrictions,.&lt;ref&gt;Final report of the SELF Project (ref: IST - 034595) of the EC-funded phase, published by the European Commission, 2008 ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/ist/docs/directorate_d/st-ds/self-final-report_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Free software gets an education, ICT Results, 2008, http://cordis.europa.eu/ictresults/index.cfm?section=news&amp;tpl=article&amp;id=90147&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Free Knowledge, Free Technology Conference ===
The Free Knowledge, Free Technology Conference (FKFT) was an event that centered the production and sharing of educational and training materials in the field of Free Software and Open Standards. It was held first in 2008 in Barcelona and was organised by the SELF Project and the Free Knowledge Institute.&lt;ref&gt;The Free Knowledge, Free Technology Conference (FKFT): http://fkft.eu/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Free Technology Academy ===
The [http://ftacademy.org Free Technology Academy] consists of an advanced virtual campus with course modules that can be followed entirely on-line. The learning materials are Open Educational Resources that can be studied freely, but learners enrolled in the FTA will be guided by professional teaching staff from the participating universities. The full master programme can be concluded at one of the universities.
The project financially supported by the Life Long Learning Programme (LLP) of the [[European Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;Approved by the European Parliament under reference number 142706-LLP-1-2008-1-NL-ERASMUS-EVC: http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/llp/funding/2008/call/documents/results/ERA/LLP2008_SelDec_ERA_MP_fin.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is a collaboration between the FKI and various European universities and organisations like the 
[[Open Universiteit Nederland]] (OUNL) from The Netherlands, the [[Open University of Catalonia]] (UOC) from Spain and others.,.&lt;ref&gt;EC elearning info directory about the FTA: http://www.elearningeuropa.info/directory/index.php?page=doc&amp;doc_id=14035&amp;doclng=6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Free technology academy: a European initiative for distance education about free software and open standards, Proceedings of the 14th annual ACM SIGCSE conference on Innovation and technology in computer science education, 2009, http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1562877.1562904&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Free Culture Forum ===
The [[Free Culture Forum]] was an international encounter on free culture and knowledge that took place in Barcelona from October 30 to November 1, 2009. It took place jointly with the second edition of the oXcars. During the Forum 200 organizations and individuals linked to free culture expressions discuss on the privatization of the creation and the intellectual property and its incidence in the access to the knowledge and the creation and distribution of the art, knowledge and culture. The Forum ended up with the definition of a [http://fcforum.org "Charter for Innovation, Creativity and Access to Knowledge"].

The first edition of the Forum was organised by [http://exgae.net/ Exgae], [http://www.networked-politics.info Networked politics] and the Free Knowledge Institute.

== History ==
Robert Hallowell Gardiner founded the school in 1822 on land with buildings he gave to the new school.&lt;ref name=White/&gt; The school was given statewide recognition when there was an Act (Chapter CXCIX) in addition to an Act to incorporate was passed in February 1823 by the state of Maine governor, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the State of Maine, the president of the [[Bowdoin College]], the president of the [[Waterville College]] and others called the Board of Visitors.{{sfn|Maine|1823|p=201}}

The directors of the Gardiner Lyceum school were men associated with higher education. The first principal and main instructor of the school was [[Benjamin Hale (educator)|Benjamin Hale]] (president of [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Hobart College]] and a future professor at [[Dartmouth College]]). The next principal was a professor of [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College of New York]] and later president of the State universities of Missouri, Maryland, and Wisconsin. The next principal was a supreme judge in the state of New Hampshire. The next principal was a graduate of [[Brown University]].{{sfn|True|1929|p=36}}

Maine legislature provided the school with $2,000 in funds in 1823 when the school opened. The legislature provided the school with funds of $1,000 per year for six years starting in 1825. The first year in operation the school had twenty students. The school had 53 students in 1824. It had 120 students in 1825. In 1826 the student level fell off to only 55 pupils that included only 2 Gardiner native residents.{{sfn|True|1929|p=36}}

== Name origin ==
Since the location of the new school was in [[Gardiner, Maine]] and it was a [[lyceum]] (vocational secondary school, not a high school or college), it took on the name "Gardiner Lyceum" (advanced technical schooling in the town of Gardiner).&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{sfn|Cattell|1921|p=532}}

== Courses ==
The courses were designed for the realistic and useful applications of mathematics and science with emphasis on liberal and cultural subjects. {{sfn|Conference on Post-secondary Occupational Education|1975|p=25}} They were mainly designed to make scientific farmers and skillful craftsmen. {{sfn|True|1929|p=36}} The main object of the courses of the '' Gardiner Lyceum '' was intended to be something between High School, preparatory agenda for entering into college, and a college or university education. '' Gardiner Lyceum '' was intended as a practical vocational school that prepared the students with an immediate trade (e.g. farming). The school was intended as a two-year agenda. The school was a [[lyceum]], a secondary schooling that was more technical that High School and less scholarly than a college or university education. It was for trade training for immediate employment in the field of their choice.{{sfn|Gazette|1825|p=362-364}}

The courses of the school classes were in various fields of advanced mathematics, bookkeeping, surveying, mechanics, hydrostatics, pneumatics, chemistry, natural philosophy, and natural history.&lt;ref name=Kane/&gt; There were also courses in navigation and carpentry. {{sfn|Berg|2002|p=44}} The principal object of the lyceum was in establishing young men to be practical in running a farm profitable or do professionally whatever occupation they chose.&lt;ref name =FactsOnFile&gt;

== Laws of the Gardiner Lyceum and Regulations for its Government ==

There is a set of Laws printed in 1825 by P. Shelton on how the school was to be regulated - a copy held by the Library of Congress. In the Preface it gives the language ''It is almost unnecessary to add that this system is found not only to prepare young men for the real business of life, but to give them manliness of feeling and character.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |title= Laws of the Gardiner Lyceum and Regulations for its Government |url= |accessdate= |year= 1825 |publisher= Gardiner Lyceum school, printer P. Shelton |location= Gardiner, Maine|isbn= |pages=3, 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equipment ==

A stone building was built for the school.{{sfn|Kingsbury|Deyo|1892|p=201}} There was fourteen acres of land provided for agriculture training for those students that were going to become farmers and of agricultural occupations.&lt;ref name=White/&gt; The land was on the [[Kennebec River]] in Gardiner and worth about $4,000 at the time.&lt;ref name=Franklin/&gt; The school had available to the pupils, besides books, a workshop at no cost to them which consisted of circular saws, models, minerals, and specimens in natural history.&lt;ref name=White/&gt; The school additionally provided modern equipment and tools for training.{{sfn|Gazette|1825|p=362-364}}

== Demise ==

The school struggled financially for 6 years from 1826 until it closed in 1832 for various reasons, but mostly due to lack of funds that it needed to continue running. Mr. Gardiner, the founder, then had to close the school. {{sfn|True|1929|p=36}}

== Legacy ==

The concept of teaching "scientific farming" was first started by the ''Gardiner Lyceum''. In the United States about a thousand similar schools teaching this concept were in place a decade later.&lt;ref name = msjc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cis.msjc.edu/courses/evoc/637/Assignments/DL6-8.pdf |title=Vocational Education Philosophy and Historical Development |last1= Bennett |first1= William |last2= |first2= |date= November 21, 2009 |website= |publisher= Mt.

[[File:MEK II-14.jpg|thumb|Celestial globe in the exhibition of the [[Museum Europäischer Kulturen]] in Berlin, Germany]]


A '''globe''' is a spherical [[Physical model|model]] of [[Earth]], of some other [[Astronomical object|celestial body]], or of the [[celestial sphere]]. Globes serve similar purposes to [[map]]s, but unlike maps, do not distort the surface that they portray except to scale it down. A globe of Earth is called a ''terrestrial globe''. A globe of the celestial sphere is called a ''celestial globe''.

A globe shows details of its subject. A terrestrial globe shows land masses and water bodies. It might show nations and prominent cities and the network of latitude and longitude lines. Some have raised [[relief]] to show mountains. A celestial globe shows stars, and may also show positions of other prominent astronomical objects. Typically it will also divide the celestial sphere up into constellations.

The word "globe" comes from the [[Latin]] word ''globus'', meaning "[[sphere]]". Globes have a long history. The first known mention of a globe is from [[Strabo]], describing [[Crates of Mallus#The Globe of Crates|the Globe of Crates]] from about 150&amp;nbsp;BC. The oldest surviving terrestrial globe is the [[Erdapfel]], wrought by [[Martin Behaim]] in 1492. The oldest surviving celestial globe sits atop the [[Farnese Atlas]], carved in the 2nd century [[Roman Empire]].

==Terrestrial and planetary==
Flat maps are created using a [[map projection]] that inevitably introduces an increasing amount of distortion the larger the area that the map shows. A globe is the only representation of the Earth that does not distort either the shape or the size of large features&amp;nbsp;– land masses, bodies of water, etc.

The [[Earth's circumference]] is quite close to 40&amp;nbsp;million metres.&lt;ref&gt;The Earth’s circumference is 40&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;m because the [[metre]] was originally defined to be one 10-millionth of the distance between the poles and the equator.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arc length#Arcs of great circles on the Earth]]&lt;/ref&gt; Many globes are made with a circumference of one metre, so they are models of the Earth at a scale of 1:40&amp;nbsp;million. In imperial units, many globes are made with a [[diameter]] of one&amp;nbsp;[[Foot (unit)|foot]], yielding a circumference of 3.14 feet and a scale of 1:41,777,000. Globes are also made in many other sizes.

Sometimes a globe has surface texture showing [[topography]]; in these, elevations are exaggerated, otherwise they would be hardly visible. Most modern globes are also imprinted with [[circle of latitude|parallels]] and [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]s, so that one can tell the approximate [[Geographic coordinate system|coordinates]] of a specific place. Globes may also show the boundaries of countries and their names.

Many terrestrial globes have one celestial feature marked on them: a diagram called the [[analemma]], which shows the apparent motion of the Sun in the sky during a year.

Globes generally show north at the top, but many globes allow the axis to be swiveled so that southern portions can be viewed conveniently. This capability also permits exploring the earth from different orientations to help counter the [[South-up map orientation|north-up bias]] caused by conventional map presentation.

==Celestial==

{{see also|Celestial globe}}
Celestial globes show the apparent positions of the stars in the sky. They omit the [[Sun]], [[Moon]] and planets because the positions of these bodies vary relative to those of the stars, but the [[ecliptic]], along which the Sun moves, is indicated.

==History==
[[File:Behaims Erdapfel.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The "Erdapfel" of Martin Beheim is the oldest surviving terrestrial globe, made between 1491 and 1493; the Americas are not yet included. ''[[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]]'', Nuremberg (2006)]]

The [[sphericity of the Earth]] was established  by [[Greek astronomy]] in the 3rd century BC, and the earliest terrestrial globe appeared from that period. The earliest known example is the one constructed by [[Crates of Mallus]] in [[Cilicia]] (now [[Çukurova]] in modern-day Turkey), in the mid-2nd century BC.

No terrestrial globes from Antiquity or the Middle Ages have survived. An example of a surviving [[celestial globe]] is part of a Hellenistic sculpture, called the [[Farnese Atlas]], surviving in a 2nd-century AD Roman copy in the [[Naples Archaeological Museum]], Italy.&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early terrestrial globes depicting the entirety of the [[Old World]] were constructed in the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic world]].&lt;ref&gt;Medieval Islamic Civilization By Josef W. Meri, Jere L Bacharach, pages [https://books.google.com/books?id=H-k9oc9xsuAC&amp;pg=PA138 138–139]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Third Dimension|first=Richard|last=Covington|journal=[[Saudi Aramco World]], May–June 2007|year=2007|pages=17–21|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200703/the.third.dimension.htm|accessdate=2008-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to David Woodward, one such example was the terrestrial globe introduced to [[Beijing]] by the [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Persian]] astronomer, [[Jamal ad-Din (astronomer)|Jamal ad-Din]], in 1267.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Image of the Spherical Earth|author=David Woodward|journal=[[Perspecta (journal)|Perspecta]]|volume=25|year=1989|pages=3–15 [9]|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|jstor=1567135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest extant terrestrial globe was made in 1492 by [[Martin Behaim]] (1459–1537) with help from the painter Georg Glockendon.&lt;ref name=Encarta/&gt; Behaim was a German mapmaker, navigator, and merchant. Working in [[Nuremberg]], Germany, he called his globe the "Nürnberg Terrestrial Globe." It is now known as the [[Erdapfel]]. Before constructing the globe, Behaim had traveled extensively. He sojourned in [[Lisbon]] from 1480, developing commercial interests and mingling with explorers and scientists. In 1485–1486, he sailed with Portuguese explorer Diogo Cão to the coast of West Africa. He began to construct his globe after his return to Nürnberg in 1490.

Another early globe, the [[Hunt–Lenox Globe]], ca. 1510, is thought to be the source of the phrase ''Hic Sunt Dracones'', or “[[Here be dragons]]”. A similar [[grapefruit]]-sized globe made from two halves of an [[Ostrich#Reproduction|ostrich egg]] was found in 2012 and is believed to date from 1504. It may be the oldest globe to show the [[New World]]. Stefaan Missine, who analyzed the globe for the Washington Map Society journal ''Portolan'', said it was “part of an important European collection for decades.”&lt;ref name=Kim&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/oldest-globe-to-depict-the-new-world-may-have-been-discovered/2013/08/19/503b2b4a-06b4-11e3-a07f-49ddc7417125_story.html|title=Oldest globe to depict the New World may have been discovered|last=Kim|first=Meeri|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=2018-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a year of research in which he consulted many experts, Missine concluded the Hunt–Lenox Globe was a [[copper]] [[Die casting|cast]] of the egg globe.&lt;ref name=Kim/&gt;

A facsimile globe showing America was made by [[Martin Waldseemueller]] in 1507. Another "remarkably modern-looking" terrestrial globe of the Earth was constructed by [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]] at the [[Constantinople Observatory of Taqi ad-Din]] during the 1570s.&lt;ref name=Soucek&gt;{{citation|first=Svat|last=Soucek|title=Piri Reis and Ottoman Discovery of the Great Discoveries|journal=[[Studia Islamica]]|volume=79|issue=79|year=1994|pages=121–142 [123 &amp; 134–6]|doi=10.2307/1595839|jstor=1595839|publisher=Maisonneuve &amp; Larose}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world’s first seamless [[celestial globe]] was built by [[Mughal Empire#Science and technology|Mughal scientists]] under the patronage of [[Jahangir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/globe/|title=globe|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-01-21|newspaper=National Geographic Society|language=en|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1800s small pocket globes (less than 3 inches) were status symbols for gentlemen and educational toys for rich children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bliss|first1=Laura|title=These tiny glass globes were all the rage in London 200 years ago|url=http://qz.com/280392/these-tiny-glass-globes-were-all-the-rage-in-london-200-years-ago/|accessdate=2014-10-14|work=[[Quartz (publication)]]|date=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, globes were manufactured by gluing a printed paper map onto a sphere, often made from wood.

The most common type has long, thin [[Gore (segment)|gores]] (strips) of paper that narrow to a point at the poles,&lt;ref name="sourceforge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/globe.jpg|title=Image: globe.jpg, (450 × 100 px)|publisher=netpbm.sourceforge.net|accessdate=2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  small disks cover over the inevitable irregularities at these points. The more gores there are, the less stretching and crumpling is required to make the paper map fit the sphere. This method of globe making was illustrated in 1802 in an engraving in The English Encyclopedia by George Kearsley [http://www.finerareprints.com/plans-for-constructing-globes-22377/].

Modern globes are often made from [[thermoplastic]]. Flat, plastic disks are printed with a distorted map of one of the Earth's [[wikt:hemisphere|Hemispheres]]. This is placed in a machine which molds the disk into a hemispherical shape. The hemisphere is united with its opposite counterpart to form a complete globe.

Usually a globe is mounted so that its spin axis is 23.5° from vertical, which is the angle the Earth's spin axis deviates from perpendicular to the plane of its orbit. This mounting makes it easy to visualize how [[season]]s change.

Several still exist, including three in Berlin: one at a geographical institute, one at the [[Märkisches Museum]], and another at the [[Deutsches Historisches Museum]]. The latter has a [[U.S.S.R.|Soviet]] bullet hole through Germany. One of the two in public collections in [[Munich]] has an American bullet hole through Germany. There are several in private hands inside and out of Germany. A much smaller version of Hitler’s globe was mocked by [[Charlie Chaplin]] in ''[[The Great Dictator]]'', a film released in 1940.&lt;!--all info in this Hitler subsection AS OF Sept 17 2007 is from the NYT reference--&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTHitler"&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/arts/design/18globe.html The Mystery of Hitler's Globe Goes Round and Round]", by Michael Kimmelman, September 18, 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20188">The '''Grey Literature International Steering Committee [https://web.archive.org/web/20090918235208/http://www.glisc.info/ GLISC]''' was established in 2006 after the 7th International Conference on Grey Literature (GL7) held in Nancy (France) on 5–6 December 2005.

During this conference, the Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS) (Rome, Italy) presented guidelines for the production of scientific and technical [[reports]] documents included in the wider category of [[grey literature]] (GL) defined at the International Conferences on Grey Literature held in Luxembourg (1997) and in New York (2004) – as “information produced on all levels of government, academics, business and industry in electronic and print formats not controlled by commercial publishing i.e. where publishing is not the primary activity of the producing body”.

The Italian initiative for the adoption of uniform requirements for the production of reports was discussed during a Round Table on Quality Assessment by a small group of GL producers, librarians and information professionals who agreed to collaborate in the revision of the guidelines proposed by ISS.

The group approving these guidelines – informally known as the “Nancy Group” – has been formally defined as the Grey Literature International Steering Committee (GLISC).

The recommendations are adapted from the [[Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals]], produced by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) - better known as “Vancouver Style” (updated February 2006, available from http://www.icmje.org/ and now adopted by more than 500 biomedical journals). These requirements also took into consideration the basic principles of [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] Standard Documentation entitled “Presentation of scientific and technical reports” (ISO 5966/1982) withdrawn in 2000. The ISO 5966 no longer met the requirements of ITC (Information Technology Communication), however, it still provides useful tips in the preparation of reports.

The Guidelines are created primarily to help authors and GL producers in their mutual task of creating and distributing accurate, clear, easily accessible reports in different fields. The goal of the Guidelines is, in fact, to permit an independent and correct production of institutional reports in accordance with basic editorial principles.

The Guidelines include ethical principles related to the process of evaluating, improving, and making reports available and the relationships between GL producers and authors. The latter sections address the more technical aspects of preparing and submitting reports. GLISC believes the entire document is relevant to the concerns of both authors and GL producers.

The Guidelines are informally known as "Nancy style".

== GLISC members ==

These are the institutions which officially adopted the "Nancy Style" in the production and distribution of grey literature.
*[http://www.iss.it Istituto Superiore di Sanità] (ISS) – Rome, Italy
*Institut de l’Information Scientifique et Technique ([[INIST]]-CNRS) – Nancy, France
*[[Grey Literature Network Service]] (GreyNet), Amsterdam – The Netherlands

Many other institutions all over the world do support and use the GLISC guidelines without a formal agreement which would require longer procedures.

== The GLISC Guidelines for the production of scientific and technical reports (also known as "Nancy style") ==

'''Authorship:''' The [https://web.archive.org/web/20090918235208/http://www.glisc.info/ GLISC] guidelines were prepared by Paola De Castro and Sandra Salinetti from the [http://www.iss.it Istituto Superiore di Sanità], Rome (Italy). They were critically revised by Joachim Schöpfel and Christiane Stock (INIST-CNRS, Nancy, France), Dominic Farace (GreyNet, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), Catherine Candea and Toby Green ([[OECD]], Paris, France) and Keith G. Jeffery (CCLRC, Chilton Didcot, UK). The work was accompanied by Marcus A. Banks (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA), Stefania Biagioni (ISTI-CNR, Pisa, Italy), June Crowe (Information International Associates Inc., IIA, Oak Ridge, USA) and Markus Weber (Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, Berne, Switzerland).

'''Structure:''' The guidelines are divided in five sections:
# Statement of purpose
# Ethical considerations (authorship, peer review, confidentiality…)
# Publishing and editorial issues (copyright, institutional repositories, advertising…)
# Report preparation (instructions to authors, report structure, revision editing…)
# General information on the Guidelines

The annex contains references and a list of institutions adopting the guidelines.

'''Update:''' The first version 1.0 from March 2006 was updated in July 2007 (version 1.1).

'''Translation:''' Version 1.1 was translated in French, German and Italian and Spanish.

'''Availability:''' Version 1.1 and translations are available on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090918235208/http://www.glisc.info/ GLISC] website.

The total content of the Guidelines may be reproduced for educational, not-for-profit purposes without regard for copyright; the Committee encourages distribution of the material.

The GLISC policy is for interested organizations to link to the official English language document at www.glisc.info. The GLISC does not endorse posting of the document on websites other than https://web.archive.org/web/20090918235208/http://www.glisc.info/ . The GLISC welcomes organizations to reprint or translate this document into languages other than English for no-profit purposes.

== Comparison between “Nancy style” and ANSI/NISO Z39.18 ==

The ANSI/NISO Standard Z39.18-2005 Scientific and Technical Reports – Preparation, Presentation, and Preservation (released in 2005) has been considered a valuable source for comparison. The major differences concerning the two documents as a whole regard:

'''*Document type'''

They are different in that the “Nancy style” represents guidelines – that is general principles agreed upon by a small group of experts, to be followed as an indication or outline of policy or conduct –, while the ANSI/NISO Z39.18 is a proper standard, developed by the Standards Committees of the US National Information Standards Organization (NISO), subject to rigorous control and approval process including peer review. This is why also the structure of the two documents is different since the standard may repeat concepts in different sections which may be used separately, while the Guidelines are intended as an easy to read document giving the general idea for recommended items. The Guidelines, different from standards, do not give full details on format and style. Moreover, the “Nancy style” represents international guidelines developed by a corporate author (GLISC), which worked on the draft proposed by the Istituto Superiore di Sanità, and signed approval of this best practice on behalf of their respective organizations, while the ANSI/NISO Z39.18 is a national standard approved by the American National Standards Institute through a number of Voting Members.
 
'''*Paper vs digital document medium'''

The “Nancy style” is mostly paper oriented giving recommendations on report preparation mainly reflecting a traditional paper structure, while the organization pattern of the ANSI/NISO Z39.18 is user-based more than content-based. The key concepts incorporated in the American standard mainly refer to metadata, persistence of links, interoperability, creation, discovery/retrieval, presentation in digital format (DTD, XML, XSL), maintenance and preservation (original content, software and media); it also contains a metadata schema, which is absent in the Guidelines.

'''*Annexes'''

All material included in the “Nancy style” is approved by the GLISC, while the ANSI/NISO Z39.18 provides a large amount of additional information (almost half of the pages) that is not part of the Standard (Appendices including selected annotated bibliography, glossary, Dublin Core data elements, etc.).

'''*Content'''

In general, the “Nancy style” contains technical requirements for a report, but does not include full details (i.e. format, style, etc.); yet, it provides important elements, which are not present or not fully described in the ANSI/NISO Z39.18. 
*Ethical issues
An initial section is explicitly devoted to authorship, editorship, peer review, conflicts of interest, privacy and confidentiality. 
*Instructions for authors
Producers are strongly recommended to issue instructions to guide authors in the production of a formally correct document containing ethical and editorial issues as well as indications for formats, styles, illustrations, etc. 
*Revision
Special attention is given to revision editing as GL is not generally peer reviewed, or produced with editorial support; therefore, it is fundamental that authors be aware of the importance of a careful revision of their texts before diffusion. 
*Reference style
The adoption of the “Vancouver style” is recommended and examples and rules are given as a fundamental step for information retrieval.
As regards document structure, it is basically the same in “Nancy style” and ANSI/NISO Z39.18, with minor terminological variations. Yet, the American standard explicitly gives indication on:
–	Report Documentation Page (since it is used by some agencies within the federal government, and also some sample pages are given).
–	Distribution list.
–	Glossary (although not part of the Standard).
–	Executive abstract.

'''*Technical recommendations'''

Since the “Nancy style” represents guidelines and not a standard, all technical considerations are limited to the essential, while the ANSI/NISO Z39.18 gives indications (all absent in the “Nancy style”) on:
*Print-specific/non-print-specific recommendations
The Section 6 “Presentation and display” describes standard methods for ensuring consistency in presentation including designing visual and tabular matter, formatting, etc. and makes a distinction between rules applicable to all reports regardless of mode of publication (paper or digital) and rules applicable to reports published in paper form only. 
*Format 
Specific information is provided on fonts, line length, margins, page numbering, style, units and numbers, formulas and equations, paper (format and type), printing equipment, ink.
The ANSI/NISO Z39.18 also includes specifications on index entries and errata, which are not present in the “Nancy style”.

== Support, Translation and Updating of the "Nancy Style" ==

Many institutions considered the relevance of the GLISC Guidelines for the production and distribution of technical reports and for educational purposed, therefore, accepted to carry out the translation of the original English version into different languases.

Translations are available in:
*'''Italian''' - translation carried out by the Istituto Superiore di Sanità&lt;br /&gt;. The ISS published a technical report on "Grey literature in scientific communication: “Nancy style” to guarantee editorial quality of technical reports", including the translation of the GLISC guidelines [http://www.iss.it/binary/publ/cont/06-55%20WEB.1175081126.pdf Rapporti ISTISAN 06/55]
*'''French''' - translation carried out by INIST - Institute for Scientific and Technical Information - France [http://international.inist.fr/article34.html]
*'''German''' translation carried out by Technischen Informationsbibliothek (TIB), Hannover - Germany
*'''Spanish''' - translation carried out by Universidad de Salamanca - Spain

The GLISC guidelines and the impact of grey literature on science communication were also appreciated by the [[European Association of Science Editors]] which included a chapter on grey literature in their Science Editor's Handbook. 
The use of GLISC guidelines is also supported by the European [[NECOBELAC Project]] [http://www.necobelac.eu Necobelac] financed by the European Commission within the [7 Framework program], by the US National Library of Medicine [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/services/research_report_guide.html], by the German National Library of Science and Technology [https://web.archive.org/web/20120222064451/http://www.tib-hannover.de/en/special-collections/reports-germany/] and by the French Academic Agency of Francophony [http://www.infotheque.info/ressource/9736.html].

Next steps for updating the GLISC Guidelines could be:
*Adding an Appendix on metadata
*Creating a Subject index 
*Providing more technical advice on digital format
*Facilitating reference
The Guidelines should be considered as a suggested model rather than a model in itself; they represent a basic step to improve quality in the different stages of GL production in view of its wider electronic circulation. The proposals for their updating will make them more effective, although a regular revision is required to keep pace with the changing ITC scenarios and information policies (see De Castro et al. 2006).

== On the development of the GLISC Guidelines ==

'''*Electronic grey literature'''
The “Nancy style” is mostly paper oriented, because editorial consistency and ethical considerations recommended for traditional documents do apply also to digital publications. Yet, progressively more and more GL is being produced, stored, published and made available electronically and in order to manage relevant GL publications, [[metadata]] are required. The importance of metadata, as the natural evolution of library catalogue records, had been already stressed in the first version of the “Nancy style” (when dealing with report structure: Section 4.2 of the Guidelines), but no metadata schema was then provided since it was difficult to find a formula that would satisfy all requirements. At present, much GL is catalogued using the [[Dublin Core]] Metadata Standard (DC). However – as Keith Jeffery of the UK Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils ([[CCLRC]]) pointed out working on the “Nancy style” draft – this standard suffers from several problems: a) it is machine-readable but not machine-understandable; b) it does not have a formalised syntax or semantics and therefore is open to ambiguous interpretations. Therefore, he proposed a formalised metadata standard (an umbrella standard, mainly generated from [[Dublin Core]] metadata: “Formalised DC” based on the concepts of the [[CERIF]] Model ([http://www.eurocris.org/Cerif]). Yet, as the traditional cataloguing practice has different rules, similarly different communities may adopt different metadata schema. Nowadays the [[World Wide Web]] provides the possibility to search for information across heterogeneous archives/databases/catalogues, but the systems managing different information resources must be “interoperable” (capable to work together), and [[interoperability]] requires that the same metadata schema be used. As Stefania Biagioni (of the Italian Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell’Informazione - [[ISTI]], [[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche]]) clearly commented, there is much work towards [[standardization]] and the Dublin Core Initiative ([http://dublincore.org/]) is receiving worldwide consensus as it suggests adding a very simple metadata record to any specialized one.

'''*Adoption strategy'''
When consensus was to be reached to release the first version of the Guidelines, a formal approval was asked to all organizations wishing to officially adopt them. Contrary to expectations, consensus was given only by a small number of institutions as the official adoption was sometimes a difficult step. Yet, support and encouragement did not lack: a less formal approach in launching the Guidelines and getting them adopted was soon granted by all institutions involved in their creation. For example, a large international organization (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development - [[OECD]]), which took part in the development of the Guidelines, expressed concern to officially endorse them (and in fact, it did not), because that would require a great deal of internal debate and discussion with their own members. Suggestions were made to follow a voluntary system backed up by an official recognition of compliance to facilitate the adoption of the Guidelines. This would encourage like-minded supporters within an organisation to informally use the Guidelines and then gain the official “stamp of approval” to show that they are really following them. Actually, other organizations policies take a voluntary approach in the documents they recommend, such as the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers ([[ALPSP]]) with more than 230 not-for-profit publishers. As suggested by the OECD, voluntary sign-up is a less demanding step for organisations to take, but the effect is the same – more and more publishers will opt to use them.

'''Herbert Kroemer''' (born August 25, 1928), a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], received his Ph.D. in [[theoretical physics]] in 1952 from the [[University of Göttingen]], Germany, with a dissertation on [[hot electron]] effects in the then-new [[transistor]], setting the stage for a career in research on the physics of [[semiconductor device]]s. In 2000, Kroemer, along with [[Zhores I. Alferov]], was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] "for developing semiconductor heterostructures used in high-speed- and opto-electronics".  The other co-recipient of the Nobel Prize was [[Jack Kilby]] for his invention and development of integrated circuits and micro-chips.

He worked in a number of research laboratories in [[Germany]] and the [[United States]] and taught [[electrical engineering]] at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] from 1968 to 1976. He joined the UCSB faculty in 1976, focusing its semiconductor research program on the emerging compound semiconductor technology rather than on mainstream [[silicon]] technology.

Kroemer was elected as a member of the [[National Academy of Engineering]] in 1997 and the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 2003. He always preferred to work on problems that are ahead of [[mainstream]] [[technology]]. In the 1950s, he invented the [[drift-field transistor|drift transistor]] and was the first to point out that advantages could be gained in various semiconductor devices by incorporating [[heterojunction]]s. Most notably, in 1963 he proposed the concept of the double-[[heterostructure]] [[laser]], which is now a central concept in the field of semiconductor lasers. Kroemer became an early pioneer in [[molecular beam epitaxy]], concentrating on applying the technology to untried new materials.

Along with [[Charles Kittel]] he co-authored the popular textbook [https://books.google.com/books/about/Thermal_Physics.html?id=c0R79nyOoNMC ''Thermal Physics''], first published in 1980, and still used today.  He is also the author of the textbook ''Quantum Mechanics for Engineering, Materials Science and Applied Physics''.&lt;ref&gt;H. Kroemer, Quantum Mechanics, Prentice Hall (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

Kroemer is an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;Kroemer, Herbert. "Herbert Kroemer – Science Video Interview". Interviewer: "You have no belief in a afterlife?" Kroemer: "That's correct." Interviewer: "...You don't see the evidence of a designer?" Kroemer: "No, I don't." Interviewer: "Could you say more about it?" Kroemer: "I think it's just wishful thinking."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9600">The '''history of the [[University of Tehran]]''' goes back to the days of [[Dar ul-Funun (Persia)|Dar ul-Funun]] and the [[Qajar dynasty]]. The modern university as it is today was formally established in 1934.

==Foundations==
[[Image:Iranian film logo.jpg|thumb|right|80px|Click '''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjk9qP8Eli8 here]''' for videoclip about University of Tehran.]]Most Faculties of the University of Tehran were created by integrating already existing higher education institutions such as [[Dar ul-Funun (Persia)|Dar al-Funun]].

The "Faculty of Medicine" for example, was particularly the successor to the Dar al-Funun Department of Medicine, established in 1851, which had become the School of Medicine (Madreseh-ye tebb) in 1919.&lt;ref name="pezeškī"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= KARĀMATĪ  |first=YŪNOS  | title= FACULTIES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF TEHRAN v. Faculty of Medicine | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica | accessdate=2012-09-17|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/faculties-v}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Charles Oberling]], a well-known French [[pathology|pathologist]], was appointed as dean of the Faculty in 1939. Oberling was instrumental in bringing the hospitals of [[Tehran]] under the direct control of the Faculty of Medicine of the university.

The "Faculty of Agriculture" as another example, was founded on the basis of three previously established schools. The first was the ''Mozaffar School of Agronomy'' (the first modern agricultural school in Persia) which was itself founded in 1900 under the direction of a Belgian agricultural expert named ''Dascher''. The second was the ''Farmers School of Karaj'', which was founded in 1918 under the direction of an Austrian by the name of Hans Schricker. The third was the ''School of Agronomy and Rural Industries'' (Madreseh-ye alee-e felahat va sanāye'-e rustāee).&lt;ref name=" kešāvarzī"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=  MAHDAWĪ ARDABĪLĪ  |first=MOḤAMMAD-ḤASAN  | title= FACULTIES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF TEHRAN i. Faculty of Agriculture | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica | accessdate=2012-09-17|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/faculties-i}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Faculty of Fine Arts and Architecture" was founded by absorbing the ''School of Applied Arts and Crafts'' (Madreseh-ye sanāye' va honar), which had been founded by the famous painter [[Kamal-ol-molk]], with the ''School of Architecture'' (Madreseh-ye alee-e me'mari). The first director of the College (or ''Honarkadeh'' as it came to be called) was [[Andre Godard]], the French archaeologist and architect.&lt;ref&gt;M. Marefat. ''"The Protagonists who Shaped Modern Tehran"'', in Ch. Adle and B. Hourcade, eds. Teheran, capitale bicentenaire, Paris and Tehran, 1992, pp. 105-108.&lt;/ref&gt; The College was closely modeled on the French [[École des Beaux-Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Marefat. ''"The Protagonists who Shaped Modern Tehran"'', in Ch. Adle and B. Hourcade, eds. Teheran, capitale bicentenaire, Paris and Tehran, 1992, pp. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Faculty of Law and Political Science" was founded with the merger of the [[Tehran School of Political Sciences|''Tehran School of Political Sciences'' (Madreseh-ye olum-e siyasi)]] which itself had been founded in 1899, with the ''School of Law'' (Madreseh-ye alee-e hoquq), which had been established in 1918. [[Adolphe Perney]] (a French advisor of the Ministry) was appointed as dean, and the Faculty was directed by a cadre of capable Iranian and Western academics such as [[Dehkhoda]], [[Gild Brand]] (from Russia), [[Sayyed Mohammad Taddayon]] (a Minister), [[Julian Lafin]] (a Frenchman), and [[Mirza Javad Khan Ameri]], among many others.

==Formal establishment==
The first official step for the establishment of Tehran University occurred on March 31, 1931 when Minister of Court Abdolhossein [[Teymourtash]] wrote Issa Sadiq who was completing his doctoral dissertataion at Columbia University in New York to inquire as to requirements for the establishment of a University in Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;David Menashri, Education and the Making of Modern Iran (Cornell University Press, 1992) page 145&lt;/ref&gt; Sadiq considered the letter an invitation to outline a comprehensive scheme for the establishment of a University.

[[Image:OpeningCeremony-TehranUMedicine.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Faculty of Medicine commencement ceremony with [[Reza Shah]].]]
In January 1933, during the cabinet meeting, the subject was brought up.&lt;ref name="HEKMAT"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=EIr   |first= | title= HEKMAT, ʿALI-AṢḠAR | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica | accessdate=2012-09-17|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hekmat-ali-asgar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali Asghar Hekmat, the acting minister of the Ministry of Education stated the following words there:
:''Of course, there is no doubt on the thriving state and the glory of the capital, but the only obvious deficiency is that this city has no "university". It is a pity that this city lags far behind other great countries of the world.&lt;ref name="HEKMAT"/&gt;''

His words had a profound impact on everyone in the meeting, resulting in the acceptance of the proposal. Thus allocating an initial budget of 250,000 [[Iranian toman|Tomans]], the Ministry of Education was authorized to find a suitable land for the establishment of the university and take necessary measures to construct the building as soon as possible.

Ali Asghar Hekmat in collaboration and consultation with Andre Godard, a French skillful architect - who was serving the Ministry of Education as an engineer, promptly began looking for a suitable location for the University grounds. By the orders of [[Reza Shah]], the compound of Jalaliyeh garden was selected. Jalaliyeh garden was located in the north of the then Tehran between Amirabad village and the northern trench of Tehran. This beautiful garden, full of orchards was founded in the early 1900s during the final years of [[Nasereddin Shah|Nasir ad- Din Shah]], by the order of Prince Jalal ad-dawlah.

The master plan of the campus buildings was drawn up by French architects [[Roland Dubrulle]] and [[Maxime Siroux]], Swiss architect [[Alexandre Moser]], as well as [[Andre Godard]], Nicolai Markov and [[Foroughi|Mohsen Foroughi]]. The influences of early 20th century [[Modernism|modernist]] architecture are today readily visible on the main campus grounds of the University.

The University of Tehran officially inaugurated in 1934. The Amir-abad (North Karegar) campus was added in 1945 after American troops left the property as World War II was coming to an end.

The university admitted [[Persian women|women]] as students for the first time in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Lorentz, J. ''Historical Dictionary of Iran''. 1995. {{ISBN|0-8108-2994-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further growth and expansion==

After the 1940s, the university increasingly began moving away from the French influence and started modeling its structure and curricula after American universities. Many colleges and faculties were either assisted by academic institutions in the United States, or were directly led by American universities: The "Faculty of Agriculture" for example, was largely expanded with the assistance of the [[University of Utah]].&lt;ref name="kešāvarzī"/&gt;

In 1954, the "Institute of Business Administration" (Mo'assaseh-ye olum-e edari) was established with the help of the [[University of Southern California]], directed by Harry Marlow of USC, offering masters and Ph.D degrees. That institute is the current Tehran University Faculty of Management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://management.ut.ac.ir/fa/Other/history.asp Template 7&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225220501/http://management.ut.ac.ir/fa/Other/history.asp |date=2007-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, the "Institute of Journalism" (Mo'asseseh-ye ruz-nameh negari) was founded with cooperation of [[James Wellard]] of the [[University of Virginia]].

In 1965, a post doctoral program of [[cytopathology]] was inaugurated with the assistance of [[Johns Hopkins University]].

And in 1971, construction of a new building designed by Abdolaziz Farmanfarmayan was completed, which housed the University's main Central Library which today holds nearly 700,000 volumes, a large collection of Persian manuscripts, many of them unique, as well as 1800 periodicals from all over the world.

==Secession of the College of Medicine==
In 1986, by legislation of the [[Majlis of Iran|National Parliament]], the university's oversized College of Medicine separated into the independent [[Tehran University of Medical Sciences]] (TUMS), coming under the new Ministry of Health and Medical Education. The university (TUMS) is currently Iran's most prestigious medical school with 13,000 students.

[[Tehran University of Medical Sciences]] however publishes all its scientific research under the name "University of Tehran" and continues to enjoy close relations with Tehran University's main campus.&lt;ref&gt;Link: http://www.mehrnews.com/fa/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsID=445096&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11037">'''Japanese language education in Mongolia''' formally dates back to 1975, when the [[National University of Mongolia]] established an elective course in [[Japanese language]]. A 2003 survey found 199 teachers teaching 9,080 students of Japanese at 67 different institutions.&lt;ref name="2003Survey"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Japan Foundation |title=2003年海外日本語教育機関調査結果: モンゴル (Results of the 2003 survey of overseas Japanese language educational institutions: Mongolia) |url=http://www.jpf.go.jp/j/japan_j/oversea/kunibetsu/2005/mongolia.html |date=2005 |accessdate=2007-08-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929124640/http://www.jpf.go.jp/j/japan_j/oversea/kunibetsu/2005/mongolia.html |archivedate=2007-09-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opportunities and motivations for study==
The study of Japanese in Mongolia, in common with the study of [[English language|English]] and [[German language]], began to expand early in the 1990s in the so-called "language boom" which occurred as the country began to liberalise. In the 1970s and 1980s, only 3-5 students enrolled each year in the single Japanese course offered by the National University of Mongolia; Mongolians who went to Japan as international scholarship students typically had little language preparation beforehand, and took courses at the [[Osaka University of Foreign Studies]] to catch up before beginning their subject-area studies. However, the situation began to improve in the late 1980s, when NUM established an evening course in Japanese, and in 1989, when two more non-school institutions began offering Japanese courses.&lt;ref name="Tsuchiya"/&gt; NUM established a full [[academic major|major]] in the subject in 1990; one school also began offering Japanese language instruction to primary and secondary students that year.&lt;ref name="2003Survey"/&gt;

The [[Ministry of Education (Mongolia)|Ministry of Education]] has not established a standardised curriculum for Japanese language instruction at the secondary levels, as it has for the mandatory foreign languages of English and [[Russian language|Russian]].&lt;ref name="Tsuchiya"/&gt; Primary and secondary students compose only 13.6% of all students of Japanese in the country; the rest are divided roughly equally between institutions of higher education and non-school institutions. However, the student-teacher ratios are much more favourable in institutions of higher education, with roughly 33 students per teacher, as compared to 109 students per teacher in non-school institutions.&lt;ref name="2003Survey"/&gt; Textbooks in use mainly consist of those donated by the [[Japan Foundation]]; the beginners' textbook {{nihongo|''Nihongo Shoho''|日本語初歩|}} is one of the more popular ones. A textbook aimed specifically at Mongolian learners was published in July 1996.&lt;ref name="Tsuchiya"/&gt;

Common motivations for language learning include the desire to study in Japan, to understand [[Japanese culture]], and to learn about Japanese technology; tourism and the desire to learn about Japanese politics in contrast were not widely cited as reasons for learning the language.&lt;ref name="2003Survey"/&gt; Teachers feel there are a sufficient number of beginning and intermediate level courses, but not enough advanced-level courses.&lt;ref name="Muraue"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jpf.go.jp/j/learn_j/voice_j/higashi_asia/mongolia/2003/report01.html|title=モンゴル日本センターから (From the Mongolia-Japan Centre)|last=Murakami|first=Yoshifumi|year=2003|periodical=The Japan Foundation Newsletter|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929124714/http://www.jpf.go.jp/j/learn_j/voice_j/higashi_asia/mongolia/2003/report01.html|archivedate=2007-09-29|accessdate=2009-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language-based difficulties==
Mongolian grammar is somewhat similar to that of Japanese. Most Mongolian case markers have direct parallels among [[Japanese particles]], but, for example, the [[nominative case]] in Mongolian is unmarked, and the [[objective case|objective-case]] marker is sometimes dropped, especially when the object is [[Definiteness|definite]]; beginning Mongolian learners of Japanese carry the same habits over into Japanese, resulting in errors. One distinction that is difficult for learners in Mongolia is that between the [[locative case|locative]] particles  ''[[Japanese particles#ni|ni]]'' and ''[[Japanese particles#de|de]]'', used respectively to describe the location of existence and the location of the action of a verb; Mongolian does not distinguish between the two. The usage of verbs for "to come" and "to go" also differs slightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=モンゴル人に対する日本語教育の研究: モンゴル人学生の誤用例を中心に (A Study of Teaching Japanese to Mongolian Students: Based on Errors Made by Mongolian Students)|first=Yukie|last=Kobayashi|date=16 March 1981|journal=Nihongogakkō Ronshū|issue=8|pages=25–38|url=http://repository.tufs.ac.jp/bitstream/10108/20539/1/jls008003.pdf|accessdate=2007-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expectation of most learners of Japanese in Mongolia is that courses should focus on the teaching of [[kanji]], to the exclusion of other aspects of the language; teachers report that this is especially a problem due to pressure from parents of students at the elementary and secondary levels.&lt;ref name="Tsuchiya"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tsuchiya, Chihiro|author2=S. Dolgor|url=http://www.jicef.or.jp/wahec/ful307.htm|title=Present and Future Situation of Japanese Language Teaching in Mongolia|publisher=Japan International Cultural Exchange Foundation|date=1997|accessdate=2007-08-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009200556/http://www.jicef.or.jp/wahec/ful307.htm|archivedate=2007-10-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Japanese Language Proficiency Test]] has been offered in Mongolia since 2000.&lt;ref name="2003Survey"/&gt; As of 2006, it was offered only in [[Ulan Bator]]. The number of examinees rose by 75% between 2003 and 2006; as in [[China]] and [[South Korea]], but differing from other [[Asia]]n countries, the Level 2 examination, aimed at students who have completed 600 contact hours of instruction, is the most widely attempted, and the Level 4 examination, aimed at beginning students with 150 contact hours of instruction, is the least popular.&lt;ref name="JLPT2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JLPT2003"/&gt; [[JETRO]]'s Business Japanese Test was not offered in Mongolia as of 2006.&lt;ref name="JETROStats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jetro.go.jp/en/bjt/data/jlrt/pdf/res13report_en.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |title=13th JLRT (2006): A Summary Report |publisher=Japan External Trade Organization |date=2006 |accessdate=2006-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192906/http://www.jetro.go.jp/en/bjt/data/jlrt/pdf/res13report_en.pdf |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LaunchCode''' is a non-profit organization based in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], that works with hundreds of companies to set up paid apprenticeships in technology for talented people who lack the traditional credentials to land a good job.&lt;ref name="cbslocal"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2013/09/24/launchcode-flooded-with-applications-from-aspiring-tech-talent/ |title= LaunchCode Flooded With Applications From Aspiring Tech Talent &amp;laquo; CBS St. Louis |publisher= stlouis.cbslocal.com |date= 2013-09-24 |accessdate= 2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-founded in 2013 by [[Square, Inc.]] co-founder [[Jim McKelvey]], Dan Lohman, Zach Lou, Brendan Lind, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= LaunchCode 1023 |url= https://www.scribd.com/document/337800353/LaunchCode-Form-1023 |website= scribd |date= |accessdate= 28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaunchCode was named by the ''St. Louis Riverfront Times'' as 2014's "The Best Thing to Happen to St. Louis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Best Thing to Happen to St. Louis St. Louis 2014 - LaunchCode |url= http://www.riverfronttimes.com/bestof/2014/award/best-thing-to-happen-to-st-louis-2448715/ |website= Riverfront Times |accessdate= 6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, LaunchCode opened an office in [[Miami, Florida]], to serve southeast Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Addressing tech-talent gap, LaunchCode to expand to Miami |url= http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article4541701.html |website= Miami Herald |accessdate= 13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creation ==
[[File:LaunchCode_CS50x.jpg|thumb|right|The first LaunchCode + edX CS50x class. This opening day of the class had over 800 people.]]
McKelvey and Lind say LaunchCode was an attempt to remedy a problem they saw in St. Louis:

:“Every year the IT talent shortage worsens. This is partially due to increasing demand for coders, but it is also due to problems with traditional educational and hiring systems.... Unfortunately, many human resource departments won’t even interview people without a college degree and several years of experience.”  Jim McKelvey and Brendan Lind, edX.org:&lt;ref name="edx"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edx.org/blog/launchcode-edx-team-train-aspiring|title=LaunchCode and edX Team Up to Train Aspiring Coders &amp;#124; edX|publisher=edx.org|accessdate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
LaunchCode’s practice is founded upon finding intelligent, hardworking people who need jobs and giving them skills and opportunities to get them. Candidates do not necessarily need to have a background in computer science.&lt;ref name="riverfronttimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/dailyrft/2014/01/launch_code_program_apprentice_terrence_bowen.php|title=Launch Code: How 42 &amp;quot;Unqualified&amp;quot; People Landed Dream Tech Jobs in St. Louis|publisher=blogs.riverfronttimes.com|accessdate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The LaunchCode Apprenticeship ==

Once placed in a LaunchCode position, a candidate works at another company in an apprenticeship, where he or she is paired with a mentor and given training on the job. LaunchCode encourages companies to use [[pair programming]], which allows an inexperienced programmer to learn from a more senior one. Ideally, at the end of this 2- to 3-month apprenticeship, the candidate will be hired by the company.&lt;ref name="cbslocal"/&gt;

Peter Downs wrote in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'',

:“One key element to a competitive workforce almost entirely overlooked in the U.S. is apprenticeships. These days, American businesses typically want someone else—trade schools, community colleges, universities or even the federal government—to train their future employees. If potential future job seekers haven't been provided with the training they need, many businesses expect job seekers to take all the responsibility on themselves, often taking on serious debt without any guarantee of future employment.”&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304617404579304913308674896?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702304617404579304913308674896.html|title=Peter Downs: Can&amp;#39;t Find Skilled Workers? Start an Apprentice Program|publisher=online.wsj.com|accessdate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; “There are glimmers of hope that the U.S.—or at least some savvy industries—might be starting to embrace apprenticeship. In St. Louis, technology entrepreneur Jim McKelvey convinced several large employers last year—including Enterprise, [[Monsanto]], and [[Rawlings (company)|Rawlings]] —that it doesn't take a college education to become good at computer programming. What it takes is working with an experienced programmer.”

McKelvey said that if LaunchCode is successful, "I believe that we’ll actually create a talent surplus, then you’ll start to see companies moving to this region to take advantage of that surplus.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lloyd|first1=Tim|title=Square founder hopes to turn St. Louis into the Silicon Prairie|url=http://www.marketplace.org/topics/economy/square-founder-hopes-turn-st-louis-silicon-prairie|website=Marketplace|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the first round, LaunchCode is placing coders at 100 companies, including Enterprise Holdings, MasterCard, Monsanto, Build-a-Bear, and Panera.&lt;ref name="cbslocal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="entrepreneur"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/228000?hootPostID=aebb0ba510abfe6838198f11dcbfc334%20|title=Co-Founder of Square Wants to Save St. Louis, One Programmer at a Time &amp;#124; Entrepreneur.com|publisher=entrepreneur.com|accessdate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== LaunchCode and edX ==

Recognizing a deficit of coders with basic skills, LaunchCode collaborated with [[edX]] to offer free HarvardX programming classes in downtown St. Louis. Jim McKelvey and Brendan Lind explain on edX.org: “To support those who want to learn programming as the first step to a career, LaunchCode is holding city-wide study sessions to support HarvardX’s CS50x Introduction to Computer Science class. By creating peer-groups and supplying mentors, LaunchCode hopes to help more students learn the material.”&lt;ref name="edx"/&gt;

==CoderGirl==
LaunchCode started an all-women's community coding group, CoderGirl, in May 2014 in St. Louis. The group welcomes women programmers of any skill level, from beginners to established developers looking for a group space in which to work. Mentors are available to assist with specific programming questions and problems, as well as serve as a broader community supporting women in technology fields. By fostering a network of support, LaunchCode and CoderGirl hope to diminish the hiring gap in technology fields, and provide pathways to employment.
&lt;gallery&gt;

In the post-[[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]] era, the role of libraries in providing information and services to [[LGBTQ]] individuals has been a topic of discussion among library professionals. Libraries can often play an important role for LGBTQ individuals looking to find information about coming out, health, and family topics, as well as leisure reading.&lt;ref name="keilty"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keilty|first=Patrick|title=Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Information Needs|journal=Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science, 3rd Edition|year=2009|pages=3275–3280}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past forty years, advocate organizations for LGBTQ content in libraries have emerged, and numerous theorists have discussed various aspects of LGBTQ library service including privacy concerns, programming, collection development considerations and librarian/staff education needs, as well as special services for juvenile and teen patrons.

==History==

Commensurate with the [[LGBT social movements|LGBT rights movement]] in other arenas, LGBTQ activists began visibly advocating for greater representation in libraries in 1969.&lt;ref name ="keilty" /&gt; In 1970, the Task Force on Gay Liberation formed within the [[American Library Association]]. Now known as the [[Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Round Table|GLBT Round Table]], this organization is the oldest LGBTQ professional organization in the United States.&lt;ref name="keilty" /&gt; [[Barbara Gittings]] became its coordinator in 1971. She pushed the American Library Association for more visibility for gays and lesbians in the profession. She staffed a kissing booth at the Dallas convention of the ALA, underneath the banner "Hug a Homosexual," with a "women only" side and a "men only" side. When no one took advantage of it, she and ''[[Patience and Sarah]]'' author [[Alma Routsong]] (pen name: Isabel Miller) kissed in front of rolling television cameras. In describing its success, despite most of the reaction being negative, Gittings said, "We needed to get an audience. So we decided, let's show gay love live. We were offering free—mind you, free—same-sex kisses and hugs. Let me tell you, the aisles were mobbed, but no one came into the booth to get a free hug. So we hugged and kissed each other. It was shown twice on the evening news, once again in the morning. It put us on the map."

In the early 1970s, the Task Force on Gay Liberation campaigned to have books about the gay liberation movement at the Library of Congress reclassified from HQ 71–471 (“Abnormal Sexual Relations, Including Sexual Crimes”). In 1972, after receiving a letter requesting the reclassification, the Library of Congress agreed to make the shift, reclassifying those books into a newly created category, HQ 76.5 (“Homosexuality, Lesbianism—Gay Liberation Movement, Homophile Movement”).

Barbara Gittings  July 31, 1932 – February 18, 1972
Gay rights pioneer Barbara Gittings advocated for a revolution in the inclusion and cataloging of LGBTQ materials in public libraries to create a more positive, supportive, informative environment for all members of the community.

In the 1980s, literature began to emerge which examined information seeking behaviors of gay and lesbian library patrons. The 1981 book ''The Joy of Cataloging'' by [[Sanford Berman]] outlined the difficulties of accessing gay and lesbian books and information.&lt;ref name="keilty" /&gt; In 1988, the Task Force on Gay Liberation released the “International thesaurus of gay and lesbian index terms,” aimed at standardizing terms used for cataloging gay and lesbian-related library materials, and making [[Library of Congress Subject Headings]] friendlier for use by gay and lesbian archives.&lt;ref name=vocab&gt;{{cite web|title=GLBT Controlled Vocabularies and Classification Schemes|url=http://www.ala.org/glbtrt/popularresources/vocab|publisher=American Library Association|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four years later, in 1992, Ellen Greenblatt and Cal Gough published the first collection of essays about the information needs of gay and lesbian patrons, entitled ''Gay and Lesbian Library Service''. The work has since been revised as ''Serving LGBTIQ Library and Archives Users'' and remains influential.&lt;ref name="keilty" /&gt;

In 1992, American Libraries published a photo of the Gay and Lesbian Task Force (now the [[GLBT Round Table]]) on the cover of its July/August issue, drawing both criticism and praise from the library world.&lt;ref name=glodoski&gt;{{cite web|last=Glodoski|first=K.|title=1992 Controversy: "American Libraries" highlight GLBTF on cover of July/August issue; members take issue.|url=http://libraryhistory.pbworks.com/w/page/16964638/Gay,%20Lesbian,%20Bisexual%20Task%20Force%20(GLBTF)|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commenters called the cover “in poor taste” and accused American Libraries of “glorifying homosexuality,” while others were supportive of the move. Christine Williams, who wrote an essay about the controversy surrounding the cover, concluded that in the mid-90s, the library world was “not an especially welcoming place to gays and lesbians."&lt;ref name =glodoski /&gt;

In 2007, the Rainbow Project Task Force began within the ALA to promote the presence of LGBTQ juvenile and young adult literature in library collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The LGBT movements and libraries|url=http://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/141080/The-LGBT-movements-and-Libraries|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group now maintains an annotated bibliography of LGBTQ titles for youth and teens, as well the yearly Rainbow List featuring the best of LGBTQ YA and children’s titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Rainbow Books|url=http://glbtrt.ala.org/rainbowbooks/about|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the GLBT Round Table announced a new committee, the Over the Rainbow Committee. This committee annually compiles a bibliography of books that show the GLBT community in a favorable light and reflects the interests of adults. The bibliographies provide guidance to libraries in the selection of positive GLBT materials.

After the passage of [[Same-sex marriage in New York|equal marriage in the State of New York]] in 2011, the Research Library at the [[Buffalo History Museum]] in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo, N.Y.]] became the first known library in the United States to collect wedding memorabilia from legally-wed same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wedding memorabilia made historic |url=http://mybuffalopride.com/news/item/204-wedding-memorabilia-made-historic.html |accessdate=2015-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713153619/http://mybuffalopride.com/news/item/204-wedding-memorabilia-made-historic.html |archivedate=2015-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==

===Privacy===

In their 2006 study of LGBTQ book circulation in an academic library, Stephanie Mathson and Jeffery Hancks found that LGBTQ titles were 20% more likely to circulate via a [[self-checkout]] machine than a traditional circulation desk staffed by a person.&lt;ref name=mathson&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mathson | first1 = Stephanie | last2 = Hancks | first2 = Jeffrey | year = 2006 | title = Privacy Please? A Comparison between Self-Checkout and Book Checkout Desk Circulation Rates for LGBT and Other Books | url = | journal = Journal of Access Services | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 27–37 | doi=10.1300/j204v04n03_02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their sample size was small, so study results may be inconclusive.&lt;ref name=mathson /&gt;

===Need for library staff education===

Providing unbiased service to all patrons is one of the central tenets of the Code of Ethics of the American Library Association.&lt;ref name=alaethics&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Ethics of the American Library Association|url=http://www.ifmanual.org/codeethics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles dating back to Richard Ashby’s 1987 piece entitled ‘Library Services to Lesbian and Gay People’ have argued that this commitment to neutrality should provide the foundation for complete library service for all people, regardless of sexual orientation or gender presentation.&lt;ref name=ashby&gt;Ashby, R. (1987) ‘Library Services to Lesbian and Gay People’, Assistant Librarian. 80 (10): 153–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Ashby argues that libraries, especially in their role as providers of literature for pleasure reading, can support LGBTQ individuals overcome a sense of isolation within the larger community. He emphasizes the importance of staff education to provide all LGBTQ individuals a safe space within the library, including:

*Training staff to work with diverse populations, specifically LGBTQ patrons
*Comprehensive and effective collection development policies for LGBTQ materials
*Librarian education to gain familiarity with publishers or sources for LGBTQ materials, including the utilization of local bookstores or community groups.&lt;ref name=ashby /&gt;

Echoing many of Ashby’s assertions in her 2007 paper entitled “Can Scottish public library services claim they are socially inclusive of all minority groups when lesbian fiction is still so inaccessible?”, Jaqueline Goldthorp outlines some of the challenges that lesbians face when trying to find lesbian fiction in Scottish libraries.&lt;ref name=goldthorp&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldthorp | first1 = J | year = 2007 | title = Can Scottish public library services claim they are socially inclusive of all minority groups when lesbian fiction is still so inaccessible? | url = | journal = Journal of Librarianship and Information Science | volume = 39 | issue = 4| pages = 234–248 | doi = 10.1177/0961000607083215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She ties her study of lesbian literature to the importance of reading fiction on the psychological well-being of women, arguing that women often turn to fiction reading for self-affirmation and identity building.&lt;ref name=goldthorp /&gt; In addition, lesbian fiction titles can be priced up to 30% higher than non-lesbian titles, meaning that, for many low-income or working class lesbians, libraries are the only means of access for these titles&lt;ref name=goldthorp /&gt; Goldthorp surveyed 26 Scottish libraries and found that, in 2007, the majority had less than ten books labelled as “lesbian fiction,” and almost no recent award-winning titles. She suggests diversity training and education about methods and resources for providing service to lesbians for library staff as a way of promoting greater inclusion.

Mehra and Braquet’s 2007 article “Library and Information Science Professionals as Community Action Researchers in an Academic Setting” expands further upon the central role of librarians in promoting LGBTQ acceptance, noting that the profession is “uniquely situated to provide access to LGBT literature and information.”&lt;ref name=braquet&gt;Braquet, Donna, and Bharat Mehra. "Library and Information Science Professionals as Community Action Researchers in an Academic Setting: Top Ten Directions to further Institutional Change for People of Diverse Sexual Orientations and Gender Identities." Library Trends 56.2 (2007): 542-565. Academic OneFile. Web. 4 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection development considerations==

===Barriers===

In a 2005 article in the journal ''Progressive Librarian'', Jennifer Downey argued that even award-winning books by or about LGBTQ individuals fail to make it into library collections.&lt;ref name=downey /&gt; She cites internal censorship as one potential cause, as well as the assumption that library patrons who want LGBTQ titles will simply request them from other libraries via inter-library loan. In addition, she found that many librarians were unfamiliar with LGBTQ titles. To increase familiarity, she recommends reading LGBTQ book review sources and bringing others, including community members into the process, suggestions which she draws from Loverich and Degnan’s 1999 article "Out of the Shelves."&lt;ref name=loverich&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Loverich | first1 = Patricia | last2 = Degnan | first2 = Darrah | year = 1999 | title = Out on the Shelves? Not Really: Gay,  Lesbian, Bisexual Books in Short Supply | url = | journal = Library Journal | volume = 124 | issue = 11| page = 55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Small publishers===

A 2012 ''[[Publisher’s Weekly]]'' article cites the growing diversity of small presses that publish LGBTQ titles, but a decline in the traditional romance and erotica genres.&lt;ref name=bond&gt;Bond, Gwenda. "Breaking Out." Publishers Weekly 259.16 (2012): 26-28. Professional Development Collection. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  The article also discusses the mainstreaming of LGBT literature, though emphasizes that even with wider acceptance of LGBTQ identities, the need for LGBTQ stories has not disappeared and that independent publishers are still the largest producers of LGBTQ literature.&lt;ref name=bond /&gt; In his "Rainbow Family Collections", Jamie Naidoo also discusses challenges facing small specialized publishers of LGBTQ children's books and includes interviews with select publishing houses.&lt;ref&gt;•	Naidoo, Jamie Campbell. (2012). Rainbow Family Collections: Selecting and Using Children's Books with Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Content. Santa Barbara, CA: Libraries Unlimited.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advice for libraries==

*Seek out LGBTQ-specific review sources, such as ''The Lambda Literary Review'', and collection development tools.&lt;ref name=downey&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Downey | first1 = Jennifer | year = 2005 | title = Public Library Collection Development Issues regarding the Information Needs of Glbt Patrons | url = http://www.progressivelibrariansguild.org/content/pdf/Braverman2005.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Progressive Librarian | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 86–95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gardener&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gardner | first1 = C.

*Conduct focus groups with communities to discover needs.&lt;ref name=alexander&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alexander | first1 = Linda B. | last2 = Miselis | first2 = Sarah D. | year = 2007 | title = Barriers to GLBTQ Collection Development and Strategies for Overcoming Them | url = | journal = Young Adult Library Services | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 43–49 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Increase visibility of LGBTQ materials in the library by including them in regular displays or featuring them in pathfinders or book lists.&lt;ref name=downey /&gt;&lt;ref name=gardener /&gt;&lt;ref name=albright&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Albright | first1 = Meagan | year = 2006 | title = The Public Library's Responsibilities to LGBT Communities: Recognizing, Representing, and Serving | url = | journal = Public Libraries | volume = 45 | issue = 5| pages = 52–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Change collection development policies to specifically protect LGBTQ materials.&lt;ref name=gardener /&gt;&lt;ref name=alexander /&gt;&lt;ref name=ritchie&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ritchie | first1 = Catherine J | year = 2001 | title = Collection Development of gay/lesbian/bisexual-Related Adult Non- Fiction in Medium-Sized Illinois Public Libraries | url = | journal = Illinois Libraries | volume = 83 | issue = 2| pages = 39–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Vince Graziano notes that academic libraries should address both "the need for curricular and research materials, inherent in an academic setting, and the need for personal and recreational reading",&lt;ref name="graziano-academic"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graziano|first1=Vince|title=LGBTQ Collection Assessment: Library Ownership of Resources Cited by Master’s Students|journal=College &amp; Research Libraries|date=2016|volume=77|issue=1|pages=114–27|doi=10.5860/crl.77.1.114|url=http://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/980782/1/114.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as "the need for LGBTQ popular periodicals, which may serve a dual purpose."&lt;ref name="graziano-academic" /&gt; These popular periodicals are often overlooked, according to Graziano's study.&lt;ref name="graziano-academic" /&gt;
**A study by Virginia Kay Williams and Nancy Deyoe notes that "many libraries supporting teacher education and library science programs have few or no holdings of recently published LGBTQ-themed youth literature",&lt;ref name="youth-academic-collection"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Virginia|last2=Nancy|first2=Deyoe|title=Controversy and Diversity: LGBTQ Titles in Academic Library Youth Collections|journal=Library Resources &amp;Technical Services|date=April 2015|volume=59|issue=2|pages=62–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; finding that "43 percent of libraries supporting [[National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education|NCATE]] or [[American Library Association|ALA]] accredited programs held fewer than ten [[American Library Association Rainbow List|Rainbow List]] titles".&lt;ref name="youth-academic-collection" /&gt; Williams and Deyoe recommend that libraries perform a targeted collection assessment to see if the needs of students are being met. Collections, and books available through loans, should "reflect a wide range of LGBTQ experiences",&lt;ref name="youth-academic-collection" /&gt; including both "older titles that remain important, and more recent titles so that students can become familiar with titles that reflect changing social trends".&lt;ref name="youth-academic-collection" /&gt;

==LGBTQ, Classification and Subject Headings==

Before the 1960s, the term "homosexuality" was the basic search heading for most libraries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McClary|first=Carrie|title=From "Homosexuality" to "Transvestites": An analysis of subject headings assigned to works of GLBT fiction in Canadian public libraries.|journal=The Canadian Journal of Information and Library Science|volume=31| issue =  2}}&lt;/ref&gt; that adopted the [[Library of Congress Subject Headings]]. According to LGBT librarian Steve Wolf, "homosexuality" was classified under "sexual deviations" until 1972, when it was moved to "sexual life".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title="Sex and the Single Cataloger," in Revolting Librarians|last=Wolf|first=Steve|publisher=Booklegger|year=1972|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, individuals who identify as LGBTQ  have made major strides in reforming the subject headings that many libraries use. The Library of Congress added "Transgender people" and "Transgenderism" as main subject headings in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Matt|date=2010-09-27|title=Transgender Subject Access: History and Current Practice|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01639370903534398|journal=Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly|volume=48|issue=8|pages=661–683|doi=10.1080/01639370903534398|issn=0163-9374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creating new and accurate headings for the LGBTQ community makes it easier for LGBTQ people to find information that is pertinent to their needs. Broadening these official vocabularies to affirm language and identities within the LGBTQ community creates broader acceptance for diverse gender and sexual identities.

Recent literature has approached the issue of library classification from a [[queer theory]] perspective. In her 2013 article "Queering the Catalog: Queer Theory and the Politics of Correction," librarian [[Emily Drabinski]] defines the relationship between LGBTQ identity and the library as a historically contingent one. For Drabinski, "there can be no “correct” categorical or linguistic structures, only those that discursively emerge and circulate in a particular context."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drabinski|first=Emily|date=2013-01-01|title=Queering the Catalog: Queer Theory and the Politics of Correction|jstor=10.1086/669547|journal=The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy|volume=83|issue=2|pages=94–111|doi=10.1086/669547}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drabinski says that a queer approach to cataloging includes [[reference librarian]]s and users, who can engage in dialogue about underlying biases and help dismantle oppressive language. In a 2014 article, Emily Drabinski, [[Amber Billey]] and [[K.R. Roberto]] criticized [[Resource Description and Access|RDA]] Rule 9.7, which forces catalogers to assign a gender when creating authority records, leaving out [[non-binary]] and gender-fluid identities. Marika Cifor uses queer theory to argue that hatred should be used as an organizing principle in LGBT archives. She writes that "examining the arrangement and description
of hate mail and messages, archival collecting around hate crimes, and documenting and describing queer and trans self-hatred demonstrates that hatred is a useful lens for examining and deconstructing normative power and its affective circulations and structures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cifor|first1=Marika|title=Aligning Bodies: Collecting, Arranging, and Describing Hatred for a Critical Queer Archives|journal=Library Trends|date=Spring 2016|volume=64|issue=4|pages=756–775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== LGBTQ children and teen services ==
[[File:2018 LGBTQ Pride Display.jpg|thumb|A 2018 display of young adult books featuring LGBTQ+ characters or themes at the Barbara S. Ponce Public Library in Pinellas Park, FL.]]
Alexander Parks and others have identified libraries as potentially important safe places for LGBTQ youth and teens, especially in the face of bullying.&lt;ref name=parks&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parks | first1 = Alexander F | year = 2012 | title = Opening the Gate | url = | journal = Young Adult Library Services | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 22–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests the inclusion of LGBTQ titles in library displays or book talks to promote greater visibility. However, according to a 2005 study by Ann Curry, though many LGBTQ teens have the very similar concerns to their adult counterparts, librarians often do not answer their questions related to LGBTQ topics in a sensitive or welcoming manner.&lt;ref name=curry&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Curry | first1 = Ann | year = 2005 | title = If I Ask, Will they Answer? | url = | journal = Reference &amp; User Services Quarterly | volume = 45 | issue = 1| pages = 65–75 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies by Carmichael and Greenblatt have emphasized that the library is an important place for teens who are coming out to find information because of the potential anonymity it provides.&lt;ref name=curry /&gt; In his examination of public libraries in areas with large concentrations of same-sex families, Naidoo finds that many children's librarians are unaware of the LGBTQ families in their community and provide a mixed-bag of services, collections, and programs.&lt;ref&gt;Naidoo, Jamie. (2013). Over the rainbow and under the radar: Library services and programs to LGBTQ families, Children and Libraries, 11(3), 34-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Young Adult Library Services Association]]'s information for being welcoming and inclusionary of trans teens at library programs offering a time for students to give their preferred names or pronouns when starting a program gives them the opportunity to let staff and fellow patrons know how they would prefer to be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ala.org/yalsa/sites/ala.org.yalsa/files/content/events/supporting%20trans%20teens.pdf |publisher=Young Adult Library Services Association |accessdate=10/27/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Impact of the Internet===

LGBTQ individuals were some of the early adopters of the internet, and are still represented in high percentages across social media.&lt;ref name=greenblatt&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenblatt|first=Ellen|title=Serving LGBTIQ Library and Archives Users : essays on outreach, service, collections and access|year=2011|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.|isbn=9780786448944}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In addition, 55% of LGBTQ individuals who responded to a 2009 survey said that they read blogs, compared to 38% of heterosexual respondents.&lt;ref name=greenblatt /&gt; The internet can often be influential to young people seeking information about health, coming out, or to find community, but can also put teens at risk of [[cyberbullying]] or harassment.&lt;ref name=czarnecki&gt;{{cite web|last=Czarnecki|first=Kelly|title=Recent GLBT Teen Tragedies - What Can We Do?|url=http://yalsa.ala.org/blog/2010/10/06/recent-glbt-teen-tragedies-what-can-we-do/|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some libraries and schools, notably the school district in Camdenton, Mo, have been ordered to remove internet filtering software that blocked access to LGBTQ friendly websites that teens often turn to for support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Winerip|first=Michael|title=Missouri School District Told to Replace Filter Blocking Pro-Gay Sites|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/26/education/missouri-school-district-questioned-over-anti-gay-web-filter.html|accessdate=13 December 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==User studies related to LGBTQ library service==

===Creelman and Harris (1990)===

	Possibly the first study to provide a comprehensive overview of the information needs of non-heterosexual people, Creelman and Harris’ article focused on lesbians' information needs at specific points in their lives.&lt;ref name=creelman&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Creelman | first1 = J.A.E. | last2 = Harris | first2 = R.M. | year = 1990 | title = Coming out: The information needs of lesbians | url = | journal = Collection Building | volume = 10 | issue = 3–4| pages = 37–41 | doi = 10.1108/eb023281 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They used a sense-making model which considered lesbians' information needs within a particular context. Their data came from a series of 50 interviews with lesbian women who were part of a lesbian group in Toronto, Canada, and used the snowball sampling approach to recruit additional participants.  Eighty-four percent of interviewees said that they were aware of the library as a source of information related to lesbian identities, compared to 62% who were aware of gay bars and 58% aware of gay and lesbian organizations,. However, the authors found many respondents were frustrated with the negative or male-centric literature that made up the bulk of information available in libraries; libraries needed to ensure that information was readily available, current and positive to best serve lesbian populations.

===Whitt (1993)===

	Alisa Whitt’s 1993 study also focused on the information needs of lesbians and what lesbians expected from the library during different life stages.&lt;ref name=whitt&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whitt | first1 = A.J. | year = 1993 | title = The information needs of lesbians | url = | journal = Library and Information Science Research | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 275–288 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitt collected data by sending out a survey via a lesbian newsletter that circulated in North Carolina, which drew 141 respondents.

	For many lesbians who responded to Whitt’s survey, the library was the most important source for locating information during the initial stages of coming out, especially in remote areas without a visible community. Whitt determined three shifts in the type of information desired by respondents, from early in the coming out process to a later, more established identity. She found that information needs went from broad to specifically focused, from factual or non-fiction to entertainment or fiction and that respondents became more discerning about the information they needed with age.

	Many respondents who never used the library cited embarrassment or lack of knowledge about available information as reasons. Even those that did frequent the library often said that they were too embarrassed to ask for help; many expected shocked reactions or outright homophobia from librarians. Some common complaints about library collections from those who did use them were that information was negative, outdated or difficult to find. Whitt concluded that more staff training was needed to address these perceptions. She also found that those respondents who regularly used a college or university library had a more positive experience finding needed information than those who used only the public library.

===Joyce and Schrader (1997)===

In the first user study specifically addressed towards gay males, Joyce and Schrader studied perceptions of the library system in Edmonton, Canada.&lt;ref name=joyce&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Joyce | first1 = S.L.P. | last2 = Schrader | first2 = A.M. | year = 1997 | title = Hidden perceptions: Edmonton gay males and the Edmonton Public Library | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Information and Library Sciences | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 19–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using an anonymous questionnaire distributed to gay community organizations, the authors collected data on 21 questions related to three aspects of information seeking: personal information, information needs related to coming out and ongoing information needs. The survey had 47 respondents who had a generally high level of education.

	The library was the most often cited resource of information related to coming out and for ongoing needs, followed by gay organizations and friends. When asked what types of materials respondents borrowed from the library, they most frequently cited music, followed by nonfiction and fiction. However, respondents had an overall negative impression about the amount of information related to gay males contained in the library, and suggested the need for expanding the gay collection, networking with gay and lesbian organizations and subscribing to gay magazines.

	Joyce and Schrader found similarities between their study and the ones by Whitt and Creelman and Harris which came before it. Some of the common themes included the importance of the library, especially in the early stages of coming out, the need for more specific information over time and the general lack of services.

===Norman (1999)===

Norman’s 1999 study provides quantitative analysis of survey responses from 44 self-identified lesbian, gay and bisexual individuals using the [[Brighton and Hove]] (UK) public libraries.&lt;ref name=norman&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Norman | first1 = M | year = 1999 | title = Out on loan: A survey of the use and information needs of users of the lesbian, gay and bisexual collection of Brighton and Hove libraries | url = | journal = Journal of Librarianship and Information Science | volume = 31 | issue = 4| pages = 188–196 | doi=10.1177/096100069903100402}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey was aimed at identifying five aspects of the libraries’ LGB users, including demographics, the effect of centralizing a collection, whether LGB individuals use bibliographies to find reading as well as reasons for using and perceptions of library service. Results of the survey were analyzed using SPSS.

Results indicated that fiction or other materials for entertainment were the most popular materials from the library, and that more than half used bibliographies to locate new reading materials. Many respondents cited the high prices of gay or lesbian books as one of the reasons for heavy use of the library. Though some respondents felt that the balance of lesbian to gay titles was skewed in favor of lesbian titles, the overall perception of Hove and Brighton’s services to LGB patrons was excellent or good.

===Rothbauer (2004)===

As an offshoot of her dissertation research, Rothbauer interviewed 17 self-identified lesbian, bisexual and queer women between the ages of 18 and 23 about their discretionary reading habits.&lt;ref name=rothbauer&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rothbauer | first1 = Paulette | year = 2004 | title = "People Aren't Afraid Anymore, but it's Hard to Find Books": Reading Practices that Inform the Personal and Social Identities of Self-Identified Lesbian and Queer Young Women | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Information &amp; Library Sciences | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 53–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To analyze the data, she used open-coding techniques for textual analysis, and also relied on some participant writing and journals.

Rothbauer’s findings indicate that fiction reading is an aspirational activity for young lesbian, bisexual and queer woman; many participants hoped that fiction would show the “possibilities of claiming a queer identity” and were frustrated by works that contained an overly negative or homophobic view of lesbian life. Rothbauer identified four trends in her participants reading choices:

*An orientation towards the future
*A rejection of the standard coming-out narratives
*A desire to read about “being lesbian,” “being queer,” and “being bisexual”
*A connection with the “textual other”&lt;ref name=rothbauer /&gt;

Interviewees also reported feeling a greater connection to community through reading, whether it was through joining fan communities of favorite authors, or discussing and sharing books with others.
 
The public library was one of the most important points of access for interviewees, along with the internet and bookstores. Interviewees often relied heavily on online library catalogs as safe, anonymous searches to explore lesbian fiction. Participants often did not find what they were looking for in online catalogs, but were not surprised by the lack of materials. Rothbauer suggests making materials more visible, and also improving the scope and currency of library holdings to reach these users.

===Beiriger and Jackson (2007)===

In an effort to rectify the lack of research related to the information needs of transgender individuals, Beiriger and Jackson’s article surveyed the transgender population in the Transgender/Identity Resource Center (TiRC) in Portland, Oregon.&lt;ref name=beiriger&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beiriger | first1 = Angie | last2 = Jackson | first2 = Rose M. | year = 2007 | title = An Assessment of the Information Needs of Transgender Communities in Portland, Oregon | url = | journal = Public Library Quarterly | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 45–54 | doi=10.1300/j118v26n01_03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a survey tool adapted from the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Wellness Project of Ottawa-Carleton, Canada, the authors distributed the survey through TiRC staff and counselors, as well as online through listserves and websites.

Analysis of the 99 responses to the survey show that the library is one of the last places that transgender people turn for information due to lack up to date health information, or an unwelcoming environment. Library collections meant to support the needs of transgender individuals were generally less comprehensive than those serving their gay and lesbian counterparts. The authors found that librarians should do more outreach to transgender communities to communicate a message of welcome, and that the internet could be a potentially powerful tool for outreach to these underrepresented populations.

===National Park Service (2016)===
The United States [[National Park Service]] officially unveiled a study&lt;ref name="Series: LGBTQ America: A Theme Study of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer History"&gt;https://www.nps.gov/articles/series.htmid=4DFF8155-1DD8-B71B-0B4C2713F34EA25C&lt;/ref&gt; of the history of the LGBTQ community on National Coming Out Day, Tuesday, October 11, during the second week of LGBT History Month. 
The library and preservation communities hope this study "will assist in the protection of various LGBTQ historic sites across the country." &lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2318">'''Luidia, Inc.''' produces portable interactive whiteboard technology for classrooms and conference rooms.&lt;ref&gt;“Internet eBeams Education,” Memphis Commercial Appeal, (2008-11-05)&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[eBeam]] hardware and software products work with computers and digital projectors to use existing whiteboard or writing surface as [[interactive whiteboard]]s.

The company’s eBeam products allow text, images and video to be projected onto display surfaces, where an interactive stylus or marker can be used to add notes, access menus, manipulate images and create diagrams and drawings.&lt;ref&gt;“Put to the test: Luidia eBeam Edge,” Tech &amp; Learning (2009-06-22)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
Luidia’s eBeam technology uses [[infrared]] and [[ultrasound]] receivers to track the location of a transmitter-equipped pen, called a stylus, or a standard dry-erase marker in a transmitter-equipped sleeve.

==Company history==
Luidia’s eBeam technology was originally developed and patented by engineers at  Electronics for Imaging Inc. (Nasdaq: EFII), a [[Foster City, California]] developer of [[digital printing|digital print]] [[server (computing)|server]] technology. Luidia was spun off&lt;ref&gt;“Luidia Launches,” San Jose Business Journal (2003-09-17)&lt;/ref&gt; from EFI in July 2003 with venture funding from [[Globespan]] Capital Partners and Silicom Ventures.

In 2007, Luidia was selected &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/services/business-services/4006185-1.html]&lt;/ref&gt; by the Mexican government to install eBeam-enabled interactive boards in public seventh-grade classrooms in Mexico as part of the government’s Enciclomedia program.

In 2007 and 2008, Luidia was accredited  by [[Deloitte|Deloitte LLP]]&lt;ref&gt; [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2008_Nov_13/ai_n31000518/]&lt;/ref&gt; in the accounting firm’s Silicon Valley “Technology Fast 50” program, which accredits fast-growing companies in the San Francisco Bay area.

'''''MathLand''''' was one of several elementary mathematics curricula that were designed around the 1989 [[NCTM standards]]. It was developed and published by Creative Publications and was initially adopted by the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]] and schools run by the US Department of Defense by the mid 1990s. Unlike curricula such as [[Investigations in Numbers, Data, and Space]], by 2007 Mathland was no longer offered by the publisher, and has since been dropped by many early adopters. Its demise may have been, at least in part, a result of intense scrutiny by critics (see below).

==Adoption==

Mathland was among the math curricula rated as "promising" by an Education Department panel, although  subsequently 200 mathematicians and scientists, including four Nobel Prize recipients and two winners of the [[Fields Medal]], published a letter in the Washington Post deploring the findings of that panel. MathLand was adopted in many California school districts as its material most closely fit the legal mandate of the 1992 California Framework. That framework has since been discredited and abandoned as misguided and replaced by a newer standard based on [[traditional mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathematicallycorrect.com/ml1.htm Trouble in MathLand]&lt;/ref&gt; It bears noting that the process by which the framework was replaced itself came under serious scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300094329]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Mathland focuses on "attention to conceptual understanding, communication, reasoning and problem solving." Children meet in small groups and invent their own ways to add, subtract, multiply and divide, which spares young learners from "teacher-imposed rules." In the spirit of not chaining instruction to fixed content, MathLand does away with textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hobel.org/lwved/id56.htm Mathland articles]&lt;/ref&gt;
A textbook as well as other practice books were available to reinforce concepts taught in the lesson.

==Standard Arithmetic==
MathLand does not teach standard arithmetic algorithms, including carrying and borrowing. Such methods familiar to adults are absent from the curriculum, and so would need to be supplemented if desired. The standard method for multi-digit multiplication is not presented until 6th grade, and then only as an example of how it is error-prone. Instead a [[Ancient_Egyptian_multiplication#Peasant_multiplication|Russian peasants' algorithm]] for calculating 13 x 18 = 234 is favored. By cutting and pasting various strips of paper, it can be solved by simply using 3 divisions, 3 multiplications, a cancellation, and an addition of three numbers.

Sixth graders are asked to solve following problem:

"I just checked out a library book that is 1,344 pages long! The book is due in 3 weeks. How many pages will I need to read a day to finish the book in time?"

Long division is not used to divide 1,344 by 21. Instead, the curriculum guide explains that "division in MathLand is not a separate operation to master, but rather a combination of successive approximations, multiplication, adding up and subtracting back, all held together with the students' own number sense."

== Criticisms ==

Debra J. Saunders of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' calls Mathland a math curriculum that prefers not to give lessons with "predetermined numerical results." Kings County fourth-grade teacher Doug Swords says that 14 out of 18 teachers use MathLand only as a supplement. When asked if MathLand was helpful in teaching kids to multiply, he responded "No, quite frankly".&lt;ref name="Saunders"&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1999/10/17/ED92574.DTL] Debra J. Saunders Where's the Math? DEBRA J. SAUNDERS San Francisco Chronicle Sunday, October 17, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter published in ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' concerning the education of children by the Department of Defense, Denise McArthur wrote that "according to Dr. Wu, mathematics professor at [[University of California, Berkeley|U.C. Berkeley]], the Interactive Math series is quite the worst math text I have ever come across". Another mathematician wrote, in the Notices of the [[American Mathematical Society|AMS]], "I respectfully urge the AMS leadership to withdraw its endorsement of the NCTM Standards. The Standards have paved the way for elementary pedagogies such as MathLand, which fail to develop the standard multiplication algorithm for elementary students". And another, "...the proposed MathLand materials, address neither our children's lack of basic skills nor their poor performance on tests ... it wholeheartedly embraces the philosophy of the "reform" movement ... a movement that is being seriously questioned by the mathematical and educational community ... it would be foolish to adopt something with such obvious inadequacies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathematicallycorrect.com/stars2.htm] The Stars and Stripes
August 7, 1997 Parents' cry can subtract MathLand&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathland had fallen out of favor by the mid-2000s and was no longer offered by Creative Publications as of 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1902">The '''Mittlere Reife''' ({{IPA-de|ˈmɪtləʁə ˈʁaɪfə|lang}}, "Middle Maturity") is a school leaving certificate in Germany that is usually awarded after ten years of schooling. It is roughly comparable with the British [[GCSE]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The official name varies between the [[States of Germany|federal states]], such as '''Realschulabschluss''', '''Wirtschaftsschulabschluss''', '''Qualifizierter Sekundarabschluss I''', '''Sekundarabschluss I – Realschulabschluss''' and '''Mittlerer Schulabschluss'''.  The ''Mittlere Reife'' can be awarded to students who attend a number of different schools, including the [[Hauptschule]], the [[Realschule]], the [[Werkrealschule]], the [[Berufsfachschule]], the [[Wirtschaftschule]], and the [[Gesamtschule]].

Students awarded the ''Mittlere Reife'' in most cases will not be allowed to progress directly into a German university, but must attend another school that awards the [[Abitur]] such as the [[Aufbaugymnasium]] or the [[Abendgymnasium]] or an equivalent type of school. Once students earn an Abitur, they may go on to university.

Non-German graduation certificates that compare to the ''Mittlere Reife'' such as the American high school diploma generally do not qualify the bearer for attending a German university. However those holding a high school diploma will be able to study at a German university nevertheless if they did well on the [[SAT]] or [[ACT (test)|ACT]].&lt;ref name="nymphenburger"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nymphenburger-schulen.de/project/pdf/ausland/laender_usa.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-01-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719070047/http://www.nymphenburger-schulen.de/project/pdf/ausland/laender_usa.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17543">The '''Moldovan schools in Transnistria''' became an issue of contention in 2004 in the context of the [[disputed status of Transnistria]], a breakaway region of [[Moldova]] since 1990/1992.

== History ==
Moldovan schools were first established in Transnistria after the 1924 formation of the [[Moldovan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]], which was part of the Soviet Republic of [[Ukraine]]. In 1940 the former Moldovan Autonomous Republic was split, 8 districts were included in the [[Ukraine|Soviet Socialist Republic of Ukraine]] and 6 districts were joined with part of [[Basarabia]] in the [[Republic of Moldova|Soviet Socialist Republic of Moldavia]]. In the Ukrainian part of the former Moldavian autonomy Moldovan schools were transformed into Russian-language schools, but in the 6 districts that remained part of the [[Republic of Moldova|Soviet Socialist Republic of Moldova]] a Moldovan-language network of schools was kept.

==Post 1992 situation==

The Moldovan 1989 language law, that introduced the Latin script as the official script of the Republic of Moldova, was boycotted by the Transnistrian authorities, and all Moldovan schools in Transnistria were ordered to keep the Cyrillic script. After the [[War of Transnistria]] ended in mid-1992, the local schools became regulated by the government of Transnistria. The schools that chose to use the Latin script back in 1989 came under pressure of the authorities and most were forced to return to the Cyrillic script. Only six Romanian language schools in Transnistria were allowed to keep the Latin script.

Attempts to expand the number of schools which are using Latin script are met with heavy-handed repression. In 1996, the director of the only Moldovan school in [[Slobozia, Moldova|Slobozia]], who supported the wish of the parents to conduct education in Latin alphabet was fired and forced to leave the region. In 1999 a lecturer of Moldovan language of the Bender Pedagogical College has been dismissed for promoting the Latin script in the institution. The dismissal has been preceded by threats on the phone and an aggression in the building where she lived.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050619192931/http://www.coe.int/t/e/human_rights/minorities/3._co-operation_activities/1._co-operation_activities/2._stability_pact_activities/PDF_SP_NDR%282002%29011%20Preliminary_Report_Moldova.pdf Non discrimination review under the stability pact for South Eastern Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1996, the [[Grigoriopol]] administration used Cossacks and police to stop the activity of Moldovan School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transnistria.md/en/interview/0/126/5 Interview with Eleonora Cecavski, teacher from Grigoriopol] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927024802/http://transnistria.md/en/interview/0/126/5 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 October 1996 three teachers were arrested and taken to Tiraspol. On 7 October 1996, as a result of a demarche by the President of the Republic of Moldova and the OSCE Mission, the teachers were released.

Another attempt to teach Romanian clandestinely in Grigoriopol, in a ‘PMR state-funded school’, failed in 2002. Teaching staff and parents were blatantly vilified in the local press as ‘enemies of the State’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.md/article/ld15.htm BIG SCANDAL IN A SMALL TOWN, article in "Dnestrovsky Kurier" 8 March 2002] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912130836/http://www.unhcr.md/article/ld15.htm |date=12 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One by one they were invited to ‘reconsider’, threatened with loss of employment and the corresponding entitlement to housing. Children (and teachers) were forced to write explanations as to why they used the Latin script and local officials routinely visited classes to check whether tuition was being ‘properly’ conducted. The parent-teacher association was abolished and its head, [[Mihai Speian]], was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soviet-medals-orders.com/images/Publ/andrysek&amp;grecu4.htm Unworthy partner: the schools issue as an example of human rights abuses in Transdniestria]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820031858/http://www.soviet-medals-orders.com/images/Publ/andrysek%26grecu4.htm |date=20 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Moldovan school in Grigoriopol was forced to move in [[Doroţcaia|Doroțcaia]], a village controlled by Chișinău, and children commute 10–15&amp;nbsp;km daily to attend the school.

== The 2004 crisis ==
In the summer of 2004, the Transnistrian authorities closed four of the six schools in the region that taught [[Moldovan language]] using the [[Latin]] script, known as Romanian. Some of the 3,400 enrolled children were affected by this measure and the teachers and parents who opposed the closures were temporarily arrested for up to six hours. During the crisis, the Moldovan government decided to create a blockade that would isolate the disputed region from the rest of the world. The blockade was ineffective because of a lack of cooperation from [[Ukraine]], led at the time by [[Leonid Kuchma]]. Transnistria retaliated with a series of actions meant to destabilize the economic situation in Moldova, in particular, by cutting the power supply from the power plants that were built in Transnistria in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times. As a result, this crisis generated power outages in parts of Moldova.

A leading figure in the conflict was [[Elena Vasilievna Bomeshko]], the Minister of Education for Transnistria. According to her, and official Transnistrian policy, the language is referred to as "[[Romanian language|Romanian]]" when it is taught in Latin script and referred to as "Moldovan" when [[Cyrillic]] script is used. Transnistria rejects accusations of anti-Romanian bias and defends its preference of Cyrillic for Moldovan as a way to maintain the original language, pointing to the fact as far back as the Middle Ages, Moldovan [[Bible]]s were always written in Cyrillic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiras.ru/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1381 Interview with V. Tulgar, Union of Moldovans] {{dead link|date=February 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; While the Romanian language used the Cyrillic alphabet for centuries, it is no longer used in Romania. Cyrillic script is still used in some parts of Moldova, but only one newspaper (state-owned by Transnistrian authorities) prints a few hundred copies in Cyrillic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rgnpress.ro/content/view/18846// RGN Press report: No Romanian language textbooks available in Grigoriopol.]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (in Romanian)&lt;/ref&gt;

The closed Romanian schools were reopened, after registering as private institutions with the Transnistrian authorities. Pressure from the European Union (a travel ban was introduced to 10 Transnistrian education officials) may have sped up the process.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}} pp. 17-18: "''The Council adopted a Decision implementing common position 2004/179/CFSP on restrictive measures against the leadership of the Transnistrian region of Moldova (15061/05). [...] The Decision reduces the list of persons (from ten to two) affected by visa restrictions in order to take account of the improvements in the situation of Latin-script schools in some areas of the Transnistrian region.
In August 2004, the Council expanded the scope of the restrictive measures to persons held responsible for the intimidation campaign and the closure of Latin-script Moldovan schools and established a new list of persons subject to the visa-ban.''"&lt;/ref&gt; but they still have the status of "private schools" and consequently do not receive funding from the Transnistrian government.

Many teachers and parents of students studying at Moldovan schools with Cyrillic script had contacted the Moldovan Helsinki Committee for Human Rights asking support to turn education in Romanian (Latin script), as the studies based on the Cyrillic script and Soviet curricula don't have any perspective and the children are unable to pursue higher studies anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azi.md/news?ID=31564 Helsinki-Moldova Committee Says About 50 Schools in Transnistria Want to Study in Romanian] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927175634/http://www.azi.md/news?ID=31564 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The OSCE [[High Commissioner on National Minorities]] has condemned the actions of Transnistrian authorities as a "linguistic cleansing".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160218033937/http://www.osce.org/hcnm/56534 OSCE: Linguistic cleansing underway in Transdniestria]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current situation==
[[File:Liceul Alexandru cel Bun Tighina 13.jpg|thumb|Students at Alexandru cel Bun High School in Bender celebrating the end of the academic year in May 2013]]
An OSCE report from June 2005 states: “If they [Moldovan parents in Transnistria] enroll their children in one of this schools that offer a Moldovan curriculum using a Latin script, they risk being threatened by the regional security service, and seeing their jobs put in jeopardy. Sending their children in one of the 33 Transdniestrian schools they teach in their native language in Cyrillic is, however, hardly an appealing alternative, as the schools follow an out-dated curriculum and use textbooks from the Soviet period”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/documents/html/pdftohtml/15621_425_en.pdf.html OSCE report: Moldovan schools in Transdniestria] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606163208/http://www.osce.org/documents/html/pdftohtml/15621_425_en.pdf.html |date=6 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the reason why many Moldovans from [[Transnistria]] send their children in harassment-free Russian language schools.

Transnistrian authorities don't recognize the diplomas issued by Moldovan schools using Latin script, making impossible for graduates of those schools to study on Transnistrian higher educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tiraspoltimes.com/news/education_ministry_see_minority_schools_as_pawn_in_political_game.html Transnistrian point of view about Moldovan schools] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930024100/http://tiraspoltimes.com/news/education_ministry_see_minority_schools_as_pawn_in_political_game.html |date=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Involvement of European Court of Human Rights===
In November 2006 the European Court of Human Rights accepted to examine the claims submitted by three Moldovan schools in Transnistria (from Tighina, Rîbnița and Grigoriopol) regarding the violation of their right to education and right to work in conditions of non-discrimination. The three schools concerned regard Russia and Moldova as responsible for violation of their rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conflict.md/stiri.php?ID=1918 ECHR TO CONSIDER CLAIMS LODGED BY MOLDOVAN SCHOOLS IN TRANSNISTRIA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005441/http://conflict.md/stiri.php?ID=1918 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, the Court conducted hearings on three similar cases: Caldare and 42 Others v.

=== Pressure on Transnistrian authorities ===
In November 2006, [[Louis O'Neill]], head of OSCE mission to Moldova, has urged local authorities in the Transnistrian city of Rîbnița to return a confiscated building to the Moldovan Latin-script school located in the city. The building was built by the Government from Chișinău and was almost finished in 2004, when Transnistrian police took it by force, during the school crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/item/22208.html?print=1 Ribnitsa authorities must return confiscated school building, says OSCE Mission Head] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195911/http://www.osce.org/item/22208.html?print=1 |date=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- == Villages without Romanian language schools ==
* 3 villages with 100% Moldovan population with only Russian-language schools: Cuzmin ([[Camenca district]]), Broșteni, Lenino ([[Rîbniţa district|Rîbnița district]]).

'''Openowledge''' (Korean:오픈놀리지) is an educational and [[nonprofit organization]] managed by students of [[CheongShim International Academy]]. The project was launched on January 2013 by the founder Jin-Woo Yu. The stated mission is to "allow students in [[South Korea]] to easily learn and study the lectures on their website.

The courses on the site includes videos translated from [[Khan Academy]] as well as those originally created by students. The subjects include: [[Calculus]], [[Western Philosophy]], Problems in [[Economics]], and [[neuroscience]]. The total number of views is estimated to be about 26,300.&lt;ref name="November News"&gt;{{cite news |last=Choi (최) |first=HwaJin (화진) |url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/schooling/610715.html |script-title=ko:외국 동영상 번역하고 친구 강의도 제작해요 |publisher=The Hankyoreh |date=November 11, 2013 |accessdate=November 21, 2013 |language=Korean |trans-title=We translate foreign videos and create lectures given by friends}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
One of the founders, Jin-Woo Yu, was inspired by a [[Article (publishing)|news article]] which introduced [[Khan Academy]]. He stated that the concept of Openowledge was created from a desire to create a translated and better-organized site.&lt;ref name="November News" /&gt; Another member stated that the concept of [[Korean (language)|Korean]] subtitles arose from her own experience with Khan Academy.&lt;ref name="August News"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/08/21/2013082102411.html |script-title=ko:세상 모든 지식 나눌 수 있는 다리 만들래요 |publisher=chosun.com |date=August 22, 2013 |accessdate=November 21, 2013 |language=Korean |trans-title=We'll create a bridge to share all the knowledge in the world}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Jin-Woo Yu and Myung-Gun Seo created the organization Khan Academy Korea. Khan Academy Korea had a project to translate Khan Academy videos. The project was extended into the current Openowledge project.&lt;ref name="June News"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/06/10/2013061002202.html |script-title=ko:[더 나은 미래] 온라인 지식 공유의 場… 가난·언어·지역의 울타리 허물다 |publisher=chosun.com |date=June 11, 2013 |accessdate=November 21, 2013 |language=Korean |trans-title=[A Better Future] A place of online knowledge... Ridding of barriers of poverty and language}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first rough form of the organization began on the beginning of 2013 with founder Yu Jin-Woo and two others.&lt;ref name="November News" /&gt; At least one advertisement appeared on November 22, 2013.&lt;ref name="Blog"&gt;{{cite web |last=Yu (유) |first=JinWoo (진우) |last2=Jung (정) |first2=YoungWook (용욱) |url=http://noonblog.tistory.com/22 |title=오픈놀리지(Openowledge)를 소개합니다 |publisher=쥐이이누's Blog |accessdate=November 21, 2013 |language=Korean |trans-title=Introducing Openowledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 2013,'Openowledge' was first created&lt;ref name="June News" /&gt; as a [[high school club]].&lt;ref name="November News" /&gt; The founders only consisted of second-year [[high school]] students in [[CheongShim International Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bak (박) |first=JooSong (주성) |url=http://www.newsis.com/gallery/view.htm?cID=2&amp;pID=1&amp;page=1&amp;s_skin=&amp;s_date=&amp;e_date=&amp;s_k=&amp;pict_id=NISI20130716_0008437416 |script-title=ko:학생들의 지식나눔 프로젝트 '오픈놀리지' 정식 오픈 |publisher=NEWSIS.COM |date=July 16, 2013 |accessdate=November 21, 2013 |language=Korean |trans-title=Students' knowledge-sharing project 'Openowledge' officially open}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current site began operating on May 2013&lt;ref name="November News" /&gt;&lt;ref name="July List"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lee (이) |first=SoonHyuk (순혁) |url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/it/597878.html |script-title=ko:클릭! 나는 공짜로 공부한다 |publisher=The Hankyoreh |date=July 31, 2013 |accessdate=November 21, 2013 |language=Korean |trans-title=Click!

Openowledge started operating as an actual service on July 16, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bak (박) |first=JooSong (주성) |url=http://www.newsis.com/gallery/view.htm?cID=2&amp;pID=1&amp;page=1&amp;s_skin=&amp;s_date=&amp;e_date=&amp;s_k=&amp;pict_id=NISI20130716_0008437415 |script-title=ko:학생들의 지식나눔 프로젝트 '오픈놀리지' 정식 오픈 |publisher=NEWSIS.COM |date=July 16, 2013 |accessdate=November 21, 2013 |language=Korean |trans-title=Students' knowledge-sharing project 'Openowledge' officially open |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203011625/http://www.newsis.com/gallery/view.htm?cID=2&amp;pID=1&amp;page=1&amp;s_skin=&amp;s_date=&amp;e_date=&amp;s_k=&amp;pict_id=NISI20130716_0008437415 |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Openowledge has since registered as an official organization.&lt;ref name="November News" /&gt; It is now classified as an educational, [[nonprofit organization]].&lt;ref name="June News" /&gt; It is also classified as an official [[volunteering]] organization.&lt;ref name="August News" /&gt;

==Organization==
Openowledge is maintained by eight CheongShim International Academy students.&lt;ref name="November News" /&gt;
Openowledge is divided into three parts: The 'share-knowledge' project, the '[[foreign language]] content [[translation]] project' and the 'CheongShim Opencourseware (OCW).'&lt;ref name="Introduction"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://openowledge.com/opencourse/%EC%98%A4%ED%94%88%EB%86%80%EB%A6%AC%EC%A7%80-%EC%86%8C%EA%B0%9C/ |script-title=ko:오픈놀리지 소개 |publisher=Openowledge |accessdate=November 21, 2013 |language=Korean |trans-title=Openowledge Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The share-knowledge project consists of videos created by CheongShim International Academy high-school students.&lt;ref name="Introduction" /&gt; The subjects include: [[Calculus]], [[Western Philosophy]], Problems in [[Economics]], and [[neuroscience]].&lt;ref name="July List" /&gt; The lecturers include a participant in the [[International Philosophy Olympiad]] and other students considered 'great lecturers.'&lt;ref name="August News" /&gt; The contents are shown for free on the website.&lt;ref name="Introduction" /&gt; As of August 2013, 32 original videos are available on the website.&lt;ref name="August News" /&gt;

The foreign language content translation project consists of videos translated from Khan Academy and MIT+K12.&lt;ref name="Introduction" /&gt; Translators ranges from [[elementary school]] students to [[college]] students and employed adults. As of November 2013, there are about 40 translators in total.&lt;ref name="November News" /&gt; Members estimate that the translation time for one video is about two hours. There are special translation teams such as 'ACG Translation Team' which translates the videos.&lt;ref name="August News" /&gt; Currently, a translation team consists of two or three members.&lt;ref name="July List" /&gt; The videos are shown free on the website.&lt;ref name="Introduction" /&gt; As of August 2013, there were about 35 translated lectures on the website.&lt;ref name="August News" /&gt;

The CheongShim Opencourseware consists of original lectures produced by CheongShim International Academy teachers. The videos are uploaded for free on the website and on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="Introduction" /&gt;

==Future Plans==
The founder Yu, Jin-Woo have stated that he hopes to have a total of 500 lecturers and 800 lectures by 2015 and have Openowledge named as the 'most diverse knowledge-sharing platform in the [[Republic of Korea]].'&lt;ref name="August News" /&gt;

The '''Organised Independents''' (often abbreviated to '''OIs''') are a grouping within the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students of the United Kingdom]]. 

The group is made up of candidates for [[Governance of the National Union of Students (United Kingdom)#National Executive Committee|National Executive Committee]] posts, all standing on an "independent" label, and their supporters.&lt;ref name="Brooks"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rachel Brooks|title=Student Politics and Protest: International perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UM5CDQAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Routledge|page=148|isbn=978-0-8203-3496-7|access-date=October 14, 2016|archive-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UM5CDQAAQBAJ|archive-date=April 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the OIs have been defined as an [[interest group]] as opposed to a [[political faction|faction]]; this originates from the idea that they are [[apoliticism|apolitical]] or [[moderate]], either simply as a group of [[sabbatical officer|sabbatical officers]] seeking to support one another, or as proponents of a [[Student unionism in the United Kingdom|membership]]-focused national ideology. Commentator Rachel Brooks writes that the OIs also have a "shared concern to minimise the influence of 'the left'," which she defines as centring around the factions [[Alliance for Workers Liberty|AWL]], [[Student Broad Left|Liberation Left]], and [[National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts|NCAFC]].&lt;ref name="Brooks"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, after [[Malia Bouattia#Allegations of antisemitism|widespread discontentment]] with NUS under the leadership of [[Malia Bouattia]], a [[slate (elections)|slate]] of OI-backed candidates won five of the six [[Governance of the National Union of Students (United Kingdom)#Full Time Officers|full-time officer positions]] elected at NUS National Conference. This included the role of President in which [[Shakira Martin (NUS)|Shakira Martin]], the union's vice-president for further education, defeated Bouattia, receiving 56% of the vote.&lt;ref name="Topping"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Topping|first1=Alexandra|last2=Marsh|first2=Sarah|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/apr/26/malia-bouattia-shakira-martin-nus-national-union-of-students-president-election|title=Divisive NUS president Malia Bouattia defeated in election|work=The Guardian|date=26 April 2017|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peake"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peake|first1=Emili|url=http://www.thenationalstudent.com/Student/2017-04-28/abortion_rights_mental_health_and_climate_change_amongst_20_motions_passed_at_nus_conference.html|title=Abortion rights, mental health and climate change amongst 20 motions passed at NUS Conference|work=The National Student|date=28 April 2017|accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
While individual OIs have a broad range of political views and positions, from [[soft left]] to [[one-nation conservatism]], the group as a whole holds a [[Student unionism in the United Kingdom|membership]]-focused ideology. The group advocates the NUS being more directly representative of its member SUs, often invoking the motto that 'they work for us'.

As a result, OI policy positions are often more socially [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] than factions such as the [[Labour Students]] or [[UJS|Union of Jewish Students]], but tend to avoid non-education policy areas prioritised by [[NCAFC]] or [[Student Broad Left|Liberation Left]] such as [[Economic policy|economic]] or [[foreign policy]]. An exception to this was on [[Brexit]], which prominent OIs took a strong stance against, and the group led [[For our Future's Sake|NUS' campaign]] for a [[People's Vote|people's vote]].&lt;ref name="ShoutoutUK"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pontone|first1=Maya|title=Vice President of NUS mobilises ‘people’s vote’ on final Brexit deal|url=https://www.shoutoutuk.org/2018/03/30/vice-president-of-nus-mobilises-peoples-vote-on-final-brexit-deal/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Background===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
As a result of the group's broad definition, a lot of controversy has raged over whether such a faction exists. Many NUS commentators are in agreement that such an organised grouping is clearly in existence. Various names were in use, including the "Webberites" (after Simon Webber, an early leading figure), the "Owainites" (after [[Owain James]], NUS President 2000-2002), the "Independent Faction" before the term "Organised Independents" took hold. The phrase "independent student officers" was also prominent on many manifestos. Increasingly members of the grouping no longer dispute their existence and the label. However, there is still much dispute over whether or not individual independents are aligned to the OIs or not. 

===1990-2002===
{{Refimprove|section|date=May 2017}}
The OIs emerged as a group of independent candidates and NEC members who gave support to the [[Labour Students]]-dominated NUS leadership of the 1990s. Several admitted to being "members of the Labour Party but not Labour Students," a distinction that some found difficult to understand. Further confusion reigned as some OIs appeared to be members of Labour Students at the ordinary level. The group became increasingly prominent in 2000 when Labour Students declined to put up a candidate to defend the Presidency of the NUS, a position which they had previously held for eighteen years, but instead backed Owain James as an independent, who won the post and held it for the two years allowed under the constitution. Former NUS [[National Union of Students LGBT+ Campaign|LGB officer]] Carli Harper-Pennan wrote that at this time, the OIs were "aligned with Labour Students", "organised with them", and had "the same agenda".&lt;ref name="Harper-Pennan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rudebeck|first1=Clare|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/its-tough-at-the-top-and-dirty-9204208.html|title=It's tough at the top - and dirty|work=The Independent|date=3 April 2002|accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2002-2010===
{{Refimprove|section|date=May 2017}}
The 2002 NUS elections saw the OIs and Labour Students fall out and run opposing candidates. In general the OIs defeated the Labour Students in all elections bar the Presidency, which was won by [[Mandy Telford]]. Subsequently, the OIs and Labour Students fluctuated between co-operation at times, but fierce opposition at others. It was in this 2004-6 period that the later-Mayor of [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]] [[Kat Fletcher]] of CFE/[[Alliance for Workers Liberty|AWL]] was elected President; Fletcher was the first since 1981 to be elected from a political slate clearly to the left of either Labour Students or the OIs. In recent years there has therefore been renewed confusion over the exact membership of the OIs, stemming from a series of notable factional shifts within the NUS by several individuals and the emergence of more than one group of independents who organise together.

In 2007, though, the position was clear, and the independents who described themselves within NUS formally as OIs were [[Gemma Tumelty]] (National President), Stephen Brown (National Secretary),  Ama Uzowuru (Vice-President Welfare), Adam McNicholas (Block of 12). Tumelty and Brown both left their respective posts in June 2008. 

The Organised Independents continued to be popular within the national movement. 2008 saw the appearance of the 'Dirty Games' deal, in which the OIs were reported to have been "handed the vice-president higher education position for [[Aaron Porter]]", in exchange for backing the later [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Wes Streeting]] for President.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Tom|url=http://www.national-student.co.uk/national_news/dirty_games_nus_presidential_election_stitch_up.htm|title=“Dirty Games” - NUS presidential election stitch-up|work=The National Student|date=11 March 2008|accessdate=28 April 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080314150017/http://www.national-student.co.uk/national_news/dirty_games_nus_presidential_election_stitch_up.htm|archivedate=14 March 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2008 elections, Porter was elected, while Ama Uzowuru was re-elected as Vice-President (Welfare), and Ben Whittaker and Elizabeth Sommerville were elected onto the Block of 12. The Organised Independents were also in power in NUS Scotland, with Gurjit Singh holding Presidency in 2008.  He was defeated in the following presidential election by Labour party member Liam Burns.

In 2009, Whittaker was elected as Vice President Welfare and Liz Williams (Liverpool Guild of Students) and Alice Bouquet (University of West England SU) were elected onto Block of 15 at National Conference. Katie Dalton was elected President of NUS Wales.

In 2010, Porter was elected as the [[List of Presidents of the National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|54th President]] of the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]].

===2010-2017===
{{Refimprove|section|date=May 2017}}
In 2011, Peter Mercer was elected Vice-President Welfare following Ben Whittaker's two terms. Matthew East, two-term Anglia Ruskin Students' Union President, was elected onto the Block of 15. George-Konstantinos Charonis was elected as the NUS Postgraduate Taught Representative at the Postgraduate Conference.

The OIs were temporarily disbanded after this, until the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)#2017 National Conference|2017 National Conference]]. In 2013, however, Raechel Mattey and Colum McGuire were elected as VP Union Development and VP Welfare, respectively; they continued to campaign informally around [[moderate]] candidates and issues. Both were re-elected to serve a second term in 2014. Mattey grew unpopular, however; at the 2013 [[Governance of the National Union of Students (United Kingdom)#Zones|Union Development zone]] conference, she had refused to allow a [[National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts|NCAFC]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.opendemocracy.net/author/james-mcash] OpenDemocracy.

In 2015, following Mattey, Richard Brooks was elected Vice President (Union Development).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nusconnect.org.uk/articles/richard-brooks-elected-as-nus-vice-president-union-development|title=Richard Brooks elected as NUS Vice President (Union Development)|last= |first= |date=April 22, 2015 |website=NUS Connect|publisher=NUS Connect|access-date=April 30, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vonnie Sandlan and Fergal McFerran were also elected Presidents of [[National Union of Students Scotland|NUS Scotland]] and [[National Union of Students-Union of Students in Ireland|NUS-USI]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nus-usi.org/2015/01/16/person-1/|title=Fergal McFerran: NUS-USI President 2015-17|last= |first= |date=September 30, 2016 |website=NUS-USI |publisher=NUS-USI |access-date=April 30, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theyworkforus.co.uk/2017/04/20/the-hidden-links-between-candidates-nusnc17/

After this [[Malia Bouattia#Allegations of antisemitism|widespread discontentment]] with NUS' direction, the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)#2017 National Conference|2017 National Conference]] saw a [[slate (elections)|slate]] of OI-backed candidates win five of the six [[Governance of the National Union of Students (United Kingdom)#Full Time Officers|full-time officer positions]] elected at NUS National Conference.&lt;ref name="Topping"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peake"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, several [[centrist]] [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]] passed, including [[democratic reform|democratic reforms]] designed to better engage students and students' unions, which were described as "the most comprehensive and wide-ranging structural reforms in NUS history".&lt;ref name="Lapwood"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lapwood|first1=George|url=http://www.studentnewspaper.org/press-coverage-of-the-nus-is-dishonest-and-manipulative/|title=The NUS Conference was an overwhelming success.

In 2018, after a year of constructive engagement with policymakers, all returning candidates were re-elected except Izzy Lenga. Martin was re-elected with 51% of the vote in the first round of voting, along with deputy Amatey Doku, who received 68% after calling for nationwide student-led mobilisation to demand a 'people's vote' on the final [[Brexit]] deal.&lt;ref name="Bothwell"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bothwell|first1=Ellie|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/shakira-martin-re-elected-national-union-students-president|title=Shakira Martin re-elected as National Union of Students president|work=Times Higher Education|date=28 March 2018|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weale"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weale|first1=Sally|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/28/shakira-martin-easily-holds-on-to-leadership-of-students-union|title=Shakira Martin easily holds on to leadership of students union|work=The Guardian|date=28 March 2018|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanderson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanderson|first1=Daniel|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/student-chief-shakira-martin-reaches-out-to-tories-after-defeating-left-ln3bsjrd0|title=Student chief Shakira Martin reaches out to Tories after defeating left|work=The Times|date=31 March 2018|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brexit==
In 2018, in response to the ongoing political instability around [[Brexit]], the group launched [[For our Future's Sake|FFS]], a cross-party youth campaign for a [[People's Vote|people's vote]]. Key OI figures steered policy through the 2018 National Conference to ensure that NUS became one of the earliest organisations to declare support for the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Pontone | first = Maya | title = Vice President of NUS mobilises ‘people’s vote’ on final Brexit deal | url = https://www.shoutoutuk.org/2018/03/30/vice-president-of-nus-mobilises-peoples-vote-on-final-brexit-deal/ | website = shoutoutuk.org | publisher = Shout Out UK | date = 30 March 2018 | access-date = 13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Ramiro | first = Joana | title = NUS throws weight behind Brexit second ref | url = https://leftfootforward.org/2018/03/students-union-throws-weight-behind-brexit-second-ref/ | work = [[Left Foot Forward]] | date = 28 March 2018 | access-date = 13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FFSConferenceLaunch&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-second-referendum-remain-chuka-ummuna-vote-community-labour-a8274601.html | work = [[The Independent]] | date = 28 March 2018 | access-date = 13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4734">'''Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes''' ('''OLLI''') offer noncredit courses with no assignments or grades to “seasoned” adults over age 50. Since 2001 philanthropist '''[[Bernard Osher]]''' has made grants from his foundation to launch OLLI programs at 120 universities and colleges in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

==Background==
Bernard Osher, a native of [[Maine]], managed the family hardware and plumbing supply business before heading to New York to work for [[Oppenheimer &amp; Company]].  He moved to California and became a founding director of [[World Savings]] and a founder of its parent company [[Golden West Financial]].  He bought the San Francisco auction house [[Butterfield &amp; Butterfield]] in 1970 and sold it in 1999 to [[eBay]]. World Savings merged with [[Wachovia Corporation]] in 2006, which was in turn acquired by [[Wells Fargo]] in 2008. In 1977 he established the Bernard Osher Foundation, headquartered in [[San Francisco]], which contributes to higher education, the arts, and social services, with education receiving nearly 80 percent of its grants.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Osher was impressed by the [[Fromm Institute for Lifelong Learning]] at the [[University of San Francisco]], and approached the Senior Program at the [[University of Southern Maine]] (USM) with his interest in supporting noncredit programs for older adults.   He awarded USM an endowment grant in 2001 to expand its program, which was renamed as the first Osher Lifelong Learning Institute.&lt;ref name="Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;   Ed Stolman, a friend of Osher’s who had retired to [[Sonoma County, California]], approached [[Sonoma State University]] (SSU) to encourage development of an OLLI program.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The Osher Foundation made a development grant to SSU which quickly attracted an audience of older student members.  Encouraged by the success of these two programs, Osher decided to greatly expand his grant support for similar lifelong learning institutes.

==OLLI program development==
In 2002 the Osher Foundation began making program development grants of $100,000 a year for up to three years to launch new OLLI programs.  The initial focus was on California, which now has OLLI programs at seven [[University of California]] and 16 [[California State University]] campuses.  In 2004 Osher established a National Resource Center at USM to distribute information about effective educational programs for older adults via a web site, a research journal, and an annual conference. In October 2014 the NRC was relocated to [[Northwestern University]]'s downtown [[Chicago, Illinois]] campus.&lt;ref name="NRC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nrc.northwestern.edu/2015/04/the-national-resource-center-for-the-osher-lifelong-learning-institutes/ |title=The National Resource Center for Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=April 15, 2015 |website=northwestern.edu |access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under current practices, if an OLLI program has 500 fee-paying members by the end of its fourth year, the university is eligible for a $1 million endowment grant from the Osher Foundation.  When it reaches 1000 members, it is eligible for another $1 million endowment grant.  As of 2015, the Osher Foundation was supporting 120 OLLI programs at universities and colleges in all 50 states and the [[District of Columbia]].&lt;ref name="Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes"/&gt;

The Bernard Osher Foundation’s executive director is Barbro Osher, Consul General for [[Sweden]] in San Francisco.

During his tenure he founded the Sri Lanka's first medical hospital and school in what later became the [[Green Memorial Hospital]] in [[Manipay]] in the [[Jaffna peninsula]].&lt;ref name=Ambi/&gt;&lt;ref name="hospital"/&gt; He translated and published over 4000 pages of medical literature from [[English language|English]] to [[Tamil language|Tamil]] as part of his efforts to train doctors in their native language. He was personally responsible for training over 60 native doctors of whom majority had their instructions in Tamil.

==Early life==
Green was born  in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], Massachusetts, to William E. Green and Julia Plimpton as the eighth of 11 children. After his secondary schooling, he was attracted to religion. In 1841 he went to [[New York City]] and joined the [[Protestant]] [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] Board of Missions. During this period he became interested in the medical profession and joined as a medical student and graduating as a doctor in 1845. In 1846, he joined the American Mission and along with a team of missionaries was sent to [[Ceylon]] now [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name=Ambi/&gt; His brother was [[Andrew Haswell Green]], who was instrumental in completing [[New York City]]'s [[Central park]].&lt;ref name="Macintyre"/&gt;

He died in 1884.&lt;ref name=Ambi&gt;{{cite book|last=Ambihaipahar|first=R|title=Scientific Pioneer: Dr.Samuel Fisk Green|url=http://kanaga_sritharan.tripod.com/greensf.htm|year=1998|publisher=Dhulasi Publications|isbn=955-8193-00-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hospital"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manipayhospital.com/|title=Green Memorial Hospital|year=2002|publisher=Friends of Manipay Hospital|accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Macintyre"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sundaytimes.lk/100314/Plus/plus_11.html|title=The human drama underneath the factual medical, historical material|last=Macintyre|first=Ernest|date=March 14, 2010|work=The Sunday Times|accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missionary work==
After a four month trip from America, he moved to Ceylon via [[Madras Presidency]] in [[British India]] in 1847. He initially served at the ACM mission at the [[Batticotta Seminary]].  Although the locals were reluctant use his services, eventually with his capability he became well known for his medical skills. As he attracted a lot of patients and it distracted Batticotta seminaries primary task of education, he was moved to another ACM mission station in [[Manipay]] in 1848.
At Manipay, in addition to providing medical services to patients who came in search of him, he established the first medical school to teach western medicine to the [[Sri Lankan Tamils|Tamil people of Jaffna]], thus opening, Sri Lanka's first medical hospital and teaching facility that became known as Green memorial hospital. Green Memorial Hospital was managed by the  [[Jaffna Diocese of the Church of South India]] (JDCSI) the successor organization of ACM. It celebrated the 150th anniversary of the Green Memorial Hospital, and the ACM medical mission, in October 1998.&lt;ref name=Ambi/&gt;

==Translating from English to Tamil==
Initially when Dr. Green appealed for assistance for the publication of some medical books in Tamil, the colonial government refused aid.  But after a decade, the same government doubled its aid and also requested Dr. Green to superintend the preparation and printing of Sanitary and Medical action related literature in Cholera times.  Dr. Green wanted to prepare the trained physicians to stay in their native villages to help the locals instead migrating to find work within the colonial administration. 
To teach western medicine in Tamil, he had to coin technical terms in Tamil, translate western medical books into Tamil and write medical books in Tamil. This meant the development of medical and scientific Tamil as different from the established literary Tamil. There was also a need to write medical treatises in simple Tamil for the benefit of the common people – the layman.&lt;ref name=Ambi/&gt;&lt;ref name="Macintyre"/&gt;

'''Signe Amanda Georgina Hebbe''' (30 July 1837 &amp;ndash; 14 February, 1925) was a Swedish operatic [[soprano]] and instructor.

==Life==

Signe Hebbe was born in [[Värnamo]] to the journalist [[Vendela Hebbe]] and Clemens Hebbe.

===Education===

In 1848, at the age of eleven, she was enrolled at the school of the [[Royal Swedish Opera]]. She was a student of [[Karolina Bock]] and studied music at the Lindblad piano school.  In 1852-54, she was a student at the conservatory in [[Berlin]].

Signe Hebbe made her debut as an actress at the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] in 1855.  She was not given good reviews in spoken drama, and therefore resumed her studies in singing.

In 1856, she was enrolled as a student at the [[Paris]] conservatory. She was the first student from Scandinavia to be given an award at the Paris conservatory. 
She gave lessons in "plastic" (mimic) herself and, in 1860, came to act as the instructor of [[Sarah Bernhardt]], when she replaced Bernhardt's ordinary teacher Élie during his absence.

She developed her ability as a singer by studies under [[Francesco Lamperti]] in [[Milan]], and studied acting for [[Adelaide Ristori]] and [[Ernesto Rossi (actor)|Ernesto Rossi]].

===Opera singer===

Signe Hebbe was made her debut as an opera singer in [[Frankfurt]].  She was active in [[Lyon]] in 1861-62, and engaged at the [[Nationaltheater Mannheim]].

Between 1864 and 1879, she toured Europe as an opera- and concert singer and performed in Stockholm, [[Karlsruhe]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Théâtre Lyrique]] in [[Paris]], [[Warszawa]], [[Geneva]], [[Milano]], [[Palermo]], [[Helsingfors]], and [[Oslo]].

She was criticized for her acting, because she did not follow the accepted interpretation of roles. Interested in women's issues, Signe Hebbe preferred to give  women's parts in opera's a more independent and strong interpretation rather than the traditional weak interpretations, innovations which exposed her to criticism for not adjusting to the opera traditions.

===Instructor===

Signe Hebbe was active as a voice trainer and singing instructor from 1871 to 1925.  In 1877, she opened her own school.  From 1883, she was active at the ''[[Dramatens elevskola]]'', in 1886-88 at the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Music]], and in the years around 1900 on the Royal Dramatic Theatre.

She reportedly preferred her work at her own school.  In her own school, she was an instructor in the technique in speech, singing, plastique (mimic) and role analysis.  She introduced the technique of deep breathing to Sweden from Paris, where she had been given this training by [[Delsartes]].

She had students from all Scandinavia, Europe and the USA.   Two of her notable pupils were [[John Forsell]] and [[Carolina Östberg]].

She died in [[Stockholm]] in 1925 at 87 years old.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18691">'''Triple accreditation''' (or '''Triple Crown accreditation''') is the combination of [[Accreditation|accreditations]] awarded to 89 business schools worldwide as of May 2018 (up from 74 in May 2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.today/guide/triple-accreditation-business-schools|title=Triple accredited business schools (AACSB, AMBA, EQUIS)|publisher=MBA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the three largest and most influential business school accreditation organizations:

* [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business|AACSB]] - The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business ([[United States]])
* [[Association of MBAs|AMBA]] - The Association of MBAs ([[United Kingdom]])
* [[EFMD Quality Improvement System|EQUIS]] - EFMD Quality Improvement System ([[European Union]])

Of the 13,670 schools offering business degree programs worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;[[The Economist]]. Oct 15th 2011.  [http://www.economist.com/node/21532269 "Is time running out for business schools that aren’t quite elite?"]&lt;/ref&gt; only 90 have triple accreditation as of August 2018.

A major reason for the small number of triple-accredited institutions in the world is the requirement of the [[Association of MBAs]] that AMBA-accredited business schools should only admit MBA applicants with at least three years of full-time post-graduation work experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbaworld.com/-/media/files/accreditation/mba-criteria-for-accreditation.ashx?la=en|title=MBA Accreditation Criteria 2016|author=AMBA|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts{{who|date=February 2018}} claim that most top [[United States|US]] [[business school]]s cannot meet this criterion as they sometimes (though rarely) admit applicants with only a [[bachelor]]'s degree and little or no work experience. They claim that it is why triple-crown accreditation is pursued primarily by European institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Andreas Kaplan: European Management and European Business Schools: Insights from the History of Business Schools| doi=10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006 | volume=32 | journal=European Management Journal | pages=529–534}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not the case when some (former) triple accredited institutes, [[City University of Hong Kong]] for example, only require applicants having "relevant work experience is desirable (though not specifically required)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cb.cityu.edu.hk/mba/admissions/requirements/|title=MBA Admissions Requirements, City University of Hong Kong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences in accreditation ==

Each of the three institutions assesses a business school according to different criteria and scope:&lt;ref&gt;AACSB Standards http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/standards.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AMBA Criteria http://www.mbaworld.com/accreditationcriteria&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EQUIS Standards and Criteria http://www.efmd.org/accreditation-main/equis/equis-guides&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scope of business school accreditation for the three main global accrediting bodies AACSB, EQUIS and AMBA.png|thumb|right|400px|Scope of business school accreditation for AACSB, EQUIS and AMBA]]

*Scope of accreditation
:AACSB has the broadest scope, as it accredits management and accounting programs at the entire university (e.g. management programs at the business school and the school of engineering) and grants university-wide accreditation.
:AMBA has the most focused scope as it accredits only the business school's portfolios of [[MBA]] programs (full-time, part-time, executive, distance-learning), [[Master of Business and Management|MBM]] programs (including [[MSc]] International Management) and [[Doctor of Business Administration|DBA]] (also known as DMgt in China).
:EQUIS's scope ranks in the middle, as it accredits the business school but not the university and not specific portfolios of programs.
*Duration of the accreditation process
:AACSB: 2–7 years
:AMBA: 9–18 months
:EQUIS: 2–3 years
*Reaccreditation
:AACSB: full re-accreditation every 5 or 10 years (the 10-year accreditation is being phased out)
:AMBA: full re-accreditation every 3 or 5 years (1-year accreditation is a possible outcome of reaccreditation in exceptional circumstances)
:EQUIS: full re-accreditation every 3 or 5 years
*School audit team
:AACSB's peer review team includes deans and business school administrators.
:AMBA's assessment team includes deans, associate deans, program directors and one AMBA representative.
:EQUIS's team includes three deans and one corporate representative.
*Evaluation report content
:AACSB's report reflects compliance with the AACSB standards
:AMBA's report includes compliance with criteria, conditions and recommendations
:EQUIS's report reflects compliance with the EQUIS standards
*Criteria/Standards size
:AACSB: 77 pages for Business Accreditation; 36 pages for Accounting Accreditation
:AMBA: 24 pages (9 pages for MBA; 9 pages for MBM; 6 pages for DBA)
:EQUIS: 71 pages
*Quantitative vs Qualitative
:AACSB has more quantitative criteria (checklists)
:AMBA has more qualitative criteria
:EQUIS is in the middle (between AACSB and AMBA)
*Internationalization
:AACSB conducts the evaluation against the school's own mission, so AACSB has no internationalization requirement unless internationalization is part of the school's mission.
:AMBA has internationalization criteria for research, curriculum and student enrolment. However, these are reviewed in a regional context for less internationalized regions (e.g. Latin America and Russia).
:EQUIS has strict requirements on internationalization.
*Faculty numbers
:AACSB: prescribed faculty ratios (AQ/PQ ratio)
:AMBA: no prescribed faculty-to-students ratio
:EQUIS: prescribed minimum numbers of faculty

*Visiting faculty
:AACSB disapproves of heavy use of visiting faculty.
:AMBA allows the visiting faculty model, as long as the visiting faculty are managed by the core faculty (and as long as the quality and course content is monitored).
:EQUIS disapproves of heavy use of visiting faculty.
*Research
:AACSB requires research in line with the mission of the school.
:AMBA requires research and publications in international refereed journals or proof of impactful research at national level.
:EQUIS requires research with an international dimension.
*Program-specific criteria
*:AACSB has no program-specific standards since it evaluates the entire university.
*:AMBA has program-specific criteria such as:
** at least 3 years of full-time work experience for all admitted MBA students;
** at least 500 contact hours (scheduled class hours) for a full-time MBA curriculum and a minimum of 120 contact hours for a distance-learning MBA;
** at least 20 students enrolled in an MBA program;
*:EQUIS has some program-specific standards in the context of the evaluation of the entire business school.
*Accreditation fees
:AACSB: 47,000 USD for initial business accreditation (or 63,500 USD for both business and accounting accreditation). In addition, an annual business accreditation fee is charged: 4,500 USD annually for a 5-year accreditation cycle or 2,500 USD annually for a 10-year accreditation cycle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/fees.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
:AMBA: 22,000 GBP for initial accreditation or 15,000 GBP for re-accreditation.
:EQUIS: 52,800 EUR for a 5-year initial accreditation or re-accreditation and 46,200 EUR for a 3-year initial accreditation or re-accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.efmd.org/index.php/accreditation-main/equis/equis-fee-structure&lt;/ref&gt;

== Schools ==

There are 87 triple-accredited schools based in 33 countries and territories as of March 2018:&lt;ref&gt;AMBA-accredited schools: http://www.ambaguide.com/find-an-accredited-programme/schools/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AACSB-accredited schools: {{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/accreditedmembers.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AOGQe8CN?url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/accreditedmembers.asp |archivedate=2012-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EQUIS-accredited schools: http://www.efmd.org/accreditation-main/equis/accredited-schools&lt;/ref&gt;

== Top schools without triple accreditation ==


One reason for this is that a (small) number of top business schools choose not to allocated the work resource and incur the financial cost required for international accreditation and rely only on accreditation by their national accrediting body (usually the country's education ministry).

Another reason is that the top schools in some regions do not meet one or more of the detailed criteria of the accrediting institutions and choose not to amend their policy. Notable examples are some top US business schools: [[Harvard Business School]], [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton]], [[Stanford Graduate School of Business|Stanford GSB]], [[Columbia Business School]], [[Chicago Booth]], [http://www.tuck.edu Tuck School of Business], etc., which do not meet [[Association of MBAs|AMBA]]'s mandatory three-year student-work-experience requirement for all MBA students.

A third reason is that most of the 509 schools that have obtained AACSB accreditation in the US and Canada (either via the standard accreditation process or via the granting of accreditation based on their reputation as top schools) do not look outside of North America for further validation, such as through European or British accreditation.

'''''Typo Attack''''' is an educational game for the [[Atari 8-bit family]] written by David Buehler and published by the [[Atari Program Exchange]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="giantlist"/&gt; Buehler was seventeen when the game won the {{USD|25,000}} [[Atari Star Award]] for the best APX program of 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/v2n1/insideatari.html|journal=Antic|title=Inside Atari: Star Award Winner|date=April 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Typo Attack'' is designed to improve the user's typing skill.

In 1983, Buehler had two action games published by the Atari Program Exchange: '' Wyzle!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wyzle! |url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-wyzle_5872.html |website=Atari Mania}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Impact''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Impact |url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-impact_2558.html |website=Atari Mania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The game takes place on a single screen, divided up into multiple columns. At the bottom of each column is a letter or punctuation symbol and various enemies appear randomly at the top of the columns. Players must press the corresponding letter in a column in order to make the letter fire at the advancing enemies. If an enemy reaches the bottom of the screen they will remove part of the shield around the letter, and if it is eaten away completely the player will lose a life. Depending on the level, the letters assigned to each column will change at irregular intervals.

==Ports==
In 1984, Atari, Inc. moved ''Typo Attack'' into its official line as a cartridge (RX8057). A version was planned for the unreleased Atari CX-3000 Graduate, an add-on which turned the [[Atari 2600]] into a home computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/2600/a3000.html|title=The Atari CX-3000 "Graduate" Computer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9922">The '''UCAS Tariff''' (formerly called '''UCAS Points System''') is used to allocate points to post-16 qualifications. Universities and colleges may use it when making offers to applicants. A points total is achieved by converting qualifications such as A levels (and many others) into points, making it simpler for course providers to compare applicants. It is used as a means of giving students from the [[United Kingdom]] places at [[UK universities]].

Common ways for UCAS points to be calculated are through the UCAS Tariff Calculator, official tariff tables, or through third-party software and websites.

The UCAS Tariff was first introduced in 2001. Since then, however, both the range of qualifications held by applicants, and the variety of progression routes into [[higher education]] have increased. Therefore a new Tariff was introduced. The new UCAS Tariff points are based on a different methodology. The change to new UCAS Tariff will not in itself change entry requirements for university or college courses. Universities and colleges are independent organisations and each year they decide how to set their entry requirements. Those universities and colleges that use UCAS Tariff points to express their entry requirements will simply set their requirements using the new number system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ucas.com/advisers/guides-and-resources/tariff-2017|title=Tariff 2017|date=2014-10-08|newspaper=UCAS|access-date=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United Federation of Teachers''' ('''UFT''') is the [[trade union|labor union]] that represents most teachers in New York City [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]]. {{As of|2005}}, there were about 118,000 in-service teachers and 17,000 [[paraprofessional educator]]s in the union, as well as about 54,000 retired members. In October 2007, 28,280 home day care providers voted to join the union. It is affiliated with the [[American Federation of Teachers]], the [[AFL-CIO]] and the [[Central Labor Council]]. It is also the largest member of [[New York State United Teachers]], which is affiliated with the [[National Educational Association]] and [[Education International]].

== History ==
Two previous unions of New York schoolteachers, the [[Teachers Union]], founded in 1916, and the [[Teachers Guild]], founded in 1935, failed to gather widespread enrollment or support. Many of the early leaders were [[pacifism|pacifists]] or [[Socialism|socialists]] and so frequently met with clashes against more [[Right-wing politics|right-leaning]] newspapers and organizations of the time, as [[red-baiting]] was fairly common. The ethnically and ideologically diverse teachers associations of the city made the creation of a single organized body difficult, with each association continuing to vie for its own priorities irrespective of the others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isreview.org/issue/80/different-kind-teachers-union A different kind of teachers union.] Review by Peter Lamphere and Gina Sartori. International Socialist Review. Issue #80. November 2011. Review of: Reds at the Blackboard: Communism, Civil Rights, and the New York City Teachers Union By Clarence Taylor. Columbia University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UFT was founded in 1960, largely in response to perceived unfairness in the educational system's treatment of teachers. Pensions were awarded to retired teachers only if over 65 or with 35 years of service. Female teachers faced two years of mandatory unpaid maternity leave after they gave birth. Principals could discipline or fire teachers with almost no oversight. The schools, experiencing a massive influx of [[baby boomer]] students, often were on double or triple session. Despite being college-educated professionals, often holding advanced [[master's degrees]], teachers drew a salary of $66 per week, in 2005 dollars, the equivalent of $21,000 a year.

The UFT was created on March 16, 1960 and grew rapidly. On November 7, 1960, the union organized a major strike. The strike largely failed in its main objectives but obtained some concessions, as well as bringing much popular attention to the union. After much further negotiation, the UFT was chosen as the [[collective bargaining]] organization for all City teachers in December 1961.

[[Albert Shanker]], a controversial but successful organizer was president of the UFT from 1964 until 1984. He held an overlapping tenure as president of the national [[American Federation of Teachers]] from 1974 to his death in 1997.

In 1968, the UFT went on strike and shut down the school system in May and then again from September to November to protest the [[decentralization]] plan that was being put in place to give more neighborhoods community control. The [[New York City teachers' strike of 1968|Ocean Hill-Brownsville strike]] focused on the [[Ocean Hill, Brooklyn|Ocean Hill]]-Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn but, ironically, the schools in that area were among the few that were open in the entire city. The Ocean Hill-Brownsville crisis is often described as a turning point in the history of unionism and of civil rights, as it created a rift between African-Americans and the Jewish communities, two groups that were previously viewed as allied. The two sides threw accusations of racism and anti-Semitism at each other.

The 1970s were a time of fiscal crisis for New York City. In 1975, some 14,000 teachers were laid off and class size soared. Another strike addressed some of these complaints and gave long-serving teachers longevity benefits.

=== Caucuses ===
The Unity Caucus, formed in 1962, predominates in the union, holding nearly every leadership position. New Action formed in the 1980s as an opposition caucus but, since 2003, it has cross-endorsed Unity candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Philips, [http://gothamschools.org/2010/04/05/teachers-union-election-a-look-at-caucuses-and-candidates/ "Teachers union election: a look at caucuses and candidates,"] Gotham Schools, April 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The Movement of Rank and File Educators (MORE) is a new caucus, formed in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;James Cersonsky, [http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/13540/dissident_caucus_aims_to_give_nyc_teachers_union_m.o.r.e/ "Dissident Caucus Aims to Give NYC Teachers Union M.O.R.E."] ''In These Times'', July 17, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring 2013 UFT election campaign, president [[Michael Mulgrew]] (Unity) refused repeated requests to debate his opponent, Julie Cavanagh (MORE).&lt;ref&gt;Yoav Gonen and Carl Campanile, [http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/foe_uft_boss_is_chicken_FVQNQrCff4FvE3rOUxfdHP "Foe: UFT Boss is Chicken,"] ''New York Post'', March 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

According to UFT's Department of Labor records since 2005, when membership classifications were first reported, about 32% of the union's membership are considered retirees, with eligibility to vote in the union. UFT contracts also cover some non-members, known as [[agency fee]] payers, which, since 2005, have numbered comparatively about 1% of the size of the union's membership.&lt;ref name="OLMS"/&gt; As of 2013 this accounts for 59,444 retirees and 2,675 non-members paying agency fees, compared to 124,145 "active" members.&lt;ref name="OLMS_LM-2_2013-12-23"/&gt;

== Current issues ==
The previous president of the UFT, [[Randi Weingarten]], resigned in 2009 to lead the AFT. She has clashed repeatedly with the [[List of mayors of New York City|mayors]] of the city; in particular with former mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]] and mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]]. Bloomberg made student promotion to [[third grade|third]], [[sixth grade|sixth]] and [[eighth grade]] contingent upon performance on [[standardized test]]s, which the UFT and the [[New York Board of Regents]] have criticized as being flawed.

The UFT opposes [[merit pay]] for teachers, opting for [[seniority]]-based pay, but joined in November 2007, with Mayor Bloomberg in agreeing to a voluntary incentive program for high-achieving schools with high-needs populations. The union does not support a proposed reform of the seniority-based [[LIFO (education)]] law.  In July 2007,Weingarten collaborated with Mayor Bloomberg in supporting a modified merit pay program with bonuses to schools and additional bonuses targeted for specific teachers.&lt;ref name="NYT_agreebonuspay"&gt;Elissa Gootman, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/18/education/18schools.html?_r=0 "Teachers Agree to Bonus Pay Tied to Scores,"] The New York Times, October 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The UFT strongly supports the reduction of [[class size]]s for all subjects and grade levels in New York City public schools.

The UFT, under the leadership of presidents Weingarten and Mulgrew, has collaborated with tenets of the [[education reform]] movement, such as support for [[value-added modeling]] for [[teacher quality assessment|teacher evaluation]].&lt;ref name="NYT_agreebonuspay"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maura Walz, [http://gothamschools.org/2010/07/28/klein-mulgrew-to-help-pitch-new-yorks-race-to-the-top-plan/ "Klein, Mulgrew to help pitch New York’s Race to the Top plan,"] Gotham Schools, July 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lawsuit against school co-location ==
In May 2011, the UFT, along with the NAACP and others, filed a lawsuit against the New York City Department of Education to stop school closings and the co-location of schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourschoolsnyc.org/2011/05/uft-naacp-elected-officials-parents-sue-to-halt-closing-and-co-location-plans-for-dozens-of-public-schools/ |title=UFT, NAACP, elected officials, parents, sue to halt closing and co-location plans for dozens of public schools |publisher=Our Schools NYC |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gustafson |first=Anna |url=http://www.qchron.com/news/queenswide/article_f4433486-6ede-5d65-94b7-521272eac83b.html |title=UFT, NAACP sue city to stop school closures – Queens Chronicle: News |publisher=Qchron.com |date=May 19, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/uft_naacp_to_file_suit_to_stop_public_KUZtpfn0c16qRz1R8cjwZK |title=United Federation of Teachers, NAACP to file suit to stop 22 public school closures |work=New York Post  |date=May 18, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lawsuit, the union charged that the Department of Education was improperly closing schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Decker |first=Geoff |url=http://gothamschools.org/2011/06/08/naacps-dukes-defends-suit-im-not-against-charter-schools/ |title=NAACP’s Dukes defends suit: "I’m not against charter schools" |publisher=GothamSchools |date=June 8, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SHELLEY NG PIX11.com May 19, 2011 |url=http://www.wpix.com/news/morningnews/wpix-naacp-uft-schools,0,7362326.story |title=UFT/NAACP To File Suit To Stop Closure Of Schools |publisher=WPIX |date=May 19, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawsuit also asked the court to stop school co-locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gordy |first=Cynthia |url=http://www.theroot.com/views/naacp-and-charter-school-debate |title=NAACP Lawsuit Against Charter Schools: Latest Salvo in Education Fight |publisher=Theroot.com |date=June 23, 2011|accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/06/21/battle-over-nyc-public-school-resources-given-to-charter-schools-pits-parent-against-parent/ |title=War Over New York City Charters Schools Using Public School Resources Lands In Manhattan Supreme Court « CBS New York |publisher=Newyork.cbslocal.com |date=June 21, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fertig |first=Beth |url=http://www.wnyc.org/articles/wnyc-news/2011/jun/21/teachers-union-and-naacp-take-city-court-over-school-closings-and-charters/ |title=City Goes to Court Over Charter Schools |publisher=WNYC |date=June 21, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before a court hearing on the suit in June 2011, parent groups held a news conference to thank the NAACP for fighting on behalf of all kids and to press for fairness and equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cramer |first=Philissa |url=http://gothamschools.org/2011/06/21/as-hearing-begins-uft-and-naacp-drop-three-schools-from-suit/ |title=As hearing begins, UFT and NAACP drop three schools from suit |publisher=GothamSchools |date=June 21, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uft.org/news/judge-asked-rule-gross-inequality |title=Judge asked to rule on 'gross inequality' &amp;#124; United Federation of Teachers |publisher=Uft.org |date=June 21, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York City Parents Union]] filed its own lawsuit in June 2011 to stop co-locations and school closings, stating, “Despite inconsistent and uncertain results, the DOE continues to push public school parents into a privately managed school system where many charters perform worse than the public schools while failing to serve their fair share of students with special needs and English Language Learners.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycparentsunion.org/?p=173 |title=Parents Union Files Lawsuit over School Closings &amp; Co-locations « New York City Parents Union |publisher=Nycparentsunion.org |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preventing layoffs ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8831">The '''United States Society for Education through Art (USSEA)''' is an [[United States|American]] national association whose members work in curriculum development, teaching and research related to [[art education]] and [[Culture|cultural]] differences, and who share interests in [[art]] educational content and strategies which promote tolerance and appreciation of [[the arts]] of non-mainstream cultural peoples. The mission of the society is to promote greater understanding and respect for learners from all [[ethnic]], [[Minority group|minority]], and socio-cultural backgrounds through research, art curricula, instruction, and practices that are inclusive and culturally sensitive.&lt;ref name="dejong1985"&gt;DeJong, M. (Ed.) (1985). ''USSEA Handbook and Operations Manual''. Cincinnati, OH: United States Society for Education through Art. Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The society provides a platform for networking and a resource base for art educators nationally and internationally, who seek to work collaboratively on projects of interest to [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] or cross-cultural [[Community|communities]] and [[student]]s, [[Publishing|publishes]] instructional resources for [[Teacher|classroom teachers]], encourages and sponsors cross-cultural research, and facilitates international and intra-national professional relationships through online sites, [[Symposium|symposia]], [[Academic conference|conferences]], and publications.&lt;ref name="manifold2008"&gt;Manifold, M. C., Zimmerman, E. (Eds) (2008). ''USSEA Handbook and Operations Manual''. 5th edition Cincinnati, OH: United States Society for Education through Art. Page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, USSEA honors one national and one international art educator, each of whom has demonstrated exemplary teaching, service, or research in the area of multicultural or cross-cultural art education with the Ziegfeld Art Education award. The ''Journal of Cultural Research in Art Education'' is a publication of USSEA that is made available to all members of the art educational profession. Through the [[website]], members may access suggestions and recommendations for appropriate multi-culturally oriented [[K-12 (education)|K-12]] art lessons, and receive up-to-date news and information about USSEA initiatives, programs and opportunities. Additionally, exhibitions of [[Child|children's]] art from countries around the world are presented at national conferences of art educators and through an online gallery of children's art, which is organized by topical themes and maintained on the USSEA website.&lt;ref name="manifold2008" /&gt;

==History==
USSEA was founded in 1977 as an affiliate of the [[International Society for Education Through Art]] (InSEA) and the [[National Art Education Association]] (NAEA). The goals of USSEA reflect, on a national level, the goals of its international parent organization InSEA, which in turn, was inspired by the spirit of [[Aftermath of World War II|postwar]] hope and optimism of its parent affiliate [[UNESCO]]. In a paper describing the early history of InSEA, the motivational energy and overarching goals of UNESCO and InSEA are explained.

"The world had just come through a terrible and protracted [[World War II|war]], one initiated by false philosophies working on ignorance through massive control of [[Freedom of speech|free speech]]. The impulse in 1945, to try to ensure that it did not happen again, and that people should understand each other better through [[education]] and all forms of cultural and [[Science|scientific]] exchanges, the passionate emphasis on [[truth]], [[justice]], [[peace]] and the [[Individualism|importance of the individual]] – these impulses were irresistible."&lt;ref name=steers2001&gt;Steers, J. (2001). InSEA: A Brief History and a Vision of its Future Role. International Journal of Art &amp; Design Education 20 (2), 215-229.&gt;, additional text. (Hoggart quoted in Steers, 2001, p. 216)&lt;/ref&gt;

These sentiments, which gave root to InSEA in 1954, are also guiding principles of USSEA. Art educator Kenneth Marantz was instrumental in establishing the United States organization and served as its first president. Other founding members who served as officers included Maryl Fletcher De Jong, Larry Kantner, Eugenia Oole, Helen Patton, and Tom Sletterhaugh.&lt;ref name="dejong19852"&gt;De Jong, M. F. (1985). ''USSEA Handbook: Historical Record''. Cincinnati, OH: United States Society for Education through Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sponsored Activities==
As a means of disseminating shared ideas about the importance of teaching art to increasingly diverse populations and to develop research agenda for determining effective practices of multicultural art education, USSEA began sponsored conferences and symposia. Fourteen such events were held between 1977 and 2010. The topics addressed included "Limits and Extents of International Research in Art Education" (1977), "Art Education: The [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Basin" (1982), "International Aspects of Teaching [[Aesthetics]] and Critical Skills" (1987), "[[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous People]], Art, and Place: Interactions of Culture and Environment in Contemporary Life" (1994) and "Crossing Cultural, Artistic, and Cyber Borders" (2000),&lt;ref name="lapierre2000"&gt;LaPierre, S. D., Stokrocki, M., &amp; Zimmerman, E. (2000). "Research methods and methodologies for multicultural and cross-cultural issues in art education." Crossing Cultural, Artists, and Cyber Borders: Issues and Examples in Art Education Conference, (Tempe, Arizona, January 7–8, 2000). Boulder, CO: United States Society for Education through Art, additional text.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Youth and Community Development: How the Arts Serve [[Poverty|Economically Impoverished]] Communities" (2010). The 1991 USSEA Symposium, "Beyond the [[Tradition]]al in Art: Facing a Pluralistic Society," resulted in the publication of working papers and research agenda that helped focus cultural art educational research and practices during the late 20th and early 21st century.&lt;ref name="manifold2009"&gt;Manifold, M. C. (Ed.) (2009). USSEA handbook: Historical record, 5th edition. Bloomington, IN: United States Society for Education through Art. Page 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1986, USSEA has presented two annual awards in the name of Edwin Ziegfeld, founding president of InSEA (1954–1960) and NAEA (1947–1951), to honor an American art educator and a foreign art educator who have made distinguished leadership contributions to international art education. These awards are presented to the recipients during a USSEA Awards banquet held during the annual NAEA conference.&lt;ref name="ussea2007"&gt;USSEA. (2007). The Edwin Ziegfeld Awards. ''Arts &amp; Activities, 142'' (2). 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first issue of the USSEA publication ''The Journal of Multicultural and Cross-cultural Research in Art Education'' was issued in 1983 with Larry Kantner as senior editor. In 2001, the title of the journal was changed to the ''Journal of Cultural Research in Art Education'' (JCRAE). Articles published in JCRAE focus on social/cultural research relevant for art education, including cultural foundations of art education, cross-cultural and multicultural research in art education, and cultural aspects of art in education. These areas may be interpreted in a broad sense to include arts administration, [[art therapy]], community arts organizations, and other disciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches relevant to art education. Articles considered for publication may feature theoretical research and research in which qualitative and/or quantitative methods as well as other formats and strategies are employed. In addition to the publication of a [[Magazine|journal]], USSEA sponsors [[monograph]]s and sponsors or endorses books that address issues of interest and concern to art educators.&lt;ref name="jcrae"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ussea.sdstate.org/AboutJCRAE.htm|title=Journal of Cultural Studies in Art Education|work=Official site|publisher=USSEA|accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Watson McMillan Hayes''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|赫|士}}|p={{linktext|Hè|shì}}}}, born November 23, 1857 in [[Mercer County, Pennsylvania]] - died August 2, 1944 in Weifang, Shandong) was an American Presbyterian missionary and educator in China.

== Biography ==
Watson M. Hayes was the son of David Hayes (born April 6, 1832, killed in February 1865 in the [[American Civil War]]) and Margaret Jane (Watson) Hayes (born June 28, 1828). He graduated from [[Allegheny College]]&lt;ref name=pahist&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xB0VAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA902 A twentieth century history of Mercer County, Pennsylvania, Lewis Publishing Company]&lt;/ref&gt; and entered Western Seminary, Pittsburgh in 1879. 

On August 15, 1882, he was ordained and sent to China in the same year.&lt;ref name=presmindict&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9WXozG4cLPIC&amp;pg=PA301 Biography of Watson McMillan Hayes, The Presbyterian Ministerial Directory, 1898]&lt;/ref&gt; He taught at Tengchow College and later served as its president&lt;ref name=lutz1971&gt;Jessie Gregory Lutz, China and the Christian Colleges, 1850-1950, Cornell University Press, Ithaca, New York 1971&lt;/ref&gt; in present-day [[Penglai City|Penglai]], [[Shandong]]. In 1901, he was invited by [[Yuan Shikai]] to organize Shandong College,&lt;ref name=heeren1940&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3zYsAAAAIAAJ John J. Heeren (1940): On the Shantung Front, The board of foreign Mission of the presbyterian church in the United States of America]&lt;/ref&gt; the forerunner of [[Shandong University]] and the second modern university in China. With the backing of Yuan Shikai, he also published Shandong's first successful newspaper (Shantung Times, {{zh|c={{linktext|山|东|时|报}}|p={{linktext|Shān|dōng |Shí|bào}}}}) and petitioned the Qing court to grant a holiday on Sundays for government schools and colleges;&lt;ref name=1stuniv&gt;[http://www.weihsien-paintings.org/Mprevite/EbaoMonthly/CalvinMateer.htm Qu Zheng-Min, "China's first university"]&lt;/ref&gt; Shandong College was closed on Sundays right from the start.&lt;ref name=heeren1940/&gt; However, by the end of 1901, Hayes and six Chinese Christian teachers he had brought with him had resigned already&lt;ref name=heeren1940/&gt; over disagreements regarding the policy of mandatory [[Confucius]] worship for students of the college.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=N7JfoaVbMGgC&amp;pg=PA315 Ulrich van der Heyden (Editor), Holger Stoecker (Editor) 2005: "Mission und Macht im Wandel politischer Orientierungen", Franz Steiner Verlag]&lt;/ref&gt; After that, Hayes went on to teach at the Presbyterian Mission Theological College in Cheefoo ([[Yantai]]). 

When the Shandong Christian University was formed through an agreement between the Northern Presbyterian mission and the English Baptist mission, Haynes became the dean of the Theological College in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bdcconline.net/en/stories/h/hayes-watson.php|title=Watson Hayes|last=Stockment|first=Martha|website=Biographical Dictionary of Chinese Christianity|access-date=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after theological conflicts arose in the college due to the [[Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy|fundamentalist-modernist controversy]], Haynes was asked to resign in 1919. He would later be appointed as the principal of the newly formed [[North China Theological Seminary]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Fundamentalist Movement Among Protestant Missionaries in China, 1920-1937|last=Yao|first=Kevin Xiyi|publisher=University Press of America|year=2003|isbn=9780761827405|location=Lanham, MD|pages=139-182}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], W. M. Hayes, together with his wife (Margaret Young Hayes) and one of his sons (John David Hayes), was held as a prisoner in the [[The Weihsien Compound|Weihsien (Weixian) Internment Camp]], a civilian assembly center operated by the Japanese on the premises of a former Presbyterian mission in the present-day town of [[Weifang]]. Hayes was forced to leave from his home for the camp in March 1943. He refused to be repatriated under the "Prisoners Exchange Project" organized by the International Red Cross. Suffering from [[diabetes]], W. M. Hayes died in the camp on August 2, 1944, a bit more than one year before the camp was liberated by the Americans on August 12, 1945.

W. M. Hayes' son John D. Hayes (1888–1957), continued to work as a missionary and English teacher in China until he was arrested and tried as a spy in 1951. After 10 months in jail, he was expelled from China.&lt;ref name=desertnews&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&amp;dat=19530310&amp;id=3CwhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=x3oFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3029,1366856 "China-Born American Sees Mao-Russ Rift", ''Desert News and Telegram'', March 10, 1953]&lt;/ref&gt; His trial in China was the topic of an article ("The Brainwashing of John Hayes", written by Frederic Sondern, Jr) published in ''[[Readers Digest]]'' (July 1955) and a television drama of the same title (teleplay by George Bruce, aired on [[TV Reader's Digest]] by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on 7 November 1955) in which Hayes was portrayed by the actor [[Vincent Price]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2152">The '''Woolmer lecture''' is the flagship lecture of the [[Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine]]. It takes place annually during the Institute's Medical Physics and Engineering Conference.

== Dedication ==
The lecture is dedicated to Professor Ronald Woolmer who was the first Director of the Research Department of Anaesthetics at the [[Royal College of Surgeons]]. Woolmer convened a meeting at the Royal College of Surgeons, London, to discuss the evolving field of engineering applied to medicine. It was agreed that the group should hold regular meetings and as a result the Biological Engineering Society (BES) was formed with Ronald Woolmer as the first President. Woolmer died two years after the formation of the BES and it was agreed that a memorial lecture would be sponsored in recognition of his achievements.

The game is a follow-up on the same developer's ''Gun Disassembly'' series, first released in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noble-empire.com/about.php|title=About - Noble Empire Corp. Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; expanding on the latter's feature set and library of interactive models.

The software can be used as both an interactive firearms reference source and encyclopedia,&lt;ref name="tfb-review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2014/10/16/world-guns-gun-disassembly/|title=''Johnson, Steve'' World of Guns: Gun Disassembly: My favorite gun app|website=The Firearm Blog|date=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Casual game|casual]] puzzle game with a goal of disassembling and assembling models in the correct sequence and in the least possible time.

== Gameplay ==
The player is presented with an interactive model of a real-world firearm (or other mechanism) in a 3D environment. Player has complete control of the camera, along with additional viewing options allowing them to explore the inner mechanical design of the piece. These include a multi-layered X-ray view, "trainer [[Cutaway drawing|cutaway]]" mode and several slow-motion settings.

Depending on the game mode, the player is required to either learn the correct operation of the weapon, or perform its disassembly or assembly. Game modes are arranged in the order of increasing complexity, including field-stripping the weapon, complete disassembly of the mechanism, and finally disassembly and assembly against the clock and/or with penalties for incorrect moves. Every model has local and global leaderboards and a set of in-game achievements. The game includes interactive shooting ranges with timed objectives,&lt;ref name="launchparty"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://launchpartygaming.com/reviews/pc-reviews/2016/world-guns-gun-disassembly-review/|title=''Nate L.'' World of Guns: Gun Disassembly Review|website=Launch Party Gaming|date=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as additional features like gun quizzes and a weapon skin editor.

''World of Guns: Gun Disassembly'' is offered as a [[free-to-play]] title. To unlock the initially unavailable models, a player can either spend in-game credits earned through gameplay, or use [[Microtransaction|microtransactions]]. Bulk [[Downloadable content|DLC]] packs are available, including a lifetime access bundle which gives the user access to all current and future models in the library.&lt;ref name="wog-steampage" /&gt;

== Models Library ==
One of the game's principal features is a constantly expanding catalog of animated 3D models that dates back to 2010 (the date of initial ''Gun Disassembly'' app's release). On average, developer Noble Empire has been releasing one to two new models monthly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noble-empire.com/news.php|title=News - Noble Empire Corp. Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to developers, 3D models are drawn and animated using actual weapons, original technical documentation and photographic sources.&lt;ref name="wog-appstore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/world-of-guns/id1143779751?mt=12|title=World of Guns App Store page|accessdate=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the ''World of Guns'' library consists of 205 models, with over 23,200 individual animated parts total.&lt;ref name="wog-appstore" /&gt; This includes historical and modern firearms, as well as several artillery pieces, motorcycles, automobiles (including [[Humvee]] and [[DeLorean DMC-12]]), an armored vehicle ([[BMP-3]]) and a [[warbird]] ([[Vought F4U Corsair|F4U Corsair]]). Another set of "bonus" models includes dinosaur and mammal skeletons.

=== Reviews ===
The game has received generally positive reviews. Notably, Steve Johnson, the founder of a popular gun enthusiast online publication ''The Firearm Blog'', described ''World of Guns'' as "my favorite gun app, without a doubt". Johnson noted his use of the game as a reference guide and learning aid: "I have even used it to figure out how to fit some old mil-surplus guns I own".&lt;ref name="tfb-review" /&gt; [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] praised ''World of Guns'' and its earlier iterations on multiple occasions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/11/13/simulation-game-a-to-z/#more-328233|title=''Stone, Tim'' The Flare Path, Alphabetised|website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|date=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rps-emilygera"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/05/09/world-of-guns-free-ww2-unlocks/|title=''Gera, Emily'' This is my rifle|website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|date=May 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at one point comparing it favorably to ''[[Car Mechanic Simulator 2014|Car Mechanic Simulator]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/07/15/car-mechanic-simulator-2014-review/|title=''Stone, Tim'' Wot I Think: Car Mechanic Simulator 2014|website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|date=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; RPS reviewers described the game as "disarmingly obsessive and up-front", "mesmerizing", "a pleasing almost ritualistic act",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/03/08/the-flare-path-maxims-to-live-by/#more-144790|title=''Stone, Tim'' The Flare Path: Maxims To Live By|website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|date=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and noted that "[previously, we] called its gameplay "almost philosophical", which is partly a joke but I think very true".&lt;ref name="rps-emilygera" /&gt;

[[TouchArcade]]'s review of the early version of the ''Gun Disassembly'' game was lukewarm (2.5/5 stars), commending it as a "technical app with an extraordinary amount of detail", and "a singular experience", but noting its "limited appeal" and expressing doubts if it qualifies to be called a game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toucharcade.com/2010/05/11/gun-disassembly-3d-review-second-amendment-meet-the-app-store/|title=''Lettieri, Peter'' Gun Disassembly 3D Review: Second Amendment, Meet the App Store|website=TouchArcade|date=May 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Launch Party Gaming reviewer criticized the "pay-to-win" model used by the game, but praised it as a "must have for gun enthusiasts" and a "great simulator" (6.5/10).&lt;ref name="launchparty" /&gt; The review by firearms blog Guns.Com has pointed out that ''World of Guns'' is "a bit rough", but called its core functionality "outstanding" and a "unique resource", described the microtransactions model as "reasonable", and underlined its utility as reference for servicing actual firearms. The reviewer went on to say that "...when I buy a gun I usually check to see if WoG has a model of it, and if there is one, I’ll buy it"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guns.com/review/gear-review-world-of-guns-software-disassembles-your-guns-virtually/|title=Guns.Com|website=Andy C – Gear Review: World of Guns software disassembles your guns virtually|date=June 6, 2017|accessdate=2017-06-06|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
