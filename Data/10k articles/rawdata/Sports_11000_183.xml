The '''Alexandra Recreation Ground''', also known as '''Nantwich Road''', was a multi-sport venue in [[Crewe]] in [[England]]. It was the home ground of [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]], and also hosted an [[England national football team|England]] home match and an [[FA Cup]] semi-final.

==History==
The ground was opened in 1877, and was used for athletics, cricket, cycle racing and football. An oval ground, it had a stand around 100 feet long on the western side and banking around the remainder of the pitch.&lt;ref name=UD&gt;Paul Smith &amp; Shirley Smith (2005) ''The Ultimate Directory of English &amp; Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005'', Yore Publications, p13, {{ISBN|0954783042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1886–87 FA Cup|1886–87 season]] the ground was the venue of the [[FA Cup]] semi-final between [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], with the attendance of 7,000 probably being the ground record. On 4 February 1888 the ground [[England national football team home stadium|hosted]] the opening match of the [[1887–88 British Home Championship]], which saw [[England national football team|England]] beat [[Wales national football team|Wales]] 5–1. Crewe were founder members of the [[Football League Second Division]] in 1892, and the first League match played at the ground saw Crewe defeat [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] 1–0 in front of 2,000 spectators.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

The last match at the ground was played on 28 March 1896, with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool's]] 7–0 win on the day also being Crewe's record home defeat at the ground. However, it was not Crewe's last home league match of the season, which was played at the Vicarage in the nearby town of [[Sandbach]]. Crewe were voted out of the Football League at the end of the [[1895–96 Football League|1895–96 season]], and subsequently played at several different grounds until returning to the area to play at the original Gresty Road ground in 1897.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt; They later moved to the modern-day [[Gresty Road]] ground in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Smith &amp; Smith, p62&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alexandra Recreation Ground is now the site of the Rail House office building, a car park and part of the modern Gresty Road stadium.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

'''aussieBum''' is an Australian men's [[swimwear]] and [[underwear]] manufacturer.

All aussieBum underwear and swimwear is manufactured in Sydney's inner west. Some  aussieBum lifestyle and apparel products are manufactured overseas in Vietnam,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aussiebum.com/t_shirts/chino-short-king/3566|title=Chino short - King|website=www.aussiebum.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thailand&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aussiebum.com/t_shirts/drylite-surf-short-red/3634|title=Drylite Surf Short - Red|website=www.aussiebum.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aussiebum.com/t_shirts/longline-tank-apollo/3554|title=Longline Tank - Apollo|website=www.aussiebum.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All products are designed and despatched from Sydney, with the business run completely out of the company's headquarters in the suburb of [[Leichhardt, New South Wales|Leichhardt]].

==History==
In 2001, director Sean Ashby started aussieBum when he couldn’t find the style of nylon [[swimwear|swimmers]] he grew up with. The company had an inauspicious launch in the middle of the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com bust]], and at the time the original website ran from a suburban lounge room, created by Ashby.

Since starting out with only [[Australian dollar|A$]]20,000 in 2001, aussieBum is now a multi million-dollar global enterprise, still manufacturing over 1 million mens underwear and swimwear garments in New South Wales Australia annually and now manufacturing apparel overseas also.

==Marketing==
The company has no sales representatives overseas but relies on the strength of the company website. Australian sales make up only 10% of its business, and is on its way to [[Australian dollar|A$]]20&amp;nbsp;million in annual sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Newman, Geoffrey |title=Australian IT: Internet can overcome the name |url=http://australianit.news.com.au/articles/0,7204,21642296%5E15841%5E%5Enbv%5E,00.html |date=2007-04-30 |accessdate=2007-05-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502154436/http://australianit.news.com.au/articles/0%2C7204%2C21642296%5E15841%5E%5Enbv%5E%2C00.html |archivedate=2 May 2007 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has a broad reach for a business run entirely via the Web, with no shop front and minimal packing staff.&lt;ref name="International Herald Tribune"&gt;{{cite web|author=International Herald Tribune |title=Aussiebum: Down Under designs in more ways than one |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/01/21/style/raus.php |date=2008-01-21 |accessdate=2008-05-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529033948/http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/01/21/style/raus.php |archivedate=29 May 2008 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brand retails in some of the biggest department stores in the world such as [[Selfridges]], [[Harrods]] and [[House of Fraser]] in the UK, [[Printemps]] in Paris, [[KaDeWe]] in Berlin, and [[Harvey Nichols]] in Dubai, as well as in small boutiques in various cities around the world. aussieBum's [[online shopping|online store]] ships to more than 150 countries with free delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Daily Telegraph |title=Wonderbra for men 'enhances' |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,20693132-2,00.html |date=2006-11-03 |accessdate=2007-04-18 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228224340/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C23599%2C20693132-2%2C00.html |archivedate=28 December 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AussieBum-ShearingRams.jpg|thumb|230px|aussieBum's version of ''[[Shearing the Rams]]'']]
AussieBum promotes their products on various social media platforms such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. The brand has a popular online following with the ''aussieBum'' being the 7th most popular search term in Australia.&lt;ref name="International Herald Tribune" /&gt; Cultivating the image of a larrikin Australian has also helped the company in getting noticed in overseas markets where residents are curious about Australian culture.

The brand uses a distinctly cheeky advertising style, such as remaking the iconic Australian painting ''[[Shearing the Rams]]'' with muscle-bound men shearing sheep in just their underwear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Byrnes, Holly|title=Daily Telegraph: Shear art attack|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,20500041-5006009,00.html|date=2006-09-30|accessdate=2007-04-18 |work=The Daily Telegraph|location=AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrities including [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Billy Connolly]], and [[Daniel Radcliffe]] are fans of aussieBum. Soccer superstar and men's fashion trendsetter [[David Beckham]] has also appeared in the brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=AAP|title=The Age: Bums rush|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/fashion/bums-rush/2005/10/20/1129401354721.html|date=2005-10-20|accessdate=2007-03-13 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AussieBum swimwear has been featured in music video clips ''Slow'' by [[Kylie Minogue]] and ''SuperMartXé VIP''

In 2011, during the first episode of [[The Celebrity Apprentice Australia]], director Sean Ashby gave $50,000 to charity when politician [[Pauline Hanson]] washed his car wearing aussieBum underwear, plus an additional $10,000 for [[Deni Hines]] to sing the national anthem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Christie, Joel|title=AussieBum gives Pauline Hanson $50,000 to strip to her underwear in Celebrity Apprentice car wash|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/pauline-hanson-strips-down-to-her-underwear-for-60000-car-wash-in-celebrity-apprentice-at-crystal-car-wash-bondi/story-e6frewz0-1226137028918|date=2011-09-14|accessdate=2011-12-15|work=Sydney Confidential The Daily Telegraph|location=AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wonderjock.jpg|thumb|200px|aussieBum men's [[Jockstrap]], with the ''Wonderjock Technology'']]

===Wonderjock===
In November 2006, the Wonderjock was launched in the aussieBum underwear lines. Wonderjocks have been designed to ''lift'' and ''enhance'' a man's genitals, through the use of a fabric cup used to protrude everything out instead of just down. 50,000 pairs of the new underwear were sold in the first seven days of being released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Daily Telegraph|title=Daily Telegraph: Market grows for under wonder|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUSSYD17865120061102|date=2006-11-01|accessdate=2007-04-18 | work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was chosen as a  pun on the popular [[Wonderbra]] line of women's [[push-up bra]]s.

In May 2007, the company also introduced Wonderjock technology into their swimwear line. Currently in the Classic, Storm, Precision and Loose varieties, a fabric pouch is used to enhance a man's package, particularly when getting out of cold water.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Since their release the Wonderjock styles have been altered and renamed Boosterjock, with the new design giving a more natural shape and less restrictive feel than the earlier version.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

'''Brockville Park''' was a [[association football|football]] stadium located on Hope Street in [[Falkirk]], [[Scotland]], {{convert|0.25|mi|km|1}} north-west of the town centre. It was the home of [[Falkirk F.C.]] from 1885 until the end of [[2002–03 in Scottish football|2002–03 Scottish football season]].&lt;ref name="Facts"&gt;[http://www.stforum.co.uk/wmslib/Pride__Passion/Falkirkfacts.pdf 50 Fascinating Falkirk Facts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326032902/http://www.stforum.co.uk/wmslib/Pride__Passion/Falkirkfacts.pdf |date=26 March 2012 }}, stforum.co.uk. Retrieved 2011-06-26.&lt;/ref&gt; The record attendance at Brockville Park was 23,100 on 21 February 1953 in a match against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].&lt;ref name="Team Profile"&gt;[http://www.scotprem.com/content/default.asp?page=s11_2 Team Profile &amp; History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221231628/http://www.scotprem.com/content/default.asp?page=s11_2 |date=21 February 2012 }}, Scottish Premier League. Retrieved 2011-06-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FGM"&gt;[http://www.footballgroundmap.com/ground/brockville-park/falkirk Brockville Park], FootballGroundMAP.com. Retrieved 2011-06-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays the stadium has since been replaced with a [[Morrisons]] [[supermarket]]. An old turnstile is on display next to the supermarket's car park.

== Layout ==
The main stand was situated to the west of the pitch and was mostly for home supporters and directors, with a small part towards the north end allocated to away fans. The Cooperage Lane terracing was to the south of the pitch and was for home supporters. The Watson Street terracing was to the north of the pitch and was for away fans. Part of the Watson Street end was closed in latter years as it failed to gain a safety certificate.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The Hope Street end was divided into home and away fans separated by a metal 'cage'.

== Controversy ==

=== SPL criteria ===
Falkirk were denied promotion to the [[Scottish Premier League]] on several occasions due to regulations and criteria which Brockville Park did not meet. The most recent was in the [[2002–03 in Scottish football|2002–03 season]] when Falkirk, despite winning the [[Scottish First Division|First Division]], were refused entry to the SPL. In preparation for winning the First Division that season, and the prospect of promotion, Falkirk started talks with several clubs over a [[Groundshare|ground-sharing]] partnership for the 2003-04 season.&lt;ref name="Share"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/falkirk/2646315.stm# Falkirk to share ground], BBC Sport. 2003-01-10. Retrieved 2011-06-26.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the SPL criteria stated at the time that ground-sharing was prohibited for clubs in the Premier League&lt;ref name="Prohibited"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/falkirk/2779539.stm?storyLink=%2Fsport1%2Fhi%2Ffootball%2Fscot_div_1%2F2751971.stm&amp;x=8&amp;y=11 Falkirk consider Airdrie switch], BBC Sport. 2003-02-19. Retrieved 2011-06-26.&lt;/ref&gt; so Falkirk remained in the First Division and tried to make a ground-share agreement whilst Brockville Park was demolished.&lt;ref name="Share"/&gt; Two potential partners were [[Airdrie United F.C.|Airdrie United]] with their [[Excelsior Stadium]] and [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]] with their ground of [[Broadwood Stadium]] in nearby Cumbernauld,&lt;ref name="Share"/&gt; a third option was to share [[Ochilview Park]] with local rivals [[Stenhousemuir F.C.|Stenhousemuir]] and eventually an agreement was made for Falkirk to play their home games at Ochilview for one season.

=== Poor facilities ===
In 2001, when [[Recreation Park, Alloa|Recreation Park]], the home of [[Alloa Athletic F.C.|Alloa Athletic]] was deemed unsuitable by police to host a match against Celtic due to its small capacity, Brockville Park was chosen as the venue for the [[Scottish Cup]] third-round tie.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; This was met with criticism from both clubs over the [[Scottish Football Association]] and their decision because the ground lacked [[under-soil heating]],&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; which was significant because the match was scheduled to be played in January at the height of winter. Another argument was that a previous match between Alloa and Celtic was relocated to [[Partick Thistle|Partick Thistle's]] [[Firhill Stadium]] in [[Glasgow]],&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; which is an all-seater stadium. Alloa Athletic's manager at the time, Terry Christie, had shown confusion to why the Scottish Cup tie was not also hosted at a similar venue, rather than Falkirk's Brockville Park, which contained [[Terrace (stadium)|terracing]] and was not an [[all-seater stadium]].&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

== Closure ==
Brockville Park was demolished towards the end of 2003, having remained largely unchanged for decades, and was considered unsafe to host matches in the [[Scottish Premier League]] due to its largely terraced spectator areas. The site was then sold to supermarket chain [[Morrisons]] who built a new branch in place of Brockville Park.&lt;ref name="Facts"/&gt; The supermarket contains memorabilia commemorating Falkirk's history at Brockville Park.&lt;ref name="Facts"/&gt; An old [[turnstile]] from the stadium is located just outside the supermarket.&lt;ref name="Facts"/&gt; The club ground-shared with local rivals [[Stenhousemuir F.C.|Stenhousemuir]] at [[Ochilview Park]] for the 2003&amp;ndash;04 football season whilst their new home, the [[Falkirk Stadium]] was being constructed. In 2004 Falkirk moved to their newly built stadium on the outskirts of the town.&lt;ref name="Move"&gt;[http://www.falkirkstadium.co.uk/pwpcontrol.php?pwpID=6191 Falkirk Football Club - Falkirk Stadium] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005064732/http://www.falkirkstadium.co.uk/pwpcontrol.php?pwpID=6191 |date=5 October 2011 }}, Falkirk Stadium.

==Greyhound racing==
Brockville Park became the second of three greyhound racing venues in Falkirk; the first was [[Firs Park]]. Racing took place from 16 July 1932 until 15 May 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File|page =414|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The racing ended due to competition from the nearby new custom built [[Diamond Stadium|Diamond Stadium/Brockville Greyhound Racecourse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.old-maps.co.uk/#/Map/288975/680293/12/100735|title=OS County Series Stirlingshire 1944|publisher=old-maps.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It cost an estimated £10,000 to build the greyhound track around the football pitch in 1932 and the management joined the British Greyhound Tracks Control Society (BGTCS), an organisation formed to assist tracks wishing to race under regulations and a rival to the bigger [[National Greyhound Racing Club]] (NGRC). The Brockville Park management led by Racing Manager Captain John Hill O.B.E (also a qualified vet) had purchased the greyhounds from the Crewe sales one week before the opening night. A six race card with tote betting only, formed the first meeting but that would be increased to eight races at a later date. The runners were cared for by former Firs Park trainer William Hay who would take over from Captain Hill the following year. The biggest event held at the track was called the Falkirk Greyhound Derby and racing sometimes took place immediately after football matches. The hope that the racing would ease the financial problems of Falkirk FC never materialised and it ended in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Date of opening of new Falkirk track, Thursday 7 July|year=1932|newspaper=Edinburgh Evening News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cheam Road''' is a [[cricket]] ground in [[Sutton, London|Sutton]], [[London]] (formerly [[Surrey]]).  The first recorded match on the ground was in 1940, when Sutton United Tramps played [[London Counties cricket team|London Counties]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/779_misc.html Other matches played on Cheam Road]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground held a single match in the 1955 [[Minor Counties Championship]] when the Surrey Second XI played the [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire Second XI]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/779_minc.html Minor Counties Championship Matches played on Cheam Road]&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, the ground has held Surrey Second XI matches in the [[Second XI Championship]] and the Second XI Trophy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/779_sec.html Second XI Championship Matches played on Cheam Road]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/779_set.html Second XI Trophy Matches played on Cheam Road]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] played a single [[List-A cricket|List-A]] match against [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]] at Cheam Road in the 1969 [[Player's County League]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/779_a.html List-A Matches played on Cheam Road]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In local domestic cricket, Cheam Road is the home ground of [[Sutton Cricket Club]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suttoncricketclub.com/page_332342.html Sutton Cricket Club] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621232200/http://www.suttoncricketclub.com/page_332342.html |date=June 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who play in the [[Surrey Premier League]].  Historically the cricket ground was part of the Lower Cheam House Estate and was donated to the cricket club.  Having gone without a [[cricket pavilion|pavilion]] since 1858, the club bought the old waiting room at [[Sutton railway station (London)|Sutton railway station]] and installed it at the ground.  In 1906 a wooden pavilion was built, but this was destroyed during [[The Blitz]].  A replacement pavilion was constructed in 1955.

'''Daniel S. Frawley Stadium''' is a [[stadium]] in [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. It is primarily used for [[baseball]], and is the home field of the [[Wilmington Blue Rocks]] [[minor league]] baseball team. The park was originally known as Legends Stadium when it was built in 1993. It was renamed in 1994 for Wilmington mayor Daniel S. Frawley, who had pushed for a return of the Blue Rocks. The field is named separately for [[Judy Johnson]], a local [[Negro league baseball]] star.

==History==
The stadium was designed by architect Trish England, head of Design Exchange, who had previously designed dozens of commercial buildings in Delaware. Construction began on November 1, 1992 and was headed by contractor Matthew Minker, a part owner of the team. The {{convert|20|acre|m2|adj=on}} stadium site was once part of a [[Christina River]] shipbuilding operation. In 1986, the {{convert|86|acre|m2|adj=on}} Dravo Shipyard, with several buildings, was bought by Verino Pettinaro, a local contractor, for a little more than $1 million. Mr. Pettinaro sold {{convert|6|acre|m2}} for the stadium to the Delaware Stadium Corporation for $300,000. The Delaware Stadium Corporation, a city and state entity, has owned the stadium since its construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Northeast Notebook: Wilmington, Del.; A 'Colosseum' For Baseball|first=Maureen|last=Milford|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/14/realestate/northeast-notebook-wilmington-del-a-colosseum-for-baseball.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 14, 1993|accessdate=August 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amenities==
[[File:Frawley Stadium Outfield.jpg|thumb|left|A view of left field at Frawley Stadium and the scoreboard.]] The stadium seats 6,404 people. The Blue Rocks have a picnic area in the stadium named the Blue Moose Grill and a gift shop, The Quarry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A-Z Guide|url=http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?sid=t426&amp;ymd=20090207&amp;content_id=506530&amp;vkey=team1|publisher=Minor League Baseball|date=February 7, 2009|accessdate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A formerly abandoned building across the street has been renovated to be similar to [[Camden Yards]]. The facility is administered by the Delaware Stadium Corporation.

==Other uses==
In 1995 and from 1997–2001, stadium hosted the [[America East Conference Baseball Tournament]]. The hosting [[Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens baseball|Delaware Blue Hens]] won the tournament in each year except for 1997.&lt;ref name=tourney&gt;{{cite web|title=Baseball Record Book |url=http://www.americaeast.com/fls/14000/records/base.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=14000 |publisher=America East Conference |accessdate=February 12, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527033410/http://www.americaeast.com/fls/14000/records/base.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=14000 |archivedate=May 27, 2012 |page=12 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the stadium hosted the Delaware Stars, a team in the single-season [[Maryland Fall Baseball]] league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Salisbury|first1=Jim|title=Green To Replace Grace In The Rotation|url=http://articles.philly.com/1998-08-25/sports/25724797_1_tyler-green-phillies-bullpen|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816225306/http://articles.philly.com/1998-08-25/sports/25724797_1_tyler-green-phillies-bullpen|archivedate=August 16, 2016|accessdate=July 1, 2016|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=August 25, 1998|quote=The Phillies will send five minor-league players to the Delaware Stars of the Maryland Fall League...

The [[Delaware Sports Museum and Hall of Fame]] has exhibit space through an entrance on the outside of the stadium. The stadium has also held many concerts, including [[Wilco]], [[the Beach Boys]], the [[Steve Miller Band]], and recently the Round the Bases Tour, which featured [[Counting Crows]], [[Live (band)|Live]], and [[Collective Soul]]. Starting in 2008, the Delaware Indo-American festival was held at the site.

| A position demonstrating how double check is possible without the moved piece giving check, by way of ''[[en passant]]'' capture by White.
}}
The most common form of double check involves one piece moving to deliver check and revealing a [[discovered check]] at the same time from a piece it had been blocking. (Such a check is an inherent part of the type of [[smothered mate]] known as ''Philidor's legacy''.) The only possible replies to a double check are king moves, as both checking pieces cannot be captured or blocked at once. In some cases, the king can capture one checking piece and escape the other in a single move.

In exceptional circumstances, it is possible for the moved piece to not participate in the double check (i.e. to give a "double discovered check", though this name is not actually used). The only way for this to happen in orthodox chess is by way of an ''[[en passant]]'' capture. In the position shown, Black has just played 1...g7–g5. White replies 2.hxg6{{chessAN|e.p.}}++. The result is a double check even though the pawn White moved does not give check (one check is given by the rook, discovered by the capturing pawn's move; the other by the bishop, discovered by the captured pawn's removal). Such a double check is extremely rare in practical play, but is sometimes found in [[chess problem|problems]].

For example, in the position shown, after Black plays 1...d5, White plays 2.exd6e.p. quintuple check (the ''moa'' is a non-leaping knight which first takes a diagonal step, then an orthogonal one). After the ''en passant'' capture, five pieces check the black king: both moas, the rook, the grasshopper and the bishop.

In [[xiangqi]], the Chinese version of chess, triple check and even quadruple check is possible even without using fairy pieces, as in the following examples:

A '''dynamic rope''' is a specially constructed, somewhat elastic [[rope]] used primarily in [[rock climbing]], [[ice climbing]], and [[mountaineering]]. This 'stretch' is what makes it 'dynamic', in contrast to a [[static rope]] that has very low elongation under load. Greater stretch allows a dynamic rope to absorb the energy of a sudden load such as [[fall arrest|from a fall]] more slowly, reducing the peak force and therefore the chance of catastrophic failure. [[Kernmantle rope]]s are the most common type of dynamic rope, and [[nylon]] has replaced all natural materials such as hemp ([[Manila rope]]) since 1945 for durability and strength.

==Rope types ==
Dynamic climbing ropes are classified into three categories: Single ropes, twin ropes, and half ropes (also referred to as 'double ropes').

*Single ropes are designed to be used alone, and are by far the most common, and used for top-roping, [[sport climbing]], and [[trad climbing]]. 
*Twin and half ropes are used for lead climbing, and are designed to be used as a pair - they are not strong enough to be safely used on just a single strand, and they are tested to different standards as a single rope. 
**Twin ropes are used by treating the pair of ropes as a single rope, clipping both ropes through the same carabiner at each piece of [[climbing protection|protection]]. 
**Half ropes are also used as a pair, but only one rope is clipped through each piece of protection- the climber alternates which rope is clipped through each piece. On wandering routes where protection is placed far apart on either side, half ropes can significantly reduce rope drag.

Both twin and half ropes have the advantage of redundancy, as well as allowing a rappel along the full length of the climbing rope (by tying both ropes together), so that climbers can descend from a long multipitch route with fewer [[abseiling|rappels]] than with a single rope. Some ropes are 'triple rated', meeting the standards for all three rope types, so they can be used in each configuration.

== Length and diameters ==
Dynamic ropes used for rock climbing come in a variety of lengths and diameters, with the most common lengths being {{Convert|50|m|ft|1|comma=}}, {{Convert|60|m|ft}}, {{Convert|70|m|ft}}.  Lengths will vary depending on rope maintenance and age, and there are even ropes as long as 80 meters for specialized ascents on routes that would normally require a [[multi-pitch climbing]] attempt due to being only slightly longer than a standard rope length.
 
Rope diameters are generally between 8.3mm and 11.5mm, with the different diameters used for slightly different purposes.  Sport and multi-pitch trad climbers often value thinner ropes because they are lighter, and have less rope drag. Thinner ropes also run more smoothly through [[belay]] devices, especially assisted braking devices or 'tube-style' devices operated in 'guide mode', which can be tedious to pull thicker or stiffer rope through. Lighter, thinner ropes, however, have less strength than a thicker rope and will sustain fewer hard falls. Note that some belay devices are better suited for different rope diameters.  This is particularly relevant with [[Belay device#Assisted braking|assisted braking]] devices, such as the Petzl [[Grigri (climbing)|Grigri]] (which, for example, works best with a 9.4-10.3 mm thick line&lt;ref&gt;https://www.petzl.com/US/en/Sport/Belay-devices--descenders/GRIGRI-2&lt;/ref&gt;) or the Faders SUM.  Users must make sure to read the instructions for the device carefully to ensure safety and recognize any limitations to rope diameter.

== Standards and testing ==
All modern rock climbing dynamic ropes rated by the [[UIAA]]  must meet certain standards and pass testing for Construction, Sheath Slippage, Static Elongation, Impact Force on first fall, and Number of falls held.&lt;ref name="sterling"&gt;Sterling Rope 
Guide to Rope Engineering, Design, and Use [http://www.sterlingrope.com/media/document/techmanual.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The force rating indicates the maximum amount of force the rope can deliver to a falling climber, measured in [[kilonewtons]] (kN), under test conditions designed to simulate a hard fall; typical climbing ropes range from 9kN up to an Arborist's 24kN. The force rating is often misunderstood by climbers, because all other climbing gear is rated by the breaking strength (in kN) of the material. Whereas a higher rating (indicating greater strength) is desired for other gear, for dynamic ropes a lower rating is generally desired, as this indicates it would give a 'soft catch' that is less likely to injure the climber or break or dislodge [[climbing protection|protection]] or anchors.&lt;ref name="Alpine Exposures"&gt;[http://www.alpineexposures.com/pages/faq-climbing-ropes-explained-test-uiaa Alpine Exposures FAQ- Climbing Ropes explained]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most climbing equipment, dynamic ropes do not have a rated tensile breaking strength. Instead, the strength of a rope is tested by the number of standard test falls a rope can sustain before breaking. The test falls use an 80&amp;nbsp;kg weight for single ropes (55&amp;nbsp;kg for half ropes), and a [[fall factor]] of 1.7 (4 meter fall on 2.3 meters of rope). This tests simulates a very hard fall that would rarely occur. When climbing, it is possible to produce a fall factor as high as 2, however, real-world climbing situations include additional shock absorbing elements which are not included in the test standard, such as the body of both the climber and belayer, elasticity of their harnesses and anchor materials, and friction between the rope and the belay device, and any protection pieces.&lt;ref name="sterling" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mammut"&gt;[http://www.mammut.ch/en/ropes_tests_dynamic.html Mammut: Standards for dynamic ropes]&lt;/ref&gt; Single ropes must sustain at least 5 such falls before breaking, and a rope that can sustain more than 9 falls is considered a 'multifall' rope.&lt;ref name="mammut" /&gt; In practice, climbing ropes rarely if ever break due to a fall alone- all documented rope failures involve the rope being cut or damaged, for example by abrasion against a sharp rock edge.&lt;ref name="sterling" /&gt; Ropes are especially vulnerable to being cut while they are weighted with the body of the climber, and moving over a sharp edge (for example if a following climber is resting his weight on the rope, or using the rope for assistance, while swinging or traversing under a roof, while being belayed from above). In general, thicker ropes will be stronger and more durable, and have a higher fall rating.

== Rope care and maintenance ==
Modern ropes are made from [[nylon]] and don't require a great deal of maintenance. Ropes that are frequently used are often inspected for cuts, abrasions, or frayed areas; any cut or fraying that passes into the core of the rope is cause for concern. Ropes can also be washed to clean them of any extensive dirt or grime.

Every fall lessens the amount of impact a rope can later absorb, and hard falls can seriously compromise the strength of a rope, without showing obvious signs of wear. One definition of a 'hard fall' is a long fall (&gt; 10–15 meters) with a [[fall factor]] greater than one. Manufacturers often recommended that ropes be retired if they sustain an extremely hard fall, even if they do not show outward signs of wear.&lt;ref name="sterling" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mammut" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mammut manual"&gt;[http://www.mammut.ch/images/Mammut_Seilfibel_E_web_11129.pdf Mammut Rope Care Manual]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of rails:
* Handrail, a normal handrail on the sides (or the middle) of a stair
* Flatbar, a rail that is not kinked and is on the ground, not on any stairs or ramps&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49284133|title=Skateboarding in action|last=Crossingham|first=John|date=2002|publisher=Crabtree Pub|isbn=9780778701231|location=New York|oclc=49284133}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is also commonly used in freestyle skiing, skiers perform tricks off and onto a rail and also while grinding it. Rails can be all different shapes and sizes, usually ending with a small to medium drop to the landing.

'''Lilleshall Hall''' {{IPAc-en|l|ɪ|l|.|ʃ|ɔː|l}} is a large former [[country house]] and estate in the fields of [[Lilleshall]], [[Shropshire]], [[England]].

It is run by [[Serco]] Leisure Operating Ltd on behalf of [[Sport England]] as one of three [[National Sports Centres]], alongside [[Bisham Abbey]] and [[Plas y Brenin]]. It lies between [[Telford]] and [[Newport, Shropshire|Newport]].

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Lilleshall Abbey west end 01.JPG|thumb|Ruins of the abbey: the west end of the abbey church.]]
[[File:Lilleshall Lodge.jpg|thumb|left|Lodge at Lilleshall Abbey, home of the Leveson family after the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]].]]
[[File:George Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland by Thomas Phillips.jpg|thumb|The 1st Duke of Sutherland, under whom the present Hall was built.]]
The core of the Lilleshall estate, which amounts to {{convert|30000|acre|km2}}, was originally the [[demesne]] of [[Lilleshall Abbey]], an [[Augustinian]] foundation of the 12th century. The ruins of the original Lilleshall Abbey are protected today by [[English Heritage]]. The estate was granted after the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] to [[Duke of Sutherland|James Leveson]], a Wolverhampton wool merchant, in 1539.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=39928 |title=Houses of Augustinian canons: Abbey of Lilleshall |author=A T Gaydon, R B Pugh (Editors), M J Angold, G C Baugh, [[Marjorie M Chibnall]], D C Cox, Revd D T W Price, Margaret Tomlinson, B S Trinder |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |date=1973 |work=A History of the County of Shropshire: Volume 2 |accessdate=12 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His family, including [[Walter Leveson]] and [[Richard Leveson (died 1605)|Vice-Admiral Richard Leveson]], the last of his direct line, lived in a lodge in the grounds, although they were only occasionally resident in Lilleshall, as they had many other houses.&lt;ref name=shrops&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18110|title=Lilleshall: Manor and other estates |author=G C Baugh, C R Elrington (Editors), A P Baggs, D C Cox, Jessie McFall, P A Stamper, A J L Winchester |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |date=1985 |work=A History of the County of Shropshire: Volume 11: Telford |accessdate=12 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The estates passed to [[Richard Leveson]], a distant cousin who was a prominent [[Cavalier|Royalist]] in the [[English Civil War]] and fortified the Abbey, inviting a severe bombardment. As he too failed to produce heirs, Lilleshall then passed to [[Sir William Leveson-Gower, 4th Baronet]], founder of an illustrious political dynasty, who married Lady Jane Granville, daughter of the [[Earl of Bath]].

The first of the family to be ennobled, in 1703, was [[John Leveson-Gower, 1st Baron Gower]]. His son and grandson, [[John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower]], and [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford]], progressed further up the ranks of the [[English peerage]] and it was probably the latter who converted a 17th-century house, in the village of [[Lilleshall]] itself, into a country residence in the late 1750s. The lodge lingered on, in a deteriorating state, until 1818, when it was demolished.&lt;ref name=shrops/&gt;

[[George Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland|George Granville Leveson-Gower]] after his marriage in 1765, considered even the mid-18th century Hall too small but it was not until the 1820s that his wife instructed the architect [[Jeffry Wyatville]] and local builders to commence work on the present Hall. It was constructed beyond the eastern end of the original estate, in the parish of [[Sheriffhales]], although still called Lilleshall Hall. It was completed in 1829, three years before the newly elevated [[Duke of Sutherland]]'s death. The Hall was scheduled in 1984 as a [[Grade II* listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&amp;id=255176 English Heritage; Photograph and architectural description of Hall]&lt;/ref&gt; The former Lilleshall Hall, in the village, was at first retained by the family, probably as a dower house, before being sold in 1930.&lt;ref name=shrops/&gt;

The approach to the estate from the main Wolverhampton to Chester Road is through the "Golden Gates", an exact replica of those adorning [[Buckingham Palace]]. The gardens include many bridges, the original canal, an ornamental garden, a Grecian temple, ponds and the Apple Walk (about half its original pergola length). The {{convert|70|ft|m|sing=on}} high [[obelisk]] was built in 1833 in memory of the 1st Duke of Sutherland and designed by G.E. Hamilton.&lt;ref name=shrops/&gt;

===Herbert Ford===
[[File:Lilleshall Abbey - geograph.org.uk - 108072.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ruins of [[Lilleshall Abbey]]]]
In 1914, a year after [[George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 5th Duke of Sutherland|the 5th Duke]] succeeded to the seat at the age of 25, he decided on the outbreak of the [[First World War]] that it was unwise to have so much of his riches tied up in land and property. He sold the entire estate except the Hall and {{convert|50|acre|m2}} of gardens, with less than {{convert|100|acre|km2}} being purchased by [[Wrekin College]]. He then decided he wanted to live closer to London and sold the remainder of the estate in 1917 to Sir John Lee.(Sir John Leigh). 

Herbert Ford was a local man who acquired his wealth from the industry of the [[Ironbridge Gorge]], added to by his marriage to Alice Perrins of the Lea and Perrins [[Worcestershire sauce|Worcester Sauce]] fame. In 1927 he bought the estate and decided on a business plan based on an "early Stately Home". From 1930 until 1939, the Hall had pleasure gardens for the public, including an amusement park, a narrow gauge railway, tea dances, and children's playgrounds. He added an additional nine holes on the existing nine-hole golf course, designed by the noted golf course architect, [[Harry Colt]], which later became the Lilleshall Hall Golf Club. However, it was not played on for 20 years owing to a rent dispute with farmers that resulted in cattle on the course. He even increased attendance by advertising that the [[Germany|German]] [[airship]] [[Hindenburg (airship)|Hindenburg]] would fly over the estate even when its route was nowhere near; he explained that the lack of an airship was due to bad weather in a self-sent telegram.

===Second World War===
At the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] the pleasure gardens closed, an air raid bunker was built and wooden classrooms erected. This accommodated both [[Cheltenham Ladies' College]] and later [[Barnardo's|Dr Barnardo's]], who used the facilities as an orphanage. The land and gardens were intensively farmed throughout this period.

===After World War II===
Many estates were left in ruin after World War II and Lilleshall was no exception. Repairing them to pre-World War II state was expensive and the social revolution that had occurred meant they were very much more expensive to run. Mr Ford struggled on but in 1949, the '''[[Central Council of Physical Recreation]]''' were seeking a second [[National Recreation Centre]] to serve the North of England to complement [[Bisham Abbey]] in the South.

In 1949, a sale was agreed for £30,000 for the Hall and {{convert|10|acre|m2}}, made possible by a financial gift from the people of [[South Africa]] to [[Clement Attlee]]'s government. Mr Ford then gave another {{convert|10|acre|m2}} on condition he and his family could stay in residence for at least another ten years or until his death.

The sports centre was opened in 1951 by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|HM Queen Elizabeth II]] (then HRH the Princess Elizabeth). Jim Lane, a member of the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] became the first warden. He started a number of cricketing courses and the first Conference of cricket coaches was held there in December 1951. Annual summer schools were held from July until September for the governing bodies of many major sports, including cricket, archery, athletics, fencing, judo, weightlifting, basketball, soccer, netball, and tennis.

In 1974 the centre was handed to the Sports Council by the Central Council of Physical Recreation.

Following the success of the summer schools, sports' governing bodies came to look upon Lilleshall as their own national and regional coaching or squad training centre. In twenty-one years as a National Recreation Centre, the English governing bodies of cricket, Rugby League and Rugby Union, lawn tennis, badminton, hockey, lacrosse, netball, the Professional Golfing Association and Association Football selected Lilleshall for its facilities and convenience for players meeting up from around the country to train:
* The 1966 England team trained for two weeks prior to their success in World Cup of 1966. Sir [[Alf Ramsey]] returned in 1967
* The {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on}} field purchased in 1949 was extended by a further {{convert|10|acre|m2}} and developed as a playing field. HRH [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] opened the Pavilion built with a grant from the South African charitable trust in November 1954
* Originally a gymnasium, movement and dance studio, King George VI Sports Hall was a {{convert|120|ft|m|sing=on}} square multi-purpose hall. Funded by a grant of £56,000 from the King George VI memorial foundation, it opened on 31 October 1955
* Funded by B.A.G.A, a pitted area for gymnastics was added in 1979
* In 1985 the King George Hall and the pitted area became the permanent home for British gymnastics
* In 1986 [[the Football Association]] took over the gymnasium for use as the International Sports Medicine Institute and Rehabilitation Centre
* The UK's first Human Performance Centre opened in 1988
* The Sutherland Hall, with the opening of the National Centre at [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] becoming the principal athletics facility, was converted in 1983 for cricket, archery and indoor bowls
* Ford Hall, originally a stable block and then converted by Henry Hall into a [[ballroom]], is now used for table tennis and martial arts
* Wenlock Hall was opened in 1986, a multi-purpose sports facility, incorporating the William Morgan Development Centre for International Volleyball. The Hall was named after the town of [[Much Wenlock]], where it is believed the idea of the modern day [[Olympic Games]] was conceived and where the [[Wenlock Olympian Society Annual Games|Wenlock Games]] are still held annually to this day
* During the 1950s and early 1960s, a new hall of residence was built. It was refurbished in the 1990s to provide ensuite accommodation
* Five squash courts (two glass backed)

The centre also possesses:
* {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on}} floodlit playing field
* Six-lane flat green bowling green
* Two floodlit water-based artificial grass pitches, one is a hockey pitch with the Olympic surface used in Beijing and London 2012, the other a multi-sports pitch.
* A state of the art outdoor archery range

==The Football Association==
The Football Association's School of Excellence was established at Lilleshall in 1984 and closed in the summer of 1999.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/remembering-lilleshall-footballs-answer-hogwarts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/9944644/Michael-Owen-We-got-all-the-prettiest-girls-because-we-were-England-schoolboys-at-Lilleshall-it-led-to-big-fights.html |title=Michael Owen: We got all the prettiest girls because we were England schoolboys at Lilleshall – it led to big fights |publisher=Telegraph |date= 21 March 2013|accessdate=2013-08-16 |location=London |first=Luke |last=Edwards}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Phil Shaw |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-two-schools-of-thought-over-elite-academy-recent-successes-may-save-football-associations-national-school-phil-shaw-reports-1499650.html |title=Football: Two schools of thought over elite academy: Recent successes may save Football Association's National School.

The '''line in the sand match''' is the unofficial title given to the [[2004 AFL season#Round 11|round 11, 2004]] match between [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) clubs {{AFL Haw}} and {{AFL Ess}}, which was played at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] on Saturday, 5 June 2004.

A number of incidents in the third quarter led to some fights breaking out all over the ground, eventually turning into a five-minute melee involving all players on the ground.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Following the brawl, Essendon kicked fourteen goals to Hawthorn's six to record a 74-point win.

Eighteen players faced charges at the [[AFL Tribunal]] from the match on 8 and 9 June 2004, with record suspensions and fines handed out.

==Background==
Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Hawthorn experienced a golden era, making every Grand Final from 1983 to 1989 and again in 1991, and were victorious on five occasions.

During this time, they came up against the Bombers on three occasions – [[1983 VFL Grand Final|1983]], [[1984 VFL Grand Final|1984]] and [[1985 VFL Grand Final|1985]]. The Hawks comfortably won in 1983 and the Bombers followed up with [[List of Australian Football League premiers#Back-to-back premierships|back-to-back]] wins in 1984 and 1985. Throughout this decade, both clubs were known to play hard, attacking brands of football resulting in lots of biffs, bumps and brawls.

Essendon continued to intimidate opposition clubs in the 1990s and into the early years of the 21st century, resulting in more premiership success in 1993 and 2000, and a dominant era over Hawthorn. Essendon entered the match having won nine of the previous ten meetings between the two clubs, by an average margin of 39 points. They were also heavy favourites to win this match, having a 7–3 win–loss record for the season and were considered a top-four contender, while Hawthorn was bottom of the ladder with only two wins.

==During the match==

===Lead up to the brawl===

Hawthorn players were allegedly directed at half time, by club director [[Dermott Brereton]] who played for the Hawks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to "draw a line in the sand"&lt;ref name="dermie-ref"&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Hinds|title=Heavier blows to come for Hawks, Bombers|date=7 June 2004|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/06/06/1086460175315.html|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|location=Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt; and take a physical stand against the Bombers to make it clear that they would not take the intimidation any longer. Brereton denied the allegation but admitted to advising senior players "to stand up to any Essendon aggression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Lines|date=6 June 2004|title=AFL: I didn't order fight - Brereton|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-95261082.html|publisher=AAP Sports News (Australia)|accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the first two minutes of the third quarter, [[Mark Williams (Australian footballer born 1983)|Mark Williams]] kicked Hawthorn's sixth goal of the match to cut Essendon's lead to 26 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|date=5 June 2004 |title=Saturday Afternoon Football: Hawthorn v Essendon |url=http://bigpondvideo.com/AFL/14937?Quarters=3 |publisher=[[Network 10]] |location=Melbourne |time=1:22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005011914/http://bigpondvideo.com/AFL/14937?Quarters=3 |archivedate= 5 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the centre bounce, several players were on the ground vigorously attempting to gain possession of the ball and clear it for their team. [[Mark Johnson (footballer)|Mark Johnson]] of Essendon attempted to join in at a stoppage but was quickly removed by a number of Hawthorn players. This led to some wrestling and jumper punches amongst the players, with approximately 16 players in the centre square at the time. [[Channel Ten (Australia)|Channel Ten]] commentators said that the spirit was "bubbling over a little".

A free kick was awarded to Hawthorn and the ball was quickly kicked forward. The Hawks were unable to take a mark inside their forward 50 and the ball fell into [[Mark Bolton]]'s hands who was able to clear for the Bombers. He kicked the ball along the southern side of the ground with the aim of reaching [[Jason Winderlich]] who, while attempting to mark close to the ground, copped a very hard knock from Hawthorn's [[Chance Bateman]], possibly a knee or hip connecting with his head. A free kick was awarded to Winderlich who was forced from the ground under the [[blood rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|date=5 June 2004 |title=Saturday Afternoon Football: Hawthorn v Essendon |url=http://bigpondvideo.com/AFL/14937?Quarters=3 |publisher=[[Network 10]] |location=Melbourne |time=2:50 - 3:50 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005011914/http://bigpondvideo.com/AFL/14937?Quarters=3 |archivedate= 5 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The brawl===

A number of brawls broke out on the Great Southern Stand side of the centre square with many players getting involved. Players tackled each other to the ground, threw fist and jumper punches and wrestled with each other with Hawthorn's [[Richie Vandenberg]] and [[Lance Picioane]] particularly active and Essendon's [[Adam McPhee]], Mark Johnson and [[Justin Murphy (Australian rules footballer)|Justin Murphy]] were keen to respond.&lt;ref name="dermie-ref" /&gt; As Winderlich continued off the ground in the arms of trainers he was struck by [[Campbell Brown (footballer)|Campbell Brown]] of Hawthorn, an act which was described by Essendon forward [[Matthew Lloyd]] after the match as "one of the most disgusting things I've seen on a football field". Channel Ten commentators described it as "the 1980s revisited", "unbelievable" and stated "we haven't seen these sort of scenes for a long time in AFL football". Trainers, runners and some senior players were seen restraining and dragging their club's players away from opposition players, while McPhee had to be restrained and given marching orders from Bruce Connor, Essendon's head physiotherapist, to receive attention to a bloodied eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|date=5 June 2004 |title=Saturday Afternoon Football: Hawthorn v Essendon |url=http://bigpondvideo.com/AFL/14937?Quarters=3 |publisher=[[Network 10]] |location=Melbourne |time=5:33 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005011914/http://bigpondvideo.com/AFL/14937?Quarters=3 |archivedate= 5 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the brawl===

A few follow-up scuffles occurred but Essendon regained composure and hit back hard on the scoreboard, kicking nine of the next ten goals to extend the three-quarter time lead to 74 points. A 10-goal final quarter, five to each team, left the margin as it was at three-quarter time, with the Bombers recording a 74-point win.

==Tribunal==
The fallout from the match was significant, with a record 18 players reported on a record 26 charges. Some players were reported by umpires on the field,&lt;ref name="match-reports"&gt;{{cite web

==Aftermath==
Both teams struggled for the remainder of the season. Hawthorn did not win another match until round 19, and finished the season with four wins, narrowly avoiding the [[Wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoon]] to {{AFL Ric}} on percentage. Essendon, meanwhile, won just four more matches for the regular season to qualify for the finals, in eighth place. They defeated fifth-placed {{AFL Mel}} by five points in the first elimination final, but then lost to [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] by ten points the following week.

In the years following this match, the clubs' fortunes reversed sharply. Essendon dropped to 13th the following season, missing out on the finals for the first time since [[1997 AFL season|1997]], and would not make another finals series until 2009, doing so after they defeated Hawthorn by 17 points in the final round of the [[2009 AFL season|2009 season]].&lt;ref name="Haw-v-Ess-2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-08-29/bombers-beat-hawks-to-finals-berth/1409174|title=Bombers beat Hawks to finals berth|publisher=ABC News ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]])|first=Raman|last=Goraya|date=29 August 2009|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It still, however, managed a two-point win over the Hawks early in the 2005 season, courtesy of a controversial goal to [[Dean Solomon]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-04-10/bombers-pip-hawks-in-thriller/1548956|title=Bombers pip Hawks in thriller|publisher=ABC News ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]])|date=10 April 2005|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ess-v-Haw-hate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/news/14-reasons-essendon-hawthorn-hate-each-other/news-story/523f6ef05c6b4d1e17f2930250d84f8f|title=14 reasons Essendon, Hawthorn hate each other|publisher=Fox Sports Australia|first=Daryl|last=Timms|date=24 July 2013|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it marked the Bombers' tenth consecutive victory over the Hawks dating back to 1998.&lt;ref name="Ess-v-Haw-forecast-2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/essendon-v-hawthorn-friday-footy-forecast-20130723-2qgev.html|title=Essendon v Hawthorn: Friday footy forecast|publisher=The Age|first=Will|last=Brodie|date=18 July 2013|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following that, Essendon would not beat Hawthorn again until round seven, 2009, but would beat the Hawks three consecutive times within twelve months, including a resounding 43-point victory in round six, 2010, in which the Hawks copped criticism for a performance described as "embarrassing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/sport/a/7182257/franklin-in-doubt-after-training-injury/|title=Franklin in doubt after training injury|publisher=The West Australian|first=Craig|last=O'Donoghue|date=6 May 2010|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawthorn, meanwhile, gradually started to rise up the ladder under new coach [[Alastair Clarkson]], reaching the semi-finals in 2007 and winning the premiership [[2008 AFL Grand Final|the following year]]; it has subsequently won three more premierships, in succession between 2013 and 2015.

The clubs have maintained a strong rivalry, but only one match has turned particularly violent since: in the final round of the [[2009 AFL season|2009 season]], with the two sides battling for eighth place on the ladder, a brawl was sparked by a remonstration from a head-high shirtfront from Essendon captain [[Matthew Lloyd]] on Hawthorn midfielder [[Brad Sewell]] at the start of the third quarter, which was to be the turning point in the match. Essendon won by 17 points after trailing by 22 points at the time of the Lloyd-Sewell incident.&lt;ref name="Haw-v-Ess-2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ess-v-Haw-hate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ess-v-Haw-forecast-2013"/&gt;

'''MHC Krylya Sovetov''' ({{lang-ru|МХК Крылья Советов}}; lit. ''Moscow Hockey Club Soviet Wings'') was a professional [[ice hockey]] team based in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. The team existed for 2 years after [[PHC Krylya Sovetov]] were expelled from the [[Soviet Wings Sport Palace]] in 2008 and the owner of the arena created a new team. MHC Krylya Sovetov was reunited with PHC Krylya Sovetov in 2010.

==History==

===Controversy===
[[File:MHCsovietwingslogo.png|left]]
In 2008, the owner of the [[Soviet Wings Sport Palace]], the All-Russia Institute of Light Alloys (VILS) ({{lang-ru|Всероссийский институт лёгких сплавов (ВИЛС}}) accused [[Krylya Sovetov Moscow|Krylya Sovetov]] of overdue rent payments. This led to the subsequent eviction of the team. The current team left under president [[Aleksandr Tretiak]]'s lead, but Krylya's hockey school, junior subsidiary teams, and other infrastructure opted to remain under the effective ownership of VILS. In light of this, VILS created a new team MHC Krylya Sovetov.

MHC Krylya Sovetov's main team did not play in the 2009–10 season since the definitive calendar of games for the 2009–10 season of the [[Russian Major League]] only contained [[PHC Krylya Sovetov]] in the Western Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Высшая лига.

According to KHL website [[Alexander Medvedev]] contacted both the administration of PHC Krylya Sovetov and MHC Krylya Sovetov and the two clubs with the help of KHL will be reunited into a single organization once again after the split in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.khl.ru/news/2010/7/23/27719.html |script-title=ru:КХЛ объединяет "Крылья Советов" в одну структуру |date=23 July 2010 |publisher=[[Kontinental Hockey League]] |accessdate=23 July 2010 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reunited team will play their games in Setun, [[Moscow]], where MHC Krylya Sovetov played their games after the 2008 split. The junior team will play in [[Dmitrov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.championat.ru/hockey/news-555395.html |script-title=ru:Объединённые "Крылья" переедут в Сетунь в сентябре |date=27 July 2010 |publisher=Championat.ru |accessdate=27 July 2010 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Tennis Center ({{zh|s=国家网球中心|t=國家網球中心|p=Guójiā Wǎngqiú Zhōngxīn}}),&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.beijing2008.cn/venues/ogt/index.shtml Beijing2008.cn profile.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080809120241/http://en.beijing2008.cn/venues/ogt/index.shtml |date=9 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[tennis]] centre located in the [[Olympic Green]]. It opened on 1 October 2007. [http://miaobaby.com/olympics/olympic-green-tennis-center-is-officially-delivered-on-national-day/] It hosted the [[Tennis at the 2008 Summer Olympics|tennis]] preliminaries and finals of singles and doubles for men and women at the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing 2008 Olympics]] as well as the [[Paralympic]] [[Wheelchair tennis at the 2008 Summer Paralympics|wheelchair tennis]] competitions. In 2009, it became the home of [[China Open (tennis)|China Open]].

==General information==
The Center is located in [[Beijing]], just {{convert|1.7|miles|km|abbr=on}} from the [[Beijing National Stadium]] (a.k.a. The Birds Nest Stadium).

The tennis centre covers an area of {{convert|41.22|acre|m2|abbr=on}} with a floor space of {{convert|285394|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. 
The centre currently has 12 competition hard courts and 35 training courts, including 20 hard courts, 10 indoor hard courts, 2 artificial grass courts, 2 indoor clay courts, and a mini hard court.

The main court, named Diamond Court, has a capacity of 15,000. The Lotus court, Moon court, and Brad Drewett Court all have 12 stands, which represent pedals of lotus flowers, one of the emblems of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. Lotus court has a capacity of 10,000. Moon Court has a capacity of 4,000 and Brad Drewett Court has a capacity of 2,000. The courts have been specially designed for natural air ventilation to reduce the amount of air pollution entering the courts, ensuring optimal health for both athletes and spectators. It also allows the courts to be cooled and with an installation of cooling machines, the courts' temperatures can easily be reduced to five degrees Celsius. Curtains attached to the roofs of the courts also allows them to be cooled in the heat of the sun.

The project embodies the concepts of Green Olympics, Hi-Tech Olympics, and People's Olympics. It integrates design experience of world sport architecture and will be a tennis competition venue of the state of the art design in keeping with international standards.

In 2009 the [[China Open (tennis)|China Open]], which is an '''[[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]]''' [[ATP World Tour 500 series|World Tour 500 series]] event and a '''[[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]]''' [[WTA Premier tournaments|Premiere Mandatory]] tournament, moved its location to this center from its former location, the [[Beijing Tennis Center]].

==Rename==
The National Tennis Center was named as The '''Olympic Green Tennis Center''' or '''Beijing Olympic Green Tennis Court''' ({{zh|s=北京奥林匹克公园网球中心|t=北京奧林匹克公園網球中心|p=Běijīng Àolínpǐkè Gōngyuán Wǎngqiúzhōngxīn}}),&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.beijing2008.cn/venues/ogt/index.shtml Beijing2008.cn profile.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080809120241/http://en.beijing2008.cn/venues/ogt/index.shtml |date=9 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing 2008 Olympics]]. Since it started to host the [[China Open (tennis)|China Open]], the venue was renamed to National Tennis Center in 2009.

==After The Olympics/Paralympics==
After the Beijing Olympic and Paralympic games of 2008, the center remained standing.  It did not host the 2008 [[China Open (tennis)|China Open]] Tennis tournament, despite rumours it would. However, it became the new home of the China Open from 2009 onwards.&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.chinaopen.com.cn/news/2008-12-19/164876.shtml]&lt;/sup&gt;  A new center court, National Tennis Stadium, was completed in 2011. Featuring a retractable roof, this new court possesses a capacity of 15,000 spectators, making it the world's fifth largest tennis stadium by capacity. [[Lincuiqiao Station]] on [[Beijing Subway]] [[Line 8, Beijing Subway|Line 8]] opened in the same year, providing the closest public transport access to the tennis center.

The '''Odyssey Complex''' (currently known as the '''SSE Arena Belfast''' for sponsorship reasons) is a sports and entertainment complex located within the Titanic Quarter in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]].

The complex originated in 1992 and came into fruition in June 1998. It opened in December 2000, with expansions opening in March and May 2001. The complex consists of: a multipurpose arena, science centre and shopping centre. The shopping centre houses a movie theatre and bowling alley, alongside a selection of restaurants.

==History==
[[File:Odyssey Arena logo.png|thumb|left|150px|Arena logo used from 2000–15]]
The Odyssey Centre was 50% funded by a £45m grant from the [[Millennium Commission]] as part of the Landmark Project for Northern Ireland with matched funding from the [[Department of Education (Northern Ireland)|Department of Education Northern Ireland]], the Sheridan Group and the [[Sports Council for Northern Ireland]]. The application to the Millennium Commission was led by the [[Ulster Museum]], who wished to develop a science centre and teamed up with Peter Curistan who wished to develop an [[IMAX]], and then led the development of the Arena with L&amp;R leisure who were the consultants. The name "Odyssey", was to symbolise the 'journey of discovery' that would be the science centre and Michael Montgomery, a young 14 year old at the time came up with the name. The complex adopted the name, and the Science Centre became W5.

The arena opened in 2000, W5 on 31 March 2001 with the Pavilion opening a few months later. The Odyssey is quoted to have cost £120 million on completion. Odyssey was held in Trust by the Odyssey Trust Company with leases to SMG/Sheridan for the Arena, Sheridan for the Pavilion and the National Museums NI for W5. In 2011 Odyssey Trust took over the Arena. In 2011 The Odyssey Pavilion which was owned by The Sheridan Group went into administration, and the building went under control of KPMG temporarily until the energy company [[SSE plc|SSE]] purchased it. It is managed by The Odyssey Trust.

[[File:Dsc 0154-luckey-llcs-conflicted-copy-2014-07-11.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Luckey Climber, 2014]]
W5 stands for "Who, What, Where, When, Why"....all the questions asked in science.  W5 was developed by Dr Sally Montgomery, the Ulster Museum's Project Director (and then founding CEO) with the exhibitions being designed by Hands On Inc, Florida USA and Ontario Science Centre, Canada. W5 has roughly 250 interactive exhibits, along with 6 themed exhibitions, in 3500 sq metres of exhibition space, workshop space and lecture theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://w5online.co.uk/explore|title=Explore W5｜Over 250 Interactive Exhibits｜W5 Belfast|date=2018-07-06|website=W5|language=en-gb|others=W5|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

W5 was a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Museums Northern Ireland until 31 March 2012 when it became a subsidiary of Odyssey Trust.  W5 has won a huge number of awards including Best Visitor Attraction, several times.  In 2013, W5 opened 'Climbit' (pronounced "climb it"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://w5online.co.uk/explore/climbit|title=ClimbIt｜Multi-Storey Climbing Structure｜W5 Belfast|date=2018-07-06|website=W5|language=en-gb|others=W5|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the biggest [[Luckey Climber]] in Europe where small children can climb up twelve metres in total safety.

==Future==
In October 2009, The Odyssey Trust sought planning permission for a £100m extension plan. The plans include 800 residential units, two hotels, a promenade, shops, additional leisure facilities and a [[multi-storey car park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/8295078.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Northern Ireland &amp;#124; £100m Odyssey site revamp planned |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-10-07 |accessdate=2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 29 November 2013, the owners of the Odyssey won planning permission for an extension to include hotels, shops and apartments creating around 1,000 new jobs. Work is due to start immediately, with around 800 people set to work on construction of the scheme – described as the biggest redevelopment in Belfast in years. Odyssey Trust's plan is to build next to the existing Odyssey Arena and Pavilion as part of the restart of the Belfast master plan.

In October 2017, it was announced that Planning Permission had been submitted to transform the Complex in a £10m refurbishment. Plans include a new entrance to the Odyssey Pavilion, upgrade of Public Realm and reconfiguration of existing retail units. Phase two will see improved visitor access and greater use of the central open space.

==Awards==
The Odyssey was short-listed for 'International Large Venue of the Year' (Outside of North America) in the 2005 Pollstar Concert Industry Awards, making it one of the top six major concert venues in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pollstaronline.com/CIC2006/Awards17/awardscategories.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420205127/http://www.pollstaronline.com/CIC2006/Awards17/awardscategories.htm |date=20 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odysseyarena.com/latestnews-archive.asp?newsID=163 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120907002525/http://www.odysseyarena.com/latestnews-archive.asp?newsID=163 |archivedate=7 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
The SSE Arena is located in the Titanic Quarter, just a 10/25minute walk from the City Centre. [[Translink (Northern Ireland)|Translink NI]] Metro service 26, 26A, 26B, 26C, 600A and 600B stop directly outside the Arena and depart from Donegall Square North, just outside the Visit [[Belfast]] Welcome Centre.

The [[Northern Ireland Railways]] [[Titanic Quarter railway station]] is only a 5-minute walk away from the Arena and [[Titanic Belfast]] visitor centre.

'''Riverside International Raceway''' (sometimes known as '''Riverside''', '''RIR''', or '''Riverside Raceway''') was a motorsports [[race track]] and [[Road racing|road course]] in the [[Moreno Valley, California|Moreno Valley]] area, a suburb just east of [[Riverside, California]]. Riverside was a hot, dusty place. It was at times, also a dangerous place, yet it is remembered with affection by drivers and fans alike, as the home of road racing in southern California. It was also considered one of the USA's finest tracks.&lt;ref name="track types-history"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parker |first1=C. |title=One of America's finest tracks |url=http://www.racingcircuits.info/north-america/usa/riverside.html#.W_D4sIFKi02 |website=racingcircuirs.com |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;The track was in operation from September 22, 1957, to July 2, 1989, with the last race, The Budweiser 400,&lt;ref name="last race Riverside"&gt;{{cite web |title=Budweiser 400 88 |url=https://www.racing-reference.info/race/1988_Budweiser_400/W |website=racingreference.com |accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; won by Rusty Wallace,&lt;ref name="R.Wallace Stats"&gt;{{cite web |title=Racing Reference |url=https://www.racing-reference.info/driver/Rusty_Wallace |website=racingreference.com |accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; held in 1988. After that final race, a shortened version of the circuit was kept open for car clubs and special events until 1989.&lt;ref name="rir closing cite"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hansen |first1=B. |title=After the last race |url=http://www.racingcircuits.info/north-america/usa/riverside.html#.W_Bq9oFKi00 |website=racingcircuitsinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
[[File:RiversideInternationalRaceway 1988.jpg|thumb|right|The final NASCAR race at Riverside in 1988]]

In the beginning it was originally called '''The Riverside International Motor Raceway'''. It was built in early 1957 by a company called West Coast Automotive Testing Corp.. The head of West Coast Auto Testing was a man by the name of Rudy Cleye, from Los Angeles, who had previously raced in Europe. However the building of the raceway met with funding difficulties early on and a businessman by the name of John Edgar provided a much needed cash bailout. This action prevented any halt in the track's construction.&lt;ref name="latimes article-rir-history"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Glick |first1=Shav |title=RIR History |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-08-07/sports/sp-405_1_race-track/4 |accessdate=17 November 2018 |publisher=L.A.Times |date=Aug 7, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first weekend of scheduled races in September 1957, a California Sports Car Club event, John Lawrence of Pasadena, California, lost his life.  Lawrence, a former Cal Club member, piloting a 1500 cc Production champion, went off at Turn 5 (later designated Turn 8).  With no crash barrier in place, and no rollbar on the car, Lawrence's MGA went up the sand embankment, then rolled back onto the track.  Though Lawrence survived the incident, and appeared only slightly injured, he died later at the hospital of a brain injury.&lt;ref name="Brain injury cite"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stahler |first1=Tom |title=First death at RIR |url=https://www.drivingline.com/articles/the-legend-of-riverside-raceway/ |website=drivingline.com |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second major event at the track, in November 1957, was a sports car race featuring some of the top drivers of the day, including [[Carroll Shelby]], [[Masten Gregory]] and [[Ken Miles]]. Another driver entered was an inexperienced local youngster named [[Dan Gurney]], who had been offered the opportunity to drive a powerful but ill-handling 4.9-liter Ferrari after better-known drivers such as Shelby and Miles had rejected it. Shelby led early but spun and fell back. Gurney assumed the lead and led for much of the event. Shelby, driving furiously to catch up, finally overtook Gurney late in the race and won. Gurney's performance caught the eye of North American [[Ferrari]] importer [[Luigi Chinetti]], who arranged for Gurney to drive a factory-supported Ferrari at [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] in 1958, effectively launching the Californian's European career.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.racingcircuits.info/north-america/usa/riverside.html#.W_Da2YFKi00&lt;/ref&gt;

Footage exists of classic races like the 1986 [[Los Angeles Times Grand Prix]] in which the [[Chevy Corvette]] of [[Doc Bundy]], attempting a three-wide pass, hit the [[Ford Probe]] of [[Lyn St. James]] and the [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] of [[Chip Robinson]] at Turn 1. St. James' car caught fire and Chip Robinson nearly cartwheeled into the crowd. St. James survived the flames and Robinson escaped uninjured within the track bounds.&lt;ref name="3rd parag. cite"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cider |first1=Frank |title=Riverside International |url=http://oscarbyalpinestars.blogspot.com/2009/12/riverside-international-raceway.html |website=oscarbyalpinestars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The track was known as a relatively dangerous course, with its long, downhill back straightaway and brake-destroying, relatively slow 180-degree Turn 9 at the end. During the 1965 Motor Trend 500 NASCAR race, Indycar great [[A. J. Foyt]] suffered a brake failure at the end of the straight, shot off the road and went end-over-end through the infield at high speed. Crash crews assumed Foyt was dead at the scene, until fellow driver [[Parnelli Jones]] noticed a twitch of movement. Ford factory sports car driver Ken Miles was killed there in a testing accident in August 1966 when his Ford sports car prototype (known as the J-car) became aerodynamically unstable and flew out of control at the end of the back straight. In December 1968, American Formula 5000 champion [http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/database/drivers/lou-sell Dr. Lou Sell] crashed and overturned in Turn 9 on the first lap of the Rex Mays 300 Indianapolis-style race, suffering near-fatal burns. In January 1967, Canadian driver [[Billy Foster]] crashed at Turn 9 during a practice-session just prior to the start of qualifying for the Motor Trend 500 NASCAR race. These accidents and others caused track management to reconfigure Turn 9, giving the turn a dogleg approach and a much wider radius (a water improvement also closed the raceway for a few months).&lt;ref&gt;http://oscarbyalpinestars.blogspot.com/2009/12/riverside-international-raceway.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1964, Riverside also claimed the life of 1962–'63 NASCAR champion [[Joe Weatherly]], who refused to wear a shoulder harness and wore his lap belt loosely. Weatherly died when he lost control entering Turn 6, hitting the steel barrier almost broadside and had his head snapped out the window against the barrier.

Nevertheless, in 1983 Turn 9 was the site of the only fatality in [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] GTP history. In the 1983 Times Grand Prix, [[Rolf Stommelen]]'s Joest-constructed [[Porsche 935]] lost its rear wing at the Dogleg and hit two freeway-type barriers sending it into a horrific roll at Turn 9.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.gtplanet.net/forum/threads/riverside-international-raceway-riverside-california.342098/&lt;/ref&gt;

When the racetrack was proposed in the mid-1950s, Riverside International Motor Raceway (as it was called at the time) was planned to ultimately be {{convert|5.0|mi|km}} long, but the club extension was never constructed and the track's final length (after Turn 9 was adjusted in 1969, engineered by David Berg, to a 10 degree banked sweeper) was {{convert|3.3|mi|km}}.

Of the entire road course races run at RIR, there was one that was run in a counter-clockwise direction, sometime around 1960. In 1966 Dan Gurney tested his first Eagle racing car on a shorter, counter-clockwise version of the track tailored specifically for his car's Indianapolis-specific left-turn oiling system. The test caused Gurney to ask track president Les Richter to hold an Indianapolis-style race there. From 1967 to 1969 the Rex Mays 300 served as the season-ending [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] Indianapolis-car race.&lt;ref name="cite"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=Joe |url=https://cmsracing.com/champion/forums/showthread.php?30510-MNRL-Season-1-Race-6-information-Riverside-Int-(Jan-10th) |website=cmsracing.com |accessdate=24 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ESPN]] taped the June 12, 1988, Budweiser 400 race at RIR and caught racer [[Ruben Garcia (NASCAR driver)|Ruben Garcia]] crashing hard off turn 9 and his car went through two cement barriers before coming to rest near a [[catch fence]] where fans were sitting. He was not injured, though, and neither were the race fans.

After 14 years of NASCAR as a driver and later a car owner, [[Richard Childress]] won his first NASCAR race in 1983, when [[Ricky Rudd]] drove his #3 [[Piedmont Airlines (1948-1989)|Piedmont Airlines]] Chevrolet to victory in the 1983 Budweiser 400k.

From 1981 until 1987, NASCAR's championship race was at Riverside.  The [[United States Automobile Club|USAC]] Championship Trail also held their season ending race from 1967 to 1969.

Riverside was home to track announcer [[Sandy Reed (track announcer)|Sandy Reed]] and (along with former LA Rams player Les Richter) [[Roy Hord Jr.]]

NASCAR Team owners [[Roger Penske]] and [[Rick Hendrick]] drove a select few races at Riverside in their own cars. Penske won a Winston West race in 1963, while In the final race in 1988, Hendrick got out of the car and let [[Elliott Forbes-Robinson]] take over.&lt;ref name="rir closing cite"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hansen |first1=B. |title=After the last race |url=http://www.racingcircuits.info/north-america/usa/riverside.html#.W_Bq9oFKi00 |website=racingcircuitsinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Winston Western 500]] came to be known as the signature event at the track. Initially (1963-1981) this race was held in January as the [[Monster_Energy_NASCAR_Cup_Series#Winston_Cup|Winston Cup Series]] season opener, but beginning in 1982 NASCAR elected to start the season with the [[Daytona 500]]. From 1981-1987 the Winston Western 500 was held in November as the final race of the season.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Western_500&lt;/ref&gt;

Riverside also hosted [[drag racing]] events.  Between 1961 and 1969, the [[Hot Rod Magazine Championship Drag Races]], "one of the most significant drag racing events" of that era, were held at RIR.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Thom.  Untitled item  in ''Hot Rod Magazine'', February 2017, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The championship offered a US$37,000 prize, greater even than a [[National Hot Rod Association]] national event prize at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Four Courses of Riverside==
The track was built to accommodate several different configurations, depending on the type of car and race length. The three options on Riverside Raceway were the long course ({{convert|3.27|mi|km}}), the short course ({{convert|2.5|mi|km}}), and the [[NASCAR]] ({{convert|2.62|mi|km}}) course. The original racetrack had a {{convert|1.1|mi|km|adj=on}} backstretch from 1957 to 1968. When the track was redesigned in 1969, Turn 9 was reconfigured with a wider radius and banked with a dogleg approach added, to reduce strain on the cars' brakes. The fourth track configuration was a [[drag racing]] strip.

Before a racing event at RIR, track crews added [[traffic cone|traffic pylons]] to close off sections of the track. The closed sections were determined by the specific course and cars used during any given race.  

Throughout it's history, various other track configurations were used to adapt the track for events such as off-road and motorcycle events.&lt;ref name="various layouts"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kettle |first1=Tom |title=RIR configurations |url=http://www.racingcircuits.info/north-america/usa/riverside.html#.W_DQMoFKi00 |website=racingcircuits.info |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diagram notes''': The long course had the {{convert|1.1|mi|km|adj=on}} backstretch between turns 8 &amp; 9. This version was used primarily for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' Grand Prix, although the long course was also used for [[American open-wheel car racing|Indy car racing]] in the mid-1980s. When the 1969 version was built, the dogleg was added so as to ease the transition into Turn 9 (the track had seen numerous brake failure-induced accidents approaching Turn 9, and this change was made as a safety measure).&lt;br&gt; In the short course, the track would use turn '''7A''' rather than 8. The "Turn 7-7A" configuration effectively shortened the back straight to just over one-half mile in length.  The NHRA drag strip ran south to north on the backstretch from the runoff to the Bosch Bridge (not shown in diagram), which crossed over the track about halfway between turns 8 &amp; 9. 

&lt;gallery&gt;File:Riverside International Raceway 1980 and 1967.svg|left|Riverside International Raceway with &amp; without dogleg.

File:Riverside International Raceway 1980.svg|right|The drag strip is in light blue and ran north to the Bosch bridge (bridge not shown).&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Movies and television==
Due to its proximity to the Southern California entertainment industry, RIR was a frequent filming location for Hollywood movies, television series and commercials.

Scenes from the television shows ''[[CHiPs]]'', ''[[Simon and Simon]]'', ''[[The Rockford Files]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', and the [[HBO]] program ''[[Super Dave Osborne]]'' were shot on location at RIR. The [[Television film|television movie]] adaptation of ''[[Gemini Man]]'', ''Riding With Death'', featured as an experiment on the television show ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', also contains footage of racing at Riverside.{{cn|date=November 2018}}


RIR was extensively featured in the 1961 telefilm "The Quick and the Dead," an episode of the series [[Route 66 (TV series)|''Route 66'']]. The episode stars [[Martin Milner]] and [[George Maharis]], and guest stars [[Harvey Korman]], [[Regis Toomey]], and [[Betsy Jones-Moreland]]. Milner races a 1960 powder-blue [[Chevrolet Corvette]] in the film.

Film shoots at RIR included scenes from:  ''[[Good Guys Wear Black]]'' (1978) ''[[The Betsy]]'' (1978), ''[[Fireball 500]]'' (1966), ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]'' (1966), ''[[The Killers (1964 film)|The Killers]]'' (1964),  ''[[The Love Bug]]'' (1968), ''[[On the Beach (1959 film)|On the Beach]]'' (1959), ''[[Roadracers (1959 film)|Roadracers]]'' (1959), ''[[Speedway (1968 film)|Speedway]]'' (1968), ''[[Stacey (1973 film)|Stacey]]'' (1973), ''[[Thunder Alley (film)|Thunder Alley]]'' (1967), ''[[Winning]]'' (1969), and ''[[Viva Las Vegas]]'' (1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Rice | first =Jerry | year =2009 | title =Starring Role; Riverside's Location Just Outside Hollywood | periodical =Riverside Magazine | publisher =Fred H.

===Use in gaming===
The track was used in [[Sierra Entertainment]]'s ''[[NASCAR Legends]]'', ''[[NASCAR Heat]]'' and later was converted to ''[[NASCAR 4]]'', ''[[NASCAR Racing 2002 Season]]'', ''[[NASCAR Racing 2003 Season|2003]]'' and ''[[rFactor]]''.

Riverside has also been featured in ''[[Indianapolis 500: Evolution]]'' for the Xbox 360.

==Closure and transformation into a shopping mall==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:RIR1989.jpg|thumb|A shot of RIR in 1989 during the transformation from racetrack to shopping mall, note the new section of pavement for racing to continue]] --&gt;

RIR, headed by former [[Los Angeles Rams]] player [[Les Richter]] sold the property to real estate developer Fritz Duda in 1983.  The irony is that Duda had once been a turn announcer for NASCAR's broadcasting arm [[Motor Racing Network]], and many felt racing would long be a part of the Riverside landscape.  
1988 was the final year of racing for Riverside International Raceway. On June 12, 1988, NASCAR held its final race at RIR&amp;nbsp;– a race won by [[Rusty Wallace]] (a caution flag was out for [[Ruben Garcia (NASCAR driver)|Ruben Garcia]] when he came off Turn 9 and lost control of his car and hit a wall, missing the grandstands). In 1989, the track was modified from turn 7A to the back straight. 
The modified track was called '''Riverside Regional Raceway''' and continued to be used for club events. After [[SCORE International]] held its last race, the track finally closed its gates after 32 years of racing. 

Fritz Duda turned the "House that [[Dan Gurney]] built" into a [[shopping mall]] which opened in 1992. The [[Moreno Valley Mall|Moreno Valley Mall at Towngate]] is on the northern end of the former raceway property and homes now occupy the southern end of what was the old racetrack (where [[Tim Richmond]] and [[Dale Earnhardt]] raced). In a 1994 topographical map, the remains of Riverside's Turn 9 and a wall were still visible.  However, today nothing is left of RIR except for [[memorabilia]] from the racetrack.  The old Administration Building remained until 2005, when it was torn down to make way for a complex of town homes.
 
Numerous streets in the neighborhood to the east of the Moreno Mall are named after racing identities, such as [[Cale Yarborough|Yarborough]] Drive, [[Dan Gurney|Gurney]] Place, [[Mark Donohue|Donohue]] Court, [[John Surtees|Surtees]] Court, [[Geoff Brabham|Brabham]] Street, [[Mario Andretti|Andretti]] Street and [[Roger Penske|Penske]] Street.

When Riverside closed in 1989, it followed in the footsteps of [[Ontario Motor Speedway]] (in nearby [[Ontario, California|Ontario]]), which closed in 1980, and followed by [[Ascot Park (speedway)|Ascot Park]] in [[Gardena, California|Gardena]] in 1991.  In the 1990s, two new circuits opened:  [[Auto Club Speedway]] in nearby [[Fontana, California|Fontana]] in 1997, and [[Toyota Speedway at Irwindale]] (now the [[Irwindale Event Center]]) in 1999 and is in danger of meeting the same fate as Riverside. Both tracks, like Riverside, have been used for filming.

In 2003, the remainder of the old Riverside International Raceway was torn up. The sign that was at [[California State Route 60|California 60]] and Day Street was removed to make way for a [[Lowe's]] warehouse and Turn 9 of the old track is now home to houses.

In 2003, plans were announced to build a {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=on}} road course with a similar design to the famed Riverside layout in [[Merced, California]].  The track would have been known as the [[Riverside Motorsports Park]], but the project was abandoned in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercedsunstar.com/167/story/967136.html=Merced|title=Riverside Motorsports Park CEO says plan for track is dead|date=2009-07-24|author=Reilly, Corinne}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4378">In 1986, '''Ron Shandler''' began publishing the ''Baseball Forecaster'', an annual publication focused on applying [[sabermetrics]] to fantasy baseball, and founder of [http://baseballhq.com Baseball HQ], a website with the same focus.  Shandler has an MBA from Hofstra University.

Shandler is seen as a revolutionary thinker in both sabermetrics and fantasy baseball.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Among his innovations in fantasy baseball are:

*'''[[LIMA Plan]]''' - Which stands for Low Investment Mound Aces, is a draft strategy for traditional 4x4 Rotisserie leagues. LIMA is named after pitcher [[José Lima]], who was exemplified by the strategy. The strategy includes spending a maximum of $60 out of your $260 budget on pitching. No more than $30 on saves. Have your pitchers use as few innings as your league rules allow. Look to buy pitchers with strong strikeout-to-walk ratios, high strikeout per inning ratios and low home run per inning ratios. Spend the rest of your budget on hitting.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
* '''Strand Rate''' - The percentage of baserunners a pitcher allows who fail to score (''[[Baseball Prospectus]]'' has a similar statistic, [http://www.baseballprospectus.com/glossary/index.php?mode=viewstat&amp;stat=231 Bequeathed Runs Prevented]). Shandler discovered that 72 percent of baserunners on average never cross the plate, so if a pitcher has a higher or lower strand rate there's a chance it will affect his ERA in the opposite direction in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Sam | last=Walker | coauthors= | title=Fantasyland | year=2006 | publisher=Viking | url =http://www.fantasyland.com | work = | pages =54 | accessdate = 2007-07-17 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of runners being stranded on base was probably not first conceived of by Shandler. Sabermetrician [[Keith Woolner]] has been researching support-neutral statistics since at least [http://www.baseballprospectus.com/statistics/snwl/snwlart/ 1993], and has often discussed concepts similar to Strand Rate (e.g., Bequeathed Runners inherited/stranded).[http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=3032] [http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=2705]

Shandler created [[Tout Wars]] in 1997 after being fed up with the lack of promotion ''[[USA Today]]'' gave its annual [[LABR]] fantasy baseball experts league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Sam | last=Walker | coauthors= | title=Fantasyland | year=2006 | publisher=Viking | url =http://www.fantasyland.com | work = | pages =145 | accessdate = 2007-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also founded the Annual Fantasy Baseball Symposium at the Arizona Fall League, one of the largest gatherings of fantasy baseball players, now in its 16th year.

Shandler's success as a fantasy player includes the most wins in major fantasy baseball expert leagues.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} He won both the NL and AL Tout Wars competitions in 1998 (being the only time anyone has ever won dual championships in the history of national experts competitions), AL Tout Wars in 2000, NL LABR in 2001, and the Fantasy Sports Trade Association League in 2010. He has contributed columns to the sports section of the Huffington Post, ESPN Magazine, ESPN.com, and USA Today.  In 2004, he was selected to help form an advisory board for the St. Louis Cardinals, which he served on for approximately two years.

In 2004, Shandler received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Fantasy Sports Trade Association.  In 2012, he was inducted into the Fantasy Sports Writers Association's Hall of Fame.

On April 30, 2013, Shandler announced he would be stepping down from running Baseball HQ, which he had sold to USA Today five years prior. He will continue to write his weekly columns for BaseballHQ.com and USA Today, contribute to the ''Baseball Forecaster'' and will remain active in the fantasy baseball community.

He now runs his own site, RonShandler.com [http://ronshandler.com] where he promotes his latest innovation: the Broad Assessment Balance Sheet (BABS) approach to fantasy baseball team construction.

The '''South African rebel tours''' were a series of seven [[cricket]] tours staged between 1982 and 1990. They were known as the rebel tours because the international cricketing bodies [[Sporting boycott of South Africa|banned South Africa]] throughout this period because of [[apartheid]]. As such the tours were organised and conducted in spite of the express disapproval of national cricket boards and governments, the [[International Cricket Council|International Cricket Conference]] and international organisations such as the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Pg 35-71, Peter May, ''The Rebel Tours: Cricket's Crisis of Conscience'', 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The tours were the subject of enormous contemporaneous controversy and remain a sensitive topic throughout the cricket-playing world.

== Origins ==
Until the [[D'Oliveira affair]] in 1968 and Olympic exclusion in 1964, only white athletes had been allowed to represent South Africa in international sport. This position reflected the apartheid society in South Africa (1948 onwards) and racist social conventions pre-dating apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;Pg 10-54, Douglas Booth, ''The Race Game: Sport and Politics in South Africa'', 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971 an [[International cricket in South Africa from 1971 to 1981|international sports boycott]] was instituted against South Africa to voice global disapproval of their racist selection policies and apartheid in general. South Africa became world sport's pariah, excluded from the [[Olympics]], the [[FIFA World Cup]], [[Test cricket]] and a host of minority sports.&lt;ref&gt;Pg 99, Booth, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The boycott effected measurable change on policy and opinion in sports selection – and cricket in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historicalvoices.org/pbuilder/pbfiles/Project39/Scheme361/african_activist_archive-a0a9z9-a_12419.pdf |title=Apartheid Sport and South Africa's Foreign Policy |format=PDF |publisher=historicalvoices.org |accessdate=2011-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927111150/http://www.historicalvoices.org/pbuilder/pbfiles/Project39/Scheme361/african_activist_archive-a0a9z9-a_12419.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 the South African Cricket Union (SACU) was created to administer the game in the republic on a multi-racial, meritocratic basis: so-called "normal" cricket.&lt;ref&gt;Pg 223-5, [[André Odendaal]], ''The African Game'', 2003&lt;/ref&gt; However this was insufficient to ensure South Africa's re-admission to international cricket. Inside the republic, many non-whites resented "normal" cricket, which was a feeble concession in the wider context of life under apartheid, and declined to take part.&lt;ref&gt;Pg 225, Odendaal, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the Republic, the ICC bloc of India, Pakistan and the West Indies refused to countenance re-admission until apartheid itself was dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;Pg 54, May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

After a decade's isolation, cricket in the Republic was weak. Standards, attendances and child participation were all falling. Overseas the game had been revolutionised by the [[Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] and [[World Series Cricket]] but isolation had deprived South Africa of these commercial and competitive engines. Then in 1979 [[Doug Insole]], an English representative on the [[International Cricket Council|ICC]], told SACU's [[Ali Bacher]]: "Until apartheid goes, you can forget about getting back into world cricket."&lt;ref&gt;Pg 175, Rodney Hartman, ''Ali: The Life of Ali Bacher'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacher and SACU felt obliged to act to "keep the game alive in South Africa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/wisdencricketer/content/story/139086.html |title=Rebels take a step too far |publisher=Cricinfo.com |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since players were endangering their careers by breaking the boycott, SACU had to offer substantial sums to entice their targets. These rebels would play "unofficial" internationals against a Springbok team who considered themselves as strong as any team in world cricket except the [[West Indies Cricket Team|West Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://therebeltours.wordpress.com/2009/11/05/the-conquerors-the-greatest-ever/ |title=The Conquerors: The greatest ever?|publisher=wordpress.com |date= 3 November 2009 |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=October 2011}} In the earliest rebel tours, [[Mike Procter]] and [[Peter Kirsten]] captained home teams featuring [[Barry Richards]], [[Graeme Pollock]], [[Clive Rice]] and [[Garth Le Roux]]. By their conclusion in 1990 many had retired and were replaced by the likes of [[Hansie Cronje]] and [[Allan Donald]].&lt;ref&gt;May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The boycott movement opposed any such tours. They felt that engagement lent credibility and a [[propaganda]] coup to the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]]. But SACU insisted that all funding came directly from commercial sponsorship and that the tours would be conducted independently of government. Initially, at least, overseas opponents could not prove otherwise while inside South Africa, non-white opposition, as under apartheid more generally, was barely heard due to restrictions on freedoms of [[freedom of the press|press]], [[freedom of speech|speech]] and [[freedom of assembly|assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Pg 55, May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== English XI, 1981–82 ==

The first major tour was by an English team led by [[Graham Gooch]] in March 1982. Twelve cricketers, 11 of them with Test caps, had agreed in secret to make a one-month tour of the republic. The news only broke when they arrived in Johannesburg. The players expected a brief public outcry and ICC slap on the wrist. Instead they were the subject of global outrage among press and politicians, and labelled "the Dirty Dozen" in the [[Houses of Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;Pg 71-108, May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction in South Africa could not have been more different. The government and white newspapers hailed the return of official international cricket. Apart from [[Ian Botham]], it was said, this was the full-strength England team.&lt;ref&gt;Pg 39, Mike Procter with Pat Murphy, ''South Africa: The Years of Isolation'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Springbok colours were awarded to the home side in a series of three "Tests". There were also three "one-day internationals".

The on-field action "made a mockery of the immense off-field publicity".&lt;ref&gt;Peter May and Tristan Holme, SPIN Magazine, November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called [[South African Breweries]] XI were under-prepared and, with the exception of Gooch and Emburey, either past their best or fairly marginal members of the England side (in fact, Taylor and later call-ups Humpage and Sidebottom had not played a Test for England at the time, and Humpage never did play a Test at all.) They were beaten by a South Africa team for whom the uncapped [[Jimmy Cook]] and [[Vintcent van der Bijl]] starred. The Springboks, captained by Mike Procter, won the "Test" series 1-0 and "ODI" series 3-0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/1980S/1981-82/OTHERS+ICC/ENG-XI_IN_RSA/ |title=Rebel England XI in South Africa 1980–1981 |publisher=Cricinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebels, who numbered 15 after hiring three further players to cover injuries, all received three-year bans from international cricket. These suspensions ended the careers of more than half the squad including [[Geoffrey Boycott]], the world's leading Test run-scorer at that time. Lever (1), Sidebottom (1), Taylor (2), Willey (6) and Larkins (7) each played a few more Tests, but only Gooch and Emburey had extensive Test careers afterwards (and indeed, both were later to captain England - Emburey for two tests in 1988 against the West Indies, having been a fixture in the side since his return in 1985: Gooch for the final test of that series, then later as the regular captain from the 1989-90 tour of the West Indies to the 1993 Ashes series, remaining as a player for two further years after that). Emburey, in fact, went on England's second rebel tour in 1989, served another three-year ban for it, and was selected again for some matches between 1992 and 1995, though no longer as a regular fixture in the side.&lt;ref&gt;Pg 98, May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

*Squad: [[Graham Gooch]] (captain), [[Dennis Amiss]], [[Geoffrey Boycott]], [[John Emburey]], [[Mike Hendrick]], [[Geoff Humpage]], [[Alan Knott]], [[Wayne Larkins]], [[John Lever]], [[Chris Old]], [[Arnold Sidebottom]], [[Les Taylor (cricketer)|Les Taylor]], [[Derek Underwood]], [[Peter Willey]], [[Bob Woolmer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://therebeltours.wordpress.com/2009/10/09/1981-2-english-xi/ |title= The Rebel Tours |publisher= [[WordPress.com]] |date=9 October 2009 |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/434386.html |title= The Dirty Dozen |publisher= [[ESPN Cricinfo]] |date=14 November 2009 |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Graham Dilley]] had pulled out of the tour before it got underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/535446.html |title=Rob Steen on Graham Dilley  |publisher=ESPN Cricinfo |date= |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arosa Sri Lanka, 1982–83 ==

[[Sri Lankan cricket team|Sri Lanka]] was a fledgling Test nation in 1982, playing their inaugural match against England at [[Colombo]] in February of that year. [[Bandula Warnapura]]’s side were beaten by seven wickets against an experienced visiting team and would fail to win four further Tests as the year progressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/team/8.html?class=1;spanmax1=14+Oct+1982;spanval1=span;template=results;type=team;view=results |title=Sri Lanka’s Test record 1982 |publisher=cricinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then in October it was announced that Warnapura was leading a 14-man rebel squad to South Africa. The team would be called Arosa Sri Lanka after the initials of their player manager [[Tony Opatha|Anthony Ralph Opatha]] and the host nation. The players were vehemently denounced across [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and the [[Caribbean]] as well as in their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.cricinfo.com/db/INTERACTIVE/DILMAH/GREATS/MEMORY/srilanka_rebeltour.html |title=Dilmah Cricket Network ‘Rewind to Sri Lanka’s rebel tour’ |publisher=cricinfo.com |date=24 February 2005  |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the second successive tour, white South Africa was forced to put on a brave front in acclaiming sporting triumph where there was none. A full-strength Sri Lankan team was some way off international competitiveness so it was little surprise that a makeshift rebel outfit was utterly humiliated, failing to win a single tour match. Now captained by [[Peter Kirsten]] of [[Western Province Cricket|Western Province]], South Africa comfortably won all four ‘ODIs’ and both ‘Tests’. [[Lawrence Seeff]], who replaced the injured [[Barry Richards]], and [[Graeme Pollock]] made 188 and 197 respectively in the second ‘Test’ but protested that the matches could not be classed as international cricket. SACU, trying to protect the ‘unofficial international’ brand it had created, fined them for the admission.&lt;ref&gt;pg 131 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Life became very difficult for the Sri Lankans who were ostracized at home for a decision many called treasonous. All players received a lifetime ban from the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka. None played international cricket for the island again, although Aponso represented the Netherlands in the 1996 World Cup at the age of 43.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/19970822/23450553.html |title=‘Rebel with a grouse’, |publisher=Indian Express |date=22 August 1997 |accessdate=2011-10-25 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Squad: [[Bandula Warnapura]] (captain), [[Flavian Aponso]], [[Hemantha Devapriya]], [[Lantra Fernando]], [[Mahes Goonatilleke]], Nirmal Hettiaratchi, [[Lalith Kaluperuma]], Susantha Karunaratne, [[Bernard Perera]], [[Anura Ranasinghe]], [[Ajit de Silva]], Bandula de Silva, Jeryl Woutersz, [[Tony Opatha]] (player/manager).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://therebeltours.wordpress.com/2009/10/10/1982-3-arosa-sri-lanka/ |title=The Rebel Tours|publisher=wordpress.com |date=10 October 2009 |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=October 2011}}

== West Indian tours, 1982–83 and 1983–84 ==
{{see also|Fire in Babylon}}
The West Indian players were mainly talented understudies struggling to break into the great [[West Indies cricket team|West Indian]] Test team of the period, or men past their prime as Test players. First-class cricketers in the West Indies were then poorly paid and the participants, many of whom had irregular or no employment in the off-season, received between US$100,000 and $120,000 for the two tours. West Indies cricket was so strong that [[Clive Lloyd]] had little need for the likes of [[Lawrence Rowe]], [[Collis King]] and [[Sylvester Clarke]]. Rowe has since stated that he and several other players were disillusioned with the West Indies Cricket board for not selecting them despite good performances &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mcdonald |first=Michelle |url=http://caribbeancricket.com/news/0000/00/00/1420 |title="Yagga" Rowe tackles apartheid, part 3 |publisher=Caribbeancricket.com |date=12 April 2011 |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strength of Caribbean cricket was evidenced in the ‘international’ matches, where South Africa received their first real test. A fiercely contested four-week series in 1982-3 took ‘unofficial internationals’ to new heights, the Springboks winning the one-day series 4-2 while the ‘Test’ series was drawn 1-1. The dominant theme of the match-ups was West Indian fast bowling. [[Colin Croft]] was one of four World Cup winners in the party. Their pace battery, featuring Clarke, Croft, [[Bernard Julien]] and [[Ezra Moseley]], terrified Springbok batsmen who were forced to wear helmets for the first time.

The frantic first series, again organised in secret and conducted on the hoof, set up a fierce battle when the West Indians returned for a full tour the following season. Clarke was by now the dominant player on either side, claiming four five-wicket hauls in the 2-1 ‘Test’ series win. The West Indian XI also won the one-day series 4-2, helped slightly by the Springboks weakening: Barry Richards and Vince van der Bijl retired in 1983, and Mike Procter, 36, played only a single ‘one-day’ international over both tours.&lt;ref&gt;Pg 138-98, May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Fotheringham]], [[Ken McEwan]], [[Rupert Hanley]], [[Dave Richardson (cricketer)|Dave Richardson]] and [[Mandy Yachad]] made their debuts for South Africa. [[Clive Rice]] was handed the captaincy for the 3rd and 4th "Tests" after the sacking of [[Peter Kirsten]] for the ‘ODI’ series defeat. Kirsten maintained his place in the team and top scored in the next match. [[Graham Gooch]] played against the West Indies team during both tours as a member of a South African provincial side.

The improvement in the on-field action was in strict contrast to the off-field environment. South Africa stood permanently on the brink of civil war as PW Botha’s brutal government repressed the black majority and excluded them from a new ‘multi-racial’ parliament. This oppression was met with violent reprisals while the rebels were controversial figures in the townships that had worshipped West Indian cricketers only to see them collaborating with the apartheid enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Sky Sports, ''Out of the Wilderness Part 2'', August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The participants received a life ban from Caribbean cricket in 1983. In many instances, they were ostracised socially and professionally, such was the hostility toward players that complied with the South African apartheid system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sam Coates and Charles Bremner 25 October 2011 3:43PM |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/mike_atherton/article5662856.ece |title=Michael Atherton, ‘Richard Austin: the fallen West Indies star’, '&amp;#39;The Times'&amp;#39;, 5 February 2009 |publisher= The Times |date=21 October 2011 |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21552339-11088,00.html |title=Robert Craddock, ‘Rebels still live in shame, despair |publisher=The Herald Sun |date=14 April 2007 |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pg 120, Michael Holding and Tony Cozier, ''Whispering Death: The Life and Times of Michael Holding'', 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the players commented on a warm reception from both blacks and whites in South Africa and the tour may have been a positive influence on relations between races. It was one of the few occasions when white and black people had played sport together in South Africa. The players' bans were lifted in 1989 (although Lynch appeared in ODI's for England a year earlier against the touring West Indians) but the only tour member who played for West Indies again was Moseley, at the age of 32 (two tests in the 1989-90 home series against England: though he did not take many wickets, his appearance was chiefly notable for breaking Graham Gooch's hand, forcing Gooch - now England's captain - to miss the remainder of the series). Stephenson and Clarke had very successful first-class careers in South African and English domestic cricket: and Stephenson in particular could perhaps be thought unlucky not to be given a chance in Test cricket, given the precedent set by Moseley's selection and the fact that his performances in the English county championship had been nothing short of spectacular.

A fierce battle raged – and continues to rage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/286356.html |title= The unforgiven |publisher= cricinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; – over the wisdom of the West Indian tours. Were the rebels, as they themselves insisted, showing white South Africa that black men were their equals as the republic stumbled towards democracy? Or, as their detractors still maintain, had they sold themselves and their dignity to extend the life of a disgraced and barbarous government?

== Australian tours, 1985–86 and 1986–87 ==

The tours by the [[Australia]]ns were led by former Test captain [[Kim Hughes]], with South Africa winning both "Test" series 1&amp;ndash;0. The squad included several players who represented Australia at Test level, such as fast bowlers [[Terry Alderman]], [[Rodney Hogg]] and [[Carl Rackemann]], spinners [[Trevor Hohns]] and [[Tom Hogan]] opening batsman [[John Dyson (cricketer)|John Dyson]] and [[Steve Smith (cricketer born 1961)|Steve Smith]], weakening the official Australian Test side by depriving it of several of its best players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1980S/1985-86/OTHERS+ICC/AUS-XI_IN_RSA/AUS-XI_IN_RSA_NOV1985-JAN1986_TOUR-STATS.html Cricinfo.com: Australian XI in South Africa 1985&amp;ndash;86 tour statistics.] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour prompted Australian prime minister [[Bob Hawke]] to call the group "traitors" and in retrospect has been called "one of the most painful and traumatic moments in Australian cricket history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=  http://www.theage.com.au/news/cricket/rebels--the-85-south-africa-tour/2005/12/09/1134086816276.html |title= Rebels&amp;mdash;the '85 South Africa tour |date= 10 December 2005 |publisher= [[The Age]] |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes accused the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Cricket Board]] of fostering dissatisfaction among the players, making recruitment for the rebel tours easy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/266824.html |title=The crying game |publisher= cricinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes did return to [[Sheffield Shield]] cricket in 1988 but never played international cricket again and later returned to South Africa to play for [[KwaZulu-Natal cricket team|Natal]]. However, Alderman, Hohns and Rackemann returned to represent Australia in later series, starting in 1989 (Alderman becoming a regular fixture in the side, Hohns and Rackemann as bit-part players). Wessels - a South African by birth, who had been playing for Australia only because of the international ban on South African sport - returned to his native country, playing and captaining for South Africa on their readmission to Test cricket, and later became the first (and so far only) person to score official Test centuries for two nations.

On [[Australian cricket team in South Africa in 1985–86|the first Australian tour, 1985–86]], fast bowlers [[Hugh Page]] and [[Corrie van Zyl]] made their debuts for South Africa. During [[Australian cricket team in South Africa in 1986–87|the second tour in 1986–87]], batsman [[Brian Whitfield]] and spinner [[Omar Henry (cricketer)|Omar Henry]] who became the second non-white player to represent South Africa, and two future stars, all-rounder [[Brian McMillan]] and fast bowler [[Allan Donald]] made their South African debuts. [[Kepler Wessels]] played for the Australian team on their second tour.

South Africa won both ‘Test’ series 1-0, both ‘ODI’ series and a ‘day-night’ series. Yet the on-field action could never escape the shadow of apartheid. Newspaper revelations in January 1986&lt;ref&gt;'Taxpayers hit for six!', Business Day, 20 January 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; revealed what non-white leaders in South Africa and anti-apartheid campaigners worldwide had been claiming for years: the tours were not funded by business, as Ali Bacher and SACU had always insisted, but by the apartheid government through enormous tax breaks.&lt;ref&gt;Pg 221-3, May 2009; pg 184-5, Hartman, 2004; Pg 147, Booth, 1998; Pg 133-4, Mihir Bose, Sporting Colours, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

== English XI, 1989–90 ==

In 1990, the final tour was led by former England captain [[Mike Gatting]]. The team included former and contemporary England players such as batsmen [[Tim Robinson (cricketer)|Tim Robinson]], [[Bill Athey]] and [[Chris Broad]], wicketkeeper [[Bruce French (cricketer)|Bruce French]], and the fast bowlers [[Paul Jarvis]], [[Graham Dilley]] and [[Neil Foster]].

[[Kepler Wessels]] returned to represent the land of his birth. [[Roy Pienaar]], [[Dave Rundle]] and [[Richard Snell (cricketer)|Richard Snell]] made their debuts for South Africa. [[Jimmy Cook]] was appointed as South African captain and [[Allan Donald]] took 8 wickets for 59 in the match. South Africa went on to win the only 'Test'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/1980S/1989-90/OTHERS+ICC/ENG-XI_IN_RSA/ENG-XI_RSA_REBEL-T_08-10FEB1990.html |title=Scorecard |publisher=Cricinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; England lost the limited overs series 3&amp;ndash;1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/1980S/1989-90/OTHERS+ICC/ENG-XI_IN_RSA/ |title=England XI in South Africa 1989–90 |publisher=Cricinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Most of the squad did not play for England again. Gatting served a three-year ban from Test cricket before his recall to the England side for the tour of [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]] in 1992&amp;ndash;93, along with [[John Emburey]] and [[Paul Jarvis]]. Emburey made both rebel tours and served two suspensions. Foster subsequently played a solitary Test, against Australia at Lord's in 1993, as did Alan Wells (against the West Indies in 1995). Matthew Maynard played three more tests, two in the 1993 Ashes and one in the following tour of the West Indies.

The squad for the rebel tour was announced during the fourth Test of the [[1989 Ashes series]] in England. Players in the squad were not considered for the rest of the series, which allowed future long-term England players, batsman [[Michael Atherton]] and fast bowler [[Devon Malcolm]], an opportunity to make their England debuts.

The tour was a financial disaster as it coincided with the "unbanning" of the [[African National Congress]] and the release from prison of [[Nelson Mandela]]. As South Africa began the dismantling of apartheid, [[Ali Bacher]] was surprised at the scale of the mass demonstrations against the tour as previous rebel tours had passed smoothly in the country.&lt;ref&gt;cricinfo.com{{Nonspecific|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second tour scheduled for 1990-91 was cancelled.

*Squad: [[Mike Gatting]] (captain), [[Bill Athey]], [[Kim Barnett]], [[Chris Broad]], [[Chris Cowdrey]], [[Graham Dilley]], [[Richard Ellison (cricketer)|Richard Ellison]], [[John Emburey]], [[Neil Foster]], [[Bruce French (cricketer)|Bruce French]], [[Paul Jarvis]], [[Matthew Maynard]], [[Tim Robinson (cricketer)|Tim Robinson]], [[Greg Thomas]], [[Alan Wells]], [[David Graveney]] (player/manager).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://therebeltours.wordpress.com/2009/10/14/1989-90-english-xi/ |title= The Rebel Tours |publisher= wordpress.com | date=14 October 2009 |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=October 2011}}

== South Africa returns to international cricket ==

Thirty-one players were selected to play for South Africa in the 19 Rebel "Tests". [[Vintcent van der Bijl]], [[Rupert Hanley]], [[Denys Hobson]], [[Kevin McKenzie (cricketer)|Kevin McKenzie]], [[Alan Kourie]], [[Brian Whitfield]], [[Kenny Watson]], [[Roy Pienaar]], [[Hugh Page]], [[Ray Jennings]], [[Henry Fotheringham]], [[Lawrence Seeff]], [[Stephen Jefferies]], [[Ken McEwan]] and [[Garth Le Roux]] all retired or were beyond their prime before official international cricket resumed for South Africa. Before isolation, [[Graeme Pollock]] (23 Tests), [[Mike Procter]] (7 Tests) and [[Barry Richards]] (4 Tests) had played official Test cricket.

South Africa resumed official international cricket in 1991 with a [[South African cricket team in India in 1991–92|short tour of India]], and participation in the [[1992 Cricket World Cup]] in Australia and New Zealand. [[Clive Rice]] (3), [[Corrie van Zyl]] (2), [[Dave Rundle]] (2) and [[Mandy Yachad]] (1), only played in official ODIs for South Africa. Being in the twilight of their careers, [[Jimmy Cook]] played 3 Tests and 6 ODIs, [[Peter Kirsten]] 12 Tests and 40 ODIs, [[Adrian Kuiper]] 1 Test and 25 ODIs and [[Omar Henry (cricketer)|Omar Henry]] 3 Tests and 3 ODIs. [[Allan Donald]], 72 Tests and 164 ODIs, [[Brian McMillan]] 38 Tests and 78 ODIs and [[Dave Richardson (cricketer)|Dave Richardson]] 42 Tests and 122 ODIs, became the backbone of the new Protea outfit, and to a lesser extent, [[Richard Snell (cricketer)|Richard Snell]] who played in 5 Tests and 42 ODIs. [[Kepler Wessels]] became captain of the team and played in 16 Tests and 55 ODIs for South Africa. During the years of isolation, Wessels played for Australia in 24 Tests and 54 ODIs.

All of the matches played during the rebel tours were granted first-class status, which was subsequently withdrawn by the [[International Cricket Council]] in 1993. {{As of|August 2007}}, the ICC is reviewing the status of all matches played in South Africa between 1961 and 1991, including those played during the rebel tours, with a view to restoring first-class status to some matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/current/story/308994.html |title= Rebel tours to South Africa may get ICC recognition |publisher= cricinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Unión Santafesina de Rugby''' (Rugby Union of Santa Fe) is the governing body for [[rugby union]] in [[Santa Fe Province]] in [[Argentina]].

Best placed teams of USR qualify to play the [[Torneo del Litoral]], along with clubs from [[Unión de Rugby de Rosario|Rosario]] and [[Unión Entrerriana de Rugby|Entre Ríos]] unions.

==History==
In 1949 the Unión de Rugby del Río Paraná was founded. Its role was to represent and organise competitions for clubs from both [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] and [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]] provinces.

Due to different point of views the URRP was split in two soon after. Clubs from Entre Ríos would go on to form the [[Unión Entrerriana de Rugby]] and clubs from Santa Fe the "Unión Santafesina de Rugby".

==Role==
USR is one of the [[Argentine Rugby Union]]'s 25 regional governing bodies. The union runs rugby competitions in the province of Santa Fe with the exception of [[Rosario]] clubs, who are part of the [[Unión de Rugby de Rosario]].

The Union Santafesina also runs the Santa Fe team that represents the province in the [[Campeonato Argentino]].

Along with clubs from Entre Ríos and Rosario, Santa Fe senior clubs compete in the [[Torneo del Litoral]]. A Santa Fe championship also exists for the clubs at underage levels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2253">The '''vaseline incident''' was one of the first publicised '[[Ball tampering|doctoring]]' (using unfair means to enhance the swing or seam abilities) of the [[cricket ball]] by a [[Bowling (cricket)|bowler]], when it was alleged [[John Lever]] rubbed [[Vaseline]] onto one side of the ball so it would swing better.

== History==
The incident occurred in the third test in [[Chennai]] (on 14-19 January 1977), with [[India national cricket team|India]] 2-0 down in the series after heavy defeats in [[Delhi]] and [[Kolkata]]. Ball tampering regulations allow the application of sweat and saliva (naturally produced substances) to the cricket ball in an attempt to shine one side. Other means of altering the ball's condition, such as applying Vaseline, were banned.

Lever, and his bowling partner [[Bob Willis]], both found themselves suffering from sweat falling into their eyes. It was suggested, naively, by the team physiotherapist that they apply strips of gauze covered with Vaseline above their eyes to divert sweat from their forehead away. In play these were found to slip, and Willis removed his. Eventually Lever also removed his and lay the gauze on the ground near the stumps where it was noticed by the umpires and Indian team, but not before he had used sweat from his forehead to shine the ball. 

[[Bishen Singh Bedi]], the under pressure captain of the Indian cricket team, was not convinced the Vaseline was to keep sweat out of the eyes. He said Lever had used unfair means to shine the ball. The English paceman’s habit of rubbing the ball over his eyebrows every now and then was also noticed. Tests on the cricket ball revealed presence of greasy substance. Whether the Vaseline had been intentionally applied to the ball or not was later disputed, and Lever's previous performances on the tour questioned.

'''Wireball''' is a [[street game]] related to [[baseball]], usually formed as a pick-up [[game]], in  urban areas of the [[United States]].  The equipment consists of a pimple or [[pensie pinkie]] ball and a convenient place in a street or driveway where an electric power line or group of power lines bisect horizontally.  The rules come from baseball and are modified to fit the situation.  It can be played with one or more persons per team.

== Rules ==
Opponents stand facing each other on opposite sides of the [[wire]]. Limits of play are defined by agreement, usually the [[width]] of the [[street]] and landmark in the street such as a [[manhole cover]] as the furthest limit of the field. The object of the game is for the “[[batter (baseball)|batter]]” to throw the [[ball]] over or hit the wire to get a hit. The [[Baseball positions|fielder]] must catch the ball before it bounces to make an [[Out (baseball)|out]]. [[Hits (baseball statistics)|Hits]] are scored accordingly- a ball thrown successfully over the wire and uncaught is a [[single (baseball)|single]]. A ball that touches the wire and continues over it is a [[double (baseball)|double]]. A ball that hits the wire squarely and drops straight down is a [[home run]]. If the fielder touches but does not catch a home run ball, it is a [[triple (baseball)|triple]]. If the batter throws the ball under the wire it is a [[strike (baseball)|strike]]. As in [[baseball]], [[foul (sports)|foul]] balls count as strikes for the first two, but you cannot foul-out. The rules vary from neighborhood to neighborhood.

== Tips ==
The ball is thrown hard and high above the wires. The closer the batter can get to a [[Vertical direction|vertical]] [[trajectory]] the better. It is not unusual for the batter to stand almost directly below the wire.
The game is more fun and easier if a group of  wires is used (two or three).
