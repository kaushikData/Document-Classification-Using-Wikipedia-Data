      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1622">A [[bounded sequence|bounded]] [[real number|real]] [[sequence]] &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''almost convergent'' to &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; if each [[Banach limit]] assigns
the same value &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; to the sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

Lorentz proved that &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; is almost convergent if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;\lim\limits_{p\to\infty} \frac{x_{n}+\ldots+x_{n+p-1}}p=L&lt;/math&gt;
uniformly in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

The above limit can be rewritten in detail as
:&lt;math&gt;\forall \varepsilon&gt;0 : \exists p_0 : \forall p&gt;p_0 : \forall n : \left|\frac{x_{n}+\ldots+x_{n+p-1}}p-L\right|&lt;\varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;
Almost convergence is studied in [[summability theory]]. It is an example of a summability method
which cannot be represented as a matrix method.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy,p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anchored Instruction''' is a technology centered learning approach, which falls under the [[social constructionism]] paradigm. It is a form of [[situated learning]] [http://www.instructionaldesign.org/theories/situated-learning.html] that emphasizes [[problem-solving]] within an integrated learning context, which can be examined from multiple perspectives. "In other words, the learning is contextualized to provide students with realistic roles that serve to enhance the learning process", (Fried, Zannini, Wheeler, Lee, &amp; Cortez, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Fried, A., Zannini, K., Wheeler, D., Lee, Y., &amp; Cortez, a. J. (2005). Theory Name: Anchored Instruction. Retrieved from Suny Cortland: http://web.cortland.edu/frieda/id/idtheories/41.html&lt;/ref&gt; During teaching, activities are designed or tied around an "anchor", such as an adventure or story, with a problem at the end, that needs to be resolved. The connection made between the content and the authentic context is referred to as "anchoring". These models typically embed all the information needed for the problem to be solved, such data and hints. Anchored instruction is akin to [[Problem-based learning]] (P.B.L.) with the exception of its open-endedness.

==Principles for designing anchored instruction==
The seven principles outlined, are used to govern the design of anchored instruction (Biswas, Goldman, &amp; Bransford, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Biswas, G., Goldman, S., &amp; Bransford, J. (1997). Anchored Interactive Learning Environments. Intl. Journal of AI in Education, vol 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

#	'''Generative Learning Format''' - An appropriate anchor should be selected for the instruction. This is usually a story that leads to a problem, which is of interest to the students. The end of the story needs to be generated by the learner, which is the solution to the problem. This method provides [[Intrinsic motivation]], through [[Active learning]], because the students take ownership of the problem.
#	'''Video-Based Presentation Format''' - This format allows learner to understand the complex and intertwined problems better than a text or audio format. It solidifies what is taught in textbooks and other literature through a dynamic, visual and spatial representation [http://www.niu.edu/facdev/_pdf/guide/learning/howard_gardner_theory_multiple_intelligences.pdf]. The video medium gives life to the characters and depicts an authentic storyline. This format appeals to students who may have difficulty reading, or understanding written text and allows them to develop pattern recognition skills
#	'''Narrative Format''' - The video is narrated to give an account for the characters, the event, and subsequent events. The problem occurs naturally which give the students the impression they are resolving a real problem and not responding to a lecture on a video. The narrative format also makes it easier to embed information into the story.
#	'''Problem Complexity''' - The story or adventure used should have a high level of complexity to demand the full attention and stimulate the curiosity of the learner. The problems or issues should require several steps to be solved. This is based on the Anchored Interactive Learning Environment's (Ihlström &amp; Westerlund, 2013)&lt;ref&gt;Ihlström, J., &amp; Westerlund, F. (2013). Interactive Learning environments: The effects of interactivity in online learning environments. Institutionen för informatik.&lt;/ref&gt; premise; learners must be trained to deal with complex problems that are more realistic.
#	'''Embedded Data Design''' - The story includes seamlessly embedded information that is needed to solve the issues. It should also include a great deal of extraneous information. When formatted in this manner, the learner would need to understand the question and determine what information is pertinent to answering the question. (Goldman, et al.; Sherwood, et al., 1995).
#	 '''Opportunities for Transfer''' - Learners are able to transfer knowledge from one subject, example [[Geometry]], to the topics in the same subject. This increases [[deep learning]] and skill transfer.
#	'''Links Across the Curriculum''' - In addition to containing all the necessary information, to solve the issue, the story may also introduce topics from other subjects, to provide a holistic learning approach.

==Roles==
Anchored instruction highlights the use of [[Instructional technology]].  Teachers are moved from the source of information to a coach. It is widely used at primary levels, and is applied to Mathematics, Reading and Language skills.

===Role of the Learner===
Anchored instruction, promotes [[active learning]], by motivating and challenging learners. The story or anchor contains embedded data along with other extraneous information; it is the learner's responsibility to decipher, extract and organize pertinent information. The problem that needs to be solved, often requires the learner to take multiple steps, by generating a man smaller questions, that ought to support and guide their thinking. Small groups of learners are the appropriate size for this type of instruction. Members of the group often provide multiple opinions, thus having multiple solutions to the problem. Students are responsible for establishing their learning goals

===Role of the Facilitator===

The facilitators are responsible for providing the anchor, the problem statement and embedded data in the story. Anchored stories also contain hints that act as [[instructional scaffolding]] to resolve problems. Scaffolding provides a temporary framework to support learning. The facilitator coaches and guides the learners through the learning process. They assist students to establish their own learning goals. And accept that they are no longer the major source of knowledge.

In [[psychology]], an '''attribution bias''' or '''attributional bias''' is a [[cognitive bias]] that refers to the [[systematic error]]s made when people evaluate or try to find reasons for their own and others' behaviors.&lt;ref name="Heider"&gt;{{cite book|last=Heider|first=F.|date=1958|title=The psychology of interpersonal relations|location=New York|publisher=Wiley|page= 322}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelley 1967"&gt;Kelley, H.H.

Rather than operating as objective perceivers, people are prone to perceptual errors that lead to biased interpretations of their social world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Funder | first1 = D.C. | year = 1987 | title = Errors and mistakes: Evaluating the accuracy of social judgment | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 101 | issue = 1| pages = 75–90 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.101.1.75 | pmid = 3562704 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nisbett and Ross 1980"&gt;Nisbett, R.E. &amp; Ross, L. (1980). ''Human inference: Strategies and shortcomings of social judgment'', Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attribution biases were first discussed in the 1950s and '60s by psychologists such as [[Fritz Heider]], who studied [[#Attribution theory|attribution theory]].&lt;ref name="Heider"/&gt; Other psychologists, such as [[#Harold Kelley|Harold Kelley]] and [[#Jones &amp; Davis|Ed Jones]] expanded Heider's early work by identifying conditions under which people are more or less likely to make different types of attributions.

Attribution biases are present in everyday life, and therefore are an important and relevant topic to study. For example, when a driver cuts us off, we are more likely to attribute blame to the reckless driver (e.g., "What a jerk!"), rather than situational circumstances (e.g., "Maybe they were in a rush and didn't notice me"). Additionally, there are many different [[#List of attributional biases|types]] of attribution biases, such as the [[ultimate attribution error]], [[#Fundamental attribution error|fundamental attribution error]], [[#Actor-observer bias|actor-observer bias]], and [[#Hostile attribution bias|hostile attribution bias]]. Each of these biases describes a specific tendency that people exhibit when reasoning about the cause of different behaviors.

Since the early work, researchers have continued to examine how and why people exhibit biased interpretations of social information.&lt;ref name="Kelley 1967"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones and Davis 1965"&gt;Jones, E.E. &amp; Davis, K.E. (1965). From acts to dispositions: the attribution process in social psychology. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.) ''Advances in experimental social psychology'', 2, 220–226. Florida: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; Many different types of attribution biases have been identified, and more recent psychological research on these biases has examined how attribution biases can subsequently affect emotions and behavior.&lt;ref name="Jones and Nisbett 1971"&gt;Jones, E.. &amp; Nisbett, R.E.

==History==

===Attribution theory===
Research on [[#attribution bias|attribution biases]] is founded in [[attribution theory]], which was proposed to explain why and how we create meaning about others' and our own behavior. This theory focuses on identifying how an observer uses information in his/her social environment in order to create a causal explanation for events. Attribution theory also provides explanations for why different people can interpret the same event in different ways and what factors contribute to attribution biases.&lt;ref name="Himmelfarb 1974"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Himmelfarb | first1 = S. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1974 | title = Attribution: Perceiving the causes of behavior | url = | journal = Behavioral Science | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 213–215 | doi=10.1002/bs.3830190308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fritz Heider====
Psychologist [[Fritz Heider]] first discussed attributions in his 1958 book, ''The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations''.&lt;ref name="Heider"/&gt; Heider made several important contributions that laid the foundation for further research on attribution theory and attribution biases. He noted that people tend to make distinctions between behaviors that are caused by personal disposition versus environmental or situational conditions. He also predicted that people are more likely to explain others' behavior in terms of dispositional factors (i.e., caused by a given person's personality), while ignoring the surrounding situational demands.

====Jones &amp; Davis====
Building on [[#Fritz Heider|Heider's]] early work, other psychologists in the 1960s and 70s extended work on attributions by offering additional related theories. In 1965, social psychologists Edward E. Jones and Keith Davis proposed an explanation for patterns of attribution termed ''correspondent inference theory''.&lt;ref name="Jones and Davis 1965"/&gt;  A 'correspondent inference' assumes that a person's behavior reflects a stable disposition or personality characteristic. They explained that certain conditions make us more likely to make a correspondent inference about someone's behavior:

;Intention: People are more likely to make a correspondent inference when they interpret someone's behavior as intentional, rather than unintentional.
;Social desirability: People are more likely to make a correspondent inference when an actor's behavior is socially undesirable than when it is conventional.
;Effects of behavior: People are more likely to make a correspondent, or dispositional, inference when someone else's actions yield outcomes that are rare or not yielded by other actions.

====Harold Kelley====
Soon after [[#Jones &amp; Davis|Jones and Davis]] first proposed their correspondent inference theory, [[Harold Kelley]], a social psychologist famous for his work on interdependence theory as well as attribution theory, proposed a ''covariation model'' to explain the way people make attributions.&lt;ref name="Kelley 1967"/&gt; This model helped to explain how people choose to attribute a behavior to an internal disposition versus an environmental factor. Kelley used the term 'covariation' to convey that when making attributions, people have access to information from many observations, across different situations, and at many time points; therefore, people can observe the way a behavior varies under these different conditions. He proposed three factors that influence the way we explain behavior:

* Consensus: The extent to which other people behave in the same way. There is high consensus when most people behave consistent with a given action/actor. Low consensus is when not many people behave in this way.
* Consistency: The extent to which a person usually behaves in a given way. There is high consistency when a person almost always behaves in a specific way. Low consistency is when a person almost never behaves like this.
* Distinctiveness: The extent to which an actor's behavior in one situation is different from his/her behavior in other situations. There is high distinctiveness when an actor does not behave this way in most situations. Low distinctiveness is when an actor usually behaves in a particular way in most situations.

Kelley proposed that people are more likely to make dispositional attributions when consensus is low (most other people don't behave in the same way), consistency is high (a person behaves this way across most situations), and distinctiveness is low (a person's behavior is not unique to this situation). Alternatively, situational attributions are more likely reached when consensus is high, consistency is low, and distinctiveness is high.&lt;ref name="Kelley 1973"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kelley | first1 = H.H. | year = 1973 | title = The process of causal attribution | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 107–128 | doi = 10.1037/h0034225 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His research helped to reveal the specific mechanisms underlying the process of making attributions.

===Biased attributions===
As early researchers explored the way people make causal attributions, they also recognized that attributions do not necessarily reflect reality and can be colored by a person's own perspective.&lt;ref name="Jones and Nisbett 1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Storms 1973"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Storms | first1 = M.D. | year = 1973 | title = Videotape and the attribution process: Reversing actors' and observers' points of view | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 165–175 | doi = 10.1037/h0034782 | pmid=4723963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain conditions can prompt people to exhibit attribution bias, or draw inaccurate conclusions about the cause of a given behavior or outcome. In his work on [[#Attribution theory|attribution theory]], [[#Fritz Heider|Fritz Heider]] noted that in ambiguous situations, people make attributions based on their own wants and needs, which are therefore often skewed.&lt;ref name="Heider"/&gt; He also explained that this tendency was rooted in a need to maintain a positive [[self-concept]], later termed the [[#Self-serving bias|self-serving bias]].

Kelley's covariation model also led to the acknowledgment of attribution biases.&lt;ref name="Kelley 1973"/&gt; The model explained the conditions under which people will make informed dispositional versus situational attributions. But, it assumed that people had access to such information (i.e., the consensus, consistency, and distinctiveness of a person's behavior). What about when we don't have access to such information, for example, when interacting with someone we don't know well? Lack of information results in a tendency to take cognitive shortcuts, resulting in different types of attribution biases, such as the [[#Actor-observer bias|actor-observer bias]] that will be discussed below.&lt;ref name="Jones and Nisbett 1971"/&gt;

====Cognitive explanation====
Although psychologists agreed that people are prone to these cognitive biases, there existed disagreement concerning the cause of such biases. On one hand, supporters of a "cognitive model" argued that biases were a product of human information processing constraints. One major proponent of this view was [[Yale]] psychologist Michael Storms, who proposed this cognitive explanation following his 1973 study of social perception.&lt;ref name="Storms 1973"/&gt; In his experiment, participants viewed a conversation between two individuals; we'll call them Actor one and Actor two. Some participants viewed the conversation while facing Actor one, such that they were unable to see the front of Actor two, while other participants viewed the conversation while facing Actor two, obstructed from the front of Actor one. Following the conversation, participants were asked to make attributions about the conversationalists. He found that participants ascribed more causal influence to the person they were looking at. In other words, participants made different attributions about people depending on the information they had access to. Storms used these results to bolster his theory of cognitively driven attribution biases; because we have no access to the world except for through our own eyes, we are inevitably constrained and consequently prone to biases. Similarly, social psychologist [[Anthony Greenwald]] described humans as possessing a ''totalitarian ego'', meaning that we view the world through our own personal selves.&lt;ref name="Greenwald 1980"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenwald | first1 = A.G. | year = 1973 | title = The totalitarian ego: Fabrication and revision of personal history | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 35 | issue = 7| pages = 603–618 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.35.7.603 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, different people inevitably interpret the world differently and in turn reach different conclusions.

====Motivational explanation====
These views of attributional biases as being a sole product of information processing constraints received criticism from researchers who argued that humans do not just passively interpret their world and make attributions; rather, they are active and goal-driven. Building on this criticism, research began to focus on the role of motives in driving attribution biases.&lt;ref name="Tetlock and Levi 1982"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tetlock | first1 = P.E. | last2 = Levi | first2 = A. | year = 1982 | title = Attribution bias: On the inconclusiveness of the cognition-motivation debate | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 68–88 | doi = 10.1016/0022-1031(82)90082-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers such as [[Ziva Kunda]] drew attention to the motivated aspects of attributions and attribution biases. Kunda in particular argued that certain biases only appear when people are presented with motivational pressures; therefore, they can't be exclusively explained by an objective cognitive process.&lt;ref name="Kunda 1987"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kunda | first1 = Z | year = 1987 | title = Motivated inference: Self-serving generation and evaluation of causal theories | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 53 | issue = 4| pages = 636–647 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.53.4.636}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, we're more likely to construct biased social judgments when we're motivated to arrive at a particular conclusion, so long as we can justify this conclusion.&lt;ref name="Kunda 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kunda | first1 = Z | year = 1990 | title = The case for motivated reasoning | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 108 | issue = 3| pages = 480–498 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.53.4.636 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current theory==
Early researchers explained attribution biases as cognitively driven and a product of information processing errors. In the early 1980s, studies demonstrated that there may also be a motivational component to attribution biases, such that our own desires and emotions affect how we interpret social information.&lt;ref name="Kunda 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zuckerman 1979"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zuckerman, M.|year=1979|title=Attribution of success and failure revisited, or: The motivational bias is alive and well in attribution theory|journal=Journal of Personality|volume=47|issue=2|pages=245–287|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1979.tb00202.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current research continues to explore the validity of both of these explanations by examining the function of [[#Types of attribution biases|specific types of attribution biases]] and their behavioral correlates through a variety of methods (e.g., research with children or using [[fMRI|brain imaging techniques]]).&lt;ref name="Connolly and Bukszar 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Connolly, T.|author2=Bukszar, E.W.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1990|title=Hindsight bias: Self-flattery or cognitive error? |journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|volume=3|issue=3|pages=205–211|doi=10.1002/bdm.3960030305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Runions and Keating 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Runions, K.C.|author2=Keating, D.P.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2007|title=Children's social information processing: Family antecedents and behavioral correlates|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=43|issue=4|pages=838–849|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.43.4.838|pmid=17605518}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blackwood 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Blackwood, N.J.|displayauthors=etal|year=2003|title=Self-responsibility and the self-serving bias: an fMRI investigation of causal attributions|journal=NeuroImage|volume=20|issue=2|pages=1076–1085|doi=10.1016/S1053-8119(03)00331-8|pmid=14568477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research on attribution biases has focused on identifying specific types of these biases and their effect on people's behavior.&lt;ref name="Crick and Dodge 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hewstone 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hewstone, M.|author2=Rubin, M.|author3= Willis, H.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2002|title=Intergroup bias|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=53|issue=1|pages=575–604|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135109|pmid=11752497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some psychologists have taken an [[applied psychology|applied]] approach and demonstrated how these biases can be understood in real-world contexts (e.g., the workplace or school).&lt;ref name="Perry 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Perry, R.P.|author2=Stupnisky, R.H.|author3=Hall, N.C.|author4=Chipperfield, J.G.|author5=Weiner, B.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2010|title=Bad starts and better finishes: Attributional retraining and initial performance in competitive achievement settings|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|volume=29|issue=6|pages=668–700|doi=10.1521/jscp.2010.29.6.668}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martinko 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Martinko, M.J.|author2=Harvey, P.|author3=Sikora, D.|author4=Douglas, S.C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2011|title=Perceptions of abusive supervision: The role of subordinates' attribution styles|journal=The Leadership Quarterly|volume=22|issue=4|pages=751–764|doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2011.05.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have also used the theoretical framework of [[attribution (psychology)|attribution]]s and [[#attribution bias|attribution biases]] in order to modify the way people interpret social information. Studies have implemented [[#Academic achievement|attributional retraining]] to help, for example, students have more positive perceptions of their own academic abilities.&lt;ref name="Perry 2010"/&gt;

==Limitations of the theory==

There is much inconsistency in the claims made by scientists and researchers that attempt to prove or disprove attribution theories and the concept of attributional biases. The theory was formed as a comprehensive explanation of the way people interpret the basis of behaviors in human interactions. However, there have been studies that indicate cultural differences in the attribution biases between people of Eastern and Western societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Choi|first=I.|author2=Nisbett, R.E.|author3=Norenzayan, A.|title=Causal attribution across cultures: Variation and universality|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1999|pages=47–63|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.125.1.47|volume=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some scientists believe that attributional biases are only exhibited in certain contexts of interaction where possible outcomes or expectations make the forming of attributions necessary. These criticisms of the attribution model reveal that the theory may not be a general, universal principle.&lt;ref name="Manusov"&gt;{{cite book|title=Engaging Theories in Interpersonal Communication: Multiple Perspectives.|year=2008|publisher=Sage Publications.|author=Manusov, V.|author2=Spitzberg, B.|chapter=Attribution theory: Finding good cause in the search for theory.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Researchers have identified many different specific types of attribution biases, all of which describe ways in which people exhibit biased interpretations of information. Note that this is not an exhaustive list (see [[#List of attributional biases|List of attributional biases]] for more).

===Fundamental attribution error===
{{Main|Fundamental attribution error}}
The fundamental attribution error refers to a bias in explaining others' behaviors. According to this error, when we make attributions about another person's actions, we are likely to overemphasize the role of dispositional factors, while minimizing the influence of situational factors.&lt;ref name="Ross 1977"&gt;Ross, L. (1977). The intuitive psychologist and his shortcomings: Distortions in the attribution process. ''Advances in Experimental Social Psychology'', New York: Academic Press. pp. 173–220.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if we see a coworker bump into someone on his way to a meeting, we are more likely to explain this behavior in terms of our coworker's carelessness or hastiness, rather than considering that he was running late to a meeting.

This term was first proposed in the early 1970s by psychologist [[Lee Ross]] following an experiment he conducted with [[Edward E. Jones]] and Victor Harris in 1967.&lt;ref name="Jones and Harris 1967"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = E.E. | last2 = Harris | first2 = V.A. | year = 1967 | title = The attribution of attitudes . | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 1–24 | doi = 10.1016/0022-1031(67)90034-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, participants were instructed to read two essays; one expressed pro-[[Fidel Castro|Castro]] views, and the other expressed anti-Castro views. Participants were then asked to report their attitudes towards the writers under two separate conditions. When participants were informed that the writers voluntarily chose their position towards Castro, participants predictably expressed more positive attitudes towards the anti-Castro writer. However, when participants were told that the writers' positions were determined by a coin toss, rather than their own free will, participants continued to express more positive attitudes towards the anti-Castro writer. These results demonstrated that participants did not take situational factors into account when evaluating a third party, providing evidence of what was later coined the fundamental attribution error.

===Actor-observer bias===
{{Main|Actor–observer asymmetry}}
The actor-observer bias (also actor–observer asymmetry) can be thought of as an extension of the fundamental attribution error. According to the actor-observer bias, in addition to over-valuing dispositional explanations of others' behaviors, we tend to under-value dispositional explanations and over-value situational explanations of our ''own'' behavior. For example, a student who studies may explain her behavior by referencing situational factors (e.g., "I have an exam coming up"), whereas others will explain her studying by referencing dispositional factors (e.g., "She's ambitious and hard-working").  This bias was first proposed by [[Edward E. Jones]] and [[Richard E. Nisbett]] in 1971, who explained that "actors tend to attribute the causes of their behavior to stimuli inherent in the situation, while observers tend to attribute behavior to stable dispositions of the actor."&lt;ref name="Jones and Nisbett 1971"/&gt;

There has been some controversy over the theoretical foundation of the actor-observer bias. In a 2006 meta-analysis of all published studies of the bias since 1971, the author found that Jones' and Nisbett's original explanation did not hold.&lt;ref name="Malle 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Malle | first1 = B.F. | year = 2006 | title = The actor-observer asymmetry in attribution: A surprising meta-analysis | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 132 | issue = 6| pages = 895–919 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.132.6.895 | pmid=17073526}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas Jones and Nisbett proposed that actors and observers explain behaviors as attributions to either dispositions or situational factors, examining past studies revealed that this assumption may be flawed. Rather, the theoretical reformulation posits that the way we explain behavior depends on whether or not it is intentional, among other things. For more information on this theoretical reformulation, see [[Actor–observer asymmetry|actor-observer asymmetry]], or refer to Malle's meta-analysis in [[#Further reading]].

===Self-serving bias===
{{Main|Self-serving bias}}
A self-serving bias refers to people's tendency to attribute their successes to internal factors but attribute their failures to external.&lt;ref name="Darity 2008"&gt;Darity, W.A. (2008). "International encyclopedia of the social sciences." Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA.&lt;/ref&gt; This bias helps to explain why we tend to take credit for our successes while often denying any responsibility for failures. For example, a tennis player who wins his match might say, "I won because I'm a good athlete," whereas the loser might say, "I lost because the referee was unfair."

The self-serving bias has been thought of as a means of self-esteem maintenance.&lt;ref name="Larson 1977"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Larson | first1 = J.R. | year = 1977 | title = Evidence for a self-serving bias in the attribution of causality | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 430–441 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.1977.tb00162.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, we feel better about ourselves by taking credit for successes and creating external blames for failure. This is further reinforced by research showing that as self-threat increases, people are more likely to exhibit a self-serving bias.&lt;ref name="Campbell and Sedikides 1999"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = W.K.C. | last2 = Sedikides | first2 = C. | year = 1999 | title = Self-threat magnifies the self-serving bias: A meta-analytic integration | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 23–43 | doi = 10.1037/1089-2680.3.1.23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, participants who received negative feedback on a laboratory task were more likely to attribute their task performance to external, rather than internal, factors. Therefore, the self-serving bias seems to function as an [[Defence mechanisms|ego-protection mechanism]], helping people to better cope with personal failures.

===Hostile attribution bias===
{{Main|Hostile attribution bias}}
{{See also|Ideas of reference and delusions of reference}}
Hostile attribution bias (HAB) has been defined as an [[interpretive bias]] wherein individuals exhibit a tendency to interpret others' ambiguous behaviors as hostile, rather than benign.&lt;ref name="Crick and Dodge 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Camodeca 2003"/&gt; For example, if a child witnesses two other children whispering and assumes they are talking about him/her, that child makes an attribution of hostile intent, even though the other children's behavior was potentially benign. Research has indicated that there is an association between hostile attribution bias and [[aggression]], such that people who are more likely to interpret someone else's behavior as hostile are also more likely to engage in aggressive behavior.&lt;ref name="Steinberg and Dodge 1983"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steinberg | first1 = M.S. | last2 = Dodge | first2 = K.A. | year = 1983 | title = Attributional bias in aggressive adolescent boys and girls | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 312–321 | doi = 10.1521/jscp.1983.1.4.312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Camodeca 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Camodeca | first1 = M. | last2 = Goossens | first2 = F.A. | year = 2005 | title = Aggression, social cognitions, anger and sadness in bullies and victims | url = https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/26cb5aac-177b-41d1-aace-0988ccf91679| journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 46 | issue = 2| pages = 186–197 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00347.x | pmid = 15679527 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; See the following section on [[#Aggression|aggression]] for more details on this association.

==Consequences for behavior==

===Aggression===
Extensive research in both [[social psychology|social]] and [[developmental psychology]] has examined the relationship between aggressive behavior and attribution biases, with a specific focus on the [[#Hostile attribution bias|hostile attribution bias]].&lt;ref name="Steinberg and Dodge 1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Camodeca 2005"/&gt;

In particular, researchers have consistently found that children who exhibit a hostile attribution bias (tendency to perceive others' intent as hostile, as opposed to benign) are more likely to engage in aggressive behaviors.&lt;ref name="Crick and Dodge 1996"/&gt; More specifically, hostile attribution bias has been associated with reactive aggression, as opposed to proactive aggression, as well as [[victimization]].  Whereas proactive aggression is unprovoked and goal-driven, reactive aggression is an angry, retaliatory response to some sort of perceived provocation.&lt;ref name="Dodge and Coie 1987"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dodge | first1 = K.A. | last2 = Coie | first2 = J.D. | year = 1987 | title = Social-information-processing factors in reactive and proactive aggression in children's peer groups | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 53 | issue = 6| pages = 1146–1158 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.53.6.1146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, children who are victims of aggression may develop views of peers as hostile, leading them to be more likely to engage in retaliatory, or reactive, aggression.&lt;ref name="Schwartz 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schwartz | first1 = D. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1998 | title = Social-cognitive and behavioral correlates of aggression and victimization in boys' play groups | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology | volume = 26 | issue = 6| pages = 431–440 | doi = 10.1023/A:1022695601088 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has also indicated that children can develop hostile attribution bias by engaging in aggression in the context of a video game.&lt;ref name="Kirsh 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kirsh | first1 = S.J. | year = 1998 | title = Seeing the world through Mortal Kombat-colored glasses: Violent video games and the development of a short-term hostile attribution bias | url = | journal = Childhood | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 177–184 | doi = 10.1177/0907568298005002005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1998 study, participants played either a very violent or non-violent video game and were then asked to read several hypothetical stories where a peer's intent was ambiguous. For example, participants may read about their peer hitting someone in the head with a ball, but it is unclear whether or not the peer did this intentionally or not. Participants then responded to questions about their peer's intent (e.g., "Do you think your peer hit someone with the ball on purpose?"). The children who played the violent video game, as compared to participants who played the nonviolent game, were more likely to say that their peer harmed someone on purpose. This finding provided evidence that just playing a violent video game could cause children to develop a short-term hostile attribution bias.

===Intergroup relations===
Research has found that we often exhibit attribution biases when interpreting the behavior of others, and specifically when explaining the behavior of in-group versus out-group members. More specifically, a review of the literature on intergroup attribution biases noted that people generally favor dispositional explanations of an in-group member's positive behavior and situational explanations for an in-group's negative behavior.&lt;ref name="Hewstone 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hewstone | first1 = M | year = 1990 | title = The 'ultimate attribution error'? A review of the literature on intergroup causal attribution | url = | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 311–335 | doi = 10.1002/ejsp.2420200404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, people are more likely to do the opposite when explaining the behavior of an out-group member (i.e., attribute positive behavior to situational factors and negative behavior to disposition). Essentially, group members' attributions tend to favor the in-group. This finding has important implications for understanding other social psychological topics, such as the development and persistence of out-group [[stereotype]]s.&lt;ref name="Hewstone 2002"/&gt;

Attribution biases in intergroup relations are also observed as early as childhood. In particular, elementary school students are more likely to make dispositional attributions when their friends perform positive behaviors, but situational attributions when disliked peers perform positive behaviors. Similarly, children are more likely to attribute friends' negative behaviors to situational factors, whereas they attribute disliked peers' negative behaviors to dispositional factors.&lt;ref name="Guerin 1999"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guerin | first1 = B | year = 1999 | title = Children's intergroup attribution bias for liked and disliked peers | url = | journal = The Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 139 | issue = 5| pages = 583–589 | doi = 10.1080/00224549909598418 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings provide evidence that attribution biases emerge as early as childhood.

===Academic achievement===
Although certain attribution biases are associated with maladaptive behaviors, such as aggression, some research has also indicated that these biases are flexible and can be altered to produce positive outcomes. Much of this work falls within the domain of improving academic achievement through attributional retraining. For example, one study found that students who were taught to modify their attributions actually performed better on homework assignments and lecture materials.&lt;ref name="Perry and Penner 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perry | first1 = R.P. | last2 = Penner | first2 = K.S. | year = 1990 | title = Enhancing academic achievement in college students through attributional retraining and instruction | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 82 | issue = 2| pages = 262–271 | doi = 10.1037/0022-0663.82.2.262 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The retraining process specifically targeted students who tended to attribute poor academic performance to external factors and taught them that poor performance was often attributable to internal and unstable factors, such as effort and ability. Therefore, the retraining helped students perceive greater control over their own academic success by altering their attributional process.

More recent research has extended these findings and examined the value of attributional retraining for helping students adjust to an unfamiliar and competitive setting. In one study, first year college students went through attributional retraining following their first exam in a two-semester course.&lt;ref name="Perry 2010"/&gt; Similar to the previous study, they were taught to make more controllable attributions (e.g., "I can improve my test grade by studying more") and less uncontrollable attributions (e.g., "No matter what I do, I'll fail"). For students who performed low or average on their first exam, attributional retraining resulted in higher in-class test grades and GPA in the second semester. Students who performed well on the first exam were found to have more positive emotions in the second semester, following attributional retraining. Taken together, these studies provide evidence for the flexibility and modifiability of attributional biases.

'''Abdul Ghaffār Khān''' (6 February 1890 – 20 January 1988), nicknamed '''Fakhr-e-Afghān''', lit. "pride of Afghans"), '''Bādshāh Khān''', or '''Bāchā Khān''', "king of [[Khan (title)|chiefs]]"), was a [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] [[Indian independence movement|independence activist]] who worked to end the rule of the [[British Raj]]. He was a political and spiritual leader known for his [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] opposition; he was a lifelong [[pacifism|pacifist]] and devout [[Muslim]].&lt;ref&gt;''An American Witness to India's Partition'' by Phillips Talbot, (2007), Sage Publications {{ISBN|978-0-7619-3618-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A close friend of [[Mohandas Gandhi]], Bacha Khan was nicknamed the "Frontier Gandhi" in [[British India]] by his close associate [[Amir Chand Bombwal]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/uttarakhand/community/uttarakhand-journalist-gave-frontier-gandhi-title-to-abdul-gaffar-khan-claims-book/174496.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RazaAhmad1990"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raza|first1=Moonis|last2=Ahmad|first2=Aijazuddin|title=An Atlas of Tribal India: With Computed Tables of District-level Data and Its Geographical Interpretation|year=1990|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=9788170222866|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacha Khan founded the [[Khudai Khidmatgar]] ("Servants of God") movement in 1929.

After the partition, Bacha Khan pledged allegiance to [[Pakistan]], but was frequently arrested by the Pakistani government between 1948 and 1954. In 1956, he was again arrested for his opposition to the [[One Unit]] program, under which the government announced its plan to merge all provinces of [[West Pakistan]] into a single province. Khan was jailed or in exile during much of the 1960s and 1970s. Upon his death in 1988 in [[Peshawar]] under house arrest, following his will, he was buried at his house in [[Jalalabad, Afghanistan|Jalalabad]], [[Afghanistan]]. Tens of thousands of mourners attended his funeral, marching through the [[Khyber Pass]] from Peshawar to Jalalabad. It was marred by two bomb explosions that killed 15 people. Despite the heavy fighting at the time during the [[Soviet–Afghan War]], both sides, namely the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|communist army]] and the [[Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen|mujahideen]], declared a ceasefire to allow Khan's burial.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

== Early years ==
Bacha Khan was born on 6 February 1890 into a generally peaceful and prosperous [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] family from [[Utmanzai, Charsadda|Utmanzai]] in the Peshawar Valley of [[British Raj|British India]]. His father, Bahram Khan, was a land owner in the area commonly referred to as Hashtnaghar. Bacha Khan was the second son of Bahram to attend the British-run Edward's Mission School, the only fully functioning school in the region run by missionaries. At school the young Bacha Khan did well in his studies, and was inspired by his mentor Reverend Wigram to see the importance of education in service to the community. In his 10th and final year of high school, he was offered a highly prestigious commission in the [[Corps of Guides (India)|Corps of Guides]], a regiment of the [[British Indian Army]]. Bacha Khan refused the commission after realising that even Guides officers were still second-class citizens in their own country. He resumed his intention of university study, and Reverend Wigram offered him the opportunity to follow his brother, [[Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan]], to study in [[London]]. An alumnus of [[Aligarh Muslim University]], Bacha Khan eventually received the permission of his father. However, Bacha Khan's mother wasn't willing to let another son go to London, so Bacha Khan began working on his father's lands, attempting to discern what more he might do with his life.&lt;ref name="Karl"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/07/opinion/07MEYE.html The Peacemaker of the Pashtun Past] By KARL E. MEYER ''The New York Times''. 7 December 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, at the age of 20, Khan opened a [[mosque school]] in his hometown of Utmanzai. In 1911, he joined independence movement of the Pashtun independence activist [[Haji Sahib of Turangzai]]. However, in 1915, the British authorities banned his mosque school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baachakhantrust.org/Chronology%20of%20Baacha%20Khan.pdf |title=Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan |publisher=Baacha Khan Trust |accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having witnessed the repeated failure of revolts against the British Raj, Khan decided that social activism and reform would be more beneficial for the Pashtuns. This led to the formation of ''Anjuman-e Islāh-e Afghānia'' ({{lang|ps|انجمن اصلاح افاغنه}}, "Afghan Reform Society") in 1921, and the youth movement ''Pax̌tūn Jirga'' ({{lang|ps|پښتون جرګه}}, "Pashtun [[Jirga|Assembly]]") in 1927. After Khan's return from the [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] in May 1928, he founded the [[Pashto language|Pashto]]-language monthly political journal ''Pax̌tūn'' ({{lang|ps|پښتون}}, "Pashtun"). Finally, in November 1929, Khan founded the ''[[Khudai Khidmatgar|Khudāyī Khidmatgār]]'' ({{lang|ps|خدايي خدمتګار}}, "Servants of God") movement, whose success triggered a harsh crackdown by the British authorities against him and his supporters. They suffered some of the most severe repression of the Indian independence movement from the British Raj.&lt;ref name="Zartman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zartman |first=I. William |authorlink=I.

In response to his inability to continue his own education, Bacha Khan turned to helping others start theirs. Like many such regions of the world, the strategic importance of the newly formed North-West Frontier Province (now [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Pakistan]]) as a buffer for the [[British India|British Raj]] from Russian influence was of little benefit to its residents. The oppression of the British, the repression of the mullahs, and an ancient culture of violence and vendetta prompted Bacha Khan to want to serve and uplift his fellow men and women by means of education. At 20 years of age, Bacha Khan opened his first school in [[Utmanzai, Charsadda|Utmanzai]]. It was an instant success and he was soon invited into a larger circle of progressively minded reformers.

While he faced much opposition and personal difficulties, Bacha Khan Khan worked tirelessly to organise and raise the consciousness of his fellow Pushtuns. Between 1915 and 1918 he visited 500 villages in all part of the settled districts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. It was in this frenzied activity that he had come to be known as ''Badshah (Bacha) Khan'' (King of Chiefs).&lt;ref name="Karl"/&gt;

Being a [[secular]] Muslim he did not believe in religious divisions. He married his first wife Meharqanda in 1912; she was a daughter of Yar Mohammad Khan of the Kinankhel clan of the Mohammadzai tribe of Razzar, a village adjacent to Utmanzai. They had a son in 1913, Abdul Ghani Khan, who would become a noted artist and poet. Subsequently, they had another son, Abdul Wali Khan (17 January 1917–), and daughter, Sardaro. Meharqanda died during the [[1918 flu pandemic|1918 influenza epidemic]]. In 1920, Bacha Khan remarried; his new wife, Nambata, was a cousin of his first wife and the daughter of Sultan Mohammad Khan of Razzar. She bore him a daughter, Mehar Taj (25 May 1921 – 29 April 2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epeshawar.com/peshawarnews/4049-daughter-of-bacha-khan-passes-away.html|title=Retrieved 20 May 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a son, Abdul Ali Khan (20 August 1922 – 19 February 1997). Tragically, in 1926 Nambata died early as well from a fall down the stairs of the apartment they were staying at in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khyber.org/people/literary/GhaniKhan.shtml Kyber Gateway] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823223758/http://www.khyber.org/people/literary/GhaniKhan.shtml |date=23 August 2007 }}, Retrieved 9 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Khudai Khidmatgar ==
[[Image:Nv-army-gray BG.jpg|thumb|Khudai Khidmatgar]]

In time, Bacha Khan's goal came to be the formulation of a united, independent, secular India. To achieve this end, he founded the ''[[Khudai Khidmatgar]]'' ("Servants of God"), commonly known as the "Red Shirts" (''Surkh Pōsh''), during the 1920s.

The ''Khudai Khidmatgar'' was founded on a belief in the power of Gandhi's notion of [[Satyagraha]], a form of active [[non-violence]] as captured in an [[Khudai Khidmatgar#The Oath of the Khudai Khidmatgar|oath]]. He told its members:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I am going to give you such a weapon that the police and the army will not be able to stand against it. It is the weapon of the Prophet, but you are not aware of it. That weapon is patience and righteousness. No power on earth can stand against it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forusa.org/fellowship/sept-oct-04/abu-nimer.html Nonviolence in the Islamic Context by Mohammed Abu Nimer 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701052717/http://www.forusa.org/fellowship/sept-oct-04/abu-nimer.html |date=1 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The organisation recruited over 100,000 members and became legendary in opposing (and dying at the hands of) the British-controlled police and army. Through strikes, political organisation and non-violent opposition, the ''Khudai Khidmatgar'' were able to achieve some success and came to dominate the politics of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. His brother, Dr. [[Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan]] (known as Dr. Khan Sahib), led the political wing of the movement, and was the [[Chief Minister]] of the province (from 1937 and then until 1947 when his government was dismissed by [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]] of the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]]).

=== Kissa Khwani massacre ===

{{main|Qissa Khwani bazaar massacre}}

On 23 April 1930, Bacha Khan was arrested during protests arising out of the [[Salt Satyagraha]]. A crowd of Khudai Khidmatgar gathered in Peshawar's [[Qissa Khwani bazaar massacre|Kissa Khwani (Storytellers) Bazaar]]. The British ordered troops to open fire with machine guns on the unarmed crowd, killing an estimated 200–250.&lt;ref&gt;Habib, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The Khudai Khidmatgar members acted in accord with their training in non-violence under Bacha Khan, facing bullets as the troops fired on them.&lt;ref&gt;Johansen, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Two platoons of [[The Garhwal Rifles]] regiment under Chandra Singh Garhwali refused to fire on the non-violent crowd. They were later court-martialled with heavy punishment, including life imprisonment.

== Bacha Khan and the Indian National Congress ==
{{Main|Indian National Congress}}
[[Image:Badshah Khan.jpg|thumb|Bacha Khan with [[Mohandas Gandhi]].]]
Bacha Khan forged a close, spiritual, and uninhibited friendship with Gandhi, the pioneer of non-violent mass civil disobedience in India. The two had a deep admiration towards each other and worked together closely till 1947.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica-Abdul Ghaffar Khan"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/232353/Khan-Abdul-Ghaffar-Khan| title = Abdul Ghaffar Khan|publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" iloveindia.com -Abdul Ghaffar Khan"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.iloveindia.com/indian-heroes/abdul-ghaffar-khan.html| title = Abdul Ghaffar Khan|publisher = I Love India|accessdate = 24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Khudai Khidmatgar'' (servants of god) agitated and worked cohesively with the [[Indian National Congress]], the leading national organisation fighting for independence, of which Bacha Khan was a senior and respected member. On several occasions when the Congress seemed to disagree with Gandhi on policy, Bacha Khan remained his staunchest ally. In 1931 the Congress offered him the presidency of the party, but he refused saying, "I am a simple soldier and Khudai Khidmatgar, and I only want to serve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20000305/spectrum/main2.htm#2|title=The Sunday Tribune - Spectrum - Article|website=www.tribuneindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained a member of the Congress Working Committee for many years, resigning only in 1939 because of his differences with the Party's War Policy. He rejoined the Congress Party when the War Policy was revised.

Bacha Khan was a champion of women's rights {{dubious|date=June 2017}} and nonviolence. He became a hero in a society dominated by violence; notwithstanding his liberal views, his unswerving faith and obvious bravery led to immense respect. Throughout his life, he never lost faith in his non-violent methods or in the compatibility of [[Islam and nonviolence]]. He recognised as a [[jihad]] struggle with only the enemy holding swords. He was closely identified with Gandhi because of his non-violence principles and he is known in India as the 'Frontier Gandhi'.&lt;ref name=" iloveindia.com -Abdul Ghaffar Khan"/&gt; One of his Congress associates was [[Pandit Amir Chand Bombwal]] of Peshawar.

== The Partition ==
{{Main|Partition of India}}

[[File:Gandhi and Abdul Ghaffar Khan during prayer Cropped Brighter.jpg|thumb|Bacha Khan with Gandhi.]]
Khan strongly opposed the [[partition of India]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica-Abdul Ghaffar Khan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" iloveindia.com -Abdul Ghaffar Khan"/&gt; Accused as being anti-Muslim by some politicians, Khan was physically assaulted in 1946, leading to his hospitalisation in Peshawar.&lt;ref&gt;Abdul Ghaffar Khan, 98, a Follower of Gandhi Published: 21 January 1988. New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 21, 1947, in [[Bannu]], a [[loya jirga]] was held consisting of Bacha Khan, the Khudai Khidmatgars, members of the Provincial Assembly, [[Mirzali Khan]] (Faqir of Ipi), and other tribal chiefs, just seven weeks before the partition. The loya jirga declared the [[Bannu Resolution]], which demanded that the Pashtuns be given a choice to have an independent state of [[Pashtunistan]] composing all Pashtun territories of British India, instead of being made to join either India or Pakistan. However, the [[British Raj]] refused to comply with the demand of this resolution.&lt;ref name="Ali Shah"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas Howard"/&gt;

The congress party refused last-ditch compromises to prevent the partition, like the [[Cabinet Mission]] plan and Gandhi's suggestion to offer the position of Prime Minister to Jinnah. As a result, Bacha Khan and his followers felt a sense of betrayal by both Pakistan and India. Bacha Khan's last words to Gandhi and his erstwhile allies in the Congress party were: "You have thrown us to the wolves."&lt;ref name="icdc.com"/&gt;

When the referendum over accession to Pakistan was held, Bacha Khan, the Khudai Khidmatgars and the [[Indian National Congress Party]] boycotted the referendum. Some have argued that a segment of the population voted was barred from voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9iwFmvKTwcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA107,M1 |title=The Dust of Empire: The Race For Mastery In The Asian Heartland – Karl E.

Bacha Khan took the oath of allegiance to the new nation of Pakistan on 23 February 1948 at the first session of the Pakistan Constituent Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baachakhantrust.org/AbdulGhaffarKhan.pdf |title=LOVE |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Abdul Ghafar Khan, Nehru, and Sardar Patel 1946.jpg|thumb|right|Bacha Khan walking with [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] after the Cabinet Mission, 1946.]]
He pledged full support to the government and attempted to reconcile with the founder of the new state Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Initial overtures led to a successful meeting in Karachi, however a follow-up meeting in the Khudai Khidmatgar headquarters never materialised, allegedly due to the role of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister, [[Abdul Qayyum Khan]] who warned Jinnah that Bacha Khan was plotting his assassination.&lt;ref name="Korejo"&gt;M.S.

Following this, Bacha Khan formed Pakistan's first National opposition party, on 8 May 1948, the Pakistan Azad Party. The party pledged to play the role of constructive opposition and would be non-communal in its philosophy.

However, suspicions of his allegiance persisted and under the new Pakistani government, Bacha Khan was placed under house arrest without charge from 1948 till 1954. Released from prison, he gave a speech again on the floor of the constituent assembly, this time condemning the massacre of his supporters at [[Babrra massacre|Babrra]].&lt;ref&gt;Syed Minhajul Hassan,(1998) Babra Firing Incident: 12 August 1948, Peshawar: University of Peshawar.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Bacha Khan was named an "[[Amnesty International]] Prisoner of the Year". Amnesty's statement about him said, "His example symbolizes the suffering of upward of a million people all over the world who are [[prisoner of conscience|prisoners of conscience]]."

In September 1964, the Pakistani authorities allowed him to go to United Kingdom for treatment. During the winter, his doctor advised him to go to United States. He then went into exile to Afghanistan, he returned from exile in December 1972 to popular support, following the establishment of a National Awami Party provincial government in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North West Frontier Province]] and [[Balochistan]].

He was arrested by Prime Minister [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]]'s government at Multan in November 1973 and described Bhuttos government as "the worst kind of dictatorship".&lt;ref name="Wolpert"&gt;Wolpert, Stanley A. 1993.

His final major political challenge was against the [[Kalabagh dam]] project, fearing that the project would damage the Peshawar valley, his hostility to it would eventually lead to the project being shelved after his death.

Bacha Khan died in Peshawar under house arrest in 1988 and was buried in his house at [[Jalalabad, Afghanistan|Jalalabad]], Afghanistan. Over 200,000 mourners attended his funeral, including the Afghan president [[Mohammad Najibullah]]. This was a symbolic move by Bacha Khan, as this would allow his dream of Pashtun unification to live even after his death. Then Indian Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]] went to Peshawar, to pay his tributes to Bacha Khan despite the fact that General [[Zia ul-Haq]] attempted to stall his attendance citing security reasons. Additionally, the Indian government declared a five-day period of mourning in his honour.&lt;ref name="Abdul Ghaffar Khan 1988"/&gt;

Although he had been repeatedly imprisoned and persecuted, tens of thousands of mourners attended his funeral, described by one commentator as ''a caravan of peace, carrying a message of love'' from Pashtuns east of the Khyber to those on the west,&lt;ref name="Korejo"/&gt; marching through the historic [[Khyber Pass]] from Peshawar to Jalalabad. A cease-fire was announced in the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Afghan Civil War]] to allow the funeral to take place, even though it was marred by bomb explosions killing 15.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/23/world/15-killed-at-afghan-rites-for-pathan-leader.html January 23, 1988] edition of ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political legacy ==
[[File:Gandhi and Abdul Gaffa Khan.jpg|thumb|right]]
His eldest son [[Ghani Khan]] was a poet, his other son [[Khan Abdul Wali Khan]] is the founder and leader of the [[Awami National Party]] and was the Leader of the Opposition in the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|Pakistan National Assembly]].

His third son [[Khan Abdul Ali Khan]] was non-political and a distinguished educator, and served as Vice-Chancellor of [[University of Peshawar]]. Ali Khan was also the head of [[Aitchison College]], [[Lahore]] and Fazle Haq college, [[Mardan]].

[[Mohammed Yahya]] Education Minister of [[Khyber Pukhtunkhwa]], was the only son in law of Bacha Khan.

[[Asfandyar Wali Khan]] is the grandson of Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan, and leader of the Awami National Party. The party was in power from 2008 to 2013.

[[Salma Ataullahjan]] is the great grand niece of Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan and a member of the [[Senate of Canada]].

Bacha Khan's political legacy is renowned amongst Pashtuns and Hindus as a leader of a non-violent movement. Within Pakistan, however, the vast majority of society have questioned his stance with the All India Congress over the Muslim League as well as his opposition to Quaid-e-Azam. In particular, people have questioned where Bacha Khan's patriotism rests following his insistence that he be buried in Afghanistan after his death and not Pakistan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11123">In mathematics, the '''Banach–Caccioppoli [[fixed-point theorem]]''' (also known as the '''contraction mapping theorem''' or '''contraction mapping principle''') is an important tool in the theory of [[metric space]]s; it guarantees the existence and uniqueness of [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]] of certain self-maps of metric spaces, and provides a constructive method to find those fixed points.  The theorem is named after [[Stefan Banach]] (1892–1945) and [[Renato Caccioppoli]] (1904–1959), and was first stated by Banach in 1922. Caccioppoli independently proved the theorem in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emis.de/journals/BJMA/tex_v1_n1_a1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement==
''Definition.'' Let &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[metric space]]. Then a map &lt;math&gt;T\colon X \to X&lt;/math&gt; is called a [[contraction mapping]] on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if there exists &lt;math&gt;q\in [0, 1)&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;d(T(x),T(y)) \le q d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;x, y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Banach Fixed Point Theorem.''' Let &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; be a non-empty [[complete metric space]] with a contraction mapping &lt;math&gt;T\colon X \to X&lt;/math&gt;. Then ''T'' admits a unique [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed-point]] ''x*'' in ''X'' (i.e. ''T''(''x*'') = ''x*''). Furthermore, ''x*'' can be found as follows: start with an arbitrary element ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in ''X'' and define a sequence {''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} by ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''T''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;), then {{nowrap|''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' → ''x*''}}.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Remark 1.'' The following inequalities are equivalent and describe the [[Rate of convergence|speed of convergence]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
d(x^*, x_n) &amp; \leq \frac{q^n}{1-q} d(x_1,x_0), \\
d(x^*, x_{n+1}) &amp; \leq \frac{q}{1-q} d(x_{n+1},x_n), \\
d(x^*, x_{n+1}) &amp; \leq q d(x^*,x_n).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Any such value of ''q'' is called a ''[[Lipschitz constant]]'' for ''T'', and the smallest one is sometimes called "the best Lipschitz constant" of ''T''.

''Remark 2.'' ''d''(''T''(''x''),&amp;nbsp;''T''(''y''))&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''d''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') for all ''x'' ≠ ''y'' is in general not enough to ensure the existence of a fixed point, as is shown by the map ''T'' : [1, ∞) → [1, ∞), ''T''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1/''x'', which lacks a fixed point. However, if ''X'' is [[Compact space|compact]], then this weaker assumption does imply the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point, that can be easily found as a minimizer of ''d''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''T''(''x'')), indeed, a minimizer exists by compactness, and has to be a fixed point of ''T''. It then easily follows that the fixed point is the limit of any sequence of iterations of ''T''.

''Remark 3.'' When using the theorem in practice, the most difficult part is typically to define ''X'' properly so that ''T''(''X'') ⊆ ''X''.

==Proof==

Let ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''X'' be arbitrary and define a sequence {''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} by setting ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''T''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;). We first note that for all ''n'' ∈ '''N''', we have the inequality

:&lt;math&gt;d(x_{n+1}, x_n) \le q^n d(x_1, x_0).&lt;/math&gt;

This follows by [[principle of mathematical induction|induction]] on ''n'', using the fact that ''T'' is a contraction mapping. Then we can show that {''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} is a [[Cauchy sequence]]. In particular, let ''m'', ''n'' ∈ '''N''' such that ''m'' &gt; ''n'':

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d(x_m, x_n) &amp; \leq d(x_m, x_{m-1}) + d(x_{m-1}, x_{m-2}) + \cdots + d(x_{n+1}, x_n) \\
&amp; \leq q^{m-1}d(x_1, x_0) + q^{m-2}d(x_1, x_0) + \cdots + q^nd(x_1, x_0) \\
&amp; = q^n d(x_1, x_0) \sum_{k=0}^{m-n-1} q^k \\
&amp; \leq q^n d(x_1, x_0) \sum_{k=0}^\infty q^k \\
&amp; = q^n d(x_1, x_0) \left ( \frac{1}{1-q} \right ).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Let ε &gt; 0 be arbitrary, since ''q'' ∈ [0, 1), we can find a large ''N'' ∈ '''N''' so that

:&lt;math&gt;q^N &lt; \frac{\varepsilon(1-q)}{d(x_1, x_0)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, by choosing ''m'' and ''n'' greater than ''N'' we may write:

:&lt;math&gt;d(x_m, x_n)  \leq q^n d(x_1, x_0) \left ( \frac{1}{1-q} \right ) &lt; \left (\frac{\varepsilon(1-q)}{d(x_1, x_0)} \right ) d(x_1, x_0) \left ( \frac{1}{1-q} \right ) = \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

This proves that the sequence {''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} is Cauchy. By completeness of (''X'',''d''), the sequence has a limit ''x*'' ∈ ''X''. Furthermore, ''x*'' must be a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of ''T'':

:&lt;math&gt; x^*=\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n = \lim_{n\to\infty} T(x_{n-1}) = T\left(\lim_{n\to\infty} x_{n-1} \right) = T(x^*). &lt;/math&gt;

As a contraction mapping, ''T'' is continuous, so bringing the limit inside ''T'' was justified. Lastly, ''T'' cannot have more than one fixed point in (''X'',''d''), since any pair of distinct fixed points ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' would contradict the contraction of ''T'':

:&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; d(T(p_1),T(p_2)) = d(p_1,p_2) &gt; q d(p_1, p_2).&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
*A standard application is the proof of the [[Picard–Lindelöf theorem]] about the existence and uniqueness of solutions to certain [[ordinary differential equation]]s. The sought solution of the differential equation is expressed as a fixed point of a suitable integral operator which transforms continuous functions into continuous functions. The Banach fixed-point theorem is then used to show that this integral operator has a unique fixed point.
*One consequence of the Banach fixed-point theorem is that small Lipschitz perturbations of the identity are [[Lipschitz continuity#Definitions|bi-lipschitz]] homeomorphisms. Let Ω be an open set of a Banach space ''E''; let ''I'' : Ω → ''E'' denote the identity (inclusion) map and let ''g'' : Ω → ''E'' be a Lipschitz map of constant ''k'' &lt; 1. Then 
#Ω′ := (''I''+''g'')(Ω) is an open subset of ''E'': precisely, for any ''x'' in Ω such that ''B''(''x'', ''r'') ⊂ Ω one has ''B''((''I''+''g'')(''x''), ''r''(1−''k'')) ⊂ Ω′; 
#''I''+''g'' : Ω → Ω′ is a bi-lipschitz homeomorphism; 
:precisely, (''I''+''g'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is still of the form ''I'' + ''h'' : Ω → Ω′ with ''h'' a Lipschitz map of constant ''k''/(1−''k''). A direct consequence  of this result yields the proof of the [[inverse function theorem]].
*It can be used to give sufficient conditions under which Newton's method of successive approximations is guaranteed to work, and similarly for Chebyshev's third order method
*It can be used to prove existence and uniqueness of solutions to integral equations

==Converses==
Several converses of the Banach contraction principle exist. The following is due to [[Czesław Bessaga]], from 1959:

Let ''f'' : ''X'' → ''X'' be a map of an abstract [[set (mathematics)|set]] such that each [[iterated function|iterate]] ''f&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' has a unique fixed point. Let ''q'' ∈ (0, 1), then there exists a complete metric on ''X'' such that ''f'' is contractive, and ''q'' is the contraction constant.

Indeed, very weak assumptions suffice to obtain such a kind of converse. For example if ''f'' : ''X'' → ''X'' is a map on a [[T1 space|''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; topological space]] with a unique [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] ''a'', such that for each ''x'' in ''X'' we have ''f&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''(''x'') → ''a'', then there already exists a metric on ''X'' with respect to which ''f'' satisfies the conditions of the Banach contraction principle with contraction constant 1/2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Pascal |last=Hitzler |first2=Anthony K. |last2=Seda |title=A ‘Converse’ of the Banach Contraction Mapping Theorem |journal=Journal of Electrical Engineering |volume=52 |issue=10/s |year=2001 |pages=3–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case the metric is in fact an [[ultrametric]].

==Generalizations==
There are a number of generalizations (some of which are immediate corollaries).&lt;ref name=Latif2014&gt;{{cite book |first=Abdul |last=Latif |title=Topics in Fixed Point Theory |chapter=Banach Contraction Principle and its Generalizations |chapter-url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-01586-6_2 |publisher=Springer |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''T'' : ''X'' → ''X'' be a map on a complete non-empty metric space. Then, for example, some generalizations of the Banach fixed-point theorem are:
*Assume that some iterate ''T&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' of ''T'' is a contraction. Then ''T'' has a unique fixed point.
*Assume that for each ''n'', there exist ''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that ''d(T&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;(x), T&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;(y)) ≤ c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;d(x, y)'' for all ''x'' and ''y'', and that
::&lt;math&gt;\sum\nolimits_n c_n &lt;\infty.&lt;/math&gt;
:Then ''T'' has a unique fixed point.
In applications, the existence and unicity of a fixed point often can be shown directly with the standard Banach fixed point theorem, by a suitable choice of the metric that makes the map ''T'' a contraction. Indeed, the above result by Bessaga strongly suggests to look for such a metric. See also the article on [[fixed point theorems in infinite-dimensional spaces]] for generalizations.

A different class of generalizations arise from suitable generalizations of the notion of [[metric space]], e.g. by weakening the defining axioms for the notion of metric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Pascal |last=Hitzler |first2=Anthony |last2=Seda |title=Mathematical Aspects of Logic Programming Semantics |location= |publisher=Chapman and Hall/CRC |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these have applications, e.g., in the theory of programming semantics in theoretical computer science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Anthony K. |last=Seda |first2=Pascal |last2=Hitzler |title=Generalized Distance Functions in the Theory of Computation |journal=The Computer Journal |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=443–464 |year=2010 |doi=10.1093/comjnl/bxm108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an added bonus, ''BLA BLA'' users can also access classic NFB animated films, including works by [[Ryan Larkin]], [[René Jodoin]], [[Michèle Cournoyer]] and [[Norman McLaren]]. ''BLA BLA'' was produced for the NFB by [[Hugues Sweeney]].&lt;ref name=Dixon/&gt;&lt;ref name=cr/&gt;

The work stands apart in its emphasis on achieving an emotional response in the viewer/actor. "I wanted to create moods and generate emotions through an interactive piece," Morriset says. "It's quite hard to do dramatic crescendos on a website… I thought it would be an interesting challenge." &lt;ref&gt;Amid Amidi (11 April 2011).

In early philosophies of [[psychology]] and [[metaphysics]], '''conatus''' ({{IPAc-en|k|oʊ|ˈ|n|eɪ|t|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=conatus&amp;nbsp;— Definitions from Dictionary.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/conatus|work=Dictionary.com|publisher=Lexico Publishing Group|accessdate=2008-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latin]] for "effort; endeavor; impulse, inclination, tendency; undertaking; striving") is an innate inclination of a thing to continue to exist and enhance itself.&lt;ref name="Traup"&gt;{{Harvnb|Traupman|1966|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "thing" may be [[mind]], [[matter]], or a combination of both. Over the millennia, many different definitions and treatments have been formulated. Seventeenth-century philosophers [[René Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], and [[Thomas Hobbes]] made important contributions.&lt;ref Name="LeB"&gt;{{Harvnb|LeBuffe|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--These last three constitute the "great early modern classic[s] of ''conatus''" {{Harv|Tuusvuori|2000|p=147}}.--&gt; The ''conatus'' may refer to the instinctive "will to live" of living organisms or to various metaphysical theories of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] and [[inertia]].&lt;ref name="Wolf"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfson|1934|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the concept is associated with [[God]]'s will in a [[pantheist]] view of [[Nature]].&lt;ref name="LeB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shop"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schopenhauer|1958|p=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept may be broken up into separate definitions for the mind and body and split when discussing [[centrifugal force]] and inertia.&lt;ref name="Koll"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kollerstrom|1999|pp=331–356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the term ''conatus'' is that of a series of subtle tweaks in meaning and clarifications of scope developed over the course of two and a half millennia. Successive philosophers to adopt the term put their own personal twist on the concept, each developing the term differently such that it now has no accepted definition.&lt;ref name="Wolf" /&gt; The earliest authors to discuss ''conatus'' wrote primarily in Latin, basing their usage on [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] concepts. These thinkers therefore used "''conatus''" not only as a technical term but as a common word and in a general sense. In archaic texts, the more technical usage is difficult to discern from the more common one, and they are also hard to differentiate in translation. In [[English (language)|English]] translations, the term is italicized when used in the technical sense or translated and followed by ''conatus'' in brackets.&lt;ref name="Leib89"&gt;{{Harvnb|Leibniz|1989|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, ''conatus'' is rarely used in the technical sense, since modern physics uses concepts such as [[inertia]] and [[conservation of momentum]] that have superseded it. It has, however, been a notable influence on nineteenth- and twentieth-century thinkers such as [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and [[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]].

==Classical origins==
[[Image:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]]]]
The Latin ''[[wikt:conatus|cōnātus]]'' comes from the verb ''[[wikt:conor|cōnor]]'', which is usually translated into English as, "to endeavor"; but the concept of the ''conatus'' was first developed by the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] (333–264 BCE) and [[Peripatetics]] (c. 335 BCE) before the [[Common Era]]. These groups used the word {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ὁρμή|ὁρμή]]}} (''hormê'', translated in Latin by ''[[Theory of impetus|impetus]]'') to describe the movement of the soul towards an object, and from which a physical act results.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement of Alexandria]], in SVF, III, 377; [[Cicero]], ''[[De Officiis]]'', I, 132; [[Seneca the Younger]], ''[[Epistulae morales ad Lucilium]]'', 113, 23&lt;/ref&gt; Classical thinkers, [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]] (106–43 BCE) and [[Diogenes Laertius]] (c. 235 BCE), expanded this principle to include an aversion to destruction, but continued to limit its application to the motivations of non-human animals. Diogenes Laertius, for example, specifically denied the application of the term to plants. Before the [[Renaissance]], [[Thomas Aquinas]] (c. 1225–1274 CE), [[Duns Scotus]] (c. 1266–1308 CE) and [[Dante Alighieri]] (1265–1321 CE) expressed similar sentiments using the Latin words ''vult'', ''velle'' or ''appetit'' as synonyms of ''conatus''; indeed, all four terms may be used to translate the original Greek {{lang|grc|ὁρμή}}. Later&lt;!--Did Wolfson give exact date? I wrote down 1700, originally, but that is impossible.--&gt;, [[Telesius]] and [[Tommaso Campanella|Campanella]] extended the ancient Greek notions and applied them to all objects, animate and inanimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Wolfson|1934|pp=196,199,202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First [[Aristotle]], then Cicero and Laertius each alluded to a connection between the ''conatus'' and other emotions. In their view, the former induces the latter. They maintained that humans do not wish to do something because they think it "good", but rather they think it "good" because they want to do it. In other words, the cause of human desire is the natural inclination of a body to augment itself in accordance with the principles of the ''conatus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfson|1934|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval views==
{{Further|Theory of impetus}}
{{See also|Physics in medieval Islam|Scholasticism|Medieval philosophy}}
There is a traditional connection between ''conatus'' and motion itself. Aquinas and [[Judah Leon Abravanel|Abravanel]] (1265–1321) both related the concept directly to that which [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] (354–430 CE) saw to be the "natural movements upward and downward or with their being balanced in an intermediate position" described in his ''[[De Civitate Dei]]'', (c. 520 CE). They called this force that causes objects to rise or fall, "''amor naturalis''", or "natural love".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfson|1934|pp=197,200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 6th century, [[John Philoponus]] (c. 490–c. 570 CE) criticized Aristotle's view of motion, noting the inconsistency between Aristotle's discussion of projectiles, where the medium of [[aether (classical element)|aether]] keeps projectiles going, and his discussion of the void, where there is no such medium and hence a body's motion should be impossible. Philoponus proposed that motion was not maintained by the action of some surrounding medium but by some property, or ''conatus'' implanted in the object when it was set in motion. This was not the modern concept of inertia, for there was still the need for an inherent power to keep a body in motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorabji|1988|pp=227,228}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was strongly opposed by [[Averroës]] and many [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosophers who supported Aristotle.&lt;ref name="Leaman"&gt;{{Harvnb|Leaman|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aristotelian view was also challenged in the Islamic world. For example, [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) seems to have supported Philoponus' views,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sabra|1994|pp=133–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; while he developed a concept similar to [[inertia]].&lt;ref name=salam&gt;{{Harvnb|Salam|1987|pp=179–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of inertia was developed more clearly in the work of his contemporary [[Avicenna]], who conceived a permanent force whose effect is dissipated only as a result of external agents such as [[air resistance]], making him "the first to conceive such a permanent type of impressed virtue for non-natural motion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sayili|1987|p=477}}:
{{quote|"It was a permanent force whose effect got dissipated only as a result of external agents such as air resistance. He is apparently the first to conceive such a permanent type of impressed virtue for non-natural motion."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna's concept of ''mayl'' is almost the opposite of the Aristotelian conception of violent motion and is reminiscent of [[Newton's first law of motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sayili|1987|p=477}}: {{quote|"Indeed, self-motion of the type conceived by Ibn Sina is almost the opposite of the Aristotelian conception of violent motion of the projectile type, and it is rather reminiscent of the principle of inertia, i.e., Newton's first law of motion."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna also developed an idea similar to [[momentum]], when he attempted to provide a quantitative relation between the [[weight]] and [[velocity]] of a moving body.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Islamic intellectual tradition in Persia|author=[[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] &amp; Mehdi Amin Razavi|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1996|isbn=0-7007-0314-4|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Buridan]] (1300–1358) also rejected the notion that this motion-generating property, which he named ''impetus'', dissipated spontaneously. Buridan's position was that a moving object would be arrested by the resistance of the air and the weight of the body which would oppose its impetus. He also maintained that impetus increased with speed; thus, his initial idea of impetus was similar in many ways to the modern concept of [[momentum]]. Despite the obvious similarities to more modern ideas of inertia, Buridan saw his theory as only a modification to Aristotle's basic philosophy, maintaining many other [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] views, including the belief that there was still a fundamental difference between an object in motion and an object at rest. Buridan also maintained that impetus could be not only linear, but also circular in nature, causing objects such as celestial bodies to move in a circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grant|1964|pp=265–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Descartes==
&lt;!--linked from 'René Descartes'--&gt;
{{See also|René Descartes}}
[[Image:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[René Descartes]]]]
In the first half of the seventeenth century, René Descartes (1596–1650) began to develop a more modern, [[materialism|materialistic]] concept of the ''conatus'', describing it as "an active power or tendency of bodies to move, expressing the power of God".&lt;ref name="Piet"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pietarinen|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the ancients used the term in a strictly [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] sense similar to voluntary "endeavoring" or "struggling" to achieve certain ends, and medieval [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophers developed a notion of ''conatus'' as a mysterious intrinsic property of things, Descartes uses the term in a somewhat more [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Garber|1992|pp=150,154}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, for Descartes, in contrast to Buridan, movement and stasis are two states of the same thing, not different things. Although there is much ambiguity in Descartes' notion of ''conatus'', one can see here the beginnings of a move away from the attribution of desires and intentions to nature and its workings toward a more scientific and modern view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaukroger|1980|pp=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes rejects the [[teleology|teleological]], or purposive, view of the material world that was dominant in the West from the time of Aristotle.&lt;!--Steve Nadler refutes the use of "despite" here--&gt; The mind is not viewed by Descartes as part of the material world, and hence is not subject to the strictly mechanical laws of nature. Motion and rest, on the other hand, are properties of the interactions of matter according to eternally fixed mechanical laws. God only sets the whole thing in motion at the start, and later does not interfere except to maintain the dynamical regularities of the mechanical behavior of bodies. Hence there is no real teleology in the movements of bodies since the whole thing reduces to the law-governed collisions and their constant reconfigurations. The ''conatus'' is just the tendency of bodies to move when they collide with each other. God may set this activity in motion, but thereafter no ''new'' motion or rest can be created or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gueroult|1980|pp=120–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes specifies two varieties of the ''conatus'': ''conatus a centro'' and ''conatus recedendi''. ''Conatus a centro'', or "tendency towards the center", is used by Descartes as a theory of [[gravity]]; ''conatus recendendi'', or "tendency away from the center", represents the [[centrifugal force]]s.&lt;ref name="Koll" /&gt; These tendencies are not to be thought of in terms of animate dispositions and intentions, nor as inherent properties or "forces" of things, but rather as a unifying, external characteristic of the physical universe itself which God has bestowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Garber|1992|pp=180,184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes, in developing his First Law of Nature, also invokes the idea of a ''conatus se movendi'', or "''conatus'' of self-preservation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfson|1934|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law is a generalization of the principle of [[inertia]], which was developed and experimentally demonstrated earlier by [[Galileo]]. The principle was formalized by [[Isaac Newton]] and made into the first of his three [[Laws of Motion]] fifty years after the death of Descartes. Descartes' version states: "Each thing, insofar as in it lies, always perseveres in the same state, and when once moved, always continues to move."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blackwell|1966|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Hobbes==
&lt;!--linked from 'Thomas Hobbes'--&gt;
{{See also|Thomas Hobbes}}
[[Image:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Hobbes]]]]

===''Conatus'' and the psyche===
Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679), too, worked off of the previous notions of the ''conatus'' principle. However, he criticized the previous definitions for failing to explain the origin of motion. Working toward this end became the primary focus of Hobbes' work in this area. Indeed, Hobbes "reduces all the cognitive functions of the mind to variations of its ''conative'' functions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Hobbes describes [[emotion]] as the beginning of motion and the [[Will (philosophy)|will]] as the sum of all emotions. This "will" forms the ''conatus'' of a body&lt;ref name="Piet" /&gt; and its physical manifestation is the perceived "will to survive".&lt;ref name="LeB" /&gt; In order that living beings may thrive, Hobbes says, "they seek peace and fight anything that threatens this peace".&lt;ref name="Piet" /&gt; Hobbes also equates this ''conatus'' with "imagination", and states that a change in the ''conatus'', or will, is the result of "deliberation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schmitter|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Conatus'' and physics===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I define [''conatus''] to be motion made in less space and time than can be given; that is, less than can be determined or assigned by exposition or number; that is, motion made through the length of a point, and in an instant or point of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hobbes|1998|loc=III, xiv, 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As in his psychological theory, Hobbes's physical ''conatus'' is an infinitesimal unit of motion. It is the ''beginning'' of motion: an inclination in a specified direction. The concept of ''[[Inertia#Theory of impetus|impetus]]'', as used by Hobbes, is defined in terms of this physical ''conatus''. It is "a measure of the ''conatus'' exercised by a moving body over the course of time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jesseph|2006|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friction|Resistance]] is caused by a contrary ''conatus''; [[force]] is this motion plus "the magnitude of the body".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jesseph|2006|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes also uses the word ''conatus'' to refer to the "restorative forces" which may cause [[Spring (device)|springs]], for example, to contract or expand. Hobbes claims there is some force inherent in these objects that inclines them to return to their previous state. Today, science attributes this phenomenon to material [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]].&lt;ref name="Osler"&gt;{{Harvnb|Osler|2001|pp=157–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Spinoza==
{{See also|Baruch Spinoza}}
Conatus is a central theme in the philosophy of Benedict de Spinoza (1632–1677). According to Spinoza, "each thing, as far as it lies in itself, strives to persevere in its being" (''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', part 3, prop. 6). Spinoza presents a few reasons for believing this. First, particular things are, as he puts it, modes of God, which means that each one expresses the power of God in a particular way (''Ethics'', part 3, prop. 6, dem.). Moreover, it could never be part of the definition of God that his modes contradict one another (''Ethics'', part 3, prop. 5); each thing, therefore, "is opposed to everything which can take its existence away" (''Ethics'', part 3, prop. 6, dem.). This resistance to destruction is formulated by Spinoza in terms of a striving to continue to exist, and ''conatus'' is the word he most often uses to describe this force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allison|1975|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Baruch Spinoza|Benedictus de Spinoza]]]]

Striving to persevere is not merely something that a thing does in addition to other activities it might happen to undertake. Rather, striving is "nothing but the actual essence of the thing" (''Ethics'', part 3, prop. 7). Spinoza also uses the term ''conatus'' to refer to rudimentary concepts of [[inertia]], as Descartes had earlier.&lt;ref name="LeB" /&gt; Since a thing cannot be destroyed without the action of external forces, motion and rest, too, exist indefinitely until disturbed.&lt;ref name="All"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allison|1975|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavioral manifestation===
The concept of the ''conatus'', as used in [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s [[psychology]], is derived from sources both ancient and medieval. Spinoza reformulates principles that [[the Stoics]], [[Cicero]], [[Laertius]], and especially Hobbes and Descartes developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|2006|p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; One significant change he makes to Hobbes' theory is his belief that the ''conatus ad motum'', (''conatus'' to motion), is ''not'' mental, but material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza, with his [[determinism]], believes that man and nature must be unified under a consistent set of laws; [[God]] and [[nature]] are one, and there is no [[free will]]. Contrary to most philosophers of his time and in accordance with most of those of the present, Spinoza rejects the dualistic assumption that mind, [[intentionality]], ethics, and freedom are to be treated as things separate from the natural world of physical objects and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jarrett|1991|pp=470–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; His goal is to provide a unified explanation of all these things within a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] framework, and his notion of ''conatus'' is central to this project. For example, an action is "free", for Spinoza, only if it arises from the essence and ''conatus'' of an entity. There can be no absolute, unconditioned freedom of the will, since all events in the natural world, including human actions and choices, are [[determinism|determined]] in accord with the natural laws of the universe, which are inescapable. However, an action can still be free in the sense that it is not constrained or otherwise subject to external forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lachterman|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human beings are thus an integral part of nature.&lt;ref name="All" /&gt; Spinoza explains seemingly irregular human behaviour as really "natural" and rational and motivated by this principle of the ''conatus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dutton|2006|loc= chp. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, he replaces the notion of free will with the ''conatus'', a principle that can be applied to all of nature and not just man.&lt;ref name="All" /&gt;

====Emotions and affects====
Spinoza's view of the relationship between the ''conatus'' and the human [[affect (psychology)|affects]] is not clear. [[Firmin DeBrabander]], assistant professor of philosophy at the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]], and [[Antonio Damasio]], professor of [[neuroscience]] at the [[University of Southern California]], both argue that the human affects arise from the ''conatus'' and the perpetual drive toward perfection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|DeBrabander|2007|pp=20–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Spinoza states in his ''Ethics'' that happiness, specifically, "consists in the human capacity to preserve itself". This "endeavor" is also characterized by Spinoza as the "foundation of [[virtue]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Damasio|2003|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a person is saddened by anything that opposes his ''conatus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Damasio|2003|pp=138–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Bidney]] (1908–1987), professor at [[Yale University]], disagrees. Bidney closely associates "desire", a primary affect, with the ''conatus'' principle of Spinoza. This view is backed by the Scholium of IIIP9 of the ''Ethics'' which states, "Between appetite and desire there is no difference, except that desire is generally related to men insofar as they are conscious of the appetite. So desire can be defined as appetite together with consciousness of the appetite."&lt;ref name="LeB" /&gt; According to Bidney, this desire is controlled by the other affects, pleasure and pain, and thus the ''conatus'' strives towards that which causes joy and avoids that which produces pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|source= &lt;ref name="Art98"&gt;{{Harvnb|Arthur|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716) was a student of [[Erhard Weigel]] (1625–1699) and learned of the ''conatus'' principle from him and from Hobbes, though Weigel used the word ''tendentia'' (Latin: tendency).&lt;ref name="Art98" /&gt; Specifically, Leibniz uses the word ''conatus'' in his ''Exposition and Defence of the New System'' (1695) to describe a notion similar that of Hobbes, but he differentiates between the ''conatus'' of the body and soul, the first of which may only travel in a straight line by its own power, and the latter of which may "remember" more complicated motions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leibniz|1988|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Leibniz, the problem of motion comes to a resolution of the [[paradox of Zeno]].
Since motion is continuous, space must be infinitely divisible. In order for anything to begin moving at all, there must be some mind-like, voluntaristic property or force inherent in the basic constituents of the universe that propels them. This ''conatus'' is a sort of instantaneous or "virtual" motion that all things possess, even when they are static. Motion, meanwhile, is just the summation of all the ''conatuses'' that a thing has, along with the interactions of things. The ''conatus'' is to motion as a point is to space.&lt;ref name="Gill"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gillespie|1971|pp=159–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with this view is that an object that collides with another would not be able to bounce back, if the only force in play were the ''conatus''. Hence, Leibniz was forced to postulate the existence of an [[Aether (classical element)|aether]] that kept objects moving and allowed for elastic collisions. Leibniz' concept of a mind-like memory-less property of ''conatus'', coupled with his rejection of [[atom]]s, eventually led to his theory of [[Monad (philosophy)|monads]].&lt;ref name="Carl"&gt;{{Harvnb|Carlin|2004|pp=365–379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz also uses his concept of a ''conatus'' in developing the principles of the [[integral calculus]], adapting the meaning of the term, in this case, to signify a mathematical analog of Newton's accelerative "[[force]]". By summing an infinity of such ''conatuses'' (i.e., what is now called [[integral|integration]]), Leibniz could measure the effect of a continuous force.&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt; He defines ''[[Theory of impetus|impetus]]'' as the result of a continuous summation of the ''conatus'' of a body, just as the ''[[vis viva]]'' (or "living force") is the sum of the inactive ''[[vis mortua]]''.&lt;ref name="Duch"&gt;{{Harvnb|Duchesneau|1998|pp=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the work of Kepler and probably Descartes, Leibniz develops a model of planetary motion based on the ''conatus'' principle, the idea of aether and a fluid [[vortex]]. This theory is expounded in the work ''Tentamen de motuum coelestium causis'' (1689).&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt; According to Leibniz, Kepler's analysis of elliptical orbits into a circular and a radial component can be explained by a "harmonic vortex" for the circular motion combined with a centrifugal force and gravity, both of which are examples of ''conatus'', to account for the radial motion.&lt;ref name="Carl" /&gt; Leibniz later defines the term ''monadic conatus'', as the "state of change" through which his monads perpetually advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arthur|1994|loc=sec. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related usages and terms==
[[Image:Nietzsche187a.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]]]
Several other uses of the term ''conatus'', apart from the primary ones mentioned above, have been formulated by various philosophers over the centuries. There are also some important related terms and concepts which have, more or less, similar meanings and usages. [[Giambattista Vico]] (1668–1744) defined ''conatus'' as the essence of human [[society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goulding|2005|p=22040}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also, in a more traditional, [[hylozoism|hylozoistic]] sense, as the generating power of movement which pervades all of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vico|1710|pp=180–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly a century after the beginnings of modern science, Vico, inspired by [[Neoplatonism]], explicitly rejected the principle of inertia and the laws of motion of the new physics. For him, nature was composed neither of atoms, as in the dominant view, nor of extension, as in Descartes, but of ''metaphysical points'' animated by a ''conatus'' principle provoked by God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landucci|2004|pp=1174,1175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (1788–1860) developed a philosophy that contains a principle notably similar to that of Hobbes's ''conatus''. This principle, ''Wille zum Leben'', or "Will to Live", described the specific phenomenon of an organism's self-preservation instinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rabenort|1911|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer qualified this, however, by suggesting that the Will to Live is not limited in duration. Rather, "the will wills absolutely and for all time", across generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schopenhauer|1958|p=568}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900), an early disciple of Schopenhauer, developed a separate principle which comes out of a rejection of the primacy of Schopenhauer's Will to Live and other notions of self-preservation. He called his version the [[The Will to Power (manuscript)|Will to Power]], or ''Wille zur Macht''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Durant|Durant|1963|loc=chp. IX}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Nietzsche criticized Spinoza's ''conatus'' principle, arguing that if true, it would allegedly favour a stagnant Universe. He thought "the opposite is true"; every organism strives not to just to persevere, but to "become more" than it is and to exert its creative strength. Spinoza's conatus, however, was much more alike to such an understanding than to simple self-preservation, as it was akin to empowerment. DIFFICULT TO SOURCE: SEE TALK PAGE--&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] (1856–1939), greatly depended on Spinoza's formulation of the ''conatus'' principle as a system of self-preservation, though he never cited him directly in any of his published works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Damasio|2003|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962|p=398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, [[Henri Bergson]] (1859–1941), developed the principle of the ''[[élan vital]]'', or "vital impulse", which was thought to aid in the [[evolution]] of [[organism]]s. This concept, which implies a fundamental driving force behind all life, is reminiscent of the ''conatus'' principle of Spinoza and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schrift|2006|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Max Scheler]], the concept of ''Drang'' is the centerpiece of [[philosophical anthropology]] and [[metaphysics]].  Though his concept has been important throughout his entire philosophical career, it was only developed later in his life when his focus shifted from phenomenology to metaphysics.  Like Bergson's ''élan vital,'' ''Drang'' (drive or impulsion) is the impetus of all life; however, unlike in Bergson's vitalistic metaphysics, the significance of Drang is that it provides the motivation and driving force even of Spirit (''Geist'').  Spirit, which includes all theoretical intentionality, is powerless without the movement of ''Drang'', the material principle, as well as ''Eros'', the psychological principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Scheler|2008|pp=231–41, 323–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologist]] [[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]] (1911–1988), described a ''cultural conatus'' built directly upon Spinoza's seminal definition in IIIP3&lt;!--reread this book--&gt; of his ''Ethics''. The principle behind this derivative concept states that any given culture, "tends to persevere in its being, whether by dominating other cultures or by struggling against their domination".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Polt|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern significance==
&lt;!--conation--&gt;

===Physical===
After the advent of Newtonian physics, the concept of a ''conatus'' of all physical bodies was largely superseded by the principle of [[inertia]] and [[conservation of momentum]]. As Bidney states, "It is true that logically desire or the ''conatus'' is merely a principle of inertia&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;the fact remains, however, that this is not Spinoza's usage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, ''conatus'' was used by many philosophers to describe other concepts which have slowly been made obsolete. ''Conatus recendendi'', for instance, became the centrifugal force, and [[gravity]] is used where ''conatus a centro'' had been previously.&lt;ref name="Koll" /&gt; Today, the topics with which ''conatus'' dealt are matters of [[science]] and are thus subject to inquiry by the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological===
The archaic concept of ''conatus'' is today being reconciled with modern biology by scientists such as [[Antonio Damasio]].&lt;!--psychology and philosophy. --&gt; The ''conatus'' of today, however, is explained in terms of chemistry and neurology where, before, it was a matter of metaphysics and [[theurgy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Damasio|2003|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept may be "constructed so as to maintain the coherence of a living [[organism]]'s structures and functions against numerous life-threatening odds".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Damasio|2003|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--NEED SOURCE This stability required to maintain life can also refer to the notion of [[homeostasis]] developed by [[Claude Bernard]] which later inspired the field of [[cybernetics]].--&gt;&lt;!--ALSO NEED SOURCE This ''conatus'' is similar to modern notions of the [[libido]] in the [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] sense, and the animal directive of [[self-preservation]].--&gt;

====Systems theory====
The Spinozistic conception of a ''conatus'' was a historical precursor to modern theories of [[autopoiesis]] in biological systems.&lt;ref name=ziemke6&gt;{{Harvnb|Ziemke|2007|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[systems theory]] and the [[sciences]] in general, the concept of a ''conatus'' may be related to the phenomenon of [[emergence]], whereby [[complex systems]] may spontaneously form from multiple simpler structures. The self-regulating and self-maintaining properties of biological and even social systems may thus be considered modern versions of Spinoza's ''conatus'' principle;&lt;ref name=sandy144145&gt;{{Harvnb|Sandywell|1996|pp=144–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the scope of the idea is definitely narrower today without the religious implications of the earlier variety.&lt;ref name=mathews110&gt;{{Harvnb|Mathews|1991|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spurious correlations - spelling bee spiders.svg|thumb|An example of data produced by data dredging, showing a correlation between the number of letters in a spelling bee's winning word and the number of people in the United States killed by venomous spiders.]]
'''Data dredging''' (also '''data fishing''', '''data snooping''', '''data butchery''', and '''''p''-hacking''') is the misuse of [[data analysis]] to find patterns in data that can be presented as [[statistical significance|statistically significant]] when in fact there is no real underlying effect. This is done by performing many [[statistical test|statistical tests]] on the data and only paying attention to those that come back with significant results, instead of stating a single hypothesis about an underlying effect before the analysis and then conducting a single test for it.

The process of data dredging involves automatically testing huge numbers of hypotheses about a single [[data set]] by [[exhaustive search|exhaustively searching]]—perhaps for combinations of variables that might show a [[correlation]], and perhaps for groups of cases or observations that show differences in their mean or in their breakdown by some other variable.

Conventional tests of [[statistical significance]] are based on the probability that a particular result would arise if chance alone were at work, and necessarily accept some risk of mistaken conclusions of a certain type (mistaken rejections of the null hypothesis).  This level of risk is called the [[statistical significance|''significance'']]. When large numbers of tests are performed, some produce false results of this type, hence 5% of randomly chosen hypotheses turn out to be significant at the 5% level, 1% turn out to be significant at the 1% significance level, and so on, by chance alone. When enough hypotheses are tested, it is virtually certain that some will be statistically significant but misleading, since almost every data set with any degree of randomness is likely to contain (for example) some spurious correlations. If they are not cautious, researchers using data mining techniques can be easily misled by these results.

The [[multiple comparisons]] hazard is common in data dredging. Moreover, subgroups are sometimes explored without alerting the reader to the number of questions at issue, which can lead to misinformed conclusions.&lt;ref name="Deming"&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drawing conclusions from data==

The conventional [[frequency probability|frequentist]] [[statistical hypothesis testing]] procedure is to formulate a research hypothesis, such as "people in higher social classes live longer", then collect relevant data, followed by carrying out a statistical [[significance test]] to see how likely such results would be found if chance alone were at work. (The last step is called testing against the [[null hypothesis]].)

A key point in proper statistical analysis is to test a hypothesis with evidence (data) that was not used in constructing the hypothesis. This is critical because every [[data set]] contains some patterns due entirely to chance. If the hypothesis is not tested on a different data set from the same [[statistical population]], it is impossible to assess the likelihood that chance alone would produce such patterns. See [[testing hypotheses suggested by the data]].

Here is a simple example. [[coin throw|Throwing a coin]] five times, with a result of 2 heads and 3 tails, might lead one to hypothesize that the coin favors tails by 3/5 to 2/5. If this hypothesis is then tested on the existing data set, it is confirmed, but the confirmation is meaningless. The proper procedure would have been to form in advance a hypothesis of what the tails probability is, and then throw the coin various times to see if the hypothesis is rejected or not. If three tails and two heads are observed, another hypothesis, that the tails probability is 3/5, could be formed, but it could only be tested by a new set of coin tosses. It is important to realize that the statistical significance under the incorrect procedure is completely spurious – significance tests do not protect against data dredging.

== Hypothesis suggested by non-representative data ==

{{main article|Testing hypotheses suggested by the data}}

Suppose that a study of a random sample of people includes exactly two people with a birthday of August 7: Mary and John. Someone engaged in data snooping might try to find additional similarities between Mary and John. By going through hundreds or thousands of potential similarities between the two, each having a low probability of being true, an unusual similarity can almost certainly be found. Perhaps John and Mary are the only two people in the study who switched minors three times in college. A hypothesis, biased by data snooping, could then be "People born on August 7 have a much higher chance of switching minors more than twice in college."

The data itself very strongly supports that correlation, since no one with a different birthday had switched minors three times in college. However, if (as is likely) this is a spurious hypothesis, this result will most likely not be [[reproducibility|reproducible]]; any attempt to check if others with an August 7 birthday have a similar rate of changing minors will most likely get contradictory results almost immediately.

==Bias==

{{main article|Bias}}
Bias is a systematic error in the analysis. For example, doctors directed HIV patients at high cardiovascular risk to a particular HIV treatment, [[abacavir]], and lower-risk patients to other drugs, preventing a simple assessment of abacavir compared to other treatments. An analysis that did not correct for this bias unfairly penalised abacavir, since its patients were more high-risk so more of them had heart attacks.&lt;ref name="Deming" /&gt; This problem can be very severe, for example, in the [[observational study]].&lt;ref name="Deming" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bmj02"&gt;
{{Cite journal

|pmid=12493654
|issue=7378
|pages=1437–1438}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Missing factors, unmeasured confounders, and loss to follow-up can also lead to bias.&lt;ref name="Deming" /&gt;
By selecting papers with a significant [[p-value|''p''-value]], negative studies are selected against—which is the [[publication bias]]. This is also known as File Cabinet Bias, because less significant p-value results are left in the file cabinet and never published.

==Multiple modelling==

Another aspect of the conditioning of [[statistical test]]s by knowledge of the data can be seen while using the frequency of data flow in a system or machine in the data analysis [[linear regression]]. A crucial step in the process is to decide which [[covariate]]s to include in a relationship explaining one or more other variables. There are both statistical (see [[Stepwise regression]]) and substantive considerations that lead the authors to favor some of their models over others, and there is a liberal use of statistical tests. However, to discard one or more variables from an explanatory relation on the basis of the data, means one cannot validly apply standard statistical procedures to the retained variables in the relation as though nothing had happened. In the nature of the case, the retained variables have had to pass some kind of preliminary test (possibly an imprecise intuitive one) that the discarded variables failed. In 1966, Selvin and Stuart compared variables retained in the model to the fish that don't fall through the net—in the sense that their effects are bound to be bigger than those that do fall through the net. Not only does this alter the performance of all subsequent tests on the retained explanatory model—it may introduce bias and alter [[mean square error]] in estimation.&lt;ref name="Selvin"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples in meteorology and epidemiology==

In [[meteorology]], hypotheses are often formulated using weather data up to the present and tested against future weather data, which ensures that, even subconsciously, future data could not influence the formulation of the hypothesis. Of course, such a discipline necessitates waiting for new data to come in, to show the formulated theory's [[predictive power]] versus the [[null hypothesis]]. This process ensures that no one can accuse the researcher of hand-tailoring the [[predictive modelling|predictive model]] to the data on hand, since the upcoming weather is not yet available.

As another example, suppose that observers note that a particular town appears to have a [[cancer cluster]], but lack a firm hypothesis of why this is so. However, they have access to a large amount of [[demographic data]] about the town and surrounding area, containing measurements for the area of hundreds or thousands of different variables, mostly uncorrelated. Even if all these variables are independent of the cancer incidence rate, it is highly likely that at least one variable correlates significantly with the cancer rate across the area. While this may suggest a hypothesis, further testing using the same variables but with data from a different location is needed to confirm. Note that a [[p-value|''p''-value]] of 0.01 suggests that 1% of the time a result at least that extreme would be obtained by chance; if hundreds or thousands of hypotheses (with mutually relatively uncorrelated independent variables) are tested, then one is likely to obtain a ''p''-value less than 0.01 for many null hypotheses.

==Remedies==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
Looking for patterns in data is legitimate. Applying a [[Statistical hypothesis testing|statistical test of significance]], or hypothesis test, to the same data that a pattern emerges from is wrong. One way to construct hypotheses while avoiding data dredging is to conduct [[randomized]] [[out-of-sample test]]s. The researcher collects a data set, then randomly partitions it into two subsets, A and B. Only one subset—say, subset A—is examined for creating hypotheses. Once a hypothesis is formulated, it must be tested on subset B, which was not used to construct the hypothesis. Only where B also supports such a hypothesis is it reasonable to believe the hypothesis might be valid.  (This is a simple type of [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] and is often termed training-test or split-half validation.)

Another remedy for data dredging is to record the number of all significance tests conducted during the study and simply divide one's criterion for significance ("alpha") by this number; this is the [[Bonferroni correction]].  However, this is a very conservative metric. A family-wise alpha of 0.05, divided in this way by 1,000 to account for 1,000 significance tests, yields a very stringent per-hypothesis alpha of 0.00005. Methods particularly useful in analysis of variance, and in constructing simultaneous confidence bands for regressions involving basis functions are the [[Scheffé test|Scheffé method]] and, if the researcher has in mind only pairwise comparisons, the [[Tukey range test|Tukey method]]. The use of Benjamini and Hochberg's [[false discovery rate]] is a more sophisticated approach that has become a popular method for control of multiple hypothesis tests.

When neither approach is practical, one can make a clear distinction between data analyses that are [[Statistical hypothesis testing|confirmatory]] and analyses that are [[exploratory data analysis|exploratory]]. Statistical inference is appropriate only for the former.&lt;ref name="BerkBrownZhao" /&gt;

Ultimately, the statistical significance of a test and the statistical confidence of a finding are joint properties of data and the method used to examine the data. Thus, if someone says that a certain event has probability of 20% ± 2% 19 times out of 20, this means that if the probability of the event is estimated ''by the same method'' used to obtain the 20% estimate, the result is between 18% and 22% with probability 0.95. No claim of statistical significance can be made by only looking, without due regard to the method used to assess the data.

Academic journals increasingly shift to the [[registered report]] format, which aims to counteract very serious issues such as data dredging and [[HARKing|{{abbr|HARKing|Hypothesizing After Results are Known}}]], which have made theory-testing research very unreliable: For example, [[Nature Human Behaviour]] has adopted the registered report format, as it “shift[s] the emphasis from the results of research to the questions that guide the research and the methods used to answer them”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Promoting reproducibility with registered reports|author=|date=10 January 2017|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|volume=1|issue=1|pages=0034|doi=10.1038/s41562-016-0034}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[European Journal of Personality]] defines this format: “In a registered report, authors create a study proposal that includes theoretical and empirical background, research questions/hypotheses, and pilot data (if available). Upon submission, this proposal will then be reviewed prior to data collection, and if accepted, the paper resulting from this peer-reviewed procedure will be published, regardless of the study outcomes.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ejp-blog.com/blog/2017/2/3/streamlined-review-and-registered-reports-coming-soon|title=Streamlined review and registered reports soon to be official at EJP|author=|date=|website=ejp-blog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods and results can also be made publicly available, as in the [[open science]] approach, making it yet more difficult for data dredging to take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vyse |first1=Stuart |title=P-Hacker Confessions: Daryl Bem and Me |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=25-27 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805142806/https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/p-hacker_confessions_daryl_bem_and_me |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Devarishi''' ([[Sanskrit]]: देवर्षि) means – 'the celestial sage'; it is one of the three categories of [[Rishi]]s, the other two being – ''[[Brahmarishi]]'' (ब्रह्मर्षि) and ''[[Rajarishi]]'' (राजर्षि).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|page=492|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.1.apte.2546753 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rajarishis'' were those [[Kshatriya]] kings who gained the status of Rishi; the difference between a ''Rishi'' and a ''Brahmarishi'' was that of the degree of penance and accomplishment, and their life-span.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rishis &amp; Rishikas|author=Shrikant Prasoon|publisher=Pustak Mahal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SSammk5xUUEC&amp;pg=PT64&amp;dq=devarishi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KKyGVOGKFYSIuASV7oK4Dg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=devarishi&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vayu Purana|Vāyu Purāņa]] (LXI.79-92) tells us that the root - ऋष, from which the word ऋषि (''[[Rishi]]'') is derived, is used in the sense of motion (Knowledge), hearing truth and austerity, and gives the marks of a ''Devarishi''. It states that seers living in the celestial regions should be known as the blessed ''Devarishis'', and also those who are distinguished by their knowledge of the past, present and future and strict adherence to truth; they are the revealers of ''[[Mantra]]'' and by virtue of their ''[[Siddhi]]s'' ('supernatural powers') have unrestricted access everywhere. The same text earlier states that:-

:देवर्षी धर्मपुत्रौ तु नरनारायणावुभौ |
:वालखिल्याः क्रतोः पुत्राः कर्दमः पुलहस्य तु ||

==Prosecution==
Brown was instructed by the CPS in many of the highest profile British criminal cases including prosecution of [[Kevin Hutchinson-Foster]] who passed the BBM Bruni Model 92 handgun to [[Mark Duggan]] shortly before the minicab in which Duggan was travelling was stopped by police in Ferry Lane in [[Tottenham Hale]].&lt;ref name="“Independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kevin Hutchison Foster's Trial |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/mark-duggan-given-gun-just-15-minutes-before-death-8152877.html |accessdate=23 July 2017|publisher=Independent|date=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote box

|quote=
"On August 4 last year a handgun was recovered in Ferry Lane in Tottenham, north London. It had been in the possession of a man named [[Mark Duggan]]. The gun was loaded - it had a bullet in its magazine. The evidence demonstrates that that gun at that scene had been passed to Mark Duggan by this defendant, [[Kevin Hutchinson-Foster]], shortly before the [[minicab]] in which Mark Duggan was travelling was stopped by police in Ferry Lane in Tottenham Hale. There in Ferry Lane Mark Duggan was shot and fatally injured by the police as a result of his possession of that gun and what he was thought to be about to do with it. The firearm was a BBM Bruni Model 92 [[handgun]]. It had been modified so that it would fire 9mm bullets - a lethal firearm as you will hear.
The charge this defendant faces is the supply or transfer of that gun to Mark Duggan."

Brown was also instructed in the inquest of Duggan's death.&lt;ref name="“Inquest in the death of Mark Duggan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Inquest into Mark Duggan's death |url=https://inquestintodeathofmarkduggan.wordpress.com/tag/edward-brown-qc |accessdate=23 July 2017|publisher=Independent|date=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He prosecuted members of the GAS (Guns And Shanks) gang from Brixton&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zac Olumegbon murder: Four teenagers jailed for life |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-16283113|publisher=BBC|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were charged with [[joint enterprise]] murder in a case of "vicious, shocking and sickening case of gang violence outside a school at a time when pupils and staff were gathering at the start of a school day",&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; as well as Ben Hitchcock's murderers, whose actions were described as "the direct result of what was a pitched battle between rival gangs."&lt;ref name="BBCnews"&gt;{{cite news|title=Boy was killed in gang 'battle'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8071814.stm |accessdate=23 July 2017|publisher=BBC News|date=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-defendant Royston Thomas was found not guilty after police detectives relaunched an investigation into the stabbing of 16-year-old Ben Hitchcock.&lt;ref name="“BromleyTimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hitman Jailed For 'Medieval Turf War' Murder |url=http://www.bromleytimes.co.uk/news/wall-of-silence-scuppered-murder-trial-1-579494 |accessdate=23 July 2017|publisher=Bromley Times|date=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===R v Jogee===
In February 2016, Brown was interviewed by [[The Lawyer]] magazine to analyse [[R v Jogee]] that reversed previous case law on [[joint enterprise]] murder,{{Quote box|width=25%|align=left|bgcolor=#E6E6FA|quote="The appeals by these two men have been used by the Supreme Court to address the problem and change the law. Though they might well have kept the law as it was.There will now be very many cases of applications to appeal against convictions out of time. They won’t be confined to murder cases, but to all crime where there was a secondary party, so robberies, sexual crimes. That doesn’t mean every case of so-called joint enterprise will be overturned, the justices have been pretty strong on that, particularly because the Court of Appeal on accepts cases out of time when there has been a serious injustice to a party. From today it doesn’t automatically become a crime if you prove foresight by the secondary party. It’s been found too low a test to be found guilty of a serious crime, but it is still available for a jury to use in deciding whether or not the party intended to encourage or assist the other to do it."|source=— '''Edward Brown QC'''"&lt;ref name="“The Lawyer"/&gt;}} after a recent [[Supreme Court]] ruling indicating that it was not right that a person could be convicted of murder and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment if they foresaw the murder could take place but did not deliver the fatal blow.&lt;ref name="“The Lawyer"&gt;{{cite news |title=R v Jogee Ruling |url=https://l2b.thelawyer.com/kinders-casebook-landmark-ruling-reinterprets-law-of-joint-enterprise/  |accessdate=26 July 2017 |date=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown commented: "It has always been the case that a person who intentionally assists another in a joint crime will be as guilty as the person who physically commits that crime. After the Chan Wing-Siu ruling in 1985, juries have since been directed that if a secondary party foresaw that the principal party might use a knife, for example, with intent to cause harm or murder, then they are guilty of murder as well."&lt;ref name="“The Lawyer"/&gt;
Brown also commented that the judgment in [[R v Jogee]] and [[Ruddock v The Queen]]  will have a significant effect on the prosecution of multi-handed crime, and in particular cases of multi-handed serious violence that sometimes results in death. It will also result in many applications for leave to appeal against conviction out of time.&lt;ref name="“Lexis Nexis"&gt;{{cite news |title=Supreme Court rules on ‘joint enterprise’|url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/lexispsl/corporatecrime/document/412012/5J5P-M4H1-DYW7-W245-00000-00/Supreme_Court_rules_on__joint_enterprise_  |accessdate=26 July 2017 |date=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kevin Hutchinson-Foster===
On 18 September 2012, Brown started prosecuting [[Kevin Hutchinson-Foster]] whose trial took place in Snaresbrook Crown Court.&lt;ref name="“Independent UK"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mark Duggan 'given gun just 15 minutes before death' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/mark-duggan-given-gun-just-15-minutes-before-death-8152877.html%3famp |accessdate=25 July 2017 |date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duggan was shot dead while police officers were trying to arrest him in Tottenham, north London last August.&lt;ref name="“Independent News"&gt;{{cite news |title=Police feared Mark Duggan was about to open fire |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/police-marksmen-who-shot-mark-duggan-dead-feared-he-was-about-to-open-fire-court-told-8152495.html%3famp |accessdate=25 July 2017 |date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury heard that the handgun allegedly supplied by Hutchinson-Foster was found near the spot where Duggan was shot.&lt;ref name="“ITV News"&gt;{{cite news |title=Man guilty of supplying Duggan gun' |url=http://www.itv.com/news/london/2013-01-31/man-guilty-of-supplying-duggan-gun/ |accessdate=25 July 2017 |date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giving evidence, Hutchinson-Foster who was accused of passing the gun to [[Mark Duggan]], claimed Duggan already had a gun.&lt;ref name="“Sky News"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mark Duggan had a gun |url=https://www.news.sky.com/story/amp/tottenham-riots-mark-duggan-had-loaded-gun-10469685 |accessdate=25 July 2017 |date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutchinson-Foster is accused of "selling or transferring" a BBM Bruni Model 92 handgun to Duggan  contrary to the [[Firearms Act 1968]], between 28 July and 5 August 2011.&lt;ref name="“Sky News"/&gt; Hutchinson-Foster was found guilty of suppying gun to Duggan. Chief Supt Dean Haydon, from the [[Metropolitan Police|Metropolitan Police's]] [[Trident Gang Crime Command|Trident]] Serious Crime Command, said: {{quote|The Kevin Hutchinson-Foster trial has primarily been about the supply of an illegal firearm and I welcome the verdict of the jury in this case today.&lt;ref name="“BBC.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mark Duggan shooting: Hutchinson-Foster guilty of supplying gun |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-21176207 |accessdate=25 July 2017 |date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Shanks and Guns gang===
In 2011 Brown prosecuted two south London gangs known as Shanks and Guns, or SG, and the Black Mafia, also known as the Sydenham Boys.&lt;ref name="“NewsShopper"&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Nicholas Pearton another victim of south London gang rivalry? |url=http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/8905191.Is_Nicholas_Pearton_another_victim_of_south_London_gang_rivalry_/ |accessdate=25 July 2017| date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gang members were found guilty of murder of Nicholas "Nick" Pearton who was thought to be their friend. In May 2011 Pearton, 17 year old schoolboy, was stabbed by gangsters being caught up in a clash between two gangs in Home Park, [[Sydenham]].&lt;ref name="“BBC News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Three youths have been found guilty of murdering a 16-year-old boy who was chased through a park and stabbed to death in south-east London |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-12701537|accessdate=25 July 2017 |publisher=BBC |date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearton was attacked when he went to the park to help gangsters who he thought were his friends, after receiving a call from them.&lt;ref name="“DailyMail"&gt;{{cite news |title=Shaking hands in celebration on a bus, thugs who had just hunted down a schoolboy, 16, like a pack of animals and stabbed him to death  |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2022508/Seven-youths-labelled-pack-animals-given-total-74-years-prison-murder-schoolboy-16.html |accessdate=25 July 2017 |publisher=Daily Mail|date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury at the [[Old Bailey]] saw CCTV footage from the [[KFC|Kentucky Fried Chicken shop]] of an injured Nicholas running in and collapsing.&lt;ref name="“EveningStandard"&gt;{{cite news |title=Boy stabbed in heart ‘by killers in school blazers’  |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/boy-stabbed-in-heart-by-killers-in-school-blazers-6552329.html%3famp |accessdate=25 July 2017 |date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prosecuting, Brown commented that Pearton was "the only white-skinned male participant in the incident"&lt;ref name="“Express"&gt;{{cite news |title=A 16-year-old boy was hounded and killed in a park by a gang of schoolchildren, the Old Bailey heard. |url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/221549/Stabbed-boy-was-chased-by-gang/amp  |accessdate=25 July 2017 |date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was chased and eventually killed by a pack of "animals."&lt;ref name="“Express"/&gt; The court heard that hours earlier, Pearton's so-called friend, a member of Black Mafia gang known as the Sydenham Boys, had been involved in a row at school which led to a confrontation in the park between the two gangs.&lt;ref name="“Independent"&gt;{{cite news |title=Three youths face life sentences after being found guilty today of murdering schoolboy Nicholas Pearton |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/youths-face-life-for-boys-murder-2238119.html%3famp  |accessdate=25 July 2017 |date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brown told the jury:
{{quote|Moments after Pearton arrived at the park, his so-called friends had evaporated and he was left to face the attackers on his own.

===Gintare Suminaite===
In January 2017 Brown prosecuted Gintare Suminaite, 29-year-old mother from [[Crawley]], [[West Sussex]], who was charged with murder of her newborn child.&lt;ref name="“Metro 1"&gt;{{cite news |title=‘Tragic’ mother who killed her baby is spared jail |url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/01/31/tragic-mother-who-killed-her-baby-is-spared-jail-6416647/ |accessdate=25 July 2017 |date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prosecuting, Brown told the jury that the child was the product of Suminaite's secret affair with a fellow Lithuanian.&lt;ref name="“Express 1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mum who strangled newborn baby to death with knickers after giving birth WALKS FREE |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/761381/Mum-who-strangled-baby-to-death-walks-free-from-court |accessdate=4 August 2017 |date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suminaite kept her pregnancy hidden from authorities and her long-term partner, with whom she already had a young child.&lt;ref name="“BBC News 1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bognor Regis mother Gintare Suminaite admits killing baby |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-38395332 |accessdate=4 August 2017 |date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended a hearing at Crawley magistrates' court but did not enter a plea to the murder charge.&lt;ref name="“Independent 1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mother charged with murdering newborn baby girl |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/mother-charged-with-murdering-newborn-baby-girl-a6977251.html |accessdate=4 August 2017 |date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Suminaite told police she "most likely" intended to kill her baby, but said she did not know why. At the trial held at the Old Bailey she pleaded guilty to a charge of infanticide.&lt;ref name="“Express 1"/&gt;
The court heard that on April 5, 2016, Suminaite left work early saying she had ‘big problems’ and gave birth in the bathroom at home, with her partner in another room.&lt;ref name="“IifeNews"&gt;{{cite news |title=Woman Who Killed Her Newborn Baby Girl Minutes After Birth Won’t Go to Prison |url=http://www.lifenews.com/2017/02/01/woman-who-killed-her-newborn-baby-girl-minutes-after-birth-wont-go-to-prison/ |accessdate=4 August 2017 |date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her partner found Suminaite lying naked in the bathroom surrounded by blood and a baby bath full of what appeared to be clothes.&lt;ref name="“The Argus"&gt;{{cite news |title=High Court judge may be called in to hear baby death case |url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/14423777.High_Court_judge_may_be_called_in_to_hear_baby_death_case/ |accessdate=4 August 2017 |date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jason Marshall===
In August 2017, Brown prosecuted male escort Jason Marshall who murdered his client Peter Fasoli who he met in December 2012 through gay social networking site called [[Badoo]], where he advertised his services under his "working" name Gabriel. Marshall was arrested after the victim's relative found hidden footage of killing on his [[laptop]].&lt;ref name="Metro.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=Computer repairman ‘terrorised and killed by fake policeman during bondage |url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/07/31/computer-repairman-terrorised-and-killed-by-fake-policeman-during-bondage-6818943/ |accessdate=1 August 2017 |date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Fasoli, a 58-year-old [[IT]] expert,&lt;ref name="Attitude.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=Jason Marshall, 28, is accused of killing IT expert Peter Fasoli during a hook-up before setting his flat alight. |url=http://attitude.co.uk/nephew-found-footage-of-uncles-hook-up-app-murder-two-years-after-believing-he-died-in-fire/ |accessdate=1 August 2017 |date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Northolt]] was terrorised and murdered in 2013 at his own house by Marshall who posed as a policeman.&lt;ref name="London Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |title=Murder suspect caught after victim's relative finds hidden footage of killing |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/31/murder-suspect-caught-victims-relative-finds-hidden-footage/ |accessdate=1 August 2017 |date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the opening day of his trial at the [[Old Bailey]], Marshall was described as a "calculating and determined" killer.&lt;ref name="DailyRecord.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=Jason Marshall, 28, calmly stood over the body of Peter Fasoli and pronounced "in the name of the father, the son and the Holy Ghost" in Latin. |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/no-no-please-court-hears-10907646 |accessdate=1 August 2017 |date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecuting, Mr Brown warned jurors that they would be asked to view the video, which showed the actual killing itself.&lt;ref name="London DailyMail.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=Computer repairman filmed his own death as fantasist, 28, terrorised and murdered him during a bondage session while listening to Classic FM |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4746834/Fantasist-killer-caught-camera-murdering-partner.html |accessdate=1 August 2017 |date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court heard that during sexual roleplay, Marshall stripped the victim and arrested him for “being a spy” and hacking into a government laptop, the court heard.

"The fire, in the early hours of January 7, 2013, had been intended to hide a terrible crime. The fire was set by this defendant in an attempt to disguise what truly happened, and the defendant Jason Marshall very nearly succeeded in escaping justice. Peter Fasoli was killed, intentionally. He had been subjected to a calculated and determined attack, by this defendant whom he invited into his home. In the end he literally fought for his life but by the time Mr Fasoli fully understood the true motives of the person who had tricked his way into his home, it was too late. Desperate as his attempts were, he could do nothing - as you will all too graphically come to understand."

Prosecuting, Mr Brown told jurors:

== Environmental issues ==
The coral reefs are under threat due to environmental issues such as [[overfishing]], pollution, hurricanes, and disease. Since the 1970s, Jamaica's coral reef cover has declined more than 50 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/02/caribbean-coral-reef-lost-fishing-pollution-report|title=Caribbean coral reefs ‘will be lost within 20 years’ without protection|last=Aldred|first=Jessica|date=2014-07-02|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, up to 95 percent of the coral was bleached in some locations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Overfishing ===
Jamaica's coral reefs house 135 different species of fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klomp|first=Kristi|date=2003|title=Condition of Reef Fish on Jamaica's North Coast Signals Late Stages of Over Exploitation|url=http://aquaticcommons.org/13590/1/gcfi_54-49.pdf|journal=54th Gulf and Caribbean Fisheries Institute|pages=592–606}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1995 and 1998, fishing licenses increased by 68 percent for the Montego Bay Marine Park where 69 percent of fishers rely on fishing as their full-time income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bunce|first=L.|last2=Gustavson|first2=K.|last3=Williams|first3=J.|last4=Miller|first4=M.|date=1999-12-01|title=The human side of reef management: a case study analysis of the socioeconomic framework of Montego Bay Marine Park|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s003380050215|journal=Coral Reefs|language=en|volume=18|issue=4|pages=369–380|doi=10.1007/s003380050215|issn=0722-4028}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 on Jamaica's north coast, trap fishermen set 1800 traps which was at least two times above sustainability levels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Fish density dwindled to 9.8 fish per 100 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; between 2001 and 2006.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Status of Caribbean Coral Reefs after Bleaching and Hurricanes in 2005|last=Jones|first=Loureene|publisher=Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network|year=2008|location=Townsville, Australia|pages=73–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overfishing has reduced the herbivorous fish that keep algae populations in check and it has caused a phase shift from coral reefs to algae reefs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Today, algae covers 24 percent of the reefs where corals once stood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By 1960, fish biomass was reduced by 80 percent due to overfishing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Fish that are vital to coral reef survival, such as the Parrot fish, have been driven to near extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iucn.org/content/despair-repair-dramatic-decline-caribbean-corals-can-be-reversed|title=From despair to repair: Dramatic decline of Caribbean corals can be reversed|date=2014-06-30|work=IUCN|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, overfishing has also been linked to the disappearance of the black sea urchin, ''[[Diadema antillarum]],'' which also helped to reduce microalgal presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=September 16, 2009|title=Disaster and Recovery of the Fringing Reefs of North Jamaica|url=|journal=CO2 Science|volume=12|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pollution ===
Sewage pollution has led to [[eutrophication]] which results in an abundance of nutrients for microalgal populations to bloom.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lapointe|first=B.

=== Hurricanes ===
Major hurricane events include Hurricane Allen in 1980, Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, and Hurricane Ivan in 2004.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 2005, there were a record breaking 26 storms recorded that caused 26 events of bleaching in 16 of Jamaica's coral reef sites.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The hurricanes affected 68 percent of Jamaica's coral reefs and 38 percent of those corals later died.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In September 2005, up to 95 percent of Jamaica's corals had bleached, but only 50 percent recovered later.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As a result of the 2005 hurricane, microalgal blooms took over where the corals once were.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Disease ===
The Caribbean's coral reefs have been increasingly becoming diseased by 20 percent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Coral diseases can cause tissue damage or it could even destroy the entire colony.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1980, white-band disease killed 95 percent of the ''Acroporid palmata'' and ''Acroporid cervicornis'' colonies which placed them on the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973|Endangered Species Act]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A 2010 study concluded that sewage runoff in was correlated to the white pox coral disease that destroyed the ''Acroporid palmata'' species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sutherland|first=Kathryn Patterson|last2=Porter|first2=James W.|last3=Turner|first3=Jeffrey W.|last4=Thomas|first4=Brian J.|last5=Looney|first5=Erin E.|last6=Luna|first6=Trevor P.|last7=Meyers|first7=Meredith K.|last8=Futch|first8=J.

{{Green politics sidebar|Related}}

The '''environmental movement''' (sometimes referred to as the '''ecology movement'''), also including [[conservation movement|conservation]] and [[green politics]], is a diverse scientific, social, and [[political movement]] for addressing [[environmental issue]]s. [[Environmentalist]]s advocate the [[sustainable]] management of resources and [[stewardship]] of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] through changes in public policy and individual behavior. In its recognition of humanity as a participant in (not enemy of) ecosystems, the movement is centered on [[ecology]], [[health]], and [[human rights]].

The environmental movement is an international movement, represented by a range of organizations, from the large to [[grassroots]] and varies from country to country. Due to its large membership, varying and strong beliefs, and occasionally speculative nature, the environmental movement is not always united in its goals. The movement also encompasses some other movements with a more specific focus, such as the [[climate movement]]. At its broadest, the movement includes private citizens, professionals, religious devotees, politicians, scientists, [[nonprofit organization]]s and individual advocates.

==History==                                           
===Early awareness===
[[File:StRolloxChemical 1831.jpg|thumb|Levels of air pollution rose during the [[Industrial Revolution]], sparking the first modern environmental laws to be passed in the mid-19th century]]
Early interest in the environment was a feature of the [[Romantic movement]] in the early 19th century. The poet [[William Wordsworth]] had travelled extensively in the [[Lake District]] and wrote that it is a "sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wordsworth|first=William|authorlink=William Wordsworth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idlAAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Guide+through+the+District+of+the+Lakes%E2%80%99&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=sort%20of%20national%20property%20in%20which%20every%20man%20has%20a%20right%20and%20interest%20who%20has%20an%20eye%20to%20perceive%20and%20a%20heart%20to%20enjoy&amp;f=false|title=A guide through the district of the lakes in the north of England with a description of the scenery, &amp;c. for the use of tourists and residents|edition=5th|location=Kendal, England|publisher=Hudson and Nicholson|year=1835|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the environmental movement lay in the response to increasing levels of [[smoke]] [[pollution]] in the [[atmosphere]] during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The emergence of great factories and the concomitant immense growth in [[history of coal mining|coal consumption]] gave rise to an unprecedented level of [[air pollution]] in industrial centers; after 1900 the large volume of industrial [[chemical]] discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste.&lt;ref name="Donora"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ametsoc.org/sloan/cleanair/ |title=History of the Clean Air Act |accessdate=2006-02-14 |first=James R. |last=Fleming |author2=Bethany R. Knorr |publisher=American Meteorological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under increasing political pressure from the urban middle-class, the first large-scale, modern environmental laws came in the form of Britain's [[Alkali Acts]], passed in 1863, to regulate the deleterious air pollution ([[gaseous]] [[hydrochloric acid]]) given off by the [[Leblanc process]], used to produce [[soda ash]].

===Conservation movement===
{{Main article|Conservation movement}}
[[File:Sir William Schlich07.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Students from the forestry school at [[Oxford]], on a visit to the forests of Saxony in the year 1892]]
The modern [[conservation movement]] was first manifested in the forests of India, with the practical application of scientific conservation principles. The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles: that the human activity damaged the [[Natural environment|environment]], that there was a [[civic duty]] to maintain the environment for future generations, and that scientific, empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out. Sir [[James Ranald Martin]] was prominent in promoting this ideology, publishing many [[Epidemiology|medico-topographical]] reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale deforestation and desiccation, and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in [[British India]] through the establishment of [[Indian Forest Service|Forest Departments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stebbing |first=E.P |author-link=Edward Percy Stebbing |year=1922 |title=The Forests of India |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Forests_of_India.html?id=9cAHAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y |volume=1 |pages=72–81 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Madras]] Board of Revenue started local conservation efforts in 1842, headed by [[Alexander Gibson (botanist)|Alexander Gibson]], a professional [[botany|botanist]] who systematically adopted a forest conservation program based on scientific principles. This was the first case of state management of forests in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WDYlNljAP5AC|title=Empire Forestry and the Origins of Environmentalism|first=Greg|last=Barton|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=48|isbn=9781139434607}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the government under [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] introduced the first permanent and large-scale forest conservation program in the world in 1855, a model that soon spread to [[British empire|other colonies]], as well the [[United States]]. In 1860, the Department banned the use [[shifting cultivation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/11/05/stories/2007110550080500.htm|title=A life for forestry|last=MUTHIAH|first=S. |date=5 November 2007|work=Metro Plus Chennai|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2009-03-09|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugh Francis Cleghorn|Dr. Hugh Cleghorn]]'s 1861 manual, ''The forests and gardens of South India'', became the definitive work on the subject and was widely used by forest assistants in the subcontinent.&lt;ref name="Cleghorn"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cleghorn|first=Hugh Francis Clarke |title=The Forests and Gardens of South India |publisher=W.

Sir [[Dietrich Brandis]] joined the British service in 1856 as superintendent of the teak forests of Pegu division in eastern [[Myanmar|Burma]]. During that time Burma's [[teak]] forests were controlled by militant [[Karen people|Karen]] tribals. He introduced the "taungya" system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=KFS |year=1968 |title=Agro-silviculture (the taungya system) |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Agri_silviculture_the_taungya_system.html?id=44smPw8a594C&amp;redir_esc=y |volume=Bulletin no. 1 |publisher=University of Ibadan / Dept. of Forestry }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Karen villagers provided labour for clearing, planting and weeding teak plantations. He formulated new forest legislation and helped establish research and training institutions. The Imperial Forestry School at [[Dehradun]] was founded by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weil |first1=Benjamin |year=2006 |chapter= |chapterurl= |title=Conservation, Exploitation, and Cultural Change in the Indian Forest Service, 1875-1927 |jstor=3986234 |journal=Environmental History |series= |edition= |volume=11| issue =  2 |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gadgil |first1=Madhav |author-link1=Madhav Gadgil |last2=Guha |first2=Ramachandra |author-link2=Ramachandra Guha |year=1993 |title=This Fissured Land: An Ecological History of India |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/This_Fissured_Land.html?id=Jmr9n7aoRR4C&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation of environmental protection societies===
The late 19th century saw the formation of the first wildlife conservation societies.
The zoologist [[Alfred Newton]] published a series of investigations into the ''Desirability of establishing a 'Close-time' for the preservation of indigenous animals'' between 1872 and 1903. His advocacy for legislation to protect animals from hunting during the mating season led to the formation of the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds|Plumage League]] (later the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) in 1889.&lt;ref name="milestones"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/about/history/milestones.asp |title=Milestones  |publisher=''RSPB'' |accessdate=19 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society acted as a [[advocacy group|protest group]] campaigning against the use of [[great crested grebe]] and [[black-legged kittiwake|kittiwake]] skins and feathers in [[fur clothing]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/about/history/index.asp |title=History of the RSPB |publisher=''RSPB'' |accessdate=19 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society attracted growing support from the suburban middle-classes,&lt;ref name="milestones"/&gt; and influenced the passage of the [[Sea Birds Preservation Act 1869|Sea Birds Preservation Act]] in 1869 as the first nature protection law in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=3540740023|title=Coastal Dunes: Ecology and Conservation|author=G. Baeyens, M. L. Martinez|year=2007|page=282|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/humberside/hi/people_and_places/nature/newsid_9383000/9383787.stm|title=Protecting seabirds at Bempton Cliffs | work=BBC News | first=Jo|last=Makel|date=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For most of the century from 1850 to 1950, however, the primary environmental cause was the mitigation of air pollution. The [[Environmental Protection UK|Coal Smoke Abatement Society]] was formed in 1898 making it one of the oldest environmental NGOs. It was founded by artist Sir [[William Blake Richmond]], frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke. Although there were earlier pieces of legislation, the [[Public Health Act 1875]] required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke.

[[File:John Ruskin - Portrait - Project Gutenberg eText 17774.jpg|left|thumb|[[John Ruskin]] an influential thinker who articulated the Romantic ideal of environmental protection and conservation]]
Systematic and general efforts on behalf of the environment only began in the late 19th century; it grew out of the amenity movement in Britain in the 1870s, which was a reaction to [[industrialization]], the growth of cities, and worsening air and [[water pollution]]. Starting with the formation of the [[Commons Preservation Society]] in 1865, the movement championed rural preservation against the encroachments of industrialisation. [[Robert Hunter (National Trust)|Robert Hunter]], solicitor for the society, worked with [[Hardwicke Rawnsley]], [[Octavia Hill]], and [[John Ruskin]] to lead a successful campaign to prevent the construction of railways to carry slate from the quarries, which would have ruined the unspoilt valleys of [[Newlands Valley|Newlands]] and [[Ennerdale Water|Ennerdale]]. This success led to the formation of the Lake District Defence Society (later to become The Friends of the Lake District).&lt;ref name=vc&gt;[http://www.visitcumbria.com/rawnsley.htm "Canon Hardwicke Drummond Rawnsley"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806070246/http://www.visitcumbria.com/rawnsley.htm |date=6 August 2014 }}, Visitcumbria.com, accessed 17 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893 Hill, Hunter and Rawnsley agreed to set up a national body to coordinate environmental conservation efforts across the country; the "[[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]]" was formally inaugurated in 1894.&lt;ref name=t94&gt;"A Proposed National Trust", ''The Times'', 17 July 1894, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation obtained secure footing through the 1907 National Trust Bill, which gave the trust the status of a statutory corporation.&lt;ref&gt;"Parliamentary Committees", ''The Times'', 26 July 1907. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and the bill was passed in August 1907.&lt;ref name=act&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/servlet/file/store5/item740098/version1/National%20Trust%20Acts%201907-1971%20post%20Order%202005.pdf "An Act to incorporate and confer powers upon the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602185018/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/servlet/file/store5/item740098/version1/National%20Trust%20Acts%201907-1971%20post%20Order%202005.pdf |date=2 June 2012 }}, The National Trust, accessed 4 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

An early "Back-to-Nature" movement, which anticipated the romantic ideal of modern environmentalism, was advocated by intellectuals such as [[John Ruskin]], [[William Morris]], and [[Edward Carpenter]], who were all against [[consumerism]], [[pollution]] and other activities that were harmful to the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Peter C. (1988). ''Early Green Politics'', Brighton, Harvester Press, pgs. 15-19, and [[Derek Wall|Wall, Derek]], (1994) ''Green History: A Reader.'' London, Routledge, pgs. 9-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was a reaction to the urban conditions of the industrial towns, where sanitation was awful, pollution levels intolerable and housing terribly cramped. Idealists championed the rural life as a mythical [[Utopia]] and advocated a return to it. John Ruskin argued that people should return to a ''small piece of English ground, beautiful, peaceful, and fruitful. We will have no steam engines upon it . . . we will have plenty of flowers and vegetables . . . we will have some music and poetry; the children will learn to dance to it and sing it.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Back_to_the_Land.html?id=JcvZAAAAMAAJ|title=Back to the Land: The Pastoral Impulse in England, 1880-1914|first=Jan|last=Marsh|year=1982|publisher=Quartet Books|isbn=9780704322769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical ventures in the establishment of small cooperative farms were even attempted and old rural traditions, without the "taint of manufacture or the canker of artificiality", were enthusiastically revived, including the [[Morris dance]] and the [[maypole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1983/1215/121523.html|title='Back to nature' movement nothing new - dates back to 1880|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Walden Thoreau.jpg|thumb|right|Original title page of ''[[Walden]]'' by [[Henry David Thoreau]]]]
The movement in the [[United States]] began in the late 19th century, out of concerns for protecting the natural resources of the West, with individuals such as [[John Muir]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]] making key philosophical contributions. Thoreau was interested in peoples' relationship with nature and studied this by living close to nature in a simple life. He published his experiences in the book ''[[Walden]]'', which argues that people should become intimately close with nature. Muir came to believe in nature's inherent right, especially after spending time hiking in [[Yosemite Valley]] and studying both the ecology and geology. He successfully lobbied congress to form [[Yosemite National Park]] and went on to set up the [[Sierra Club]] in 1892. The conservationist principles as well as the belief in an inherent right of nature were to become the bedrock of modern environmentalism. However, the early movement in the U.S. developed with a contradiction; preservationists like [[John Muir]] wanted land and nature set aside for its own sake, and conservationists, such as [[Gifford Pinchot]] (appointed as the first Chief of the [[US Forest Service]] from 1905-1910), wanted to manage natural resources for human use.

===20th century===
In the 20th century, environmental ideas continued to grow in popularity and recognition. Efforts were beginning to be made to save the wildlife, particularly the [[American bison]]. The death of the last [[passenger pigeon]] as well as the endangerment of the American bison helped to focus the minds of conservationists and popularize their concerns. In 1916 the [[National Park Service]] was founded by US President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Pioneers of the movement called for more efficient and professional management of natural resources. They fought for reform because they believed the destruction of forests, fertile soil, minerals, wildlife and water resources would lead to the downfall of society.&lt;ref name="Culture Wars"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=Roger|title=Culture wars: an encyclopedia of issues, viewpoints, and voices|year=2010|publisher=M.E.

The U.S movement began to take off after [[World War II]] as people began to recognize the costs of environmental negligence, disease, and the expansion of air and water pollution through the occurrence of several environmental disasters that occurred post-World War II. [[Aldo Leopold]] wrote "[[A Sand County Almanac]]" in the 1940s. He believed in a land ethic that recognized that maintaining the "beauty, integrity, and health of natural systems" as a moral and ethical imperative.

Another major literary force in the promotion of the environmental movement was [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]'' about declining bird populations due to [[DDT]], an insecticide, pollution and man's attempts to control nature through use of synthetic substances. Her core message for her readers, was to identify the complex and fragile ecosystem and the threats facing the people. In 1958 Carson started to work on her last book, with an idea that nature needs human protection. Her influence was radioactive  fallout, smog, food additives, and pesticide use. Carson’s main focus was on pesticides, which led her to identify nature as fragile and the use of technology dangerous to humans and other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed: 1945 to the present|last=Hunt|first=Michael H.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780199371020|location=New York, New York|pages=215–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Earth Day 2007 at City College San Diego.JPG|thumb|right|[[Earth Day]] 2007 at City College, San Diego]]
The first [[Earth Day]] was celebrated on 22 April 1970. Its founder, former Wisconsin Senator [[Gaylord Nelson]], was inspired to create this day of environmental education and awareness after seeing the oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara in 1969. [[Greenpeace]] was created in 1971 as an organization that believed that political advocacy and legislation were ineffective or inefficient solutions and supported non-violent action. 1980 saw the creation of [[Earth First!]], a group with an [[Ecocentrism|ecocentric]] view of the world – believing in equality between the rights of humans to flourish, the rights of all other species to flourish and the rights of life-sustaining systems to flourish.&lt;ref name="Culture Wars" /&gt;

In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, several events illustrated the magnitude of environmental damage caused by humans. In 1954, a [[hydrogen bomb]] test at [[Bikini Atoll]] exposed the 23 man crew of the Japanese fishing vessel ''[[Daigo Fukuryū Maru|Lucky Dragon 5]]'' to radioactive fallout. In 1967 the oil tanker {{SS|Torrey Canyon||2}} ran aground off the coast of [[Cornwall]], and in 1969 oil spilled from an offshore well in California's [[Santa Barbara Channel]]. In 1971, the conclusion of a lawsuit in [[Japan]] drew international attention to the effects of decades of [[mercury poisoning]] on the people of [[Minamata]].&lt;ref&gt;Most of the information in this section comes from [[John McCormick (political scientist)|John McCormick]], ''The Global Environmental Movement'', London: John Wiley, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, emerging scientific research drew new attention to existing and hypothetical threats to the environment and humanity. Among them were [[Paul R. Ehrlich]], whose book ''[[The Population Bomb]]'' (1968) revived [[Thomas Malthus|Malthusian]] concerns about the impact of exponential population growth. Biologist [[Barry Commoner]] generated a debate about growth, affluence and "flawed technology." Additionally, an association of scientists and political leaders known as the [[Club of Rome]] published their report ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' in 1972, and drew attention to the growing pressure on natural resources from human activities.

Meanwhile, technological accomplishments such as [[nuclear proliferation]] and photos of the [[Earth]] from [[outer space]] provided both new insights and new reasons for concern over Earth's seemingly small and unique place in the universe.

In 1972, the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] was held in [[Stockholm]], and for the first time united the representatives of multiple governments in discussion relating to the state of the global environment. This conference led directly to the creation of government environmental agencies and the [[UN Environment Program]].

By the mid-1970s anti-nuclear activism had moved beyond local protests and politics to gain a wider appeal and influence.  Although it lacked a single co-ordinating organization the [[anti-nuclear movement]]'s efforts gained a great deal of attention, especially in the [[United Kingdom]] and United States.&lt;ref name=eleven&gt;Walker, J. Samuel (2004).

Since the 1970s, public awareness, [[environmental science]]s, [[ecology]], and technology have advanced to include modern focus points like [[ozone]] depletion, [[global warming|global climate change]], [[acid rain]], [[mutation breeding]], [[genetically modified crops]] and [[genetically modified livestock]]. With mutation breeding, crop cultivars were created by exposing seeds to chemicals or radiation. Many of these cultivars are still being used today. Genetically modified plants and animals are said by some environmentalists to be inherently bad because they are unnatural. Others point out the possible benefits of GM crops such as water conservation through corn modified to be less "thirsty" and decreased pesticide use through insect - resistant crops. They also point out that some genetically modified livestock have accelerated growth which means there are shorter production cycles which again results in a more efficient use of feed. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-31604233|title=Is the world ready for GM animals?|first=Paul|last=Rincon|date=25 February 2015|accessdate=16 August 2018|website=Bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Besides genetically modified crops and livestock, [[synthetic biology]] is also on the rise and environmentalists argue that these also contain risks, if these organisms were ever to end up in nature. This, as unlike with genetically modified organisms, synthetic biology even uses [[base pairs]] that do not exist in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/pdf/synthetic_biology_biodiversity_FB15_en.pdf|format=PDF|title=FUTURE BRIEF : Synthetic biology and biodiversity|date=September 2016|website=Ec.europa.eu|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{Main article|Environmental movement in the United States}}
Beginning in the [[conservation movement]] at the beginning of the 20th century, the contemporary environmental movement's roots can be traced back to [[Murray Bookchin]]'s ''[[Our Synthetic Environment]]'', [[Paul R. Ehrlich]]'s [[The Population Bomb]], and  [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]''. American environmentalists have campaigned against [[nuclear weapon]]s and [[nuclear power]] in 1960s and 1970s, [[acid rain]] in the 1980s, [[ozone depletion]] and [[deforestation]] in the 1990s, and most recently [[climate change]] and [[global warming]].

The United States passed many pieces of environmental legislation in the 1970s, such as the [[Clean Water Act]], the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], the [[Endangered Species Act]], and the [[National Environmental Policy Act]]. These remain as the foundations for current environmental standards.

==Latin America==

After the [[International Environmental Conference in Stockholm]] in 1972 Latin American officials returned with a high hope of growth and protection of the fairly untouched natural resources. Governments spent millions of dollars, and created departments and pollution standards. However, the outcomes have not always been what officials had initially hoped. Activists  blame this on growing urban populations and industrial growth. Many Latin American countries have had a large inflow of immigrants that are living in substandard housing. Enforcement of the pollution standards is lax and penalties are minimal; in Venezuela, the largest penalty for violating an environmental law is 50,000 [[Venezuelan bolívar|bolivar]] fine ($3,400) and 3 days in jail. In the 1970s or 1980s many Latin American countries were transitioning from military dictatorships to democratic governments.&lt;ref name="Latin America"&gt;{{cite news|last=Figdor|first=Carrie|title=Latin America's Environmental Movement Seen as Well-Meaning but Inadequate|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-07-24/news/mn-10121_1_latin-america|accessdate=20 February 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=24 July 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
{{see also|Environmental issues in Brazil#Solutions and policies}}
In 1992, Brazil came under scrutiny with the [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil has a history of little environmental awareness. It has the highest [[biodiversity]] in the world and also the highest amount of habitat destruction. One-third of the world's forests lie in Brazil, and they have the largest river, [[Amazon River|The Amazon]], and the largest rainforest, the [[Amazon Rainforest]]. The people have raised funds to create state parks and increase the consciousness of people who have destroyed forests and polluted waterways. They have several organizations that have fronted the environmental movement. The Blue Wave Foundation was created in 1989 and has partnered with advertising companies to promote national education campaigns to keep Brazil's beaches clean. Funatura was created in 1986 and is a wildlife sanctuary program. [[Pro-Natura International]] is a private environmental organization created in 1986.&lt;ref name=Brazil&gt;{{cite news|last=Brooke|first=Elizabeth Heilman|title=As Forests Fall, Environmental Movement Rises in Brazil|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/02/news/as-forests-fall-environmental-movement-rises-in-brazil.html|accessdate=20 February 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 June 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==
In 1952 the [[Great London Smog]] episode killed thousands of people and led the UK to create the first Clean Air Act in 1956. In 1957 the first major nuclear accident occurred in Windscale in northern England. The [[Torrey Canyon oil spill|supertanker ''Torrey Canyon'' ran aground]] off the coast of [[Cornwall]] in 1967 causing the first major oil leak that killed marine life along the coast. In 1972, in Stockholm, the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment created the [[UN Environment Programme]]. The EU's environmental policy was formally founded by a [[European Council]] declaration and the first five-year environment programme was adopted. The main idea of the declaration was that prevention is better than the cure and the polluter should pay. 1979 saw the partial meltdown of [[Three Mile Island]] in the USA.

In the 1980s the green parties that were created a decade before began to have some political success.. In 1986, there was a nuclear accident in [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]], Ukraine. The end of the 1980s and start of the 1990s saw the fall of communism across central and Eastern Europe, the fall of the [Berlin Wall], and the Union of East and West Germany. In 1992 there was a UN summit held in Rio de Janeiro where [[Agenda 21]] was adopted. The [[Kyoto Protocol]] was created in 1997 which set specific targets and deadlines to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. In the early 2000s activists believed that environmental policy concerns were overshadowed by energy security, globalism, and terrorism.&lt;ref name=Europe&gt;{{cite web |title=Celebrating Europe and its environment |url= http://www.eea.europa.eu/environmental-time-line |publisher=European Environment Agency |accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==

===Middle East===
The environmental movement is reaching the less developed world with different degrees of success. The [[Arab world]], including the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], has different adaptations of the environmental movement. Countries on the [[Persian Gulf]] have high incomes and rely heavily on the large amount of energy resources in the area. Each country in the Arab world has varying combinations of low or high amounts of natural resources and low or high amounts of labor.

The [[League of Arab States]] has one specialized sub-committee, of 12 standing specialized subcommittee in the Foreign Affairs Ministerial Committees, which deals with Environmental Issues. Countries in the League of Arab States have demonstrated an interest in environmental issue, on paper some environmental activists have doubts about the level of commitment to environmental issues;; being a part of the world community may have obliged these countries to portray concern for the environment. Initial level of environmental awareness may be the creation of a ministry of the environment. The year of establishment of a ministry is also indicative of level of engagement. Saudi Arabia was the first to establish environmental law in 1992 followed by Egypt in 1994. Somalia is the only country without environmental law. In 2010 the Environmental Performance Index listed Algeria as the top Arab country at 42 of 163; Morocco was at 52 and Syria at 56. The [[Environmental Performance Index]] measures the ability of a country to actively manage and protect their environment and the health of their citizens. A weighted index is created by giving 50% weight for environmental health objective (health) and 50% for ecosystem vitality (ecosystem); values range from 0-100. No Arab countries were in the top quartile, and 7 countries were in the lowest quartile.&lt;ref name="Arab world"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Djoundourian|first=Salpie|title=Environmental movement in the Arab world|journal=Environment, Development and Sustainability|date=2011-08-01|volume=13|issue=4|pages=743–758|doi=10.1007/s10668-011-9287-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea and Taiwan===
South Korea and Taiwan experienced similar growth in industrialization from 1965-1990 with few environmental controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nongovernmental organizations and environmental protests: Impacts in East Asia (chapter 7 of Routledge Handbook of Environment and Society in Asia)|last = Wu and Wen|first = |publisher = Routledge|year = 2015|isbn = 978-0-415-65985-7|location = London|pages = 105–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Korea's [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] and [[Nakdong River]] were so polluted by unchecked dumping of industrial waste that they were close to being classified as biologically dead. Taiwan's formula for balanced growth was to prevent industrial concentration and encourage manufacturers to set up in the countryside. This led to 20% of the farmland being polluted by industrial waste and 30% of the rice grown on the island was contaminated with heavy metals. Both countries had spontaneous environmental movements drawing participants from different classes. Their demands were linked with issues of employment, occupational health, and agricultural crisis. They were also quite militant; the people learned that protesting can bring results. The polluting factories were forced to make immediate improvements of the conditions or pay compensation to victims. Some were even forced to shut down or move locations. The people were able to force the government to come out with new restrictive rules on toxins, industrial waste, and air pollution. All of these new regulations caused the migration of those polluting industries from Taiwan and South Korea to China and other countries in Southeast Asia with more relaxed environmental laws.&lt;ref name=Asia&gt;{{cite web|last=Bello|first=Walden|title=The Environmental Movement in the Global South|url=http://www.tni.org/archives/act/17458|work=Transnational Institute|publisher=Environmental Justice|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
China's environmental movement is characterized by both the rise of environmental NGOs and policy advocacy and spontaneous alliances and protests that often only occur at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fengshi Wu|date=2009|title="Environmental Activism and Civil Society Development in China: 15 Years in Review,"|publisher=Harvard-Yenching Institute Working Paper Series|url=http://www.harvard-yenching.org/sites/harvard-yenching.org/files/featurefiles/WU%20Fengshi_Environmental%20Civil%20Society%20in%20China2.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental protests in China are increasingly expanding their scope of concerns, calling for broader participation "in the name of the public." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Christoph Steinhardt|author2=Fengshi Wu |date=2016|title="In the Name of the Public: Environmental Protest and the Changing Landscape of Popular Contention in China"|journal=The China Journal|volume=75|pages=61-82|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/684010#fn1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese have realized the ability of riots and protests to have success and had led to an increase in disputes in China by 30% since 2005 to more than 50,000 events. Protests cover topics such as environmental issues, [[land consumption|land loss]], income, and political issues. They have also grown in size from about 10 people or fewer in the mid-1990s to 52 people per incident in 2004. China has more relaxed environmental laws than other countries in Asia, so many polluting factories have relocated to China causing [[pollution in China]]. 

[[Water pollution]], [[water scarcity]], [[soil pollution]], [[soil degradation]], and [[desertification]] are issues currently in discussion in China. The [[groundwater table]] of the [[North China Plain]] is dropping by 1.5&amp;nbsp;m (5&amp;nbsp;ft) per year. This groundwater table occurs in the region of China that produces 40% of the country's grain.&lt;ref name=Asia /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guha|first=Ramachandra|title=The Last Liberal|publisher=Permanent Black|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Center for Legal Assistance to Pollution Victims|The Center for Legal Assistance to Pollution Victims]] works to confront legal issues associated with environmental justice by hearing court cases that expose the narratives of victims of environmental pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Guobin|date=|title=Environmental NGOs and Institutional Dynamics in China|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/asc_papers/341/|journal=The China Quarterly|volume=181|pages=44-66|doi=10.1017/S0305741005000032|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2018}}  As China continues domestic economic reforms and integration into global markets, there emerge new linkages between China's domestic environmental degradation and global econological crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{Fengshi Wu and Richard Edmonds. (2017). "Environmental degradation in China", Chapter 7 in Czes Tubilewicz (ed) Critical Issues in Contemporary China: Unity, Stability and Development (London and New York: Routledge), pp. 105-119.}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparing the experiend of China, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan reveals that the impact of environmental activism is heavily modified by domestic political context, particularly the level of integration of mass-based protests and policy advocacy NGOs. Hinted by the history of neighboring Japan and South Korea, the possible convergence of NGOs and anti-pollution protests will have significant implications for Chinese environmental politics in the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;{Fengshi Wu and Wen Bo (2014) "Nongovernmental Organizations and Environmental Protest: Impacts in East Asia," in Graeme Lang and Paul Harris ed. Routledge Handbook of Environment and Society in Asia: pp. 105-119 (London and New York: Routledge)}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Environmental and public health is an ongoing struggle within India. The first seed of an environmental movement in India was the foundation in 1964 of ''Dasholi Gram Swarajya Sangh'', a labour cooperative started by [[Chandi Prasad Bhatt]]. It was inaugurated by [[Sucheta Kriplani]] and founded on a land donated by Shyma Devi. This initiative was eventually followed up with the [[Chipko movement]] starting in 1974.

The most severe single event underpinning the movement was the [[Bhopal disaster|Bhopal gas leakage]] on 3 December 1984. 40 tons of [[methyl isocyanate]] was released, immediately killing 2,259 people and ultimately affecting 700,000 citizens.

India has a national campaign against [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi Cola]] plants due to their practices of drawing ground water and contaminating fields with sludge. The movement is characterized by local struggles against intensive aquaculture farms. The most influential part of the environmental movement in India is the anti-dam movement. Dam creation has been thought of as a way for India to catch up with the West by connecting to the [[power grid]] with giant dams, coal or oil-powered plants, or nuclear plants.

==Scope of the movement==

[[File:Air pollution by industrial chimneys.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Before [[flue-gas desulfurization]] was installed, the [[air pollution|air-polluting]] emissions from this power plant in [[New Mexico]] contained excessive amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]]]]

[[Environmental science]] is the study of the interactions among the physical, chemical and biological components of the environment.

*[[Ecology]], or ecological science, is the scientific study of the distribution and abundance of living organisms and how these properties are affected by interactions between the organisms and their environment.

===Primary focus points===

The environmental movement is broad in scope and can include any topic related to the environment, conservation, and biology, as well as preservation of landscapes, flora, and fauna for a variety of purposes and uses. See [[List of environmental issues]]. When an act of violence is committed against someone or some institution in the name of environmental defense it is referred to as [[eco terrorism]].

*The [[conservation movement]] seeks to protect natural areas for [[sustainable consumption]], as well as traditional (hunting, fishing, trapping) and spiritual use.
* [[Environmental conservation]] is the process in which one is involved in conserving the natural aspects of the environment. Whether through [[reforestation]], [[recycling]], or pollution control, environmental conservation sustains the natural quality of life.
* [[Environmental health]] movement dates at least to [[Progressive Era]], and focuses on urban standards like clean water, efficient sewage handling, and stable population growth. Environmental health could also deal with [[nutrition]], [[preventive medicine]], [[aging]], and other concerns specific to human well-being. Environmental health is also seen as an indicator for the state of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], or an early warning system for what may happen to humans
* [[Environmental justice]] is a movement that began in the U.S. in the 1980s and seeks an end to [[environmental racism]] and prevent low-income and minority communities from an unbalanced exposure to highways, garbage dumps, and factories. The Environmental Justice movement seeks to link "social" and "ecological" environmental concerns, while at the same time preventing [[de facto]] racism, and classism. This makes it particularly adequate for the construction of labor-environmental alliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a912901178 |title=Uniting to Win: Labor-Environmental Alliances |first= Dan |last=Jakopovich |publisher=Informaworld.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ecology movement]] could involve the [[Gaia theory (science)|Gaia Theory]], as well as [[Value of Earth]] and other interactions between humans, science, and responsibility.
* [[Bright green environmentalism]] is a currently popular sub-movement, which emphasizes the idea that through technology, good design and more thoughtful use of energy and resources, people can live responsible, sustainable lives while enjoying prosperity.
* [[Light green environmentalism|Light green]], and [[dark green environmentalism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rabbi-lawrence-troster/tu-bishvat-moving-from-light-green-to-dark-green-environmentalism_b_2476249.html|title=Dark Green Environmentalism: On Tu Bishvat, Jews Must Move Beyond 'Light' Activism|first=Rabbi Lawrence|last=Troster|date=15 January 2013|website=Huffingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenfuture.sg/2009/04/04/dark-green-and-bright-green-environmentalism/|title=Dark Green and Bright Green Environmentalism - Green Future Solutions|author=Chris Jensen|website=Greenfuture.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt; are yet other sub-movements, respectively distinguished by seeing environmentalism as a [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] choice (light greens), and promoting reduction in human numbers and/or a [[anarcho-primitivism|relinquishment of technology]] (dark greens)
* [[Deep Ecology]] is an ideological spinoff of the ecology movement that views the diversity and integrity of the planetary ecosystem, in and for itself, as its primary value.
* The [[anti-nuclear movement]] opposes the use of various [[nuclear technology|nuclear technologies]]. The initial anti-nuclear objective was [[nuclear disarmament]] and later the focus began to shift to other issues, mainly opposition to the use of [[nuclear power]]. There have been many large anti-nuclear [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] and [[protest]]s. Major [[List of anti-nuclear groups|anti-nuclear groups]] include [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], [[Friends of the Earth]], [[Greenpeace]], [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]], and the [[Nuclear Information and Resource Service]].

==Environmental law and theory==

===Property rights===
Many environmental lawsuits question the legal rights of [[property]] owners, and whether the general public has a right to intervene with detrimental practices occurring on someone else's land.  Environmental law organizations exist all across the world, such as the [[Environmental Law and Policy Center]] in the [[midwestern]] [[United States]].

===Citizens' rights===
One of the earliest lawsuits to establish that citizens may sue for environmental and [[aesthetic]] harms was ''Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission'', decided in 1965 by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.  The case helped halt the construction of a power plant on [[Storm King Mountain (New York)|Storm King Mountain]] in New York State.  See also [[United States environmental law]] and [[David Sive]], an attorney who was involved in the case.

===Nature's rights===
Christopher D. Stone's 1972 essay, "Should trees have standing?" addressed the question of whether natural objects themselves should have legal rights. In the essay, Stone suggests that his argument is valid because many current rightsholders (women, children) were once seen as objects.

==Environmental reactivism==
Numerous criticisms and ethical ambiguities have led to growing concerns about technology, including the use of potentially harmful [[pesticide]]s, water additives like [[fluoride]], and the extremely dangerous [[ethanol]]-processing plants.

[[NIMBY|NIMBY syndrome]] refers to public outcry caused by knee-jerk reaction to an unwillingness to be exposed to even necessary developments. Some serious [[biology|biologists]] and [[ecology|ecologists]] created the scientific [[ecology movement]] which would not confuse empirical data with visions of a desirable future world.

==Environmentalism today==
[[File:BlueMarble-2001-2002.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Composite images of Earth generated by NASA in 2001 (left) and 2002 (right)]]

Today, the sciences of [[ecology]] and [[environmental science]], in addition to any aesthetic goals, provide the basis of unity to some of the serious environmentalists. As more information is gathered in scientific fields, more scientific issues like [[biodiversity]], as opposed to mere aesthetics, are a concern to environmentalists. [[Conservation biology]] is a rapidly developing field.

In recent years, the environmental movement has increasingly focused on [[global warming]] as one of the top issues. As concerns about [[climate change]] moved more into the mainstream, from the connections drawn between global warming and [[Hurricane Katrina]] to [[Al Gore]]'s 2006 documentary film ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'', more and more environmental groups refocused their efforts. In the United States, 2007 witnessed the largest grassroots environmental demonstration in years, [[Step It Up 2007]], with rallies in over 1,400 communities and all 50 states for real global warming solutions.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Many religious organizations and individual churches now have programs and activities dedicated to environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gis.net/~rwe/links.html List of (incomplete) religious environmental organizations.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927003158/http://www.gis.net/~rwe/links.html |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The religious movement is often supported by interpretation of scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creationcare.org/resources/scripture.php|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20021124084848/http://www.creationcare.org/resources/scripture.php|deadurl=yes|title=EEN|date=24 November 2002|archivedate=24 November 2002|website=Creationcare.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[major religious groups]] are represented including Jewish, Islamic, Anglican, Orthodox, Evangelical, Zoroastrian, Christian and Catholic.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Radical environmentalism==
;{{Main article|Radical environmentalism}}

Radical environmentalism emerged from an [[ecocentrism]]-based frustration with the co-option of mainstream environmentalism. The radical environmental movement aspires to what scolar Christopher Manes calls "a new kind of environmental activism: iconoclastic, uncompromising, discontented with traditional conservation policy, at times illegal ..." Radical environmentalism presupposes a need to reconsider [[Western philosophy|Western]] ideas of religion and philosophy (including [[capitalism]], [[patriarchy]]&lt;ref name = ern/&gt;  and [[globalization]])&lt;ref name=jeff1&gt;[http://shiftshapers.gnn.tv/blogs/9306/A_Brief_Description_of_Radical_Environmentalism A Brief Description of Radical Environmentalism], [[Jeff Luers]], ''4 Struggle Magazine'', 26 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes through "resacralising" and reconnecting with nature.&lt;ref name=ern&gt;Manes, Christopher, 1990. ''Green Rage: Radical Environmentalism and the Unmaking of Civilization'', Boston: Little, Brown and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;
Greenpeace represents an organisation with a radical approach, but has contributed in serious ways towards understanding of critical issues, and has a science-oriented core with radicalism as a means to media exposure. Groups like [[Earth First!]] take a much more radical posture. Some radical environmentalist groups, like Earth First! and the [[Earth Liberation Front]], [[Eco-terrorism|illegally sabotage or destroy]] [[infrastructural capital]].

==Criticisms==
{{see also|Environmental skepticism|Anti-environmentalism|Criticism of the environmental movement in the United States}}
Conservative critics of the movement characterize it as radical and misguided. Especially critics of the [[United States Endangered Species Act]], which has come under scrutiny lately, and the Clean Air Act, which they said conflict with private property rights, corporate profits and the nation's overall economic growth. Critics also [[Climate change denial|challenge the scientific evidence for global warming]]. They argue that the environmental movement has diverted attention from more pressing issues.&lt;ref name="Culture Wars" /&gt;

Harper, which reached the Supreme Court first.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The case, ''[[Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections]]'', was decided in March of 1966, making poll taxes unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

After the Supreme Court decision, Butts went on to register black voters in Norfolk, signing up 2,882 "in one six month period."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17401802/iowa_city_presscitizen/|title=Deaths Elsewhere|last=|first=|date=1993-03-12|work=Iowa City Press-Citizen|access-date=2018-02-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=14|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butts, along with Jordan and other community leaders, helped create the Concerned Citizens for Political Education group, which became a powerful political force in local politics in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Butts was appointed the commissioner of the [[Norfolk Redevelopment and Housing Authority]] (NRHA) in 1975.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17402262/daily_press/|title=Black Coalition Outs Longtime Leader|last=|first=|date=1990-06-11|work=Daily Press|access-date=2018-02-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=4|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She would serve on the NRHA for twelve years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/trailblazers/2009/honoree.asp?bio=2|title=Evelyn Butts (1924-1993), Norfolk Principal in a Case to Invalidate the Poll Tax|last=|first=|date=|website=The Library of Virginia African American Trailblazers 2009|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, she was appointed by the governor to the State Board of Housing and Community Development.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Butts was forced into retirement from politics in 1990 when she was ousted as the chair of the Concerned Citizens for Political Education.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Butts died in her home on March 11, 1993.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; She is buried in Norfolk's Forest Lawn Cemetery.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
On November of 1995, Norfolk named a street in her honor.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; On March 27, 1996, the city held a celebration to mark the 30th anniversary of the poll tax repeal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; During the celebration, they honored Butts and other activists involved.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2017, Butts' daughter, Charlene Butts Ligon, published a book about her mother called ''Fearless: How a Poor Virginia Seamstress Took on Jim Crow, Beat the Poll Tax and Changed Her City Forever''.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118202605/http://thenewjournalandguide.com/daughters-new-book-mrs-evelyn-butts-good-local-history/|title=Daughter’s New Book On Mrs. Evelyn Butts, Good Local History|last=|first=|date=18 January 2018|work=The New Journal and Guide|access-date=13 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118202605/http://thenewjournalandguide.com/daughters-new-book-mrs-evelyn-butts-good-local-history/|archive-date=18 January 2018|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New Journal and Guide]]'' called the book "thoughtful and information-filled."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The book provides intimate details of Butts' life and her activism as seen through her daughter's eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pilotonline.com/entertainment/books/article_8495b310-6a45-5386-97b1-00e04f57d919.html|title=A close, illuminating look at Evelyn Butts, civil rights pioneer|last=Smith|first=Erica|date=10 February 2018|work=Virginian-Pilot|access-date=2018-02-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210180423/https://pilotonline.com/entertainment/books/article_8495b310-6a45-5386-97b1-00e04f57d919.html|archive-date=10 February 2018|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EleanorRooseveltHumanRights.png|thumb|[[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (1949)—Article 19 states that "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/ Universal Declaration of Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Orator at Speakers Corner, London, with crowd, 1974.jpg|thumb|Orator at [[Speakers' Corner]] in London, 1974]]
'''Freedom of speech''' is a principle that supports the [[freedom]] of an individual or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, [[censorship]], or legal sanction.  The term "'''freedom of expression'''" is sometimes used synonymously but includes any act of seeking, receiving, and imparting information or ideas, regardless of the medium used.

Freedom of expression is recognized as a human right under article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and recognized in [[international human rights law]] in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR). Article 19 of the UDHR states that "everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference" and "everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice". The version of Article 19 in the ICCPR later amends this by stating that the exercise of these rights carries "special duties and responsibilities" and may "therefore be subject to certain restrictions" when necessary "[f]or respect of the rights or reputation of others" or "[f]or the protection of national security or of public order (order public), or of public health or morals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Article 19 |url= http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |work= International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights |publisher= Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; adopted and opened for signature, ratification and accession by UN General Assembly resolution 2200A (XXI) of 16 December 1966, entry into force 23 March 1976 |date=23 March 1976 |accessdate=13 March 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |archivedate=5 July 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of speech and expression, therefore, may not be recognized as being absolute, and common limitations to freedom of speech relate to [[libel]], [[slander]], [[obscenity]], [[pornography]], [[sedition]], [[incitement]], [[fighting words]], [[classified information]], [[copyright violation]], [[trade secrets]], [[List of food labeling regulations|food labeling]], [[non-disclosure agreements]], the [[right to privacy]], the [[right to be forgotten]], [[public security]], and [[perjury]]. Justifications for such include the [[harm principle]], proposed by [[John Stuart Mill]] in ''[[On Liberty]]'', which suggests that: "the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others."&lt;ref name="van Mill"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2016/entries/freedom-speech/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=van Mill|first=David|date=1 January 2016 |editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the "offense principle" is also used in the justification of speech limitations, describing the restriction on forms of expression deemed offensive to society, considering factors such as extent, duration, motives of the speaker, and ease with which it could be avoided.&lt;ref name="van Mill"/&gt; With the evolution of the [[digital age]], application of the freedom of speech becomes more controversial as new means of communication and restrictions arise, for example the [[Golden Shield Project]], an initiative by Chinese government's [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Public Security]] that filters potentially unfavorable data from foreign countries.

== Origins ==
Freedom of speech and expression has a long history that predates modern [[international human rights instruments]].&lt;ref name="guardiantimeline" /&gt; It is thought that ancient [[Athenian democracy|Athenian democratic principle]] of free speech may have emerged in the late 6th or early 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Origins of democracy in ancient Greece|first=Kurt|last=Raaflaub|first2=Josiah|last2=Ober|first3=Robert|last3=Wallace|year=2007|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=0-520-24562-8|page=65|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The values of the [[Roman Republic]] included freedom of speech and [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Classical Review|volume=57|issue=1|date=March 1943|page=49|publisher=The Classical Association|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=9192DF339924E8290F982D7458AFBC06.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=4343064|author=M. P. Charlesworth|title=Freedom of Speech in Republican Rome|doi=10.1017/s0009840x00311283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concepts of freedom of speech can be found in early human rights documents.&lt;ref name="guardiantimeline"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/feb/05/religion.news | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Timeline: a history of free speech | first=David | last=Smith |date=5 February 2006 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; England's [[Bill of Rights 1689]] legally established the constitutional right of 'freedom of speech in Parliament' which is still in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv |last=Williams |first= E. N. |year=1960| title=The Eighteenth-Century Constitution. 1688–1815 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |oclc=1146699 |pages=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], adopted during the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, specifically affirmed freedom of speech as an inalienable right.&lt;ref name="guardiantimeline" /&gt; The Declaration provides for freedom of expression in Article 11, which states that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly, speak, write, and print with freedom, but shall be responsible for such abuses of this freedom as shall be defined by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hrcr.org/docs/frenchdec.html|title=Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|work=Hrcr.org|publisher=www.hrcr.org|accessdate=25 June 2013|author=Arthur W. Diamond Law Library at Columbia Law School|date=26 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted in 1948, states that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|author=[[United Nations]]|work=UN.org|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=10 September 1948|publisher=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today, freedom of speech, or the freedom of expression, is recognized in international and regional [[human rights law]]. The right is enshrined in Article 19 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], Article 10 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], Article 13 of the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] and Article 9 of the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Andrew Puddephatt, Freedom of Expression, The essentials of Human Rights, Hodder Arnold, 2005, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Based on [[John Milton]]'s arguments, freedom of speech is understood as a multi-faceted right that includes not only the right to express, or disseminate, information and ideas, but three further distinct aspects:
# the right to seek information and ideas;
# the right to receive information and ideas;
# the right to impart information and ideas

International, regional and national standards also recognize that freedom of speech, as the freedom of expression, includes any medium, be it orally, in written, in print, through the [[Internet]] or through art forms. This means that the protection of freedom of speech as a right includes not only the content, but also the means of expression.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

=== Relationship to other rights ===
The right to freedom of speech and expression is closely related to other rights, and may be limited when conflicting with other rights (see [[Freedom of speech#Limitations|limitations on freedom of speech]]).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The right to freedom of expression is also related to the [[right to a fair trial]] and court proceeding which may limit access to the search for information, or determine the opportunity and means in which freedom of expression is manifested within court proceedings.&lt;ref name=Limitstotolerance&gt;{{cite book | last =Brett| first = Sebastian| title = Limits to tolerance: freedom of expression and the public debate in Chile| publisher = Human Rights Watch| year =1999| location =| page = xxv| url = https://books.google.com/?id=KGS_vAYDdtoC&amp;dq=freedom+of+expression+limitations| doi =| id =| isbn =978-1-56432-192-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a general principle freedom of expression may not limit the [[right to privacy]], as well as the honor and reputation of others. However greater latitude is given when criticism of public figures is involved.&lt;ref name=Limitstotolerance/&gt;

The right to freedom of expression is particularly important for [[News media|media]], which plays a special role as the bearer of the general right to freedom of expression for all.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; However, [[freedom of the press]] does not necessarily enable freedom of speech. Judith Lichtenberg has outlined conditions in which freedom of the press may constrain freedom of speech, for example where the media suppresses information or stifles the diversity of voices inherent in freedom of speech. Lichtenberg argues that [[freedom of the press]] is simply a form of [[property right]] summed up by the principle "no money, no voice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sanders |first= Karen |title= Ethics &amp; Journalism |publisher= Sage |year= 2003 |page= 68 |url= https://www.google.com/books?id=bnpliIUyO60C&amp;dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&amp;as_brr=3|isbn= 978-0-7619-6967-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Democracy and social interaction ==
[[File:Free Speech Wall.jpg|thumb|Permanent Free Speech Wall in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], U.S.]]
Freedom of speech is understood to be fundamental in a democracy. The norms on limiting freedom of expression mean that public debate may not be completely suppressed even in times of emergency.&lt;ref name=Limitstotolerance /&gt; One of the most notable proponents of the link between freedom of speech and [[democracy]] is [[Alexander Meiklejohn]]. He has argued that the concept of democracy is that of self-government by the people. For such a system to work, an informed electorate is necessary. In order to be appropriately knowledgeable, there must be no constraints on the free flow of information and ideas. According to Meiklejohn, democracy will not be true to its essential ideal if those in power are able to manipulate the electorate by withholding information and stifling criticism. Meiklejohn acknowledges that the desire to manipulate opinion can stem from the motive of seeking to benefit society. However, he argues, choosing manipulation negates, in its means, the democratic ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion |last=Marlin |first= Randal |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher= Broadview Press |location= |isbn=978-1551113760 |pages=226–27 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=%22free+speech%22+democracy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Barendt]] has called this defense of free speech on the grounds of democracy "probably the most attractive and certainly the most fashionable free speech theory in modern Western democracies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion |last=Marlin |first=Randal |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher= Broadview Press |location= |isbn= 978-1551113760 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=%22free+speech%22+democracy |page=226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas I. Emerson expanded on this defense when he argued that freedom of speech helps to provide a balance between stability and [[Social change|change]]. Freedom of speech acts as a "safety valve" to let off steam when people might otherwise be bent on [[revolution]]. He argues that "The principle of open discussion is a method of achieving a more adaptable and at the same time more stable community, of maintaining the precarious balance between healthy cleavage and necessary consensus." Emerson furthermore maintains that "Opposition serves a vital social function in offsetting or ameliorating (the) normal process of bureaucratic decay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion |last=Marlin |first=Randal |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher=Broadview Press |location= |isbn= 978-1551113760  |pages=228–29 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=%22free+speech%22+democracy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research undertaken by the [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] project at the [[World Bank]], indicates that freedom of speech, and the process of accountability that follows it, have a significant impact in the quality of [[governance]] of a country. "Voice and Accountability" within a country, defined as "the extent to which a country's [[citizen]]s are able to participate in selecting their [[government]], as well as freedom of expression, [[freedom of association]], and [[Freedom of the press|free media]]" is one of the six dimensions of governance that the Worldwide Governance Indicators measure for more than 200 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi2007/pdf/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf |title=A Decade of Measuring the Quality of Governance|publisher=World Bank|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408193105/http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi2007/pdf/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf|archivedate=8 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Against this backdrop it is important that development agencies create grounds for effective support for a free press in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Freedom of expression promotes democracy|url =  http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/alexander-matschke-promoting-free-media-task-development-policy|first = Alexander|last = Matschke|date = 25 December 2014|website = D+C Development and Cooperation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Moon has developed the argument that the value of freedom of speech and freedom of expression lies with social interactions. Moon writes that "by communicating an individual forms relationships and associations with others – family, friends, co-workers, church congregation, and countrymen. By entering into discussion with others an individual participates in the development of knowledge and in the direction of the community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=%22free+speech%22+democracy|title=Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion |last=Marlin |first=Randal |publisher=Broadview Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1551113760|location=|page=229|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal systems sometimes recognize certain limits on the freedom of speech, particularly when freedom of speech conflicts with other rights and freedoms, such as in the cases of [[Defamation|libel]], [[Defamation|slander]], [[pornography]], [[obscenity]], [[fighting words]], and [[intellectual property]]. In Europe, blasphemy is a limitation to free speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brennan |first1=David |title=Calling Prophet Muhammad a Pedophile Not Protected by Free Speech, Court Rules |url=https://www.newsweek.com/calling-prophet-muhammad-pedophile-not-protected-free-speech-court-rules-1189031 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=Newsweek |date=26 October 2018 |quote=The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that calling the Prophet Muhammad a pedophile was not protected by freedom of speech laws.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chase Winter |title=Calling Prophet Muhammad a pedophile does not fall within freedom of speech: European court |url=https://www.dw.com/en/calling-prophet-muhammad-a-pedophile-does-not-fall-within-freedom-of-speech-european-court/a-46050749 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=Deutsche Welle |date=26 October 2018 |quote=An Austrian woman's conviction for calling the Prophet Muhammad a pedophile did not violate her freedom of speech, the European Court of Human Rights ruled Thursday.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lucia I.

[[Censorship of broadcasting in the United States|Limitations to freedom of speech]] may occur through legal sanction or social disapprobation, or both.&lt;ref name="leeds1"&gt;{{cite web | title = Freedom of Speech| work = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| publisher = | date = 17 April 2008| url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freedom-speech/ | accessdate = 29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain public institutions may also enact policies restricting the freedom of speech, for example [[speech code]]s at [[state school]]s.

In ''[[On Liberty]]'' (1859), [[John Stuart Mill]] argued that "...there ought to exist the fullest liberty of professing and discussing, as a matter of ethical conviction, any doctrine, however immoral it may be considered."&lt;ref name="leeds1" /&gt; Mill argues that the fullest liberty of expression is required to push arguments to their logical limits, rather than the limits of social embarrassment.&lt;ref name="Mill 1859 1-5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mill 1859 2-19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ten Cate 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wragg 2015"/&gt;  However, Mill also introduced what is known as the harm principle, in placing the following limitation on free expression: "the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others."&lt;ref name="leeds1" /&gt;

In 1985, [[Joel Feinberg]] introduced what is known as the "offense principle", arguing that Mill's harm principle does not provide sufficient protection against the wrongful behaviors of others. Feinberg wrote "It is always a good reason in support of a proposed criminal prohibition that it would probably be an effective way of preventing serious offense (as opposed to injury or harm) to persons other than the actor, and that it is probably a necessary means to that end."&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite book|title = The Collapse of the Harm Principle|url = http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7037&amp;context=jclc|chapter = Conclusion|author = Harcourt|accessdate = 7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence Feinberg argues that the harm principle sets the bar too high and that some forms of expression can be legitimately prohibited by law because they are very offensive. But, as offending someone is less serious than harming someone, the penalties imposed should be higher for causing harm.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; In contrast, Mill does not support legal penalties unless they are based on the harm principle.&lt;ref name="leeds1" /&gt; Because the degree to which people may take offense varies, or may be the result of unjustified prejudice, Feinberg suggests that a number of factors need to be taken into account when applying the offense principle, including: the extent, duration and social value of the speech, the ease with which it can be avoided, the motives of the speaker, the number of people offended, the intensity of the offense, and the general interest of the community at large.&lt;ref name="leeds1" /&gt;

Along similar lines as Mill, Jasper Doomen argued that harm should be defined from the point of view of the individual citizen, not limiting harm to physical harm since nonphysical harm may also be involved; Feinberg's distinction between harm and offense is criticized as largely trivial.&lt;ref&gt;Doomen 2014, pp. 111, 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, [[Bernard Harcourt]] wrote of the collapse of the harm principle: "Today the debate is characterized by a cacophony of competing harm arguments without any way to resolve them. There is no longer an argument within the structure of the debate to resolve the competing claims of harm. The original harm principle was never equipped to determine the relative importance of harms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/l/law-phil.htm |chapter=Philosophy of Law|author=Kenneth Einar Himma|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpretations of both the harm and offense limitations to freedom of speech are culturally and politically relative. For instance, in Russia, the harm and offense principles have been used to justify the [[Russian LGBT propaganda law]] restricting speech (and action) in relation to [[LGBT]] issues. A number of European countries that take pride in freedom of speech nevertheless outlaw speech that might be interpreted as [[Holocaust denial#Laws against Holocaust denial|Holocaust denial]]. These include Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Lechtholz-Zey, Jacqueline: Laws Banning Holocaust Denial.

In the U.S., the standing landmark opinion on political speech is ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'' (1969),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|395|444|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; expressly overruling ''Whitney v. California''.{{sfn|Jasper|1999|p=32}} In ''Brandenburg'', the [[United States Supreme Court|US Supreme Court]] referred to the right even to speak openly of violent action and revolution in broad terms:{{quote|[Our] decisions have fashioned the principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not allow a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing [[imminent lawless action]] and is likely to incite or cause such action.&lt;ref&gt;''Brandenburg'', at 447&lt;/ref&gt;}} The opinion in ''Brandenburg'' discarded the previous test of "clear and present danger" and made the right to freedom of (political) speech's protections in the United States almost absolute.&lt;ref&gt;''Brandenburg'', at 450–01&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=124}} Hate speech is also protected by the First Amendment in the United States, as decided in ''[[R.A.V. v.

=== The Internet and information society ===
[[File:Sample 09-F9 protest art, Free Speech Flag by John Marcotte.svg|thumb|The [[Free Speech Flag]] was created during the [[AACS encryption key controversy]] as "a symbol to show support for personal freedoms."&lt;ref name="2007-05-01 Badmouth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://badmouth.net/free-speech-flag/ |title=free speech flag |last=Marcotte |first=John |date=2007-05-01 |website=Badmouth |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504012547/http://www.badmouth.net/free-speech-flag/ |archive-date=2007-05-04 |dead-url=no |access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Jo Glanville, editor of the ''[[Index on Censorship]]'', states that "the Internet has been a revolution for [[censorship]] as much as for free speech".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/17/censorship-internet |title=The big business of net censorship |last=Glanville  |first=Jo |date=17 November 2008 |work= The Guardian | location=London|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; International, national and regional standards recognise that freedom of speech, as one form of freedom of expression, applies to any medium, including the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The [[Communications Decency Act]] (CDA) of 1996 was the first major attempt by the [[United States Congress]] to regulate [[pornography|pornographic]] material on the Internet. In 1997, in the landmark [[cyberlaw]] case of ''[[Reno v. ACLU]]'', the [[United States Supreme Court|US Supreme Court]] partially overturned the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Godwin | first = Mike | authorlink =Mike Godwin  | year = 2003 | title = [[Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age]] | publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 0-262-57168-4|pages=349–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge [[Stewart R. Dalzell]], one of the three federal judges who in June 1996 declared parts of the CDA unconstitutional, in his opinion stated the following:&lt;ref name="rowland"&gt;{{cite book|title=Information Technology Law|first=Diane |last=Rowland|pages=463–65|year=2005|isbn= 978-1859417560|publisher=Routledge-Cavendish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Internet is a far more speech-enhancing medium than [[Print media|print]], the [[village green]], or the [[mail]]s. Because it would necessarily affect the Internet itself, the CDA would necessarily reduce the speech available for adults on the medium. This is a constitutionally intolerable result. Some of the dialogue on the Internet surely tests the limits of conventional discourse. Speech on the Internet can be unfiltered, unpolished, and unconventional, even emotionally charged, sexually explicit, and vulgar – in a word, "indecent" in many communities. But we should expect such speech to occur in a medium in which citizens from all walks of life have a voice. We should also protect the autonomy that such a medium confers to ordinary people as well as media magnates.[...] My analysis does not deprive the Government of all means of protecting children from the dangers of Internet communication. The Government can continue to protect children from pornography on the Internet through vigorous enforcement of existing laws criminalizing obscenity and child pornography. [...] As we learned at the hearing, there is also a compelling need for public educations about the benefits and dangers of this new medium, and the Government can fill that role as well. In my view, our action today should only mean that Government's permissible supervision of Internet contents stops at the traditional line of unprotected speech. [...] The absence of governmental regulation of Internet content has unquestionably produced a kind of chaos, but as one of the plaintiff's experts put it with such resonance at the hearing: "What achieved success was the very chaos that the Internet is. The strength of the Internet is chaos." Just as the strength of the Internet is chaos, so that strength of our liberty depends upon the chaos and cacophony of the unfettered speech the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protects.&lt;ref name="rowland" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS) Declaration of Principles adopted in 2003 makes specific reference to the importance of the right to freedom of expression for the "[[Information society|Information Society]]" in stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We reaffirm, as an essential foundation of the Information society, and as outlined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Communication is a fundamental social process, a basic human need and the foundation of all social organisation. It is central to the [[Information society|Information Society]]. Everyone, everywhere should have the opportunity to participate and no one should be excluded from the benefits of the Information Society offers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Klang | first1 = Mathias| last2 = Murray| first2 = Andrew| title = Human Rights in the Digital Age| publisher = Routledge| year = 2005|page=1 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=USksfqPjwhUC&amp;dq=%22digital+rights%22+human+rights | isbn = 978-1-904385-31-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Bernt Hugenholtz and Lucie Guibault the [[public domain]] is under pressure from the "[[commodification]] of information" as information with previously little or no economic value has acquired independent economic value in the information age. This includes factual data, [[personal data]], [[genetic information]] and pure [[idea]]s. The commodification of information is taking place through [[intellectual property]] law, [[contract law]], as well as broadcasting and telecommunications law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Guibault| first = Lucy|last2=Hugenholtz |first2=Bernt| title = The future of the public domain: identifying the commons in information law| publisher = Kluwer Law International| year = 2006| page = 1| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=KJmNGglq0nwC&amp;dq=public+domain&amp;as_brr=3| isbn = 9789041124357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freedom of information ===
{{Main|Freedom of information}}
Freedom of information is an extension of freedom of speech where the medium of expression is the [[Internet]]. Freedom of information may also refer to the [[right to privacy]] in the context of the Internet and [[information technology]]. As with the right to freedom of expression, the right to privacy is a recognised [[human right]] and freedom of information acts as an extension to this right.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite magazine |url = http://freenetproject.org/papers/freenet-ieee.pdf |title = Protecting Free Expression Online with Freenet |magazine = Internet Computing|publisher =  IEEE|last1 = Clarke |first1 = Ian|last2 = Miller|first2 = Scott G.|last3= Hong|first3 = Theodore W.|last4 = Sandberg|first4= Oskar|last5 = Wiley|first5 = Brandon|date = 2002|pages =40–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of information may also concern [[censorship]] in an information technology context, i.e. the ability to access [[Web content]], without censorship or restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pauli|first=Darren|date=14 January 2008|url=http://www.thestandard.com/news/2008/01/14/industry-rejects-australian-govt-sanitized-internet-measure|title=Industry rejects Australian gov't sanitized Internet measure|work=[[The Industry Standard]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120912112920/http://www.thestandard.com/news/2008/01/14/industry-rejects-australian-govt-sanitized-internet-measure|archivedate=12 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of information is also explicitly protected by acts such as the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act of Ontario, in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Sourcebook of Canadian Media Law|pages=232–34|first=Robert|last=Martin|last2=Adam |first2=G.

=== Internet censorship ===
{{Main |Internet censorship |Internet censorship by country}}
The concept of [[freedom of information]] has emerged in response to state sponsored censorship, monitoring and surveillance of the internet. Internet censorship includes the control or suppression of the publishing or accessing of information on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 =Deibert|first1 = Robert|last2= Palfrey|first2= John G|last3 = Rohozinski|first3 = Rafal| last4= Zittrain|first4 = Jonathan|date =2008|title=Access denied: the practice and policy of global Internet filtering |publisher = MIT Press|isbn = 978-0262541961}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Global Internet Freedom Consortium]] claims to remove blocks to the "free flow of information" for what they term "closed societies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetfreedom.org/mission.html|title=Our Mission|publisher=Global Internet Freedom Consortium|accessdate=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927182331/http://www.internetfreedom.org/mission.html|archivedate=27 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Reporters without Borders]] (RWB) "internet enemy list" the following states engage in pervasive internet censorship: [[China]], [[Cuba]], [[Iran]], [[Myanmar]]/[[Burma]], [[North Korea]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Syria]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=RWBEnemies&gt;{{cite web|url = http://march12.rsf.org/i/Internet_Enemies.pdf |title =Internet Enemies|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315002153/http://march12.rsf.org/i/Internet_Enemies.pdf |deadurl = yes|archivedate=15 March 2011 |publisher = Reporters Without Borders |location= Paris|date =  March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely publicized example of internet censorship is the "[[Great Firewall of China]]" (in reference both to its role as a [[firewall (networking)|network firewall]] and to the ancient [[Great Wall of China]]). The system blocks content by preventing [[IP address]]es from being routed through and consists of standard firewall and [[proxy server]]s at the [[Internet]] [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]]. The system also selectively engages in [[DNS poisoning]] when particular sites are requested. The government does not appear to be systematically examining Internet content, as this appears to be technically impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,,1713317,00.html|author=Watts, Jonathan |date=20 February 2006 |title=War of the words |publisher=[[The Guardian]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China]] is conducted under a wide variety of laws and administrative regulations, including more than sixty regulations directed at the Internet.

Before the invention of the [[printing press]] a written work, once created, could only be physically multiplied by highly laborious and error-prone manual copying. No elaborate system of censorship and control over [[scribes]] existed, who until the 14th century were restricted to religious institutions, and their works rarely caused wider controversy. In response to the [[printing press]], and the ''[[heresies]]'' it allowed to spread, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] moved to impose censorship.&lt;ref name="de Sola Pool 1983 14"&gt;{{Cite book | last = de Sola Pool| first = Ithiel | title = Technologies of freedom| publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 1983 | page = 14 | url = https://www.google.com/books?id=BzLXGUxV4CkC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=%22Censorship+and+Control%22#v=onepage| isbn = 978-0-674-87233-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Printing allowed for multiple exact copies of a work, leading to a more rapid and widespread circulation of ideas and information (see [[print culture]]).&lt;ref name="MacQueen 2007 34"&gt;{{Cite book | last = MacQueen | first = Hector L |last2=Waelde |first2=Charlotte |last3=Laurie |first3=Graeme T | title = Contemporary Intellectual Property: Law and Policy | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2007 | page = 34 | url = https://www.google.com/books?id=_Iwcn4pT0OoC&amp;dq=contemporary+intellectual+property | isbn = 978-0-19-926339-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of [[copyright law]] in most European countries lie in efforts by the Roman Catholic Church and governments to regulate and control the output of printers.&lt;ref name="MacQueen 2007 34" /&gt;

The Index Expurgatorius was administered by the [[Roman Inquisition]], but enforced by local government authorities, and went through 300 editions. Amongst others, it banned or [[censored]] books written by [[René Descartes]], [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Galileo Galilei]], [[David Hume]], [[John Locke]], [[Daniel Defoe]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Castillo| first = Anastasia| title = Banned Books: Censorship in Eighteenth-Century England| publisher = GRIN Verlag| year = 2010| page = 12| url = https://books.google.com/?id=CqaAGfL-IQIC&amp;dq=Giordano+Bruno+censorship| isbn = 978-3-640-71688-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; While governments and church encouraged printing in many ways because it allowed for the dissemination of [[Bible]]s and government information, works of dissent and criticism could also circulate rapidly.

Milton's defense of freedom of expression was grounded in a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] worldview and he thought that the English people had the mission to work out the truth of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], which would lead to the [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] of all people. But Milton also articulated the main strands of future discussions about freedom of expression. By defining the scope of freedom of expression and of "harmful" speech Milton argued against the principle of pre-censorship and in favor of tolerance for a wide range of views.&lt;ref name="Sanders 2003 66" /&gt; Freedom of the press ceased being regulated in England in 1695 when the Licensing Order of 1643 was allowed to expire after the introduction of the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] shortly after the Glorious Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/gordon-rayner/8812486/Leveson-Inquiry-British-press-freedom-is-a-model-for-the-world-editor-tells-inquiry.html | title=Leveson Inquiry: British press freedom is a model for the world, editor tells inquiry | publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited | work=The Telegraph | date=7 October 2011 | accessdate=9 May 2018 | author=Rayner, Gordon | quote=Mr Rusbridger said: “When people talk about licensing journalists or newspapers the instinct should be to refer them to history.

Several MPs now want to replace this with a principle whereby MPs define the parameters under which the press operates – and “work together”. It is a hideous idea that must be resisted. The last time this happened was under the Licensing Order of 1643, which was allowed to expire in 1695 after the introduction of the 1688 Bill of Rights shortly after the Glorious Revolution. As I wrote in my Daily Telegraph column  yesterday, it’s amazing that so many Tory MPs should want to turn the clock back 300 years.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of publications like the ''[[Tatler (1709)|Tatler]]'' (1709) and the ''[[The Spectator (1711)|Spectator]]'' (1711) are given credit for creating a 'bourgeois public sphere' in England that allowed for a free exchange of ideas and information.

As the "menace" of printing spread, more governments attempted to centralize control.&lt;ref name="de Sola Pool 1983 15"&gt;{{Cite book | last = de Sola Pool| first = Ithiel | title = Technologies of freedom| publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 1983 | page = 15 | url = https://www.google.com/books?id=BzLXGUxV4CkC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=36#v=onepage| isbn = 978-0-674-87233-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[French crown]] repressed printing and the printer [[Etienne Dolet]] was burned at the stake in 1546. In 1557 the [[British Crown]] thought to stem the flow of seditious and heretical books by chartering the [[Stationers' Company]]. The right to print was limited to the members of that guild, and thirty years later the [[Star Chamber]] was chartered to curtail the "greate enormities and abuses" of "dyvers contentyous and disorderlye persons professinge the arte or mystere of pryntinge or selling of books." The right to print was restricted to two universities and to the 21 existing printers in the [[city of London]], which had 53 [[printing presses]]. As the British crown took control of type founding in 1637 printers fled to the [[Netherlands]]. Confrontation with authority made printers radical and rebellious, with 800 authors, printers and book dealers being incarcerated in the [[Bastille]] in Paris before it was stormed in 1789.&lt;ref name="de Sola Pool 1983 15" /&gt;

A succession of English thinkers was at the forefront of early discussion on a right to freedom of expression, among them [[John Milton]] (1608–74) and [[John Locke]] (1632–1704). Locke established the [[individual]] as the unit of value and the bearer of rights to [[right to life|life]], [[right to liberty|liberty]], [[right to property|property]] and the [[pursuit of happiness]]. However Locke's ideas evolved primarily around the concept of the right to seek salvation for one's soul, and was thus primarily concerned with theological matters. Locke neither supported a universal toleration of peoples nor freedom of speech; according to his ideas, some groups, such as atheists, should not be allowed.&lt;ref name="jonathanisrael"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Israel|title=Radical Enlightenment|publisher=Oxford University Press|year= 2002|pages= 265–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the second half of the 17th century philosophers on the European continent like [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Pierre Bayle]] developed ideas encompassing a more universal aspect freedom of speech and toleration than the early English philosophers.&lt;ref name="jonathanisrael" /&gt; By the 18th century the idea of freedom of speech was being discussed by thinkers all over the Western world, especially by French [[philosophes]] like [[Denis Diderot]], [[Baron d'Holbach]] and [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Israel|title=Enlightenment Contested|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2006|pages= 155ff, 781ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea began to be incorporated in political theory both in theory as well as practice; the first state edict in history proclaiming complete freedom of speech was the one issued December 4, 1770 in [[Denmark-Norway]] during the regency of [[Johann Friedrich Struensee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Israel|title=A Revolution of the Mind|publisher= Princeton University Press|year= 2010|page= 76}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Struensee himself imposed some minor limitations to this edict in October 7, 1771, and it was even further limited after the fall of Struensee with legislation introduced in 1773, although censorship was not reintroduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=H. Arnold Barton|title=Scandinavia in the Revolutionary Era – 1760–1815|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year= 1986|pages= 90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873) argued that without human freedom there can be no progress in science, law or politics, which according to Mill required free discussion of opinion. Mill's ''[[On Liberty]]'', published in 1859 became a classic defence of the right to freedom of expression.&lt;ref name="Sanders 2003 66" /&gt; Mill argued that [[truth]] drives out falsity, therefore the free expression of ideas, true or false, should not be feared. Truth is not stable or fixed, but evolves with time. Mill argued that much of what we once considered true has turned out false. Therefore, views should not be prohibited for their apparent falsity. Mill also argued that free discussion is necessary to prevent the "deep slumber of a decided opinion". Discussion would drive the onwards march of truth and by considering false views the basis of true views could be re-affirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sanders| first = Karen| title = Ethics &amp; Journalism| publisher = Sage| year = 2003| page = 67| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=bnpliIUyO60C&amp;dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&amp;as_brr=3| isbn = 978-0-7619-6967-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Mill argued that an opinion only carries intrinsic value to the owner of that opinion, thus silencing the expression of that opinion is an injustice to a basic human right. For Mill, the only instance in which speech can be justifiably suppressed is in order to prevent harm from a clear and direct threat. Neither economic or moral implications, nor the speakers own well-being would justify suppression of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Warburton| first = Nigel| title = Free Speech: A Very Short Introduction| publisher = Oxford| year = 2009| pages = 24–29| url = https://books.google.com/?id=nJ0uf50ZtzsC&amp;printsec=frontcover| isbn = 978-0-19-923235-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Evelyn Beatrice Hall]]'s biography of [[Voltaire]], she coined the following sentence to illustrate Voltaire's beliefs: "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."&lt;ref name="paulboller" /&gt; Hall's quote is frequently cited to describe the principle of freedom of speech.&lt;ref name="paulboller"&gt;{{cite book |last=Boller, Jr. |first=Paul F. |authorlink= |author2=George, John |title=They Never Said It: A Book of Fake Quotes, Misquotes, and Misleading Attributions |year=1989 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |pages=124–26 |isbn=0-19-505541-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th Century, Noam Chomsky states that: "If you believe in freedom of speech, you believe in freedom of speech for views you don't like. Dictators such as [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], were in favor of freedom of speech for views they liked only. If you're in favor of freedom of speech, that means you're in favor of freedom of speech precisely for views you despise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV Media|title=[[Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media]]|year=1992|people= Mark Achbar and Peter Wintonick}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lee Bollinger]] argues that "the free speech principle involves a special act of carving out one area of social interaction for extraordinary self-restraint, the purpose of which is to develop and demonstrate a social capacity to control feelings evoked by a host of social encounters." Bollinger argues that [[Toleration|tolerance]] is a desirable value, if not essential. However, critics argue that society should be concerned by those who directly deny or advocate, for example, [[genocide]] (see limitations above).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Lee C.|last =  Bollinger|title=The Tolerant Society: Freedom of Speech and Extremist Speech in America|publisher=Oxford University Press|location= |year= 1986|isbn = 0195040007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1928 novel ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' by [[D. H. Lawrence]] was banned for [[obscenity]] in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and Canada. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, it was the subject of landmark court rulings which saw the ban for obscenity overturned. Dominic Sandbrook of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' in the UK wrote, "Now that public obscenity has become commonplace, it is hard to recapture the atmosphere of a society that saw fit to ban books such as ''Lady Chatterley’s Lover'' because it was likely to “deprave and corrupt” its readers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/8066784/Lady-Chatterley-trial-50-years-on.-The-filthy-book-that-set-us-free-and-fettered-us-forever.html |title= Lady Chatterley trial - 50 years on.

Now that public obscenity has become commonplace, it is hard to recapture the atmosphere of a society that saw fit to ban books such as Lady Chatterley’s Lover because it was likely to “deprave and corrupt” its readers. Although only half a century separates us from Harold Macmillan’s Britain, the world of 1960 can easily seem like ancient history. In a Britain when men still wore heavy grey suits, working women were still relatively rare and the Empire was still, just, a going concern, D H Lawrence’s book was merely one of many banned because of its threat to public morality.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Kaplan of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated the overturning of the obscenity laws "set off an explosion of free speech" in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/opinion/21kaplan.html |title= The Day Obscenity Became Art |work= The New York Times |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=May 9, 2018 |author= Kaplan, Fred |quote=TODAY is the 50th anniversary of the court ruling that overturned America’s obscenity laws, setting off an explosion of free speech — and also, in retrospect, splashing cold water on the idea, much discussed during Sonia Sotomayor’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings, that judges are “umpires” rather than agents of social change.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to freedom of expression has been interpreted to include the right to take and publish photographs of strangers in public areas without their permission or knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.newseuminstitute.org/first-amendment-center/topics/freedom-of-the-press/photography-first-amendment/ |title= Photography &amp; First Amendment |last= Kenworthy |first= Bill |date = April 2012|website = Newseum Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.aclu.org/issues/free-speech/photographers-rights | title=Photographers' Rights | publisher=American Civil Liberties Union | accessdate=9 May 2018 | work=aclu.org | quote=Taking photographs and video of things that are plainly visible in public spaces is a constitutional right—and that includes transportation facilities, the outside of federal buildings, and police and other government officials carrying out their duties.

Other people have ended up in FBI databases for taking innocuous photographs of public places.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, a '''fusion category''' is a [[category (mathematics)|category]] that is [[rigid category|rigid]], [[semisimple category|semisimple]], [[linear category|&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-linear]], [[monoidal category|monoidal]] and has only finitely many isomorphism classes of [[Glossary_of_category_theory#simple_object|simple objects]], such that the monoidal unit is simple. If the ground field &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is algebraically closed, then the latter is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}(1,1)\cong k&lt;/math&gt; by [[Schur's lemma]].

{{Refimprove|date=November 2015}}

The '''GNC hypothesis''' or '''GNC-SNS primeval genetic code hypothesis''' refers to a hypothesis about the origin of genes.  It suggests the universal genetic code originated not from a three-amino acid system, but from a four-amino acid system. It is this GNC code encoding [GADV]-proteins which is the most primitive genetic code. This hypothesis was first proposed by [[Kenji Ikehara]] at Nara Women's University.

==Details==
While almost all of the [[organism]]s on Earth share the universal [[genetic code]], in the GNC hypothesis it is argued that two primeval genetic codes preceded the present genetic code as follows:

* First, there emerged [[Guanine|G]]N[[Cytosine|C]] primeval genetic codes involving 4 [[Genetic code|codons]] (GGC, GCC, G[[Adenine|A]]C and G[[Uracil|U]]C), which code 4 GADV-[[amino acid]]s ([[glycine]], [[alanine]], [[aspartic acid]] and [[valine]]).
* Second, GNC code evolved to SNS primeval genetic codes involving 16 codons (GGC, GGG, GCC, GCG, GAC, GAG, GUC, GUG, CUC, GUG, CCC, CCG, CAC, CAG, CGC and CGG), which code 10 amino acids (glycine, alanine, aspartic acid, valine, [[glutamic acid]], [[leucine]], [[proline]], [[histidine]], [[glutamine]], [[arginine]]).

The GNC hypothesis is based on the following facts:

* [[Protein]]s composed of GADV-amino acids coded by GNC primeval genetic code can form four fundamental structures found in proteins in present organisms, namely, [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] and [[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]] structures, [[Alpha helix|α-helices]], [[Beta sheet|β-sheets]], and [[turn (biochemistry)|turn]]s (or coils).
* Proteins composed of ten amino acids coded by SNS primeval genetic code can form six fundamental structures, namely, hydrophobic and hydrophilic structures, α-helices, β-sheets, turns, [[acidic]] and [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] fragments.

A '''geodetic datum''' or '''geodetic system''' is a [[coordinate system]], and a set of reference points, used to locate places on the [[Earth]] (or similar objects).  An approximate definition of [[sea level]] is the datum [[World Geodetic System|WGS 84]], an [[reference ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], whereas a more accurate definition is Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM2008), using at least 2,159 [[spherical harmonics]]. Other datums are defined for other areas or at other times; [[ED50]] was defined in 1950 over Europe and differs from WGS 84 by a few hundred meters depending on where in Europe you look. 
[[Mars]] has no [[oceans]] and so no sea level, but at least two [[Geography of Mars#Zero elevation|martian datums]] have been used to locate places there.

Datums are used in [[geodesy]], [[navigation]], and [[surveying]] by [[cartographer]]s and [[satellite navigation system]]s to translate positions indicated on [[map]]s (paper or digital) to their real position on [[Earth]]. Each starts with an [[ellipsoid]] (stretched sphere), and then defines [[latitude]], [[longitude]] and [[altitude]] coordinates.  One or more locations on the Earth's surface are chosen as anchor "base-points".

The difference in co-ordinates between datums is commonly referred to as ''datum shift''. The datum shift between two particular datums can vary from one place to another within one country or region, and can be anything from zero to hundreds of meters (or several kilometers for some remote islands). The [[North Pole]], [[South Pole]] and [[Equator]] will be in different positions on different datums, so [[True North]] will be slightly different. Different datums use different interpolations for the precise shape and size of the Earth ([[reference ellipsoid]]s).

Because the Earth is an imperfect ellipsoid, localised datums can give a more accurate representation of the area of coverage than WGS 84. [[Ordnance Survey National Grid|OSGB36]], for example, is a better approximation to the [[geoid]] covering the British Isles than the global WGS 84 ellipsoid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/geoid.htm|title=Geoid—Help {{!}} ArcGIS for Desktop|website=desktop.arcgis.com|access-date=2017-01-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202054013/http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/geoid.htm|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the benefits of a global system outweigh the greater accuracy, the global WGS 84 datum is becoming increasingly adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/datums.htm|title=Datums—Help {{!}} ArcGIS for Desktop|website=desktop.arcgis.com|access-date=2017-01-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202052131/http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/datums.htm|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horizontal datums are used for describing a point on the [[Earth]]'s surface, in [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] or another coordinate system. Vertical datums  measure elevations or depths.

[[Image:Chicago City Datum.jpg|thumb|right|City of Chicago Datum Benchmark]]

== Definition ==

In [[surveying]] and [[geodesy]], a ''datum'' is a reference system or an approximation of the Earth's surface against which positional measurements are made for computing locations. Horizontal datums are used for describing a point on the [[Earth]]'s surface, in [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] or another coordinate system. Vertical datums are used to measure elevations or underwater depths.

=== Horizontal datum ===
The horizontal datum is the model used to measure positions on the Earth. A specific point on the Earth can have substantially different coordinates, depending on the datum used to make the measurement. There are hundreds of local horizontal datums around the world, usually referenced to some convenient local reference point. Contemporary datums, based on increasingly accurate measurements of the shape of the Earth, are intended to cover larger areas. The [[WGS 84]] datum, which is almost identical to the [[NAD83]] datum used in North America and the [[ETRS89]] datum used in Europe, is a common standard datum.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

For example, in Sydney there is a 200 metres (700&amp;nbsp;feet) difference between GPS coordinates configured in GDA (based on global standard WGS 84) and AGD (used for most local maps), which is an unacceptably large error for some applications, such as [[surveying]] or site location for [[scuba diving]].&lt;ref&gt;McFadyen, [http://www.michaelmcfadyenscuba.info/viewpage.php?page_id=80 GPS and Diving] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819064902/http://michaelmcfadyenscuba.info/viewpage.php?page_id=80 |date=2006-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vertical datum ===
{{further|Chart datum}}

[[File:Vertical references in Europe.svg|thumbnail|Vertical datums in Europe]]
A vertical datum is used as a reference point for [[elevation]]s of surfaces and features on the Earth including terrain, bathymetry, water levels, and man-made structures. Vertical datums are either: tidal, based on [[sea level]]s; gravimetric, based on a [[geoid]]; or geodetic, based on the same ellipsoid models of the Earth used for computing horizontal datums.

In common usage, elevations are often cited in height above [[sea level]], although what “sea level” actually means is a more complex issue than might at first be thought: the height of the sea surface at any one place and time is a result of numerous effects, including waves, wind and currents, atmospheric pressure, [[tide]]s, topography, and even differences in the strength of gravity due to the presence of mountains etc.

For the purpose of measuring the height of objects on land, the usual datum used is [[mean sea level]] (MSL).  This is a tidal datum which is described as the arithmetic mean of the hourly water elevation taken over a specific 19 years cycle. This definition averages out tidal highs and lows (caused by the gravitational effects of the sun and the moon) and short term variations. It will not remove the effects of local gravity strength, and so the height of MSL, relative to a geodetic datum, will vary around the world, and even around one country. Countries tend to choose the mean sea level at one specific point to be used as the standard “sea level” for all mapping and surveying in that country.  (For example, in Great Britain, the national vertical datum, Ordnance Datum Newlyn, is based on what was mean sea level at [[Newlyn]] in [[Cornwall]] between 1915 and 1921).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} However, zero elevation as defined by one country is not the same as zero elevation defined by another (because MSL is not the same everywhere), which is why locally defined vertical datums differ from one another.

A different principle is used when choosing a datum for [[nautical charts]].  For safety reasons, a mariner must be able to know the minimum depth of water that could occur at any point.  For this reason, depths and tides on a nautical chart are measured relative to [[chart datum]], which is defined to be a level below which tide rarely falls.  Exactly how this is chosen depends on the tidal regime in the area being charted and on the policy of the hydrographic office producing the chart in question; a typical definition is Lowest Astronomical Tide (the lowest tide predictable from the effects of gravity), or Mean Lower Low Water (the average lowest tide of each day), although MSL is sometimes used in waters with very low tidal ranges.

Conversely, if a ship is to safely pass under a low bridge or overhead power cable, the mariner must know the minimum clearance between the masthead and the obstruction, which will occur at high tide.  Consequently, bridge clearances etc. are given relative to a datum based on high tide, such as Highest Astronomical Tide or Mean High Water Springs.

Sea level does not remain constant throughout [[geological time]], and so tidal datums are less useful when studying very long-term processes. In some situations sea level does not apply at all — for instance for [[Geography of Mars|mapping Mars' surface]] — forcing the use of a different "zero elevation", such as mean radius.

A geodetic vertical datum takes some specific zero point, and computes elevations based on the geodetic model being used, without further reference to sea levels. Usually, the starting reference point is a tide gauge, so at that point the geodetic and tidal datums might match, but due to sea level variations, the two scales may not match elsewhere.  An example of a gravity-based geodetic datum is [[NAVD88]], used in North America, which is referenced to a point in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]].  Ellipsoid-based datums such as [[WGS 84]], [[GRS80]] or [[NAD83]] use a theoretical surface that may differ significantly from the [[geoid]].

== Geodetic coordinates ==
{{Main|Reference ellipsoid#Coordinates}}
[[File:Geocentric vs geodetic latitude.svg|thumb|right|300px|The same position on a [[spheroid]] has a different angle for latitude depending on whether the angle is measured from the normal line segment ''CP'' of the [[ellipsoid]] (angle ''α'') or the line segment ''AP'' from the center (angle ''β''). Note that the "[[flatness]]" of the spheroid (orange) in the image is greater than that of the Earth; as a result, the corresponding difference between the "geodetic" and "geocentric" latitudes is also exaggerated.]]

In geodetic coordinates, the Earth's surface is approximated by an [[Earth ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], and locations near the surface are described in terms of [[latitude]] (&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;), [[longitude]] (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;), and height (&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref group="footnotes"&gt;About the right/left-handed order of the coordinates, i.e., &lt;math&gt;(\lambda, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(\phi, \lambda)&lt;/math&gt;, see [[Spherical coordinate system#Conventions]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geodetic versus geocentric latitude ===
Geodetic [[latitude]] (&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;), resp. [[altitude]], is different from geocentric latitude (&lt;math&gt;\phi'&lt;/math&gt;), resp. altitude. Geodetic latitude is determined by the angle between the [[equator]]ial plane and [[surface normal|normal]] to the ellipsoid, whereas geocentric latitude is determined by the angle between the equatorial plane and line joining the point to the centre of the ellipsoid (see figure). Unless otherwise specified, latitude is geodetic latitude.

=== Defining and derived parameters ===

The ellipsoid is completely parameterised by the semi-major axis &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and the flattening &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

From &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; it is possible to derive the semi-minor axis &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, first eccentricity &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and second eccentricity &lt;math&gt;e'&lt;/math&gt; of the ellipsoid

== Conversion calculations ==
{{further|Geographic coordinate conversion}}

Datum conversion is the process of converting the coordinates of a point from one datum system to another. Datum conversion may frequently be accompanied by a change of [[Map projection|grid projection]].

== Reference datums ==
{{see also|Reference ellipsoid}}

A reference datum is a known and constant surface which is used to describe the location of unknown points on the Earth. Since reference datums can have different radii and different center points, a specific point on the Earth can have substantially different coordinates depending on the datum used to make the measurement. There are hundreds of locally developed reference datums around the world, usually referenced to some convenient local reference point. Contemporary datums, based on increasingly accurate measurements of the shape of the Earth, are intended to cover larger areas. The most common reference Datums in use in [[North America]] are NAD27, NAD83, and [[WGS 84]].

The [[North American Datum]] of 1927 (NAD 27) is "the horizontal control datum for the United States that was defined by a location and azimuth on the Clarke spheroid of 1866, with origin at (the survey station) [[Meades Ranch Triangulation Station|Meades Ranch (Kansas)]]." ... The geoidal height at Meades Ranch was assumed to be zero, as sufficient gravity data was not available, and this was needed to relate surface measurements to the datum. "Geodetic positions on the North American Datum of 1927 were derived from the (coordinates of and an azimuth at Meades Ranch) through a readjustment of the triangulation of the entire network in which Laplace azimuths were introduced, and the Bowie method was used." (http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatDatum )  NAD27 is a local referencing system covering North America.

The North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83) is "The horizontal control datum for the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America, based on a geocentric origin and the Geodetic Reference System 1980 ([[GRS80]]). "This datum, designated as NAD 83 ...is based on the adjustment of 250,000 points including 600 satellite Doppler stations which constrain the system to a geocentric origin." NAD83 may be considered a local referencing system.

WGS 84 is the [[World Geodetic System]] of 1984. It is the reference frame used by the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD) and is defined by the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA) (formerly the Defense Mapping Agency, then the National Imagery and Mapping Agency). WGS 84 is used by DoD for all its mapping, charting, surveying, and navigation needs, including its [[GPS]] "broadcast" and "precise" orbits. WGS 84 was defined in January 1987 using Doppler satellite surveying techniques. It was used as the reference frame for broadcast GPS Ephemerides (orbits) beginning January 23, 1987. At 0000 GMT January 2, 1994, WGS 84 was upgraded in accuracy using GPS measurements. The formal name then became WGS 84 (G730), since the upgrade date coincided with the start of GPS Week 730. It became the reference frame for broadcast orbits on June 28, 1994. At 0000 GMT September 30, 1996 (the start of GPS Week 873), WGS 84 was redefined again and was more closely aligned with [[International Earth Rotation Service]] (IERS) frame [[International Terrestrial Reference System|ITRF]] 94. It was then formally called WGS 84 (G873). WGS 84 (G873) was adopted as the reference frame for broadcast orbits on January 29, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WGS84|title=National Geodetic Survey - Frequently Asked Questions FAQ|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Geodetic|last=Survey|date=|website=www.ngs.noaa.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019024226/https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WGS84|archivedate=2011-10-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another update brought it to WGS84(G1674).

The WGS 84 datum, within two meters of the NAD83 datum used in North America, is the only world referencing system in place today. WGS 84 is the default standard datum for coordinates stored in recreational and commercial GPS units.

Users of GPS are cautioned that they must always check the datum of the maps they are using. To correctly enter, display, and to store map related map coordinates, the datum of the map must be entered into the GPS map datum field.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4674">{{for|the mathematical journal|Geometry &amp; Topology}}

In [[mathematics]], '''geometry and topology''' is an [[umbrella term]] for the historically distinct disciplines of [[geometry]] and [[topology]], as general frameworks allow both disciplines to be manipulated uniformly, most visibly in [[Riemannian geometry#Local to global theorems|local to global theorems]] in Riemannian geometry, and results like the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]] and [[Chern–Weil theory]].

Sharp distinctions between geometry and topology can be drawn, however, as discussed below.{{clarify|how recognized are these sharp distinctions? Are they official in the sense of professional organizations or some such, or is it up to the practitioners?|date=December 2016}}

It is also the title of a journal ''[[Geometry &amp; Topology]]'' that covers these topics.

==Scope==
It is distinct from "geometric topology", which more narrowly involves applications of topology to geometry.

It includes:
* [[Differential geometry and topology]]
* [[Geometric topology]] (including [[low-dimensional topology]] and [[surgery theory]])

It does not include such parts of [[algebraic topology]] as [[homotopy theory]], but some areas of geometry and topology (such as surgery theory, particularly [[algebraic surgery theory]]) are heavily algebraic.

==Distinction between geometry and topology==
Geometry has ''local'' structure (or infinitesimal), while topology only has ''global'' structure. Alternatively, geometry has ''continuous'' [[moduli space|moduli]], while topology has ''discrete'' moduli.

By examples, an example of geometry is [[Riemannian geometry]], while an example of topology is [[homotopy theory]]. The study of [[metric space]]s is geometry, the study of [[topological space]]s is topology.

The terms are not used completely consistently: [[symplectic manifold]]s are a boundary case, and [[Coarse structure|coarse geometry]] is global, not local.

===Local versus global structure===
By definition, [[differentiable manifold]]s of a fixed dimension are all locally diffeomorphic to [[Euclidean space]], so aside from dimension, there are no local invariants. Thus, differentiable structures on a manifold are topological in nature.

By contrast, the [[Curvature of Riemannian manifolds|curvature]] of a [[Riemannian manifold]] is a local (indeed, infinitesimal) invariant{{clarify|not clear why curvature would be invariant|date=December 2016}} (and is the only local invariant under [[isometry]]).

===Moduli===
If a structure has a discrete moduli (if it has no [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]]s, or if a deformation of a structure is isomorphic to the original structure), the structure is said to be '''rigid''', and its study (if it is a geometric or topological structure) is topology. If it has non-trivial deformations, the structure is said to be '''flexible''', and its study is geometry.

The space of [[homotopy]] classes of maps is discrete,{{efn|Given point-set conditions, which are satisfied for manifolds; more generally homotopy classes form a [[totally disconnected]] but not necessarily discrete space; for example, the [[fundamental group]] of the [[Hawaiian earring]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017|reason=Specific claim about a topological space.}}}} so studying maps up to homotopy is topology.
Similarly, differentiable structures on a manifold is usually a discrete space, and hence an example of topology, but [[exotic R4|exotic '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;s]] have continuous moduli of differentiable structures.

[[Algebraic varieties]] have continuous [[moduli space]]s, hence their study is [[algebraic geometry]]. These are finite-dimensional moduli spaces.

The space of Riemannian metrics on a given differentiable manifold is an infinite-dimensional space.

===Symplectic manifolds===
[[Symplectic manifold]]s are a boundary case, and parts of their study are called [[symplectic topology]] and [[symplectic geometry]].

By [[Darboux's theorem]], a symplectic manifold has no local structure, which suggests that their study be called topology.

By contrast, the space of symplectic structures on a manifold form a continuous moduli, which suggests that their study be called geometry.

However, up to [[Ambient isotopy|isotopy]], the space of symplectic structures is discrete (any family of symplectic structures are isotopic).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.duke.edu/~bryant/ParkCityLectures.pdf Introduction to Lie Groups and Symplectic Geometry], by [[Robert Bryant (mathematician)|Robert Bryant]], p. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Giri'''|[[wikt:義理|義理]]}}&lt;ref name=davies /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Benedict]], [[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]],1946&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Japanese values|Japanese value]] roughly corresponding to "[[duty]]", "[[obligation]]", or even "burden of obligation" in English. It is defined as "to serve one's superiors with a self-sacrificing devotion" by [[Namiko Abe]]. This value is so integral to Japanese culture that the conflict between ''giri'' and ''[[ninjō]]'', or "human feeling", is said to have been the primary topic of Japanese drama since earlier periods in history.

==In behavior==
Giri may be seen in many different aspects of modern Japanese behavior:

# Japanese gift-giving is marked by an unwritten but no less real perceived balance of "giri", whereupon unusually large gifts must be reciprocated.  "[[Giri choco]]" is a specific term referring to the obligation of close colleagues or associates to provide [[Valentine's Day]] or [[White Day]] chocolates to each other even if they feel no romantic feelings (although Valentine's Day is a Western tradition that wasn't imported to Japan until relatively recently and White Day is a holiday invented in 1978 by the National Confectionery Industry Association in order to sell twice as many confections each year).
# Japanese corporations fire or lay off their employees at one of the lowest rates of any industrialized nation, and employees reciprocate this loyalty through their personal habits.  Whereas in the West engineers from different companies might be friends, this is far more rare in Japan.  Employees' sense of obligation may be so strong that they consume only the beer and other products produced by their conglomerate's affiliates. [[Part time]] workers, however, are not so particular.
# Japanese abroad often complain about the poor service to be found in non-Japanese countries.  While some modern Westerners might prize individuality and the right of a serviceperson to be an assertive social equal with opinions, Japanese generally value carrying out one's work obligations (giri) to the best of one's ability, including what might seem to those from less formal social environments like excessive, mawkish, or even hypocritical or contrived formality and servility.

Some social historians believe the pervasiveness of this concept in Japanese culture is a reflection of the static feudal order that defined Japanese society for centuries.  "Giri books", or village registers that included all the unpaid obligations of one family or individual to another, were a cultural phenomenon that could only exist in a static agricultural culture, as opposed to a migrant or hunter/gatherer tradition.&lt;ref name=davies&gt;{{citation |title= The Japanese mind: understanding contemporary Japanese culture |chapter= Giri: japanese social obligations |author= Roger J. Davies, Osamu Ikeno |publisher= [[Tuttle Publishing]] |year= 2002 |isbn= 0-8048-3295-1 |pages= 95–101 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TW7lHYwXhS4C&amp;dq=japan+valentine's+day&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=opera&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* In the film ''[[The Yakuza]]'' ([[1975 in film|1975]]), the concept of giri is a major factor in the story. The character Tanaka Ken ([[Ken Takakura|Takakura Ken]]) owes Harry Kilmer ([[Robert Mitchum]]) a "debt that can never be repaid" for saving the life of his 'sister' (actually Tanaka Ken's wife) and her young daughter during the post-war occupation of Japan. In the film, he describes giri to a Westerner as "the burden hardest to bear".
* In ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' [[animated series]] episode "[[The Burden Hardest to Bear]]", the [[Autobot]] [[List of Autobots#Cars|Kup]] uses the concept of giri to describe the burden of leadership facing [[Rodimus Prime]].  Much of the episode is set in Japan, and deals with Rodimus Prime's reluctance to be a leader, only to eventually come to grips with his responsibility.&lt;ref name="Transformers: Generation One"&gt;{{cite episode |series=The Transformers |season=3 |number=91 |title=The Burden Hardest to Bear }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[William Gibson|William Gibson's]] semi-dystopian [[Sprawl trilogy]], Eastern themes, including giri, often play a role. Loyalty to one's company, or in this case international corporate mega-entities, is taken to the extreme to include surgically implanted monitoring devices and employees living almost exclusively within the regimented confines of the company. It is also seen at an individual level, the term mentioned several times in the novel ''[[Mona Lisa Overdrive]]''. Most notable is the exchange between the console cowboy "Tick" and the [[Yakuza]] authority Yanaka.

'''Gossip''' is idle talk or [[rumor]], especially about the personal or private affairs of others; the act is also known as '''dishing''' or '''tattling'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gossip?s=t|title=Gossip - Define Gossip at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gossip has been researched in terms of its origins in [[evolutionary psychology]],&lt;ref name=science&gt;{{cite news |last=McAndrew |first=Frank T. |title=The Science of Gossip: Why we can't stop ourselves |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-science-of-gossip |date=October 2008 |work=[[Scientific American]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has found gossip to be an important means for people to monitor cooperative [[reputation]]s and so maintain widespread [[Reciprocity (evolution)#Indirect reciprocity|indirect reciprocity]].&lt;ref&gt;Sommerfeld RD, Krambeck HJ, Semmann D, Milinski M.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 104(44):17435-40. {{PMID|17947384}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect reciprocity is a social interaction in which one actor helps another and is then benefited by a third party. Gossip has also been identified by [[Robin Dunbar]], an evolutionary biologist, as aiding [[Human bonding|social bonding]] in large groups.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar RI. (2004). [http://attach.matita.net/ziorufus/Dunbar%20gossip.pdf Gossip in evolutionary perspective]. Review of general psychology 8: 100-110. [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15804371 abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Wiktionary}}
The word is from [[Old English]] ''godsibb'', from ''[[god (word)|god]]'' and ''[[sibb]]'', the term for the [[godparents]] of one's child or the parents of one's godchild, generally very close friends. In the 16th century, the word assumed the meaning of a person, mostly a woman, one who delights in idle talk, a newsmonger, a tattler.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 19th century, the term was extended from the talker to the conversation of such persons. The verb ''to gossip'', meaning "to be a gossip", first appears in [[Shakespeare]].

The term originates from the bedroom at the time of childbirth. Giving birth used to be a social event exclusively attended by women. The pregnant woman's female relatives and neighbours would congregate and idly converse. Over time, gossip came to mean talk of others.&lt;ref&gt;"If Walls Could Talk: The History of the Home (Bedroom), Lucy Worsley,  BBC"&lt;/ref&gt;

Others say that gossip comes from the same root as "gospel" -- it is a contraction of "good spiel", meaning a good story.

==Workplace gossip==
Mary Gormandy White, a [[Human resource management|human resource]] expert, gives the following "signs" for identifying workplace gossip:
* Animated people become silent ("Conversations stop when you enter the room")
* People begin staring at someone
* Workers indulge in inappropriate topics of conversation.&lt;ref name=IAAP&gt;Jeanne Grunert, "When Gossip Strikes," ''OfficePro'', January/February 2010, pp. 16-18, at 17, found at [http://www.iaap-hq.org/publications/officepro/opfliparchive/janfeb2010/pageflip.html IAAP website].{{dead link|date=April 2016}} Accessed March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 
White suggests "five tips ... [to] handle the situation with [[aplomb]]:
# Rise above the gossip
# Understand what causes or fuels the gossip
# Do not participate in workplace gossip.
# Allow for the gossip to go away on its own
# If it persists, "gather facts and seek help."&lt;ref name=IAAP /&gt;

Peter Vajda identifies gossip as a form of [[workplace violence]], noting that it is "essentially a form of attack."&lt;!-- http://ezinearticles.com/?Gossip---A-Form-of-Workplace-Violence&amp;id=133712 Gossip - A Form of Workplace Violence, Peter Vajda, Ph.D. --&gt; Gossip is thought by many to "empower one person while disempowering another" (Hafen). Accordingly, many companies have formal policies in their [[employee handbook]]s against gossip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanresourceblog.com/2007/11/16/new-jersey-hearsay-evidence/ New Jersey Hearsay Evidence], Human Resource Blog.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes there is room for disagreement on exactly what constitutes unacceptable gossip, since workplace gossip may take the form of offhand remarks about someone's tendencies such as "He always takes a long lunch," or "Don’t worry, that’s just how she is."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tlkhealthcare.com/files/uploads/newsletter2005Summer.pdf The Culture Shock] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127130901/http://www.tlkhealthcare.com/files/uploads/newsletter2005Summer.pdf |date=2007-11-27 }}, Tami Kyle, TLK Connections, Summer 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; TLK Healthcare cites as examples of gossip, "tattletailing to the boss without intention of furthering a solution or speaking to co-workers about something someone else has done to upset us." Corporate email can be a particularly dangerous method of gossip delivery, as the medium is semi-permanent and messages are easily forwarded to unintended recipients; accordingly, a Mass High Tech article advised employers to instruct employees against using company email networks for gossip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swiggartagin.com/articles/mht.pdf Companies must spell out employee e-mail policies], Warren E. Agin, Swiggart &amp; Agin, LLC, Mass High Tech, November 18, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Low [[self-esteem]] and a desire to "fit in" are frequently cited as motivations for workplace gossip.
There are five essential functions that gossip has in the workplace (according to DiFonzo &amp; Bordia):
* Helps individuals learn social information about other individuals in the organization (often without even having to meet the other individual)
* Builds social networks of individuals by bonding co-workers together and affiliating people with each other.
* Breaks existing bonds by ostracizing individuals within an organization.
* Enhances one's social status/power/prestige within the organization.
* Inform individuals as to what is considered socially acceptable behavior within the organization.

According to Kurkland and Pelled, workplace gossip can be very serious depending upon the amount of [[Power (social and political)|power]] that the gossiper has over the recipient, which will in turn affect how the gossip is interpreted. There are four types of power that are influenced by gossip:
* '''Coercive:''' when a gossiper tells negative information about a person, their recipient might believe that the gossiper will also spread negative information about them. This causes the gossiper's coercive power to increase.
* '''Reward:''' when a gossiper tells positive information about a person, their recipient might believe that the gossiper will also spread positive information about them. This causes the gossiper's reward power to increase.
* '''Expert:''' when a gossiper seems to have very detailed knowledge of either the organization's values or about others in the work environment, their expert power becomes enhanced.
* '''Referent:''' this power can either be reduced OR enhanced to a point. When people view gossiping as a petty activity done to waste time, a gossiper's referent power can decrease along with their reputation. When a recipient is thought of as being invited into a social circle by being a recipient, the gossiper's referent power can increase, but only to a high point where then the recipient begins to resent the gossiper (Kurland &amp; Pelled).

Some negative consequences of workplace gossip may include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/feap/newsletters/workplace-gossip.pdf Workplace Gossip] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127130859/http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/feap/newsletters/workplace-gossip.pdf |date=2007-11-27 }}, Kit Hennessy, LPC, CEAP.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lost productivity and wasted time,
* Erosion of trust and morale,
* Increased anxiety among employees as rumors circulate without any clear information as to what is fact and what isn’t,
* Growing divisiveness among employees as people “take sides,"
* Hurt feelings and reputations,
* Jeopardized chances for the gossipers' advancement as they are perceived as unprofessional, and
* Attrition as good employees leave the company due to the unhealthy work atmosphere.
Turner and Weed theorize that among the three main types of responders to [[workplace conflict]] are attackers who cannot keep their feelings to themselves and express their feelings by attacking whatever they can. Attackers are further divided into up-front attackers and behind-the-back attackers. Turner and Weed note that the latter "are difficult to handle because the target person is not sure of the source of any criticism, nor even always sure that there is criticism."&lt;ref&gt;Conflict in organizations: Practical solutions any manager can use; Turner, Stephen P. (University of South Florida); Weed, Frank; 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible however, that there may be illegal, unethical, or disobedient behavior happening at the workplace and this may be a case where reporting the behavior may be viewed as gossip. It is then left up to the authority in charge to fully investigate the matter and not simply look past the report and assume it to be workplace gossip.

Informal networks through which communication occurs in an organization are sometimes called the [[grapevine (gossip)|grapevine]]. In a study done by Harcourt, Richerson, and Wattier, it was found that middle managers in several different organizations believed that gathering information from the grapevine was a much better way of learning information than through formal communication with their subordinates (Harcourt, Richerson &amp; Wattier).

==Various views==
Some see gossip as trivial, hurtful and socially and/or intellectually unproductive. Some people view gossip as a lighthearted way of spreading information. A [[feminism|feminist]] definition of gossip presents it as "a way of talking between women, intimate in style, personal and domestic in scope and setting, a female cultural event which springs from and perpetuates the restrictions of the female role, but also gives the comfort of validation." (Jones, 1990:243)

===In early modern England===
&lt;!-- this section might fit better in an as-yet non-existent article called something like [[gossip (companion)]] --&gt;

In [[Early Modern Britain|Early Modern England]] the word "gossip" referred to companions in [[childbirth]], not limited to the [[midwife]]. It also became a term for women-friends generally, with no necessary derogatory connotations. (OED n. definition 2. a. "A familiar acquaintance, friend, chum", supported by references from 1361 to 1873). It commonly referred to an informal local [[sorority]] or social group, who could enforce socially acceptable behaviour through private censure or through public rituals, such as "[[rough music]]", the [[cucking stool]] and the [[skimmington ride]].

In [[Thomas Harman]]’s ''Caveat for Common Cursitors'' 1566 a ‘[[Thieves' cant|walking mort]]’ relates how she was forced to agree to meet a man in his barn, but informed his wife. The wife arrived with her “five furious, sturdy, muffled gossips” who catch the errant husband with “his hosen about his legs” and give him a sound beating. The story clearly functions as a [[morality tale]] in which the gossips uphold the [[social order]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Capp, ''When Gossips Meet: Women, Family and Neighbourhood in Early Modern England'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2003. {{ISBN|0-19-925598-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sir Herbert Maxwell Bart's The Chevalier of the Splendid Crest [1900] at the end of chapter three the king is noted as referring to his loyal knight "Sir Thomas de Roos" in kindly terms as "my old gossip". Whilst a historical novel of that time the reference implies a continued use of the term "Gossip" as childhood friend as late as 1900.

===In Judaism===
{{main article|Lashon hara}}
Judaism considers gossip spoken without a constructive purpose (known in Hebrew as an [[evil tongue]], ''lashon hara'') as a [[sin]]. Speaking negatively about people, even if retelling true facts, counts as sinful, as it demeans the dignity of man — both the speaker and the subject of the gossip.
According to ''[[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]]'' 18:8: "The words of a gossip are like choice morsels: they go down to a man's innermost parts."

===In Christianity===
The Christian perspective on gossip is typically based on modern cultural assumptions of the phenomenon, especially the assumption that generally speaking, gossip is negative speech.&lt;ref&gt;Meng, Margaret (2008). "Gossip: Killing Us Softly." ''Homiletic and Pastoral Review'' 109. pp. 26-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sedler, M.D. (2001). ''Stop the Runaway Conversation: Take Control Over Gossip and Criticism''. Grand Rapids: Chosen.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Mathew C. (2013). ''Resisting Gossip: Winning the War of the Wagging Tongue''. Fort Washington: CLC Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the complexity of the phenomenon, biblical scholars have more precisely identified the form and function of gossip, even identifying a socially positive role for the social process as it is described in the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, John W. (2013). ''Gossiping Jesus: The Oral Processing of Jesus in John's Gospel''. Eugene: Pickwick Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, John W. (2012). "Gossip in the New Testament." Biblical Theology Bulletin 42/4. pp. 204-213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Botha, Pieter J. J. (1998). "Paul and Gossip: A Social Mechanism in Early Christian Communities." ''Neotestamentica'' 32. pp. 267-288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Botha, Pieter J. J. (1993). "The Social Dynamics of the Early Transmission of the Jesus Tradition." ''Neotestamentica'' 27. pp. 205-231.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kartzow, Marianne B. (2005) "Female Gossipers and their Reputation in the Pastoral Epistles." ''Neotestamentica'' 39. pp. 255-271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kartzow, Marianne B. (2009). ''Gossip and Gender: Othering of Speech in the Pastoral Epistles''. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kartzow, Marianne B. (2010) "[http://www.lectio.unibe.ch/10_1/kartzow2.html Resurrection as Gossip: Representations of Women in Resurrection Stories of the Gospels.]" ''Lectio Difficilior'' 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohrbaugh, Richard L. (2007). "Gossip in the New Testament." ''The New Testament in Cross-Cultural Perspective.'' Eugene: Cascade Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, this does not mean that there are ''not'' numerous texts in the New Testament that see gossip as dangerous negative speech.

Thus, for example, the [[Epistle to the Romans]] associates gossips ("backbiters") with a list of sins including sexual immorality and with murder:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:28: And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;
:29: Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
:30: Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
:31: Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:
:32: Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them. (Romans 1:28-32)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Matthew 18]], Jesus also taught that conflict resolution among church members ought to begin with the aggrieved party attempting to resolve their dispute with the offending party alone. Only if this did not work would the process escalate to the next step, in which another church member would become involved. After that if the person at fault still would not "hear", the matter was to be fully investigated by the church elders, and if not resolved to be then exposed publicly.

Based on texts like these portraying gossip negatively, many Christian authors generalize on the phenomenon. So, in order to gossip, writes Phil Fox Rose, we "must harden our heart towards the 'out' person. We draw a line between ourselves and them; define them as being outside the rules of Christian charity... We create a gap between ourselves and God's Love." As we harden our heart towards more people and groups, he continues, "this negativity and feeling of separateness will grow and permeate our world, and we'll find it more difficult to access God’s love in any aspect of our lives."&lt;ref&gt;Phil Fox Rose, [http://www.patheos.com/blogs/philfoxrose/2012/10/gossip-hardens-our-hearts/ "Gossip hardens our hearts"], ''Patheos''. Accessed February 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Testament is also in favor of group accountability (Ephesians 5:11; 1st Tim 5:20; James 5:16; Gal 6:1-2; 1 Cor 12:26), which may be associated with gossip.

===In Islam===

Islam considers [[backbiting]] the equivalent of eating the flesh of one's dead brother. According to Muslims, backbiting harms its victims without offering them any chance of defense, just as dead people cannot defend against their flesh being eaten. Muslims are expected to treat others like brothers (regardless of their beliefs, skin color, gender, or ethnic origin), deriving from Islam's concept of brotherhood amongst its believers.

===In Bahai Faith===

Bahais consider backbiting to be the "worst human quality and the most great sin..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bahaiquotes.com/quotepage.php?Quotes%2FBackbiting|website=Bahai Quotes.com|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, even murder would be considered less reprobate than backbiting. [[Baha'u'llah]] stated, "Backbiting quencheth the light of the heart, and extinguisheth the life of the soul."  When someone kills another, it only affects their physical condition.  However, when someone gossips, it affects one in a different manner.

==In psychology==

===Evolutionary view===
From Dunbar's evolutionary theories, gossip originated to help bond the groups that were constantly growing in size. To survive, individuals need alliances; but as these alliances grew larger, it was difficult if not impossible to physically connect with everyone. Conversation and language were able to bridge this gap. Gossip became a social interaction that helped the group gain information about other individuals without personally speaking to them. It enabled people to keep up with what was going on in their social network. It also creates a bond between the teller and the hearer, as they share information of mutual interest and spend time together. It also helps the hearer learn about another individual’s behavior and helps them have a more effective approach to their relationship. Dunbar (2004) found that 65% of conversations consist of social topics.&lt;ref name="Dunbar"&gt;Dunbar, R. (2004). Gossip in evolutionary perspective. Review of General Psychology, 8(2), 100-110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunbar (1994) argues that gossip is the equivalent of [[social grooming]] often observed in other primate species.&lt;ref name="Dunbar, R.I.M. 1994"&gt;Dunbar, R.I.M. (1994). Grooming, gossip, and the evolution of language. London: Faver &amp; Faber.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropological investigations indicate that gossip is a cross-cultural phenomenon, providing evidence for evolutionary accounts of gossip.&lt;ref&gt;Besnier, N. (1989). Information withholding as a manipulative and collusive strategy in Nukulaelae gossip. Language in society, 18, 315-341.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gluckman, M. (1963). Gossip and scandal. Current Anthropology, 4, 307-316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haviland, J.B. 1977"&gt;Haviland, J.B. (1977). Gossip as competition in Zinacantan. Journal of Communication, 27, 186-191.&lt;/ref&gt; There is very little evidence to suggest meaningful sex differences in the proportion of conversational time spent gossiping, and when there is a difference, women are only very slightly more likely to gossip compared with men.&lt;ref name="Dunbar, R.I.M. 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haviland, J.B. 1977"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foster, E.K. (2004). Research on gossip: Taxonomy, methods, and future directions. Review of General Psychology, 8 (2), 78-99.&lt;/ref&gt;
Further support for the evolutionary significance of gossip comes from a recent study published in the peer-reviewed journal, Science. Anderson and colleagues (2011) found that faces paired with negative social information dominate visual consciousness to a greater extent than positive and neutral social information during a binocular rivalry task. Binocular rivalry occurs when two different stimuli are presented to each eye simultaneously and the two percepts compete for dominance in visual consciousness. While this occurs, an individual will consciously perceive one of the percepts while the other is suppressed. After a time, the other percept will become dominant and an individual will become aware of the second percept. Finally, the two percepts will alternate back and forth in terms of visual awareness. The study by Anderson and colleagues (2011) indicates that higher order cognitive processes, like evaluative information processing, can influence early visual processing. That only negative social information differentially affected the dominance of the faces during the task alludes to the unique importance of knowing information about an individual that should be avoided. Since the positive social information did not produce greater perceptual dominance of the matched face indicates that negative information about an individual may be more salient to our behavior than positive.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson, E., Siegel, E.H., Bliss-Moreau, E. &amp; Barrett, L.F. (2011). The visual impact of gossip. Science Magazine, 332, 1446-1448.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gossip also gives information about social norms and guidelines for behavior. Gossip usually comments on how appropriate a behavior was, and the mere act of repeating it signifies its importance. In this sense, gossip is effective regardless of whether it is positive or negative&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R. F., Zhang, L., &amp; Vohs, K. D. (2004). Gossip as cultural learning. Review of General Psychology, 8, 111–121.&lt;/ref&gt; Some theorists have proposed that gossip is actually a pro-social behavior intended to allow an individual to correct their socially prohibitive behavior without direct confrontation of the individual. By gossiping about an individual’s acts, other individuals can subtly indicate that said acts are inappropriate and allow the individual to correct their behavior (Schoeman 1994).

===Perception of those who gossip===
Individuals who are perceived to engage in gossiping regularly are seen as having less social power and being less liked. The type of gossip being exchanged also affects likeability whereby those who engage in negative gossip are less liked than those who engage in positive gossip.&lt;ref&gt;Farley, S. (2011). Is gossip power? The inverse relationship between gossip, power, and likability. European Journal of Social Psychology, 41, 574-579.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study done by Turner and colleagues (2003), having a prior relationship with a gossiper were not found to protect the gossiper from less favorable personality ratings after gossip was exchanged. In the study, two individuals were brought in to the research lab to participate. Either the two individuals were friends prior to the study or they were strangers scheduled to participate at the same time. One of the individuals was a confederate of the study and they engaged in gossiping about the research assistant after she left the room. The gossip exchanged was either positive or negative. Regardless of gossip type (positive versus negative) or relationship type (friend versus stranger) the gossipers were rated as less trustworthy after sharing the gossip.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, M. M., Mazur, M.A., Wendel, N. &amp; Winslow, R. (2003). Relationship ruin or social glue? The joint effect of relationship type and gossip valence on liking, trust, and expertise. Communication Monographs, 70, 129-141.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;Block, palton Walter ([1976], 1991, 2008). ''[[Defending the Undefendable]]: The Pimp, Prostitute, Scab, Slumlord, Libeler, Moneylender, and Other Scapegoats in the Rogue’s Gallery of American Society'' Auburn, AL: Ludwig von Mises Institute, {{ISBN|978-1-933550-17-6}}, pp. 42-43, [full text online]&lt;/ref&gt; Block has suggested that while gossip and [[blackmail]] both involve the disclosure of unflattering information, the blackmailer is arguably ethically superior to the gossip.

Block writes, "In a sense, the gossip is much ''worse'' than the blackmailer, for the blackmailer has given the blackmailed a chance to silence him. The gossip exposes the secret without warning." The victim of a blackmailer is thus offered choices denied to the subject of gossip, such as deciding if the exposure of his or her secret is worth the cost the blackmailer demands. Moreover, in refusing a blackmailer's offer one is in no worse a position than with the gossip.  Adds Block, "It is indeed difficult, then, to account for the vilification suffered by the blackmailer, at least compared to the gossip, who is usually dismissed with slight contempt and smugness."

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/06/24/do-state-and-local-governments-have-free-speech-rights/ "Do state and local governments have free speech rights?"], [[Volokh Conspiracy]] (June 24, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual free speech rights versus government speech==
The government speech doctrine establishes that the government may advance its own speech without requiring viewpoint neutrality when the government itself is the speaker.  Thus, when the state is the speaker, it may make content based choices. The simple principle has broad implications, and has led to contentious disputes within the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=Hudson /&gt;

The doctrine was implied in ''[[Wooley v. Maynard]]'' in 1977, when the Supreme Court acknowledged a legitimate government interest in communicating an official, ideologically partial message to the public.  In the 1991 case of ''[[Rust v. Sullivan]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Rust v. Sullivan'', [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/89-1391.ZO.html 500 U.S. 173] (1991).  See also ''Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia'', {{ussc|515|819|1995}}, as well as ''[[Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Association]]'', {{ussc|544|550|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; government-funded doctors in a government health program were not allowed to advise patients on obtaining abortions, and the doctors challenged this law on Free Speech grounds.&lt;ref name=Hudson /&gt; However, the Court held that because the program was government-funded, the doctors were therefore speaking on behalf of the government.  Therefore, the government could say what it wishes, and “the Government has not discriminated based on viewpoint; it has merely chosen to fund one activity to the exclusion of the other."&lt;ref&gt;Puiszis, Steven.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kOn2rCdcIGUC&amp;pg=PT837 Illinois Governmental Tort and Section 1983 Civil Rights Liability]'', p. 837 (Matthew Bender, Third Edition, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez]]'', the Supreme Court held that, although providing government-funded legal services appeared similar to government-funded doctors, the speech of the lawyers was private speech because lawyers spoke on behalf of their clients.  As a result, the government could not prevent these attorneys from filing constitutional suits against the government.&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, John and Rotunda, Ronald.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6DHaCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT919 Nowak and Rotunda's Principles of Constitutional Law]'', p. 919 (West Academic, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Free speech rights of states versus federal speech restrictions==
When one sovereign tries to limit the speech of another sovereign, the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] may protect the latter from the former.&lt;ref name=Fagundes /&gt;  David Fagundes has argued that government speech deserves constitutional protection only where the speech is intrinsic to a
public function and furthers democratic self-government.&lt;ref name=Fagundes /&gt;

[[File:The Green Dot.svg|thumb|200px|The Green Dot symbol]]

The '''Green Dot''' ({{lang-de|'''Der Grüne Punkt'''}}) is the license symbol of a European network of industry-funded systems for recycling the packaging materials of consumer goods. The logo is trademark protected worldwide.

==Concept==
The Green Dot was a system thought up by [[Klaus Töpfer]], Germany's environment minister in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/german-green-dot-recycling-system-under-threat/a-16939098 German Green Dot recycling system] Deutsche Welle 15.07.2013&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea of the Green Dot is that consumers who see the logo know that the manufacturer of the product contributes to the cost of recovery and recycling. This can be with household waste collected by the authorities (e.g. in special bags - in Germany these are yellow), or in containers in public places such as car parks and outside supermarkets.

The system is financed by the green dot licence fee paid by the producers of the products. Fees vary by country and are based on the material used in packaging (e.g. paper, plastic, metal, wood, cardboard). Each country also has different fees for joining the scheme and ongoing fixed and variable fees. Fees also take into account the cost of collection, sorting and recycling methods.

In simple terms, the system encourages manufacturers to cut down on packaging as this saves them the cost of licence fees.

[[Image:4 PAO 12M 2007-07-12.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Black-and-white version of the "Der Grüne Punkt" DSD logo on a bottle of lotion, located between the [[PAO symbol]] and the [[resin identification code]] for [[LDPE]], next to an [[EAN-13]] barcode.]]

==German dual system of waste collection==
In 1991, the German government passed a packaging law (Verpackungsverordnung) that requires manufacturers to take care of the recycling or disposal of any packaging material they sell. As a result of this law, German industry set up a "dual system" of [[waste collection]], which picks up household packaging in parallel to the existing municipal waste-collection systems. This industry-funded system is operated in Germany by the Duales System Deutschland GmbH (German for "Dual System Germany Ltd") corporation, or short DSD.

DSD only collects packaging material from manufacturers who pay a license fee to DSD. DSD license fee payers can then add the Green Dot logo to their package labeling to indicate that this package should be placed into the separate yellow bags or yellow [[wheelie bin]]s that will then be collected and emptied by DSD-operated [[waste collection vehicles]] and sorted (and where possible recycled) in DSD facilities.

German licence fees are calculated using the weight of packs, each material type used and the volumes of product produced per.

==Management==
Worldwide stewardship of the Green Dot logo is managed by PRO Europe (Packaging Recovery Organisation Europe) on behalf of the various national Green dot organizations across Europe.

==Symbol design and confusion==
The design of the Green Dot symbol has obvious links with the Chinese [[Taijitu]] ([[yin and yang]]) symbol and [[Gary Anderson (Recycling)|Gary Anderson]]'s [[recycling symbol]]. Where full-color printing is available, its official form is printed in a light and a dark shade of green ([[Pantone]] 366C and 343C). For cost reasons or to avoid a visual clash with other symbols, many manufacturers chose a black-and-white or other color combination on their packages.

The Green Dot logo merely indicates that a company has joined the Green Dot scheme, and not necessarily that the package is fully recyclable. The logo is often confused with the [[recycling]] logo.

==Lawsuits==
In Malta, Green Dot Malta Limited, a waste recovery company that is licensed from Der Grune Punkt Duales System Deutschland GmbH to use the Green Dot trademark in Malta, has successfully petitioned the Maltese courts on a number of occasions to protect the mark from free-riders and from competitors seeking to obtain unfair advantage from the international reputation and goodwill that it enjoys.

In February 2009, Smart Supermarket, a well established local supermarket based in [[Birkirkara]], [[Malta]], was ordered by a judge not to sell, manufacture or pack products bearing the trademark Green Dot without the necessary licenses. Green Dot Malta Limited had argued in court that the supermarket was not only blatantly infringing the trademark and contravening the Trademarks Act but was also taking unfair advantage of Green Dot's reputation and goodwill without having its authorisation. The First Hall of the Civil Court, presided over by Madam Justice Abigail Lofaro, upheld Green Dot Malta Limited's request and issued a warrant of prohibitory injunction. Lawyers Antoine Naudi and Victor G. Axiak appeared for Green Dot Malta Limited. Following this injunction, the two parties reached an agreement whereby Smart Supermarket entered into a royalty license agreement with Green Dot Malta Limited and registered all its own branded food items such as confectionery and freshly packed products. they agreed to cooperate. The two companies also agreed to cooperate in ensuring that the intellectual property rights relating to the Green Dot mark in Malta will be further protected from any unlawful use by third parties including suppliers of the various goods to the supermarket.

In April 2009, following a similar request for an injunction filed by Green Dot Malta Limited, the company Zamco Caterware Limited declared in open court that it was binding itself not to circulate any products in the market with the Green Dot symbol on their packaging without the required license. The company also declared that it would not be importing any product bearing the Green Dot mark unless the relative royalty contributions have been paid and unless they prove that the imported product will be recycled in terms of applicable environmental legislation.

In September 2009, Karta Converters Limited, a company which produces and distributes articles made of paper, cardboard and plastic, was ordered by the First Hall of the Civil Court not to manufacture, pack, sell or otherwise continue circulating in the local market products bearing the trademark “Green Dot” without the necessary licenses. Presiding Judge Dr. Geoffrey Valencia accepted Green Dot Malta Limited’s assertion that the company was conducting itself as a “free-rider” in the local market and that it was taking an unjust and unfair advantage of Green Dot’s reputation without having its consent. Following this injunction, Karta Converters Limited issued a press release whereby it declared that it would be adopting the internationally recognised Green Dot symbol on its paper, carton and plastic products in accordance with the law. Karta Converters also declared that it would be joining some three hundred other companies participating in GreenPak, a waste recovery scheme operated by Green Dot Malta Limited, for the recycling of its packaging.

Out of court settlements have been reached on a number of occasions with various other Maltese companies to ensure that the international reputation of the mark is safeguarded.

In May 2010, Green Dot Malta Limited won a court case against Green.Mt Ltd, a local competitor which operates another waste recovery scheme in Malta. The latter was incorporated in 2007, a few years after Green Dot Malta Limited’s registration. Green Dot Malta Limited petitioned the Court to declare that the name Green.Mt Ltd amounted to unfair competition in terms of law since the use of the “.” coupled with the words “Green Mt” was intended to cause confusion in the market.

In delivering judgment, Mr. Justice Raymond Pace stated that the two schemes were obviously direct competitors operating in the same field of activity and that the name Green.Mt Ltd was creating confusion in terms of article 32 of Chapter 13 of the Laws of Malta. The court held that the law laid down that businesses could not use any name, mark or symbol which could create confusion with another name, mark or symbol used legally by others. The imitation did not need to be perfect. It was enough that in its entirety it could deceive a consumer. The Judge said that an examination of the words used left him in no doubt that the names could and indeed were creating confusion amongst consumers. The Court thus ordered Green.Mt Ltd to pay Green Dot Malta Limited a nominal sum by way of penalty and to destroy any offending material in its possession bearing the name Green.Mt Ltd within 30 days from date of judgment. Dr. Antoine Naudi and Dr. Victor G. Axiak appeared for Green Dot Malta Limited. Before final judgment was delivered, Green.Mt Ltd changed its name to Green MT Ltd.

'''Greenbelt Knoll''' is a residential development in the [[Northeast Philadelphia|Northeast]] section of [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Planned and built from 1952 to 1957, it is notable as the first planned [[Racial integration|racially integrated]] development in Philadelphia and among the first in the [[United States]].

The developer, [[Morris Milgram]], a leader of the [[open housing]] movement, required that 55 percent of the homes be sold to whites, and 45 percent to non-whites.&lt;ref name=PW&gt;[http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/news-and-opinion/black_white_and_golden-38427864.html "Black, White and Golden. Greenbelt Knoll residents celebrate 50 years of historical significance,"] by Gwen Shaffer, ''Philadelphia Weekly'', June 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The first house sold in 1956 for $20,000. The isolated little neighborhood included its own swimming pool,  which was filled in circa 1985, leaving no trace above ground.&lt;ref name=NomForm&gt;[http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/document/913602/greenbelt_knoll_nr_draft_pdf Greenbelt Knoll Historic District nomination]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Eighteen (originally nineteen) one-story single-family homes are arranged in a heavily wooded [[cul de sac]] on Longford Street off Holme Avenue, surrounded on three sides by [[Pennypack Park]]. The simple wood-frame homes were designed in a [[Modern architecture|Modernist]] style by the [[architect]]ural firm of [[Montgomery &amp; Bishop]] in consultation with architects [[Louis Kahn]] and [[Harry Duncan]] and [[landscape architect]] [[Margaret Lancaster Duncan]].

Greenbelt Knoll won several awards for design excellence. For example, the American Institute of Architects, ''House and Home'', ''Better Homes and Gardens'', and the National Broadcasting Corporation bestowed its Homes for Better Living award on the development. Also, Philadelphia Mayor [[Richardson Dilworth]], an ardent advocate of exceptional planning and design, conferred a City of Philadelphia Tribute on Montgomery &amp; Bishop; he gave the tribute "for the design of Greenbelt Knoll Homes, which ... brought new standards of contemporary residential architecture to Philadelphia."&lt;ref name=NomForm/&gt;

==Notable residents==
The original residents included Milgram himself;&lt;ref name=PW/&gt; [[Robert N.C. Nix, Sr.]], the first African American to represent Pennsylvania in [[United States Congress|Congress]];&lt;ref name=PW/&gt; [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer Prize]]–winning African-American playwright [[Charles Fuller]], who grew up here;&lt;ref name=NomForm/&gt; the Rev. [[Leon Sullivan]], the civil rights activist, who developed the [[Sullivan Principles]] and hastened the end of [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]];&lt;ref name=PW/&gt; and Fire Captain Roosevelt Barlow, a civil rights activist who was one of a group of African-American firefighters to integrate the Philadelphia Fire Department.&lt;ref name=NomForm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/2003-07-17/news/25453475_1_black-firefighters-white-firefighters-entrance-exam "Roosevelt Barlow, 85, Phila. firefighter" (obituary)], Philadelphia ''Inquirer'', July 17, 2003, by Gayle Ronan Sims.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic designation==
Greenbelt Knoll was listed as a historic district on the [[Philadelphia Register of Historic Places]] in 2006&lt;ref name="PRHP districts"&gt;{{cite web|title=PRHP: List of historic districts|url=http://www.phila.gov/historical/base.html|publisher=Philadelphia Historical Commission|accessdate=03-12-2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2010. The site is marked with a plaque placed by the [[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-pennsylvania-historical-markers-include-native-american-archeological-sites-in-lancaster-and-a-masonic-temple-in-philadelphia-among-others-57957732.html New Pennsylvania Historical Markers Include Native American Archeological Sites in Lancaster and a Masonic Temple in Philadelphia Among Others]&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventeen of the existing homes are considered contributing properties; one home was completely rebuilt following a c. 1980 fire and is considered non-contributing. An additional lot (#17) is now open space, as the house was demolished 1997. Including the 5 detached garages, a studio, and the 2-acre community park that was part of the original neighborhood design, there are 26 resources: 22 contributing buildings and 1 contributing site (park), 2 non-contributing buildings and 1 non-contributing site (Lot #17). The development remains heavily wooded, and both the houses and landscape retain integrity.&lt;ref name=NomForm/&gt;

The '''''Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary''''' ('''''HTOED''''') is the print edition of the largest [[thesaurus]] in the world, the '''''Historical Thesaurus of English''''' ('''''HTE'''''), conceived and compiled by the English Language Department of the [[University of Glasgow]]. The ''HTE'' is a complete database of all the words in the second edition of [[Oxford English Dictionary|''The Oxford English Dictionary'']], arranged by [[semantic field]] and date. In this way, the ''HTE'' arranges the whole vocabulary of [[English language|English]], from the earliest written records in [[Old English language|Old English]] to the present, alongside types and dates of use. It is the first historical thesaurus to be compiled for any of the world's languages and contains 800,000 meanings for 600,000 words, within 230,000 categories, covering more than 920,000 words and meanings.&lt;ref name="Woolcock"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article6644646.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first=Nicola | last=Woolcock | title=After a 44-year labour of love worlds biggest thesaurus is born | date=2009-07-06}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hitchings|first1=Henry|authorlink1=Henry Hitchings|title=Historical Thesaurus is a masterpiece worth waiting 40 years for|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/6413166/Historical-Thesaurus-is-a-masterpiece-worth-waiting-40-years-for.html|accessdate=25 October 2014|publisher=The Telegraph|date=23 October 2009|ref=Hitchings-2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the ''HTE'' website states, "in addition to providing hitherto unavailable information for linguistic and textual scholars, the ''Historical Thesaurus'' online is a rich resource for students of social and cultural history, showing how concepts developed through the words that refer to them."&lt;ref name="hte"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historicalthesaurus.arts.gla.ac.uk/ |title=Home page |website=The Historical Thesaurus of English |publisher=University of Glasgow |accessdate=2014-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ambitious project was announced at a 1965 meeting of the [[Philological Society]] by its originator, [[Michael Samuels (academic)|Michael Samuels]].&lt;ref name=Crystal-2014&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crystal|first1=David|authorlink1=David Crystal|title=Words in Time and Place: Exploring Language Through the ''Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary''|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0199680477|page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Work on the ''HTE'' started in 1965.

On 22 October 2009, after 44 years of work, version 1.0 was published as a two-volume set as ''HTOED''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/8136122.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; Oxfordshire &amp;#124; Forty-year wait for new thesaurus |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-07-06 |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of two slipcased hardcover volumes, totaling nearly 4,000 pages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8111">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Langue'' and ''parole''}}
'''''Langue''''' ([[French language|French]], meaning "[[language]]") and '''''parole''''' (meaning "[[speaking]]") are [[linguistics|linguistic]] terms distinguished by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] in his ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]''. ''Langue'' encompasses the abstract, systematic rules and conventions of a [[signifying system]]; it is independent of, and pre-exists, individual users. ''Langue'' involves the principles of language, without which no meaningful utterance, "parole", would be possible.  ''Parole'' refers to the concrete instances of the use of ''langue''.  This is the individual, personal phenomenon of language as a series of [[speech acts]] made by a linguistic subject.&lt;ref&gt;de Saussure, F. (1986). Course in general linguistics (3rd ed.). (R. Harris, Trans.). Chicago: Open Court Publishing Company. (Original work published 1972). p. 9-10, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Saussure did not concern himself overly with ''parole''; however, the structure of ''langue'' is revealed through the study of ''parole''. The distinction is similar to that made about language by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], between ''energeia'' (active doing) and ''ergon'' (the product of that doing)&lt;ref&gt;"Language as a finished product, a set of tools forged for future use, is in fact a precipitate of the ongoing activity. It is created in speech, and is in fact being continuously recreated, extended, altered, reshaped. This Humboltdian notion is the basis for another famous contribution of Saussure, his distinction between ''langue'' and ''parole''." Charles Taylor, ''The Importance of Herder'', "Philosophical Arguments" (Harvard University Press, 1997), 97.&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as the distinction between ''language'' and ''speech'' made by [[Jan Baudouin de Courtenay]].&lt;ref&gt;Baudouin de Courtenay (1876–7), ''A detailed programme of lectures for the academic year 1876-77'', p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Saussure drew an analogy to chess to explain the concept of ''langue'' and ''parole''. He compared ''langue'' to the [[rules of chess]]—the norms for playing the game—and compared the moves that an individual chooses to make—the individual's preferences in playing the game—to the ''parole''.

==Langue==
When translated from the [[French language|French]] term ''langue'' can mean language. However, it is known Saussure intended the term to mean internal, arrangement and relationship of rules understood by a social group, however, rarely thought of in everyday life. ''Langue'' is believed to be a universal structure and, while it may have variations as seen in foreign languages, with principal linguistic patterns.

==Parole==
''Parole'' typically when it is translated means speech. Saussure, on the other hand, intended for it to mean both the written and spoken language as experienced in everyday life. It is the precise utterances and use of ''langue''. Therefore, ''parole'', unlike ''langue'', is as diverse and varied as the number of people who share a language and the number of utterances and attempts to use that language. Furthermore, ''parole'' is known to have been changed and manipulated by a number of causes for example time, social groups, and age of users.

==As a function==
The underlying basis to ''langue'' is the interpretation that it is made up of signs and not sentences. Signs are thought to have a two part aspect in that each sign relates a notion with a sound pattern (or a written symbol). A sign cannot exist as a single part for if there is a sound pattern without a notion the sound becomes only noise. Similarly, a notion cannot be communicated without a sound pattern.
The sound pattern for each notion can be extremely diverse and vice versa. For example, the notion of oneself may use the sound patterns of 'I' or 'me' while the sound pattern of 'rose' may have the notion of a flower or the past of 'rise'. The notion or sound pattern remains unchanged even if the other changes. It is by understanding the relationship of the two parts of a sign through ''langue'' that the gist of communication or ''parole'' may be understood. Without the understanding of ''langue'', ''parole'' would be meaningless sounds or symbols grouped together haphazardly.
Saussure used the example of chess to explain how ''langue'' and ''parole'' work together. ''Langue'' is the normative rules in a chess game while parole represents the individual's choice of moves. If one were to study the parole of a chess game an understanding could be derived but it would not be a universal understanding of chess. However, by studying the langue of a chess game the derived understanding may be applicable to further chess games.
Thus Saussure argued when studying language, especially a foreign language, it is more important to understand the ''langue'' than to gain a large vocabulary of ''parole'' so that sense may be made equal to that of native speaker.

==Course in general linguistics==
Saussure did not publish his notes in relation to linguistics and ''langue'' and ''parole''. Unfortunately Cours de linguistique générale was published after his death in 1916 (later translated into English in 1959 as ''Course in General Linguistics'') and was made up of remaining lecture notes by Saussure, course notes provided to students and notes taken by former students of his lectures he performed between 1907-1911 in Geneva. This was then published by two of his former colleagues Charles Bally and Albert Sechehaye. It was after this publication that the importance and revolutionary nature of his work truly was understood by linguists and philosophers of his time.
Reviews, commentaries and critics of both the ''Course in General Linguistics'' and original notes made by Saussure have revealed much controversy over time. One controversy is that many ideas and notions often accredited to Saussure may have been borrowed from other linguists and philosophers of the nineteenth century. Saussure's idea of language as a sign system had been proposed by other philosophers, however, he will always be known to have provided a strong, theoretical basis for a scientific approach to understanding language as a whole.

==Influence==
Saussure's ''langue'' and ''parole'' form one of the theoretical foundations of structuralism. ''Langue'' and ''parole'' have allowed structuralists to separately examine the broad structures and formations of literature as well as the individual words. Structuralists achieved this by making a distinction within literary works between the words on a page (''parole'') and the context behind these words (''langue''). Although the reader may appear to simply be reading the words in a book their ability to understand (or possibly misunderstand) the text is a result of a person's knowledge of the ''langue'' or rules of a certain language. Similarly, ''langue'' and ''parole'' have been highly influential in the study of the signs, termed semiotics. Saussure's most notable influence on semiotics was his belief that the rules and codes of a language (''langue'') are vital in interpreting and gaining an understanding of that language system, while individual utterances (''parole'') are of little significance. ''Langue'' and ''parole'' have also impacted the way language is taught. Since Saussure's terms have become well known, language teaching often emphasizes teaching the langue and how these rules are applied, rather than simply teaching the words of a certain language. Additionally, ''langue'' and ''parole'' have been applied to other fields of study. Anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss used Structuralism and ''langue'' and ''parole'' to understand myths and tales within a broader context. In this case parole is a single tale or myth, while langue is considered the broader range of tales and myths from within a series or group. These may be myths from the same community, time period or geographical location.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1471">[[File:Manhattan Plot.png|thumb|300px|An illustration of a Manhattan plot depicting several strongly associated risk loci]]
A '''Manhattan plot''' is a type of [[scatter plot]], usually used to display data with a large number of data-points - many of non-zero amplitude, and with a distribution of higher-magnitude values, for instance in [[Genome-wide association study|genome-wide association studies]] (GWAS).&lt;ref name=East&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20581876|doi=10.1038/ng0710-558|year=2010|last1=Gibson|first1=Greg|title=Hints of hidden heritability in GWAS |volume=42|pages=558–560|journal=Nature Genetics|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In GWAS Manhattan plots, genomic coordinates are displayed along the X-axis, with the negative [[logarithm]] of the association [[p-value|''P''-value]] for each [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) displayed on the Y-axis, meaning that each dot on the Manhattan plot signifies a SNP. Because the strongest associations have the smallest ''P''-values (e.g., 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt;), their negative logarithms will be the greatest (e.g., 15).

It gains its name from the similarity of such a plot to the [[Manhattan]] [[skyline]]: a profile of [[skyscrapers]] towering above the lower level "buildings" which vary around a lower height.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4445">A '''Martian scientist''' or '''Martian researcher''' is a hypothetical [[Martian]] frequently used in [[thought experiment]]s as an outside observer of conditions on [[Earth]]. The most common variety is the '''Martian [[anthropology|anthropologist]]''', but Martians researching subjects such as [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]] and [[biology]] have also been invoked.

The following extract from an essay by [[Richard Dawkins]] is more or less typical.
:''A Martian [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomist]] who didn't know that all human [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] happily interbreed with one another, and didn't know that most of the underlying [[genetics|genetic]] variance in our [[species]] is shared by all races might be tempted by our regional differences in skin colour, facial features, hair, body size and proportions to split us into more than one species.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins R]]. ''A Devil's Chaplain: Selected Essays''. Phoenix, London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson; 2003. {{ISBN|0-297-82973-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In American [[structuralism|structuralist]] [[linguistics]], the Martian approach is recommended for [[Descriptive linguistics|language description]]:
:''The descriptive analyst must be guided by certain very fixed [[principle]]s if he is to be [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] in describing accurately any [[language]] or part of any language. It would be excellent if he could adopt a completely man-from-Mars attitude toward any language he analyzes and describes.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene Nida|Nida E]]. ''Morphology: the descriptive analysis of words''. 2nd ed. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press; 1949. p 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothetical Martian anthropologist is described in the writings of [[Noam Chomsky]] as one who, upon studying the world's languages, would conclude that they are all dialects of a single language embodying a "[[universal grammar]]" reflecting a hardwired, genetically determined linguistic module inherent in the human brain.

In [[philosophy]], especially [[philosophy of language]] and [[philosophy of mind]], the Martian is often invoked as an example of an intelligent being with a cognitive apparatus that differs from that of humans, e.g. the following example given by [[Saul Kripke]]:

:''I will not here argue that simplicity is relative, or that it is hard to define, or that a Martian might find the quus function simpler than the plus function.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Saul Kripke|Kripke, Saul]].  ''Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language: An Elementary Exposition'', Harvard University Press. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

In a common [[rhetoric]]al turn, invoking the Martian scientist forces the reader to observe an obvious state of affairs that is ordinarily overlooked:
:''If a Martian graced our planet, it would be struck by one remarkable similarity among Earth's living creatures and a key difference.''&lt;ref&gt;Hauser MD, [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky N]], Fitch WT. The Faculty of Language: what is it, who has it, and how did it evolve? ''Science''. 2002;298(5598):1569-79. {{DOI|10.1126/science.298.5598.1569}} {{PMID|12446899}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(NB: The similarity Chomsky et al. mean is the universal hereditary language of DNA, while the difference is the lack of a universal language of communication.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10697">In [[operant conditioning]], the '''matching law''' is a quantitative relationship that holds between the relative rates of response and the relative [[rates of reinforcement]] in [[concurrent schedules of reinforcement]]. For example, if two response alternatives A and B are offered to an organism, the ratio of response rates to A and B equals the ratio of reinforcements yielded by each response.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Poling, A., Edwards, T. L., Weeden, M., &amp; Foster, T. (2011). The matching law. ''Psychological Record'', 61(2), 313-322.&lt;/ref&gt; This law applies fairly well when non-human subjects are exposed to concurrent [[reinforcement|variable interval]] schedules (but see below); its applicability in other situations is less clear, depending on the assumptions made and the details of the experimental situation. The generality of applicability of the matching law is subject of current debate.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, C., &amp; Baum, W. M. (2017). Allocation of Speech in Conversation. Journal of Experimental Analysis of Behavior, 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

The matching law can be applied to situations involving a single response maintained by a single schedule of reinforcement if one assumes that alternative responses are always available to an organism, maintained by uncontrolled "extraneous" reinforcers.  For example, an animal pressing a lever for food might pause for a drink of water.

The matching law was first formulated by [[R.J. Herrnstein]] (1961) following an experiment with [[pigeon]]s on concurrent variable interval schedules.&lt;ref&gt;Herrnstein, R.J. (1961). Relative and absolute strength of responses as a function of frequency of reinforcement. ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behaviour'', 4, 267–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Pigeons were presented with two buttons in a [[Skinner box]], each of which led to varying rates of food reward. The pigeons tended to peck the button that yielded the greater food reward more often than the other button, and the ratio of their rates to the two buttons matched the ratio of their rates of reward on the two buttons.

==Equations==

If ''R''{{sub|1}} and ''R''{{sub|2}} are the [[rate of response]]s on two schedules that yield obtained (as distinct from programmed) rates of reinforcement ''Rf''{{sub|1}} and ''Rf''{{sub|2}}, the strict matching law holds that the relative response rate ''R''{{sub|1}} / (''R''{{sub|1}} + ''R''{{sub|2}}) ''matches'', that is, equals, the relative reinforcement rate ''Rf''{{sub|1}} / (''Rf''{{sub|1}} + ''Rf''{{sub|2}}). That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2}=\frac{Rf_1}{Rf_1+Rf_2}&lt;/math&gt;

This relationship can also be stated in terms of response and reinforcement ratios:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{R_1}{R_2}=\frac{Rf_1}{Rf_2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Deviations from matching, and the generalized matching law==

A recent review by McDowell reveals that Herrnstein's original equation fails to accurately describe concurrent-schedule data under a substantial range of conditions.Three deviations from matching have been observed: undermatching, overmatching and bias. Undermatching means that the response proportions are less extreme than the law predicts. Undermatching can happen if subjects too often switch between the two response options, a tendency that may be strengthened by reinforcers that happen to occur just after a subject switches. A changeover delay may be used to reduce the effectiveness of such post-switch reinforcers; typically, this is a 1.5 second interval after a switch when no reinforcer is presented. Overmatching is the opposite of undermatching, and is less common. Here the subjects response proportions are more extreme than reinforcement proportions. Overmatching may occur if there is a penalty for switching. A final deviation is bias, which occurs when subjects spend more time on one alternative than the matching equation predicts.  This may happen if a subject prefers a certain environment, area in a laboratory or method of responding.

These failures of the matching law have led to the development of the "generalized matching law", which has parameters that reflect the deviations just described.  This law is a power function generalization of the strict matching (Baum, 1974), and it has been found to fit a wide variety of matching data.
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{R_1}{R_2}=b\left(\frac{Rf_1}{Rf_2}\right)^s&lt;/math&gt;

This is more conveniently expressed in logarithmic form
:&lt;math&gt;\log\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)=\log\left(b\right)+s\cdot\log\left(\frac{Rf_1}{Rf_2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The constants ''b'' and ''s'' are referred to as "bias" and "sensitivity" respectively. "Bias" reflects any tendency the subject may have to prefer one response over the other. "Sensitivity" reflects the degree to which the reinforcement ratio actually impacts the choice ratio. When this equation is plotted, the result is straight line; sensitivity changes the slope and bias changes the intercept of this line.

The ''generalized matching law'' accounts for high proportions of the variance in most experiments on concurrent variable interval schedules in non-humans. Values of ''b'' often depend on details of the experiment set up, but values of ''s'' are consistently found to be around 0.8, whereas the value required for strict matching would be 1.0.&lt;ref&gt;Baum, W.M. (1974). On two types of deviation from the matching law: Bias and undermatching. ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', 22, 231–42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davison, M. &amp; McCarthy, D. (1988). ''The matching law: A research review''. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processes underlying the distribution of responses==

There are three ideas on how humans and animals maximize reinforcement, molecular maximizing, molar maximizing and melioration.
* molecular maximizing: organisms always choose whichever response alternative is most likely to be reinforced at the time.
* molar maximizing: organisms distribute their responses among various alternatives so as to maximize the amount of reinforcement they earn over the long run.
* melioration: literally means to "make better"; organisms respond so as to improve the local rates of reinforcement for response alternatives. behavior keeps shifting towards the better of two alternatives until ratios are equal-which makes matching.

==Theoretical importance==

The matching law is theoretically important for several reasons. First, it offers a simple quantification of behavior that can be applied to a number of situations. Secondly, offers a lawful account of choice. As Herrnstein (1970) expressed it, under an operant analysis, choice is nothing but behavior set into the context of other behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Herrnstein, R.J. (1970). On the law of effect. ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', 13, 243–66.&lt;/ref&gt; The matching law thus challenges the idea that choice is an unpredictable outcome of [[free will]], just as [[B.F. Skinner]] and others have argued.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. (1971)Beyond Freedom and Dignity, New Yori:Knopf&lt;/ref&gt; However this challenge becomes serious only if it applies to human behavior, as well as to the behavior of pigeons and other animals. When human participants perform under concurrent schedules of reinforcement, matching has been observed in some experiments,&lt;ref&gt;Bradshaw, C.M.; Szabadi, E. &amp; Bevan, P. (1976). Behavior of humans in variable-interval schedules of reinforcement ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', 26, 135–41.&lt;/ref&gt; but wide deviations from matching have been found in others.&lt;ref&gt;Horne, P.J. &amp; Lowe, C.F. (1993). Determinants of human performance on concurrent schedules. ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', 59, 29–60. {{doi|10.1901/jeab.1993.59-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, if nothing else, the matching law is important because it has generated a great deal of research that has widened our understanding of operant control.

==Relevance to psychopathology==

The matching law, and the generalized matching law, have helped behavior analysts to understand some complex human behaviors, especially the behavior of children in certain conflict situations.&lt;ref&gt;Strand, P.S. (2001) Momentum, Matching, and Meaning: Toward a Fuller Exploitation of Operant Principles. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 2(3), 170–84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Snyder et al. 03"&gt;James Snyder, [[Michael Stoolmiller|Mike Stoolmiller]], Gerald R. Patterson, Lynn Schrepferman, Jessica Oeser, Kassy Johnson, and Dana Soetaert (2003): The Application of Response Allocation Matching to Understanding Risk Mechanisms in Development: The Case of Young Children's Deviant Talk and Play, and Risk for Early-Onset Antisocial Behavior.

(1995). Individualized differences in social aggression: A test of the reinforcement hypothesis in the natural environment. ''Behavior Therapy'', 26, 371–91.&lt;/ref&gt; This matching rate predicts future arrests. Even children's use of deviant talk appears to follow a matching pattern.&lt;ref name="Snyder et al. 03"/&gt;

{{Nationalism sidebar |Development|nocat=false}} 
A '''national language''' is a [[language]] (or [[variety (linguistics)|language variant]], e.g. [[dialect]]) that has some connection—[[de facto]] or [[de jure]]—with people and the territory they occupy. There is little consistency in the use of this term. One or more languages spoken as  [[first language]]s in the territory of a country may be referred to informally or designated in legislation as national languages of the country. National or [[national language]]s are mentioned in over 150 world constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca/index.html Jacques Leclerc, ''L'aménagement linguistique dans le monde'', CEFAN, Université Laval]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- it would be helpful to narrow this down to just the number of constitutions that mention "national language," or to be precise as to the number of constitutions mentioning each or both, and it would be helpful to look for better sources --&gt;

[[C.M.B. Brann]], with particular reference to India, suggests that there are "four quite distinctive meanings" for national language in a polity:&lt;ref&gt;Brann, C.M.B. 1994. "The National Language Question: Concepts and Terminology." ''Logos'' [University of Namibia, Windhoek] Vol 14: 125–134&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Territorial language" (''chthonolect'', sometimes known as ''chtonolect''&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, H. Ekkehard "African Languages: An Introduction Ch./Art: Language and Society p. 321 pub. Cambridge University Press 2000&lt;/ref&gt;) of a particular people
*"[[Regional language]]" (''choralect'')
*"Language-in-common or community language" (''demolect'') used throughout a country
*"Central language" (''politolect'') used by government and perhaps having a symbolic value.
The last is usually given the title of [[official language]].

[[Standard language]]s, such as [[Standard German]], [[Standard French]], and [[Standard Spanish]], may serve as national (language-in-common), regional, and international languages.

== Official versus national languages ==
{{See also|Linguistic prescription|Linguistic rights}}
"National language" and "[[official language]]" are best understood as two concepts or legal categories with ranges of meaning that may coincide, or may be intentionally separate. [[Stateless nation]]s are not in the position to legislate an [[official language]], but their languages may be sufficiently distinct and well-preserved to be national languages. Some languages may be recognized popularly as "national languages," while others may enjoy official recognition in use or promotion.

In many African countries, some or all indigenous [[African languages]] are officially used, promoted, or expressly allowed to be promoted (usually taught in schools and written in important publications) as semi-official languages whether by long-term legislation or short-term, case-by-case executive (government) measures. 
To be official, spoken and written languages may enjoy government or federalised use, major tax-funded promotion or at least full tolerance as to their teaching and employers' recognition in [[public education]], standing on equal footing with the official language(s). Further, they may enjoy recognition as a language used in compulsory schooling and treasury money may be spent to teach or encourage adults in learning a language which is a minority language in a particular area to restore its understanding and spread its moral stories, rhymes, poems, phrases, songs, and other literary heritage which will promote [[social cohesion]] (where other languages remain) or will promote [[nationalism|nationalist differentiation]] where another, non-indigenous language is deprecated.&lt;ref&gt;''20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language'' http://www.plean2028.ie/en/node/14{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Williams | first = Colin H. | editor-last = Coupland | editor-first = Nikolas | title = English in Wales: Diversity, Conflict, and Change | place = Clevedon, Avon | publisher = Multilingual Matters | year = 1990 | contribution = The Anglicisation of Wales | contribution-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tPwYt3gVbu4C&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=monoglot+welsh+speakers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=G1SHcB_0Rl&amp;sig=TiQ9apFsrgJiFz1ielo2OZCPRq8 | pages = 38–41 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tPwYt3gVbu4C&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;ots=G1SHcB_0Rl&amp;dq=monoglot%20welsh%20speakers&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While on the other hand, other Armenian communities such as the Armenian communities of Lebanon, Syria, Jerusalem etc. speak the Western Armenian dialect. |°

=== Australia ===
Australia has no [[official language]], but is largely [[monoglottism|monolingual]] with English being the ''de facto'' national language. A considerable proportion of first and second generation migrants are bilingual. According to Ethnologue, 81% of people spoke English at home, including [[second language|L2]] speakers. Other languages spoken at home included Chinese 2.9%, Italian 1.2%, Arabic 1.1%, Greek 1%, Vietnamese 0.9% and Spanish 0.4%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2011/quickstat/0&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Nationalisms in Canada|Bilingualism in Canada|Languages of Canada}}
[[Canada]]'s official languages since the [[Official Languages Act of 1969]] are [[English language|English]] ([[Canadian English]]) and [[French language|French]] ([[Canadian French]]).  Depending on one's views of what constitutes a "nation", these two languages may be considered two equal national languages of the nation of Canada, or the national languages of two nations within one state, [[English Canada]] and [[French Canada]].

[[Quebec nationalists]] consider [[Quebec French]] the language of the Quebec nation.

Two of Canada's northern territories legislate a variety of Indigenous languages. [[Nunavut]] holds [[Inuktitut]] and [[Inuinnaqtun]] as official languages, and [[Northwest Territories]] has nine official languages aside from English and French: [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Chipewyan language|Dënesųłiné]], [[Gwich’in language|Gwich’in]], Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, [[Slavey language|North and South Slavey]] and [[Dogrib language|Tłı̨chǫ]]. As these official languages are legislated at a territorial (sub-federal) level, they can be construed as national languages.

Besides these there many [[Aboriginal peoples of Canada|Indigenous languages of Canada]] which are the national languages of one or more of Canada's [[First Nations]] groups, [[Inuit]] and [[Metis people (Canada)|Métis]] (mixed First Nations-European peoples); a number of First Nations legislate at the Indigenous government levels their language as an official language of the Nation, such is the case with the [[Nisg̱a’a language]] in [[Nisg̱a’a]]. Notably the [[Cree language]] is spoken (with variations) from Alberta to Labrador,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} [[Ojibwe language|Anishinaabemowin]] is spoken across central Canada and Inuktitut is spoken across the arctic.

=== China ===
{{see also|Languages of China|Standard Chinese|History of Mandarin}}
There are many languages spoken across [[China]], with most people speaking one of several [[varieties of Chinese]]. During successive imperial dynasties, the spoken language of the capital city served as the official spoken language and was used across the country by government officials who traveled to communicate with one another. Dialects used for this purpose in different eras included those of [[Xi'an]], [[Luoyang]], [[Nanjing]], [[Beijing]], and [[Historical capitals of China|other historical capital cities]].

After the [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1911, the [[Kuomintang]] (Chinese nationalists) founded the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. In order to promote a sense of national unity and enhance the efficiency of communications within the nation, the government decided to designate a national language. The [[Beijing dialect]] of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Cantonese|Guangzhou dialect]] of [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] were each proposed as the basis for a national language for China.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} In the beginning, there were attempts to introduce elements from other Chinese varieties into the national language in addition to those from the Beijing dialect; this was reflected in the first official dictionary of the national language, given the name 國語 ([[Pinyin]]: Guóyǔ, literally "national language"). But this artificial language had no native speakers and was difficult to learn, so it was abandoned in 1924. Ultimately, the Beijing dialect was chosen as the national language and it continued to be referred to as 國語 in Chinese in the Republic of China. Since then, the Beijing dialect has become the main standard for pronunciation, due to its prestigious status during the preceding [[Qing Dynasty]].

Still, elements from other dialects do exist in the standard language, which is now defined as reflecting the pronunciation of Beijing, the grammatical patterns of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] dialects spoken in the northern parts of China, and the vocabulary of modern vernacular Chinese literature. The People's Republic of China renamed the national language 普通话 (Pinyin: Pǔtōnghuà, literally "common speech"), without otherwise changing the definition of the standard national language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[Singapore]] has four official languages: [[English language|English]] ([[Singapore English]]), [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]], [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. Although English is the primary language of business, government, and education, Malay is designated as the national language. This is due to the geographical and historical ties to [[Malaysia]] as well as the recognition of ethnic [[Malays in Singapore|Malays]] (about 14% of the population) as the indigenous people of Singapore.

Traditionally, the [[lingua franca]] among the different ethnic groups in Singapore was [[Malay trade and creole languages|Bazaar Malay]], a Malay-based [[Malay-based creole languages|creole]]. Since independence, the government has been promoting English as the main language of Singapore. The bilingual education policy requires students to study two languages: English and a "mother tongue" corresponding to the student's ethnicity. Malay is only offered to non-Malay students as an optional third language in secondary schools. As a result, English has displaced Bazaar Malay as the common language among Singaporeans. Therefore, despite the status of Malay as the national language, the majority doesn't speak it.

The '''New Orleans Saints bounty scandal''', widely dubbed "'''Bountygate''',"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=ycn-11050204|title='Bountygate' Details Get Uglier by the Moment|last=Silverman|first=Steve|date=2012-03-04|accessdate=2012-03-05|publisher=[[Yahoo!

The pool was alleged to have been in operation from [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|2009]] (the year in which the Saints won [[Super Bowl XLIV]]) to [[2011 New Orleans Saints season|2011]].

League commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] responded with some of the most severe sanctions in the league's 92-year history, and among the most severe punishments for in-game misconduct in North American professional sports history. Defensive coordinator [[Gregg Williams]] was suspended indefinitely, though this would be overturned the following year. Head coach [[Sean Payton]] was suspended for the entire [[2012 NFL season|2012 season]]—the first time since [[Chuck Fairbanks]] in 1978 that a head coach had been suspended. General manager [[Mickey Loomis]] was suspended for the first eight games of the 2012 season. Assistant head coach [[Joe Vitt]] was suspended for the first six games of the 2012 season. The Saints organization was penalized with a $500,000 fine and forced to forfeit their second-round draft selections in [[2012 NFL Draft|2012]] and [[2013 NFL Draft|2013]]. In May 2012, four current and former Saints players were suspended after being named as ringleaders in the scandal, with linebacker [[Jonathan Vilma]] also being suspended for the entire 2012 season.&lt;ref name="ESPNplayers"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7881761/nfl-bans-four-players-new-orleans-saints-bounty-roles|title=Jonathan Vilma banned one year|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, former commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]] overturned all sanctions against the players in December 2012 after finding that despite the players being "very much involved", the coaches and the Saints organization were primarily responsible for the scandal.&lt;ref name=Tagliabuevacate/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Gregg Williams at Tulane Commencement 2010.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Saints defensive coordinator [[Gregg Williams]]]]
The NFL has long frowned upon bounties, or "non-contract bonuses" as it officially calls them;  but an underground culture of bounties is alleged to exist, with teams, it is claimed,  [[turning a blind eye]] to the practice.  The league constitution specifically forbids payment of bonuses based on performances against an individual player or team, as well as bonuses for on-field misconduct; the NFL holds that such practices undermine the integrity of the game, and also would allow teams to use such payments to circumvent the [[salary cap]]. The [[collective bargaining agreement]] with the [[NFL Players Association]] also forbids this practice, as does the standard NFL player contract.&lt;ref name=NFLStatement/&gt; Every year, the NFL sends a memo reiterating this ban to every team before training camp opens. However, according to many former players, bounty systems of some sort have been around the NFL for decades, with the percentage of players participating non-scientifically estimated to be between 30 and 40 percent.&lt;ref name=Freeman2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/17595418/saints-took-common-practice-of-a-bounty-system-to-new-dangerous-level|title=Saints took common practice of bounties to new, dangerous level|last=Freeman|first=Mike|publisher=[[CBSSports.com]]|date=2012-03-05|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020180352/http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/17595418/saints-took-common-practice-of-a-bounty-system-to-new-dangerous-level|archivedate=2012-10-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   According to these players, such bounty programs were usually informal and often between players only, more with intent at locker-room braggadocio than systemic malice.  What would draw attention to the Saints' bounty program was the alleged practice of methodically organizing such a concept at the coaches' level, with the primary intent to systematically and routinely injure opposing star players.

After the Saints defeated the [[Minnesota Vikings]] in the [[2009–10 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: New Orleans Saints 31, Minnesota Vikings 28 (OT)|NFC Championship Game]], several Vikings players and coaches claimed that the Saints were deliberately trying to hurt Vikings quarterback [[Brett Favre]]. The Vikings were particularly angered when Saints defensive end [[Bobby McCray]] and defensive tackle [[Remi Ayodele]] knocked Favre to the ground with a high-low hit. McCray hit Favre below the knees, briefly knocking Favre out of the game with an ankle injury. No penalty was called on the play, though NFL vice president of officiating [[Mike Pereira]] said one should have been called, saying it was "the type of hit we don't want." Vikings coach [[Brad Childress]] later said that there were at least 13 instances where he felt the Saints deliberately went after Favre. Later, [[CBSSports.com]] NFL columnist Clark Judge said several Vikings assistants told him they believed McCray was acting on direct orders from Williams, with at least one being so outraged that he threatened to "punch [Williams] in the face" the next time they met.&lt;ref name=ClarkJudge&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/17546706/saints-team-officials-involved-in-bounty-program-should-pay-dearly|title=Saints, team officials involved in bounty program should pay dearly|last=Judge|first=Clark|publisher=[[CBSSports.com]]|date=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vikings owner [[Zygi Wilf]] even went as far as to complain to the league about what happened to Favre, though no action was taken at the time.&lt;ref name=Seifert&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/39041/saints-shots-at-brett-favre-were-no-secret|title=Saints' shots at Favre were no secret|last=Seifert|first=Kevin|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Favre took such a severe beating that Vikings punter [[Chris Kluwe]] and placekicker [[Ryan Longwell]] wondered during the game if someone had put a bounty on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/39907/chris-kluwe-ban-jonathan-vilma-for-life|title=Chris Kluwe: Ban Jonathan Vilma for life|last=Seifert|first=Kevin|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Favre's agent, Bus Cook, later said that he also felt the Saints were deliberately trying to knock Favre out of the game, and claimed that several hits on [[Arizona Cardinals]] quarterback [[Kurt Warner]] in the divisional round a week earlier crossed the line as well.&lt;ref name=ESPNBounty&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7638603/new-orleans-saints-defense-had-bounty-program-nfl-says|title=NFL: Saints defense had 'bounty' fund|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It initially appeared that Cook's argument was strengthened by the fact that Warner was knocked out of that game with a chest injury (although he later returned), and retired two weeks later. However, Warner later said that the hit which knocked him out was legal, and had nothing to do with his decision to retire.&lt;ref name=Warner&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcwest/post/_/id/59989/warner-saints-hit-legal-not-career-ending|title=Warner: Saints hit legal, not career-ending|last=Bando|first=Sal|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==

[[File:Roger Goodell at Super Bowl 43.jpg|thumb|right|100px|NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]]]]
In the 2010 offseason, an anonymous player told NFL officials that the Saints had targeted Favre and Warner as part of a bounty program administered by Williams; the NFL's security department found the allegations credible enough to open an investigation. However, the players and team officials interviewed all denied that any bounty program existed, and the player who made the initial report subsequently recanted his allegations.&lt;ref name=NFLStatement/&gt;&lt;ref name=King&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/peter_king/03/02/saints.bounties/index.html|title=Saints looking at severe punishment for bounty system|last=King|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter King (sportswriter)|publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFL began investigating the Saints in 2010 in response to allegations of deliberate attempts to injure players during the [[2009–10 NFL playoffs|2009–10 playoffs]], but the investigation stalled until late in the 2011 season. On March 2, 2012, the NFL announced that it had evidence that [[defensive coordinator]] [[Gregg Williams]] had created the program soon after his arrival in 2009, and alleged that "between 22 and 27 Saints players" were involved.&lt;ref name=NFLStatement&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2012/03/full_nfl_statement_into_bounty.html|title=Full NFL statement on bounty investigation|author=[[National Football League]]|date=2012-03-02|accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams and the players pooled their own money to pay out performance bonuses. It also asserted that head coach [[Sean Payton]] tried to cover up the scheme, and that he and general manager [[Mickey Loomis]] failed to shut it down when ordered to do so by team owner [[Tom Benson]]. Since then, Williams has been accused of operating similar schemes during his tenure as defensive coordinator of the [[Tennessee Titans|Tennessee Oilers/Titans]] and [[Washington Redskins]] and as head coach of the [[Buffalo Bills]]; the NFL briefly investigated these allegations but elected to focus on the Saints.

==Whistleblower==

In 2012, ESPN reported that former New Orleans Saints defensive assistant Mike Cerullo contacted the NFL regarding a bounty program after the 2009 postseason. &lt;ref name=Barr1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/8744952/mike-cerullo-former-new-orleans-saints-assistant-sends-letter-former-nfl-commissioner-paul-tagliabue|title=Mike Cerullo: I've been 'vilified'|last=Barr|first=John|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cerullo was released after the 2009 postseason for poor performance and lying about personal leave according to the New Orleans Saints.&lt;ref name=Katzenstein1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2017/12/sean_payton_mike_cerullo.html|title=Sean Payton: NFL hiring of bounty whistleblower Mike Cerullo 'unbelievable'|last=Katzenstein|first=Josh|publisher=[[NOLA.com]]|date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cerullo testified that he kept track of payments and pledges made. Cerullo also states in the article, "I was angry for being let go from the Saints". In the summer of 2017, the NFL hired Mike Cerullo as Director of Football Administration. &lt;ref name=Katzenstein2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2017/12/sean_payton_mike_cerullo.html|title=Sean Payton: NFL hiring of bounty whistleblower Mike Cerullo 'unbelievable'|last=Katzenstein|first=Josh|publisher=[[NOLA.com]]|date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Findings revealed==
Late in the 2011 season, the NFL received what it called "significant and credible new information" that suggested there was indeed a "bounty" program in place.&lt;ref name=NFLStatement/&gt; League officials, convinced that this information was irrefutable evidence a program was indeed in place, alerted Benson of their findings just before the Saints' first-round playoff game against the [[Detroit Lions]].&lt;ref name=KingOutofBounds&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.si.com/vault/issue/1009529/62/2|title=Way out of Bounds|last=King|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter King (sportswriter)|publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation continued during the [[2011–12 NFL playoffs|2011–12 playoffs]] and continued through the 2012 offseason.

On March 2, 2012, [[ESPN]]'s [[Adam Schefter]] reported that the NFL had indeed found evidence of a bounty program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=espn:7638694|title=Saints D Kept Bounty Fund|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, the NFL announced it had obtained irrefutable proof of a bounty pool dating back to the 2009 season, based on a review of 18,000 documents. It determined that Williams had initiated the fund soon after he arrived in New Orleans in 2009, in hopes of making the defense more aggressive. Between 22 and 27 Saints defensive players were involved. The players and Williams contributed their own cash to the pot, and received cash payments based on their performance in the previous week's game. For instance, a [[special teams|special teamer]] who downed a kick returner inside the receiving team's 20-yard-line earned $100. Players could also be fined for mental mistakes and penalties. Players also received "bounties" for "cart-offs" (plays in which an opponent was removed from the field on a stretcher or cart) and "knockouts" (plays that resulted in a player being unable to return for the rest of the game). Players usually earned $1,000 for "cart-offs" and $1,500 for "knockouts" during the regular season, though they were encouraged to put their winnings back into the pot in order to raise the stakes as the season went on. Payments were known to double or even triple during the playoffs.&lt;ref name=NFLStatement/&gt;&lt;ref name=KingOutofBounds/&gt;&lt;ref name=NFLPenalties&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d827c15b2/article/nfl-announces-management-discipline-in-saints-bounty-matter|title=NFL announces management discipline in Saints' 'bounty' matter|work=NFL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFL sent a confidential and detailed memo to all 32 teams detailing its findings. It revealed that the Saints had not only targeted Warner and Favre during the 2009 playoffs, but had also targeted [[Green Bay Packers]] quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] and [[Carolina Panthers]] quarterback [[Cam Newton]] during the 2011 regular season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcsouth/post/_/id/32684/nfl-saints-targeted-cam-newton|title=NFL: Saints targeted Cam Newton|last=Yasinskas|first=Pat|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to that memo, Saints linebacker [[Jonathan Vilma]] offered $10,000 cash to any teammate who knocked Favre out of the NFC Championship Game.&lt;ref name=King/&gt; Another source told CBSSports.com's Mike Freeman that [[Reggie Bush]]'s agent at the time, Michael Ornstein, was closely involved in the scheme from the beginning. Ornstein contributed $10,000 to the pot in 2009, and an undisclosed amount in 2011.&lt;ref name=Freeman1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mike-freeman.blogs.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/6264363/35066335|title=NFL memo details more Saints bounty accusations|last=Freeman|first=Mike|publisher=[[CBSSports.com]]|date=2012-03-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306043855/http://mike-freeman.blogs.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/6264363/35066335|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After later investigations in the 2012 offseason, the NFL also found evidence that the Saints put a bounty on then-[[Seattle Seahawks]] quarterback, [[Matt Hasselbeck]] during their 2011 wild-card playoffs game.

The league found that Payton not only knew about the scheme, but tried to cover it up during both league investigations. During the 2010 investigation, Payton told Williams and Vitt to "make sure our ducks are in a row" when the league interviewed them. Before the start of the 2011 season, Payton received an email from Ornstein detailing the broader lines of the scheme. In that same email, Ornstein offered $5,000 to anyone who knocked Rodgers out of the 2011 season opener. Payton initially denied knowing that this email existed, but subsequently admitted that in fact he had read it.&lt;ref name=KingOutofBounds/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freeman1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2012/03/mike_ornsteins_association_wit.html|title=Mike Ornstein's association with New Orleans Saints and bounty scandal a perplexing situation|last=Duncan|first=Jeff|publisher=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ESPNPenaltyAnnouncement&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7718136/sean-payton-new-orleans-saints-banned-one-year-bounties|title=NFL hammers Saints for bounties|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Benson was informed of the league's findings, he called in Payton and Loomis and ordered the program shut down immediately. However, they did not do so. Loomis had been interviewed during the 2010 investigation as well, and had stated that he knew of no such scheme and would stop it immediately if it was taking place. The league also found that Vitt, whom Payton had assigned to monitor Williams (the two reportedly didn't get along very well), also knew about the broader lines of the scheme and even witnessed Williams handing out payments to players. However, Vitt failed to tell anyone about it.&lt;ref name=NFLStatement/&gt;&lt;ref name=NFLPenalties/&gt;

The NFL found that Payton and Loomis' [[misfeasance]] amounted to "conduct detrimental" to the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82757bcd/article/nfl-says-saints-created-bounty-program-from-20092011|title=NFL says Saints created 'bounty' program from 2009–2011|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFL found no club money had been used to fund the bounty pool, and praised Benson for doing what he could to shut down the slush fund. Nonetheless, it found the Saints organization as a whole guilty of conduct detrimental to the league as well due to Williams and the players' maintenance of the bounty pool, as well as Loomis and Payton's failure to act "in a responsible manner" to stop it.&lt;ref name=NFLPenalties/&gt;&lt;ref name=KingMarch5&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/peter_king/03/05/offseason/index.html|title=As bounty fallout continues, Goodell to make example of Saints|last=King|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter King (sportswriter)|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[Chicago Bears]] players and fans believe that the Bears were targets of this program during the second game of the 2011 season, a 30–13 loss to the Saints. Quarterback [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] was sacked six times, and nearly lost his voice when a Saints player kicked him in the throat. Later in the game, offensive tackle [[Frank Omiyale]] yanked a Saints defender off Cutler when he saw what he later called "some dirty stuff."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright |first=Michael C. |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/chicago/bears/post/_/id/4675326/bears-wonder-if-saints-targeted-them |title=Bears wonder if Saints targeted them |publisher=[[ESPN|ESPN Chicago]] |date= |accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] quarterback [[Josh Freeman]] reported that the Saints' tendency toward illegal hits was common knowledge among the Tampa Bay coaching staff. Preparations for Saints games included warnings to offensive players to keep their knees protected, especially on plays near the sidelines.&lt;ref&gt;Stroud, Rick. "Josh Freeman says Tampa Bay Buccaneers were warned about New Orleans Saints' 'cheap shots'". ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]''. 6 Mar 2012. [http://www.tampabay.com/sports/football/bucs/josh-freeman-says-tampa-bay-buccaneers-were-warned-about-new-orleans/1218483]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, the league revealed that it possessed a [[ledger]] detailing the weekly earnings of the players, which are earned for cart-offs ($1000) and "whacks" ($400) and deducted for "mental errors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Cole|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--sources--new-orleans-saints-kept-a--ledger--detailing-weekly-earnings-in-bounty-scandal.html|title=Sources: New Orleans Saints kept a 'ledger' detailing weekly earnings in bounty scandal|publisher=Sports.yahoo.com|date=2012-06-27|accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82982f9f/article/report-saints-ledger-shows-cartoffs-worth-1k?module=HP11_headline_stack|title=Report: Saints Ledger Shows Cart-offs Worth 1K|publisher=NFL.com|date=June 1, 2012|accessdate=2012-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on July 26, 2012, Vilma and seven witnesses from the Saints testified in front of a federal judge in New Orleans that NFL commissioner Roger Goodell got his facts wrong in the bounty scandal."Everybody was sworn in under oath in front of a judge with the risk of perjury and jail time if we were lying, and categorically denied there was a bounty," Vilma said in a text message to ESPN's [[Ed Werder]]. "Seven people testified, 2 sworn affidavits (one by Drew Brees) all saying the same thing. I ask that you and ESPN report the facts. No more bias or b.s. or hearsay. I gave you facts that you can report if so choose."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8202975/new-orleans-saints-linebacker-jonathan-vilma-testifies|title=New Orleans Saints linebacker Jonathan Vilma testifies|work=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tulane University Sports Law Program Director Gabe Feldman (who attended the hearing in court) said, "Clearly the judge, by her questions, indicated she thinks Goodell overstepped his authority, and this case was always going to be about if he executed his power fairly... The NFL's retort is that with all due deference, you don't get to second guess (commissioner Roger Goodell). Judges only have limited jurisdiction over arbitration issues."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2012/07/new_orleans_saints_linebacker_39.html|title=New Orleans Saints linebacker Jonathan Vilma does not receive restraining order, still hopeful for favorable ruling|work=NOLA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saints All-Pro quarterback Drew Brees made a somewhat controversial tweet on June 20, 2012 stating, "If NFL fans were told there were "weapons of mass destruction" enough times, they'd believe it. But what happens when you don't find any????" Brees immediately issued another statement to clarify, "My WMD comment has nothing to do with politics or our brave military. Merely an analogy to show how media influences public perception." He went on to say, "I apologize if the WMD comment offended anyone. Especially our military. There is no one I respect more than our service men and women."&lt;ref name="klopman1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/20/drew-brees-wmd-tweet-apologizes-saints-bounty_n_1613163.html|work=Huffington Post|first=Michael|last=Klopman|title=NFL Star Apologizes For Controversial 'WMD' Tweet|date=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other allegations against Williams==
Shortly after the Saints' bounty system came to light, four former [[Washington Redskins]] players, as well as a coach, told ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that Williams operated a similar system while he was the Redskins' defensive coordinator from 2004 to 2007. The players said that Williams paid his crew thousands of dollars for aggressive play, with the biggest payouts—as much as $8,000—coming for "kill shots" that knocked opposing players out of games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/redskins/washington-redskins-offered-bounties-for-big-hits-under-former-assistant-coach-gregg-williams/2012/03/02/gIQAH0RlnR_story.html|title=Washington Redskins offered bounties for big hits under former assistant coach Gregg Williams|last=Maske|first=Mark|publisher=The Washington Post|date=2012-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' NFL analyst [[Matt Bowen (American football)|Matt Bowen]], who played for the Redskins at the time, later wrote in one of his regular columns that the bounty pool was funded by fines for mistakes made during practice and in games, and insisted similar systems operated on other teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-0304-bowen-nfl--20120304,0,4015992.column|title=Bounties part of game across the NFL|last=Bowen|first=Matt|authorlink=Matt Bowen (American football)|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=2012-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 4, ''The Post'' reported that the NFL was investigating the allegations against Williams with the Redskins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/redskins/nfl-to-investigate-redskins-over-bounty-allegations/2012/03/03/gIQAwS9XpR_story.html|title=NFL to investigate Redskins over bounty allegations under Gregg Williams|last=Maske|first=Mark|work=The Washington Post|date=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several former Bills players subsequently told ''[[The Buffalo News]]'' of a similar system during Williams' tenure as Bills' head coach from 2001 to 2003. However, they didn't agree on whether there were rewards for intentionally injuring players. [[Coy Wire]], a safety during Williams' tenure, said that Williams gave bonuses for hits that left opponents seriously injured, and two other players said that bonuses were also awarded for "knockouts." However, linebacker [[Eddie Robinson (linebacker)|Eddie Robinson]], who played for Williams in Houston and Tennessee as well as in Buffalo, acknowledged an incentive pool but said he never heard Williams favor deliberately injuring other players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/sports/bills-nfl/article747663.ece|title=Bills had bounty system under Gregg Williams, players say|last=Graham|first=Tim|publisher=[[The Buffalo News]]|date=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruben Brown]], a guard for the Bills during Williams's time as coach there, denied there was any sort of bounty system in place in Buffalo,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wgrz.com/news/article/158807/37/Ruben-Brown-says-Bills-Didnt-Run-Bounty-System Ruben Brown says Bills didn't run bounty system] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120918070810/http://www.wgrz.com/news/article/158807/37/Ruben-Brown-says-Bills-Didnt-Run-Bounty-System |date=2012-09-18 }}.

Former NFL coach [[Tony Dungy]] later told [[Profootballtalk.com]] he was certain that Williams operated a similar bounty system while he was defensive coordinator of the Oilers/Titans from 1997 to 2000. He also believes that Williams put a bounty on [[Indianapolis Colts]] quarterback [[Peyton Manning]] during Super Bowl XLIV, and targeted Manning on several occasions while with the Titans. The revelation of the bounty system also caused renewed speculation about a 2006 game between the Redskins and Colts, in which Manning was knocked down by a high-low hit from the Redskins' [[Phillip Daniels]] and [[Andre Carter]] and appeared to lose some feeling in his neck. While Dungy didn't speculate at the time about whether the Redskins targeted Manning on that play, he believes that hit ultimately caused the neck problems that sidelined Manning for the entire 2011 season and led to his departure for the [[Denver Broncos]] afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/03/02/dungy-titans-had-a-bounty-on-peyton-manning|title=Dungy: Titans had a bounty on Peyton Manning|last=Florio|first=Mike|publisher=[[Profootballtalk.com]]/[[NBC Sports]]|date=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former safety [[Ryan Clark (American football)|Ryan Clark]], who played under Williams in Washington from 2004–2005 and himself was fined by the NFL $40,000 for a helmet-to-helmet hit against [[Baltimore Ravens]] tight end [[Ed Dickson]] during the 2011 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7212307/ryan-clark-pittsburgh-steelers-fined-40k-takes-jab-roger-goodell|title=Ryan Clark of Pittsburgh Steelers fined $40K, takes jab at Roger Goodell|publisher=Espn.go.com|date=2011-11-10|accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; defended Williams, saying that he never ran a bounty program with the Redskins and has yet to see one during his time in the NFL.

==Aftermath==
Williams, who left after the season to become defensive coordinator of the [[St. Louis Rams]], was summoned to NFL headquarters after the investigation concluded in mid-February. He initially denied any involvement, but recanted and admitted everything in a meeting with Goodell.&lt;ref name=KingOutofBounds/&gt; After the story broke, Williams issued a statement calling his involvement "a terrible mistake." Williams said that he knew all along the slush fund broke the rules, and that "I should have stopped it" rather than get further involved.&lt;ref name=ESPNBounty/&gt; Goodell said in a statement that he found it "particularly disturbing" that the Saints were deliberately trying to injure other players. He said that players and coaches involved in the scheme could face fines or suspensions, and the Saints could be docked picks in the [[2012 NFL Draft]] and future drafts.&lt;ref name=NFLStatement/&gt;&lt;ref name=ESPNBounty/&gt;

Benson issued a statement on the Saints' Website saying, "I have been made aware of the NFL’s findings relative to the “Bounty Rule” and how it relates to our club. I have offered and the NFL has received our full cooperation in their investigation. While the findings may be troubling, we look forward to putting this behind us and winning more championships in the future for our fans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neworleanssaints.com/news-and-events/article-1/Statement-From-Saints-Owner-Tom-Benson/76e57e46-fa7a-4594-b522-ae05a60b8a4b |title=Statement From Saints Owner Tom Benson |publisher=[[New Orleans Saints]]|date=2012-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 3, [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]' [[Jay Glazer]] reported that the NFL intended to hand down penalties before the owners' meeting in late March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/video/NFL?vid=60c358ee-8239-4b7e-993c-03d808b0e978|title=Goodell plans swift justice for Saints bounty hunters|last=Glazer|first=Jay|authorlink=Jay Glazer|publisher=[[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]|date=2012-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFLPA asked the league to delay any sanctions until the union could conduct its own investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7681965/nflpa-asks-nfl-delay-new-orleans-saints-punishment-allow-investigation|title=Union asks for Saints discipline delay|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBSSports.com's Pat Kirwan [[Twitter|tweeted]] that within hours of the NFL releasing its report, lawyers for several players were already telling him that their clients were considering legal action against the Saints and Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2012/3/2/2840419/new-orleans-saints-bounty-program-lawsuits/in/2604084|title=Players Injured By New Orleans Saints Could Take Legal Action|last=McCauley|first=Kevin|publisher=[[SB Nation]]|date=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[San Francisco 49ers]] quarterback [[Steve Young]], who has a law degree from [[J.

A Colorado court ruled against Hackbart, saying violence was part of the game. However, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|10th Circuit Court of Appeals]] disagreed, saying that "the general customs of football" do not include deliberately attempting to injure opposing players.&lt;ref name=FoxLegal&gt;{{cite news|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/gregg-williams-new-orleans-saints-bounty-issue-may-have-legal-implications-for-nfl-030812|title=Bounty issue could be NFL legal problem|last=Perez|first=A.

On March 6, Payton and Loomis issued a statement taking "full responsibility" for not stopping the alleged "bounty" program. Payton and Loomis also apologized to Benson and the Saints fans, and promised that such behavior would never happen again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neworleanssaints.com/news-and-events/article-1/Joint-Statement-from-Saints-Executive-VPGeneral-Manager-Mickey-Loomis--HC-Sean-Payton-/de51300a-8219-4508-8eae-2b060c2a45bb |title=Joint Statement from Saints Executive VP/General Manager Mickey Loomis &amp; HC Sean Payton |publisher=[[New Orleans Saints]]|date=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, [[Drew Brees]], the starting quarterback for the Saints, issued a statement denying any knowledge of or involvement in the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/brees-says-had-no-knowledge-saints-bounties-222603098.html|title=Brees says he had no knowledge of Saints’ bounties|last=Farrar|first=Doug|date=10 March 2012|publisher=Yahoo!

He also said that unless the leagues themselves "come up with standards to make sure this isn't going to happen again," he may consider drafting legislation that would extend federal sports bribery laws to cover bounties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7722853/new-orleans-saints-senator-dick-durbin-sets-hearing-bounties-nfl|title=Senate to hold hearing on bounties|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 5, documentary filmmaker [[Sean Pamphilon]] released audio of a meeting Williams held with his defense before their 2012 divisional playoff game against the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. In a profanity-laced speech, Williams instructed his players to deliberately try to injure several 49ers players. He ordered his men to try to knock out running back [[Kendall Hunter]], even if it meant hitting him out of bounds. He specifically directed them to try to [[Anterior cruciate ligament injury|tear]] wide receiver [[Michael Crabtree]]'s [[anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]], injure tight end [[Vernon Davis]]' ankles and go after kick returner [[Kyle Williams (wide receiver)|Kyle Williams]] specifically because he had a history of concussions. He also appeared to put a bounty on quarterback [[Alex Smith]]; according to Pamphilon, after Williams told his men to hit Smith in the chin, "then he rubs his thumb against his index and middle fingers – the cash sign – and says, ''I got the first one. I got the first one. Go get it. Go lay that motherfucker out.''" Pamphilon, who was doing a documentary on [[Steve Gleason]] and his fight against Lou Gehrig's Disease, released the audio to [[Yahoo!

==Sanctions==
===Coaches and front office staff===

* Williams was suspended indefinitely, and was banned from applying for reinstatement until the end of the 2012 season at the earliest.
* Payton was suspended for the entire 2012 season, effective April 1. He is the first head coach in modern NFL history to be suspended for any reason.
* Loomis was suspended for the first eight games of the 2012 season.
* Vitt, who had been tabbed as a possible candidate to serve as interim coach in Payton's absence, was suspended for the first six games of the 2012 season.&lt;ref name=NFLPenalties/&gt;&lt;ref name=ESPNPenaltyAnnouncement/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcsouth/post/_/id/32658/candidates-to-coach-the-saints|title=Candidates to coach the Saints|last=Yasinkas|first=Pat|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This did not automatically disqualify Vitt from serving as interim head coach ''per se'', as his suspension was not effective until the regular season; the suspension terms allowed him to coach the team through training camp and the preseason, then return during Week 7.

The Saints were also fined $500,000—the maximum fine permitted under the league constitution, and had to forfeit their second-round draft picks in 2012 and 2013 (their first-round pick in 2012 had already been traded to the [[New England Patriots]], and therefore, could not be forfeited; after the penalty; the Saints' first pick in the [[2012 NFL Draft]] is a third-rounder)&lt;ref name=NFLPenalties/&gt;&lt;ref name=ESPNPenaltyAnnouncement/&gt; He also gave the league's clubs until March 30, 2012 to certify in writing that they do not have bounty programs.

In a statement, Goodell said that the NFL would not tolerate "conduct or a culture" that put player safety at risk. He also said that the fact that the scheme went on for three years demanded that "a strong and lasting message must be sent that such conduct is totally unacceptable and has no place in the game."&lt;ref name=NFLPenalties/&gt; He was particularly upset that those involved had lied about the scheme on two separate investigations, and had denied that there was ever a bounty program in place. In an interview with [[NFL Network]]'s [[Rich Eisen]], Goodell said that the threat to player safety, as well as the fact the Saints lied about it, demanded significant punishment. "I don't think you can be too hard on people that put at risk our players' health and safety," Goodell told Eisen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d827c28ff/article/goodell-sounds-off-on-saints-bounty-penalties|title=Commissioner Goodell says NFL was misled in 'bounty' probe|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reiterated this in an interview later that day with ESPN's Schefter, saying that the fact those involved "continued to mislead" the league about it was a significant factor in the sanctions. "You have to be accountable and responsible in the NFL," Goodell said. Goodell also implied that Payton would have faced significant punishment in any event, since his contractual obligation to supervise his assistants meant that he at least should have known about the scheme. He also said that there would be zero tolerance for payments for in-game performance in the future, saying that payments for good play eventually escalate to bounties for deliberately injuring players.&lt;ref name=GoodellSchefter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=7719075|title=Goodell talks punishments|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Schefter said on ESPN's [[SportsCenter]] that league officials felt Payton was at least as guilty as Williams, despite initial focus on Williams' role as the mastermind in the scheme.

On March 30, Payton, Vitt and Loomis appealed their suspensions, and the Saints also appealed the fine and loss of draft picks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/18164762/saints-payton-to-appeal-yearlong-suspension-on-friday|title=Saints, Payton, GM Loomis, assistant Vitt appealing bounty penalties|publisher=[[CBSSports.com]]|date=2012-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Payton, Vitt and Loomis met with Goodell on April 5. After that meeting, Vitt's lawyer, David Cornwell, said that Payton and Loomis met with Williams before the divisional playoff game and ordered him to shut down the bounty program immediately. Cornwell contended that Williams was a "rogue coach," and the recently released audio of his meeting with the defense only proved it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8281b86a/article/attorney-for-saints-joe-vitt-says-gregg-williams-went-rogue|title=Attorney for Saints' Joe Vitt says Gregg Williams went 'rogue'|last=Wyche|first=Steve|publisher=NFL.com|date=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodell denied the appeals on April 9, meaning that Payton's suspension began as of April 16. However, depending on the Saints' cooperation and that of the individuals involved, Goodell could restore the Saints' second-round pick in 2013 (though the Saints would still lose a lower-round pick), as well as reduce the fine on the Saints and restore Payton, Vitt and Loomis' lost pay. However, all appeals were denied&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7792405/nfl-upholds-suspension-new-orleans-saints-sean-payton-mickey-loomis-joe-vitt|title=NFL denies Saints' appeals|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Players===
The NFLPA requested that the league should hold off on any punishments for the players until it conducts its own investigation.&lt;ref name=ESPNPenaltyAnnouncement/&gt; Goodell told Schefter, however, that he would hand down punishments to the players involved very soon once he gets feedback from the NFLPA.&lt;ref name=GoodellSchefter/&gt;

Hours after the sanctions were announced, Kluwe went on [[KSTP (AM)|KSTP]] in the Twin Cities and demanded that any players involved in the scheme be severely punished, and that the NFLPA let it be known that "there's no place in the league for that kind of behavior." He even went as far as to call for Vilma—the only player specifically named as being involved in the scheme in the NFL's initial announcements—to be banned from the league for life.&lt;ref name=Zulgad&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.1500espn.com/sportswire/Zulgad_Chris_Kluwe_thinks_Jonathan_Vilma_should_be_banned_from_NFL032212|title=Chris Kluwe thinks Jonathan Vilma should be banned from NFL|last=Zulgad|first=Judd|publisher=[[KSTP (AM)]]|date=2012-03-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324203456/http://www.1500espn.com/sportswire/Zulgad_Chris_Kluwe_thinks_Jonathan_Vilma_should_be_banned_from_NFL032212|archivedate=2012-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sentiments were echoed a day later by Vikings center [[John Sullivan (American football)|John Sullivan]], who told [[KFXN-FM]] in the Twin Cities that any Saint who deliberately tried to hurt Favre in that game should get a lifetime ban. Sullivan called the Saints' treatment of Favre "despicable" and "the exact opposite of sportsmanship," and even called for the league to take some sort of action against players involved in that game who had since retired, such as McCray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/39950/john-sullivan-saints-were-despicable|title=John Sullivan: Saints were "despicable"|last=Seifert|first=Kevin|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2, 2012, the NFL suspended four then-current or former Saints players for their involvement in the bounty scandal:
* Vilma was suspended for the entire [[2012 NFL season]].&lt;ref name="ESPNplayers" /&gt;
* Former Saints defensive tackle [[Anthony Hargrove]] was suspended for eight games.
* Saints defensive end [[Will Smith (American football)|Will Smith]] was suspended for four games.
* Former Saints linebacker [[Scott Fujita]] (then with the [[Cleveland Browns]], now retired) was suspended for three games.

Vilma's suspension took effect immediately, while the other three players are allowed to attend training camp. In announcing the suspensions, Goodell said that while a large number of players took part in the program, he chose to suspend those players who "were in leadership positions at the Saints; contributed a particularly large sum of money toward the program; specifically contributed to a bounty on an opposing player; demonstrated a clear intent to participate in a program that potentially injured opposing players; sought rewards for doing so; and/or obstructed the 2010 investigation." The NFL determined that Vilma and Smith helped Williams start the bounty program. Hargrove lied to league officials during the 2010 investigation, but later signed a letter to the NFL admitting that he was active participant in the scheme. He also told at least one other player that the Saints had put a bounty on Favre in the 2009 NFC title game. Fujita, who left the team for the Browns immediately after the Saints won [[Super Bowl XLIV]], pledged "a significant amount of money" into the bounty program.&lt;ref name=NFLPlayerPenalties&gt;[http://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/5-2-12-saints-players1.pdf NFL announcement of player sanctions]&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier, Goodell had indicated that he was going to come down hard on the players involved, telling Eisen that they "enthusiastically embraced" the scheme. "They are on the field, so so I don't think they are absolved from any responsibility because of that," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8288d646/article/goodell-new-orleans-saints-players-embraced-bounties|title=Goodell: New Orleans Saints players 'embraced' bounties|last=Hanzus|first=Dan|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFLPA released a statement calling the suspensions unjustified, claiming that Goodell had not furnished them with any evidence supporting the sanctions.&lt;ref name="ESPNplayers" /&gt; The union lodged a formal grievance on May 4, contending that since the suspensions were for on-field misconduct, the players' appeals should be heard by [[Ted Cottrell]] and [[Art Shell]], whom the collective bargaining agreement designates as the hearing officers for on-field sanctions. It also contended that since the alleged conduct took place before the most recent CBA was signed in August, Goodell should have deferred to NFL [[special master]] [[Stephen B. Burbank|Stephen Burbank]] in ruling on the players' actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/18964180/union-bounty-grievance-goodell-has-no-authority-to-punish-hear-appeals|title=Union bounty grievance: Goodell has no authority to punish, hear appeals|publisher=[[CBSSports.com]]|date=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodell issued the suspensions as part of his power to sanction any "conduct detrimental to the integrity and public confidence in the NFL," a violation of Article 46 of the CBA. This provision is normally used to sanction off-field conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2012/05/new_orleans_saints_suspended_p.html|title=New Orleans Saints suspended players' appeals face uphill battle: expert|last=Varney|first=James|work=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a league source told CBSSports.com's Judge that it also gives Goodell the power to rule on in-game conduct if he feels that it runs counter to the integrity of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/18964610/legal-expert-union-may-be-fighting-losing-battle-in-bounty-grievances|title=Legal expert: Union may be fighting losing battle in bounty grievances|last=Judge|first=Clark|publisher=[[CBSSports.com]]|date=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26, 2012, [[Jonathan Vilma]] and seven witnesses from the Saints testified in front of a federal judge in New Orleans that Goodell got his facts wrong in the bounty scandal. "Everybody was sworn in under oath in front of a judge with the risk of perjury and jail time if we were lying, and categorically denied there was a bounty," Vilma said in a text message to ESPN's Ed Werder. "Seven people testified, 2 sworn affidavits (one by Drew Brees) all saying the same thing. I ask that you and ESPN report the facts. No more bias or b.s. or hearsay. I gave you facts that you can report if so choose."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Tulane University Sports Law Program Director Gabe Feldman (who attended the hearing in court) said, "Clearly the judge, by her questions, indicated she thinks Goodell overstepped his authority, and this case was always going to be about if he executed his power fairly... The NFL's retort is that with all due deference, you don't get to second guess (commissioner Roger Goodell). Judges only have limited jurisdiction over arbitration issues."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

All four players appealed their suspensions. On September 7, 2012, the Burbank appeals panel vacated the suspensions imposed on the four, and the NFL confirmed that the ruling reinstated them in time for their first games of the 2012 season two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chase|first=Chris|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2012/09/saints-players-have-suspensions-lifted-are-available-for-season-opener/1#.UEpk6rKPUl8|title=Saints bounty players have suspensions lifted, are available for season opener|work=USA Today|accessdate=7 September 2012|date=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after the fifth game of the season, on October 9, 2012, the league re-issued the suspensions without any changes or reductions; the players' appeals continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brooks|first=Matt|title=Report: NFL re-issues bounty suspensions for Saints players|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2012/10/09/nfl-re-issues-bounty-suspensions-for-saints-players/|work=The Washington Times|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 27, 2012, former league commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]] postponed the bounty appeals hearing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000085951/article/nfl-postpones-new-orleans-saints-bounty-appeals-hearing|title=NFL postpones New Orleans Saints bounty appeals hearing|publisher=NFL|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; expecting to set a new schedule on October 29, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000085952/article/paul-tagliabue-postpones-bounty-appeals-hearing|title=Paul Tagliabue postpones bounty appeals hearing|publisher=NFL|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 11, with three games left in the regular season, Tagliabue vacated the players' suspensions, saying in his ruling, "I affirm Commissioner Goodell's factual findings as to the four players. I conclude that Hargrove, Smith and Vilma—but not Fujita—engaged in 'conduct detrimental to the integrity of, and public confidence in, the game of professional football ..." He laid primary responsibility for the scandal on Williams and Payton.&lt;ref name=Tagliabuevacate&gt;[http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8736662/paul-tagliabue-vacates-new-orleans-players-bounty-penalties Paul Tagliabue vacates penalties]. [[ESPN]], 2012-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Had the suspensions of Vilma and Hargrove been upheld, they would have been the longest for an on-field incident in modern NFL history, topping the previous record set in [[2006 NFL season|2006]], when then-Titans defensive end [[Albert Haynesworth]] was given a five-game suspension for stomping on the head of [[Dallas Cowboys]] offensive lineman [[Andre Gurode]].

Vilma played the final 11 games of the 2012 season for the Saints; Smith played all 16. Fujita played the first four games of the season for the Browns before suffering a season-ending (and ultimately, career-ending) neck injury;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/season-over-browns-lb-scott-163452126--nfl.html|title=Season, maybe career, over for Browns' Fujita|publisher=[[Yahoo! Sports]]|date=2012-10-24|accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; he would sign a ceremonial one-day contract with the Saints in the offseason and retire with the team.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Duncan, [http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2013/04/scott_fujita_retires_from_nfl.html "Scott Fujita retires from NFL as a New Orleans Saint"], ''[[Times-Picayune]]'', April 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Hargrove, signed as a free agent by the [[Green Bay Packers]] in March 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7751195/2012-nfl-free-agency-green-bay-packers-get-defensive-lineman-anthony-hargrove|title=Packers Get Anthony Hargrove|publisher=ESPN|date=March 29, 2012|accessdate=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; did not play during the 2012 season. Nonetheless, the loss of Payton, combined with the distractions caused by the scandal, proved too much for the Saints to overcome. After finishing 13–3 and reaching the Divisional round of the playoffs a year earlier, they finished 7–9 and missed the playoffs.

==Media reaction==
The behavior detailed in the report was almost universally condemned in the press. In an editorial, New Orleans' local paper ''[[The Times-Picayune]]'' called the revelations "an embarrassment for one of the most successful and beloved sports organizations of recent years," and that they were "particularly hard to take for (Saints') fans" in light of the Saints' rebound after [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/opinions/index.ssf/2012/03/bounty_program_scandal_is_a_bl.html|title=Saints 'bounty program' is a black eye for a beloved franchise|work=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=2012-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESPN columnist [[Gregg Easterbrook]] claimed that the Saints' behavior threatened the very integrity of the sport since high school and youth players have long emulated what they see in the NFL. He also claimed that NFL Network yanked its planned replay of the 2009 NFC Championship Game due to concern that fans might look more closely for late hits that should have been called.&lt;ref name=Easterbrook /&gt;

Most of the players who were the targets of questionable hits by the Saints, including Favre and Warner, claimed the bounties were merely part of the game.&lt;ref name="FoxLegal" /&gt; However, several former players interviewed by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' said that while payments for good hits and sacks were indeed considered part of the game, bounties for intentionally injuring opponents violated an unwritten code. One of those interviewed, [[Junior Seau]], bluntly said that such practices crossed the line into threatening a person's livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1195696/index.htm|title=The Conscience Of The Locker Room|last=Trotter|first=Jim|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Seau would commit [[suicide]] less than two months after the interview was published; it was discovered after his death that he suffered from [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE) as a result of the numerous head injuries Seau suffered during his 20-year NFL career.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/8830344/study-junior-seau-brain-shows-chronic-brain-damage-found-other-nfl-football-players|title=Study: Junior Seau's brain shows chronic brain damage found in other NFL football players|publisher=ESPN.com|date=January 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seau's sentiments were echoed by Hall of Fame quarterback [[Fran Tarkenton]]. In an op-ed for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Tarkenton wrote that he played against the likes of [[Mean Joe Greene]], [[Ray Nitschke]] and [[Dick Butkus]], and none of them even considered deliberately trying to hurt him. He also said that he discussed the issue with several players from his era, and they unanimously agreed that players who put bounties on opponents were "cowards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203370604577265522200050922|title=Football's Bounty Hunters Must Be Clipped|last=Tarkenton|first=Fran|authorlink=Fran Tarkenton|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevin Seifert, who blogs on the [[NFC North]] for ESPN.com, wrote that neither he nor most Vikings fans were surprised at the discovery of the bounty program. Seifert argued that even before the findings were revealed, it was obvious that the Saints were determined to inflict a severe beating on Favre, even if it meant breaking the rules. The only difference in Seifert's mind was that he no longer believed the Saints were out of control. Rather, he wrote, they were acting as "part of a larger mentality" instilled by Williams.&lt;ref name=Seifert/&gt;

Speculation quickly abounded about how severely Goodell, who has made player safety and the overall integrity of the game a point of emphasis during his six years as commissioner, would punish Williams and the Saints. In his weekly "Monday Morning Quarterback" column on March 5, ''SI''{{'}}s [[Peter King (sportswriter)|Peter King]] wrote that he believed Williams faced at least an eight-game suspension, and that Payton and Loomis would almost certainly be suspended as well. He also argued that Goodell would have no choice but to come down hard on the Saints, given that the league was facing numerous lawsuits brought by former players who suffered head injuries. Given the circumstances, King said, Goodell had a lot of incentive to "issue a string of suspensions the likes of which the league has never seen."&lt;ref name=KingMarch5/&gt; In an article written for the March 12 edition of ''SI'', King wrote that league officials were so outraged that they were likely to hand down penalties similar to the season-long bans [[Paul Hornung]] and [[Alex Karras]] received in 1963 for gambling.&lt;ref name=KingOutofBounds/&gt; Freeman wrote that his sources in the league office had told him that the players, Williams, Payton and Loomis would all face suspensions of at least six games, as well as heavy fines. Freeman's sources also said that Payton's sanctions were likely to dwarf those handed down to the [[New England Patriots]]' [[Bill Belichick]] in the wake of the [[2007 National Football League videotaping controversy|2007 "Spygate"]] affair. He also believed that Goodell was going to use the scandal to "end the practice of bounty football forever," much like the penalties imposed against the Patriots after "Spygate" effectively ended the longstanding practice of illicit videotaping.&lt;ref name=Freeman2/&gt;

After the sanctions were announced, CBSSports.com's [[Gregg Doyel]] wrote that the severity of the punishments handed down to Williams, Payton and Loomis proved that Goodell was truly sincere in his desire to "take the thuggishness out of the NFL." Doyel also said that while many players had chafed at what they saw as Goodell's heavy-handed approach to discipline, he was actually standing up for their safety in the Saints' case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/17950395/long-seen-as-their-enemy-goodell-comes-down-decisively-for-players|title=Long seen as their enemy, Goodell comes down decisively for players|last=Doyel|first=Gregg|authorlink=Gregg Doyel|publisher=[[CBSSports.com]]|date=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pereira, now an analyst for Fox Sports, wrote that based on his experience in the league office, he wasn't surprised that Goodell came down hard on the Saints. He recalled that Goodell was always upset when officials didn't penalize hits on defenseless players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/Roger-Goodell-New-Orleans-Saints-Bountygate-proves-commitment-to-player-safety-032212|title=Goodell shows commitment to player safety|last=Pereira|first=Mike|authorlink=Mike Pereira|publisher=[[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]|date=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revelation of Williams' pregame speech was also greeted with revulsion. ESPN NFL analyst and former [[Dallas Cowboys]] safety [[Darren Woodson]] said that much of Williams' speech was standard pregame rhetoric. According to Woodson, when Williams called for his men to "attack the head" of running back [[Frank Gore]], he was saying that the 49ers' offense would be rendered ineffective if they managed to shut Gore down. However, Woodson felt that several parts of Williams' speech—particularly his calls to go after Crabtree's ACL and target Williams specifically because he had concussions in the past—went too far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=espn:7778213|title=Williams Crossed the Line|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; His former teammate, NFL Network analyst [[Michael Irvin]], said that he "almost threw up" when he heard Williams tell his men to go after Crabtree's ACL, saying that players are taught from youth football onward to "never take out a man's knees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/videos/new-orleans-saints/09000d5d8281da6d/Michael-Irvin-s-thoughts-on-Saints-bounties|title=Michael Irvin's thoughts on Saints' bounties|publisher=[[NFL Network]]|date=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox Sports' Mark Kriegel argued that the tape proved Williams was "woefully underpunished," especially since he made the speech after being alerted that the NFL had reopened its investigation. He called for Goodell to ban him from the league for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/Gregg-Williams-New-Orleans-Saints-Bountygate-must-be-banned-for-life-040512|title=Ban Williams from NFL for good|last=Kriegel|first=Mark|publisher=[[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]|date=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NFL Network analyst [[Michael Lombardi (sportscaster)|Michael Lombardi]] wrote that the scandal happened in part because during Williams' previous stops as a defensive coordinator, the head coaches under which he worked—Fisher, [[Joe Gibbs]] and Payton—essentially ceded him complete authority over the defense. Lombardi claimed that as a result, Williams operated essentially as "an independent contractor." Lombardi argued that such a situation is "never fully sustainable," as it can easily lead to the head coach losing control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82821ba1/article/williams-independentcontractor-status-fueled-rogue-mentality|title=Williams' independent-contractor status fueled rogue mentality|last=Lombardi|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Lombardi (sportscaster)|publisher=[[NFL.com]]|date=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the media outcry, an independent study speculated that Saints' players may have pretended to participate off the field but not put the tactics into action on the field. "If the Saints tended to injure more players, then teams that played them would tend to list more injuries the following week. To test whether the Saints injured more players than a typical team, one need only compare the number of players added to injury reports after a Saints game to the league-wide average. Did the New Orleans Saints injure more players? The data-driven answer is a resounding 'no.' The Saints appear to have injured far fewer players over the 2009, 2010 and 2011 seasons. The numbers are striking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aei.org/article/economics/the-saints-aint-sinners/|title=The Saints ain't sinners|last1=Hassett|first1=Kevin|authorlink=Kevin Hassett|last2=Veuger|first2=Stan|work=Los Angeles Times|date=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jainism}}
'''Nirjara''' is one of the seven fundamental principles, or [[Tattva (Jainism)|Tattva]] in [[Jain philosophy]], and refers to the shedding or removal of accumulated [[Karma in Jainism|karma]]s from the [[Atman (Jainism)|atma]] (soul), essential for breaking free from [[Samsara (Jainism)|samsara]], the cycle of birth-death and [[Reincarnation|rebirth]], by achieving [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksha]], liberation.&lt;ref name=si&gt;[[#Si|Singh, p. 4525]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Da|Dasgupta, 192]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Literally meaning "falling off", the concept is described first in chapter 9 of the classical Jain text, [[Tattvartha Sutra]] (True nature of Reality) written by  Acharya [[Umasvati]], in 2nd century CE, the only text authoritative in both [[Svetambara]] and [[Digambara]] sects of Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ji|Jaini, p. 82]]&lt;/ref&gt; Later it also finds mention in [[Dravyasamgraha]]  (Compendium of substances), a 10th-century Jain text by Acharya [[Nemichandra]].&lt;ref name=sd&gt;[[#Sd|Nemichandra, p. 93]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
Nirjara is preceded by stoppage of karma accumulation, or ''[[samvara]]'', thereby ending ''[[asrava]]'' or influx of karma which leads to ''[[Bandha (Jainism)|bandha]]'' or bondage due ''[[Kashaya (Jainism)|kasaya]]'' or passions of the soul, namely, ''krodha'' (anger), ''lobha'' (greed), ''mana'' (ego) and ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'' (deceit), besides ''[[raaga]]'' (attachment) and ''dvesa'' (hatred). '' [[Dravyasamgraha]]'' explains that the soul becomes dim due to the dust of karmic matter,  thus nirjara itself offers a way to clear the soul, and ultimately leading to [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksha]], liberation.&lt;ref name=st/&gt;

==Types of Nirjara==
Nirjara is of two types, ''Bhava Nirjara'', modification of soul which leads to separation of karmic matter from the soul, and ''Dravya Nirjara'', actual separation of karmic matter from the soul. In turn, ''bhava nirjara'' is of two types, ''Savipaka'' and ''Avipaka''.&lt;ref name=st&gt;[[#Sd|Nemichandra, p. 94]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Savipaka Nirjara''===
'''Savipaka''' - Passive Method - Also known as ''Akam'' or [[wikt:unintentional|unintentional]] ''Nirjara'', [[wikt:equanimous|equanimous]] submission to the fruition of karma, and involves natural maturing of past Karma, in due course of time and experiencing the results, both good and bad with equanimity. If the fruits of the past karmas are not received without attachment or agitation then the soul earns fresh karmic bondages.  It is also not possible for the soul to know before-hand when and which karma will start to produce results and therefore require good discipline in practicing equanimity under all circumstances.

This passive method of exhaustion of karmic matter around the soul, after enjoyment of its fruits, is compared with emptying of a pond through evaporation, while water channels are still pouring in. Naturally it is a slow method, as by the time karmas become ripe and are exhausted, new karmas fill in, as karmic matter is constantly pouring into the ''karma sharira'' (karmic body), through [[asrava]], influx of karma. Thus to achieve liberation, the active method of purging off karma, ''avipaka nirjara'' is advised.&lt;ref name=si/&gt;&lt;ref name=ja&gt;[[#Ja|Jainism. p. 50]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Avipaka Nirjara''===
'''Avipaka''' - Active Method - Also known as ''Sakam'' or intentional ''Nirjara'', it involves individual exertion of [[ascetic]] practices, by practicing internal and external austerities, like penances or [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]], literally meaning heat, so as to accelerate the ripening process as well as reducing the effects produced.  This is recommended approach as it prepares and conditions the soul and reminds it to be vigilant. Tapas is of two kinds, ''bahya'' or external, and ''antaranga'' or internal.&lt;ref name=si/&gt;&lt;ref name=ja/&gt;

====''Bahya tapas''====
The ''Bahya'' or ''bahiranga tapa'', external austerities are meant to discipline the sensual cravings, and prepares the person for internal austerities, which come next.

# ''Anasana'' - Fasting, purifies sense organs, lessens sens of attachment to bodily enjoyments
# ''Avamodarya'' or ''Alpahara'' - Eating less than one's normal diet, removed laziness/lethargy and brings in fresh energy to the mind
# ''Vritti parisankhyana'' or ''Vrita sankshepa'' - Restriction of certain kinds or number of food
# ''Rasa parityaga'' -Daily renunciation of one or more of 6 kinds of ''Rasas'' delicacies: [[ghee]] (butter, clarified butter), milk, curd, sugar, salt, oil. Abstention from tasty and stimulating food
# ''Vivikta shayyasana'' - Sleeping in a lonely place, practicing solitude and introspection
# ''Kaya-klesha'' - Bodily Endurance, practicing body austerities to get over attachment to bodily comfort  &lt;ref name=si/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/treatise.txt|title=A Treatise On Jainism|last=Sanghvi|first=Jayatilal S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some places, alternative to this list include, ''Ichhanirodha'', control of desire for food and material things.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/9tatvas.txt Nine Tattvas: 8. Nirjara]&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Antaraga tapas''====
The ''antaranga tapa'', internal austerities which follow are:

# ''Prayaschita'' - [[wikt:Atonement|Atonement]]/penance for sinful acts
# ''Vinaya'' - Practice politeness and humility
# ''Vaiyavritya'' - Service to others, especially monks, nuns, elders and the weaker souls without any expectations in return
# ''Swadhyaya'' - Self-study, scriptural study, questioning and expanding the spiritual knowledge
# ''Vyutsarga'' - Abandonment of passions - especially anger, ego, deceit and greed, distinction between body and soul
# ''Dhyana'' - Meditation and contemplation

All the first five internal austerities and all six external austerities are preparatory steps for the practice of [[wikt:dhyana|dhyana]], which is the primary cause of moksha.&lt;ref name=st/&gt;

For layman the journey begins with practicing the [[Triple gems of Jainism]], ''[[Ratnatraya]]'', namely [[Triple_gems_of_Jainism#Right_View|Right View]] or perception (''Samyak Darshana''), [[Triple_gems_of_Jainism#Right_knowledge|Right knowledge]] (''Samyak Gyana'') and [[Triple_gems_of_Jainism#Right_conduct|Right conduct]] (''Samyak Charitra''), which constitute the path to liberation. The [[Jain monasticism|monks in Jainism]], who have dedicated their lives to achieve, moksha and acquiring the ''[[Kevala Jnana]]'', absolute knowledge, however go on to take the five ''[[Mahavrata]]'', literally Great Vows, of self-control:
# [[Non-violence]] ([[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa]])
# Truth ([[Satya]])
# Non-stealing ([[Asteya]])
# Chastity ([[Brahmacharya]])
# Non-possession/[[Detachment (philosophy)|Non-attachment]] ([[Aparigraha]]) .&lt;ref name=st&gt;[[#Si|Singh, p. 4526]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from that, the monks also practices, three ''Guptis'' and five ''Samitis''. Three Restraints (''Gupti''), i.e., Control of the mind (Managupti), Control of speech (Vacanagupti), Control of body (Kayagupti); and Five Carefulness (Samiti) i.e. Carefulness while walking (Irya Samiti), Carefulness while communicating (Bhasha Samiti), Carefulness while eating (Eshana Samiti), Carefulness while handling their fly-whisks, water gourds, etc. (Adana Nikshepana Samiti), Carefulness while disposing of bodily waste matter (Pratishthapana Samiti)

According to [[Umaswati]] in ''[[Tattvartha Sutra]]'' 10.1.2, ''[[Kevala Jnana]]'', absolute knowledge or [[Omniscience]], comes only after, the [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Mohaniya_karman|Mohaniya karma]] are first destroyed, followed by [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Jnanavaraniya_karma|Jnanavaraniya karma]], [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Darsanavarana_karma|Darsanavarana karma]] and [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Antaraya_karma|Antaraya karma]]. However after attaining the ''Kevala jnana'', the causes of [[Bandha (Jainism)|bandha]], bondage end, thus the influx of Karma, [[asrava]], ends as well, thus the person is freed from the [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Aghatiya_karmas|Aghatiya karmas]] namely, [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Ayu_Karma|Ayu karma]], [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Nama_Karma|Nama karma]], [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Gotra_Karma|Gotra karma]] and [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Vedaniya_Karma|Vedaniya karma]], which cause worldly existence. Emptied of karma the person attains liberation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sd|Nemichandra, p. 97]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8795">In [[statistics]] and [[signal processing]], the '''orthogonality principle''' is a necessary and sufficient condition for the optimality of a [[Bayesian estimator]]. Loosely stated, the orthogonality principle says that the error vector of the optimal estimator (in a [[mean square error]] sense) is orthogonal to any possible estimator. The orthogonality principle is most commonly stated for linear estimators, but more general formulations are possible. Since the principle is a necessary and sufficient condition for optimality, it can be used to find the [[minimum mean square error]] estimator.

== Orthogonality principle for linear estimators ==

The orthogonality principle is most commonly used in the setting of linear estimation.&lt;ref&gt;Kay, p.386&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, let ''x'' be an unknown [[random vector]] which is to be estimated based on the observation vector ''y''. One wishes to construct a linear estimator &lt;math&gt;\hat{x} = Hy + c&lt;/math&gt; for some matrix ''H'' and vector ''c''. Then, the orthogonality principle states that an estimator &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}&lt;/math&gt; achieves [[minimum mean square error]] if and only if
* &lt;math&gt;E \{ (\hat{x} - x ) y^T \} = 0,&lt;/math&gt; and
* &lt;math&gt;E \{ \hat{x} - x \} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
If ''x'' and ''y'' have zero mean, then it suffices to require the first condition.

=== Example ===
Suppose ''x'' is a [[Gaussian random variable]] with mean ''m'' and variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2.&lt;/math&gt; Also suppose we observe a value &lt;math&gt;y=x+w,&lt;/math&gt; where ''w'' is Gaussian noise which is independent of ''x'' and has mean 0 and variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma_w^2.&lt;/math&gt; We wish to find a linear estimator &lt;math&gt;\hat{x} = hy+c&lt;/math&gt; minimizing the MSE. Substituting the expression &lt;math&gt;\hat{x} = hy + c&lt;/math&gt; into the two requirements of the orthogonality principle, we obtain
: &lt;math&gt;0 = E \{ (\hat{x} - x ) y \}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;0 = E \{ (hx+hw+c-x)(x+w) \}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;0 = h (\sigma_x^2+\sigma_w^2) + hm^2 + cm - \sigma_x^2 -m^2&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;0 = E \{ \hat{x} - x \}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;0 = E \{ hx+hw+c-x \}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;0 = (h-1)m + c .&lt;/math&gt;
Solving these two linear equations for ''h'' and ''c'' results in
: &lt;math&gt; h = \frac{\sigma_x^2}{\sigma_x^2 +\sigma_w^2}, \quad c = \frac{\sigma_w^2}{\sigma_x^2+\sigma_w^2} m , &lt;/math&gt;
so that the linear minimum mean square error estimator is given by
: &lt;math&gt; \hat{x} = \frac{\sigma_x^2}{\sigma_x^2 +\sigma_w^2} y + \frac{\sigma_w^2}{\sigma_x^2 +\sigma_w^2} m.&lt;/math&gt;

This estimator can be interpreted as a weighted average between the noisy measurements ''y'' and the prior expected value ''m''. If the noise variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma_w^2&lt;/math&gt; is low compared with the variance of the prior  &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2&lt;/math&gt; (corresponding to a high [[signal to noise ratio|SNR]]), then most of the weight is given to the measurements ''y'', which are deemed more reliable than the prior information. Conversely, if the noise variance is relatively higher, then the estimate will be close to ''m'', as the measurements are not reliable enough to outweigh the prior information.

Finally, note that because the variables ''x'' and ''y'' are jointly Gaussian, the minimum MSE estimator is linear.&lt;ref&gt;See the article [[minimum mean square error]].&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in this case, the estimator above minimizes the MSE among all estimators, not only linear estimators.

== General formulation ==
Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Hilbert space]] of random variables with an [[inner product]] defined by &lt;math&gt;\langle x,y \rangle = E \{ x^H y \}&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is a [[closed set|closed]] subspace of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, representing the space of all possible estimators. One wishes to find a vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{x} \in W&lt;/math&gt; which will approximate a vector &lt;math&gt;x \in V&lt;/math&gt;. More accurately, one would like to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) &lt;math&gt;E \| x - \hat{x} \|^2&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

In the special case of linear estimators described above, the space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all functions of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the set of linear estimators, i.e., linear functions of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; only. Other settings which can be formulated in this way include the subspace of [[causal filter|causal]] linear filters and the subspace of all (possibly nonlinear) estimators.

Geometrically, we can see this problem by the following simple case where &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is a [[dimension (vector space)|one-dimensional]] subspace:

[[Image:Orthogonality principle.png|350px|center]]

We want to find the closest approximation to the vector &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; by a vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}&lt;/math&gt; in the space &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;. From the geometric interpretation, it is intuitive that the best approximation, or smallest error, occurs when the error vector, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, is orthogonal to vectors in the space &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;. 

More accurately, the general orthogonality principle states the following: Given a closed subspace &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; of estimators within a Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and an element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, an element &lt;math&gt;\hat{x} \in W&lt;/math&gt; achieves minimum MSE among all elements in &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;E \{ (x-\hat{x}) y^T \} = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;y \in W.&lt;/math&gt;

Stated in such a manner, this principle is simply a statement of the [[Hilbert projection theorem]]. Nevertheless, the extensive use of this result in signal processing has resulted in the name "orthogonality principle."

== A solution to error minimization problems ==

The following is one way to find the [[minimum mean square error]] estimator by using the orthogonality principle.

We want to be able to approximate a vector &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; by 

: &lt;math&gt;x=\hat{x}+e\,&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}=\sum_i c_{i}p_{i}&lt;/math&gt;

is the approximation of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; as a linear combination of vectors in the subspace &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; spanned by &lt;math&gt;p_{1},p_{2},\ldots.&lt;/math&gt; Therefore, we want to be able to solve for the coefficients, &lt;math&gt;c_{i}&lt;/math&gt;, so that we may write our approximation in known terms.

By the orthogonality theorem, the square norm of the error vector, &lt;math&gt;\left\Vert e\right\Vert ^{2}&lt;/math&gt;, is minimized when, for all ''j'',

: &lt;math&gt;\left\langle x-\sum_i c_{i}p_{i},p_{j}\right\rangle =0.&lt;/math&gt;

Developing this equation, we obtain

: &lt;math&gt;
\left\langle x,p_{j}\right\rangle =\left\langle \sum_i c_{i}p_{i},p_{j}\right\rangle =\sum_i c_{i}\left\langle p_{i},p_{j}\right\rangle.&lt;/math&gt; 

If there is a finite number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of vectors &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;, one can write this equation in matrix form as

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
\left\langle x,p_{1}\right\rangle \\
\left\langle x,p_{2}\right\rangle \\
\vdots\\
\left\langle x,p_{n}\right\rangle \end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\left\langle p_{1},p_{1}\right\rangle  &amp; \left\langle p_{2},p_{1}\right\rangle  &amp; \cdots &amp; \left\langle p_{n},p_{1}\right\rangle \\
\left\langle p_{1},p_{2}\right\rangle  &amp; \left\langle p_{2},p_{2}\right\rangle  &amp; \cdots &amp; \left\langle p_{n},p_{2}\right\rangle \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\
\left\langle p_{1},p_{n}\right\rangle  &amp; \left\langle p_{2},p_{n}\right\rangle  &amp; \cdots &amp; \left\langle p_{n},p_{n}\right\rangle \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
c_{1}\\
c_{2}\\
\vdots\\
c_{n}\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming the &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; are [[linearly independent]], the [[Gramian matrix]] can be inverted to obtain

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
c_{1}\\
c_{2}\\
\vdots\\
c_{n}\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\left\langle p_{1},p_{1}\right\rangle  &amp; \left\langle p_{2},p_{1}\right\rangle  &amp; \cdots &amp; \left\langle p_{n},p_{1}\right\rangle \\
\left\langle p_{1},p_{2}\right\rangle  &amp; \left\langle p_{2},p_{2}\right\rangle  &amp; \cdots &amp; \left\langle p_{n},p_{2}\right\rangle \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\
\left\langle p_{1},p_{n}\right\rangle  &amp; \left\langle p_{2},p_{n}\right\rangle  &amp; \cdots &amp; \left\langle p_{n},p_{n}\right\rangle \end{bmatrix}^{-1}
\begin{bmatrix}
\left\langle x,p_{1}\right\rangle \\
\left\langle x,p_{2}\right\rangle \\
\vdots\\
\left\langle x,p_{n}\right\rangle \end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;

thus providing an expression for the coefficients &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; of the minimum mean square error estimator.

'''Paramatman''' ([[Sanskrit]]: परमात्मन्, [[IAST]]: Paramātmāṇ) or '''Paramātmā''' is the Absolute [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] or Supreme self) in [[Vedanta]] and [[Yoga]] philosophies in the [[Hindu]] theology. The Paramatman is the “Primordial Self” or the “Self Beyond” who is spiritually practically identical with the Absolute, identical with the [[Brahman]]. Selflessness is the attribute of Paramatman, where all personality/individuality vanishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Occult Glossary:A Comendium of Oriental and Theosophical Terms|author=T. Depurucker|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|page=130|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eRztON94euYC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=paramatman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Tk7VULagB9DQrAfEnIFY&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=paramatman&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The word stem ''paramātma'' (परमात्मन्, pronounced {{IPA-sa|pərəmaːtmən|}}, its nominative singular being ''paramātmā'' — परमात्मा, pronounced {{IPA-sa|pərəmaːtmaː|}}) is formed from two words, ''parama'', meaning "supreme" or "highest", and ''ātma'', which means individual self.

The word “[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]” generally denotes the Individual Self, but by the word “Paramatman” which word also expresses Boundless Life, Boundless Consciousness, Boundless Substance in Boundless Space, is meant the Atman of all atmans or the Supreme Self or the Universal Self. The word “Atman” which literally means non-darkness or light, is Brahman the subtlest indestructible Divine existence. The word “Paramatman” refers to the Creator all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atman and Paramatman|url=http://autobiography.swami.center.org/atman-and-paramatman.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paramatman in Jain theology==
{{main|Jīva (Jainism)}}
In [[Jainism]], each atman or individual self is a potential Paramatman or God, both are essentially the same. It remains as atman only because of its binding [[karma|"karmic"]] limitations, until such time as those limitations are removed. As Paramatman, the atman represents the ultimate point of spiritual evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Encyclopaedia of Oriental Philosophy|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|page=245|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgNHE-48jNcC&amp;pg=PA245 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though Jain [[mysticism]] centers around Atman and Paramatman because it believes in the existence of soul, in Jainism, which accepts neither [[Vedic]] authority nor [[Monism]], all enlightened souls are referred to as Paramatman and regarded as gods. Jainism honours the soul of each man as its own eternally distinct [[Messiah|savior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The World’s Great Religions:An Anthology of Sacred Texts|author=Selwyn Gurney Champion|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|page=149|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wEjIX4FldtkC&amp;pg=PA149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Paramatman of Jainism is unable to create and govern the world, there is no place of God as a creator and bestower of fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A Jaina Perspective on the Philosophy of Religion|author=Arvind Sharma|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |p=4 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BtbbLjvTkGMC&amp;pg=PA4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paramatman in Buddhism==

Buddhism rejects a metaphysics of "ground" such as the paramatman.

==Description of Paramatman in the Upanishads==

The sage of the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] IV.4.2, though not using the word “Paramatman”, explains that at the time of release the portion (aspect) of the Paramatman and the portion (aspect) of the [[Jiva]] presiding in the right eye become unified with the Paramatman and the Jiva presiding in the heart, then the Jiva does not see, smell, taste, speak, hear, feel, touch and know; when Paramatman goes out, the Chief [[Prana]] goes out after Him, followed by the Lower Prana. Paramatman goes out riding on the Jiva following consciousness and work, knowledge of former life or natural capacity. In the [[Prashna Upanishad]] IV.11 the word “Atman” cannot refer to Jiva because the Jiva cannot of its own accord throw off its body or understand avidya, therefore, it refers to Paramatman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sacred Books of the Hindus, Vol. 15.

==Parable of the Two Birds==

The word, Paramatman, is not to be found in the [[Rig Veda]] but through allusion referring to Paramatman as Isha. This distinction is made because all of its mantras which in the form of prayers are addressed to gods. In its great Riddle Hymn (Sukta I.164) is the famous mantra - R.V.I.164.20, that was revealed to Rishi Deergatamaah Auchathyah and borrowed  by [[Mundaka Upanishad]] III.1.1-3, which belongs to [[Atharva Veda]], to weave the parable of the Two Birds:-Two birds.
 
:::Two birds, beautiful of wings, close companions, cling to one common tree: of the two one eats the sweet fruit of that tree; the other eats not but watches his companion. The self is the bird that sits immersed on the common tree; but because he is not lord he is bewildered and has sorrow. But when he sees that other who is the Lord and the beloved, he knows that all is His greatness and his sorrow passes away from him. When, a seer, he sees the Golden-hued, the maker, the Lord, the Spirit who is the source of Brahman, then he becomes the knower and shakes from his wings sin and virtue; pure of all stains he reaches the supreme identity.

-Translation of Verses 1-3 of Third Mundaka Upanishad by Sri Aurobindo.

Here at, [[Aurobindo]] makes the [[Spirit]] or [[Purusha]] as the Source of everything, including [[Brahman]]. He makes Purusha more fundamental. Thus, he does not have to say Brahman to be the source of inferior Brahman, and he also dismisses the sense of Reality revealed in imaginative and emotional build-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Parable of Two Birds|author=Ry Deshpande|url=http://archives.mirroroftomorrow.org/blog/_archives/2010/9/30/4631783.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415120619/http://archives.mirroroftomorrow.org/blog/_archives/2010/9/30/4631783.html|archivedate=15 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case of Two souls==

The Dualistic School of Philosophy initiated by Anandatirtha draws its support from  the afore-cited passage as well as from the passage of [[Katha Upanishad]] I.3.1  of an earlier Upanishad that speaks about two souls which taste the fruits of action, both of which are lodged in the recess of the human heart, and which are different from each other as light and shade, that carried the flaw – how could the Universal soul be regarded as enjoying the fruits of action? The followers of [[Madhava (Vishnu)|Madhava]] draw their support from the [[Bhagavad Gita]] XV.16 that speaks about two persons in this world, the Mutable and the Immutable; the Mutable is all these things, while the Immutable is the one who exists at the top of them, one is the Jivatman and the other, Paramatman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A constructive survey of Upanishadic philosophy|author=Ramachandra Dattatrya Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=151|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jivatman is ''chit'', the sentient, and Paramatman is [[Isvara]], both have the same attributes; they are inseparably present together on the tree which is ''achit'', the insentient, or the gross ''Avidya'' component of existence. Jivatman and Paramatman are both seated in the heart, the former is driven by the three modes of nature and acts, the latter simply witnesses as though approving the former’s activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two birds in a tree - Soul and Supersoul|url=http://www.speakingtree.in/spiritual-blogs/seekers/philosophy/two-birds-in-a-tree-soul-and-supersoul}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between Paramātmā, the Universal Self, and [[Ātman (Hinduism)|'ātma]], the Individual Self, is likened to the indwelling God and the soul within one's heart. Paramatman is one of the many aspects of [[Brahman]]. Paramatman is situated at the core of every individual [[jiva]] in the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|macrocosm]]. The [[Upanishad]]s do compare Atman and Paramatman to two birds sitting like friends on the branch of a tree (body) where the Atman eats its fruits ([[karma]]), and the Paramatman only observes the Atman as a witness (sākṣin) of His friend's actions.

==Advaita==
In [[Advaita]] philosophy, individual souls are called Jīvātman, and the Highest Brahman is called Paramātman. The Jivatman and the Paramatman are known to be one and the same when the Jivatman attains the true knowledge of the Brahman (Skt. ''Brahmajñāna'')  . In the context of Advaita, the word Paramatman is invariably used to refer to [[Nirguna Brahman]], with [[Ishvara]] and [[Bhagavan]] being terms used to refer to Brahman with qualities, or [[Saguna Brahman]].

[[Brahman]] and [[Isvara]] are not synonymous words, the apparent similarity is on account of similar looking attributes imagined with regard to the impressions these two words activate. According to Advaita, Isvara is Brahman associated with Maya in its excellent aspect, as the empirical reality it is the determinate Brahman; Isvara has no reality apart from Brahman. The [[Svetasvatara Upanishad]] developed the conception of a personal God. The [[Katha Upanishad]] states that never has any man been able to visualise Paramatman by means of sight, heart, imagination or mind. The Anandamaya-kosha is the Isvara of the Upanishads. [[Gaudapada]] called duality Maya, and non-duality, the only reality. Maya is the Cosmic Nescience that has in it the plurality of subject and object and therefore, Isvara is organically bound with the world. Beyond the Prana or Isvara is the state of the Infinite limitless Brahman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A constructive survey of Upanishadic philosophy|author=Ramachandra Dattatrya Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|pages=189–197|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is why in the [[Bhagavad Gita]] VII.24, Krishna tells Arjuna – “not knowing My unsurpassable and undecaying supreme nature the ignorant believe Me to have assumed a finite form through birth.”

With regard to the cause of [[Samsāra]], as to where it resides and the means of its removal, [[Adi Shankara]] in his [[Vivekachudamani]].49. instructs that the individual self is the Paramatman in reality, the association of the individual self with ''ajnana'' i.e. with ''avidya'', which he terms as ''anatmabandhah'', bondage by the [[Anatman (Hinduism)|anatman]] or non-atman, makes it to identify itself with gross, subtle and causal bodies and from that arises [[Samsāra]] which is of the form of superimposition of qualities of ''sukha'', ''dukha'' etc., on itself, the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani|author=Sri Chandrashekhara Bharati of Sringeri|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncQYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=sri+samkara's+vivekacudamani&amp;dq=sri+samkara's+vivekacudamani&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cSjAUOuVM4vprQe-moHoCw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brahma Kumaris==
According to [[Brahma Kumaris]] religion, Paramatma (Supreme Soul) is called [[Shiva]], or Shiva Baba. His form is a point of infinitesimal light and his abode is Paramdham or [[Nirvana]].

==Vaishnavism==
Paramatman is beyond knowledge and ignorance, devoid of all material attributes ([[upadhi]]). In Chapter 13 of the [[Bhagavad Gita]], Paramatman is described as [[Krishna]] residing in the hearts of all beings and in every atom of matter. He is the overseer and the permitter of their actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vedabase.net/bg/13/23/en Bhagavad Gita 13.23] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312211826/http://vedabase.net/bg/13/23/en |date=12 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vedabase.net/sb/7/14/38/en Bhagavata Purana 7.14.38] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312212902/http://vedabase.net/sb/7/14/38/en |date=12 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paramatman is different from five elements (pancha mahabhutas), the [[sense]]s, [[mind]], [[pradhana]] and jiva.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vedabase.net/sb/3/28/41/en Bhagavata Purana 3.28.41] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217121958/http://vedabase.net/sb/3/28/41/en |date=17 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vaishnavism#Vaishnava sampradayas|Vaishnava sects]] maintain that attaining knowledge of Brahman and identification of Atman with Brahman is an intermediate stage of self-realization, and only [[Bhakti Yoga]] can lead to the next step of Paramatman realization as the indwelling God, ultimately leading up to liberation ([[Moksha|Mukti]]) by God-realization.

The Viṣṇu or the deity of the ''quality of goodness'' in the material world is the puruṣa-avatāra known as [[Ksirodakasayi Vishnu|Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu]] or ''Paramātmā''.[https://web.archive.org/web/20101123213949/http://vedabase.net/sb/1/2/23/en]

In Bengal, Vaishnava Krishna is viewed as one endowed with his essential svarupa-shakti, he is Bhagawat in full manifestation endowed with Jivasakti and Mayasakti, he the Paramatman and Brahman. Brahman, Paramatman and Bhagavan are 3 gradations of the ultimate reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Traditions of Mysticism in Bengal|author=Sandhu Santidev|publisher=Genesis Publishing (P) Ltd.|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGeitIm_--cC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=paramatman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Tk7VULagB9DQrAfEnIFY&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=paramatman&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time==
[[Time]] is described in Vedas:

{{quote|My Lord, I consider Your Lordship to be eternal time, the supreme controller, without beginning and end, the all-pervasive one. ... Eternal time is the witness of all our actions, good and bad, and thus resultant reactions are destined by Him. It is no use saying that we do not know why and for what we are suffering. We may forget the misdeed for which we may suffer at this present moment, but we must remember that Paramātmā is our constant companion, and therefore He knows everything, past, present and future. And because the Paramātmā feature of Lord Kṛṣṇa destines all actions and reactions, He is the supreme controller also. Without His sanction not a blade of grass can move.[http://vedabase.net/sb/1/8/28/en]}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36973">In [[philosophy]], '''physicalism''' is the [[metaphysical]] thesis that "everything is physical", that there is "nothing over and above" the physical,&lt;ref&gt;See Smart, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; or that everything [[supervenience|supervenes]] on the physical.&lt;ref name="DStoljar" /&gt; Physicalism is a form of ontological [[monism]]—a "one [[Substance theory|substance]]" view of the nature of reality as opposed to a "two-substance" ([[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]) or "many-substance" ([[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]]) view. Both the definition of "physical" and the meaning of physicalism have been debated.

Physicalism is closely related to [[materialism]]. Physicalism grew out of materialism with advancements of the physical sciences in explaining observed phenomena. The terms are often used interchangeably, although they are sometimes distinguished, for example on the basis of physics describing more than just matter (including energy and physical law). Common arguments against physicalism include both the [[philosophical zombie]] argument&lt;ref name="Chalmers, D. 1996" /&gt; and the multiple observers argument,&lt;ref name="Zuboff1990" /&gt; that the existence of a physical being may imply zero or more distinct conscious entities.

== Definition of physicalism ==
The word "physicalism" was introduced into philosophy in the 1930s by [[Otto Neurath]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physicalism/ Physicalism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of "physical" in physicalism is a philosophical concept and can be distinguished from alternative definitions found in the literature (e.g. [[Karl Popper]] defined a physical proposition to be one which can at least in theory be denied by observation&lt;ref name="Popper2002" /&gt;). A "physical property", in this context, may be a metaphysical or logical combination of properties which are  physical in the ordinary sense. It is common to express the notion of "metaphysical or logical combination of properties" using the notion of [[supervenience]]: A property ''A'' is said to supervene on a property ''B'' if any change in ''A'' necessarily implies a change in ''B''.&lt;ref&gt;See Bennett and McLaughlin, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Since any change in a combination of properties must consist of a change in at least one component property, we see that the combination does indeed supervene on the individual properties. The point of this extension is that physicalists usually suppose the existence of various abstract concepts which are non-physical in the ordinary sense of the word; so physicalism cannot be defined in a way that denies the existence of these abstractions. Also, physicalism defined in terms of supervenience does not entail that all properties in the actual world are [[type physicalism|type identical]] to physical properties. It is, therefore, compatible with [[multiple realizability]].&lt;ref&gt;See Putnam, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

From the notion of supervenience, we see that, assuming that mental, social, and biological properties supervene on physical properties, it follows that two hypothetical worlds cannot be identical in their physical properties but differ in their mental, social or biological properties.&lt;ref name="DStoljar" /&gt;

Two common approaches to defining "physicalism" are the theory-based and object-based approaches. The theory-based conception of physicalism proposes that "a property is physical if and only if it either is the sort of property that physical theory tells us about or else is a property which metaphysically (or logically) supervenes on the sort of property that physical theory tells us about".&lt;ref name="DStoljar" /&gt; Likewise, the object-based conception claims that "a property is physical if and only if: it either is the sort of property required by a complete account of the intrinsic nature of paradigmatic physical objects and their constituents or else is a property which metaphysically (or logically) supervenes on the sort of property required by a complete account of the intrinsic nature of paradigmatic physical objects and their constituents".

Physicalists have traditionally opted for a "theory-based" characterization of the physical either in terms of current physics,&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., Smart, 1978; Lewis, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; or a future (ideal) physics.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., Poland, 1994; Chalmers, 1996; Wilson, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; These two theory-based conceptions of the physical represent both horns of [[Hempel's dilemma]]&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Melnyk should apparently be credited with having introduced this name for Hempel's argument. See Melnyk, 1997, p.624&lt;/ref&gt; (named after the late philosopher of science and logical empiricist [[Carl Gustav Hempel]]): an argument against theory-based understandings of the physical. Very roughly, Hempel's dilemma is that if we define the physical by reference to current physics, then physicalism is very likely to be false, as it is very likely (by pessimistic meta-induction&lt;ref&gt;see Vincente, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;) that much of current physics is false. But if we instead define the physical in terms of a future (ideal) or completed physics, then physicalism is hopelessly vague or indeterminate.&lt;ref&gt;See Hempel, 1969, pp.180-183; Hempel, 1980, pp.194-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the force of Hempel's dilemma against theory-based conceptions of the physical remains contested,&lt;ref&gt;For a recent defence of the first horn see Melnyk, 1997. For a defence of the second, see Wilson, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; alternative "non-theory-based" conceptions of the physical have also been proposed. [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] (1998) for example, has argued in favour of the aforementioned "object-based" conception of the physical.&lt;ref&gt;See Jackson, 1998, p.7; Lycan, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; An objection to this proposal, which Jackson himself noted in 1998, is that if it turns out that [[panpsychism]] or [[panprotopsychism]] is true, then such a non-materialist understanding of the physical gives the counterintuitive result that physicalism is, nevertheless, also true since such properties will figure in a complete account of paradigmatic examples of the physical.

David Papineau&lt;ref&gt;See Papineau, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and Barbara Montero&lt;ref&gt;See Montero, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; have advanced and subsequently defended&lt;ref&gt;See Papineau and Montero, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; a "via negativa" characterization of the physical. The gist of the via negativa strategy is to understand the physical in terms of what it is not: the mental. In other words, the via negativa strategy understands the physical as "the non-mental". An objection to the via negativa conception of the physical is that (like the object-based conception) it doesn't have the resources to distinguish [[neutral monism]] (or panprotopsychism) from physicalism.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., Judisch, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supervenience-based definitions of physicalism ===

Adopting a supervenience-based account of the physical, the definition of physicalism as "all properties are physical" can be unravelled to:

1) Physicalism is [[Truth|true]] at a possible world ''w'' if and only if any world that is a physical duplicate of ''w'' is also a duplicate of ''w simpliciter''.&lt;ref name="See Jackson, 1998"&gt;See Jackson, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Applied to the actual world (our world), statement 1 above is the claim that physicalism is true at the actual world if and only if at ''every possible world'' in which the physical properties and laws of the actual  world are instantiated, the non-physical (in the ordinary sense of the word) properties of the actual world are instantiated as well. To borrow a metaphor from [[Saul Kripke]] (1972), the truth of physicalism at the actual world entails that once God has instantiated or "fixed" the physical properties and laws of our world, then God's work is done; the rest comes "automatically".

Unfortunately, statement 1 fails to capture even a necessary condition for physicalism to be true at a world ''w''. To see this, imagine a world in which there are ''only'' physical properties—if physicalism is true at any world it is true at this one. But one can conceive physical duplicates of such a world that are ''not'' also duplicates simpliciter of it: worlds that have the same physical properties as our imagined one, but with some additional property or properties. A world might contain "[[epiphenomenal ectoplasm]]", some additional pure experience that does not interact with the physical components of the world and is not necessitated by them (does not supervene on them).&lt;ref name="Lewis1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Horgan1982" /&gt; To handle the epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem, statement 1 can be modified to include a "that's-all" or "totality" clause&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; or be restricted to "positive" properties.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting the former suggestion here, we can reformulate statement 1 as follows:

2) Physicalism is true at a possible world ''w'' if and only if any world that is a ''minimal'' physical duplicate of ''w'' is a duplicate of ''w simpliciter''.&lt;ref name="See Jackson, 1998"/&gt;

Applied in the same way, statement 2 is the claim that physicalism is true at a possible world ''w'' if and only if any world that is a physical duplicate of ''w'' (without any further changes), is duplicate of ''w'' without qualification. This allows a world in which there are only physical properties to be counted as one at which physicalism is true, since worlds in which there is some extra stuff are ''not'' "minimal" physical duplicates of such a world, nor are they minimal physical duplicates of worlds that contain some non-physical properties that are metaphysically necessitated by the physical.&lt;ref&gt;Where "metaphysical necessitation" here simply means that if "B" metaphysically necessitates "A" then any world in which B is instantiated is a world in which A is instantiated--a consequence of the metaphysical supervenience of A upon B. See Kripke, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

But while statement 2 overcomes the problem of worlds at which there is some extra stuff (sometimes referred to as the "epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem"&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., Stoljar, 2009, section 4.3.&lt;/ref&gt;) it faces a different challenge: the so-called "blockers problem".&lt;ref&gt;See Hawthorne, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Imagine a world where the relation between the physical and non-physical properties at this world (call the world ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'') is slightly weaker than metaphysical necessitation, such that a certain kind of non-physical intervener—"a blocker"—could, were it to exist at ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,'' prevent the non-physical properties in ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' from being instantiated by the instantiation of the physical properties at ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.'' Since statement 2 rules out worlds which are physical duplicates of ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' that also contain non-physical interveners by virtue of the minimality, or that's-all clause, statement 2 gives the (allegedly) incorrect result that physicalism is true at ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.'' One response to this problem is to abandon statement 2 in favour of the alternative possibility mentioned earlier in which supervenience-based formulations of physicalism are restricted to what [[David Chalmers]] (1996) calls "positive properties". A positive property is one that "...if instantiated in a world W, is also instantiated by the corresponding individual in all worlds that contain W as a proper part."&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, 1996, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this suggestion, we can then formulate physicalism as follows:

3) Physicalism is true at a possible world ''w'' if and only if any world that is a physical duplicate of ''w'' is a positive duplicate of ''w''.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, 1996; Stoljar, 2009, section 4.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the face of it, statement 3 seems able to handle both the epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem and the blockers problem. With regard to the former, statement 3 gives the correct result that a purely physical world is one at which physicalism is true, since worlds in which there is some extra stuff are positive duplicates of a purely physical world. With regard to the latter, statement 3 appears to have the consequence that worlds in which there are blockers are worlds where positive non-physical properties of ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' will be absent, hence ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' will not be counted as a world at which physicalim is true.&lt;ref&gt;see Hawthorne, 2002, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Stoljar]] (2010) objects to this response to the blockers problem on the basis that since the non-physical properties of ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' aren't instantiated at a world in which there is a blocker, they are not positive properties in Chalmers' (1996) sense, and so statement 3 will count ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' as a world at which physicalism is true after all.&lt;ref&gt;See Stoljar, 2010, p.138&lt;/ref&gt;

A further problem for supervenience-based formulations of physicalism is the so-called "necessary beings problem".&lt;ref name="See Jackson, 1998"/&gt; A necessary being in this context is a non-physical being that exists in all possible worlds (for example what theists refer to as [[God]]). A necessary being is compatible with all the definitions provided, because it is supervenient on everything; yet it is usually taken to contradict the notion that everything is physical. So any supervenience-based formulation of physicalism will at best state a [[necessity and sufficiency|necessary but not sufficient]] condition for the truth of physicalism.&lt;ref name="See Jackson, 1998"/&gt;

Additional objections have been raised to the above definitions provided for supervenience physicalism: one could imagine an alternate world that differs only by the presence of a single ammonium molecule (or physical property), and yet based on statement 1, such a world might be completely different in terms of its distribution of mental properties.&lt;ref name="Kim1993" /&gt; Furthermore, there are differences expressed concerning the modal status of physicalism; whether it is a necessary truth, or is only true in a world which conforms to certain conditions (i.e. those of physicalism).&lt;ref name="DStoljar" /&gt;

=== Realisation physicalism ===

Closely related to supervenience physicalism, is realisation physicalism, the thesis that every instantiated property is either physical or realised by a physical property.&lt;ref name="Melnyk1997" /&gt;

=== Token physicalism ===
{{See also|Anomalous monism}}

Token physicalism is the proposition that "for every actual particular (object, event or process) x, there is some physical particular y such that x = y". It is intended to capture the idea of "physical mechanisms".&lt;ref name="DStoljar" /&gt; Token physicalism is compatible with [[property dualism]], in which all substances are "physical", but physical objects may have mental properties as well as physical properties. Token physicalism is not however equivalent to supervenience physicalism. Firstly, token physicalism does not imply supervenience physicalism because the former does not rule out the possibility of non-supervenient properties (provided that they are associated only with physical particulars). Secondarily, supervenience physicalism does not imply token physicalism, for the former allows supervenient objects (such as a "nation", or "soul") that are not equal to any physical object.

== Reductionism and emergentism ==

=== Reductionism ===

There are multiple versions of reductionism.&lt;ref name="DStoljar" /&gt; In the context of physicalism, the reductions referred to are of a "linguistic" nature, allowing discussions of, say, mental phenomena to be translated into discussions of physics. In one formulation, every concept is analysed in terms of a physical concept. One counter-argument to this supposes there may be an additional class of expressions which is non-physical but which increases the expressive power of a theory.&lt;ref name="Smart1959" /&gt; Another version of reductionism is based on the requirement that one theory (mental or physical) be logically derivable from a second.&lt;ref name="Nagel1961" /&gt;

The combination of reductionism and physicalism is usually called reductive physicalism in the philosophy of mind. The opposite view is non-reductive physicalism. Reductive physicalism is the view that mental states are both nothing over and above physical states and reducible to physical states. One version of reductive physicalism is [[type physicalism]] or mind-body identity theory. Type physicalism asserts that "for every actually instantiated property F, there is some physical property G such that F=G".&lt;ref name="DStoljar" /&gt; Unlike token physicalism, type physicalism entails supervenience physicalism.

A common argument against reductive physicalism is [[multiple realizability]], the possibility that a psychological process (say) could be instantiated by many different neurological processes (even non-neurological processes, in the case of machine or alien intelligence).&lt;ref name="Kim1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fodor1974" /&gt; For in this case, the neurological terms translating a psychological term must be disjunctions over the possible instantiations, and it is argued that no physical law can use these disjunctions as terms.&lt;ref name="Fodor1974" /&gt; Type physicalism was the original target of the multiple realizability argument.&lt;ref&gt;Bickle, J. (2006). Multiple realizability. In Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy. Available at http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiple-realizability/. Last revised in 2006, and last checked on May 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emergentism ===
{{main article|Emergentism}}

There are two versions of emergentism, the strong version and the weak version. Supervenience physicalism has been seen as a strong version of emergentism, in which the subject's psychological experience is considered genuinely novel.&lt;ref name="DStoljar" /&gt; Non-reductive physicalism, on the other side, is a weak version of emergentism because it does not need that the subject's psychological experience be novel. The strong version of emergentism is incompatible with physicalism. Since there are novel mental states, mental states are not nothing over and above physical states. However, the weak version of emergentism is compatible with physicalism. 

We can see that emergentism is actually a very broad view. Some forms of emergentism appear either incompatible with physicalism or equivalent to it (e.g. posteriori physicalism),&lt;ref name="Byrne1993" /&gt; others appear to merge both [[dualism (philosophy)|dualism]] and supervenience. Emergentism compatible with dualism claims that mental states and physical states are metaphysically distinct while maintaining the supervenience of mental states on physical states. This proposition however contradicts supervenience physicalism, which asserts a denial of dualism.

== A priori versus a posteriori physicalism ==
Physicalists hold that physicalism is true. A natural question for physicalists, then, is whether the truth of physicalism is deducible [[A priori knowledge|a priori]] from the nature of the physical world (i.e., the inference is justified independently of experience, even though the nature of the physical world can itself only be determined through experience) or can only be deduced [[A priori knowledge|a posteriori]] (i.e., the justification of the inference itself is dependent upon experience). So-called "a priori physicalists" hold that from knowledge of the [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] of all physical truths, a totality or that's-all truth (to rule out non-physical epiphenomena, and enforce the closure of the physical world), and some primitive [[indexical]] truths such as "I am A" and "now is B", the truth of physicalism is knowable a priori.&lt;ref name="See Chalmers and Jackson, 2001"&gt;See Chalmers and Jackson, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Let "P" stand for the conjunction of all physical truths and laws, "T" for a that's-all truth, "I" for the indexical "centering" truths, and "N" for any [presumably non-physical] truth at the actual world. We can then, using the [[material conditional]] "→", represent a priori physicalism as the thesis that PTI → N is knowable a priori.&lt;ref name="See Chalmers and Jackson, 2001"/&gt; An important wrinkle here is that the [[concept]]s in N must be possessed non-deferentially in order for PTI → N to be knowable a priori. The suggestion, then, is that possession of the concepts in the [[consequent]], plus the empirical information in the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] is sufficient for the consequent to be knowable a priori.

An "a posteriori physicalist", on the other hand, will reject the claim that PTI → N is knowable a priori. Rather, they would hold that the inference from PTI to N is justified by metaphysical considerations that in turn can be derived from experience. So the claim then is that "PTI and not N" is metaphysically impossible.

One commonly issued challenge to a priori physicalism and to physicalism in general is the "conceivability argument", or [[zombie argument]].&lt;ref&gt;See Chalmers, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; At a rough approximation, the conceivability argument runs as follows:

'''P1''') PTI and not Q (where "Q" stands for the conjunction of all truths about consciousness, or some "generic" truth about someone being "phenomenally" conscious [i.e., there is "something it is like"&lt;ref&gt;See Nagel, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; to be a person x] ) is conceivable (i.e., it is not knowable a priori that PTI and not Q is false).

'''P2''') If PTI and not Q is conceivable, then PTI and not Q is metaphysically possible.

'''P3''') If PTI and not Q is metaphysically possible then physicalism is false.

'''C''') Physicalism is false.&lt;ref&gt;See Chalmers, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Here proposition '''P3''' is a direct application of the supervenience of consciousness, and hence of any supervenience-based version of physicalism: If PTI and not Q is possible, there is some [[possible world]] where it is true. This world differs from [the relevant indexing on] our world, where PTIQ is true. But the other world is a minimal physical duplicate of our world, because PT is true there. So there is a possible world which is a minimal physical duplicate of our world, but not a full duplicate; this contradicts the definition of physicalism that we saw above.

Since a priori physicalists hold that PTI → N is a priori, they are committed to denying P1) of the conceivability argument. The a priori physicalist, then, must argue that PTI and not Q, on ideal rational reflection, is incoherent or [[contradictory]].&lt;ref&gt;For a survey of the different arguments for this conclusion (as well as responses to each), see Chalmers, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A posteriori physicalists, on the other hand, generally accept P1) but deny P2)--the move from "conceivability to metaphysical possibility". Some a posteriori physicalists think that unlike the possession of most, if not all other [[empirical]] concepts, the possession of consciousness has the special property that the presence of PTI and the absence of consciousness will be conceivable—even though, according to them, it is knowable a posteriori that PTI and not Q is not metaphysically possible. These a posteriori physicalists endorse some version of what Daniel Stoljar (2005) has called "the [[phenomenal concept strategy]]".&lt;ref&gt;See Stoljar, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly speaking, the phenomenal concept strategy is a label for those a posteriori physicalists who attempt to show that it is only the ''concept'' of consciousness—not the ''property''—that is in some way "special" or [[sui generis]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. Stoljar, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Other a posteriori physicalists&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Tye, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; eschew the phenomenal concept strategy, and argue that even ordinary macroscopic truths such as "water covers 60% of the earth's surface" are not knowable a priori from PTI and a non-deferential grasp of the concepts "water" and "earth" ''et cetera''. If this is correct, then we should (arguably) conclude that conceivability does not entail metaphysical possibility, and P2) of the conceivability argument against physicalism is false.&lt;ref&gt;For critical discussion, see Chalmers, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strawsonian physicalism ===

It is true that there is a sense in which this makes my use of the term vacuous, for, relative to our universe, 'physical stuff' is now equivalent to 'real and concrete stuff', and cannot be anything to do with the term 'physical' that is used to mark out a position in what is usually taken to be a substantive debate about the ultimate nature of concrete reality (physicalism vs immaterialism vs dualism vs pluralism vs…).

{{quote|Real physicalists must accept that at least some ultimates are intrinsically experience-involving.  They must at least embrace ''micropsychism''. Given that everything concrete is physical, and that everything physical is constituted out of physical ultimates, and that experience is part of concrete reality, it seems the only reasonable position, more than just an 'inference to the best explanation'... Micropsychism is not yet panpsychism, for as things stand realistic physicalists can conjecture that only some types of ultimates are intrinsically experiential.  But they must allow that panpsychism may be true, and the big step has already been taken with micropsychism, the admission that at least some ultimates must be experiential. 'And were the inmost essence of things laid open to us' I think that the idea that some but not all physical ultimates are experiential would look like the idea that some but not all physical ultimates are spatio-temporal (on the assumption that spacetime is indeed a fundamental feature of reality). I would bet a lot against there being such radical heterogeneity at the very bottom of things. In fact (to disagree with my earlier self) it is hard to see why this view would not count as a form of dualism... So now I can say that physicalism, i.e. real physicalism, entails panexperientialism or panpsychism. All physical stuff is energy, in one form or another, and all energy, I trow, is an experience-involving phenomenon. This sounded crazy to me for a long time, but I am quite used to it, now that I know that there is no alternative short of 'substance dualism'... Real physicalism, realistic physicalism, entails panpsychism, and whatever problems are raised by this fact are problems a real physicalist must face.&lt;ref name="Strawson2006"/&gt;|[[Galen Strawson]]|Consciousness and Its Place in Nature: Does Physicalism Entail Panpsychism?}}

In signal processing, the '''polynomial Wigner–Ville distribution''' is a [[quasiprobability distribution]] that generalizes the [[Wigner distribution function]]. It was proposed by Boualem Boashash and Peter O'Shea in 1994.

== Introduction ==

Many signals in nature and in engineering applications can be modeled as &lt;math&gt;z(t)=e^{j2\pi\phi(t)}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\phi(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial phase and &lt;math&gt;j=\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, it is important to detect signals of an arbitrary high-order polynomial phase. However, the conventional Wigner–Ville distribution have the limitation being based on the second-order statistics. Hence, the polynomial Wigner–Ville distribution was proposed as a generalized form of the conventional Wigner–Ville distribution, which is able to deal with signals with nonlinear phase.

== Definition ==

The polynomial Wigner–Ville distribution &lt;math&gt;W^g_z(t, f)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; W^g_z(t, f)=\mathcal{F}_{\tau\to f}\left[K^g_z(t, \tau)\right] &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{\tau\to f}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Fourier transform]] with respect to &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;K^g_z(t, \tau)&lt;/math&gt; is the polynomial kernel given by

:&lt;math&gt; K^g_z(t, \tau)=\prod_{k=-\frac{q}{2}}^{\frac{q}{2}} \left[z\left(t+c_k\tau\right)\right]^{b_k} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;z(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the input signal and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is an even number.
The above expression for the kernel may be rewritten in symmetric form as

:&lt;math&gt; K^g_z(t, \tau)=\prod_{k=0}^{\frac{q}{2}} \left[z\left(t+c_k\tau\right)\right]^{b_k}\left[z^*\left(t+c_{-k}\tau\right)\right]^{-b_{-k}} &lt;/math&gt;

The discrete-time version of the polynomial Wigner–Ville distribution is given by the [[discrete Fourier transform]] of

:&lt;math&gt; K^g_z(n, m)=\prod_{k=0}^{\frac{q}{2}} \left[z\left(n+c_{k}m\right)\right]^{b_k}\left[z^*\left(n+c_{-k}m\right)\right]^{-b_{-k}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n=t{f}_s, m={\tau}{f}_{s},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt; is the sampling frequency.
The conventional [[Wigner distribution function|Wigner–Ville distribution]] is a special case of the polynomial Wigner–Ville distribution with &lt;math&gt;q=2, b_{-1}=-1, b_1=1, b_0=0, c_{-1}=-\frac{1}{2}, c_0=0, c_1=\frac{1}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

== Example ==

One of the simplest generalizations of the usual Wigner–Ville distribution kernel can be achieved by taking &lt;math&gt;q=4&lt;/math&gt;. The set of coefficients &lt;math&gt;b_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_k&lt;/math&gt; must be found to completely specify the new kernel. For example, we set

:&lt;math&gt; b_1=-b_{-1}=2, b_2=b_{-2}=1, b_0=0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; c_1=-c_{-1}=0.675, c_2=-c_{-2}=-0.85&lt;/math&gt;

The resulting discrete-time kernel is then given by

:&lt;math&gt; K^g_z(n, m)=\left[z\left(n+0.675m\right)z^*\left(n-0.675m\right)\right]^2z^*\left(n+0.85m\right)z\left(n-0.85m\right) &lt;/math&gt;

=== Design of a Practical Polynomial Kernel ===
Given a signal &lt;math&gt;z(t)=e^{j2\pi\phi(t)}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\phi(t)=\sum_{i=0}^p a_i t^i&lt;/math&gt;is a polynomial function, its instantaneous frequency (IF) is &lt;math&gt;\phi'(t) = \sum_{i=1}^p ia_it^{i-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

For a practical polynomial kernel &lt;math&gt;K^g_z(t, \tau)&lt;/math&gt;, the set of coefficients &lt;math&gt;q, b_k&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;c_k&lt;/math&gt;should be chosen properly such that&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
K^g_z(t, \tau) &amp;=\prod_{k=0}^{\frac{q}{2}} \left[z\left(t+c_k\tau\right)\right]^{b_k}\left[z^*\left(t+c_{-k}\tau\right)\right]^{-b_{-k}}\\
&amp;= \exp(j2\pi \sum_{i=1}^pia_it^{i-1}\tau)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
W_z^g(t,f) &amp;= \int_{-\infin}^{\infin} \exp(-j2\pi(f - \sum_{i=1}^p i a_i t^{i-1}) \tau)d\tau\\
&amp;\cong \delta (f - \sum_{i=1}^p i a_i t^{i-1})
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* When &lt;math&gt;q=2, b_{-1}=-1, b_0=0, b_1=1, p=2&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;z\left(t+c_1\tau\right)z^*\left(t+c_{-1}\tau\right)=\exp(j2\pi \sum_{i=1}^2 i a_i t^{i-1}\tau)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_2(t+c_1)^2 + a_1(t+c_1) - a_2(t + c_{-1})^2 - a_1(t + c_{-1}) = 2a_2t\tau + a_1\tau&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow c_1 - c_{-1} = 1, c_1 + c_{-1} = 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow c_1=\frac{1}{2}, c_{-1}=-\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* When &lt;math&gt;q=4, b_{-2}=b_{-1}=-1, b_0=0, b_2=b_1=1, p=3&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;a_3(t + c_1)^3 + a_2(t+c_1)^2 + a_1(t+c_1) \\
&amp;a_3(t + c_2)^3 + a_2(t+c_2)^2 + a_1(t+c_2) \\
&amp;- a_3(t + c_{-1})^3 - a_2(t + c_{-1})^2 - a_1(t + c_{-1}) \\
&amp;- a_3(t + c_{-2})^3 - a_2(t + c_{-2})^2 - a_1(t + c_{-2}) \\
&amp;= 3a_3t^2\tau + 2a_2t\tau + a_1\tau
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow 
\begin{cases} 
c_1 + c_2 - c_{-1} - c_{-2} = 1 \\ 
c_1^2 + c_2^2 - c_{-1}^2 - c_{-2}^2 = 0 \\ 
c_1^3 + c_2^3 - c_{-1}^3 - c_{-2}^3 = 0 
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Applications ==

Nonlinear FM signals are common both in nature and in engineering applications. For example, the sonar system of some bats use hyperbolic FM and quadratic FM signals for echo location. In radar, certain pulse-compression schemes employ linear FM and quadratic signals. The [[Wigner distribution function|Wigner–Ville distribution]] has optimal concentration in the time-frequency plane for linear [[Frequency modulation|frequency modulated]] signals. However, for nonlinear frequency modulated signals, optimal concentration is not obtained, and smeared spectral representations result. The polynomial Wigner–Ville distribution can be designed to cope with such problem.

The '''prime time''' or the '''peak time''' is the block of [[broadcast programming]] taking place during the middle of the evening for [[television program]]ming.

The term ''prime time'' is often defined in terms of a fixed time period – for example (in the [[United States]]), from 8:00p.m. to 11:00p.m. (Eastern and Pacific Time) or 7:00p.m. to 10:00p.m. (Central and Mountain Time).

==Asia==

===Bangladesh===
In [[List_of_Bangladeshi_television_and_radio_channels|Bangladeshi Television Channels]], the 19:00-to-22:00 time slot is known as '''Prime Time'''.  Several National Broadcasters like [[Maasranga Television]], Gazi TV, Channel 9, Channel i broadcast their prime time shows from 20.00 to 23.00 after their Primetime news at 19.00. 
During [[Muslim holidays|Eid]] Season, most of the TV Stations broadcast their especially produced shows and World Television Premiers starting from 15.00 to 24.00.
In [[Ramadan]], the broadcasters also air special Religious and Cooking shows starting from 14.00 to 20.00 affecting the primetime hours. Besides, Late Night Talkshows are also aired from 01.00 to 04.00 with Ramadan being exception.&lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/channel/ntv-bangladesh/params/tvchannel/channelid-10000000016910000&lt;/ref&gt; Religious shows are also broadcast simultaneously from 01.00 along with Talkshows and News Analysis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/tv/eid-delights-the-small-screen-1424986&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
In [[Television in the People's Republic of China|Chinese television]], the 19:00-to-22:00 time slot is known as '''Golden Time''' ([[Traditional Chinese]]: 黄金時間; [[Simplified Chinese]]: 黄金时间; [[Pinyin]]: Huángjīn shíjiān). The term also influenced a nickname of a strip of holidays in known as [[Golden Week (China)|Golden Week]].

====Hong Kong and Macau====
Prime time usually takes place from 19:00 until 22:00. After that, programs classified as “PG” (Parental Guidance) are allowed to be broadcast. Frontline dramas appear during this time slot in Cantonese, as well as movies in English.

=== India ===
In [[India]], prime time occurs between 20:00 and 22:30. The main news programs are broadcast at 20:30, and the highest-rated television program is preceded by it at 20:00. Usually, programmes during prime time are domestic dramas, foreign drama series (mostly American), movies and entertainment programmes.

===Indonesia===
Prime time usually takes place from 18:00 to 23:00 [[Time in Indonesia|WIB]], preceded by a daily newscast at 17:00 (although some channels broadcast their daily evening newscasts earlier, usually at 16:00 or 16:30). After prime time, programs classified as '''Adult''', as well as cigarette commercials, are allowed to be broadcast,.

Like another [[Islam by country|Muslim-majority country]], there is also a 'midnight prime time' during [[suhoor|sahur]] time in a month of [[Ramadan]]. It takes place from 02:00 (or 02:30 in some channels) and ends at the [[Fajr]] prayer call, varies between 04:30 and 05:00. The time slot is usually filled with comedy and religious programming.

===Iraq===
In [[Iraq]], prime time runs from 20:00 to 23:00. The main news programs are broadcast at 20:00 and the highest-rated television program airs at 21:00.

===Japan===
In [[Japanese television programs|Japanese television]], the 19:00-to-22:00 time slot is also known as {{Nihongo|'''Golden Time'''|ゴールデン・タイム|gōruden taimu|extra=or just '''Golden'''}}. The term also influenced a nickname of a strip of holidays in known as [[Golden Week (Japan)|Golden Week]].

===Malaysia===
[[Malaysia]]n prime time starts with the main news from 20:00 to 20:30 (now 20:00 to 21:00) and ends either at 23:00 or 0:30, or possibly later. Usually, programmes during prime time are domestic dramas, foreign drama series (mostly American), films and entertainment programmes. Programmes classified as 18 are not allowed to be broadcast before 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. but on [[Radio Televisyen Malaysia|RTM]], most programmes on this slot are rated U (U means ''Umum'' in Malay and literally General Viewing or General Audiences in English) throughout the whole day. However, programmes broadcast after 23:00 are still considered prime time. As of December 2010, [[NTV7]]'s prime time continues until 12:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. Programmes during prime time may have longer commercial breaks due to number of viewers.

Some domestic prime time productions may be affected because of certain major sporting events such as [[FIFA World Cup]]. However, only FIFA World Cup in the [[Americas]] did not affect the domestic prime time programmes.

=== Pakistan ===
In [[Pakistan]], The prime time begins between 20:00 - 22:00 [[Pakistan Standard Time]]. During this time majority of the local channels broadcast news and or drama serials, however on state channels it has been observed that they broadcast Khabarnama (New Bulletin) from past many decades.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, prime time blocks begin at 18:00 (now 17:50 or 17:00) and run until about 23:00 (or 23:30) on weekdays, and 19:00 to 23:00 on weekends. The weekday prime time blocks usually consists of local [[teleserye]]s (soap operas) and foreign television series. The network's highest-rated programs are usually aired right after the evening newscast at 20:00, while a foreign series usually precedes the late night newscast.

On weekends, non-scripted programming such as talent shows, reality shows and current affairs shows air in prime time. For the minor networks, prime time consists of American television series on weekdays, with encores of those shows on weekends. Prime time originally started earlier at around 19:00, but the evening newscasts were lengthened to 90 minutes and now start at 18:30, instead of the original one-hour newscast that starts at 18:00.

===Singapore===
In [[Singapore]], prime time begins at 18:30 on [[MediaCorp Channel 8]] and 19:00 on [[MediaCorp Channel 5]], [[MediaCorp Channel U]], [[Channel NewsAsia]], [[MediaCorp Suria]], [[MediaCorp Vasantham]] and [[Okto|MediaCorp Okto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mda.gov.sg/Documents/AnnualReport/2013/documents/MDA_AR_Annex.pdf "MDA Annual Report Annex"], ' '[[Media Development Authority]]' ', March 2013. Retrieved 9 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; which are also the main (Free-to-air) television channels in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;[[Television in Singapore]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediacorp.sg/corporate-en/corporate |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524070203/http://www.mediacorp.sg/corporate-en/corporate |archivedate=2015-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Channel U, prime time ends at 23:00 seven days a week and on Okto, prime time ends at closedown at 24:00 or later. Generally, however, prime time is considered to be from 18:30 to 00:00.

===South Korea===
In [[South Korea]], prime time usually runs from 20:00 to 23:00 during the week, while on Saturdays and Sundays, it runs from 18:00 to 23:00. Family-oriented television shows are broadcast before 22:00, and adult-oriented television shows air after 22:00.

===Taiwan===
In [[Taiwan]], prime time (called ''bādiǎn dàng'' - [[:zh:八點檔|八點檔]] - in Mandarin Chinese) starts at 20:00 in the evening. [[Taiwanese drama]] series played then are called 8 o'clock series and are expected to have high viewer ratings.

===Thailand===
In [[Thailand]], prime time dramas (ละคร; la-korn) air from 20:30 to 22:30. Most dramas are soap operas. Prime time dramas are popular and influential to Thai society.

===Vietnam===

==Europe==

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], prime time starts at 20.00 and finishes at 22.00. It is preceded by a daily newscast (''Dnevnik'') at 19.00 and followed by a late night newscast (''Vijesti'') at 22.00.

===Croatia===
In [[Croatia]], prime time starts between 20.00 and 20.15. Croatian public broadcaster [[Croatian Radiotelevision|HRT]] broadcasts a daily newscast from 19.00 to 20.00{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Also, many private broadcasters have daily newscasts either before or after the HTY newscast, at around 20.05, followed by the start of their own prime time. Many broadcasters without daily newscasts start their prime time at 20.00. Prime time generally ends between 22.00 and 23.00, followed by the late night edition of the network newscast and adult-oriented programming.

===Denmark===
In [[Denmark]], prime time starts at 20.00.

===Finland===
In [[Finland]], prime time starts at 21.00. It is preceded by a daily newscast at 20.30.

===France===
In [[France]] prime time runs from 21.00 (after the main channels' evening news programmes) until around 22.30.

===Georgia===
In Georgia, prime time starts between 18.45 and 20.00 and generallly ends at 24.00. However, on Friday night / Saturday morning prime time usually continues until 1.00.

===Germany===
At 20.00 each evening [[Das Erste]] (The First), Germany's oldest public television network, airs the country's most-watched news broadcast, the main edition of the ''[[Tagesschau (Germany)|Tagesschau]]'' – which is also simulcast on most of its other specialist and regional channels (The Third). The conclusion of the bulletin 15 minutes later marks the beginning of prime time, as it has since the 1950s. In consequence, most channels also choose to start their prime time at 20.15. In the 1990s, the commercial channel [[Sat.1]] suffered a significant loss of audience share when it tried moving the start of its prime time to 20.00.

===Greece===
In [[Greece]], prime time runs from 21.00 (usually following the news) to 24.00.

===Hungary===
In [[Hungary]], prime time on weekdays on the two big commercial stations ([[RTL Klub]] and [[TV2 (Hungary)|TV2]]) starts at 19.00 with game shows, tabloid and docu-reality programmes. At 21.00, two popular soap operas air: ''Barátok közt'' and ''Jóban Rosszban'', which follows at 21.30. American and other series, movies, talk-shows and magazines run until 23.30. The prime-time lineup is preceded by daily news programmes at 18.30. At weekends prime time begins at 19.00, with blockbuster movies and television shows.

Before 15 March 2015, the public television station [[M1 (TV channel)|M1]] began its prime time with a game show at 18.30, which was followed by the daily news programme ''Híradó'' at 19.30. After the news, the channel broadcast American and other series, talk shows, magazines, and news programmes until 22.00, after which came the daily news magazine ''Este'' and the late edition of ''Híradó''.

From 15 March 2015, [[Duna Televízió|Duna]] began broadcasting all of the entertainment programming transferred to it from that date from M1, meaning that prime time on Duna now begins at 18.00, starting with the simulcast of the 18.00 edition of Híradó from the newly re-launched news channel, M1.

===Iceland===
In [[Iceland]], prime time starts at 19:30. It is preceded by a daily newscast at 19:00.

===Italy===
In [[Italy]], prime time (called "prima serata") is from 21:00&amp;nbsp;to 23:30. It usually follows news and, on some networks (like [[Rai 1]] and [[Canale 5]]), a slot called “access prime time”. Shows, movies, and sport events are usually shown during prime time.

===Netherlands===
Much like in Germany, prime time in the [[Netherlands]] usually begins at 20:30 in order to not compete with [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]]'s flagship 20:00 newscast.

===Norway===
In [[Norway]], prime time starts at 19:45. On the [[NRK1]] channel it is preceded by the daily newscast ''[[Dagsrevyen]]'' at 19:00. Locally, prime time is called {{lang|no|beste sendetid}} (lit. "best time for broadcasting").

===Poland===
In [[Poland]], prime time starts around 20:00 (sometimes 20:30). On ([[TVP 1]]) It is preceded by a daily newscast at 19:30, on ([[TVN (Poland)|TVN]]) the newscast is aired at 19:00 followed by the newsmagazine Uwaga at 19:50 (weekdays)/19:45 (weekends) and then the soap Na Wspólnej at 20:05 (Monday to Thursday, from Friday to Sunday (at 20:00) various: movies on Friday, show or movies (Winter and Summer) at Saturday, and programme or movies (Winter and Summer) at Sunday), on ([[Polsat]]) the news is aired at 18:50, followed by a sitcom Świat według Kiepskich at 19:30.

===Russia===
In [[Russia]] television prime time is between 19:00 and 23:00 on working days and from 15:00 to 01:00 on holidays.
On radio stations there are morning, day and evening prime times. The most common division:
morning — 6:30 to 10:00;
day — с 12:00 to 14:00;
evening - 16:00 to 21:00.

===Slovakia===
Public television in Slovakia consists of two channels; on the main channel ([[Jednotka]]) prime time starts at 20:10, and on the second one ([[Dvojka]]) prime time programming starts at 20:00. The two biggest private broadcasters set the start of prime time programming at 20:20 ([[Markíza]]) and 20:30 ([[TV JOJ|JOJ]]). Generally, however, prime time is considered to be from 20:00 to 23:00.

===Slovenia===
In [[Slovenia]], prime time, the period in which the most-watched shows are broadcast, is from 8:00pm to 11:00pm. It is preceded by daily newscasts; Dnevnik RTV SLO (7:00pm–8:00pm) on TV SLO 1, 24ur (6:55pm–8:00pm) on POP TV, Svet na Kanalu A (6:00pm–7:00pm; 7:50pm–8:0pm), and Danes (7:30pm–8:00pm) on Planet TV.

===Spain===
In [[Spain]], prime time refers to the time period in which the most-watched shows are broadcast. Prime time in Spain starts quite late when compared to most nations as it runs from 22:30 till 01:00. Most news programmes in Spain air at 21:00 for an hour and prime time follows. However, due to fierce competition, especially among the private stations prime time has even been delayed until 23:00. Most channels are delaying prime time in order to protect their top shows from sporting events.

In the 1990s, prime time in Spain began at 21:00, moving to 21:30 in the latter half of the 1990s and 22:00 in the early 2000s. Commercial broadcaster [[laSexta]] and the second channel from the Public broadcasting [[La 2 (Spain)|La 2]] have attempted to shift prime time back to 21:30 in 2006 and Spring 2007, but these attempts have been unsuccessful. Fellow public channel [[La 1 (Spain)|La 1]] also tried to pull prime time back to 21:00 in early 2015, to no avail.

The lateness in the start of prime time in Spain is also due to Spanish culture. Spanish people generally work from 09:00-14:00 and then from 17:00-20:00 as opposed to the standard 09:00-17:00. The popular late night show ''Crónicas Marcianas'' during the late 1990s–2000 also helped to extend prime time well into the early hours with the show being watched by a share of 40%, despite finishing at 02:00.

Spain might also be unique in that it has a second prime time, running from 14:30-17:00 which coincides with the extended Spanish lunch break. Shows airing in the secondary prime time period on many occasions beat those prime time shows at night on a daily basis. The second prime time only occurs on weekdays, though and the slot is usually filled with [[The Simpsons]], news, soap operas and talk shows.

===Sweden===
In [[Sweden]], prime time starts at 20:00. It is preceded by a daily newscast at 19:30 and local news at 19:50.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, the term used is '''peak time''', early peak is 17:30 to 20:00 and late peak is 20:00 to 23:00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/itc/itc_publications/codes_guidance/programme_code/section_4.asp.html|title=Regulator Archives|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin America==
In a great part of [[Television in Latin America|Latin America]]n countries, prime time is considered to be from 6:00 or 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to 10:00 or 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. The time slot is usually used for [[news]], [[telenovelas]] and [[television series]], and special time slots are used for [[reality shows]], with great popularity, especially in [[Television in Mexico|Mexico]] and [[Television in Brazil|Brazil]]. In Mexico, Prime Time is known as ''horario estelar'' ("Stellar Time"). In Brazil, it is called ''horário nobre'' (“noble time”), which is the time the three most famous telenovelas in the country are shown each weekday and on Saturdays. There are also news programs, reality shows, and sitcoms.

===Argentina===
In [[Television in Argentina|Argentina]], prime time is considered to be from 8.00 p.m. until 12.00 a.m.; with the most successful series and telenovelas in the country (such as ''[[Los Roldán]]'' and ''[[Valientes]]''), and entertainment shows, like CQC (Caiga Quien Caiga).

===Chile===
In [[Chile]], prime time is considered to be from 10.30 p.m. until 01.00 a.m.; with the most successful series and telenovelas in the country (such as ''Socias'' and ''Las Vega's''). Investigation entertainment shows (like ''[[Informe especial|Informe Especial]]'', ''Contacto'', ''Apuesto por tí'') also air.

In [[North America]], [[television network]]s feed their prime time programming in two blocks: one for the [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]], [[Central Time Zone|Central]], and [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]] [[time zone]]s, and one for the [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]], [[Alaskan Time Zone|Alaskan]], and [[Hawaii-Aleutian time zone|Hawaiian]] time zones, to their local [[network affiliate]]s. In [[Atlantic Canada]] (including [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]) as well as Alaska and Hawaii, there is no change in the interpretation or usage of “prime time” as the concept is not attached to time zones in any way. Affiliates in the Mountain, Alaskan, and Hawaii-Aleutian zones are either on their own to delay broadcast by an hour or two, or collectively form a small, regional network feed with others in the same time zone.

Prime time is commonly defined as 8:00-11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern/Pacific and 7:00-10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Central/Mountain. On Sundays, the major broadcast television networks traditionally begin their primetime programming at 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. (Eastern/Pacific, 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Central/Mountain) instead. Some networks such as [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[The CW]], and [[MyNetworkTV]] only broadcast from 8:00-10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., a time period known as "common prime". Most networks air primetime programming nightly, but the smaller MyNetworkTV only broadcasts prime time programs on weekdays, and The CW only broadcasts on weekdays and Sundays as of 2018, leaving weekends to their affiliates. In Canada, [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] and [[Global Television Network|Global]] both follow the same model as the larger U.S. networks (although CTV may occasionally air programming in the 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. hour in the event of scheduling conflicts with other U.S. imports), while [[CBC Television]], [[Citytv (TV network)|Citytv]] and [[CTV Two]] only schedule prime time programs within the common prime period (with the 10:00 p.m.&amp;nbsp;p.m. hour dedicated to syndicated programming on City and CTV Two, and CBC airing its news program ''[[The National (TV program)|The National]]'').

The major networks have come to consider Saturday prime time as a [[graveyard slot]], and have largely abandoned scheduling of new scripted programming on that night. The major networks still maintain a prime time programming schedule on Saturdays; while live sporting events (most commonly [[college football]] in the United States and [[ice hockey]] in Canada) are generally preferred to fill the time slot, they typically air encores of programs aired earlier in the week, films, non-scripted reality programs, [[true crime]] programs produced by their news divisions and, occasionally, [[Burning off|burned off]] episodes of low-rated or cancelled series.

Prime time can be extended or truncated if coverage of sporting events run past their allotted end time. Since the "[[Heidi Game]]" incident in 1968, in which [[NBC]] cut away from coverage of a [[New York Jets]]/[[Oakland Raiders]] football game on the east coast in order to show a movie (and, in the process, causing viewers to miss an unexpected comeback by the Raiders to win the game), the later [[National Football League]] mandated that all games be broadcast in their entirety in the markets of the teams involved. Due to this rule, game telecasts may sometimes overrun into the 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET hour. [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] previously scheduled repeats of its animated series in the 7:00 hour, allowing themselves to simply pre-empt the reruns if a game ran long. This was later replaced by a half-hour-long wrap-up show, ''[[The OT]]''. In contrast, [[CBS]] does not, as its weekly newsmagazine ''[[60 Minutes]]'' has traditionally aired as close to 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET as possible. Even if a game runs past that hour, CBS shows ''60 Minutes'' in its entirety after the conclusion of coverage, and the rest of the prime time schedule on the East Coast is shifted to compensate. For example, if game coverage were to end at 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., prime time would end at 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.

However, in the rare case where the NFL game runs excessively late (8 p.m. or later), the series scheduled to air at 10 p.m. is preempted, with the West Coast usually receiving a repeat of the 10 p.m. series instead. In an extreme case, CBS's prime time can be extended past midnight during broadcasts of the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]]. This does not necessarily apply universally; in 2001, after an [[XFL]] game went into double overtime, causing a 45-minute delay of a highly promoted episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', [[NBC]] made a decision to cut off all future XFL broadcasts at 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET. Since the launch of [[NBCSN]], NBC has occasionally invoked this curfew by moving event overruns to the channel when allowed.

Until the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regulated time slots prior to prime time with the now-defunct [[Prime Time Access Rule]] in the 1971–1972 season, networks began programming at 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific/6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. Central and Mountain on weeknights. The change helped instigate what is colloquially known as the "[[rural purge]]"—a long-term trend away from programs appealing to older and rural audiences in favor of programs catering towards younger, "urban" viewers. As a result, the hour became a lucrative timeslot for syndicated programming in the years that followed, with [[game show|game]] and [[variety show]]s, as well as other syndicated reruns, becoming popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-09-14/entertainment/ca-4986_1_prime-time-lineup|title=Syndicated-tv Reviews :  Prime-time Lead-ins On Nbc: Joke's On Viewers|last=ROSENBERG|first=HOWARD|date=1987-09-14|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-09-13/entertainment/8703100482_1_checkerboard-format-network-budget-viewers|title=COMEDIES TRYING TO GET THE JUMP ON GAME SHOWS|last=Daley|first=Steve|work=Chicago Tribunemaccess-date=2018-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2004/12/02/tvs-rural-purge/2516ce4b-9140-4f92-b30f-6bb3a9582ca1/|title=TV's 'Rural Purge'|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of prime time programming in English-speaking North America comes from the United States, with only a limited amount produced in [[Canada]]. The [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] mandates quotas for [[Canadian content]] in prime time; these quotas indicate at least half of Canadian prime time programs must be Canadian in origin, but the majority of this is served by national and [[local news]] or localized entertainment gossip shows such as [[Global Television Network|Global]]'s ''[[Entertainment Tonight Canada|ET Canada]]'' and [[CTV Television Network|CTV]]'s ''[[eTalk]]''.

Likewise, the vast majority of Spanish-language programming in North America comes from [[Mexico]]. [[Televisa]], a Mexican network, provides the majority of programming to the dominant U.S.-based Spanish broadcaster, [[Univision]]. Univision does produce a fairly large amount of unscripted Spanish-language programming, the best known having been the long-running variety show ''[[Sábado Gigante]]'', hosted and created by Chilean national [[Don Francisco (television host)|Don Francisco]]. Univision's distant second-place competitor, [[Telemundo]], produces a much greater share of in-house content, including a long line of [[telenovela]]s.

In Quebec, the largest Francophone area of North America, French-language programming consists of originally produced programs (most of which are produced in [[Montreal]], with a few produced in Quebec City) and a few French-language dubs of English language programs. On all of the Quebec networks, entertainment programming is scheduled only between 8 and 10 p.m., with the 10-11 p.m. hour given over to a network newscast or a nightly talk show.

===Prime time in the context of U.S. radio/TV-revenues===
Prime time is the [[daypart]] (a block of a day's programming schedule) with the most viewers and is generally where [[television networks]] and local stations reap much of their advertising revenues. In recent years television advertising expenditure in the US has been highest during prime-time drama shows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statista.com/statistics/223207/genre-breakdown-of-primetime-tv-ad-spend-in-the-us/ Genre breakdown of primetime TV advertising expenditure in the United States in 2011]. Nielsen. April 2012. Retrieved November 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nielsen ratings]] system is explicitly designed for the optimum measurement of audience viewership by dayparts with prime time being of most interest. Most people tend to watch television at prime time, as most often, based on standard [[working time]], the end of the work day coincides with prime time viewing hours. Most viewers sit down to watch TV after dinner. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} This is usually the main reason for the high ratings for television programming at this time, as well as the attraction of the timeslot for advertisers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The existence of prime time in the United States is largely an artifact of now repealed regulations of the [[Federal Communications Commission]], which limited the number of hours that a network can require its affiliates to broadcast.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Additionally, networks may also choose to provide [[Network affiliate|local affiliates]] the opportunity to air [[sport]]ing events or other special events which may fall outside of standard designated network broadcast times.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Prime time for radio is called “Drive time” and, in Eastern and Pacific Time, is 6–10 a.m. and 3–7 p.m. and, for Mountain and Central Time, is 5–9 a.m. and 2–6 p.m.

A survey by Nielsen revealed that viewers watched almost two hours worth of TV during prime time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketingcharts.com/wp/television/how-much-tv-do-people-watch-during-the-day-28359/ How Much TV Do People Watch During the Day?] Marketingcharts.com. April 4, 2013. Retrieved November 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oceania==

===Australia===
Prime time in [[Television in Australia|Australia]] is officially from 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to midnight, following [[Australian Eastern Standard Time]], with the highest ratings normally achieved between 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.

===New Zealand===
Traditionally, prime time in [[Television in New Zealand|New Zealand]] is considered to be 7:30pm to 10:30pm, but can be extended to cover the entire evening of television (5:30pm to 11:00pm).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4027">In [[differential geometry]], a '''quaternion-Kähler symmetric space''' or '''Wolf space''' is a [[quaternion-Kähler manifold]] which, as a Riemannian manifold, is a [[Riemannian symmetric space]]. Any quaternion-Kähler symmetric space with positive Ricci curvature is [[compact space|compact]] and [[simply connected]], and is a Riemannian product of quaternion-Kähler symmetric spaces associated to compact [[simple Lie group]]s.

For any compact simple Lie group ''G'', there is a unique  ''G''/''H'' obtained as a quotient of ''G'' by a subgroup

:&lt;math&gt; H = K \cdot \mathrm{Sp}(1).\, &lt;/math&gt;

Here, Sp(1) is the compact form of the SL(2)-triple associated with the highest root of ''G'', and ''K'' its [[centralizer]] in ''G''. These are classified as follows.

The [[quaternion-Kähler manifold#Twistor spaces|twistor spaces]] of quaternion-Kähler symmetric spaces are the homogeneous holomorphic [[contact manifold]]s, classified by Boothby: they are the [[adjoint variety|adjoint varieties]] of the complex [[semisimple Lie group]]s.

These spaces can be obtained by taking a [[projectivization]] of
a minimal [[nilpotent orbit]] of the respective complex Lie group.
The holomorphic contact structure is apparent, because
the nilpotent orbits of semisimple Lie groups 
are equipped with the [[Kirillov-Kostant form|Kirillov-Kostant]] holomorphic symplectic form. This argument also explains how one
can associate a unique Wolf space to each of the simple
complex Lie groups.

'''Racialism''' is the belief that the [[anatomically modern humans|human species]] is naturally divided into [[Race (human categorization)|races]], that are ostensibly distinct biological categories. Most dictionaries define the term ''racialism'' as synonymous with [[racism]].&lt;ref&gt;Chester L. Quarles (2004).  ''Christian Identity: The Aryan American Bloodline Religion''. McFarland.

==Definitions and differences==
[[Image:WEB DuBois 1918.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[W. E. B. Du Bois]], 1918]]

In 1903, [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] said that racialism is the philosophical position that races existed, and that collective differences existed among such categories, the races.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} He further stated that [[racism]] required advancing the argument that one race is superior to other races of human beings. In ''In My Father’s House'' (1992), [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] summarized Du Bois's philosophical stance that ''racialism'' is value-neutral term and that ''racism'' is a value-charged term.

Today, some anthropologists and geneticists point to studies that suggest racialist beliefs are both compatible and incompatible with modern [[population genetics]].{{clarify|date=February 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/busting-myths-about-human-nature/201204/race-is-real-not-in-the-way-many-people-think Race Is Real, but not in the way Many People Think], Agustín Fuentes, ''Psychology Today.com'', April 09, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Epigenetics and the embodiment of race: Developmental origins of US racial disparities in cardiovascular health|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|volume=21|issue=1|pages=2–15|author= Kuzawa and Sweet|quote=We conclude that environmentally responsive phenotypic plasticity, in combination with the better-studied acute and chronic effects of social-environmental exposures, provides a more parsimonious explanation than genetics for the persistence of CVD disparities between members of socially imposed racial categories.|doi=10.1002/ajhb.20822|pmid=18925573|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genetic variation, classification and 'race'|publisher=Nature|author=|location=|accessdate=November 18, 2014|quote=Ancestry, then, is a more subtle and complex description of an individual's genetic makeup than is race.

==Identity politics==
Richard T. Ford claimed that although "there is no necessary correspondence between the ascribed identity of race and one's culture or personal sense of self" and "group difference is not intrinsic to members of social groups but rather contingent o[n] the social practices of group identification", the social practices of identity politics may coerce individuals into the "compulsory" enactment of "prewritten racial scripts".&lt;ref&gt;Richard T. Ford, Racial Culture: A Critique, Princeton University Press, 2009, pp. 117–18, 125–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Yasuko Takezawa, there needs to be anticipation of various potential social and ethical problems associated with population descriptors when studying the genetic differences between populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human genetic research, race, ethnicity and the labeling of populations: recommendations based on an interdisciplinary workshop in Japan|publisher=BMC Medical Ethics|author= Yasuko Takezawa|location=|accessdate=December 13, 2014|quote=In this age of genomics, differences between populations are often reported as having genetic bases.

'''Section 2''' of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' ("''Charter''") is the section of the [[Constitution of Canada]] that lists what the ''Charter'' calls "fundamental freedoms" theoretically applying to everyone in Canada, regardless of whether they are a Canadian citizen, or an individual or [[corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-15.html#s-2. | title = Constitution Acts, 1867 to 1982 | accessdate = 2014-02-15 | author = Justice Laws Website, Site Web de la législation (Justice) | date = 2014-01-30 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140119183913/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-15.html | archivedate = 2014-01-19 | quote = Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms}}&lt;/ref&gt; These freedoms can be held against actions of all levels of government and are enforceable by the courts. The fundamental freedoms are [[freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], [[freedom of religion]], [[freedom of thought]], [[freedom of belief]], [[freedom of assembly|freedom of peaceful assembly]] and [[freedom of association]].

[[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 1]] of the ''Charter'' permits Parliament or the provincial legislatures to enact laws that place certain kinds of limited restrictions on the freedoms listed under section 2. Additionally, these freedoms can be temporarily invalidated by [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 33]], the "notwithstanding clause", of the ''Charter''.

As a part of the ''Charter'' and of the larger ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]'', section 2 took legal effect on April 17, 1982. However, many of its rights have roots in Canada in the 1960 ''[[Canadian Bill of Rights]]'' (although this law was of limited effectiveness), and in traditions under a theorized [[Implied Bill of Rights]]. Many of these exemptions, such as freedom of expression, have also been at the centre of [[Canadian federalism|federalistic]] disputes.

==Text==
Under the heading of "Fundamental Freedoms" the section states:
{{quote|2.  Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms:

(a) freedom of conscience and religion;

(b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication;

(c) freedom of peaceful assembly; and

(d) freedom of association.}}

==Freedom of religion==
{{see also|Freedom of religion in Canada}}

===Background===
According to [[Beverley McLachlin]], freedom of religion in Canada may have originated as early as 1759, when [[French Canadian]] [[Roman Catholic]]s were allowed rights of worship by their British conquerors; this was later reconfirmed in 1774 in the ''[[Quebec Act]]''. Later the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' provided for denominational school rights&lt;ref&gt;Beverley McLachlin, "Freedom of Religion and the Rule of Law:  A Canadian Perspective," in ''Recognizing Religion in a Secular Society: Essays in Pluralism, Religion, and Public Policy''. Ed. Douglas Farrow. McGill-Queen's University Press, 2004, pages 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; (these are reaffirmed by [[Section Twenty-nine of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 29 of the ''Charter'']]). Discussions of church-state relations also took place in the [[Guibord case]] of 1874. In 1955, the Supreme Court ruled in ''Chaput v Romain'',&lt;ref&gt;[1955] SCR 834.&lt;/ref&gt; regarding [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], that different religions have rights, based upon tradition and the [[rule of law]] (at the time no statutes formed the basis for this argument).&lt;ref&gt;McLachlin, "Freedom of Religion and the Rule of Law:  A Canadian Perspective," pages 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious freedom was later included in the ''Canadian Bill of Rights''.  However, its effectiveness was limited. When Sunday closing laws compelling respect for the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Christian Sabbath]] were challenged in ''R v Robertson and Rosetanni'',&lt;ref&gt;[1963] SCR 651&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Ritchie of the Supreme Court found that non-Christians merely lost money when denied rights to work on Sunday and were otherwise free to believe in and observe their own religions.

===Definition===
Freedom of religion under section 2(a) of the ''Charter'' was first seriously considered by the Supreme Court in ''[[R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1985] 1 SCR 295.&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, Chief Justice Brian Dickson wrote that this freedom at least includes freedom of religious speech, including "the right to entertain such religious beliefs as a person chooses, the right to declare religious beliefs openly and without fear of hindrance or reprisal, and the right to manifest religious belief by worship and practice or by teaching and dissemination." Freedom of religion would also prohibit imposing religious requirements. The immediate consequence of section 2, in this case, was the abolishment of federal Sunday closing laws.

In ''[[Syndicat Northcrest v Amselem]]'',&lt;ref&gt;2004 SCC 47.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court drew up a definition of freedom of religion under the ''[[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]]'', mindful of the overlap with section 2(a). The majority found freedom of religion encompasses a right to religious practices if the individual has a sincere belief that the practice is connected to religion.  It would not matter whether the practice was needed according to religious authority.  If courts can believe an individual is telling the truth in saying a practice is connected to religion, the courts then ask whether the infringement of freedom of religion is severe enough to trigger section 2. The Court also said religious beliefs are vacillating, so courts trying to determine an individual belief should be mindful that beliefs may change. Following this test in ''[[Multani v Commission scolaire Marguerite‑Bourgeoys]]'',&lt;ref&gt;2006 SCC 6.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court found freedom of religion should protect a non-violent [[Sikh]] student's right to wear a ''[[kirpan]]'' (dagger) in school.

In ''R v NS'',&lt;ref&gt;2012 SCC 72.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court sought to find a middle ground on the issue of whether a witness can wear a face-covering [[niqāb]] while testifying in a criminal trial. The court found that the right to religious freedom must be balanced against the right of the accused to a fair trial.

===Freedom of conscience===
In addition to freedom of religion, section 2(a) also guarantees freedom of conscience. Professor [[Peter Hogg]] speculated this would include a right to [[atheism]], despite the [[preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which recognizes the "supremacy of God".&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W.  ''Canada Act 1982 Annotated.''  Toronto, Canada:  The Carswell Company Limited, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; The right has not spawned a great deal of case law, although Justice [[Bertha Wilson]] did rely on it in her opinion in ''[[R v Morgentaler]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1998] 1 SCR 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Finding laws against abortion to be a breach of the rights to [[liberty]] and [[security of the person]] under [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 7 of the ''Charter'']], Wilson then argued this infringement could not be justified as being consistent with [[fundamental justice]]. The legal protections found under fundamental justice could be defined as including other rights under the ''Charter'', and in particular abortion laws breached freedom of conscience. As she wrote, the "decision whether or not to terminate a pregnancy is essentially a moral decision, a matter of conscience". She then said, "[C]onscientious beliefs which are not religiously motivated are equally protected by freedom of conscience in s. 2(a)." No other judges joined Wilson's opinion.

[[Jean Chrétien]], who was the [[Attorney General of Canada|attorney general]] during negotiations of the ''Charter'', later recalled in his memoirs that freedom of conscience was nearly excluded from the ''Charter''. The federal and provincial negotiators found the right too difficult to define, and Chrétien eventually agreed to remove it. A legal advisor for the federal government, Pierre Genest, then kicked Chrétien's chair, prompting Chrétien to joke, "I guess we leave it in. [[Pierre Trudeau|Trudeau's]] spy just kicked me in the ass."&lt;ref&gt;Chrétien, Jean. ''Straight from the Heart''. (Key Porter Books Limited, 1994), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of expression==
{{see|History of free speech in Canada}}
Freedom of expression, section 2(b), is perhaps one of the most significant ''Charter'' rights in influencing Canadian society.  The right is expressly named in the charter because although "Canadian criminal law uses the standard of the [[reasonable person]] as a&amp;nbsp;... definition for the threshold of criminality", the ''Charter'' expressly limits some forms of expression.&lt;ref&gt;Mikus, Rudolf Alexander. (1995). The reasonable person in substantive Canadian Criminal Law (T). Retrieved from https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/831/items/1.0077473&lt;/ref&gt;  Justice [[Peter Cory]] wrote that it "is difficult to imagine a guaranteed right more important to a democratic society".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Edmonton Journal v Alberta (AG)]]'', [1989] 2 SCR 1326 at 1336.&lt;/ref&gt;  The section has been at the centre of a great amount of case law.

===Background===
Freedom of speech had a limited background in Canada. It has been an issue in federalism disputes, as provincial legislation infringing upon free speech has been taken as criminal legislation, which only the [[Parliament of Canada]] can validly create under section 91(27) of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]''.  ''[[Switzman v Elbling]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1957] SCR 285.&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of a case in which this was discussed. An Implied Bill of Rights theory further stated governments were limited in their abilities to infringe upon free speech by virtue of the [[preamble]] of the ''Constitution Act, 1867''. This preamble states Canada's constitution would be based upon Britain's, and Britain had limited free speech in 1867.  Furthermore, free speech is considered to be necessary for a parliamentary government to function.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W. ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003), p. 686.&lt;/ref&gt;

Free speech was later included in the ''Canadian Bill of Rights''.

===Definition===
The meaning of "expression" within section 2(b) has been read broadly as including any activity that conveys, or attempts to convey, meaning&lt;ref&gt;''[[Irwin Toy Ltd v Quebec (AG)]]'', [1989] 1 SCR 927 [''Irwin Toy''].&lt;/ref&gt; to the exception of acts of violence and threats of violence.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Ibid'' and ''[[United Food and Commercial Workers, Local 1518 v KMart Canada Ltd]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Courts have tried to maintain content neutrality by not considering the value of the expression. Instead, the content is only examined during the section 1 analysis.

Freedom of expression is primarily seen as a [[negative and positive rights|negative right]]. In ''[[Native Women's Assn of Canada v Canada|Native Women's Association of Canada v Canada]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1994] 3 SCR 627.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court considered a claim that the government had to financially support an interest group in constitutional negotiations, as it had supported others. [[Section Twenty-eight of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 28]] (sexual equality under the ''Charter'') was used to reinforce this argument, since the rights claimants were an interest group. Still, while the Supreme Court agreed discussions with the government is "unquestionably" a form of expression, the government did not seem to be guilty of suppressing any expression and thus the claim was dismissed.

===Limiting the right===
A law will be found to violate the freedom of expression where the law either has the purpose or effect of violating the right.

A law's purpose can limit the right either through limiting the content or form of expression. Limits on content are where the meaning of the expression is specifically forbidden by the law, such as hate-speech law, and is the most easily identifiable form of limitation.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. ''[[Prostitution Reference|Reference Re ss 193 &amp; 195.1(1)(c) of Criminal Code (Canada)]]'', [1990] 1 SCR 1123 [''Prostitution Reference'']; ''[[R v Keegstra]]'', [1990] 3 SCR 697; and ''[[R v Butler]]'', [1992] 1 SCR 452.&lt;/ref&gt; Limiting the form of the expression can often invoke section 2(b) as it will often have the effect of limiting the content as well.&lt;ref&gt;For example, instead of banning [[rock music]] (the content), banning [[FM radio]] (the method of conveying the music).&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a law does not intend to limit the freedom of expression it may still infringe section 2(b) through its effects.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ramsden v Peterborough (City of)]]'', [1993] 2 SCR 1084.&lt;/ref&gt; A law will be found to restrict expression if it has the effect of frustrating "the pursuit of [[truth]], participation in the community, or individual self-fulfillment and human flourishing".

===Commercial expression===
Commercial expression is recognized as an activity protected under section 2(b). This includes advertising and any other similar means of expression used to sell goods and services. In fact, even false or misleading advertising is protected. The value of the expression does not come into play until the section 1 analysis.

The protection of commercial expression was first established in ''[[Ford v Quebec (AG)]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1988] 2 SCR 712.&lt;/ref&gt; where the Court struck down a Quebec law requiring all signs to be exclusively in French. This was soon followed by ''Irwin Toy'',&lt;ref&gt;''Supra''.&lt;/ref&gt; where the Court found that Quebec law prohibiting advertising to children to violate section 2(b) but was saved under section 1.

The Supreme Court has also found that restrictions on advertising by professionals to be protected.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rocket v Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario]]'', [1990] 2 SCR 232.&lt;/ref&gt; As well, even communications for the purpose of prostitution was found to be protected as commercial expression.&lt;ref&gt;''Prostitution Reference'', ''supra''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Picketing===
Protesting by labour groups and trade unions have long been recognized as a protected form of expression.

There are not many instances of limiting primary picketing. Typically, the debate has been over whether [[secondary picketing]] can be restricted; the practice of picketing businesses not directly involved in a labour dispute has in the past been banned under the common law. The most significant decision on limiting primary picketing is ''[[British Columbia Government Employees' Union v British Columbia (AG)]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1988] 2 SCR 214.&lt;/ref&gt; where employees at the [[British Columbia Supreme Court]], who were protesting as part of a province-wide public service employee strike, were ordered back to work by the Chief Justice of the court. The order was found to clearly violate section 2(b) but the Supreme Court upheld it on section 1.

===Freedom of thought, belief and opinion===
Section 2(b) guarantees freedom of thought, belief and opinion in addition to freedom of expression. However, some have argued that freedoms of thought, belief and opinion in the ''Charter'' have had little practical consequence, and question whether governments have the capacity to stifle unspoken thoughts in any case.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W. Constitutional Law of Canada. 2003 Student Ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003), p. 917.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application in the civil context===
The need to protect freedom of expression is considered a guiding principle of interpretation in civil cases between individuals. In '' Crookes v. Newton'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chartercases.com/crookes-v-newton-2011-scc-47/]&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the Supreme Court of Canada found that section 2(b) must be considered in determining the extent to which common law libel restrictions should apply to new technologies such as internet hyperlinks.

==Freedom of peaceful assembly==
[[File:Occupy Montreal - Global Day of Action - 2011-10-15 - Victoria Square - General assembly.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Occupy Canada]] stages a peaceful assembly in Victoria Square in Montreal.]] 
Freedom of peaceful assembly under section 2(c) has not had a major impact on the case law.  In ''[[Reference Re Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alta)]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1987] 1 SCR 313 [''Alberta Reference''].&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court found that despite being written as a separate right, it was closely related to freedom of expression. The [[Nova Scotia Supreme Court]] defined it in ''Fraser et al v AGNS et al'' (1986) as including rights to meet as part of a committee or as workers. If there are membership fees to attend a meeting, prohibitions on being able to spend money for membership would be an abridgement of the right to peaceful assembly. In 2011, [[Occupy Canada]]'s protests in public parks raised questions of whether their eviction was prohibited by freedom of assembly, as well as expression and association.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Gollom, "[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2011/11/17/occupy-protest-rights.html Will charter protect Occupy protesters from eviction?]", CBC News, 18 November 2011, URL accessed 18 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of association==
Freedom of association is guaranteed under section 2(d). This right provides individuals the right to establish, belong to and maintain to any sort of organization, unless that organization is otherwise illegal. Generally, this is used in the [[Labour movement|labour]] context where employees are given the right to associate with certain [[trade union|unions]] or other similar group to represent their interests in labour disputes or negotiations.

It is important to note that this right only protects the right of individuals to form associations and not associations themselves.&lt;ref&gt;''Alberta Reference'', ''supra''.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, government legislation affecting the powers of established labour associations do not necessarily invoke section 2(d). It is only where legislation restricts the associative nature of an activity will section 2 be invoked. However, in the landmark ''Health Services and Support – Facilities Subsector Bargaining Association v British Columbia'',&lt;ref&gt;2007 SCC 27 [''Health Services''].&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court ruled that freedom of association guaranteed by section 2(d) includes a procedural right to collective bargaining. The Court ruled in this case that legislation that "substantially interferes" with the process of collective bargaining is a section 2(d) infringement. The test for "substantial interference" is twofold: (1) the importance of the matter affected to the process of collective bargaining, and more specifically, the capacity of union members to come together and pursue collective goals in concert; and (2) the manner in which the measure impacts on the collective right to good faith negotiation and consultation.&lt;ref&gt;''Health Services'', ''supra'' at 394.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not certain whether the decision in ''Health Services'' overturns jurisprudence arising from the so-called "labour trilogy" cases of 1987 which found that section 2(d) did not include a right to collective bargaining.&lt;ref&gt;''Health Services'', ''supra'' at 413.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court has since found in ''Ontario (AG) v Fraser'',&lt;ref&gt;2011 SCC 20 [''Fraser''].&lt;/ref&gt; that the right to collective bargaining does not require government to take an active role in promoting and fostering collective bargaining, but merely to refrain from excessive interference with the collective bargaining process. In effect, the right to collective bargaining "guarantees a process, not a result". ''Fraser'' was affirmed and expanded upon by the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] in 2012 in ''Association of Justice Counsel v Canada (AG)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Association of Justice Counsel v. Canada (Attorney General)|link=Association of Justice Counsel v. Canada (Attorney General)|year=2012|court=onca|num=530|format=onca|courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, where a union is denied a right it does not preclude the employees from forming a separate association. In ''[[Delisle v Canada (Deputy AG)]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1999] 2 SCR 989.&lt;/ref&gt; members of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] were excluded from the public services legislation. The Supreme Court held that they were not precluded from forming their own association outside of the impugned legislation. However, in contrast the decision of ''[[Dunmore v Ontario (AG)]]''&lt;ref&gt;2001 SCC 94.&lt;/ref&gt; indicated that agricultural workers who were excluded from provincial labour relations legislation were entitled to be included because individually they were unable to form their own associations, and consequently, this imposed a duty upon the government to include them.

The freedom of association also includes the freedom not to associate.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lavigne v Ontario Public Service Employees Union]]'', [1991] 2 SCR 211 [''Lavigne''].&lt;/ref&gt; In certain employment circumstances, employees are required to contribute to a union as conditions of their employment (see [[Rand formula]]). However, mandatory associations do not invoke section 2(d) in and of themselves. In ''Lavigne'', the Court found that the right not to be associated extended only to where the association supported causes that went beyond what is necessary for employee representation. More generally, the Supreme Court had stated that the right is violated only when the mandatory association imposes "ideological conformity".&lt;ref&gt;''R v Advance Cutting &amp; Coring Ltd'', 2001 SCC 70 [''Advance Cutting &amp; Coring''].&lt;/ref&gt; Such violations have also mostly been found by the Supreme Court to be justified under [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 1]], resulting in a right not to associate that has more theoretical than practical effects.

In ''Advance Cutting &amp; Coring'',&lt;ref&gt;''Supra''.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court was called to examine the constitutional validity of a Quebec law that required all persons working in the province's construction industry to join a designated union. Eight of nine judges (Justice [[Claire L'Heureux-Dubé]] dissenting) confirmed that section 2 includes, to at least some degree, the negative right to ''not'' associate. With a majority of five judges to four, the Court determined that the law at issue violated this right. But with the same majority (judge [[Frank Iacobucci]] "switching camps" on the two issues and citing a "unique and complex historical context" in Quebec), the Court deemed the law to be ''justified in a free and democratic society'' under section 1 and thus constitutional.

'''Self-monitoring''' is a concept introduced during the 1970s by [[Mark Snyder (psychologist)|Mark Snyder]], that shows how much people monitor their self-presentations, expressive behavior, and nonverbal [[affective display]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Day and  Schleicher, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Human beings generally differ in substantial ways in their abilities and desires to engage in expressive controls (see [[Dramaturgy (sociology)|dramaturgy]]).&lt;ref name="Snyder, 1974"&gt;Snyder, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined as a [[personality trait]] that refers to an ability to regulate behavior to accommodate social situations. People concerned with their expressive self-presentation (see [[impression management]]) tend to closely monitor their audience in order to ensure appropriate or desired public appearances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Self-monitors try to understand how individuals and groups will perceive their actions. Some [[personality type]]s commonly act spontaneously (low self-monitors) and others are more apt to purposely control and consciously adjust their behavior (high self-monitors).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Recent studies suggest that a distinction should be made between acquisitive and protective self-monitoring due to their different interactions with metatraits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilmot|first=Michael P.|last2=DeYoung|first2=Colin G.|last3=Stillwell|first3=David|last4=Kosinski|first4=Michal|date=2016-06-01|title=Self-Monitoring and the Metatraits|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.12162/abstract|journal=Journal of Personality|language=en|volume=84|issue=3|pages=335–347|doi=10.1111/jopy.12162|issn=1467-6494}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differentiates the motive behind self-monitoring behaviours: for the purpose of acquiring appraisal from others (acquisitive) or protecting oneself from social disapproval (protective).

==Historical context==
===Major case studies===
There are many cases in which self-monitoring is used a variable of interest. Many recent studies look into the relationship with on-task behavior, work-place utilization, and leadership positions.

A pilot study regarding on-task behavior was done with two high school students with symptoms of learning disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Wills. (2014). Implementation of a self-monitoring application to improve on-task behavior: A high school pilot study.&lt;/ref&gt; These students were trained using a self-monitoring application and given prompts and the results showed positive, stable improvements in their on-task behavior after each individual's self-monitoring was increased.

When looking at theoretical and empirical evidence in self-monitoring in the work-place, research indicates that high self-monitors are proficient in meeting the social expectations and increasing their leadership outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Day, Schleicher. (2006). Self-Monitoring at Work: A Motive-Based Perspective.&lt;/ref&gt; Results from the study done by Day and Schleicher emphasize that the higher the individual scores on the scale, the more successful the individual tends to be as determined from the criteria of getting along, getting ahead, and making sense.

The relationship between self-monitoring and career mobility in particular was studied with a research pool of Masters of Business Administration graduates.&lt;ref&gt;Day, Kilduff. (1994). Do Chameleons Get Ahead? The Effects of Self-Monitoring on Managerial Careers.&lt;/ref&gt; High self-monitors are reported to be more likely to change employers, change work locations, and achieve promotions in comparison to low self-monitors.

===Controversy and confusion===
Self-monitoring, despite all the research and theory behind it, has been shrouded with controversy and confusion with respect to its actual existence.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, M. &amp; Gangestad, S. (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The initial confusion arose because factor analyses were conducted which revealed that the structure of most items of the Self-Monitoring Scale was multifactorial. Three factors appeared necessary to account for the correlations between the items for the measure, interpreted as Acting (e.g. "I would probably make a good actor"), Extraversion (e.g. "In a group of people, I am rarely the center of attention"), and Other-Directedness (e.g. "I guess I put on a show to entertain or impress other people") (Snyder, M. &amp; Gangestad, S. (2000)). Though these factor analyses are used as instruments to measure the level of self monitoring, they have prompted the question of the existence of self-monitoring. Mark Snyder and Steven W. Gangestad, (2000) argued through a series of quantitative experiments that it is indeed a real unitary phenomenon by showing that external criterion measures representing a wide array of phenomena relating to expressive control all point to self-monitoring as a real causal phenomena.

Additionally, they argue that the external criterion variables are generally most directly tapped by the Self-Monitoring Scale rather than being tapped by the measures of Extraversion, Social [[Surgency]], or Other-Directedness, meaning that Self-Monitoring can better describe the factors that contribute to a person's personality than the combination of these. Measures of these three factors relate to the self-monitoring criterion only with respect to the fact that they have similar variance with the self-monitoring dimension, with Other-Directedness being the most highly related to Self-Monitoring. Hence, through answering these two questions, doubts regarding the existence of the Self-Monitoring phenomena were clearly dispelled.

==Scale==
Snyder's self monitoring scale was developed in 1974. It measures whether or not an individual has the will and ability to change how they are perceived by utilizing impression management in various social interactions. The score is based on twenty five questions that the individual answers according to their thought process and is used to determine how an individual may manipulate nonverbal signals and adjusts theirs actions according to a situation. The score is calculated based on how the individuals responds to True and False questions.

===Low self monitors===
Low self-monitors tend to exhibit expressive controls congruent with their own internal states; i.e. [[beliefs]], [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], and [[dispositions]] regardless of social circumstance. Low self-monitors are often less observant of social context and consider expressing a self-presentation dissimilar from their internal states as a falsehood and undesirable.&lt;ref name="sandg02"&gt;Snyder &amp; Gangestad, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; People who are unwilling to self-monitor and adjust their behavior accordingly are often aggressive, uncompromising, and insistent with others. This may make them more prone to condemnation, rejection, and the possible consequent feelings of anger, anxiety, guilt, low self-concept, isolation, and depression. Even the occasional indiscretion can make social situations awkward, and could result in the loss of a friend, co-worker, client, or even job. Those who are willing to adjust their behavior will often find that others are more receptive, pleasant, and benevolent towards them.

===High self monitors===
Individuals who closely monitor themselves are categorized as high self-monitors. They often behave in a manner that is highly responsive to social cues and their situational context. High self-monitors can be thought of as social pragmatists who project images in an attempt to impress others and receive positive feedback. In comparison to low self-monitors, high self monitors participate in more expressive control and have concern for situational appropriateness. As these individuals are willing to adjust their behavior, others may perceive them to be more receptive, pleasant, and benevolent towards them.

===Low vs high self monitors===
A low score on the self-monitoring scale can range anywhere from 0-8 and a high score ranges from 15-22.&lt;ref name="Snyder, 1974"&gt;Snyder, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Some traits of high self-monitors include readily and easily modifying their behavior in response to the demands of the situation, whereas low self-monitors care little about modifying their behavior in response to the situation and tend to maintain the same opinions and attitudes regardless of the situation.&lt;ref name="Sanderson, C. A. 2010"&gt;Sanderson, C. A. (2010). Social psychology. Hoboken, N.J.: Wiley ;.&lt;/ref&gt;  High self-monitors find it much easier to modify their behavior based on the situation than low self-monitors do. High self-monitors would be more likely to change their beliefs and opinions depending on who they are talking to, while low self-monitors would tend to be consistent throughout all situations. This has been studied mainly in correspondence with relationships. Compared to low self-monitors, high self-monitors will have more dating and sexual partners, are more interested in having sex with people they are not in love with, and are more likely to have had sex with someone only once, as well as be more likely to deceive potential romantic partners.&lt;ref name="Sanderson, C. A. 2010"/&gt; High self-monitors are more likely to choose a romantic partner who is attractive but unsociable, while low self-monitors are more likely to choose a partner who is unattractive but sociable.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Berscheid &amp; Glick, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; High self-monitors are also more likely to take on leadership positions than low self-monitors.&lt;ref&gt;Eby, Cader &amp; Noble, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in individuals' propensity for self-monitoring have a heritable component,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Public Appearances, Private Realities: The Psychology of Self-Monitoring|last=Snyder|first=Mark|publisher=W. H. Freeman.|year=1987|isbn=978-0716717973|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the likelihood that  a person becomes a high (or low) self-monitor also varies between social contexts and groups.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knight|first=Carly R.|last2=Tilcsik|first2=András|last3=Anteby|first3=Michel|date=2016-01-29|title=The Geography of Stigma Management|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/2378023115625172|journal=Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World|language=en|volume=2|doi=10.1177/2378023115625172}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, on average, sexual minorities (such as gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals) are more likely to be high self-monitors than their otherwise similar heterosexual counterparts, but this difference exists primarily in geographic areas where the stigma against minority sexual orientations is strong. In the United States, for example, differences in self-monitoring based on sexual orientation have been documented in rural areas and small towns but do not seem to exist in the context of large cities, which tend to be more tolerant of minority sexual orientations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Individualistic differences==
{{close paraphrasing|section|source=https://ici.umn.edu/products/impact/182/182.pdf|talk=Individualistic differences|date=December 2017}}
Self-monitoring is useful for students from preschool to adulthood and can be taught to individuals at a variety of levels of cognitive functioning. Self-monitoring interventions foster independent functioning, which allows individuals with disabilities to rely less on prompts from others.&lt;ref&gt;(Koegel, Koegel, Harrower, and Carter, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Self-monitoring interventions are among the most flexible, useful, and effective strategies for students with academic and behavioral difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;(Mitchum, Young, West, &amp; Benyo, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; They have demonstrated efficacy for targeting a range of academic abilities,&lt;ref&gt;(Rock, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; self-help skills,&lt;ref&gt;(Pierce and Schreibman, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; behavioral problems,&lt;ref&gt;(Todd, Horner, and Sugai, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and social behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;(Strain &amp; Kohler, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Students with behavioral and academic difficulties typically have limited awareness and understanding of their own behavior and its effects on others. Self-monitoring interventions equip students to recognize and keep track of their own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;(Hoff and DuPaul, 1998; Rhode, Morgan, and Young, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; Using these strategies, students can learn to identify and increase positive, pro-social behaviors, the behaviors necessary for success in general education settings. Self-monitoring strategies are individualized plans used to increase independent functioning in academic, behavioral, self-help, and social areas. Rather than focusing on reducing a student’s undesired behavior, self-monitoring strategies develop skills that lead to an increase in appropriate behavior. When self-monitoring skills increase, corresponding reductions in undesired behaviors often occur, even without direct intervention.&lt;ref&gt;(Dunlap, Clarke, Jackson, Wright, 1995; Koegel, Koegel, Harrower, and Carter, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; This collateral behavior change allows teachers and parents to address multiple behaviors with one efficient intervention.
The five steps involved in planning a self-monitoring intervention:
# Identify the target behavior.
# Select/design a self-monitoring system.
# Choose reinforcers and how the student will earn them.
# Teach the student to use the system.
# Fade the role of the adult in the intervention.

===Social approach===
It's been argued that [[individualism]] should influence self-monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;Gudykunst et al., (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Cultures high on individualism focus on the self, not others. In [[individualistic culture]]s, knowing the context is not necessary to predict others' behavior, thus people from individualistic cultures are more likely to be low self-monitors. Cultures low on individualism (i.e., [[collectivism|collectivist culture]]s), in contrast, value [[conformity]] to [[Ingroups and outgroups|ingroups]] and group memberships. In collectivistic cultures, knowing the context and social status of the other person is essential to predicting his or her behavior. Thus, people from collectivistic cultures are more likely to be high self-monitors.&lt;ref&gt;Gudykunst, W. B., Gao, G., Nishida, T., Bond, M. H., Leung, K., Wang, G., et al. (1989). A Cross-cultural Comparison Of Self-monitoring. Communication Research Reports, 6(1), 7-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Job performance====
It has been shown that there is a significant relation between an individual's performance at his job and his or her ability to change their self-presentation in order to most adapt to the situation. Self-monitoring was most important during early tenure.&lt;ref name="Caldwell 1981"&gt;Caldwell (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; This history of finding individual difference variables that relate to [[job performance]] has been unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Bem &amp; Allen (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the reasons why it is difficult to use individual difference variables to predict job performance is because there is failure to consider contextual effects such as informational influence and pressures for conformity. Other difficulties are a result from attempting to use personality measures without having a good understanding of the nature of the job and the individual's development in the job. This results in the individual differences being assessed without fully understanding why they should affect job performance directly or how they may affect an individual's performance when you take into consideration increased job knowledge that an individual may gain through experience.&lt;ref&gt;Salancik and Pfeffer (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

One case that shows how success could be related to individual predispositions is in organizations where individuals hold boundary-spanning positions. Boundary spanners purpose is to filter and transfer information across organizational boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich and Herker, 1977, Tushman, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; The individuals that are responsible for this transfer of information may be in a roles both inside and outside the organization. Therefore, they should be able to respond to social and informational stimuli, inside and outside the organization. The nature of this job makes it likely that an individual's performance in this role is likely to be influenced the degree to which that person can perceive, understand and adapt to different social situations as appropriate. In essence, an individual who is a high self-monitor would be better at responding to different social cues and hence be more equipped to transfer information effectively across organizational borders and consequently a higher performer.&lt;ref name="Caldwell 1981"/&gt;

Over time, however, the competitive advantage that high self monitors have over low self monitors reduced as job knowledge increases through experience and poor performers leave boundary spanning roles.&lt;ref name="Snyder, 1974"/&gt;

====Social impacts====
Riggio et al., (1982) suggests that the self-monitoring as monitored by the self-monitoring scale is a multidimensional construct and is composed of many elements central to social interaction. It was determined that the elements of self-monitoring appear to be "charisma", "performance", and "social sensitivity". Therefore, it is determinable that those with high levels of self-monitoring had greater skill at navigating and bridging social situations while in contrast, those with lower levels of self-monitoring may struggle in the same situations.&lt;ref&gt;Riggio and Friedman 1982. The Interrelationships of Self-Monitoring Factors, Personality Traits, and Nonverbal Social Skills&lt;/ref&gt;

The differences between how high self monitors and low self monitors treat relationships and social situations stem from the differences in what they seek to gain out of their social life and their understanding of self. High self-monitors view their self as a product of social interactions and their own adaptability in various social settings. In contrast, low self-monitors view their self as a product of personal dispositions and their effects on social situations. High self-monitors look for friends with similar activity preferences, while low self-monitors look for friends with similar attitudes. High self-monitors also generally end up becoming close to other high self-monitors, and vice versa with low self-monitors.&lt;ref name="Leone 2006"&gt;Leone &amp; Hawkins (2006). Self-Monitoring and Close Relationships&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relationships====
High self-monitors look for a social context that allows flexibility and adaptability to play a multitude of roles without role conflict. High self-monitors are more likely to believe in the idea that there are multiple people one can love, and focus on attributes such as physical attractiveness,&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Buchanan, 2000; Glick, 1985, Jones, 1993; Snyder, Berscheid, &amp; Glick, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; sex appeal,&lt;ref&gt;(Jones, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; social status, and financial resources.&lt;ref name="Jones, 1993"&gt;Jones, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, the attachments high self-monitors form with their significant others are more avoidant, and they can feel uncomfortable with significant others that have higher levels of intimacy than themselves. Low self-monitors on the other hand look for a social context that gives them the freedom and security to express their emotions and dispositions freely without any interpersonal conflicts. They are more likely to believe in the idea of “one true love”, and look for attributes such as personality desirability,&lt;ref&gt;(e.g., Buchanan, 2000; Glick, 1985; Snyder et al., 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; similarity of values and beliefs, and other dispositions like honesty, responsibility, and kindness.&lt;ref name="Jones, 1993"/&gt; This leads to more secure relationships being formed, and level of intimacy is not a problem.&lt;ref&gt;(Gaines et al., 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leone 2006"/&gt;

==Similar processes==
===Self presentation===
There is a strong connection between self-monitoring and [[self-presentation]], as it's proven that people who are high self-monitoring have greater cognitive access to self-presentation related concepts than people who are low self-monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler, Kearns, McIntyre, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  Through a 100-person experiment, it was found out that high-self monitors more quickly linked positive personality traits to themselves following exposure to impression-related words, proving  high self-monitors possess a heightened capacity to cognitively process self-presentation information. High self-monitors rely on social information to guide their self-presentations since they vary their presentations based on different social cues. They are also, compared to low self-monitors, more likely to recall personal information about an upcoming interaction partner, are better able to judge emotional displays, are more skilled at decoding nonverbal behaviors, show better performance on interpersonal perception tasks, are more focused on their interaction partners, and they seek out and consider more information about an audience when trying to convey a particular identity.

Essentially, Tyler, Kearns and McIntyres argue that high self-monitoring people are more likely to seek out social cues and information through interactions, following which they will employ this information in their behaviour, hence portraying a self presentation or image that they want to. Additionally, they are more sensitive to social cues and social information.  People low in self-monitoring, however, would behave as themselves in most cases and hence not have an option in the self-presentation that they project, as well as being less sensitive to social information present around them.

===Social psychology theory===
There are several theories within [[social psychology]] that are closely related to the self-monitoring construct. [[Icek Ajzen]] argues that subjective norms are an important antecedent to determining behavioral intention in the [[theory of reasoned action]]/[[theory of planned behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;Ajzen, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; High self-monitors tend to weigh subjective norms more heavily than low self-monitors. Studies that evaluate private attitudes and public actions include Ajzen, Timko and White, 1982; and DeBono and Omoto, 1993. Informational cascades theory is related to observation learning theory which was developed by Bikhchandani, S.; Hirshleifer, D. and Welch, I. (1992) and describes how people will follow, sometimes blindly, the actions of others. The self-monitoring construct would identify that high self-monitors may be more susceptible to [[informational cascades]] and [[herd mentality]]. This can be a problem if a culture of [[groupthink]] is part of the organizations decision making process. High self-monitors are more motivated to attain high social status than low self-monitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=P.|author2=Kim, J. |title=Self-Monitoring, Opinion Leadership and Opinion Seeking: a Sociomotivational Approach |journal=Current Psychology|year=2011|volume=30|pages=203–214|doi=10.1007/s12144-011-9114-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research drawing on the [[elaboration likelihood model]] suggests that high self-monitors, more than low self-monitors, react favorably to peripheral processing of advertising images consistent with high social status.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder and DeBono, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DeBono and Packer, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shavitt, Lowrey, and Han, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15241">A '''stalking horse''' is a figure that tests a concept with someone or mounts a challenge against someone on behalf of an anonymous third party. If the idea proves viable or popular, the anonymous figure can then declare its interest and advance the concept with little risk of failure. If the concept fails, the anonymous party will not be tainted by association with the failed concept and can either drop the idea completely or bide its time and wait until a better moment for launching an attack.

In hunting, it refers to a horse, or a figure of a horse, behind which a hunter hides when stalking game.

==Origin==
[[File:RO(1875) P215 APPROACHING THE FOWL WITH STALKING-HORSE.jpg|thumb|"Approaching the fowl with stalking-horse", an 1875 illustration of a cut-out horse shape used in hunting]]
The term ''stalking horse'' originally derived from the practice of [[hunting]],&lt;ref name="finn"/&gt; particularly of [[wildfowl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=s&amp;p=39 |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunters noticed that many birds would flee immediately on the approach of humans, but would tolerate the close presence of animals such as [[horse]]s and [[cattle]].

Hunters would therefore slowly approach their quarry by walking alongside their horses, keeping their upper bodies out of sight until the flock was within firing range. Animals trained for this purpose were called ''stalking horses''. Sometimes mobile [[Bird hide|hides]] are used for a similar purpose.

An example of the practice figures in the 1972 film ''[[Jeremiah Johnson (film)|Jeremiah Johnson]]'', when Johnson and Chris Lapp ("Bear Claw") are hunting elk in the Rockies:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;''Jeremiah'': Wind's right, but he'll just run soon as we step out of these trees.
''Bear Claw'': Trick to it. Walk out on this side of your horse.
''Jeremiah'': What if he sees our feet?
''Bear Claw'': Elk don't know how many feet a horse has!&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068762/quotes Jeremiah Johnson (1972) - Memorable quotes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Usage==

The term began appearing in Anglophone newspapers in the late 18th century. It was used to describe the Protestant branch of Christianity as "a stalking horse to power" in Ireland in 1785.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/61258150/?terms=%22stalking+horse%22|title=8 Apr 1785, Page 4 - The Belfast Mercury or Freeman's Chronicle at Newspapers.com|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples of its use in a political context occurred in the London newspaper ''[[The Observer]]'' in 1796,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/257659589/?terms=%22stalking+horse%22|title=18 Dec 1796, 3 - The Observer at Newspapers.com|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Connecticut Courant]]'' in the USA in 1808&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/233739670/?terms=%22stalking+horse%22|title=24 Feb 1808, Page 1 - Hartford Courant at Newspapers.com|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald|Sydney Morning Herald]]'' in Australia in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2181339|title=To the Editor of the Sydney Gazette.|date=1822-09-27|work=Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser (NSW : 1803 - 1842)|access-date=2017-12-03|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression is generally used in [[politics]] and business. In politics, the circumstances may include an attempt to bring down a powerful leader, usually by members of their own [[Political party|party]]. They may also include the presentation of a bill by a minor party representative, who is also acting in the interests of a silent partner such as a larger, more risk averse, political party. In business, the circumstances are an attempt at [[testing the market]] for a potential (hostile) [[takeover]] of a [[business]]. In each case, there is the clear understanding that the anonymous party, whether a company or an individual, has a valuable reputation that could be damaged by the failure. The stalking horse is an exercise in assessing accurately the degree of risk, so that a full-blooded challenge is only mounted by the main party when there is a real likelihood of success.

The loser in the exercise appears to be the stalking horse. If the idea is viable or popular, the stalking horse person will be sidelined and the anonymous figure will take over the concept themselves. If the concept proves unpopular, the stalking horse will suffer any negative reaction. The understanding is that the anonymous party is a major player, perhaps only a little weaker than the target itself, and the stalking horse is a minor figure who has little or no reputation to lose. The anonymous figure is not sufficiently powerful, or does not have sufficient confidence in that power, to risk a direct attack first off, and the stalking horse is a form of [[distraction tactic]] to enable better positioning.

In politics, the stalking horse figure can expect [[patronage]] from the senior figure they are assisting. In business, an associated company that acts as a stalking horse may be given a share in the contracts or the [[market share]] that will result from the demise of the business rival. The loyalty in volunteering, or agreeing to be "volunteered", will ensure that their name becomes known to those with power and should guarantee help in advancing their interests. As a weaker player, they can afford to wait a while for the due reward.

Alternatively, the "horse" may be acting in a more [[Altruism|altruistic]] and self-sacrificial manner, knowing that there is no possibility of realistic reward from the third party for the exercise, and instead being motivated by duty or loyalty to do so for the greater good of the party, organization, or cause to which they both belong. In this case, the "horse" will probably not be a young person hoping for advancement, but an older figure at the end of their career, who volunteers as a gesture of gratitude for all the benefits they believe the cause has given them, or as a [[Forlorn hope|chance to go out in a blaze of glory]].

In the event of failure, the anonymous party is seen as being sufficiently powerful to protect the "horse" from any real retribution on the part of the target, particularly since the anonymity will allow the third party to step in and pretend to be an [[honest broker]] between the "horse" and the target. This is a further opportunity to enhance the reputation of the third party and boost their status at the expense of the target. If the exercise is viable, the third party gains power immediately, but even if it fails it engineers an opportunity to resolve a [[Stalemate#Stalemate as a metaphor|stalemate]] and enhance the contender's reputation, so that ultimate success is another step nearer, to the benefit of both the third party and the "horse", who expects to [[slipstream]] in its wake.&lt;ref name="finn"&gt;{{cite web|last=Politi |first=Daniel |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2088794/ |title=What exactly is a "stalking horse"? - By Ed Finn - Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kathleen-reardon/is-north-korea-a-chinese-_b_24433.html |title=Kathleen Reardon: Is North Korea a Chinese Stalking-horse? - Politics on The Huffington Post |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2006-07-05 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.aol.com/political-machine/2007/10/03/a-symbolic/ |title=A Symbolic Stalking Horse - Political Machine |publisher=News.aol.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related concepts==
{{Original research section|date=December 2017}}
One related concept is the [[smoke screen]]. Like a stalking horse, smoke screens are used to screen and mask an attack. In the literal and genuine form, the smoke screen is still a device used in warfare (in defence as well as attack), but the term is also commonly used as a metaphor. A stalking horse would be a particular form of smoke screen.

Another concept is that of [[kite-flying (politics)|kite-flying]]. The stalking horse pretends to be interested in a concept themselves, but in reality they are testing an idea for another. Likewise, in journalism, the term "flying a kite" takes the metaphor of the child's toy to mean advancing a concept in which one has no personal belief, or for which one has no reliable evidence, as a similar exercise in "testing the waters". Another similar metaphor is that of a [[trial balloon]]. Different examples may provoke different responses. Some may be directed to play to the readers themselves. The idea is "to provoke a response where otherwise there would be none". Like the stalking horse, the means is to use a spurious debate to provoke a real one. The difference is that the concept is advanced, not an individual. In one form of "flying a kite", a journalist claims to be acting on a behalf of a real but anonymous person, while in reality they are acting for themselves; this would be the opposite of the stalking horse.  

Another concept is [[collusion]]. The difference here is that collusion usually refers to the situation of the first and third parties both declaring themselves openly to the target, but each pretends to be independent of anyone else and acting solely for themselves, whilst in reality they are acting in concert, in [[common purpose|joint enterprise]] and to mutual advantage, at the expense of the target. If one party acts aggressively and the other sympathetically towards the target, it may be an example of [[good cop/bad cop]]. In the stalking horse scenario, the first and third parties are still acting in concert and in joint enterprise and still at the expense of the target, but only the first party, the "horse", is openly dealing with the target. In addition, they are not acting to immediate mutual advantage; rather, they are acting to advantage only the third party (the anonymous party), who, at a later date, should in turn give reward to the first party (the "horse").       

Another related idiom is that of the puppet-master. One person (the "horse") dances like a puppet on the stage, but another (the anonymous figure) is the one who is actually pulling the strings, unseen by all. The stalking horse appears to be acting for and as themselves, but there are others in the shadows. The difference is that the [[éminence grise]] or puppet-master is definitely controlling the puppet, but the stalking horse may not always be acting on the orders of, or to the benefit of, a particular individual; they may instead be acting for a cause, in the hope that some individual will be inspired to enter the fray and take over. 

The concept of a "[[Pawn (chess)#Etymology and word usage|sacrificial pawn]]" is also in some ways similar to that of the stalking horse. In the game of chess, a pawn may be advanced in the knowledge that it will definitely be lost, but will, in so doing, force out an enemy piece of much higher value and make that piece much more susceptible to attack. This image is also in common usage as an metaphor. The difference with the stalking horse is that not only is the outcome not known at the outset but, furthermore, that it cannot reasonably be estimated without a proper [[reconnaissance]]. Therefore, unlike the pawn, the horse might have a good chance of survival. Either way, the "horse" will not benefit from the initial exercise.

==Examples==
===In politics===
The phenomenon occurs particularly in politics, where a junior politician acts as the stalking horse to promote the interests of a senior politician, who remains unseen in case the actions would damage him or her but nevertheless wants to provoke a debate or challenge to a party colleague. In some cases, stalking horses are not working for a particular individual but may wish to provoke a response that leads others to join in. In politics, the truth about the relationship between an individual stalking horse and a candidate may never be known, as both sides may claim that the (alleged) stalking horse acted without the agreement of anyone else.

For example, in Britain, the elderly and largely unknown [[Backbencher|back-bench]] politician [[Anthony Meyer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4160013.stm |title=Politics &amp;#124; Tory 'stalking horse' Meyer dies |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-01-09 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fandmpublications.co.uk/pages/incidents1.htm |title=Events and Incidents |publisher=Fandmpublications.co.uk |date=1984-03-05 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; challenged and helped to bring about the eventual resignation of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leadership.

In American politics, [[George W. Romney]] believed that [[Nelson Rockefeller]] had used him as a stalking horse in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1968|1968 Republican Party presidential primaries]] by promising support, then not providing it and hinting at his own entry into the campaign.&lt;ref name="lemann20121001"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/10/01/transaction-man | title=Transaction Man | work=The New Yorker | date=2012-10-01 | accessdate=2 October 2016 | author=Lemann, Nicholas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another suspected example: After the 2016 presidential election, [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] candidate [[Jill Stein]] demanded recounts in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania (all of which [[Donald Trump]] won in close contests), presumably for Hillary Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2017/04/25/the-biggest-story-of-trumps-first-100-days-his-survival/|title=The biggest story of Trump’s first 100 days?

===In bankruptcy===

In [[bankruptcy]], a [[Stalking horse offer|stalking horse bid]] is a first, favorable bid solicited by the bankrupt company's creditors strategically to prevent [[low-ball]] offers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stalkinghorsebid.asp |title=Stalking-Horse Bid |publisher=Investopedia.com |date=1993-04-02 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bowne.com/securitiesconnect/details.asp?storyID=1493 |title=Stalking Horse Bidders Try To Calm Creditors And Courts &amp;#124; Bowne Review |publisher=Bowne.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]], a '''stellation diagram''' or '''stellation pattern''' is a two-dimensional diagram in the plane of some face of a [[polyhedron]], showing lines where other face planes intersect with this one. The lines cause 2D space to be divided up into regions. Regions not intersected by any further lines are called elementary regions. Usually infinite regions are excluded from the diagram, along with any infinite portions of the lines. Each elementary region represents a top face of one [[Cell (geometry)|cell]], and a bottom face of another.

A collection of these diagrams, one for each face type, can be used to represent any [[stellation]] of the polyhedron, by shading the regions which should appear in that stellation.

A stellation diagram exists for every face of a given polyhedron. In [[face transitive]] polyhedra, symmetry can be used to require all faces have the same diagram shading. Semiregular polyhedra like the [[Archimedean solid]]s will have different stellation diagrams for different kinds of faces.

{{sociology}}
'''Traditional authority''' (also known as traditional domination) is a form of [[leadership]] in which the authority of an [[organization]] or a [[ruling regime]] is largely tied to [[tradition]] or custom. The main reason for the given state of affairs is that it 'has always been that way'.

==In sociology==
In [[sociology]], the concept of traditional authority (domination) comes from [[Max Weber]]'s [[tripartite classification of authority]], the other two forms being [[charismatic authority]] and [[rational-legal authority]]. All of those three domination types represent an example of his [[ideal type]] concept. Weber noted that in history those ideal types of domination are always found in combinations.

In traditional authority, the legitimacy of the authority comes from tradition; in charismatic authority from the personality and leadership qualities of the individual; and in rational-legal authority from powers that are [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratically]] and legally attached to certain positions.

===Patriarchs and their households===
Weber derives the traditional domination from [[patriarchy]]s and their households—in other words, from the ancient tradition of [[family]] (the authority of a master over his household). The master is designated in accordance with the rules of [[inheritance]]. He has no administrative staff nor any machinery to enforce his will by force alone; he depends on the willingness of the group members to respect his authority. Those members stand in personal relations to him. They obey him based on the belief that this is their duty sanctioned by immemorial tradition and on feeling of filial [[piety]] for the person of the master.

=== Patrimonialism ===

[[Patrimonialism|Patrimonial government]] occurs when the ruler's household expands with the  household administration giving rise to governmental offices. All officials are personal dependents or favourites of the ruler, appointed by him. Their interactions with the ruler are based on paternal authority and filial dependence. The officials treat their work as a personal service to the ruler. The ruler has complete control over the officials; he empowers them from case to case, assigns specific tasks, promotes and demotes. They have no rights, rather they have privileges granted and withdrawn by the ruler. It is rare to discover any clear and stable hierarchy and responsibility in the deluge of official titles of most patrimonial administrations.

[[Military]] force is an important instrument of a patrimonial rule. Weber distinguished five types of military organisations. In all of those cases the military is a tool of the ruler, solely for his use—but he is responsible for its upkeep (equipment, maintenance and wages).

With the growth of the territory organized and more independent administrative staff and military force became a necessity. This usually leads to [[decentralisation]], and some individuals gain more independence in the form of certain rights (for example, the right to inheritance and marriage without the consent of the rulers, to be judged by independent courts instead of officials of the royal household, etc.).

One of the best examples of almost [[pure type]] of patrimonialism is [[ancient Egypt]], where the population was entirely dependent upon the control of the waterways ([[Nile River]]). This facilitated the creation of [[centralised government]]. When the royal household required it, the individual had to perform the public duties, such as participate in labor-intensive project (rising of the [[pyramids]]). Thus the whole country was in fact the patriarchal household of the [[pharaoh]].

When land is given to military or officials for the performance of their duties, their independence increases and the power of the ruler weakens (consider the [[Mameluks]] and their rebellions, or the difference between Chinese [[Confucian]] [[Scholar-bureaucrats|literati]] who were never able to overthrow the power of the [[emperor]] and [[Europe]]an [[knights]] who evolved into powerful [[aristocracy]] in many cases vastly limiting the power of the [[monarch|kings]] (especially in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]])).

Patrimonial dominance has often prevailed in the [[Orient]], where land remained in the control of the ruler. However, in the [[Western world|Occident]] the ruler lost control of the lands given to the nobility, which according to Weber was a major reason for patrimonialism being replaced by feudalism.

===Feudalism===
[[Feudalism]] when compared to patrimonalism, has one major similarity and several important differences.

The similarity is that both are based on tradition and have powerful rulers who grant rights in return for military and administrative services.

The differences are important for the subtler distinction:
* feudalism replaces the paternal relationship of patrimonalism by a contract of allegiance based on knightly militarism.
* the patrimonial ruler's grants of authority and the personal dependence of official are replaced in feudalism by the contractual freedom, personal allegiance and socioeconomic prominence on the part of the vassals.

==Traditional leaders==
Most of the representatives of any [[dynasty]] ruling for more than one generation ([[monarch|kings]], [[emperor]]s, [[sultan]]s, etc.) would fall into that category. Thus majority [[monarchy|monarchies]] and some [[Autocracy|autocracies]], [[Oligarchy|oligarchies]], and [[Theocracy|theocracies]] would be ruled by traditional leaders.

Often male head of a common family should be considered a traditional leader. This could also be the case in a family-owned business, if its director and other leader positions are chosen based on family ties and/or age.

'''Traditional medicine''' (also known as '''indigenous''' or '''folk medicine''') comprises medical aspects of [[traditional knowledge]] that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern [[medicine]]. The [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]] defines traditional medicine as "the sum total of the knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness".&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/definitions/en/|title=Traditional Medicine: Definitions|date=2008-12-01|accessdate=2014-04-20|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[Asia]]n and [[Africa]]n countries, up to 80% of the population relies on traditional medicine for their [[primary health care]] needs.  When adopted outside its traditional culture, traditional medicine is often considered a form of [[alternative medicine]].&lt;ref name = WHO/&gt;  Practices known as traditional medicines include traditional European medicine, [[traditional Chinese medicine]], [[traditional Korean medicine]], [[traditional African medicine]], [[Ayurveda]], [[Siddha medicine]], [[Unani]], [[ancient Iranian Medicine]], [[Irani Traditional medicine|Iranian (Persian)]], [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Islamic medicine]], [[Muti]], and [[Ifá]]. Scientific disciplines which study traditional medicine include [[herbalism]], [[ethnomedicine]], [[ethnobotany]], and [[medical anthropology]].

The WHO notes, however, that "inappropriate use of traditional medicines or practices can have negative or dangerous effects" and that "further research is needed to ascertain the efficacy and safety" of several of the practices and medicinal plants used by traditional medicine systems.&lt;ref name = WHO/&gt; Ultimately, the World Health Organization has implemented a nine year strategy to "support Member States in developing proactive policies and implementing action plans that will strengthen the role traditional medicine plays in keeping populations healthy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/traditional/trm_strategy14_23/en/|title=WHO traditional medicine strategy: 2014-2023|last=|first=|date=December 2013|website=The World Health Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage and history==

=== Classical history ===
{{further|Medicine in ancient Greece|Medicine in ancient Rome}}
In the written record, the study of herbs dates back 5,000 years to the ancient [[Sumer]]ians, who described well-established medicinal uses for plants. In [[Ancient Egyptian medicine]], the [[Ebers papyrus]] from c. 1552 BC records a list of folk remedies and magical medical practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ebers' Papyrus|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/443.html|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Old Testament]] also mentions herb use and cultivation in regards to [[Kashrut]].

Early recognised Greek compilers of existing and current herbal knowledge include [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoras and his followers]], [[Hippocrates]], [[Aristotle]], [[Theophrastus]], [[Dioscorides]] and [[Galen]].

The [[Unani]] system of traditional medicine is also based on the ''Canon''.

Translations of the early Roman-Greek compilations were made into German by [[Hieronymus Bock]] whose herbal, published in 1546, was called ''Kreuter Buch''. The book was translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as ''Pemptades'' by [[Rembert Dodoens]] (1517&amp;ndash;1585), and from Dutch into [[English language|English]] by [[Carolus Clusius]], (1526&amp;ndash;1609), published by [[Henry Lyte (botanist)|Henry Lyte]] in 1578 as ''A Nievve Herball''. &lt;!--many other similar herbals, all based on Dioscorides, should be discussed here--&gt; This became [[John Gerard]]'s (1545&amp;ndash;1612) ''Herball or General Hiftorie of Plantes''.&lt;ref name = Kay1996/&gt;&lt;ref name = Blunt1994/&gt;  Each new work was a compilation of existing texts with new additions.

== Knowledge transmission and creation ==
Indigenous medicine is generally transmitted [[Oral tradition|orally]] through a community, family and individuals until "collected". Within a given culture, elements of indigenous medicine knowledge may be diffusely known by many, or may be gathered and applied by those in a specific role of healer such as a [[Shamanism|shaman]] or [[Midwifery|midwife]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Acharya|first=D|author2=Anshu S|year=2008|title=Indigenous Herbal Medicines: Tribal Formulations and Traditional Herbal Practices|publisher=Aavishkar Publishers|location=[[Jaipur]]|isbn=978-81-7910-252-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three factors legitimize the role of the healer &amp;ndash; their own beliefs, the success of their actions and the beliefs of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(00)91989-5.pdf|title=ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE: NIGERIA The role of traditional medicine|last=Maurice Mwu, Eric Gbodossou|first=|date=December 2000|website=The Lancet|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the claims of indigenous medicine become rejected by a culture, generally three types of adherents still use it &amp;ndash; those born and socialized in it who become permanent believers, temporary believers who turn to it in crisis times, and those who only believe in specific aspects, not in all of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Laguerre, Michel S.|title=Afro-Caribbean folk medicine|publisher=Bergin &amp; Garvey|location=New York|year=1987|pages=|isbn=0-89789-113-9|oclc=|doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2008}}

== Definition and terminology ==
Traditional medicine may sometimes be considered as distinct from folk medicine, and the considered to include formalized aspects of folk medicine. Under this definition folk medicine are longstanding remedies passed on and practised by lay people. Folk medicine consists of the [[healing]] practices and ideas of body [[physiology]] and [[health]] preservation known to some in a culture, transmitted informally as general knowledge, and practiced or applied by anyone in the culture having prior experience.&lt;ref&gt;Acharya, Deepak and Shrivastava Anshu (2008): Indigenous Herbal Medicines: Tribal Formulations and Traditional Herbal Practices, Aavishkar Publishers Distributor, Jaipur- India. {{ISBN|978-81-7910-252-7}}. pp 440.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Folk medicine ===

Many countries have practices described as folk medicine which may coexist with formalized, science-based, and institutionalized systems of medical practice represented by conventional [[medicine]].&lt;ref name="who2018"&gt;{{cite web|title=Traditional, complementary and integrative medicine|url=http://www.who.int/traditional-complementary-integrative-medicine/about/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=7 May 2018|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of folk medicine traditions are [[traditional Chinese medicine]], [[traditional Korean medicine]], [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Arabic indigenous medicine]], [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] traditional medicine, Japanese [[Kampō]] medicine, traditional Aboriginal [[bush medicine]], and [[Georgian folk medicine]], among others.&lt;ref name="who2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014-2023|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/92455/9789241506090_eng.pdf?sequence=1|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=7 May 2018|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home remedies===
{{More citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}
A '''home remedy''' (sometimes also referred to as a '''granny cure''') is a treatment to cure a [[disease]] or ailment that employs certain spices, vegetables, or other common items. Home remedies may or may not have [[medicinal properties]] that treat or cure the disease or ailment in question, as they are typically passed along by laypersons (which has been facilitated in recent years by the [[Internet]]). Many are merely used as a result of [[tradition]] or [[Habituation|habit]] or because they are effective in inducing the [[placebo effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/placebo-effect-a-cure-in-the-mind/|title=Placebo Effect: A Cure in the Mind|work=Scientific American|date=February–March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more popular examples of a home remedy is the use of [[chicken soup]] to treat [[Respiratory system|respiratory]] [[infection]]s such as a cold or mild [[flu]]. Other examples of home remedies include [[duct tape]] to help with setting broken bones; and duct tape or superglue to treat [[plantar wart]]s; and [[Kogel mogel]] to treat sore throat. In earlier times, mothers were entrusted with all but serious remedies. Historic [[cookbook]]s are frequently full of remedies for [[dyspepsia]], fevers, and female complaints.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catherine Beecher|Catherine Esther Beecher]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=FEQFN3bN7xEC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Recipes+date:0-1920&amp;num=30#PPA13,M1 Mrs. Beecher's Housekeeper and Healthkeeper] 1874.

In Chinese folk medicine, medicinal [[congee]]s (long-cooked rice soups with herbs), foods, and soups are part of treatment practices.&lt;ref&gt;''Prince Wen Hui's Cook'' Bob Flaws and Honora Wolf 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Safety concerns===
Although 130 countries have regulations on folk medicines, there are risks associated with the use of them. It is often assumed that because supposed medicines are herbal or natural that they are safe, but numerous precautions are associated with using herbal remedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js7916e/2.html|title=National Policy on Traditional Medicine and Regulation of Herbal Medicines - Report of a WHO Global Survey|publisher=World Health Organization|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of endangered species===
[[File:Slow_loris_-_dried_01.JPG|right|thumb|Sometimes traditional medicines include parts of endangered species, such as the [[slow loris]] in Southeast Asia.]]
Endangered animals, such as the [[slow loris]], are sometimes killed to make traditional medicines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Starr | first1 = C. | last2 = Nekaris | first2 = K. A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8046">A [[value theory|value]] is a '''universal value''' if it has the same value or worth for all, or almost all, people.  Spheres of human value encompass [[morality]], [[aesthetics|aesthetic preference]], [[Big Five personality traits|human traits]], [[Idea of Progress|human endeavour]], and [[social order]].  Whether universal values exist is an unproven conjecture of [[ethics|moral philosophy]] and [[cultural anthropology]], though it is clear that certain values are found across a great diversity of human cultures, such as primary attributes of [[physical attractiveness]] (e.g. youthfulness, symmetry) whereas other attributes (e.g. slenderness) are subject to [[aesthetic relativism]] as governed by [[norm (social)|cultural norms]].  This objection is not limited to aesthetics.  [[Relativism]] concerning morals is known as [[moral relativism]], a philosophical stance opposed to the existence of universal [[value (ethics)|moral values]]. 

The claim for universal values can be understood in two different ways. First, it could be that something has a universal value when everybody ''finds'' it valuable. This was [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s understanding of the term. According to Berlin, "...universal values....are values that a great many human beings in the vast majority of places and situations, at almost all times, do in fact hold in common, whether consciously and explicitly or as expressed in their behaviour..."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idJahanbegloo1991|Jahanbegloo 1991]], p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Second, something could have universal value when all people have ''reason'' to believe it has value. [[Amartya Sen]] interprets the term in this way, pointing out that when [[Mahatma Gandhi]] argued that non-violence is a universal value, he was arguing that all people have ''reason'' to value non-violence, not that all people ''currently'' value non-violence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idSen1999|Sen 1999]], p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Many different things have been claimed to be of universal value, for example, [[fertility]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idBolin1999|Bolin &amp; Whelehan 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[pleasure]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idMason2006|Mason 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idSen1999|Sen 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of whether anything is of universal value, and, if so, what that thing or those things are, is relevant to [[psychology]], [[political science]], and [[philosophy]], among other fields.

==Perspectives from various disciplines==

===Philosophy===
[[Philosophical]] study of universal value addresses questions such as the meaningfulness of universal value or whether universal values exist.

===Sociology===
[[Sociological]] study of universal value addresses how such values are formed in a society.

===Psychology and the search for universal values===
[[Shalom H. Schwartz|S. H. Schwartz]], along with a number of psychology colleagues, has carried out [[empirical]] research investigating whether there are universal values, and what those values are. Schwartz defined 'values' as "conceptions of the desirable that influence the way people select action and evaluate events".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idSchwartz1987|Schwartz &amp; Bilsky 1987]], p. 550&lt;/ref&gt; He hypothesised that universal values would relate to three different types of human need: biological needs, social co-ordination needs, and needs related to the welfare and survival of groups. Schwartz's results from a series of studies that included surveys of more than 25,000 people in 44 countries with a wide range of different cultural types suggest that there are fifty-six specific universal values and ten types of universal value.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idSchwartz1994|Schwartz 1994]]&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz's ten types of universal value are: [[Power (sociology)|power]], achievement, [[hedonism]], [[stimulation]], [[autonomy|self-direction]], [[universalism]], [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]], [[tradition]], [[conformity]], and [[security]]. Below are each of the value types, with the specific related values alongside: 
*''Power'': [[authority]]; [[leadership]]; dominance, social power, wealth
*''Achievement'': success; capability; ambition; [[Social influence|influence]]; [[intelligence]]; [[self-respect]]
*''Hedonism'': [[pleasure]]; enjoying life
*''Stimulation'': daring activities; varied life; exciting life
*''Self-direction'': [[creativity]]; [[liberty|freedom]]; [[independence]]; [[curiosity]]; choosing your own goals
*''Universalism'': broadmindedness; [[wisdom]]; [[social justice]]; [[Social equality|equality]]; a world at [[peace]]; a world of [[beauty]]; unity with nature; [[Environmentalism|protecting the environment]]; inner harmony
*''Benevolence'': helpfulness; [[honesty]]; [[forgiveness]]; [[loyalty]]; [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]]; [[friendship]]
*''Tradition'': accepting one's portion in life; [[humility]]; devoutness; respect for tradition; [[moderation]]
*''Conformity'': [[self-discipline]]; [[obedience (human behavior)|obedience]]
*''Security'': [[cleanliness]]; family security; [[national security]]; stability of social order; reciprocation of favours; [[health]]; sense of belonging
Schwartz also tested an eleventh possible universal value, '[[spirituality]]', or 'the goal of finding [[meaning of life|meaning in life]]', but found that it does not seem to be recognised in all cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idSchwartz1992|Schwartz 1992]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WashboardPiano.JPG|thumb|200px|Washboard player accompanying piano]]  The '''washboard''' and '''frottoir''' (from [[Cajun French]] "frotter", to rub) are used as a [[percussion instrument]], employing the ribbed metal surface of the cleaning device as a rhythm instrument. As traditionally used in [[jazz]], [[zydeco]], [[skiffle]], [[jug band]], and [[old-time music]], the washboard remained in its wooden frame and is played primarily by tapping, but also scraping the washboard with thimbles. Often the washboard has additional traps, such as a [[wood block]], a [[cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]], and even small [[cymbal]]s. Conversely, the frottoir (zydeco rubboard) dispenses with the frame and consists simply of the metal ribbing hung around the neck. It is played primarily with spoon handles or bottle openers in a combination of strumming, scratching, tapping and rolling.  The frottoir or ''[[vest frottoir]]'' is played as a stroked percussion instrument, often in a band with a [[drum]]mer, while the washboard generally is a replacement for drums. In Zydeco bands, the frottoir is usually played with bottle openers, to make a louder sound. It tends to play counter-rhythms to the drummer. In a jug band, the washboard can also be stroked with a single [[Broom|whisk broom]] and functions as the drums for the band, playing only on the back-beat for most songs, a substitute for a [[snare drum]]. In a four-beat measure, the washboard will stroke on the 2-beat and the 4-beat. Its best sound is achieved using a single steel-wire snare-brush or whisk broom.  However, in a jazz setting, the washboard can also be played with [[thimble]]s on all fingers, tapping out much more complex rhythms, as in [[The Washboard Rhythm Kings]], a full-sized band, and [[Newman Taylor Baker]].

There are three general ways of deploying the washboard for use as an instrument. The first, mainly used by American players like Washboard Chaz of the Washboard Chaz Blues Trio and Ralf Reynolds of the Reynolds Brothers Rhythm Rascals, is to drape it vertically down the chest. The second, used by European players like David Langlois of the Blue Vipers of Brooklyn, Ben Turner of Piedmont Bluz, and Stephane Seva of Paris Washboard, is to hold it horizontally across the lap, or, for more complex setups, to mount it horizontally on a purpose-built stand. The third (and least common) method, used by [[Washboard Sam]], Súle Greg Wilson of the [[Carolina Chocolate Drops]] and Sankofa Strings, and [[Deryck Guyler]], is to hold it in a perpendicular orientation between the legs while seated, so that both sides of the board might be played at the same time.

There is a Polish traditional jazz festival and music award named "[[Złota Tarka]]" (Golden Washboard).  Washboards, called "[[zatula]]s", are also occasionally used in Ukrainian folk music.

==History==
The washboard as a percussion instrument ultimately derives from the practice of [[hamboning]] as practiced in West Africa and brought to the new world by African slaves.   This led to the development of [[Jug bands]] which used [[Jug (musical instrument)|jugs]], [[Spoon (musical instrument)|spoon]]s, and washboards to provide the rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermanbennett.com/washboards.php Herman Bennett: History of washboard playing]&lt;/ref&gt;  Jug bands became popular in the 1920s.

The '''frottoir''', also called a '''[[Zydeco]] rub-board''', is a mid-20th century invention designed specifically for Zydeco music.  It is one of the few musical instruments invented entirely in the United States and represents a distillation of the washboard into essential elements ([[percussive]] surface with shoulder straps).  It was designed in 1946 by [[Clifton Chenier]] and fashioned by Willie Landry, a friend and metalworker at the Texaco refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. Clifton's brother Cleveland Chenier famously played this newly designed rubboard using bottle openers. Likewise, Willie's son, Tee Don Landry, continues the traditional hand manufacturing of rubboards in his small shop in [[Sunset, Louisiana]], between Lafayette and Opelousas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://keyofzrubboards.com/ Key of Z Rubboards web page]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 [[Saint Blues Guitar Workshop]] launched an electric washboard percussion instrument called the Woogie Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guitarless.com/2010/02/woogie-board-electric-washboard-craziness/ Woogie Board Electric Washboard Craziness] Retrieved November 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Well known washboard musicians==
{{See also|:Category:Washboard players}}

In British Columbia, Canada, Tony McBride, known as "Mad Fingers McBride", performs with a group called The Genuine Jug Band. Tony is referred to as "The Canadian Washboard King". His percussion set-up was created by Douglas Fraser, of the same band. The washboard set-up was seen in Modern Drummer magazine, August 2014 edition.

Musician [[Steve Katz (musician)|Steve Katz]] famously played washboard with the [[Even Dozen Jug Band]].  His playing can be heard on the group's legendary [[The Even Dozen Jug Band (album)|self-titled]] [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] recording from 1964. Katz reprised his washboard playing on ''Played a Little Fiddle'', a 2007 recording featuring [[Steve Katz (musician)|Steve Katz]], [[Stefan Grossman]] and [[Danny Kalb]]. Katz's washboard approach is notable as he plays the instrument horizontally. Additionally, Katz uses fingerpicks instead of thimbles.

In their earliest incarnations as [[The Quarrymen]], [[The Beatles]] were a [[skiffle]] band, featuring [[Pete Shotton]] on washboard.

During their early years, [[Mungo Jerry]] frequently featured washboard on stage and on record, played by Joe Rush.

[[Jim "Dandy" Mangrum]], lead singer of [[Southern rock]] band [[Black Oak Arkansas]], is well known for incorporating the washboard into many of the band's songs, notably "When Electricity Came to Arkansas".  Self-taught Elizabeth Bougerol has made the washboard a key element of [[The Hot Sardines]] jazz band.

Cody Dickinson, a member of hill country blues bands the [[North Mississippi Allstars]] and [[Country Hill Revue]] plays an electrified washboard on a self-written track, "Psychedelic Sex Machine". The song is almost entirely centered around the sound of the washboard, captured by a small clip-on microphone. The sound is then sent through a wah-wah and other effects pedals to create a fresher, more innovative and up-to-date sound for the washboard. A frottoir is played with a stroking instrument (usually with spoon handles or a pair of bottle-openers) in each hand. In a 4-beat measure, the frottoir will be stroked 8 to 16 times. It plays more like a [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]] percussion instrument, rather than as a drum. The rhythms used are often similar to those played on [[Guiro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipassio.com/hobbies/percussion-instruments/guiro|title=Guiro {{!}} ipassio|website=www.ipassio.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor [[Deryck Guyler]] was well known for his washboard-playing skills.
