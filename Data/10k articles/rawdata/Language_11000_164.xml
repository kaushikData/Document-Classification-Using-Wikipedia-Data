'''ALCOR''' is an early computer language definition created by the '''ALCOR Group''', a consortium of universities, research institutions and manufacturers in Europe and the United States which was founded in 1959 and which had 60 members in 1966. The group had the aim of a common [[compiler]] specification for a subset of [[ALGOL 60]] after the ALGOL meeting in Copenhagen in 1958.  ALCOR is an acronym, from '''AL'''GOL '''Co'''nverte'''r'''.

In addition, the naming of Alcor is an astronomical reference. Algol is named, in addition to its programming application, for the star [[Algol]]; In this way, Alcor is also named in astronomical reference for the star [[Alcor (star)|Alcor]].

In Europe, a high level machine architecture for [[ALGOL 60]] was devised which was emulated on various real computers, among them the Siemens 2002 and the [[IBM 7090]]. An ALGOL manual was published which provided a detailed introduction of all features of the language with many program snippets, and four appendixes:{{SpecialChars

'''Absurdistan''' is a term sometimes used to [[satire|satirically]] describe a country in which [[absurdity]] is the norm, especially in its public authorities and government. The expression was originally used by [[Eastern bloc]] [[dissident]]s to refer to parts (or all) of the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Soviet satellite|satellite]] states. 

== Origins ==

The first known printed use of the word "Absurdistan" appeared in 1971 in the German monthly ''Politische Studien''&lt;ref&gt;Monatshefte der Hochschule für politische Wissenschaften, München, veröffentlicht vom Isar-Verlag. (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; "... erkennen wir, dass wir uns hier in ''Absurdistan'' bewegen."&lt;ref&gt;''Political Studies'': Monthly of the University for political Studies, Munich, published by Isar-Verlag (1971) (free translation): ''... we recognize, that we are here venturing on Absurdistan territory.''&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in [[Czech language|Czech]], the term ''Absurdistán'' was used by dissident and later president [[Václav Havel]]. This seems to indicate that use of the term began during [[perestroika]]. The first recorded printed use of the term in [[English language|English]] was in  ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]'' in an article on August 26, 1989, about Czechoslovakia (''Czechoslovakians have taken to calling their country "Absurdistan" because everyday life there has long resembled the "[[Theatre of the Absurd]]".'') On September 18, 1989, an article in ''[[The Nation]]'' was called ''Prague Summer of '89: Journey to Absurdistan''. On August 30, 1990, ''[[The New York Times]]'' used it in an article about the Soviet Union.,&lt;ref&gt;"Sununu Tutors the Kremlin's Staff" by Francis X. Clines&lt;/ref&gt; and a January 18, 1990, ''[[Village Voice]]'' interview with Havel by Bonnie Sue Stein and Vit Horejs was headlined "The New King of Absurdistan".

== Other uses ==

[[File:Autobus - Apsurdistan.jpg|thumb|A French bus DA-591-TG parked in Prague near the Trafačka art gallery]]

After its original reference to countries like [[Turkmenistan]], [[Afghanistan]] and others ending in [[-stan]] in ironical use for the collapsing [[Eastern bloc]], the term was extended to other countries. The term has been used in several titles of movies, books, and articles:

* The German comic book ''Abenteuer in Absurdistan mit Micky Maus'' (Germany 1993, volume 189 of the comic series "Walt Disneys Lustiges Taschenbuch").
* ''Welcome to Absurdistan: [[Ukraine]], the Soviet Disunion and the West'' by Lubomyr Luciuc, 1994 ({{ISBN|096941255X}}).&lt;ref name="Luciuk1995"&gt;{{cite book|first=Lubomyr Y. |last=Luciuk|title=Welcome to Absurdistan: Ukraine, the Soviet disunion and the West|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=PboWAQAAMAAJ}}|year=1995|publisher=Kashtan Press|isbn=978-1-896354-04-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The song "Absurdistan" by [[Blind Passengers]] (both single and video, 1995).
* "Absurdistan" is a song by [[Germany|German]] [[darkwave]]/[[gothic rock]] [[band (music)|band]] [[Goethes Erben]], from their 1997 [[single (music)|single]] ''[[Sitz der Gnade]]''. The title is often capitalized as "Absurd'''IST'''an" to indicate a wordplay on “Absurd ist an”, roughly translating to “The absurd is on”.
* ''Hazám, Abszurdisztán'' (Absurdistan, my Home) is a book by Lajos Grendel, Bratislava, 1998 ({{ISBN|807149206X}}).
* ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Geboren in Absurdistan|de}}'', 1999 Austrian movie.

'''Agnosia''' is the inability to process sensory information. Often there is a loss of ability to recognize objects, persons, sounds, shapes, or smells while the specific sense is not defective nor is there any significant memory loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://brainmind.com/Agnosia.html|title= AGNOSIA}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually associated with [[Acquired brain injury|brain injury]] or [[neurological illness]], particularly after damage to the [[Brodmann area 37|occipitotemporal border]], which is part of the [[ventral stream]].&lt;ref name="KolbWhishaw2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kolb|first1=Bryan|last2=Whishaw|first2=Ian Q.|title=Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6PJFAAAAYAAJ|date=3 March 2003|publisher=Worth Publishers|isbn=978-0-7167-5300-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Agnosia only affects a single modality,&lt;ref name="M.S.Burns (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burns |first=MS |title=Clinical management of agnosia |journal=Top Stroke Rehabil |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=1–9 |year=2004 |pmid=14872395 |doi=10.1310/N13K-YKYQ-3XX1-NFAV |url=http://thomasland.metapress.com/content/n13kykyq3xx1nfav/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128145754/http://thomasland.metapress.com/content/n13kykyq3xx1nfav/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as vision or hearing.&lt;ref name="NINDS Agnosia Information Page"&gt;{{cite web|title=NINDS Agnosia Information Page|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/agnosia/agnosia.htm|publisher=National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke|access-date=2012-03-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127103607/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/agnosia/agnosia.htm|archive-date=2013-01-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, a top-down interruption is considered to cause the disturbance of handling perceptual information.&lt;ref name="Center for International Rehabilitation Research Information and Exchange"&gt;{{cite web|title=Agnosia|url=http://cirrie.buffalo.edu/encyclopedia/en/article/290/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |-
 | [[Associative visual agnosia]] || Patients can describe visual scenes and classes of objects but still fail to recognize them. They may, for example, know that a fork is something you eat with but may mistake it for a spoon. Patients suffering from associative agnosia are still able to reproduce an image through copying.
 |-
 | [[Astereognosis]] || Also known as somatosensory agnosia, it is connected to tactile sense—that is, touch. Patient finds it difficult to recognize objects by touch based on its texture, size and weight. However, they may be able to describe it verbally or recognize same kind of objects from pictures or draw pictures of them. Thought to be connected to lesions or damage in [[somatosensory cortex]].

 | [[Auditory agnosia]] || Auditory agnosia has been recognized since 1877.&lt;ref name="Goldstein1974" /&gt; With auditory agnosia, there is difficulty distinguishing environmental and non-verbal auditory cues including difficulty distinguishing speech from non-speech sounds even though hearing is usually normal.  There are two types of auditory agnosia: semantic associative and discriminative agnosia.  Semantic associative agnosia is associated with lesions to the left hemisphere, whereas discriminative agnosia is associated with lesions to the right hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vignolo|first=L.

===Visual agnosia===
[[Visual agnosia]] is a broad category that refers to a deficiency in the ability to recognize visual objects. Visual agnosia can be further subdivided into two different subtypes: [[apperceptive agnosia|apperceptive visual agnosia]] and [[associative visual agnosia]].&lt;ref name="Cognitive Psychology"&gt;{{cite book|last=al.]|first=Kathleen M. Galotti … [et|title=Cognitive psychology : in and out of the laboratory|year=2010|publisher=Nelson|location=Canada|isbn=978-0-17-644065-7|edition=1st Canadian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals with apperceptive visual agnosia display the ability to see contours and outlines when shown an object, but they experience difficulty if asked to categorize objects. Apperceptive visual agnosia is associated with damage to one hemisphere, specifically damage to the posterior sections of the right hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Cognitive Psychology" /&gt;

In contrast, individuals with associative visual agnosia experience difficulty when asked to name objects. Associative agnosia is associated with damage to both the right and left hemispheres at the occipitotemporal border.&lt;ref name="Cognitive Psychology" /&gt;  A specific form of associative visual agnosia is known as prosopagnosia.  [[Prosopagnosia]] is the inability to recognize faces.  For example, these individuals have difficulty recognizing friends, family and coworkers.&lt;ref name="Cognitive Psychology" /&gt; However, individuals with prosopagnosia can recognize all other types of visual stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silverman|first=Jay Friedenberg, Gordon|title=Cognitive science : an introduction to the study of mind|publisher=SAGE|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|isbn=978-1-4129-7761-6|edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speech agnosia===

Speech agnosia, or [[auditory verbal agnosia]], refers to "an inability to comprehend spoken words despite intact hearing, speech production and reading ability".&lt;ref name="The superior temporal sulcus"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howard|first1=Harry|title=The superior temporal sulcus|url=http://www.tulane.edu/~howard/BrLg/t9-STS.html#id1|website=Brain and Language|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients report that they do indeed hear sounds being produced, but that the sounds are fundamentally unrecognizable/untranslatable.

#EXAMINER: What did you eat for breakfast?
#PATIENT: Breakfast, breakfast, it sounds familiar but it doesn't speak to me. (Obler &amp; Gjerlow 1999:45)

Despite an inability to process what the speaker is saying, some patients have been reported to recognize certain characteristic information about the speaker's voice (such as being a man or woman).&lt;ref name="The superior temporal sulcus"/&gt;

==Causes==
Agnosia can result from [[stroke]]s, [[dementia]], or other [[neurological disorder]]s. It may also be trauma-induced by a head injury, brain infection, or hereditary.  Additionally, some forms of agnosia may be the result of developmental disorders.&lt;ref name="NINDS Agnosia Information Page" /&gt; Damage causing agnosia usually occurs in either the occipital or parietal lobes of the brain.  Although one modality may be affected, cognitive abilities in other areas are preserved.&lt;ref name="NINDS Agnosia Information Page" /&gt;

Patients who experience dramatic [[recovery from blindness]] experience significant to total agnosia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/content/articles/060619fr_archive01
 | title = The New Yorker: From the Archives: Content

The effect of damage to the [[superior temporal sulcus]] is consistent with several types of neurolinguistic deficiencies, and some contend that agnosia is one of them. The superior temporal sulcus is vital for speech comprehension because the region is highly involved with the lexical interface. According to the 1985 TRACE II Model, the lexical interface associates sound waves (phonemes) with morphological features to produce meaningful words. This association process is accomplished by lateral inhibition/excitement of certain words within an individual's lexicon (vocabulary).&lt;ref name="The superior temporal sulcus"/&gt; For instance, if an experimenter were to say DOG aloud, the utterance would activate and inhibit various words within the subjects lexical interface:
* DOG activates 3, and inhibits 0 letters in '''DOG'''. – +3
* DOG activates 2, and inhibits 1 letters in F'''OG'''. – +2
* DOG activates 1, and inhibits 2 letters in '''D'''AN. – +1
The consistency of this model to agnosia is shown by evidence that bilateral lesions to the superior temporal sulcus produces 'pure word deafness' (Kussmaul, 1877), or as it's understood today—speech agnosia. Patients with pure word deafness demonstrate the inability to recognize and process speech sounds with normal auditory processing for non-speech sounds below the level of the cortex.&lt;ref name="The superior temporal sulcus"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
In order to assess an individual for agnosia, it must be verified that the individual is not suffering from a loss of sensation, and that both their language abilities and intelligence are intact.  In order for an individual to be diagnosed with agnosia, they must only be experiencing a sensory deficit in a single modality.  To make a diagnosis, the distinction between apperceptive and associative agnosia must be made.  This distinction can be made by having the individual complete copying and matching tasks.  If the individual is suffering from a form of apperceptive agnosia they will not be able to match two stimuli that are identical in appearance.  In contrast, if an individual is suffering from a form of associative agnosia, they will not be able to match different examples of a stimulus.  For example, an individual who has been diagnosed with associative agnosia in the visual modality would not be able to match pictures of a laptop that is open with a laptop that is closed.&lt;ref name="M.S.Burns (2004)" /&gt;

===Pure alexia===
Individuals with pure alexia usually have difficulty reading words as well as difficulty with identifying letters.  In order to assess whether an individual has pure alexia, tests of copying and recognition must be performed.  An individual with pure alexia should be able to copy a set of words, and should be able to recognize letters.&lt;ref name="M.S.Burns (2004)" /&gt;

===Prosopagnosia===
Individuals are usually shown pictures of human faces that may be familiar to them such as famous actors, singers, politicians or family members.  The pictures shown to the patient are selected to be age and culture appropriate.  The task involves the examiner asking the individual to name each face.  If the individual cannot name whose face appears in the picture, the examiner may ask a question that would help to recognize the face in the picture.&lt;ref name="M.S.Burns (2004)" /&gt;

==Treatment==
For all practical purposes, there is no direct cure. Patients may improve if information is presented in other modalities than the damaged one. Different types of therapies can help to reverse the effects of agnosia. In some cases, [[occupational therapy]] or [[speech therapy]] can improve agnosia, depending on its cause.

Initially many individuals with a form of agnosia are unaware of the extent to which they have either a perceptual or recognition deficit.  This may be caused by anosognosia which is the lack of awareness of a deficit.  This lack of awareness usually leads to a form of denial and resistance to any form of help or treatment.  There are various methods that can be used which can help the individual recognize the impairment in [[perception]] or recognition that they may have.  A patient can be presented with a stimulus to the impaired modality only to help increase their awareness of their deficit.  Alternatively, a task can be broken down into its component parts so that the individual can see each part of the problem caused by the deficit.  Once the individual acknowledges their perceptual or recognition deficit, a form of treatment may be recommended.  There are various forms of treatment such as compensatory strategies with alternate modalities, verbal strategies, alternate cues and organizational strategies.&lt;ref name="M.S.Burns (2004)" /&gt;

===Verbal strategies===

Using verbal descriptions may be helpful for individuals with certain types of agnosia.  Individuals such as prosopagnosics may find it useful to listen to a description of their friend or family member and recognize them based on this description more easily than through visual cues.&lt;ref name="M.S.Burns (2004)" /&gt;

===Alternate cues===

Alternate cues may be particularly useful to an individual with environmental agnosia or prosopagnosia.  Alternate cues for an individual with environmental agnosia may include color cues or [[somatosensory system|tactile]] markers to symbolize a new room or to remember an area by.  Prosopagnosics may use alternate cues such as a scar on an individual's face or crooked teeth in order to recognize the individual.&lt;ref name="M.S.Burns (2004)" /&gt; Hair color and length can be helpful cues as well.&lt;ref name="Center for International Rehabilitation Research Information and Exchange"/&gt;

===Organizational strategies===

Organizational strategies may be extremely helpful for an individual with visual agnosia.  For example, organizing clothes according to different hangers provides tactile cues for the individual, making it easier to identify certain forms of clothing as opposed to relying solely on visual cues.&lt;ref name="M.S.Burns (2004)" /&gt;

===Alternative medicine===
These strategies elicit the use of an unaffected modality.  For example, visual agnosics can use tactile information in replacement of visual information.  Alternatively, an individual with prosopagnosia can use [[Auditory system|auditory information]] in order to replace [[visual system|visual information]].  For example, an individual with prosopagnosia can wait for someone to speak, and will usually recognize the individual from their speech.&lt;ref name="M.S.Burns (2004)" /&gt;

===Current research===
There are clinical trials being done to further research for treatments. At the [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] (NINDS) they support research for [[rare disease]]s like agnosia.&lt;ref name="NINDS Agnosia Information Page" /&gt; Some organizations that are recruiting for trials are using [[ClinicalTrials.gov|clincaltrials.gov]] and give status updates on the trials.&lt;ref name="ClinicalTrials.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title= ClinicalTrials.gov|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=agnosia+&amp;Search=Search }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The term 'agnosia'  comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] ἀγνωσία (''agnosia''), "ignorance", "absence of knowledge". It was introduced by [[Sigmund Freud]] in 1891:&lt;ref&gt;"Freud 1891"&gt;Freud, Sigmund, Zur Auffassung der Aphasien, Vienna, 1891, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; "For disturbances in the recognition of objects, which Finkelnburg classes as asymbolia, I should like to propose the term 'agnosia'." Prior to Freud's introduction of the term, some of the first ideas about agnosia came from [[Carl Wernicke]], who created theories about [[receptive aphasia]] in 1874.  He noted that individuals with receptive aphasia did not possess the ability to understand speech or repeat words.  He believed that receptive aphasia was due to lesions of the posterior third of the left [[superior temporal gyrus]].  Due to these lesions, Wernicke believed that individuals with receptive aphasia had a limited deafness for certain sounds and frequencies in [[speech]].&lt;ref name="Goldstein1974"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldstein|first1=Marvin N.|title=Auditory agnosia for speech ("pure word-deafness")|journal=Brain and Language|volume=1|issue=2|year=1974|pages=195–204|issn=0093-934X|doi=10.1016/0093-934X(74)90034-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Wernicke, came Kussmaul in 1877 who attempted to explain why [[auditory verbal agnosia]], also known as word deafness, occurs.  Contrary to Wernicke's explanations, Kussmaul believed auditory verbal agnosia was the result of major destruction to the first left temporal gyrus.  Kussmaul also posited about the origins of [[alexia (acquired dyslexia)]] also known as word blindness.  He believed that word blindness was the result of lesions to the left angular and [[Supramarginal gyrus|supramarginal gyri]].&lt;ref name="Goldstein1974" /&gt;

Heinrich Lissauer shared his ideas about agnosia after Wernicke and Kussmaul.&lt;ref name="Goldstein1974" /&gt; In 1890, he theorized that there were two ways in which object recognition impairment could occur.  One way in which impairment could occur was if there was damage to early perceptual processing or if there was damage to the actual object representation.  If the actual object representation was damaged, this would not allow the object to be stored in visual memory, and therefore the individual would not be able to recognize the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vecera|first=P. S|author2=Gilds, S. K|title=What processing is impaired in appreceptive agnosia? Evidence from normal subjects|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|year=1998|volume=10|pages=568–580|doi=10.1162/089892998562979|pmid=9802990|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the time of Wernicke, Kussmaul and Lissauer there was little known about the [[cerebral cortex]].  Today, with new [[neuroimaging]] techniques, we have been able to expand our knowledge on agnosia greatly.&lt;ref name="M.S.Burns (2004)" /&gt;

{{Heraldic achievement}}
In [[heraldry]] and heraldic [[vexillology]], a '''blazon''' is a formal description of a [[coat of arms]], [[flag]] or similar [[emblem]], from which the reader can reconstruct the appropriate image. The verb ''to blazon'' means to create such a description. The visual depiction of a coat of arms or flag has traditionally had considerable latitude in design, but a verbal blazon specifies the essentially distinctive elements. A coat of arms or flag is therefore primarily defined not by a picture but rather by the wording of its blazon (though in modern usage flags are often additionally and more precisely defined using geometrical specifications). ''Blazon'' also refers to the specialized language in which a blazon is written, and, as a verb, to the act of writing such a description. This language has its own [[vocabulary]], [[grammar]] and [[syntax]], which becomes essential for comprehension when blazoning a complex coat of arms.

Other armorial objects and devices – such as [[badge]]s, [[banner]]s, and [[Seal (emblem)|seal]]s – may also be described in blazon.

The noun and verb ''blazon'' (referring to a verbal description) are not to be confused with the noun ''emblazonment'', or the verb ''to emblazon'', both of which relate to the graphic representation of a coat of arms or heraldic device.

==Etymology==
The word ''blazon'' is derived from French ''blason'', "shield". It is found in English by the end of the 14th century.&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{OED|blazon, n. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly, heraldic authorities believed that the word was related to the German verb ''blasen'', "to blow (a horn)".&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, 9th. ed., vol.11, p.683, "Heraldry"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Blazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Present-day lexicographers reject this theory as conjectural and disproved.&lt;ref name="oed" /&gt;

==Grammar==
Blazon is generally designed to eliminate ambiguity of interpretation, to be as concise as possible, and to avoid repetition and extraneous punctuation. English [[antiquarian]] [[Charles Boutell]] stated in 1864: 

{{quote|''Heraldic language'' is most concise, and it is always minutely exact, definite, and explicit; all unnecessary words are omitted, and all repetitions are carefully avoided; and, at the same time, every detail is specified with absolute precision. The nomenclature is equally significant, and its aim is to combine definitive exactness with a brevity that is indeed [[laconic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Boutell|Boutell, Charles]], [https://archive.org/details/heraldryhistoric01bout ''Heraldry, Historical and Popular''], 3rd edition, London, 1864, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, [[John Brooke-Little]], [[Norroy and Ulster King of Arms]], wrote in 1985: "Although there are certain conventions as to how arms shall be blazoned ... many of the supposedly hard and fast rules laid down in heraldic manuals [including those by heralds] are often ignored."&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Brooke-Little: ''An Heraldic Alphabet''; new and revised edition, p.&amp;nbsp;52. London: Robson Books, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

A given coat of arms may be drawn in many different ways, all considered equivalent and faithful to the blazon, just as the letter "A" may be printed in many different [[font]]s while still being the same letter. For example, the shape of the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] is almost always immaterial, with very limited exceptions (e.g., the [[coat of arms of Nunavut]], for which a round shield is specified).

The main conventions of blazon are as follows:
* Every blazon of a coat of arms begins by describing the [[field (heraldry)|field]] (background), with the first letter capitalised, followed by a [[comma]] ",". In a majority of cases this is a single [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]]; e.g. ''[[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]]'' (blue).
* If the field is complex, the [[variation of the field|variation]] is described, followed by the tinctures used; e.g. ''Chequy gules and argent'' (checkered red and white).
* If the shield is [[division of the field|divided]], the division is described, followed by the tinctures of the subfields, beginning with the [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] side (shield bearer's right, but viewer's left) of the ''chief'' (upper) edge; e.g. ''Party per pale argent and vert'' (dexter half silver, [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] half green), or ''[[Quartering (heraldry)|Quarterly]] argent and gules'' (clockwise from viewer's top left, i.e. ''dexter chief'': white, red, white, red). In the case of a divided shield, it is common for the word "party" or "parted" to be omitted (e.g., ''Per pale argent and vert, a tree eradicated counterchanged'').
* Some authorities prefer to capitalise the names of tinctures and charges, but this convention is far from universal. Where tinctures are not capitalised, an exception may be made for the metal ''[[Or (heraldry)|Or]]'', in order to avoid confusion with the English word "or". Where space is at a premium, tincture names may be abbreviated: e.g., ''ar.'' for ''[[argent]]'', ''gu.'' for ''[[gules]]'', ''az.'' for ''[[Azure (heraldry)|azure]]'', ''sa.'' for ''[[Sable (heraldry)|sable]]'', and ''purp.'' for ''[[purpure]]''. 
* Following the description of the field, the principal [[Ordinary (heraldry)|ordinary]] or ordinaries and [[charge (heraldry)|charge]](s) are named, with their tincture(s); e.g., ''a [[bend (heraldry)|bend]] [[Or (heraldry)|or]].''
* The principal ordinary or charge is followed by any other charges placed on or around it. If a charge is a bird or a beast, its [[attitude (heraldry)|attitude]] is defined, followed by the creature's tincture, followed by anything that may be differently coloured; e.g. ''An eagle '''displayed''' gules '''armed''' and wings charged with trefoils or'' (see the [[coat of arms of Brandenburg]] below).
* ''[[Tincture (heraldry)#Counterchanging|Counterchanged]]'' means that a charge which straddles a line of division is given the same tinctures as the divided field, but reversed (see the arms of Behnsdorf below).
* A [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartered]] (composite) shield is blazoned one quarter (panel) at a time, proceeding by rows from chief (top) to base, and within each row from dexter (the right side of the bearer holding the shield) to sinister; in other words, from the viewer's left to right.   
* Following the description of the shield, any additional components of the [[Achievement (heraldry)|achievement]] – such as [[crown (heraldry)|crown]]/[[coronet]], [[helmet (heraldry)|helmet]], [[torse]], [[mantling]], [[crest (heraldry)|crest]], [[motto]], [[supporter]]s and [[compartment (heraldry)|compartment]] – are described in turn, using the same terminology and syntax.
* A convention often followed historically was to name a tincture explicitly only once within a given blazon. If the same tincture was found in different places within the arms, this was addressed either by ordering all elements of like tincture together prior to the tincture name (e.g., ''Argent, two chevrons and a canton gules''); or by naming the tincture only at its first occurrence, and referring to it at subsequent occurrences obliquely, for example by use of the phrase "of the field" (e.g., ''Argent, two chevrons and on a canton gules a lion passant of the field''); or by reference to its numerical place in the sequence of named tinctures (e.g., ''Argent, two chevrons and on a canton gules a lion passant of the first'': in both these examples, the lion is ''argent''). However, these conventions are now avoided by the [[College of Arms]] in London, and by most other formal granting bodies, as they may introduce ambiguity to complex blazons.&lt;ref name="CoA style"&gt;{{cite web |title=Blazon in CoA |work=CoA: The Coat of Arms |url=http://www.the-coat-of-arms.co.uk/blazon-in-coa/ |accessdate=26 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is common to print all heraldic blazons in [[Italic type|italic]].&lt;ref name="CoA style"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boutell 1864, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Heraldry has its own vocabulary, word-order and punctuation, and presenting it in italics indicates to the reader the use of a quasi-foreign language.

===French vocabulary and grammar===
Because heraldry developed at a time when English clerks wrote in [[Anglo-Norman French]], many terms in English heraldry are of French origin. Some of the details of the syntax of blazon also follow French practice: thus, [[adjective]]s are normally placed after [[noun]]s rather than before. 

A number of heraldic adjectives may be given in either a French or an anglicised form: for example, a ''[[cross pattée]]'' or a ''cross patty''; a ''[[cross fitchée]]'' or a ''cross fitchy''. In modern English blazons, the anglicised form tends to be preferred.&lt;ref name="CoA style"/&gt;

Where the French form is used, a problem may arise as to the appropriate adjectival ending, determined in normal French usage by gender and number.
{{quote|To describe two hands as ''appaumées'', because the word ''main'' is feminine in French, savours somewhat of pedantry. A person may be a good armorist, and a tolerable French scholar, and still be uncertain whether an escallop-shell covered with [[bezant]]s should be blazoned as bezanté or bezantée.&lt;ref name="Cussans p47"&gt;{{cite book |first=John E. |last=Cussans |authorlink=John Edwin Cussans |title=The Handbook of Heraldry |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus |place=London |edition=2nd |year=1874 |page=47 |url=https://archive.org/stream/handbookofherald00cuss_0#page/n51/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[John Edwin Cussans|J. E. Cussans]] recommended spelling all French adjectives in the masculine singular, without regard to the gender and number of the nouns they qualify; but believed that a more usual convention was to adhere to the feminine singular form, for example: ''a chief undée'' and  ''a saltire undée'', even though the French nouns ''chef'' and ''sautoir'' are in fact masculine.&lt;ref name="Cussans p47"/&gt;

==Complexity==
Full descriptions of shields range in complexity, from a single word to a convoluted series describing compound shields:
*Arms of [[Brittany]]: ''Ermine''
*''Azure, a Bend Or'', over which the families of [[Scrope]] and [[Duke of Westminster|Grosvenor]] fought a famous legal battle (see [[Scrope v. Grosvenor]] and image above).
*Arms of [[Östergötland]], [[Sweden]]: ''Gules, a Griffin with dragon wings tail and tongue [[Attitude (heraldry)#Rampant|rampant]] Or armed beaked langued and membered Azure between four Roses Argent''.
*Arms of [[Hungary]] dating from 1867, when part of [[Austria-Hungary]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt; ''Quarterly I. Azure three Lions' Heads affronté Crowned Or (for [[Dalmatia]]); II. [[chequy]] [[Argent]] and [[Gules]] (for [[Croatia]]); III.

'''Burji language''' (alternate names: ''Bembala, Bambala, Daashi'') is an [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language spoken by the [[Burji people]] who reside in [[Ethiopia]] south of [[Lake Chamo]].  There are over 46,000 speakers in Ethiopia, and a further 10,400 speakers in [[Kenya]]. Burji belongs to the [[Highland East Cushitic]] group of the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branch of the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] family.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt;

The language has the SOV (subject–object–verb) word order common to the Cushitic family.  The verb morphology distinguishes passive and middle [[grammatical voice]], as well as causative.  Verbal suffixes mark the person, number, and gender of the subject.

The New Testament was published in the Burji language in 1993. A collection of Burji proverbs, translated into English, French, and Swahili, is available on the Web.&lt;ref&gt;Angelique Chelo. 2016.

'''Chavundraya ''' or '''Chamundaraya''' ([[Kannada]] ''Cāmuṇḍarāya, Cāvuṇḍarāya'', 940–989) was an [[Indian people|Indian]] military commander, architect, poet and minister. He served in the court of the [[Western Ganga dynasty]] of [[Talakad]] (in modern [[Karnataka]], India). A person of many talents, in 982 he commissioned the construction of the [[monolith]]ic statue of [[Bahubali]], the Gomateshwara, at [[Shravanabelagola]], an important place of pilgrimage for [[Jainism]]. He was a devotee of the Jain Acharya [[Nemichandra]] and Ajitasena [[Bhattaraka]] and was an influential person during the reigns of Marasimha II Satyavakya, (963–975). Rachamalla IV Satyavakya, (975–986) and Rachamalla V (Rakkasaganga), (986–999).

A courageous commander with the title ''Samara [[Parashurama|Paraśurāma]]'' (''lit'', "Battle-[[Rama]] wielding an ax"), he found time to pursue his literary interests as well and became a renowned writer in [[Kannada]] and [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref name="poet"&gt;Kamath (2001), p45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="poet1"&gt;Sastri (1955), pp356-357&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote an important and existing prose piece called the ''Chavundaraya Purana'', also known as ''Trishasthi Lakshana Purana'', in Kannada (978) and the ''Cāritrasāra'' in Sanskrit. He patronised the famous Kannada grammarians Gunavarma and [[Nagavarma I]] and the poet [[Ranna (Kannada poet)|Ranna]] whose writing ''Parusharama Charite'' may have been a eulogy of his patron.&lt;ref name="poet"/&gt; Because of his many lasting contributions, Chavundaraya is an important figure in the history of medieval Karnataka.

In his writing, he claims he was from the ''Brahmakshatriya'' ''Vamsa'' ([[Brahmin]] converted to the [[Kshatriya]] caste).&lt;ref name="line"&gt;Kulkarni (1975) in Adiga (2006), p195&lt;/ref&gt; The 10th century Algodu inscription of the [[Mysore district]] and the Arani inscription from the [[Mandya district]] provide more information on the family genealogy of Chavundaraya. It states that Chavundaraya was the grandson of Govindamayya who is praised for his knowledge and [[Dharma]] and was the son of Mabalayya, a subordinate of King Marasimha II. Mabalayya and his brother Isarayya are praised for their prowess in the inscription.&lt;ref name="prowess"&gt;Gopal et al. (1976) in Adiga (2006), p196&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that their political position under King Marasimha II may have led to a gradual adoption of [[Kshatriya]] status by this Brahmin family.&lt;ref name="ksha"&gt;Adiga (2006), p196&lt;/ref&gt;

An inscriptional eulogy of Chavundaraya on the ''[[Tyagada Brahmadeva Pillar]]'' at Shravanabelagola (which has beautiful engravings and relief representing Chavundaraya and his guru Nemichandra at the base) praises him thus,
{{Cquote|A sun in the shape of a jewel adorning the crest of the eastern mountains, the ''brahmaksatra'' race; a moon in the shape of the splendour of his fame causing to swell the ocean, the ''brahmaksatra'' race; the central gem to the pearl necklace of [[Lakshmi]], procured from the Rohana mountain, the ''brahmaksatra'' race.&lt;ref name="race"&gt;Gopal et al. (1973) in Adiga (2006), p196&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Commander==
[[File:Gomateswara.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gomateshwara]] monolith at [[Shravanabelagola]] (982–983 CE)]]
As a commander for the Western Ganga [[feudatory]] of the [[Rashtrakutas]], he fought many battles for their Rashtrakutas overlords, beginning in the days of the Rashtrakuta king, [[Khottiga Amoghavarsha]]. In fact, the Gangas supported the cause of the Rashtrakutas till the very end.&lt;ref name="espouse"&gt;Kamath (2001), p84&lt;/ref&gt; During the last years of Rashtrakuta rule, the Gangas were also under constant threat of civil war and from invasions of the increasingly powerful [[Chola Dynasty]]. When a civil war broke out in 975, Chavundaraya supported the cause of Prince Rachamalla IV and installed him on the throne.&lt;ref name="throne"&gt;Kamath (2001), p46&lt;/ref&gt;

Chavundaraya suppressed a rebellion made by Panchaldeva Mahasamanta in 975 AD and slew Mudurachayya (who held the titles ''Chaladanka Ganga'' and ''Gangarabanta'') in the battle of Bageyur. He thus avenged the death of his brother Nagavarma by Mudurachayya. After these battles where Chavundaraya showed his gallantry, Rachamalla IV ascended the Ganga throne. For his exploits, Chavundraya earned the titles ''Samara Parsurama'', ''Vira Martanda'', ''Ranarangasimha'', ''Samara Dhurandhara'', ''Vairikula Kaladanda'', ''Bhuja Vikrama'' and ''Bhatamara''.&lt;ref name ="Panchaldeva mahasamanta"&gt;Rao, Krishna M. V., ''The Gangas of Talakad: A Monograph on the History of Mysore from the Fourth to the Close of the Eleventh Century'', (1936), pp109 – 113, Publishers:B.G. Paul and Company&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
[[File:Handwriting (10th century) of Kannada poet Chavundaraya at Shravanabelagola.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Inscribed handwriting (in Kannada characters) of Chavundaraya on Chandragiri hill in [[Shravanabelagola]], Karnataka]]
Chavundaraya's writing, ''Chavundaraya Purana'', is the second oldest existing work in prose style in Kannada and is a summary of the Sanskrit works, ''Adipurana'' and ''Uttarapurana'', written by [[Jinasena]] and [[Gunabhadra (Jain monk)|Gunabhadra]] during the rule of Rashtrakuta [[Amoghavarsha I]]. The prose work, composed in lucid Kannada, was meant mainly for the common man and avoided any reference to complicated elements of Jain doctrines and philosophy. In his writing, the influences of his predecessor [[Adikavi Pampa]] and contemporary Ranna are seen. ''Trishashtilakshana purana'' narrates the legends of twenty-four Jain [[Tirthankara]]s, twelve ''Chakravartis'', nine ''Balabhadras'', nine ''Narayanas'' and nine ''Pratinarayanas'' – narrations on sixty-three Jain proponents in all.{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=29}}&lt;ref name="jain"&gt;Sastri (1955), p357&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prop"&gt;Kulkarni (1975) in Adiga (2006), p256&lt;/ref&gt;

==Builder==
The monolith Gomateshwara statue dedicated to the Jain saint, [[Bahubali]], was commissioned by Chavundaraya and built on the Indragiri hill (also known as [[Vindhyagiri Hill]]) is a unique example of Western Ganga sculpture. Carved from fine-grained white granite, the image stands on a lotus. It has no support up to the thighs and is 60 feet tall with the face measuring 6.5 feet. With the serene expression on the face of the image, its curled hair with graceful locks, its proportional anatomy, the monolith size, and the combination of its artistry and craftsmanship have led it to be called the mightiest achievement in sculptural art in medieval Karnataka.&lt;ref name="art"&gt;M Seshadri in Kamath (2001), p51&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest monolithic statue in the world.&lt;ref name="keay"&gt;{{cite book

However another view holds that the original shrine itself was consecrated in the 11th century and built in memory of Chavundaraya.&lt;ref name="memory"&gt;S.

'''Chiangmai Sign Language''' (also known as Old or Original Chiangmai Sign Language) is a [[deaf-community sign language]] of Thailand that arose among deaf people who migrated to [[Chiangmai]] for work or family. 
The language is moribund, with all speakers born before 1960. Younger generations have switched to [[Thai Sign Language]].

[[Image:Chine types.svg|thumb|right|100px|S-bottom hull (A), compared to a hard (B) and soft (C) chine hull]]
A '''chine''' in boating refers to a sharp change in angle in the [[Cross_section_(geometry)|cross section]] of a [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]. A hull without chines has a [[smooth curve hull|gradually curving]] cross section. The term '''hard chine''' indicates an angle with little rounding, where a '''soft chine''' would be more rounded, but still involve the meeting of distinct planes.  '''Chine log construction''' is a method of building hard chine boat hulls.  Hard chines are common in [[plywood]] hulls, while soft chines are often found on [[fiberglass]] hulls.

==Reasons for chines==
The oldest type of engineered boats are [[dugout canoe]]s, which were built by hollowing out a log.  These designs generally had rounded bottoms, which made best use of the round shape of the logs.  Traditional planked hulls in most cultures are built by placing wooden planks oriented parallel to the waterflow and attached to bent wooden frames.  This also produced a rounded hull, generally with a sharp bottom edge to form the [[keel]].  Planked boats were built in this manner for most of history.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

The first hulls to start incorporating hard chines were probably shallow draft cargo carrying vessels used on rivers and in [[canal]]s.&lt;ref name="HockerWard2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frederick M. Hocker|author2=Cheryl A. Ward|title=The Philosophy of Shipbuilding: Conceptual Approaches to the Study of Wooden Ships|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MAxh1P1v7okC&amp;pg=PA156|year=2004|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|isbn=978-1-58544-313-0|pages=156–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Once sufficiently powerful marine motors had been developed to allow powerboats to [[Planing (sailing)|plane]], it was found that the flat underside of a chined boat provided maximum hydrodynamic lift and speed.&lt;ref name="Sorensen2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Sorensen|title=Sorensen's Guide to Powerboats, 2/E|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zEix9EaPBn0C&amp;pg=PA40|date=22 November 2007|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-159474-5|pages=40–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boats using chines==
The [[scow]] in particular, in the form of the scow [[schooner]], was the first significant example of a hard chine sailing vessel. While sailing scows had a poor safety reputation, that was due more to their typical cheap construction and tendency to [[Shipwrecking#Instability_and_foundering|founder]] in storms.  As long as it sailed in the protected inland and coastal waters it was designed to operate in, however, the sailing scow was an efficient and cost effective solution to transporting goods from inland sources to the coast.{{cn|date=August 2017}} A good example of this is the [[gundalow]].&lt;ref name="Berry1887"&gt;{{cite book|author=Abel B. Berry|title=The Last Penacook: A Tale of Provincial Times|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZThLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA31|year=1887|publisher=D. Lothrop|pages=31–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working in the same inland waters as the sailing scows was the later [[Steamboat#River_steamboats|river steamboat]].  River steamboats were often built using the same hard chined construction methods of the sailing scows, with a flat bottom, hard chine, and nearly vertical sides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwpl.new-westminster.bc.ca/nwheritage.org/heritagesite/orgs/samson/Tech%20info%20page.htm Samson specs page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825154428/http://www.nwpl.new-westminster.bc.ca/nwheritage.org/heritagesite/orgs/samson/Tech%20info%20page.htm |date=2006-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Punt (boat)|punt]] is one of the older and simplest hard chine small boats.  Consisting usually of a single plank for each side, with a square bow and stern, the punt was in essence a tiny scow.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

==Various types of chine hulls==
[[Image:Chine numbers.svg|thumb|100px|Different numbers of chines]]
The simplest type of chine construction is the single chine "V" shape, with two flat panels joined at the keel (A).  This type of hull is among the simplest to build, but they lack stability on a narrow "V" and may lack freeboard on a wide "V". Single chine hulls are generally only seen on [[multihull]] sailboats, which often use two deep "V" shaped hulls connected by [[aka (sailing)|akas]] to provide mutual stability.

The two chine hull (B), with a [[flat-bottomed boat|flat bottom]] and nearly vertical sides, was the first hard chine design to achieve widespread use.  This design provides far more stability than the single chine hull, with minimum draft and a large cargo capacity.  These characteristics make the two chine hull popular for [[Punt (boat)|punts]], [[barge]]s, and [[scow]]s.

The three chine hull (C) is probably the most common hard chine hull.  Having a shallow "V" in the bottom and near-vertical panels above that, it approximates the shape of traditional rounded hull boats fairly well. This hull is common, even in fiberglass designs where employing chines offers no advantage in construction.

Designs with higher numbers of chines (D), often just called '''multichine''' hulls, are also common. By increasing the number of chines, the hull can very closely approximate a round bottomed hull. [[Kayak]]s, in particular, are often composed of many chines, required for the complex shapes needed to provide good performance under various conditions.  

It is possible to refer to the different hulls by the numbers of the flat panels that make up the boat.  Thus A is a two-panel boat, B is a three-panel boat, C is a four-panel boat and D is an eight-panel boat.

[[Image:Chine log.svg|thumb|right|100px|Two planks joined by a chine log]]
===Plank hulls===
Plank hulls use wooden supports placed along the chines called '''chine logs''' to provide strength where the chines joined.  Beams are then attached to the chine log to support planks running parallel to the chine, while cross-planked sections such as a typical scow bottom may be attached directly to the chine log.  This method of construction originated with the sailing scow&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maritimetrails.org/notes/fall2005/archives/001591.asp Wisconsin's Maritime Trails - Notes From the Field Journal Entry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513085243/http://www.maritimetrails.org/notes/fall2005/archives/001591.asp |date=2006-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to be used today, primarily in home built boats.  

Chine log construction works best for hulls where the sides join a flat bottom at a right angle, but it can be used for other angles as well with an appropriately angled chine log.  Builders of small boats such as punts, where the plank thickness is large compared to the size of the hull, can dispense with the chine log and nail intersecting planks directly into one another.

===Plywood hulls===
[[File:Royal Navy MTB 5.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Navy]] World War II [[Motor Torpedo Boat|MTB]] [[Hull_(watercraft)#Categorization|planing]] at speed on calm water showing its hard chine hull. Note how most of the forepart of the boat is out of the water.]]

A chined hull built out of plywood will often be designed to keep most of the lengthwise joints between the plywood sheets at the chines, thus making the building process easier. While chine logs (often just called chines) can be used for plywood boats,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pdracer.com/hullcstr/page1.htm PDRacer Sailboat&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; another common technique replaces the chine logs with a [[fiberglass]] and [[epoxy]] [[Fillet (mechanics)|fillet]] joint that provides both connection and stiffness to the joint; this method is most commonly called [[stitch and glue]] construction.

The '''Cofán language''' (also '''Kofan''' or '''Kofane'''; [[endonym|autonym]]: '''A'ingae''') is the language of the [[Cofán]] people, an [[Indigenous people|indigenous]] group native to the province [[Sucumbíos Province|Sucumbíos]] in northeast [[Ecuador]] and southern [[Colombia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fischer|first=R.

While Cofán is an [[endangered language]], it is classified as a developing language with 1400 to 2400 speakers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=fcFxAAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=Cof%C3%A1n+language&amp;ots=-KMfU6pxUz&amp;sig=K1L7c04ewq-Sv29gpu_MjTyfRTU#v=onepage&amp;q=Cof%C3%A1n%20language&amp;f=false|title=Subordination in Native South American Languages|last=Gijn|first=Rik van|last2=Haude|first2=Katharina|last3=Muysken|first3=Pieter|date=2011-04-29|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=9789027287090|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of Cofán: Aguarico (spoken in Ecuador) and San Miguel (primarily spoken in Colombia).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Approximately 60% of Cofán speakers in Ecuador are [[Literacy|literate]] in their own language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/con|title=Cofán|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of Cofán in Ecuador is connected to the language in land property rights documents and in the bilingual access to the language in schools. In Colombia, Cofán is more endangered because of war, displacement, and intermarriage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Classification ==
Cofán is a [[language isolate]]. Some scholars claim Cofán is not classified into a [[language family]]. The language does exhibit some lexical similarities to [[Chibchan languages|Chibchan]], a geographically neighboring language. However, evidence of the lexical influence Chibchan has on Cofán does not prove any genetic relationship between the two languages.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=GxMaDQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=Cof%C3%A1n+language&amp;ots=5GY1gHP-np&amp;sig=Ojd3ZN5xL8zuwGBbhfodM4Ye24Y#v=snippet&amp;q=Cofan%20&amp;f=false|title=South American Indian Languages: Retrospect and Prospect|last=Klein|first=Harriet E.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
There are ten vowels in Cofán: five oral vowels and their nasal counterparts.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borman|first=M.B.|date=Summer 1962|title=Studies in Ecuadorian Indian Languages|url=|journal=Summer Institute of Linguistics of the University of Oklahoma|volume=7|pages=45–59|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consonants ===
As noted by Raphael Fischer and Kees Hengeveld, Cofán has a moderately large consonant inventory. A notable feature is the three-way voicing distinction for stops and affricates.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Raphael|last2=Hengeveld|first2=Kees|date=|title=Cofán (A’ingae)|url=|journal=Amazonian Languages: An International Handbook|location=Berlin|publisher=de Gruyter Mouton|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grammar ==
Word order in Cofán is mostly free and flexible and is influenced by pragmatic factors. (Co)subordinate clauses, however, have a strong preference for being predicate-final.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Paragraphs are a distinct and important structure in Cofán grammar. There are fifteen different paragraph types used in Cofán narrative discourse. The narrative paragraph and simultaneous paragraph “form the backbone of narrative discourse.” The coordinate descriptive paragraph and deictic paragraph are used to portray character or participant identity development and to outline situations. Reason, contrast, and antithetical paragraphs are used to foster relationships and tension between speakers and events. Amplification paragraphs, contraction paragraphs, negated antonym paragraphs and cyclic paragraphs are used in “paraphrasing” particular information. Lastly, comment paragraphs and quote and dialogue paragraphs are used to add detail to a narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borman|first=M.B.|date=1977|title=Discourse Grammar: Studies in Indigenous Languages of Colombia, Panama, and Ecuador|url=|journal=Summer Institute of Linguistics|volume=52:3|pages=290–338|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orthography ==
A written system of the Cofán [[iarchive:rosettaproject con ortho-1|alphabet]] has been devised by M. B. Borman. Some are simple letters, while others are compound. Nasalization on vowels is orthographically represented by placing {{angbr|n}} after the vowel. (For example, /{{IPA|ã}}/ is written {{angbr|an}}.) Prenasalization on stops and affricates is orthographically represented either by placing {{angbr|m}} before bilabials (for example, {{angbr|mb}} for /{{IPA|ᵐb}}/) or by placing {{angbr|n}} elsewhere (for example, {{angbr|nd}} for /{{IPA|ⁿd}}/ and {{angbr|ng}} for /{{IPA|ⁿg}}/).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/rosettaproject_con_ortho-1|title=Cofan cosmology and history as revealed in their legends|last=Borman|first=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3079">A '''copywriting agency''' is a business that provides writing and editing services to businesses and other organizations. Like individual copywriters, [[copywriting]] agencies may offer writing on a for-hire or per-project basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://job-descriptions.careerplanner.com/Copy-Writers.cfm|title=Job Duties and Tasks for: "Copy Writer"|publisher=CareerPlanner.com|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, because copywriting agencies often offer the services of many staff members, they may offer a broader range of services than can individuals. These services include but not limited to writing, editing, content or marketing consulting, [[brand]]ing, [[Product naming|naming]], [[scriptwriting]], [[speechwriting]], [[information architecture]], print and [[web design]] and layout, [[Software engineering|software development]], [[social network]]ing consulting and implementation, and [[project management]]. An agency may also partner with other businesses—for example, design or advertising firms—or with in-house client teams. Depending on the project, agency staff may work onsite with the client, from the agency offices, or virtually from any location.

Copywriting agencies may be designed on an employee model, with full- or part-time employees providing services to clients. Others may work with a regular team of trusted contractors, while still others function more like middlemen, connecting clients and editorial freelancers and taking a cut of the proceeds from each project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://careercenter.aaaa.org/jobs/5402501/copywriter|title=Copywriter|publisher=AAAA Career Center|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business and nonprofit clients often hire copywriting agencies for larger projects that fall outside of existing skills and time or staffing needs, or for projects that require expertise in a specific discipline or area of knowledge. Many agencies specialize in one or more industries—doing work for clients, for example, in publishing, finance, technology, biotechnology, medicine, agriculture, the environment, engineering, government, the military, education, the arts, or the nonprofit world. Others employ writers, editors, etc. with varying specialties, so as to work for a variety of clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2007-08-15/how-to-hire-an-ad-agencybusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice|title=How to Hire an Ad Agency|last=McKee|first=Steve|date=15 August 2007|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allowing for overall economic trends, job prospects for both individual copywriters and copywriting agencies expanded during the 1990s and 2000s, for reasons including an increased need for production and editing of online contentand an increase in business outsourcing and freelancing. As of 2012, employment for freelance writers is expected to continue to grow.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1639">'''The fall schedule''' is the [[broadcast programming]] television lineup for the [[List of United States over-the-air television networks|five major American commercial broadcast networks]]. It usually consists of new [[television show]]s paired with returning favorites and runs from September to December, since an altered lineup usually runs from January to May when more new shows ([[midseason replacement]]) premiere.

Historically, the fall television schedule was created to help auto advertisers promote their new car models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Bill|title=Television’s Fall Season Endures|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/24/business/media/television-changes-but-the-fall-season-endures.html?pagewanted=all|website=The New York Times|accessdate=1 October 2014|date=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, several [[television network]]s have staggered new and returning shows without necessarily following a fall and spring schedule. NBC announced in February 2008 that it would follow a "52-week television season," likely with fewer [[television episode]]s per season than the current standard 22.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Tim. "[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/20/DDROV51AG.DTL NBC acknowledges reality with 52-week season.]" ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 20 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Semiotics}}
'''Film semiotics''' is the [[semiotics]] of [[film]]; the study of signs as they pertain to film on a variety of levels.

== Early semioticians of film ==
*  [[Ricciotto Canudo]] – Italian writer working in the 1920s, identified “''language-like character of cinema''”.&lt;ref name="Stam"&gt;Stam, R., Burgoyne, R., &amp; Lewis, S. (1992). New vocabularies in film semiotics: structuralism, post-structuralism, and beyond. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Louis Delluc]] – French writer, working in the 1920s, wrote of the ability of film to transcend national language.&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;
* [[Vachel Lindsay]] – referred to film as “''hieroglyphic language''”.&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;
* [[Béla Balázs]] – Hungarian film theorist who wrote about language-like nature of film from the 1920s to the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

== Russian formalism (1910s–1930s) ==

[[Yury Tynyanov]] was a Russian writer and literary critic. [[Boris Eichenbaum]] outlined principles of syntagmatic construction. (see: [[syntagmatic analysis]]) Syntagmatic analysis deals with sequence and structure, as opposed to the paradigm emphasis of [[paradigmatic analysis]]. The cinema, for Eichenbaum, is a “''particular of figurative language,” the stylistics of which would treat filmic “syntax,” the linkage of shots in “phrases” and “sentences.''””  &lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

Eichenbaum and Tynyanov had two different approaches to interpreting the signs of film. ''"Tynyanov spoke of the cinema as offering the visible world in the form of semantic signs engendered by cinematic procedures such as lighting and montage, while Eichenbaum saw film in relation to “inner speech” and “image translations of linguistic tropes.''”" &lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

== Structuralism and post-structuralism (1950s–present) ==
The film-language concept was explored more deeply in the 1960s when [[post-structuralist]] thinkers started to criticize [[structuralism]]. Also, semiotics became popular in academia. Early work in this field dealt with “''contrasting arbitrary signs of natural language with the motivated, iconic signs of the cinema''”.&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

* [[Umberto Eco]] – Italian novelist and semiotician
* [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] – Italian director and writer
* [[Christian Metz (critic)|Christian Metz]] – French film theorist
* [[Roland Barthes]] – French literary theorist

== Concepts ==
'''Denotation and connotation'''

Film communicates meaning denotatively and connotatively. What the audience sees and hears is denotative, it is what it is and they don’t have to strive to recognize it.  At the same time these sounds and images are connotative and the way the scene is shot is meant to evoke certain feelings from the viewer.  Connotation typically involves emotional overtones, objective interpretation, social values, and ideological assumptions.  According to Christian Metz, “The study of connotation brings us closer to the notion of the cinema as an art (the “seventh art”).” &lt;ref name="Metz"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Metz|first1=Christian|title=Film language: A semiotics of the cinema|date=1974|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within connotations, paradigmatic connotations exist, which would be a shot that is being compared with its unrealized companions in the paradigm. A low angle shot of a rose conveys a sense that the flower is somehow dominant or overpowering because we unconsciously compare it with an overhead shot of a rose which would diminish its importance.  Syntagmatic connotation would not compare the rose shot to other potential shots but compare it with actual shots that precede or follow it. The meaning adheres to it because its compared to other shots we actually see.&lt;ref name="Monaco"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Monaco|first1=James|title=How to read a film: the world of movies, media, and multimedia: language, history, theory.|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Narrative'''

Narrative is generally known as having two components; the story presented and the process of telling it, or narration, often referred to as narrative discourse. Film narrative theory seeks to uncover the apparently “motivated” and “natural” relationship between the signifier and the story-world in order to reveal the deeper system of cultural associations and relationships that are expressed through narrative form.&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt; As Roland Barthes has said, “narrative may be transmitted through oral or written language; through static or moving images, through gestures and through an organized mixture of all these substances. There is narrative in myth, legend, fables, fairytales, novellas, novels, history, novel, epos, tragedy, drama, comedy, pantomime, pictures, comics, events and conversation. In these unlimited forms, narrative exists at all times, in all corners of the earth, in all societies. Narrative begins with the history of mankind.” Films use a combination of dialog, sounds, visual images, gestures and actions to create the narrative. Narrators, usually in a voice-over format, are very popular in documentary film and greatly assist in telling the story while accompanying powerful shots.

'''Tropes'''

Metonymy refers to the ability of a sign to represent something entirely, while literally only being a part of it.  An example of this is the Eiffel Tower, which is a metonym for Paris. Film uses metonyms frequently because they rely on the external to reveal the internal. Another powerful semiotic tool for filmmaking is the use of metaphors, which are defined as a comparison between two things that are unrelated but share some common characteristics. In film, a pair of consecutive shots is metaphorical when there is an implied comparison of the two shots. For instance, a shot of an airplane followed by a shot of a bird flying would be metaphorical, implying that the airplane is (or is like) a bird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=Daniel|title=Semiotics for Beginners|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Important and notable works ==
'''Umberto Eco’s ''Articulations of The Cinematic Code'' (1976)'''

Umberto Eco’s research dealt with the semiology of visual codes using the work of Metz and Pasolini as a starting point. Eco viewed the task of semiology as important and radical. “''Semiology shows us the universe of ideologies, arranged in codes and sub-codes, within the universe of signs, and these ideologies are reflected in our preconstituted ways of using the language.''” &lt;ref name="Eco" /&gt;

Triple articulation codes consist of figures, signs and elements. Eco assumed that the cinematic codes are the only ones using triple articulation. Where current linguistic conventions might use two axes, the paradigmatic and the syntagmatic, the triple articulation can use [[kinesics]] to identify discrete units of time.&lt;ref name="Eco"&gt;Eco, U. (1970). Articulations of the Cinematic Code. Cinematics, 1(1), 590-605.&lt;/ref&gt; Articulations are introduced into a code to communicate the maximum number of combinable elements. Because we normally experience non-articulated and double-articulated codes, running across a code with triple articulation can be overwhelming. “''The contextual wealth of this combination makes the cinema a richer form of communication than speech.''” &lt;ref name="Eco"/&gt;

'''Summary of codes'''&lt;ref name="Eco"/&gt;

1. Perceptive codes

2. Codes of recognition

3. Codes of transmission

4. Tonal codes

5. Iconic codes (figures, signs and semes)

6. Iconographic codes

7. Codes of taste and sensibility

8. Rhetorical codes

9. Stylistic codes

10. Codes of the unconscious

'''Christian Metz’s ''Film Language: A Semiotics of Cinema'' (1974''')

This collection of Metz’s writings on cinematographic problems was informed by insights from [[structural linguistics]].
“''The study of the cinema as an art – the study of cinematographic expressiveness – can therefore be conducted according to methods derived from linguistics...through its procedures of denotation, the cinema is a specific language''” &lt;ref&gt;Metz, C. (1974). Film language; a semiotics of the cinema. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Stam, Robert Burgoyne, and Sandy Flitterman-Lewis’s ''New Vocabularies in Film Semiotics: Structuralism, Post-structuralism, and Beyond'' (1992)'''

This work highlighted film semiotics as a new tool in art criticism. The book provided an overview of previous thinkers and defined terms critical to semiotic film theory. “''This book is intended as a didactic introduction to the vocabulary of the field, not as a series of interventions in film theory''” &lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

'''Part One ''The Origins of Semiotics'''''

Semiotics must be viewed through the broader context of the linguistic nature of contemporary thought.

"''The overarching meta-discipline of semiotics...can be seen as a local manifestation of a more widespread "linguistic turn," an attempt to reconceptualize the world "through" linguistics.''"&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

'''Part Two ''Cine-semiology'''''

Dealt with the cinematic sign, The Grand Syntagmatic, textual systems and analysis, semiotics of filmic sound, language in the cinema.

'''Part Three ''Film-narratology'''''

Taking cues from structuralism and [[Russian Formalism]], film narrative theory attempts to "''designate the basic structures of story processes and to define the aesthetic languages unique to film narrative discourse.''"&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

'''Part Four ''Psychoanalysis'''''

The relationship between human psyche and cinematic representation is explored. "''One of the aims, therefore, of psychoanalytic film theory is a systematic comparison of the cinema as a specific kind of spectacle and the structure of the socially and psychically constituted individual.''"&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

'''Part Five ''From realism to intertextuality'''''

Describes the evolution from an emphasis on realism in the 1950s to the [[intertextuality]] of the 1970s.

'''Wijayatunga Mudalige Harischandra Wijayatunga''' ({{lang-si|විජයතුංග මුදලිගේ හරිශ්චන්ද්‍ර විජයතුංග}}; born 25 October 1931) is a Sri Lankan author, translator, [[lexicographer]], teacher, lawyer and politician. He held various offices in different institutions of the Government of Sri Lanka. At present he is the leader of [[Sinhalaye Mahasammatha Bhoomiputra Pakshaya|Sinhalaye Mahasammatha Bhoomiputra]] Party. During the presidential elections of [[Sri Lankan presidential election, 1994|1994]] and [[Sri Lankan presidential election, 1999|1999]], he was the candidate of that party for this high office.

He is the compiler of the Practical Sinhala Dictionary (1982) and Gunasena Great Sinhala Dictionary, which are considered as the most comprehensive Sinhala-Sinhala dictionaries to date. Besides compiling these voluminous works of over 2000 pages, he also proposed scientific ideas to standardise the [[Sinhala alphabet]].

His political philosophy ''Mahasammatavada'' ('Great Consensus' or comprehensive consultation) envisages consulting all people which he described "as going beyond democracy". He has also appeared for the rights of [[Sinhalese people|Sinhala]] [[Buddhists]] on various fora.

== Early life ==
Harischandra Wijayatunga was born in 1931 at Madamulla in [[Minuwangoda]], Sri Lanka. His father, Wijayatunga Mudalige Don Bastian Wijayatunga, was an [[Ayurvedic]] eye physician, landed proprietor and a planter (coconut and paddy) and his mother was Amarawathie Jayasinghe. Wijayatunga was the fourth in a family of eight siblings.

Wijayatunga received his elementary education at the Government Bilingual School in Minuwangoda. When the [[Nalanda College Colombo]] was relocated to Minuwangoda during the [[World War II]], as a security measure, his parents took the opportunity to shift him to that school. After the War [[Nalanda College Colombo]] was taken back to [[Colombo]], and Wijayatnga continued his studies at [[Nalanda College Colombo]]. Some of Wijayatunga's notable classmates at Nalanda College were [[Karunaratne Abeysekera]], Dr [[Hudson Silva]], Hon. Dr [[Dharmasena Attygalle]], Hon. [[Rupa Karunathilake]], [[Ravindra Rupasena]] and [[Stanley Jayasinghe]].&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.island.lk/2007/12/12/midweek4.html|title=Henry Jayasena ‘A gifted and decent human being….’|accessdate=2014-06-23|year=2007|publisher=island}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.dailynews.lk/2011/12/07/art03.asp|title=In memory of Henry Jayasena|accessdate=2014-06-23|year=2011|publisher=island}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 he entered the [[University of Ceylon]] and in 1955 graduated with a [[bachelor's degree]] in science.

For his thesis "Legal Philosophy in Medieval Sinhale" he was awarded the PhD degree by the [[University of Kelaniya]] in 1990.

== Career ==
Immediately after his University education, Wijayatunga joined the staff of [[Dharmaraja College, Kandy|Dharmaraja College]], Kandy as a science teacher. In addition, he also taught Chemistry at the [[Mahamaya Girls' College, Kandy|Mahamaya Girls' College]], Kandy. It was during this time that he wrote his first book ''Miridiya Jivihu'' (Freshwater Life). In 1956 he was appointed as the Editor of the Science Section of the Sinhala Encyclopaedia, established at the [[University of Peradeniya]].  After some years of service there, he assumed the post of vice-Principal of his former work place, [[Dharmaraja College, Kandy|Dharmaraja College]].

In 1965 he was appointed to the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) which started work in the same year. He was the first and the only member appointed to the staff, functioning as its Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slsi.lk/history.php|title=History of SLSI|accessdate=8 August 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731232632/http://www.slsi.lk/history.php|archivedate=31 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his supervision Divisional Committees on Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Agriculture and Chemicals, and [[Metrication]] of [[Sri Lanka]] were appointed.

The next step he took was to join the [[Sri Lanka Law College]] as a student. He took his oaths as an [[Lawyer|Attorney-at-Law]] in 1973.

He appeared for the accused in the [[1971 JVP Insurrection (Sri Lanka)|1971 insurrection]] before the Criminal Justice Commission. It is also noteworthy that he represented several parties at the Presidential Commission headed by the former Chief Justice Mr. M. C. Sansoni.

Throughout the 1980s he held various offices such as Chief Editor of the [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] ''Sinhala Bauddhya'' (The Sinhala Buddhist), director, Sri Lanka Ayurvedic Drugs Corporation and member of the Directorate of the Siddhayurveda College,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kln.ac.lk/institutes/wickramarachchi/introduction.htm|title=Siddhayurveda College AKA The Gampaha Wickramarachchi Ayurveda Institute|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913173644/http://www.kln.ac.lk/institutes/wickramarachchi/introduction.htm|archivedate=13 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siddhayurveda.lk/|title=Siddhayurveda Rasayanushada Samagama}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gampaha]]. During the years 1984–1990, he was the Editor-in-Chief of the Sinhalese Encyclopaedia as well as the Officer-in-Charge, [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]] version of the Legislative Enactments of Sri Lanka.

== Political career ==
Wijayatunga's political career goes back to his university days. He joined in the popular movement in 1950s to make Sinhala the [[Official Language]] of [[Sri Lanka]], calling into life the "Sinhala Union of the University of Ceylon". During his stay in Kandy he associated himself with the work of [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]]. Realising that none of the two major parties in Sri Lanka would espouse the rights of Sinhala Buddhists, which was uppermost in his mind, he established the [[Sinhalaye Mahasammatha Bhoomiputra Pakshaya]] in 1990 with a group of intellectuals. He became the leader of this party and holds this position to this date.

In the third [[Sri Lankan presidential election, 1994]], he was the candidate of his Party and polled 32,651 votes. Six years later, he contested again in the [[Sri Lankan presidential election, 1999|presidential elections of 1999]], polling 35,854 votes. He also contested in the [[Elections in Sri Lanka|parliamentary elections]] of 2000, 2001 and 2004.

== Personal life ==
Wijayatunga was married to Kalukapuge Karuna Perera (B.A., Dip. Ed., Attorney-at-Law, Notary Public and Commissioner of Oaths) of Kiribathgoda, who died in 2000. Karuna's father, a Kalukapuge Bandaranaike, adopted the surname Perera during British colonial time. One of the descendent of the male lineage of the Kalukapuge Bandaranaike family is the fourth Prime Minister of Ceylon, [[S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike]]. Karuna's both parents were school principals.

Wijayatunga and Karuna are the parents of three sons (Widyasagara, b. 1965, Chakrapani, b. 1967 and Chandrakeerthi, b. 1970) and a daughter (Shyama Kumari, b. 1969). He has travelled widely in many Asian, African and European countries, and was invited to address various groups of learned societies in [[India]], Japan, UK and Australia.

A '''high-angle shot''' is a [[Cinematic techniques|cinematic technique]] where the camera looks down on the subject from a high angle and the point of focus often gets "swallowed up."&lt;ref name="Mamer2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Mamer|title=Film Production Technique: Creating the Accomplished Image|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LsEZBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|date=30 May 2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-285-71256-7|pages=8–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-angle shots can make the subject seem vulnerable or powerless when applied with the correct mood, setting, and effects.&lt;ref name="SijllJennifer2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jennifer Van Sijll|author2=Van Sijll Jennifer|title=Cinematic Storytelling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J1pw5vIH8T0C&amp;pg=PA160|date=1 August 2005|publisher=Michael Wiese Productions|isbn=978-1-61593-002-9|pages=160–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In film, they can make the scene more dramatic. If there is a person at high elevation who is talking to someone below them, this shot is often used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Popular Photography - ND|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HF4zAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA131|date=December 1949|pages=131–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hopi''' (Hopi: {{lang|hop|Hopílavayi}}) is a [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan language]] spoken by the [[Hopi]] people (a [[Puebloan peoples|Puebloan]] group) of northeastern [[Arizona]], United States, but some Hopi are now monolingual [[English language|English]]-speakers.

The use of Hopi has gradually declined over the course of the 20th century. In 1990, it was estimated that more than 5,000 people could speak Hopi as a native language (approximately 75% of the population), but only 40 of them were monolingual in Hopi. The 1998 language survey of 200 Hopi people showed that 100% of Hopi elders (60 years or older) were fluent, but fluency in adults (40–59) was only 84%, 50% in young adults (20–39), and 5% in children (2–19).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Status of Hopi language|url = http://mesamedia.org/Status_of_Hopi_language.html|accessdate = 2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the apparent decline, Hopi and Navajo both are supported by bilingual education programs in Arizona, and children acquire the [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]] as their first language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azednews.com/2014/07/07/dual-language-programs-grow-in-arizona-public-schools/|title=Dual-language programs grow in Arizona public schools|website=azednews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teaching and language revitalization efforts ==

Many Hopi children are being raised in the language. A comprehensive [[Hopi Dictionary: Hopìikwa Lavàytutuveni|Hopi-English dictionary]] edited by [[Emory Sekaquaptewa]] and others has been published, and a group, the Hopi Literacy Project, has focused its attention on promoting the language. As of 2013, "a pilot [[language revitalization]] project, the Hopi Lavayi Nest Model Program, for families with children birth through 5," is being planned for the village of Sipaulovi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In 2004, Mesa Media, a nonprofit organization, was created to help revitalize the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mesamedia.org/about-us/|title=About Us - Mesa Media|website=www.mesamedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language variation ==

[[Benjamin Lee Whorf|Benjamin Whorf]] identifies four varieties ([[dialect]]s) of Hopi:

* ''First Mesa'' (or Whorf's ''Polacca'')
* ''Mishongnovi'' (or Whorf's ''Toreva'')
* ''Shipaulovi'' (or Whorf's ''Sipaulovi'')
* ''Third Mesa'' (or Whorf's ''Oraibi'')

First Mesa is spoken on [[First Mesa, Arizona|First Mesa]] (which is the eastern mesa) in Polacca village in [[Walpi, Arizona|Walpi]] pueblo and in other neighboring communities.&lt;ref&gt;Polacca is at the base of First Mesa, unlike the other villages, which are on the top of the mesa. Polacca is shared by Hopi and Tewa peoples.&lt;/ref&gt; A community of [[Hopi-Tewa|Arizona Tewa]] live on First Mesa, and its members speak [[Tewa language|Tewa]], in addition to a variety of Hopi and English and Spanish.

''Mishongnovi'' is spoken on [[Second Mesa, Arizona|Second Mesa]] (which is the central mesa) in Mishongnovi village. ''Mishongnovi'' has few speakers compared to First and Third Mesa dialects. Shipaulovi is also spoken on Second Mesa in Shipaulovi village, which is close to Mishongnovi village. Whorf notes that other villages on Second Mesa are of unknown dialectal affiliation.

An introductory textbook (Kalectaca 1978) has been written by a ''Shongopavi'' speaker. ''Shongopavi'' is another village on the Second Mesa, but its relation to other dialects has not been analyzed. The Third Mesa dialect is spoken on [[Hotevilla-Bacavi, Arizona|Third Mesa]] (which is the western mesa) at ''Oraibi'' village and in neighboring communities, as well as in [[Moenkopi, Arizona|''Moenkopi'']] village, which lies off Third Mesa and at a distance west of it.

The first published analysis of the Hopi language is [[Benjamin Lee Whorf|Benjamin Whorf]]'s study of Mishongnovi Hopi. His work was based primarily on a single off-reservation [[Informant (linguistics)|informant]], but it was later checked by other reservation speakers. In his study, he states that Mishongnovi is the most archaic and phonemically complex of the dialects. The Third Mesa dialect preserves some older relics that have been lost in Mishongnovi.

Malotki (1983) reports that Third Mesa speakers of younger generations have lost the [[labialization]] feature of ''w'' on the different subject subordinator ''-qw'' after the vowels ''a'', ''i'', ''e'', ''u'' where they have ''-q'' instead. This loss of labialization is also found on the simultaneity marker where younger speakers have ''-kyang'' against older ''-kyangw''. In words with ''kw'' or ''ngw'' in the [[syllable coda]], the labialization is also lost: ''naksu'' (younger) vs. ''nakwsu'' (older) "he started out", ''hikni'' (younger) vs. ''kikwni'' (older) "he will drink", ''tuusungti'' (younger) vs. ''tuusungwti'' (older) "he got frozen".

== Language contact ==
Hopi is part of the [[Pueblo linguistic area]] (a [[Sprachbund]]) along with members of the [[Tanoan languages|Tanoan]] family, the [[Keres language|Keresan languages]], [[Zuni language|Zuni]], and [[Navajo language|Navajo]].

Hopi speakers have traditionally used Hopi as the language of communication with [[Zuni]]. They have also been in close contact with a Tanoan language for over 300 years since the [[Arizona Tewa]], who speak [[Tewa language|Tewa]], moved from the [[Galisteo Basin]] following the [[Pueblo Revolt]] to reside on First Mesa. The Arizona Tewa have traditionally acted as translators for the Hopi-speaking Tewa, Hopi, Navajo, Spanish, and English.

The Hopi had cursory contact with Spanish beginning with the explorers in 1540. In 1629 a small group of [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] missionaries started arriving in Hopi territory, building a church the following year. They remained there until 1680 when the [[Pueblo Revolt]] occurred and the Hopi expelled the Spanish from the region. Both the practices of the Spanish when there, and the stories of negative experiences of Puebloan refugees from the Rio Grande region, contributed to a Hopi attitude where acculturation was resisted or rejected.

A number of studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Dockstader|1955}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Hymes|1956}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Kennard|1963}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Hill|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; have focused on [[loanword]]s borrowed into Hopi from other languages.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===

There are six basic vowels in Hopi:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
! rowspan="2" | 
! colspan="2" | [[Front vowel|Front]]
! colspan="2" | Non-front
|- style="font-size: x-small;"
! [[unrounded]]
! [[Roundedness|rounded]]
! [[unrounded]]
! [[Roundedness|rounded]]
|-
! [[Close vowel|High]]
| ''i'' {{IPAblink|i}}
| 
| ''u'' {{IPAblink|ɨ}}
| 
|-
! [[Close-mid vowel|Mid]]
|  ''e'' {{IPAblink|ɛ}}
| ''ö'' {{IPAblink|ø}}
| 
| ''o'' {{IPAblink|o}}
|-
! [[Open vowel|Low]]
|
| 
| ''a'' {{IPAblink|ä|a}}
| 
|}

The vowel letter {{angbr|ö}} represents a sound that is similar to the vowel {{IPA|[ɛ]}} (as in English ''pet'') but with rounded lips. This sound also occurs, among other languages, in French (''d'''eu'''x'') and German (''sch'''ö'''n'').

The vowel letter {{angbr|u}} represents a sound that is similar the vowel of English ''boot'', but without rounded lips and further forward in the mouth.

=== Consonants ===

Hopi dialects differ in their number of consonants. Below are two separate inventories of the Third Mesa and Mishongnovi dialects. The Third Mesa inventory has orthographic symbols and IPA transcriptions of those symbols when the IPA symbol differs from the orthographic symbol.

As seen above, the Mishongnovi dialect has a larger number of consonants when compared with the Third Mesa dialect. The additional consonants are a series of preaspirated stops and a series of voiceless sonorants.

There is [[idiolect]]al [[free variation]] with the voiced labial fricative represented with {{angbr|v}}, which varies between [[labiodental]] and [[Bilabial consonant|bilabial]] {{IPA|[v ~ β]}}. Before a consonant (word-medially) and at the end of words, it is not voiced although its realization is dependent upon dialect; Third Mesa speakers have {{IPAblink|p}} while Mishongnovi speakers have {{IPAblink|f}}.

The alveolar [[sibilants]] {{IPA|/ts/}} and {{IPA|/s/}} are [[Apical consonant|apical]]. In some Third Mesa speakers, they are palatalized to {{IPA|[tsʲ]}} and {{IPA|[sʲ]}}, which can sound similar to {{IPAslink|tʃ}} and {{IPAslink|ʃ}} of English. In Mishongnovi, {{IPA|/ts/}} is palatalized when at the beginning of syllables and non-palatalized elsewhere.

Hopi has a number of stop contrasts at the velar place of articulation that occur before the low vowel {{IPAslink|a}}. Elsewhere, the contrasts are neutralized. The velar in environments of neutralization is called "neutral" ''k'' by {{Harvcoltxt|Jeanne|1978}}. Before the front vowels {{IPAslink|i}} and {{IPAslink|ɛ}}, it is [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] with a fronted articulation and following palatal glide {{IPA|[j]}}. Thus, {{angbr|ki}} and {{angbr|ke}} are {{IPA|[cji]}} and {{IPA|[cjɛ]}}, respectively. Before the non-front vowels {{IPAslink|ɨ}} and {{IPAslink|o}}, it is a typical velar: {{angbr|ku}} is {{IPA|[kɨ]}} and {{angbr|ko}} is {{IPA|[ko]}}. Before the front rounded vowel {{IPAslink|ø}}, it has a backed articulation: {{angbr|kö}} is {{IPA|[ḵø]}}. Before {{IPAslink|a}}, there is a phonemic contrast with fronted velar with following palatal glide and the backed velar. Complicating this pattern are words borrowed from Spanish that have a velar followed by a low vowel. With the addition of these loanwords, a third velar contrast has been introduced into Hopi. Words with this borrowed velar are "neutral" and typically velar in articulation. Thus, there is a distinction between {{angbr|kya}} {{IPA|[cja]}} and {{angbr|qa}} {{IPA|[ḵa]}} in native words both of which are distinct from {{angbr|ka}} {{IPA|[ka]}} in [[loanword]]s. 

The precise phonetics of these ''k'' consonants is unclear due to vague descriptions in the literature. {{Harvcoltxt|Voegelin|1956}} suggests that the fronted articulation represented by {{angbr|ky}} is distinguished more by presence of the palatal glide than by the difference in the articulatory position of the dorsal contact. He also mentions that the backed sound represented by {{angbr|q}} is "not-so-far-back". This suggests that this sound is post-velar and not quite [[Uvular consonant|uvular]]. {{Harvcoltxt|Malotki|1983}} describes the fronted sound and the sound from Spanish loanwords as palatal while the backed ones are velar. {{Harvcoltxt|Whorf|1946}} describes the fronted form as palatal with palatal glide before some vowels, The form from Spanish loanwords as "ordinary k", and the backed form as velar. Whorf's letter to [[Clyde Kluckhohn]] in {{Harvcoltxt|Kluckhohn|MacLeish|1955}} describes the backed velar as being like Arabic or Nootka {{angbr|q}}, which suggests a uvular articulation. Whorf's phonemicization of Mishongnovi posits the fronted version occurring before all vowels but {{IPAslink|ø}} (with a fronted allophone before {{IPAslink|i}}, {{IPAslink|ɛ}}, and {{IPAslink|a}}); the backed form occurring before non-high vowels ({{IPAslink|ɛ}}, {{IPAslink|ø}}, and {{IPAslink|a}}); and the form from Spanish loanwords before {{IPAslink|a}}.

Similarly to the velar stops, Hopi has a fronted dorsal nasal and a backed dorsal nasal represented as {{angbr|ngy}} and {{angbr|ng}}, respectively. The fronted nasal is palatal {{IPA|[ɲ]}}. The backed nasal is described as velar {{IPA|ŋ}} in Third Mesa speech and thus forms a "neutral" series with "neutral" ''k''. In Mishongnovi speech, Whorf describes the backed nasal as having the more rear articulation of the backed dorsal: {{IPA|[ŋ̱]}}.

The retroflex sound represented with {{angbr|r}} varies between a [[Voiced retroflex fricative|retroflex fricative]] ({{IPAblink|ʐ}}) and a flap {{IPAblink|ɾ}}, although the fricative realization is much more common. In Mishongnovi, this sound is only weakly fricative. In [[syllable]] coda position, it is devoiced to a [[Voiceless retroflex fricative|voiceless fricative]] {{IPAblink|ʂ}}.

The preaspirated stops {{IPA|/ʰp, ʰt, ʰts, ʰkʷ, ʰk, ʰq/}} and voiceless sonorants {{IPA|/m̥, n̥, ŋ̱̊, l̥, ȷ̊, w̥/}} of Mishongnovi only occur in syllable coda position. However, they do contrast with plain stops and voiced sonorants in this position. Whorf notes that the preaspirated stops also contrast with a similar sequence of {{IPA|/h/}} + stop.

== Orthography ==

Hopi is written using the Latin alphabet. The vowel letters correspond to the phonemes of Hopi as follows: {{angbr|a}} {{IPA|/a/}}, {{angbr|e}} {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, {{angbr|i}} {{IPA|/ɪ/}}, {{angbr|o}} {{IPA|/o/}}, {{angbr|u}} {{IPA|/ɨ/}} and {{angbr|ö}} {{IPA|/ø/}}. Long vowels are written double: {{angbr|aa}}, {{angbr|ee}}, {{angbr|ii}}, {{angbr|oo}}, {{angbr|uu}}, {{angbr|öö}}.

Consonants are written: 
*{{angbr|’}} {{IPAslink|ʔ}}
*{{angbr|h}} {{IPAslink|h}}
*{{angbr|k}} {{IPAslink|k}}
*{{angbr|ky}} {{IPA|/kʲ/}}
*{{angbr|kw}} {{IPA|/kʷ/}}
*{{angbr|l}} {{IPAslink|l}}
*{{angbr|m}} {{IPAslink|m}}
*{{angbr|n}} {{IPAslink|n}}
*{{angbr|ng}} {{IPAslink|ŋ}}
*{{angbr|ngw}} {{IPA|/ŋʷ/}}
*{{angbr|ngy}} {{IPAslink|ɲ}}
*{{angbr|p}} {{IPAslink|p}}
*{{angbr|q}} {{IPA|/k̠/}}
*{{angbr|qw}} {{IPA|/k̠ʷ/}}
*{{angbr|r}} {{IPAslink|ʐ}}
*{{angbr|s}} {{IPAslink|s}}
*{{angbr|t}} {{IPAslink|t}}
*{{angbr|ts}} {{IPAslink|ts}}
*{{angbr|v}} {{IPAslink|β}}
*{{angbr|w}} {{IPAslink|w}}
*{{angbr|y}} {{IPAslink|j}}

Falling accent is marked with a grave {{angbr|`}}: ''tsirò'' 'birds'.

To distinguish certain consonants written as [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] from similar looking phonemes meeting across syllable boundaries, a period is used: ''kwaahu'' ('eagle') but ''kuk.wuwàaqe'' ('to follow tracks').

=== Syllable structure ===

The most common syllable clusters are CV and CVC.

The CVCC cluster is very rare due to limited number of CC combinations in the language. This also makes it unusual to find the intrasyllabic clusters C-C and CC-C.

=== Stress ===

The stress pattern in Hopi follows a simple rule that applies to nearly all words.

* In words with one or two vowels, the first vowel is stressed.
* Where there are more than two vowels, the first vowel is stressed if it is long or it is directly followed by two consonants. Otherwise, the second vowel is stressed.

Some exceptions to this rule are ''sikisve'' "car", ''wehekna'' "spill" and ''warikiwta'' ""running". We would expect the second vowel to be stressed but in fact the first one is stressed in these examples.

=== Tone ===

The Third Mesa dialect of Hopi has developed [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] on long vowels, diphthongs, and vowel + sonorant sequences. This dialect has either falling tones or level tones.

The falling tone (high-low) in the Third Mesa dialect corresponds to either a vowel + preaspirated consonant, a vowel + voiceless sonorant, or a vowel + ''h'' sequence in the Second Mesa dialect recorded by Whorf.

== Morphology ==

=== Suffixes ===

Hopi uses suffixes for a variety of purposes. Some examples are:

{| class="wikitable"
|'''suffix'''
|'''purpose'''
|'''example'''
|'''meaning'''
|-
|ma
|go around
| yaktama 
| walking around
|-
|mi
|to, towards
|itamumi
|towards us
|-
|ni
|future
|tuuvani
|will throw
|-
|ngwu
|habitual suffix
|tuuvangwu
|usually throws
|-
|ve/pe
|location
|Ismo'walpe
|at Ismo'wala
|-
|q
|distance suffix
|atkyamiq
|all the way to the bottom
|-
|sa
|only
|suksa
| only one
|}

Hopi also has free postpositions:

{| class="wikitable"
|akw
|with (instrumental)
|-
|angkw
|from
|-
|ep
|at/in/on
|-
|}

Nouns are marked as oblique by either the suffixes ''-t'' for simple nouns or ''-y'' for dual nouns (those referring to exactly two individuals), possessed nouns or plural nouns.

Some examples are shown below:

{| class="wikitable"
|'''nominative'''
|'''oblique'''
|'''meaning'''
|-
|himutski
|himutskit
|shrub
|-
|iisaw
|iisawuy
|coyote
|-
|itam
|itamuy
|we/us
|-
|nuva
|nuvat
|snow
|-
|nu'
|nuy
|I/me
|-
|paahu
|paahut
|spring water
|-
|pam
|put
|he/she/it
|-
|puma
|pumuy
|they
|-
|tuuwa
|tuuwat
|sand
|-
|um
|ung
|you
|}

Verbs are also marked by suffixes but these are not used in a regular pattern. For example, the suffixes ''-lawu'' and ''-ta'' are both used to make a simple verb into a durative one (implying the action is ongoing and not yet complete) but it is hard to predict which suffix applies to which verbs. Second language learners of Hopi usually simply learn this by rote.

There are some gender specific terms in Hopi:

{| class="wikitable"
|'''male speech'''
|'''female speech'''
|'''meaning'''
|-
|a'ni
|hin'ur
|very
|-
|kwakwhay
|askwali
|thank you
|-
|lolma
|nuukyangw
|good
|-
|owi, 'wi
|oo'o, 'wiya
|yes
|}

=== Morphological processes ===

* [[Elision]] - when the stress-shift would cause a clipped vowel not in the first syllable to have a low stress, that vowel is elided.
* [[Lenition]] - initial ''p'' becomes ''v'' when it becomes internal to a word or when the word is preceded by another word used as an adjectival or an incorporated verbal [[Grammatical modifier|modifier]].
* [[Reduplication]] - stem-initial CV, stem-final CV and word-final V are reduplicated.

== Syntax ==
=== Word order ===
The simplest type of sentence in Hopi is simply a subject and a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]: 'Maana wuupa' (the girl is tall).

However, many Hopi sentences also include an object, which is inserted between the subject and the verb. Thus, Hopi is a [[subject–object–verb]] language.

=== Case ===
Nouns are marked as [[subject case|subject]] or [[oblique case|oblique]], as shown above.

Pronouns are also marked as either nominative or oblique. For example, the singular subject pronoun "you" in Hopi is ''um'', and the form for the singular object pronoun is ''ung''.

[[Demonstrative]]s are marked by case in Hopi, shown first in their nominative form and then in their oblique form:

''iˈ''/''it'' - this

''pam''/''put'' - he (closer object)

''miˈ''/''mit'' - to (further object)

''ima''/''imuy'' - these

''puma''/''pumuy'' - they (closer object)

''mima''/''mimuy'' - those (further object)

=== Number ===
Hopi has [[plural verb]]s. [[dual number|Dual]] noun subjects take the dual suffix ''-vit'' but singular verbs. Hopi does not have dual pronouns; instead, the plural pronouns may be used with singular verbs for a dual meaning. Noun and verb plurality is indicated, among other devices, by partial [[reduplication]], marked in the gloss below with a tilde (~).

== Metalinguistics ==
{{main article|Hopi time controversy}}
[[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], a well-known [[linguistics|linguist]] and still one of the foremost authorities on the relationships obtaining between southwestern and Central American languages, used Hopi to exemplify his [[Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis|argument]] that one's worldview is affected by one's language and vice versa. Among Whorf's best-known claims was that Hopi had "no words, grammatical forms, construction or expressions that refer directly to what we call 'time.'"&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, John B. (ed.)(1956). ''Language Thought and Reality: Selected Writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf''. MIT Press, Boston, Massachusetts. {{ISBN|978-0-262-73006-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whorf's statement has been misunderstood {{by whom|date=October 2012}} to mean that Hopi has no concept of duration or succession of time, but in fact, he meant only that the Hopi have no conception of time as an object or a substance that may be divided and subdivided.{{dubious|date=October 2012}} Furthermore, according to John A. Lucy, many of Whorf's critics have failed to read his writings accurately, preferring instead to proffer uncharitable caricatures of his arguments.&lt;ref&gt;Lucy, John (1992).  ''Language Diversity and Thought:  A Reformulation of the Linguistic Relativity Hypothesis''.  Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of temporal concepts in the Hopi language was extensively documented by [[Ekkehart Malotki]],&lt;ref&gt;Malotki, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and other linguists and philosophers are skeptical of Whorf's broader argument and his findings on Hopi have been disputed or rejected by some.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.native-languages.org/iaq7.htm#12 |title=Setting the Record Straight About Native Languages: Language Complexity |publisher=Native Languages of the Americas |accessdate=2007-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hotel Post''' was a service offered by remote [[Swiss]] hotels for the carriage of mail to the nearest official [[post office]].

== Origins ==

In the nineteenth century, [[Switzerland]] developed an important tourist industry. Some hotels in remote areas that were not serviced by the Swiss Post Office offered a service to guests of carrying their mail to the nearest official post office for a fee paid by the purchase of a specially printed stamp. The first hotel stamp was issued by ''Rigi Kaltbad'' in 1864, followed by hotels at ''Rigi Scheideck'', ''Belalp'', ''Kurort Stoos'', ''Maderanerthal'' and ''Rigi Kulm''.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, R.J. ''The Stamp Collector's Encyclopaedia'', Stanley Paul, London, 1966 edition, p.145.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Last usage in Switzerland ==

These services became unnecessary as the Swiss railway was extended and a normal postal service introduced. After 20 September 1883, all remaining services were prohibited by the Swiss government.&lt;ref&gt;"Swiss Hotel Stamps" in ''The Swiss Philatelist'', No.11, 1954, p.3. [http://www.swiss-stamps.us/SP/SP11.pdf Download link.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in other countries ==

Hotels in several other countries have issued stamps including in Austria, Hungary, Egypt (Shepherd's Hotel, Cairo), Japan (The Imperial Hotel, Tokyo), Romania and Singapore (Raffles Hotel). In Hungary stamps were issued at Carpathian resorts for ''Kurhaus auf der Hohen Rinne'' between 1895 and 1926, ''Magura'' in 1903 and 1911, and ''Bistra'' in 1909 to 1912. These resorts were part of Rumania after World War One. In Austria stamps were issued for ''Kesselfall-Alpenhaus'' and ''Moserboden'' between 1927 and 1938 and ''Katschberghohe'' in 1933-38.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, Douglas &amp; Mary, ''The Hodder Stamp Dictionary'', Hodder &amp; Stoughton, London, 1973, p.112.&lt;/ref&gt; Stamps were also issued at a hotel in the Kulmi Mountain region of Liechtenstein.&lt;ref&gt;"Hotel Kulmi Mountain Porterage" in ''The Cinderella Philatelist'', Vol.49, No.2, April 2009, p.69.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==

Hotel stamps are regarded as local or [[cinderella stamps]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3231">The United Nations General Assembly proclaimed 2008 as the '''International Year of Languages''', pursuant to a resolution of [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref name="UN_ARES61266_page4"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-61-266 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=61 |resolution_number=266 |highlight=rect_189,1007_828,1088 |page=4 |accessdate=2008-09-18|date=16 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resolution also reaffirmed the need to achieve full parity among the six official languages on United Nations websites.

==Origination==
The Year was intended to address issues of [[natural language#Linguistic diversity|linguistic diversity]] (in the context of [[cultural diversity]]), respect for all languages, and [[multilingualism]]. The resolution also discussed language issues in the United Nations itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crystalreference.com/DC_articles/Langdeath20.pdf Crystal. David. 2007.

[[UNESCO]] was charged with coordinating observance of the Year, and officially launched it on the occasion of [[International Mother Language Day]], 21 February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080815165332/http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=35559&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO, "Message from Mr Koïchiro Matsuura, Director-General of UNESCO, on the celebration of 2008, International Year of Languages," Date Added: 2007-11-05 9:44 am; Updated: 2007-12-19 2:40 pm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observances==
In addition to official events run by UNESCO, various national, academic and non-governmental organizations sponsored events, websites, and other observances of the IYL. The UNESCO website has a [http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=35835&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html list of projects] submitted by individuals and organizations.

'''Jul''' is a traditional Korean greeting and is oftentimes accompanied by a handshake. Use both hands when handshaking (right arm performing the handshake should be supported by the left arm). Koreans prefer to do business with people who they already know so if it’s possible, try to have a third party to originate the business. Do not introduce yourself and wait until the third party introduces you. In South Korea, it is a common practice to share gifts at the first meeting. It is intended to build relationships and acquire favors. Gift is part of the business culture and it is not considered bribery. When giving or receiving gifts, make sure to use both hands since using one hand is considered rude. However, do not give an expensive gift because gifts are reciprocated. Also present the gift in a modest fashion.

The '''Kannada Wikipedia''' ({{#property:P1448}}) is the [[Kannada|Kannada-language]] edition of [[Wikipedia]]. Started in June 2003, it is moderately active and as of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}, it has {{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|kn|N}} articles with {{NUMBEROF|ACTIVEUSERS|kn|N}} active users.&lt;ref name="tough"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/434752/kannada-wiki-finds-going-tough.html|title=Kannada Wiki finds going tough|last=Kiran Joseph J K V|date=October 7, 2014|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it is the twelfth-most popular Wikipedia in the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name="article5728643"&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/workshops-to-teach-wikipedia-editing/article5728643.ece ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kannada Wikipedia community held a meeting in [[Bangalore]] on April 2, 2006, which got fairly high press coverage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hpnadig.net/files/wikipedia_event_press_coverage.pdf Wikipedia Event Press Coverage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Kannada Wiki 9th Annivesary Cake.JPG|thumb|200px|The cake of 9th anniverasry of Kannada Wikipedia.]]
As of August 16, 2009 the Wiki had about 6,800 articles,&lt;ref&gt;[[:kn:ವಿಶೇಷ:Statistics|Statistics - Wikipedia]] {{kn icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the 100th-biggest Wikipedia edition.

As of January 2013, it has 12,961 articles with 93 active users and 2,680 images, making it the 108th Wikipedia by articles count, at that time.{{uncited|date=November 2017}}

As of January 2016, the Kannada Wikipedia is the tenth-largest and, thus, the smallest Wikipedia among other Indian-language Wikipedias. Administrator Omshivaprakash attributes the lack of articles to a lack of interest among the Kannada-speaking community, a lack of awareness of the Kannada Wikipedia and Kannada typing tools, and limited Internet access in parts of [[Karnataka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/kannada-wikipedia-not-on-top-of-the-charts/article8123183.ece |title=Kannada Wikipedia not on top of the charts |last1=Khajane |first1=Muralidhara |date=19 January 2016 |website=The Hindu |access-date=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Angola}}

The '''languages of Angola''' are predominantly [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], with a small minority of [[!Kung language|!Kung]] and [[Khoe language|Khoe]] speakers. About 39 languages are spoken in [[Angola]].&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt;

==European languages==
Portuguese is the sole [[official language]]. Due to cultural, social and political mechanisms which date back to the colonial history, the number of native Portuguese speakers is large and growing.&lt;ref&gt;During late colonialism, 1962-1975, when all Angolans were considered as Portuguese citizens with equal rights, many black middle class families in the cities refused to teach their children native languages, so that they could compete with the whites, speaking Portuguese the same way.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 study by the Angolan National Institute for Statistics found that Portuguese is the mother tongue of 39% of the population.&lt;ref name=ethno&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/country/AO/languages Angola] Ethnologue&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://poing.me/layar/Colombia/brochuranoCrop.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is spoken as a [[second language]] by many more throughout the country, and younger urban generations are moving towards the dominant or exclusive use of Portuguese. The 2014 population census found that about 71% of the nearly 25.8 million inhabitants of Angola speak Portuguese at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dinheirodigital.sapo.pt/news.asp?id_news=246019|title=População de Angola sobe para mais de 25,7 milhões de pessoas|accessdate=2016-05-26|work=Dinheiro Digital}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jornalf8.net/2016/entre-os-de-primeira-e-os-de-segunda-ja-somos-mais-de-257-milhoes/|title=Entre os de 1ª e os de 2ª já somos mais de 25,7 milhões|accessdate=2016-05-26|work=Folha 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=observa&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://observalinguaportuguesa.org/angola-portugues-e-falado-por-7115-de-angolanos/|title=Angola: português é falado por 71,15% de angolanos|accessdate=2016-03-30|work=Observatório da Língua Portuguesa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Quantos falantes de português existem?|url = http://dicionarioegramatica.com.br/2016/02/21/quantos-falantes-de-portugues-existem/|website = DicionarioeGramatica.com|accessdate = 2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In urban areas, 85% of the population declared to speak Portuguese at home in the 2014 census, against 49% in rural areas.&lt;ref name=observa/&gt; Portuguese was quickly adopted by Angolans in mid-twentieth century as a [[lingua franca]] among the various ethnic groups. After the [[Angolan Civil War]], many people moved to the cities where they learned Portuguese. When they returned to the countryside, more people were speaking Portuguese as a first language. The variant of the Portuguese language used in Angola is known as [[Angolan Portuguese]]. Phonetically, this variant is very similar to the Brazilian variant with some notable exceptions.&lt;ref name="Prophetarum"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://movv.org/2008/09/12/da-situacao-da-lingua-portuguesa-em-angola/ |title=Da situação da língua portuguesa em Angola |website=MOVV.org |author=Clavis Prophetarum  |accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some respects, Angolan Portuguese resembles that of a pidgin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.psu.edu/jml34/angola.pdf Portuguese language in Angola: luso-creoles' missing link?] John M. Lipski&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]], wedged between two French-speaking countries — the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]] and the [[Republic of Congo|Congo]] — many people speak [[French language|French]] as well as, or better than, Portuguese. In fact, of the literate population, 90 percent speak French while 10 percent speak Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/cabinda.htm|title=Cabinda|last=Pike|first=John|website=www.globalsecurity.org|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Angolan [[Bakongo]] who were exiled in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] usually speak better French and Lingala than Portuguese and Kikongo.&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt;

West Africans speak [[english language|English]] or [[French language|French]] and their native African languages and are usually learning at least some Portuguese. The foreign language mostly learned by Angolans is English, but among the [[Bakongo]] (in the Northwest and Cabinda) French is often more important. English will soon be a required subject in Angolan schools. French was previously widely offered as an elective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Angola, Education Ministry Aims to Expand Teaching of English|url=http://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/a-23-2008-04-29-voa2-83138577/117456.html|website=[[Voice of America]]|accessdate=26 October 2016|date=28 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==African languages==
All native languages of Angola are considered to be [[national language]]s. After independence, the government said it would choose six to be developed as [[literary language]]s. The six languages vary between government pronouncements, but commonly included are 
[[Umbundu language|Umbundu]], [[Kimbundu]], [[Kongo language|Kikongo]] (presumably the Fiote of Cabinda), [[Chokwe language|Chokwe]], [[Kwanyama]] (Ovambo), and [[Mbunda language|Mbunda]] (never clearly defined; may be [[Nyemba language|Nyemba]], [[Luchazi language|Luchazi]], or indeterminate).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.embaixadadeangola.org/cultura/linguas/set_lnac.html|title=Serviços Culturais da Embaixada de Angola em Portugal|website=www.embaixadadeangola.org|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noticiasaominuto.com/cultura/303519/harmonizacao-das-linguas-bantu-dificultada-pela-fonetica-e-grafia Angola Harmonização das línguas bantu dificultada pela fonética e grafia]&lt;/ref&gt; Angolan radio transmits in fourteen of the "main" national languages: [[Bangala language (Angola)|Bangala]], [[Cokwe language|Cokwe]], [[Fiote language|Fiote]], [[Herero language|Herero]] ('Helelo'), [[Kikongo]], [[Kimbundu]], [[Kwanyama]], [[Lunda language|Lunda]], [[Ngangela language|Ngangela]], [[Ngoya language|Ngoya]], [[Nyaneka language|Nyaneka]], [[Ovambo language|Ovambo]] ('Oxiwambo'), [[Songo language|Songo]], [[Umbundu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rna.ao/radio-ngola-yetu/ Rádio N’Gola Yetu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151112181401/http://www.rna.ao/radio-ngola-yetu/ |date=2015-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the national languages are used in Angolan schools, including the provision of teaching materials such as books, but there is a shortage of teachers.&lt;ref name=observa/&gt;

Umbundu is the most widely-spoken Bantu language, spoken natively by about 23 percent of the population, about 5.9 million. It is mainly spoken in the center and south of the country.&lt;ref name=observa/&gt; Kimbundu is spoken in [[Luanda Province]] and adjacent provinces. Kikongo is spoken in the northwest, including the exclave of Cabinda.&lt;ref name=ELL&gt;{{ELL2|Angola: Language Situation}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 8.24% of Angolans use Kikongo. Fiote is spoken by about 2.9%, mainly in Cabinda.&lt;ref name=observa/&gt;

The [[San people]] speak languages from two families, the [[!Kung language|!Kung]] and [[Khoe language|Khoe]], though only a few hundred speak the latter. The majority of San fled to South Africa after the end of the civil war. The extinct [[Kwadi language]] may have been distantly related to Khoe, and [[Kwisi language|Kwisi]] is entirely unknown; their speakers were neither Khoisan nor Bantu.&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Brenzinger, 1992. ''Language death: factual and theoretical explorations with special reference to East Africa,'' p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asian languages==
A (very small) number of Angolans of Lebanese descent speak [[Lebanese Arabic|Arabic]] and/or French. Due to increasing [[Angola-China relations]], there is now a [[Chinese language|sinophone]] community of about 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.internationalsteam.co.uk/tales/angolatales01.htm|title=The Benguela Railway 2012, Part 1|website=www.internationalsteam.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[national language]]s of [[Seychelles]] are [[Seychellois Creole]], [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]].

Seychellois Creole, a [[French-based creole language]], is by far the most commonly spoken language in the archipelago and is spoken natively by about 95% of the population. Nevertheless, the country was a [[British Empire|British colony]] for over a century and a half, and the legacy of [[History of Seychelles#British rule|British Seychelles]]) made English remain the main language in government and business.

French was introduced before the British rule. It has remained in use largely because it is used by the [[Franco-Seychellois]] minority and is similar to Seychellois Creole.

'''Law on Use of Languages and Scripts of National Minorities''' ({{lang-hr|Zakon o uporabi jezika i pisma nacionalnih manjina}}) is [[law]] which defines use of [[minority language]]s in [[Croatia]]. Additionally ''[[Croatian Constitutional law on national minorities rights]]'' and ''The Law on Education in language and script of national minorities'' explicitly define rights on usage of minority languages in Croatia.&lt;ref name="SDF-May 2007."&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdf.hr/publikacije/provedba_UZPNM_na_lokalnom_nivou.pdf |title=Provedba Ustavnog zakona o pravima nacionalnih manjina u jedinicama lokalne i područne (regionalne) samouprave|accessdate=6 December 2014 |author=[[Serb Democratic Forum]]|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights==
[[File:Serbian language in municipalities in Croatia.jpg|thumb|[[Serbian language]] as co-official minority language in municipalities in Croatia]]
Local governments to which this law applies ''([[Municipalities of Croatia]] with at least one third of members of ethnic minoritiy or municipality where right is defined by international agreement)'' are required to explicitly prescribe equal official use of minority language or script throughout its territory, regulate in detail realization of those rights and expressly prescribe all particular rights guaranteed by Law on Use of Languages and Scripts of National Minorities.&lt;ref name="Naputak"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istra-istria.hr/fileadmin/dokumenti/upravna_tijela/UO_za_tal_nac_zaj/Instrumenti_zastite_ljudskih_prava/III.Nacionalno-unutarnje_zakonodavstvoRH/3.Akti_Vlade,Ministarstava/III-3.12.Naputak_za_dosljednu_provedbu_Zakona_o_uporabi_jezika_i_pisma_nacionalnih_manjina_u_RH.pdf |title=NAPUTAK ZA DOSLJEDNU PROVEDBU ZAKONA O UPORABI JEZIKA I PISMA NACIONALNIH MANJINA U REPUBLICI HRVATSKOJ|accessdate=6 December 2014 |author=[[Ministry of Public Administration]]|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are required to define these rights in their local [[statute]]s.&lt;ref name="Naputak"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
In April 2015 [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] has urged Croatia to ensure the right of minorities to use their language and alphabet.&lt;ref name="B92-UN"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=03&amp;nav_id=93697 |title=UN calls on Croatia to ensure use of Serbian Cyrillic |format= |author = [[B92]] |date=3 April 2015  |accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Committee report stated that particularly concerns the [[2013 Anti-Cyrillic protests in Croatia|use of Serbian Cyrillic in the town of Vukovar]] and municipalities concerned.&lt;ref name="B92-UN"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was originally devised in 1963, and revised in 1974.  It is a [[faceted classification]], inspired by the work of [[S.R. Ranganathan]] and of the [[Classification Research Group]].

==Main facets==

Foiskett and Foskett observe: "The basic idea of facets is separate grouping of each major division of a subject.".&lt;ref name="LEC" /&gt;  Using the [[British Education Index]] and the [[British National Bibliography]], they divided educational terms into groups that are mutually exclusive.  This forms the foundation of the classification sequence.

|Education, general principles, etc.

|L

|}

In the LEC main facets are indicated by a capital letter, and terms in facets by lower case letters.  Letters are arranged so that vowels and consonants alternate, so that the eventual notation will appear as a syllable.&lt;ref name="LEC" /&gt;  e.g.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indexing Thesaurus==

As originally implemented, the shelf arrangement produced by the classification was supplemented by an indexed card catalogue, where index entries were created for each element in the classmark, in reverse order from the classification.  The example Foskett and Foskett gave was:&lt;ref name="LEC" /&gt;

|}"Each entry refers the reader to the part of the classified section, Rid, where all entries on Secondary modern school are filed.".&lt;ref name="LEC" /&gt;  The 1974 second edition of the scheme was supplemented by [[thesaurus]] cross referencing between narrow terms, broad terms and related terms.&lt;ref name="LEC" /&gt;

'''Luchazi''' (Lucazi, ''Chiluchazi'') is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]] of [[Angola]], Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia and [[Zambia]]. Luchazi is the principal language of the Ngangela Group&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Emil Pearson, "Luchazi Grammar", pp. 5&lt;/ref&gt;. Ngangela is a term coined by the Vimbundu traders and missionaries in 18th century to describe the tribes occupying the area of eastern-central Angola&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Kubik and Moses Yotamu, 1998, "The Luchazi People. Their History and Chieftaincy", pp. 16, 123&lt;/ref&gt;. Ngangela simply means people of the east. Ethnically distinct varieties, many of which are subsumed under the generic term ''Ngangela'', are all "fully [[Mutually intelligible|intelligible]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{e18|nba|Nyemba}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are: Luchazi itself, Nyemba, Mbwela of Angola (Ambuella, ''Shimbwera'', not to be confused with [[Mbwela language (Zambia)|Mbwela of Zambia]]), Nkangala, Mbunda, Luimbi (Lwimbi), Yauma, Songo, Chimbandi&lt;ref&gt;Emil Pearson, "People of the Aurora"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emil Pearson, "Tales of the Aurora"&lt;/ref&gt; and Ngondzela.

The position of the speech-organs in producing the consonants is different from the positions taken in producing the similar sounds in European languages. T and D, for example, are lower than in English but higher than in Portuguese. L is flatter-tongued than in either English or Portuguese. Practically all the consonants have similar differences. The language contains many consonantal glides, including the prenasalized plosives and the voiceless alveolar sibilant affricate (the ts sound).&lt;ref&gt;Emil Pearson, Luchazi Grammar, pp. 5, 6, 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The close front vowel (i), when occurring before another vowel, becomes a [[semi-consonant]] and is written y, unless it is immediately preceded by a consonant, when it remains i. Examples: yange, viange.

The vowels have the so-called Continental or Italian values. They are shorter when unstressed and are prolonged when doubled or when stressed at the end of a word.

* The vowel '''a''' is Long when accented, as ''a'' in ''tata, nana''.
Short when unstressed or before two consonants or ''y'' or ''s'' and in monosyllabic adverbs, as ''a'' in ''tata, paya, asa, hanga''. Prolonged when doubled or stressed at the end of a word or syllable. Example: ''ku laako''.

* The vowel '''e''' is Long when accented, as ''a'' in ''heta, seza''.
Short when unstressed, as ''a'' in ''hete, seze''.
Short with the value of ''e'' in ''henga, lenda'' before two consonants. Exceptions are hembo and membo (due to coalescence of vowels). Many words derived from Portuguese have the short vowel though not followed by two consonants. Examples: ''pena, papelo, luneta, ngehena,'' etc. Prolonged when stressed at the end of a word.

* The vowel '''i''' is Long when accented, as ''e'' in ''tina, sika''.
Short when unstressed or before two consonants, as ''e'' in ''citi, linga''. In monosyllabics it is short, as ''i'' in ''it''. Examples: ni, ndi. Prolonged when stressed. Examples: ti, fui.

* The vowel '''o''' is Long when accented, as ''o'' in ''sota, koka''.
Short when unstressed, as ''o'' in ''soko, loto''.
Short, with value of ''o'' in ''onga, yoya, kosa, luozi, ndo'', before two consonants or y or s, and sometimes before z and in some monosyllables. The o is long in ''zoza'' and ''ngozi''. Sometimes prolonged when stressed at the end of a word. Example: ''to''.

* The vowel '''u''' is Long when accented, as ''u'' in ''tuta, fula''.
Short, when unstressed or before two consonants or before s, as ''u'' in ''futuka, mbunga, kusa''.

== Orthography ==
Luchazi is written using the [[Latin alphabet]], with most characters representing the same sound as in English, with some exceptions. c is pronounced like ''ch'' in ''church'', n followed by k or g is always nasal like ''ng'' in ''ring'', the sound of v is bilabial instead of labiodental.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Euphony&lt;ref&gt;Emil Pearson, Luchazi Grammar, pp. 7: Africa Evangelical Fellowship Publication&lt;/ref&gt; ==
The Luchazi language, for reasons of greater speed in utterance and or economy of effort, has marked combinatory changes, that are harmonious to the ear of the Ngangela people. These changes are of three kinds: (1) coalescence of two vowels into one, (2) elision of a vowel or an entire syllable, and (3) umlaut (vowel mutation).

=== Coalescence&lt;ref&gt;Emil Pearson, Luchazi Grammar, pp. 7: Africa Evangelical Fellowship Publication&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Coalescence occurs when the inseparable pronoun (nominative or objective), or the tense particles ''na'' or ''ka'' precede a verb beginning with a vowel. The preposition ''na'' coalesces with the following pronoun if the latter begins with a vowel, and the negating particle ''ka'' coalesces with the inseparable pronoun of the third person singular. The general rules are:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Coalescence of Vowel !! Example
|-
| ''a'' coalesces with ''a'' forming ''a'' || ''nambe'' (''na ambe'')
|-
| ''a'' coalesces with ''e'' forming ''e'' || ''veca'' (''va eca'')
|-
| ''a'' coalesces with ''i'' forming ''e'' || ''u nemi'' (''u na imi'')
|-
| ''a'' coalesces with ''o'' forming ''o'' || ''voca'' (''va oca'')
|-
| ''a'' coalesces with ''u'' forming ''o''  || ''vi noumu'' (''vi na umu'')
|-
| ''i'' coalesces with ''i'' forming ''i'' || ''ime'' (i ime)
|-
| ''u'' coalesces with ''u'' forming ''u'' || ''ume'' (''u ume'')
|}

Some VaLuchazi tend to coalesce ''k'' and ''i'' forming ''c'', as ''landacana'' for ''landakiana''.

=== Elision&lt;ref&gt;Emil Pearson, Luchazi Grammar, pp. 7: Africa Evangelical Fellowship Publication&lt;/ref&gt; ===
A number of nouns beginning with ''li'' drop this prefix when preceded by the locatives ''ha, ku'' or ''mu''. Examples: ''hembo'' (''ha limbo''), ''kuihia'' (''ku lihia''), ''muzimo'' (''mu lizimo''), ''muilu'' (''mu lilu''), etc. Some nouns, which originally had the prefix ''li'', have lost it, but it reappears in the alliterative concord. Examples: ''sisa liange'' (originally ''lisisa liange'').

* ''i'' before a vowel is elided after ''c'' and also after ''j'' in the personal pronoun ''Nji''. Examples: ''cana'' (''ciana''), ''cu'' (''ci u''), ''ca'' (''ci a''), ''njamba'' (''Nji amba''), ''nju hasa'' (''Nji u hasa''), etc.

The personal pronoun, third person singular, is elided before the tense particle ''na'', but if the indicative pronoun precedes it, it reoccurs. Examples: ''na handeka'', but, ''vi a na handeka''.

* ''m'' before ''b'' as in ''mbuatama'', ''m'' before ''p'' as in ''mpano'', ''n'' before ''g'' as in ''ngandalo'', and ''n'' before ''t'' as in ''ntiengu'', are scarcely audible when not immediately preceded by a vowel, but are to be distinctly heard in the body of a sentence.

Coalescence and elision are also very common in the case of the personal possessive pronouns and certain nouns expressing relationships. Examples: ''tatetu'' (''tata yetu''), ''sukuluange'' (''sukulu yange''), ''kukueni'' (''kuku yeni''), ''muanetu'' (''muana uetu''), yaliange (''yala yange''), ''mpanjenu'' (''mpanji yenu''), etc. The copula is always suppressed after the noun ''muana'', and often after ''muntu''. Examples: ''muana mpanga'' (''muana ua mpanga''), ''Muntu cilema'' (''Muntu ua cilema''), etc.

=== Umlaut&lt;ref&gt;Emil Pearson, Luchazi Grammar, pp. 8: Africa Evangelical Fellowship Publication&lt;/ref&gt; ===
The change of a root vowel sound by the influence of a vowel in a following syllable is noted when the negative particle ''ka'' precedes the inseparable pronoun ''u'', when the preposition ''na'' precedes a pronoun beginning with ''u'', and when the copulative particle is followed by a pronoun beginning with ''u'', etc. Examples: ''ko u hasa'' (''ka u hasa''), ''no uze'' (''na uze''), ''no ukeuo'' (''na ukeuo''), ''ndoho yo uze'' (''ndoho ya uze''), ''yo u keze'' (''ya u keze''), etc.

== Accent&lt;ref&gt;Emil Pearson, Luchazi Grammar, pp. 8: Africa Evangelical Fellowship Publication&lt;/ref&gt; ==
In most European languages stress is the chief element in accent and the elementary and secondary are the only ones usually indicated, and stress is therefore often made a synonym for accent. But in the treatment of the Luchazi language such usage is not sufficient. There are two kinds of accent:

=== Stress Accent (''Emphatic or Dynamic'')&lt;ref&gt;Emil Pearson, Luchazi Grammar, pp. 8: Africa Evangelical Fellowship Publication&lt;/ref&gt; ===
The stress regularly falls upon the penultimate (next to the last) syllable, except in some foreign words. As a rule, the addition of a suffix causes the accent to move forward to the new penult. This is called rhythmic stress as compared with the former, which is called etymological stress. However, the addition of the locative and other enclitic suffixes does not change the stress except in the negative conjugation. In the latter the addition of the enclitics causes the stress to move to the preceding syllable. Example: ''Nja vuíleko — ka nja vuiléko''. In the case of monosyllabic verbs the accent falls upon the preceding monosyllable. Example: ''U ye''. The monosyllabic adverbs always receive the accent. Example: ''Ci vuka tó''.

=== Semantic Tone, Intonation, Pitch, Musical Chromatic Accent&lt;ref&gt;Emil Pearson, Luchazi Grammar, pp. 9: Africa Evangelical Fellowship Publication&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Semantic tone is a very important feature of the Luchazi language as it serves to distinguish homographs and tenses. Examples: ''kanda'', not yet; ku ''kanda'', to forbid; ''ku kanda'', to dig up peanuts (groundnuts); ''nja tava'', I assented (in the indefinite past); ''nja tava'', I assented (just now); ''nja ku panga'', I have worked habitually (past tense of frequentative mood); ''nja ku panga'', I shall work (immediate future tense of indicative mood).

Sometimes the stress accent and the musical accent fall on the same syllable but very often they are separated. When a strong musical  accent falls on the antepenultima or preantepenultima, a weak musical accent usually falls on the ultima. Perhaps in time the scale of tone or pitch may be worked out so as to permit a scientific marking of its quality. If we take the homographs ''ku vumbika'' (to bury rubbish) and ''ku vumbika'' (to show honour or grace to), as examples, calling the united stress and musical accents of the first homograph "1" (as being the strongest), then in the second homograph the stress accent will be lower or "2", the strongest musical accent will be "3", the weak musical accent of the ultima will be "4" and the unaccented antepenultima will be "5".

One cannot overemphasize the importance of acquiring correct accentuation. Some words are highly accented, and as ''vuzaluke'' (madness) and ''ntsenkulu'' (ancient times); while others seem almost devoid of tone quality, as ''pandakanenuko'' (add to it) and ''vusikumukilo'' (descent).

The last syllable of verbs in the singular of the imperative mode is often accented, and so is the final syllable of demonstrative pronouns when the speaker wishes to indicate the more or less exact location of the object referred to. This is usually accompanied with a raising of the head and a pointing with the lips. Examples: ''panga'', ''linga'', ''kuze'', ''cize''.

For emphasis the final syllable of a verb may be changed to ''e'' and accented strongly, the tone being prolonged, as ''Tua pangele pange'' (We worked a very long time). In calling to someone the voice is raised on the last syllable. Often ''e'' is substituted for the final syllable or added to it. If the distance be great, ''ho'' is added (the voice being dropped on ''ho'').

== Grammar&lt;ref&gt;Emil Pearson, Luchazi Grammar, pp.10: Africa Evangelical Fellowship Publication&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Axel Fleisch, Lucazi grammar: a morphosemantic analysis, pp. 53: Köln: Rüdiger Köppe, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; ==
=== The Noun&lt;ref&gt;Emil Pearson, Luchazi Grammar, pp. 10: Africa Evangelical Fellowship Publication&lt;/ref&gt; ===
The nouns are inflected by means of prefixes to show number or state. The noun consists of two parts: the root (or stem) and the prefix. There are eight main classes of nouns distinguished from one another by their singular and plural prefixes. This classification of nouns is an arbitrary division. Since classes 3, 4 and 5 take the same plural prefix in most cases, they might be looked upon as one class. Or, classes 4, 5 and 7 might be split up into six classes instead of three.  Most nouns belonging to the eight classes and their subclasses have both singular and plural prefixes, but there are many nouns that have only the singular and others that have only the plural.

|}

* Class 1 (''mu- va''): this is called the Personal Class because nouns referring to persons belong to it. But in the Luchazi all animate beings take the pronouns and often the alliterative concord of this class, so it might be called the Animate Class. Even some inanimate and abstract things, which in the native mind have taken on transcending importance, belong to it, as ''Ndonga, tuhia, tulo'' and ''tusina''. 

* Class 2 (''mu- mi''): This might be called the Vegetable Kingdom Class, as most words for plants belong to it.

* Class 3 (''vu- ma''): Most abstract nouns belong to this class and usually have no plural. Words may be made abstract by substituting ''vu-'' for the regular prefix, as ''mukuendze'' (young man), ''vukuendze'' (young manhood).

* Class 4 (''li- ma''): The singular prefix ''li'' may be prefixed to other roots to give augmentative meaning, as ''vuta'' (gun), ''lita'' (large gun or cannon). ''ma-'' prefixed to another noun or root gives the meaning of great size or quantity. Words like ''tanga'' and ''sisa'' have lost their singular prefix but retain the pronoun and alliterative concord.

* Class 5 (''lu- ma'') and (''zi-''): This is one of the most irregular of classes. There are several nouns that take both plurals, as ''lungano'' plural ''mangano'' or ''zingano''. There are other nouns which retain their singular prefix in the plural and the plural prefix is added to it, as ''lumana-'' plural ''malumana''; ''lupula-'' plural ''malupula; luindza-'' plural ''maluindza'' but, ''lusiho-'' plural ''masiho'' or ''malusiho''.

* Class 6 (''ci- vi''): This is one of the largest classes and next to Class 1 is the most important. It has been called the Thing Class, as the names of most the common articles belong to it. It also contains about a hundred words referring to persons and another hundred referring to animals, but these have been formed into a subclass of Class 1. There are more than a hundred abstract nouns in this class which are not usually used in the plural, as ''cilemo'' (love), ''cizindo'' (hate), etc. ''ci-'' and ''vi-'' may also be prefixed to other nouns to show contempt in the same manner as ''lu-''.

* Class 7 (lost)- (''zi-'' or ''vi-''): As there is usually no prefix in the singular this has been called the Lost Prefix Class. a few words like ''inca'' and ''intso'' have retained the prefix ''i'', and in the Nyemba language this prefix is common. Subclasses C and D under Class 1 may have belonged to this class originally as they still use its prefix with the possessive pronoun. A few words take the plural prefix ''vi-'' but this may be due to contact with the VaMbunda who use ''vi-'' altogether.

* Class 8 (''ka- tu''): This is the Diminutive Class. Words may be made diminutive by substituting ''ka-'' for the regular prefix or prefixing it to the regular prefix. Examples: ''lilonga'' (plate), ''kalilonga'' (small plate). ''ka-'' is also depreciative, as ''kafueto'' (poor pay or little pay). ''tu-'' must always be used when a plural prefix is retained. Examples: ''tumema'' (a little water), ''tuvantsi'' (a few fish).

In addition to the eight main classes and the subclasses there are the locative classes and the verbal noun class. These may be simple or be complex compounds as to structure.
* '''verbal Nouns''' The verbal nouns take the pronouns and the alliterative concord of the ''ci'' class. Example: ''ku-tsa ceni ci li ku hiehi'' (his death is near).

* '''The locative Class''': They are based upon the three prepositions ''ha, ku'' and ''mu''. ''Ha'' has reference to time or place and means "at, on, when, by, through or upon." ''Ku'' usually indicates motion to, from or at. ''Mu'' denotes position, usually interior position, as "in, within, to or from within."

There are many subclasses and these are classified according to their alliterative concord, but even in this there is a lack of homogeneity, as a number of these nouns will take two sets of harmonic particles, using one set with the possessive pronouns and another set with other modifiers. The leading subclasses are:

==== The Inseparable Pronoun&lt;ref&gt;Emil Pearson, Luchazi Grammar, p. 20: Africa Evangelical Fellowship Publication&lt;/ref&gt; ====
It is always used as the immediate subject of a verb and is never omitted except in the imperative mode. It may be used with the verb understood, viz ''Nji muntu'' (I am a person/human). The objective form of the pronoun is used in the accusative and also in the dative when no preposition is used. In the following table, of the three forms of the pronoun shown in the Nominative case, the first is the one used with most tenses whether past, present or future; the second is used with some past tenses, some present and future; the third is used in the habitual mood and the conditional.

==== The Positive Indicative Pronoun&lt;ref&gt;Emil Pearson, Luchazi Grammar, p. 21: Africa Evangelical Fellowship Publication&lt;/ref&gt; ====
It is conjunctive since it connects a clause to its antecedent. It is demonstrative in that its main force seems to be to point out or emphasize its antecedent.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Class !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| 1 || i, ya || va

|-
| Verbal Noun || ci, ca || -
|-
| Locatives || ha || -
|-
| Locatives || ku, kua || -
|-
| Locatives || mu, mua || -
|}

The pronoun of Class 1 may be used for all persons. As to whether you should use the simpler form (''i, u, vu, li'') or the form with ''-a'' (''ya, ua, vua, lia''), depends on the speaker.

==== The Negative Indicative Pronoun&lt;ref&gt;Emil Pearson, Luchazi Grammar, p. 22: Africa Evangelical Fellowship Publication&lt;/ref&gt; ====
It is often followed by the interrogative pronouns ''iya'' (who) or ''-ka'' (which, what) with the prefix of the class referred to. With the preposition ''nga'', the negative indicative pronoun forms ''ants'' etc., which is used in conditional verbal construction.

==== The Enclitic Pronoun&lt;ref&gt;Emil Pearson, Luchazi Grammar, p. 23: Africa Evangelical Fellowship Publication&lt;/ref&gt; ====
It is made up of the indicative pronoun plus the particle ''o'', except in the singular of Class 1, which is irregular.

| 1 || -ye || -vo
|-

|-
| Verbal Noun || -co || -
|-
| Locative || -ho || -
|-
| Locative || -kuo, -ko || -
|-

|}

There is a general enclitic ''-ndzo'', which may be suffixed to nouns, verbs, pronouns, adverbs, etc., to give the meaning of "then" with strong emphasis. Examples: ''angendzo'', ''vikandzo.''

==== The Possessive Pronoun&lt;ref&gt;Emil Pearson, Luchazi Grammar, p. 24: Africa Evangelical Fellowship Publication&lt;/ref&gt; ====
The rule is: the enclitic pronoun of the possessor follows the copula of the thing possessed. ''-ange'' (singular) ''-etu'' (plural), ''-ove'' (singular) ''-enu'' (plural), ''-eni'' (singular) ''-avo'' (plural). For the remaining classes the possessive is the same as the enclitic.

==== The Intensive or Emphatic Pronoun&lt;ref&gt;Emil Pearson, Luchazi Grammar, p. 25: Africa Evangelical Fellowship Publication&lt;/ref&gt; ====
It consists of the indicative pronoun plus the constant ''vene''. This pronoun is also used with a noun or the enclitic pronoun to show possession, as ''ivenevio, vaveneneco, ivene, vavene''. An ''a'' is often added to the stem when it shows possession, as ''ivenea, vaveneaco,''

==== The Reflexive and Reciprocal Prefix ''li'' ====
Li is not a pronoun but a particle prefixed to verbs to give them a reflexive or reciprocal meaning.

==== The Relative Pronoun&lt;ref&gt;Emil Pearson, Luchazi Grammar, pp. 26: Africa Evangelical Fellowship Publication&lt;/ref&gt; ====
The Pronoun is ''mukua'' (Plural ''vakua''), some grammarians consider it a demonstrative pronoun.

==== The Interrogative Pronoun&lt;ref&gt;Emil Pearson, Luchazi Grammar, pp. 26: Africa Evangelical Fellowship Publication&lt;/ref&gt; ====
The interrogative pronouns, who, which, and what, are rendered by ''iya'' (plural ''veya'') and ''vika''. Others are ''lika, muka, ueya, vueya''.

==== The indefinite Pronoun&lt;ref&gt;Emil Pearson, Luchazi Grammar, pp. 26: Africa Evangelical Fellowship Publication&lt;/ref&gt; ====
The indefinite pronoun include ''vose, uose, viose, vamo, umosi, nkala, ku, uahi, viahi, cipue''

==== The Demonstrative Pronoun&lt;ref&gt;Emil Pearson, Luchazi Grammar, pp. 28: Africa Evangelical Fellowship Publication&lt;/ref&gt; ====
There are four groups of simple demonstrative pronoun with their corresponding plural.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Class !! Group 1 - Singular !! Group 2 - Singular !! Group 3 - Singular !! Group 4 - Singular !! Group 1 - Plural !! Group 2 - Plural !! Group 3 - Plural !! Group 4 - Plural
|-
| 1 || uno || ou || ouo, oo || uze || vano || ava || ovo || vaze
|-
| 2 || uno || ou || ouo || uze || ino || eyi || oyo || ize
|-

|-
| 6 || cino || eci || oco || cize || vino || evi || ovio || vize
|-
| 7 || ino || eyi || oyo || ize || zino || ezi || ozio || zize
|-
| 7 ||  ||  ||  ||  || vino || evi || ovio || vize
|-
| 8 || kano || aka || oko || kaze || tuno || otu || otuo || tuze
|-
| Verbal noun || cino || eci || oco || kaze ||  ||  ||  || 
|-
| Locative || hano || aha || oho || haze ||  ||  ||  || 
|-
| Locative || kuno || oku || okuo, oko || kuze ||  ||  ||  || 
|-
| Locative || muno || omu || omuo, omo || muze ||  ||  ||  || 
|}

As a rule the demonstrative pronoun follows the noun it modifies, as ''cifuti cino, muti ou'', but sometimes for emphasis it is placed before, as ''uno muaka, eli litangua''.

The '''Mao languages''' are a branch of the [[Omotic languages]] spoken in [[Ethiopia]]. The group had the following categories:
*[[Bambassi language|Bambasi]], spoken in the [[Bambasi]] [[woreda]] of [[Benishangul-Gumuz Region]],
*[[Hozo language|Hozo]] and [[Seze language|Seze]] (often described together as 'Begi Mao'), spoken around [[Beica|Begi]] in the [[Mirab Welega Zone|Mirab (West) Welega Zone]] of the [[Oromia Region]], and
*[[Ganza language|Ganza]], which is spoken south of [[Bambasi]] in the [[Asosa Zone]] of Benishangul-Gumuz Region and west of the Hozo and Seze languages.

It is estimated that there are 5,000 speakers of Bambasi, 3,000 speakers each of Hozo and Seze and a few hundred Ganza speakers (Bender, 2000). During recent political upheavals, a few thousand Bambassi speakers established themselves in the valley of the [[Didessa River]] and [[Belo Jegonfoy]] [[woreda]]. Much of the Mirab Welega Zone was once the home of Mao languages, but they have lost speakers because of the increasing influence of [[Oromo language|Oromo]].

'''Myroslav Irchan''' (1897-1937) was born Andriy Babiuk on July 14, 1897 to a poor peasant family in the village of P'yadyky, [[Kolomyia]] in [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast]].  In 1914, he graduated from the Teacher’s Seminary in [[Lviv]].&lt;ref name="encyclopediaofukraine.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5Ci%5Cr%5Circhanmyroslav.htm|title=Irchan, Myroslav – Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a Ukrainian storywriter and playwright who moved for a time from [[Europe]] to [[North America]], and continued to write about his European experiences while in the new world.  He was also editor of a number of publications in [[Europe]] and [[Canada]].

== Ukrainian Civil War ==
The first story he wrote was at the age of 17 entitled ''Meeting'' (Зустріч) using the penname Irchan.  His first collection of sketches and short stories was titled ''Nirvana’s Laughter'' (Сміх Нірвани), a condemnation of war.&lt;ref name="Krawchuk"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

He became a soldier in the [[Ukrainian Sich Riflemen]] and the [[Ukrainian Galician Army]] shortly after the outbreak of [[World War I]]. He fought in three different armies:[[Austro-Hungarian]], Galician, and the Red Army of [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="Krawchuk"&gt;Krawchuk, Peter,  The Unforgettable Myroslav Irchan. Translated by Mary Skrypnyk. Kobzar Publishing Company Ltd. , Edmonton, Alberta 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}}  When he ended up in the ranks of the Red Ukrainian Galician Army,&lt;ref name="encyclopediaofukraine.com"/&gt;  he edited its periodical ''Red Archer'' (Червоний Стрелец).  He wrote two plays about the [[Ukrainian War of Independence|Ukrainian Civil War]] in the middle of the war.&lt;ref name="Balan, Jars"&gt;Balan, Jars. The Ukrainian Canadian stage, in ''Slavic Drama''. University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada 1991, page 228.&lt;/ref&gt;  
The first of these plays was ''The Rebel'' (Бунтар), begun in the [[Polish–Soviet War]] in April 1920, and completed January 12, 1921 in [[Uman]].  It received 26 performances in eight months throughout [[Kiev Oblast]] and [[Podolia]].  Printed by Kultura publishers in 1922, 3,000 of its 10,000 copies were distributed in [[North America]].  It is set in a Galician city early in 1920, as the Red Army offensive against [[Poland]] was stalling, and tells of a failed insurrection organized by pro-Soviet Ukrainian activists in the workers movement.&lt;ref name="Balan, Jars"/&gt;

==Married Life==
Following the end of the civil war, Irchan settled in [[Kiev]] where he met and married his wife Zdenka.  She was the daughter of a Czech doctor, and when her parents returned to [[Prague]] in 1922, the young couple followed them.  In Prague, Irchan enrolled at [[Charles University]] and participated in Ukrainian student activities.  He was well known as a writer by this time, and continued to publish articles and stories, some of which were printed in North America.&lt;ref name="Krawchuk"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

==Canada==
In 1923, Irchan was invited to come to [[Canada]] through ULTA ([[Association of United Ukrainian Canadians|Ukrainian Labour Temple Association]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Martynowych, Orest T. |title=The Ukrainian Labour Temple Association (ULTA) |url=https://umanitoba.ca/faculties/arts/departments/ukrainian_canadian_studies/media/16_The_Ukrainian_Labour_Temple_Association.pdf|publisher=[[Centre for Ukrainian Canadian Studies]] at the [[University of Manitoba]] |access-date=July 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to edit their journal ''Working Woman'' (Робітниця), to which he had already contributed articles.  At this time Canadian Immigration only accepted immigrants as labourers, so he and his wife were invited to come to Canada by a Canadian farmer, in Gonor, [[Manitoba]], where they lived for a time and he continued his literary activities.&lt;ref name="Krawchuk"/&gt;{{rp|10}}

==Drama==
In Canada, he was to experience the most creative literary period of his life, as editor, poet, storywriter, and playwright.

The first play he wrote in Canada was ''The Family of Brushmakers'' (Родина щіткарів).  In all cases where the drama of the doubting and confused mind is Irchan's interest, his work takes on a rich texture and offers many possible readings and many complex interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/arts/departments/german_and_slavic/media/The_Rape_of_Civilization_Recurrent_Structure_in_Myroslav_Irchan.s_Prose.pdf |title= Shkandrii, Myroslav. The Rape of Civilization.|access-date=July 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   ''The Family of Brushmakers'', in four acts, written between 1923–24, tells the story of a family of four people – three of whom at the outset of the play are blind. Only the son can see.  In Irchan’s own words, “In 1915, while I was lying ill in a German hospital in the Austrian capital [[Vienna]], I read in a German newspaper a story in a small corner of its last page that a blind brushmaker and musician living in [[Germany]] had a blind wife and daughter.  His only son, who had vision, was conscripted into the German army.  In time, the son returned home, but to the glory of the [[Kaiser]] and the great German Empire, he had given up his eyesight.  He had lost it during a poisonous attack at the front.  So the only member of the family with sight, the son, was now blind in a blind family.” &lt;ref name="Krawchuk"/&gt;{{rp|84}}  The play was a great success, staged 74 times from Montreal to Vancouver, and even the English Press had something to say about this “dangerous production”.

[[File: A Family of Brushmakers.jpg|thumb|250 px|upright|Myroslav Irchan (seated), as the son, in his play ''A Family of Brushmakers'']]

==Departure==
The reasons for his departure from Canada are manifold.  First, his wife Zdenka who was in poor health, with their daughter, Maya, returned to her parents in Prague. Secondly, the organizational activities which entangled him more and more with ULTA in [[Winnipeg]] left him little opportunity to develop as a writer.  Finally, some of the membership of ULTA may have encountered problems with his work, possibly finding it too much that of the expression of an individual rather than of their organization.  Whatever the reasons, on May 22, 1929, he left Winnipeg on his journey back to Europe.&lt;ref name="Krawchuk"/&gt;{{rp|55}}

==Tragic Fate==
Irchan returned to Ukraine at a time when [[Stalin]]’s repression of artists, academics, and gifted individuals in all fields was intensifying.

Irchan moved to [[Kharkiv]], at that time the capital of Soviet Ukraine.  The city had writers’ organizations and publishers, and he had friends here in the writing community.  In 1934, he was one of many writers arrested by the State Political Administration.  His wife and daughter joined him in [[Omsk]], [[Siberia]], though it is unclear whether Zdenka did this voluntarily.  In a letter she wrote to a friend in Winnipeg, she says, “Please do not send me anymore newspapers, and notify New York to do the same thing, because they are causing me unpleasantness.  Some day I will write more.  Greetings to all.  Zdenka.” &lt;ref name="Krawchuk"/&gt;{{rp|63}}   But nothing more was heard.

Thirty-four years after Irchan’s official [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitation]] in the Soviet Union, which was the result of Khrushchev’s report revealing the criminal activity under Stalin’s direction, the detail of Irchan’s fate was made public. Irchan was interrogated by [[Pavel Postyshev]] who is considered to be one of the principal architects of the famine of 1932–1933, known in Ukraine as [[Holodomor]].  Irchan was accused of “belonging” to the nationalist Ukrainian counter-revolutionary organization, which worked to overthrow Soviet rule in Ukraine by military means.  It now seems he was shot with so many other Ukrainian intellectuals on 3 November 1937 at [[Sandarmokh]] in Karelia.&lt;ref name="Krawchuk"/&gt;{{rp|65}}

The '''Nambikwaran languages''' are a [[language family]] of half a dozen languages, all spoken in the state of [[Mato Grosso]] in [[Brazil]]. They have traditionally been considered [[dialect]]s of a single language, but at least three of them are mutually unintelligible.

* [[Mamaindê language|Mamaindê]] (350)
* [[Nambikwara language|Nambikwara]] (1200)
* [[Sabanê language|Sabanê]] (60)

The varieties of Mamaindê are often seen as dialects of a single language, but are treated as separate  Northern Nambikwaran languages by ''[[Ethnologue]]''. Sabanê is a single speech community and thus has no dialects, while the [[Nambikwara language]] has been described as having eleven.&lt;ref name="campbell1997"&gt;{{cite book | last = Campbell | first = Lyle | authorlink = Lyle Campbell | year = 1997 | title = American Indian languages: the historical linguistics of Native America | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = [[Oxford]], [[United Kingdom]] | isbn = 0-19-509427-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nativization''' is the process whereby a [[language]] gains [[native speaker]]s.{{sfnp|Sankoff|Laberge|1972}} This happens necessarily where a [[second language]] used by adult parents becomes the [[native language]] of their children. Nativization has been of particular interest to [[linguists]], and to [[creolist]]s more specifically, where the second language concerned is a [[pidgin]].

Several explanations of [[Creole language|creole]] genesis have relied on prior nativization of a pidgin as a stage in achieving creoleness. This is true for [[Robert A. Hall, Jr.|Hall's]] (1966) notion of the pidgin-creole life cycle as well as [[Derek Bickerton|Bickerton]]'s [[The Language Bioprogram theory|language bioprogram theory]].{{sfnp|Hall|1966}}{{sfnp|Bickerton|1984}}

There are few undisputed examples of a creole arising from nativization of a pidgin by children.{{sfnp|Sankoff|Laberge|1972}}{{sfnp|Pfaff|1981}} The [[Tok Pisin]] language reported by {{Harvcoltxt|Sankoff|Laberge|1972}} is one example where such a conclusion could be reached by scientific observation.{{sfnp|Sankoff|Laberge|1972}} A counterexample is the case where children of [[Gastarbeiter]] parents speaking pidgin German acquired German seamlessly without creolization.{{sfnp|Pfaff|1981}} Broad treatments of [[creolization]] phenomena such as {{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995}} acknowledge now as a matter of standard that the pidgin-nativization scheme is only one of many explanations with possible theoretical validity.{{sfnp|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995}}

A '''''nouveau''''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|n|u:|ˈ|v|oʊ}} {{IPA-fr|nuvo}}), or ''vin (de) primeur'', is a [[French wine]] which may, under the ''[[Appellation d'origine contrôlée]]'' (AOC) regulations, be sold in the [[vintage|same year]] in which it was [[harvested (wine)|harvested]]. The most widely exported ''nouveau'' wine is [[Beaujolais nouveau|Beaujolais ''nouveau'']] which is released on the third Thursday of November, often only a few weeks after the grapes were harvested. ''Nouveau'' wines are often [[body (wine)|light bodied]] and paler in color due to the very short (or nonexistent) [[maceration (wine)|maceration]] period followed by a similarly short [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]]. The wines will most likely not be exposed to any [[oak (wine)|oak]] or extended aging prior to being released to the market. ''Nouveau'' wines are characteristically fruity and may have some [[residual sugar]]. They are at their peak drinkability within the first year. As of 2005, there were 55 AOCs in France permitted to make ''nouveau'' wines.&lt;ref name="Sotheby pg 56"&gt; T. Stevenson ''"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia"'' pg 56 Dorling Kindersley 2005 {{ISBN|0-7566-1324-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Vins de primeur'' should not be confused with the practice of buying and selling wines ''[[en primeur]]''.

"'''On Denoting'''" is an essay by [[Bertrand Russell]]. It was published in the philosophy journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' in 1905. In it, Russell introduces and advocates his theory of denoting phrases, according to which definite descriptions and other "denoting phrases ... never have any meaning in themselves, but every proposition in whose verbal expression they occur has a meaning."&lt;ref name="Russell 480"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Russell  | first = Bertrand  | authorlink = Bertrand Russell   | coauthors =   | title = On Denoting  | journal = Mind  | volume = 14  | issue = 56  | pages = 479-493  | publisher = Oxford University Press on behalf of the Mind Association | location = Oxford  | date = October 1905  | jstor = 2248381 | issn = 0026-4423}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory later became the basis for Russell's [[descriptivist theory of names|descriptivism]] with regard to proper names, and his view that proper names are "disguised" or "abbreviated" [[definite descriptions]].

In the 1920s, [[Frank P. Ramsey]] referred to the essay as "that paradigm of philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==The "denoting phrase"==

===Russell's concept of a denoting phrase===

For Russell, a denoting phrase is a singular noun phrase, preceded by a [[quantifier (logic)|quantifier]], whose [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] term is satisfied by some particular. Such phrases do not contribute objects as the constituents of the singular propositions in which they occur. Denotation, in other words, is a semantically inert property, in this view. Whereas [[Frege]] held that there were two distinct parts (or aspects) of the meaning of every term, phrase, or sentence (its [[Sense and reference|''Sinn'' and ''Bedeutung'']]), Russell explicitly rejects the notion of sense (''Sinn'') and replaces it with the idea of a [[propositional function]] (i.e., a function from objects to abstract propositions that are the contents of sentences). This is so because, for Russell, propositions must have concrete, really existing entities as their constituents. Russell provides several clear examples of the sort of thing that he had in mind: "a man, any man, every man, the present [[King of France]]... the centre of mass of the [[Solar System]], ...." So, for Russell, a denoting phrase can be either a definite description (i.e., a singular noun phrase with the determinative article "the" at the beginning), which "does not denote anything" (meaning designate any specific object) or a definite description that does denote a specific object or, finally, an indefinite description that denotes "ambiguously". Russell, as will be shown later, believes that definite descriptions are not [[referring expression]]s but rather, to borrow a term later coined by [[Keith Donnellan]], they have "attributive" uses only. They are to be interpreted as strictly logical quantificational formulas that are "general" in nature. At least this has been the general interpretation of Russell among philosophical logicians for nearly a century.

===Reference to something that does not exist===

However, at the very beginning of the article, Russell distinguishes between cases where "a phrase may be denoting and yet not denote anything (e.g. 'the present King of France')" and cases where they may denote "one definite object (such as '[[:Edward VII|the present King of England]]')". If this passage is interpreted as saying that descriptions may "refer" to one definite object, then it could be that Russell actually recognised the two distinct uses of definite descriptions (attributive and referential) that Donnellan later proposed.

=== Epistemology ===

In any case, after clarifying the sense of the term "denoting phrase" and providing several examples to illustrate the idea, Russell explains the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] motivations for his theory. Russell believes at this point that there are essentially two modes of knowing: [[knowledge by description]] and [[Knowledge by acquaintance|knowledge by (direct) acquaintance]]. Knowledge by acquaintance is limited to the sense data of the [[phenomenalism|phenomenal]] world and to one's own private inner experiences, while knowledge of everything else (other minds, physical objects, and so on) can only be known by way of general descriptions.

==The theory of descriptions==

=== Mathematical description ===
Russell starts out by defining the "fundamental" notion of a ''[[propositional function]]''. This is basically a modified version of Frege's idea of ''unsaturated concepts''. Hence, "''C''(''x'') stands for a proposition in which ''x'' is a constituent and where ''x'', the variable, is essentially and wholly undetermined." The notions of ''everything'', ''nothing'' and ''something'' ("the most primitive of denoting phrases") can then be defined as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; C(E) \leftrightarrow \forall x C(x) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; C(N) \leftrightarrow \forall x \lnot C(x) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; C(S) \leftrightarrow \lnot \forall x \lnot C(x) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' stands for everything, ''N'' stands for nothing and ''S'' stands for something. ''All'' is taken as primitive and indefinable and the others are defined in terms of it. Russell emphasises that these notions can have no meaning apart from that which is assigned to them within the propositions in which they occur, all of which are meaningful. This is the foundation of Russell's [[theory of descriptions]] as he proceeds to illustrate.

===Illustration===

The phrase "the [[:Charles I of England|father]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (F) was executed (E)" is interpreted as the following quantificational assertion:

:&lt;math&gt; \exists x \left( \left( F \left( x \right) \land  \forall y \left( F \left( y \right) \rightarrow x=y \right) \right) \land E \left( x \right) \right) &lt;/math&gt;

In other words, there is one and only one thing x such that x is the father of Charles II and x was executed.

So, if C represents any statement at all about the father of Charles II, the statement 'C (the father of Charles II)' always implies:

:&lt;math&gt; \exists x \left( F \left( x \right) \land \forall y \left( F \left( y \right) \rightarrow  x=y \right) \right) &lt;/math&gt;

It follows that if there is not one and only one entity that satisfies the above, then every proposition that contains the descriptions in a primary occurrence is false.  (If the mother of Charles II was ‘unfaithful’ the statement may be false.)  In this way, Russell points out, it will turn out that all statements containing non-referring descriptions (e.g. "The present king of [[Samothrace]] is
a great writer") are false. Russell's theory reduces all propositions that contain definite descriptions into forms that do not.

==Meinong==
He then criticises [[Alexius Meinong|Meinong]]'s theory of objects which, according to Russell, is ontologically promiscuous and self-contradictory. Both of these criticisms stem from Meinong's theory that there is an object, whether it exists or subsists, for every set of properties. Therefore, there is an object that is both round and not round, or round and square. Russell argues that Meinong's theory entails conclusions such as "the present King of France" both exists and does not exist. However, Meinong does not attribute existence (or any other sort of being) to ''non-existent objects''. Russell also accuses Meinong of violating the law of non-contradiction by asserting that the "round square" is both round and not round. Meinong, on the other hand, maintains that the laws of logic do not apply to such phenomena as "impossible" objects that have no being.&lt;ref&gt;Grossmann, Reinhardt. "Alexius Meinong". ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (ed.) Ted Honderich. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resolving the problem of negative existentials==
One of the fundamental puzzles that Russell hopes to resolve with the theory of descriptions is the problem of non-referring expressions or, as they are now called, negative [[Existential clause|existentials]]. He finally explains how his theory resolves this problem after invoking a distinction between what he calls ''primary'' and ''secondary'' occurrences of denoting phrases.

===Statements about concepts where the object does not exist===

Since definite descriptions are just quantificational devices on Russell's view they can enter into scope relations with other logical operators. In the case of negative existentials, there is an ambiguity between two different (primary and secondary) readings of the quantificational assertion. For example, Russell uses the case of "the present King of France is not bald." Here the two possible readings are:

:&lt;math&gt; \exists x (K(x) \land \forall y (K(y) \rightarrow y=x)) \land \lnot B(x)) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \lnot \exists x (K(x) \land \forall y (K(y) \rightarrow y=x)) \land B(x)) &lt;/math&gt;

In the first case, the statement is false because it quantifies over non-existent entities. In the second case, the statement is true because it is not the case that there is a present King of France. "Thus all propositions in which 'the King of France' has a primary occurrence are false: the denials of such propositions are true, but in them 'the King of France' has a secondary occurrence." Contemporarily, it is customary to discuss Russell's primary/secondary distinction in the more logically exact terms of wide and narrow scope. The scope distinction regards the operator that, on one reading, modifies ''only'' the subject, and on the other, modifies the entire sentence.

===Ambiguity===

Russell resolves the problem of ambiguity in propositional attitude reports in a similar manner. He refers to an example similar to Frege's puzzle about identity: "[[:George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] wondered whether [[Walter Scott|Scott]] is the author of ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]''." In this case, it is obvious that King George is not wondering whether Scott is identical to Scott. Russell rejects Frege's solution of distinguishing between sense and reference. Quantificational descriptions are sufficient for him to handle the ''de dicto'' / ''de re'' ambiguities. So, for example, in the general case, the sentence "George IV wondered whether Scott is Sir Walter" can be interpreted as:

:''George IV wondered whether the x that... is identical to the y that....''

where "..." stands for some definite description such as "the clever fellow who wrote Ivanhoe" and ....stands for something like "the elegant gentleman seated next to the Princess". In the ''de re'' case, the above sentence can be interpreted as follows instead:

:''the x that... is such that King George wondered whether x is identical to the y that....''

===Fictional names===

Finally, Russell suggests that fictional names such as "[[Apollo]]" can be treated as abbreviated definite descriptions that refer to nothing. All propositions that contain names of such fictional entities are to be treated in the same manner as the negative existentials described above.

==Criticisms==
In his essay, "On Referring", [[P. F. Strawson]] criticised Russell's characterisation of statements where the object does not exist, such as "the present King of France", as being false. Such statements, Strawson held, are neither true nor false but, rather, absurd. Strawson believed that, contrary to Russell, use does determine the meaning of a sentence. To give the meaning of an expression is to "give general directions for its use."&lt;ref name="Strawson 327"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Strawson  | first = P. F.  | authorlink = P. F. Strawson   | coauthors =   | title = On Referring  | journal = Mind  | volume = 59  | issue = 235  | pages = 327  | publisher = Oxford University Press on behalf of the Mind Association | location = Oxford  | date = July 1950  | jstor = 2251176 | issn = 0026-4423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, Strawson argued that, were someone to say the King of France was wise, we would not say their statement is true or false, but, rather, decide they must be under a misapprehension since, normally, the question would not arise as there is no King of France.&lt;ref name="Strawson 330"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Strawson  | first = P. F.  | authorlink = P. F.

Strawson also argued that we often need to know the use of a word to understand its meaning, such as in statements of the form, "The table is covered with books." In normal use, the expression would be referring to one particular table. It is false, Strawson believed, to think, as Russell, that the phrase will only have meaning insofar as there is only one table and no more. The phrase has application in virtue of the fact that one table and no more is what is being referred to, and it is understood that the table is what is being referenced.&lt;ref name="Strawson 332"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Strawson  | first = P.

The first work to bear the name was [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]'s final completed opera ''[[Acis et Galatée]]'' (1686), although musical works on pastoral themes had already appeared on the French stage. The pastorale héroique usually drew on Classical subject matter associated with [[pastoral poetry]]. Like the [[tragédie en musique]], it had an allegorical prologue; however, its structure consisted of three acts, rather than the five of the tragédie en musique.   Later examples were written by [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]; these include ''[[Zaïs]]'' (1748) and ''[[Naïs]]'' (1749), and ''[[Acante et Céphise]]'' (1751).

'''''Pe̍h-ōe-jī''''' ({{IPA-taiwan|peʔ˩ u̯e˩ d͡ʑi˨|lang|Peh-oe-ji.ogg}}, abbreviated '''POJ''', literally ''vernacular writing'', also known as '''Church Romanization''') is an [[orthography]] used to write variants of [[Southern Min]] Chinese, particularly [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] and [[Amoy dialect|Amoy Hokkien]]. Developed by Western [[missionary|missionaries]] working among the [[Chinese emigration|Chinese diaspora]] in [[Southeast Asia]] in the 19th century and refined by missionaries working in [[Xiamen]] and [[Tainan]], it uses a modified [[Latin alphabet]] and some [[diacritic]]s to represent the spoken language. After initial success in [[Fujian]], POJ became most widespread in [[Taiwan]] and, in the mid-20th century, there were over 100,000 people literate in POJ. A large amount of printed material, religious and secular, has been produced in the script, including [[Taiwan]]'s first newspaper, the ''[[Taiwan Church News]]''.

During [[Taiwan under Japanese rule]] (1895–1945), the use of Pe̍h-ōe-jī was suppressed and it faced further countermeasures during the [[Kuomintang]] [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law period]] (1947–1987). In Fujian, use declined after the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] (1949) and in the early 21st century the system was not in general use there. Taiwanese [[Christian]]s, non-native learners of Southern Min, and native-speaker enthusiasts in Taiwan are among those that continue to use ''Pe̍h-ōe-jī''. Full native computer support was developed in 2004, and users can now call on [[font]]s, [[input method]]s, and extensive online dictionaries. Rival writing systems have evolved, and there is ongoing debate within the Taiwanese mother tongue movement as to which system should be used. Versions of ''pe̍h-ōe-jī'' have been devised for other Chinese varieties, including [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew Southern Min]].

The name ''pe̍h-ōe-jī'' ({{zh|t=白話字|p=Báihuà zì}}) means "vernacular writing", written characters representing everyday spoken language.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=90}} The name ''vernacular writing'' could be applied to many kinds of writing, romanized and character-based, but the term ''pe̍h-ōe-jī'' is commonly restricted to the [[Southern Min]] romanization system developed by [[Presbyterian]] missionaries in the 19th century.{{sfnp|Klöter|2002|p=1}}

The missionaries who invented and refined the system used, instead of the name ''pe̍h-ōe-jī'', various other terms, such as "Romanized [[Xiamen|Amoy]] Vernacular" and "Romanized Amoy Colloquial."{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=90}} The origins of the system and its extensive use in the Christian community have led to it being known by some modern writers as "Church Romanization" ({{zh|t=教會羅馬字|p=Jiàohuì Luōmǎzì|poj=Kàu-hōe Lô-má-jī|labels=no}}) and is often abbreviated in POJ itself to ''Kàu-lô''. ({{zh|t=教羅|p=Jiàoluō|labels=no}}){{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=89}} There is some debate on whether "pe̍h-ōe-jī" or "Church Romanization" is the more appropriate name.

Objections to "pe̍h-ōe-jī" are that it can refer to more than one system and that both [[literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters|literary and colloquial register]] Southern Min appear in the system and so describing it as "vernacular" writing might be inaccurate.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=90}} Objections to "Church Romanization" are that some non-Christians and some secular writing use it.{{sfnp|Chang|2001|p=13}} One commentator observes that POJ "today is largely disassociated from its former religious purposes."{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=248}} The term "romanization" is also disliked by some, who see it as belittling the status of ''pe̍h-ōe-jī'' by identifying it as a supplementary phonetic system instead of a fully-fledged orthography.{{sfnp|Chang|2001|p=13}} Sources disagree on which of the two is more commonly used.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=89}}{{sfnp|Chang|2001|p=13}}

==History==
[[File:Pa-khek-le Kau-hoe.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=POJ inscription|''Pe̍h-ōe-jī'' inscription at a church in [[Tainan]] (Tâi-lâm) commemorating [[Thomas Barclay (missionary)|Thomas Barclay]]]]
The history of Peh-oe-ji has been heavily influenced by official attitudes towards the Southern Min vernaculars and the Christian organizations that propagated it. Early documents point to the purpose of the creation of POJ as being pedagogical in nature, closely allied to educating [[Christianity in China|Christian converts]].{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=92}}

===Early development===
The first people to use a romanized script to write Southern Min were Spanish missionaries in [[Manila]] in the 16th century.{{sfnp|Klöter|2002|p=1}} However, it was used mainly as a teaching aid for Spanish learners of Southern Min, and seems not to have had any influence on the development of ''pe̍h-ōe-jī''.{{sfnp|Klöter|2002|p=2}} In the early 19th century, China was closed to [[Christian missionaries]], who instead proselytized to [[overseas Chinese]] communities in [[South East Asia]].{{sfnp|Heylen|2001|p=139}} The earliest origins of the system are found in a small vocabulary first printed in 1820 by [[Walter Henry Medhurst]],{{sfnp|Heylen|2001|p=142}}{{sfnp|Chang|2001|p=14}} who went on to publish the ''Dictionary of the Hok-këèn Dialect of the Chinese Language, According to the Reading and Colloquial Idioms'' in 1832.{{sfnp|Heylen|2001|p=142}}

This dictionary represents the first major reference work in POJ, although the romanization within was quite different from the modern system, and has been dubbed ''Early Church Romanization'' by one scholar of the subject.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=89}} Medhurst, who was stationed in [[Malacca]], was influenced by [[Robert Morrison (missionary)|Robert Morrison's]] romanization of [[Mandarin Chinese]], but had to innovate in several areas to reflect major differences between Mandarin and Southern Min.{{sfnp|Heylen|2001|p=144}} Several important developments occurred in Medhurst's work, especially the application of consistent tone markings (influenced by contemporary linguistic studies of [[Sanskrit]], which was becoming of more mainstream interest to Western scholars).{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=109}} Medhurst was convinced that accurate representation and reproduction of the tonal structure of Southern Min was vital to comprehension:
{{blockquote|Respecting these tones of the Chinese language, some difference of opinion has been obtained, and while some have considered them of first importance, others have paid them little or no intention. The author inclines decidedly to the former opinion; having found, from uniform experience, that without strict attention to tones, it is impossible for a person to make himself understood in Hok-këèn.|W. H. Medhurst{{sfnp|Medhurst|1832|p=viii}} }}
[[File:Doty frontispiece.png|thumb|alt=Frontispiece of the Anglo Chinese Manual|right|200px|Frontispiece of Doty's ''Anglo Chinese Manual of the Amoy Dialect'' (1853)]]
The system expounded by Medhurst influenced later dictionary compilers with regard to tonal notation and initials, but both his complicated vowel system and his emphasis on the literary register of Southern Min were dropped by later writers.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=110}}{{sfnp|Heylen|2001|p=145}} Following on from Medhurst's work, [[Samuel Wells Williams]] became the chief proponent of major changes in the orthography devised by Morrison and adapted by Medhurst. Through personal communication and letters and articles printed in ''The Chinese Repository'' a consensus was arrived at for the new version of POJ, although Williams' suggestions were largely not followed.{{sfnp|Heylen|2001|p=149}}

The first major work to represent this new orthography was [[Elihu Doty]]'s ''Anglo-Chinese Manual with Romanized Colloquial in the Amoy Dialect'',{{sfnp|Heylen|2001|p=149}} published in 1853. The manual can therefore be regarded as the first presentation of a pre-modern POJ, a significant step onwards from Medhurst's orthography and different from today's system in only a few details.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=111}} From this point on various authors adjusted some of the consonants and vowels, but the system of tone marks from Doty's ''Manual'' survives intact in modern POJ.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|pp=111, 116}} [[John Van Nest Talmage]] has traditionally been regarded as the founder of POJ among the community which uses the orthography, although it now seems that he was an early promoter of the system, rather than its inventor.{{sfnp|Chang|2001|p=14}}{{sfnp|Heylen|2001|p=149}}

In 1842 the [[Treaty of Nanking]] was concluded, which included among its provisions the creation of [[treaty port]]s in which Christian missionaries would be free to preach.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=92}} [[Xiamen]] (then known as Amoy) was one of these treaty ports, and British, Canadian and American missionaries moved in to start preaching to the local inhabitants. These missionaries, housed in the cantonment of [[Gulangyu Island|Gulangyu]], created reference works and religious tracts, including a [[bible translation]].{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=92}} Naturally, they based the pronunciation of their romanization on the speech of Xiamen, which became the de facto standard when they eventually moved into other areas of the Hokkien [[Sprachraum]], most notably Taiwan.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=93}} The 1858 [[Treaty of Tianjin]] officially opened Taiwan to western missionaries, and missionary societies were quick to send men to work in the field, usually after a sojourn in Xiamen to acquire the rudiments of the language.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=93}}

[[Quanzhou dialect|Quanzhou]] and [[Zhangzhou dialect|Zhangzhou]] are two major varieties of Southern Min, and in Xiamen they combined to form something "not Quan, not Zhang" – i.e. not one or the other, but rather a fusion, which became known as ''Amoy Dialect'' or ''Amoy Chinese''.{{sfnp|Ang|1992|p=2}} In Taiwan, with its mixture of migrants from both Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, the linguistic situation was similar; although the resulting blend in the southern city of [[Tainan]] differed from the Xiamen blend, it was close enough that the missionaries could ignore the differences and import their system wholesale.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=93}}

The fact that religious tracts, dictionaries, and teaching guides already existed in the Xiamen tongue meant that the missionaries in Taiwan could begin proselytizing immediately, without the intervening time needed to write those materials.{{sfnp|Heylen|2001|p=160}}
&lt;!--[[File:thomasbarclaypre1923.jpg|thumb|left|200px|alt=Portrait of Thomas Barclay|Scotsman Thomas Barclay, influential promoter of POJ]]--&gt;
Missionary opinion was divided on whether POJ was desirable as an end in itself as a full-fledged orthography, or as a means to literacy in [[Chinese characters]]. [[William Campbell (missionary)|William Campbell]] described POJ as a step on the road to reading and writing the characters, claiming that to promote it as an independent writing system would inflame nationalist passions in China, where characters were considered a sacred part of Chinese culture.{{sfnp|Klöter|2002|p=13}} Taking the other side, [[Thomas Barclay (missionary)|Thomas Barclay]] believed that literacy in POJ should be a goal rather than a [[wikt:waypoint|waypoint]]:
{{blockquote|Soon after my arrival in Formosa I became firmly convinced of three things, and more than fifty years experience has strengthened my conviction. The first was that if you are to have a healthy, living Church it is necessary that all the members, men and women, read the Scriptures for themselves; second, that this end can never be attained by the use of the Chinese character; third, that it can be attained by the use of the alphabetic script, this Romanised Vernacular.|Thomas Barclay&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvp|Band|1936|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Subsequently, the ''[[Taiwan Church News|Taiwan Prefectural City Church News]]'', which first appeared in 1885 and was produced by Barclay's Presbyterian Church of Taiwan Press,&lt;ref name=TCP/&gt; became the first printed newspaper in Taiwan.{{sfnp|Copper|2007|p=240}}

As other authors made their own alterations to the conventions laid down by Medhurst and Doty, ''pe̍h-ōe-jī'' evolved and eventually settled into its current form. [[Ernest Tipson]]'s 1934 pocket dictionary was the first reference work to reflect this modern spelling.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=114}}  Between Medhurst's dictionary of 1832 and the standardization of POJ in Tipson's time, there were a number of works published, which can be used to chart the change over time of ''pe̍h-ōe-jī'':&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from {{harvp|Klöter|2005|pp=113–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition for POJ was introduced during the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese era]] in Taiwan (1895–1945) in the form of [[Taiwanese kana]], a system designed as a teaching aid and pronunciation guide, rather than an independent orthography like POJ.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=136}} From the 1930s onwards, with the increasing militarization of Japan and the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule#Kōminka: "Subjects of the Emperor" (1937-1945)|Kōminka]] movement encouraging Taiwanese people to "[[Japanization|Japanize]]", there were a raft of measures taken against native languages, including Taiwanese.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=153}} While these moves resulted in a suppression of POJ, they were "a logical consequence of increasing the amount of education in Japanese, rather than an explicit attempt to ban a particular Taiwanese orthography in favor of [[Taiwanese kana]]".{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=154}}

The [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] beginning in 1937 brought stricter measures into force, and along with the outlawing of romanized Taiwanese, various publications were prohibited and Confucian-style ''shobō'' ({{zh|t=書房|p=shūfáng|poj=su-pâng}}) – private schools which taught [[Classical Chinese]] with literary Southern Min pronunciation – were closed down in 1939.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=135}} The Japanese authorities came to perceive POJ as an obstacle to Japanization and also suspected that POJ was being used to hide "concealed codes and secret revolutionary messages".{{sfnp|Lin|1999|p=21}} In the climate of the ongoing war the government banned the ''Taiwan Church News'' in 1942 as it was written in POJ.{{sfnp|Chang|2001|p=18}}

===After World War II===
[[File:Banning of POJ.gif|thumb|right|A decree (1955) banning Pe̍h-ōe-jī.]]
Initially the [[Kuomintang]] government in Taiwan had a liberal attitude towards "local dialects" (i.e. non-Mandarin varieties of Chinese). The [[National Languages Committee]] produced booklets outlining versions of [[Bopomofo]] for writing the Taiwanese tongue, these being intended for newly arrived government officials from outside Taiwan as well as local Taiwanese.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=231}} The first government action against native languages came in 1953, when the use of Taiwanese or Japanese for instruction was forbidden.{{sfnp|Lin|1999|p=1}} The next move to suppress the movement came in 1955, when the use of POJ for proselytizing was outlawed.{{sfnp|Chang|2001|p=18}} At that point in time there were 115,000 people literate in POJ in Taiwan, Fujian, and southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Tiuⁿ|2004|p=7}}

Two years later, missionaries were banned from using romanized bibles, and the use of "native languages" (i.e. Taiwanese Hakka, Hakka, and the non-Sinitic [[Formosan languages]]) in church work became illegal.{{sfnp|Chang|2001|p=18}} The ban on POJ bibles was overturned in 1959, but churches were "encouraged" to use character bibles instead.{{sfnp|Chang|2001|p=18}} Government activities against POJ intensified in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when several publications were banned or seized in an effort to prevent the spread of the romanization. In 1964 use of Taiwanese in schools or official settings was forbidden,{{sfnp|Lin|1999|p=1}} and transgression in schools punished with beatings, fines and humiliation.{{sfnp|Sandel|2003|p=533}} The ''Taiwan Church News'' (printed in POJ) was banned in 1969, and only allowed to return a year later when the publishers agreed to print it in [[Chinese characters]].{{sfnp|Chang|2001|p=18}}{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=217}}

In 1974, the [[Government Information Office]] banned ''[[#CITEREFEmbree1973|A Dictionary of Southern Min]]'', with a government official saying: "We have no objection to the dictionary being used by foreigners. They could use it in mimeographed form. But we don't want it published as a book and sold publicly because of the Romanization it contains. Chinese should not be learning Chinese through Romanization."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Guide to Dialect Barred in Taiwan: Dictionary Tried to Render Local Chinese Sounds |author= |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |date=September 15, 1974 |at=sec.

With the ending of martial law in 1987, the restrictions on "local languages" were quietly lifted,{{sfnp|Sandel|2003|p=530}} resulting in growing interest in Taiwanese writing during the 1990s.{{sfnp|Wu|2007|p=1}} For the first time since the 1950s, Taiwanese language and literature was discussed and debated openly in newspapers and journals.{{sfnp|Wu|2007|p=9}} There was also support from the then opposition party, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]], for writing in the language.{{sfnp|Lin|1999|p=1}} From a total of 26 documented orthographies for Taiwanese in 1987 (including defunct systems), there were a further 38 invented from 1987 to 1999, including 30 different romanizations, six adaptations of ''bopomofo'' and two [[hangul]]-like systems.{{sfnp|Chiung|2005|p=275}} Some commentators believe that the Kuomintang, while steering clear of outright banning of the native language movements after the end of martial law, took a "divide and conquer" approach by promoting [[Taiwanese Language Phonetic Alphabet]] (TLPA), an alternative to POJ,{{sfnp|Chang|2001|p=19}} which was at the time the choice of the majority inside the nativization movement.{{sfnp|Chiung|2005|p=273}}

Native language education has remained a fiercely debated topic in Taiwan into the 21st century and is the subject of much political wrangling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[Taipei Times]] |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2009/02/28/2003437216 |title=Activists demand Hoklo exams |author=Loa Iok-sin |date=2009-02-28 |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[China Post]] |date=2003-09-25 |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/news/2003/09/25/41604/Premiers-comments.htm |title=Premier's comments over language status draws anger |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Comparison of Hokkien writing systems|Written Hokkien}}
The current system of ''pe̍h-ōe-jī'' has been stable since the 1930s, with a few minor exceptions (detailed below).{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=98}} There is a fair degree of similarity with the [[Vietnamese alphabet]], including the {{angle bracket|b/p/ph}} distinction and the use of {{angle bracket|[[ơ]]}} in Vietnamese compared with {{angle bracket|[[o͘]]}} in POJ.{{sfnp|Chang|2001|p=15}} POJ uses the following letters and combinations:{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=99}}

[[Varieties of Chinese#Phonology|Chinese phonology]] traditionally divides syllables in Chinese into three parts; firstly the ''initial'', a consonant or consonant blend which appears at the beginning of the syllable, secondly the ''final'', consisting of a ''medial vowel'' (optional), a ''nucleus vowel'', and an optional ''ending''; and finally the tone, which is applied to the whole syllable.{{sfnp|Chung|1996|p=78}} In terms of the non-tonal (i.e. phonemic) features, the ''nucleus vowel'' is the only required part of a licit consonant in Chinese varieties.{{sfnp|Chung|1996|p=78}} Unlike Mandarin but like other southern varieties of Chinese, Taiwanese has final [[stop consonant]]s with [[no audible release]], a feature that has been preserved from [[Middle Chinese]].{{sfnp|Norman|1998|p=237}} There is some debate as to whether these stops are a tonal feature or a phonemic one, with some authorities distinguishing between {{angle bracket|-h}} as a tonal feature, and {{angle bracket|-p}}, {{angle bracket|-t}}, and {{angle bracket|-k}} as phonemic features.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=14}} Southern Min dialects also have an optional nasal property, which is written with a superscript {{angle bracket|ⁿ}} and usually identified as being part of the vowel.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=15}}

A legitimate syllable in Hokkien takes the form &lt;code&gt;(initial) + (medial vowel) + nucleus + (stop) + tone&lt;/code&gt;, where items in parenthesis indicate optional components.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=109}}

[[File:POJ tone marks.png|thumb|250px|right|The five tone markings used in ''pe̍h-ōe-jī'', representing tones 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8|alt=POJ tone markings]]
In standard Amoy or Taiwanese Hokkien there are seven distinct [[tone (linguistics)|tones]], which by convention are numbered 1–8, with number 6 omitted (tone 6 used to be a distinct tone, but has long since merged with tone 2).{{sfnp|Maryknoll|1984|pp=5–7}} Tones 1 and 4 are both represented without a [[diacritic]], and can be distinguished from each other by the syllable ending, which is a vowel, {{angle bracket|-n}}, {{angle bracket|-m}}, or {{angle bracket|-ng}} for tone 1, and {{angle bracket|-h}}, {{angle bracket|-k}}, {{angle bracket|-p}}, and {{angle bracket|-t}} for tone 4.

Southern Min dialects undergo considerable [[tone sandhi]], i.e. changes to the tone depending on the position of the syllable in any given sentence or utterance.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=109}} However, like [[pinyin]] for [[Mandarin Chinese]], POJ always marks the citation tone (i.e. the original, pre-sandhi tone) rather than the tone which is actually spoken.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=100}} This means that when reading aloud the reader must adjust the tone markings on the page to account for sandhi. Some textbooks for learners of Southern Min mark both the citation tone and the sandhi tone to assist the learner.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=101}}

There is some debate as to the correct placement of tone marks in the case of [[diphthong]]s and [[triphthong]]s, particularly those which include {{angle bracket|oa}} and {{angle bracket|oe}}.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=102}} Most modern writers follow six rules:{{sfnp|Chang|2001|pp=86–88}}

#If the syllable has one vowel, that vowel should be tone-marked; viz. {{angle bracket|tī}}, {{angle bracket|láng}}, {{angle bracket|chhu̍t}}
#If a diphthong contains {{angle bracket|i}} or {{angle bracket|u}}, the tone mark goes above the ''other'' vowel; viz. {{angle bracket|ia̍h}}, {{angle bracket|kiò}}, {{angle bracket|táu}}
#If a diphthong includes both {{angle bracket|i}} and {{angle bracket|u}}, mark the {{angle bracket|u}}; viz. {{angle bracket|iû}}, {{angle bracket|ùi}}
#If the ''final'' is made up of three or more letters, mark the second vowel (except when rules 2 and 3 apply); viz. {{angle bracket|goán}}, {{angle bracket|oāi}}, {{angle bracket|khiáu}}  &lt;!-- Note: the accent mark location for goan here conflicts with the marking of goan in the section "Audio Samples" below.  It also conflicts with marks in Wiktionary. --&gt;
#If {{angle bracket|o}} occurs with {{angle bracket|a}} or {{angle bracket|e}}, mark the {{angle bracket|o}} (except when rule 4 applies); viz. {{angle bracket|òa}}, {{angle bracket|thóe}}
#If the syllable has no vowel, mark the nasal consonant; viz. {{angle bracket|m̄}}, {{angle bracket|ǹg}}, {{angle bracket|mn̂g}}

===Hyphens===
A single hyphen is used to indicate a compound. What constitutes a compound is controversial, with some authors equating it to a "word" in English, and others not willing to limit it to the English concept of a word.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=102}} Examples from POJ include {{angle bracket|sì-cha̍p}} "forty", {{angle bracket|bé-hì-thôan}} "circus", and {{angle bracket|hôe-ho̍k}} "recover (from illness)". The rule-based sandhi behaviour of tones in compounds has not yet been clearly defined by linguists.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=103}} A double hyphen {{angle bracket|--}} is used when POJ is deployed as an orthography (rather than as a transcription system) to indicate that the following syllable should be pronounced in the neutral tone.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=103–104}} It also marks to the reader that the preceding syllable does not undergo tone sandhi, as it would were the following syllable non-neutral. [[Morpheme]]s following a double hyphen are often (but not always) grammatical function words.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=104}}

===Regional differences===
In addition to the standard syllables detailed above, there are several regional variations of Hokkien which can be represented with non-standard or semi-standard spellings. In the [[Zhangzhou dialect|Zhangzhou accent]], spoken in [[Zhangzhou]] and parts of Taiwan, particularly the northeastern coast around [[Yilan City]], the final {{angle bracket|ng}} is replaced with {{angle bracket|uiⁿ}}, for example in "egg" {{angle bracket|nuīⁿ}} and "cooked rice" {{angle bracket|pūiⁿ}}.{{sfnp|Chang|2001|p=134}}  The /[[Open-mid front unrounded vowel|ɛ]]/ vowel is written as {{angle bracket|ɛ}} or {{angle bracket|e͘}} (with a dot above right, by analogy with {{angle bracket|o͘}}).

Due to POJ's origins in the church, much of the material in the script is religious in nature, including several Bible translations, books of hymns, and guides to morality. The Tainan Church Press, established in 1884, has been printing POJ materials ever since, with periods of quiet when POJ was suppressed in the early 1940s and from around 1955 to 1987. In the period to 1955, over 2.3 million volumes of POJ books were printed,{{sfnp|Tiuⁿ|2004|p=6}} and one study in 2002 catalogued 840 different POJ texts in existence.{{sfnp|Tiuⁿ|2004|p=8}} Besides [[:zh-min-nan:Thâu-ia̍h|a Southern Min version of Wikipedia]] in the orthography,{{sfnp|Iûⁿ|2009|p=23}} there are teaching materials, religious texts, and books about linguistics, medicine and geography.

==Computing==
POJ was initially not well supported by word-processing applications due to the special diacritics needed to write it. Support has now improved and there are now sufficient resources to both enter and display POJ correctly. Several [[input method]]s exist to enter [[Unicode]]-compliant POJ, including [[OpenVanilla]] ([[OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]), the [[cross-platform]] Tai-lo Input Method released by the Taiwanese [[Ministry of Education (Republic of China)|Ministry of Education]], and the [[Firefox]] add-on Transliterator, which allows in-browser POJ input.{{sfnp|Iûⁿ|2009|p=29}} When POJ was first used in word-processing applications it was not fully supported by the Unicode standard, thus necessitating work-arounds. One employed was encoding the necessary characters in the "Private Use" section of Unicode, but this required both the writer and the reader to have the correct custom font installed.{{sfnp|Iûⁿ|2009|p=20}} Another solution was to replace troublesome characters with near equivalents, for example substituting {{angle bracket|ä}} for {{angle bracket|ā}} or using a standard {{angle bracket|o}} followed by an [[interpunct]] to represent {{angle bracket|[[o͘]]}}.{{sfnp|Iûⁿ|2009|p=20}} With the introduction into Unicode 4.1.0 of the [[combining character]] &lt;code&gt;COMBINING DOT ABOVE RIGHT&lt;/code&gt; (U+0358) in 2004, all the necessary characters were present to write regular POJ without the need for workarounds.{{sfnp|Iûⁿ|2009|p=11}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0300.pdf|title=Combining Diacritical Marks|publisher=unicode.org|accessdate=2010-07-29|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even after the addition of these characters, there are still relatively few fonts which are able to properly render the script, including the combining characters. Some of those which can are [[Charis SIL]], [[DejaVu fonts|DejaVu]], [[Doulos SIL]], [[Linux Libertine]], and [[Taigi Unicode]].{{sfnp|Iûⁿ|2009|p=20}}

One of the most popular modern ways of writing Taiwanese is by using a mixed orthography{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=225}} called Hàn-lô{{sfnp|Ota|2005|p=21}} ({{zh|t=漢羅|p=Hàn-Luó|s=汉罗}}; literally ''Chinese-Roman''), and sometimes ''Han-Romanization mixed script'', a style not unlike written [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] or (historically) [[hanja|Korean]].{{sfnp|Iûⁿ|2009|p=10}} In fact, the term Hàn-lô does not describe one specific system, but covers any kind of writing in Southern Min which features both Chinese characters and romanization.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=225}} That romanization is usually POJ, although recently some texts have begun appearing with [[Taiwanese Romanization System]] (Tâi-lô) spellings too. The problem with using only Chinese characters to write Southern Min is that there are many morphemes (estimated to be around 15 percent of running text){{sfnp|Lin|1999|p=7}} which are not definitively associated with a particular character. Various strategies have been developed to deal with the issue, including creating new characters, allocating Chinese characters used in written Mandarin with similar meanings (but dissimilar etymology) to represent the missing characters, or using romanization for the "missing 15%".{{sfnp|Lin|1999|pp=9–11}} There are two rationales for using mixed orthography writing, with two different aims. The first is to allow native speakers (almost all of whom can already write Chinese characters) to make use of their knowledge of characters, while replacing the missing 15% with romanization.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=225}} The second is to wean character literates off using them gradually, to be replaced eventually by fully romanized text.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=230}}
Examples of modern texts in Hàn-lô include religious, pedagogical, scholarly, and literary works, such as:
*{{cite book|author=Chang Yu-hong|title=Principles of POJ}}{{sfnp|Chang|2001}}
*{{cite book|title=A-Chhûn|author=Babuja A. Sidaia}}{{sfnp|Sidaia|1998}}

==Adaptations for other Chinese varieties==
POJ has been adapted for several other [[varieties of Chinese]], with varying degrees of success. For [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], missionaries and others have produced a Bible translation, hymn book, textbooks, and dictionaries.{{sfnp|Wu|Chen|2004}} Materials produced in the orthography, called [[Pha̍k-fa-sṳ]], include:
*{{cite book|title=Hak-ngi Sṳn-kin, Sin-yuk lau Sṳ-phien: Hien-thoi Thoi-van Hak-ngi Yit-pun (Hakka Bible, New Testament and Psalms: Today's Taiwan Hakka Version)|publisher=Bible Society|year=1993}}

*{{cite book|title=Hak-ka Sṳn-sṳ (Hakka Hymns)|isbn=957-8349-75-0|year=1999|publisher=PCT Press|place=Tainan}}
A modified version of POJ has also been created for [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hailufeng.com/detail/?newsid=23156|script-title=zh:潮州字典-韵母表|publisher=Hailufeng|accessdate=2010-03-10|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
[[File:Books which use the Pe̍h-ōe-jī romanisation system for Southern Min-Taiwanese.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Some books which use ''pe̍h-ōe-jī'', including textbooks, dictionaries, a bible, poetry, and academic works|alt=Some POJ books]]
Most native Southern Min speakers in Taiwan are unfamiliar with POJ or any other writing system,{{sfnp|Ota|2005|p=20}} commonly asserting that "Taiwanese has no writing",{{sfnp|Baran|2004|p=35–5}} or, if they are made aware of POJ, considering romanization as the "low" form of writing, in contrast with the "high" form (Chinese characters).{{sfnp|Chiung|2005|p=300}} For those who are introduced to POJ alongside Han-lo and completely Chinese character-based systems, a clear preference has been shown for all-character systems, with all-romanization systems at the bottom of the preference list, likely because of the preexisting familiarity of readers with Chinese characters.{{sfnp|Chiung|2005|p=301}}

POJ remains the Taiwanese orthography "with the richest inventory of written work, including dictionaries, textbooks, literature [...] and other publications in many areas".{{sfnp|Chiung|2005|p=272}} A 1999 estimate put the number of literate POJ users at around 100,000,{{sfnp|Lin|1999|p=17}} and secular organizations have been formed to promote the use of romanization among Taiwanese speakers.{{sfnp|Chiung|2007|p=474}}

Outside Taiwan, POJ is rarely used. For example, in Fujian, [[Xiamen University]] uses a romanization known as [[Bbánlám pìngyīm]], based on [[Pinyin]]. In other areas where Hokkien is spoken, such as [[Singapore]], the [[Speak Mandarin Campaign]] is underway to actively discourage people from speaking Hokkien or other non-Mandarin varieties in favour of switching to Mandarin instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSSIN366189 |title=Eyeing China, Singapore sees Mandarin as its future |publisher=Reuters |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2009-10-31 |last=Wong-Anan |first=Nopporn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Taiwan's [[Ministry of Education (Taiwan)|Ministry of Education]] chose an official romanization for use in teaching Southern Min in the state school system.{{sfnp|Tseng|2009|p=2}} POJ was one of the candidate systems, along with [[Daighi tongiong pingim]], but a compromise system, the [[Taiwanese Romanization System]] or ''Tâi-Lô'', was chosen in the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |script-title=zh:閩南語鄉土教學確定採台灣閩南語羅馬字拼音 |trans-title=Southern Min native language teaching to use Taiwan Southern Min Romanization |url=http://blog.udn.com/alexandroslee/471006|publisher=Central News Agency|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tâi-Lô retains most of the orthographic standards of POJ, including the tone marks, while changing the troublesome {{angle bracket|o͘}} character for {{angle bracket|oo}}, swapping {{angle bracket|ts}} for {{angle bracket|ch}}, and replacing {{angle bracket|o}} in [[diphthong]]s with {{angle bracket|u}}.{{sfnp|Tseng|2009|pp=2–5}} Supporters of Taiwanese writing are in general deeply suspicious of government involvement, given the history of official suppression of native languages,{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=248}} making it unclear whether Tâi-Lô or POJ will become the dominant system in the future.

There are a number of '''formats''' used in various levels of competition in [[sport]]s and [[game]]s to determine an overall champion. Some of the most common are the ''single elimination'', the ''best-of-'' series, the ''total points series'' more commonly known as ''on aggregate'', and the ''[[round-robin tournament]]''.

==Single elimination==
{{Main article|Single-elimination tournament}}
{{see also|Shaughnessy playoff system}}
A '''[[Single-elimination tournament|Single elimination]]''' ("knockout") playoff pits the participants in one-game matches, with the loser being dropped from the competition. Single elimination tournaments are much more common in individual sports like [[tennis]]. In most tennis tournaments, the players are [[Seed (sports)|seeded]] against each other, and the winner of each match continues to the next round, all the way to the final.

Of the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|big four American sports leagues]], only the [[National Football League]] uses this system for all rounds of its postseason. This works for the NFL because its regular seasons are much shorter (16 games) than those in the other sports (from 82 to 162 games), and the difference in quality between teams is believed to be more quickly discernible. The rigors of individual games, held only once per week, also preclude the possibility of longer playoff series. Since the 1990 season six teams are seeded from each conference, with the top two getting a first-round "bye". The remaining teams pair off, with the higher-seeded team hosting. The winners of those games then play the higher-seeded teams that received byes in elimination playoffs, and then the winners of those matches face each in another in elimination playoffs to determine who will represent each conference in the [[Super Bowl]]. The winner of that game wins the championship.

Until the late 1960s, the only regular post-season fixtures in U.S. professional football were the league Championship Games. Divisional playoffs were only held in the event of a tie in the division standings. Divisional playoffs as a regularly scheduled event were not introduced in the NFL and rival [[American Football League]] until the seasons immediately preceding the [[AFL-NFL merger]] in 1970.

Like the NFL, the [[Canadian Football League]] also uses one game playoffs, and has used them almost exclusively since the 1973 season. In the CFL, six teams qualify for the playoffs, divided into two divisional brackets of three teams each. The second place teams in each division host the Division Semi-Final, while the division winners each receive a bye to the Division Final. The Division Final winners play in the [[Grey Cup]]. Unlike the NFL, divisional playoffs have been a regular fixture in professional Canadian football since the 1930s. The main rationale for their introduction was that Canadian football clubs were (and, to a considerable extent, still are) more heavily dependent on a steady stream of gate receipts compared to their NFL counterparts, largely due to their playing in relatively small markets and smaller stadiums compared to NFL teams. A more inclusive playoff structure was therefore seen as necessary to ensure as many games as possible up to the end of the season were "meaningful" so as to encourage fans to attend games.

The only exception to a strict single-elimination format since the early 1970s was in 1986 when the league amended its playoff format to allow a fourth place team in one division to qualify in place of a third place team with a worse record. That year, when only two [[Canadian Football League East Division|East Division]] teams qualified compared to four [[Canadian Football League West Division|Western]] teams, the rules mandated the two Eastern teams play a two-game total points series over two weekends while the four Western teams played a single elimination playoff over the same time frame. The CFL eventually amended this format into the present "crossover rule" so as to allow a qualifying fourth place team to compete as the third place team in the other divisional bracket, thereby preserving the first place byes. Prior to 1973, the CFL used two game and three game playoffs in its divisional rounds, as discussed below.

Beginning in 2012, [[Major League Baseball]] expanded its playoffs from 8 teams to 10, adding a second wild card in each league. The wild card teams now play a one-game playoff to determine which club advances to the best-of-five division series to meet the team with the best overall record in that particular league.

In both the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|men's]] and [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|women's]] [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[college basketball]] tournaments, 64 teams are seeded into four brackets of 16 teams each. (From 2011, the men's tournament will feature a "First Four", with the four lowest-ranked conference champions and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams playing single games to enter the 64-team draw.) The #1 team plays the #16 team in each bracket, the #2 plays the #15, and so on. Theoretically, if a higher-ranked team always beats a lower-ranked team, the second game will be arranged #1 vs. #8, #2 vs. #7, etc.; the third will be arranged #1 vs. #4, #2 vs. #3; the fourth will be arranged #1 vs. #2. If for instance #9 beats #8 in the first game, the #9 will simply take the theoretical spot of #8 and play #1. Winners advance through each round, changing cities after every two rounds. The [[Final Four]] teams, one from each bracket, play each other in the last weekend, with the winner of the final two being awarded the championship.

National [[association football]] competitions usually don't have playoffs, but when employed, use single-elimination formats to determine finalists and winners. The [[Major League Soccer]] [[MLS Cup Playoffs|playoffs]] use such a format; since [[2012 Major League Soccer season|2012]], the first round in each conference and the championship final, known as the [[MLS Cup]], are conducted as single games, while the conference semifinals and conference finals are two-legged matches determined on total goals scored. [[Liga MX]] in [[Mexico]], which splits its season into [[Apertura and Clausura|two phases]], uses playoffs known as the ''Liguilla'' to determine the champions of each phase. Unlike the MLS system, all ''Liguilla'' matches are two-legged ties. [[Australia]]'s [[A-League]] introduced a six-team knockout playoff, known locally as a "finals series", in the [[2012–13 A-League|2012–13 season]]. Unlike the MLS playoffs or Liga MX ''Liguilla'', the A-League finals series uses one-off matches throughout, culminating in the [[A-League Grand Final]]. This format is a departure from norms in football codes in Australia; previously, the A-League used a [[#Top six system|hybrid elimination system]] that allowed top teams in the regular season to lose one finals match but still win the tournament. The [[FIFA World Cup]] tournament also uses knockout rounds after a group stage of 32 teams divided into 8 groups of 4 determines who advances to them.

Some knockout tournaments may also include a [[third place playoff]], a single match to decide which competitor or team will be credited with finishing third and fourth place. The teams that compete in such third place games are usually the two losing semifinalists in a particular tournament. Although these semifinalists are still in effect "eliminated" from contending for the championship, they either may be competing for a [[bronze medal]] like some tournaments in the [[Olympic Games]] or basically just to salvage some pride in a consolation match, like in the [[FIFA World Cup]] or [[Rugby World Cup]].

When a playoff of this type involves the top four teams, it is sometimes known as the [[Shaughnessy playoff system]], after [[Frank Shaughnessy]], who first developed it for the [[International League]] of [[Minor League Baseball|minor league baseball]]. Variations of the Shaughnessy system also exist, such as in the promotion playoffs held by [[League 1 (rugby league)|League 1]] of British rugby league. The League 1 playoff does not involve the top four teams; the team that tops the table after the Super 8s phase (which follows a single round-robin phase involving all league teams) is crowned champion and  receives automatic promotion to the second-tier [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship]], while the next four teams contest a knockout playoff for the second promotion place. A nearly identical format, with the only difference being that the knockout stage followed a full home-and-away league season, was used by the second level of France's rugby union system, [[Rugby Pro D2|Pro D2]], through the 2016–17 season. Since then, Pro D2 uses a six-team playoff with the winner earning automatic promotion to the [[Top 14]] and the runner-up entering a playoff with the 13th-place team in Top 14 for the final place in the next season's Top 14.

==Stepladder==
The "stepladder", named so as the bracket resembles a [[step ladder]] is a variation of the single-elimination tournament; instead of, in a 16-team tournament, the #1 seed facing the #16 seed in the first round, the bracket is constructed as to give the higher seeded teams [[bye (sports)|bye]]s, where the #1 seed has bye up to the third round, playing the winner of game between the #8 seed the #9 vs. #16 winner. This setup is seldom used best-of-''x'' series as this may yield long waiting times for the teams afforded the bye, while the teams that played in the earlier rounds would be spent when they reach the latter rounds.

The  [[Big East Men's Basketball Tournament]] used this format in a 16-team, 5-round format. The [[PBA Tour]] uses the 4-player, 3-round format (sometimes a 5-player, 4 round format). The [[UAAP Basketball Championship|University Athletic Association of the Philippines Basketball Championship]] uses this format (4-teams, 3-rounds) only if there's an undefeated team, otherwise it uses a single-elimination format.

While [[Nippon Professional Baseball]]'s [[Climax Series]] has been called a "stepladder" playoff with only three participating teams (2 rounds), it functions mostly as a single-elimination tournament with 3 teams, and is structurally the same with a 6-team, 3-round playoff.  The [[KBO League]]'s [[KBO Korean Series|Korean Series]], on the other hand, is considered a stepladder system - the teams that finish third and fourth place play a best-of-3 series (with the third place team automatically a 1-0 series lead), whose winner then plays the second-place team in a best-of-5, whose winner in turn plays the first-place team in a best-of-7 for the title.

[[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] has their playoffs done this way: the 5-8 and 6-7 seeds play in the first round. The top two seeds get double byes and the next two seeds 1st-round byes. The first two rounds are single-elimination; all others are best-of-5.

[[League of Legends]] competition often uses the stepladder system. The [[League of Legends Pro League]] uses a double stepladder for its playoffs, giving the first seeds of the Western and Eastern Conferences a bye to the semifinals, the second seeds a bye to the quarterfinals, and the third seeds a one-game advantage against the fourth seeds in the first round. The [[League of Legends Pro League]], [[League of Legends Championship Series]], and [[League of Legends Master Series]] also use a stepladder bracket (in this case referred to as "The Gauntlet") to determine each league's third representative at the [[League of Legends World Championship]].

==Double elimination==
{{Main article|Double-elimination tournament}}
A ''[[double elimination]]'' format is used in most NCAA and high school [[baseball]] and [[softball]] tournaments in the United States. Starting in [[2010 Little League World Series|2010]], the [[Little League World Series]] in baseball also adopted this format. Teams are eliminated from contention after incurring two losses in each round of play.

The format changes depending on the number of teams per bracket, but most major [[college baseball|collegiate baseball]] conferences with the format send only the top eight teams, or a mix of top teams plus the winners of a single elimination qualifier tournament, to their conference tournament.

The NCAA baseball and softball tournaments have used the format since its inception for regional and [[College World Series]] play.

In the current NCAA tournament format for four teams, the #1 seed plays the #4 seed ("Game 1"), and the #2 seed plays the #3 seed ("Game 2") on the first day of regional tournaments, and the first and second days of the College World Series (where the second bracket games are known as "Game 3" and "Game 4", respectively).

On the second day or series (third and fourth days at the College World Series), the losers play in the morning to determine who is eliminated ("Game 3" in regional, "Games 5" and "Game 7" in College World Series play), and who advances to the third game of the day. The winners ("Game 4" in regional, "Game 6" and "Game 8" in College World Series) play to determine who advances to the final on the third day.

In NCAA regional games, the loser of this game plays the winner of the morning game that evening ("Game 5") to determine who plays in the final.

In College World Series play, because the bracket teams play on alternating days, these games ("Game 9" and "Game 10") are played on the fifth day.

In NCAA regional games, the third day will feature the regional championship ("Game 6"). If the winner of Game 4 defeats the winner of Game 5, the winner advances to the Super Regional. Until the 2005 tournament, if the winner of Game 5 defeats the winner of Game 4, the two teams would meet again in Game 7 thirty minutes later to determine which team advances to the Super Regional.

However, with a concern that some teams were playing four games in two days, the NCAA made a rule change in 2005 to equalize the disadvantage of the winner of Game 5 by stating should the winner of Game 5 win Game 6, Game 7 would be played on a fourth day.

In the College World Series, on the sixth day, the winner of Game 9 plays the winner of Game 7 ("Game 11"), and the winner of Game 10 plays the winner of Game 8 ("Game 12"). If the winner in Game 7 wins Game 11, and/or the winner of Game 8 wins Game 12, such winners advance to the best-of-three final. If the winner of Game 9 defeats the winner of Game 7, and/or the winner of Game 10 defeats the winner of Game 8 the two teams would play again on the seventh day in Games 13 and 14, respectively, if they are needed, to determine who advances to the final.

Starting with the 2010 edition, the Little League World Series adopted a new format that involves four double-elimination brackets. In 2010, the U.S. and International divisions were split into two four-team pools, with each pool conducting a double-elimination tournament to determine its winner. After the end of double-elimination play, the U.S. pool winners play one another in single games, as do the International pool winners, with the losers playing a third-place game and the winners playing a championship game. This was altered in 2011 so that all eight US team and all eight international teams played in one large bracket each, with each bracket's winner playing each other for the championship and each bracket's runner-up playing each other for third-place.  In another new feature, all teams are guaranteed at least three games; the first team eliminated from each pool plays a "crossover game" that matches an eliminated U.S. team with an eliminated International team.

Many [[esports]], most notably [[Counter-Strike]] and [[StarCraft]], use a double-elimination bracket to determine the top two teams in a four team group. In this usage, the format is referred to as "GSL", after the [[Global StarCraft II League]]. [[Dota 2]] competitions often use a GSL or round robin group stage to seed teams into a double-elimination bracket. [[Super Smash Bros.]] tournaments, as well as other [[fighting game]] competitions, typically use an open double-elimination bracket with no preceding group stage or qualifiers.

==Hybrid elimination systems==
{{further|McIntyre System}}
Some playoff systems combine the features of single- and double-elimination tournaments. In these systems, one or more higher-ranked teams have an opportunity to skip a round of the playoffs by winning their first match. Even if they lose that match, they can still advance to the championship final. Lower-ranked teams receive no such break.

These are variations of systems developed by Australian lawyer [[Kenneth McIntyre|Ken McIntyre]] for the Victorian Football League (VFL), the historic predecessor to today's [[Australian Football League]] (AFL), starting in 1931.

===Page–McIntyre system===
{{main article|Page playoff system}}
This system, also bearing the name of its promoter Percy Page, is a four-team playoff first developed for [[Australian rules football]]. It has been used in many competitions in that sport and in [[rugby league]], but is most prominent in [[softball]] and [[curling]] (which use the name "Page playoff system"). The [[Indian Premier League]] in [[Twenty20]] [[cricket]] uses this system as well.

In this system, the first round (sometimes called the "quarterfinals") matches #1 against #2 and #3 against #4. The winner of the 1–2 match advances directly to the final. The next round, known as the semifinal, pits the loser of the 1–2 match against the winner of the 3–4 match.

====Example====
As used in the [[2006 Tim Hortons Brier]], Canada's national men's curling championship:

{{PagePlayoffBracket | RD1=

| RD3-score1=7
| RD3-seed2=2
| RD3-team2='''{{flag|Quebec|size=30px}}'''
| RD3-score2='''8'''
}}

===Top five system===
{{main article|Top five play-offs}}
McIntyre's first modification was an expansion to five teams. In this format, the first round matches #2 v #3 and #4 v #5, with the #1 seed receiving a bye into the second round. The 4–5 match is played to eliminate one team, while the 2–3 match is played to determine which match they will play in the second round.

In the second round, the loser of the 2–3 match plays the winner of the 4–5 match, while the winner of the 2–3 match plays the #1 seed. From this point forward, the tournament is identical to the Page playoff system.

While no major league uses this system today, it has been used in the past by the VFL and several rugby league competitions, most notably the short-lived [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] of Australia and the present-day European [[Super League]]. Many lower-level leagues in both Australian rules and rugby league still use the system.

====Example====
As used in the [[2006 Bartercard Cup]], the championship of New Zealand rugby league:

===Top six system===
{{main article|Top six play-offs}}
{{see also|McIntyre System#First McIntyre final six system|McIntyre System#Second McIntyre final six system|l1=First McIntyre final six system|l2=Second McIntyre final six system}}
McIntyre next developed two slightly different systems for six-team playoffs. In each system, the #1 and #2 seeds played to determine the specific semifinal match in which they would compete, while the other four teams played knockout matches in the first week to eliminate two teams and determine the other two semifinal participants. The semifinal in which the winner of the 1–2 match competes directly determines one place in the championship final (often called a "Grand Final", especially in Australia). The other semifinal is an elimination match, with the winner advancing into a "Preliminary Final" to determine the other Grand Final place.

This system was further tweaked into the top-six system used by the [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship]] and [[League 1 (rugby league)|League 1]] of European rugby league until being abandoned from the 2015 season forward. A slightly modified version of this system was used in the [[A-League]] of Australian soccer starting in [[2009–10 A-League|2010]] before a pure knockout format was adopted beginning in [[2012–13 A-League|2013]].

In the modern top-six system, the first round consists of knockout matches involving #3 vs #6 and #4 vs #5, with the #1 and #2 teams receiving a bye into the next round. After those matches, the format is identical to the Page playoff system.

The A-League's former system had the top two teams participating in a two-legged match instead of the single-elimination matches that the other four teams faced. It did not affect the teams' eventual playoff paths.

===Top eight system===
{{main article|McIntyre Final Eight System|AFL final eight system|Super League play-offs}}
McIntyre's final development expanded the concept to an eight-team playoff. This expansion meant that no team received a "second chance" after the first week of the playoffs.

====McIntyre Final Eight====
The original McIntyre Final Eight system is notable in that it uses the regular-season league table to eliminate two teams in the first week of the playoffs. The procedure is:

;Week 1
* 1st Qualifying Final: 4th seed vs 5th seed
* 2nd Qualifying Final: 3rd seed vs 6th seed
* 3rd Qualifying Final: 2nd seed vs 7th seed
* 4th Qualifying Final: 1st seed vs 8th seed

The fates of the teams in this round depend on whether they won or lost their Qualifying Final, and on their regular-season position. The four winners and the two losers that finished highest on the regular-season table advance to later rounds, with the two other losers eliminated.

;Week 2
* 1st Semi-final:&lt;ref name="semi-final"&gt;Under finals systems traditionally used in Australian sport, the term "semi-final" has different usage from that in a traditional knockout tournament. The two games played immediately before the Grand Final, which would be known as semi-finals in a knockout tournament, are called "preliminary finals". The semi-finals refer to the two games preceding the preliminary finals. This terminology was used by the AFL under the McIntyre System from 1931 until 1993, and continues to this day in the AFL and most other Australian leagues. The main exception is the A-League, which adopted a pure knockout finals series in 2013 and uses "semi-final" for the games immediately preceding its Grand Final.&lt;/ref&gt; 4th highest-ranked winner vs 2nd highest-ranked loser
* 2nd Semi-final: 3rd highest-ranked winner vs 1st highest-ranked loser

The two losing teams are eliminated, and the two winning teams progress to Week 3.

;Week 3
* 1st Preliminary Final: Highest-seeded Qualifying Final winner vs winner of 1st Semi-final
* 2nd Preliminary Final: Second-highest-seeded Qualifying Final winner vs winner of 2nd Semi-final

The two losing teams are eliminated, and the two winning teams progress to the Grand Final.

;Week 4
* Grand Final: winner of 1st Preliminary Final vs winner of 2nd Preliminary Final

Due to perceived weaknesses of this system, the AFL adopted a modified top-eight playoff in [[2000 AFL season|2000]]. The [[National Rugby League]] (NRL), Australia's top rugby league competition (also with [[New Zealand Warriors|a team]] in New Zealand), used this system from 1999 through 2011, after which it changed to the AFL system.

====AFL system====
The current AFL finals system breaks up the eight participants into four groups of two teams, ranked by their league position after regular-season play. Each group receives an advantage over the teams directly below it on the league table. These advantages are the so-called "double-chance", where a loss in the first week will not eliminate a team from the finals, and home ground finals. Note, however, that "home" designations are often irrelevant if a finals match involves two teams from the same state. 
The finals format operates as follows:
;Week 1
* 1st Qualifying Final: 1st seed hosts 4th seed
* 2nd Qualifying Final: 2nd seed hosts 3rd seed
* 1st Elimination Final: 5th seed hosts 8th seed
* 2nd Elimination Final: 6th seed hosts 7th seed

The top four teams play the two Qualifying Finals.  The winners get a bye through to Week 3 of the tournament to play home Preliminary Finals, while the losers play home Semi-Finals in Week 2.  The bottom four teams play the two Elimination Finals, where the winners advance to Week 2 away games and the losers' seasons are over.

;Week 2
* 1st Semi-final:&lt;ref name="semi-final"/&gt; Loser of 1st QF hosts winner of 1st EF
* 2nd Semi-final: Loser of 2nd QF hosts winner of 2nd EF

;Week 3
* 1st Preliminary Final:&lt;ref name="semi-final"/&gt; Winner of 1st QF hosts winner of 2nd SF
* 2nd Preliminary Final: Winner of 2nd QF hosts winner of 1st SF

;Week 4
* [[AFL Grand Final]]: Winners of the two Preliminary Finals meet at the MCG.

The specific advantages gained by finishing in higher positions on the league table are as follows:

'''First and second''' — These teams receive the double-chance, and play their first two finals matches at home—their Qualifying Final, and then either a Semi-final (should they lose the QF) or Preliminary Final (should they win the QF). They must win two finals matches to reach the Grand Final.

'''Third and fourth''' — Like the top two teams, they receive the double-chance, and must win two finals matches to reach the Grand Final. However, they only get to play one finals match at home—a Semi-final if they lose their QF, or Preliminary Final if they win the QF.

'''Fifth and sixth''' — These teams do not receive a double-chance. They must win three matches to reach the Grand Final—an Elimination Final, Semi-final, and Preliminary Final. They do get to host their EF.

'''Seventh and eighth''' — These teams receive neither a double-chance nor a home finals match, and must also win three finals matches to reach the Grand Final.

The [[National Rugby League]] and [[Victorian Football League]] operate the same finals system.

====Super League system====
From [[Super League XIV|2009]] through to [[Super League XIX|2014]], the Super League used a top-eight playoff system. The expansion to an eight-team bracket coincided with the league's expansion from 12 to 14 teams. Like the AFL system, the Super League system eliminated two teams in each week leading up to the Grand Final. However, it had a number of differences from the AFL system, most notably the feature known as "Club Call" (explained below).&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite web | title = Super League play-offs overhauled| publisher = BBC | date = 2008-11-30 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/7757687.stm | accessdate = 2012-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the AFL, the participants were ranked by league position in the regular season. Unlike in the AFL, the team receiving home advantage in each match leading up to the Grand Final was guaranteed the right to host the match at a ground of its choosing, either its regular home stadium or (rarely) a larger nearby alternative.

;Week 1
* Qualifying Play-Offs:
** 1st vs 4th
** 2nd vs 3rd
The winners of these matches advanced directly to Week 3, in which they received home advantage. The higher-seeded winner received Club Call immediately after Week 2. The losers had another chance in Week 2, when they were at home to the winners of the Week 1 Elimination Play-Offs.
* Elimination Play-Offs
** 5th v 8th
** 6th v 7th
The winners of these matches advanced to Week 2, with the losers being eliminated.

;Week 2
* Preliminary Semi-Final 1: Highest-seeded QPO loser (1, 2, or 3) vs lowest-seeded EPO winner (6, 7, or 8)
* Preliminary Semi-Final 2: Lowest-seeded QPO loser (2, 3, or 4) vs highest-seeded EPO winner (5, 6, or 7)
The winners of these matches advanced to Week 3 and Club Call, with the losers being eliminated.

;Club Call
Club Call, a unique feature of the Super League system, took place on the second weekend of the playoffs, shortly after the winners of the two PSFs were known. The highest-seeded winning club from Week 1 was required to choose which of the two PSF winners they would play in Week 3.

;Week 3
* Qualifying Semi-Final 1: Highest-seeded QPO Winner v Club Call selected PSF winner
* Qualifying Semi-Final 2: Second-seeded QPO Winner v Club Call non-selected PSF winner
The winners advanced to the Grand Final the following week.

;Week 4
* [[Super League Grand Final]] at [[Old Trafford]], [[Manchester]]

[[Super League XX]] in 2015 introduced a radical change to the league system, under which the 24 clubs in Super League and the second-tier [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship]] are split into three groups of eight after each club has played 22 matches. The top eight clubs in Super League at that point will enter a new play-off structure, beginning with a single round-robin mini-league followed by a Shaughnessy play-off involving the top four teams.

=={{anchor|Best-of}}&lt;!-- [[Best-of series]] redirects here--&gt;Best-of formats==
The "best-of" formats refers to a head-to-head competition where the two competitors compete to first win the majority of the games allotted to win the "series". If a competitor wins a majority of the games, the remaining games may be discarded. This is a modification of the single-elimination tournament to allow more matches to be held. Moreover, if it can be said that if one competitor has a higher probability of winning a single game (and game results are [[i.i.d.]]), the likelihood that this competitor wins the series increases when more games are played. For example, if team A has a seventy percent chance of defeating team B in a single game, its probability of winning a best-of-three series against B is 78.4 percent, and its probability of winning a best-of-seven series is about 87.4 percent.
===Best-of-three playoff===
{{Redirect|Best of three|the Coney Hatch compilation album|Best of Three}}
A '''best-of-three playoff''' is a head-to-head competition between two teams in which one team must win two games to win the series. Two is chosen as it would constitute a majority of the games played; if one team wins both of the first two games, the third game is not played.

Often, when a best-of-series tied with each team having won an even number of games, the bracket is said to be a "best-of-(number of games left)." This is because for all practical purposes the teams are starting over. If a best-of-7 series is deadlocked at 2-2, the bracket is then referred to as a "best-of-3", since the reality is that the first team to win 2 games advances.

In [[tennis]], matches are usually decided with a best-of-3-sets format. Some major tournaments are played in a best-of-5-sets format, most notably the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] men's singles and doubles. Also, the 35 and over Gentlemen's Invitation Doubles and the 35 and over Ladies' Invitation Doubles of the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] are both round-robin tournaments.

====In North American competitions====

The first use of the best-of-three playoff was in [[Major League Baseball]]; the [[National League]] authorised such a [[pennant playoff|playoff]] to be held if two teams ended the season in a tie for first place; the [[American League]] used a single game in this situation. Since {{Mlby|1969}} both leagues have used only a one-game playoff for all playoff positions which are tied if only one team can advance to the playoffs. Since {{Mlby|1995}}, a tie-breaker based on season performance can be used only to seed teams.

Both the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] and [[National Hockey League|NHL]] once used best-of-three playoffs (often referred to as "mini-series"), but today neither league does: Pro basketball first adopted the best-of-three playoff for first-round play starting with its inception as the Basketball Association of America in [[1946–47 BAA season|1946]] (changing its name to the NBA three years later) and retaining it through the [[1959–60 NBA season|1959–60]] season; the league resumed its use of the best-of-three first-round series in [[1974–75 NBA season|1974–75]], but abolished it again in [[1983–84 NBA season|1983–84]] when the number of teams qualifying for its postseason tournament was increased to 16 (ten teams had qualified during the first two years of the aforementioned period, this number being expanded to twelve in [[1976–77 NBA season|1976–77]]; in both instances some of the highest-ranking teams did not participate in the best-of-three round, drawing byes and automatically advancing to the second round, which was best-of-seven, as were all subsequent rounds).

In [[ice hockey]], the best-of-three format was one of two possible types of series that could be held to determine the winner of the [[Stanley Cup]] (the other being a two-legged playoff series), and it was used in lower rounds in the [[National Hockey League]] up until the [[Original Six]] era. The best-of-three series in the modern era was first used in the first-round of the Stanley Cup playoffs beginning with the [[1974–75 NHL season|1974–75]] season; at that time, the number of NHL playoff teams had been increased to twelve from the previous eight. The format which then took effect called for the first three finishers in each of the league's four divisions to enter the postseason, but the first-place teams drew byes and did not play any best-of-three series; the postseason then proceeded as the NBA's did, with the second and all later rounds being best-of-seven. This remained the case until the [[1979–80 NHL season|1979–80]] season, when the NHL expanded its playoff field to 16 after absorbing four teams from the defunct [[World Hockey Association]] in a semi-merger, whereupon the byes were abolished and all 16 qualifying teams participated in the first round, which was lengthened to best-of-five. In both the NBA and NHL, the team with the higher finish during the regular season played the first and (if necessary) the third games of the series at home, with the lower-ranked team hosting the second game.

The [[World Cup of Hockey]], organized by the NHL, used a best-of-three format in the final round in [[1996 World Cup of Hockey|1996]] and [[2016 World Cup of Hockey|2016]], as did the [[Canada Cup]]. 

Until 2009, the [[WNBA]] forced the team with the higher record to travel to the lower seed's home court for game 1, then played the final game(s) at home. Because of this perceived inequity, in [[2010 WNBA season|2010]], the league switched to a more traditional 1-1-1 format, where the higher seed would play the first and (if needed) third games at home. Also, in [[2005 WNBA season|2005]], the league switched the [[WNBA Finals]] to a best-of-five playoff format. By [[2016 WNBA season|2016]] the league semifinals matched this format.

NCAA Division I baseball uses the best-of-three format in the second round and the final round of its 64-team championship tournament. Starting in 1999, when the tournament expanded from 48 teams (eight regionals of six teams each) to 64 teams (sixteen regionals of four teams each), the NCAA introduced the "super regional", in which the 16 regional winners play in 8 best-of-three series, with the 8 series winners advancing to the [[College World Series]]. If a regional winner is also a national seed (top eight seeds of the 64 first-round teams), it is guaranteed to host the super regional; if no national seed makes a particular super regional, the NCAA puts hosting rights up for bidding between the competing schools. In 2003, the College World Series changed from a one-game final to a best-of-three series.

From approximately the founding of the [[Western Interprovincial Football Union]] in 1936 until the early 1970s, multi-game playoffs series were a regular fixture of professional [[Canadian football]] playoffs. Over the years, both the WIFU (later the [[Canadian Football League West Division|Western Football Conference]]) and the [[Interprovincial Rugby Football Union]] (later the [[Canadian Football League East Division|Eastern Football Conference]]) used a combination of best-of-three series, three game total points series and two game total points series to determine both conference final participants and conference champions. The [[Grey Cup]] itself has always consisted of a single game.

The last best-of-three playoff series in what by then had evolved into a [[Canadian Football League]] consisting of two autonomous conferences was the 1971 Western Conference Final. Since 1972, the West has used one game playoffs. The Eastern Conference (which by that time had abolished the best-of-three format in favour of two game total points series) adopted one game playoffs for the 1973 season.

The [[National Football League]] has always used one-game playoffs.

====Competitions held outside North America====
The [[Euroleague]], the primary [[Europe]]-wide club competition in basketball, introduced a quarterfinal round for the [[Euroleague 2004-05|2004–05 season]] which originally employed a best-of-three format; starting with the [[Euroleague 2008–09|2008–09 season]], the quarterfinal round became best-of-five. This is the only point in the Euroleague where a playoff series is used; all earlier rounds are conducted in a league format, and the quarterfinal winners advance to the Final Four, where all games are one-off knockout matches.

In the [[FIBA Oceania Championship]], the best-of-three series is used if only both [[Australia men's national basketball team|Australia]] and [[New Zealand national basketball team|New Zealand]] play in the tournament. If a team wins the first two games, the last game may still be played. If other teams participate, a regular round-robin or multi-stage tournament is used. In [[FIBA Oceania Championship 2009|2009]], a [[two-legged tie]] was used, but it was reverted to a best-of-3 series in [[2011 FIBA Oceania Championship|2011]].

The best-of-3 playoff system was also used in the Brazilian Football League for the 1998 and 1999 seasons quarterfinals, semifinals and finals. The Brazilian model was unique in that extra time was not used (meaning matches could end in a draw) therefore, this system had a few modifications. If no team could win two games, the team with most victories would qualify. If the two teams had one victory, the team with the best [[goal difference]] would qualify. If the goal difference was the same, the team with the best regular season campaign would qualify. An interesting fact is that during the 1998 season, all the rounds were decided in three games.

=====Twice to beat advantage=====
In a modification of the best-of-3 format, the leagues in the [[Philippines]] awards a ''twice to beat advantage'' to the top seeds; in this case, the team with the twice to beat advantage needs to be beaten twice by its opponent, while it only has to win once, in a ''de facto'' 1–0 lead in a best-of-3 series. First applied in the semifinals of the scholastic [[UAAP Basketball Championship]], it has been adopted by the other scholastic competitions. The professional [[Philippine Basketball Association]] has adopted the format in the early rounds of its playoffs.

An amendment to the rules in 2008 gave the undefeated team of the season in the UAAP (the team that won all elimination round games) a [[bye (sport)|bye]] up to the finals possessing an automatic 1–0 lead in a best-of-5 series, or the ''thrice to beat advantage''. This has since been adopted by the [[NCAA (Philippines)|NCAA]] in 2009 and abolished in 2016, when the undefeated team has a final berth, but played in a common best-of-three format

===Best-of-five playoff===
A '''best-of-five playoff''' is a competition between two teams head-to-head which must win three games to win the series. Three is chosen as it would constitute a majority of games played; whoever has won three games before all five games have been played, all other games are omitted.

At present, only one [[United States|American]] men's professional sports body - [[Major League Baseball]] - makes use of the best-of-five playoff, doing so in its second round, known as the [[Division Series]]. At one time, however, the [[League Championship Series]] was best-of-five, from its birth with both leagues' realignment into two divisions in {{Mlby|1969}}, and continuing until this round was lengthened to best-of-seven in {{Mlby|1985}}. (This change would have immediate ramifications: In the American League, in each of the first two years where the LCS used the best-of-seven format, the [[Kansas City Royals]] in [[1985 American League Championship Series|1985]] and the [[Boston Red Sox]] in [[1986 American League Championship Series|1986]] fell behind 3-1 - which previously would have eliminated them - before coming back to win the series.) When the [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] was first used in {{Mlby|1995}} (it was created for the {{Mlby|1994}} season, but that year's entire postseason was canceled due to [[1994 baseball strike|a players' strike]]), the best-of-five format was authorized for the new Division Series, in which eight teams participated.

During the time that the League Championship Series was best-of-five, a "2-3" format was used, with one team hosting the first two games, the other the last three (these respective roles alternating between the Eastern and Western Division champions regardless of which one finished with the better regular-season record). This procedure was repeated at first when the best-of-five Division Series was added in 1995 (except that two of each league's now three division winners hosted three games and the wild card could never do so), but starting in {{Mlby|1998}} the home-field advantage was awarded to the two division winners in each league that had the best records; also in 1998, the "2-2-1" format was instituted, the team with the home-field advantage being given the first, second and fifth games at home instead of the third, fourth and fifth. For the 2012 postseason, the Division Series reverted to "2-3". With the addition of a second Wild Card team and subsequent [[Major League Baseball Wild Card Game|Wild Card Game]], a decision not made until well after the season schedule had been created, this was done to minimize the disruption of the schedule by giving the Division Series one off day instead of two. With the Wild Card playoff now established and schedules adjusted accordingly, the "2-2-1" format was restored since 2013.

The [[National Basketball Association]] and [[National Hockey League]] both formerly used best-of-five series, the NBA in its second round prior to the {{Nbay|1957}} season, and in the first round from {{Nbay|1960}} through {{Nbay|1966}}, and again from {{Nbay|1983}} until lengthening it to best-of-seven starting in {{Nbay|2002}}, and the NHL for its first-round series beginning with the {{NHL Year|1979|80}} season and lasting until that league increased its first round to best-of-seven in {{NHL Year|1986|87}}. Unlike in baseball, in both NBA and NHL best-of-five series the higher regular-season finisher always hosted the first, second, and (if necessary) fifth games.

As of [[2005 WNBA season|2005]], the [[Women's National Basketball Association]] now uses a best-of-five format for its [[WNBA Finals|championship]] series. The league semifinals matched this format starting in [[2016 WNBA season|2016]].

Historically, most European domestic basketball leagues have used a best-of-five format in their championship series. The main long-standing exceptions are the [[Israeli Basketball Super League|Israeli]] and [[LNB Pro A|French]] leagues, which have historically used one-off finals; the [[Liga ABA|Adriatic League]] (former Yugoslavia), which has changed from a one-off final to a best-of-three final back to a one-off final in recent years; and the [[Lietuvos Krepšinio Lyga|Lithuanian]], [[Dominet Bank Ekstraliga|Polish]] and [[Turkish Basketball League|Turkish]] leagues, which use a best-of-seven format. [[Serie A (basketball)|Italy]] has gone to a best-of-seven final effective with its [[Lega Basket Serie A 2008–09|2008–09 season]]. The [[Euroleague Basketball|Euroleague]] quarterfinal round expanded to best-of-five from best-of-three starting in the 2008-09 season. France changed its final from a one-off match to a best-of-5 series in [[2012–13 LNB Pro A season|2012–13]].

[[The Ashes]], a [[cricket]] series played between [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] and [[England cricket team|England]] is a five-match series. All games are held, and the team with the most wins the trophy. If the series is tied, the team holding the trophy keeps until the next series. Most [[test cricket]] matches are played under this format; others extend up to seven matches. Test cricket is typically hosted by one team throughout the entire series. While series such as this have five matches, it's not exactly "best-of-five", as [[Result (cricket)|draws, and other results]], are possible.

===Best-of-seven playoff===
A '''best-of-seven playoff''' is a competition between two teams head-to-head which must win four games to win the series. Four is chosen as it would constitute a majority of games played; whoever has won four games before all seven games have been played, all other games are omitted.

It is not necessary for the four games to be [[consecutive]]ly won. Draws are not permitted, even in sports where they usually would be - play continues until there is a clear winner (except in [[Nippon Professional Baseball|Japanese professional baseball]], where a standard (12-inning) draw is permitted at the [[Climax Series|stepladder league playoff]] (higher seed wins if series tied after the five or seven game series ends), and a 12-inning draw is permitted in the [[Japan Series]] in all but the eighth game, played only if the series is tied, 3-3-1, after seven games). This ensures that a series will never require more than seven games to conclude. Before the advent of lighting in ballparks ballgames often ended tied because it was too dark to play, a much less common way of ending a ballgame is going past the curfews.{{Clarify|date=August 2010}} Tied games can result in series lasting eight games, which has happened, as in the [[1912 World Series]] and the 1986 Japan Series. This format is currently used in the [[National Basketball Association]] and the [[National Hockey League]] for all their playoff series. [[Major League Baseball]] uses this format only for the [[League Championship Series]] since 1985 and the [[World Series]] from 1905 to 1918 and since 1922, using the "2-3-2" format, with two games at the home stadium of one team, the next three games (the fifth, if necessary) at the home stadium of the other team, and the final two games (if necessary) at the home stadium of the first. (The first round [[Wild Card Game]] is a single game; the second round [[Division Series]] use a five-game series format.)

The [[National Hockey League]] uses this format for its league championship [[Stanley Cup]] playoffs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=529012 Sample use in NHL press release] Published 12 May 2010. Accessed 26 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; but uses the "2-2-1-1-1" format, alternating the first two games at the home-ice team's home rink, the next two at the second team, and then alternating venues for the fifth, sixth and seventh games (if necessary).

The [[National Basketball Association]] has this format, too, with "2-2-1-1-1" for all playoff rounds, and also the [[NBA Finals|Finals]]; originally the championship round was "2-2-1-1-1" as well (except 1971, 1975, 1978-1979), but was changed to "2-3-2" from 1985-2013 to cut down on travel expenses, as the league's "[[Eastern Conference (NBA)|East]]-[[Western Conference (NBA)|West]]" divisional alignment means the two teams are usually separated by great distances - indeed, the cities represented in the Finals' [[Celtics–Lakers rivalry|most frequent matchup]], [[Los Angeles Lakers|Los Angeles]] and [[Boston Celtics|Boston]], are almost 3,000 miles apart.

The "2-3-2" format, the "2-2-1-1-1" format, and the "1-1-1-1-1-1-1" format are situated such that if a team "sweeps" the series (wins 4-0), it will win two games at home, and two games away. They are also set up such that the team with [[home advantage]] for the series plays at home for the first game and the seventh game if necessary. As previously stated, the "2-3-2" format reduces travel between the two venues, but it then gives the team "without" home advantage three consecutive home games. The "1-1-1-1-1-1-1" format is mainly used in the postseason tournaments of the [[Liiga]] in Finland and the [[Swedish Hockey League]].

The [[American Hockey League|AHL]] and the [[ECHL]] do not use a set playoff format for their league championship playoff tournaments due to scheduling conflicts. For example, in the [[2016 Calder Cup playoffs]], due to scheduling conflicts in both arenas, the Pacific Division finals between the [[Ontario Reign (AHL)|Ontario Reign]] and the [[San Diego Gulls]] used the "1-1-1-1-1-1-1" playoff format, with Ontario hosting the first, third, fifth, and seventh game.&lt;ref&gt;http://lakingsinsider.com/2016/04/30/ontario-san-diego-schedule-a-brutal-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-format/&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted earlier, the [[Chinese Basketball Association|Chinese]], [[Lega Basket Serie A|Italian]], [[Lietuvos krepšinio lyga|Lithuanian]], [[Polish Basketball League|Polish]] and [[Turkish Basketball League|Turkish]] basketball leagues use a best-of-seven format in their championship series. The Turkish playoff has one unique feature. If one team in the championship series (or, for that matter, in ''any'' playoff series) defeated its final opponent in both of their regular-season games, the winning team is granted a 1-0 lead in the series, and the series starts with Game 2. The [[Philippine Basketball Association|Philippine Basketball Association (PBA)]], aside from using the best-of-7 series in its finals series, has also used it on most its semifinals since 2005.

Occasionally, WWE uses this format in some of their matches, like the feud between [[Chris Benoit]] and [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] in 2005, for the [[WWE United States Championship]], or [[Antonio Cesaro|Cesaro]]'s rivalry against [[Sheamus]], with their first match at August pay-per-view [[SummerSlam (2016)|Summerslam 2016]].

===Best-of-nine playoff===
A '''best-of-nine playoff''' pits two teams head-to-head which must win five games to win the series. Five is chosen as it would constitute a majority of the games played. Whoever has won five games before all nine games have been played, all other games are omitted.

In [[Major League Baseball]], the [[World Series]] was conducted as a best-of-nine playoff in its first year of existence in [[1903 World Series|1903]], then again for three years beginning in [[1919 World Series|1919]], the year of the "[[Black Sox scandal]]."

The [[Western Hockey League]] used the best-of-nine playoff series for the Western Division playoffs from the 1983-84 season through the 1990-91 season because of the unequal division alignment of the league at this time.  The Eastern division had eight teams: six of which qualified for the playoffs. The Western division only had six teams: four of which made the playoffs.  Because of this, Eastern division had 3 rounds of playoffs (two teams receive a first round bye), while the Western division only had two rounds of playoffs.  The east played a best-of-five, best-of-seven, best-of-seven format for the three rounds while both rounds in the Western division playoffs were best-of-nine.  This was used so that both divisions would finish their playoffs at approximately the same time.  The WHL Championship Series was a best-of-seven.  These best-of-nine series went the full nine games on two occasions, with [[Portland Winterhawks|Portland]] defeating [[New Westminster Bruins|New Westminster]] in 1984 and [[Spokane Chiefs|Spokane]] in 1986.

The [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] used the best-of-nine playoff series for the 1986 playoffs.

===Higher number of games===
In [[snooker]], a player must win a certain number of frames to win a [[Snooker rules#A snooker match|match]], often nine (best-of-17) or more. Again, if one player wins nine frames before all 17 are played, the rest are omitted. The [[Snooker World Championship|world championship]] final is currently decided in a best-of-35 match.

In [[9-ball]], a player must win a certain number of racks to win a match. In the [[WPA World Nine-ball Championship]], nine racks are needed to win in the early stages, ten to eleven in the latter stages, and 17 in the final. As with snooker, if one player wins nine frames before all 17 are played, the rest are omitted.

==Total points series (aggregate)==
{{further|Two-legged tie}}
Various playoff formats, including [[two-legged tie]]s and '''total points series''' pair off participants in a number of games (often two), with the winner being determined by '''aggregate score''': the winner being the one who scores the most points/goals etc. over the series of games. Two-legged ties are common in [[association football]], and were used in [[NHL]] playoff series until 1937. It currently used in North America in the [[MLS Cup Playoffs]]. 

In [[2004 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2004]], [[NASCAR]] adopted a total points playoff of a different stripe, creating a "[[NASCAR playoffs|Chase for the Cup]]" that allowed a golf-style cut of the high ten or 400 points of the leader, whichever is greater, to compete for the championship in the last ten races. The Chase format has changed several times since its creation:
* In the [[2007 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2007 season]], the Chase was expanded to include the top 12 drivers after 26 races. The points of the drivers in the cut are elevated far beyond those of the pack. From [[2007 Chase for the NEXTEL Cup|2007]] to [[2010 Chase for the Sprint Cup|2010]], each Chase driver received 5,000 points, with a 10-point bonus for each race won prior to the Chase.
* Starting in [[2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2011]], the points system and Chase qualification criteria were significantly changed. Through the [[2013 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2013 season]], the top 10 drivers after 26 races automatically qualified for the Chase, joined by the two drivers with the most race wins among those ranked between 11th and 20th in points after 26 races. Reflecting a major change to the points system, in which the race winner can now earn a maximum of 48 points as opposed to 195 in the former system, driver points were reset to a base of 2,000. After the reset, automatic qualifiers received 3 bonus points for each race win, while the wild card qualifiers did not receive a bonus for wins. In the 2013 season, a 13th driver ([[Jeff Gordon]]) was added to the Chase following [[2013 Federated Auto Parts 400#The Singapore Sling and Team Orders Controversy|a major scandal]] in the [[2013 Federated Auto Parts 400|final pre-Chase race]] in which two teams were found to have extensively manipulated the race results in the final laps. 
* The [[2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2014 season]] introduced a radically different format, although the basic points system remains identical to that in the 2011–2013 period. Under the current system, the Monster Energy field, now officially called the "Monster Energy Grid", consists of 16 drivers. These drivers are chosen primarily on the basis of race wins during the first 26 races, provided that said drivers are in the top 30 in series points and have attempted to qualify for each race (barring injuries). The points leader is assured of a place on the Grid, but only if he does not have a race win. Any remaining spots on the Grid are filled in order of driver points. The format from this point is radically different—the Chase is now divided into four rounds, with three races in each of the first three rounds and a one-race finale.
** As in the 2011–2013 format, initial driver points are reset to 2,000 with a 3-point bonus for each win. All 16 Grid drivers compete to remain in the Chase for the first three Chase races, known as the "Challenger Round". After these races, the four lowest-placed drivers on the Grid are eliminated; they retain their points from the previous races and accumulate points in the remaining races based on the regular-season scoring system (this also applies to drivers eliminated at later stages). The winner of each of the first three races automatically advances to the next round of the Chase.
** The next round, the "Contender Round", starts with 12 drivers, each with 3,000 points but with no win bonus. As in the Challenger Round, the winner of each race in this round advances to the next round. As in the previous round, the four drivers with the lowest points total after this round are eliminated.
** The third round, the "Eliminator Round", starts with eight drivers, each with 4,000 points, again with no win bonus. As in the previous rounds, the winner of each race in this round advances to the next round. Again, the four drivers with the lowest points total after this round are eliminated.
** The last race of the season starts with four drivers still in contention for the championship; each starts the race with 5,000 points. The highest finisher of the four becomes Monster Energy Cup champion.

Regardless of the exact format, the driver in the Chase group with the most points after the final ten races wins the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Monster Energy Cup]].

In [[2005 PGA Tour|November 2005]], the [[PGA Tour]] announced that a similar total points playoff would be used to lead up to the [[PGA Championship]], starting in [[2007 PGA Tour|2007]]. The player with the most points at the end of the year would take home the [[FedEx Cup]].

Prior to the 1986 Playoffs, the Canadian Hockey League (especially the Ontario Hockey League) used the point series, to determine, which team would advance. In those situation, where the higher seeded host in odd number of game (game #1, 3, 5, 7), while the other team host the even number (game #2, 4, 6, 8). There would be no overtime, except for the deciding game, because a tie in the last game, of the series would not declare a series winner, so should that happens, there would be a sudden-death overtime, with the winner getting 2 points, and the losing team get nothing.

The game shows ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', and ''[[The Challengers (game show)|The Challengers]]'' have used two-game series in the final rounds of most of the tournaments that they held during their history. Each game is played separately (i.e., money from day one cannot be wagered on day two), and the money is added together to determine the winner. The only exception to this was in the [[Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions|''Jeopardy!'' Ultimate Tournament of Champions]], when the two semifinal matches were both two-game series, and the final was a three-game series. If any ties remain, [[sudden death (sports)|sudden death]] was played to determine the champion.

===Example===
As it was used in the [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League knockout stage]]:

}}
''Bayern Munich 4–4 Real Madrid on aggregate. Bayern Munich won on [[away goals rule|away goals]] (BM 2–1 RM).''

==Round robin==
{{Main article|Round-robin tournament}}
In a '''round-robin tournament''', all playoff contenders play each other an equal number of times, usually once or twice (often called a "double round-robin"). This is a common format for [[association football]]. In the [[FIFA World Cup]], teams are organized into eight pools of four teams, playing each other once and ranked by points earned through wins (3 points) and draws (1 point). The top two teams advance out of each pool to the knockout phase where the top team from each pool face a second-placed team from a different pool.

Continental club football tournaments have included round robin formats, such as the [[Copa Libertadores]] from the 1966 season, [[UEFA Champions League]] from the 1992/93 season, [[UEFA Cup]] from 2004/05, and the [[AFC Champions League|Asian]] and [[CAF Champions League|African]] Champions Leagues. Teams are seeded such that strongest teams should not meet until the end. In the UEFA Champions League, 32 teams are divided into eight groups of four. The group winners and runners-up advance to a two-game, total goals round, the eight third-placed teams move into the UEFA Cup third round, and the eight fourth-placed teams are eliminated.

In [[basketball]], the [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]] also uses a round robin of the same nature, going to single elimination after the first round. The Euroleague has two double round-robin phases. The first is a "Regular Season" in which the 24 teams are divided into four groups of six (as of the 2008-09 season). The four top teams in each group advance to a "Top 16" phase in which the teams are divided into four groups of four each. The top two teams from each Top 16 group are then paired in four best-of-five quarterfinal series, with the winners advancing to the single-elimination Final Four.

Round-robin tournaments are also used in [[rugby union]], [[curling]], and many amateur or lower-division basketball, football, and hockey tournaments.

In 1992, the [[Little League World Series]] in youth baseball went to a round-robin tournament in the first round instead of single-elimination. In 2001, the tournament expanded to 16 teams and stayed with a round-robin for the first round, but cross-bracketed single elimination for the second round before the two winners of those games advanced to the region final. Little League used this format through 2009.

In [[Major League Baseball]], the term "round robin" was used with regard to the possibility of a 3-way tie for the [[1964 in baseball|National League pennant in 1964]].  The [[Philadelphia Phillies]] had had a 6½ game lead with 12 games left in their regular schedule, but then lost 10 games in a row, so that the season went into its last day with 3 teams still having a chance for the NL pennant.  As it turns out, the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] defeated the [[New York Mets]] on that day to take the NL pennant with no playoff; the reverse of that outcome would have left the Cardinals, the Phillies, and the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in a 3-way tie.

==Associated concepts==
As discussed above, leagues also offer innovations in order to give advantage to teams that performed better in the regular season, such as reseeding and home advantage.

===Reseeding===
In tournaments where participants are seeded, in order to ensure that the strongest remaining team faces the weakest team, the participants are "reseeded" at each round; the tournament bracket is not fixed, where potential matchups can be readily determined up to the final. For example, in a regular 8-team bracket, the teams that will meet at the second round will be the winner of the #1 vs. #8 going up against the winner of #4 and #5, and the winner of #2 and #7 going up against the winner of #3 and #6. If the #5 and the #7 teams won in the first round, the second round matchups will be #1 vs. #7 and #3 vs. #5, instead of #1 vs. #5 and #3 vs. #7.

The only notable tournaments that employ this rule are the NFL Playoffs, [[WNBA Playoffs]] and the MLS Cup Playoffs. The Stanley Cup Playoffs had used that rule from 1994-2013. Note that reseeding does not come into play if there are only 2 rounds of competition.

====Example====
As it was used in the [[1994 Stanley Cup playoffs]] (scores in the bracket shown indicate the number of games won in each seven-game series):
{{1994 Stanley Cup playoffs}}

===Home advantage===
In team sports, the "[[home advantage|hometown advantage]]" refers to the phenomenon when certain teams (usually the higher-seeded teams) are afforded more games that can be played at their home arena/stadium than their opponent's. This is predominant in the best-of series where there are more games played in a team's arena/stadium than the other, and in single-elimination tournaments where the single game is disputed in a team's stadium. In a best-of series, a team can "lose" their home advantage if the visiting team wins the first game. Home advantage can be regained or lost in the course of the series.

As discussed above, a team can clinch the "home advantage" in a variety of ways:
*Clinching the higher seed (MLB, NHL and NFL)
*Winning more games than the opponent, but not necessarily clinching the higher seed (NBA)

In best-of series, the order of arenas/stadiums in which the games are played at also affects the home advantage. In the NBA and the NHL, all rounds are done in a 2-2-1-1-1 format, that is, the team with home advantage plays games 1-2, 5 and 7 (latter two games if needed). This ensures that the team with home advantage never trails assuming every game is won by the home team. From [[1985 NBA Finals|1985]] to [[2013 NBA Finals|2013]] the NBA Finals had utilised the 2-3-2 format (the team with the home court advantage plays games 1-2 and 6-7 in their home court), which can theoretically allow the team with the home court advantage to trail in the series (although that will require the team with the home court advantage to lose the middle three games, which has only happened thrice).

In NHL's Stanley Cup Finals, NBA Finals, and MLB's World Series, the teams with the higher regular season record receives the home advantage. The NFL's Super Bowl is held at a predetermined site regardless of which teams reach the game, which usually means there is no home advantage but it is still possible for the host city's team to play in the Super Bowl. Until 2016, In MLB's World Series, the team that came from the league that won the All-Star Game is awarded with the home field advantage.

In [[two-legged tie]]s such as the [[UEFA Champions League]], although it is said that the two teams play an equal number of games in their home stadium, the team playing the second game in their home stadium has a distinct advantage,{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} such as the resolution of ties will be at their stadium.

In games done on neutral venues, a team may still be afforded the privileges of the "home team" such as selecting which side to play first or choosing the side of the coin in coin flips. In most instances, this privilege is determined either by a drawing of lots (UEFA Champions League) or by rotation among the groupings of the different teams (NFL).

In the [[Nippon Professional Baseball]]'s postseason games (excluding [[Japan Series]]) since 2004, the team having a better position in regular position will be hosting all the games. In addition, since 2008, the League Champion will have a 1-win advantage in the 2nd stage of Climax Series (best-of-7 which actually played for 6 games).

'''Political lesbianism''' is a phenomenon within [[feminism]], primarily [[second-wave feminism]] and [[radical feminism]]; it includes, but is not limited to, [[lesbian separatism]]. Political lesbianism embraces the theory that [[sexual orientation]] is a political and feminist choice, and advocates [[lesbian]]ism as a positive alternative to [[heterosexuality]] for women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Julie |last=Bindel |url=https://www.theguardian.com/weekend/story/0,3605,1177708,00.html |title=Location, location, orientation |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=27 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the struggle against sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Krebs |first=Paula |title=Lesbianism as a Political Strategy |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/197156630?accountid=14696 |publisher=Off Our Backs 17.6 |accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Political lesbianism originated in the late 1960s among [[Second-wave feminism|second wave]] [[radical feminists]] as a way to fight sexism and [[compulsory heterosexuality]]. [[Sheila Jeffreys]] helped to develop the concept when she co-wrote in 1981 "Love Your Enemy? The Debate Between Heterosexual Feminism and Political Lesbianism"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeffreys|first=Sheila|title=Love Your Enemy? The Debate Between Heterosexual Feminism and Political Lesbianism|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3dD4VR6trTUMzYzZTExNmMtY2FlMC00MjlhLTg1ZjItYjFhNGMzMWNlMGIx/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CN6ixb8C&amp;pli=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with the [[Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group]]. They argued that women should abandon support of heterosexuality and stop sleeping with men, while encouraging women to rid men "from your beds and your heads".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/30/women-gayrights |title=My sexual revolution | last=Bindel | first=Julie |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=30 January 2009 |accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the main idea of political lesbianism is to be separate from men, this does not necessarily mean that political lesbians ''have'' to sleep with women; some choose to be [[celibate]] or identify as [[asexuality|asexual]]. The Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group definition of a political lesbian is "a woman identified woman who does not fuck men". They proclaimed men the enemy and women who were in relationships with them collaborators and complicit in their own oppression. Heterosexual behavior is seen as the basic unit of the [[patriarchy]]'s political structure, lesbians who reject heterosexual behavior therefore disrupt the established political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bunch|first=Charlotte|title=Lesbians in Revolt|url=http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/scriptorium/wlm/furies/|publisher=The Furies: Lesbian/Feminist Monthly|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ti-Grace Atkinson]], a radical feminist who helped to found the group [[The Feminists]], is credited with the phrase that came to embody the movement: 'Feminism is the theory; lesbianism is the practice.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koedt|first=Anne|title=Lesbianism and Feminism|url=http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUArchive/lesbianfeminism.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104333/http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUArchive/lesbianfeminism.html|archivedate=2015-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Feminism is the theory, lesbianism is the practice." (Chicago Women's Liberation Union pamphlet, Lesbianism and Feminism, 1971; Stevi Jackson, Sue Scott, Feminism and Sexuality: A Reader, Columbia University Press, 1996, p. 282)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shared Interest==
New wave feminism {{Definition|reason='New Wave Feminism' is not a clear term and is not aligned with 'Second Wave Feminism'|date=May 2015}} provided a platform for some women to come out of a perceived suffocating shell of [[heterosexual]] norms, traditional [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[marriage]] and family life, a life viewed by some feminists{{according to whom|reason=which feminists are these?|date=May 2015}} as one of hard labor with little consideration and a system that subordinates women. By coming out of dominating heterosexual relationships, [[women]] are given an opportunity to declare themselves as lesbians with shared interests. As a result, feminism would be able to provide an environment in which lesbianism was less about personal pain or anguish but an important political issue.

In a broad sense, [[political]] lesbianism entails the political identification of women with women, it encompasses a role beyond sexuality but supports eschewing forming relationships with men. It is partly based on the idea that women sharing and promoting a common interest creates a positive and needed energy which is necessary to enhance and elevate the role of women in the society, a development which will be curtailed by the institutions of heterosexuality and [[sexism]] if women choose the traditional norms.

Though there was some discrimination against lesbians within the feminist movement, it ended up providing a needed political platform for them.  In its wake, it also expanded and introduced  divergent views of sexuality.&lt;ref name="Ramazanoglu"&gt;Ramazanoglu; Routledge, Feminism and the Contradictions of Oppression, Routledge, 1989. pp 84–86&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lesbian separatism==
[[Separatist feminism]] is a form of [[radical feminism]] that holds that opposition to [[patriarchy]] is best done through focusing exclusively on women and girls.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Skelton, [[Becky Francis]], ''Feminism and the Schooling Scandal'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 2009 {{ISBN|0-415-45510-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-45510-7}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=AbWRPIevJOwC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=Separatist+feminism&amp;ei=CGPRSuuFDaCMygTNiqWQDg#v=onepage&amp;q=Separatist%20feminism&amp;f=false p. 104].&lt;/ref&gt;  Some separatist feminists do not believe that men can make positive contributions to the [[feminist movement]] and that even well-intentioned men replicate the dynamics of [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah Hoagland]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=ljaGAAAAIAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Lesbian Ethics: toward new value''], p. 60, 154, 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charlotte Bunch]], an early member of [[The Furies Collective]], viewed separatist feminism as a strategy, a "first step" period, or temporary withdrawal from mainstream activism to accomplish specific goals or enhance [[Personal development|personal growth]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Flora. Moving the Mountain: The Women's Movement in America since 1960, University of Illinois Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-252-06782-7}}, p271&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Furies'' recommended that Lesbian Separatists relate "only (with) women who cut their ties to [[male privilege]]"&lt;ref name="Bunch 1972, pp.8-9"&gt;Bunch, Charlotte/The Furies Collective, "Lesbians in Revolt", in ''The Furies: Lesbian/Feminist Monthly'', vol. 1, January 1972, pp.8–9&lt;/ref&gt; and suggest that "as long as women still benefit from heterosexuality, receive its privileges and security, they will at some point have to betray their sisters, especially Lesbian sisters who do not receive those benefits".&lt;ref name="Bunch 1972, pp.8-9"/&gt;

==Social constructs of sexuality and criticism==
Some feminist theory on sexuality evaded [[biological]] fixation and embraced [[social]] construction as the basis of sexuality. However, this idea posed further questions on the subject of sexuality and lesbianism. If sexuality could be a construction of [[human nature]] then little room is given to understanding the nature of the historical formation of human nature, especially, if the historical nature of man or woman enhanced heterosexuality.&lt;ref name=Ramazanoglu /&gt;  A lack of [[theoretical]] clarity of lesbianism and sexuality becomes more profound as sexuality is viewed as much more than choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Answers to Your Questions For a Better Understanding of sexual  orientation &amp; Homosexuality|url=http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/orientation.aspx#|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychiatry and LGB People|url=http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/workinpsychiatry/specialinterestgroups/gaylesbian/submissiontothecofe/psychiatryandlgbpeople.aspx#history|publisher=Royal College of Psychiatrists|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, if lesbianism becomes a [[social institution]], the avenue for a dominant persona in the relationships may also pose challenge to the original intention of political lesbianism.

'''Ramchandra Narayan Dandekar''' (1909–2001) was an [[Indologist]] and  [[Vedas|Vedic]] scholar from [[Maharashtra]], [[India]].

He was born in [[Satara (city)|Satara]] on 17 March 1909 and died in Pune on 11 December 2001.

==Education==

Dandekar earned an M.A. in [[Sanskrit]] in 1931, and an M.A. in Ancient Indian Culture in 1933, both from [[Bombay University]] (renamed some years ago as Mumbai University). He joined [[Fergusson College]] in [[Pune]] in 1933 as a professor of Sanskrit and Ancient Indian Culture. In 1936, he went to [[Germany]] for further studies and received his doctoral degree from [[Heidelberg University]] in 1938 for his thesis ''Der Vedish Mensh''.

==Career==
Upon his return from Germany, Dandekar continued to teach at Fergusson College. In 1950, he was appointed Professor of Sanskrit and Head of the Department of [[Sanskrit]] and [[Prakrit]] Languages at the [[University of Poona]] (renamed some years ago as University of Pune). He served as the Dean of the Faculty of Arts during 1959-1965. In 1964, he became the Director of the Center of Advanced Study in Sanskrit at the University of Poona, and served in that capacity until 1974.

In 1939, Dandekar had become the Honorary Secretary of the renowned [[Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute]] (BORI), and he continued to function in that capacity till 1994, effectively running the Institute for fifty-five years. From 1994 until his death in 2001, he served as the vice-president of the Institute.

Dandekar was closely associated with numerous Indian and international organizations related to [[Indology]], and he served and shaped these organizations in various manners. They included  the All India Oriental Conference, the International Congress of Orientalists, the World Sanskrit Conference, the Sanskrit Commission of the Government of India, and the Deccan College. He served as an adviser on Indology at [[UNESCO]].

Along with a large number of other publications, Dandekar published a monumental six-volume ''Vedic Suchi'' (Vedic bibliography) in 1946.

==Honors==
Dandekar received many honors and awards, including the [[Padmabhushan]] title in 1962 from the President of India,&lt;ref name="Padma Awards"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf | title=Padma Awards | publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India | date=2015 | accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[List of Sahitya Akademi fellows|Sahitya Akademi Fellowship]] in 2000.

The [[orthography]] of [[French language|French]] was already more or less fixed and, from a [[Phonology|phonological]] point of view, outdated when its [[lexicography]] developed in the late 17th century and the [[Académie française]] was mandated to establish an "official" [[Prescription and description|prescriptive norm]].

Still, there was already much debate at the time opposing the tenets of a traditional, etymological orthography, and those of a [[Spelling reform|reformed]], phonological [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] of the language.

[[César-Pierre Richelet]] chose the latter option when he published the first monolingual French [[dictionary]] in 1680, but the {{lang|fr|Académie}} chose to adhere firmly to the tradition, "that distinguishes men of letters from ignoramuses and simple women",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cahiers de remarques sur l'orthographe françoise |last=Marty-Laveaux |first=Charles-Joseph |author-link=Charles Joseph Marty-Laveaux |year=1863 |publisher=Jules Gay |location=Paris |page=ix |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u5Y5AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR9 |language=fr |quote=''La Compagnie d{{as written|e}}clare qu’elle d{{as written|e}}sire sui{{as written|u}}re l’an{{shy}}cienne orthographe qui distingue les gens de lettres {{as written|dauec}} les ignorants et les simples femmes, et qu’il faut la maintenir par tout hormis dans les mots ou un long et constant usage en aura introduit une contraire.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the first edition of [[Dictionnaire de l'Académie française|its dictionary]] (1694).

==16th century==
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}
Spelling and punctuation before the 16th century was highly erratic, but [[Global spread of the printing press#France|the introduction of printing in 1470]] provoked the need for uniformity.

Several Renaissance humanists (working with publishers) proposed reforms in French orthography, the most famous being [[Jacques Peletier du Mans]] who developed a phonemic-based spelling system and introduced new typographic signs (1550).  Peletier continued to use his system in all his published works, but his reform was not followed.

==18th century==

{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}
:''{{lang|fr|L'Acad'''é'''mie s'eſt donc v'''û'''e contrainte '''à''' faire dans cette nouvelle Edition, '''à''' ſon orthographe, pluſieurs changemens qu'elle n'avoit point jug'''é''' '''à''' propos d'adopter, lorſqu'elle donna l'Edition pr'''é'''c'''é'''dente.}}''—Académie, 1740, using accents for the first time

The third (1740) and fourth (1762) [[edition (book)|editions]] of the Académie dictionary were very progressive ones, changing the spelling of about half the words altogether.

[[Diacritic|Accents]], which had been in common use by [[Printing|printers]] for a long time, were finally adopted by the Académie, and many [[silent letter|mute consonant]]s were dropped.

:''{{wiktfra|estre}}'' → ''{{wiktfra|être}}'' (to be)
:''{{wiktfra|monachal}}'' → ''{{wiktfra|monacal}}'' (monastic)

Many changes suggested in the fourth edition were later abandoned along with thousands of [[neologism]]s added to it.

Very importantly too, subsequent 18th century editions of the dictionary added the letters ''[[J]]'' and ''[[V]]'' to the [[French alphabet]] in replacement of consonant ''[[I]]'' and ''[[U]],'' fixing many cases of [[Homonym|homography]].

:''{{wiktfra|uil}}'' → ''{{wiktfra|vil}}'' (vile)

==19th century==

Many changes were introduced in the sixth edition of the Académie dictionary (1835), mainly under the influence of [[Voltaire]]. Most importantly, all ''oi'' [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s that represented {{IPA|/ɛ/}} were changed to ''ai,'' thus changing the whole [[imperfect]] [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] of all [[verb]]s.  The [[loanword|borrowing]] of ''[[wikt:connoisseur|connoisseur]]'' into English predates this change; the modern French spelling is ''{{wiktfr|connaisseur}}''.

:''{{wiktfra|étois}}'' → ''{{wiktfra|étais}}'' (was)

The spelling of some plural words whose singular form ended in ''D'' and ''T'' was modified to reinsert this mute consonant, so as to bring the plural in morphological alignment with the singular. Only ''{{lang|fr|gent}}, {{lang|fr|gens}}'' retained the old form, because it was perceived that the singular and the plural had different meanings. The Académie had already tried to introduce a similar reform in 1694, but had given up with their dictionary's second edition.

:''{{wiktfra|parens}}'' → ''{{wiktfra|parents}}'' (parents)

==20th century==

With important dictionaries published at the turn of the 20th century, such as those of [[Maximilien-Paul-Émile Littré|Émile Littré]], [[Pierre Larousse]], [[Arsène Darmesteter]], and later [[Dictionnaires Le Robert|Paul Robert]], the Académie gradually lost much of its prestige.

Hence, new reforms suggested in 1901, 1935, and 1975 were almost totally ignored, except for the replacement of [[Apostrophe (mark)|apostrophes]] with [[hyphen]]s in some cases of (potential) [[elision]] in 1935.

:''{{wiktfra|grand'mère}}'' → ''{{wiktfra|grand-mère}}'' (grandmother)

Since the 1970s, though, calls for the modernisation of French orthography have grown stronger. In 1989, [[French prime minister]] [[Michel Rocard]] appointed the [[Conseil supérieur de la langue française (France)|Superior Council of the French language]] to simplify the orthography by regularising it.

===Rectifications of 1990 {{anchor|1990}}{{anchor|The rectifications of 1990}}=== &lt;!-- Courtesy note per [[MOS:LINK2SECT]], [[Grand dictionnaire terminologique]] R's to anchor "1990". --&gt;

The Council, with the help of some Académie members and observers from [[La Francophonie|Francophone]] states, published reforms that it called ''"{{lang|fr|rectifications orthographiques}}"'' on 6 December 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010303014029/http://www.academie-francaise.fr/langue/orthographe/plan.html|title=Rectifications de l'orthographe-J.O. du 6-12-1990|date=2001-03-03|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-19|title=Rectifications orthographiques du français en 1990|url=https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rectifications_orthographiques_du_fran%C3%A7ais_en_1990&amp;oldid=146595661|journal=Wikipédia|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those "rectifications", instead of changing individual spellings, published general rules or lists of modified words. In total, around 2000 words have seen their spelling changed, and French [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] was also affected.

====Hyphens====

Numerals are joined with hyphens:

:''{{lang|fr|sept cent mille trois cent vingt et un}}'' → ''{{lang|fr|sept-cent-mille-trois-cent-vingt-et-un}}'' (700,321).

Elements of [[Compound (linguistics)|compound nouns]] are fused together:
*if one element is a verb: ''{{wiktfra|porte-monnaie}}'' → ''{{wiktfra|portemonnaie}}'' (wallet)
*in [[bahuvrihi]] compounds (where the individual sense of the elements has changed): ''{{wiktfra|sage-femme}}'' → ''{{wiktfra|sagefemme}}'' (midwife)
*in [[onomatopoeia]]s: ''{{wiktfra|coin coin}}'' → ''{{wiktfra|coincoin}}'' (quack).

[[Loanword|Loan]] compounds are also fused together:

:''{{wiktfra|hot-dog}}'' → ''{{wiktfra|hotdog}}'' (hot dog).
:''{{wiktfra|week-end}}'' → ''{{wiktfra|weekend}}'', aligning the word with its modern English spelling.

====Number====

Compound nouns joined with hyphens (or fused) make their [[plural]] using normal rules, that is adding a final ''s'' or ''x'', unless the modifier is an adjective (in which case both elements must agree), or the head is a [[determiner (linguistics)|determined]] [[noun]], or a proper noun:

:''{{lang|fr|des pèse-lettre}}'' → ''{{lang|fr|des pèse-lettres}}'' (letter scales)

Loanwords also have a regular plural:

:''{{wiktfra|lieder}}'' → ''{{wiktfra|lieds}}'' (songs)

====''{{lang|fr|Tréma}}''====
The ''{{lang|fr|tréma}}'' (known as a [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] in English) indicating exceptionally that the ''u'' is not silent in ''{{lang|fr|gu}} + vowel'' combinations is to be placed on the ''u'' instead of on the following vowel. Also, trémas are added to such words where they were not previously used:

:''{{lang|fr|aiguë}}'' → ''{{lang|fr|aigüe}}'' {{IPA-fr|eɡy|}} (''fem.'' acute)
:''{{lang|fr|ambiguïté}}'' → ''{{lang|fr|ambigüité}}'' {{IPA-fr|ɑ̃biɡɥite|}} (ambiguity)
:''{{lang|fr|arguer}}'' → ''{{lang|fr|argüer}}'' {{IPA-fr|aʁɡɥe|}} (to argue)

A {{lang|fr|tréma}} is also added to a ''u'' following an ''{{lang|fr|e muet}}'' added to soften a ''g'', to prevent the ''eu'' combination being read as {{IPA-fr|œ|}}:

:''{{lang|fr|gageure}}'' → ''{{lang|fr|gageüre}}'' {{IPA-fr|ɡaʒyʁ|}} (wager)

====Accents====

Verbs with their [[infinitive]] in ''éCer'' (where C can be any consonant) change their ''[[acute accent|é]]'' to ''[[grave accent|è]]'' in the [[future tense|future]] and [[conditional tense|conditional]]:

:''{{lang|fr|je céderai}}'' → ''{{lang|fr|je cèderai}}'' {{IPA-fr|ʒə sɛd(ə)ʁe|}} (I shall give up)

Additionally, verbs ending in ''e'' placed before an [[word order|inverted]] [[subject (grammar)|subject]] "je" change their ''e'' to ''è'' instead of ''é'':

:''{{lang|fr|aimé-je&amp;thinsp;?}}'' → ''{{lang|fr|aimè-je&amp;thinsp;?}}'' {{IPA-fr|ɛmɛʒ|}} (do I like?)

[[Circumflex]] accents are removed on ''i'' and ''u'' if they are not needed to distinguish between homographs. They are retained in the [[preterite|simple past]] and [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] of verbs:

:''{{lang|fr|mû}}'' → ''{{lang|fr|mu}}'' (driven), but ''{{lang|fr|qu'il mût}}'' unchanged (he must have driven), and
:''{{lang|fr|dû}}'' (the past participle of the very common irregular verb ''{{lang|fr|devoir}}'', or the noun created from this participle) is kept to make the distinction with ''{{lang|fr|du}}'' (the required contraction of ''{{lang|fr|de + le}}'', which means ''some'' when used as an undetermined masculine article, or means ''of the'' when used as a preposition).

Wherever accents are missing or wrong because of past errors or omissions or a change of pronunciation, they are added or changed:

:''{{lang|fr|receler}}'' → ''{{lang|fr|recéler}}'' {{IPA-fr|ʁəsele|}} (to receive&amp;nbsp;– stolen goods)
:''{{lang|fr|événement}}'' → ''{{lang|fr|évènement}}'' {{IPA-fr|evɛn(ə)mɑ̃|}} (event)

Accents are also added to loanwords where dictated by French pronunciation:

:''{{lang|fr|diesel}}'' → ''{{lang|fr|diésel}}'' {{IPA-fr|djezɛl|}} (diesel)

====Schwa changing into open ''e''====

In verbs with an infinitive in ''{{lang|fr|-eler}}'' or ''{{lang|fr|-eter}}'', the [[vowel height|opening]] of the [[schwa]] could previously be noted either by changing the ''e'' to ''è'' or by doubling the following ''l'' or ''t'', depending on the verb in question. With this reform, only the first rule shall be used except in the cases of ''{{lang|fr|appeler}}'', ''{{lang|fr|jeter}}'', and their [[derivation (linguistics)|derivatives]] (which continue to use ''ll'' and ''tt'' respectively).
&lt;!-- (unnecessary historical detail) This is caused by the fact that the historic gemination of consonants (in conjugated verbs where the final schwa desinences became silent) is no longer pronounced and has been replaced by opening the preceding vowel in standard French phonology. To keep the spelling without a written double consonant, the accent becomes necessary to keep the vowel open.--&gt;

:''{{lang|fr|j'étiquette}}'' → ''{{lang|fr|j'étiquète}}'' (I label)

This applies also when those verbs are nominalized using the [[suffix]] ''{{lang|fr|-ement}}'':

:''{{lang|fr|amoncellement}}'' → ''{{lang|fr|amoncèlement}}'' (pile)

====Past participle agreement====

Notwithstanding the normal rules (see [[French verbs#Past participle agreement|French verbs]]), the past [[participle]] ''{{lang|fr|laissé}}'' followed by an infinitive never agrees with the [[object (linguistics)|object]]:

:''{{lang|fr|je les ai laissés partir}}'' → ''{{lang|fr|je les ai laissé partir}}'' (I let them go)

This is an alleged simplification of the rules governing the agreement as applied to a past participle followed by an infinitive. The participle ''{{lang|fr|fait}}'' already followed an identical rule.

====Miscellaneous====

Many phenomena were considered as "anomalies" and thus "corrected". Some "families" of words from the same root showing inconsistent spellings were uniformized on the model of the most usual word in the "family".

:''{{lang|fr|imbécillité}}'' → ''{{lang|fr|imbécilité}}'' (idiocy)

This rule was also extended to suffixes in two cases, actually changing them into totally different [[morpheme]]s altogether:

:''{{lang|fr|cuissot}}'' → ''{{lang|fr|cuisseau}}'' (haunch)
:''{{lang|fr|levraut}}'' → ''{{lang|fr|levreau}}'' (leveret)

Isolated words were adjusted to follow older reform where they had been omitted:

:''{{lang|fr|douceâtre}}'' → ''{{lang|fr|douçâtre}}'' (sickly sweet)
:''{{lang|fr|oignon}}'' → ''{{lang|fr|ognon}}'' (onion)

Lastly, some words have simply seen their spelling simplified, or fixed when it was uncertain:

:''{{lang|fr|pagaïe/pagaille/pagaye}}'' → ''{{lang|fr|pagaille}}'' (mess)
:''{{lang|fr|punch}}'' → ''{{lang|fr|ponch}}'' ([[punch (drink)|punch]])

====Application====

These "rectifications" were supposed to be applied beginning in 1991 but, following a period of agitation and the publication of many books such as the Union of copy editors' attacking new rules one by one, [[André Goosse]]'s defending them, or [[Josette Rey-Debove]]'s accepting a few (that have been added, as alternative spellings, to [[Dictionnaires Le Robert|Le Robert]]), they appeared to have become, for a while, dead proposals.

==21st century==
In 2004, an international institutional effort to revive the 1990 spelling reforms arose. Notably, a French-[[Belgium|Belgian]]-[[Switzerland|Swiss]] association was set up to promote reform. In July of the same year, [[Microsoft]] announced that the French version of their applications would soon comply with the new spelling rules. On 23 March 2005, a version of [[Encarta]] was published using the new spelling, and, on 14 April 2005, an update of [[Microsoft Office]] was offered.

Officially, [[French people]], including public workers, are free for an undetermined length of time to continue using the old spelling. The new spelling is "recommended", but both old and new are considered correct.

In [[Quebec]], the {{lang|fr|[[Office québécois de la langue française]]}}, which was reluctant at first to apply what it prefers to call the "modernisation", because of the opposition it received in France, announced that it was now applying its rules to new borrowings and neologisms.

More and more publications are modernizing spelling. Le Forum, from the Université de Montréal, and Les Éditions Perce-Neige have adopted the new spelling.

In 2009, several major Belgian publishing groups began applying the new spelling in their online publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfwb.be/index.php?id=portail_detail_actualite&amp;tx_ttnews%5btt_news%5d=453 |title=Le 16 mars, la presse belge passe à la "&amp;thinsp;nouvelle orthographe&amp;thinsp;" |accessdate=2009-03-14 |language=French |publisher=Communauté française de Belgique |date=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 edition of the {{lang|fr|[[Dictionnaires Le Robert|Dictionnaire Le Robert]]}} incorporates most of the changes.  There are 6000 words that have both the traditional and alternative spellings. The 2011 edition of the Dictionnaire Larousse incorporates all of the changes.

On February 3, 2016, a report by French television channel TF1&lt;ref&gt;[http://lci.tf1.fr/france/societe/reforme-orthographique-10-mots-qui-vont-changer-a-la-rentree-8712574.html (in French) Réforme de l'orthographe: 10 mots qui vont changer à la rentrée]&lt;/ref&gt; that the reforms would be applied from the next school year caused wide outrage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/05/not-the-oignon-fury-france-changes-2000-spellings-ditches-circumflex|title=Not the oignon: fury as France changes 2,000 spellings and drops some accents|last=Willsher|first=Kim|date=2016-02-05|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35615603|title=French furore over spelling continues|last=Schofield|first=Hugh|date=2016-02-20|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/french-language-reform-becomes-a-cause-c%C3%A9l%C3%A8bre-1.2528683|title=French language reform becomes a cause célèbre|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there is a movement driven by the linguist [[Mickael Korvin]] who battles to radically simplify French, first by eliminating accents, punctuation and capital letters, then attacking the French literary establishment, and in 2016 inventing a new way to spell French called nouvofrancet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.enviedecrire.com/mickael-korvin-veut-simplifier-la-langue-francaise/|title=Mickael Korvin veut simplifier la langue française|date=2012-04-30|website=Enviedecrire|language=fr|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Taa''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɑː}}, also known as '''ǃXóõ''' (ǃKhong, ǃXoon – &lt;small&gt;pronounced&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-all|ǃ͡χɔ̃ː˦|}},&lt;ref&gt;The proper pronunciation of “ǃXóõ” can be heard in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zrek3r29HvE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=16s this recording], repeated from 0’16” to 0’24”.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|k|oʊ}}&lt;ref&gt;Alan Barnard (…) ''Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa'', p.xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;), is a [[Tuu language]] notable for its large number of [[phoneme]]s, perhaps the largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/world/what-in-the-world/click-languages-taa-xoon-xoo-botswana.html?module=WatchingPortal&amp;region=c-column-middle-span-region&amp;pgType=Homepage&amp;action=click&amp;mediaId=thumb_square&amp;state=standard&amp;contentPlacement=8&amp;version=internal&amp;contentCollection=www.nytimes.com&amp;contentId=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F11%2F25%2Fworld%2Fwhat-in-the-world%2Fclick-languages-taa-xoon-xoo-botswana.html&amp;eventName=Watching-article-click Click languages]&lt;/ref&gt; Most speakers live in [[Botswana]], but a few hundred live in [[Namibia]]. The people call themselves ǃXoon (pl. ǃXooŋake) or ʼNǀohan (pl. Nǀumde), depending on the dialect they speak. The Tuu languages are one of the three traditional language families that make up the [[Khoisan languages]].

''Taa'' is the word for 'human being'; the local name of the language is ''Taa ǂaan'', from ''ǂaan'' 'language'. ''ǃXoon'' (ǃXóõ) is an ethnonym used at opposite ends of the Taa-speaking area, but not by Taa speakers in between.&lt;ref&gt;Gertrud Boden, 2007, ''ǃQamtee ǀaa ǂXanya: 'the Book of Traditions' : Histories, Texts and Illustrations from the ǃXoon and 'Nǀohan People of Namibia''&lt;/ref&gt; Most living Taa speakers are ethnic ǃXoon (plural ''ǃXooŋake'') or 'Nǀohan (plural ''Nǀumde'').&lt;ref&gt;DoBeS, [http://www.mpi.nl/DOBES/projects/taa/people “Taa”].&lt;/ref&gt;

Taa shares a number of characteristic features with [[ǂ’Amkoe language|West ǂ’Amkoe]] and [[Gǀui language|Gǀui]], which together are considered part of the [[Kalahari Basin]] [[sprachbund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Güldemann|first=Tom|last2=Fehn|first2=Anne-Maria|date=2015|title=The Kalahari Basin area as a "Sprachbund" before the Bantu expansion - an update|url=https://www.iaaw.hu-berlin.de/de/afrika/linguistik-und-sprachen/mitarbeiter/1683070/dokumente/gueldemann-fehn-kalahari-basin|journal=Online|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Until the rediscovery of a few elderly speakers of [[Nǁng language|Nǁng]] in the 1990s, Taa was thought to be the last surviving member of the [[Tuu languages|Tuu]] language family.

==Dialects==
There is sufficient dialectal variation in Taa that it might be better described as a [[dialect continuum]] than as a single language.  Taa dialects fall into two groups, suggesting a historical spread from west to east:&lt;ref&gt;Naumann (2011) "A preliminary classification of Taa dialects".&lt;/ref&gt;

*West Taa: Traill's West ǃXoon and Dorothea Bleek's Nǀuǁʼen
*East Taa
**ǃAma (Western)
**(Eastern)
***East ǃXoon (Lone Tree)
***Tsaasi–ǂHuan
****Tsaasi
****ǂHuan

Traill worked primarily with East ǃXoon, and the [[DoBeS]] project is working with ’Nǀohan (in East Taa) and West ǃXoon.

ǀ’Auni and Kiǀhazi, previously considered dialects of Taa, were more divergent than the dialects here, and are now classified as a distinct language, [[Lower Nossob language|Lower Nossob]].

==Alternate names==
The various dialects and social groups of the Taa, their many names, the unreliability of transcriptions found in the literature, and the fact that names may be shared between languages and that dialects have been classified, has resulted in a great deal of confusion.  Traill (1974), for example, spent two chapters of his ''Compleat Guide to the Koon'' [sic] disentangling names and dialects.&lt;ref name=Treis&gt;Yvonne Treis, 1998, "Names of Khoisan Languages and their Variants"&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''ǃXoon'' (more precisely ''ǃXóõ)'' is only used at Aminius Reserve in Namibia, around Lone Tree where Traill primarily worked, and at Dzutshwa (Botswana).  It is, however, used by the ǃXoon for all Taa speakers.  It has been variously spelled ''ǃxō, ǃkɔ̃ː, ǃko/ǃkõ, Khong,'' and the fully anglicized ''Koon''.

Bleek's Nǀuǁʼen dialect&lt;ref&gt;Distinguish ''ǁNg ǃ’e'', a form of [[Nǁng language|Nǁng]], and ''ǁŨǁ’e,'' which is related to [[Seroa language|Seroa]].&lt;/ref&gt; has been spelled ''ǀNuǁen, ǀNuǁe:n, Ngǀuǁen, Nguen, Nǀhuǁéi, ŋǀuǁẽin, ŋǀuǁẽi, ŋǀuǁen, ǀuǁen.''  It has also been called by the ambiguous Khoekhoe term ''Nǀusan (Nǀu-san, Nǀūsā, Nǀuusaa, Nǀhusi),'' sometimes rendered ''Nusan'' or ''Noosan'', which has been used for other languages in the area.  A subgroup was known as ''Koon'' {{IPA|[kɔ̃ː]}}.  This dialect is apparently extinct.

Bleek recorded another now-extinct variety at the town of Khakhea, and it is known in the literature as ''Kakia''.  Names with a tee: ''Katia, Kattea, Khatia,'' and ''Xatia,'' are apparently spelling variants of ''Kakia'', though this is not certain.  ''[[Vaalpens]]'', ''ǀKusi'', and ''ǀEikusi'' evidently refer to the same variety as Xatia.

Westphal studied a variety rendered ''ǀŋamani, ǀnamani, Ngǀamani, ǀŋamasa''.  This dialect is apparently also now extinct.

Westphal also studied ǂHuan (ǂhũa) dialect (or ''ǂHũa-ʘwani''), and used this name for the entire language.  However, the term is ambiguous between Taa (Western ǂHũa) and [[ǂ’Amkoe language|ǂ’Amkoe]] (Eastern ǂHũa), and for this reason Traill chose to call the language ''ǃXóõ''.

Tsaasi dialect is quite similar to ǂHuan, and like ''ǂHuan,'' the name is used ambiguously for a dialect of ǂ’Amkoe. This is a Tswana name, variously rendered ''Tshasi, Tshase, Tʃase, Tsase,'' ''Sasi'', and ''Sase''.

The Tswana term for Bushmen, ''Masarwa'', is frequently encountered.  More specific to the Taa are ''Magon (Magong)'' and the ''Tshasi'' mentioned above.

The Taa distinguish themselves along at least some of the groups above. Like many San peoples, they also distinguish themselves by the environment they live in (plain people, river people, etc.), and also by direction.  Traill reports the following:&lt;ref name="Treis" /&gt;

:''{{IPA|ǃama ʘʔâni}}'' "westerners"
:''{{IPA|ǂhūã ʘʔâni}}'' "southerners"
:''{{IPA|ʘqhōa ʘʔâni}}'' "in-betweeners"
:''{{IPA|tùu ʔʘnāhnsā̂}}'' "pure people"

Heinz reports that ''{{IPA|ǃxóõ}}'' is an exonym given by other Bushmen, and that the Taa call themselves ''{{IPA|ǃxoia}}.''

The Taa refer to their language as ''{{IPA|tâa ǂâã}}'' "people's language". Westphal (1971) adopted the word ''{{IPA|tâa}}'' "person" as the name for the Southern Khoisan language family, which is now called ''Tuu''.&lt;ref name="Treis" /&gt; The East ǃXoon term for the language is ''ǃxóɲa ǂâā'' {{IPA-all|ǃ͡χɔ˦ ɲa˧ ǂaː˥˩˧| }}.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Phonology==
{{Cleanup|section|date=July 2010}}
Taa has at least 58 consonants, 31 vowels, and four tones (Traill 1985, 1994 on East ǃXoon), or at least 87 consonants, 20 vowels, and two tones (DoBeS 2008 on West ǃXoon), by many counts the most of any known language. These include 20 (Traill) or 43 (DoBeS) [[click consonant]]s and several vowel [[phonation]]s, though opinions vary as to which of the 130 (Traill) or 164 (DoBeS) consonant sounds are single [[segment (linguistics)|segments]] and which are [[consonant cluster]]s.

===Tones===
Traill describes four [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]s for the East ǃXoon dialect: high {{IPA|[á]}}, mid {{IPA|[ā]}}, low {{IPA|[à]}}, and mid-falling {{IPA|[â]}}. Patterns for bisyllabic bases include high-high, mid-mid, mid-mid-falling, and low-low. DoBeS describes only two tonemes, high and low, for the West ǃXoon dialect. By analyzing each base as bimoraic, Traill's four tones are mapped onto [áá], [àá], [àà], and [áà]. Unlike Traill, Naumann does not find a four-way contrast on monomoraic grammatical forms in Eastern !Xoõ data.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hdl.handle.net/1839/00-0000-0000-000D-6F3E-9@view|title=High and low tone in Taa (!Xóõ)|last=Naumann|first=Christfried|date=|website=hdl.handle.net|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to lexical tone, Traill describes East !Xoon nouns as falling into two tone classes according to the melody induced on concordial morphemes and transitive verbs: either level (Tone Class I) or falling (Tone Class II).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Transitive object nouns from Tone Class I trigger mid/mid-rising tone in transitive verbs, while Tone Class 2 objects correlate with any tone contour. Naumann finds the same results in the eastern 'N|ohan dialect.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Vowels===
Taa has five vowel qualities, {{IPA|[a e i o u]}}. The Traill and DoBeS descriptions differ in the [[phonation]]s of these vowels; it is not clear if this reflects a dialectal difference or a difference of analysis.

====East ǃXoon (Traill)====
Traill describes the phonations of the East ǃXoon dialect as plain {{angle bracket|a}}, [[breathy voice|murmured]] {{angle bracket|ah}}, or [[glottalization|glottalized]] {{angle bracket|aʼ}}. {{IPA|[a o u]}} may also be both glottalized and murmured {{angle bracket|aʼh}}, as well as [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] {{angle bracket|a̰}}/{{angle bracket|aq}} or [[strident vowel|strident]] {{angle bracket|a̰h}}/{{angle bracket|aqh}}. {{IPA|[a u]}} may be both pharyngealized and glottalized {{angle bracket|a̰ʼ}}, for 26 vowels not counting nasalization or length.

Murmured vowels after plain consonants contrast with plain vowels after aspirated consonants, and likewise glottalized vowels with ejective consonants, so these are phonations of the vowels and not assimilation with consonant phonation.

Vowels may be long or short, but long vowels may be sequences rather than distinct [[phoneme]]s. The other vowel quality sequences—better known as [[diphthong]]s—disregarding the added complexity of [[phonation]], are {{IPA|[ai, ae, ao, au, oi, oe, oa, ou, ui, ue, ua]}}.

All plain vowels may be nasalized. No other phonation may be nasalized, but nasalization occurs in combination with other phonations as the second vowel of a sequence ("long vowel" or "diphthong"). These sequences alternate dialectally with vowel plus [[velar nasal]]. That is, the name ǃXóõ may be dialectally {{IPA|[kǃxóŋ]}}, and this in turn may be phonemically {{IPA|/kǃxóɲ/}}, since {{IPA|[ɲ]}} does not occur word-finally. However, this cannot explain the short nasal vowels, so Taa has at least 31 vowels.

A long, glottalized, murmured, nasalized ''o'' with falling tone is written {{angle bracket|ôʼhõ}}. A long, strident nasalized ''o'' with low tone is written {{angle bracket|òqhõ}}, since Traill analyzes stridency as phonemically pharyngealized murmur. (Note that phonetically these are distinct phonations.)

====West ǃXoon (DoBeS)====
DoBeS describes the phonations of the West ǃXoon dialect as plain, ''a e i o u;'' nasalized, ''an en in on un;'' epiglottalized or pharyngealized, ''aq eq iq oq uq;'' strident, ''aqh eqh iqh oqh uqh;'' and glottalized or 'tense', ''aʼ eʼ iʼ oʼ uʼ.''

===Consonants===
Taa is unusual in allowing mixed [[phonation|voicing]] in its consonants. These have been called "prevoiced", but they actually appear to be consonant clusters. When [[homorganic]], as in [dt], such clusters are listed in the chart below.

Taa consonants are complex, and it is not clear how much of the difference between the dialects is real and how much is an artifact of analysis.

====East ǃXoon (Traill)====
Marginal or rare consonants are in parentheses. Asterisks mark consonants added in 1994, which are likely also marginal or rare.

The nasal {{IPA|[ɲ]}} only occurs between vowels, and {{IPA|[ŋ]}} only word finally (and then only in some dialects), so these may be [[allophone]]s. {{IPA|[β], [l], [j]}} also only occur in medial position.

The mixed-voice consonants have long been puzzling. Miller-Ockhuizen (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller-Ockhuizen|first1=Amanda|title=The Phonetics and Phonology of Gutturals: A Case Study from Ju&amp;#124;'hoansi|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|ISBN=9781135884819}}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzes them as [[breathy voiced]], attributing the medial voicelessness to a larger glottal opening gesture than is found in Hindustani breathy-voiced consonants. The same four-way contrast in phonation is found in the pulmonic contour clicks. Taa is typologically unusual regardless in having mixed-voice ejectives. However, [[Juǀʼhoansi]], which is part of the same ''Sprachbund'' as Taa, truly does have mixed voicing in {{IPA|[d͡tʰ, d͡tʃʰ, d͡tsʼ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{SOWL|63, 80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the velar and uvular series, Miller (2011) only reports {{IPA|/k, x, q/}}; the others in the table are marked (?).{{fix|text=track this down}} There are additional [[consonant cluster]]s, though these can also be analyzed as uvularized consonants: {{IPA|/pʼkxʼ (pᵡʼ), tx (tᵡ), dtx (dᵡ), tsʰx (tsᵡ), dtsʰx (dzᵡ), tʼkxʼ (tᵡʼ), dtʼkxʼ (dᵡʼ), tsʼkxʼ (tsᵡʼ), dtsʼkxʼ (dzᵡʼ)/}}.

Taa may have as few as 83 [[click consonant|click sounds]], if the more complex clicks are analyzed as [[consonant cluster|clusters]]. Given the intricate clusters posited seen in the non-click consonants, it is not surprising that many of the Taa clicks should be analyzed as clusters. However, there is some debate whether these are actually clusters; all non-Khoisan languages in the world that have clusters allow clusters with [[sonorant]]s like ''r, l, w, j'' (as in English ''tree, sleep, quick, cue''), and this does not occur in Taa.

There are five click types: [[bilabial consonant|bilabial]], [[dental consonant|dental]], [[lateral consonant|lateral]], [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]], and [[palatal consonant|palatal]]. There are seventeen series, differing in phonation, manner, and complexity (what were traditionally considered [[uvular consonant|uvular]] clicks, but that are now analyzed either as clusters or as airstream [[contour (linguistics)|contour]]s). These are perfectly normal consonants in Taa, and indeed are preferred over non-clicks in word-initial position.

The DoBeS project takes Traill's cluster analysis to mean that only the twenty tenuis, voiced, nasal, and voiceless nasal clicks are basic, with the rest being clusters of the tenuis and voiced clicks with {{IPA|x, kxʼ, q, ɢ, qʰ, ɢqʰ, qʼ, ʔ, h}} and either {{IPA|mˀ}} or {{IPA|nˀ}}. Recent work on Taa's sister language Nǁng suggests that all clicks in both languages have a uvular or rear articulation, and that the clicks considered to be uvular here are actually lingual–pulmonic and lingual–glottalic airstream [[contour (linguistics)|contour]]s. It may be that the 'prevoiced' consonants of Taa, including prevoiced clicks, can also be analysed as contour consonants, in this case with voicing contours.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;There is a misalignment in the source tables: DoBeS has 17 series, Miller (2011) 19, with the additional distinctions apparently being {{IPA|ǂʰ}} vs. {{IPA|ǂ͡qʰ}} and {{IPA|ᵑǂˀ}} vs. {{IPA|ǂˀ}}.

All nasal clicks have twin airstreams, since the air passing through the nose bypasses the tongue. Usually this is [[pulmonic egressive]]. However, the {{IPA|↓ŋ̊ʰ}} series in Taa is characterized by pulmonic ''[[pulmonic ingressive|ingressive]]'' nasal airflow. Ladefoged &amp; Maddieson (1996:268) state that "This ǃXóõ click is probably unique among the sounds of the world's languages that, even in the middle of a sentence, it may have ingressive pulmonic airflow." Taa is the only language known to contrast voiceless nasal and voiceless nasal aspirated clicks (Miller 2011).

====West ǃXoon (DoBeS)====
West ǃXoon has 164 consonants in a strict unit analysis, including 111 clicks in 23 series, which under a cluster analysis reduce to 87 consonants, including 43 clicks.

These are written in the practical orthography (Naumann 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Naumann|first1=Christfied|year=2008|contribution=The Consonantal System of West ǃXoon| title= 3rd International Symposium on Khoisan Languages and Linguistics''|location=Riezlern}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marginal consonants are not marked as such.

Vowel nasalization is only phonemic on the second [[mora (linguistics)|mora]] (in CCVV etc. syllables), as it is a phonetic effect of clicks such as {{angle bracket|nǂhh}} on the first mora. {{angle bracket|nǂhh}} does not make the following vowel breathy, maintaining a contrast between {{angle bracket|nǂhha}} and {{angle bracket|nǂhhah}}. Likewise, while {{angle bracket|gǂʼ}} does make the following vowel [[creaky voice|creaky]], there is a delayed onset to the vowel and the amplitude of the glottalization is less than that of {{angle bracket|gǂaʼ}} with a phonemically creaky vowel.

In an attempt to keep the phonemic inventory as symmetric as possible, the DoBeS team analyzed as segments two of the click types that Traill analyzed as clusters. These are (using the palatal clicks as examples) the pre-glottalized nasal clicks, ''ʼnǂ,'' which Traill had analyzed as {{IPA|/ǂ/ + /ʼn/}}, and the voiced aspirated clicks, ''gǂh,'' which Traill had analyzed as {{IPA|/ɡǂ/ + /qʰ/}}.

The expectation, from the morphology of ǃXoon, for voiceless-voiced pairs of click clusters led to the discovery of several series not distinguished by Traill. (This morphology appears to be more pervasive in West ǃXoon than in the East ǃXoon dialect that Traill worked on.) Thus for Trail's ''ǂqh,'' the DoBeS team distinguishes two phonemes, ''ǂqh'' and ''ǂh,'' and for Traill's ''ǂʼ,'' they have ''ǂ"'' and ''ǂʼ.'' It also led to the discovery of voiced click types which may not exist in East ǃXoon at all, namely ''nǂ", nǂhh, gǂʼ,'' and ''gǂqʼ.''

Under the contour analysis of Miller (2009), the distinction between simple and [[contour click]]s largely parallels the DoBeS identification of clusters, apart from the last four rows (ǂ", nǂ", ǂhh, nǂhh), which are considered to be simple clicks.

===Phonotactics===
The Taa syllable structure, as described by DoBeS, may be one of the following:

*CVV
*CCVV
*CVC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;V
*CCVC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;V
*CVN
*CCVN

where C is a consonant, V is a vowel, and N is a nasal stop. There is a very limited number of consonants which can occur in the second (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) position and only certain vowel sequences (VV and V…V) occur. The possible consonant clusters (CC) is covered above; C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may be {{IPA|[b~β̞], [dʲ~j], [l], [m], [n], [ɲ]}}.

==Grammar==
{{Expand section|date=July 2010}}
Taa is a [[subject–verb–object]] language with [[serial verb]]s and inflecting [[preposition]]s. [[Genitive]]s, [[adjective]]s, [[relative clause]]s, and numbers come after the nouns they apply to. [[Reduplication]] is used to form [[causative]]s. There are five [[noun|nominal]] [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] classes and an additional two [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] groups. Agreement occurs on pronouns, transitive verbs (with the object), adjectives, prepositions, and some particles.

[[File:P46.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A folio from [[Papyrus 46]], one of the oldest extant New Testament manuscripts]]
'''Textual criticism of the New Testament''' is the [[textual criticism|analysis of the manuscripts]] of the [[New Testament]], whose goals include identification of transcription errors, analysis of versions, and attempts to reconstruct the original.

The New Testament has been preserved in more than 5,800 [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts, 10,000 [[Latin]] manuscripts and 9,300 manuscripts in various other ancient languages including [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Ethiopic]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]].  There are approximately 300,000 textual variants among the manuscripts, most of them being the changes of word order and other comparative trivialities.&lt;ref name=wallace_on_majority&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Daniel|title=The Majority Text and the Original Text: Are They Identical?|url=https://bible.org/article/majority-text-and-original-text-are-they-identical|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Westcott and Hort|title=The New Testament in The Original Greek: Introduction Appendix|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ZxUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=The+New+Testament+in+the+Original+Greek&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text types==
The sheer number of witnesses presents unique difficulties, chiefly in that it makes stemmatics in many cases impossible, because many copyists used two or more different manuscripts as sources. Consequently, New Testament textual critics have adopted [[Textual_criticism#Eclecticism|eclecticism]] after sorting the witnesses into three major groups, called '''text types''' (also styled hyphenated: '''text-types'''). The most common division today is as follows:

| The [[Alexandrian text-type]]&lt;br /&gt;(also called the "Neutral Text" tradition; less frequently, the "Minority Text")||2nd–4th centuries CE|| This family constitutes a group of early and well-regarded texts, including [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]] and [[Codex Sinaiticus]]. Most of this tradition appear to come from around [[Alexandria, Egypt]] and from [[Coptic Church|the Alexandrian Church]] It contains readings that are often terse, shorter, somewhat rough, less harmonised, and generally more difficult. The family was once thought to be a very carefully edited 3rd century [[recension]] but now is believed to be merely the result of a carefully controlled and supervised process of copying and transmission. It underlies most modern translations of the New Testament.||[[NIV]], [[New American Bible|NAB]], [[New American Bible Revised Edition|NABRE]], [[Douay]], [[Jerusalem Bible|JB]] and [[New Jerusalem Bible|NJB]] (albeit, with some reliance on the Byzantine text-type), [[TNIV]], [[New American Standard Bible|NASB]], [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]], [[English Standard Version|ESV]], [[Emphasized Bible|EBR]], [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|NWT]], [[The Living Bible|LB]], [[American Standard Version|ASV]], [[New Century Version|NC]], [[Good News Bible|GNB]]

|The [[Western text-type]]||3rd–9th centuries CE ||This is also very early and comes from a wide geographical area stretching from North Africa to Italy from [[Gaul]] to Syria. It is found in Greek manuscripts and in the Latin translations used by the [[Western church]]. It is much less controlled than the Alexandrian family and its witnesses are seen to be more prone to [[paraphrase]] and other corruptions.  It is sometimes called the [[Caesarean text-type]].

== Alexandrian text versus Byzantine text ==

[[Image:Byzantinischer Maler um 1020 003.jpg|thumb|120px|Byzantine illuminated manuscript, 1020]]
The New Testament portion of the English translation known as the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Version]] was based on the [[Textus Receptus]], a Greek text prepared by [[Erasmus]] based on a few late medieval Greek manuscripts of the Byzantine text-type ([[Minuscule 1|1]], [[Minuscule 2814|1&lt;sup&gt;rK&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Minuscule 2|2&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Minuscule 2815|2&lt;sup&gt;ap&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Minuscule 4|4]], [[Minuscule 7|7]], [[Minuscule 817 (Gregory-Aland)|817]]).&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Combs, ''Erasmus and the textus receptus'', DBSJ 1 (Spring 1996), 45.&lt;/ref&gt; For some books of the Bible, Erasmus used just single manuscripts, and for small sections made his own translations into Greek from the [[Vulgate]].&lt;ref&gt;Ehrman 2005, "For the most part, he relied on a mere handful of late medieval manuscripts, which he marked up as if he were copyediting a handwritten copy for the printer.&amp;nbsp;... Erasmus relied heavily on just one twelfth-century manuscript for the Gospels and another, also of the twelfth century, for the book of Acts and the Epistles.&amp;nbsp;... For the [last six verses of the] Book of Revelation&amp;nbsp;... [he] simply took the Latin Vulgate and translated its text back into Greek.&amp;nbsp;..." (pp 78–79)&lt;/ref&gt; However, following [[Brooke Foss Westcott|Westcott]] and [[Fenton John Anthony Hort|Hort]], most modern New Testament textual critics have concluded that the Byzantine text-type was formalised at a later date than the Alexandrian and Western text-types. Among the other types, the Alexandrian text-type is viewed by some as more pure than the Western and Byzantine text-types, however, this view is held by the minority of scholars, and so one of the central tenets in the current practice of New Testament textual criticism is that one should follow the readings of the Alexandrian texts unless those of the other types are clearly superior. Most modern New Testament translations now use an Eclectic Greek text (UBS5 and [[Novum Testamentum Graece|NA 28]]) that is closest to the Alexandrian text-type. The ''United Bible Societies's Greek New Testament'' (UBS5) and [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Nestle Aland]] (NA 28) are accepted by most of the academic community as the best attempt at reconstructing the original texts of the Greek NT.&lt;ref&gt;Encountering the Manuscripts By Philip Comfort, 102&lt;/ref&gt;

A minority position represented by ''The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text'' edition by [[Zane C. Hodges]] and Arthur L. Farstad argues that the Byzantine text-type represents an earlier text-type than the surviving Alexandrian texts. This position is also held by [[Maurice A. Robinson]] and William G. Pierpont in their ''The New Testament in the Original Greek: Byzantine Textform'', and the [[King James Only Movement]]. The argument states that the far greater number of surviving late Byzantine manuscripts implies an equivalent preponderance of Byzantine texts amongst lost earlier manuscripts. Hence, a critical reconstruction of the predominant text of the Byzantine tradition would have a superior claim to being closest to the autographs.

Another position is that of the Neo-Byzantine School. The Neo-Byzantines (or new Byzantines) of the 16th and 17th centuries first formally compiled the New Testament Received Text under such textual analysts as [[Erasmus]], [[Robert Estienne|Stephanus (Robert Estienne)]], [[Beza]], and Elzevir. The early 21st century saw the rise of the first textual analyst of this school in over three centuries with Gavin McGrath (b. 1960). A religiously conservative Protestant from Australia, his Neo-Byzantine School principles maintain that the representative or majority Byzantine text, such as compiled by Hodges &amp; Farstad (1985) or [[Maurice A. Robinson|Robinson]] &amp; Pierpont (2005), is to be upheld unless there is a "clear and obvious" textual problem with it. When this occurs, he adopts either a minority Byzantine reading, a reading from the ancient [[Vulgate]], or a reading attested to in the writings of an ancient [[Church Father]] (in either Greek or Latin) by way of quotation. The Neo-Byzantine School considers that the doctrine of the Divine Preservation of Scripture means that God preserved the Byzantine Greek manuscripts, Latin manuscripts, and Greek and Latin church writers' citations of Scripture over time and through time. These are regarded as "a closed class of sources" i.e., non-Byzantine Greek manuscripts such as the Alexandrian texts, or manuscripts in other languages such as Armenian, Syriac, or Ethiopian, are regarded as "outside the closed class of sources" providentially protected over time, and so not used to compose the New Testament text.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.easy.com.au/~gmbooks/&lt;/ref&gt;
Other scholars have criticized the current categorization of manuscripts into text-types and prefer either to subdivide the manuscripts in other ways or to discard the text-type taxonomy.

Textual criticism is also used by those who assert that the New Testament was written in [[Aramaic]] (see [[Aramaic primacy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dunnett &amp; Tenney 1985, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpolations ==

In attempting to determine the original text of the New Testament books, some modern textual critics have identified sections as [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolations]]. In modern translations of the Bible such as the [[New International Version]], the results of textual criticism have led to certain verses, words and phrases being left out or marked as not original. Previously, translations of the New Testament such as the [[King James Version]] had mostly been based on [[Erasmus]]'s redaction of the New Testament in Greek, the [[Textus Receptus]] from the 16th century based on later manuscripts.

According to [[Bart D. Ehrman]], "These scribal additions are often found in late medieval manuscripts of the New Testament, but not in the manuscripts of the earlier centuries," he adds. And because the King James Bible is based on later manuscripts, such verses "became part of the Bible tradition in English-speaking lands."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[[Bart D. Ehrman|Ehrman, Bart D.]]. ''[[Misquoting Jesus]]: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why''. HarperCollins, 2005, p. 265. {{ISBN|978-0-06-073817-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern Bibles have footnotes to indicate passages that have disputed source documents.  Bible Commentaries also discuss these, sometimes in great detail.

These possible later additions include the following:&lt;ref&gt;Ehrman 2006, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Metzger1994"&gt;[[Bruce Metzger]] "A Textual Commentary on the New Testament", Second Edition, 1994, German Bible Society&lt;/ref&gt;

* the ''longer ending of [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]]'', see [[Mark 16]] ({{bibleverse||Mark|16:9–20}}).
* Jesus [[Hematidrosis|sweating blood]] in [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], ''[[Christ's agony at Gethsemane]]'' ({{bibleverse||Luke|22:43–44}}).
* the story in [[Gospel of John|John]] of the woman taken in adultery, the ''[[Pericope Adulterae]]'' ({{bibleverse||John|7:53–8:11}}).
* an explicit reference to the [[Trinity]] in [[1 John]], the ''[[Comma Johanneum]]'' (1 John 5:7–8).

=== Other disputed NT passages ===

Opinions are divided on whether Jesus is referred to as "unique [or only-begotten: Gk. ''monogenes''] Son" or "unique [''monogenes''] God", in {{bibleverse||John|1:18}}&lt;ref name="Metzger1994" /&gt;

{{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|14:33–35}}. [[Gordon Fee]]&lt;ref&gt;See Gordon Fee, First Epistle to the Corinthians, NICNT (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1987), 699.&lt;/ref&gt; regards the instruction for women to be silent in churches as a later, non-Pauline addition to the Letter, more in keeping with the viewpoint of the [[Pastoral Epistles]] (see 1&amp;nbsp;Tim 2.11–12; Titus 2.5) than of the certainly [[Pauline Epistles]]. A few [[manuscripts]] place these verses after 40&lt;ref&gt;Footnotes on 14:34–35 and 14:36 from The HarperCollins Study Bible: New Revised Standard Version: A New Annotated Edition by the Society of Biblical Literature, San Francisco, 1993, page 2160. Note also that the NRSV encloses 14:33b–36 in parentheses to characterize it as a parenthetical comment that does not fit in smoothly with the surrounding texts.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various groups of highly conservative Christians believe that when Ps.12:6–7 speaks of the preservation of the words of God, that this nullifies the need for textual criticism, lower, and higher. Such people include [[Gail Riplinger]], [[Peter Ruckman]], and others. Many theological organisations, societies, newsletters, and churches also hold to this belief, including "AV Publications", Sword of The LORD Newsletter, The Antioch Bible Society&lt;ref&gt;[http://antiochbiblesociety.org/ Antioch Bible Society]&lt;/ref&gt; and others. On the other hand, [[Reformation]] biblical scholars such as [[Martin Luther]] saw the academic analysis of biblical texts and their provenance as entirely in line with orthodox Christian faith.&lt;ref name="Kramm 2009 p. 110"&gt;{{cite book | last=Kramm | first=H.H. | title=The Theology of Martin Luther | publisher=Wipf &amp; Stock Publishers | year=2009 | isbn=978-1-60608-765-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FzBMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110 | accessdate=14 May 2017 | page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hendrix 2015 p. 39"&gt;{{cite book | last=Hendrix | first=S.H. | title=Martin Luther: Visionary Reformer | publisher=Yale University Press | year=2015 | isbn=978-0-300-16669-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NHKhCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39 | accessdate=14 May 2017 | page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note, however, that Luther did not exclusively advocate for disinterested historical reconstruction of the original text.

'''Vegetation''' is an assemblage of [[plant]] species and the [[ground cover]] they provide.&lt;ref name=Burrows&gt;{{Cite book|last=Burrows|first=Colin J.|year=1990|title=Processes of vegetation change.|publisher=Unwin Hyman|location=London|isbn=0045800138|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a general term, without specific reference to particular taxa, life forms, structure, [[Spatial ecology|spatial]] extent, or any other specific botanical or geographic characteristics. It is broader than the term ''[[Flora (plants)|flora]]'' which refers to species composition. Perhaps the closest synonym is [[plant community]], but ''vegetation'' can, and often does, refer to a wider range of spatial scales than that term does, including scales as large as the global. Primeval [[redwood forest]]s, coastal [[mangrove]] stands, [[sphagnum bog]]s, [[desert]] [[soil crust]]s, [[Road verge|roadside]] weed patches, wheat fields, cultivated [[garden]]s and lawns; all are encompassed by the term ''vegetation''.

The [[vegetation type]] is defined by characteristic dominant species, or a common aspect of the assemblage, such as an elevation range or environmental commonality.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to California Plant Life; Robert Ornduff, Phyllis M. Faber, Todd Keeler-Wolf; 2003 ed.; p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary use of ''vegetation'' approximates that of ecologist [[Frederic Clements|Frederic Clements']] term '''earth cover''', an expression still used by the [[Bureau of Land Management]]. Natural vegetation refers to plant life undisturbed by humans in its growth and which is controlled by the [[climate|climatic]] conditions of that region.{{clarify|date=November 2016}}

==History of definition==
The distinction between vegetation (the general appearance of a community) and [[flora]] (the taxonomic composition of a community) was first made by [[Jules Thurmann]] (1849). Prior to this, the two terms (vegetation and flora) were used indiscriminately,&lt;ref&gt;Thurmann, J. (1849). ''Essai de Phytostatique appliqué à la chaîne du Jura et aux contrées voisines.'' Berne: Jent et Gassmann, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/51540#/summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002105310/http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/51540 |date=2017-10-02 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martins"&gt;Martins, F. R. &amp; Batalha, M. A. (2011). Formas de vida, espectro biológico de Raunkiaer e fisionomia da vegetação. In: Felfili, J. M., Eisenlohr, P. V.; Fiuza de Melo, M. M. R.; Andrade, L.

[[Augustin de Candolle]] (1820) also made a similar distinction, but he used the terms "station" ([[habitat]] type) and "habitation" ([[phytochorion|botanical region]]).&lt;ref&gt;de Candolle, Augustin (1820). Essai Élémentaire de Géographie Botanique. In: ''Dictionnaire des sciences naturelles'', Vol. 18. Flevrault, Strasbourg, [https://books.google.com/books?id=R7J3yRwiLLcC].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lomolino, M. V., &amp; Brown, J. H. (2004). ''Foundations of biogeography: classic papers with commentaries''. University of Chicago Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KbkCgsEPv6YC].&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the concept of vegetation would influence the usage of the term [[biome]], with the inclusion of the animal element.&lt;ref name="Coutinho"&gt;Coutinho, L. M. (2006). O conceito de bioma. ''Acta Bot. Bras.'' 20(1): 13-23, {{cite web |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0102-33062006000100002 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007001409/http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0102-33062006000100002 |archivedate=2016-10-07 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other concepts similar to vegetation are "[[physiognomy]] of vegetation" ([[A. von Humboldt|Humboldt]], 1805, 1807) and "formation" ([[August Grisebach|Grisebach]], 1838, derived from "''Vegetationsform''", [[Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius|Martius]], 1824).&lt;ref name="Martins"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Humboldt, A. von &amp; Bonpland, A. 1805. ''Essai sur la geographie des plantes. Accompagné d'un tableau physique des régions équinoxiales fondé sur des mesures exécutées, depuis le dixiéme degré de latitude boréale jusqu'au dixiéme degré de latitude australe, pendant les années 1799, 1800, 1801, 1802 et 1803''. Paris: Schöll, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/9309#/summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504023415/https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/9309 |date=2018-05-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Humboldt, A. von &amp; Bonpland, A. 1807.

F. P. von. 1824. ''Die Physiognomie des Pflanzenreiches in Brasilien. Eine Rede, gelesen in der am 14. Febr. 1824 gehaltnen Sitzung der Königlichen Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften.''

Departing from [[Linnean taxonomy]], Humboldt established a new science, dividing [[plant geography]] between taxonomists who studied plants as taxa and geographers who studied plants as vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Ebach, M.C. (2015). ''Origins of biogeography. The role of biological classification in early plant and animal geography''. Dordrecht: Springer, p. 89, [https://books.google.com/books?id=K7UYCgAAQBAJ].
&lt;/ref&gt; The physiognomic approach in the study of vegetation is common among biogeographers working on vegetation on a world scale, or when there is a lack of taxonomic knowledge of some place (e.g., in the tropics, where biodiversity is commonly high).&lt;ref name="Beard"&gt;Beard J.S. (1978). The Physiognomic Approach. In: R. H. Whittaker (editor). ''Classification of Plant Communities'', pp 33-64, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yFr-CAAAQBAJ].&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "[[vegetation type]]" is more ambiguous. The definition of a specific vegetation type may include not only physiognomy, but also floristic and habitat aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Eiten, G. 1992. How names are used for vegetation. ''Journal of Vegetation Science'' 3:419-424. [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2307/3235768 link].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter, B. M. T. (2006).

''Tratado de fitogeografia do Brasil: aspectos ecológicos, sociológicos e florísticos''. 2 ed. Rio de Janeiro: Âmbito Cultural Edições, p. 7-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

An influential, clear and simple classification scheme for types of vegetation was produced by [[Hermann Wagner (geographer)|Wagner]] &amp; [[Emil von Sydow|von Sydow]] (1888).&lt;ref&gt;Cox, C.

{{Main|Vegetation classification}}
There are many approaches for the classification of vegetation (physiognomy, flora, ecology, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;de Laubenfels, D. J. 1975.

D. (2009). ''Ecology and Environment''. Rastogi: Meerut, p. 140, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fjmhn4g5VHkC&amp;pg=PA140].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mueller-Dombois, D. 1984. Classification and Mapping of Plant Communities: a Review with Emphasis on Tropical Vegetation. In: G. M. Woodwell (ed.) ''The Role of Terrestrial Vegetation in the Global Carbon Cycle: Measurement by Remote Sensing'', J. Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, pp. 21-88, {{cite web |url=http://dge.stanford.edu/SCOPE/SCOPE_23/SCOPE_23_2.1_chapter2_21-88.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717052018/http://dge.stanford.edu/SCOPE/SCOPE_23/SCOPE_23_2.1_chapter2_21-88.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-17 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the work on vegetation classification comes from European and North American ecologists, and they have fundamentally different approaches. In North America, vegetation types are based on a combination of the following criteria: climate pattern, [[plant habit]], [[phenology]] and/or growth form, and dominant species. In the [[U.S. National Vegetation Classification|current US standard]] (adopted by the [[Federal Geographic Data Committee]] (FGDC), and originally developed by [[UNESCO]] and [[The Nature Conservancy]]), the classification is [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] and incorporates the non-floristic criteria into the upper (most general) five levels and limited floristic criteria only into the lower (most specific) two levels. In Europe, classification often relies much more heavily, sometimes entirely, on floristic (species) composition alone, without explicit reference to climate, phenology or growth forms. It often emphasizes [[Indicator value|indicator or diagnostic species]] which may distinguish one classification from another.

In the FGDC standard, the hierarchy levels, from most general to most specific, are: ''system, class, subclass, group, formation, alliance, ''and'' association''. The lowest level, or association, is thus the most precisely defined, and incorporates the names of the dominant one to three (usually two) species of a type. An example of a vegetation type defined at the level of class might be "''Forest, canopy cover &gt; 60%''"; at the level of a formation as "''Winter-rain, broad-leaved, evergreen, sclerophyllous, closed-canopy forest''"; at the level of alliance as "''Arbutus menziesii'' forest"; and at the level of association as "''Arbutus menziesii-Lithocarpus densiflora'' forest", referring to Pacific madrone-tanoak forests which occur in California and Oregon, USA. In practice, the levels of the alliance and/or association are the most often used, particularly in vegetation mapping, just as the Latin binomial is most often used in discussing particular species in taxonomy and in general communication.

[[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in [[Australia]] classifies its vegetation by [[ecological vegetation class]].

==Dynamics==
Like all the biological systems, plant communities are temporally and spatially dynamic; they change at all possible scales. Dynamism in vegetation is defined primarily as changes in species composition and/or vegetation structure.

===Temporal dynamics===
[[File:Last Glacial Maximum Vegetation Map.svg|thumb|Vegetation types at time of [[Last Glacial Maximum]]]]
Temporally, a large number of processes or events can cause change, but for sake of simplicity they can be categorized roughly as either abrupt or gradual. Abrupt changes are generally referred to as [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbances]]; these include things like [[wildfire]]s, high [[winds]], [[landslide]]s, [[flood]]s, [[avalanche]]s and the like. Their causes are usually external ([[exogenous]]) to the community—they are natural processes occurring (mostly) independently of the natural processes of the community (such as germination, growth, death, etc.). Such events can change vegetation structure and composition very quickly and for long time periods, and they can do so over large areas. Very few ecosystems are without some type of disturbance as a regular and recurring part of the long term [[system]] dynamic. [[Fire]] and wind disturbances are particularly common throughout many vegetation types worldwide. Fire is particularly potent because of its ability to destroy not only living plants, but also the seeds, spores, and living [[meristem]]s representing the potential next generation, and because of fire's impact on fauna populations, [[soil]] characteristics and other ecosystem elements and processes (for further discussion of this topic see [[fire ecology]]).

Temporal change at a slower pace is ubiquitous; it comprises the field of [[ecological succession]]. Succession is the relatively gradual change in structure and taxonomic composition that arises as the vegetation itself modifies various environmental variables over time, including light, water and [[nutrient]] levels. These modifications change the suite of species most adapted to grow, survive and reproduce in an area, causing floristic changes. These floristic changes contribute to structural changes that are inherent in plant growth even in the absence of species changes (especially where plants have a large maximum size, i.e. trees), causing slow and broadly predictable changes in the vegetation. Succession can be interrupted at any time by disturbance, setting the system either back to a previous state, or off on another [[trajectory]] altogether. Because of this, successional processes may or may not lead to some static, [[climax community|final state]]. Moreover, accurately predicting the characteristics of such a state, even if it does arise, is not always possible. In short, vegetative communities are subject to many variables that together set limits on the predictability of future conditions.

===Spatial dynamics===
As a general rule, the larger an area under consideration, the more likely the vegetation will be heterogeneous across it. Two main factors are at work. First, the temporal dynamics of disturbance and succession are increasingly unlikely to be in synchrony across any area as the size of that area increases. That is, different areas will be at different developmental stages due to different local histories, particularly their times since last major disturbance. This fact interacts with inherent environmental variability (e.g. in soils, climate, topography, etc.), which is also a function of area. Environmental variability constrains the suite of species that can occupy a given area, and the two factors together interact to create a mosaic of vegetation conditions across the landscape. Only in [[agricultural]] or [[horticultural]] systems does vegetation ever approach perfect uniformity. In natural systems, there is always heterogeneity, although its scale and intensity will vary widely.
