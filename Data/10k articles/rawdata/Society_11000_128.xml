The '''Ancient Grand Lodge of England''', as it is known today, or ''The Grand Lodge of the Most Ancient and Honourable Fraternity of Free and Accepted Masons (according to the Old Constitutions granted by His Royal Highness Prince Edwin, at York, Anno Domini nine hundred and twenty six, and in the year of Masonry four thousand nine hundred and twenty six)'' as they described themselves on their warrants,&lt;ref&gt;J. Brown, Masonry in Wigan, Platt 1882&lt;/ref&gt; was a rival Grand Lodge to the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England]]. It existed from 1751 until 1813 when the [[United Grand Lodge of England]] was created from the two Grand Lodges. They are now called the ''Antients'', in contrast to the ''Moderns'', the original Grand Lodge who had moved away from the ritual of Scotland, Ireland, and now the Antient Grand Lodge. This Grand Lodge was also informally called the ''Atholl Grand Lodge'' because the Third and Fourth [[Duke of Atholl|Dukes of Atholl]] presided over it as Grand Masters for half of its 62-year existence.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/aqc/ancients.html Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon] The Formation of the Grand Lodge of the Antients, I. R. Clarke, Ars Quatuor Coronatorum, vol 79 (1966), p.&amp;nbsp;270–73, retrieved 16 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Grand Lodge never spelled Antient with a 't', the convention was followed by the Moderns, and continues to be used by [[UGLE|United Grand Lodge]]. Some confusion arises from the Ancients' own documentation. Their seals are inscribed '''Grand Lodge in London of Free and Accepted Masons According to the Old Institution(s)''', while in their masonic certificates, issued to new members, they called themselves the '''Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of England according to the Old Constitutions'''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Ramsden Riley, Masonic Certificates, Quatuor Coronati Antigrapha, Vol VIII, 1891&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

From about 1721, the new Grand Lodge which had been formed in London in 1717, and would soon spread to the rest of England, Wales, and abroad, pursued a policy of self-publicity and expansion that did not always sit well with other Freemasons. They abandoned the old methods of "drawing" lodges with chalk, (erased with a mop) in favour of tape and portable metal letters.&lt;ref name ="Castells"&gt;F. De P. Castells, The Origin of the Masonic Degrees, (reprinted) Kessinger Publishing, 2003, pp&amp;nbsp;39–40&lt;/ref&gt; In 1735 they refused admission to the Master and Wardens of an Irish lodge who claimed to be a deputation from Lord Kingston, then Grand Master of Ireland and past Grand Master of the English Grand Lodge. The Irish masons were offered admission if they would accept the English constitution, which they refused.&lt;ref&gt;The Minutes of the Grand Lodge of Freemasons of England, 1723–1739, Quatuor Coronatorum Antigrapha,Vol 10, 1913, p 259&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1730s the English Grand Lodge had changed their ritual to stay ahead of public exposures. During this period, London absorbed many economic migrants from Ireland. Those who were already masons were often repelled by the changes introduced by the English Grand Lodge, and either formed their own lodges, or joined one of the many unaffiliated lodges in the capital. In 1751, five of these, and a sixth that had just been formed, united to form a rival Grand Lodge, which quickly became an umbrella organisation for the other unaffiliated lodges in England.&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;

This success must be seen as a triumph of the energy, wit, and sheer belligerence of their second Grand Secretary, [[Laurence Dermott]]. Most of what we know of him comes from the minutes of Grand Lodge and from his book of constitutions. The Grand Committee met on the first Wednesday of every month, and on 5 February 1752, Dermott replaced John Morgan as Grand Secretary. The next month he dealt with the "Leg of Mutton" masons, two men who had initiated masons into the [[Holy Royal Arch|Royal Arch]] for the price of a leg of mutton, but on examination by Dermott, knew nothing of the degree. They also claimed to teach a masonic method of achieving invisibility. In April he persuaded his brethren to replace Morgan's bye-laws with those of his own lodge in Dublin. June saw Dermott installing the Grand Officers. The lodge met as usual on Wednesday 2 September, and were treated to a lecture on their ritual by Dermott. Due to the change that year from the [[Julian Calendar|Julian]] to the [[Gregorian Calendar]], the next day was Thursday 14 September, losing 11 days. The actual business of the lodge was conducted at an "emergency" meeting on the 14th, ensuring both dates appeared in the minutes.&lt;ref name="Bywater"&gt;Witham Matthew Bywater, Notes on Laurence Dermott G.S. and his Work, London, 1884.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dermott gave them a book of constitutions, inexplicably entitled "[[Ahiman Rezon]], or a Help to a Brother". It was modeled on Spratt's Irish Constitutions, which in turn were modeled on [[James Anderson (Freemason)|Anderson's]] constitutions. The introductory history was replaced by a satirical account of Dermott's attempt to write a better one (which would trace Freemasonry to before the Creation). The publication of the first edition, in 1756, may have been delayed until the society had found a noble sponsor to act as Grand Master. He arrived in the form of the [[William Stewart, 1st Earl of Blessington|Earl of Blessington]], who had already served as Grand Master in Ireland. The second edition, in 1764, compared the ancient practices of the new Grand Lodge with the works of the "Moderns". The older Grand Lodge had been castigated as the "Moderns" since the 1720s, and the term is still used today. Dermott's characterisation of the Moderns is scathing and satirical, and with each succeeding edition during his lifetime, more scorn is heaped on the society that deviated from the established landmarks of the order, and whose greatest masonic symbols were the knife and fork. After his death, in 1791, successive editors of Ahiman Rezon progressively excised the insults.&lt;ref name="Castells" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheppard"&gt;[http://www.antients.co.uk/History%20-%20Ahiman%20Rezon.htm Association of Atholl Lodges] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926194347/http://www.antients.co.uk/History%20-%20Ahiman%20Rezon.htm |date=26 September 2013 }} Ray Sheppard, Ahiman Rezon,retrieved 23 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dermott"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RnUIAAAAQAAJ Google books] Ahiman Rezon (pdf), 2nd edition, London, 1764, retrieved 30 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ahiman Rezon, although divisive, proved popular, and the Ancients flourished. They were recognised by the Grand Lodges of Ireland and Scotland, who continued to view the innovations of the Moderns with suspicion. A low point in relations between the two Grand Lodges was reached in the 1770s, when [[William Preston (Freemason)|William Preston]], then assistant Grand Secretary of the Moderns, attempted to poison the relationship between the Ancients and the Grand Lodge of Scotland.&lt;ref name="Bywater" /&gt;

After Dermott's death, the two Grand Lodges moved slowly towards union. The need for unity was underlined during the Napoleonic wars, when the leaders of the Ancients, Moderns, and the Grand Lodge of Scotland acted together to prevent their lodges becoming proscribed organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/prescott15.html Pietre Stones] The Unlawful Societies Act of 1799, Dr Andrew Prescott, from M.

The final union was in the hands of two sons of the King, the [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex|Duke of Sussex]], the Grand Master of the Moderns, and the [[Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|Duke of Kent]]. Kent had already effected a union in Canada by simply abolishing the Moderns, and merging their lodges with those of the Ancients. The new Grand Lodge, the [[United Grand Lodge of England]], retained the infrastructure of the Moderns, and the ritual of the Ancients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopediaoffreemasonry.com/u/union-of-1813-the/ Encyclopedia of Freemasonry] retrieved 17 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival in Lancashire==

In 1823, the mishandling of grievances of a few [[Lancashire|Lancastrian]] masons led to an attempt to revive the Ancients in what has come to be known as the '''Wigan Grand Lodge'''. Mistrust of the new Grand Lodge was already simmering when the Provincial Grand Lodge meeting at [[Manchester]] in 1818 asked that the book of constitutions be amended to state that a lodge must hand back its warrant if membership falls below 7, instead of the 5 stated.&lt;ref&gt;The minimum number is still 5, UGLE constitutions, rule 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Further concern was shown when some masons in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] were told that it was "not desirable to make the Number of (Royal Arch) Chapters in any place equal to the Number of Lodges." The low minimum implied that it was possible to run a lodge without Deacons, in the manner of the Moderns ritual, and the Ancients had looked on the Royal Arch as the fourth degree, making the formation of a Chapter the duty of every lodge. These queries, prompted by a concern as to a creeping return, or even imposition, of Modernism on old Ancient's lodges, were ignored by Grand Lodge. This led to a more strongly worded remonstrance in 1820. As the local province failed to deal with increasing animosity, in 1822 the 34 masons who signed the last document were suspended by Grand Lodge, and one [[Liverpool]] lodge was erased. Although many of the rebels returned to the fold or left masonry altogether, the harshness of their treatment drew support from other lodges in the North West of England. A new Grand Lodge was formed in Liverpool in 1823, calling itself the '''Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of England according to the Old Constitutions'''. From 1825, it met only in [[Wigan]]. As the original dispute was gradually forgotten, its twelve or more lodges were re-absorbed by UGLE, although the last did not rejoin until 1913. It ceased to function as a Grand Lodge in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;E. B. Beesley, The History of the Wigan Grand Lodge, Manchester Association for Masonic Research, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Armenians}}
'''Armenians in Egypt''' are a community with a long history. They are a minority with their own language, churches, and social institutions. The number of [[Armenians]] in [[Egypt]] has decreased due to migrations to other countries and integration into the rest of Egyptian society, including extensive intermarriage with Muslims and Copts. Today they number about 6000, much smaller than a few generations ago. They are concentrated in [[Cairo]] and [[Alexandria]], the two largest cities. Economically the Egyptian Armenians have tended to be self-employed businessmen or craftsmen and to have more years of education than the Egyptian average.&lt;ref name=ayman&gt;Ayman Zohry, [http://www.zohry.com/pubs/ArmeniansinEgyptIUSSP.pdf "Armenians in Egypt"], International Union for the Scientific Study of Population: ''XXV International Population Conference'', year 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Armenians in Egypt have had a presence since the 6th and 7th centuries.&lt;ref name="hovhan"&gt;{{cite book|last=G. Hovannisian|first=Richard|title=The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times: Foreign dominion to statehood : the fifteenth century to the twentieth century|year=2004|pages=423|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s2ByErk19DAC&amp;pg=PA423&amp;dq=armenians+in+egypt&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-oybT_iJJ9PngQeo3JmjDw&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=armenians%20in%20egypt&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The early Armenian migrants to Egypt were Muslims. A migration of Armenian Christians to Egypt started in the early 19th century, and another wave occurred in the early 20th century.

The presence of Muslim Armenians in Egypt is well documented during and after the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]]. Islamized Armenians under Arab rule had visible military and government positions, such as governors, generals and [[vizier]]s (and the more notable individuals are listed by name further below).&lt;ref name=hovhan /&gt;

===Fatimid period===
This was a prosperous period for the Armenians in Egypt, when they enjoyed commercial, cultural and religious freedom. Their numbers increased considerably as more migrants arrived from [[Syria]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], fleeing the advance of the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]]s westward during the second half of the 10th century. Armenian Muslims started their political life in 1074, with an estimated population of 30,000 (possibly as high as 100,000) Armenians living in [[Fatimid Caliphate]] at the time.&lt;ref name=simon&gt;{{cite book|last=Payaslian|first=Simon|title=The History of Armenia: From the Origins to the Present|pages=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7J-g7Wld1vEC&amp;dq=egypt+armenian&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of [[vizier]]s of Armenian origin shaped the history of the Fatimid Caliphate, beginning with [[Badr al-Jamali]] and his son [[al-Afdal Shahanshah]], up until [[Tala'i ibn Ruzzik]] and his son [[Ruzzik ibn Tala'i]].

===Mamluk period===
Nearly 10,000 Armenians were captured, during invasions of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]], which took place between 1266 and 1375, and were brought to Egypt as ''[[mamluk]]s'' or slave-soldiers.&lt;ref name=kurk&gt;{{cite book|last=M. Kurkjian|first=Vahan|title=History of Armenia|year=1958|publisher=Armenian General Benevolent Union of America|page=246|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Asia/Armenia/_Texts/KURARM/30*.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were employed in agriculture and as craftsmen. The youngest were educated in army camps following the Mameluke system, and later employed in the army and the palace.

At the beginning of the 14th century, a schism occurred in the Armenian church, which caused Patriarch Sargis of Jerusalem to request and obtain a firman from the Sultan Al-Malik Al-Nasir. This brought the Armenians within the Mamluk realm under the jurisdiction of the Armenian Patriarchate of [[Jerusalem]]. The schismatic Armenians who came to Egypt were given permission to practice their religion freely. Their patriarch's authority over the Armenian community's private and public affairs was decisive. The churches and those who served them were supported by the generosity of the faithful and the revenues deriving from charitable foundations.

===Mohamed Ali period===
[[File:Nubar Pasha.jpg|right|thumb|Armenian [[Nubar Pasha]] was the first [[Prime Minister of Egypt]]]]
The reign of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] (1805–1849) witnessed strong migration streams of Armenians to Egypt. Mohamed Ali hired Armenians in government positions, and the Armenians were given great opportunities to contribute to the socioeconomic development of Egypt.&lt;ref name=hovhan /&gt; The era of Mohamed Ali witnessed building Armenian churches in Egypt; one for the Armenian Orthodox and another one for the Armenian Catholics. The number of Armenians immigrants to Egypt around this time is estimated at 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paul Adalian|first=Rouben|title=Historical Dictionary of Armenia|year=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=226|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QS-vSjHObOYC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=armenians+in+egypt&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-oybT_iJJ9PngQeo3JmjDw&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=armenians%20in%20egypt&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boghos Youssufian (1768–1844) was an Armenian banker and businessman. In 1837, Muhammad Ali appointed Boghos as head of the Diwan Al-Tijara (bureau of commerce) and overseer of other financial affairs for Mohamed Ali.

In 1876 the Armenian Nubar Nubarian (1825–1899) became the first Prime Minister in modern Egypt.

Starting from the 19th century Egypt became one of the centers of Armenian political and cultural life. Many prominent Armenians of that period, including [[Komitas]], [[Andranik]] and [[Martiros Sarian]] visited Egypt. The [[Armenian General Benevolent Union]] was founded in Cairo in 1906. The first Armenian film with Armenian subject called "Haykakan Sinema" was produced in 1912 in Cairo by Armenian-Egyptian publisher Vahan Zartarian. The film was premiered in Cairo on March 13, 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Armenian Cinema 100, by [[Artsvi Bakhchinyan]], Yerevan, 2012, pp. 111-112&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-genocide (1915-1952)===
The [[Armenian Genocide]] started on 24 April 1915 with the [[deportation of Armenian notables in 1915|deportation of Armenian intellectuals]]. The [[Armenian diaspora|Armenian communities]] in Egypt received some percentage of the refugees and survivors of the massacres in Turkey.  The total number of Armenians in Egypt in 1917 was 12,854 inhabitants. They increased to reach its peak in 1927 census data where their total number was 17,188 inhabitants most of whom were concentrated in [[Cairo]] and [[Alexandria]]. Some independent estimates push the number of Armenians in Egypt to 40,000 inhabitants at the beginning of year 1952.&lt;ref name=ayman /&gt; 

Armenian community life in Egypt revolved around the Armenian Apostolic Church and, to a lesser extent, the Armenian Catholic Church. Over 80% of the adult Armenian population in Egypt worked as skilled [[Armenian craftsmen|craftsmen]] or in administrative positions, wholesale, retail and services. A very small number of Amerians, only around 5 per cent, worked as unskilled laborers; even fewer were [[landowners]] or [[farmer]]s. Egyptian Armenians were relatively prosperous compared to Armenians in other [[Middle Eastern]] countries; of the 150,000 Middle Eastern Armenians who emigrated to [[Soviet Armenia]] between 1946-48, only 4,000 were Egyptian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0026-3141| volume = 28| issue = 1| pages = 19–32| last = Hovannisian| first = Richard G.| title = The Ebb and Flow of the Armenian Minority in the Arab Middle East| journal = Middle East Journal| accessdate = 2018-11-23| date = 1974| url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/4325183| jstor = 4325183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1952 Revolution|1952 revolution]] led by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] many Armenians began to emigrate to [[Europe]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]].

===After the 1952 Revolution===
A reverse migration, not to the original homelands, but rather to the West, was observed among Armenian Egyptians starting in around 1956. 1956 saw the introduction of what are called the “Socialist Laws” in Egypt and the nationalization of many economic sectors under the Nasser regime. Since Armenian Egyptians at that time worked predominantly in the private sector and tended to monopolize basic professions and trade markets, the so-called Socialist Laws affected them more than those working in the government or in agriculture. Many migrants concluded – mistakenly or correctly – that they were threatened by the new policies of the Nasser regime and many left Egypt and migrated to the West. Since 1956 the total number of Armenian Egyptians has decreased. Accurate figures of how many left and how many are still there are not available since questions on ethnicity have not been included in censuses since the 1952 revolution.

==Present day==
Most Egyptian Armenians today, who are permanent residents of Egypt, were born in Egypt and are Egyptian citizens. [[Armenia]] to them is the collection of folkloric stories and cultural practices that each generation hands to its successor. Armenian Egyptians are full Egyptians with an extra cultural layer. They number around 6,000 and live primarily in Cairo.&lt;ref name=ayman /&gt;

Today structures such as clubs, schools, and sports facilities reinforce communications among Armenian Egyptians and revive the heritage of their forefathers. In spite of these efforts, many Armenian Egyptians of the youngest generation (and who are mostly the result of marriages between the Armenian community and other [[Egyptians]] - whether Christian or Muslim) do not speak the [[Armenian language]], or go to Armenian schools, and are not in touch with their heritage or community. The Armenian Church and the apolitical structure of the Armenian community have a very important role in unifying Armenians in Egypt. Unlike Armenian minorities in [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]], Armenian Egyptians stay out of local politics.

The Prelacy of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] in [[Egypt]], which is under the jurisdiction of Holy Etchmiadzin, is the primary guardian of community assets such as endowments, real estate in the form of agricultural land, and other property bequeathed by generations of philanthropists.

===Politics===
Egyptian Armenians are very rarely involved in present-day Egyptian politics, unlike the Armenian minorities in [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]]. However, many are employed in different political and apolitical Egyptian institutions. The Armenian Church and the apolitical structure of the institutions in the Egyptian Armenian community have a very important role in unifying the Armenians in Egypt.

===Culture===
The Armenian community operates a number of associations, including:
*The Armenian Red Cross Association
*The [[Armenian General Benevolent Union]] (founded in Egypt)
*Housaper Cultural Association.

The community has four social clubs in Cairo and two in Alexandria, in addition to three sporting clubs in the capital and two in Alexandria. There is one home for the elderly, and many activities for young people, including a dance troupe, Zankezour, a choir, Zevartnots, and a children's choir, Dzaghgasdan.

===Journalism===
Today, in Egypt, there are two daily papers and one weekly publication, all affiliated to Armenian political parties.
 
*''[[Housaper]]'', a daily belonging to the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] (Tashnag Party), was founded in 1913;
*''[[Arev (daily)|Arev]]'', a daily, put out by the [[Armenian Democratic Liberal Party]] (Ramgavar Party), was founded in 1915
*''[[Tchahagir]]'', a weekly founded in 1948 belonging to the [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party]] (Hentchag Party).

Periodicals and newsletters include:
*''[[Arev Monthly]]'', published 1997-2009 in Arabic as a supplement to ''Arev'' daily. It was published by the Armenian Democratic Liberal Party.
*''[[Arek Monthly]]'', started publishing in April 2010 in Arabic. It is published by the Armenian General Benevolent Union.
*''AGBU Deghegadou'', published since 1996 by the [[Armenian General Benevolent Union]] in [[Cairo]] as a newsletter covering AGBU's activities
*''Dzidzernag'', a musical quarterly supplement published by [[Arev (daily)|Arev Daily]] starting 2001

===Sports===
There are a number of Sports clubs including: 
*Homenetmen Gamk, Alexanadria founded in 1912
*Homenetmen Ararat, Cairo founded in 1914
*AGBU Nubar, Alexandria founded in 1924
*AGBU Nubar, Cairo founded in 1958
*St. Theresa Club Cairo founded in 1969

Sports played include [[association football]] (soccer), [[basketball]] and [[table tennis]]. Almost all the clubs also have scouting activities.

===Schools and institutions===
The first Armenian school in Egypt, the Yeghiazarian Religious School, was established in 1828 at Bein Al-Sourein. In 1854, the school was moved to Darb Al-Geneina and the name was changed to Khorenian, after the Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi. In 1904, [[Nubar Pasha]], an Armenian statesman, moved the Khorenian School to Boulaq. In 1907, he founded the [[Kalousdian Armenian School]] and kindergarten on Galaa Street (downtown Cairo), which is currently defunct. The second Armenian school in Egypt was founded in 1890 by Boghos Youssefian in Alexandria, and is called Boghossian School. The newest Armenian school is Nubarian in Heliopolis, founded in 1925 with a donation from Boghos Nubar. Now, Kalousdian school &amp; Nubarian are merged as one school in Heliopolis area, Cairo.

The three Armenian schools in Egypt eventually integrate a K-12 program. Armenian 6 schools in Egypt are partially supported by the Prelacy of the Armenian Church in Egypt. Armenian education is very important in maintaining Armenian language among the Armenian community in Egypt. In Addition, Armenian language is the only language that Armenians use within their families and communities.
The three Armenian schools in Egypt eventually integrated a secondary education programme; students who have graduated can immediately enter the Egyptian university system, after passing the official Thanawiya 'Amma (High School) exams.

===Church===
[[File:Armenian_Catholic_Cemetery_of_Cairo.jpg|thumb|right|Armenian Catholic Cemetery of Cairo]]
Armenian Egyptians are divided into Armenian Apostolic (known also as Orthodox or at times Gregorian) belonging to the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] and Armenian Catholic communities belonging to the [[Armenian Catholic Church]]. There are also some Egyptian Armenians who are members of Armenian Evangelical churches.

There are five main Armenian churches in Egypt, two in Alexandria and three in Cairo.

Armenian Orthodox community comprise the majority of Armenian Egyptians. 
The Armenian Apostolic churches include:
* Paul and Peter Armenian Apostolic Church (Alexandria)
* St. Gregory the Illuminator Armenian Apostolic Church (Sourp Krikor Lousavoritch Armenian Apostolic Church)(in Cairo).

The Prelacy of the Armenian Church in Egypt, which is under the jurisdiction of See of Holy [[Echmiadzin]], is the primary guardian of community assets such as endowments, real estate in the form of agricultural land and other property bequeathed by generations of philanthropists.

The Armenian Catholic community has two churches:
* Armenian Catholic Patriarchate and the Church of the Assumption (Cairo)
* Armenian Catholic Patriarchate (in Alexandria)
* St. Therese Armenian Catholic Church (Heliopolis, Cairo)

==List of famous Armenians in Egypt==

===From Abbasid Era in the 7th century to the Ottoman Era of early 19th century===
Among the most prominent Armenians in Egypt between the Abbasid Era in the 7th century to the Ottoman Era of the early 19th century were:
    
* Vartan the Standard Bearer, or Wardan al-Rumi al-Armani, who saved the life of Amr Ibn al-‘As, the commander of the Arab army at the [[Siege of Alexandria (641)|Siege of Alexandria]] in 641. From this Vartan Al-Rumi comes the name of a market in [[Fustat]] known as the Vartan Market.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}
* [[Ali al-Armani|Ali Ibn Yahya Abu’l Hassan al-Armani]] – the governor of Egypt in 841 and 849, appointed by the Abbasid Caliph, the spiritual and political guide and leader of Muslims at Baghdad. The courage of Ali, "[who was] versed in the science of war," is praised by the mediaeval Islamic historian Ibn Taghribirdi.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}
* Ahmed Ibn Tulun - the new prefect who in 876 was commissioned by Ibn Khatib Al-Ferghani to construct his mosque in his garrison town Al-Qata’i.
* Ibn Khatib Al-Ferghani - the master builder of Armenian ancestry who rebuilt the [[Nilometer]] on the southern tip of [[Rawda Island]] to measure the rise of the water level at the annual inundation of the Nile, a critical factor for the prosperity of Egypt.
* [[Badr al-Jamali]] - a manumitted slave of Armenian descent was called by Caliph al-Muntasir in 1073 to assist him during the Fatimid period when Egypt was weakened by inner strife and ravaged by drought, famine and epidemics. Badr’s army, composed of mainly Armenian soldiers, is believed to have been formed after the fall of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Bagratuni]] capital, [[Ani]] (1066) when waves of Armenian refugees sought shelter in other countries. Badr al-Jamali was the first military man to become the Vezir (minister) of the Sword and the Pen, thus setting the trend for a century of mostly Armenian Vezirs with the same monopoly of civilian and military powers. At the height of their power, the Armenian Vezir could count on the personal loyalty of more than 20,000 men.
* [[Al-Afdal Shahanshah|Al-Afdal]], the son of Badr al-Jamali constructed the Palace of Vezirate, or Dar al Wizarra, besides creating two public parks with exotic gardens, and a recreation area with a man-made lake called Birket al Arman, or Armenian Lake.
* Three brothers – all architects and masons skilled in cutting and dressing stones, who constructed the three monumental gates of Cairo: Bab al-Nasr and Bab al-Futuh in 1087 and Bab Zuwayla in 1092. The gates with their flanking towers still stand today. The ramparts and gates, which have a certain similarity to the fortifications of the Bagratuni Capital Ani, are regarded as masterpieces of military architecture by international standards.
* Bahram al-Armani – who, after restoring order and peace in the country at the request of Caliph al-Hafiz, was appointed by the latter as the Vezir in 1135.
* Baha al-Din Karakush - a eunuch and a Mamluk of the Kurdish general Shirkuh who in 1176 constructed a fortress, the Citadel, on the southeastern ridge of the Muqattam Hills and enclosed the new and old capitals, Cairo and Fustat, within a wall protected by the Citadel. Until the middle of the 19th century, the Citadel built by Karakush served as the seat of government fulfilling dual military and political functions.
* Shagarat Al-Durr (or Tree of Pearls) - a female slave who dazzled everyone with her spectacular display of gold and precious stone ornaments. She was sent to Egypt by the Abbasid Caliph al-Musta’sim as a gift to Sultan Salih Nagm al-Din Ayyub and became his favorite wife during his aging years. This strong-willed former slave wielded absolute power over Egypt during the transition period to Mamluk rule. She is one of the rare women in Islamic history who have ascended the throne and made a difference in the political and cultural spheres.
* Sinan Pasha - the Ottoman Empire’s chief architect of Armenian descent, who constructed the historic Mosque of Bulaq, as well as Cairo’s grain market, and Bulaq’s public bathroom (Hammam).
* Amir Suleyman Bey al-Armani - held the position of Governor of Munnifeya and Gharbiyya provinces in 1690 and was so wealthy that he had Mamluks at his service.
* Ali al-Armani and Ali Bey al-Armani Abul Azab - served as regional commanders.
* Mustafa Jabarti - a Mamluk of Armenian descent from [[Tbilisi]] was a deputy of the agha or chief of ojak, and amassed a great fortune. He bought properties in the Armenian populated al-Zuwayla quarter and made donations to Armenians through his sister. He also built a hospice on the top floor of the quarter’s St. Sarkis Church, to shelter Armenian immigrants, pilgrims and migrant workers, in need of temporary lodgings.
* Muhammad Kehia al-Armani – an incorruptible leader who in 1798 was sent to negotiate with Napoleon Bonaparte in Alexandria to spare the population of Cairo. Napoleon was so impressed by the conciliatory tone, the political astuteness, and the diplomatic skill of the Mamluk of Armenian descent that he later appointed him the Head of Cairo’s Political Affairs Administration.
* Rustam (or Petros) - a native of [[Karabakh]] was brought to Egypt as a slave soldier. He accompanied Napoleon to France as his bodyguard, fought with the French army at the famous battle of Austerlitz, and then took part in the conquest of Spain.
* Apraham Karakehia - an eminent money changer was asked for financial help by Mohammed Ali. The Armenian money changer supported Muhammad Ali’s projects and plans and was afterwards appointed the financial representative of the Albanian General. Karakehia would become Egypt’s money changer, with the honorary title of Misser Sarrafi. That position and title would belong to the Karakehia family for generations to come.
* Mahdesi Yeghiazar Amira Bedrossian – another money changer from Agin who was named the Wali’s, or Governor’s, tax collector and special counselor. The Armenian money lender not only regulated the financial services and the taxation system but also initiated safeguards against illegal land seizures. At “various times, Armenian money lenders held the sole rights of exploiting the Cairo bathhouses, the salt mines of Matariya and the fish market of Damietta.” The influence of the Armenian money lenders increased even more during the 1830s, when due to the Russo-Turkish war and open persecution of Armenians, many merchants and financiers settles in Egypt and even succeeded in launching Egypt’s first bank, which operated from 1837 to 1841.
* [[Yuhanna al-Armani]] - artist and Coptic icon painter who lived and worked in Cairo

===Contributors to the modern Egypt===
{{Main|List of Egyptian Armenians}}

Armenians have historically contributed prominently to the Egyptian public life, be it in politics, economics, business and academic circles as well as in all facets of the arts.

Suffice to mention that [[Nubar Pasha]], a prominent politician became the First [[Prime Minister of Egypt]]. [[Alexander Saroukhan]] is considered one of the prominent caricaturists who set the standards for the art of caricature in the Arab World.

According to media, modern sculptor [[Armen Agop]] is among the artists from Egypt that are changing perspectives on contemporary art from [[North Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://revolutionartnow.altervista.org/5-egyptian-artists-working-innovative-practices-c-xuan-mai-ardia/|title=5 Egyptian artists working with innovative practices (by C. A. Xuan Mai Ardia) {{!}} •• REVOLUTION ART ••|date=2015-02-07|work=•• REVOLUTION ART  ••|access-date=2018-03-17|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diaspora==
Because of a rise of nationalism and pan-Arabism joined with confiscation of civil rights and economic freedoms, many Egyptians of Armenian descent decided in the late 1950s and during the 1960s to leave the country in many thousands to Europe and the Americas (United States, Canada, Latin America) and Australia. This greatly reduced the number of the Egyptian Armenian community in Egypt.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

However the migrating Egyptian Armenians remained attached to their homeland Egypt and kept the Egyptian Armenian traditions and established their own associations in the [[new diaspora]] away from their country Egypt. They also actively contributed to the institutions still working in Egypt (churches, schools, clubs, cultural activities etc.). We can mention for example the Association of Armenians from Egypt in Montreal, Canada and many others in the United States.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The '''Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Sections 77, 78 and 79 of the Constitution of Botswana''', also known as the '''Balopi Commission''' after the chairman of the commission [[Patrick Balopi]], is a [[Botswana]] [[Royal Commission|commission of inquiry]] set up on 28 July 2000 in response to perceived tribal inequality between the dominant [[Tswana people|Batswana]] and the smaller minority tribes such as the [[Yeyi people|Wayeyi]].{{efn|Like other ethnic groups in Botswana, prefixes are used to describe different aspects of the group. For example, a singular Yeyi person is called a ''Muyeyi'', the [[Yeyi people]] are called ''Wayeyi'', the [[Yeyi language]] is called ''Shiyeyi''. A singular Tswana person is a ''Motswana'', the [[Tswana people]] are called ''Batswana'', and the [[Tswana language]] is called ''Setswana''.}}

In 1995, [[Lydia Nyati-Ramahobo]], a professor at the [[University of Botswana]], founded the [[Kamanakao Association]], an organization that aims "to develop and maintain the Shiyeyi [[Yeyi language|language]] and culture."{{sfn|Our Objectives}} The [[Yeyi people|Wayeyi]] are a [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] minority group under the [[Tawana tribe|Batawana]] umbrella.{{sfn|Gulbrandsen|2012|p=215}} Due to feelings of oppression under the Batawana,{{efn|[[Lydia Nyati-Ramahobo]] said that the Wayeyi "grieved about the present chiefship and passionately expressed their strong feeling that they were not free, as long as they were under the rule of a [[Tawana tribe|Motawana]] chief imposed by the government."{{sfn|Gulbrandsen|2012|p=215}}}} the Wayeyi, with the help of the Kamanakao Association, installed their own [[paramount chief]], [[Shikati Calvin Kamanakao]],{{efn|''Shikati'' is "paramount chief" in Shiyeyi.}} on 24 April 1999, which was in disagreement with the [[Chieftainship Act]], the [[Tribal Land Territory Act]], and [https://www.webcitation.org/69RFCfQsa?url=http://www.commonlii.org/bw/legis/const/1966/1.html sections 77-79] of the [[Constitution of Botswana]].{{sfn|Gulbrandsen|2012|p=215}} The Deputy Attorney General Ian Kirby responded by letter to the Wayeyi on 15 July 1999, writing that since the Wayeyi are not a recognized tribe, they could not have their own chief.{{sfn|Reteng|2007|p=14}}{{efn|The Wayeyi were able to install their own chief after a lawsuit in May 2006.{{sfn|Nyati-Ramahobo|pp=5}}}}

Because of the Wayeyi conflict and a parliamentary motion{{efn|The motion previously failed in parliament on two separate occasions: once in 1969 by [[Philip Matante]] and once in 1988 by [[Maitshwarelo Dabutha]].{{sfn|Reteng|2007|p=14}}}} by [[Olifant Mfa]] on 17 February 1995 to rewrite sections 77-79 of the [[Constitution of Botswana|Constitution]] to be "tribally neutral", President [[Festus Mogae]] appointed twenty-one people to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Section 77, 78 and 79 of the Constitution of Botswana, otherwise known as the Balopi Commission after the chairman of the commission [[Patrick Balopi]].{{sfn|Ray|Quinlan|Sharma|Clarke|2011|p=484}} The commission was charged with three tasks: "(a) To review sections 77, 78, and 79 of the [[constitution of Botswana]] and to seek a construction that would eliminate any interpretation that renders the sections discriminatory; (b)	 To review and propose the most effective method of selecting members of the [[Ntlo ya Dikgosi|House of Chiefs]]; and (c)	 To propose and recommend measures to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the House of Chiefs."{{sfn|Ray|Quinlan|Sharma|Clarke|2011|p=484}}

==Methodology==
In order to collect public opinions, the members of the commission visited 41 villages and towns, held 43 public meetings, listened to 38 oral submissions, and received 10 group and 40 individual written submissions.{{sfn|Nyati-Ramahobo|pp=7-8}} The meetings were held in the traditional [[kgotla|dikgotla]]{{efn|''Kgotla'' is the Setswana word for "public meeting".}} of the tribes.{{sfn|Gulbrandsen|2012|p=216}}

==Recommendations==
The commission made the following recommendations in the "[[White Paper]] No.1 of 2001":
*Even if sections 77-79 are not unfair, they, and any other mention of a specific tribe, should be removed from the Constitution due to the citizens' perception that they are discriminatory.
*The word "chief" in the Constitution, a remnant of the British monarchy, should be replaced with the word ''[[kgosi]]''.
*The House of Chiefs of Botswana should continue to exist as it represents the country's unity, and it should be renamed ''{{lang|tn|[[Ntlo ya Dikgosi]]}}'', which the government did in 2008 with the [[Bogosi Act]].
*The members of the House of Chiefs should not be allowed to join [[List of political parties in Botswana|political parties]].
*Members should be chosen based on tribal territorial claims, creating geographically based representation rather than the old method of specifying which tribes can have [[ex officio member]]s in the House.

==Reactions==
The president was praised for his efforts by the minority Batswapong in eastern Botswana but was heavily criticised by the [[Mangwato tribe|Bamangwato]] because they felt it would "place their paramount chief [and then Vice President of Botswana] [[Ian Khama]] on the same level as chiefs from inferior tribes."{{sfn|Gulbrandsen|2012|p=217}} The [[Bogosi Act]] was passed in 2008, replacing the [[Chieftainship Act]]. This act removed references of the word "chief" and changed them to kgosi.

===Revision===
A revision of the recommendations was made in April 2002 titled the "White Paper No.2 of 2002" which opted to let the selection process for the House remain the same: the eight [[kgosi|dikgosi]] of the main tribes would retain their posts,{{sfn|Gulbrandsen|2012|p=218}} a move that the House of Chiefs itself approved.{{sfn|Ray|Quinlan|Sharma|Clarke|2011|p=493}} President Mogae went on further visits around the country in May 2002 to hold debates about future changes to the constitution, but the consensus among the citizens remains dissatisfied.{{sfn|Nyati-Ramahobo|pp=8}} Minister of Health [[Joy Phumaphi]] said that the revision "is a compromise and it does not remove discrimination."{{sfn|Ray|Quinlan|Sharma|Clarke|2011|p=490}} Other ministers felt that they did not have enough time to provide feedback to the revision process.{{sfn|Ray|Quinlan|Sharma|Clarke|2011|p=491}} A 2007 study by the University of Botswana found that "a significant number of respondents suggest that the Constitution should be reviewed so that it equally recognizes all cultures found in Botswana".{{sfn|Nyati-Ramahobo|pp=8}}

After the [[Partition of India]] in 1947, they comprised the demographic majority of Pakistan until the independence of East Pakistan (historic East Bengal) as Bangladesh in 1971.

==Identity==
A [[Bengalis|Bengali]] is a person of ethnic and linguistic heritage from the [[Bengal]] region in South Asia speaking the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] [[Bengali language]]. [[Islam]] arrived in the first millennium and influenced the native Bengali culture. The influx of Persian, Turkic, [[Arab]] and [[Mughal people|Mughal]] settlers contributed further diversity to the cultural development of the region.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gKhChF3yAOUC|title=The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier, 1204-1760|first=Richard Maxwell|last=Eaton|date=1 January 1996|publisher=University of California Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, historians including Richard Maxwell Eaton, [[Ahmed Sharif]], [[Muhammad Mohar Ali]] and [[Jadunath Sarkar]] are in agreement that the bulk of Muslims are descended from [[Buddhists]] who were converted to Islam by missionaries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ali|first1=Mohammad Mohar|title=History of the Muslims of Bengal, Vol 1|date=1988|publisher=Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud Islamic University|isbn=9840690248|pages=683, 404|edition=2|url=http://www.bmri.org.uk/book_reviews/NEWLIGHT-MUSLIM-BENGAL.pdf|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Today, most Bengali Muslims live in the modern state of Bangladesh, the world's third largest Muslim-majority country, along with the Indian states of West Bengal and Assam.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The dominant majority of Bengali Muslims are [[Sunni]]s who follow the [[Hanafi]] school of jurisprudence. There are also minorities of [[Shia]]s and [[Ahmadiya]]s, as well as people who identify as [[non-denominational Muslim|non-denominational]] (or "just a Muslim").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-1-religious-affiliation/|title=Chapter 1: Religious Affiliation|date= 9 August 2012 |website=Pewforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|History of Bengal}}

===Pre-Islamic history===
Rice-cultivating communities existed in Bengal since the second millennium BCE. The region was home to a large agriculturalist population influenced by [[Indian religions]], but was not fully integrated into the [[caste system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gKhChF3yAOUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=rise+of+islam+and+the+bengal+frontier&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1nYmnmcTOAhVLqY8KHcqlD4QQ6AEICjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=rise%20of%20islam%20and%20the%20bengal%20frontier&amp;f=false |title=The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier, 1204-1760 |author=Richard Maxwell Eaton |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism]] influenced the region in the first millennium. The Bengali language developed from [[Apabhramsa]] and [[Magadhi Prakrit]] between the 7th and 10th centuries. It once formed a single Indo-Aryan branch with [[Assamese language|Assamese]] and [[Oriya language|Oriya]], before the languages became distinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.britannica.com/topic/Bengali-language |title=Bengali language &amp;#124; Britannica.com |website=Global.britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early explorers===
Early Muslim traders and merchants visited  Bengal  while traversing the [[Silk Road]] in the first millennium. One of the earliest mosques in South Asia is under excavation in northern Bangladesh, indicating the presence of Muslims in the area around the lifetime of the [[Prophet Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/video/asia/2012/08/201281852948844588.html |title=Ancient mosque unearthed in Bangladesh |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=2012-08-18 |accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 9th century, Muslim merchants increased trade with Bengali seaports.&lt;ref name="banglapedia1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Arabs,_The |title=Arabs, The&amp;nbsp;— Banglapedia |website=En.banglapedia.org |date=2014-06-17 |accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coins of the Abbasid Caliphate have been discovered in many parts of the region.&lt;ref name="banglapedia2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Coins |title=Coins&amp;nbsp;— Banglapedia |website=En.banglapedia.org |date=2015-03-04 |accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Islamic kingdoms===
[[File:Shait Gumbad Mosque (28116770771).jpg|thumb|alt=Exterior of a low mosque with many domes and entrances|left|The 15th-century [[Sixty Dome Mosque]] built during the [[Bengal Sultanate]] is now a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]]]
The [[Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent]] took place between the 12th and 16th centuries. Bengal became a province of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] in 1204. In the 14th century the [[Sultanate of Bengal]] became independent and emerged as a regional power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFyd95ECLwkC|title=The Bengal Sultanate: Politics, Economy and Coins, A.D. 1205-1576|first=Syed Ejaz|last=Hussain|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Manohar|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; It adopted Bengali as one of its [[official language]]s, alongside [[Persian language|Persian]], the diplomatic language of the Islamic world, and [[Arabic]], the [[liturgical]] language of the religion. The Sultanate also ruled parts of [[Kingdom of Arakan|Arakan]] and [[Assam]]. The [[Sur Empire]] briefly overtook the region in the 16th century. During the sultanate period, Hindu aristocrats occupied prominent positions in the administration.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
[[File:Bengal Sultanate.png|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[Bengal Sultanate]], 16th century]]
The [[Mughal Empire]] eventually controlled the region under its [[Bengal Subah]] viceregal province. The [[Mughal Emperor]]s considered Bengal their most prized province. [[Emperor Akbar]] redeveloped the [[Bengali calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shoaib Daniyal |url=http://scroll.in/article/720351/bengali-new-year-how-akbar-invented-the-modern-bengali-calendar |title=Bengali New Year: how Akbar invented the modern Bengali calendar |website=Scroll.in |date= |accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aurangazeb|Emperor Aurangazeb]] called Bengal the ''Paradise of Nations''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.dhakatribune.com/heritage/2014/dec/20/paradise-nations |title=The paradise of nations &amp;#124; Dhaka Tribune |website=Archive.dhakatribune.com |date=2014-12-20 |accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two Bengal viceroys{{snd}}[[Muhammad Azam Shah]] and [[Azim-us-Shan]]{{snd}}assumed the imperial throne. Mughal Bengal became increasingly independent under the [[Nawabs of Bengal]] in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wyoxDAAAQBAJ|title=Transitions&amp;nbsp;– History and Civics&amp;nbsp;– 8|first=Shiladitya|last=Ghosh|publisher=Vikas Publishing House|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamization===
The [[agrarian reform]]s of the Mughal Empire also played a crucial role in developing Bengali Muslim society. According to historian Richard M. Eaton, Islam became the religion of the [[plough]] in the [[Bengal delta]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com.bd"/&gt; The delta was the most fertile region in the empire. Mughal development projects cleared forests and established thousands of Sufi-led villages, which became industrious farming and craftsmanship communities.&lt;ref name="thedailystar.net"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hissam Khandker |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/op-ed/politics/which-india-claiming-have-been-colonised-119284 |title=Which India is claiming to have been colonised? |publisher=The Daily Star |date= |accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The projects were most evident in the [[Bhati (region)|Bhati]] region of East Bengal, the most fertile part of the delta.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gKhChF3yAOUC&amp;redir_esc=y |title=The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier, 1204-1760 |author=Richard Maxwell Eaton |website=Books.google.com |date=1997-10-01 |accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People from various parts of the [[Muslim world]] settled in the region. Settlers intermarried with the local population.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.bd"/&gt; This made East Bengal a thriving [[melting pot]] with strong trade and cultural networks. It was the most prosperous part of the subcontinent.&lt;ref name="thedailystar.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sxhAtCflwOMC&amp;pg=PA366&amp;lpg=PA366&amp;dq=bengal+most+fertile+salma+farooqi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UIOTZZDdpG&amp;sig=PLS8MYkpk7Ge01BSMUAV2qBOLFM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5zvXowcbOAhUDO48KHSEVDj8Q6AEICzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bengal%20most%20fertile%20salma%20farooqi&amp;f=false |title=A Comprehensive History of Medieval India: Twelfth to the Mid-Eighteenth Century |author=Farooqui Salma Ahmed |page=366 |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; East Bengal became the center of the Muslim population in the eastern subcontinent and corresponds to modern-day Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===British period===
[[File:A K Fazlul Huq.jpg|thumb|[[A. K. Fazlul Huq]], known as the  '''Sher-e-Bangla''' ('''Tiger of Bengal'''), was the 1st [[Prime Minister of Bengal]].]]
The region fell to the control of the [[British Empire]] in 1757.

British-ruled Bengal was a hotbed of anti-colonial rebellion. In the early 19th century, [[Titumir]] led a peasant uprising against colonial rule. [[Haji Shariatullah]] led the [[Faraizi movement]], advocating [[Islamic revivalism]].&lt;ref name="bp-faraizi"&gt;{{cite book |last=Khan |first=Muin-ud-Din Ahmed |year=2012 |chapter=Faraizi Movement |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Faraizi_Movement |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Faraizis sought to create a [[caliphate]] and cleanse the region's Muslim society of what they deemed "un-Islamic practices". They were successful in galvanizing the Bengali peasantry against colonial authorities. However, the movement suffered crackdowns after the [[Mutiny of 1857]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campo |first=Juan Eduardo |year=2009 |title=Encyclopedia of Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&amp;pg=PA226 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |pages=226– |isbn=978-1-4381-2696-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lost impetus after the death of Haji Shariatullah's son [[Dudu Miyan]].&lt;ref name="bp-faraizi" /&gt;

After 1870, Muslims began seeking English education increasingly. Under the leadership of [[Sir Syed Ahmed Khan]] the promotion the English language among [[Indian Muslims|Muslims of India]] also influenced Bengali Muslim society.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mukhapadhay |first1=Keshab |date=13 May 2005 |title=An interview with prof.

The creation of [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]] established visions for a sovereign Muslim-majority homeland in the eastern subcontinent.  Low income Muslims after passing matriculation, looked for jobs as clerks, peons and orderlies but Hindu ''[[Babu (title)|babus]]'' refused to employ them.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; So, instigated by the British, upper class Muslims formed the [[Muslim League (Opposition)|Muslim League]] in Dhaka in 1906.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The early Muslim League dominated politics in East Bengal. [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]] was the first [[Prime Minister of Bengal]] under British rule. Bengali Muslims also dominated politics in [[Colonial Assam]], where [[Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani]] emerged as a populist leader. [[Muhammed Saadulah]] served as the first Prime Minister of Assam.

===1947 Partition and Bangladesh===
[[File:Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1950.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]]]]
An important moment in the history of Bengali [[self-determination]] was the [[Lahore Resolution]] in 1940, which was promoted by British Bengal premier A. K. Fazlul Huq. The resolution initially called for the creation of a [[sovereign state]] in the "Eastern Zone" of [[British India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--[if IE 6]&gt; &lt;![endif]--&gt; |url=http://www.alarabiya.net/views/2009/03/24/69098.html |title=Do we know anything about Lahore Resolution? |website=Alarabiya.net |date=2009-03-24 |accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its text was later changed by the top leadership of the Muslim League. Despite calls from liberal Bengali Muslim League leaders for an independent [[United Bengal]], the British moved forward with the [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Partition]] of Bengal and India in 1947. The [[Radcliffe Line]] made [[East Bengal]] a part of the [[Dominion of Pakistan]]. It was later renamed as [[East Pakistan]], with [[Dhaka]] as its capital. The [[All Pakistan Awami Muslim League]] was formed in Dhaka in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mitra |first1=Subrata Kumar |last2=Enskat |first2=Mike |last3=Spiess |first3=Clemens |date=2004|title=Political Parties in South Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dObxI9xahSYC&amp;pg=PA224 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |pages=224– |isbn=978-0-275-96832-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's name was later secularized as the [[Awami League]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harun-or-Rashid |year=2012 |chapter=Bangladesh Awami League |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangladesh_Awami_League |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was supported by the Bengali [[bourgeois]], agriculturalists, the middle class, and the [[intelligentsia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dObxI9xahSYC&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=awami+league+liberal+and+progressive+middle+class&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFs_aMwtLOAhXKLo8KHWKjDSkQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=awami%20league%20liberal%20and%20progressive%20middle%20class&amp;f=false |title=Political Parties in South Asia |page=217 |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Khawaja Nazimuddin]], [[Mohammad Ali of Bogra]], and [[H. S. Suhrawardy]] each served as Pakistan's prime minister during the 1950s; however, all three were deposed by the military-industrial complex in West Pakistan. The [[Bengali Language Movement]] in 1952 received strong support from Islamic groups, including the [[Tamaddun Majlish]]. [[Bengali nationalism]] increased in East Pakistan during the 1960s, particularly with the [[Six point movement]] for autonomy. The rise of pro-democracy and pro-independence movements in East Pakistan, with [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] as the principal leader, led to the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971.

Bangladesh was founded as a secular nation. In 1977, however, President [[Ziaur Rahman]], trying to consolidate his power under martial law, removed secularism from the constitution and replaced it with "a commitment to the values of Islam."&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=David |author-link=David Lewis (academic) |year=2011 |title=Bangladesh: Politics, Economy and Civil Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5lH40gT7xvYC&amp;pa=PG75 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=75, 83 |isbn=978-0-521-71377-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the [[Bangladesh Supreme Court]] reaffirmed secular principles in the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/171752.pdf |format=PDF |title=Bangladesh |website=U.S. State Department |access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science and technology==

The Bengali numerals are derived from ancient [[Indian mathematics]], which also influenced the development of [[Arabic numerals]] and science in the medieval Islamic world.

Historical Islamic kingdoms that existed in Bengal employed several clever technologies in numerous areas such as architecture, agriculture, civil engineering, water management, etc. The creation of canals and resoirvoirs was a common practice for the sultanate. New methods of irrigation were pioneered by the Sufis. Bengali mosque architecture featured terracotta, stone, wood and bamboo, with curved roofs, corner towers and multiple domes. During the Bengal Sultanate, a distinct regional style flourished which featured no minarets, but had richly designed [[mihrab]]s and [[minbar]]s as niches.

Islamic Bengal had a long history of textile weaving ] including export of [[muslin]] during the 17th and 18th centuries. Today, the weaving of [[Jamdani]] is classified by [[UNESCO]] as an [[intangible cultural heritage]].

Modern science was begun in Bengal under British colonial rule. Railways were introduced in 1862, making Bengal one of the earliest regions in the world to have a rail network. For the general population, opportunities for formal science education remained limited. The colonial government and the Bengali elite established several institutes for science education. The [[Nawabs of Dhaka]] established Ahsanullah School of Engineering which later became the [[Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology]].

In the second half of the 20th century, the Bengali Muslim American [[Fazlur Rahman Khan]] became one of the most important structural engineers in the world, helping design the world's tallest buildings. Another Bengali Muslim American, [[Jawed Karim]], was the co-founder of YouTube.

In 2016, the modernist Bait-ur-Rouf Mosque, inspired by the Bengal Sultanate-style of buildings, won the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]].

A large Bengali Muslim [[Bangladeshi diaspora|diaspora]] is found in the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]], which are home to several million expatriate workers from South Asia. A more well-established diaspora also resides in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and [[Pakistan]].

===Surnames===
{{Main article|Bengali Muslim Surname}}
Surnames in Bengali Muslim society reflect the region's cosmopolitan history. They are mainly of [[Arabic]] and [[Farsi|Persian]] origin, with a minority of secular Bengali surnames.

'''Art'''

[[Sheikh Zainuddin]] was a prominent Bengali Muslim artist in the 18th century during the colonial period. His works were inspired by the style of Mughal courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Zainuddin,_Sheikh|title=Zainuddin, Sheikh - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
Architecture is considered the supreme form of Islamic art. An indigenous style of Islamic architecture flourished in Bengal during the medieval Sultanate period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hasan |first=Perween |date=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uunyz4qFZwEC |title=Sultans and Mosques: The Early Muslim Architecture of Bangladesh |publisher=I.B.Tauris |accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terracotta]] and [[stone]] mosques with multiple domes proliferated in the region. Bengali Muslim architecture emerged as a synthesis of Bengali, Persian, Byzantine, and Mughal elements.

The [[Indo-Saracenic]] style influenced Islamic architecture in South Asia during the British Raj. A notable example of this period is [[Curzon Hall]]. Modern and contemporary Islamic architecture evolved in the region since the 1950s.

===Sufism===
{{See also|Sufism in Bangladesh}}
[[Sufi]] spiritual traditions are central to the Bengali Muslim way of life. The most common Sufi ritual is the [[Dhikr]], the practice of repeating the names of God after prayers. Sufi teachings regard the [[Prophet Muhammad]] as the primary perfect man who exemplifies the morality of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc-clio.com/ABC-CLIOCorporate/product.aspx?pc=A3880C |title=Muhammad in History, Thought, and Culture: An Encyclopedia of the Prophet of God |website=Abc-Clio.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufism is regarded as the individual internalization and intensification of the Islamic faith and practice. The Sufis played a vital role in developing Bengali Muslim society during the medieval period. Historic Sufi missionaries are regarded as [[saint]]s, including [[Shah Jalal]], [[Khan Jahan Ali]], [[Shah Paran|Shah Farhan]], Shah Amanat, and Khwaja Enayetpuri. Their [[mausoleum]]s are focal points for charity, religious congregations, and festivities.

The [[Qadiri]], Maizbhandaria, [[Naqshbandi]], [[Chishti]], [[Mujaddid]], [[Ahmadi]], Mohammadi, [[Suhrawardiyya|Soharwardi]] and [[Rifa'i|Rifai]] orders are among the most widespread Sufi orders in the region.&lt;ref name="sufismjournal.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sufismjournal.org/community/community.html|title=Sufism Journal: Community: Sufism in Bangladesh|work=sufismjournal.org}}{{self-published inline|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Syncretism====
As part of the conversion process, a [[Syncretism#Religious syncretism|syncretic version]] of mystical Sufi Islam was historically prevalent in medieval and early modern Bengal. The Islamic concept of [[tawhid]] was diluted into the veneration of [[Deva (Hinduism)|Hindu folk deities]], who were now regarded as [[Pir (Sufism)|pirs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Banu|first1=U.A.B.

===Literature===
[[File:Kazi nazrul islam with Setar.jpg|thumb|[[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], the national poet of Bangladesh]]
While proto-Bengali emerged during the pre-Islamic period, the Bengali literary tradition crystallized during the Islamic period. As Persian and Arabic were prestige languages, they significantly influenced [[vernacular]] Bengali literature. The first efforts to popularize Bengali among Muslim writers was by the Sufi poet Nur Qutb Alam.&lt;ref name="blogs.edgehill.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.edgehill.ac.uk/sacs/files/2012/07/Document-6-Billah-A.-M.-M.-A-The-Development-of-Bengali-Literature-during-Muslim-Rule.pdf |title=The development of Bengali literature during Muslim rule |website=Blogs.edgehill.ac.uk |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Karim |first=Abdul |year=2012 |chapter=Nur Qutb Alam |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Nur_Qutb_Alam |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poet established the ''Rikhta'' tradition which saw poems written in half Persian and half colloquial Bengali. The invocation tradition saw Bengali Muslim poets re-adapting Indian epics by replacing invocations of Hindu gods and goddesses with figures of Islam. The romantic tradition was pioneered by [[Shah Muhammad Sagir]], whose work on ''[[Yusuf and Zulaikha]]'' was widely popular among the people of Bengal.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rizvi|first1=S.N.H.|title=East Pakistan District Gazetteers|journal=GOVERNMENT OF EAST PAKISTAN SERVICES AND GENERAL ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT|date=1965|issue=1|page=353|url=http://dl.nlb.gov.bd/greenstone/collect/admin-books/index/assoc/HASHe169/d1b0804f.dir/EAST%20PAKISTAN%20DISTRICT%20GAZETTEER%20CHITTAGONG%20-%20page%201.pdf|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable romantic works included ''Layla Madjunn'' by Bahram Khan and ''Hanifa Kayrapari'' by Sabirid Khan.&lt;ref name="blogs.edgehill.ac.uk"/&gt; The ''Dobashi'' tradition features the use of Arabic and Persian vocabulary in Bengali texts to illustrate Muslim contexts.&lt;ref name="blogs.edgehill.ac.uk"/&gt; Medieval Bengali Muslim writers produced [[epic poetry]] and elegies, such as ''Rasul Vijay'' of Shah Barid, ''Nabibangsha'' of [[Syed Sultan]], ''Janganama'' of [[Abdul Hakim (poet)|Abdul Hakim]] and ''Maktul Hussain'' of Mohammad Khan. [[Cosmology]] was a popular subject among Sufi writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ahmed |first=Wakil |year=2012 |chapter=Sufi Literature |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Sufi_Literature |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, Bengali Muslim writers such as such as [[Alaol]] found refuge in [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] where he produced his epic, ''Padmavati''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Bengal was also a major center of [[Persian literature]]. Several newspapers and thousands of books, documents and manuscripts were published in Persian for 600 years. The Persian poet [[Hafez]] dedicated an ode to the literature of Bengal while corresponding with [[Sultan]] Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Billah |first=Abu Musa Mohammad Arif |year=2012 |chapter=Persian |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Persian |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Bengali Muslim novelist was [[Mir Mosharraf Hossain]] in the 19th century. The highly acclaimed poetry of Kazi Nazrul Islam espoused spiritual rebellion against fascism and oppression. Nazrul also wrote Bengali [[ghazal]]s. [[Begum Rokeya]] was a pioneering Bengali female writer who published [[Sultana's Dream]], one of the earliest examples of [[feminist science fiction]]. The Muslim Literary Society of Bengal was founded by free-thinking and progressive teachers of Dacca University under the chairmanship of Dr.{{nbsp}}[[Muhammad Shahidullah]] on 19{{nbsp}}January 1926. The [[Freedom of Intellect Movement]] was championed by the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Huq |first=Khondkar Serajul |year=2012 |chapter=Muslim Sahitya-Samaj |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Muslim_Sahitya-Samaj |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Bengal was partitioned in 1947, a distinct literary culture evolved in East Pakistan and modern Bangladesh. [[Shamsur Rahman (poet)|Shamsur Rahman]] was regarded as the country's poet laureate. [[Jasimuddin]] became noted for poems and songs reflecting life in rural Bengal. [[Humayun Ahmed]] promoted the Bangladeshi field of [[magical realism]]. [[Akhtaruzzaman Elias]] was noted for his works set in Old Dhaka. [[Tahmima Anam]] has been a noted writer of [[Bangladeshi English literature]].

===Cuisine===
{{see also|Bangladeshi cuisine}}
Dhaka the capital of [[Bengal Subah|Mughal Bengal]] and present day capital of [[Bangladesh]] has been the epidome of Persio-Bengali and Arabo-Bengali cuisines a contrast to [[Calcutta]] the former capital of the [[British India]] and capital of present-day [[West Bengal]] which was the central point of [[Anglo-Indian]] cuisine. Within [[Bengali cuisine]], Muslim dishes include the serving of meat curries, [[pilaf|pulao]] rice, various [[biryani]] preparations, and dry and dairy-based desserts alongside traditional fish and vegetables. [[Bakarkhani]] breads from [[Dhaka]] were once immensely popular in the imperial court of the Mughal Empire. Other major breads consumed today include [[naan]] and [[paratha]].  In present-day Bangladesh the Mughal-influenced foods are immensely popular such as Shuti Kabab, Kalo Bhuna, [[Korma]], Rôst, Mughlai [[Paratha|Porota]], Jali Kabab, Shami Kabab, Akhni, Tehari, [[Tondori Chicken|Tanduri Chicken]], Kofta, Phirni and [[Samosa|Shingara]].
Different types of Bengali biryani include the ''Kachi'' ([[mutton]]), ''Illish pulao'' ([[hilsa]]), ''Tehari'' (beef), and ''Murg Pulao'' (chicken). ''Mezban'' is a renowned spicy beef curry from Chittagong. [[Halwa]], [[pitha]]s, yogurt, and ''shemai'' are typical Muslim desserts in Bengali cuisine.

===Festivals===
[[File:Bangladeshi girls taking Selfie at Pohela Falgun.jpg|thumb|Bangladeshi girls taking a selfie at [[Pahela Falgun]] (Spring Festival).]][[Eid-ul-Fitr]] at the end of [[Ramadan]] is the largest religious festival of Bengali Muslims. The festival of sacrifice takes place during [[Eid-al-Adha]], with cows and goats as the main sacrificial animals. [[Muharram]] and the [[Mawlid|Prophet's Birthday]] are national holidays in Bangladesh. Other festivals like [[Shab-e-Barat]] feature prayers and exchange of desserts.

Secular festivals are based on the Bengali calendar which was redesigned by the Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]]. Celebrated by Bengalis of all faiths, they include the [[Pahela Baishakh|Bengali New Year]], Spring Festival, and Autumn Harvest Festival.

====Bishwa Ijtema====
The [[Bishwa Ijtema]], organized annually in Bangladesh, is the second-largest Islamic congregation after the [[Hajj]]. It was founded by the orthodox [[Sunni]] [[Tablighi Jamaat]] movement in 1954.

==Leadership==
[[File:Bayt al Mukarram.jpg|thumb|[[Baitul Mukarram]], the national mosque of Bangladesh and the headquarters of the nation's [[Islamic Foundation Bangladesh|Islamic Foundation]]]]
There is no single governing body for the Bengali Muslim community, nor a single authority with responsibility for religious doctrine. However, the semi-autonomous [[Islamic Foundation Bangladesh|Islamic Foundation]], a government institution, plays an important role in Islamic affairs in Bangladesh, including setting festival dates and matters related to [[zakat]]. The general Bengali Muslim clergy remains deeply orthodox and conservative. Members of the clergy include [[Mawlānā]]s, [[Imams]], [[Ulama]]s, and [[Muftis]].

The clergy of the Bengali Muslim [[Shia]] minority have been based in the old quarter of Dhaka since the 18th century.

The '''British Science Fiction Association''' was founded in 1958 by a group of British [[science fiction fandom|science fiction fans]], authors, publishers and booksellers, in order to encourage [[science fiction]] in every form. It is an open membership organisation costing £29 per year for UK residents and £20 for the unwaged. The first president of the BSFA was [[Brian Aldiss]]. [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]] is the current President and the current Vice-President is [[Pat Cadigan]]. The BSFA currently publishes three [[magazine]]s, sent to all members:

*''[[Vector (journal)|Vector]]'' – The critical journal of the BSFA, published two to three times a year.
*''Focus'' – The BSFA's writers magazine, published twice a year.
*''The BSFA Review'' - A digital only magazine, launched in late 2017. Published approximately six times a year.

''Matrix'' was the news magazine, but ceased publication.

The [[BSFA Award]]s are presented annually by the British Science Fiction Association, based on a vote of BSFA members and members of the British national SF [[Fan convention|convention]] ([[Eastercon]]). The BSFA also nominates two out of five of each year's judging panel of the [[Arthur C. Clarke Award]].

==History==
The BSFA was the fourth attempt to set up a national organisation of science fiction fans in Britain. The first, the Science Fiction Association (SFA), was set up in 1937 by fans who attended the first British science fiction convention in Leeds in May of that year and was "devoted to the stimulation of interest in science fiction and scientific progress", but it had to be disbanded on the outbreak of the [[World War II]] barely two years later. The second attempt was the British Fantasy Society (which has no connection with the present organisation of the same name, which is a 1971 offshoot of the BSFA), which was established in June 1942 by many of the people behind the SFA with the objective of giving members (who numbered nearly one hundred) better access to science fiction through its extensive library. The BFS did not long survive the war, being wound-up in November 1946. In 1948 [[Ken Slater (science fiction)|Captain Ken Slater]], who ran "Operation Fantast" - a trading operation which bought and swapped books and magazines - proposed the founding of a new national fan organisation, and thus the Science Fantasy Society was born. Unfortunately Slater was later posted to the army in Germany and the remaining committee members did not share his "flaming enthusiasm" for the organisation; in September 1951 the SFS was declared to be "a glorious flop".

By the late 1950s, British science fiction [[fandom]] was in serious decline. The annual [[Eastercon]] had become a purely social event with a rapidly diminishing attendance (150 in 1954, 115 in 1955, 80 in 1956, fewer than 50 in 1958). Spurred by this, the 1958 Eastercon held in [[Kettering]] held a discussion on the whole future of British fandom. It was agreed that both British fanzines and science fiction conventions had become inward-looking and had moved so far away from science fiction that they were not attractive to newcomers, and there were no routes in to British fandom anyway. It was decided that the only way forward was a new national organisation devoted to the serious study of science fiction but also carrying material in its publication about fandom, so that newcomers could go on to more personal involvement in fandom. After considerable debate on the name ("science fiction" being considered a stigma in dealing with the Press), the BSFA was formed and had over 100 members by its first anniversary.

The '''Buchanan Medal''' is awarded by the [[Royal Society]] &lt;!--every year--&gt; "in recognition of distinguished contribution to the medical sciences generally". The award was created in 1897 from a fund to the memory of London physician [[George Buchanan (physician)|Sir George Buchanan]] (1831–1895). It was to be awarded once every five years, but since 1990 the medal has been awarded every two years.&lt;ref name="buch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/page.asp?id=1762|title=The Buchanan Medal (1897)|publisher=Royal Society|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its creation, it has been awarded 28 times, and unlike other Royal Society medals such as the [[Royal Medal]], it has never been awarded to the same individual multiple times. As a result of the criteria for the medal, most of the winners have been doctors or other medical professionals; an exception was [[Frederick Warner (engineer)|Frederick Warner]], an engineer who won the medal in 1982 "for his important role in reducing pollution of the River Thames and of his significant contributions to risk assessment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/page.asp?id=1763|title=Buchanan recent winners (2006 - 1962)|publisher=The Royal Society|accessdate=2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One winner has also won a Nobel Prize: [[Barry Marshall]], who was awarded the Buchanan Medal in 1998 "in recognition of his work on discovering the role of Helicobacter pylori as a cause of diseases such as duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, gastric cancer and gastritis-associated dyspepsia" and won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2005| publisher =[[Nobel Foundation]]| year =2005| url =http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2005/illpres/| accessdate = 2009-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first winner was [[John Simon (doctor)|John Simon]], who won his medal in 1897 "for his distinguished services as an organizer of medical sanitary administration in this country, and as a promoter of scientific research relating to public health"; the most recent winner was [[Peter Ratcliffe]], who won the medal in 2017 "for his ground-breaking research on oxygen sensing and signalling pathways mediating cellular responses to hypoxia."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="70077">A '''citizen's arrest''' is an [[arrest]] made by a person who is not acting as a [[oath|sworn]] [[Police officer|law-enforcement official]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=va&amp;vol=1022703&amp;invol=1 |title=HUDSON v. COMMONWEALTH, Record No. 022703., September 12, 2003 - VA Supreme Court - FindLaw |publisher=FindLaw |year= 2009 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[common law]] jurisdictions, the practice dates back to medieval [[Kingdom of England|England]] and the [[English common law]], in which [[sheriff]]s encouraged ordinary [[Citizenship|citizen]]s to help apprehend [[criminal|law breakers]].

Despite the practice's name, in most countries, the arresting person is usually designated as a ''person'' with arrest powers, who need not be a ''citizen'' of the country in which they are acting. For example, in the [[United Kingdom|British]] jurisdiction of [[England and Wales]], the power comes from section 24A(2) of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/24A |title=Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 |publisher=The National Archives, UK |date=16 Aug 2011 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; called "any person arrest". This [[legislation]] states "any person" has these powers, and does not state that they need to be a [[British nationality law|British citizen]].

==Legal and political aspects==
A person who makes a citizen's arrest could risk exposing him or herself to possible [[lawsuit]]s or [[criminal charge]]s &amp;ndash; such as charges of [[false imprisonment]], [[unlawful restraint]], [[kidnapping]], or [[wrongful arrest]] &amp;ndash; if the wrong person is apprehended or a suspect's [[civil rights]] are violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REGINA -V- SELF; CACD 25 FEB 1992|url=http://swarb.co.uk/regina-v-self-cacd-25-feb-1992/|website=SWARB.CO.UK|publisher=SWARB.CO.UK|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially true when [[police force]]s are attempting to determine who an [[aggression|aggressor]] is. Private citizens don’t enjoy the same immunity from civil liability when making arrests on other private citizens as police officers.

The level of responsibility that a person performing a citizen's arrest may bear depends on the jurisdiction. For instance, in [[France]] and [[Germany]], a person stopping a criminal from committing a crime, including crimes against belongings, is not [[criminal responsibility|criminally responsible]] as long as the means employed are in proportion to the threat. Note, however, that in both countries, this results from a different legal norm, "aid to others in immediate danger", which is concerned with prevention, not [[prosecution]], of crimes.

==Laws by country==

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the power to arrest is granted by both [[Government of Australia|federal]] and [[States and Territories of Australia|state]] legislation, however the exact power granted differs depending on jurisdiction. The power to arrest for a Federal offence is granted by s.3Z of the [[Crimes Act 1914|''Crimes Act'' 1914]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legislation.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/ActCompilation1.nsf/0/612E850EF1814DE9CA257344000972EE/$file/CrimesAct1914Vol1_WD02.pdf |title=ComLaw Home |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |date=1 Oct 2012 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Act, a [[person (law)|person]] who is not a [[police constable]] may, without [[warrant (law)|warrant]], arrest another person if they believe on [[reasonable suspicion|reasonable grounds]] that:

*the other person is committing or has just committed an [[indictable offence]]; and
*proceedings by [[summons]] against the other person would not: ensure the appearance of the person before a court in respect of the offence; prevent a repetition or continuation of the offence or the commission of another offence; prevent the concealment, loss or destruction of evidence relating to the offence; prevent harassment of, or interference with, a person who may be required to give evidence in proceedings in respect of the offence; prevent the fabrication of evidence in respect of the offence; or would not preserve the safety or welfare of the person.

A person who arrests another person must, as soon as practicable after the arrest, arrange for the other person, and any property found on the other person, to be delivered into the custody of a constable.

====Victoria====
In the Australian state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], the power to arrest is granted in section 458 of the ''[[Crimes Act 1958]]'' (Vic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/ca195882/ |title=Crimes Act 1958 |publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute |date=20 Apr 2014 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that a person may, without a [[warrant (law)|warrant]], arrest a person that they find committing an offence for one or more of the following reasons:
*to ensure the appearance of the offender in court, and/or
*to preserve public order, and/or
*to prevent the continuation or repetition of the offence, or the commission of a further offence, and/or
*for the safety or welfare of the public or the offender

A person may also arrest another person if they are instructed to do so by a member of the police force, or if they believe on reasonable grounds that the offender is escaping legal custody.

Section 461 states that if an arrest is made under 458 of the Crimes Act, and is later proven to be false, then the arrest itself won't be considered unlawful if it was made on reasonable grounds. Section 462A allows any person the right to use force "not disproportionate to the objective as he believes on reasonable grounds to be necessary to prevent the commission, continuance or completion of an indictable offence or to effect or assist in effecting the lawful arrest of a person committing or suspected of committing any offence".

====New South Wales====
In the [[Australia]]n state of [[New South Wales]], the power to arrest is granted to anyone who is not a [[police officer]] by s.100 of the ''Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalaid.nsw.gov.au/publications/factsheets-and-resources/police-powers |title=Police powers - Legal Aid NSW |publisher=NSW Government |date=15 Nov 2013 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of New South Wales. Under the Act, a person may, without a [[warrant (law)|warrant]], arrest another person if:
*the person is in the act of committing an [[offence (law)|offence]] under any Act or statutory instrument, or
*the person has just committed any such offence, or
*the person has committed a serious indictable offence for which the person has not been [[trial|tried]].

Section 231 of the Act allows the use of such force as is "reasonably necessary to make the arrest or to prevent the escape of the person after arrest". A person who arrests another person under s.100 must, as soon as is reasonably practicable, take the person, and any [[personal property|property]] found on the person, before a [[magistrate]] to be dealt with according to law. The [[magistrate]] will also decide whether or not the force applied in making the arrest was reasonable under the circumstances.

According to the [[Law Society of New South Wales]], the arresting person should:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawsociety.com.au |title=Homepage - Law Society of NSW |publisher=The Law Society of New South Wales |year=2009 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*inform the person that they are under arrest and
*inform the person of the reasons for the arrest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawsociety.com.au/community/publicationsandfaqs/legalquestions/Underarrest/025900 |title=Law Society of New South Wales - Under arrest? |publisher=Law Society of New South Wales |date=(?)2009 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220170852/http://www.lawsociety.com.au/community/publicationsandfaqs/legalquestions/Underarrest/025900 |archivedate=February 20, 2014 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Queensland====
In the [[Australia]]n state of [[Queensland]], the power to arrest is granted by s.546 of Schedule 1 to the ''Criminal Code Act 1899'' of Queensland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/C/CriminCode.pdf |title=Criminal Code Act 1899 - CriminCode.pdf |publisher=Government of Queensland, Australia |date=27 Nov 2013 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Act, any person who [[in flagrante delicto|finds another committing]] an [[offence (law)|offence]] may, without [[warrant (law)|warrant]], arrest the other person. The power to arrest in Queensland also allows for arrest on suspicion of an offence:
{{quote|If the offence has been actually committed--it is lawful for any person who believes on reasonable ground that another person has committed the offence to arrest that person without warrant, whether that other person has committed the offence or not.}}

s.260 of the Act also provides a power to arrest in preventing a [[breach of the peace]]:
{{quote|It is lawful for any person who witnesses a breach of the peace to interfere to prevent the continuance or renewal of it, and to use such force as is reasonably necessary for such prevention and is reasonably proportioned to the danger to be apprehended from such continuance or renewal, and to detain any person who is committing or who is about to join in or to renew the breach of the peace for such time as may be reasonably necessary in order to give the person into the custody of a police officer.}}

====South Australia====
The Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (s271)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/clca1935262/s271.html |title=South Australia Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 Section 271 |publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute |date=1 Jan 2014 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; grants arrest powers to a person in [[South Australia]].

{{quote|s271(3): A person is liable to arrest and detention under this section if the person is in the act of committing, or has just committed an indictable offence; or theft (whether the theft is a summary or indictable offence); or an offence against the person (whether the offence is summary or indictable); or an offence involving interference with, [[vandalism|damage]] to or destruction of property (whether the offence is summary or indictable).}}

====Tasmania====
Under the Police Offences Act 1935 ([[Tasmania]]), section 55(3), any person may arrest any other person whom they find committing an offence, where they have reasonable grounds to believe that the conduct will create or may involve substantial injury to another person, serious danger of such injury, loss of property or serious injury to property. Section 55(5) states "For the purposes of this section, a person is said to be 'found offending' if he does any act, or makes any omission, or conducts or behaves himself, and thereby causes a person who finds him reasonable grounds for believing that he has, in respect of such act, omission, or conduct, committed an offence against this Act." There are further provisions in section 301 of the Criminal Code Act 1924 (Tas) that appear to allow a sliding scale of force in executing an arrest.

====Western Australia====
It was only in 2004 that the [[Western Australia]]n parliament repealed the provisions of the former section 47 of the Police Act 1892 which allowed any person to arrest without a warrant "any reputed common [[prostitute]], [[thief]], loose, idle or [[disorderly conduct|disorderly person]], who, within view of such person apprehending, shall offend against this Act, and shall forthwith deliver him to any constable or police officer of the place where he shall have been apprehended, to be taken and conveyed before a Justice, to be dealt with according to law …" A private citizen would have found it rather difficult to interpret the terms "loose" or "idle" with any degree of [[legal certainty]]. WA now locates its citizen's arrest powers in section 25 of the Criminal Investigation Act (WA) 2006.

====The Territories====
;[[Northern Territory]]: Under section 441(2) of the Criminal Code of the Northern Territory, any person can arrest another whom he or she finds committing an offence or behaving such that he or she believes on reasonable grounds that the offender has committed an offence and that an arrest is necessary for a range of specified reasons.
;[[Australian Capital Territory]]: refer to the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT), section 218, which permits a citizen's arrest.

Generally speaking, as regards the law in Australia: where it is clear on the evidence that a private citizen, or [[security guard|security officer]], in detaining a suspect, acted reasonably and the suspect unreasonably, then it is likely that the court will find in favour of the citizen or security officer and against the suspect if that suspect chooses, later, to sue the citizen for assault or false imprisonment. In other circumstances where, e.g., a property owner (or an agent) arrests a thief in a manner, and in circumstances, disproportionate to the likely harm to the victim, and in clear defiance of the rights of the suspect (for example, to be taken forthwith to a police station), then the court is very likely to find in favour of the suspect (guilty or otherwise). The courts may order [[restitution|compensation]] for such suspects in appropriate circumstances.

===Brazil===
In [[Brazil]], a Federal law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jusbrasil.com.br/legislacao/anotada/2341030/art-301-do-codigo-processo-penal-decreto-lei-3689-41 |title=Art. 301 do Código Processo Penal - Decreto Lei 3689/41 |language=pt |publisher=Jusbrasil.com.br |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows any person to arrest a suspect criminal found in flagrante delicto or fleeing from the crime scene. The person has to, at his/her own judgment, have the physical power to keep the suspect detained, has to verbally explain what he/she is doing to the arrestee and has to call the police. Both have to wait for the arrival of the police. The person who makes a citizen's arrest has to sign the police forms as a witness and explain the facts. Typically it will lead to a time burden of at least two hours. If the facts cannot be verified the person who realizes the citizen's arrest might be sued by the arrestee.

===Canada===

====Federal law====
[[Canada]]'s blanket arrest authorities for crimes or violations of federal statutes are found in the Criminal Code. In Canada, a criminal offence is any offence that is created by a [[Federal Government of Canada|federal]] statute—there are no provincial "crimes".

Criminal offences are divided into three groups: indictable, dual procedure, and summary conviction. For the purposes of arrest, dual procedure offences are considered to be indictable.

The Criminal Code provisions related to citizen arrests were changed in 2012, by the Citizen's Arrest and Self-defence Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/AnnualStatutes/2012_9/FullText.html |title=Citizen’s Arrest and Self-defence Act |publisher=Laws-lois.justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, it is now possible to make a citizen's arrest in Canada in circumstances where a "reasonable" amount of time has lapsed between the commission of a property-related offence and the arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/news-nouv/nr-cp/2013/doc_32865.html |title=Backgrounder: Citizen's Power of Arrest and Self-Defence and Defence of Property |publisher=Justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023060656/http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/news-nouv/nr-cp/2013/doc_32865.html |archivedate=2013-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''For greater certainty''
(4) For greater certainty, a person who is authorized to make an arrest under this section is a person who is authorized by law to do so for the purposes of section 25.
}}

====Provincial law====
There are several arrest authorities found through the various provincial statutes. The most notable citizen's arrest authority in Ontario is found in the Trespass to Property Act, but there are others found in the Highway Traffic Act, the Liquor Licence Act, and many others.

{{poemquote|'''TRESPASS TO PROPERTY ACT'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90t21_e.htm|title=Trespass to Property Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. T.21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
In [[Denmark]], pursuant to § 755 (2) of the Administration of Justice Act, anyone may arrest a suspect found at or in the immediate vicinity of a crime scene if the criminal act is subject to public prosecution. The arrestee must as soon as possible be turned over to the police with information about the time of and reasons for the arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=138875#Kap69 |title=Retsplejeloven - Bekendtgørelse af lov om rettens pleje (in Dansk/Danish)- English: Administration of Justice Act - Act on Administration of Justice- retsinformation.dk |publisher=retsinformation.dk |date=24 October 2012 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===
In [[Finland]], [http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2011/20110806 Coercive Measures Act 22.7.2011/806] gives a right to apprehend someone in the act of committing a crime ''([[in flagrante delicto]])'' or fleeing from the crime scene, if punishment for the crime might be imprisonment or the crime is petty assault, petty theft, petty embezzlement, petty unauthorized use, petty stealing of a motor vehicle for temporary use, petty damage to property or petty fraud. A person wanted by the police (arrest warrant) can be apprehended by anyone. After the apprehension, the detainee must be handed over to the police as soon as possible. If the criminal is resisting or tries to escape, the law gives a citizen the right to use an amount of force considered necessary, when considering the nature of the crime, the behavior of the apprehended and the situation as a whole.

===France===
[[French law]] allows any person to arrest a person having been caught ''[[in flagrante delicto]]'' committing a crime punishable by a jail or prison term, and to conduct that person before the nearest officer of judiciary police &amp;ndash; in modern practice, one would rather call the police in after performing the arrest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006575113&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071154&amp;dateTexte=20100705&amp;oldAction=rechCodeArticle Code of penal procedure (France), Article 73].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Citizen's arrests can be made under §&amp;nbsp;127&amp;nbsp;Ⅰ&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;StPO (code of penal procedures) if the arrestee is caught ''[[in flagrante delicto]]'' and either the identity of the person cannot be otherwise established immediately or he/she is suspected to try to flee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/englisch_stpo/englisch_stpo.html#p1053 §&amp;nbsp;127&amp;nbsp;StPO (code of penal procedures) (Germany)].&lt;/ref&gt; The person making the arrest is allowed to hold the arrestee solely for the purpose of turning him over to a proper legal authority such as the police. German law does not establish that the crime has to be serious, nor that the person making the arrest has to actually be a citizen of Germany.

===[[Hong Kong]]===
Citizen's arrest is known as the "101 power". Under the Criminal Procedure Ordinance (cap. 221 of the Laws of Hong Kong), section 101(2) provides that "Any person may arrest without warrant any person whom he may reasonably suspect of being guilty of an arrestable offence" using "force as is [[reasonable person|reasonable]] and proportionate in the circumstances" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201411/26/P201411260507.htm |title=Reply by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, in the Legislative Council|website=news.gov.hk}}.&lt;/ref&gt;. Once an arrest is made, the suspect must be delivered to a police office as soon as possible for court proceedings. "Arrestable offence" is defined as any crimes that can be sentenced for more than 12 months of jail time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap221/s101 Criminal Procedure Ordinance (Hong Kong), Chapter 221, Section 101].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
According to article 127, section 3 of ''Act XIX. of 1998 concerning Penal Procedure'', anyone may arrest a person caught committing a felony, but is obliged to hand the person over to the "investigative authorities" immediately; if this is not possible, the police must be informed.

===India===
Section 43, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 states that:
{{Quotation|
#Any private person may arrest or cause to be arrested any person who in his presence commits a non-bailable and cognizable offence, or any proclaimed offender, and, without unnecessary delay, shall make over or cause to be made over any person so arrested to a police officer, or, in the absence of a police officer, take such person or cause him to be taken in custody to the nearest police station.
#If there is a reason to believe that such person comes under the [provisions of Sec 41, a police officer shall re-arrest him.
#If there is a reason to believe that he has committed a non-cognizable offence, and he refuses on the demand of the police officer to give his name and residence, or gives name or residence which such officer has a reason to believe to be false, he shall be dealt with under the provisions of Sec 42, but if there is no sufficient reason to believe that he has committed any offence he shall at once be released.}}

According to this section any private person may arrest or cause to be arrested

The term "citizen's arrest" is colloquially used for arrest, without an [[arrest warrant]], made by someone other than a member of the [[Garda Síochána]].&lt;ref name="kildarestreet2005"/&gt; Despite the colloquial name, non-[[Irish nationality law|Irish citizens]] have performed such arrests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/addict-battled-with-tourist-after-bid-to-steal-ring-26035236.html|title=Addict battled with tourist after bid to steal ring - Independent.ie|date=20  September 2002 |quote=American tourist Michael Lacey ... carried out a citizen's arrest.|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[law of the Republic of Ireland]], being derived from [[English law]], inherited the [[common law]] power for private individuals to arrest for [[felony]] or   [[breach of the peace]].&lt;ref name="kildarestreet2005" /&gt; The Criminal Law Act 1997 abolished the common-law distinction between felonies and [[misdemeanour]]s and instead distinguishes "[[arrestable offence|arrestable]]" and "non-arrestable" offences; arrestable offences are those punishable by at least five years' imprisonment, and private individuals may arrest those [[In flagrante delicto|''in flagrante'']], having committed, or about to commit an arrestable offence.&lt;ref name="Owen1996"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS1996112600005#N12|title=Criminal Law Bill, 1996: Section 4|last=Owen|first=Nora |authorlink=Nora Owen|date=26 Nov 1996|work=Select Committee on Legislation and Security proceedings|publisher=Oireachtas|page=4|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kildarestreet2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kildarestreet.com/wrans/?id=2005-09-29.897.0|title=Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform: Citizen's Arrests|date=29 Sep 2005|work=Dáil Éireann: Written answers|publisher=KildareStreet.com|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cla1997"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1997/act/14/revised/en/html#SEC2 |title=Criminal Law Act 1997; §§ 2–4 |date=30 June 2016|work=Revised Acts |publisher=[[Law Reform Commission (Ireland)|Law Reform Commission]]|accessdate=11 March 2018|location=Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act 1976 schedules offences associated with [[the Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], and authorises anyone to arrest someone for committing or having committed such an offence, whether in the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="kildarestreet2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cljaa1976"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1976/act/14/section/19/enacted/en/html#sec19|title=Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, Section 19|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1976 act, and a similar [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Westminster act]] giving reciprocal [[Extraterritorial jurisdiction in Irish law|extraterritorial jurisdiction]], obviated the need for [[extradition]] between the jurisdictions, which would have been more controversial.&lt;ref name="Cunningham2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=Michael|title=British Government Policy in Northern Ireland, 1969–2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iGfM_efV5LIC&amp;pg=PA26|accessdate=11 March 2018|date=2001-08-10|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719057670|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}
{{wikisourcelang|he|חוק סדר הדין הפלילי (סמכויות אכיפה – מעצרים)}}
An [[Israel]]i law allowing anyone to arrest a suspect whom they witnessed carrying out a felony was repealed in 1996 and a new law now allows the detention of a suspect by another person under certain conditions. Section 75 of the Criminal Procedure Law (Enforcement Powers – Arrest) of 1996 allows anyone to detain a person who is witnessed carrying out certain suspected crimes. The crimes include the following: a felony, theft, a crime of violence and a crime which has caused serious damage to property. A person using these detention powers may use reasonable force if their request is not met as long as they do not cause the suspect bruising. They must hand the suspect over to the police immediately and no later than three hours. Persons whose identity is known or who are not suspected of fleeing may not be detained. The law, which is relatively new, is used by both private individuals and private security but is problematic because it has not yet been interpreted by the courts. In early 2009, a magistrate's court in Jerusalem handed down a verdict convicting two private security officers of assault following a detention of a suspect who assaulted one of them. The court ruled that the guards were not allowed to detain the suspect who was seated in a taxi at the time and should have waited for the police to arrive.

===Japan===
In [[Japan]], Section 213 of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows anyone (not only citizens) witnessing any crime in progress to make an arrest. This is called ''genkouhan'' (現行犯, meaning ''[[in flagrante delicto]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[wikibooks:ja:刑事訴訟法第213条]]&lt;/ref&gt; Most criminals who attempt to flee, or refuse to identify themselves, can be held until police arrive.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikibooks:ja:刑事訴訟法第217条]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, making a citizen's arrest to prevent [[petty crime]] (e.g. illegal assembly, accidental injury, accidental trespass, defamation of character, leaving a parking lot without paying)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tanteisha.net/taiho.html |title=現行犯逮捕 |publisher=Tanteisha.net |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is [[false imprisonment]] per Section 220 of the Criminal Code.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikibooks:ja:刑事訴訟法第220条]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latvia===
[http://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=107820#p-457809 Criminal Procedure Law] in [[Latvia]] gives a right to any person to apprehend someone in the act of committing a crime ''([[in flagrante delicto]])'' or fleeing from the crime scene, if punishment for the crime might be imprisonment. Also a person wanted by the police, for whom there is an arrest warrant, can be arrested by anyone at any time. A person stopping a criminal from committing a crime is not criminally responsible [http://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=88966&amp;version_date=01.01.2007#p-9227 as long as the means employed are in proportion to the threat]. The arrested person must be handed over to the police immediately.

===Malaysia===
Section 27(1) of the ''Criminal Procedure Code'' allows for a private person to arrest a person who, in his view, has committed a seizable offence or a non-bailable offence:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agc.gov.my/agc/oth/Akta/Vol.%2012/Act%20593.pdf Criminal Procedure Code (Act 593) &amp;sect; 27(2)]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Any private person may arrest any person who, in his view, commits a non-bailable and seizable offence or who has been proclaimed under section 44 and shall without unnecessary delay hand over the person so arrested to the nearest police officer or, in the absence of a police officer, take that person to the nearest police station.}}

Sub-section 5 further allows the arrest of a person who commits an offence on or with respect to the property of another by any person who is using the property to which the injury is done, or by the servant of either of those persons or by any person authorized by or acting in aid of either of those persons:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agc.gov.my/agc/oth/Akta/Vol.%2012/Act%20593.pdf Criminal Procedure Code (Act 593) &amp;sect; 27(5)]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Any person who commits an offence on or with respect to the property of another may if his name and address are unknown be apprehended by the person injured or by any person who is using the property to which the injury is done, or by the servant of either of those persons or by any person authorized by or acting in aid of either of those persons, and may be detained until he gives his name and address and satisfies such person that the name and address so given are correct or until he can be delivered into the custody of a police officer.}}

A "seizable offence" is defined as an offence in which a police officer may ordinarily arrest without warrant as per defined by the Code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agc.gov.my/agc/oth/Akta/Vol.%2012/Act%20593.pdf Criminal Procedure Code (Act 593) &amp;sect; 2(1)]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
Article 16 of the 1917 [[Constitution of Mexico]] allows any person to arrest a criminal found ''[[in flagrante delicto]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilstu.edu/class/hist263/docs/1917const.html Constitution of Mexico, Article 16] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303014932/http://www.ilstu.edu/class/hist263/docs/1917const.html |date=March 3, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; A non-police officer doing so must immediately call the police, because it is illegal to retain or transport any person against their will; failing to do so is illegal deprivation of liberty, a crime similar to kidnapping that can result in a prison sentence for the perpetrator. In 2006, the celebrity bounty hunter [[Duane Chapman|Duane 'Dog' Chapman]] was charged with unlawful deprivation of liberty for arresting an American fugitive in Mexico and attempting to take him across the border to California without consulting police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/09/19/duane-dog-chapman-says-feds-sold-him-out-to-mexico-in-exchange-for-drug-lord/ |title=Duane 'Dog' Chapman Says Feds Sold Him Out to Mexico in Exchange for Drug Lord |publisher=Fox News |date=2006-09-19 |accessdate=2014-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]], some legal protection exists to those making a citizen's arrest as provided in the [[Crimes Act 1961]] in that there may be justification or protection from criminal responsibility. Justification of the arrest ensures the arresting person is not guilty of an offence and is not liable to any [[civil procedure|civil proceeding]]. Protection from criminal responsibility means those who make the arrest are not liable to any criminal proceedings. They are however liable for [[civil procedure|civil proceedings]]. The legislation is carefully worded and only applies to offences covered in the Crimes Act 1961, not other offences such as those covered in the [[Summary Offences Act 1981]].&lt;ref name="ns.org.nz"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ns.org.nz/index.html/Factsheets/CitizensArrestAndSelf-defence?action=pdf |title=Citizen's Arrest and Self-defence |accessdate=2010-10-08 | publisher = Neighbourhood Support New Zealand |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, the [[Crimes Act 1961]] states that everyone (not just New Zealand citizens) is justified in arresting without warrant:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM328250.html?search=ts_act_crimes+act#DLM328250 Crimes Act 1961, Section 35 &amp; 36].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Any person found committing any offence against this Act which the maximum punishment is not less than 3 years' imprisonment; or
* Any person found at night (9pm till 6am) committing any offence against this Act.

Other situations where members of the public are protected from criminal responsibility when involved in arresting where:
* They have been asked by a police officer to help arrest any person believed or suspected to have committed any offence unless they know that there is no reasonable ground for the belief or suspicion.&lt;ref name="ns.org.nz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM328250.html?search=ts_act_crimes+act#DLM328250 Crimes Act 1961, Section 34].&lt;/ref&gt;
* They witness a breach of the peace, and therefore are justified in interfering to prevent its continuance or renewal, and may detain any person committing it, in order to hand them over to a police officer provided that the person interfering does not use more force than is reasonably necessary to prevent the continuance or renewal of the breach of the peace, or than is reasonably proportionate to the danger to be apprehended from its continuance or renewal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM328261.html?search=ts_act_crimes+act#DLM328261 Crimes Act 1961, Section 42].&lt;/ref&gt; Similar legislation applies to suppressions of riots by members of the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM328262.html?search=ts_act_crimes+act#DLM328262 Crimes Act 1961, Section 43].&lt;/ref&gt;
* They believe, on reasonable and probable grounds, someone has committed an offence against the Crimes Act 1961 and is fleeing and is being pursued by any one they believe can arrest that person for the offence (such as a police officer). This applies whether or not the offence has in fact been committed, and whether or not the arrested person committed it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM328253.html?search=ts_act_crimes+act#DLM328253 Crimes Act 1961, Section 38].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The person making the arrest is entitled to perform a search on the suspect, provided he/she is not working for the place of arrest (e.g. a security guard in a hospital).

In all cases a person making a citizens arrest must hand over the suspect to a police officer at the earliest possible time.

===Norway===
In [[Norway]], pursuant to § 176 of the Criminal Procedure Act any person may arrest a suspect caught at the scene or pursued from it. The arrestee must be handed over to the police immediately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lovdata.no/all/tl-19810522-025-021.html#176].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
Although the [[Philippines]] does not have a national law covering citizen's arrest, the local government of [[Quezon City]] passed ''Ordinance 2307'' or the "Citizen's Arrest Ordinance of Quezon City". Any citizens within the Quezon City area can arrest a person even without a warrant in the instances mentioned and provided by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJkEuaEQtW4|title=QC ordinance allows 'citizen's arrest'|first=|last=ABS-CBN News|date=1 November 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
In [[Sweden]], any person may arrest someone in the act of committing a crime, or fleeing from the crime scene, if the crime committed is punishable by imprisonment. A person wanted by the police, for whom there is an arrest warrant, can be arrested by anyone at any time. After the arrest, the police must be contacted as soon as possible.

===Taiwan===
An arrest without a warrant is explicitly forbidden by the Article 8 in the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]], "except in case of flagrante delicto as provided by law", as shown below:

{{poemquote|
'''The Code of Criminal Procedure'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawSearchNo.aspx?PC=C0010001&amp;DF=&amp;SNo=88].&lt;/ref&gt;
''Article 88: Arrest without a Warrant''
{{unbulleted list
|A person in flagrante delicto may be arrested without a warrant by any person.
|A person in flagrante delicto is a person who is discovered in the act of committing an offense or immediately thereafter.
|A person is considered to be in flagrante delicto under one of the following circumstances:
{{unbulleted list
|'''(1)''' One is pursued with cries that he is an offender;
|'''(2)''' One is found in possession of a weapon, stolen property, or other items sufficient to warrant a suspicion that he is an offender or his body, clothes and the like show traces of the commission of an offense sufficient to warrant such suspicion.
}}
}}
}}

However, the first additional circumstance, i.e. "pursued with cries" has been considered ambiguous in recent years, leading to many ongoing discussions and controversies of whether this would cause an infringement of the personal freedom.

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====
A citizen's arrest is permitted to be made on any person under section 24A of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]] for an [[indictable offence]], including [[either way]] offences (in this section referred to simply as "an offence"), but excluding certain specific ones listed below; the Ministry of Justice publishes a list of indictable offences on its website.&lt;ref&gt;Indictable offences, summary offences, and TEW offences - court codes https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/217713/offence-classifications.xls&lt;/ref&gt;. A few examples of [[indictable]] and [[either-way]] offences are [[theft]], [[criminal damage]], [[burglary]], [[assault]] occasioning [[actual bodily harm]], possession of an [[offensive weapon]] in a public place, etc.
It is thus permissible for any person to arrest another without warrant&lt;ref&gt;https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/24A&lt;/ref&gt;:

*anyone who is in the act of committing an offence, or whom the arrestor has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be in the act of committing an offence, or
*where an offence has been committed, anyone who is guilty of that offence or whom the arrestor has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be guilty of it

In order for the citizen's arrest to be lawful, the following two conditions must also be satisfied:

*it appears to the person making the arrest that it is not reasonably practicable for a Constable to make the arrest instead;
*the arrestor has reasonable grounds for believing that the arrest is ''necessary'' to prevent one or more of the following:
**the person causing physical injury to himself or others;
**the person suffering physical injury;
**the person causing loss of or damage to property;
**the person absconding before a constable can assume responsibility for him

Use of the second power above ("where an offence has been committed") is more limited than the first as it relies upon the person carrying out the arrest ''knowing'' that an (indictable) offence ''has been'' committed. It is a common misconception that a member of the public needs to witness the offence before being able to act. Section 24 of this act therefore gives a Constable two key additional powers:

*Anyone who is (without doubt) about to commit an offence, or whom the Constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be about to commit an offence;
*Anyone whom the Constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be guilty of an offence which is merely ''suspected'' to have taken place

A Constable's arrest power is not limited to indictable offences, and a necessity test different from the above applies.

However, a citizen's arrest cannot be made:

A person cannot normally make a citizen's arrest before an offence takes place (excluding any indictable offence covered by the Criminal Attempts Act 1981), but they may prevent the commission of further offences at the time e.g. a person arrested to cease ''further'' criminal damage. However, Section 3 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]] allows any person to use [[reasonable force]] for the prevention of crime. This would not allow a citizen's arrest before an offence takes place in this sense but would allow any person to use reasonable force to prevent an offence from occurring; for example, restraining a suspected offender who raised a brick in their hand in order to imminently smash a window.

"Any person" powers can be used to arrest ''before'' an offence occurs as long as the offence in question falls within the [[Criminal Attempts Act 1981]]. This act creates the offence of an ''attempted'' offence, as long as the offence being attempted is an [[indictable]] one. For this to apply, the offence must actually be in the process of being attempted &amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32; preparatory steps are not sufficient. For example, putting gloves on to smash a car window would not suffice, but the throwing of a brick at the window would. The definition of what constitutes a "crime" was clarified in R v Jones (Margaret)[2005] QB 259&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldjudgmt/jd060329/jones-3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
which stated under the S3 CLA1967 meaning, it was held to be any domestic crime in England/Wales. Kent Police have released a brief yet comprehensive [http://library.college.police.uk/docs/APPref/use-of-force-briefing.pdf guide] on reasonable force&lt;ref&gt;http://library.college.police.uk/docs/APPref/use-of-force-briefing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that a citizen's arrest is a form of [[lawful custody]] and anyone attempting to flee may be guilty of attempting to [[escape from lawful custody]]. Furthermore, the offence of 'assault with intent to resist arrest or lawful apprehension or detainer of himself' may apply if the arrestee assaulted the arrestor under Section 38 of the [[Offences Against the Person Act 1861]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/38&lt;/ref&gt;. Both assault with intent to resist arrest/lawful apprehension and escaping from lawful custody are indictable, the former being so by the mode of trial of the offence, the latter is a [[common law]] offence and therefore [[indictable]] only. Therefore, these offences - whether fully carried out or merely attempted - are citizen's arrestable in themselves.

(See also - [[Criminal Attempts Act 1981]])

In addition to the above, a private person may be authorised to execute an [[arrest warrant]], if the [[court]] issuing the warrant has given them the authority to do so.

A citizen's arrest may also be made technically for a warrant for an arrest if the offence listed is indictable as there is no law prohibiting a re-citizen's arrest or the number of times they may be arrested for it nor is there a time limit. The warrant would satisfy the requirement for the arrester to have reasonable grounds to suspect the guilt of the arrestee. For example, if an offender failed to attend [[Crown court]] this would satisfy two conditions for a lawful citizen's arrest at a later date - that the offence ''had'' taken place and that it was obviously indictable by way of being tried in Crown court.

=====Other Powers=====

Although not technically citizen's arrest powers, any person also has the power to arrest for a [[common law]] [[breach of the peace]] which also provides any person with a [[power of entry]]. Section 3 [[Criminal Justice Act 1967]] provides any person the power to apprehend a person [[unlawfully at large]] e.g. an offender on a recall to prison or in the circumstances where someone has managed to [[escape from lawful custody]].

See also - [[Breach_of_the_peace#England,_Wales_and_Northern_Ireland|Breach of the peace (main article)]]

Any person may arrest an individual/individuals to prevent an occurring, repeated, or an about to occur [[breach of the peace]]. The breach of the peace power of arrest is provided by the [[common law]] and therefore an 'any person' power of arrest and entry both within the same definition &lt;ref&gt;https://www.scie.org.uk/care-act-2014/safeguarding-adults/adult-suspected-at-risk-of-neglect-abuse/law/pcea1984.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-2230.1973.tb01388.x&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldjudgmt/jd131206/lapor-2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldjudgmt/jd131206/lapor-2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4086524/citizens-arrest-rules-laws-making-one-uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

This offence definition and power of arrest are contained under the [[common law]] definition of "breach of the peace". Section 17(5) of [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984|PACE 1984]] abolished all powers of a Constable to enter under the common law with the specific exception (subsection 6) when dealing with or preventing a common law breach of the peace.

Breach of the peace powers are unusual in the fact they originate from the laws [[Alfred the Great]] consolidated into the [[common law]] approximately 1,000 years before the modern Constable was thought up. The first legislative reference to the common law breach of the peace was under the [[Justice of the Peace Act 1361]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Edw3/34/1&lt;/ref&gt;. As a result, when a Constable uses their breach of the peace powers, they are acting 'any person' and not fully as a sworn officer in this capacity.

Until 2006, there was an "any person" power of arrest under part of the [[Theft Act 1968]] in England and Wales that related to [[poaching]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/schedule/1|title=Paragraph 2(4) of Schedule 1 to the Theft Act 1968|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was used by private [[water bailiff]]s (as opposed to [[Environment Agency]] bailiffs). This ceased to have effect as a result of a general repeal of such arrest powers by the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/15/schedule/7/paragraph/38 Paragraph 38] of Schedule 7 to the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005; commenced by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/3495/article/2/made#article-2-1-m article 2(m)] of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (Commencement No. 4 and Transitory Provision) Order 2005&lt;/ref&gt; An officer or agent of certain companies may seize and detain any person who has committed an offence against the provisions of the [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/legResults.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Companies+Clauses+Consolidation+Act+1845&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;activeTextDocId=1035033 Companies Clauses Consolidation Act 1845] whose name and residence shall be but unknown to such officer or agent, and take them before a [[justice of the peace]], who "shall proceed with all convenient dispatch to the hearing and determining of the complaint against such offender".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Companies+Clauses+Consolidation+Act+1845&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=1035033&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1035211&amp;filesize=772 |title=Companies Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 (c.16) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Parliamentary procedure|Standing Orders]] of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], the [[Serjeant at Arms of the British House of Commons|Serjeant at Arms]] has the power to take into custody any member of the public who is in a Members-only area of the House, or who misconducts themselves, or who fails to leave when the House sits in private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmstords/539/539.pdf|title=Standing Order 161 of the House of Commons|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Court Security Officers in [[England and Wales]] have the additional power to restrain and remove persons from court buildings under s53 [[Courts Act 2003]] as well as powers of search and seizure of certain articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/39/section/53|title=Courts Act 2003|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northern Ireland====
Similar provisions apply to Northern Ireland as to England and Wales, implemented through the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (SI 1989/1341)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1989/uksi_19891341_en_1 |title=The Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=2012-04-25 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; as amended by the Police and Criminal Evidence (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order (SI 2007/288).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/uksi_20070288_en_1 |title=The Police and Criminal Evidence (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 2007 No. 288 (NI. 2) |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=2007-02-07 |accessdate=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
While no statutory provision for citizen's arrest exists in [[Scots law]], there is a [[common law]] position that anyone committing an offence can be arrested using minimum force if necessary with consideration to what is reasonable in the relevant circumstances. The offence must be a serious one and not merely for a breach of the peace. The person exercising the power must have witnessed the offence occurring therefore they cannot act upon information from another person. An arrest is applicable reliant on situation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200001/cmselect/cmarmed/154/1013004.htm House of Commons - Armed Forces - Minutes of Evidence&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1995/oct/18/citizens-arrest Citizen's Arrest (Hansard, 18 October 1995)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the [[United States]] a private person may [[arrest]] another without a [[arrest warrant|warrant]], for a crime occurring in their presence. For which crimes this is permitted may vary state by state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/magazine/how-to-make-a-citizens-arrest.html|title=How to Make a Citizen’s Arrest|last=Wollan|first=Malia|date=May 6, 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 26, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Common law====
Most states have codified the common law rule that a warrantless arrest may be made by a private person for a felony, misdemeanor or "breach of peace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Daily, JD|first=James|title=Superheroes and Citizen's Arrest|url=http://lawandthemultiverse.com/2011/03/07/superheroes-and-citizens-arrest/|work=Law and the Multiverse}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Breach of peace" covers a multitude of violations in which the Supreme Court has even included a misdemeanor seatbelt violation punishable only by a
fine. The term historically included theft, "nightwalking", prostitution and playing card and dice games.&lt;ref name="Supreme Court of the United States"&gt;{{cite web|title=Atwater v. Lago Vista (No. 99-1408)|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/99-1408|publisher=Supreme Court of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====State statutes====
California Penal Code section 837 is a good example of this codification:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
837. A private person may arrest another:
# For a public offense committed or attempted in his/her presence.
# When the person arrested has committed a felony, although not in his presence.
# When a felony has been in fact committed, and he or she has reasonable cause for believing the person arrested to have committed it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Public offense" is read similarly as breach of peace in this case and includes felonies, misdemeanors and infractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Penal Code Section 16|url=http://law.onecle.com/california/penal/16.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People v. Landis|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-superior-court/1050756.html|publisher=Appellate Division, Superior Court,Orange County.|quote="Public offenses" include infractions.  (Pen.Code § 16; People v. Tennessee (1970) 4 Cal.App.3d 788, 791, 84 Cal.Rptr. 697.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that there is generally no provision for an investigative detention by a private person under the law. With certain exceptions (see below) an arrest must be made. "Holding them until the police get there", is simply a form of arrest. The officer is accepting the arrest and processing the prisoner on behalf of the private person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citizens' Arrest |url=http://le.alcoda.org/publications/point_of_view/files/Citizen.pdf |publisher=Alameda County District Attorney's Office }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of felonies, a private person may make an arrest for a felony occurring outside their presence but the rule is that a felony must have, in fact, been committed. For example, imagine a suspect has been seen on surveillance video vandalizing a building to the extent that the arrestor believes it rises to a felony due to the damage. If they find the suspect and make the arrest but it later turns out that it was misdemeanor damage, the arrestor is liable for [[false arrest]] because a felony had not, in fact, been committed.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Because most states have codified their arrest laws, there are many variations. For example, in Pennsylvania, the
courts have been clear that a citizen cannot make an arrest for a "summary offense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Legg |first=Jason |title=From the Desk of the DA |url=http://www.susquehannacounty-da.org/PDF/pdf2008/16may08.pdf |work=Susquehanna County Office of the District Attorney |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903083247/http://www.susquehannacounty-da.org/PDF/pdf2008/16may08.pdf |archivedate=2014-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In North Carolina, there is no de jure "citizens' arrest". Although it is essentially the same, North Carolina law refers to it as a "detention".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detention of offenders by private persons. |url=http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_15A/GS_15A-404.html |work=North Carolina General Statutes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115092943/http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_15A/GS_15A-404.html |archivedate=2012-11-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other states seem to allow only arrests in cases of felonies but court decisions have ruled more broadly. For example in Virginia, the statute appears to only permit warrantless arrests by officers listed in the Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=§19.2-81 Arrest Without a Warrant|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/virginia/2006/toc1902000/19.2-81.html|work=Code of Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Virginia courts have upheld warrantless arrests by citizens for misdemeanors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Thomas WILSON v. COMMONWEALTH of Virginia|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/va-court-of-appeals/1175015.html|publisher=Court of Appeals of Virginia, Richmond.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use of force====
In general, a private person is justified in using non-deadly force upon another if they reasonably believe that: (1) such other person is committing a felony, or a misdemeanor amounting to a breach of the peace; and (2) the force used is necessary to prevent further commission of the offense and to apprehend the offender. The force must be reasonable under the circumstances to restrain the individual arrested. This includes the nature of the offense and the amount of force required to overcome resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Use of Force for Law Enforcement Purposes|url=http://www.lexisnexis.cfom/lawschool/study/outlines/html/crim/crim11.htm|work=Criminal Law Capsule Summary|publisher=LexisNexis}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flynn|first=Michael W.|title=Citizen's Arrest |url=http://legallad.quickanddirtytips.com/citizens-arrest-2.aspx|work=Legal Lad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shopkeeper's (merchant's) privilege ====
In some states of the United States, the courts recognize a common law [[shopkeeper's privilege]], under which a shopkeeper is allowed to detain a suspected [[shoplifting|shoplifter]] on store property for a reasonable period of time, so long as the shopkeeper has cause to believe that the person detained in fact committed, or attempted to commit, theft of store property. The purpose of this detention is to recover the property and make an arrest if the merchant desires.&lt;ref&gt;W. Page, Keeton et al., ''Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts'' § 22, at 142 (5th ed. 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Differing liability from police ====
Private persons are occasionally granted immunity from civil or criminal liability, like the police are, when arresting others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/ByArticle/Chapter_15A/Article_20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; While the powers to arrest are similar, police are entitled to mistake of fact in most cases, while citizens can be held to a stricter liability depending on the individual state. Police can also detain anyone upon reasonable suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terry v. Ohio (392 U.S. 1 (1968)) |url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/392/1/case.html |publisher=Supreme Court of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ordinary citizens cannot claim "qualified immunity" to attempt to defend against a civil complaint for false arrest.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/qualified_immunity&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Colony Club''' is a women-only [[gentlemen's club|private social club]] in [[New York City]]. Founded in 1903 by [[Florence Jaffray Harriman]], wife of [[J. Borden Harriman]], as the first social club established in New York City by and for women, it was modeled on similar clubs for men.

[[File:Colony Club LC-DIG-ggbain-09440 crop.jpg|thumb|left|267px|Coach leaving from the Colony Club in 1911, carrying Mrs. [[Thomas Hastings (architect)|Thomas Hastings]], Mrs. Iselin and Mrs. Loew]]

=== Original clubhouse ===
With other wealthy women, including [[Anne Tracy Morgan]] (a daughter of [[J.P. Morgan]]), Harriman raised $500,000, and commissioned [[Stanford White]] of [[McKim, Mead &amp; White]] to build the original clubhouse, later known as the "Old Colony Club". This building – at 120 Madison Avenue, between East 30th and East 31st Streets on the west side of Madison – was built between 1904 and 1908 and was modelled on eighteenth-century houses in [[Annapolis, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="Landmarks"&gt;{{cite nycland}}, p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

The interiors, which exist largely unchanged and have been accorded the landmark status, were created by [[Elsie de Wolfe]] &amp;ndash; later to become Lady Mendl &amp;ndash; a former actress who had recently opened an interior-design business, and whose companion, the theatrical agent [[Elisabeth Marbury]], was one of the club's founders.  Stanford White was [[Stanford White#Death|slain]] by [[Harry K. Thaw]] months before construction of the Colony Club was completed.  The building was designed in the Federal Revival style, and has unusual brickwork done in a diaper pattern&lt;ref name="Landmarks"/&gt; as a notable feature of its facade.

The club and the street in front of it were often the site of large [[Women's suffrage|suffrage]] rallies sponsored by the [[Equal Franchise Society]] to which many members of the Club belonged.&lt;ref name=Dubois&gt;{{cite book|last1=DuBois|first1=Ellen Carol|title=Harriot Stanton Blatch and the Winning of Woman Suffrage|date=1999|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300080689|page=111}}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 November 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old Colony Club was sold to [[Genevieve Garvan Brady]] after the club moved to its new location in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[https://laetare.nd.edu/recipients/people/genevieve-garvan-brady/ "The Laetare Medal: Genevieve Garvan Brady"] [[University of Notre Dame]]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the building houses the East Coast headquarters of the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]].&lt;ref name="Citycyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AIA"&gt;{{cite AIA4}}, pp.215 and 386&lt;/ref&gt; It was awarded [[List of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan from 59th to 110th Streets|landmark status]] by the City of New York in 1966.&lt;ref name="Landmarks"/&gt;

===Second clubhouse===
{{stack|[[File:I Second Colony Club House, NYC, NY, USA.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Second Colony Club House, NYC]]}}

The second clubhouse, located at 564 Park Avenue, also known as 51 East 62nd Street, on the northwest corner, was commissioned in 1913&lt;ref name=nycland&gt;{{cite nycland}}, p.155&lt;/ref&gt; and constructed from 1914 to 1916. It was designed by [[Delano &amp; Aldrich]] in the [[Georgian architecture|Neo-Georgian style]], with interiors designed by [[Elsie de Wolfe]]&lt;ref name=post /&gt; The building has a marble base with red-brick and marble trim and columns for the upper floors.&lt;ref name="Citycyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AIA"/&gt; According to [[Andrew Dolkart]]:

{{blockquote|This is not one of Delano &amp; Aldrich's more elegant works in the Colonial idiom, perhaps because it was nearly impossible to create a well-proportioned design for a building with the complex spatial requirements of this club. The beautifully appointed interior included the lounges, dining rooms, and bedrooms common to social clubs, but also had a two-story ballroom, a basement swimming pool and spa that connected via an express elevator to a gymnasium on the fifth floor, two squash courts, servants' rooms (in 1925 there were thirteen female servants), and even a kennel where members could leave their pets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Dolkart|Dolkart, Andrew S.]]. ''Touring the Upper East Side: Walks in Five Historic Districts''. 1995, [[New York Landmarks Conservancy]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1973, Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]]'s birthday party was held at the Colony Club (among the guests were four couples whom Kissinger had ordered to [[wiretap]]ped{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}). In 2007, memorial services for [[Brooke Astor]] were held there. The club continues its policy of women-only membership – new members must be recommended by current members&lt;ref&gt;Jedrzejczak, Antonina. [http://www.businessinsider.com/members-only-clubs-2010-4#the-colony-club-8 "New York City's Top Members-Only Clubs For Elite Power Players: Colony Club"] ''Business Insider'' (April 23, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; — although it was unsuccessfully contested in court in 1987 by conservative [[radio talk-show]] host [[Bob Grant (radio host)|Bob Grant]] and Sidney Siller, who founded the National Organization for Men.&lt;ref name=post /&gt;

The Club presently has approximately 2,500 members who have access to discussions, concerts, and wellness and athletic programs. The Clubhouse consists of seven stories, 25 guest bedrooms, three dining rooms, two ballrooms, a lounge, a squash court, an indoor pool, a fitness facility and three personal spa service rooms. Annual gross revenues are more than $10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colony Club – New York, New York (Executive Chef)|url=http://denehyctp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Colony-EC-Listing.pdf|website=denehyctp.com|publisher=DENEHY Club Thinking Partners|accessdate=13 October 2014|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crime in [[St. Louis]]''' includes an overview of [[crime]] both in the city of [[St. Louis]] and in the [[Greater St. Louis]] metropolitan area. Crime in the city increased from the 1960s through the early 1990s as measured by the [[index crime]] rate, followed by a decline in crime rates through 2014. Despite decreasing crime, rates of violent crime and property crime in both the city and the metropolitan area remain higher than the national metropolitan area average.&lt;ref name="ucrcommunitytype2011"&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/table-2 FBI 2011 UCR data for Crime in the United States by Community Type]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the city of St. Louis consistently has been ranked among the most dangerous cities in the United States. As of April 2017, St. Louis has the highest murder rate in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Millennials really like St Louis|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21720664-addition-countrys-highest-murder-rate-city-boasts-vibrant-start-up|accessdate=14 April 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2017, St. Louis metropolitan had 205 murders with only 159 within the city limit.&lt;ref name=murders2017&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/focused-police-presence-in-north-st-louis-better-relationships-with/article_7ba12d3a-ed23-5ecb-b92f-db8c8cc8bb39.html |title=Focused police presence in north St. Louis, better relationships with protesters among new chief's goals |work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Chief of Police, [[John Hayden Jr.|John Hayden]] said two-thirds (67%) of all the murders and one-half of all the assaults are concentrated in a triangular area in the North part of the city.&lt;ref name="murders2017"/&gt;

==Historical crime trends==

Prior to the 1930s, only sporadic information is available regarding crime in the city and region. As early as 1894, there were 80 homicides in the city, according to the ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch''.&lt;ref name="stlpd01011895"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/579190669?accountid=141687 | work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch | title= Year's Crime: During 1894 There Were 80 Homicides in St. Louis | date= January 1, 1895}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the period 1901 to 1910, the city recorded 804 homicides, with a homicide rate for the period of 12 per 100,000 residents.&lt;ref name="nyt1911"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/10/03/100378018.pdf | work= New York Times | title=Homicide Record for 1911 Appalling | date=October 3, 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, the city police reported 74 homicides, while 103 people were recorded as having died of homicide by the medical examiner.&lt;ref name="fosdick"&gt;{{cite news |work=The Spectator |title=The Homicide Record of American Cities for 1915 |author=F.L. Hoffman |date=December 21, 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, there were 138 homicides in St. Louis according to the St. Louis city coroner, giving a rate of about 14 per 100,000 residents.&lt;ref name="stlpd04131922"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/578872202?accountid=141687 | work=The St. Louis Post-Dispatch | title=Judge Mistaken as to St. Louis Murders | date=April 13, 1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stlpd06091922"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/578418479?accountid=141687 | work=The St. Louis Post-Dispatch | title=Libeling St. Louis | date=June 9, 1922}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1934, St. Louis reported crime statistics to the FBI, which compiled and published reports of [[index crime]] and homicides in the annual [[Uniform Crime Reports]].

Starting in the 1950s, the city of St. Louis saw increases in its index crime and homicide rates, which both peaked in the early 1990s. However, St. Louis saw its peak number of index crimes and homicides in 1969 and 1970, respectively. Although some of the reduction in the number of index crimes since the early 1990s can be attributed to St. Louis's loss of population, other factors include low inflation, the decline of open-air drug markets, and a decline in crack cocaine use.&lt;ref name="boganjan202011"&gt;{{cite news | first=Jesse| last= Bogan| title=Police say St. Louis crime numbers lowest since 1967|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/article_54415090-65c0-5d30-92ac-e89951bd98ba.html | location = St. Louis|agency= | newspaper=''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' | date=January 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, 67 police departments in St. Louis County&lt;ref name="muninote"&gt;The police departments that reported data included those of Arnold, Ballwin, Bella Villa, Bellefontaine Neighbors, Bellerive, Bel-Nor, Bel-Ridge, Berkeley, Beverly Hills, Breckenridge Hills, Brentwood, Bridgeton, Calverton Park, Charlack, Chesterfield, Clayton, Cool Valley, Country Club Hills, Crestwood, Creve Coeur, Dellwood, Des Peres, Edmundson, Ellisville, Eureka, Ferguson, Flordell Hills, Florissant, Frontenac (includes Huntleigh and Westwood), Glendale, Glen Echo Park, Greendale, Hazelwood, Hillsdale, Jennings, Kirkwood, Ladue, Manchester, Maplewood, Maryland Heights, (includes Champ), Moline Acres, Northwoods, Norwood, Oakland, Olivette, Overland (includes Sycamore  Hills), Pacific, Pagedale, Pasadena Park, Pine Lawn, Richmond Heights, Riverview, Rock Hill, Shrewsbury (includes Mackenzie), St. Ann, St. John, Sunset Hills, Town and Country, University City, Uplands Park, Velda City, Velda Village Hills, Vinita Park, Warson Woods, Webster Groves, Woodson Terrace, and St. Louis County Police (includes unincorporated St. Louis County, Blackjack, Clarkson Valley, Fenton, Grantwood Village, Green Park, Hanley Hills, Kinloch, Marlborough, Norwood Court, Pasadena Hills, St. George, Twin Oaks, Valley Park, Vinita Terrace, Wilbur Park, Wildwood, and Winchester).&lt;/ref&gt; reported 33,718 index crimes, and three departments did not report crime to the FBI (these include the departments of Wellston, Normandy, and Lakeshire).

In 2010, the [[St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department]] (the city police department) reported 33,782 index crimes, which was the lowest total reported index crimes since 1967 (however, index crimes in 1967 did not include larceny under $50, arson, or non-negligent manslaughter).&lt;ref name="boganjan202011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indexcrimedefin"&gt;Index crimes for 2010 included homicide/non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny, vehicle theft, and arson.&lt;/ref&gt; The index crime rate fell 9.2 percent from 2009, with a 15.6 percent decline in violent crime and a 7.6 percent decline in property crime.&lt;ref name="boganjan202011"/&gt; However, [[Chief of Police]] [[Daniel Isom]] noted in the report that both homicides and burglaries remain problems in the city.&lt;ref name="boganjan202011"/&gt;

==Policing==
[[Law enforcement]] in the metropolitan area is provided by a variety of municipal and county police departments and by federal agencies. In the city of St. Louis, the [[St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department]] provides police service,&lt;ref name="citypolice"&gt;[http://www.slmpd.org/mission_values_statements.html St. Louis City Police Department] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116045406/http://slmpd.org/mission_values_statements.html |date=2013-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the city sheriff's department provides courtroom protection services, serves eviction notices, and transports prisoners between courts and jails within the city.&lt;ref name="citysheriff"&gt;[http://stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/sheriff/index.cfm St. Louis City Sheriff's Office]&lt;/ref&gt; In St. Louis County, 67 police departments, including the [[St. Louis County Police Department]], provide police services, while the county also maintains a sheriff's office for courtroom services and civil actions.&lt;ref name="countysheriff"&gt;[http://www.stlouisco.com/YourGovernment/CountyDepartments/SheriffsOffice St. Louis County Sheriff's Office]&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby counties such as [[St. Charles County, Missouri|St. Charles County]] have both municipal police departments and a county-wide sheriff that provide police services. The [[Missouri State Highway Patrol]] maintains a troop servicing the region with its headquarters in St. Charles County. An FBI field office is located in the city of St. Louis, while the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives]] maintains a group supervisor office in the city under the direction of the Kansas City Field Division.

In 1994, [[Morgan Quitno]] (a private research and publishing company purchased by [[CQ Press]] in 2007) began publishing reports that named St. Louis City among the "most dangerous" cities in the United States. Although the methodology for the reports changed during the 1990s, St. Louis retained its ranking in the top ten most dangerous cities, and it was named the most dangerous city in the United States three times, most recently in 2010.

For the two years that it was ranked by CQ Press (in 2008 and 2009), the City of St. Louis alone ranked considerably more dangerous than the St. Louis metropolitan statistical area.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

St. Louis's ranking has not been without controversy; [[University of Missouri–St. Louis]] professors and [[criminologists]] [[Richard Rosenfeld]] and [[Janet Lauritsen]] criticized the rankings for their lack of transparency and their over-reliance on Uniform Crime Reports as data sources.&lt;ref name="rosenlaurit"&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Contexts |year=2008 |volume=7 |issue=1|pages=66–67|title=The Most Dangerous Crime Rankings |author= Richard Rosenfeld; Rachel Lauritsen|url=http://contexts.org/articles/winter-2008/the-most-dangerous-crime-rankings/ |accessdate=2011-07-03 |doi=10.1525/ctx.2008.7.1.66}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the rankings are not meaningful indicators of risk of victimization, as certain factors such as age, lifestyle, and neighborhood play a significant role in crime risk.&lt;ref name="rosenlaurit"/&gt;

Upon St. Louis's ranking as most dangerous city in 2010, the administration of [[Washington University in St. Louis]] criticized the rankings as flawed, and representatives for St. Louis [[Mayor of St. Louis|Mayor]] [[Francis G. Slay]] noted that crime in the city decreased each year since 2007 and criticized the report for not including regional crime information.&lt;ref name="studlifedec0110"&gt;{{cite news | first=Michelle| last=Merlin| title=St. Louis ranked again as most dangerous city|url=http://www.studlife.com/news/2010/12/01/st-louis-ranked-again-as-most-dangerous-city/ | location = St. Louis|agency= | newspaper=Student Life (Washington University) | date=1 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, St Louis was ranked as the 19th most dangerous city in the world by the Mexican aid organisation CCSP-JP (El Consejo Ciudadano para la Seguridad Publica y la Justicia Penal).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svt.se/svts/article2626028.svt/binary/2015_01_20_seguridad_justicia_y_paz-50_cidades_violentas_2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eliza Armstrong case''' was a major [[scandal]] in the [[United Kingdom]] involving a child supposedly bought for [[prostitution]] for the purpose of exposing the evils of [[White Slavery (prostitution)|white slavery]]. While it achieved its purpose of helping to enable the passage of the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]], it also brought [[unintended consequences]] to its chief perpetrator, [[William Thomas Stead]].

==Background==
{{main|Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885}}

Since the middle of the 19th century, efforts by the Social Purity movement, led by early feminists such as [[Josephine Butler]] and others, sought to improve the treatment of women and children in [[Victorian era|Victorian society]]. The movement scored a triumph when the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]] were repealed under pressure due to their [[double standard]] nature and ultimate ineffectiveness.

At the same time, the campaign had also turned towards the problem of prostitution, and with male power over women. By the end of the 1870s, this had become particularly focused on fears that [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] women were being lured—or abducted—to [[brothels]] in the Continent, especially since this was happening to girls barely past the [[age of consent]]. Although the age was raised to 13 when amendments to the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] were made in 1875, the movement sought to further raise this to at least 16, but [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] was reluctant to make this change.

However, a Criminal Law Amendment Bill to change this was introduced in 1881. While it passed the [[House of Lords]] easily in 1883 after a two-year [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]] study, it stalled twice in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Then in 1885, it was reintroduced for a third time, but again it was threatened to be set aside ultimately because of a political crisis and [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|the upcoming general election that year]].

==W. T. Stead==
[[File:William Thomas Stead.jpg|thumb|W.T. Stead in later years]]
Parliament recessed for the [[Whit Week]] bank holiday on 22 May, and the next day [[Benjamin Scott]], anti-vice campaigner and the [[Chamberlain of London|chamberlain of the City of London]], went to see [[William Thomas Stead|W. T. Stead]], editor of the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]''. Stead was a pioneer of modern [[investigative journalism]], with a flair for the sensational. He was a supporter of the Social Purity movement.

Scott told stories of sexually exploited children to Stead, who agreed to work for popular support. Stead set up a "Special and Secret Committee of Inquiry" to investigate [[child prostitution]], which included Josephine Butler, as well as representatives of the London Committee for the Suppression of the Traffic in British Girls for the Purposes of Continental Prostitution (of which Scott was the chairman) and [[the Salvation Army]]. As part of the investigation, two women, an employee of the ''Pall Mall Gazette'' and a girl from the Salvation Army, posed as prostitutes and infiltrated brothels, leaving before they were forced to render sexual services. Butler spent ten days walking the streets of London with her son Georgie, posing as a brothel-keeper and a procurer, respectively; together they spent a total of £100 buying children in high-class brothels. Stead, in turn, also spoke to a former director of criminal investigation at [[Scotland Yard]] to get first-hand information; he later cast his net wide to include active and retired brothel keepers, [[pimps]], procurers, prostitutes, rescue workers and jail chaplains.

Stead felt that he needed something more to make his point: he decided to purchase a girl to show that he could do it under the nose of the law.

==A £5 virgin==
[[File:bramwell-booth-1881.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bramwell Booth]] c.1881]]
With the help of Josephine Butler and [[Bramwell Booth]] of the Salvation Army, Stead got in touch with Rebecca Jarrett, a reformed prostitute and brothel-keeper who was staying with Mrs Butler in [[Winchester]] as an assistant. Although Mrs Butler had no problem with Rebecca's meeting Stead, she did not know Stead's reason for doing so.

Stead prevailed upon Jarrett to help him to show that a 13-year-old girl could be bought from her parents and transported to the Continent. Despite her reluctance about returning to her old brothel contacts for help, Jarrett agreed to help.

Rebecca Jarrett met an old associate, a [[procuress]] called Nancy Broughton. Through her Jarrett learned of a 13-year-old named Eliza Armstrong, whose [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] mother Elizabeth was in need of money. She arranged for Jarrett to meet Mrs Armstrong, who lived in the [[Lisson Grove]] area of West London, and although Rebecca told the mother the girl was to serve as a maid to an old gentleman, she believed Mrs Armstrong understood that she was selling her daughter into prostitution. The mother agreed to sell her daughter for a total of £5 — equivalent to approximately £574 in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/education/Pages/resources/inflationtools/calculator/index1.aspx According to the Bank of England inflation calculator.] Accessed 25 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 June, the bargain was made.

On the same day, Jarrett then took Eliza to a midwife and abortionist named Louise Mourez, who examined her and attested to her virginity and sold Jarrett a bottle of [[chloroform]]. Then Eliza was taken to a brothel and lightly drugged to await the arrival of her purchaser, who was Stead. Stead, anxious to play the part of [[libertine]] almost in full, drank a whole bottle of [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]], although he was a [[teetotaler]]. He entered Eliza's room and waited for her to awaken from her stupor. When she came to, Eliza screamed. Stead quickly left the room, letting the scream imply he had "had his way" with her. Eliza was quickly handed over to [[Bramwell Booth]], who spirited her to [[France]], where she was taken care of by a [[Salvationist]] family.

In the meantime, Stead wrote his story.

==''The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon''==

{{main|The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon}}
{{Wikisource|The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon}}

On Saturday 4 July 1885, a "frank warning" was issued in the ''Pall Mall Gazette'': "All those who are squeamish, and all those who are prudish, and all those who would prefer to live in a fool's paradise of imaginary innocence and purity, selfishly oblivious to the horrible realities which torment those whose lives are passed in the London inferno, will do well not to read the ''Pall Mall Gazette'' of Monday and the three following days".&lt;ref&gt;W.T. Stead, [http://www.attackingthedevil.co.uk/pmg/tribute/notice.php Notice to our Readers: A Frank Warning], ''The Pall Mall Gazette'', 4 July 1885.&lt;/ref&gt; The public's appetite whetted sufficiently in anticipation, on Monday 6 July, Stead published the first installments of ''[[The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon]]''.

The first installment taking up six whole pages, Stead attacked vice with eye-catching subheadings: "The Violation of Virgins", "The Confessions of a Brothel-Keeper", "How Girls Were Bought and Ruined". He argued that while [[consensual sex|consensual adult behavior]] was a matter of private morality and not a law enforcement issue, issues rife in London existed that did require legislative prohibition, listing five main areas where the law should intervene:&lt;ref name="stead6july"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.attackingthedevil.co.uk/pmg/tribute/mt1.php|title=W.T. Stead - "The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon - I" - Full Text - The Pall Mall Gazette, July 6, 1885|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# "The sale and purchase and violation of children.
# The procuration of virgins.
# The entrapping and ruin of women.
# The international slave trade in girls.
# Atrocities, brutalities, and unnatural crimes."

The theme of "Maiden Tribute" was child prostitution, the abduction, procurement and sale of young English virgins to Continental "pleasure palaces". Stead took his readers to the labyrinthine streets of London (intentionally recalling the Greek myth) to its darker side, exposing the flesh trade while exposing the corruption of those officials who not only turned a blind eye but also condoned such abuse. Stead acknowledged that his articles described the situation of a small minority of London's prostitutes, agreeing that most "have not come there by the road of organized rape", and that his focus was child victims who were "regularly procured; bought..., or enticed under various promises into the fatal chamber from which they are never allowed to emerge until they have lost what woman ought to value more than life".&lt;ref name="stead6july" /&gt; In particular, he drew a distinction between sexual ''immorality'' and sexual ''criminality'', and criticized those members of Parliament who were responsible for the Bill's impending "extinction in the House of Commons" and hinted that they might have personal reasons to block any changes in the law.

The disclosure began properly in the 6 July publication, in which Stead reveals that he had asked if genuine [[maiden]] [[virgin]]s could be procured, and being told it was so, asked whether such girls were willing and consensual, or aware of the intentions planned for them:&lt;ref name="stead6july" /&gt;

{{quote|"But," I continued, "are these maids willing or unwilling parties to the transaction–that is, are they really maiden, not merely in being each a virgo intacta in the physical sense, but as being chaste girls who are not consenting parties to their seduction?" He looked surprised at my question, and then replied emphatically: "Of course they are rarely willing, and as a rule they do not know what they are coming for." "But," I said in amazement, "then do you mean to tell me that in very truth actual rapes, in the legal sense of the word, are constantly being perpetrated in London on unwilling virgins, purveyed and procured to rich men at so much a head by keepers of brothels?" "Certainly," said he, "there is not a doubt of it." "Why, "I exclaimed, "the very thought is enough to raise hell." "It is true," he said; "and although it ought to raise hell, it does not even raise the neighbours." "But do the girls cry out?" "Of course they do. But what avails screaming in a quiet bedroom? Remember, the utmost limit of howling or excessively violent screaming, such as a man or woman would make if actual murder was being attempted, is only two minutes, and the limit of screaming of any kind is only five... But suppose the screams continue and you get uneasy, you begin to think whether you should not do something? Before you have made up your mind and got dressed the screams cease, and you think you were a fool for your pains... Once a girl gets into such a house she is almost helpless, and may be ravished with comparative safety."&lt;ref name="stead6july" /&gt;}}

Stead commented that "Children of twelve and thirteen cannot offer any serious resistance. They only dimly comprehend what it all means. Their mothers sometimes consent to their seduction for the sake of the price paid by their seducer. The child goes to the introducing house as a sheep to the shambles. Once there, she is compelled to go through with it. No matter how brutal the man may be, she cannot escape". A [[madam]] confirmed the story for him, stating of one girl that she was rendered unconscious beforehand, and then [[coercion|coercively]] given the choice to continue or be [[homeless]] afterwards:&lt;ref name="stead6july" /&gt;

The last section of the first installment bore special mention: under the subheading "A Child of Thirteen bought for £5" Stead related the story of Eliza, a purchased victim, whose name he changed to "Lily". Although he vouched "for the absolute accuracy of every fact in the narrative", Stead changed a number of details, and omitted the fact that "Lily's" purchaser was none other than himself. Describing himself as an "investigator" rather than an "informer", and having also promised not to use information obtained against those who provided it,  he stated that he would disclose actual names and identifying details only to the two UK [[Archbishop]]s, one [[Member of parliament|M.P.]], two members of the [[House of Lords]] active in criminal legislation or child protection, and a past director of the [[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]].&lt;ref name="stead6july" /&gt;

===Reactions to the "Maiden Tribute"===
The "Maiden Tribute" was an instant hit. While [[W H Smith|W.H. Smith &amp; Sons]], who had a monopoly on all the news stalls, refused to sell the paper due to its lurid and prurient content, volunteers consisting of newsboys and members of the Salvation Army took over distribution. Even [[George Bernard Shaw]] telegraphed Stead offering to help. Crowds gathered in front of the ''Pall Mall Gazette'' offices. Second-hand copies of the paper sold for up to a [[shilling]] — twelve times its normal price.

Within days, Stead had been getting telegrams from across the Atlantic inquiring about the scandal. By the end of the series he had thrown Victorian society into an uproar about prostitution. Fearing riots on a national scale, the [[Home Secretary]], [[Sir William Harcourt]] pleaded with Stead to cease publication of the articles; Stead replied that he would comply if the Bill would be passed without delay. Since Harcourt could not make that guarantee, Stead ordered the ''Pall Mall Gazette'' presses to continue until paper ran out.

Stead's revelations struck a responsive chord in the public. Amidst the hysteria, it provoked a wide variety of reform groups and prominent individuals to call for an end to the scandal. Dozens of protest meetings were held throughout London and the provincial towns. Thousands, including wagon loads of virgins dressed in white, marched to Hyde Park demanding that the Bill be passed. The government was soon on the defensive and those members of Parliament who had previously opposed the Bill, now understood that opposition would not only mean denying the existence of child prostitution, but condoning it as well. While many of them wanted to have the paper prosecuted under obscenity laws, they bowed to the inevitable. On Wednesday 8 July debate resumed over the bill, on 7 August it passed its third and final reading, and passed into law a week later.

==Unintended consequences==
[[File:wt-stead-uniform.jpg|thumb|150px|W.T Stead photographed in his prison uniform]]

Although Stead was supported in his investigation by the Salvation Army and religious leaders including Cardinal [[Henry Edward Manning]] and Charles John Ellicott, the [[Bishop of Bristol]], his plan backfired on him. Rival newspapers, including ''[[The Times]]'', investigated the original "Lily" and found that Stead was the "purchaser". Mrs Armstrong told police that she had not consented to put her daughter into prostitution, saying she understood that she would enter domestic service. Jarrett did not get the permission of the child's father.

Stead, Jarrett, Booth and Louise Mourez, the midwife, and two others appeared in court on 2 September charged with the assault and abduction for Eliza Armstrong without the agreement of her parents.

On 23 October, the defendants were brought to trial, with the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]], [[Richard Everard Webster, 1st Viscount Alverstone|Richard Webster]], acting as [[prosecutor]]. Stead defended himself. He admitted that the girl was procured without the consent of the father and that he had no written evidence of payment to the mother. Stead had relied on Rebecca Jarrett's word, and was unable to prove Mrs Armstrong's complicity in the crime. Stead, Jarrett and Mourez were found guilty of abduction and procurement. The others were acquitted. Jarrett and Mourez were sentenced to six months in jail and Stead was sentenced to three months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attackingthedevil.co.uk/pmg/tribute/armstrong/bailey/sentence.php Mr. Justice Henry Charles Lopes' Sentence, The Old Bailey (10 November 1885)]. Quoted in Alison Plowden (1974), ''The Case of Eliza Armstrong: A Child of 13 Bought for £5''.&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent to [[Coldbath Fields Prison]] for three days and then to [[Holloway (HM Prison)|Holloway]] as a first-class inmate for the rest of his sentence.

==Aftermath==
Many groups protested against Stead's imprisonment, and he was treated well in prison. "Never had I a pleasanter holiday, a more charming season of repose", he later said. In Holloway as a "first class misdemeanant" he had his own room with an open fire and a fellow prisoner as a servant to tend to him. His wife and children were allowed in for Christmas. Mourez died in jail. Jarrett survived her six months with hard labour.  While in prison, he continued to edit the ''Pall Mall Gazette'', and his [[Christmas card]] played up his martyrdom. Stead wrote a threepenny pamphlet of his prison experience soon after his release.&lt;ref&gt;W.T. Stead (1886). ''[http://www.attackingthedevil.co.uk/steadworks/imprisonment.php My First Imprisonment]''. London: E. Marlborough &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; He asked the prison governor whether he could keep his prison uniform, although he spent much of his sentence in ordinary civilian street clothes. The governor agreed, and thereafter, every 10 November, the anniversary of his conviction, Stead would dress up in his prison garb to remind people of his "triumph".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.attackingthedevil.co.uk/gallery/images/stead10.jpg |title= Stead portrait |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040412040535/http://www.attackingthedevil.co.uk/gallery/images/stead10.jpg |archive-date=12 April 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the trial the prosecutor, surnamed Poland, started a public subscription for the Armstrong family through an advertisement in ''The Times''. The money paid for Eliza to attend a training centre for girls to become servants. She lost connection with the Salvation Army after her return from France, and details of her later life are unknown.

Stead died in the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'' disaster.

'''Environmental management system''' ('''EMS''') refers to the management  of an organization's [[Natural environment|environment]]al programs in a comprehensive, systematic, planned and documented manner. It includes the organizational structure, planning and resources for developing, implementing and maintaining policy for [[environmental protection]].

More formally, EMS is "a system and database which integrates procedures and processes for training of personnel, monitoring, summarizing, and reporting of specialized environmental performance information to internal and external stakeholders of a firm".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sroufe, Robert. "Effects of Environmental Management Systems on Environmental Management Practices and Operations." Production and Operations Management. 12-3 (2003): 416-431.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely used standard on which an EMS is based is [[ISO 14001|International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 2004]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Melnyk, Steven A., Robert P. Sroufe, and Roger Calantone. "Assessing the Impact of Environmental Management Systems on Corporate and Environmental Performance."&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatives include the [[Eco-Management and Audit Scheme|EMAS]].

An environmental management information system (EMIS)  or Environmental Data Management System (EDMS) is an [[information technology]] solution for tracking [[environmental data]] for a company as part of their overall environmental management system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=El-Gayar|first1=Omar |last2=Fritz|first2=Brian D.|year=2006 |title=Environmental Management Information Systems (EMIS) for Sustainable Development: A Conceptual Overview |journal=[[Communications of the Association for Information Systems]] |volume=17 |issue=1 (article 34) |publisher=[[Association for Information Systems]] |url=http://aisel.aisnet.org/cais/vol17/iss1/34 |issn=1529-3181 |oclc=796028508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
The goals of EMS are to increase compliance and reduce waste:&lt;ref&gt;Sayre, D., 1996. Inside ISO 14001: the competitive advantage of environmental management. St. Lucie Press, Delray,Beach, FL.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Regulatory compliance|Compliance]] is the act of reaching and maintaining minimal legal standards. By not being compliant, companies may face fines, government intervention or may not be able to operate.
*[[Waste reduction]] goes beyond compliance to reduce environmental impact. The EMS helps to develop, implement, manage, coordinate and monitor environmental policies. Waste reduction begins at the design phase through pollution prevention and waste minimization. At the end of the life cycle, waste is reduced by recycling.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

To meet these goals, the selection of environmental management systems is typically subject to a certain set of criteria: a proven capability to handle high frequency data, high performance indicators, transparent handling and processing of data, powerful calculation engine, customised factor handling, multiple integration capabilities, automation of workflows and QA processes and in-depth, flexible reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.emisoft.com/8-things-to-look-for-when-selecting-software-for-managing-high-frequency-environmental-data/|title=Selecting Environmental Data Management Software: Key Considerations|date=2016-10-07|work=Emisoft|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
An environmental management system (EMS):&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

* Serves as a tool, or process, to improve environmental performance and information mainly "design, pollution control and waste minimization, training, reporting to top management, and the setting of goals"
* Provides a systematic way of managing an organization’s environmental affairs
* Is the aspect of the organization’s overall management structure that addresses immediate and long-term impacts of its products, services and processes on the environment. EMS assists with planning, controlling and monitoring policies in an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emisoft.com/environmental-compliance-corporate-performance-can-you-have-it-all/|title=Environmental Regulatory Compliance &amp; Corporate performance - Can You Have It All?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.emisoft.com|publisher=Emisoft|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gives order and consistency for organizations to address environmental concerns through the allocation of resources, assignment of responsibility and ongoing evaluation of practices, procedures and processes
* Creates environmental buy-in from management and employees and assigns accountability and responsibility.
* Sets framework for training to achieve objectives and desired performance.
* Helps understand legislative requirements to better determine a product or service's impact, significance, priorities and objectives.
* Focuses on continual improvement of the system and a way to implement policies and objectives to meet a desired result. This also helps with reviewing and auditing the EMS to find future opportunities.
* Encourages contractors and suppliers to establish their own EMS.
* Facilitates e-reporting to federal, state and provincial government environmental agencies through direct upload.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://info.era-environmental.com/news/bid/70641/era-environmental-introduces-direct-upload-to-tceq-s-steers|title=ERA Environmental Introduces Direct Upload to TCEQ’s STEERS|last=Mali|first=Ria|access-date=2017-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EMS Model==
[[File:PDCA Cycle.svg|thumb|300px|right|The PDCA cycle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.bulsuk.com/2009/02/taking-first-step-with-pdca.html |title=Taking the First Step with PDCA |date=2 February 2009 |accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
An EMS follows a [[Plan-Do-Check-Act]], or PDCA, Cycle. The diagram shows the process of first developing an environmental policy, planning the EMS, and then implementing it. The process also includes checking the system and acting on it. The model is continuous because an EMS is a process of continual improvement in which an organization is constantly reviewing and revising the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/181467595|title=Kontinuierliche Verbesserung im Umweltmanagement : die KVP-Forderung der ISO 14001 in Theorie und Unternehmenspraxis|last=René|first=Gastl,|date=2005|publisher=Vdf, Hochsch.-Verl. an der ETH|isbn=9783728130341|location=Zürich|oclc=181467595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a model that can be used by a wide range of organizations — from manufacturing facilities to service industries to government agencies.

==Accreditation==
Environmental Data Management Systems (EDMS) can be accredited under the UK Environment Agency's [[Monitoring Certification Scheme]] (MCERTS) for performance standards and test procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mcerts-performance-standards-and-test-procedures-for-environmental-data-management-software|title=MCERTS: performance standards and test procedures for environmental data management software|website=GOV.UK|language=en|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other meanings==

An EMS can also be classified as 
*a system which monitors, tracks and reports emissions information, particularly with respect to the [[oil industry|oil]] and [[gas industry]]. EMSs are becoming [[web-based]] in response to the [[EPA]]'s mandated [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) reporting rule, which allows for reporting GHG emissions information via the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hansmiddendorp.nl/category/stedelijke-ontwikkeling/|title=Stedelijke ontwikkeling Archives - Hans Middendorp Advies|website=Hans Middendorp Advies|language=nl-NL|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*a centrally controlled and often automated network of devices (now frequently wireless using [[z-wave]] and [[zigbee]] technologies) used to control the internal environment of a building. Such a system namely acts as an interface between end user and [[energy consumption|energy (gas/electricity) consumption]].&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.echome.co.uk/renewable-energy-services/heating-and-lighting-controls/|title=echome.co.uk - This website is for sale! - echome Resources and Information.|website=www.echome.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-23|deadurl=usurped}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

[[File:Augustins - Le Massage. Scène de hammam - Edouard Debat-Ponsan 1883.jpg|thumb|right|280 px|''Le massage'' by [[Edouard Debat-Ponsan]], 1883]]
'''Erotic massage''' or '''sensuous massage''' is the use of [[massage]] techniques by a person on another person's [[erogenous zones]] to achieve or enhance their sexual excitation or [[sexual arousal|arousal]] and to achieve [[orgasm]]. Massages have been used for medical purposes for a very long time, and their use for erotic purposes also has a long history. In the case of women, the two focal areas are the [[breast]]s and [[Mons pubis|pubis]], while in case of men, the focal area is the [[human male genitalia|male genital]]s. When the massage is of a partner's [[human genitalia|genitals]], the act is usually referred to as [[mutual masturbation]]. 

Today, erotic massage is used by some people on occasion as a part of sex, either as [[foreplay]] or as the final [[Human sexual activity|sex act]], or as part of [[sex therapy]]. There is also a large commercial erotic massage industry in some countries and cities.

==Commercial erotic and sexual massage==
&lt;!--[[Happy ending (disambiguation)]] links to this section --&gt;
An erotic and sexual massage may be provided by independent providers, providers of broader sexual services, or through organized [[massage parlor]]s or [[brothel]]s. It takes many forms, from massage techniques that aim to integrate the sexual, spiritual and physical, to massage whose purpose is the achievement of an [[orgasm]] through a [[handjob]], [[oral sex]], or [[sexual intercourse]]. 

A 'happy ending' is a [[colloquial term]] for the practice of a provider offering sexual release to a client. This is sometimes offered as an addition to any other type of massage, typically in the form of a handjob. The 2009 documentary ''[[Happy Endings?]]'' follows women who worked in Asian [[massage parlor]]s in [[Rhode Island]]. The film focuses on "full service" massage parlors, although "rub and tug" massage parlors (where only [[handjob]]s are offered) are also covered. [[Prostitution in Rhode Island]] was legal at the time of filming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Arditi, Lynn|title=Film Chronicles RI's Asian Brothels|url=http://www.projo.com/art/content/HAPPY_ENDINGS_FILM_05-24-09_Q9EFHNF_v25.1ecfa95.html|work=Providence Journal| date=2009-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legality===
In many jurisdictions, an erotic and sexual massage is regarded as a sexual service, the legality of which varies between jurisdictions. In some jurisdictions, an erotic massage may be legal, while prostitution is not.

==Sex therapy==
Erotic massage may be used in sex therapy as a means of stimulating the [[libido]] or increasing the ability of a person to respond positively to sensual stimulus. In some cases, erotic massage can be a form of [[foreplay]] without [[sexual gratification]], intended to heighten the sensitivity of an individual prior to another engagement where sexual arousal and fulfillment is intended. In other cases, erotic massage may be used professionally to help men address issues of [[premature ejaculation]]. Methods employed may teach the recipient to relax the musculature of his [[Human pelvis|pelvis]] and thus prolong arousal and increase pleasure.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

==Use in medicine==
[[File:Pelvicdouche.jpg|thumb|left|French pelvic [[douche]], circa 1860]]
[[File:Sears vibrators.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A 1918 [[Sears|Sears, Roebuck and Co.]] ad with several models of vibrators]]

In the Western medical tradition, genital massage of a woman to orgasm by a physician or [[midwife]] was a standard treatment for [[female hysteria]], an ailment considered common and chronic in women. In 1653, [[Petrus Forestus|Pieter van Foreest]]&lt;ref&gt;In a medical compendium titled ''Observationem et Curationem Medicinalium ac Chirurgicarum Opera Omnia''&lt;/ref&gt; advised the technique of genital massage for a disease called "womb disease" to bring the woman into "hysterical [[paroxysm]]".

Such cases were quite profitable for physicians, since the patients were at no risk of death but needed constant treatment. However, the vaginal massage procedure (generally referred to as 'pelvic massage') was tedious and time-consuming for physicians. The technique was difficult for a physician to master and could take hours to achieve "hysterical paroxysm". Referral to midwives, which had been common practice, meant a loss of business for the physician, and, at times, husbands were asked to assist.&lt;ref name=Maines&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Rachel Maines|Maines, Rachel P.]]| title=The Technology of Orgasm: "Hysteria", the Vibrator, and Women's Sexual Satisfaction| publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|year=1998|isbn =978-0-8018-6646-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of the vibrator===
{{main|Vibrator (sex toy)}}
A solution was the invention of massage devices, which shortened the needed treatment from hours to minutes, removing the need for midwives and increasing a physician's treatment capacity. Already at the turn of the century, [[hydrotherapy]] devices were available at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and by the mid-19th century, they were popular at many high-profile bathing resorts across Europe and in America.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} By 1870, a clockwork-driven [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]] was available for physicians.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} In 1873, the first electromechanical vibrator was used at an [[History of psychiatric institutions|asylum]] in [[France]] for the treatment of hysteria.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

While physicians of the period acknowledged that the disorder stemmed from sexual dissatisfaction, they seemed unaware of or unwilling to admit the sexual purposes of the devices used to treat it.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} In fact, the introduction of the [[speculum (medical)|speculum]] was far more controversial than that of the vibrator.

By the turn of the 20th century, the spread of home electricity brought the vibrator to the consumer market. The appeal of cheaper treatment in the privacy of one's own home understandably made the vibrator a popular early home appliance. In fact, the electric home vibrator was on the market before many other home appliance "essentials": nine years before the electric [[vacuum cleaner]] and 10 years before the electric [[Clothes iron|iron]]. A page from a [[Sears|Sears catalog]] of home electrical appliances from 1918 includes a portable vibrator with attachments, billed as "very useful and satisfactory for home service".&lt;ref name=Maines/&gt;

'''Face Oculta''' (Hidden Face) is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] nationwide [[political corruption]], [[money-laundering]] and corporate [[tax evasion]] scandal, first noticed in October 2009. The ''[[Polícia Judiciária]]''&lt;ref&gt;Portuguese criminal investigation police&lt;/ref&gt; investigated the business group headed by Manuel Godinho, suspected of economic crimes and bribery of managers of public funds. All Godinho’s companies, many of which were linked to business waste and waste management, are based in the [[Aveiro District]]. Godinho was arrested on October 28, 2009, in [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]], in relation to economic crimes involving an oxygen-treatment and environmental cleaning group. By early November, 14 people had been indicted. Several companies' employees were investigated, among them those of [[Petrogal]] and [[Portucel Soporcel]]. Also investigated were [[Portuguese National Republican Guard|GNR]] officers, town hall civil servants (most notoriously from the [[Gouveia Municipality, Portugal|Gouveia Municipality]]), businesspersons (most prominently Manuel Godinho and his right-hand man, Namércio Cunha, a formal suspect and alleged liaison between Godinho and REN, the company led by José Penedos),&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://diario.iol.pt/economia/face-oculta-namercio-cunha-ren-manuel-godinho-investigacao/1101986-4058.html Diario.iol.pt]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.rr.pt/informacao_detalhe.aspx?fid=92&amp;did=78566 RR.pt]&lt;/ref&gt; and former politicians - noted examples include [[Armando Vara]] ([[Millennium bcp]]) and [[José Penedos]] ([[Rede Eléctrica Nacional|REN]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [https://diariodigital.sapo.pt/dinheiro_digital/news.asp?section_id=6&amp;id_news=126278&amp;page=0 Face Oculta: Manuel Godinho montou uma rede], [[Diário Digital]], November 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://tv1.rtp.pt/noticias/?t=Grupo-Portucel-Soporcel-realiza-inquerito-interno.rtp&amp;article=291534&amp;visual=3&amp;layout=10&amp;tm=8 Face Oculta], [[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal|RTP]], October 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Former politician Armando Vara is reported by the police investigation to have had suspicious phone calls with the then Portuguese Prime Minister [[José Sócrates]].

In [[chemistry]], '''folding''' is the process by which a molecule assumes its shape or [[Conformational isomerism|conformation]].  The process can also be described as '''intramolecular self-assembly''', a type of [[molecular self-assembly]], where the molecule is directed to form a specific shape through [[noncovalent interactions]], such as [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen bonding]], metal coordination, [[hydrophobic effect|hydrophobic forces]], [[van der Waals force]]s, [[pi-pi interaction]]s, and/or electrostatic effects. 

The most active area of interest in the folding of molecules is the process of [[protein folding]], which is the shape that is assumed by a specific sequence of [[amino acids]] in a protein. The shape of the folded protein can be used to understand its function and design drugs to influence the processes that it is involved in. 

There is also a great deal of interest in the construction of artificial folding molecules or [[foldamers]].  They are studied as models of biological molecules and potential application to the development of new functional materials.

'''Gelao''' ([[Endonym|autonym]]: '''Kláo''', Chinese: '''仡佬''' Gēlǎo, Vietnamese: '''Cờ Lao''') is a dialect cluster of [[Kra languages]] in the [[Kra–Dai languages|Kra–Dai language family]]. It is spoken by the [[Gelao people]] in [[southern China]] and [[northern Vietnam]]. Despite an ethnic population of 580,000 (2000 census), only a few thousand still speak Gelao. Estimates run from 3,000 in China by [[Li Jinfang|Li]] in 1999, of which 500 are monolinguals, to 7,900 by [[Jerold A. Edmondson|Edmondson]] in 2008. Edmondson (2002) estimates that the three Gelao varieties of Vietnam have only about 350 speakers altogether.

In 2009, a book allegedly written in a native Gelao script was found in [[Guizhou]], China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cultural-china.com/20090203171833.html |title="Heaven Book" Reveals the Mystery of Gelao Minority's History - Culture China |publisher=News.cultural-china.com |date=2009-02-03 |accessdate=2013-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203031818/http://news.cultural-china.com/20090203171833.html |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but scholarship reveals it is certainly fake.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Mair, [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=8723 Fake Gelao manuscript], [[Language Log]], 29 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam D. Smith, [http://cangjie.info/blog/?p=361 Fake Gelao 仡佬 writing system and manuscript], LingQiBaSui 零七八碎, 29 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==External relationships==
Like [[Buyang language|Buyang]], another [[Kra languages|Kra language]], Gelao contains many words which are likely to be [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] cognates.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} (''See [[Austro-Tai]]''.)

As noted by Li and Zhou,&lt;ref name="tansuo"&gt;李锦芳/Li, Jinfang and 周国炎/Guoyan Zhou. 仡央语言探索/Geyang yu yan tan suo. Beijing, China: 中央民族大学出版社/Zhong yang min zu da xue chu ban she, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Gelao shares much vocabulary with the [[Hlai languages|Hlai]] and [[Ong Be language|Ong Be]] languages, suggesting contact with Pre-Hlai speakers before their migration to [[Hainan]].

==Demographics==

===China===
Zhang Jimin estimated a total of over 10,000 Gelao speakers in the early 1990s, while Li Jinfang places this number at 3,000 in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=gio]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918063525/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=gio |date=September 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerold A. Edmondson's 2008 estimate is 7,900 speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Diller, Anthony, Jerry Edmondson, Yongxian Luo. (2008). ''The Tai–Kadai Languages''. London [etc.]: Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-7007-1457-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This number is rapidly declining, as the Gelao are intermarrying with the neighboring [[Han people|Han]], [[Bouyei people|Bouyei]], and [[Miao people|Miao]]. Many Gelao speakers can also speak Bouyei, Zhuang, or Miao, and nearly all can speak local varieties of [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. Among Gelao-speaking families, most middle-age Gelao have very limited speaking abilities for Gelao, while much of the younger generation cannot even understand the most simple words and phrases.

The '''Mulao''' number 28,000 people, and are distributed in Majiang, Kaili, Huangping, Duyun, Weng'an, Fuquan, and other counties of southeastern Guizhou. The Mulao of Xuanwei and Jidong villages refer to themselves as the ''Mu'', in Longli village 龙里寨 they call themselves ''{{IPA|qa˨˦ɣo˥˧}}''. The Mulao speak a variety of Gelao, and not the [[Mulam language]] of Guangxi, which is also called Mulao. Luo (1997) describes the two Mulao varieties of ''{{IPA|qa˨˦o˥˧}}'' (''{{IPA|qa˨˦ɣo˥˧}}'') in [[Majiang County]] and ''{{IPA|lei˧˥wo˧}}'' in [[Kaili City]].&lt;ref name="Luo1997"&gt;Luo Shiqing [罗世庆]. 1997. ''The ethnic Mulao of Guizhou'' [贵州仫佬族]. Guiyang: Guizhou People's Press [贵州民族出版社].&lt;/ref&gt; One dialect is represented by the datapoints of Bamaozhai 巴茅寨 and Madizhai 马碲寨 of Xuanwei District 宣威区, Majiang County (Luo 1997:105, 115), and the other by Bailazhai 白腊寨, Lushan Town 炉山镇, Kaili City (Luo 1997:189); the latter is also spoken in Dafengdong 大风洞, Pingliang 平良, and Chong'anjiang 重安江. Mulao data from Majiang and Kaili are also given in Guizhou (1985).&lt;ref&gt;Guizhou provincial ethnic classification commission [贵州省民委民族识别办公室编]. 1985. ''Guizhou ethnic classification materials, no. 5: Ethnic classification of the Mulao people'' [贵州民族识别资料集, 第5集: 木佬人族识别问题调查资料专辑]. m.s.&lt;/ref&gt; also 

The extinct [[:zh:土蛮语|Tuman language]] (土蛮语) of [[Sinan County, Guizhou]] was a variety of Gelao.

In Qingzhen City, Gelao is spoken in the following villages (Qingzhen 2004:25-30).&lt;ref&gt;Qingzhen Ethnic and Religious Affairs Bureau [清镇市民族宗教事务局]. 2004. ''The Gelao people of Qingzhen City'' [清镇仡佬族]. Guiyang: Guizhou People's Press [贵州民族出版社]. {{ISBN|7541212148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhou (2004) reports that there are no more than 6,000 Gelao speakers, making up only 1.2% of the total number of ethnic [[Gelao people]]. The following table, based on Zhou (2004:150–151), shows the number of Gelao speakers in each [[Counties of the People's Republic of China|county]] as of the 1990s. All counties are in [[Guizhou]] province unless specified otherwise.

===Vietnam===
The most endangered variety, Red Gelao of Vietnam, is spoken by only about 50 people. Many speakers have shifted to [[Southwestern Mandarin]] or [[Hmong language|Hmong]]. The Red Gelao people, who call themselves the ''{{IPA|va˧˥ntɯ˧˩}}'', send brides back and forth among the villages of Na Khê and Bạch Đích (or Bìch Đich) in [[Yên Minh District]], [[Hà Giang Province]], Vietnam and another village in Fanpo, [[Malipo County]], [[Yunnan]], China&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=161186 |title=麻栗坡县杨万乡杨万村委会翻坡自然村 |publisher=Ynszxc.gov.cn |date= |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (autonym: ''{{IPA|u˧wei˥}}'') in order to ensure the continual survival of their ethnic group.

However, the White Gelao of Phố La Village and Sính Lủng Village of Dồng Văn District still speak the White Gelao language.

Gelao is not well documented, having only been studied by a few scholars such as [[Li Jinfang]], [[Jerold A. Edmondson]], Weera Ostapirat, and Zhang Jimin. The three varieties in Vietnam are not mutually intelligible, and three varieties in China may be distinct languages as well. ''[[Ethnologue]]'' classifies Gelao as four languages, perhaps as closely related to the two [[Lachi language]]s as they are to each other.

===Ostapirat (2000), Edmondson (2008)===
Ostapirat (2000) proposed three major subdivisions for Gelao, with a total of 17 varieties.&lt;ref name="Kra"&gt;Ostapirat, Weera (2000). "[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf4/weera2000proto.pdf Proto-Kra]". ''Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area'' '''23''' (1): 1-251&lt;/ref&gt; The Central and Southwestern branches shares various phonological innovations, suggesting an initial split with the Northern branch. Some varieties cited are also from Jerold A. Edmondson (2008).&lt;ref name="rg"&gt;{{cite web|author=Edmondson, Jerold A.|title=''Red Gelao, the most endangered form of the Gelao language''|url=http://ling.uta.edu/~jerry/rg.pdf|publisher=Ling.uta.edu|accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edmondson also proposes that Red Gelao of the China-Vietnam border may in fact constitute a separate primary branch of Gelao.

==Phonology==
Gelao has many [[uvular consonants|uvular]] and [[prenasalized consonant]]s.&lt;ref name="krac"&gt;{{cite web|author=Edmondson, Jerold A. |title=''Kra or Kadai languages'' |url=http://ling.uta.edu/~jerry/krac.pdf |publisher=Ling.uta.edu |accessdate=2013-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315001746/http://ling.uta.edu/~jerry/krac.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many varieties also preserve [[consonant cluster]]s that have been lost in most other related languages. These consonant clusters, such as {{IPA|pl, bl, pʰl, ml, mpl, vl, and kl}}, correspond regularly with consonants in Lachi, Mulao, Qabiao (Pubiao), Buyang, and various Kam–Tai languages. Gelao also shares many phonological features with [[Bouyei language|Bouyei]] and other neighboring non-Kra languages.

Many Gelao varieties have a total of six tones, including two level tones (''{{IPA|˧}}'' and ''{{IPA|˥}}''), two rising tones (''{{IPA|˩˧}}'' and ''{{IPA|˧˥}}''), and two falling tones (''{{IPA|˧˩}}'' and ''{{IPA|˥˧}}'').{{fix|text=These do not match the tones in the autonyms and in the grammar section}}

Sound correspondences between the [[Liuzhi]] (六枝) and [[Zhenfeng County|Zhenfeng]] (贞丰) varieties include:&lt;ref name="tansuo"/&gt;

[Liuzhi : Zhenfeng]

*{{IPA|pl}} : {{IPA|pj}}
*{{IPA|pʰl}} : {{IPA|p}}
*{{IPA|ml}} : {{IPA|m}}
*{{IPA|mp}} : {{IPA|m}}
*{{IPA|ntɕ}} : {{IPA|ɲ}} or {{IPA|nʲ}}
*{{IPA|ŋk}} : {{IPA|ŋ}} or {{IPA|k}}

==Grammar==
Like all of its surrounding languages, Gelao is a [[head-first]], [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]] language. Like [[Buyang language|Buyang]], one unusual feature of Gelao is that negatives usually come at the end of a sentence. [[Reduplication]] is very common and is used for diminutive or repetitive purposes.&lt;ref name="krac"/&gt; Other common features include the use of serial verb constructions and compound nouns. Although numerals and [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]] precede nouns, adjectives (including [[demonstrative]]s) always follow the noun. Function words, such as [[preposition]]s and auxiliary words, are often derived from verbs.

Like [[Buyang language|Buyang]] and [[Dong language|Dong]], Gelao retains many prefixes that have been lost in most other [[Kra–Dai languages]]. Zhang (1993:300) notes that the Moji (磨基) Longlin variant makes especially extensive use of prefixing syllables before nouns, verbs, and adjectives.&lt;ref name="zhang"&gt;张済民/Zhang, Jimin. 仡佬语研究/Gelao yu yan jiu (A Study of Gelao). 贵阳市/Guiyang, China: 贵州民族出版社/Guizhou min zu chu ban she, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; These prefixes are especially important for reconstruction purposes.

Many words in Gelao are derived from vernacular [[Southwest Mandarin]] Chinese. These loanwords are often used interchangeably with native Gelao words. There is also a highly rich system of classifiers.

Gelao also has a rich set of pronouns not attested in other Kra–Dai languages.&lt;ref name="krac"/&gt; There are also pronouns referring to one's household in particular. The following are pronouns from [[Pingba]] Gelao.&lt;ref name="zhang"/&gt;

*({{IPA|su˧}}) {{IPA|i˦˨}} – I
*({{IPA|su˧}}) {{IPA|mu˨˩}} - you
*({{IPA|su˧}}) {{IPA|u˦˨}} - he, she, it
*({{IPA|su˧}}) {{IPA|ta˧}} - we
*({{IPA|su˧}}) {{IPA|sa˧}} - you all
*{{IPA|pə˦˨nu˦˨}} - they
*{{IPA|qa˧/a˧ qei˦˨}} - my household
*{{IPA|qa˧/a˧ mu˨˩}} - your household
*{{IPA|qa˧/a˥ qu˦˨}} - his/her household

Pingba Gelao numerals are given below. Note the similarities with the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] numeral system.

#{{IPA|si˧}}
#{{IPA|su˧}}
#{{IPA|ta˧}}
#{{IPA|pu˧}}
#{{IPA|mpu˧}}
#{{IPA|naŋ˧}}
#{{IPA|ɕi˩˧}}
#{{IPA|zua˥}}
#{{IPA|sə˩˧}}
#{{IPA|pan˩˧}}

'''''Hair:  The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical''''' is a [[rock musical]] with a book and lyrics by [[Gerome Ragni]] and [[James Rado]]   and music by [[Galt MacDermot]]. A product of the [[hippie]] [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] and [[sexual revolution]] of the late 1960s, several of its songs became anthems of the [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War]] [[peace movement]].  The musical's profanity, its depiction of the use of illegal drugs, its treatment of [[free love|sexuality]], its irreverence for the [[American flag]], and its nude scene caused much comment and controversy.&lt;ref name=Horn87/&gt;  The musical broke new ground in [[musical theatre]] by defining the genre of "rock musical", using a racially integrated cast, and inviting the audience onstage for a "[[Human Be-In|Be-In]]" finale.&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;Pacheco, Patrick (June 17, 2001).

''Hair'' tells the story of the "tribe", a group of politically active, [[Long hair|long-haired]] hippies of the "[[Age of Aquarius]]" living a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] life in New York City and fighting against [[conscription]] into the [[Vietnam War]].  Claude, his good friend Berger, their roommate Sheila and their friends struggle to balance their young lives, loves, and the sexual revolution with their rebellion against the war and their [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] parents and society.  Ultimately, Claude must decide whether to [[Conscientious objector|resist the draft]] as his friends have done, or to succumb to the pressures of his parents (and conservative America) to serve in Vietnam, compromising his [[Pacifism|pacifist]] principles and risking his life.

After an [[off-Broadway]] debut on October 17, 1967, at [[Joseph Papp]]'s [[The Public Theater|Public Theater]] and a subsequent run at the [[Cheetah (nightclub)|Cheetah]] nightclub from December 1967 through January 1968, the show opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in April 1968 and ran for 1,750&amp;nbsp;performances.  Simultaneous productions in cities across the United States and Europe followed shortly thereafter, including a successful London production that ran for 1,997&amp;nbsp;performances. Since then, numerous productions have been staged around the world, spawning dozens of recordings of the musical, including the 3 million-selling [[Hair The Original Broadway Recording|original Broadway cast recording]]. Some of the songs from its score became [[Top 40|Top 10]] hits, and a [[Hair (film)|feature film adaptation]] was released in 1979. A Broadway revival opened in 2009, earning strong reviews and winning the [[Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical|Tony Award]] and [[Drama Desk Award]] for Best Revival of a Musical. In 2008, [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] wrote, "Today ''Hair'' seems, if anything, more daring than ever."&lt;ref name=daring&gt;[[Richard Zoglin|Zoglin, Richard]].

== History ==
''Hair'' was conceived by actors [[James Rado]] and [[Gerome Ragni]].  The two met in 1964 when they performed together in the [[Off-Broadway]] flop ''Hang Down Your Head and Die'',&lt;ref name=prog2009&gt;Haun, Harry. "Age of Aquarius", ''Playbill'', April 2009, from ''Hair'' at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and they began writing ''Hair'' together in late 1964.&lt;ref name=Hairstory&gt;[[James Rado|Rado, James]] (February 14, 2003).

''Lortel Archives: The Internet Off-Broadway Database''.  Retrieved on April 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The main characters were autobiographical, with Rado's Claude being a pensive romantic and Ragni's Berger an extrovert.  Their close relationship, including its volatility, was reflected in the musical.  Rado explained, "We were great friends.  It was a passionate kind of relationship that we directed into creativity, into writing, into creating this piece.  We put the drama between us on stage."&lt;ref name=StarLedger/&gt;

Rado described the inspiration for ''Hair'' as "a combination of some characters we met in the streets, people we knew and our own imaginations.  We knew this group of kids in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] who were [[Turn on, tune in, drop out|dropping out]] and [[Draft dodger|dodging the draft]], and there were also lots of articles in the press about how kids were being kicked out of school for growing their hair long".&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt;  He recalled, "There was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas, and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would be wonderful.&amp;nbsp;... We hung out with them and went to their [[Human Be-In|Be-Ins]] [and] let our hair grow."&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;Taylor, Kate (September 14, 2007).

Retrieved on May 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Many cast members ([[Shelley Plimpton]] in particular) were recruited right off the street.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt;  Rado said, "It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples.  You could read about it and see film clips, but you'd never ''experience'' it.  We thought, 'This is happening in the streets', and we wanted to bring it to the stage."&lt;ref name=prog2009/&gt;

Rado and Ragni came from different artistic backgrounds. In college, Rado wrote musical [[revue]]s and aspired to be a Broadway composer in the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] tradition.  He went on to study acting with [[Lee Strasberg]].  Ragni, on the other hand, was an active member of [[The Open Theater]], one of several groups, mostly [[Off-off Broadway]], that were developing [[experimental theatre]] techniques.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;Miller, pp. 54–56&lt;/ref&gt;  He introduced Rado to the modern theatre styles and methods being developed at The Open Theater.&lt;ref&gt;Horn, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1966, while the two were developing ''Hair'', Ragni performed in The Open Theater's production of [[Megan Terry]]'s play, ''[[Viet Rock]]'', a story about young men being deployed to the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Botting]], ''The Theatre of Protest in America'', Edmonton: Harden House, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the war theme, ''Viet Rock'' employed the improvisational exercises being used in the experimental theatre scene and later used in the development of ''Hair''.&lt;ref name=Lortel/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horn, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Rado and Ragni brought their drafts of the show to producer Eric Blau who, through common friend [[Nat Shapiro]], connected the two with Canadian composer Galt MacDermot.&lt;ref&gt;Horn, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; MacDermot had won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1961 for his composition "African Waltz" (recorded by [[Cannonball Adderley]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004172/Galt-MacDermot.html "Galt MacDermot Biography"].  ''musiciansguide.com''.  Retrieved on April 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The composer's lifestyle was in marked contrast to his co-creators: "I had short hair, a wife, and, at that point, four children, and I lived on [[Staten Island]]."&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;  "I never even heard of a hippie when I met Rado and Ragni."&lt;ref name=prog2009/&gt;  But he shared their enthusiasm to do a rock and roll show.&lt;ref name=prog2009/&gt;  "We work independently", explained MacDermot in May 1968.  "I prefer it that way.  They hand me the material.  I set it to music."&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, Herbert (May 1968).

=== Off-Broadway productions ===
The creators pitched the show to Broadway producers and received many rejections.  Eventually [[Joe Papp]], who ran the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]], decided he wanted ''Hair'' to open the new [[Public Theater]] (still under construction) in New York City's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]. The musical was the first work by living authors that Papp produced.&lt;ref&gt;Saltz, Amy.

The director, [[Gerald Freedman]], the theater's associate artistic director, withdrew in frustration during the final week of rehearsals and offered his resignation.  Papp accepted it, and the choreographer [[Anna Sokolow]] took over the show.&amp;nbsp;... After a disastrous final dress rehearsal, Papp wired Mr. Freedman in Washington, where he'd fled: 'Please come back.'  Mr. Freedman did."&lt;ref name=isherwooda&gt;Isherwood, Charles (September 16, 2007).

''Hair'' premiered off-Broadway at the Public on October 17, 1967, and ran for a limited engagement of six weeks.  The lead roles were played by Walker Daniels as Claude, Ragni as Berger, Jill O'Hara as Sheila, Steve Dean as Woof, [[Arnold Wilkerson]] as Hud, [[Sally Eaton]] as Jeanie and Shelley Plimpton as Crissy.&lt;ref&gt;Horn, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Set design was by [[Ming Cho Lee]], costume design by Theoni Aldredge, and although Anna Sokolow began rehearsals as choreographer, Freedman received choreographer credit.&lt;ref&gt;Horn, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; Although the production had a "tepid critical reception", it was popular with audiences.&lt;ref name=isherwooda/&gt; A [[Hair (Original Off-Broadway Cast Recording)|cast album]] was released in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OigEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT1 "Album Reviews"], ''Billboard'', December 2, 1967, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicago businessman [[Michael Butler (producer)|Michael Butler]] was planning to run for the [[U.S. Senate]] on an anti-war platform.  After seeing an ad for ''Hair'' in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that led him to believe the show was about [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], he watched the Public's production several times&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; and joined forces with Joe Papp to reproduce the show at another New York venue after the close of its run at the Public.  Papp and Butler first moved the show to [[Cheetah (nightclub)|The Cheetah]], a discothèque at 53rd Street and Broadway.  It opened there on December 22, 1967,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sam Zolotow|Zolotow, Sam]] (January 23, 1968).

=== Revision for Broadway ===
''Hair'' underwent a thorough overhaul between its closing at the Cheetah in January 1968 and its Broadway opening three months later.  The off-Broadway book, already light on plot, was loosened even further&lt;ref name="horn39"/&gt; and made more realistic.&lt;ref name="allmusic"&gt;Planer, Lindsay.  [http://www.allmusic.com/album/hair-original-1967-off-broadway-cast-r677160/review "''Hair'' [Original 1967 Off-Broadway Cast&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;"], AllMusic.com, accessed February 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; {{nowrap|Thirteen new songs}} were added,&lt;ref name="horn39"&gt;Horn, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; including "Let the Sun Shine In", to make the ending more uplifting.&lt;ref name=StarLedger/&gt;

Before the move to Broadway, the creative team hired director [[Tom O'Horgan]], who had built a reputation directing experimental theater at the [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club]].  He had been the authors' first choice to direct the Public Theater production, but he was in Europe at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Horn, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Newsweek]]'' described O'Horgan's directing style as "sensual, savage, and thoroughly musical&amp;nbsp;... [he] disintegrates verbal structure and often breaks up and distributes narrative and even character among different actors.&amp;nbsp;... He enjoys sensory bombardment."&lt;ref&gt;Junker, Howard. [http://www.orlok.com/hair/holding/articles/HairArticles/Newsweek6-3-68.html "Director of the Year"].  ''Newsweek'', orlok.com, June 3, 1968, accessed April 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  In rehearsals, O'Horgan used techniques passed down by [[Viola Spolin]] and [[Paul Sills]] involving role playing and improvisational "games".  Many of the improvisations tried during this process were incorporated into the Broadway script.&lt;ref name=horn53&gt;Horn, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; O'Horgan and new choreographer Julie Arenal encouraged freedom and spontaneity in their actors, introducing "an organic, expansive style of staging" that had never been seen before on Broadway.&lt;ref name=prog2009/&gt;  The inspiration to include nudity came when the authors saw an anti-war demonstration in Central Park where two men stripped naked as an expression of defiance and freedom, and they decided to incorporate the idea into the show.&lt;ref name=prog2009/&gt;  O'Horgan had used nudity in many of the plays he directed, and he helped integrate the idea into the fabric of the show.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt;

Papp declined to pursue a Broadway production, and so Butler produced the show himself.  For a time it seemed that Butler would be unable to secure a Broadway theater, as the [[The Shubert Organization|Shuberts]], [[Nederlander Organization|Nederlanders]] and other theater owners deemed the material too controversial. However, Butler had family connections and knew important people; he persuaded [[Samuel J. Friedman Theatre|Biltmore Theatre]] owner David Cogan to make his venue available.&lt;ref&gt;Horn, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

;Act I
Claude, the nominal leader of the "tribe", sits center stage as the tribe mingles with the audience.  Tribe members Sheila, a [[New York University]] student who is a determined [[political activist]], and Berger, an irreverent free spirit, cut a lock of Claude's hair and burn it in a receptacle.  After the tribe converges in slow-motion toward the stage, through the audience, they begin their celebration as children of the Age of Aquarius ("Aquarius").  Berger removes his trousers to reveal a loincloth.  Interacting with the audience, he introduces himself as a "psychedelic teddy bear" and reveals that he is "looking for my Donna" ("Donna").

The tribe recites a list of pharmaceuticals, legal and illegal ("Hashish").  Woof, a gentle soul, extols several sexual practices ("Sodomy") and says, "I grow things."  He loves plants, his family and the audience, telling the audience, "We are all one."  Hud, a militant African-American, is carried in upside down on a pole.  He declares himself "president of the United States of Love" ("Colored Spade"). In a fake English accent, Claude says that he is "the most beautiful beast in the forest" from "[[Manchester]], England". A tribe member reminds him that he's really from [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]], New York ("Manchester England"). Hud, Woof and Berger declare what color they are ("I'm Black"), while Claude says that he's "invisible". The tribe recites a list of things they lack ("Ain't Got No").  Four African-American tribe members recite street signs in symbolic sequence ("Dead End").

Sheila is carried onstage ("I Believe in Love") and leads the tribe in a protest chant. Jeanie, an eccentric young woman, appears wearing a gas mask, satirizing pollution ("Air").  She is pregnant and in love with Claude.  Although she wishes it was Claude's baby, she was "knocked up by some crazy speed freak". The tribe link together LBJ (President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]), FBI (the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]), CIA (the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]) and [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] ("Initials"). Six members of the tribe appear dressed as Claude's parents, berating him for his various transgressions – he does not have a job, and he collects "mountains of paper" clippings and notes. They say that they will not give him any more money, and "the army'll make a man out of you", presenting him with his draft notice. In defiance, Claude leads the tribe in celebrating their vitality ("I Got Life").

After handing out imaginary pills to the tribe members, saying the pills are for high-profile people such as [[Richard Nixon]], [[Paul VI|the Pope]], and "[[George Wallace|Alabama Wallace]]", Berger relates how he was expelled from high school. Three tribe members dress up as principals in Hitler mustaches and swastika arm bands, mocking the American education system. Berger and the tribe defy them, singing "Going Down".  Claude returns from his [[Conscription|draft board]] physical, which he passed.  He pretends to burn his Vietnam War draft card, which Berger reveals as a library card.  Claude agonizes about what to do about being drafted.

Two tribe members dressed as tourists come down the aisle to ask the tribe why they have such [[long hair]]. In answer, Claude and Berger lead the tribe in explaining the significance of their locks ("Hair"). The woman states that kids should "be free, no guilt" and should "do whatever you want, just so long as you don't hurt anyone."  She observes that long hair is natural, like the "elegant plumage" of male birds ("My Conviction"). She opens her coat to reveal that she's a man in [[drag (clothing)|drag]].  As the couple leaves, the tribe calls her [[Margaret Mead]].

Sheila gives Berger a yellow shirt. He goofs around and ends up tearing it in two.  Sheila voices her distress that Berger seems to care more about the "bleeding crowd" than about her ("[[Easy to Be Hard]]").  Jeanie summarizes everyone's romantic entanglements: "I'm hung up on Claude, Sheila's hung up on Berger, Berger is hung up everywhere. Claude is hung up on a cross over Sheila and Berger." Berger, Woof and another tribe member pay satiric tribute to the American flag as they fold it ("Don't Put it Down").  The tribe runs out to the audience, inviting them to a [[Be-In]]. After young and innocent Crissy describes "Frank Mills", a boy she's looking for, the tribe participates in the "Be-In". The men of the tribe [[Draft-card burning|burn their draft cards]].  Claude puts his card in the fire, then changes his mind and pulls it out.  He asks, "where is the something, where is the someone, that tells me why I live and die?" ("Where Do I Go").  The tribe emerges naked, intoning "beads, flowers, freedom, happiness."

;Act II
Four&amp;nbsp;tribe&amp;nbsp;members have the "Electric Blues".  After a black-out, the tribe enters worshiping in an attempt to summon Claude ("Oh Great God of Power"). Claude returns from the induction center, and tribe members act out an imagined conversation from Claude's draft interview, with Hud saying "the draft is white people sending black people to make war on the yellow people to defend the land they stole from the red people".  Claude gives Woof a [[Mick Jagger]] poster, and Woof is excited about the gift, as he has said he's hung up on Jagger.  Three white women of the tribe tell why they like "Black Boys" ("black boys are delicious ..."), and three&amp;nbsp;black&amp;nbsp;women of the tribe, dressed like [[The Supremes]], explain why they like "White Boys" ("white boys are so pretty ...").

Berger gives a joint to Claude that is laced with a [[hallucinogen]].  Claude starts to trip as the tribe acts out his visions ("Walking in Space").  He hallucinates that he is skydiving from a plane into the jungles of Vietnam.  Berger appears as General [[George Washington]] and is told to retreat because of an Indian attack. The Indians shoot all of Washington's men.  General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] appears and begins a roll call: [[Abraham Lincoln]] (played by a black female tribe member), [[John Wilkes Booth]], [[Calvin Coolidge]], [[Clark Gable]], [[Scarlett O'Hara]], [[Aretha Franklin]], Colonel [[George Custer]].  Claude Bukowski is called in the roll call, but Clark Gable says "he couldn't make it".  They all dance a [[minuet]] until three African [[witch doctor]]s kill them – all except for Abraham Lincoln who says, "I'm one of you".  Lincoln, after the three&amp;nbsp;Africans sing his praises, recites an alternate version of the Gettysburg Address ("Abie Baby").  Booth shoots Lincoln, but Lincoln says to him, "I ain't dying for no white man".

As the visions continue, {{nowrap|four [[Buddhist monk]]s}} enter.  One monk pours a can of gasoline over another monk, who is set afire (reminiscent of the [[self-immolation]] of [[Thích Quảng Đức]]) and runs off screaming. {{nowrap|Three Catholic nuns}} strangle the {{nowrap|three remaining Buddhist monks}}. {{nowrap|Three astronauts}} shoot the nuns with [[ray gun]]s.  {{nowrap|Three Chinese}} people stab the astronauts with knives.  {{nowrap|Three Native Americans}} kill the Chinese with bows and tomahawks.  {{nowrap|Three [[Special Forces (United States Army)|green berets]]}} kill the Native Americans with machine guns and then kill each other.  A Sergeant and two&amp;nbsp;parents appear holding up a suit on a hanger.  The parents talk to the suit as if it is their son and they are very proud of him.  The bodies rise and play like children.  The play escalates to violence until they are all dead again. They rise again and comment about the casualties in Vietnam: "It's a dirty little war" ("[[Three-Five-Zero-Zero]]").

After the trip, Claude says "I can't take this moment to moment living on the streets. ... I know what I want to be ... invisible".  As they "look at the moon," Sheila and the others enjoy a light moment ("[[Good Morning Starshine]]").  The tribe pays tribute to an old mattress ("The Bed"). Claude is left alone with his doubts.  He leaves as the tribe enters wrapped in blankets in the midst of a snow storm.  They start a protest chant and then wonder where Claude has gone.  Berger calls out "Claude! Claude!"  Claude enters dressed in a military uniform, his hair short, but they do not see him because he is an invisible spirit.  Claude says, "like it or not, they got me."

Claude and everyone sing "Flesh Failures".  The tribe moves in front of Claude as Sheila and Dionne take up the lyric.  The whole tribe launches into "Let the Sun Shine In", and as they exit, they reveal Claude lying down center stage on a black cloth.  During the curtain call, the tribe reprises "Let the Sun Shine In" and brings audience members up on stage to dance.

== Early productions ==

=== Broadway ===
''Hair'' opened on Broadway at the [[Biltmore Theatre]] on April 29, 1968.  The production was directed by Tom O'Horgan and choreographed by Julie Arenal, with set design by [[Robin Wagner (designer)|Robin Wagner]], costume design by Nancy Potts, and lighting design by [[Jules Fisher]].  The original Broadway "tribe" (i.e., cast) included authors Rado and Ragni, who played the lead roles of Claude and Berger, respectively, and Lynn Kellogg as Sheila, Lamont Washington as Hud, Sally Eaton and Shelley Plimpton reprising their off-Broadway roles as Jeanie and Crissy, [[Melba Moore]] as Dionne, Steve Curry as Woof, [[Ronnie Dyson]] (who sang "Aquarius" and "What a Piece of Work is Man"), [[Paul Jabara]] and [[Diane Keaton]] (both Moore and Keaton later played Sheila).&lt;ref name=IBDB&gt;[https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/hair-3393 original Broadway production of ''Hair''] at the Internet Broadway Database, accessed June 30, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the performers who appeared in ''Hair'' during its original Broadway run were [[Ben Vereen]], [[Keith Carradine]], [[Barry McGuire]], [[Ted Lange]], [[Meat Loaf]], [[Dolores "LaLa" Brooks|La La Brooks]], Kenny Seymour (of [[Little Anthony and the Imperials]]), [[Joe Butler]], Peppy Castro (of the [[Blues Magoos]]), [[Robin McNamara]], Heather MacRae (daughter of [[Gordon MacRae]] and [[Sheila MacRae]]), [[Eddie Rambeau]], [[Vicki Sue Robinson]], [[Beverly Bremers]], [[Dale Soules]] and [[Kim Milford]].&lt;ref name=IBDB/&gt;

The ''Hair'' team soon became embroiled in a lawsuit with the organizers of the [[Tony Award]]s. After assuring producer Michael Butler that commencing previews by April 3, 1968, would assure eligibility for consideration for the 1968 Tonys, the New York Theatre League ruled ''Hair'' ineligible, moving the cutoff date to March 19.

=== Early regional productions ===
The [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] version played at the [[Earl Carroll Theatre#Aquarius Theater|Aquarius Theater]] in Los Angeles beginning about six months after the Broadway opening and running for an unprecedented two years.  The Los Angeles tribe included Rado, Ragni, [[Robert Rothman]], Ben Vereen (who replaced Ragni), Willie Weatherly (who played Berger and Claude) Red Shepard, [[Ted Neeley]] (who replaced Rado), [[Meat Loaf]], [[Gloria Jones]], [[Tata Vega|Táta Vega]], [[Jobriath]], [[Jennifer Warnes]], and [[Dobie Gray]].&lt;ref name=Hairstory/&gt;

It was rare for so many productions to run simultaneously during an initial Broadway run.  Producer Michael Butler, who had declared that ''Hair'' is "the strongest anti-war statement ever written", said the reason that he opened so many productions was to influence public opinion against the Vietnam War and end it as soon as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Butler (producer)|Butler, Michael]].

=== West End ===
''Hair'' opened at the [[Shaftesbury Theatre]] in London on September 27, 1968, led by the same creative team as the Broadway production.

=== Early international productions ===
The job of leading the foreign language productions of ''Hair'' was given to [[Bertrand Castelli]], Butler's partner and executive producer of the Broadway show.&lt;ref name=Horn103&gt;Horn, pp. 103–10&lt;/ref&gt;  Castelli was a writer/producer who traveled in Paris art circles and rubbed elbows with [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Jean Cocteau]].  Butler described him as a "crazy showman ... the guy with the business suit and beads".&lt;ref&gt;Horn, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;  Castelli decided to do the show in the local language of each country at a time when Broadway shows were always done in English.&lt;ref name=Horn103/&gt;  The translations followed the original script closely, and the Broadway stagings were used.

== Themes ==
''Hair'' explores many of the themes of the hippie movement of the 1960s.  Theatre writer Scott Miller described these as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he youth of America, especially those on college campuses, started protesting all the things that they saw wrong with America: racism, environmental destruction, poverty, sexism and sexual repression, violence at home and the war in Vietnam, depersonalization from new technologies, and corruption in politics. ... Contrary to popular opinion, the hippies had great respect for America and believed that they were the true patriots, the only ones who genuinely wanted to save our country and make it the best it could be once again. ... [Long] hair was the hippies' flag – their ... symbol not only of rebellion but also of new possibilities, a symbol of the rejection of discrimination and restrictive gender roles (a philosophy celebrated in the song "My Conviction").  It symbolized equality between men and women. ... [T]he hippies' chosen clothing also made statements. Drab work clothes (jeans, work shirts, pea coats) were a rejection of materialism.  Clothing from other cultures, particularly the Third World and native Americans, represented their awareness of the global community and their rejection of U.S. imperialism and selfishness.  Simple cotton dresses and other natural fabrics were a rejection of synthetics, a return to natural things and simpler times.  Some hippies wore old World War II or Civil War jackets as way of co-opting the symbols of war into their newfound philosophy of nonviolence.&lt;ref name=Applause&gt;Miller, Scott (2001). [http://www.michaelbutler.com/hair/holding/articles/HairArticles/scottmiller.html "HAIR&amp;nbsp;– An analysis by Scott Miller"; excerpt from ''Rebels with applause: Broadway's groundbreaking musicals'']. Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann.  {{ISBN|0-325-00357-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Race and the tribe ===
Extending the precedents set by ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1927) and ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' (1935), ''Hair'' opened the Broadway musical to racial integration; fully one-third of the cast was African American.&lt;ref name=Horn134&gt;Horn, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;  Except for satirically in skits, the roles for the black members of the tribe portrayed them as equals, breaking away from the traditional roles for blacks in entertainment as slaves or servants.&lt;ref name=script/&gt; An ''[[Ebony magazine|Ebony]]'' magazine article declared that the show was the biggest outlet for black actors in the history of the U.S. stage.&lt;ref name=Horn134/&gt;

Several songs and scenes from the show address racial issues.&lt;ref name=Applause/&gt; "Colored Spade", which introduces the character Hud, a militant black male, is a long list of racial slurs ("jungle bunny ... little black sambo") topped off with the declaration that Hud is the "president of the United States of love".&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerome Ragni|Ragni, Gerome]] and [[James Rado]] (Lyricists), [[Galt MacDermot]] (Composer), and Lamont Washington (Vocalist).  (1968).  ''Hair'' [Audio Recording]. [[RCA Victor]].  Event occurs at Track 5, "Colored Spade".&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of his song, he tells the tribe that the "boogie man" will get them, as the tribe pretends to be frightened.&lt;ref name=script/&gt; "Dead End", sung by black tribe members, is a list of street signs that symbolize black frustration and alienation. One of the tribe's protest chants is "What do we think is really great? To bomb, lynch and segregate!"&lt;ref name=script/&gt;  "Black Boys/White Boys" is an exuberant acknowledgement of interracial sexual attraction;&lt;ref&gt;Ragni and Rado (Lyricists), MacDermot (Composer) (1968). ''Hair'' [Audio Recording].  RCA Victor.  Event occurs at Track 25, "White Boys".&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. Supreme Court had struck down laws against the practice in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'', 388 U.S. 1; 87 S. Ct. 1817; 18 L. Ed. 2d 1010; 1967 U.S. LEXIS 1082&lt;/ref&gt;  Another of the tribe's protest chants is "Black, white, yellow, red. Copulate in a king-sized bed."&lt;ref name=script/&gt;

"Abie Baby" is part of the Act 2 "trip" sequence: four African witch doctors, who have just killed various American historical, cultural and fictional characters, sing the praises of Abraham Lincoln, portrayed by a black female tribe member, whom they decide not to kill.&lt;ref&gt;Ragni and Rado (Lyricists), MacDermot (Composer) (1968).  ''Hair'' [Audio Recording].  RCA Victor.  Event occurs at Track 27, "Abie Baby".&lt;/ref&gt; The first part of the song contains stereotypical language that black characters used in old movies, like "I's finished ... pluckin' y'all's chickens" and "I's free now thanks to y'all, Master Lincoln".  The Lincoln character then recites a modernized version of the [[Gettysburg Address]], while a white female tribe member polishes Lincoln's shoes with her blond hair.&lt;ref name=script/&gt;

The many references to Native Americans throughout the script are part of the [[anti-consumerism]], naturalism focus of the hippie movement and of ''Hair''.  The characters in the show are referred to as the "tribe", borrowing the term for Native American communities.&lt;ref name=Applause/&gt;  The cast of each production chooses a tribal name: "The practice is not just cosmetic ... the entire cast must work together, must like each other, and often within the show, must work as a single organism.  All the sense of family, of belonging, of responsibility and loyalty inherent in the word 'tribe' has to be felt by the cast."&lt;ref name=Applause/&gt; To enhance this feeling, O'Horgan put the cast through sensitivity exercises based on trust, touching, listening and intensive examination that broke down barriers between the cast and crew and encouraged bonding.  These exercises were based on techniques developed at the [[Esalen Institute]] and Polish Lab Theater.&lt;ref name=horn53/&gt;  The idea of Claude, Berger and Sheila living together is another facet of the 1960s concept of ''tribe''.&lt;ref&gt;The 1960s concept of a menage-a-trois as a ''tribe'' is illustrated by the cover of the book [http://www.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-bin/imgload.cgi/137 ''The Love Tribe''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013200641/http://lib.virginia.edu/cgi-bin/imgload.cgi/137 |date=October 13, 2007 }}, Mathewson, Joseph (1968).

=== Nudity, sexual freedom and drug use ===
The brief nude scene at the end of Act I was a subject of controversy and notoriety.&lt;ref name=Horn87/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/27/newsid_3107000/3107815.stm "Musical ''Hair'' opens as censors withdraw"].  ''On this Day''. bbc.co.uk (November 27, 1968). Retrieved on April 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Miller writes that "nudity was a big part of the hippie culture, both as a rejection of the sexual repression of their parents and also as a statement about naturalism, spirituality, honesty, openness, and freedom.  The naked body was beautiful, something to be celebrated and appreciated, not scorned and hidden. They saw their bodies and their sexuality as gifts, not as 'dirty' things."&lt;ref name=Applause/&gt;

''Hair'' glorifies sexual freedom in a variety of ways. In addition to acceptance of interracial attraction, mentioned above, the characters' lifestyle acts as a sexually and politically charged updating of ''[[La bohème]]''; as Rado explained, "The love element of the peace movement was palpable."&lt;ref name=prog2009/&gt;  In the song "Sodomy", Woof exhorts everyone to "join the holy orgy [[Kama Sutra]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ragni and Rado (Lyricists), MacDermot (Composer), and Steve Curry (Vocalist).

Various illegal drugs are taken by the characters during the course of the show, most notably a hallucinogen during the trip sequence.&lt;ref name=Applause/&gt;  The song "Walking in Space" begins the sequence, and the lyrics celebrate the experience declaring "how dare they try to end this beauty ... in this dive we rediscover sensation ... our eyes are open, wide, wide, wide".  Similarly, in the song "Donna", Berger sings that "I'm evolving through the drugs that you put down."&lt;ref&gt;Ragni and Rado (Lyricists), MacDermot (Composer), and Original Broadway Cast (Vocalists).

For example, Jeanie, after revealing that she is pregnant by a "[[speed (drug)|speed]] freak", says that "[[methedrine]] is a bad scene".&lt;ref name=script/&gt;  The song "Hashish" provides a list of pharmaceuticals, both illegal and legal, including cocaine, alcohol, LSD, opium and [[Thorazine]], which is used as an [[antipsychotic]].&lt;ref name=miller116/&gt;

=== Pacifism and environmentalism ===
The theme of opposition to the war that pervades the show is unified by the plot thread that progresses through the book – Claude's [[conscientious objector|moral dilemma]] over whether to [[draft dodger|burn his draft card]].&lt;ref name=Applause/&gt; [[Pacifism]] is explored throughout the extended trip sequence in Act 2.  The lyrics to "[[Three-Five-Zero-Zero]]", which is sung during that sequence, evoke the horrors of war ("ripped open by metal explosion").&lt;ref&gt;Ragni and Rado (Lyricists), MacDermot (Composer), and Original Broadway Cast (Vocalists).  (1968)  ''Hair'' [Audio Recording].  RCA Victor.  Event occurs at Track 28, "Three-Five-Zero-Zero".&lt;/ref&gt;  The song is based on [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s 1966 poem, "[[Wichita Vortex Sutra]]".  In the poem, General Maxwell Taylor proudly reports to the press the number of enemy soldiers killed in one month, repeating it digit by digit, for effect: "Three-Five-Zero-Zero."  The song begins with images of death and dying and turns into a manic dance number, echoing Maxwell's glee at reporting the enemy casualties, as the tribe chants "Take weapons up and begin to kill".&lt;ref name=Applause/&gt;  The song also includes the repeated phrase "Prisoners in niggertown/ It's a dirty little war".&lt;ref name=script/&gt;

"Don't Put It Down" satirizes the unexamined patriotism of people who are literally "crazy" for the American flag.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, pp. 110–11&lt;/ref&gt;  "Be In (Hare Krishna)" praises the peace movement and events like the [[Be-In|San Francisco]] and [[Central Park Be-In]]s.&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, Don (March 30, 1967).

Now!" and "Do not enter the induction center".&lt;ref name=script/&gt;  The upbeat song, "Let the Sun Shine In", is a call to action, to reject the darkness of war and change the world for the better.&lt;ref name=Applause/&gt;

''Hair'' also aims its satire at the pollution caused by our civilization.&lt;ref name=Applause/&gt; Jeanie appears from a trap door in the stage wearing a gas mask and then sings the song "Air": "Welcome, sulfur dioxide. Hello carbon monoxide. The air ... is everywhere".&lt;ref&gt;Ragni and Rado (Lyricists), MacDermot (Composer) (1968)  ''Hair'' [Audio Recording].  RCA Victor.  Event occurs at Track 11, "Air".&lt;/ref&gt;  She suggests that pollution will eventually kill her, "vapor and fume at the stone of my tomb, breathing like a sullen perfume".&lt;ref name=script/&gt;  In a comic, pro-green vein, when Woof introduces himself, he explains that he "grows things" like "beets, and corn ... and sweet peas" and that he "loves the flowers and the fuzz and the trees".&lt;ref name=script/&gt;

=== Religion and astrology ===
Religion, particularly Catholicism, appears both overtly and symbolically throughout the piece, and it is often made the brunt of a joke.&lt;ref name=Applause/&gt; Berger sings of looking for "my Donna", giving it the double meaning of the woman he's searching for and the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Madonna]].&lt;ref name=liner/&gt; During "Sodomy", a hymn-like paean to all that is "dirty" about sex, the cast strikes evocative religious positions: the [[Pietà]] and Christ on the cross.&lt;ref name=liner&gt;Davis, Lorrie (1968).

In Act II, when Berger gives imaginary pills to various famous figures, he offers "a [[Oral contraceptive pill|pill]] for [[Catholic contraception|the Pope]]".&lt;ref name=script/&gt;  In "Going Down", after being kicked out of school, Berger compares himself to [[Lucifer]]: "Just like the angel that fell / Banished forever to hell / Today have I been expelled / From high school heaven."&lt;ref&gt;Ragni and Rado (Lyricists), MacDermot (Composer), and Gerome Ragni (Vocalist).

I shall vanish and be forgotten," then gives benediction to the tribe and the audience.  Claude suffers from indecision, and, in his [[Gethsemane]] at the end of Act I, he asks "Where Do I Go?".  There are textual allusions to Claude being on a cross, and, in the end, he is chosen to give his life for the others.&lt;ref name=miller88/&gt;  Berger has been seen as a [[John the Baptist]] figure, preparing the way for Claude.&lt;ref name=Applause/&gt;

=== Literary themes and symbolism ===
''Hair'' makes many references to [[Shakespeare]]'s plays, especially ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Hamlet]]'', and, at times, takes lyrical material directly from Shakespeare.&lt;ref name=Applause/&gt;  For example, the lyrics to the song "What a Piece of Work Is Man" are from ''Hamlet'' (II:&amp;nbsp;scene&amp;nbsp;2) and portions of "Flesh Failures" ("the rest is silence") are from Hamlet's final lines.  In "Flesh Failures/Let The Sun Shine In", the lyrics "Eyes, look your last!/ Arms, take your last embrace! And lips, O you/ The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss" are from ''Romeo and Juliet'' (V: iii, 111–14).&lt;ref&gt;Ragni and Rado (Lyricists), MacDermot (Composer)  (1968)  ''Hair'' [Audio Recording].  RCA Victor.  Event occurs at Track 32, "The Flesh Failures (Let the Sunshine In)".&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Miller, the ''Romeo'' suicide imagery makes the point that, with our complicity in war, we are killing ourselves.&lt;ref name=Applause/&gt;

Symbolically, the running plot of Claude's indecision, especially his resistance to burning his draft card, which ultimately causes his demise, has been seen as a parallel to ''Hamlet'': "the melancholy hippie".&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;  The symbolism is carried into the last scene, where Claude appears as a ghostly spirit among his friends wearing an army uniform in an ironic echo of an earlier scene, where he says, "I know what I want to be ... invisible".  According to Public Theater Artistic Director [[Oskar Eustis]], "Both [''Hair'' and ''Hamlet''] center on idealistic brilliant men as they struggle to find their place in a world marred by war, violence, and venal politics.  They see both the luminous possibilities and the harshest realities of being human.  In the end, unable to effectively combat the evil around them, they tragically succumb."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorktheatreguide.com/news/feb08/shakespeare07feb08.htm "Shakespeare in the Park to present ''Hamlet'' and the musical ''Hair''].  ''newyorktheatreguide.com'' (February 7, 2008).  Retrieved on April 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other literary references include the song "Three-Five-Zero-Zero", based on Ginsberg's poem "Wichita Vortex Sutra",&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; and, in the psychedelic drug trip sequence, the portrayal of [[Scarlett O'Hara]], from ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', and activist African-American poet [[LeRoi Jones]].&lt;ref name=script/&gt;

== Dramatics ==
In his introduction to the published script of ''Viet Rock'', [[Richard Schechner]] says, "performance, action, and event are the key terms of our theatre – and these terms are not literary."&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1950s, Off-off Broadway theaters began experimenting with non-traditional theater roles, blurring the lines between playwright, director, and actor.  The playwright's job was not just to put words on a page, but to create a theatrical experience based on a central idea.  By 1967, theaters such as [[The Living Theatre]], [[La MaMa E.T.C.]] and [[The Open Theatre]] were actively devising plays from improvisational scenes crafted in the rehearsal space, rather than following a traditional script.&lt;ref name=miller56&gt;Miller, pp. 56–58&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Viet Rock'' and ''Hair'' ===
Megan Terry's ''Viet Rock'' was created using this improvisational process.&lt;ref name=miller56/&gt;  Scenes in ''Viet Rock'' were connected in "prelogical ways": a scene could be built from a tangent from the scene before, it could be connected psychologically, or it could be in counterpoint to the previous scene.&lt;ref name=miller56/&gt;  Actors were asked to switch roles in the middle of a show, and frequently in mid-scene.  In her stage directions for a Senate hearing scene in ''Viet Rock'', Terry wrote, "The actors should take turns being senators and witnesses; the transformations should be abrupt and total.  When the actor is finished with one character he becomes another, or just an actor."&lt;ref name=miller56/&gt;

''Hair'' was designed in much the same way.  Tom O'Horgan, the show's Broadway director, was intimately involved in the experimental theatre movement.&lt;ref name=Applause/&gt;  In the transition to Broadway, O'Horgan and the writers rearranged scenes to increase the experimental aspects of the show.&lt;ref name=miller56/&gt;  ''Hair'' asks its actors to assume several different characters throughout the course of the piece, and, as in Claude's psychedelic trip in Act 2, sometimes during the same scene.  Both ''Hair'' and ''Viet Rock'' include rock music, borrowed heavily from mass media, and frequently break down the invisible "[[fourth wall]]" to interact with the audience.  For example, in the opening number, the tribe mingles with audience members, and at the end of the show, the audience is invited on stage.&lt;ref name=miller56/&gt;

=== Production design ===
In the original Broadway production, the stage was completely open, with no curtain and the fly area and grid exposed to the audience.  The proscenium arch was outlined with climb-ready scaffolding.  Wagner's spare set was painted in shades of grey with street [[graffiti]] stenciled on the stage.  The stage was raked, and a tower of abstract scaffolding upstage at the rear merged a Native American totem pole and a modern sculpture of a [[crucifix]]-shaped tree.  This scaffolding was decorated with found objects that the cast had gathered from the streets of New York.  These included a life-size [[papier-mâché]] bus driver, the head of Jesus, and a neon marquee of the Waverly movie theater in Greenwich Village.&lt;ref name=Horn61&gt;Horn, pp. 61–64&lt;/ref&gt;  Potts' costumes were based on hippie street clothes, made more theatrical with enhanced color and texture.  Some of these included mixed parts of military uniforms, bell bottom jeans with Ukrainian embroidery, tie dyed T-shirts and a red white and blue fringed coat.&lt;ref name=Horn61/&gt;  Early productions were primarily reproductions of this basic design.

=== Nude scene ===
"Much has been written about that scene ... most of it silly," wrote Gene Lees in ''[[High Fidelity (magazine)|High Fidelity]]''.&lt;ref name=highfidelity/&gt; The scene was inspired by two men who took off their clothes to antagonize the police during an informal anti-war gathering.&lt;ref name=StarLedger&gt;[http://www.nj.com/entertainment/arts/index.ssf/2008/07/40_years_of_hair.html "40 years of 'Hair'"].

Retrieved on July 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the scene prompted threats of censorship and even violent reactions in some places.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; It also became fodder for pop-cultural jokes. [[Groucho Marx]] quipped, "I was gonna go see it, and then I called up the theater. ... They said the tickets were $11 apiece. I told them I'd call back, went into my bathroom, took off all my clothes, and looked at myself in the full-length mirror. Then I called the theater and said, 'Forget it.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, Charlotte. "Playboy Interview: Groucho Marx", ''[[Playboy]]'', March 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

The nudity was optional for the performers. The French cast was "the nudest" of the foreign groups, while the London cast "found nudity the hardest to achieve".&lt;ref name=lemon69/&gt; The Swedish cast was reluctant to disrobe, but in [[Copenhagen]], the tribe thought the nudity too tame and decided to walk naked up and down the aisle during the show's prelude.&lt;ref name=Horn103/&gt; In some early performances, the Germans played their scene behind a big sheet labeled "CENSORED".&lt;ref name=Horn103/&gt;&lt;ref name=lemon69/&gt; Original Broadway cast member Natalie Mosco said, "I was dead set against the nude scene at first, but I remembered my acting teacher having said that part of acting is being private in public.

== Music ==
[[File:Piece of work.png|thumb|right|In these two measures of "What a Piece of Work Is Man", the red notes indicate a weak syllable on a strong beat.]]
After studying the music of the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] at [[Cape Town University]],&lt;ref name=Applause/&gt; MacDermot incorporated African rhythms into the score of ''Hair''.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;  He listened to "what [the Bantu] called quaylas&lt;!-- It is spelled "quaylas" in the quotation, and the spelling is used consistently below. --&gt; ... [which have a] very characteristic beat, very similar to rock.  Much deeper though. ... ''Hair'' is very African – a lot of [the] rhythms, not the tunes so much."&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; [[Kwela|Quaylas]] stress beats on unexpected syllables, and this influence can be heard in songs like "What a Piece of Work Is Man" and "Ain't Got No Grass".&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;  MacDermot said, "My idea was to make a total funk show. They said they wanted rock &amp; roll – but to me that translated to 'funk.'"&lt;ref name=funk&gt;Alapatt, Eothen; Galt MacDermot.

I like to think they're all a little different."&lt;ref name=prog2009/&gt;  As such, the music in ''Hair'' runs the gamut of rock: from the [[rockabilly]] sensibilities of "Don't Put it Down" to the [[folk rock]] rhythms of "Frank Mills" and "What a Piece of Work is Man".  "[[Easy to Be Hard]]" is pure [[rhythm and blues]], and [[protest song|protest rock]] anthems abound: "Ain't Got No" and "The Flesh Failures".  The [[acid rock]] of "Walking in Space" and "Aquarius" are balanced by the mainstream pop of "Good Morning Starshine".&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  Scott Miller ties the music of ''Hair'' to the hippies' political themes: "The hippies&amp;nbsp;... were determined to create art of the people and their chosen art form, rock/folk music was by its definition, populist.&amp;nbsp;... [T]he hippies' music was often very angry, its anger directed at those who would prostitute the Constitution, who would sell America out, who would betray what America stood for; in other words, directed at their parents and the government."&lt;ref name=Applause/&gt;  Theatre historian [[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|John Kenrick]] explains the application of rock music to the medium of the stage:

{{quote|text=The same hard rock sound that had conquered the world of popular music made its way to the musical stage with two simultaneous hits&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Your Own Thing]]'' [and] ''Hair''.&amp;nbsp;... This explosion of revolutionary proclamations, profanity and hard rock shook the musical theatre to its roots.&amp;nbsp;... Most people in the theatre business were unwilling to look on ''Hair'' as anything more than a noisy accident.  Tony voters tried to ignore ''Hair's'' importance, shutting it out from any honors.  However, some now insisted it was time for a change.

=== Recordings ===
The [[Hair (Original Off-Broadway Cast Recording)|first recording of ''Hair'']] was made in 1967 featuring the off-Broadway cast. The [[Hair (Original Broadway Cast Recording)|original Broadway cast recording]] received a Grammy Award in 1969 for [[Best Score from an Original Cast Show Album]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/grammy-awards-1969-243.html "Grammy Awards 1969"], AwardsandShows.com, accessed March 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and sold nearly 3&amp;nbsp;million copies in the U.S. by December 1969.&lt;ref name=Hairzapoppin/&gt; It charted at No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200]], the last Broadway cast album to do so (as of 2016).

Its exotic orange-and-green cover art imprinted itself instantly and indelibly on the psyche.&amp;nbsp;... [It] became a pop-rock classic that, like all good pop, has an appeal that transcends particular tastes for genre or period."&lt;ref name=isherwooda/&gt;  The 1993 London revival cast album contains new music that has been incorporated into the standard rental version.&lt;ref name=Applause/&gt;

[[RCA Victor]] also released ''DisinHAIRited'' (RCA Victor LSO-1163): an album of songs that had been written for the show, but saw varying amounts of stage time.  Some of the songs were cut between the Public and Broadway, some had been left off the original cast album due to space, and a few were never performed onstage.&lt;ref name=Miller70/&gt;

== Critical reception ==
Reception to ''Hair'' upon its Broadway premiere was, with exceptions, overwhelmingly positive.  Clive Barnes wrote in the ''New York Times'': "What is so likable about ''Hair''&amp;nbsp;... ?  I think it is simply that it is so likable.  So new, so fresh, and so unassuming, even in its pretensions."&lt;ref name=barnes/&gt;  John J. O'Connor of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' said the show was "exuberantly defiant and the production explodes into every nook and cranny of the Biltmore Theater".&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, John (May 1, 1968).

Television reviews were even more enthusiastic.

A reviewer from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', on the other hand, called the show "loony" and "without a story, form, music, dancing, beauty or artistry.&amp;nbsp;... It's impossible to tell whether [the cast has] talent.  Maybe talent is irrelevant in this new kind of show business."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelbutler.com/hair/holding/articles/HairArticles/Variety5-1-68.html Broadway Review].

''Time''. May 10, 1968. Retrieved on April 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews were mixed when ''Hair'' opened in London.  Irving Wardle in ''[[The Times]]'' wrote, "Its honesty and passion give it the quality of a true theatrical celebration – the joyous sound of a group of people telling the world exactly what they feel." In the ''[[Financial Times]]'', B. A. Young agreed that ''Hair'' was "not only a wildly enjoyable evening, but a thoroughly moral one."  However, in his final review before retiring after 48 years, 78-year-old W. A. Darlington of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote that he had "tried hard", but found the evening "a complete bore&amp;nbsp;– noisy, ugly and quite desperately funny".&lt;ref name=london/&gt;

Acknowledging the show's critics, Scott Miller wrote in 2001 that "some people can't see past the appearance of chaos and randomness to the brilliant construction and sophisticated imagery underneath."&lt;ref name=Applause/&gt;  Miller notes, "Not only did many of the lyrics not rhyme, but many of the songs didn't really have endings, just a slowing down and stopping, so the audience didn't know when to applaud.&amp;nbsp;... The show rejected every convention of Broadway, of traditional theatre in general, and of the American musical in specific.  And it was brilliant."&lt;ref name=Applause/&gt;

'''Excerpts from the title song, "Hair"'''

I let it fly in the breeze and get caught in the trees,&lt;br /&gt;
Give a home to the fleas in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;
A home for fleas, a hive for bees&lt;br /&gt;
A nest for birds, there ain't no words &lt;br /&gt;
For the beauty, the splendor, the wonder of my Hair. ...

Flow it, show it, long as God can grow it, my hair. ... &lt;br /&gt;
Oh say, can you see my eyes?  If you can&lt;br /&gt;
Then my hair's too short. ...

They'll be ga ga at the Go Go when they see me in my toga,&lt;br /&gt;
My toga made of blond, brilliantined, biblical hair.&lt;br /&gt;
My hair like Jesus wore it,&lt;br /&gt;
Hallelujah, I adore it. ...

{{quote|Having moved indoors to Broadway from the Delacorte Theater ... the young cast members ... show no signs of becoming domesticated.  On the contrary, they're tearing down the house. ... This emotionally rich revival ... delivers what Broadway otherwise hasn't felt this season: the intense, unadulterated joy and anguish of that bi-polar state called youth. ...

[Paulus finds] depths of character and feeling in [the 1968 show about kids] frightened of how the future is going to change them and of not knowing what comes next. ...  Every single ensemble member emerges as an individual. ...  After the show I couldn't stop thinking about what would happen to [the characters].  Mr. MacDermot's music, which always had more pop than acid, holds up beautifully, given infectious life by the onstage band and the flavorfully blended voices of the cast.&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben.

In the 1990s, [[Evan Dando]]'s group [[The Lemonheads]] recorded "Frank Mills" for their 1992 album ''[[It's a Shame About Ray]]'', and [[Run DMC]] sampled "Where Do I Go" for their 1993 single "Down With the King" which went to {{Numero|1}} on the ''Billboard'' rap charts and reached the top 25 in the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.galtmacdermot.com/works.htm |title=Galt MacDermot, Works |accessdate=April 15, 2008 |publisher=galtmacdermot.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925091838/http://www.galtmacdermot.com/works.htm |archivedate=September 25, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r168550|pure_url=yes}} |title=Down with the King, Charts and Awards, Billboard Singles |accessdate=April 15, 2008 |publisher=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004 "Aquarius", [[Hair (film)|from the 1979 film version]], was honored at number&amp;nbsp;33 on [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Songs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p50073|pure_url=yes}} |title= The 5th Dimension, Charts &amp; Awards |accessdate=April 11, 2008 |work=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Songs from the musical have been featured in films and television episodes.  For example, in the 2005 film ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', the character [[Willy Wonka]] welcomed the children with lyrics from "Good Morning Starshine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Johnny Depp]] ([[Willy Wonka]]), [[Tim Burton]] (Director) |date= July 10, 2005 |title= Charlie and the Chocolate Factory |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367594/ |medium= Motion picture |publisher= Warner Bros. |accessdate= April 11, 2008 |quote= Willy Wonka: Good morning, starshine ... the earth says hello!}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Aquarius" was performed in the final episode of ''[[Laverne and Shirley]]'' in 1983, where the character Carmine moves to New York City to become an actor, and auditions for ''Hair''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/laverne-and-shirley-1983/here-today-hair-tomorrow/episode/8826/recap.html?tag=episode_recap;recap "Here Today, ''Hair'' Tomorrow Episode Recap"], Season 8, Episode 22, TV.com, accessed October 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  "Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In" was also performed in the final scene in the film ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Judd Apatow]] (Director and writer), [[Steve Carell]] (Writer) |date= August 11, 2005 |title= The 40 Year Old Virgin |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405422/soundtrack |medium= Motion picture |publisher= Universal Pictures |accessdate= April 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Three Dog Night's recording of "Easy to Be Hard" was featured in the first part of David Fincher's film [[Zodiac (film)|''Zodiac'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= [[David Fincher]] (Director) |date= March 2, 2007 |title= Zodiac  |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443706/soundtrack |medium= Motion picture |publisher= Paramount Pictures |accessdate= April 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode "[[The Springfield Files]]", the townspeople, [[Leonard Nimoy]], [[Chewbacca]], [[Dana Scully]] and [[Fox Mulder]] all sing "Good Morning Starshine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Springfield Files |episodelink=The Springfield Files |url= |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits= [[Reid Harrison]] (Writer), [[Steven Dean Moore]] (Director) |network=FOX |airdate=1997-01-12 |season=8 |number=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The episode "[[Hairography]]" of the show ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' includes a much-criticized mash-up of the songs "Hair" and "[[Crazy in Love (Beyoncé Knowles song)|Crazy in Love]]" by [[Beyoncé]].&lt;ref&gt;Flandez, Raymund.

=== Legacy ===
''Hair'' was Broadway's first&amp;nbsp;[[concept musical]], a form that dominated the musical theatre of the seventies,&lt;ref name=horn127&gt;Horn, pp. 127–29&lt;/ref&gt; including shows like ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'', ''[[Follies]]'', ''[[Pacific Overtures]]'' and ''[[A Chorus Line]]''.&lt;ref name=horn127/&gt;  While the development of the concept musical was an unexpected consequence of ''Hair'''s tenure on Broadway, the expected rock music revolution on Broadway turned out to be less than complete.&lt;ref name=horn127/&gt;

MacDermot followed ''Hair'' with three successive rock scores: ''Two Gentlemen of Verona'' (1971); ''[[Dude (musical)|Dude]]'' (1972), a second collaboration with Ragni; and ''[[Via Galactica]]'' (1972).  While ''Two Gentlemen of Verona'' found receptive audiences and a Tony for Best Musical, ''Dude'' failed after just sixteen&amp;nbsp;performances, and ''Via Galactica'' flopped after a month.&lt;ref name=horn131&gt;Horn, pp. 131–32&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Horn, these and other such "failures may have been the result of producers simply relying on the label 'rock musical' to attract audiences without regard to the quality of the material presented."&lt;ref name=horn131/&gt; ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (1970) and ''[[Godspell]]'' (1971) were two religiously themed successes of the genre.  ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' (1971) reverted to the rock sounds of the 1950s, and black-themed musicals like ''[[The Wiz]]'' (1975) were heavily influenced by gospel, [[R&amp;B]] and [[soul music]].  By the late 1970s, the genre had played itself out.&lt;ref name=horn131/&gt;  Except for a few outposts of rock, like ''[[Dreamgirls (musical)|Dreamgirls]]'' (1981) and ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' (1982), audience tastes in the 1980s turned to [[wikt:megamusical|megamusicals]] with pop scores, like ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' (1985) and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1986).&lt;ref&gt;Wollman, pp. 121–123&lt;/ref&gt;  Some later rock musicals, such as ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' (1996) and ''[[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]]'' (2006), as well as [[jukebox musicals]] featuring rock music, like ''[[We Will Rock You (musical)|We Will Rock You]]'' (2002) and ''[[Rock of Ages (musical)|Rock of Ages]]'' (2009), have found success.  But the rock musical did not quickly come to dominate the musical theatre stage after ''Hair''.  Critic [[Clive Barnes (critic)|Clive Barnes]] commented, "There really weren't any rock musicals.  No major rock musician ever did a rock score for Broadway. ...  You might think of the musical ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]'', but it was never conceived as a Broadway show. ...  And one can see why.  There's so much more money in records and rock concerts.  I mean, why bother going through the pain of a musical which may close in Philadelphia?"&lt;ref name=horn131/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Subsequent to Barnes' comment, ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]'' began performances in 2010, with a rock score by [[Bono]], but the musical suffered a series of mishaps, record expenses and tepid reviews.  See, e.g., Pennacchio, George. [http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/hollywood_wrap&amp;id=8191203 "''Spider-Man'' musical opens: What critics said"]. ABClocal-KABC, June 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, ''Hair'' had a profound effect not only on what was acceptable on Broadway, but as part of the very social movements that it celebrated.  For example, in 1970, Butler, Castelli and the various ''Hair'' casts contributed to fundraising for the World Youth Assembly, a United Nations–sponsored organization formed in connection with the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the United Nations.&lt;ref name=Teltsch1&gt;Teltsch, Kathleen. [http://www.orlok.com/hair/holding/articles/HairArticles/NYT5-19-70.html "Youth Assembly Finds an Angel on Broadway"], ''The New York Times'', May 19, 1970. Retrieved on November 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  The Assembly enabled 750 young representatives from around the world to meet in New York in July 1970 to discuss social issues.&lt;ref name=UNrelease&gt;[http://www.orlok.com/hair/holding/photographs/hair/wyainsert.html "World Youth Assembly Fund"]. Press release, June 1970, accessed April 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dCkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Racusin Keys Trade Youth Drive of UN"]. ''Billboard'', June 6, 1970, accessed April 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  For about a week, cast members worldwide collected donations at every show for the fund.  ''Hair'' raised around $250,000 and ended up being the principal financier of the Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, pp. 84–85&lt;/ref&gt;  Tribe members and ''Hair'' crews also contributed a day's pay, and Butler contributed a day's profits from these productions.&lt;ref name=Teltsch1/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNrelease/&gt;  Moreover, as [[Ellen Stewart]], La MaMa's founder, noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Hair'' came with blue jeans, comfortable clothing, colors, beautiful colors, sounds, movement. ...  And you can go to AT&amp;T and see a secretary today, and she's got on blue jeans. ... You can go anywhere you want, and what ''Hair'' did, it is still doing ''twenty&amp;nbsp;years later''. ... A kind of emancipation, a spiritual emancipation that came from [O'Horgan's] staging. ... ''Hair'' until this date has influenced every single thing that you see on Broadway, off-Broadway, off-off-Broadway, anywhere in the world, you will see elements of the experimental techniques that ''Hair'' brought not just to Broadway, but to the entire world.&lt;ref&gt;Horn, pp. 137–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''history of feminism''' comprises the narratives ([[chronology|chronological]] or thematic) of the [[Feminist movement|movements]] and [[Feminist theory|ideologies]] which have aimed at [[Feminism and equality|equal]] [[Women's rights|rights for women]]. While [[feminism| feminists]] around the world have differed in causes, goals, and intentions depending on time, [[culture]], and country, most [[Western culture | Western]] feminist historians assert that all [[social movement | movements]] that work to obtain [[women's rights]] should be considered{{by whom?|date=September 2018}} [[feminist movement]]s, even when they did not (or do not) apply the term to themselves.&lt;ref name="Walters2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinnaird" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Witt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen01101999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Woolf1989" /&gt; Some other historians limit the term "feminist" to the [[modern feminism | modern feminist movement]] and its progeny, and use the label "[[protofeminist]]" to describe earlier movements.&lt;ref name="Botting" /&gt;

Modern Western feminist history is conventionally split into three time periods, or "waves", each with slightly different aims based on prior progress:&lt;ref name="Humm"&gt;{{citation | last = Humm | first = Maggie | contribution = wave (definition) | editor-last = Humm | editor-first = Maggie | title = The dictionary of feminist theory | page = 251 | publisher = Ohio State University Press | location = Columbus | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780814205075 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker1992"&gt;{{cite magazine | last1 = Rebecca | first1 = Walker | authorlink1 = Rebecca Walker | editor-last= | editor-first = | editor-link=/February | title = Becoming the Third Wave|magazine= [[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]] | issue = | pages = 39–41 | location = New York | publisher = Liberty Media for Women | issn = 0047-8318 | oclc = 194419734 |date= January 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[First-wave feminism]] of the 19th and early 20th centuries focused on overturning legal inequalities, particularly addressing issues of [[women's suffrage]]
* [[Second-wave feminism]] (1960s–1980s) broadened debate to include [[Culture| cultural]] inequalities, [[Gender role| gender norms]], and the role of women in [[society]]
* [[Third-wave feminism]] (1990s–2000s) refers to diverse strains of feminist activity, seen{{by whom?|date=September 2018}} both as a continuation of the second wave and as a response to its perceived failures&lt;ref name="Suffragettes to Grrls"&gt;Krolokke, Charlotte and Anne Scott Sorensen, "From Suffragettes to Grrls" in ''Gender Communication Theories and Analyses: From Silence to Performance'' (Sage, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the "waves" construct has been commonly used to describe the history of feminism, the concept has also been criticized{{by whom?|date=September 2018}} for ignoring and erasing the history between the "waves", by choosing to focus solely on a few famous figures and on popular events.&lt;ref name='Feminism in "Waves": Useful or Not?'&gt;

People and activists who discuss or advance women's equality prior to the existence of the [[feminist movement]] are sometimes labeled as ''protofeminist''.&lt;ref name="Botting"/&gt; Some scholars criticize this term because they believe it diminishes the importance of earlier contributions or that feminism does not have a single, linear history as implied by terms such as ''protofeminist'' or ''postfeminist''.&lt;ref name="Allen01101999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cott name"&gt;Cott, Nancy F.

Around 24 centuries ago,&lt;ref&gt;''The Columbia Encyclopedia'' (Columbia Univ.

Italian-French writer [[Christine de Pizan]] (1364 – c. 1430), the author of ''[[The Book of the City of Ladies]]'' and ''Epître au Dieu d'Amour'' (''Epistle to the God of Love'') is cited by [[Simone de Beauvoir]] as the first woman to denounce [[misogyny]] and write about the relation of the sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=de Beauvoir, Simone|title=The Second Sex|year=1989|first=English translation 1953|publisher=Vintage Books|page=105|isbn=0-679-72451-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early feminist writers include [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] and [[Modesta di Pozzo di Forzi]], who worked in the 16th century,&lt;ref name="Schneir-1994"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Schneir, Miram|title=Feminism: The Essential Historical Writings|year=1994|first=1972|publisher=Vintage Books|page=xiv|isbn=0-679-75381-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 17th-century writers [[Hannah Woolley]] in England,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/heritage_floor/hannah_woolley.php|title=Hannah Woolley b. 1623, England; d. c. 1675, England |date=March 20, 2007|work=Dinner Party Database of notable women|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|accessdate=2009-09-22}}

One of the most important 17th-century feminist writers in the English language was [[Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne]].&lt;ref&gt;[Kegl, Rosemary. “'The World I Have Made': Margaret Cavendish, feminism and the Blazing World", in Valerie Traub, M.

== {{Anchor|18th century}} 18th century: the Age of Enlightenment ==
The [[Age of Enlightenment]] was characterized by secular intellectual reasoning and a flowering of philosophical writing. Many Enlightenment philosophers defended the rights of women, including [[Jeremy Bentham]] (1781), [[Marquis de Condorcet]] (1790), and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1792).&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, Claire. ''The Life and Death of Mary Wollstonecraft''. 144–155. Rev. ed. 1974. New York: Penguin, 1992. {{ISBN|0-14-016761-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important writers of the time that expressed feminist views included [[Abigail Adams]], [[Catharine Macaulay]],{{Sfn|Walters|2005|p=30}} and [[Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht]].

=== Jeremy Bentham ===
The English [[utilitarian]] and [[classical liberal]] philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] said that it was the placing of women in a legally inferior position that made him choose the career of a reformist at the age of eleven. Bentham spoke for complete equality between sexes including the rights to vote and to participate in government. He opposed the asymmetrical sexual moral standards between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Miriam Williford, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2709019 Bentham on the rights of Women]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'' (1781), Bentham strongly condemned many countries' common practice to deny women's rights due to allegedly inferior minds.&lt;ref name=mw&gt;Miriam Williford, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2709019 Bentham on the rights of Women], ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham gave many examples of able female [[regent]]s.

=== Marquis de Condorcet ===
[[Nicolas de Condorcet]] was a mathematician, classical liberal politician, leading [[French Revolution]]ary, republican, and [[Voltaire]]an [[anti-clerical]]ist. He was also a fierce defender of [[human rights]], including the equality of women and the [[Abolitionism in France|abolition of slavery]], unusual for the 1780s. He advocated for [[women's suffrage]] in the new government in 1790 with ''De l'admission des femmes au droit de cité'' (''For the Admission to the Rights of Citizenship For Women'') and an article for ''Journal de la Société de 1789''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1013&amp;Itemid=99999999 Marie-Jean-Antoine-Nicolas Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet, On the Admission of Women to the Rights of Citizenship] (1790), The First Essay on the Political Rights of Women.

=== Olympe de Gouges and ''A Declaration'' ===
{{Main|Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen|Olympe de Gouges}}Following de Condorcet's repeated, yet failed, appeals to the National Assembly in 1789 and 1790, Olympe de Gouges (in association with the Society of the Friends of Truth) authored and published the ''Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen'' in 1791. This was another plea for the French Revolutionary government to recognize the natural and political rights of women.&lt;ref&gt;"LES DROITS DE LA FEMME - Olympe de Gouges". ''www.olympedegouges.eu''. Retrieved 2015-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt; De Gouges wrote the ''Declaration'' in the prose of the ''Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen'', almost mimicking the failure of men to include more than a half of the French population in ''egalité''. Even though,the ''Declaration'' did not immediately accomplish its goals, it did set a precedent for a manner in which feminists could satirize their governments for their failures in equality, seen in documents such as ''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' and ''A Declaration of Sentiments''.&lt;ref&gt;Carla Hesse, ''The Other Enlightenment: How French Women Became Modern''(2001), 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wollstonecraft and ''A Vindication'' ===
{{Main|A Vindication of the Rights of Woman|Mary Wollstonecraft}}
[[File:Wollstonecraft-right-of-woman.jpg|thumb|right|First edition print of ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'']]
Perhaps the most cited feminist writer of the time was [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], often characterized as the first feminist philosopher. ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) is one of the first works that can unambiguously be called feminist, although by modern standards her comparison of women to the nobility, the elite of society (coddled, fragile, and in danger of intellectual and moral sloth) may at first seem dated as a feminist argument. Wollstonecraft identified the education and upbringing of women as creating their limited expectations based on a self-image dictated by the typically male perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Meena. Women in Romanticism: Mary Wollstonecraft, Dorothy Wordsworth, and Mary Shelley. NY: Rowman and Littlefield (1989), 40&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her perceived inconsistencies (Miriam Brody referred to the "Two Wollstonecrafts")&lt;ref name="Brody" /&gt; reflective of problems that had no easy answers, this book remains a foundation stone of feminist thought.&lt;ref name="Walters2005"/&gt;

Wollstonecraft believed that both genders contributed to inequality. She took women's considerable power over men for granted, and determined that both would require education to ensure the necessary changes in social attitudes. Given her humble origins and scant education, her personal achievements speak to her own determination. Wollstonecraft attracted the mockery of [[Samuel Johnson]], who described her and her ilk as "Amazons of the pen". Based on his relationship with [[Hester Thrale]],&lt;ref&gt;Prose, Francine. ''The Lives of the Muses''. New York: Harper Collins, 2002, pp. 29-56.&lt;/ref&gt; he complained of women's encroachment onto a male territory of writing, and not their intelligence or education. For many commentators, Wollstonecraft represents the first codification of [[equality feminism]], or a refusal of the [[feminine]] role in society.&lt;ref&gt;Mandell, Laura. "The first woman (psycho)analysts; or, the friends of feminist history". ''Modern Language Quarterly'' 2004 March 65(1): 69-92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the centrality of "equality" and "difference" feminism and their mutual metamorphosis, see [[Londa Schiebinger|Schiebinger, Londa]]: ''Has feminism changed science?''

=== The feminine ideal ===
19th-century feminists reacted to cultural inequities including the pernicious, widespread acceptance of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] image of women's "proper" role and "sphere."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ideals of Womanhood in Victorian Britain|author=Abrams, Lynn|year=2001|publisher=BBC}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Victorian ideal created a dichotomy of "separate spheres" for men and women that was very clearly defined in theory, though not always in reality. In this ideology, men were to occupy the public sphere (the space of wage labor and politics) and women the private sphere (the space of home and children.) This "[[ideal of feminine beauty|feminine ideal]]," also called "[[Cult of Domesticity|The Cult of Domesticity]]," was typified in Victorian [[conduct book]]s such as ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management]]'' and [[Sarah Stickney Ellis]]'s books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Blair, Emily|title=Virginia Woolf and the Nineteenth-Century Domestic Novel|year=2008|publisher=State University of New York Press|page=33|isbn=0-7914-7120-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Angel in the House]]'' (1854) and ''El ángel del hogar'', bestsellers by [[Coventry Patmore]] and Maria del Pilar Sinués de Marco, came to symbolize the Victorian feminine ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Jagoe, Elizabeth|title=Ambiguous angels: gender in the novels of Galdós|year=1994|publisher=University of California Press|page=14|isbn=0-520-08356-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Queen Victoria]] herself disparaged the concept of feminism, which she described in private letters as the "mad, wicked folly of 'Woman's Rights'&lt;nowiki/&gt;''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide, 1866–1928 |last=Crawford |first=Elizabeth |year=2013 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn= 9781135434021 |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a2EK9P7-ZMsC&amp;printsec=frontcover }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Toward the Light of Liberty |last=Grayling |first=A.

=== Marion Reid and Caroline Norton ===
At the outset of the 19th century, the dissenting feminist voices had little to no social influence.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} There was little sign of change in the political or social order, nor any evidence of a recognizable women's movement. Collective concerns began to coalesce by the end of the century, paralleling the emergence of a stiffer social model and code of conduct that [[Marion Kirkland Reid|Marion Reid]] described as confining and repressive for women.&lt;ref name="Walters2005"/&gt; While the increased emphasis on feminine virtue partly stirred the call for a woman's movement, the tensions that this role caused for women plagued many early-19th-century feminists with doubt and worry, and fueled opposing views.&lt;!-- sort of cite, have not read this article--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Heilmann | first1 = Ann | last2 = Sanders | first2 = Valerie | title = The rebel, the lady and the ‘anti’: Femininity, anti-feminism, and the Victorian woman writer | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]], special issue: Feminisms and Print Culture, 1830-1930s, in the Digital Age | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 289–300 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.wsif.2006.04.008 | date = May–June 2006 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wsif.2006.04.008 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caroline Norton]] advocated for changes in British law.

While many women including Norton were wary of organized movements,&lt;!-- only from Google snippet --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Bradshaw, David J.  |author2=Ozment, Suzanne|title=The voice of toil: nineteenth-century British writings about work|page=393|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=0-8214-1293-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; their actions and words often motivated and inspired such movements.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Among these was [[Florence Nightingale]], whose conviction that women had all the potential of men but none of the opportunities&lt;ref&gt;Nightingale, Florence.

Due to varying ideologies, feminists were not always supportive of each other's efforts. [[Harriet Martineau]] and others dismissed Wollstonecraft's&lt;ref name=Deerbrook /&gt; contributions as dangerous, and deplored Norton's&lt;ref name=Deerbrook&gt;{{Cite book|author=Sanders, Valerie (ed.)|title=Introduction to ''Deerbrook''|page=xvii–xix|publisher=Penguin Classics|year=2005|isbn=0-14-143939-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; candidness, but seized on the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] campaign that Martineau had witnessed in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Martineau, Harriet|title=The martyr age of the United States of America: with an appeal on behalf of the Oberlin Institute in Aid of the Abolition of Slavery|publisher=Finlay and Charlton|year=1840}}&lt;/ref&gt; as one that should logically be applied to women.

[[File:FrancesPowerCobb.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Frances Power Cobbe|Frances Cobbe]]]]
[[Anna Wheeler (author)|Anna Wheeler]] was influenced by [[Saint Simonian]] socialists while working in France. She advocated for suffrage and attracted the attention of [[Benjamin Disraeli]], the Conservative leader, as a dangerous radical on a par with [[Jeremy Bentham]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} She would later inspire early socialist and feminist advocate [[William Thompson (philosopher)|William Thompson]],&lt;ref&gt;Dooley, Dolores, ''Equality in Community: Sexual Equality in the Writings of William Thompson and Anna Doyle Wheeler'' (Cork University Press), 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote the first work published in English to advocate full equality of rights for women, the 1825 "Appeal of One Half of the Human Race".&lt;ref&gt;Dooley, Dolores (ed.), ''William Thompson: Appeal of One Half of the Human Race'' (Cork University Press), 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminists of previous centuries charged women's exclusion from education as the central cause for their domestic relegation and denial of social advancement, and women's 19th-century education was no better.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} [[Frances Power Cobbe]], among others, called for education reform, an issue that gained attention alongside marital and property rights, and domestic violence.

Female journalists like Martineau and Cobbe in Britain, and [[Margaret Fuller]] in America, were achieving journalistic employment, which placed them in a position to influence other women. Cobbe would refer to "[[Women's rights|Woman's Rights]]" not just in the abstract, but as an identifiable cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roy|first=Sajal|year=|title=ENTERING TOWARDS NEW VISION: FEMINISM, A HISTORICAL PATHWAY OF KNOWLEDGE-WORLD|url=https://www.academia.edu/488941/ENTERING_TOWARDS_NEW_VISION_FEMINISM_A_HISTORICAL_PATHWAY_OF_KNOWLEDGE-WORLD|journal=Entering Towards New Vision: Feminism, A Historical Pathway of Knowledge-World.|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ladies of Langham Place ===
{{Details|English Woman's Journal}}
[[Barbara Bodichon|Barbara Leigh Smith]] and her friends met regularly during the 1850s in London's Langham Place to discuss the united women's voice necessary for achieving reform. These "Ladies of Langham Place" included [[Bessie Rayner Parkes]] and [[Anna Jameson]]. They focused on education, employment, and marital law. One of their causes became the Married Women's Property Committee of 1855.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} They collected thousands of signatures for legislative reform petitions, some of which were successful. Smith had also attended the 1848 [[Seneca Falls Convention]] in America.&lt;ref name=Ockerbloom /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bodichon, Barbara Leigh Smith and Lacey, Candida Ann ed. 2001 5"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bodichon, Barbara Leigh Smith and Lacey, Candida Ann (ed.)|title=Women's Source Library: Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon and the Langham Place Group|volume=3|page=5|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=0-415-25688-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith and Parkes, together and apart, wrote many articles on education and employment opportunities. In the same year as Norton, Smith summarized the legal framework for injustice in her 1854 ''A Brief Summary of the Laws of England concerning Women''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/vwwp/bodichon/brieflaw.html Full text from Victorian Women's Project, Indiana University] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110063849/http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/vwwp/bodichon/brieflaw.html |date=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was able to reach large numbers of women via her role in the ''[[English Women's Journal]]''. The response to this journal led to their creation of the [[Society for Promoting the Employment of Women]] (SPEW). Smith's Married Women's Property committee collected 26,000 signatures to change the law{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=what law?}} for all women, including those unmarried.&lt;ref name=Ockerbloom /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bodichon, Barbara Leigh Smith and Lacey, Candida Ann ed. 2001 5"/&gt;

[[Harriet Taylor]] published her ''Enfranchisement'' in 1851, and wrote about the inequities of family law. In 1853, she married [[John Stuart Mill]], and provided him with much of the subject material for ''[[The Subjection of Women]]''.

[[Emily Davies]] also encountered the Langham group, and with [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson|Elizabeth Garrett]] created SPEW branches outside London.

=== Educational reform ===
{{Main|Female education}}
The interrelated barriers to education and employment formed the backbone of 19th-century feminist reform efforts, for instance, as described by Harriet Martineau in her 1859 ''[[Chambers's Edinburgh Journal|Edinburgh Journal]]'' article, "Female Industry".{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=clarify the use of mentioning this}} These barriers did not change in conjunction with the economy. Martineau, however, remained a moderate, for practical reasons, and unlike Cobbe, did not support the emerging call for the vote.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The education reform efforts of women like Davies and the Langham group slowly made inroads. [[Queen's College, London|Queen's College]] (1848) and [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College]] (1849) in London began to offer some education to women from 1848. By 1862, Davies established a committee to persuade the universities to allow women to sit for the recently established Local Examinations,{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=what is this?}} and achieved partial success in 1865. She published ''The Higher Education of Women'' a year later. Davies and Leigh Smith founded the first higher educational institution for women and enrolled five students. The school later became [[Girton College, Cambridge]] in 1869, [[Newnham College, Cambridge]] in 1871, and [[Lady Margaret Hall]] at Oxford in 1879. Bedford began to award degrees the previous year. Despite these measurable advances, few could take advantage of them and life for female students was still difficult.{{Clarify|date=October 2009|reason=needs more examples}}

In the 1883 [[Ilbert Bill|Ilbert Bill controversy]], a [[British India]] bill that proposed Indian judicial jurisdiction to try British criminals, Bengali women in support of the bill responded by claiming that they were more educated than the English women opposed to the bill, and noted that more [[Indian subcontinent|Indian]] women had degrees than British women at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist Postcolonial Theory: A Reader|last=Reina Lewis|first=Sara Mills|publisher=[[Taylor and Francis|Taylor &amp; Francis]]|year=2003|isbn=0-415-94275-6|page=453|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=tie this in to the surrounding details—why bring this up?}}

As part of the continuing dialogue between British and American feminists, [[Elizabeth Blackwell (doctor)|Elizabeth Blackwell]], one of the first American women to graduate in medicine (1849), lectured in Britain with Langham support. She eventually took her degree in France. Garrett's very successful 1870 campaign to run for London School Board office is another example of a how a small band of very determined women were beginning to reach positions of influence at the local government level.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

=== Women's campaigns ===
[[File:Josephine Butler - portrait.jpg|thumb|Josephine Butler]]
Campaigns gave women opportunities to test their new political skills and to conjoin disparate social reform groups. Their successes include the campaign for the [[Married Women's Property Act 1882|Married Women's Property Act]] (passed in 1882) and the campaign to repeal the [[Contagious Diseases Act]]s of 1864, 1866, and 1869, which united women's groups and utilitarian liberals like [[John Stuart Mill]].&lt;ref&gt;Waldron, Jeremy. Mill on Liberty and on the Contagious Diseases Acts. in, Urbinati, Nadia and Zakaras, Alex (eds), ''J. S. Mill's Political Thought: A bicentennial reassessment''. Cambridge University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, women were outraged by the inherent inequity and misogyny of the legislation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} For the first time, women in large numbers took up the rights of prostitutes. Prominent critics included Blackwell, Nightingale, Martineau, and Elizabeth Wolstenholme. Elizabeth Garrett, unlike her sister, [[Millicent Fawcett|Millicent]], did not support the campaign, though she later admitted that the campaign had done well.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

London Metropolitan University, Women's Library. Archives in London]&lt;/ref&gt; Her work demonstrated the potential power of an organized lobby group. The association successfully argued that the Acts not only demeaned prostitutes, but all women and men by promoting a blatant sexual [[double standard]]. Butler's activities resulted in the radicalization of many moderate women. The Acts were repealed in 1886.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

On a smaller scale, [[Annie Besant]] campaigned for the rights of [[London matchgirls strike of 1888|matchgirls]] (female factory workers) and against the appalling conditions under which they worked in London. Her work of publicizing the difficult conditions of the workers through interviews in bi-weekly periodicals like The Link became a method for raising public concern over social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malone|first=Carolyn|date=Spring 1999|title=Sensational Stories, Endangered Bodies: Women's Work and the New Journalism in England in the 1890s|journal=Albion: A Quarterly Journal Concerned with British Studies|volume=31|pages=49–71|jstor=4052816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminists did not recognize separate waves of feminism until the second wave was so named by journalist Martha Lear, according to [[Jennifer Baumgardner]].&lt;ref&gt;Baumgardner, Jennifer, ''F'em!: Goo Goo, Gaga, and Some Thoughts on Balls'' (Berkeley, California: Seal Press, 2011 ({{ISBN|978-1-58005-360-0}})), p.&amp;nbsp;243 (author teacher, [[The New School]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Baumgardner reports criticism by professor [[Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz]] of the division into waves&lt;ref&gt;Baumgardner, Jennifer, ''F'em!'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;244 &amp; 252.&lt;/ref&gt; and the difficulty of categorizing some feminists into specific waves,&lt;ref name="Fem-Baumgardner-p244"&gt;Baumgardner, Jennifer, ''F'em!'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;244.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the main critics of a wave are likely to be members of the prior wave who remain vital,&lt;ref name="Fem-Baumgardner-p244" /&gt; and that waves are coming faster.&lt;ref name="Fem-Baumgardner-p244" /&gt; The "waves debate" has influenced how historians and other scholars have established the chronologies of women's political activism.[https://www.cliohistory.org/click/politics-social/politics/]

=== First wave ===
{{Main|First-wave feminism|History of women in the United States}}
[[File:Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] (seated) and [[Susan B. Anthony]]]]
The 19th- and early 20th-century feminist activity in the [[English-speaking world]] that sought to win [[women's suffrage]], female education rights, better working conditions, and abolition of gender double standards is known as first-wave feminism. The term "first-wave" was coined retrospectively when the term ''[[second-wave feminism]]'' was used to describe a newer feminist movement that fought social and cultural inequalities beyond basic political inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pramila|first1=B.|title=Feminism in Indian Writing in English Fiction with Special Reference to Anita Nair, Anita Desai &amp; Bharati Mukherjee|journal=International Journal of English: Literature, Language, &amp; Skills|date=July 2016|volume=5|issue=2|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United States, feminist movement leaders campaigned for the national [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] and [[The Temperance movement in the United States|Temperance]] before championing women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book|last1=Loveday|first1=V.|title=Feminism and the Women's Rights Movement|date=August 2017|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; American first-wave feminism involved a wide range of women, some belonging to conservative Christian groups (such as [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]] and the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]]), others resembling the diversity and radicalism of much of [[second-wave feminism]] (such as Stanton, Anthony, [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]], and the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]], of which Stanton was president). First-wave feminism in the United States is considered to have ended with the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (1920), which granted white women the right to vote in the United States.

Activism for the equality of women was not limited to the United States.  In mid-nineteenth century Persia, [[Táhirih]] was active as a poet and religious reformer, and is recorded as proclaiming the equality of women at her execution.  She inspired later generations of Iranian feminists.&lt;ref&gt;Táhirih mentioned on PBS NewsHour - Mention of Táhirih as founder of Persian feminism by renowned scholar Azar Nafizi in a discussion on PBS about Shirin Ebadi, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Louise Dittmar campaigned for women's rights, in Germany, in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of 1848 Revolutions, Louise Dittmar http://www.ohio.edu/chastain/dh/ditt.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Although slightly later in time, [[Fusae Ichikawa]] was in the first wave of women's activists in her own country of Japan, campaigning for women's suffrage. [[Mary Lee (suffragette)|Mary Lee]] was active in the suffrage movement in South Australia, the first Australian colony to grant women the vote in 1894. In New Zealand, [[Kate Sheppard]] and [[Mary Ann Müller]] worked to achieve the vote for women by 1893.

In the United States, the antislavery campaign of the 1830s served as both a cause ideologically compatible with feminism and a blueprint for later feminist political organizing. Attempts to exclude women only strengthened their convictions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} [[Sarah Grimké|Sarah]] and [[Angelina Grimké]] moved rapidly from the emancipation of slaves to the emancipation of women. The most influential feminist writer of the time was the colourful journalist [[Margaret Fuller]], whose ''[[Woman in the Nineteenth Century]]'' was published in 1845. Her dispatches from Europe for the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' helped create to synchronize the [[Women's rights|women's rights movement]].

[[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Lucretia Mott]] met in 1840 while en route to London where they were shunned as women by the male leadership of the first [[World's Anti-Slavery Convention]]. In 1848, Mott and Stanton held [[Seneca Falls Convention|a woman's rights convention in Seneca Falls, New York]], where a [[Declaration of Sentiments|declaration of independence for women]] was drafted. [[Lucy Stone]] helped to organize the first [[National Women's Rights Convention]] in 1850, a much larger event at which [[Sojourner Truth]], [[Abby Kelley|Abby Kelley Foster]], and others spoke sparked [[Susan B. Anthony]] to take up the cause of women's rights. In December 1851, Sojourner Truth contributed to the feminist movement when she spoke at the Women’s Convention in Akron, Ohio. She delivered her powerful “Ain’t I a Woman” speech in an effort to promote women’s rights by demonstrating their ability to accomplish tasks that have been traditionally associated with men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/sojtruth-woman.asp|title=Internet History Sourcebooks|website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Bodichon|Barbara Leigh Smith]] met with Mott in 1858,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20051123072232/http://www.binghamton.edu/womhist/awrm/doc17b.htm Barbara Leigh Smith: ''An American Diary 1857-58'' (excerpts)]&lt;/ref&gt; strengthening the link between the [[Transatlantic relations|transatlantic]] feminist movements.

Stanton and [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]] saw [[Christian Church|the Church]] as a major obstacle to women's rights,&lt;ref&gt;Gage, Matilda Joslyn. "Woman, Church, and State", in Susan B. Anthony, Matilda Joslyn Gage, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton (eds.), ''[[History of Woman Suffrage]]''. 3 vols.

Stanton wrote "[[The Matriarchate or Mother-Age]]"&lt;ref name="stanton matriarch"&gt;Stanton, Elizabeth Cady. "The Matriarchate or Mother-Age", in Avery, Rachel Foster (ed.), ''Transactions of the National Council of Women of the United States''. Philadelphia, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gage wrote ''[[Woman, Church and State]]'', neatly inverting [[Johann Jakob Bachofen]]'s thesis and adding a unique [[epistemological]] perspective, the critique of objectivity and the perception of the subjective.&lt;ref name="stanton matriarch"/&gt;{{Technical statement|date=May 2013}}

Stanton once observed regarding assumptions of female inferiority, "The worst feature of these assumptions is that women themselves believe them".&lt;ref&gt;Stanton ''Matriachate'' op.cit. at 218.&lt;/ref&gt; However this attempt to replace [[Androcentrism|androcentric]] (male-centered) theological{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=how is this a theological attempt?}} tradition with a [[Gynocentrism|gynocentric]] (female-centered) view made little headway in a women's movement dominated by religious elements; thus she and Gage were largely ignored by subsequent generations.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Cullen.

{{Main|Women's suffrage|Timeline of women's suffrage}}
The women's right to vote, with its legislative representation, represented a paradigm shift where women would no longer be treated as second-class citizens without a voice. The women's suffrage campaign is the most deeply embedded campaign of the past 250 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leedstrinity.ac.uk/histcourse/suffrage/ Enfranchising Women: The Politics of Women's Suffrage in Europe 1789-1945.

At first, suffrage was treated as a lower priority. The French Revolution accelerated this,{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=how?}} with the assertions of Condorcet and de Gouges, and the women who led the [[The Women's March on Versailles|1789 march on Versailles]]. In 1793, the [[Society of Revolutionary Republican Women]] was founded, and originally included suffrage on its agenda before it was suppressed at the end of the year. As a gesture, this showed that issue was now part of the European political agenda.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

German women were involved in the [[Vormärz]], a prelude to the [[Revolutions of 1848|1848 revolution]]. In Italy, Clara Maffei, [[Cristina Trivulzio Belgiojoso]], and Ester Martini Currica were politically active{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=how?}} in the events leading up to 1848. In Britain, interest in suffrage emerged from the writings of Wheeler and Thompson in the 1820s, and from Reid, Taylor, and [[Anne Knight]] in the 1840s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} While New Zealand was the first sovereign state where women won the right to vote (1893), they did not win the right to stand in elections until later. The Australian State of [[South Australia]] was the first sovereign state in the world to officially grant full suffrage to women (1894).

==== The suffragettes ====
{{Main|Suffragette}}

The Langham Place ladies set up a suffrage committee at an 1866 meeting at Elizabeth Garrett's home, renamed the London Society for Women's Suffrage in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminism: a paradigm shift|last=Tandon|first=Neeru|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Disturbution|year=2008|isbn=978-81-269-0888-2|location=New Delhi, India|pages=5|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon similar committees had spread across the country, raising petitions, and working closely with John Stuart Mill. When denied outlets by establishment periodicals, feminists started their own, such as [[Lydia Becker]]'s ''[[Women's Suffrage Journal]]'' in 1870.

Other publications included [[Richard Pankhurst]]'s ''[[Englishwoman's Review]]'' (1866).{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=why is this worth mentioning?}} Tactical disputes were the biggest problem,{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=the biggest? of what?}} and the groups' memberships fluctuated.{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=why?}} Women considered whether men (like Mill) should be involved. As it went, Mill withdrew as the movement became more aggressive with each disappointment.{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=what disappointments?}} The political pressure ensured debate, but year after year the movement was defeated in Parliament.

Despite this, the women accrued political experience, which translated into slow progress at the local government level. But after years of frustration, many women became increasingly radicalized. Some refused to pay taxes, and the [[Emmeline Pankhurst|Pankhurst family]] emerged as the dominant movement influence, having also founded the [[Women's Franchise League]] in 1889, which sought local election suffrage for women.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==== International suffrage ====
{{Details|Women's suffrage#Details by country}}
The Isle of Man, a UK dependency, was the first free standing jurisdiction to grant women the vote (1881), followed by the right to vote (but not to stand) in New Zealand in 1893, where [[Kate Sheppard]]&lt;ref&gt;Sweeney, Brian (ed.), 2000, "OPTIMISTS: Kate Sheppard – Suffragist". Accessed May 23, 2006, from http://www.nzedge.com/heroes/sheppard.html.&lt;/ref&gt; had pioneered reform. Some Australian states had also granted women the vote. This included Victoria for a brief period (1863–5), South Australia (1894), and Western Australia (1899). Australian women received the vote at the Federal level in 1902, Finland in 1906, and Norway initially in 1907 (completed in 1913).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History|last=Smith|first=Bonnie G.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-19-514890-9|location=New York, NY|pages=171|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early 20th century ===
[[File:Wilhelmina Drucker IMG0020.tif|thumb|In the Netherlands, [[Wilhelmina Drucker]] (1847–1925) fought successfully for the vote and equal rights for women through political and feminist organisations she founded. In 1917–19 her goal of women's suffrage was reached.]]
In the early part of the 20th century, also known as the Edwardian era, there was a change in the way women dressed from the Victorian rigidity and complacency. Women, especially women who married a wealthy man, would often wear what we consider today, practical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/manorhouse/edwardianlife/clothes.html|title=Manor House. Edwardian Life {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Books, articles, speeches, pictures, and papers from the period show a diverse range of themes other than political reform and suffrage discussed publicly.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} In the Netherlands, for instance, the main feminist issues were educational rights, rights to medical care,&lt;ref&gt;Aletta H.

[[Emmeline Pankhurst|Pankhursts]] formed the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU) in 1903. As Emmline Pankhurst put it, they viewed votes for women no longer as "a right, but as a desperate necessity".{{Cite quote|date=May 2013}} At the state level, Australia and the United States had already granted suffrage to some women. American feminists such as [[Susan B. Anthony]] (1902) visited Britain.{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=why is this important?}} While WSPU was the best-known suffrage group,{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} it was only one of many, such as the [[Women's Freedom League]] and the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] (NUWSS) led by [[Millicent Garrett Fawcett]].{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=what these groups did is more important than what they established—what do reliable sources say about the importance of the multitude of suffrage groups?}} WSPU was largely a family affair,{{Clarify|date=May 2013}} although externally financed. [[Christabel Pankhurst]] became the dominant figure and gathered friends such as [[Annie Kenney]], [[Flora Drummond]], [[Teresa Billington]], [[Ethel Smyth]], [[Grace Roe]], and Norah Dacre Fox (later known as [[Norah Elam]]) around her. Veterans such as Elizabeth Garrett also joined.

In 1906, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' first labeled these women "[[suffragettes]]" as a form of ridicule, but the term was embraced by the women to describe the more militant form of suffragism visible in public marches, distinctive green, purple, and white emblems, and the [[Artists' Suffrage League]]'s dramatic graphics. The feminists learned to exploit photography and the media, and left a vivid visual record including images such as the 1914 photograph of Emmeline.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The protests slowly became more violent, and included heckling, banging on doors, smashing shop windows, and arson. [[Emily Davison]], a WSPU member, unexpectedly ran onto the track during the 1913 [[Epsom Derby]] and died under the King's horse. These tactics produced mixed results of sympathy and alienation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} As many protesters were imprisoned and [[Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913|went on hunger-strike]], the British government was left with an embarrassing situation. From these political actions, the suffragists successfully created publicity around their institutional discrimination and sexism.

==== Feminist science fiction ====
{{Main|Feminist science fiction}}
At the beginning of the 20th century, [[feminist science fiction]] emerged as a subgenre of [[science fiction]] that deals with women's roles in society. Female writers of the [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|utopian literature]] movement at the time of [[first-wave feminism]] often addressed sexism. [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]]'s ''[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]'' (1915) did so.{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=how?}} ''[[Sultana's Dream]]'' (1905) by [[Bengali science fiction|Bengali]] [[Islamic feminism|Muslim feminist]] [[Roquia Sakhawat Hussain]] depicts a gender-reversed [[purdah]] in a futuristic world.

During the 1920s, writers such as [[Clare Winger Harris]] and [[Gertrude Barrows Bennett]] published science fiction stories written from female perspectives and occasionally dealt with gender- and sexuality-based topics while popular 1920s and 30s [[pulp science fiction]] exaggerated masculinity alongside sexist portrayals of women.&lt;ref&gt;Clute, John (1995). ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction''. "Martin's Griffin", 1344.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1960s, science fiction combined [[sensationalism]] with political and technological critiques of society. With the advent of feminism, women's roles were questioned in this "subversive, mind expanding genre".&lt;ref&gt;Clute, John (1995). ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction''. "Martin's Griffin", 424.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminist science fiction]] poses questions about social issues such as how society constructs gender roles, how reproduction defines gender, and how the political power of men and women are unequal.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Some of the most notable feminist science fiction works have illustrated these themes using [[utopia]]s to explore societies where gender differences or gender power imbalances do not exist, and [[dystopia]]s to explore worlds where gender inequalities are escalated, asserting a need for feminist work to continue.&lt;ref&gt;Elyce Rae Helford, in Westfahl, Gary. ''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy'': Greenwood Press, 2005: 289-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== During the first and second world wars ====

Women entered the labor market during the [[First World War]] in unprecedented numbers, often in new sectors, and discovered the value of their work. The war also left large numbers of women bereaved and with a net loss of household income. The scores of men killed and wounded shifted the demographic composition. War also split the feminist groups, with many women opposed to the war and others involved in the [[White feather|white feather campaign]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Feminist scholars like [[Francoise Thebaud]] and [[Nancy F. Cott]] note a conservative reaction to World War I in some countries, citing a reinforcement of traditional imagery and literature that promotes motherhood. The appearance of these traits in wartime has been called the "nationalization of women".{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

In the years between the wars, feminists fought discrimination and establishment opposition.{{Clarify|date=May 2013}} In [[Virginia Woolf]]'s ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'', Woolf describes the extent of the backlash and her frustration. By now, the word "feminism" was in use, but with a negative connotation from mass media, which discouraged women from self-identifying as such.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} When [[Rebecca West]], another prominent writer, had been attacked as "a feminist", Woolf defended her. West has been remembered for her comment "I myself have never been able to find out precisely what feminism is: I only know that people call me a feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat, or a prostitute."&lt;ref&gt;West, Rebecca. "Mr. Chesterton in hysterics", in The Clarion 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, the nontraditional styles and attitudes of [[flappers]] were popular among American and British women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==== Electoral reform ====
The United Kingdom's [[Representation of the People Act 1918]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Representation of the People Act 1918 | url = http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/electionsvoting/womenvote/parliamentary-collections/collections-the-vote-and-after/representation-of-the-people-act-1918/ | website = parliament.uk | publisher = [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; gave near-universal suffrage to men, and suffrage to women over 30. The [[Representation of the People Act 1928]] extended equal suffrage to both men and women. It also shifted the socioeconomic makeup of the electorate towards the working class, favoring the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], who were more sympathetic to women's issues.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} The [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|following election]] and gave Labour the most seats in the house to date. The electoral reforms also allowed women to run for Parliament. [[Christabel Pankhurst]] narrowly failed to win a seat in 1918, and [[Constance Markievicz]] (Sinn Féin) was the first woman elected in Ireland in 1918, but as an [[Irish nationalism#Militant separatism and Irish independence|Irish nationalist]], refused to take her seat.  In 1919 and 1920, both [[Lady Astor]] and [[Margaret Wintringham]] won seats for the Conservatives and Liberals respectively by succeeding their husband's seats. Labour swept to power in 1924. Astor's proposal to form a women's party in 1929 was unsuccessful. Women gained considerable electoral experience over the next few years as a series of minority governments ensured almost annual elections. Close affiliation with Labour also proved to be a problem for the [[National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship]] (NUSEC), which had little support in the Conservative party. However, their persistence with Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] was rewarded with the passage of the [[Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

European women received the vote in [[Denmark]] and [[Iceland]] in 1915 (full in 1919), the [[Russian Republic]] in 1917, [[Austria]], [[Germany]] and [[Canada]] in 1918, many countries including the [[Netherlands]] in 1919, [[Czechoslovakia]] (today [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]]) in 1920, and [[Turkey]] and [[South Africa]] in 1930. [[France|French]] women did not receive the vote until 1945. [[Liechtenstein]] was one of the last countries, in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==== Social reform ====
The political change did not immediately change social circumstances. With the economic recession, women were the most vulnerable sector of the workforce. Some women who held jobs prior to the war were obliged to forfeit them to returning soldiers, and others were excessed. With limited franchise, the UK [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] (NUWSS) pivoted into a new organization, the [[National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship]] (NUSEC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Strand 2: Women's Suffrage Societies (2NSE Records of the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship) | url = https://twl-calm.library.lse.ac.uk/CalmView/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;id=2NSE&amp;pos=1 | website = twl-calm.library.lse.ac.uk | publisher = [[Women's Library|The Women's Library @ London School of Economics]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; which still advocated for equality in franchise, but extended its scope to examine equality in social and economic areas. Legislative reform was sought for discriminatory laws (e.g., family law and [[prostitution]]) and over the differences between ''equality'' and ''equity'', the accommodations that would allow women to overcome barriers to fulfillment (known in later years as the "equality vs. difference conundrum").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Offen | first = Karen | title = Women in the western world | journal = Journal of Women's Studies | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 145&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | doi = 10.1353/jowh.2010.0359 | date = Summer 1995 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1353/jowh.2010.0359 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eleanor Rathbone]], who became a British [[Member of Parliament]] in 1929, succeeded [[Millicent Fawcett|Millicent Garrett]] as president of NUSEC in 1919.

In America, [[Margaret Sanger]] was prosecuted for her book ''Family Limitation'' under the [[Comstock laws|Comstock Act]] in 1914, and fled to Britain until it was safe to return. Sanger's work was prosecuted in Britain. She met [[Marie Stopes]] in Britain, who was never prosecuted but regularly denounced for her promotion of birth control. In 1917, Sanger started the ''[[Birth Control Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The Margaret Sanger Papers.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, Sanger gave a lecture on birth control to the women's auxiliary of the Ku Klux Klan in Silver Lake, New Jersey, which she referred to as a "weird experience".&lt;ref&gt;Sanger, Margaret (1938).

=== 1940s ===
In most front line countries, women volunteered or were conscripted for various duties in support of the national war effort. In Britain, women were drafted and assigned to industrial jobs or to non-combat military service. The British services enrolled 460,000 women. The largest service, [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]], had a maximum of 213,000 women enrolled, many of whom served in anti-aircraft gun combat roles.&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Noakes, ''Women in the British Army: war and the gentle sex, 1907-1948'' (2006), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Ciment and Thaddeus Russell,eds. ''The Home Front Encyclopedia: United States, Britain, and Canada in World Wars I and II'' (2007), vol. 1, p. 950.&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries, including Germany and the Soviet Union, women volunteered or were conscripted. In Germany, women volunteered in the [[League of German Girls]] and assisted the Luftwaffe as anti-aircraft gunners, or as guerrilla fighters in [[Werwolf]] units behind [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] lines.&lt;ref&gt;"Der Jungmädeldienst", published February 1940, Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Soviet Union, about 820,000 women served in the military as medics, radio operators, truck drivers, snipers, combat pilots, and junior commanding officers.&lt;ref&gt;Krylova, Anna, "Soviet Women in Combat'' Cambridge University Press, Cambridge (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many American women retained their domestic chores and often added a paid job, especially one related to a war industry. Much more so than in the previous war, large numbers of women were hired for unskilled or semi-skilled jobs in munitions, and barriers against married women taking jobs were eased. The popular [[Rosie the Riveter]] icon became a symbol for a generation of American working women.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} In addition, some 300,000 women served in U.S. military uniform with organizations such as [[Women's Army Corps]] and [[WAVES]]. With many young men gone, sports organizers tried to set up professional women's teams, such as the [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]], which closed after the war. After the war, most munitions plants closed, and civilian plants replaced their temporary female workers with returning veterans, who had priority.&lt;ref&gt;D'Ann Campbell, ''Women at War with America: Private Lives in a Patriotic Era'' (1984), ch. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Second-wave feminism" identifies a period of [[feminist]] activity from the early 1960s through the late 1980s that saw cultural and political inequalities as inextricably linked. The movement encouraged women to understand aspects of their personal lives as deeply politicized and reflective of a [[Hegemonic masculinity|sexist power structure]]. As first-wave feminists focused on absolute rights such as suffrage, second-wave feminists focused on other cultural equality issues, such as ending discrimination.&lt;ref name=Freedman&gt;Freedman, Estelle B., ''No Turning Back: The History of Feminism and the Future of Women'' (London: Ballantine Books, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Betty Friedan, ''The Feminine Mystique'', and Women's Liberation ====
In 1963, [[Betty Friedan]]'s exposé ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' became the voice for the discontent and disorientation women felt in being shunted into homemaking positions after their college graduations. In the book, Friedan explored the roots of the change in women's roles from essential workforce during World War II to homebound housewife and mother after the war, and assessed the forces that drove this change in perception of women's roles.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Over the following decade, "[[Feminist movement|Women's Liberation]]" became a common phrase and concept.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

1960s feminism, its theory, and its activism was informed and fueled by the social, cultural, and political climate of that decade.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} This time was marked by increased female enrollment in higher education, the establishment of academic [[women's studies]] courses and departments,&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Florence.

''Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law''. 1987, {{ISBN|0-674-29874-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pauline B. Bart, some people see radical feminism as the only movement that truly expresses the pain of being a woman in an unequal society, as it portrays that reality with the experiences of the battered and violated, which they claim to be the norm.&lt;ref&gt;Bart, Pauline B.

Third-wave feminism began in the early 1990s in response to what young women perceived as failures of the [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave]]. It also responds to the backlash against the second-wave's initiatives and movements.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Third-wave feminism seeks to challenge or avoid second-wave "[[Essentialism|essentialist]]" definitions of [[femininity]], which over-emphasized the experiences of white, upper middle class women. A [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] interpretation of gender and sexuality, or an understanding of gender as outside binary maleness and femaleness, is central to much of the third wave's ideology.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Third-wave feminists often describe "micropolitics",{{Clarify|date=May 2013}} and challenge second-wave paradigms about whether actions are unilaterally good for females.&lt;ref name=Freedman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;Henry, Astrid, ''Not My Mother's Sister: Generational Conflict and Third-Wave Feminism'' (Indiana University Press, 2003), {{ISBN|978-0-253-21713-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillis&gt;Gillis, Stacy, Gillian Howie &amp; Rebecca Munford (eds), ''Third Wave Feminism: A Critical Exploration'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2007), {{ISBN|978-0-230-52174-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Faludi&gt;Faludi, Susan, ''Backlash: The Undeclared War Against Women'' (Vintage, 1993), {{ISBN|978-0-09-922271-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=examples}}

These aspects of third-wave feminism arose in the mid-1980s. Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave like [[Gloria Anzaldúa]], [[bell hooks&lt;!-- For this person's name, the initials should be in the lower case. --&gt;]], [[Chela Sandoval]], [[Cherríe Moraga]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Luisa Accati]], [[Maxine Hong Kingston]], and many other feminists of color, called for a new subjectivity in feminist voice. They wanted prominent feminist thought to consider race-related subjectivities.{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=examples}} This focus on the intersection between race and gender remained prominent through the 1991 [[Hill–Thomas hearings]], but began to shift with the [[Freedom Ride 1992]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} a drive to register voters in poor minority communities whose rhetoric intended to rally young feminists. For many, the rallying of the young is the common link within third-wave feminism.&lt;ref name=Freedman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Henry/&gt;

==== Sexual politics ====
[[Lesbianism]] during the second wave was visible within and without feminism. Lesbians felt sidelined by both gay liberation and women's liberation, where they were referred to as the "[[Lavender Menace]]", provoking ''[[The Woman-Identified Woman]]'', a 1970 manifesto that put lesbian women at the forefront of the liberation movement.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} [[Jill Johnston]]'s 1973 ''[[Lesbian Nation: The Feminist Solution]]'' argued for [[lesbian separatism]].{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=explain, connect to rest of paragraph}} In its extreme form, this was expressed as the only appropriate choice for a woman.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Eventually the lesbian movement was welcomed into the mainstream women's movement. This union's threat to male normativity was substantiated by the male backlash that followed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

In [[reproductive rights]], feminists sought the right to contraception and birth control, which were almost universally restricted until the 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Feminists hoped to use the first [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]] to free women to decide the terms under which they will bear children. They felt that reproductive self-control was essential for full economic independence from men. Access to [[abortion]] was also widely demanded for these reasons, but was more difficult to secure due to existing, deep societal divisions over the issue.

Third-wave feminists also fought to hasten social acceptance of female sexual freedom. As societal norms allowed men to have multiple sexual partners without rebuke, feminists sought sexual equality for that freedom and encouraged "[[sexual liberation]]" for women, including sex for pleasure with multiple partners, if desired.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} &lt;!-- add critique here, previous section was completely unsourced from Feb 2007 to May 2013... --&gt;

==== Global feminism ====
Following World War II, the [[United Nations]] (UN) extended feminism's global reach. They established a [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women|Commission on the Status of Women]] in 1946.,&lt;ref name="Winslow14"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Women, Politics, and the United Nations |editor=Winslow, Anne |year=1995 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |location=Westport, CT |isbn=9780313295225 |pages=13–14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mSXKUeyp9b8C&amp;printsec=frontcover }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/CSW60YRS/CSWbriefhistory.pdf Short History of the Commission on the Status of Women]&lt;/ref&gt; which later joined the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC).

This diversity builds on a common opposition to gender oppression and hierarchy which, however, is only the first step in articulating and acting upon a political agenda."&lt;ref&gt;Sen, G., Grown, C.

=== Fourth wave ===
{{Main|Fourth-wave feminism}}

[[Fourth-wave feminism]] is a recent development within the feminist movement. [[Jennifer Baumgardner]] identifies fourth-wave feminism as starting in 2008 and continuing into the present day.&lt;ref name="Baumgardner2011"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.feminist.com/resources/artspeech/genwom/baumgardner2011.html|title=Is there a fourth wave?

==== Arguments for a new wave ====
In 2005, Pythia Peay first argued for the existence of a fourth wave of feminism, combining justice with [[thealogy|religious spirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Peay | first= Pythia | title =Feminism's fourth wave | work =[[Utne Reader]] | issue = 128 | date = March–April 2005 | pages =59–60 | url = http://www.utne.com/community/feminisms-fourth-wave.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jennifer Baumgardner]] in 2011, a fourth wave, incorporating online resources such as [[social media]], may have begun in 2008, inspired partly by [[Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day|Take Our Daughters to Work Day]]s. This fourth wave in turn has inspired or been associated with: the Doula Project for children's services; post-abortion talk lines; pursuit of [[reproductive justice]]; [[plus-size clothing|plus-size]] fashion support; [[transgenderism (social movement)|transgenderism]] support; male feminism; [[sex work]] acceptance; and developing media including [[Feministing]], Racialicious, [[blog]]s, and [[Twitter]] campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Baumgardner, Jennifer, ''F'em!'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;250–251.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Kira Cochrane]], a fourth wave had appeared in the U.K. and several other nations by 2012-13. It focused on: sexual inequality as manifested in "street harassment, sexual harassment, workplace discrimination[,]&amp;nbsp;... body-shaming";&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|authorlink=Kira Cochrane|title=The fourth wave of feminism: meet the rebel women|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/fourth-wave-feminism-rebel-women|accessdate=14 December 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 December 2013}} (Cochrane is also the author of ''All the Rebel Women: The Rise of the Fourth Wave of Feminism'' (Guardian Shorts Originals series ebook 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; media images, "online misogyny",&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210" /&gt; "assault[s] on public transport";&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210" /&gt; on [[intersectionality]]; on [[social media]] technology for communication and online petitioning for organizing; and on the perception, inherited from prior waves, that individual experiences are shared and thus can have political solutions.&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210" /&gt; Cochrane identified as fourth wave such organizations and websites as the [[Everyday Sexism Project]] and [[Kat Banyard|UK Feminista]]; and events such as [[Reclaim the Night]], [[One Billion Rising]], and "a Lose the Lads' mags protest",&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210" /&gt; where "many of [the leaders]&amp;nbsp;... are in their teens and 20s".&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210" /&gt;

In 2014, [[Betty Dodson]], who is also acknowledged as one of the leaders of the early 1980s pro-sex feminist movement, expressed that she considers herself a fourth wave feminist. Dodson expressed that the previous waves of feminist were banal and anti-sexual, which is why she has chosen to look at a new stance of feminism, fourth wave feminism. In 2014, Dodson worked with women to discover their sexual desires through masturbation. Dodson says her work has gained a fresh lease of life with a new audience of young, successful women who have never had an orgasm. This includes fourth-wave feminists - those rejecting the anti-pleasure stance they believe third-wave feminists stand for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Lydia|title=Betty Dodson and Fourth-Wave Feminism: Masturbation is Key to Longer Life|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/betty-dodson-fourth-wave-feminism-masturbation-key-longer-life-1447536|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett and Holly Baxter released their book, ''The Vagenda.'' The authors of the book both consider themselves fourth wave feminists. Like their website "The Vagenda", their book aims to flag and debunk the stereotypes of femininity promoted by the mainstream women's press.&lt;ref&gt;http://vagendamagazine.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer of the book has expressed disappointment with ''The Vagenda'', saying that instead of being the "call to arms for young women" that it purports to be, it reads like a joyless dissertation detailing "everything bad the media has ever done to women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanghani|first=Radhika|title=My generation of feminists is depressing me|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10773101/My-generation-of-feminists-is-depressing-me.html|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Everyday Sexism Project ====
The Everyday Sexism Project began as a social media campaign on 16 April 2012 by Laura Bates, a British feminist writer. The aim of the site was to document everyday examples of sexism as reported by contributors around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Everyday Sexism Project]]&lt;/ref&gt; Bates established the Everyday Sexism Project as an open forum where women could post their experiences of harassment.  Bates explains the Everyday Sexism Project's goal, ""The project was never about solving sexism. It was about getting people to take the first step of just realising there is a problem that needs to be fixed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aitkenhead|first=Decca|title=Laura Bates interview: 'Two years ago, I didn't know what feminism meant'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/24/laura-bates-interview-everyday-sexism|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website was such a success that Bates decided to write and publish a book, ''Everyday Sexism'', which further emphasizes the importance of having this type of online forum for women. The book provides unique insight into the vibrant movement of the upcoming fourth wave and the untold stories that women shared through the Everyday Sexism Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bates|first=Laura|title=Everyday Sexism|publisher=Simon and Schuster|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lF6EAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=the+everyday+sexism+project|isbn=9781471131585|date=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Click! The Ongoing Feminist Revolution'''

In November 2015, a group of historians working with Clio Visualizing History [https://www.cliohistory.org/] launched ''Click! The Ongoing Feminist Revolution.''[https://www.cliohistory.org/click/] This digital history exhibit examines the history of American feminism from the era of World War Two to the present. The exhibit has three major sections: Politics and Social Movements; Body and Health; and Workplace and Family. There are also interactive timelines linking to a vast array of sources documenting the history of American feminism and providing information about current feminist activism.

===Criticisms of the Wave Metaphor ===
The wave metaphor has been critiqued as inappropriate, limiting, and misleading by a number of feminist scholars.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist Theory Reader: Local and Global Perspectives|last=Nicholson|first=Linda|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=McCann|editor-first=Carole R.|edition=3rd|location=New York|pages=|chapter=Feminism in "Waves": Useful Metaphor or Not?|editor-last2=Kim|editor-first2=Seung-Kyung|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist Theory Reader: Local and Global Perspectives|last=Basu|first=Amrita|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=McCann|editor-first=Carole R.|edition=3rd|location=New York|pages=|chapter=Globalization of the Local/Localization of the Global: Mapping Transnational Women's Movements|editor-last2=Kim|editor-first2=Seung-Kyung|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While this metaphor was once useful for United States feminists in order to gain the attention required to make large-scale political changes, as was the case for the women’s suffrage movement of the 1940s, its relevance may have not only run its course but its usage has been argued as completely inappropriate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For example, the suffragettes did not use the term ‘feminism’ to describe themselves or their movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This critique is shown through one early twentieth century feminist’s words: “All feminists are suffragists, but not all suffragists are feminists”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Grounding of Modern Feminism|last=Cott|first=Nancy|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=New Haven and London|pages=15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wave metaphor has been described as misleading and even dangerous because it not only renders the periods of time in-between waves as silent and irrelevant, but it also contributes to the faulty conceptualization of a particular brand hegemonic feminism as the ultimate understanding of what feminism is.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  These critiques advocate for the recognition of periods of mass social organizing rather than ‘waves’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  It is argued that the wave metaphor weakens the strength and relevance of feminist arguments, since waves necessarily must peak and then retreat, which is not an accurate picture of feminist progress in the United States or elsewhere.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Feminism does not retreat or disappear in-between ‘waves'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For example, after the explosion of mass social organizing in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, feminism was being worked into our institutions – a much less glamorous but just as important job that did not require such large-scale attention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  As a result, we have seen more and more women in more areas of the job force, higher education, and the installation and success of Women’s and Gender Studies programs across the United States, to name just a few examples of feminism’s continuous and very relevant presence in this time between the ‘waves’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The wave metaphor has further been criticized for privileging not only particular races and classes of women in the United States, but for privileging the feminism of the United States in general over other locations in the world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Amrita Basu argues for, “the politics and conditions of emergence,” instead of the wave metaphor, which does not allow for this privileging of particular people and nations but instead allows for the importance and understanding of any and all peoples in the world who have contributed to feminism and its many understandings and meanings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== National histories of feminism ==

=== France ===
{{Main|Feminism in France}}
The 18th century [[French Revolution]]'s focus on [[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|''égalité'']] (equality) extended to the inequities faced by French women. The writer [[Olympe de Gouges]] amended the 1791 ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' into the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'', where she argued that women accountable to the law must also bear equal responsibility under the law. She also addressed marriage as a social contract between equals and attacked women's reliance on beauty and charm as a form of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Scott |first=Joan W. |authorlink=Joan Wallach Scott |title=Only Paradoxes to Offer: French Feminists and the Rights of Man |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |year=1996 |isbn=0-674-63930-8}}, ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century, conservative, post-Revolution France was inhospitable for feminist ideas, as expressed in the counter-revolutionary writings on the role of women by [[Joseph de Maistre]] and [[Louis Gabriel Ambroise de Bonald|Viscount Louis de Bonald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=French Feminism in the 19th Century |last=Moses |first=Claire Goldberg |year=1984 |publisher=SUNY Press |location=Albany, NY |isbn=9780873958592 |page=6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JlaBeKzvc6AC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advancement came mid-century under the [[Revolutions of 1848|1848 revolution]] and the proclamation of the Second Republic, which introduced male suffrage amid hopes that similar benefits would apply to women.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Although the Utopian [[Charles Fourier]] is considered a feminist writer of this period, his influence was minimal at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, MC. ''Charles Fourier''. Twayne's World Author's Series 578, Boston, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; With the fall of the conservative [[Louis-Philippe]] in 1848, feminist hopes were raised, as in 1790. Movement newspapers and organizations appeared, such as [[Eugénie Niboyet]]'s ''[[La Voix des Femmes]]'' (''The Women's Voice''), the first feminist daily newspaper in France. Niboyet was a Protestant who had adopted [[Saint-Simonianism]], and ''La Voix'' attracted other women from that movement, including the seamstress [[Jeanne Deroin]] and the primary schoolteacher [[Pauline Roland]]. Unsuccessful attempts were also made to recruit [[George Sand]]. Feminism was treated as a threat due to its ties with socialism, which was scrutinized since the Revolution.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Deroin and Roland were both arrested, tried, and imprisoned in 1849. With the emergence of a new, more conservative government in 1852, feminism would have to wait until the [[Third French Republic]].

The [[Groupe Français d'Etudes Féministes]] were women intellectuals at the beginning of the 20th century who translated part of [[Johann Jakob Bachofen|Bachofen]]'s canon into French&lt;ref&gt;Bachofen, Johann Jakob. ''Les droits de la mère dans l'antiquité'': Préface de l'ouvrage de J-J Bachofen. Groupe Français d'Etudes Féministes (trans., ed.), Paris, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; and campaigned for the family law reform. In 1905, they founded ''[[L'entente]]'', which published articles on women's history, and became the focus for the intellectual [[avant-garde]]. It advocated for women's entry into higher education and the male-dominated professions.&lt;ref&gt;Klejman, Laurence and Florence Rochefort. ''L'égalite en marche: Le féminisme sous la Troisième République'', Paris, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the [[Parti Socialiste Féminin]] socialist feminists, adopted a Marxist version of matriarchy.{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=for what?}} Like the Groupe Français, they toiled for a new age of equality, not for a return to prehistoric models of matriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aline Valette|Valette, Aline]].

{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
{{Main|Feminism in Germany}}
Modern feminism in [[Germany]] began during the [[Wilhelmine]] period (1888–1918) with feminists pressuring a range of traditional institutions, from universities to government, to open their doors to women. The organized German women's movement is widely attributed to writer and feminist [[Louise Otto-Peters]] (1819–1895). This movement culminated in [[women's suffrage]] in 1919. Later waves of feminists continued to ask for legal and social equality in public and family life. [[Alice Schwarzer]] is the most prominent contemporary German feminist.

{{Main|Women's rights movement in Iran}}
The Iranian women's rights movement first emerged some time after the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]], in the year in which the first women's journal was published, 1910. The movement lasted until 1933, when the last women's association was dissolved by the [[Reza Shah]]'s government.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} The status of women further deteriorated after the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]]. Many of the rights women gained under Shah were systematically abolished through legislation, elimination of women from work, and forced [[hijab]] (veils for women).&lt;ref&gt;Sanasarian 136&lt;/ref&gt; The movement later grew again under feminist figures such as [[Bibi Khanoom Astarabadi]], [[Touba Azmoudeh]], [[Sediqeh Dowlatabadi]], [[Mohtaram Eskandari]], [[Roshank No'doost]], [[Afaq Parsa]], [[Fakhr ozma Arghoun]], [[Shahnaz Azad]], [[Noor-ol-Hoda Mangeneh]], [[Zandokht Shirazi]], [[Maryam Amid]] ([[Mariam Mozayen-ol Sadat]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Eliz Sanasarian|Sanasarian, Eliz]].

In 1992, [[Shahla Sherkat]] founded ''[[Zanan]]'' (''Women'') magazine, which covered Iranian women's concerns and tested political boundaries with edgy reportage on reform politics, domestic abuse, and sex. It is the most important Iranian women's journal published after the Iranian revolution.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} It systematically criticized the Islamic legal code and argued that gender equality is Islamic and religious literature had been misread and misappropriated by misogynists. Mehangiz Kar, Shahla Lahiji, and Shahla Sherkat, the editor of ''Zanan'', lead the debate on women's rights and demanded reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranian.com/History/2000/March/Women/index3.html ''Women's movement: Zanan magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt; On August 27, 2006, the [[One Million Signatures]] Iranian women's rights campaign was started. It aims to end legal discrimination against women in Iranian laws by collecting a million signatures.{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=Iranian signatures only?

[[File:Foot binding- wealthy Chinese women.jpg|left|thumb|Wealthy Chinese women with bound feet (Beijing, 1900). Foot binding was a symbol of women's oppression during the reform movements in the 19th and 20th centuries.]] Feminism in China began in the late [[Qing Dynasty|Qing period]] as Chinese society re-evaluated traditional and [[Confucian]] values such as [[foot binding]] and gender segregation, and began to reject traditional gender ideas as hindering progress towards [[modernization]].&lt;ref&gt;Ko, Dorothy, [[JaHyun Kim Haboush]], Joan R. Piggott ''Women and Confucian cultures in premodern China, Korea, and Japan''. University of California Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-520-23138-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-520-23138-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1898 [[Hundred Days' Reform]], reformers called for women's education, gender equality, and the end of foot binding. Female reformers formed the first Chinese women's society, the Society for the Diffusion of Knowledge among Chinese Women (''Nüxuehui'').&lt;ref&gt;Ma, Yuxin ''Women journalists and feminism in China, 1898-1937'' Cambria Press, 2010, {{ISBN|1-60497-660-8}}, {{ISBN|978-1-60497-660-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Qing Dynasty's collapse, [[women's liberation]] became a goal of the [[May Fourth Movement]] and the [[New Culture Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Farris, Catherine S., Anru Lee, Murray A.

Sharpe, 2004, {{ISBN|0-7656-0814-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7656-0814-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[Chinese Communist Revolution]] adopted women's liberation as one of its aims and promoted women's equality, especially regarding women's participation in the workforce. After the revolution and progress in integrating women into the workforce, the [[Chinese Communist Party]] claimed to have successfully achieved women's liberation, and women's inequality was no longer seen as a problem.&lt;ref name="Dooling"&gt;Dooling, Amy D. ''Women's literary feminism in 20th-century China'', Macmillan, 2005, {{ISBN|1-4039-6733-4}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4039-6733-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=Did they declare it was no longer seen as a problem, or is this a reflection of Chinese sentiment?}}

Second- and third-wave feminism in China was characterized by a re-examination of women's roles during the reform movements of the early 20th century and the ways in which feminism was adopted by those various movements in order to achieve their goals. Later and current feminists have questioned whether gender equality has actually been fully achieved, and discuss current gender problems, such as the large [[Missing women of Asia|gender disparity]] in the population.&lt;ref name="Dooling" /&gt;

=== Japan ===
{{Main|Feminism in Japan}}
Japanese feminism as an organized political movement dates back to the early years of the 20th century when [[Kato Shidzue]] pushed for [[contraception|birth control]] availability as part of a broad spectrum of [[progressivism|progressive]] reforms. Shidzue went on to serve in the [[National Diet of Japan|National Diet]] following the defeat of Japan in World War II and the promulgation of the [[Constitution of Japan|Peace Constitution]] by US forces.&lt;ref name=Buckley1997&gt;Buckley, Susan, ''Broken Silence: Voices of Japanese Feminism'' (University of California Press, 1997), {{ISBN|978-0-520-08514-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other figures such as [[Fumiko Hayashi (author)|Hayashi Fumiko]] and [[Ariyoshi Sawako]] illustrate the broad socialist ideologies of Japanese feminism that seeks to accomplish broad goals rather than celebrate the individual achievements of powerful women.&lt;ref name=Buckley1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mackie&gt;Mackie, Vera, ''Feminism in Modern Japan Citizenship, Embodiment and Sexuality'' (Curtin University of Technology, 2003), {{ISBN|978-0-521-82018-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norway ===
[[File:Camilla Collett 1839.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Camilla Collett]]
Norwegian feminism's political origins are in the [[women's suffrage]] movement. [[Camilla Collett]] (1813–1895) is widely considered the first Norwegian feminist. Originating from a literary family, she wrote a novel and several articles on the difficulties facing women of her time, and, in particular, [[forced marriage]]s. [[Amalie Skram]] (1846–1905), a [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalist]] writer, also served as the women's voice.&lt;ref name=Andersen&gt;Andersen, Arlow W., ''Rough Road to Glory: The Norwegian-American Press Speaks Out on Public Affairs 1875 to 1925'' (Balch Institute Press, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Norwegian Association for Women's Rights]] was founded in 1884 by [[Gina Krog]] and Hagbart Berner. The organization raised issues related to women's rights to education and economic self-determination, and, above all, universal suffrage. The Norwegian Parliament passed the women's right to vote into law on June 11, 1913. Norway was the second country in Europe (after Finland) to have full suffrage for women.&lt;ref name= Andersen/&gt;

=== Poland ===
[[File:Irena Krzywicka Polish writer 1930.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Irena Krzywicka]]]]
{{Main|Feminism in Poland}}
The development of feminism in Poland ([[National Independence Day|re-recreated in modern times]] in 1918) and Polish territories has traditionally been divided into seven successive "waves".&lt;ref name=Loch&gt;Łoch, Eugenia (ed.) 2001. ''Modernizm i feminizm. Postacie kobiece w literaturze polskiej i obcej''. Lublin: Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu M.Curie-Skłodowskiej.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Radical feminism]] emerged in 1920s Poland. Its chief representatives, [[Irena Krzywicka]] and [[Maria Morozowicz-Szczepkowska]], advocated for women's personal, social, and legal independence from men. Krzywicka and [[Tadeusz Żeleński]] both promoted [[planned parenthood]], [[sexual education]], rights to divorce and abortion, and equality of sexes. Krzywicka published a series of articles in ''Wiadomości Literackie'' in which she protested against interference by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the intimate lives of Poles.&lt;ref name=Loch/&gt;

After the Second World War, the Polish [[Communist]] state (established in 1948) forcefully promoted women's emancipation at home and at work. However, during Communist rule (until 1989), feminism in general and second-wave feminism in particular were practically absent. Although feminist texts were produced in the 1950s and afterwards, they were usually controlled and generated by the Communist state.&lt;ref name="Śleczka" &gt;Śleczka, Kazimierz, 1997. "Feminizm czy feminizmy". In: Zofia Gorczyńska, Sabina Kruszyńska, Irena Zakidalska (eds.). ''Płeć, kobieta, feminizm''. Gdańsk: Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Gdańskiego.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of Communism, the Polish government, dominated by Catholic political parties, introduced a ''de facto'' legal ban on abortions. Since then, some feminists have adopted argumentative strategies from the 1980s [[United States pro-choice movement|American pro-choice movement]].&lt;ref name=Loch/&gt;

== Histories of selected feminist issues ==

=== Feminist theory ===
{{Main|Feminist theory}}
[[File:Simone de Beauvoir.jpg|thumb|200 px|Simone de Beauvoir]]
The sexuality and gender historian Nancy Cott distinguishes between ''modern feminism'' and its antecedents, particularly the struggle for suffrage.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} She argues that in the two decades surrounding the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]]'s 1920 passage, the prior ''woman movement'' primarily concerned women as ''[[universalism|universal]]'' entities, whereas over this 20-year period, the movement prioritized social differentiation, attention to ''[[individuality]]'', and diversity.{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=what kind of diversity?}} New issues dealt more with gender as a [[social construct]], gender identity, and relationships within and between genders. Politically, this represented a shift from an ideological alignment comfortable with the right, to one more radically associated with the left.&lt;ref&gt;Cott, Nancy F. ''The Grounding of Modern Feminism''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=May 2013|reason=any secondary sources for this?}}

In the immediate postwar period, [[Simone de Beauvoir]] opposed the "woman in the home" norm. She introduced an [[existentialist]] dimension to feminism with the publication of ''Le Deuxième Sexe'' (''[[The Second Sex]]'') in 1949. While less an activist than a philosopher and novelist, she signed one of the Mouvement de Libération des Femmes manifestos.

The resurgence of feminist activism in the late 1960s was accompanied by an emerging literature of what might be considered female-associated issues, such as concerns for the earth, spirituality, and environmental activism.&lt;ref name="marler"&gt;Marler, Joan. "The Myth of Universal Patriarchy: A Critical Response to Cynthia Eller's [[Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory]]". ''Feminist Theology'', Vol. 14, No. 2, 163-87 (2006). For an earlier version of this article, see [http://www.belili.org/marija/eller_response.html Marija Gimbutas].&lt;/ref&gt; The atmosphere this created reignited the study of and debate on matricentricity{{Technical statement|date=May 2013}} as a rejection of [[Biological determinism|determinism]], such as with [[Adrienne Rich]] in ''Of Woman Born'' and [[Marilyn French]] in ''Beyond Power''. For [[socialist feminists]] like [[Evelyn Reed]], patriarchy held the properties of capitalism.

Ann Taylor Allen&lt;ref name="Allen01101999"/&gt; describes the differences between the collective male pessimism of male intellectuals such as [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], [[Max Weber]], and [[Georg Simmel]] at the beginning of the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;Eksteins, Modris. ''Rites of Spring: The Great War and the Birth of the Modern Age'', Boston, 1989, xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; compared to the optimism of their female counterparts, whose contributions have largely been ignored by social historians of the era.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, H. Stuart. ''Consciousness and Society: The Reorientation of European Social Thought, 1890–1930'', New York, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, [[housing development]] has ballooned in [[China]] as its economy has developed. Since 1978, the government has promoted the commercialization of housing in urban areas.&lt;ref name="ChenZhang2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chen|first1=Aimin|last2=Zhang|first2=Kevin H.|title=Urbanization and Social Welfare in China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7L0NIghIsp0C&amp;pg=PA99|accessdate=17 August 2012|year=2004|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-3313-6|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Property development has become big business in China, with new cities and suburbs springing up with new apartments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/07house.html|title=Housing in China|publisher=''China Daily''|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Housing construction ==
The most important objective of the Chinese government is to increase national GDP, and is launching building developments across China to promote economic development. However, property development in China is vastly outgrowing the number of people who can purchase them which sociologists show a major concern over and argue that it is leading to a deepening of social divisions in the country.&lt;ref name="SBS"&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbDeS_mXMnM&amp;feature=fvst|title=China's Ghost Cities|publisher=Dateline SBS|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many apartments, hotels and shops remain empty for years, with many Chinese unable to afford them.&lt;ref name="SBS"/&gt; As ''The Economist'' says, "If there is one thing that annoys the man on the Beijing omnibus, it is the cost of housing in China's cities."&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21532334|title=No way home|publisher=The Economist|date=15 October 2011|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This issue was not applicable to the housing market pre-1978 in China. Before the 1970s, the construction of housing in China was sacrificed for the development of industries and industrial growth. The construction of the housing industry only received a small portion of state-allocated funds to continue to develop the industry. Low rents for urban housing were enticing to many people, causing the available housing to be rented out quickly, giving the state little money for the precious space they are renting out. This led to a shortage of housing and a shortage of funds to build more housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Yok-shiu|date=September 1988|title=The Urban Housing Problem in China|jstor=654863|journal=The China Quarterly|volume=115|pages=387–407|doi=10.1017/s0305741000027491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the years of 1995 and 2015, the total investment allocated to the housing industry from the Chinese government has increased from a cap of 50,000 yuan to a cut-off point of 5 million yuan, showing a renewed interest in housing development in recent years from the Chinese government after years of limited funding towards the urban housing projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/2016/html/1002EN.jpg|title=Total Investment in Fixed Assets in the Whole Country and Total Investment in Residential Buildings in the Whole Country|last=|first=|date=2016|website=National Bureau of Statistics of China|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese government announced in March 2011 the objective of building 36 million units of housing by 2015.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt; In September 2011 alone, work commenced on 1.2 million units across China; a 70% increase in the construction of social housing compared with 2010 construction.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt; By 2014, Chinese builders have added 100 billion square feet of housing space in China, equating to 74 square feet per person. Construction of urban housing was a major undertaking. The country has shown a major shift in allocating funds and resources to housing their people, building over 5.5 million apartments between the years of 2003 and 2014 in China’s cities. These construction projects assigned by the state influence the construction job market in China as well. In 2014 alone, 29 million people were employed in urban construction businesses around China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glaeser|first=Edward|date=Winter 2017|title=A Real Estate Boom with Chinese Characteristics|jstor=44133952|journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=31|pages=93|doi=10.1257/jep.31.1.93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Property bubble ===
{{Main|Chinese property bubble}}

The 2011 estimates by property analysts state that there are some 89 million empty properties and apartments in China and that housing development in China is massively oversupplied and overvalued, and is a bubble waiting to burst with serious consequences in the future.&lt;ref name="SBS"/&gt;  The [[BBC]] cites [[Ordos (city)|Ordos]] in [[Inner Mongolia]] as the largest ghost town in China, full of empty shopping malls and apartment complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17390729|title=Ordos: The biggest ghost town in China|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=17 March 2012|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large, and largely uninhabited urban real estate development has been constructed 25&amp;nbsp;km from [[Dongsheng District]] in the Kangbashi New Area. Intended to house a million people, it remains largely uninhabited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1975397,00.html |title=Ordos, China: A Modern Ghost Town|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|accessdate=17 August 2012|date=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NEW SATELLITE PICTURES OF CHINA'S GHOST CITIES|author=Gus Lubin | publisher = ''Business Insider'' | date=13 June 2011|accessdate=17 August 2012|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-ghost-cities-2011-5#chinas-most-famous-ghost-city-ordos-has-been-empty-for-years-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intended to have 300,000 residents by 2010, government figures stated it had 28,000 residents by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/business/global/20ghost.html?pagewanted=all | publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' | first=David | last=Barboza | title=A New Chinese City, With Everything but People | date=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics argue that the national social-housing programme disproportionally benefits the urban population and that not only can many of the rural poor ill afford new housing in the cities, but they also find it difficult to obtain household-registration certificates (hukou).&lt;ref name="Economist"/&gt; The housing development schemes is also affecting the concentration of unemployment as once housing development are completed, workers may be laid off.&lt;ref name="WuWebster2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wu|first1=Fulong|last2=Webster|first2=Chris|title=Urban Poverty in China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zox0NJPM-ZEC&amp;pg=PA116|accessdate=17 August 2012|date=1 March 2010|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84720-969-6|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the former Director of China's Housing &amp; Real Estate Administration Bureau, Professor Lin, as of 2008, Beijing had an average of 1.41 individuals per room across the city.&lt;ref name="Zhang2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zhang|first=Xing Quan|title=Housing and Urban Upgrading in Yantai, China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zF_ihKRvHUsC&amp;pg=PT67|accessdate=17 August 2012|year=2008|publisher=UN-HABITAT|isbn=978-92-1-131923-1|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

China's housing prices are closely related to the high capital returns and resource reallocation. China's housing prices have been growing nearly twice as fast as national income over the past decade, despite a high vacancy rate and a high rate of return to capital. The bubble arises because high capital returns driven by resource reallocation are not sustainable in the long run. Rational expectations of a strong future demand for alternative stores of value can thus induce currently productive agents to speculate in the housing market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Kaiji|last2=Wen|first2=Yi|date=2017|title=The Great Housing Boom of China|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20140234|journal=American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=73–114|doi=10.1257/mac.20140234|issn=1945-7707|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This phenomenon began in the second half of the 2000s, when a large number of persons from Africa entered Israel, mainly through the [[Borders of Israel#Border with Egypt|fenced border between Israel and Egypt]].

As of January 2018, according to the Population and Immigration Authority (PIBA) there are 37,288 African migrants in Israel, not including children born to migrants in Israel.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.il/BlobFolder/reports/foreign_workers_in_israel_summary_2017/he/foreigners_in_Israel_data_2017_1.pdf|title=נתוני זרים בישראל|last=|first=|date=January 2018|website=Population and Immigration Authority|language=he|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African asylum seekers comprise 0.5% of Israel's population{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}. Most African migrants are generally regarded to be legitimate asylum seekers by various human rights organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=8 October 2012 |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/10/28/israel-asylum-seekers-blocked-border |title=Israel: Asylum Seekers Blocked at Border |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=10 January 2012 |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/new-israeli-detention-law-violates-asylum-seekers-rights-2012-01-10 |title=Israel: New detention law violates rights of asylum-seekers |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the migrants seek an asylum status under the United Nations [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]]. However, many of them, mostly citizens of [[Eritrea]] and [[Sudan]], cannot be forcibly deported from Israel. Under international law, Eritrea citizens (who, since 2009, form the majority of the undocumented workers in Israel) cannot be deported due to the opinion of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) that Eritrea has a difficult internal situation and a forced recruitment and therefore the Eritrean immigrants are defined as a "temporary humanitarian protection group". Israeli authorities have stated that they could not deport Sudanese directly back to Sudan because Israel has no diplomatic ties to Sudan.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2014/09/09/make-their-lives-miserable/israels-coercion-eritrean-and-sudanese-asylum-seekers|title="Make Their Lives Miserable"|last=|first=|date=9 September 2014|website=Human Rights Watch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the Israeli authorities grant temporary residence through "conditional release permits" which must be renewed every one to four months, depending on the discretion of the individual immigration official.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Various authorities in Israel estimate that 80–90% of the undocumented workers live primarily in two centers: more than 60% in [[Tel Aviv]] and more than 20% [[Eilat]], with a few in [[Ashdod]], [[Jerusalem]] and [[Arad, Israel|Arad]].&lt;ref name="Knesset Crime data 3" /&gt;

==Background==
The [[UNHCR]] has declared [[Eritrea]] a country in humanitarian crisis. In the [[Darfur]] region in western Sudan, a [[genocide]] has been taking place since 2003. As a result, many of its residents became refugees and fled to [[Egypt]]. Added to those were refugees from [[southern Sudan]], where [[Second Sudanese Civil War|civil war]] took place between the predominantly [[Arab]] [[Muslim]] inhabitants of the north and the non-Arab, [[Christians]] and [[animists]] inhabitants of the south.

In 2009, in reports to UNHCR, Israel stated that 90% of the persons who arrived illegally from Sudan and Eritrea were genuine refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sharon Livne |date=3 October 2010 |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/opinions/2.418/1.1223407 |script-title=he:פליטים, לא מסתננים |language=he |trans-title=Refugees, not infiltrators |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=16 September 2014}} Letter to the editor.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status of the migrants ==
According to the government, the majority of the migrants are seeking economic opportunity. This is not the case among Israel's allies such as the United States, where the vast majority of Eritrean and Sudanese applicants are accepted as refugees. Once in Israel, African migrants have sought refugee status for fleeing forced, open-ended conscription in Eritrea or ethnic cleansing in the Darfur region of Sudan, but the government of Israel maintains that these areas merely have a poor human rights record, which does not automatically entitle one to asylum. To qualify, applicants must establish that they face the risk of personal harm or persecution if they return to their country. The [[Ministry of Interior (Israel)|Interior Ministry]] has failed to review the vast majority of asylum requests.&lt;ref name="hope"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-african-migrants-in-israel-have-little-hope-2014jan07-story.html |title=African migrants in Israel have little hope |author=David Mac Dougall and Josef Federman |publisher=Associated Press |date=2014-01-07 |accessdate=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most migrants request refugee status after arriving in Israel, in accordance with the United Nations's [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]]. Israel does not review the status of the individual immigrants originating from Eritrea or Sudan, who constitute about 83% of the total people coming to Israel across the Egyptian border,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=April 2012 |url=http://www.piba.gov.il/PublicationAndTender/ForeignWorkersStat/Documents/אפריל%202012.pdf|script-title=he:נתוני זרים בישראל |language=he |trans-title=Israeli foreign data |publisher=Israel Population and Immigration Authority |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instead automatically grants them a [[Israeli policy for Sudanese and_Eritrean refugees | "temporary protection group"]] status. This status allows these people to have temporary residence right within Israel, which must be renew every 3 months; usually this also means that they would be eligible for a [[work permit]] in Israel. In the past Israel also granted an automatic "temporary protection group" status to all citizens of the [[Ivory Coast]] and [[South Sudan]], although since then the validity of this status has expired. Regarding the other asylum requests filed by citizens of other countries and examined individually, the Interior Ministry stated that only a fraction of them were actually eligible for refugee status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Zahava Galeon |date=12 November 2010 |url=http://www.israelhayom.co.il/site/newsletter_opinion.php?id=4936&amp;newsletter=12.11.2010 |script-title=he:מסיתים נגד פליטים |language=he |trans-title=Agitators against refugees |newspaper=[[Israel HaYom]] |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of illegal immigration from Africa to Israel==
The Israeli government originally tolerated the new arrivals from Africa. It allowed their entry and many migrants found menial jobs in hotels and restaurants. But after their numbers swelled, concerns were raised.&lt;ref name="hope"/&gt; In the second half of the 2000s decade, there was a significant increase in the number of undocumented workers from Africa to Israel who crossed the Egyptian border. In 2006 about 1,000 undocumented workers were detained; in 2007 about 5,000 were detained; in 2008 about 8,700 were detained; and in 2009 about 5,000 were detained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=26 May 2010 |script-title=he:הטיפול במסתננים מגבול מצרים |language=he |trans-title=Treatment infiltrators from the border with Egypt |url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/pdf/m02524.pdf |publisher=Knesset Research and Information Center |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of 2010 the migration rate even further increased in the first seven months when over 8,000 undocumented workers were caught.&lt;ref name="Knesset Crime data"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/pdf/m02625.pdf |script-title=he:נתונים על פשיעה של מסתננים ומבקשי מקלט וכנגד מסת ננים ומבקשי מקלט |language=he |trans-title=Data on crimes made by illegal immigrants and asylum seekers and of crimes made against illegal immigrants and asylum seekers|date=11 October 2010 |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of undocumented workers is clearly greater than these figures, because many were not apprehended.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} The early wave of undocumented workers came mainly from Sudan, while in 2009 the majority of the immigrants were from [[Eritrea]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In early May 2010, it was estimated that 24,339 undocumented workers resided in Israel, of whom the number of Sudanese and Eritrean refugees who are not deportable under [[international law]] was 18,959: 5,649 Sudanese and 13,310 Eritreans. 16,766 of them received a special visa (ס 2א 5) granted to illegal immigrants who are non-deportable [[asylum seekers]]. Officially, the visa allows them only to stay in the country, but in practice the state also allows the refugees to work and avoids imposing fines on the Israeli employers who employ them. This special visa requires renewal every three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=8 June 2010 |script-title=he:קורבנות ניצול למטרות מין ועבדות בקרב המסתננים ומבקשי המקלט בישראל |language=he |trans-title=Victims of exploitation for sexual purposes and slavery among the infiltrators and asylum seekers in Israel |url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/doc.asp?doc=m02534&amp;type=pdf |publisher=Knesset Research and Information Center |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli immigration police patrols the neighborhoods of south [[Tel Aviv]] regularly and arrests asylum seekers who do not carry a valid visa; the punishment can be one to three months in prison.

141 immigrants, mostly from [[Ethiopia]], received [[refugee status]].

According to the IDF's Operations Division in 2008, most of the countries from where the illegal immigrants came are (in descending order): [[Eritrea]], [[Sudan]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Ivory Coast]] and [[Nigeria]]. Most of the illegal immigrants (85%) were men.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |date=December 2009 |url=http://web.hevra.haifa.ac.il/~ch-strategy/images/publications/darfur_refugees.pdf |script-title=he:פליטים או מהגרי עבודה ממדינות אפריקה |language=he |trans-title=Refugees or migrant workers from African states |publisher=Research Center, National Defense College and Chaikin Chair in Geostrategy, University of Haifa |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814142203/http://web.hevra.haifa.ac.il/~ch-strategy/images/publications/darfur_refugees.pdf |archivedate=14 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration to Israel===
Most migrants initially arrive in [[Egypt]], and from there they often pay sums of up to two thousand dollars for [[Bedouin]] smugglers to transfer them to the border between Egypt and Israel. There have been cases of abuse against the female migrants committed by the Bedouin smugglers, including [[rape]], kidnapping for ransom, and murder. Another danger for the migrants includes the Egyptian army policy to shoot at them in order to prevent crossing the Egypt/Israel border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Liam Stack |date=13 November 2008|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2008/1113/p06s03-wome.html |title=Human Rights Watch faults Egypt's 'shoot-to-stop' policy |newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Amir Bohbot |date=2 October 2011 |url=http://news.walla.co.il/?w=/0/1865224 |script-title=he:תופעה בגבול הדרומי: הצבא המצרי יורה במסתננים |language=he |trans-title=The southern border phenomenon: the Egyptian army shoots infiltrators |publisher=[[Walla!]] |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To contain the illegal entry of persons, construction of the [[Egypt–Israel barrier]] commenced in 2012 and was completed in 2015. 9,570 citizens of various African countries entered Israel illegally in the first half of 2012, while only 34 did the same in the first six months of 2013, after construction of the main section of the barrier was completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/169521#.UeXqBUB15DQ New Data Shows 99% Drop in Illegal Entry], Arutz Sheva. 2 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netanyahu.org.il/en/news/573-99-6-drop-in-the-number-of-infiltrators-entering-israel-due-to-government-action 99.6% Drop in the Number of Infiltrators Entering Israel Due to Government Action] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930062343/http://netanyahu.org.il/en/news/573-99-6-drop-in-the-number-of-infiltrators-entering-israel-due-to-government-action |date=2013-09-30 }}, Israeli Prime Minister official website. 1 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4402834,00.html Israel to trade arms for migrants with African countries], Ynetnews.com. 9 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; After the entire fence was completed, the number of migrant crossings had dropped to 16 in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.jpost.com/Israel-News/Israel-completes-heightened-Egypt-border-fence-478840 ISRAEL COMPLETES HEIGHTENED EGYPT BORDER FENCE]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Numbers and place of residence ===
As of April 2012, 59,858 illegal immigrants who were never imprisoned in detention facilities have illegally enter into Israel (in August 2010 the number of the imprisoned was 1,900).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=April 2012 |url=http://piba.gov.il/PublicationAndTender/ForeignWorkersStat/Documents/אפריל%202012.pdf |script-title=he:נתוני זרים בישראל |language=he |trans-title=Israel Foreign Data |publisher=Israel Population and Immigration Authority |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several thousands of them did not end up staying in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=November 2011 |url=http://piba.gov.il/PublicationAndTender/ForeignWorkersStat/Documents/nov2011.pdf |script-title=he:נתוני זרים בישראל |language=he |trans-title=Israeli Foreign Data |publisher=Israel Population and Immigration Authority |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli department of immigration does not keep continuous supervision over their place of residence but, according to estimates based on data from the Israeli police, the local authorities and the aid organizations, approximately 34,000 illegal immigrants originated from [[Eritrea]], about 15,000 originated from [[Sudan]] and 10,000 originated from other countries. The Israeli [[Administration of Border Crossings, Population and Immigration]] does not keep detailed documentation regarding their place of residence, but according to estimates from 2011, which are based on data from the Israeli police, the local authorities and the NGOs, circa 15,000–17,000 illegal immigrants lived in [[Tel Aviv]] (mainly in southern Tel Aviv, though the number also includes illegal immigrants living in [[Bat Yam]] and [[Bnei Brak]]) and 4,000–8,000 living in [[Eilat]]. While the estimates in [[Ashdod]] range from 1,500 to 2,000 illegal immigrants, in [[Jerusalem]] range from 1,000 to 8,000 illegal immigrants, and in [[Arad, Israel|Arad]] range from 400 to 600 illegal immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=25 May 2011 |url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/pdf/m02844.pdf |script-title=he:פשיעה של מסתננים ומבקשי מקלט וכנגד מסתננים ומבקשי מקלט |language=he |trans-title=Crime of infiltrators and asylum seekers and against infiltrators and asylum seekers |publisher=Knesset Research and Information Center |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, only 39,274 of those who entered the country remain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Involvement in crime ===
In a discussion held by the police commissioner [[Dudi Cohen]] in December 2010, he stated that while there is a decline in cases of [[robberies]] in the general population, there is a dramatic increase in this type of crime among the illegal immigrants. According to the research department of the Israel Police and Israel's foreign immigrants' crime is characterized by predominantly sectoral internal crime, in which a gun is not reported, and illegal immigrants generally have no interest in complaining to the police.&lt;ref name="Knesset Crime data" /&gt; Due to an increase in criminal acts and the feeling of insecurity among the residents of southern Tel Aviv, the Israeli police established a new station near the New central bus station and the Shapira neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Avi Cohen |date=18 May 2012 |url=http://www.israelhayom.co.il/site/newsletter_article.php?id=17206&amp;hp=1&amp;newsletter=18.05.2012 |script-title=he:פחד ברחובות |language=he |trans-title=Fear in the streets  |newspaper=[[Israel HaYom]] |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station includes approximately 100 police officers and is expected to accommodate about 150 police officers. According to the data of the Israeli Police, which was presented to the Knesset in March 2012, from 2007 there was a steady increase in the involvement in crime of the illegal immigrants, both due to the significant increase in their numbers and for various other reasons. In 2011, 1,200 [[criminal case]]s were opened against illegal immigrants from Africa, half of them in the Tel Aviv district. This is an increase of 54% in comparison to the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Omri Efraim |date=19 March 2012 |script-title=he:המשטרה: עלייה של 23% בפשיעת הזרים |language=he |trans-title=Police: up 23% of crime is foreign |publisher=[[Ynet]] }} http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/1,7340,L-4204802,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He stated that statistics indicate most of the crimes reported are between immigrants and include theft, drug sales and domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.makorrishon.co.il/nrg/online/1/ART2/896/830.html|title=מקור ראשון, ''אם מישהו מפחד לצאת, יהיה כוח שייגש אליו''|work=NRG|access-date=2018-03-24|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli police reported experiencing difficulties dealing with criminal cases involving illegal immigrants originating from Africa, since the police do not possess interpreters who are capable of speaking the [[Tigrinya language]] spoken in [[Eritrea]]. In addition, the Israeli legal system also has reported a serious difficulty in conducting proper criminal procedures involving suspects who speak only the [[Tigrinya language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=13 March 2012 |url=http://www.news1.co.il/uploadFiles/433315455913544.doc |script-title=he:מדינת ישראל נגד ביינה סמרהרט |language=he |trans-title=State of Israel v.

In her ruling on the [[Holot]] "open detention facility", Israeli Supreme Court justice Edna Arbel stated that there is disagreement regarding the factual situation, whereas there are studies that show that the level of crime committed by infiltrators is lower than that in society in general. She however emphasized that the distressful feeling of the residents of South Tel Aviv that the level of security in their neighborhoods has decreased considerably, should not be underestimated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=16 September 2013 |last1=Arbel|first1=Edna|title=Adam v.

==Development of the state's treatment of African asylum seekers==
[[File:Holot detention center.jpg|thumb|The entrance to Holot immigration detention center, Negev desert, Israel.]]
In 2010 Israel began building a [[Israel–Egypt barrier|barrier]] along sections of its border with Egypt to curb the influx of [[refugees]] from African countries. Construction was completed in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Israel completes bulk of Egypt border fence |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/02/us-israel-egypt-fence-idUSBRE9010EI20130102 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=2 January 2013 |accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 230&amp;nbsp;km of fence have been built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Herb Keinon |url=http://www.jpost.com/Defense/PM-tours-South-heralds-completion-of-border-fence |title=PM tours South, heralds completion of border fence |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=2 January 2013 |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While 9,570 citizens of various African countries entered Israel illegally in the first half of 2012, only 34 did the same in the first six months of 2013, after construction of the barrier was completed.

In 2012, the Israeli Knesset passed an "anti-infiltration law." Many Africans who entered after the bill's passage or those whose visas have expired have been to the or the neighboring [[Saharonim prison]]. Advocates like MK [[Michal Rozin]] visited Saharonim and said that migrants received adequate food and medical care and were not mistreated, but said that sending migrants there was inhumane. However, conditions for many refugees elsewhere in the region are worse, and Israeli officials maintained that conditions there were adequate.&lt;ref name="prison"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/israeli-detention-center-africans-prison |title=Israeli: Detention center for Africans a 'prison' |author=Diaa Hadid |publisher=Associated Press |date=2013-07-14 |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] declared that the long-term custody of migrants in Sahronim was unconstitutional, the government opened [[Holot]], an open detention center, in December 2013.

Judges also criticized the summons process, saying there exist fundamental problems, including the failure to examine individual circumstances and the lack of hearings for illegal immigrants. The government stated that hearings were not necessary because ordering the migrants to travel to Holot does not violate their human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.575211 |title=Judges nix summonses of illegal immigrants, slam Israel's detention policy |author=Ilan Lior |publisher=''Haaretz'' |date=2014-02-20 |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aid organizations==
Israel has a number of organizations focused on helping the asylum seekers in Israel (mainly by legal aid) including the Hotline for Refugees and Migrants, ASSAF, [[Physicians for Human Rights-Israel]], [[African Refugees Development Center]] and [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel]].  The secular Jewish organization [[BINA Center for Jewish Identity and Hebrew Culture|Bina]], located in south Tel Aviv, has helped asylum seekers as well as Israeli citizens understand refugee rights, and has undertaken advocacy and educational activities including frequent trips for Israelis to visit the Holot Detention Center. Most of these organization are funded by the [[New Israel Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Akiva Bigman |date=1 January 2014 |url=http://mida.org.il/2014/01/01/%D7%90%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%A8%D7%98%D7%92%D7%99%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%95%D7%94-%D7%A9%D7%9C-%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%9F-%D7%94%D7%97%D7%93%D7%A9%D7%94-%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90/ |script-title=he:אסטרטגיית ה'דעווה' של הקרן החדשה לישראל |language=he |trans-title=The strategy 'Dawa' of the New Israel Fund |publisher=MIDA |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relief organizations have been involved in discussions held in Knesset committees on this issue and have submitted a petition against the measures the state has taken to put a halt to the phenomenon of immigration.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Reactions in Israel to asylum seekers and illegal immigration==
The situation underscores the tension between two strong feelings in Israel. Israel was founded in the wake of the Holocaust and has provided refuge to Jews fleeing oppression around the world. On one hand, many Israelis feel Israel has a special responsibility to assist refugees in such dire conditions. On the other hand, many Israelis fear the continued migration of illegal immigrants and refugees would threaten the Jewish majority.&lt;ref name="hope"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seder"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sabar|first=Galia|last2=Tsurkov|first2=Elizabeth|date=May 2015|title=Israel's Policies towards Asylum-Seekers:2012-2014|url=|journal=Instituto Affari Internazionali|volume=20|pages=2–18|isbn=978-88-98650-44-6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli reaction to African migrants has been mixed, with groups protesting on both sides. Human Rights advocates have been outspoken about their concerns about the treatment of asylum seekers and migrants. In 2010, Israelis protested the construction of the [https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.694423 Holot detention facility], which was built to detain illegal immigrants, stating that its construction goes against Human Rights values. At the same time, residents of South Tel Aviv demonstrated against the presence of foreigners living in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/thousands-in-tel-aviv-protest-plan-for-refugee-detention-facility-1.332737|title=Thousands in Tel Aviv Protest Plan for Refugee Detention Facility|last=Lior|first=Ilan|date=24 December 2010|work=Haaretz|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, nearly 1,000 Israelis, mostly from neighborhoods in South Tel Aviv staged a protest against illegal immigrants, joined by Member of [[Knesset]], [[Miri Regev]], they asked the government for deportation and expulsion of migrants from Africa. MK [[Miri Regev]] stated  "the Sudanese were a cancer in our body." This protest led to destruction of property and businesses owned by Sudanese and Eritrean people as well as violence against said people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/06/10/israel-amend-anti-infiltration-law|title=Israel: Amend ‘Anti-Infiltration’ Law|last=|first=|date=10 June 2012|website=Human Rights Watch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/demonstrators-attack-african-migrants-in-south-tel-aviv-1.432262|title=Demonstrators Attack African Migrants in South Tel Aviv|last=Lior|first=Ilan|date=24 May 2012|work=Haaretz|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, an immigrant from Eritrea, Habtom Zarhum, was beaten to death by a mob after being misidentified as an assailant in a [[Beersheva bus station shooting|terrorist attack at the Beersheva bus station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.681069|title=Two Dead, 11 Wounded in Shooting Attack in Southern Israel|last=Ben Zikri|first=Almog|date=19 October 2015|website=Haaretz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of discrimination against asylum seekers, who are often believed to be migrant workers or illegal immigrants, many Israelis have continued to show their support over the years for the community. Refugee [[Passover Seder|Seders]] have been held each year during the Jewish holiday of [[Passover]], most recently taking place at Holot detention facility to show solidarity and support to the men living in detention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Activists-hold-Seder-for-African-asylum-seekers-at-Holot-facility-451436|title=CTIVISTS HOLD SEDER FOR AFRICAN ASYLUM-SEEKERS AT HOLOT FACILITY|last=Sharon|first=Jeremy|date=17 April 2016|work=Jerusalem Post|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for refugees and immigrants to Israel is also demonstrated through the work of numerous non-profit organizations, including [http://www.kavlaoved.org.il/en/ Kav LaOved (Worker's Hotline]), [https://www.ardc-israel.org/ ARDC], [http://assaf.org.il/en/node/2 ASSAF]. In late 2017, early 2018, prominent North American Jewish organizations joined with Israeli NGO’s to decry Israel’s recent decisions to close Holot and deport asylum seekers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/North-American-Jewish-leaders-Please-dont-deport-Africans-533195|title=NORTH AMERICAN JEWISH LEADERS: PLEASE DON’T DEPORT AFRICANS|last=Eisenbud|first=Daniel|date=9 January 2018|work=Jerusalem Post|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli demographer [[Arnon Soffer]] has expressed his opposition to the African illegal immigration phenomenon for several reasons. He claims that from a security perspective, they may serve as "[[informant]]" or as "operatives of hostile states or [[terrorist organization]]s". Socially, he claims that they are contributing to the [[:wikt:congestion|congestion]] in the cities and to the rise in [[crime]]. From the demographic perspective, he perceives the asylum seekers and illegal immigrants to be a [[Demographic threat#Israel|demographic threat]] to the [[Israeli Jews|Jewish majority]]. According to Sofer, failing to stop the illegal immigration waves at an early stage will only lead to much larger waves of illegal immigration in the future.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

The Israeli economic commentator [[Nehemiah Shtrasler]] estimated that the illegal immigrants take the places of weaker manual workers, causing loss of jobs and a reduction in the wages. He also claimed that they burden the health care, welfare and education systems. "We would never be able to raise the standard of living of the needy and reduce the gaps, if we keep on absorbing more and more destitute people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=24 September 2010 |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/opinions/1.1222412 |script-title=he:נחמיה שטרסלר &amp;#124; 40 מסתננים ליום |language=he |trans-title=Nehemiah Shtrasler &amp;#124; 4- Infiltrators a day |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli [[Member of the Knesset|MK]] [[Ya'akov Katz (politician born 1951)|Ya'akov Katz (Katzele)]], who headed the government committee aimed at creating a solution to what they perceive to be an issue of illegal asylum seekers migrating to Israel, warned from immigration through the Israel–Egypt border and stated that if the current immigration rate to Israel would continue, within a few years there would be hundreds of thousands of illegal workers in Israel and that this would constitute a "demographic threat" to Israel, in addition to the other issues this situation would lead to, such as an "increase in crime and poverty in the areas in which the immigrants concentrate". One of Katz's proposals was to establish a city near the Egyptian border, where the immigrants would be gathered before being deported from the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Roni Sofer |date=28 December 2010 |url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4005787,00.html |script-title=he:ח"כ כ"ץ: כדור בראש לבדואים שעוזרים למסתננים |language=he |trans-title=MK Katz: ball at the top of the Bedouins who help the infiltrators |publisher=[[Ynet]] |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, Mayor of Tel Aviv [[Ron Huldai]] addressed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and demanded that the government would take "immediate emergency actions" against the immigrants. Huldai stated "Israel cannot continue to ignore the growing wave of immigrants, which at this point it is clear to everyone that they infiltrate to Israel as migrant workers and that they are not in an existential threat." Huldai called to "protect Israel's borders against infiltration" and also to allocate the necessary resources for the immigrants who already entered the country "and caused severe distress to the residents of the neighborhoods who were forced to deal with this influx".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Gilad Morag |date=4 December 2011 |url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4156696,00.html |script-title=he:חולדאי לנתניהו: תושבים מופקרים מול המסתננים |language=he |trans-title=Huldai to Netanyahu: Residents abandoned in front of the infiltrators |publisher=[[Ynet]] |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Israeli cities that have high rates of African illegal immigrants, a resistance has emerged among the local population against this phenomenon. In mid-2010, a demonstration was held in Eilat against the non-action of the Israeli government, the residents claimed that they are now afraid to walk outside at certain neighborhoods at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ahuva Mamus |date=11 July 2010 |url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3918106,00.html |script-title=he:הפליטים רוצים להישאר באילת: "לא כולם סודנים" |language=he |trans-title=Refugees want to stay in Eilat, "not all Sudanese" |publisher=[[Ynet]] |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Shapira and Kiryat Shalom neighborhoods in the southern part of Tel Aviv a number of real estate agents have stated that they intend not to rent apartments in these neighborhoods to the illegal immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Noah Koshrik |date=2 August 2010 |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/news/education/1.1214829 |script-title=he:מתווכים בדרום ת"א: לא נשכיר דירות לשב"חים |language=he |trans-title=Realtors in south Tel Aviv: illegal aliens will not rent apartments |publisher=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 May 2012 a demonstration was held in the [[Hatikva Quarter]], in which more than a thousand Israeli protesters protested against the way the Israeli government has been handling the influx of immigrants so far. During the demonstration the MKs [[Miri Regev]], [[Danny Danon]], [[Ronit Tirosh]] and [[Michael Ben-Ari]] held speeches. Later on the protest turned violent, as the participants began attacking passersby people, shattered panes of stores belonging to owners of African descent, burned garbage cans and clashed with the police forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Neri Brenner |author2=Boaz Feiler |date=23 May 2012 |url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4233445,00.html |script-title=he:מהומה ועצורים בהפגנה בדרום ת"א: זרים הותקפו |language=he |trans-title=Pandemonium and arrests at the demonstration in south Tel Aviv: Foreigners attacked |publisher=[[Ynet]] |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[President of Israel|President]] [[Shimon Peres]] issued a condemnation of the violent words and actions against the African migrant workers, calling on [[Israelis]] to refrain from racism and incitement, saying: "Hatred of foreigners contradicts the fundamental principles of [[Judaism]].

In a Channel 2 interview in November 2013, Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai scoffed at government policy toward the migrants, saying, "Can 50,000 people be a demographic threat? That's a mockery. ... The truth is they will remain here. They are human beings and I must take care of them."&lt;ref name="future"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/perspective/features/2013/12/22/Africans-face-uncertain-Israeli-future-after-perilous-migration.html|title=Africans face uncertain Israeli future after perilous migration|date=2013-12-22|accessdate=2014-05-08|publisher=[[Al Arabiya]]|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, demonstrations, rallies and other event supporting the refugees have also been held regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001052021479&amp;sk=wall |title=Ann Tifa Rave |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=11 March 2009 |url=http://wn.com/darfur_muslim_refugees_demonstrating_in_israel_to_support_icc |title=Muslim Refugees Demonstrating In Israel To Support Icc |publisher=World News Inc. |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/7708463-african-refugees-protest-in-israel |title=African Refugees Protest in Israel protests |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110729054437/http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/7708463-african-refugees-protest-in-israel |archivedate=29 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 December 2013 thousands have protested in [[Tel Aviv]] against detention of asylum seekers from Sudan and Eritrea. The protesters, marched from [[Levinsky Park]] in South Tel Aviv to city center, decrying the detention without trial of African refugees in the [[Saharonim]] and [[Holot]] detention facilities. Migrants have reportedly said to fear for their life should they return to their home countries.&lt;ref&gt;Itay Blumenthal, [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4470485,00.html TA: Thousands protest against detention of asylum seekers], ''YNetNews'', 28 December 2013, Retrieved 29 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 January 2014, the Knesset Committee on Foreign Workers met to discuss the Immigration and Border Authority policy toward illegal immigrants and its impact on the business sector. African migrants were present and participated in the Knesset meeting. They were supported by MK [[Michal Rozin]] of [[Meretz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/african-migrants-take-part-in-knesset-meeting/ |title=Week after ban, African migrants take part in Knesset meeting |author=Lazar Berman |publisher=The Times of Israel |date=2014-01-15 |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, activists organized a [[Passover seder]] with asylum seekers at the Holot facility to recall the [[Passover]] story and call attention to the plight of the migrants. Similar seders were held in support of the migrants in Tel Aviv and Washington.&lt;ref name="seder"/&gt; Similar events took place in 2015 and 2016, the seder in 2016 also celebrated in Holot detention center  was  dedicated to raise awareness to the shortage and poor quality of food  in Holot&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/iw/originals/2016/04/holot-refugees-detention-freedom-passover-seder-eritrea.html#|title=מבקשי המקלט שכלואים ב״חולות״ מחכים לחג החירות שלהם|last=פולס|first=ישראל|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions among American Jews ==
Reactions among American Jews span the spectrum of Israeli politics on this issue and are evolving into a robust debate.  The Maryland-based refugee rights organization HIAS, whose Israeli branch has been actively assisting African asylum seekers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hias.org/hias-israel|title=HIAS in Israel|work=HIAS|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; has vocally opposed the Israeli government’s policy toward the asylum seekers and has called on Israel to evaluate their refugee status claims in accordance with international law.&lt;ref name="HIAS"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hias.org/hias-calls-protection-refugees-and-asylum-seekers-israel|title=HIAS Calls for Protection of Refugees and Asylum Seekers in Israel|work=HIAS|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Los Angeles-based organization StandWithUs, whose mission is "supporting Israel around the world -- through education and fighting anti-Semitism",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.standwithus.com/aboutus/|title=StandWithUs About Us|last=HagaiZamir.com|website=www.standwithus.com|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that "most of the migrants came to Israel seeking work opportunities, not as refugees escaping war"; as StandWithUs elaborates, "unlike refugees who are fleeing war or persecution, economic migrants leave their countries in search of better work opportunities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.swuconnect.com/insys/npoflow.v.2/_assets/pdfs/fact_sheets/African%20Migrants%20in%20Israel%20factsheet.pdf|title=African Migrants in Israel - Factsheet|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, globally, national authorities have found asylum seekers from Eritrea deserving of refugee status in 84% of applications, and have granted refugee status to Sudanese asylum seekers 56% of the time, whereas Israel has only granted 1% of asylum petitions from these asylum seekers.&lt;ref name="HIAS"/&gt; Mandatory lifetime conscription is among the human-rights abuses in Eritrea from which they may be fleeing.&lt;ref name="truah.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.truah.org/campaign/asylum-seekers-in-israel/|title=Asylum Seekers in Israel {{!}} T'ruah|website=www.truah.org|language=English|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rabbinical Assembly, the clergy organization of Conservative Judaism, passed a resolution in 2016 stating that "Israel’s Ministry of the Interior has been very reluctant to grant refugee status to bona fide asylum seekers" and calling on Israel to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/story/resolution-african-asylum-seekers-israel|title=Resolution on African Asylum Seekers in Israel {{!}} The Rabbinical Assembly|website=www.rabbinicalassembly.org|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rabbinic human-rights organization T’ruah, based in New York, has made it a priority to encourage Israel to evaluate all asylum seekers’ claims fairly.&lt;ref name="truah.org"/&gt;

==Spanish Colonization of Santiago (Jamaica)==
The Spaniards first settled on that part of the northern coast of Jamaica which is now known as the parish of [[Saint Ann Parish|St. Ann]]. There they built a town called Sevilla Nueva, or New Seville. Afterwards they moved to the southern part of the island and built the town of [[St. Jago de la Vega]], which is still called [[Spanish Town]]. The island was given to the Columbus family as a personal estate in 1540, but they did nothing to develop it. The Spanish colony in Jamaica was never a very large or a very flourishing one.

==Spanish cities and towns in Jamaica==
The reminders of this historical period are the names of places all over the island, Such as [[Ocho Rios]], [[Rio Bueno, Jamaica|Rio Bueno]], [[Santa Cruz, Jamaica|Santa Cruz]], [[Rio Cobre]], [[Port Antonio]] and most importantly Spanish Town, formerly known as St. Jago de la Vega, the capital under the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discoverjamaica.com/gleaner/discover/geography/history1.htm JAMAICAN HISTORY I  &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805083846/http://www.discoverjamaica.com/gleaner/discover/geography/history1.htm |date=2013-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Japanese Peruvians''' ({{lang-es|peruano-japonés}} or ''nipo-peruano'', {{lang-ja|日系ペルー人}}, ''Nikkei Perūjin'') are [[Peruvians|Peruvian]] citizens of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] origin or ancestry.

The Japanese began arriving in [[Peru]] in the late 1800s. Many factors motivated the Japanese to immigrate to Peru.

At the end of the nineteenth century in [[Japan]], the rumor spread that a country called Peru somewhere on the opposite side of the earth was "full of gold". This country, moreover, was a paradise with a mild climate, rich soil for farming, familiar dietary customs, and no epidemics, according to advertisements of Japanese emigration companies.{{cn|date=December 2017}} 790 Japanese, all men between the ages of 20 and 45, left Japan in 1898 to work on Peru's coastal plantations as contract laborers. Their purpose was simple: to earn and save money for the return home upon termination of their four-year contracts. The 25 yen monthly salary on Peru's plantations was more than double the average salary in rural Japan (Suzuki, 1992).{{bettersource|date=April 2016}}

At the time of the First Sino-Japanese War, the economic state of Japan was poor; due to this, their surplus of skilled farmers began to look for work elsewhere. Peru provided a new job market that was accommodating to them, since they admired their work-ethic. They provided a cheap and productive labor source. After the population of Japanese immigrants grew in Peru, many Peruvian Japanese began opening small businesses.
Peru has the second largest ethnic Japanese population in South America (Brazil has the largest) and this community has made a significant cultural impact on the country,  today constituting approximately 1.4% of the population of Peru.&lt;ref name="asia1999"&gt;Lama, Abraham.

The Japanese Peruvian community began in 1899 when some 800 contract workers arrived in Callao Seaport in Lima. The Japanese migrants suffered from serious tropical diseases such as malaria, typhoid, and yellow fever, as well as discrimination due to race, language, and culture. Within a year, 143 had died and 93 fled to Bolivia (becoming the first Japanese immigrants in that country). A second ship, which brought over one thousand new Japanese immigrants, arrived four years later, and a third—with 774 Japanese immigrants—arrived in 1906 (Gardiner 1981: 3-4). By 1941 some 16,300 Japanese were living in Peru (10,300 from Okinawa and 6,000 from mainland Japan). Of these, only 3,300 were women (Masterson 2007: 148). Thus, unlike Brazil where farming family immigration was encouraged by the Brazilian authority for the migratory workers to settle in coffee plantations, single Japanese men but few women migrated to Peru. Most Japanese men married local women. Today, there are about 160,000 people of Japanese descent living in Peru, The majority are descendants of pre-war immigrants.

Unlike many other countries in Latin America, most Japanese immigrants did not settle on farms and plantations in Peru. They were able to move around to seek better opportunities and many migrated to the cities. Some worked for Japanese proprietors or started their own small businesses. By 1930, 45 percent of all Japanese in Peru ran small businesses in Lima. As in California, economic conflicts with local businesses quickly arose. The Eighty Percent Law passed in 1932 required that at least 80 percent of shop employees be non-Asian Peruvians. Furthermore, the Immigration Law of 1936 prohibited citizenship to children of alien parents, even if they were born in Peru. Peru was hardly the only country in the New World to take such actions. The United States prohibited citizenship for Asians at its inception in 1790, and reiterated it for Japanese in 1908 and 1924.

In 1940, an earthquake destroyed the city of Lima. By this time the community of Japanese and their wives and children was about 30,000 in Peru. Rumors spread that Japanese were looting.[1] As a result, some 650 Japanese houses were attacked and destroyed in Lima, an event resonating with the attack on Koreans in Japan at the time of the 1923 Kanto earthquake. Other harsh measures against Japanese-Peruvians followed. For example, in 1940 it was decreed that Japanese-Peruvians who went abroad to study in Japan would lose Peruvian citizenship.

In 1941, Peru broke off diplomatic relations with Japan after the Pearl Harbor attack and social and legal discrimination towards Japanese-Peruvians increased. All Japanese community institutions were disbanded, Japanese-language publications prohibited, and gatherings of more than three Japanese could constitute spying (Peru Simpo 1975 in Takenaka 2004:92). Japanese were not allowed to open businesses, and those who had a business were forced to auction them off. Japanese-owned deposits in Peruvian banks were frozen (Takenaka 2004:92). By 1942, Japanese were not even allowed to lease land (enacting laws jointly with the United States) (Gerbi 1943 in Takenaka 2004:92). The freedom of Japanese to travel outside their home communities was also restricted (Takenaka 2004:92).

These draconian measures were the result of agreements among the foreign ministers of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, the United States, Uruguay, and Venezuela in meetings in Rio de Janeiro. To bolster the security of all North and South America, they also recommended (1) the incarceration of dangerous enemy aliens, (2) the prevention of the descendants of enemy nationals to abuse their rights of citizenship to do things like criticize the government, (3) the regulation of international travel by enemy aliens and their families, and (4) the prevention of all acts of potential political aggression by enemy aliens, such as espionage, sabotage, and subversive propaganda (Gardiner 1981: 17).

==Japanese schools in Peru==
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2015}}
27 Japanese schools were founded in Peru (before the Second World War), which used school curricula created especially for overseas Japanese.
The first Japanese school in Peru was founded in 1908 inside the Santa Barbara in the province of Canete. 
Many Japanese immigrants, with enough economic resources (or, in some cases, with little money but many children), could afford to send their children to Japan to study. 
This "exodus" of children prompted Andes Jiho newspaper to suggest, in 1914, the foundation of a local Japanese school in Lima in order to decrease the number of children who were sent to Japan to study. 
Six years later, in 1920, Lima Nikko was founded, which was the most important school in the Japanese society in Peru, because it was the first Japanese school with authorization to operate in Latin America given by the Ministry of Education of Japan. 
In Lima Nikko, as well as other local Japanese schools, classes were given both in Japanese and Spanish, and teaching, especially, Japanese history and culture.{{fact|date=October 2015}}

==Japanese-Peruvians and the United States==
{{unsourced section|date=April 2016}}
According to Gardiner (in Hirabayashi and Yano 2006: 160), 2,264 Latin Americans of Japanese descent were deported to the United States in 1942. Among those, at least 1,800 people were from Peru. Those Japanese who were on a “blacklist” at the American embassy in Peru were kidnapped and deported at gunpoint by the Peruvian police to internment camps in Texas and New Mexico. These deported “Japanese” included many people born in Peru (Gardiner 1981: 14-15; Hirabayashi and Kikumura-Yano 2007: 157). At these camps, the Japanese-Peruvians were joined by some 500 Japanese immigrants and their children from eleven other Latin American nations, (i.e., Bolivia,[2] Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama).[3]
It is hard today to discern the precise reasons for these deportations. Patriotic wartime hysteria and political pressure from the United States were major contributing factors, but these simply added to the already extensive patterns of discrimination found in Peru. According to California Democratic congressman [[Xavier Becerra]], one motive behind this action was to use these people as bargaining chips. Becerra and members of the [[Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Latin Americans of Japanese Descent Act]] (S 381 and H.R. 662) claim that some 800 Japanese Latin Americans in these camps were sent to Japan in exchange for captured American soldiers.[4] However, substantive evidence that these exchanges actually took place remains to be documented.

Life in the camps was not only a physical and economic struggle for Japanese-Peruvians, it also involved conflict with both non-Japanese Americans and Japanese Americans. Physically, the internment camps in the United States were like prisons, with residents surrounded by barbed-wire fences with armed guards. Physical conditions, especially at first, were stark. Each camp housed about 10,000 people, and conditions were often crowded. However, the residents gradually organized themselves, and by the end of the war something of a community had grown in each camp. There were newspapers, amateur theaters, schools, and sports teams. Many people had jobs, such as cooks, janitors, or health-care workers. As time passed, some Japanese were given a chance to be released temporarily from the camps to engage in agricultural work in local areas.
But these opportunities were mostly limited to Japanese Americans, most of whom were either first-generation Japanese or their Nisei second-generation children born in the United States. They knew almost nothing about Peru or the Japanese Peruvians, and showed little interest in learning more. The feelings seemed mutual. This was especially true for the Nisei, most of whom thought of themselves simply as Americans or Peruvians and identified with the cultural and social values of their respective host nations. The Japanese minority from Latin America, then, was a minority even in the internment camps.

Toward the end of the war the War Relocation Authority asked all internees over the age of 18—this time including Japanese from Peru—if they were loyal to the United States, and would defend the country against Japan if called upon to do so. Many of the Issei (first generation immigrants), who had been denied American citizenship because of their race, agonized at the prospect of facing parents, friends, and relatives in Japan at gunpoint. However, if they refused to declare loyalty to America they could become stateless. Some second generation Nisei, too, were suspicious of a government that had taken away their rights as American citizens. Not surprisingly, Japanese Peruvians, whose only American experience was their internment, were equally, if not more, hostile. By 1943, after many Japanese Americans had proved loyal to the US by enlisting, the US began drafting Japanese-American men including those who had been denied most of the rights enjoyed by US citizens and been imprisoned. As a result, by the end of the war more than 33,000 Japanese-American men and women had served in the American armed forces.
The West Coast exclusion orders that had barred Japanese Americans from living on the coast were terminated in December, 1944, and the last camp was closed in March 1946. Although no provisions were made to compensate them for the losses they incurred during the war or as a result of internment (except for the $25 that each was given when leaving the camps), Japanese-Americans were free to go anywhere in the country. Many returned to the West Coast. But Japanese-Peruvians who were detained in the United States were neither allowed to return to Peru until 1948. Nor were their belongings returned to them by the Peruvian government following return. Although a few managed to return to Latin America, many were either deported to Japan or reentered the United States from Mexico and applied for a visa to stay in the United States.
In 1988, over 110,000 Japanese Americans who were interned during the war received an official apology from the American government and $20,000 compensation for being incarcerated. However, Japanese Latin Americans who were interned received no apology or compensation. This was because when they were deported from Peru, their passports were taken away by the Peruvian government, and they were classified as "illegal aliens" upon their arrival in the States. Being neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents at that time, they failed to qualify for reparations even though the majority eventually became American citizens after the war. Finally, after a class-action lawsuit, in June 1998 American-interned Latin Americans received an official apology from the U.S. government and nominal compensation of $5000. However, only about 800 Latin Americans accepted this offer, the others simply rejecting it outright.
As mentioned, in summer 2007 a US Senate committee formed a commission to investigate the relocation, internment, and deportation of Latin Americans of Japanese descent during World War II. It estimated that the cost of the investigation would be about $500,000. The sponsors included Senators Daniel Inouye and Daniel Akaka from Hawaii, Ted Stevens and Lisa Murkowski from Alaska, Carl Levin from Michigan, Patrick Leahy from Vermont, and Congressmen, Xavier Becerra, Dan Lungren, and Mike Honda of California and Chris Cannon of Utah. The investigation was originally initiated in 2006 by the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Latin Americans of Japanese Descent Act. It remains to be seen if the commission will come up with a solution that is acceptable to both the US government and the Latin American Japanese victims.

==World War II==
There were around 26,000 immigrants of [[Japan]]ese nationality in [[Peru]] in 1941, the year of the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], marking the beginning of the [[Pacific war]] campaign for the [[United States of America]] in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=jla&gt;Densho, Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University. "[http://www.densho.org/learning/spice/lesson4/4activity4-7handouts.pdf Japanese Latin Americans]," c. 2003, accessed 12 Apr 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 
After the Japanese air raids on [[Pearl Harbor]] and the [[Philippines]], the U.S [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), formed during World War II to coordinate secret espionage activities against the [[Axis Powers]] for the branches of the [[United States Armed Forces]] and the [[United States State Department]], were alarmed at the large Japanese Peruvian community living in [[Peru]], and were also wary of the increasing new arrivals of Japanese nationals to Peru.

Fearing the [[Empire of Japan]] could sooner or later decide to invade the [[Republic of Peru]] and use the southern American country as a landing base for its troops, and its nationals living there as foreign agents against [[United States|the US]], in order to open another military front in the [[American Pacific]], the [[U.S. government]] quickly negotiated with [[Lima]] a political-military alliance agreement in 1942; 1,799&lt;ref name="jla"/&gt;

This political-military alliance provided Peru with new military technology such as military aircraft, tanks, modern infantry equipment, and new boats for the Peruvian Navy, as well as new American bank loans and new investments in the Peruvian economy.

In return, the Americans ordered the Peruvians to track, identify and create ID files for all the Japanese Peruvians living in Peru. Later, at the end of 1942 and during all of 1943 and 1944, the Peruvian government on behalf of the U.S. Government and the OSS organized and started the massive arrests, without warrants and without judicial proceedings or hearings, and the deportation of almost all the Japanese Peruvian community to several American internment camps run by the U.S. Justice Department in the states of Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Georgia and Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Greg. (2001). {{Google books|GCFT3SXwsWQC| ''By Order of the President: FDR and the Internment of Japanese Americans,'' p. 264.|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The enormous groups of Japanese Peruvian forced exiles were initially placed amongst the Japanese-Americans who had been excluded from the US west coast; later they were interned in the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] ([[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]]) facilities in [[Crystal City, Texas]]; [[Kenedy, Texas]]; and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]&lt;ref&gt;Higashide, {{Google books|ORE5wfUNdccC|pp. 157-158.|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese-Peruvians were kept in these "alien detention camps" for more than two years before, through the efforts of civil rights attorney [[Wayne M. Collins]],&lt;ref name="jla"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sfjhw&gt;{{cite web | title=Japanese Americans, the Civil Rights Movement and Beyond|url=http://www.nddcreative.com/sfjhw/sfjhw_pdf/sfjhw_sign2.pdf| accessdate=2009-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; being offered "[[parole]]" relocation to the labor-starved farming community in [[Seabrook, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Higashide, {{Google books|ORE5wfUNdccC| p. 161.|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interned Japanese Peruvian ''[[nisei]]'' in the United States were further separated from the ''issei,'' in part because of distance between the internment camps and in part because the interned nisei knew almost nothing about their parents' homeland and language.&lt;ref&gt;Higashide, {{Google books|ORE5wfUNdccC| p. 219.|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deportation of Japanese Peruvians to the United States also involved expropriation without compensation of their property and other assets in Peru.&lt;ref&gt;Barnhart, Edward N. "Japanese Internees from Peru," ''Pacific Historical Review.'' 31:2, 169-178 (May 1962).&lt;/ref&gt; At war's end, only 79 Japanese Peruvian citizens returned to Peru, and about 400 remained in the United States as "stateless" refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, Karen Lea.

==Japanese-Peruvians in the post-war period==

===Alberto Fujimori (first president of Japanese origins)===
{{Main|Alberto Fujimori}}
[[File:Alberto Fujimori October 1998.JPEG|thumb|right|upright|First Japanese Peruvian President of Peru. October 1998.]]
Although anti-Japanese discrimination in Peru was among the worst in Latin America, in 1990 Alberto Fujimori was elected President, and was reelected in 1995. He was the first person not only of Japanese descent, but of Asian descent, to be elected president outside Asia after Cheddi Jagan of Guyana. In late 2000 Fujimori’s administration was rocked by scandal, and accusations of corruption and human rights violations. While Fujimori was visiting Japan, the Peruvian authorities indicted him. Fujimori’s resignation was announced while he was in Japan. Receiving a faxed resignation letter, the Peruvian Congress refused to accept his resignation, and instead removed him from office. It then barred him from holding any elective office for 10 years and the Congress requested the Japanese government to deport Fujimori to Peru for investigation of his crimes.

While Japan was negotiating his relocation, in spite of the 10-year ban, in 2005 Fujimori sought to run in the presidential election of 2006, but the Peruvian authorities officially disqualified him. After traveling to Chile in 2005, Fujimori was detained by the Chilean authorities. He was released from prison in 2006 but placed under house arrest. The Peruvian government formally requested extradition to face human rights and corruption charges, but the Chilean government rejected the request in 2007 (his extradition is still being decided in the courts). In summer 2007, Fujimori tried to run for a seat in Japan’s Upper House. Running under the banner of the small People’s New Party, he called himself “the last samurai” in campaign videos, and pledged to restore traditional values to government. His 51,411 votes fell far short of winning. These political incidents seem to have set back social progress for people of Japanese descent in Peru.

==''Dekasegi'' Japanese-Peruvians==
{{main|Dekasegi}}

In the 1980s, the Peruvian economy suffered a number of setbacks, and inflation soared as high as 2000% a year at times. In Japan, however, with the economic boom many factories were short of labor. Around this period, the average wage for an unskilled laborer in Japan was about $20,000 per year (Tsuda 1999: 693). This was over 40 times the minimum wage in Peru, and over eight times the salary of many in management.[5] These economic conditions led many people from Peru to seek work in Japan.

Japanese companies in the 1980s hesitated to hire people of different ethnic backgrounds. It was felt that such people might not adapt well to Japanese labor practices. The Japanese government proposed avoiding some of these problems by employing Nikkei (people of Japanese descent born and raised outside Japan) returnees from Latin America, who, it was thought, shared racial and cultural affinities with Japanese. The government issued special work permits to people of Japanese descent going back three generations. These guest workers are commonly called dekasegi[6] (lit. “migratory earners”) workers in Japan.
The results were not quite those anticipated. In the case of Peru, in 1992 Victor Aritomi, the Peruvian ambassador to Japan, said that although it was reported that among the almost 40,000 Japanese-Peruvians—that is, half of the Japanese-Peruvian population—who were then living in Japan, only 15,000 at most were “real” Japanese descendants. The rest—that is, almost two thirds of the “Japanese-Peruvians” in Japan at the time—not only had no primordial tie with Japan, but many did not even “look” particularly Asian.

Part of the reason for this was that many dekasegi workers of Japanese descent in Peru had non-Japanese spouses. Since the Japanese government had issued work permits to nuclear family members of dekasegi workers in 1990, the actual composition of the group was not limited to people of Japanese descent.
According to Yanagida (1997: 297), about 30% of Nikkei couples in Peru with a spouse of Latin American origin had dekasegi experiences in 1995. This compares with only 9% of couples in which both partners were Nikkei who had dekasegi experiences at that time. Hearing of the high wages in Japan, many non-Nikkei Peruvians also wished to go to Japan to work. These non-Nikkei people used one of three strategies to obtain dekasegi work permits: (1) become a spouse of a Nikkei, (2) become an adopted child of a Nikkei family, or (3) become Nikkei through use of false or spurious documents—usually Japanese koseki (the Japanese registration of one’s birth and parentage). According to a Spanish correspondent in Tokyo, Montse Watkins, her non-Nikkei Peruvian interviewees paid between one and three thousand US dollars to “become” an adopted child of a Nikkei Peruvian (Watkins 1994: 112, 131, 135). The price of adoption differed depending on the family; however several thousand dollars seems to have been common.

In 1990 one municipal office of a township in Lima received 2,000 adoption registration documents and 500 marriage certificates—including one woman who adopted 60 children in one year (Watkins 1994: 131). Though it is obvious what is going on, the mayor claims that there is no way to stop these irregularities as these Nikkei are not breaking the law: they are free to adopt children or marry who they wish. Even selling and purchasing old koseki birth documents (say, at auction) is not illegal: antique dealers or collectors may simply wish to buy old documents, or papers from a foreign nation written in a foreign language (Fuchigami 1995: 26). Some people who newly and successfully became Nikkei in this way went to Japan to work. Others, however, have been swindled; criminals take their money but never produce the promised documents.

One social issue centers around the “Nikkei-ness” of members of Japanese-Peruvian society. Due to racial discrimination in Peru, some people of Japanese-descent left the Japanese-Peruvian community and assimilated in Peruvian society (Aoki 1997: 96). However, others have remained, worked hard for over a century to maintain Nikkei culture and society, and strived to be both model citizens of Peru and good Japanese.

In 1998 With New strict laws from the Japanese immigration many fake-nikkei were deported or went back to Peru. and The requirements to bring Japanese descendents were more strict including documents as "zairyuushikaku-ninteisyoumeisyo" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moj.go.jp/ONLINE/IMMIGRATION/16-1.html|title=法務省：在留資格認定証明書交付申請|website=www.moj.go.jp|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Certificate of Eligibility for Resident that probes the Japanese blood line of the applicant.

With the onset of the global recession, Among the expatriate communities in Japan, Peruvians accounted for the smallest share of those who returned to their homelands after the global recession began in 2008. People returning from Japan also made up the smallest share of those applying for assistance under the new law. As of the end of November 2013, only three Peruvians who had returned from Japan had received reintegration assistance. The law provides some attractive benefits, but most Peruvians (At present 2015, there are 60,000 Peruvians in Japan )&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/area/peru/data.html#section1] Ministry of Foreign affairs of Japan&lt;/ref&gt; who have regular jobs in Japan weren’t interested in going home.

Peruvians in Japan have come together to offer support for Japanese victims of the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck in March 2011. In the wake of that disaster, the town of Minamisanriku in Miyagi Prefecture lost all but two of its fishing vessels. Peruvians raised money to buy the town new boats as a service to Japan and to express their gratitude for the hospitality received in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nippon.com/en/people/e00054/] Your Doorway to Japan&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Japanese press in Peru==
{{unsourced section|date=April 2016}}

In 1909 '''Nipponjin''' (The Japanese people) was founded, a handwritten newspaper edited by someone with the surname Seki, who was a graduate of the University of Waseda, and who, as a free immigrant, worked at the Cerro de Pasco Corporation in La Oroya. The newspaper appeared about four times. It was written on sulfite paper or “office paper,” which was similar to the wrapping paper used in small businesses. The edition consisted of only one copy of thirty to forty pages that was held together by a string that served as a fastener of sorts.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

Between 1910 and 1913, when 2473 Japanese arrived in Peru, there appeared another handwritten newspaper that was printed and distributed on mimeograph paper: '''Jiritsu''' (The Independent), whose format was 18x23 centimeters with each edition averaging some seventy-two pages, which also were fastened together with a string. Its printing on mimeograph made it possible for greater distribution than its predecessor. It ended in 1913, the same year that the emperor Taisho, grandfather of the current Japanese emperor, celebrated one year on the throne.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

In June 1921, '''Nippi Shimpo''' (Japanese-Peruvian News) was published by Jutaro Tanaka, Teisuke Okubo, Noboru Kitahara, Kohei Mitsumori and Chijiwa.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

January 1, 1929, '''Perú Nichi Nichi Shimbun''' (Daily News of Peru), with the goal of taking part in the debate. It was understood that the Japanese readership should neither be polarized nor silent witnesses in the polemic that had sustained the other two newspapers. This new publication was directed by Susumu Sakuray.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

Jutaro Tanaka, one of the publishers of Nippi Shimpo, managed to merge three newspapers and publish '''Lima Nippo''' (Daily Bulletin of Lima). He argued that for such a small community it was not necessary to waste such efforts publishing three newspapers; rather, it was better to save supplies and offer the readership one good newspaper. This is how the newspaper was born in July 1929; Tanaka himself was named manager of the new company, and Sakuray, the former manager of Andes Jiho and Perú Nichi Nichi Shimbun, was named editor.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

In 1929 '''Peru Jiho''' (Chronicles of Peru), began to circulate in the city, and it was supported by those who had opposed the merger of the original three newspapers. Kuninosuke Yamamoto assumed the leadership for two years, and in 1931, it passed to Hisao Ikeyama, a graduate of the University of Tokyo, who, thanks to his editorials that made the newspaper competitive, managed to stamp his own personal seal on the newspaper. Thereafter, a portion of the paper was published in Spanish, while some of the first Peruvians of Japanese descent worked on the newspaper, including Víctor Tateishi, Luis Okamoto, Julio Matsumura, Alberto Mochizuki, Enrique Shibao and Chihito Saito.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

In July 1941, Susumu Sakuray, who had earlier left the paper Lima Nippo, published the '''Peru Hochi''' (Reports of Peru), which now brought the number of newspapers circulating in the community back to three. It was World War II, and there was great interest in getting the most recent news coming out of Europe and then Asia. However, when Japan became involved in the war and Peru declared war against Japan, the Peruvian government closed down and confiscated Japanese newspapers. The government also deported the major players in the Japanese community, including those Japanese who had become Peruvian citizens, as well as Peruvians of Japanese descent.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

For almost a decade there were no Japanese-language newspapers circulating in Peru until July 1, 1950, when '''Peru Shimpo''' (Recent News from Peru) appeared, which remains in circulation today, and whose publication was authorized by Ministerial Resolution 107 of July 1, 1948. Peru Shimpo, just like Andes Jiho in 1913, was a product of donations gathered from among the members of the Japanese community. The organization for fundraising, as well as the donations lasted two years. With the proceeds the editors purchased machinery and the necessary typography, both of which arrived in Peru in February 1950.
Diro Hasegawa was elected president of the board of directors, Masao Sawada as manager and Hiromu Sakuray as administrator and translator. The head of workshop was Kaname Ito, while some of the writers were Junji Kimura, Giei Higa, and Chihito Saito. Saito was also in charge of the Spanish section of the newspaper.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

After a year in circulation, Peru Shimpo Press acquired office space in Lima downtown. At the end of the 1990s, the Japanese philanthropist, Ryoichi Jinnai, donated to the press a second-hand offset machine that remains in use today. At the start of the new century, the press relocated to Bellavista, Callao.
The publication was printed in the standard format and had four pages. In the beginning moveable type characterized the process. Later, the publication increased to eight pages. In 2006 a new design system was introduced along with color pages and in 2010 Peru Shimpo became a tabloid.
In 2006 Peru Shimpo modernized its design and introduced color. Alan García, the president of Peru, sent prepared remarks to the Nikkei community that was published there.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

On October 1, 1955, which is to say, five years after the start date of Peru Shimpo, a second Japanese newspaper appeared in the post-war era: '''Peru Asahi Shimbun''' (Morning in Peru). Ryoko Kiyohiro was in charge of editing the Japanese sections and Víctor Hayashi the Spanish ones. The newspaper circulated until March 1964 when it shut down due to financial problems.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

'''Prensa Nikkei''' (Nikkei Press) appeared in 1985 and remains as the only Spanish-language tabloid in circulation.{{cn|date=April 2016}}


==Traditions and customs==
After the ravages of World War II, the Peruvian Nikkei community continued with its activities, mainly through the practice of traditions inherited from their ancestors. Thus, festivities such as the celebration of the New Year (Shinnenkai), Girls' Day (Hinamatsuri), Children's Day (Kodomo no Hi), Matsuri, Buddhist festivals such as the Obon and Ohigan, among others, continue preserved in the Nikkei community.

The Nikkei in Peru have also known how to preserve precisely some of the customs and traditions brought by their parents and grandparents, and that they are part of their natural heritage. At the same time, Peruvians of Japanese descent, previously seen as a "closed" community, are today citizens who perform in all fields. Their roots and origins are part of their memories and experiences that undoubtedly enrich their identity as Peruvians. Currently, the Peruvian-Japanese are one of the largest Nikkei communities in the world and the second largest in Latin America. Japanese-Peruvians mainly inhabit the central Peruvian coast (Lima and Trujillo has the most of them) and in some villages in the Amazon area.

==The Nikkei cuisine==

The cuisine of Peru is a heterogeneous mixture of the diverse cultural influences that enriched the South American country. An important influence was the Japanese immigrants and their descendants through the combination of Japanese and Peruvian cuisine known as Nikkei cuisine which has become a gastronomic sensation in many countries.

The particular roots of this fusion lies in the importance of fresh products, encouraged by the prosperous fishing industry of Peru, the Japanese knew how to use fresh fish and mix it perfectly with the ceviche, which is the Peruvian flag dish. As well with the Chifa (fusion cuisine that emerged from the Chinese community in Peru), Japanese dishes were combined with the flavors and cooking techniques of the indigenous Peruvians. Thus, fresh fish was combined with limes, corn, chili, cassava and the many varieties of potatoes, basic products in the Peruvian pantry.

The most notable promoter of Nikkei cuisine is perhaps Nobu Matsuhisa, who has been using elements of this fusion cuisine since the late 1980s in his different restaurants around the world. Nobu, as he is known in the culinary field, although he was an early exponent of Nikkei cuisine has only recently been picked up by several high-profile chefs in Europe, thanks in part to the success of Peruvian food throughout the continent. The most famous of these chefs is Ferran Adrià, he opened a restaurant in Barcelona, where the Nikkei kitchen is used as the basis for a range of culinary experimentation. In London there are also Nikkei restaurants, like that of restaurateur Kurt Zdesar, which is reaping very good reviews.  However, Lima is still the home of Nikkei cuisine, which is the best place to enjoy the best that this fusion cuisine has to offer.

The '''Jimmy &amp; Rosalynn Carter Work Project''' - formerly the '''Jimmy Carter Work Project''' (JCWP) - is an annual home building blitz organized by [[Habitat for Humanity]] International and its affiliates. It generally takes place in the [[United States]] one year, and an international location the next.&lt;ref name=JCWPmain&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Work Project|url=http://www.habitat.org/how/default_jcwp.aspx|publisher=Habitat for Humanity, International}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carpenter Named Carter Comes to New York"&gt;{{cite news|title=Carpenter Named Carter Comes to New York|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/03/us/carpenter-named-carter-comes-to-new-york.html|newspaper=NY Times|date=September 3, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;  President [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Rosalynn Carter]] helped Habitat volunteers renovate the 19-unit building, and media coverage brought attention to Habitat, which had been founded in 1976 in [[Americus, Georgia]], a short distance from Carter's hometown of [[Plains, Georgia]].&lt;ref name=JCWP09&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 Jimmy Carter Work Project |url=http://www.habitat.org/jcwp/2009/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805031209/http://www.habitat.org/jcwp/2009/ |archivedate=2011-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though President Carter has said repeatedly he never intended to start an annual project, the following year  the Carters returned to the same site to finish the renovation work. On Oct. 10, 2013, as part of the 30th annual project, the Carters returned to the building and met with families living there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 JCWP Event Coverage|url=http://www.habitat.org/cwp/2013/event_coverage/namesake.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2013, the Jimmy &amp; Rosalynn Carter Work Project had helped more than 3,800 families move into safe, affordable shelter in 14 countries. Over the years, more than 89,000 volunteers from all over the world have signed up to build alongside the Carters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eritrean emigrants see homeownership dream come true in San Jose|url=http://www.habitat.org/cwp/2013/event_coverage/Eritrean.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Carter Work Projects started modestly and built slowly. Early projects were held in the United States, and were relatively small compared  to later years.

==1986==
[[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]: Following the first two trips to New York City, the Carters moved on to Chicago, where they helped build a four-unit complex on the city's West Side. They were joined by their daughter, Amy, and celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary — July 7, 1986 — on the build site. In years to come, Carter children and grandchildren would frequently volunteer.&lt;ref name="Carter lends name and sweat to Habitat project"&gt;{{cite news|title=Carter lends name and sweat to Habitat project|newspaper=United Press International|date=Sep 21, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1987==
[[Charlotte, North Carolina]]: Habitat founder Millard Fuller called Charlotte "The Miracle on 19th Street," and comedian [[Bob Hope]] was among the volunteers who came to build 14 houses in Charlotte's Optimist Park area. This marked the first year the project was held in tandem with a worldwide Habitat House-Raising Week, in which an additional 300 homes were begun.&lt;ref name="JCWP History 1987"&gt;{{cite web|title=JCWP History 1984-1989|url=http://www.habitat.org/how/jcwp_history1.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1988==
[[Atlanta, Georgia]], and [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]:  The 1988 build was the first held in two separate locations — a 200-volunteer, 10-unit renovation project in North Philadelphia, and a 1,000- volunteer, 20-house project in Atlanta's Edgewood neighborhood.&lt;ref name="Non-Profit Housing Group Launches Its Largest Project Yet"&gt;{{cite news|last=Byrd|first=Robert|title=Non-Profit Housing Group Launches Its Largest Project Yet|newspaper=Associated Press|date=June 27, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1989==
[[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]: Plagued with steady, chilly rain, the Milwaukee build was in danger of falling behind schedule. During a live TV interview, President Carter asked for help from local roofers, who started showing up in droves the following morning. They roofed all the houses in one day, and the Milwaukee affiliate received a huge boost in donations and attention that carried it forward. More than 1,000 volunteers finished six homes, and renovated eight others. The broader House-Raising Week in 1989 involved the startup, completion, or rehab of 500 homes.&lt;ref name="Habitat World: A New Vision in Milwaukee"&gt;{{cite web|title=Habitat World: A New Vision in Milwaukee|url=http://www.habitat.org/magazine/article/1989-milwaukee-wisconsin|publisher=Habitat World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1990==
[[Tijuana, Mexico]], and [[San Diego, California]]: By venturing across the border, the Carter Work Project became international for the first time. Nearly 2,000 volunteers lived in a four-acre tent city and divided their time between Tijuana and San Diego; the construction site in Tijuana lacked electricity and running water. President Carter called the build "the most complicated and the most gratifying" so far. The project raised 100 homes in Tijuana and seven in San Diego.&lt;ref name="Orange County Register"&gt;{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Ronald|title=Home is where the heart is: Carter's group descends on Tijuana.|newspaper=Orange County Register|date=June 19, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1991==
[[Miami, Florida]]: Miami's Liberty City erupted in violent riots in 1980 that decimated the neighborhood, and President Carter toured the devastation while in office. More than a decade later he came back to personally rebuild, working on 14 houses and a day care center. "I really enjoyed how all the volunteers, both white and black, came together and helped build for the project," said homeowner Virginia Marshal, who was still living in her Habitat home more than 20 years later.&lt;ref name="JCWP History 1990-1993"&gt;{{cite web|title=JCWP History 1990-1993|url=http://www.habitat.org/how/jcwp_history2.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1992==
[[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Baltimore, Maryland]]:  "Habitat is not a charity organization. We don't believe that the best way to help people is to give them a Santa Claus gift," President Carter said at the groundbreaking ceremony in Washington, D.C. After five days of blitz building, with an international pool of volunteers hammering away, 20 new homeowners in Baltimore and Washington were ready to move in.

==1993==
[[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], and Waterloo, [[Ontario, Canada]]. Canadians from more than 50 communities poured into Winnipeg and Waterloo to build 28 new homes in the first completely international Carter Work Project.

==1994==
[[Eagle Butte, South Dakota]]: President Carter specifically asked to build on a Native American reservation, so the 11th Carter Work Project headed to rural South Dakota. Volunteers slept in tents pitched on the local high school's football field, while the Carters stayed nearby in a traditional teepee provided by the Sioux Indians. Emmanuel Joseph Red Bear II said it was "a dream come true" to build his own home alongside the Carters. Despite heavy storms, the volunteers built 30 new homes on the reservation.&lt;ref name="JCWP History: 1994-1996"&gt;{{cite web|title=JCWP History: 1994-1996 |url=http://www.habitat.org/lc/cwp/1997/history3.html }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1995==
[[Watts, Los Angeles, California]]:  Although the Carters concentrated as always on building one home — for Max and Toni Nettles — they hammered ceremonial nails into all 21 houses along East Santa Ana Boulevard in Watts.  More than 1,500 volunteers from 39 states and five countries worked at the project, which  was accompanied by an accelerated build at five other southern California affiliates.

==1996==
Vac, [[Hungary]]: As President, Carter had returned Hungary's national crown jewels, which had been taken by the Nazis and later confiscated by U.S. forces to keep them out of Soviet hands. When the project looked toward expanding into Europe, he suggested Hungary. The picturesque small town of Vac (pronounced "Votz"), in a bend of the [[Danube River]] a little north of Budapest, was the "most beautiful" project site, he would later say. An international team of 500 volunteers built 10 houses.

==1997==
[[Eastern Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]]: The Appalachian project "Hammering in the Hills" had beautiful backdrops, but the poverty there ran deep. Households in the eight communities served had an average income of less than $13,000 a year, and more than 16 percent lacked indoor plumbing. Among the volunteers participating during the week: First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.&lt;ref name="1997 JCWP Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=1997 JCWP Website |url=http://www.habitat.org/lc/cwp/1997/ }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The JCWP and affiliated construction around the region built more than 200 new homes, some in partnership with the Federation of Appalachian Housing Enterprises.

==1998==
[[Houston, Texas]]:  The heat soared well into triple digits — a thermometer read 110 degrees on the house where Rosalynn Carter was working in Houston. But the building went on. "I think just the fact that people have a home does something for their self-esteem," she said at the site. President Carter added, "They often get new ambition. They have seen success, and they have seen a promise kept at least one time in their lives." About 6,000 volunteers built 100 homes.&lt;ref name="JCWP History: 1998"&gt;{{cite web|title=JCWP History: 1998 |url=http://www.habitat.org/lc/cwp/1998/ }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; That included 25 local prison inmates, six of whom were hired by the local Habitat affiliate after the completion of their sentences.&lt;ref name="National Crime Prevention Council"&gt;{{cite journal|title="Faith Community and Criminal Justice Collaboration: A Collection of".|journal=National Crime Prevention Council.|page=22|accessdate=2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1999==
[[The Philippines]]: The theme in Tagalog was "Magbayanihan Tayo — "Let us build together" — for the largest and most complicated Carter Work Project ever, with 293 houses at six sites and 14,000 volunteers. Filipino media covered the project relentlessly; more than 150 journalists jockeyed behind a fence to get shots of the Carters as they built simple homes made of concrete blocks with galvanized metal roofs and louvered glass windows.&lt;ref name="1999 JCWP Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=1999 JCWP Website |url=http://www.habitat.org/lc/cwp/1999/ }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2000==
New York, New York; [[Jacksonville, Florida]]; and [[Sumter County, Georgia]]: "I didn't think we'd come a second year. I never had any concept it would expand," President Carter told volunteers when the project returned to New York. The Carters and volunteers built 157 houses, including Habitat's 100,000th house in [[Harlem]], and then its 100,001st house in Plains, Georgia, their hometown. Among the celebrities lending a hand: actress [[Susan Sarandon]], who said, "It's a gift to participate in something like this." &lt;ref name="2000 JCWP Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=2000 JCWP Website |url=http://www.habitat.org/lc/cwp/2000/ }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2001==
[[South Korea]]. President Carter first visited South Korea in 1950 as a young submarine officer, and later returned as president and humanitarian. The project's main location, Asan, was dubbed Reconciliation Village, and Carter, in his remarks to volunteers, spoke to that theme: "One word I've heard in South Korea more than any other word is 'reconciliation.' I look on Habitat for Humanity as a movement for reconciliation, a breaking down of barriers… between the rich and the poor." Nine thousand volunteers — including South Korean President [[Kim Dae-Jung]] — built 136 houses.&lt;ref name="2001 JCWP Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=2000 JCWP Website|url=http://www.habitat.org/lc/cwp/2001/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2002==
[[Durban|Durban, Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa]]: Less than a decade after the end of legalized racism in South Africa, blacks and whites built side by side in a neighborhood that had been gutted by the government during apartheid. At the opening ceremony, President Carter said he, too, had grown up in a segregated society, and felt a connection to South Africa. "Our family has always been close to this great country," he said. "We'll be working hand in hand together."  Volunteers at the first African project included the presidents of [[Kenya]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Malawi]], and Gracia Machel, wife of former South African president [[Nelson Mandela]].&lt;ref name="2002 JCWP Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=2002 JCWP Website |url=http://www.habitat.org/lc/cwp/2002/ }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2003==
[[LaGrange, Georgia|LaGrange]] and [[Valdosta]], Georgia; and [[Anniston, Alabama]]: Heavy rains created ankle-deep mud and alternated with a brutal summer sun as the Carters worked at three build sites, all of them less than 200 miles from their home in Plains, Georgia. Volunteers built 92 houses in 2003.&lt;ref name="2003 JCWP Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=2003 JCWP Website |url=http://www.habitat.org/lc/cwp/2003/ }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2004==
[[Puebla]] and [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz, Mexico]]: About 4,000 volunteers built 150 homes in the two Mexican cities.&lt;ref name="2004 JCWP Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=2004 JCWP Website |url=http://www.habitat.org/lc/cwp/2004/ }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2005==
[[Benton Harbor]] and [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]; and [[Windsor, Ontario, Canada]]. Volunteers built 280 homes on this dual-country build, which was documented by the DIY Network in the series "Habitat Homes: Jimmy Carter Work Project". When volunteers showed up Monday morning at the Benton Harbor build site, they found a Labrador mix puppy with no owner. The whole crew adopted her and named her Rosy, for Rosalynn Carter; a volunteer eventually gave her a permanent home.&lt;ref name="2005 JCWP Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=2005 JCWP Website |url=http://www.habitat.org/lc/cwp/2005/ }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2006==
Lonavala, [[Maharashtra, India]]:  In a village not far from where Lillian Carter had once volunteered for the Peace Corps, her son welcomed 2,000 volunteers to build. Among them: actor [[Brad Pitt]], actor [[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]], cricket star [[Steve Waugh]], and former Miss World [[Diana Hayden]]. "I think it's been fun for everyone to have such high-profile people on site," said HFHI CEO Jonathan Reckford. "But their participation helps draw more attention to what Habitat is doing, not only in India, but all across the world." &lt;ref name="2006 JCWP Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=2006 JCWP Website|url=http://www.habitat.org/lc/cwp/2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2007==
Los Angeles and [[San Pedro, California]]: Although known for new home construction, the Carter Work Project, like Habitat, has embraced new ways of helping people and of mobilizing against poverty housing. In 2007, volunteers repaired 35 Los Angeles homes as part of Habitat's A Brush With Kindness program, in addition to building 30 townhomes and  condos.&lt;ref name="2007 JCWP Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=2007 JCWP Website |url=http://stage.habitat.org/lc/cwp/2007/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2008==
[[U.S. Gulf Coast]]: During the 25th annual build, nearly 20 Habitat affiliates along the Gulf Coast built new housing in areas that had been hit by [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005. More than 2,000 volunteers helped build houses with 250 families. The project was officially renamed the Jimmy &amp; Rosalynn Carter Work Project. "That's how it always should have been," said President Carter. "She's been my life partner, she's been on every one of these builds right along with me." &lt;ref name="2008 JCWP Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 JCWP Website |url=http://www.habitat.org/lc/cwp/2008 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2009==
[[Mekong River]] Region(China, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam): The Mekong River begins in China and flows south through Laos, Thailand and Cambodia before finding the sea in Vietnam; in 2009 the Carter Work Project built 166 homes throughout all five countries simultaneously. Temperatures in Vietnam climbed into the 90s and many volunteers suffered from the heat, while the weather in Sichuan, China, was so cold that volunteers clustered around portable heaters to get warm.&lt;ref name="2009 JCWP Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 JCWP Website |url=http://www.habitat.org/lc/cwp/2009 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010==
Washington, D.C.; Baltimore, Maryland; [[Twin Cities, Minnesota]]; and [[Birmingham, Alabama]]: In honor of President Carter's 86th birthday, volunteers built and rehabbed 86 homes in four locations in 2010. Among the volunteers was President Carter's former vice president, Walter Mondale, who joined him in Minnesota. The President also joined the Blind Boys of Alabama onstage at the opening ceremony on World Habitat Day to sing "If I Had a Hammer." &lt;ref name="2010 JCWP Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 JCWP Website |url=http://www.habitat.org/lc/cwp/2010/ }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2011==
[[Léogâne Arrondissement|Léogâne, Haiti]]:  Following the devastating 2010 earthquake, the Carters committed to two consecutive projects in Haiti, a country that even before the earthquake was the poorest in the Western hemisphere.&lt;ref name="World Bank Overview: Haiti"&gt;{{cite web|title=World Bank Overview: Haiti|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/haiti/overview}}&lt;/ref&gt; Families had been living in flimsy shelters in a sugar cane field in stifling heat, and were excited as their simple, sturdy new homes went up. Volunteers stayed at a camp called Christianville and were joined by country stars [[Garth Brooks]] and [[Trisha Yearwood]], who not only swung hammers but also entertained the volunteers. At a Veterans Day ceremony on the site, President Carter, a U.S. Navy veteran, held his hard hat over his heart during the playing of "The Star-Spangled Banner." &lt;ref name="2011 JCWP Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 JCWP Website|url=http://www.habitat.org/lc/cwp/2011/default.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012==
Léogâne, Haiti:  The Carters and even more volunteers returned to Christianville and Léogâne to build houses alongside workers from Haven, an Irish nonprofit. On Sunday morning, President Carter held Sunday school in the mess tent for the volunteers, just as he has for years in Plains. At the worksite, many volunteers from 2011 had tearful reunions with Haitian homeowners they had worked with. Habitat and Haven together built 155 new homes in Haiti during the 2012 project.&lt;ref name="2012 JCWP Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 JCWP Website|url=http://www.habitat.org/cwp/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2013==
[[Oakland]] and [[San Jose, California]]; [[Denver, Colorado]]; New York, New York; and [[Union Beach, New Jersey]]: For their 30th project, the Carters worked coast to coast, winding up where it all started, at the Mascot Flats apartment building on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.&lt;ref name="2013 JCWP Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 JCWP Website|url=http://www.habitat.org/cwp/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Oakland on Oct. 7, 2013, 300 volunteers sang "Happy Birthday" to President Carter, who had turned 89 on Oct. 1.&lt;ref name="Event Coverage: 2013 JCWP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Event Coverage: 2013 JCWP|url=http://www.habitat.org/cwp/2013/event_coverage/frame_windows.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2015==
The 32nd annual work project was scheduled to be held in [[Pokhara|Pokhara, Nepal]], November 1–6, 2015.  It was cancelled on October 8, 2015 because of fuel shortages and civil unrest after the announcement of a new constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.habitat.org/ap/about/newsroom/2015-10-8-Carter-Work-Project-in-Nepal-canceled-due-to-shortage-of-fuel-and-essential-supplies-in-the-country|title=Carter Work Project in Nepal canceled due to shortage of fuel and essential supplies in the country|website=Habitat For Humanity|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{International opposition to Apartheid}}
The '''''Lusaka Manifesto''''' (originally the '''''Manifesto on Southern Africa''''') is a document created by the Fifth Summit Conference of East and Central African States which took place between 14 and 16 April 1969 in [[Lusaka]], the capital of [[Zambia]]. Produced at a time when the [[Republic of South Africa]] and its affiliated white-ruled regimes in [[Mozambique]], [[Rhodesia]], and [[Angola]] were relatively strong but politically isolated, the ''[[Manifesto]]'' called upon them  to relinquish white supremacy and minority rule and singled out [[apartheid]] South Africa for violation of human rights. In the ''Manifesto'', which was subsequently adopted both by the [[Organisation of African Unity]] and the [[United Nations]], thirteen Heads of State offered dialogue with the rulers of these Southern African states under the condition that they accept basic principles of human rights and human liberties. They also threatened to support the various [[liberation war]]s if negotiations failed.

The ''Lusaka Manifesto'' represented one of two strategies to deal with white minority rule in Southern Africa: To try to contain violence, preserve the status quo, and improve the humanitarian situation little by little through diplomatic means, small reforms, and compromises. The other strategy, to wage independence wars, would eventually prevail.

==Background==
In the late 1960s South Africa's [[apartheid]] regime became increasingly politically isolated, both internationally and continental. Under Prime Minister [[B.J. Vorster]] it developed the so-called "outward-looking policy", an effort to bind southern African countries economically, and in this way to discourage them from openly criticising its repressive internal politics. This policy first was openly opposed only by [[Tanzania]] under president [[Julius Nyerere]] and [[Zambia]] under [[Kenneth Kaunda]], but their lobbying made the [[United Nations General Assembly]] (UNGA) reject any further dialogue with South Africa.{{sfn|Ndlovu|2004|p=616}}

At that time independence movements had been formed in all white-ruled territories of Southern Africa, either with an explicit commitment to [[guerrilla warfare]] and [[sabotage]] or recently having scaled their activities from passive resistance, petitioning, and lobbying to an openly armed struggle. The [[African National Congress]] (ANC) in South Africa had launched its military wing [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (MK) in 1961. It immediately executed several sabotage acts against the country's infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

|accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South-West Africa [[SWAPO]]'s paramilitary wing, the [[People's Liberation Army of Namibia]] (PLAN) was founded in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Yet South Africa was politically strong at the time of the declaration agreed upon in Lusaka. Its border states except [[Botswana]] were all ruled by white minorities. In the [[United States]], [[National Security Study Memorandum]] number 39, issued by president [[Richard Nixon]] and Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]], had just reiterated that "the Whites in southern Africa [are] there to stay".{{sfn|de St. Jorre|1977|p=64}} Memorandum 39, nicknamed ''[[Tar baby]] memorandum'' for its reluctant acceptance of apartheid and minority rule in order to gain anti-communist allies in Southern Africa, strengthened South Africa's position internationally.{{sfn|Shamuyarira|1977|p=247}}

Prime Minister Vorster had had a secret conversation with Kaunda for some time since 1968, eventually leading to the ''Manifesto''.{{sfn|Shamuyarira|1977|p=247}} A threat to reveal existence and content of this conversation was issued by Vorster to influence Kaunda's public presentation of South African politics. When Kaunda did not react, Vorster published the complete exchange{{sfn|de St. Jorre|1977|p=68}} and later in 1970 confirmed it in the South African parliament.{{sfn|Shamuyarira|1977|p=252}}

==Content==
The ''Manifesto'' starts with a declaration on human rights and equality{{sfn|de St. Jorre|1977|p=62}} and specifically rejects racial discrimination, both the then existing White [[reverse racism|minority racism]] against Blacks and discrimination by Blacks against Whites, a widespread fear of the White minorities at that time.{{sfn|Grundy|1973|p=115}} It further offers dialogue to the White regime in South Africa, stating that the signatories would "negotiate rather than destroy, talk rather than kill".{{sfn|Ndlovu|2004|p=617}}

For [[Namibia]], Mozambique, Rhodesia and Angola the ''Manifesto'' called for self-determination and the establishment of [[majority rule]].{{sfn|de St. Jorre|1977|p=63}} For South Africa its tone was sharper, and its recommendations went much further, including the suggestion to expel South Africa from all international political and economic bodies. This distinction between the suggested treatment of South Africa and the other white-ruled territories also contained an acknowledgement of South Africa's status as an independent, sovereign UN member, while Namibia, Mozambique, Rhodesia and Angola were colonies without recognition as states.{{sfn|Macmillan|2013|p=68}}

==Significance==

The significance of the ''Lusaka Manifesto'' has been compared to that of the [[Magna Carta]] and the [[Freedom Charter]]. The liberalism expressed in it was in direct opposition to South African apartheid which saw rights and liberties of individual people as tantamount to communism, and as irreconcilable with its own nationalist policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The OAU issued several other documents after the ''Lusaka Manifesto'' that concerned the situation in South Africa, for instance the ''Mogadishu Declaration'' of 1970 and the ''Dar es Salaam Declaration'' of 1974. They were mainly updates, without a real diversion from the ''Manifesto''{{'s}} general direction,{{sfn|Shamuyarira|1977|p=247}} although, in reaction to South Africa's complete rejection of the original document, they are written in a decisively tenser tone and stress much more the support of armed liberation movements.{{sfn|Grundy|1973|pp=116–117}}

==Reception==
North America and former colonial powers in Europe positively received the ''Lusaka Manifesto'', reportedly "because Africa argued, not shouted".{{sfn|Shamuyarira|1977|p=249}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The manifesto was a document in the moderate line of thought on how to improve the situation of Blacks in Southern Africa. It acknowledged the right of all the whites who had settled in southern Africa to stay there. It recognized South Africa as a sovereign and independent state and proposed no changes of boundaries. It advocated boycott and isolation, rather than armed intervention or internal revolt, in South Africa. Above all, it urged negotiation and accepted that change could not come overnight.{{sfn|de St. Jorre|1977|p=63}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Lusaka Manifesto'' has been criticised for not involving any of the contemporary liberation movements and, more generally, of entrenching capitalism on the African continent rather than supporting the various socialist movements of that time.{{sfn|Ndlovu|2004|p=617}}

The White South African regime rejected the document.{{sfn|de St. Jorre|1977|p=63}} The ANC was likewise opposed to the ''Lusaka Manifesto'' as in their view the declaration legitimised the apartheid regime, pronouncing its status as a sovereign and independent UN-recognised entity. They further criticised that the call for a peaceful resolution came at a time South Africa intervened militarily in Rhodesia, and that the Manifesto's wording artificially separated the liberation struggles in South Africa, South-West Africa, and Rhodesia.{{sfn|Ndlovu|2004|p=617}} In 1971 the ANC stated that:{{sfn|Ndlovu|2004|p=620}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is a tragedy that now—when black South Africa is launching an unflinching, full scale armed struggle against Vorster and his henchmen—African States [...] have seen it fit to have a 'dialogue' with white South Africa [...] If there should be a dialogue it should be between Voster and the real leaders of the people, [[Nelson Mandela|Mandela]], [[Walter Sisulu|Sisulu]], [[Govan Mbeki|Mbeki]], [[Ahmed Kathrada|Kathrada]], [[Bram Fischer|Fischer]], [[Elias Motsoaledi|Motsoaledi]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
ANC's main disappointment, though, was that its armed struggle, and that of its likeminded liberation movements [[FRELIMO]], [[MPLA]], [[SWAPO]], [[ZANU]], and [[ZAPU]] was not directly supported and rather seen as a possible future legitimate action, even if it already was in full swing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In the spirit of the ''Manifesto'', Namibia conducted the [[Turnhalle Constitutional Conference]] between 1975 and 1977, an event widely criticised for providing "pseudo-reforms"{{sfn|Napierala|2010|p=16}} entrenching the racial segregation of Namibia's population, and indirectly reinforcing the economic and political power of the white population.{{sfn|Landis|1977|p=21}} Several black delegates, however, welcomed the start of institutionalised communication between the parties.{{sfn|Seiler|1982|pp=693–694}}

Rhodesia's [[Ian Smith]] entered into several round of talks with ZANU and ZAPU. These were, however, interspersed with military action, at times supported by South Africa. In 1975 the talks finally broke down, and the [[Frontline States]] supported armed liberation from 1976 onwards.{{sfn|Ramdhani|2002|p=7}}

Angola and Mozambique already were in a state of full-scale wars of independence, Angola [[Angolan War of Independence|since 1961]] and Mozambique [[Mozambican War of Independence|since 1964]]. The ''Manifesto'' made no difference to the developments in these countries. After a successful [[coup d'état]] in Portugal on 24 April 1974 the Portuguese colonial power collapsed, and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonies]] were allowed to establish majority-rule governments. This development encouraged liberation movements in other white-ruled territories as well.{{sfn|Shamuyarira|1977|p=248}} Following the [[Alvor Agreement]] in January 1975 Angola became independent in November, ending its war of independence but starting a devastating [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]]. Mozambique likewise became independent in 1975 and saw its own [[Mozambican Civil War|civil war]] from 1977 to 1992.

==Aftermath==
Only a few years after the ''Lusaka Manifesto'' the buffer of white-ruled countries north of South Africa disintegrated rapidly, forcing the apartheid regime to take a different course of politics.{{sfn|de St. Jorre|1977}} Mid 1976 uprisings in [[Soweto uprising|Soweto]] and [[Gulguleto uprising|Gulguleto]] brought the country to the brink of a civil war. The [[Southern African Development Coordination Conference]] (SADCC), the predecessor of today's [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) was founded in 1980 in order to "reduce member states' dependence, particularly, but not only, on apartheid South Africa".&lt;ref name=SADC&gt;{{Cite web
|title=History and treaty
|publisher=[[Southern African Development Community|SADC]]
|url=http://www.sadc.int/about-sadc/overview/history-and-treaty/
|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The white rulers of South Africa eventually relinquished power to the black majority in 1994 but instead of acting on the moderate suggestions of the ''Manifesto'' faced independence wars in all affected countries.

'''Lydia Cabrera''' (May 20, 1899 in [[Havana, Cuba]] – September 19, 1991 in [[Miami, Florida]]) was a [[Cuba]]n [[anthropology|anthropologist]].

Cabrera was a Cuban writer and literary activist. She was an authority on [[Santería]] and other [[Afro-Cuban]] [[religion]]s. During her lifetime she published over one hundred books; little if any of her work is available in [[English language|English]]. Her most important book is ''El Monte'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: "The Wilderness"), which was the first major anthropological study of Afro-Cuban traditions. Published in 1954, the book became a "bible" for Santeros who practice Santeria, a blend of Catholic teachings and native African religions that evolved among former African slaves in the Caribbean. She donated her research collection to the [[library]] of the [[University of Miami]]. A section in Guillermo Cabrera Infante's book ''Tres Tigres Tristes'' is written under Lydia Cabrera's name, in a comical rendition of her literary voice. She was one of the first writers to recognize and make public the richness of Afro-Cuban culture. She made valuable contributions in the areas of literature, anthropology, and ethnology.

In El Monte, Cabrera fully described the major Afro-Cuban religions: the Regla de Ocha (commonly known as Santeria) and the Ifa’ cult, which are both derived from traditional Yoruba religion; and Palo Monte, which originated in Central Africa.
Both the literary and anthropological perspectives on Cabrera’s work assume that she wrote about mainly oral, practical religions with only an “embryonic” written tradition. She is credited by literary critics for having transformed Afro-Cuban oral narratives into literature, which is, written works of art, while anthropologists rely on her accounts of oral information collected during interviews with santeros, babalaos, or paleros, and on her descriptions of religious ceremonies.
There is a dialectical relationship between Afro-Cuban religious writing and Cabrera’s work; she used a religious writing tradition that has now internalized her own ethnography.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Havana]] in 1899 as the youngest of eight siblings, Cabrera came from a Cuban family of social and financial privilege in pre-revolutionary Cuba. Her father, Raimundo Cabrera, was a writer, lawyer, prominent man in society, and an advocate for Cuba's independence. Her mother, Elisa Marcaida Casanova, was a housewife and respected socialite. Her father was also the president of the first Cuban corporation, La Sociedad Económica de Amigos del País, founded in the eighteenth century. He owned a popular literary journal, ''Cuba y America'', where Lydia got her first experience as a writer. At the age of thirteen, Cabrera wrote a weekly anonymous column that appeared in her father's journal. She covered topics relevant to her specific community, such as wedding announcements, childbirths, or obituaries.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez-Mangual, E. "Introduction," ''Lydia Cabrera and the Construction of an Afro-Cuban Cultural Identity''. Chapel Hill: [[The University of North Carolina Press]], 2004: 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The family had many Afro-Cuban servants and child caretakers, through whom young Lydia learned about African folklore, stories, tradition, and religions. Like the majority of wealthy Cubans in the early 1900s, private [[tutors]] came to the home of the Cabreras to educate the children. For a short period of time, she attended the private school of Maria Luisa Dolz. At that time it was not socially acceptable for a woman to pursue a high school [[diploma]], so Cabrera finished her secondary education on her own.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez-Mangual, E. "Introduction," 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1927 Cabrera found herself wanting to make money on her own and she wanted to become independent of her family. She moved to [[Paris]] to study art and religion at L'Ecole du Louvre &lt;ref&gt;"Lydia Cabrera," ''Encyclopedia of Cuba: People, history, culture''. Ed. Luis Martinez Fernandez 1st Vol. Westport: Greenwood Press, 2003: 321.&lt;/ref&gt; She studied drawing and painting in Paris with theatrical Russian exile Alexandra Exter. Cabrera lived in Paris for 11 years and returned home in 1938. After graduating from [[Ecole du Louvre]], she chose not to become an artist as expected. Instead she chose to move back to Cuba to study [[Afro-Cuban]] culture, especially their [[traditions]] and [[folklore]].

In 1936, while in Paris, she published her first book, "Cuentos Negros".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Great_Houses_of_Havana.html?id=Tu3xtgAACAAJ&amp;hl=en|title=Great Houses of Havana: A Century of Cuban Style|last=Mallea|first=Hermes|date=2011|publisher=Monacelli Press|isbn=9781580932882|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in Afrocubanismo and the preservation of Afro-Cuban culture==

For almost all of her life, Cabrera possessed a large interest in [[Afro-Cuban]] culture. She had been introduced to their folklore at a very young age by her Afro-Cuban nanny and Afro-Cuban seamstress. Three factors influenced her decision to study Afrocubanismo as an adult. The first influence was her experience in [[Europe]], where studying [[African culture|African]] art became very popular. Secondly she was influenced by her studies in [[Paris]], where she began to see the large influence that African art had on [[Cuban art]]. Thirdly she had as a companion [[Teresa de la Parra]], a Venezuelan novelist and socialite whom she met while studying in Europe, and who enjoyed reading Cuban books with her. They often studied about the island together.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez-Mangual, E. "Introduction," 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

With her focus on thoroughly exploring Afro-Cuban culture, she returned to [[Cuba]] in 1930. She moved to a ranch, La Quinta San Jose, in the suburb of [[Havana]], Marianao, located just outside the [[barrio]] Pogolotti where she conducted most her research on Afro-Cuban culture.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez-Mangual, E. "Introduction," 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1937 and 1948, she published her second book of short stories ''Por Que...Cuentos negros de Cuba''. For this collection, she participated in the culture of the Afro-Cubans and recorded their religious [[rituals]] and traditions.

During the late 1950s she continued to publish several books about Afro-Cuban religions, especially focusing on the [[Abakuá]]s. Being a secret society, the Abakuás were reluctant to talk to her about their religion.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez-Mangual, E. "Introduction," 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Since they did not accept women as members, Cabrera relied on the use of interviews to gain information for her book. It focused on the origins of the group, the myth of Sikaneke, and the hierarchy of its members. Somehow she managed to photograph their sacred drum, which is supposed to remain hidden at all times, to include within her research.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez-Mangual, E. "Introduction," 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main work themes==

Her career spanned decades before the [[Revolution]], as well as many years after the revolution in Cuba. Although she was never schooled in [[anthropology]], she takes a very anthropological approach to studying her subject matter. The main theme in her work is the focus on to the once-marginalized Afro-Cubans, giving them a respectable identity. Through the use of imagery and storytelling in her work, she seeks to retell the history of the Cuban people through the Afro-Cuban lens.&lt;ref&gt;"Lydia Cabrera," 322.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, her work blurs the line between what society has deemed as "fact" and "fiction." &lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez-Mangual, E. "Introduction," 4.&lt;/ref&gt; She attempts to pose ideas and theories that force one to question what they have been told.In Afro-Cuban Tales = Cuentos Negros De Cuba, She writes,  "They dance when they're born, they dance when they die, they dance for killings. They celebrate everything!" (Cabrera 67). Here, she is connecting Afro-Cuban tales with African rituals because it is important to celebrate birth, passage to adulthood, marriage, and death.

==Coming to the United States==

She left the country in 1960 shortly after the revolution and never returned. She left  as an [[exile]], first going to Madrid and later settling in Miami, FL., where she remained  the rest of her life. Ms. Cabrera received several honorary doctorate degrees, including one from the University of Miami in 1987. Cabrera describes her stories as "transpositions," but they went much further than a simple retelling. She recreated and altered elements, characters, and themes of African and universal folklore, but she also modified the traditional stories by adding details of Cuban customs of the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Toward the last years of her life, Lydia Cabrera worked diligently to edit and publish the many notes she had collected during more than thirty years of research in Cuba.

The real reason why she left is still unknown. Some claim that she left because of the lifestyle the revolution was trying to instill. For many years, Cabrera had stated her dislike for the revolution and [[socialist]]-[[Marxist]] ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez-Mangual, E. "Introduction," 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Others claim she left because members of the Abakuás were hunting her down since she had made their [[secret society]] public.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez-Mangual, E. "Introduction," 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the reason why she left is unknown, she never returned and spent the rest of her life living in Miami until her death in September 19, 1991.

{{Ethnic Macedonians}}

The '''[[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]]''' in [[Montenegro]] form a small minority in the country. The last official census showed that there are 900 Macedonians in Montenegro.&lt;ref name=monstat/&gt; According to the Macedonian associations in Montenegro there are about 2000 Macedonians living in Montenegro.&lt;ref name=miaen/&gt;

== History of the Macedonians in Montenegro ==

By 1948, 133 Macedonians lived in Montenegro, this number rose to 875 in 1981. 1,072 Macedonians were counted in the 1991 Yugoslav Census, this number had fallen to 819 by 2003. [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] was the mother language of 507 people. The Macedonians were concentrated in [[Podgorica]], [[Herceg Novi]] and [[Tivat]]. There is an estimated 2,500 Macedonians in Montenegro today.

== Organizations ==
The two main organizations of the Macedonians in Montenegro are the ''Association of Montenegrin-Macedonian Friendship'' and the ''National Community of Macedonians in Montenegro'', which was established in 2006.&lt;ref name=miaen/&gt;

The National Community of Macedonians aims to make the Macedonian language more popular in Montenegro and to help Macedonians integrate better into the Montenegrin system and market.&lt;ref name=miamk&gt;[http://www.mia.com.mk/default.aspx?mId=1&amp;vId=78303740&amp;lId=1&amp;title=%d0%9c%d0%90%d0%9a%d0%95%d0%94%d0%9e%d0%9d%d0%98%d0%88%d0%90+-+%d0%92%d0%9d%d0%90%d0%a2%d0%a0%d0%95%d0%a8%d0%9d%d0%90+%d0%9f%d0%9e%d0%9b%d0%98%d0%a2%d0%98%d0%9a%d0%90 Претседателот Иванов се сретна со македонската заедница во Црна Гора] Macedonian Information Agency.

The '''Mbadja''' or Ovambadja is a group of an independent tribe that speaks [[Oshimbadja]] language. They originated from [[:pt:Ombadja|Ombadja]] ([[Município de Ombadja]]) in southern Angola, Cunene Province (Província do [[Kunene River|Cunene]]).

About 20% of the Mbadja people migrated from south Angola during the years of 1900 into the northern part of Namibia. They occupied an area of land that they named "Okalongo", which translates to "a small country". Although they may confused by some people with the Wambo or Ovawambo tribes, because of their similar way of speaking, the Mbadja people were never recognized as such among the traditional seven Owambo tribes, listed as Kwanyama, Ndonga, Ngandjera, Kwaluudhi, Kolonkadhi, Mbalanhu and Kwambi. The Mbadja are also referred to as "Ovambadja vaNaushona".

Some of the Ovambadja stay in [[Okalongo]] in the [[Omusati region]], Namibia. Like other African tribes, the Mbadja people raise cattle, goats, sheep, pigs and chicken. They cultivate the land to grow [[omahangu]], maize, [[sorghum]], beans, peanuts and watermelons during the rainy season.

Mbadja is part of the Bantu people. The Mbadja ancestors told stories of their origins that tells that they have migrated from "The Land of the Lakes" and moved south centuries ago. It is suspected that the place they refer to is around Lake Tanganyika in Tanzania.

'''Naked hiking''', also known as  '''naked walking''' or '''freehiking''', is a sub-category of the modern form of [[social nudity]], and involves the undertaking of walking activities while [[nudity|naked]].

==Attention and opinion==

[[File:WNBR London 2014 9.jpg|thumb|upright|A naked hiker in London during the [[World Naked Bike Ride]] event, 2014]]
In the United Kingdom, [[Stephen Gough]], known as The Naked Rambler, received much media coverage for walking naked from [[Land's End to John o' Groats]] in 2003–2004 and again in 2005–2006. He was arrested and released several times during both his walks while in England, and was imprisoned in Scotland. 

Conversely to Gough's experiences, in 2005 and 2006 the European Alps were crossed naked during a one-week hiking tour, and there was little media coverage. No one was arrested or troubled, and there was no police involvement. Most naked hikers report friendly reactions from people they meet;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/britain/article/0,2763,1013239,00.html Stephen Moss “Now which way back to the car?”] in ''The Guardian'', August 6, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; however, in some countries where such restrictions exist, the risk of being booked on a charge such as [[public indecency]] is present when hiking in the nude.

Some jurisdictions have regulations formally prohibiting this activity, and can impose fines or other punishments. A local bylaw to this effect was adopted, for example, by the 2009 General Meeting (''[[Landsgemeinde]]'') of the residents of the Swiss canton [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSTRE53Q4VY20090427?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=oddlyEnoughNews Swiss canton bans nude hiking] (Reuters, Mon Apr 27, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In nearby [[Appenzell Ausserrhoden]], the court of second instance "''Obergericht''" reinforced an unpaid fine of 100 [[Swiss franc]]s for naked hiking and added the court's cost of another 3330 Swiss Francs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/panorama/leute/Nacktwanderer-muss-fuer-Ausflug-teuer-bezahlen/story/25749090 "Nude hiker convicted"] (''[[Tages-Anzeiger]]'', Jan 20, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nu da şpagă''''' ("Don't Bribe" in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]) is a national anti-[[political corruption|corruption]] campaign launched in [[Romania]] in 2004 to deal with the problem of corruption in that country. The campaign is co-ordinated by [[Transparency International]] with the support of the [[European Union]], which Romania joined in 2007. Corruption has been a problem in Romania since [[Communist Romania|Communist times]], but the situation has recently improved.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Based on current [[supply and demand]] factors for agricultural [[commodities]] (e.g. changing diets in the [[emerging economies]], [[biofuels]], declining acreage under irrigation, growing [[world population|global population]], stagnant [[agricultural productivity]] growth{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}), some commentators are predicting a long-term annual production shortfall of around 2% which, based on the highly inelastic [[demand curve]] for food crops, could lead to sustained price increases in excess of 10% a year - sufficient to double crop prices in seven years.&lt;ref&gt;Globe Investor at http://www.globeinvestor.com/servlet/WireFeedRedirect?cf=GlobeInvestor/config&amp;date=20080408&amp;archive=nlk&amp;slug=00011064&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Credit Suisse First Boston, Higher Agricultural Prices: Opportunities and Risks, November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Food Production May Have to Double by 2030 - Western Spectator {{cite web |url=http://westernspectator.com/?p=272 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003215717/http://westernspectator.com/?p=272 |archivedate=2009-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture ([[USDA]]) contradict many claims that the country's wheat supply is unstable. According to USDA, in 2014 China imported 1.5 billion tonnes (GT) of wheat, and had relatively small exports of 1 GT. However, China ''produced'' 126 GT of wheat in 2014, according to the same source. For comparison, Egypt was 2014's largest importer, with imports of 10.7 GT. If China had imported more than Egypt, it still would have produced almost 10 times more wheat than it imported, while in fact it produced more than 100 times more.&lt;ref name=CN2014IM&gt;{{cite web|title=China Wheat Production by Year|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/agriculture/?country=cn&amp;commodity=wheat|website=Index Mundi|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan==
Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan have restricted exports and levied tariffs on wheat.  Higher prices are not meeting any opposition from desperate buyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It is the broadcasting that is personal, both in the context of production but also in the feel of the content. In this type of broadcasting, individuals are both editors and directors of its own broadcasting. 

Personal broadcasting is most popularly used by individuals and event holders who want to broadcast one or an event for an audience to watch live over the Internet. Personal broadcasting gives individuals another way to interact with one another, and it gives brands another way to interact with their customers. Individual entrepreneurs use the personal broadcasting to boost their brands among young consumers. 

Personal broadcasting differs from other types of broadcasting in a way that it has no fixed broadcasting time, and the broadcaster can freely choose the broadcasting content. Personal broadcasting is not limited to celebrities and public figures, but is produced by regular people too. Anybody, anywhere, at any time can broadcast themselves or their content for free. The market for personal broadcasting that allows ordinary individuals to broadcast themselves on the Internet is rapidly growing. 

By personal broadcasting, individuals are free to [[stream]] any sort of broadcast they want and attract viewers, who can send real-time comments, or text messages displayed directly across the screens that the broadcaster can see and respond to. In this way, viewers can watch the videos of personal broadcasters and at the same time share their thoughts and feelings with others live. 

Since the beginning of 2000s, personal broadcasting has been gaining a lot of interest from the public and it has become one of [[entertainment]] options. As the popularity of watching video increased, demand for the personal broadcasting was initiated, and the rise of penetration of the [[Smartphone]], equipped with high-definition cameras, and a new generation of video applications, enabled individuals to broadcast straight from one’s own [[mobile device]] whenever they like and wherever they may be.

The widespread supply of different types of broadcasting software, including live-streaming applications, allowed individuals to easily broadcast, and this encouraged the popularity of the personal broadcasting among young generation willing to show their personal lives online for fun or fame. Personal broadcasting lets individuals be engaged in self-branding, turning the private into public.

As a new form of mobile self-expression, personal broadcasting has been popularized in China and in Republic of Korea in particular. 

Despite the increasing number of personal broadcasting services, it lacks proper monitoring systems to look out for any illicit contents.

There have been a number of '''political assassinations in post-apartheid South Africa'''.&lt;ref name="mg.co.za"&gt;[http://mg.co.za/article/2012-08-04-anc-a-party-under-violent-criminal-siege ANC: A party under violent, criminal siege], [[Paul Trewhela]], ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', 4 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quintal, Genevieve (29 July 2012).

Political assassinations have often been ascribed to battles around patronage within the ruling [[African National Congress]].&lt;ref name="dailymaverick.co.za"&gt;[http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-07-23-analysis-the-ancs-provincial-criminal-enterprises-problem The ANC's provincial criminal enterprises problem], by Sipho Hlongwane, ''The Daily Maverick, 23 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2013-01-23-power-money-and-the-anc-there-will-be-blood Power, money and the ANC: There will be blood], Mandy de Waal, ''The Daily Maverick'', 23 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkafricapress.com/south-africa/political-violence-south-africa-growing-pains-democracy-or-adolescence-anc Why Are Political Killings Increasing in South Africa?], James Bullock, ''Think Africa Press'', 21 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=176696 Murder takes party infighting to new level], Setumo Stone, ''Business Day'', 20 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sacsis.org.za"&gt;[http://sacsis.org.za/site/article/575.1 A Culture of Political Assassination], Jane Duncan, ''SACSIS, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacsis.org.za/site/article/744.1 Murder, Lies and Corruption: Mbombela and the Bequeathal of the ANC's 'Family' War], Dale T. McKinely, 9 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all assassinations are a result of conflict within the ruling party. The [[National Freedom Party]] led by Zanele Magwaza-Msibi, with its base largely in KwaZulu-Natal, claims that 21 of its members have been killed since the party was founded in early 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/another-nfp-member-killed-1.1344397#.UA0Yp2HVWFc Another NFP member killed], SAPA, ''IOL, 18 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Inkatha Freedom Party]] claims that ten of its elected representatives have been murdered.&lt;ref name="allafrica.com"&gt;Quintal, Genevieve (29 July 2012). [http://allafrica.com/stories/201207300272.html Political Murders – It's About the Dough], SAPA&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2013 [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]], an autonomous shack dwellers' movement in [[Durban]], claimed that the murder of [[Nkululeko Gwala]], a local leader in the organisation, was a political assassination.&lt;ref name="abahlali1"&gt;[http://www.abahlali.org/node/9840 KZN protest leader shot 12 times], Nkululeko Nene, ''Daily News'', 27 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2013-07-31-kzn-anatomy-of-an-assassination KZN: Anatomy of an assassination], Niki Moore, ''Daily Maverick'', 31 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016 two ANC councillors were convicted of murder following the assassination of [[Thuli Ndlovu]], also a local leader in Abahlali baseMjondolo .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/anc-councillors-jailed-for-activists-murder-2024406 ANC councillors jailed for activist’s murder], Giordano Stolley, ''Independent Online'', 20 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Raymond Suttner]] "assassinations have become a regularised way of deciding on leadership and access to wealth within the ANC and its allies".&lt;ref&gt;[http://raymondsuttner.com/2013/08/18/raymond-suttner-government-and-tripartite-alliance-no-pitch-at-marikana-memorial Government and tripartite alliance ‘no pitch’ at Marikana memorial], 18 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the ANC Secretary General, [[Gwede Mantashe]] said: "The reality is that selection of candidates for council is always a life-and-death issue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.businesslive.co.za/rdm/politics/2016-02-29-political-assassinations-are-on-the-rise Political Assassinations are on the rise], Gareth van Olsen, "Rand Daily Mail", 20 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; But assassinations are only the most extreme tip of the iceberg of violence that surrounds South African elections. [[David Bruce (political researcher)|David Bruce]] published an extensive report on the 2014 election pointing to the subtle and complex ways in which the ANC intimidates its political rivals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nelsonmandela.org/uploads/files/intimidation-in-elections.pdf] Just singing and dancing? Intimidation and the manipulation of voters and the electoral process in the build-up to the 2014 elections. Community Agency for Social Enquiry, April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In the run up to the 2014 election the [[Independent Electoral Commission]] did little to intervene to prevent violence, the abuse of government rescources and the use of the state run media (the SABC) to favour the ruling party. &lt;ref&gt;[https://commonwealth-opinion.blogs.sas.ac.uk/2018/democracy-and-violence-the-threat-to-south-africas-elections/ Democracy and violence: the threat to South Africa’s elections, Martin Plaut, Institute of Commonwealth Studies, 2 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

In recent years South Africa has also seen the rise of the professional assassin. [[Professor Mark Shaw]] and [[Kim Thomas]] of the University of Cape Town produced a paper ‘The commercialisation of assassination: hits and contract killing in South Africa, 2000-2015.’ &lt;ref&gt;[https://academic.oup.com/afraf/article-abstract/116/465/597/2605670?redirectedFrom=fulltext] The commercialisation of assassination: hits and contract killing in South Africa, 2000-2015. Professor Mark Shaw and Kim Thomas, University of Cape Town, 13 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas and Shaw used the media (including local, regional and national news) to build a database of individual hits or attempted hits over a 16-year period. They recorded just over 1 000 individual cases of assassination or attempted assassination. By no means all were political. ‘Where there is a cross-over between the involvement of state and criminal actors in perpetrating such violence, or cooperating in ways that facilitate violent outcomes, the position is particularly serious,’ says Professor Shaw.
 

== Location of assassinations ==

It has been argued that the situation is particularly bad in the provinces of [[Mpumalanga]] and [[KwaZulu-Natal]] with KwaZulu-Natal being, by far, the worst.&lt;ref name="sacsis.org.za"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hlongwane, Sipho (23 July 2012).

==Conviction rates and a possible 'licence to kill'==

There has been one conviction in response to the fourteen assassinations in Mpumalanga and four in KwaZulu-Natal for forty two assassinations leading one researcher to conclude that some people are starting to believe there may be a "general licence for political killings" but that "this may only be available to people in certain political positions".&lt;ref name=bruce/&gt;

{{Rape}}
'''Prison rape''' or '''jail rape''' is [[rape]] occurring in [[prison]]. The phrase has come into common usage to refer to rape of inmates by other inmates, and less commonly to the rape of inmates by staff, and even less commonly rape of staff by inmates.

In the US, the overwhelming majority of cases are men who are raped by other men.&lt;ref name="Rosin"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stemple/&gt;

In some jurisdictions, sexual contact with inmates by prison staff is illegal regardless of consent.&lt;ref&gt;Santi, Alysia.

Retrieved January 29, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The well-known [[teardrop tattoo]] sometimes signifies that the wearer was raped while incarcerated and tattooed with a teardrop under the eye by the offending party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3624-four-days-in-the-oaxaca-state-prison|title=Four Days in the Oaxaca State Prison : Mexico Living|quote=the victim of rape is tattooed with a teardrop below the eye by the offending party|publisher=mexconnect.com|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was a way of marking an inmate as property or to publicly humiliate the inmate as face tattoos cannot be hidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tattooswithmeaning.com/teardrop-tattoo-meaning|title=Teardrop Tattoo Meaning: Tattoos With Meaning|quote=a way of marking an inmate as property of another person or for humiliation; a face tattoo cannot be covered up or hidden.|publisher=tattooswithmeaning.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Prison rape in the United States}}

Public awareness of common prison rape is a relatively recent development and estimates of its prevalence have varied widely for decades. In 1974, Carl Weiss and David James Friar wrote that 46 million Americans would one day be incarcerated; of that number, they held that 10 million would be raped.&lt;ref name=peek /&gt;

A [[United States Department of Justice]] report, ''Sexual Victimization in Prisons and Jails Reported by Inmates'', states that "In 2011–12, an estimated 5.0% of state and federal prison inmates and 3.2% of jail inmates reported experiencing one or more incidents of sexual victimization by another inmate or facility staff in the past 12 months or since admission to the facility, if less than 12 months."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/svpjri1112.pdf|title=Sexual Victimization in Prisons and Jails Reported by Inmates |accessdate=2013-05-17|last=Beck|first=Allen J.|year=2013|publisher=[[US Department of Justice]]|page=[http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/svpjri1112.pdf 6]|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, advocates dispute the accuracy of the numbers, saying they seem to under-report the real numbers of sexual assaults in prison, especially among juveniles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jjie.org/advocates-dispute-agency-finding-on-sex-abuse-of-juvenile-inmates/|title=Advocates Dispute Agency Finding on Sex Abuse of Juvenile Inmates|accessdate=2013-05-17|last=Swift|first=James |year=2013|publisher=Juvenile Justice Information Exchange|page=[http://jjie.org/advocates-dispute-agency-finding-on-sex-abuse-of-juvenile-inmates/]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1992 estimate from the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] conjectured that between 9 and 20 percent of inmates had been sexually assaulted.&lt;ref name=peek /&gt; Studies in 1982 and 1996 concluded that the rate was somewhere between 12 and 14 percent. A 1986 study by Daniel Lockwood put the number at around 23 percent&lt;ref name=peek /&gt; for [[Incarceration in the United States#Security levels|maximum security prisons]] in New York. In contrast, Christine Saum's 1994 survey of 101 inmates showed 5 had been sexually assaulted.&lt;ref name="peek"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peek|first=Christine|year=2003|title=Breaking Out of the Prison Hierarchy: Transgendered Prisoners, Rape, and the Eighth Amendment|journal=Santa Clara Law Review|publisher=[[Santa Clara University School of Law]]|volume=44|issue=Entire Paragraph citation|pages=1211–48|issn=0146-0315|oclc=2842601|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Tg/Breaking_Out_of_the_Prison_Hierarchy__Transgender_Prisoners,_Rape,_and_the_Eighth_Amendment.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-06-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010170831/http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Tg/Breaking_Out_of_the_Prison_Hierarchy__Transgender_Prisoners,_Rape,_and_the_Eighth_Amendment.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003]]'' was the first United States federal law passed specifically dealing with the sexual assault of prisoners. The bill was signed into law on September 4, 2003.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Brenda V.|date=Spring 2008|title=The Prison Rape Elimination Act: Implementation and Unresolved Issues|journal=Criminal Law Brief|publisher=[[Washington College of Law]]|issue=WCL Research Paper No. 2008–49|oclc=63521701|ssrn=1129810|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1447">'''Rangzen Shonu''' ({{bo|t=རང་བཙན་གཞོན་ནུ་|w=rang btsan gzhon nu}}: "Freedom Youth") was a [[rock and roll]] [[Band (music)|band]] formed by [[Tibetan diaspora|Tibetans in India]]. [[Dadon]] reportedly integrated some of Rangzen Shonu's signature style after hearing a [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] smuggled in [[Tibet]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Havnevik|first=Hanna|author2=Janet Gyatso |title=Women in Tibet|publisher=Columbia University Press|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} Tibet Information Network, ''Unity and discord: music and politics in contemporary Tibet'', 2004, p. 83- 84  Dadon is Tibet's first pop star, and remains one of the most successful to this day. [...] She was inspired by the Taiwanese singer Deng Lijun, known as Teresa Teng, and emulated her singing style. However, as Henrion-Dourcy reports, another point of inspiration was Modern Tibetan songs, the 1995 cassette of the Dharamsala-based band Rangzen Shonu, 'Freedom Youth', which was smuggled into Lhasa in 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rangzen Shonu is best known for the unique sound of Tibetan lyrics accompanied by acoustic guitars rather than traditional Tibetan instruments.

He is the subject of the song "Phantom Patriot" by [[Les Claypool]] on his album ''[[Of Whales and Woe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesclaypool.com/discography/lesclaypool/|title=Les Claypool - Discography - Les Claypool|work=lesclaypool.com|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
McCaslin, wearing a skull mask and a blue jumpsuit with "Phantom Patriot" written in red on his chest, infiltrated the site of Bohemian Grove, just north of [[San Francisco]]. He was heavily armed with "a pump-action rifle/shotgun hybrid, a [[.45 ACP|.45 caliber]] handgun, a [[crossbow]], a 2-foot-long sword, a knife and a fireworks mortar tube." McCaslin slept in one of the cabins overnight. The following morning, he found the 30-foot owl statue, then later encountered caretaker Fred Yeager and maintenance man Bob Hipkiss.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/NWO/Bohemian_Grove_Attack.htm Bohemian Grove intruder says he feared human sacrifices], ''Illuminati Conspiracy Archive''&lt;/ref&gt; McCaslin set a fire in the empty banquet hall, then was later removed peacefully by local law enforcement officers and was briefly held at the mental health ward of the [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma County]] Jail.  He later claimed to have seen the documentary film "Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove", by radio show host [[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.sfgate.com/2002-04-17/bay-area/17541892_1_explosive-device-sonoma-county-human-sacrifice Bohemian Grove commando found guilty], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle|SFGate]]'', April 17, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==After prison release==
McCaslin was paroled on 19 May 2008.  On June 28, 2011, using the name "Thoughtcrime", McCaslin protested outside the Alcoa plant in Davenport, Iowa, where [[Barack Obama]] was speaking. He accused Obama, as well as the Bushes, the Clintons and others of being reptoid/human hybrids, or "blue blood".&lt;ref&gt;Rashah McChesney.

Most recently, McCaslin has adopted [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] as his base of operations. His story appears in the 2013 book, "Heroes in the Night; Inside the Real Life Superhero Movement" by Tea Krulos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Krulos | first=T. | title=Heroes in the Night: Inside the Real Life Superhero Movement | publisher=Chicago Review Press, Incorporated | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-61374-775-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uTrVAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55 | ref=harv | accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also has three Phantom Patriot videos on [[YouTube]].

The group '''Science, Reason and Faith''' ('''CRYF''', standing for '''Ciencia, Razón y Fe''' in Spanish) is formed by teachers at the [[University of Navarra]]. Its purpose is to promote the interdisciplinary study of issues related to science, philosophy and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Udías Vallina, Agustín (2010). Ciencia y religión: dos visiones del mundo. Sal Terrae. p. 16. (In Spanish.)&lt;/ref&gt; The activities of the group cover three closely related areas: research, teaching and public engagement.

==History of the group==
The beginning of the CRYF group dates back to the informal conversations that, at the end of the 20th century, professors [[Mariano Artigas]] († 2006) and [[Carlos Pérez (academic)|Carlos Pérez]] († 2005) maintained about interdisciplinary questions and public debates concerning the relationship between science and faith.

In 2002, circumstances were favorable for the creation of the group. Its founding members were professors Mariano Artigas, Juan Luis Lorda, Antonio Pardo, Carlos Perez, Francisco Gallardo and Santiago Collado. Since its inception, in addition to other teachers from the University of Navarra, the group has incorporated prestigious intellectuals and experts on the topics of interest as collaborating members: Evandro Agazzi, William Shea, Juan Arana and Tito Arecchi are some of the present collaborators.

Professor Artigas was appointed the first director of the group, a position he held until his death. The contribution of his intellectual output, which the group has inherited as his legacy, could be summarized as having contributed to unify and highlight the relationship between science and religion. In this endeavor, it is important not to reduce thought to mere scientific rationality, where science is understood as empirical or experimental science. The name of the group expresses this conviction: science, reason and faith. The CRYF is currently considered one of the centers that has contributed most to explore the common ground shared by science, philosophy and theology in southern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oviedo|first1=Lluis|last2=Garre|first2=Álvaro|title=The Interaction between Religion and Science in Catholic Southern Europe (Italy, Spain and Portugal)|journal=Zygon L|date=2015|volume=1|pages=172-193|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/zygo.12159/full|archivedate=11 February 2017|deadurl=yes|df=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211075232/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/zygo.12159/full}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The CRYF has received funding from the [[Templeton Foundation]] twice. In 2006, for the project entitled "The Human Singularity: The Origin, Nature, and Destiny of the Human Being" and in 2011, in order to set up the "Mariano Artigas Memorial Lectures".&lt;ref&gt;José M. Gimenez-Amaya - Santiago Collado (2011-2014). «Mariano Artigas Memorial Lecture (MAML)». &lt;/ref&gt;  The Mariano Artigas Lectures are held every two years in October and have a two-fold purpose: to honor the figure of Professor Artigas and to recognize the work done by the invited lecturer in the field of the relations between science and religion. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Science, Reason and Faith Group|first1=|last2=John Templeton Foundation|first2=|title=Mariano Artigas Memorial Lecture|date=2011-2017|publisher=[[John Templeton Foundation]] |isbn=|url=http://www.unav.edu/web/ciencia-razon-y-fe/mariano-artigas-memorial-lecture|language=English|ref=harv}}{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous speakers have been William Shea in 2011, Karl Giberson in 2013 and Giuseppe Tanzella-Nitti in 2015. In 2017, the Lecture was entrusted to Spanish philosopher Juan Arana.

At the beginning of 2007, after the death of Mariano Artigas, the professor of Physics, [[Héctor Mancini]] replaced him as head of the group until the beginning of 2010. During the period 2010-2016 the director was the [[neuroscientist]], philosopher and priest [[José Manuel Giménez Amaya]]. Since the beginning of 2016, this position is held by the physicist, theologian and priest [[Javier Sánchez Cañizares]].

==Interests and objectives==
Broadly speaking, the CRYF group is interested in discussing the big issues from the perspective of the dialogue between science, reason and faith. Specifically, the main topics of interest are the following:
* [[Origin of man]], [[origin of life]] and [[origin of the universe]]
* Nature and causes of [[evolution]]
* [[Mind#Relation to the brain|Mind-brain relationship]]
* Relations between science and truth
* Relations between science and religion
* Order, [[complexity]] and [[purpose]]

More specific goals of the group are: to promote among its members research and publications on the topics of interest; to develop lessons and teaching materials for intra- and extra-mural education; to make available, through the Internet, an archive of documents on the areas of interest that could be useful as teaching material and for outreach activities; and to promote the organization of activities, collaborations and scientific meetings that can help achieve the goals of the group.

==Activities and some outcomes==
The CRYF group organizes monthly open seminars with invited speakers, followed by a discussion in which academics from various areas of expertise (such as theology, physics, medicine, philosophy and biology) exchange ideas and opinions. These seminars may also have the format of a round table or a workshop, and they are uploaded to the YouTube channel of the University of Navarra. One activity that deserves special mention was the workshop organized by the CRYF in collaboration with the "Thomas More Institute"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.netherhall.org.uk/node/53|title=Thomas More Institute|publisher=Netherhall Educational Association|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of London in 2009, to study the contributions of Mariano Artigas. The presentations of that meeting were later collected and published in the book "Science and Faith Within Reason". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Navarro|first1=Jaume|title=Science and Faith within Reason: Reality, Creation, Life and Design|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781138268630|url=https://www.routledge.com/Science-and-Faith-within-Reason-Reality-Creation-Life-and-Design/Navarro/p/book/9781409426080|language=English|ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In collaboration with the [[Nicolaus Copernicus University]] of Torun (Poland), the CRYF group publishes the interdisciplinary scientific journal "Scientia et Fides" twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apcz.umk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/SetF/index|title=Scientia et Fides|publisher=Wydział Teologiczny UMK|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This peer-reviewed open-access magazine publishes original articles addressing in a rigorous way the relationships between science and religion from different perspectives. The second issue of 2016 was a special number commemorating the tenth anniversary of the death of Mariano Artigas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=|first1=|title=10th anniversary of Mariano Artigas' death|journal=Scientia et Fides|date=2016|volume=IV (2)|pages=538|url=http://apcz.umk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/SetF/issue/view/981|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to teaching, the CRYF group teaches three courses on issues related to science and religion at the University of Navarra. It also collaborates regularly with the Higher Institute of Religious Sciences of the same University. The members of the CRYF are available to give seminars or conferences on the topics of interest to any institution requesting it. Several schools, cultural foundations and universities across Spain, Europe and Latin America have already benefited from this collaboration.

The '''Senaya language''' is a modern Eastern [[Syriac language|Syriac]]-[[Aramaic language]]. It is the language of [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] originally from [[Sanandaj]] in [[Kurdistan Province (Iran)|Iranian Kurdistan]]. Most Senaya speakers now live in [[California]], [[United States]] and few families still live in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]]. They are mostly members of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]]. Since the speakers are ethnically Assyrian, the language would be, at times, considered a dialect of [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]].

== Origin, history and use today ==
The city of [[Sanandaj]] is at the southeastern periphery of the area of spoken modern Aramaic languages. Its geography makes the Neo-Aramaic of Sanandaj quite distinct from other dialects. Two different colloquial Aramaic dialects developed in Sanandaj: Jewish [[Hulaula language|Hulaula]] and Christian Senaya. The two languages developed along different lines, so that the two are not mutually comprehensible. One distinctive difference between the two is the sound change associated with the Middle Aramaic fricative ''θ'' (''th''), often rendered as ''l'' in Hulaula, and ''s'' in Senaya. For example, ''mîθa'', 'dead', is ''mîsa'' in Senaya, and ''mîla'' in Hulaula.

Most Senaya speakers are members of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], which broke away from the [[Church of the East]] in the 16th century and entered into communion with the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. However, Senaya is to a small degree incomprehensible to speakers of [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]], also Chaldean Catholics, originally from [[Iraq]] because of the heavy Kurdish influences on the language. In the middle of the 20th century, the Chaldean Bishop of Senna (as Sanandaj is called in Senaya) was moved to [[Tehran]]. The Christian community soon followed, so that there are no native speakers of Senaya left in Sanandaj. In Tehran, Senaya has been heavily influenced by the Urmežnāya dialect of [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] spoken by the larger Church of the East community there. Both church communities use classical [[Syriac language|Syriac]] in worship. Senaya is written in the ''Madnhāyâ'' version of the [[Syriac alphabet]], which is also used for classical Syriac.

=== Senaya culture ===
The first recorded music with Senaya lyrics was released by [[Paul Caldani]] in 2002, titled ''Melodies of a Distant Land''.

The '''Sindhi diaspora''' consists of [[Sindhi people]] who have emigrated from the historical [[Sind Province (1936–55)|Sind]] province of [[British India]],&lt;ref name="Markovits2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Markovits|first=Claude|title=The Global World of Indian Merchants, 1750–1947: Traders of Sind from Bukhara to Panama|date=22 June 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=English |isbn=9781139431279|page=277|quote=The partition of British India brought in its wake a large-scale exodus of non-Muslims from Sind to independent India.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the modern [[Sindh]] province of [[Pakistan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/222691-The-Sindhi-diaspora|title=The Sindhi diaspora|last=Rajpar|first=Mushtaq|date=10 August 2017|publisher=[[The News International]]|language=English|accessdate=28 January 2018|quote=Sindhis living abroad have attempted to have an organised one voice for decades.

Apart from [[South Asia]], there is a large and well-established community of Sindhis throughout different continents of the world - including [[Canada]], [[Malaysia]], [[Oman]], [[Singapore]], [[UAE]], [[United_States|USA]] and [[UK]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sindhi|first1=people|title=Sindhi diaspora|url=http://www.peoplegroups.org/explore/groupdetails.aspx?peid=24016|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
In 1947, most of the Sindhi [[Hindu]] community migrated to [[India]]. Today, there are about 2.7 million Sindhis living in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011Census/Language-2011/Statement-1.pdf|title=2011 Indian Census|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Foreign lands==
{{Main|British Sindhis|Sindhi Americans}}There is a sizeable population of Sindhis in the U.K. and U.S.A.

It is estimated that around 10,700 Sindhi of [[Afghanistan]] are part of a much larger Sindhi people group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16748">'''Social information seeking''' ('''SIS''') is a field of research that involves studying situations, motivations, and methods for people seeking and sharing information in participatory online social sites, such as [[Yahoo! Answers]], Answerbag, [[WikiAnswers]] and [[Twitter]] as well as building systems for supporting such activities. Highly related topics involve traditional and [[virtual reference]] services, [[information retrieval]], [[information extraction]], and [[knowledge representation]].

==Background==
Social information seeking is often materialized in online question-answering (QA) websites, which are driven by a community. Such QA sites have emerged in the past few years as an enormous market, so to speak, for the fulfillment of information needs. Estimates of the volume of questions answered are difficult to come by, but it is likely that the number of questions answered on social/community QA (cQA) sites far exceeds the number of questions answered by library reference services,&lt;ref&gt;Janes, J. (2003). The Global Census of Digital Reference. In 5th Annual VRD Conference. San Antonio, TX.&lt;/ref&gt; which until recently were one of the few institutional sources for such [[question answering]]. cQA sites make their content – questions and associated answers submitted on the site – available on the open web, and indexable by search engines, thus enabling web users to find answers provided for previously asked questions in response to new queries.

The popularity of such sites have been increasing dramatically for the past several years. Major sites that provide a general platform for questions of all types include [[Yahoo! Answers]], Answerbag and [[Quora]]. While other sites that focus on particular fields; for example, [[StackOverflow]] (computing). StackOverflow has 3.45 million questions, 1.3 million users and over 6.86 million answers since July 2008 while Quora has 437 thousand questions, 264 thousand users and 979 thousand answers.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, G., Gill, K., Mohanlal, M., Zheng, H., &amp; Zhao, B. Y. (2013, May). Wisdom in the social crowd: an analysis of Quora. In Proceedings of the 22nd international conference on World Wide Web (pp. 1341-1352). International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee&lt;/ref&gt;

Social Q&amp;A or cQA, according to Shah et al.,&lt;ref&gt;Shah, C., Oh, S., &amp; Oh, J-S. (2009). Research Agenda for Social Q&amp;A. Library and Information Science Research, 11(4), 205-209.&lt;/ref&gt; consists of three components: a mechanism for users to submit questions in natural language, a venue for users to submit answers to questions, and a community built around this exchange. Viewed in that light, online communities have performed a question answering function perhaps since the advent of Usenet and Bulletin Board Systems, so in one sense cQA is nothing new. Websites dedicated to cQA, however, have emerged on the web only within the past few years: the first cQA site was the Korean Naver Knowledge iN, launched in 2002, while the first English-language CQA site was Answerbag, launched in April 2003. Despite this short history, however, cQA has already attracted a great deal of attention from researchers investigating information seeking behaviors,&lt;ref&gt;Kim, S., Oh, J-S., &amp; Oh, S. (2007). Best-Answer Selection Criteria in a Social Q&amp;A site from the User Oriented Relevance Perspective. Proceedings of the 70th Annual Meeting of the American Society for Information Science and Technology (ASIST ‘07), 44.&lt;/ref&gt; selection of resources,&lt;ref&gt;Harper, M. F., Raban, D.

Shenoy (Eds.), Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on World Wide Web (pp. 231−240). New York: ACM.&lt;/ref&gt; and a range of other information-related behaviors.

==Research questions==
Some of the interesting and important research questions in this area include:

* What causes people to be involved in social Q&amp;A?
* What is the motivation of people who participate in social Q&amp;A?
* Why do questioners choose social Q&amp;A as a source to find information?
* Why do they ask questions online to people whose background or expertise may be unverified?
* Why do they choose social Q&amp;A over other sources to look for information?
* What do they expect from answers given by anonymous people on the Web?
* Why are the answerers willing to share information and knowledge with anonymous people, for free?
* Why do they spend time and effort to find information and help others online? Why are they willing to expose their personal stories to people and inform others with their experiences?

Shah et al.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, C., Oh, S., &amp; Oh, J. S. (2009). Research agenda for social Q&amp;A. Library &amp; Information Science Research, 31(4), 205-209. Retrieved January 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; provide a detailed research agenda for social Q&amp;A. A new book by Shah&lt;ref&gt;Shah, C. (2017).

(187 pages)&lt;/ref&gt; presents a more recent and comprehensive information pertaining to SIS.

== Friendsourcing in social Q&amp;A ==
Friendsourcing is an important component of social question and answering, including how to route questions to friends or others who will most likely answer the question.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Z., and Jansen, B. J. (2015) [https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jjansen/academic/jansen_qanda_wenwo.pdf Analysis of Question and Answering Behavior in Question Routing Services]. 21st International Conference on Collaboration and Technology (CRIWG 2015). Yerevan, Armenia. 22 – 25 Sept., p.72-85&lt;/ref&gt; The important questions include what people’s behaviors are in social networks, especially what kinds of questions people ask from their social networks and how different question types affect the frequency, speed and quality of answers they receive.

Morris et al. (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=Meredith Ringel|last2=Teevan|first2=Jaime|last3=Panovich|first3=Katrina|date=2010-01-01|title=What Do People Ask Their Social Networks, and Why?: A Survey Study of Status Message Q&amp;a Behavior|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1753326.1753587|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '10|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=1739–1748|doi=10.1145/1753326.1753587|isbn=9781605589299}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a survey of question and answering within social networks with 624 people, and gathered detailed data about the behavior of Q&amp;A, including frequency, types of questions and answers, and motivations. They found that half (50.6%) of respondents reported having used their status messages to ask a question, which indicated that Q&amp;A on social networks is popular. Also, the types of questions people asked include recommendation, opinion, factual knowledge, rhetorical, etc. And motivations for asking include trust, asking subjective questions, etc. Their analysis also explored the relationships between answer speed and quality, questions’ property and participants’ property. Only a very small portion (6.5%) of the questions were answered, but the 89.3% of the respondents were satisfied with the response time they experienced even though there’s a discrepancy between that and expectation. Also, the responses gathered via social networks appear to be very valuable. Their findings implied design for search tools that could combine the speed and breadth of traditional search engines with the trustworthiness, personalization, and the high engagement of social media Q&amp;A.

Paul et al. (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Paul, S. A., Hong, L., &amp; Chi, E. H. (2011, May). Is Twitter a Good Place for Asking Questions? A Characterization Study. In ICWSM.&lt;/ref&gt; did a study on question and answering on Twitter, and found that out of the 1152 questions they examined, the most popular question types asked on Twitter were rhetorical (42%) and factual (16%). Surprisingly, along with entertainment (29%) and technology (29%) questions, people asked personal and health-related questions (11%). Only 18.7% questions received response, while a handful of questions received a high number of responses. The larger the askers’ network, the more responses she received; however, posting more tweets or posting more frequently did not increase chances of receiving a response. Most often the “follow” relationship between asker and answerer was one-way. Paul et al. also examined what factors of the askers would increase the chance of getting a response and found that more relevant responses are received when there is a mutual relationship between askers and answerers. Intuitively, we would expect this, as mutual relationship would indicate stronger tie strength and hence, more number of relevant answers.

== Social Q&amp;A services ==
Existing social Q&amp;A services can be characterized from the three perspectives, by the definition of social Q&amp;A as a service involving (1) a method for presenting information needs, (2) a place for responding to information need, and (3) participation as a community.

=== Presenting information needs ===
These social networks support various friendsourcing behavior, provide information benefits that often times traditional search tools cannot, and also may reinforce social bonds through the process. However, there are many questions and limitations that may prevent people from asking questions on their social networks. For example, they may feel uncomfortable asking questions that are too private, might not want to cost too much other people’s time and effort, or might feel the burden of social debts.

Rzeszotarski and Morris (2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rzeszotarski|first=Jeffrey M.|last2=Morris|first2=Meredith Ringel|date=2014-01-01|title=Estimating the Social Costs of Friendsourcing|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2556288.2557181|journal=Proceedings of the 32Nd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '14|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=2735–2744|doi=10.1145/2556288.2557181|isbn=9781450324731}}&lt;/ref&gt; took a novel approach to explore the perceived social costs of friendsourcing on Twitter via monetary choices. They modeled friendsourcing costs across users, and compared it with crowdsourcing on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Their findings suggested interesting design considerations for minimizing social cost by building a hybrid system combining friendsourcing and crowdsourcing with microtask markets.

=== Responding to information needs ===
Sometimes, only asking question from people’s own social networks or friends is not enough. If the question is obscure or time sensitive, no members of their social networks may know the answer. For example, this person’s friends might not have expertise in providing evaluations for a specific model of digital camera. Also asking the current wait time for security at the local airport might not be possible if none of this person’s friends are currently at the airport.

Nichols and Kang (2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nichols|first=Jeffrey|last2=Kang|first2=Jeon-Hyung|date=2012-01-01|title=Asking Questions of Targeted Strangers on Social Networks|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2145204.2145352|journal=Proceedings of the ACM 2012 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work|series=CSCW '12|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=999–1002|doi=10.1145/2145204.2145352|isbn=9781450310864}}&lt;/ref&gt; leveraged Twitter for question and answering with targeted strangers by taking advantage of its public accessibility. In their approach, they mined the public status updates posted on Twitter to find strangers with potentially useful information, and send questions to these strangers to collect responses. As a feasibility study, they collected information regarding response rate, and response time. 42% of users responded to questions from strangers, and 44% of the responses arrived within 30 minutes.

=== Participation as a community ===
Another important and unique component of social Q&amp;A system is that it is a community which allows members to form relationships and bonds, so that their behavior in these social Q&amp;A services will also add to their social capital.

Gray et al. (2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Rebecca|last2=Ellison|first2=Nicole B.|last3=Vitak|first3=Jessica|last4=Lampe|first4=Cliff|date=2013-01-01|title=Who Wants to Know?: Question-asking and Answering Practices Among Facebook Users|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2441776.2441913|journal=Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work|series=CSCW '13|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=1213–1224|doi=10.1145/2441776.2441913|isbn=9781450313315}}&lt;/ref&gt; explored how bridging social capital, question type and relational closeness influence the perceived usefulness and satisfaction of information obtained through questions asked on Facebook. Their results indicated that bridging social capital could positively predict the perceived utility of the acquired information, meaning that information exchanges on social networks is an effective way of social capital conversion. Also, useful answers are more likely to be received from weak ties than strong ties.

== Authority detection in social media ==
In order to recommend the most appropriate users to provide answers in a social network, we need to find approaches to detect users' authority in a social network. In the field of information retrieval, there has been a trend of research investigating ways to detect users' authority effectively and accurately in a social network.

Cha et al.&lt;ref&gt;Cha, M., Haddadi, H., Benevenuto, F., &amp; Gummadi, P. K. (2010). Measuring User Influence in Twitter: The Million Follower Fallacy. ICWSM, 10(10-17), 30.&lt;/ref&gt; investigate possible metrics for determining authority users on popular social network Twitter. They propose the following three simple network-based metrics and discuss their usefulness in determining a user's influence.
# indegree (followers count)
# retweet count
# mention count

An initial analysis of the three aforementioned metrics showed that the users with the highest indegrees and the users with the highest retweet/mention counts were not the same. The top 1% of users by indegree are shown to have very low correlation with the same percentile of users by retweets and by mentions. This implies that follower count is not useful in determining whether a user's tweets get retweeted or whether the other users engage with them.

Pal et al.&lt;ref&gt;Pal, A., &amp; Counts, S. (2011, February). Identifying topical authorities in microblogs. In Proceedings of the fourth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining (pp. 45-54). ACM.&lt;/ref&gt; designed features to measure a user's authority on a certain topic. For example, retweet impact refers to how many times a certain user has been retweeted on a certain topic. The impact is dampened by a factor measuring how many times the user had been retweeted by a unique author to avoid the cases when a user has fans who retweet regardless of the content. They first used a clustering approach to find the target cluster which has the highest average score across all features, and used a ranking algorithm to find the most authoritative users within the cluster.

With these authority detection methods, social Q&amp;A could be more effective in providing accurate answers to askers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6142">'''Sports communication''' is an aspect of [[communication studies]] which specializes in the study of communication in a sports setting. It can encompass the study of interpersonal and organizational communication (both verbal and [[Non-verbal communication|non-verbal]]) between participants within a particular sport (e.g. players, coaches, managers, [[referees]], trainers and physiotherapists, and governing bodies); communication between sports participants, fans, and the media; and the way that sports are represented and communicated in the media. Sports communication is something that happens at all levels of ranging from kindergarten to the college level and is not restricted to professionals. It happens on a constant basis and works best with people that are willing to work collectively as a team. If everyone is on board with positive thoughts and communication, it becomes very dismantling to the person receiving the message. It is not only for positive talk, though, because negative sports communication happens all the time.&lt;ref&gt;Peddersen, Miloch, and Laucella (2007) p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Personal and Organizational Communication in Sport''' could involve intrapersonal, interpersonal, and small-group communication in sport, while organizational communication research could include intra- and interorganizational communication in sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abeza|first=Gashaw|last2=O'Riley|first2=Norm|last3=Nadeau|first3=John|date=September 1, 2014|title=Sport Communication: A Multidimensional Assessment of the Field's Development|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&amp;sid=e08ba986-379f-495a-b76d-27f5ab6a4fe3@sessionmgr4005&amp;hid=4110|journal=International Journal of Sport Communication|doi=|pmid=|access-date=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports creates a context for positive communication and pro-social behaviors that often occur off of the field or court. For example, many athletes speak in public to children or act as motivational speakers. In tough situations, such as the aftermath of a natural disasters, well known athletes can lift the moral of an affected community.  Sports writer Lars Anderson wrote in his book ''The Storm and The Tide'' about how sports helped bring a town together after a disastrous tornado. Also, the situation and community coming together affected the college sports team at The University of Alabama. Andy Billings, professor at The University of Alabama, discusses how sports have the ability to start meaningful conversations https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU8R0bZzqfg. Sports communication theories allow for the prediction of many facets of communication such as gender, race, identity, culture, and politics.&lt;ref name="Communication and Sport: Surveying the Field"&gt;{{cite web|title=Communication and Sport: Surveying the Field|url=https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/communication-and-sport/book239698|publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports communication varies vastly between individual sports and plays an important role in the success of teams and organizations. A good example of sports communication and its effects on players, organizations and media was the well-documented conflict involving two players for the Miami Dolphins. Inappropriate, discriminatory, and abusive interactions between [[Richie Incognito]] and Jonathan Martin lead to the release of Richie from the team, organizational issues, and an abundance of media coverage both negative and positive. Another example of sport communication is the recent "deflategate" scandal involving the New England Patriots apparently deflating the footballs during half-time of the AFC Championship game against the Indianapolis Colts. Head coach [[Bill Belichick]] claims that any wrongdoing was done by the teams equipment manager and ball boy, and no communication had occurred between them two at any point in the game. This reflects sports communication because it is an example of a lack of communication between an inferior member of an organization and the head coach, which eventually led to a wide spread and highly publicized scandal which could've jeopardized the Patriots participation in the Super Bowl.

After 1956, the ''przodownik pracy'' title evolved into an equivalent of the ''employee of the month'' title given in the Western countries, but even then it was still disliked and eventually done away with.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

== In Czechoslovakia ==
In the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]], an udarnik was called ''úderník''&lt;ref name="Zarecor2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kimberly Elman Zarecor|title=Manufacturing a Socialist Modernity: Housing in Czechoslovakia, 1945-1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DkMa0UQG3WMC&amp;pg=PA82|year=2011|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=978-0-8229-7780-3|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with slightly different [[pronunciation]] in the [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] languages). Úderníci were elite workers who surpassed their work quotas and were used by the Party as propaganda. This breaking of production quotas, while usually real and often reaching astounding heights of the order of several hundred percent, was achieved at the cost of substandard quality, lack of work safety regulations and lack of concern for personal health. Most importantly, úderníci usually did not perform any minor tasks mandated by the job standards they were supposed to follow. These tasks were performed by other workers, yet this work counted towards the úderník's quota. Notable udarniks from Czechoslovakia include Lumír Sakmar.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

'''''Takuji Yamashita v. Hinkle''''', 260 U.S. 199 (1922),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Yamashita v. Hinkle|260|199|1922}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a U.S. Supreme Court opinion, affirming the [[state of Washington]]'s [[Alien Land Law]]. The law prohibited Asians from owning property. Washington's attorney general maintained that in order for Japanese people to fit in, their "marked physical characteristics" would have to be destroyed, that "the Negro, the Indian and the Chinaman" had already demonstrated assimilation was not possible for them. The U.S. Supreme Court heard the case and affirmed this race-based prohibition, citing its immediately prior issued decision in ''[[Takao Ozawa v. United States]]''. ''Ozawa'' had upheld the constitutionality of barring anyone other than "free white persons" and "persons of African nativity or ... descent" to naturalize, and affirmed the racial classifications of previous court decisions.

Washington's Alien Land Law would not be repealed until 1966.
