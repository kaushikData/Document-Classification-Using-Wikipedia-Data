      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3195">'''A Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia''' ('''DIWA''') is a list of [[wetland]]s of national importance to [[Australia]]. Intended to augment the list of wetlands of international importance under the [[Ramsar Convention]], it was formerly published in report form, but is now essentially an online publication. Wetlands that appear in the ''Directory'' are commonly referred to as "DIWA wetlands" or "Directory wetlands".

==Criteria for determining wetland importance==
Using criteria agreed in 1994, a wetland can be considered “nationally important” if it satisfies at least one of the following criteria:&lt;ref name=eyles&gt;{{Citation | author1=Eyles, Kathy | author2=Larmour, Geoff | author3=Young, Sarah | author4=Australia. Environment Australia | author5=Natural Heritage Trust (Australia). National Wetlands Program | title=A Directory of important wetlands in Australia | url= http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/18f0bb21-b67c-4e99-a155-cb5255398568/files/directory.pdf |publication-date=2001 | publisher=Environment Australia | edition=3rd  | isbn=978-0-642-54721-7 |pages=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# It is a good example of a wetland type occurring within a [[Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia|biogeographic region in Australia]].
# It is a wetland which plays an important ecological or hydrological role in the natural functioning of a major wetland system/complex.
# It is a wetland which is important as the habitat for animal taxa at a vulnerable stage in their life cycles, or provides a refuge when adverse conditions such as drought prevail.
# The wetland supports 1% or more of the national populations of any native plant or animal taxa.
# The wetland supports native plant or animal taxa or communities which are considered endangered or vulnerable at the national level.
# The wetland is of outstanding historical or cultural significance.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Types of wetlands==
The directory uses a classification system consisting of the following three categories (i.e. A, B and C) which are further sub-divided into a total of 40 different wetland types:&lt;ref name=eyles/&gt;
*A. Marine and Coastal Zone wetlands, which consists of 12 wetland types
*B. Inland wetlands, which consists of 19 wetland types
*C. Human-made wetlands, which consists of 9 wetland types.

The '''Alan Rogers Guides''' were started in [[Great Britain|Britain]] in 1968 by camp enthusiast [[Alan Rogers(camping)|Alan Rogers]]. The guides place utmost importance on the quality of the [[campsite]]s; [[campsite]]s cannot pay to be in the guide. Travel guides have been published every year (with the exception of 2017) since 1968. In 2018, Alan Rogers Guides celebrated its 50th anniversary.

== How the campsites are chosen ==
The guides rely on a team of Site Assessors, all of whom are experienced caravanners or motorcaravanners, to visit and recommend parks. The popularity of the guides is based their impartiality and supported by the enthusiasm, diligence and integrity of the Site Assessors.

The most important criteria used when inspecting and selecting parks is quality. The Assessors consider and evaluate:

*The welcome
*The pitches
*The sanitary facilities
*The cleanliness
*The general maintenance
*The location

The guides try to cater for a wide variety of preferences; from those seeking a small peaceful campsite in the heart of the countryside, to visitors looking for an 'all singing, all dancing' park in a popular seaside resort.

== History ==
[[Image:Ar-guides.jpg|frame|20px|right|Alan Rogers logo 1993 - 2011]]
The first guide (Alan Rogers' selected sites for caravanning and camping in Europe) sold for four shillings (20p). In the introduction to the first guide Alan wrote "I would like to stress that the camps which are included in this book have been chosen entirely on merit and no payment of any sort is made by them for their inclusion."

Alan Rogers continued to expand until 1986 when [[Alan Rogers(camping)|Alan Rogers]], aged 70, decided to seek retirement and the publishing company, then known as Deneway Guides and Travel Ltd, was sold to close friends of Rogers'. The [[Mark Hammerton Group Ltd|Mark Hammerton Group]] acquired the company in 2001 shortly after Alan Rogers' death just a year earlier.

Clive Edwards, who purchased the company in the mid 1980s, remembers the negotiations with Alan Rogers clearly. "The actual business negotiations were conducted quickly. What Alan was really concerned about was that we would maintain the philosophy and the impartiality of the Guides. Following Alan's retirement we found that he was always willing to offer us advice and guidance".

In 2004 the business moved to its current premises in the Kent countryside.

The Mark Hammerton Group was acquired by [[Caravan and Motorhome Club]] under the brand [[Alan Rogers Travel Group]] along with its subsidiary company Belle France. The guides continue to recommend campsites based on strict criteria and independent assessments. Sites are added where appropriate and removed if standards have fallen.

== Success ==
The guides have been influential in the rise in popularity of camping; for example, drawing attention to the number of overseas sites that were providing mains electricity hook-ups. Alan Rogers suggested that British caravanners and motor caravanners should take advantage of this by having their units wired to take mains electricity; in 1968 no standard British caravan was supplied with mains electricity wiring.

One measure of the guides' success is that many of the things he called for in the original guide have now become reality:
*Mains electricity connections in caravans and motor caravans
*Marked pitches of a minimum size
*Hot water freely available in the amenity blocks
*British style toilets on French campsites
*The use of trees and bushes to mark pitches
*An end to the practice of over-crowding of sites during the peak summer holiday times

Many of the sites personally recommended by Rogers' in 1968 - are still recommended in the current guide.

'''The Alcuin Club''' is an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] organization devoted to preserving or restoring church ceremony, arrangement, ornament, and practice in an [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] manner. It was founded in 1897, with its first publication, ''English Altars'' by [[W. H. St. John Hope]], appearing in 1899. The club is dedicated to the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' and conformity to its exact [[rubric]]. In the 20th century, the club was active in the debate over the rewriting of the ''Book of Common Prayer'' for the 1920 revision. Its influence faded somewhat after the first part of the century and it is now dedicated to studying ceremony of all [[Christianity|Christian]] churches. Nonetheless, the club's members are active in the liturgical researches of the Anglican churches. Membership in the club is now around 600, with half being in the United Kingdom and many in the United States.

The Alcuin Club selects works on liturgy and ceremony and [[hagiography]] every year to include in its collections. These collections represent significant scholarship.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The '''''Annales florentini''''' (Florentine annals, Italian ''Annali fiorentini'') are the earliest [[annals]] of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Republic of Florence|commune of Florence]]. There are two sets of annals overlapping in coverage. The ''Annales florentini primi'' cover the period 1110–1173, while the ''Annales florentini secundi'' cover 1107–1247. A later collection also called the ''Annales florentini'' covers the period 1288–1431.

The ''Annales florentini primi'' constitute the earliest, tentative attempt to keep a yearly record of events in Florence. It was discovered on the back ([[Recto and verso|verso]]) of the 72nd leaf ([[folio]]) of Codex 772 in the [[Vatican Palatine Library]] by the librarian, who brought it to the attention of scholars. It does not contain a record for every year between 1110 and 1173. There are only eighteen records in several different handwritings and not arranged chronologically. The writing is clearly from the twelfth century.&lt;ref name=Villari&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Pasquale Villari |title=The Two First Centuries of Florentine History: The Republic and Parties at the Time of Dante |first=Pasquale |last=Villari |publisher=T. Fisher Unwin |year=1894 |page=39 |url=https://archive.org/stream/twofirstcenturi02villgoog#page/n8/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Annales florentini secundi'' date to the thirteenth century. There are 46 records between the years 1107 and 1247. They are found in a manuscript originating in the monastery of [[Santa Maria Novella]], now No. 776 E. A. in the Suppressed Monasteries series of the Magliabecchian Library, now part of the [[National Central Library (Florence)|National Library at Florence]]. This same manuscript contains a list of Florentine consuls and ''[[podestà]]'' from 1196 to 1267.&lt;ref name=Villari/&gt;

'''Anti-Hindu sentiment''' is a negative perception or any sentiment against the practice and practitioners of [[Hinduism]].

== Anti-Hindu sentiments ==

[[File:Chattalpalli Durga mandap at Deganga.jpg|thumb|right|The passage to the permanent Durga mandap at Chattalpalli was being dug up to prevent the Hindus from entering the area.]]

Individuals in the Indian diaspora have begun to protest that Western scholars "distort their religion and perpetuate negative stereotypes",&lt;ref name="uchicago"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0412/features/index-print.shtml |author=Braverman, Amy M. |title=The interpretation of gods |year=2006 |accessdate=2007-04-01 |publisher=University of Chicago Magazine| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070402183904/http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0412/features/index-print.shtml| archivedate= 2 April 2007 &lt;!-- DASHBot --&gt;| deadurl= no}}'&lt;/ref&gt; which began with  [[Macaulayism]] in India. Historically, such stereotypes were promulgated during the [[British Raj]] by several [[Indophobia|Indophobes]] in South Asia as a means to aggrandize sectarian divisions in Indian society, part of the [[divide and rule]] strategy employed by the British. Such allegations have seen a rise with the Hindu right using them for [[politics]].&lt;ref name="uchicago" /&gt;

The [[Indian Caste System]], a social stratification system in South Asia which has been criticized for its discriminatory problems, is often seen as a uniquely 'Hindu' issue rather than a cultural one. This is a common stereotype, as adherents of other religions such as [[Islam]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Christianity]] have kept the practice of caste segregation in India (for details, see [[Caste system among South Asian Muslims]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-36220329|title=Why are many Indian Muslims seen as untouchable?|last=correspondent|first=Soutik Biswas Delhi|website=BBC News|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brookings p.21"&gt;{{cite book|title=India: Emerging Power|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/India.html?id=sOTZqI5zREoC&amp;hl=en |first=Stephen P.|last=Cohen|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-8157-9839-2|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Chaudhary|2013|p=149|ps=}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christian-caste |title=Christian caste-Indian Society |last=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=The Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date= May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian missionaries denigrate selected features of Hindu practice—most notably image worship, [[sati]], and child marriage (the first two were also criticized by Muslims).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hinduism/Hinduism-and-Islam |title= Hinduism |last=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=The Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date= June 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the religious dialogue activist [[P. N. Benjamin]], some christian evangelists denigrate Hindu gods and abuse Hindu rituals as barbaric, and such attitudes have caused tensions between religious communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2001/10/09/stories/13090244.htm|title=The Hindu : Who's afraid of dialogue?|website=www.thehindu.com|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DoFxBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT125|title=Pentecostals, Proselytization, and Anti-Christian Violence in Contemporary India|last=Bauman|first=Chad M.|date=2015-02-02|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780190266318|location=|pages=125|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the reign of [[Muhammad bin Tughlaq]], the Muslim cleric [[Ziauddin Barrani]] wrote several works, such as the ''Fatwa-i-Jahandari'', which gave him a reputation  as a "fanatical protagonist of Islam"&lt;ref name="Das"&gt;Das, Arbind, Arthashastra of Kautilya and Fatwa-i-Jahandari of Ziauddin Barrani:an analysis, Pratibha Publications, Delhi 1996, {{ISBN|81-85268-45-2}} pp. 138–139&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote that there should be "an all-out struggle against Hinduism", advocating a militant and dogmatic religiosity.&lt;ref name="Verma"&gt;Verma, V.P, Ancient and Medieval Indian Political Thought, Lakshmi Narasan Aggarwal Educational Publications, Agra 1986 pp. 218–220&lt;/ref&gt; He developed a system of religious elitism to that effect.&lt;ref name="Verma" /&gt;

Historian Hayavadana C. Rao wrote about Tippu in his encyclopaedic work on the History of Mysore. He asserted that Tippu's "religious fanaticism and the excesses committed in the name of religion, both in Mysore and in the provinces, stand condemned for all time. His bigotry, indeed, was so great that it precluded all ideas of toleration". He further asserts that the acts of Tippu that were constructive towards Hindus were largely political and ostentatious rather than an indication of genuine tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Rao| first = Hayavadana C.| authorlink = Hayavadana C.

He also corresponded with the Sringeri Shankaracharya – expressing grief and indignation at a raid by Maratha bandit horsemen (called Pindari), which killed many and plundered the monastery of its valuable possessions,&lt;ref&gt;Mohibbul Hasan The History of Tipu Sultan (Delhi) 1971 pp 359&lt;/ref&gt; patronised the Melkote temple (which has gold and silver vessels with inscriptions indicating that they were presented under the Sultan), for which a Kannada decree was issued that the Shrivaishnava (Hindu sectary) invocatory verses there should be recited in the traditional form. Tipu Sultan also presented four silver cups to the Lakshmikanta Temple at Kalale&lt;ref&gt;B.A. Saletare "Tipu Sultan as Defender of the Hindu Dharma" in Habib (Ed.) Confronting Colonialism, pp. 116–8&lt;/ref&gt; and probably presented the Ranganatha temple at Srirangapatana with seven silver cups and a silver camphor burner.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Sheikh.

Retrieved 17 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sringeri Sharada Peetham]] has in its safe possession some 24 letters written by the Sultan who also sent a silver palanquin and a pair of silver chauris to the Sarada Temple as well.&lt;ref name="newstodaynet.com"&gt;[http://newstodaynet.com/guest/3110gu1.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813050526/http://newstodaynet.com/guest/3110gu1.htm|date=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tipu sent a letter on 19 January 1790 to the Governor of [[Bekal]], Budruz Zuman Khan. It says:
{{quote|Don't you know I have achieved a great victory recently in Malabar and over four lakh Hindus were converted to Islam? I am determined to march against that cursed Rama Varma (''[[Rajah]]'' of [[Travancore]]) very soon. Since I am overjoyed at the prospect of converting him and his subjects to Islam, I have happily abandoned the idea of going back to Srirangapatanam now.&lt;ref&gt;K.M. Panicker, Bhasha Poshini, August 1923&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the attitudes of Muslim ruler [[Tippu Sultan]] have been criticized as being anti-Hindu by Indian historians, left-wing historians note that he had an egalitarian attitude towards Hindus and was harsh towards them only when politically expedient.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Brittlebank ''Tipu Sultan's Search for Legitimacy: Islam and Kingship in a Hindu domain'' (Delhi: Oxford University Press) 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Former IAS Officer, Praxy Fernandes has mentioned in his book that Tipu Sultan displayed reverence to the head of the Hindu Shringeri Mutt, by

[[Irfan Habib]] and Mohibbul Hasan argue that these early British authors had a strong vested interest in presenting Tippu Sultan as a tyrant from whom the British had "liberated" Mysore.&lt;ref&gt;Irfan Habib "War and Peace. Tippu Sultan's Account of the last Phase of the Second War with the English, 1783-4" ''State and Diplomacy Under Tipu Sultan'' (Delhi) 2001 p. 5; Mohibbul Hasan writes "The reasons why Tipu was reviled are not far to seek. Englishmen were prejudiced against him because they regarded him as their most formidable rival and an inveterate enemy, and because, unlike other Indian rulers, he refused to become a tributary of the English Company. Many of the atrocities of which he has been accused were allegedly fabricated either by persons embittered and angry on account of the defeats which they had sustained at his hands, or by the prisoners of war who had suffered punishments which they thought they did not deserve. He was also misrepresented by those who were anxious to justify the wars of aggression which the Company's Government had waged against him. Moreover, his achievements were belittled and his character blackened in order that the people of Mysore might forget him and rally round the Raja, thus helping in the consolidation of the new regime" ''The History of Tipu Sultan'' (Delhi) 1971 p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; This assessment is echoed by Brittlebank in her recent work.&lt;ref&gt;Brittlebank ''Tipu Sultan's search for legitimacy'' pp. 10–12. On p. 2 she writes "it is perhaps ironic that the aggressive Hinduism of some members of the Indian Community in the 1990s should draw upon an image of Tipu which, as we shall see, was initially constructed by the Subcontinent's colonizers."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== During the British Raj ===

During the British rule of the Indian subcontinent, several evangelical Christian missionaries spread anti-Hindu propaganda as a means to convert Hindus to Christianity. Examples include missionaries like Abbe J.A. Dubois, who wrote "Once the devadasis' temple duties are over, they open their cells of infamy, and frequently convert the temple itself into a stew. A religion more shameful or indecent has never existed amongst a civilized people."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/1993/9/1993-9-12.shtml Hinduism Today | Sep 1993&lt;!-- Bot-generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929110314/http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/1993/9/1993-9-12.shtml|date=29 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Charles Grant (British East India Company)|Charles Grant]]'s highly influential "Observations on the ...Asiatic subjects of Great Britain" (1796),&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Charles. (1796) Observations on the state of society among the Asiatic subjects of Great Britain, particularly with respect to morals; and on the means of improving it, written chiefly in the year 1792.&lt;/ref&gt; Grant criticized the Orientalists for being too respectful to Indian culture and religion. His work tried to determine the Hindu's "true place in the moral scale", and he alleged that the Hindus are "a people exceedingly depraved".

=== Afghanistan ===
{{see also|Hinduism in Afghanistan}}
The extremist [[Taliban]] regime in Afghanistan, which enforced strict [[sharia]] (Islamic law), announced plans in May 2001 to require Hindus (and [[Sikh]]s) to wear identifying badges in public, part of the Taliban's campaign to segregate and repress "un-Islamic and idolatrous segments" of Afghan society.&lt;ref name="TalibantoMark"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2001/fyi/news/05/22/taleban.hindus/ Taliban to mark Afghan Hindus], CNN (May 22, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/asia-jan-june01-afghanistan_05-22/ Taliban to Require Identity Badges for Non-Muslims], ''[[PBS NewsHour]], PBS (May 22, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, about 500 Hindus and 2,000 Sikhs remained in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="Harding"&gt;Luke Harding, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/24/lukeharding Taliban defends Hindu badges plan], ''The Guardian'' (May 23, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-Hindu decree was seen as reminiscent of the [[Nazi Germany]] law requiring Jews to wear an identifying [[yellow badge]].&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelley"&gt;Jack Kelley, [http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2001-05-22-talibanids.htm Taliban: Hindus must wear identity labels], ''USA Today'' (May 22, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; The order prompted international outrage, and was denounced by the [[Government of India|Indian]] and U.S. governments,&lt;ref name="Harding"/&gt; as well as by  [[Abraham Foxman]] of the [[Anti-Defamation League]].&lt;ref name="Kelley"/&gt; Following international pressure, the Taliban regime dropped the badge plans in June 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Archives/2001/06/27/Taliban-drop-badge-policy-for-Hindus/6861993614400/ Taliban drop badge policy for Hindus], [[United Press International]] (June 27, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the supposedly secular [[Bangladesh Awami League]] is not immune from this kind of scare-mongering. The current prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, was alleged to have accused Bangladeshi Hindu leaders in New York of having divided loyalties with "one foot in India and one in Bangladesh". Successive events such as this have contributed to a feeling of tremendous insecurity among the Hindu minority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/2000/2/2000-2-07.shtml A Bleak Future for Bangladesh Hindu's] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203220945/http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/2000/2/2000-2-07.shtml |date=3 February 2009 }}, ''hinduismtoday.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamentalists and right-wing parties such as the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] and Jatiya Party often portray Hindus as being sympathetic to India, making accusations of [[dual loyalty]] and allegations of transferring economic resources to India, contributing to a widespread perception that Bangladeshi Hindus are disloyal to the state. Also, the right wing parties claim the Hindus to be backing the Awami League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/engASA130062001!Open|title=Amnesty International Report|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separate electorates for Hindus and Christians were established in 1985—a policy originally proposed by Islamist leader [[Abul A'la Maududi]].

The [[Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal]] (MMA), a coalition of Islamist political parties in Pakistan, calls for the increased Islamization of the government and society, specifically taking an anti-Hindu stance. The MMA leads the opposition in the national assembly, held a majority in the NWFP Provincial Assembly, and was part of the ruling coalition in Balochistan. However, some members of the MMA made efforts to eliminate their rhetoric against Hindus.&lt;ref name="USdept2006"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71443.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2006] Published by the US Department of State&lt;/ref&gt;

The public school curriculum in Pakistan was Islamized during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71443.htm|title=Pakistan|work=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Pakistan claims to undertake a major revision to eliminate such teachings and to remove Islamic teaching from secular subjects.&lt;ref name="USdept2006" /&gt; The bias in [[Pakistan studies|Pakistani textbooks]] was also documented by Y. Rosser (2003). She wrote that
{{quote|"in the past few decades, social studies textbooks in Pakistan have been used as locations to articulate the hatred that Pakistani policy makers have attempted to inculcate towards their [[Hindu]] neighbours", and that as a result "in the minds of generations of Pakistanis, indoctrinated by the 'Ideology of Pakistan' are lodged fragments of hatred and suspicion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlists.net/sindh-intl/mail/mail_abuseofhistory.htm |title=Abuse of History in Pakistan: Bangladesh to Kargil |accessdate=2007-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031114223934/http://www.mlists.net/sindh-intl/mail/mail_abuseofhistory.htm |archivedate=14 November 2003 |df=dmy }}, by Dr. Yvette C Rosser&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The bias in Pakistani textbooks was studied by Rubina Saigol, K. K. Aziz, I. A. Rahman, Mubarak Ali, [[A H Nayyar|A. H. Nayyar]], Ahmed Saleem, Y. Rosser and others.

A study by Nayyar &amp; Salim (2003) that was conducted with 30 experts of Pakistan's education system, found that the textbooks contain statements that seek to create hate against Hindus. There was also an emphasis on Jihad, Shahadat, wars and military heroes. The study reported that the textbooks also had a lot of gender-biased stereotypes. Some of the problems in Pakistani textbooks cited in the report were:
{{quote|"Insensitivity to the existing religious diversity of the nation"; "Incitement to militancy and violence, including encouragement of Jihad and Shahadat"; a "glorification of war and the use of force"; "Inaccuracies of fact and omissions that serve to substantially distort the nature and significance of actual events in our history"; "Perspectives that encourage [[prejudice]], [[bigotry]] and [[discrimination]] towards fellow citizens, especially women and religious minorities, and other towards nations" and "Omission of concepts ... that could encourage critical self awareness among students". (Nayyar &amp; Salim 2003). The Pakistani Curriculum document for classes K-V stated in 1995 that "at the completion of Class-V, the child should be able to "Understand Hindu-Muslim differences and the resultant need for Pakistan. [p.&amp;nbsp;154]}}

A more recent textbook published in Pakistan titled "[[A Short History of Pakistan]]" edited by [[Ishtiaq Hussain Qureshi]] has been heavily criticized by academic peer-reviewers for anti-Hindu biases and prejudices that are consistent with [[Pakistani nationalism]], where Hindus are portrayed as "villains" and Muslims as "victims" living under the "disastrous Hindu rule" and "betraying the Muslims to the British", characterizations that academic reviewers fond "disquieting" and having a "warped subjectivity".&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, F., 1968, Pacific Affairs, University of British Columbia, pp. 644–645&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, P.

According to the [[Sustainable Development Policy Institute]] report 'Associated with the insistence on the Ideology of Pakistan has been an essential component of hate against India and the Hindus.

In 2006, the son of an Islamic cleric named Ahmed Deedat circulated a DVD that denounced South African Hindus. The elder Deedat, former head of the Arab funded "Islamic Propagation Centre International" (IPCI), had previously circulated an anti-Hindu video in the 1980s where he said that Indian Muslims were 'fortunate' that their Hindu forefathers 'saw the light' and converted to Islam when Muslim rulers dominated some areas of India. His video was widely criticized. While Hindus in South Africa have largely ignored the new anti-Hindu DVD circulated by Deedat Junior, he has been severely criticized by local Muslims, including other members of the IPCI.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} The IPCI said in a statement that Yusuf Deedat did not represent the organisation in any way. Deedat Junior, undeterred by the opposition from his own brethren, continues to circulate the material.He has placed advertisements in newspapers inviting anyone to collect a free copy from his residence to see for themselves "what the controversy is about".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiaenews.com/africa/20060312/230.htm South African Muslims reject anti-Hindu DVD],''India Enews''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trinidad and Tobago ===

The first Hindus arrived in British ruled [[Trinidad and Tobago]] in the [[Caribbean]] aboard the [[Fatel Razack]] on May 31, 1845 as [[Indian indenture system|indentured laborers]] who were brought by the British after the abolition of slavery, they were followed by thousand more who came between 1845 to 1917. They worked on the sugarcane, rice, cocoa, and coffee estates. The indentured laborers primarily came from the [[Bhojpuri region]] and the [[Awadh|Awadhi region]] of the [[Hindi Belt]] in [[North India]]. A significant minority also came from [[South India]] and very few came from the  [[Punjab]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Kumaon division|Kumaon]], [[Garhwal division|Garhwal]], [[Jammu Division|Jammu]], [[Kashmir]], [[Gujarat]], [[Kutch district|Kutch]], [[Odisha]], and [[Bengal]] regions. A majority of the laborers were Hindu. Unlike the African slaves who they succeeded, the Indians were able to keep their culture and traditions. This led to many Hindu immigrants passing on the faith and despite efforts by Christian missionaries to convert them many continued to practice Hinduism and today Hinduism is the second largest religion in Trinidad and Tobago and the largest religion of the Indian population in Trinidad and Tobago. Although they were allowed to continue their religion they were met with contempt or indifference by the non-Hindu residents of the country. The Hindu and Muslim clashes that occurred in [[South Asia]] continued to occur in Trinidad and Tobago during the days of indentureship and especially while in the [[Partition of India]] was going on back in [[South Asia]]. During indentureship and even in the beginning after independence from the British, Hindus were treated as second class citizens. The Hindus in Trinidad and Tobago struggled during the early days after independence and even before during British colonial times over the granting of adult franchise, a Hindu marriage act, Hindu schools, cremation ordinance, the right to [[Diwali]] as a public holiday, and others. Many of these rights were later granted, due to the efforts of [[Adrian Cola Rienzi|Adrian Cola Rienzi (Krishna Deonarine Tiwari)]] and the [[Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha]], the major Hindu organization in Trinidad and Tobago led by [[Bhadase Maraj|Bhadase Sagan Maraj]]. The [[Temple in the Sea]], an iconic Hindu temple in Trinidad and Tobago has its history rooted in the prejudices of Hinduism. It was originally built by an indentured laborer from [[British Raj|British India]] named Sewdass Sadhu, who actually had built the first temple on property belonging to the estate owners and the temple had to be torn down and he was jailed. After that he built a second temple out into the sea which became known as the Temple in the Sea. During the [[Black Power movement]] after independence in the 1960s-1970s many Hindu were targeted and attack and riots had broken out. These attacks, the poverty that affected many Hindus, and the status of being treated as second-class citizens led to many Hindu Trinidadians to migrate to the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], and [[Canada]]. After independence the Hindus were marginalized by the African-based [[Peoples National Movement|People's National Movement (PNM)]] and the opposing party, the [[People's Democratic Party (Trinidad and Tobago)|People's Democratic Party (PDP)]] led by [[Bhadase Maraj|Bhadase Sagan Maraj]], later turning into the [[Democratic Labour Party (Trinidad and Tobago)|Democratic Labour Party (DLP)]] led by [[Rudranath Capildeo]], then finally turning into the present-day [[United National Congress|United National Congress (UNC)]] party led by [[Basdeo Panday]] and [[Kamla Persad-Bissessar]], was portrayed as a ''Hindu party'' and an ''Indian party'' and tactics were used against them. Hindus were described as a ''"recalcitrant and hostile minority"'', by Prime Minister [[Eric Williams]]. Hindus were alienated by such communal groups. The support of the PNM government to [[Christian]] [[Afro-Trinidadian and Tobagonian]] and Creole art forms such as [[Trinidad and Tobago Carnival|Carnival]] and [[Christmas]], while their public rejection and ridicule of Hindu art forms, was a particular source of contention for the Hindus. The displacement of PNM from power in 1985 would improve the circumstances. There has been persistent discontent among the Hindus with their marginalization. Many groups portray Hindus as "clannish, backward and miserly". During the General Elections of 1986, the absence of the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and the [[Quran]] at polling stations for required oath-taking was interpreted as a gross insult to Hindus and Muslims. The absence of any Hindu religious texts at the official residence of the President of Trinidad and Tobago during the swearing in of the new Government in 1986 was perceived as another insult to the minority communities since they were represented in the government. The national education system and curriculum have been repeatedly accused of such majority-oriented symbolism. The use of discernibly oriented prayers at Government schools, the non-representation of Hinduism in approved school textbooks, and the lack of emphasis on Hindu religious observance evoked deep resentment from the Hindu community. Intensified protests over the course of the 1980s led to an improvement in the state's attitudes towards Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rgd.legalaffairs.gov.tt/laws2/alphabetical_list/lawspdfs/30.51.pdf | title=Cremation act | publisher=Ministry of Legal Affairs | accessdate=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2002/14060.htm Trinidad and Tobago] International Religious Freedom Report 2002.

In October 2018, it was reported that [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] London mayoral candidate [[Shaun Bailey]] had written a pamphlet, entitled ''No Man’s Land'', for the [[Centre for Policy Studies]]. In it, Bailey argued that accommodating Hindus "[robs] Britain of its community" and is turning the country into a "crime riddled cess pool". He also claimed that [[South Asians]] "bring their culture, their country and any problems they might have, with them" and that this was not a problem within the black community "because we’ve shared a religion and in many cases a language". &lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/conservative-london-candidate-mayor-shaun-bailey-hindu-muslim-festival-crime-a8566341.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===

By the late 19th century, fear had already begun in [[North America]] over [[Chinese immigration to the United States|Chinese immigration]] supplying cheap labor to lay railroad tracks, mostly in [[California]] and elsewhere in the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. In [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] jargon common in the day, ordinary workers, newspapers, and politicians uniformly opposed this "[[Yellow Peril]]". The common cause to eradicate Asians from the workforce gave rise to the [[Asiatic Exclusion League]]. When the fledging [[Indian American|Indian community]] of mostly [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]]i [[Sikh]]s settled in California, the xenophobia expanded to combat not only the East Asian Yellow Peril, but now the immigrants from [[British India]], the ''Turban Tide'', equally referred to as the ''Hindoo Invasion'' (sic).&lt;ref&gt;Chan Sucheng, Asian Americans: An Interpretive History, Twayne 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Shut the gate to the Hindoo invasion", San Francisco examiner, June 6, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ailf.org/ipc/barredzoneprint.asp Closed Borders and Mass Deportations: The Lessons of the Barred Zone Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061219054300/http://www.ailf.org/ipc/barredzoneprint.asp |date=19 December 2006 }} by Alicia J. Campi&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of the Indian American community in the [[United States]] has brought about some isolated incidences of attacks on them, as has been the case with many minority groups in the United States. Attacks specific to Hindus in the United States stem from what is often referred to as the "racialization of religion" among Americans, a process that begins when certain phenotypical features associated with a group and attached to race in popular discourse become associated with a particular religion or religions.The racialization of Hinduism in American perception has led to perceiving Hindus as a separate group and contributes to prejudices against them.&lt;ref&gt;Joshi, Khyati, The Racialization of Hinduism, Islam, and Sikhism in the United States, Equity &amp; Excellence in Education, Volume 39, Number 3, August 2006, pp. 211–226(16)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pat Robertson ====

In addition, there have been anti-Hindu views that are specific to the religion of Hinduism as well as mistaken racial perceptions. [[Pat Robertson]] in the United States has made remarks denouncing Hinduism as "demonic," believing that Hindus, when they "feel any sort of inspiration, whether it's by a river or under a tree, on top of a hill, they figure that some God or spirit is responsible for that.  And so they'll worship that tree, they'll worship that hill or they'll worship anything."&lt;ref&gt;''The 700 Club'', March 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  These remarks were widely condemned and rebutted by Indian Americans and many non-partisan advocacy groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using TV, Christian Pat Robertson Denounces Hinduism as "Demonic" |url=http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/7027/htoday.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kmoc6zLH?url=http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/7027/htoday.html |archivedate=25 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evangelical leader [[Albert Mohler]] defended Robertson's remarks, saying "any belief system, any world view, whether it's Zen Buddhism or Hinduism or dialectical materialism for that matter, Marxism, that keeps persons captive and keeps them from coming to faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, yes, is a demonstration of satanic power."&lt;ref&gt;''The O'Reilly Factor'', Fox News Channel.  March 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== U.S. Congress ====
{{main article|Rajan Zed prayer protest}}
In July, 2007, The [[United States Senate]] conducted its morning prayer services with a Hindu prayer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/12/AR2007071202007.html|title=Senate Prayer Led by Hindu Elicits Protest|accessdate=2008-12-19 | work=The Washington Post | date=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a historical first. During the service, three disruptors, named Ante Nedlko Pavkovic, Katherine Lynn Pavkovic and Christian Renee Sugar, from the Fundamentalist Christian activist group [[Operation Save America]]&lt;ref name="news.bostonherald.com"/&gt; protested that the Hindu prayer was "an [[abomination (Bible)|abomination]]", and that they were "Christians and Patriots". They were swiftly arrested and charged with disrupting Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/13/washington/13brfs-AHINDUPRAYER_BRF.html?ex=1341979200&amp;en=851dbe33e5130b8d&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=digg&amp;exprod=digg | work=The New York Times | title=A Hindu Prayer in the Senate Meets Protest | date=2007-07-13 | accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|EZ9To30Hz7|A link to YouTube video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event generated a storm of protest from [[Christian right]] groups in the country, with the [[American Family Association]] (AFA) opposing the prayer and carrying out a campaign to lobby senators to protest it.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Boorstein, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/27/AR2007072700206.html Hindu Groups Ask '08 Hopefuls to Criticize Protest], ''Washington Post'' (July 27, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://lasvegassun.com/news/2007/jul/13/a-prayer-and-protest/ A Prayer and Protest], ''Las Vegas Sun'' (July 13, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Their representative attacked the proceedings as "gross idolatry"&lt;ref name="news.bostonherald.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/news/national/politics/view.bg?articleid=1010979|title=Christian protesters disrupt first Senate prayer by a Hindu|date=July 12, 2007|work=[[Boston Herald]]|accessdate=20 March 2011|location=Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The AFA sent out an "Action Alert" to its members to e-mail, write letters, or call their Senators to oppose the Hindu prayer, stating it is "seeking the invocation of a non-monotheistic god."&lt;ref name="Hindu Prayer in Senate Disrupted"&gt;"[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19729245/ Hindu Prayer in Senate Disrupted]." [[Associated Press]] (published on [[MSNBC]]). 2007-06-12.

[[Barry W. Lynn]], executive director of [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]], said the protest "shows the intolerance of many [[Christian right|religious right]] activists. They say they want more religion in the public square, but it's clear they mean only their religion."&lt;ref name="news.bostonherald.com"/&gt;

==== California Textbook Controversy ====
{{Main article|California textbook controversy over Hindu history}}
A controversy in the US state of California concerning the portrayal of [[Hinduism]] in history textbooks began in 2005. The protest was led by Vedic Foundation (VF) and the American Hindu Education Foundation (HEF) by complaining to the California's Curriculum Commission, saying the coverage in sixth grade history [[textbooks]] of [[Indian history]] and Hinduism was biased against Hinduism; and points of contention includes a textbook's portrayal of the [[Caste system in India|caste system]], the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory]], and the [[status of women in Indian society]] as the main features of Hinduism.

The [[California Department of Education]] (CDE) initially sought to resolve the controversy by appointing Shiva Bajpai, Professor Emeritus at [[California State University Northridge]], as a one-man committee to review revisions proposed by the groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.flonnet.com/fl2301/stories/20060127000807700.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220161440/http://www.flonnet.com/fl2301/stories/20060127000807700.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-02-20|title=A saffron assault abroad|last=flrvs|website=wayback.archive.org|access-date=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Witzel|Micheal Witzel]] and others revisited the proposed changed on behalf of the [[California State Board of Education|State Board of Education]] and suggested reverting some of the approved changes.&lt;ref name="in.rediff.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://in.rediff.com/news/2006/mar/19edu.htm|title=Hindu groups sue California Board of Education|newspaper=Rediff|access-date=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2006, the [[Hindu American Foundation]] sued the State Board over matters of process;&lt;ref name="in.rediff.com"/&gt; the case was settled in 2009.

==== Dotbusters ====
{{main article|Dotbusters}}
The [[Dotbusters]] was a [[hate group]] in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], that attacked and threatened [[South Asian]]s in the fall of 1987. The name originated from the fact that traditional [[Hindu]] women and girls wear a [[Bindi (decoration)|bindi]] on their forehead. In July 1987, they had a letter published in the [[Jersey Journal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/12/nyregion/in-jersey-city-indians-protest-violence.html|title=In Jersey City, Indians Protest Violence|last=Marriott|first=Michel|date=12 October 1987|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=1|accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that they would take any means necessary to drive the Indians out of Jersey City:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm writing about your article during july [sic] about the abuse of Indian People. Well I'm here to state the other side. I hate them, if you had to live near them you would also. We are an organization called dot busters. We have been around for 2 years. We will go to any extreme to get Indians to move out of Jersey City. If I'm walking down the street and I see a Hindu and the setting is right, I will hit him or her. We plan some of our most extreme attacks such as breaking windows, breaking car windows, and crashing family parties. We use the phone books and look up the name Patel. Have you seen how many of them there are? Do you even live in Jersey City? Do you walk down Central avenue and experience what its [sic] like to be near them: we have and we just don't want it anymore. You said that they will have to start protecting themselves because the police cannot always be there. They will never do anything. They are a weak [sic] race physically and mentally. We are going to continue our way. We will never be stopped.&lt;ref name="pluralism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pluralism.org/ocg/CDROM_files/hinduism/dot_busters.php|title=On Common Ground: World Religions in America - The Pluralism Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Battagliadicascina.jpg|thumb|300px|Copy of the ''Battle'' by Michelangelo's pupil [[Bastiano da Sangallo|Aristotele da Sangallo]]]]
The '''''Battle of Cascina''''' is a lost artwork by [[Michelangelo]].

==Origins==
The painting was commissioned from Michelangelo by [[Piero Soderini]], [[politician|statesman]] of the Democratic of Florence. It was intended to wall of the ''Salone dei Cinquecento'' in [[Palazzo Vecchio]]. The opposite wall was to be decorated by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who was commissioned to depict the [[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|Battle of Anghiari]]. The two battles were notable medieval Florentine victories. The [[Battle of Cascina]] was fought on 28 July 1364 between the troops of Florence and [[Pisa]], resulting in victory of the former. A thousand Pisans were killed and two hundred more were captured.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Description==
Michelangelo never completed the painting, but did produce a complete [[cartoon#Fine art|cartoon]] of the composition. The cartoon was copied by several artists, the most notable extant copy being by Michelangelo's pupil Sangallo. Some of Michelangelo's preparatory drawings also survive, along with prints of part of the scene by [[Marcantonio Raimondi]]. According to Michelangelo's biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]] the original cartoon was deliberately destroyed by Michelangelo's rival [[Bartolommeo Bandinelli]] because of his jealousy of its fame.

Michelangelo depicted a scene at the beginning of the battle when the Florentine army was initially taken by surprise when the Pisans attacked. He depicts Florentine soldiers bathing naked in the river [[Arno]] responding to a trumpet which warns them of the sudden Pisan attack. As the soldiers emerge from the river and buckle on their armour, they are threatened by shots from the Pisans. Several soldiers look or point towards the Pisan position to the left. One soldier has apparently been hit and fallen back into the river, while others leap energetically into action.

The chosen episode allowed Michelangelo to depict his favoured topic: the naked male figure in varieties of [[contrapposto]].

[[File:Bolus Herbarium Library top view.JPG|thumbnail|An aerial view of the Bolus Herbarium library in the Botany Building, Upper Campus, University of Cape Town]]
The '''Bolus Herbarium''' was established in 1865 from a donation by [[Harry Bolus]] of his extensive [[herbarium]] and library to the [[South African College]], which later became the [[University of Cape Town]].

Its collection of specimens numbers over 320 000, making it the third largest university herbarium in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plants.jstor.org/partner/BOL|title=The Bolus Herbarium, Global Plants on JSTOR|website=plants.jstor.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection is highly representative of the Cape Flora and also houses a large number of type specimens. The international herbarium abbreviation '''BOL''' is used when referring to the Bolus Herbarium.

The '''''British National Formulary''''' ('''BNF''') is a United Kingdom (UK) [[pharmacy|pharmaceutical]] reference book that contains a wide spectrum of information and advice on [[Medical prescription|prescribing]] and [[pharmacology]], along with specific facts and details about many [[medicine]]s available on the UK [[National Health Service]] (NHS).  Information within the BNF includes [[Indication (medicine)|indication(s)]], [[contraindication]]s, [[adverse effect|side effects]], [[Dose (biochemistry)|doses]], [[Drug prohibition law|legal classification]], names and prices of available proprietary and [[Generic drug|generic]] formulations, and any other notable points.&lt;ref name="BNF book"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.BNF.org/products/books/|title=BNF Publications - Books|publisher=[[BMJ (company)|BMJ Group]] and [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society]]|website=www.bnf.org|accessdate=16 August 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817060858/https://www.bnf.org/products/books/|archivedate=17 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though it is a national [[Formulary (pharmacy)|formulary]], it nevertheless also includes entries for some medicines which are not available under the NHS, and must be prescribed and/or purchased [[Private healthcare|privately]].  A symbol clearly denotes such drugs in their entry.

It is used by [[pharmacist]]s and [[Physician|doctors]] (both [[general practitioner]]s (GPs) and [[Specialty (medicine)|specialist practitioners]]), and by other prescribing [[Health care provider|healthcare professionals]] (such as [[nurse]]s, [[pharmacy technician]]s, [[paramedic]]s, and [[dentist]]s); as a reference for correct dosage, indication, interactions and side effects of drugs.  It is also used as a reassurance by those administering drugs, for example a nurse on a hospital ward, and even for patients and others seeking an authoritative source of advice on any aspect of [[pharmacotherapy]].

The [[British Pharmacopoeia|''British Pharmacopoeia'']] (BP) specifies quality standards for the making of drugs listed in the BNF.

==Development==
Many individuals and organisations contribute towards the preparation of the BNF.  It is jointly authored by the [[British Medical Association]] (BMA) and the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society]]; and is jointly published by the [[BMJ (company)|BMJ Group]] (which is owned by the BMA), and the [[Pharmaceutical Press]] (owned by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society).  It is published under the authority of a Joint Formulary Committee (JFC),&lt;ref name="BNF about"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bnf.org/about/|title=BNF Publications - About - Our organisation|publisher=[[BMJ (company)|BMJ Group]] and [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society]]|website=www.bnf.org|accessdate=16 August 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817060538/https://www.bnf.org/about/|archivedate=17 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which comprises representatives of the two professional bodies, and the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] (DoH).

Information on drugs is drawn from the manufacturers' product literature, medical and pharmaceutical literature, regulatory authorities and professional bodies.  Advice is constructed from clinical literature, and reflects, as far as possible, an evaluation of the evidence from diverse sources.  The BNF also takes account of authoritative national guidelines and emerging safety concerns.  In addition, the Joint Formulary Committee takes advice on all therapeutic areas from expert clinicians; this ensures that the BNF's recommendations are relevant to practice.  However, in September 2013, the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) in the UK opened a consultation on its draft decision not to give NICE accreditation to the processes to produce BNF publications following a review by an independent advisory committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/News/Press-and-Media/nice-seeks-views-to-inform-bnf-accreditation-decision|title=NICE seeks views to inform BNF accreditation decision|publisher=[[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]]|website=www.nice.org.uk|date=6 September 2013|accessdate=19 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813081107/http://www.nice.org.uk/News/Press-and-Media/nice-seeks-views-to-inform-bnf-accreditation-decision|archivedate=13 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was first published in 1949&lt;ref name="BNF about"/&gt; as the '''''National Formulary''''', with updated versions appearing every three years until 1976.  The fifth version in 1957 saw its name change to ''The British National Formulary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Anon|title=The British National Formulary|journal=[[British Medical Journal]]|volume=2|issue=5047|pages=758–759|year=1957|pmid=13460381|pmc=1962234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Wade|first1=O.

==Editions==
A new edition of the BNF book is published twice-yearly; in March and September.&lt;ref name="BNF book"/&gt;  {{As of|2017|September}}, the current edition is 74, which was published in September 2017.  It is a customary tradition that the colour of each new edition is radically different from the previous.&lt;ref name="BNF about"/&gt;

==Availability==
The BNF is presently available as a book, a website, and mobile applications - the latter for use on [[smartphone]]s and tablets.&lt;ref name="BNF about"/&gt;  The book is available for purchase, and the September edition is distributed to healthcare professionals in the UK at no direct cost to them.&lt;ref name="BNF book"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.evidence.nhs.uk/nhs-evidence-content/bnf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001024033/http://www.evidence.nhs.uk/nhs-evidence-content/bnf |archivedate=1 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  NHS workers and healthcare professionals in the [[HINARI]] group of developing nations are entitled to free access via [[MedicinesComplete]] following registration (requires provision of a name, an address, an email address, and a phone number).

The '''Collier County Museums''' represents five museums within [[Collier County, Florida|Collier County]], [[Florida]], United States. Each museum presents information on the history, heritage, culture and evolution of life and ecology in the [[Everglades]].

The ''Museum of the Everglades'' is located in the village of "[[Everglades City]]" and is a facility to learn about life in the local community. One museum is housed in a national historic landmark known as [[Everglades Laundry]].

The museums were established in 1978, and display the people, places, and events that mark the area's history. The museums offers five separate facilities, each providing a differing view of the area's past, covering both history and legends, and featuring the beaches, cypress forests, and grasslands of the [[Florida Everglades]]. The displays include subjects such as [[saber cat]]s and ancient civilizations, archaeological discoveries, inventions, trading posts, and cattle ranches.&lt;ref name="colliermuseums"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.colliermuseums.com/ | title=Home &amp;#124; Naples, Immokalee and Everglades, Florida | publisher=colliermuseums.com | accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="colliergov"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.colliergov.net/index.aspx?page=142 | title=Collier County: Collier County Museum | publisher=colliergov.net | accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''comparison of [[American football]] and [[rugby union]]''' is possible because of the games' shared origins, despite their dissimilarities.
[[File:France vs Tonga 2011 RWC (4).jpg|thumb|right|300px|A rugby union match from the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]] showing the sport's distinguishing feature: the ball carrier leads his team up-field, passing backwards in the event of a tackle]]

==Rules==

===Tackle===
In the event of a tackle in rugby the player may pass the ball behind him provided he is not on the ground. If the tackled player is on the ground, the ball must be released, allowing any other player (including the opposition) to pick up the ball (usually a ruck forms) and the play continues.  In the event of a tackle in American Football the play is concluded and the team on offense maintains possession usually if either the ball was advanced past the first down marker (resulting in a first down and a renewal of the down count) or else the down count advances (although if the play was the fourth down play and the ball is not advanced past the first down marker then the defensive team would gain possession).

===Forward pass===
In rugby union, it is against the law to throw (pass) the ball in a forward direction: a player in a position to receive such a pass would in most cases be [[offside (rugby)|offside]] anyway. In American football, a player behind the line of scrimmage (most often the [[quarterback]]) is permitted to throw the ball forward from behind the line of scrimmage, provided that only one forward pass may be attempted during each play. A player can attempt a forward pass if he has already received a backwards pass, provided he stays behind the line of scrimmage.

===Composition of teams===
Professional and most scholastic American football team play has evolved from a single team with all players except limited substitutions playing the entire game, to a specialized "[[Platoon system|platoon]]" system consisting of three separate units (offensive, defensive, and "special teams" used for kicking and punting) with only one of the three being on the field at a time. That is to say that in professional American football, the majority of players play in only one specialization (or "one side of the ball") &amp;ndash; however, every player is eligible to play in any specialization.

In rugby the teams are divided into eight forwards and seven backs. Both groups of players partake in attacking and defensive plays and are on the pitch at the same time. Only the eight forwards take part in the "set pieces", which are ways to contest ball possession when there is a minor rule infringement or the ball passes out of bounds. These set pieces are scrums, tests of strength, and line outs. A person's build and skill set determines which group they can play in. All forwards must be heavy and strong to scrummage well but not so heavy that they are too slow to partake in attacking plays. The backs are lighter and faster and include the expert kickers. The forwards numbered 1 to 8 are the players that need to have good all-round rugby skills as well as speed and strength. In professional rugby there are very few players who can play equally well in a variety of positions and most will play in the same position from youth. Every position in rugby has its own unique name (except for number 8) and associated skill base.

In most club and schoolhouse American Football, the majority of players play both offense and defense, only being substituted for injury. Substitutes in American football can return to the game at any stoppage in play. In rugby union, any player substituted off for any reason, except for a 'blood' injury, is prohibited from returning to the field of play (with the possible exception of front-row forwards). Rugby teams may make up to seven substitutions. Each team must field 15 players at the start of each match. Players who are bleeding may receive medical treatment off pitch and are replaced until they have stopped bleeding. If the bleeding has not stopped after 15 minutes of "real time", the player will be permanently substituted. This can be down to officials' discretion, depending at which level the sport is played, where only minor medical assistance is needed to make the player fit to return to the field of play. Ejected players in American football can be replaced with a substitute.

In rugby union there are two different punishments. A yellow card can be shown for lesser infringements, which leads to the player being off the pitch for 10 minutes whilst the team will play with one less player for that duration. For more serious offenses, such as eye gouging or stamping in some cases, players can be shown a red card, which means they are off the pitch for the rest of the match and the team plays the rest of the match with 14 players. Players who are red carded automatically face a disciplinary hearing, and can be banned for a period of time from one week to permanently depending on the level of offence. Also, in a televised match, rugby union players can be "cited" (by an independent [[citing commissioner]]) for an act of foul play for which the referee did not send the player off. This means that players who committed an act of foul play which the referee did not see, or was more serious than the referee thought, still face a disciplinary panel and possible suspension.

In American football, players are only disqualified for Unsportsmanlike Conduct and related penalties (Fighting, Palpably Unfair Acts, etc.).  Players sent off in this fashion must be replaced with another member of the team for the remainder of the game. In addition, disqualified players may be fined (in the NFL) and/or suspended (at all levels) for future games.

===Duration of game===
A rugby union game is divided into two halves of 40 minutes (or shorter for lower-grade games, and breaks given halfway through each half if playing conditions are considered to be extreme) separated by a half time period of up to 15 minutes in an [[Test match (rugby union)|international]] match. Most notably, a rugby union game will continue after the scheduled end of a half (half-time or full-time) until the ball becomes dead - any occurrence that would have play restart with a scrum or lineout, or when a team scores. This has led to some "nail-biting" finishes where teams losing by only a small margin work their way towards scoring, and games can go on several minutes over time. Something similar can occur at the end of either half in American football, though usually for only a few seconds of additional time, because a play that begins before the half expires continues until the ball is dead regardless of whether there is any time left on the clock. In both sports, the clock is also stopped during substitutions and for injuries, so the referee does not need to add [[stoppage time]] as is done in soccer/Association football. American football games are made up of four quarters of 15 minutes each (less at the high school and youth levels), but the clock stops and starts according to specific rules, so that a 15-minute quarter lasts much longer.

In the televised version of American football (both professional and major college level), the duration of such stoppages is often extended to accommodate the airing of commercial advertisements; this does not occur outside of the televised environment, where breaks in play are comparable to those in rugby union. In addition to this, the half-time break is typically 12 to 15 minutes; this intermission allows for resetting of strategy in both rugby and American football and adjusting to the opponent's schemes. During the American football halftime period, entertainment is provided for the fans in attendance, ranging from [[marching band]] performances in high school and college games to big-name entertainment for the [[Super Bowl]] (which usually has a longer-than-normal halftime in order to set up and break down whatever stage the halftime performer(s) will use). The entertainment in rugby varies from club to club but often includes kicking competitions involving members of the crowd, or youth rugby teams playing quick tournament games. Teams in the [[Super Rugby]] competition in the Southern Hemisphere often have [[cheerleader]]s and [[mascot]]s; however, very few rugby union teams in the northern hemisphere have cheerleaders.

===Game play===
In both sports, the essence of the game is to carry the ball over the opponent's goal line (Rugby requires the ball to be placed on the ground with downward pressure to score). In both sports the ball may be passed backwards an unlimited number of times, but in American football the ball may be passed forward once (and only once) as long as the passer is behind the line of scrimmage, as opposed to rugby union, where the ball cannot be passed forward but only kicked or carried forward. Even when kicked, only the kicker or players behind the kicker are allowed to catch or interfere with play.

In both sports, play is stopped when the ball goes out of bounds, when a player or team commits a foul or after any scoring play. In American football, play is also stopped when a player is ruled down or when a forward pass falls incomplete.

The forward pass and the stoppage when a player with the ball is downed results in short plays and a generally episodic game play in American football, as opposed to the longer and more fluid passages of play found in rugby union. If a player in rugby is tackled then the ball must be released and any player arriving at the scene may pick up the ball and run with it. If two or more opposing players arrive at the same time then a ruck is formed and the players push each other to get at the ball before play continues.

In rugby, kicking during the flow of the game is done for tactical reasons (both offensive and defensive) or to score a goal. If the ball is recovered by the kicking team, it can lead to significant improvement in field position. It is also legal in rugby to kick at goal at any point in the game. This is called a drop goal. In American football, a team that kicks the ball during play automatically gives up possession and cannot recover the ball unless an error in catching the ball (drop), or while running after catching (fumble) is made by the receiving team; because of this, punting is typically done only when teams do not expect to be able to retain possession (i.e. on fourth down). Additionally, rule changes made in the early twentieth century mandated that field goals cannot be made in front of the line of scrimmage; this has led to the demise of the drop-kick field goal in American football. Catching (or recovering) and blocking kicked balls are integral skills in rugby as well as in American football.

==Origins==
{{see also|Rugby union in the United States#History}}

Various forms of football have been played in Britain for centuries with different villages and schools having their own traditional rules.

[[The Football Association]] was formed in England in October 1863. Differences of opinion about the proposed laws led to the formation of the first governing body for rugby, the [[Rugby Football Union]] in 1871. Laws were drawn up for [[rugby football]] which was now distinct from [[football (soccer)|Association football]] (soccer).

In 1872 rugby clubs were established in the [[San Francisco]] [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]], which were composed mainly of British [[expatriates]]. The first recorded rugby match in the United States occurred on May 14, 1874 between [[Harvard University]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts and [[McGill University]] of Montreal, Quebec when McGill challenged Harvard to a game using rules in place at the Montreal campus.

In 1876, [[Yale University|Yale]], Harvard, [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and [[Columbia University|Columbia]] formed the Intercollegiate Football Association, a competition based on the traditional rules of rugby. The sport of [[American football]] evolved from these intercollegiate games (see [[History of American football]]).

Back in England, a schism developed between those who favoured amateurism (southern English teams) and those who felt that players should be compensated for time taken off work to play rugby (northern teams). In 1895, this resulted in the formation of a break-away governing body, the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]]. The [[History of rugby league|schism in English rugby]] was caused by several economic factors for the northern clubs which made up the majority of the teams.

The Northern Union began to make changes to the laws of rugby in 1906, which resulted in the sport of [[rugby league]]. The Rugby Football Union's version of rugby became known as [[rugby union]] after its governing body. Rugby is played in 120 countries, is extremely popular in England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, France, Italy, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Uruguay, Madagascar, Kenya, Namibia, Tonga, Samoa, Fiji and Japan. American football is popular almost exclusively in the United States and Canada.

Currently rugby has large national club championships (such as the [[Premiership Rugby|English Premiership]], [[Top 14]], [[Currie Cup]]), major continental club championships (like the [[European Rugby Champions Cup]] and [[Super Rugby]]) and major international championships, highlighting the [[Rugby World Cup]], the 3rd most watched sporting event in the world. Gridiron football major championships are limited to just national competitions in the United States ([[NFL]]) and Canada ([[Canadian Football League|CFL]]), has recently been gaining acceptance in European competition ([[NFL Europe]], which had its last edition in 2007), and the only competition between national teams is the [[IFAF World Championship]], which is not considered a major event when compared to the [[Olympic Games]], [[FIFA World Cup]] and the [[Rugby World Cup]].

===Dimensions===
The dimensions of an American football field are measured in [[United States customary units]] (essentially the same as British [[Imperial units]]). Rugby union originally marked and quoted its measurements in Imperial but converted to [[Metric units]] in 1977.&lt;ref name="espnscrum1"&gt;http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/story/116127.html&lt;/ref&gt;  When these conversions were made the measurements were generally adjusted to the closest round-number measurement in the metric system.

Although both codes are played on similar sized rectangular fields, the dimensions of rugby union fields can vary up to a maximum size that is larger than the fixed size of American football fields. Rugby union fields are limited to a maximum length of {{convert|144|m|yd}} long ({{convert|100|m|yd}} between goal lines) and width of {{convert|70|m|yd}}, while American football fields have a fixed length of {{convert|120|yd|m}} ({{convert|100|yd|m}} between goal lines) and a width of {{convert|160|ft|m}}. The scoring ''[[end zone]]'' in American football has a fixed depth of {{convert|10|yd|m}} whilst in Rugby Union the goal area must be between a minimum depth of {{convert|10|m|yd}} and a maximum of {{convert|22|m|yd}} between the goal line and the dead ball line at the rear of the field.

===Lines===

====Boundary lines====
An American football ''field'' is bordered by ''sidelines'' and ''end lines''. A rugby union ''pitch'' has ''touchlines'' and ''dead-ball lines'' respectively. True to its rugby roots, the boundary lines in American football are also out of play (unlike in the majority of other sports where being in contact with the line means that the player or ball is still in-play).

====Major interior lines====
In both rugby and American football all the major interior lines run transversely across the playing area.

The border between the regular field of play and a scoring zone in both sports is called the '''goal line''' (though it is more commonly referred to as the ''try line'' in rugby union).

The playing field of rugby is divided into halves by a '''halfway line'''. An American football field has a '''50 yard line''' which is sometimes referred to as the ''midfield line''. On an American football field there are a further 18 solid '''yard lines''' crossing the field, marked at {{convert|5|yd|m}} intervals between each goal-line and the 50 yard line. These lines are named for the distance that they are from the nearest goal line, for example 5 yard line, 10 yard line, 35 yard line, etc. Rugby union pitches have only two further solid lines called the '''22 metre lines'''. They are so called because they are marked {{convert|22|m|yd}} from the goal lines. This unusual distance exists because rugby changed from [[Imperial units]] to [[Metric units]] in 1977; the line had previously been a 25-yard-line. The metric equivalent of 25 yards is 22.86 metres which should round to 23 metres; some sources&lt;ref name="espnscrum1"/&gt; argue that the reason for rounding down to 22 was to further restrict players within the 1968 25-yard line kicking law; a rule that had been introduced to encourage more running play.

In rugby, the kickoff to begin each half and restarts after scores are taken from the halfway line whereas in American football these can be taken from the 30, 35 or 40 yard line depending on if it is a college, NFL or high-school game. The yard lines of American football are vitally important during game play because a team's advance is measured against them which, in turn, determines possession of the ball. The 22 metre lines in rugby union effectively divide the field into approximate quarters (though not always as rugby pitches vary in size; the total length of the field of play must not exceed 100m but can be shorter than that if space is limited). The 22 metre lines determine the position from which ''drop-outs'' are taken and also mark the limit where a defending player may kick-the ball directly (without bouncing) into touch without losing the ground gained by the kick.

====Minor transverse interior lines====
In American football there is a '''2 yard line''' (for NFL 2-point conversions), '''15 yard line''' (for NFL 1-point conversions) or ''3 yard line'' (college and high-school) which is sometimes called the PAT (point after touchdown) line. This is a short line marked the appropriate distance from the goal line directly in front of the posts and is where the line of scrimmage forms when one team has scored and is attempting a conversion. In rugby union there are two broken lines that cross the whole pitch marked ten metres either side of the halfway line. These are called the '''10 metre lines''' and mark the minimum distance restart kicks must travel and the forward limit of where the receiving team can stand to receive these kicks.

In American football there are also four '''hash marks''' (one near each side line and a pair either side of the longitudinal center of the field) marked every yard between the major transverse lines. Though these technically run across the pitch they can more usefully be regarded as longitudinal lines because each hash mark is only a yard long and they are so numerous that they create more obvious pattern down the field than across it (see below).

In rugby union there is a line '''five metres from the goal line''' indicated by a series of six short dashes marked 5 metres in from touch, 15 metres in from touch and directly in front of each post (these are frequently called the five metre line though they technically have no name the 5 metre lines are longitudinal lines 5 metres in from touch). These are marked to assist the referee because no set-piece (scrum or line-out) may take place within five metres of the goal line.

====Minor longitudinal interior lines====
As described above, in American football there are four longitudinal lines made up of yard-long ''hashes''. These '''hash marks''' are marked at one yard intervals between each yard line and parallel to them. They further assist the umpires to determine how far the ball has been advanced each down and the central pair also mark the widest point at which any play may be initiated; all plays start with the ball on or between the middle pair of hash marks. In professional football these central hash marks are the same width as the goalposts (18 feet, 6 inches wide), in college football they are 40 feet apart and in high school football they are 53 feet, 4 inches apart.

In rugby there are four longitudinal dotted lines. Two are marked 5 metres in from the touch lines and two a further ten metres in. These are the '''5 metre lines''' and '''15 metre lines''' respectively. These are used to determine where players making up the ''line-out'' are allowed to stand before the throw-in. The five metre line also assists the referee because scrums may not be set within five metres of the touch line.

Both codes also have goalposts at each end of the field: on the goal-line in the case of rugby union; but further back in American football on the back of the end zone.

American football goalposts were formerly H-shaped and were located on the goal line, but; in 1967, the NFL adopted the current modern offset-fork design, made from extruded steel pipes. The goalposts currently consist of two vertical posts {{convert|18.5|ft|m}} apart ({{convert|24|ft|m}} in high school football) rising from a horizontal crossbar, which is mounted on a single central support post that raises the crossbar to a height of {{convert|10|ft|m}}, resulting in a two-tined fork shape. The central vertical post is offset from the crossbar toward the rear, placing it as far as possible from the field of play; it is also usually padded to minimize collision-related injuries. In 1974, in the effort to create a safer, unimpeded field of play in the end zone, calculated to produce more passing touchdowns, the NFL relocated the goalposts from the goal line to the end line.

Rugby union goalposts are {{convert|5.6|m|ft}} apart and extend vertically from the ground being connected by a crossbar at {{convert|3|m|ft}}, creating an H-shape. In both cases, only kicks passing between the uprights and above the crossbar score points. The scoring areas of both types of goalposts are technically infinite as there is no top boundary.

==Advancing the ball==
In American football, the team that is in possession of the ball, the offense, has four [[Down (football)|downs]] to advance the ball 10 yards towards the opponent's end zone. If the offense gains 10 yards, it gets another set of four downs. If the offense fails to gain 10 yards after four downs, it loses possession of the ball.

The ball is put into play by a [[Snap (American football)|snap]]. All players line up facing each other at or behind the [[line of scrimmage]]. One offensive player, the [[Center (football)|center]], then passes (or "snaps") the ball between his legs to a teammate, usually the [[quarterback]].

Players can then advance the ball in two ways:
* By running with the ball, also known as [[Rush (football)|rushing]]. One ball-carrier can hand the ball to another; this is known as a '''handoff'''. A ball-carrier can also perform a '''lateral''' or backward pass as in rugby.
* By [[forward pass|passing the ball forwards]] to a teammate as long as the passer is behind the line of scrimmage.

A down ends, and the ball becomes dead, after any of the following:
* The player with the ball is tackled.
* A forward pass goes out of bounds or touches the ground before it is caught. This is known as an [[incomplete pass]]. The ball is returned to the original line of scrimmage for the next down.
* The ball or the player with the ball goes out of bounds.
* A team scores.

Rugby union is based on the 'right to contest possession'. A team is not required to surrender possession when the ball carrier is tackled, in contrast to American football, where a team must surrender their possession when a player is tackled and no downs remain. Rugby union players must win possession in open play, unless the team in possession makes an infringement, scores, or the ball leaves the field of play.

A team in rugby union can advance the ball in two ways:

* By running forward with the ball. The ball carrier typically passes to a teammate just before he is tackled, to permit another player to continue the run towards the try line, thus quickly gaining ground. The ball carrier cannot pass to any teammate that is closer to the try line. This would be a forward pass, which is illegal. The player may also attempt to form a maul and push their way to the try line.
* By kicking the ball forwards and attempting to recover it. Only the kicker or players behind the kicker are allowed to recover the ball otherwise it is classed as a forward pass and a penalty awarded (illegal in American Football, unless the ball is first touched by another player). It is also possible to keep the ball within a scrum (with the feet) &amp; push the opposition backwards. This is normally only attempted when a scrum has been set very close to the oppositions try line.

In rugby the method of attack is typically decided by the person in the number ten jersey (the flyhalf). Once the forwards gain possession of the ball after a scrum, line out or ruck the ball is usually passed to this player who is the midpoint between the forwards and the backs. He/she must read the opposition's defensive strategy and calls a play accordingly, either running, passing or kicking to other players. After the set piece or ruck the no.10 is the first player who has time to control the play and must therefore be an expert at a wide variety of kicks and an expert passer. The rule differences mean that there are a wider variety of kicks and kicking strategies in rugby compared to American football.

Possession may change in different ways in both games:

# When the ball is kicked to the opposing team; this can be done at any time but it is normal to [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]] on the last down in American football when out of field goal range.
# Following an unsuccessful kick at goal.
# When an opposing player [[Interception|intercepts]] a pass.
# When the player in possession drops the ball and it is recovered by an opposition player. This is called a [[fumble]] in American football.
# In rugby union the opposition are awarded a [[scrum (rugby union)|scrum]] if the player in possession drops the ball forwards or makes the ball go forwards with any part of his body other than his feet and the opposition are unable to gain an advantage from the lost possession. This is called a ''knock-on''.
# In rugby union if the ball goes out of play, the opposition are awarded a [[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]], this is called [[ball back]]. However, if the ball was kicked out of play as the result of the awarding of a penalty the team that kicked the ball out throws the ball in. Both teams can contest in a line-out.
# In American football possession changes hands following a successful score with the scoring team ''kicking off'' to the opposition. In rugby union the team who conceded the score must kick off to the team who scored.
# In American football, an automatic handover takes place when the team in possession runs out of downs.

In both codes, tactical kicking is an important aspect of play. In American football, it is normal to [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]] on the last down, but, as in rugby union, a kick can take place at any phase of play.

==Passing==

In American football, the offense can throw the ball forward once on a play from behind the line of scrimmage. The [[forward pass]] is a distinguishing feature of American and Canadian football as it is strictly forbidden in rugby.

The ball can be thrown sideways or backwards without restriction in both games. In American football this is known as a [[Lateral pass|lateral]] and is much less common than in rugby union.  However designed laterals (often known as pitches) which take place behind the line of scrimmage are quite common in American football and are often a way that a ball is transferred from the quarterback to a running back on sweep plays or to a wide receiver on speed sweeps or a reverse.

In both codes, if the ball is caught by an opposition player this results in an [[interception]] and possession changes hands.

==Tackles and blocks==
{{further|tackle (football move)}}

In both games it is permitted to bring down the player in possession of the ball and prevent him or her from making forward progress. In rugby, unlike in American football, the ball is still in play. Players from either team can take possession of the ball. The tackled player must present the ball (release the ball) so that open play can continue.

Rugby union rules do not allow tackles above the plane of the shoulders. Only the player who has possession of the ball can be tackled. The attacker must also attempt to wrap his or her arms around the player being tackled: merely pushing the player being tackled to ground with a shoulder is illegal. If a maul or ruck is formed, a player may not "ram" into the formation without first binding to the players.

In American football, tacklers are not required to wrap their arms around the ball carrier before bringing him to the ground; in fact, the ball carrier is often "tackled" by the defender taking a running start and hitting the ball carrier to knock him to the ground. Tackles can also be made by grabbing the ball carrier's jersey and pulling him to the ground (though pulling down a ball carrier from behind by the pads or jersey behind his neck is known as a "horse collar", a move now illegal at all levels of the American game). If a ball carrier is stopped for more than a few seconds, the referee can blow the whistle, declare the player's forward progress stopped, and end the play even though the ball carrier is not actually tackled to the ground.

In American football, players are allowed to 'block' players without the ball. This is not permitted in rugby union and would be considered 'obstruction', resulting in a penalty.

==Scoring==

A [[touchdown]] is the American football equivalent of the rugby [[try]]. Unlike American football, both codes of rugby require the ball to be grounded, whereas in American football it is sufficient for the ball to enter the [[end zone]] (in-goal area) when in the possession of a player. In American football a touchdown scores 6 points; in rugby union a try is worth 5 points.

Rugby also allows for a [[Try#Penalty try|penalty try]], awarded by the referee when he believes that a try has been prevented by the defending team's misconduct. In comparison, American football allows the referee to declare that a "[[Palpably unfair act]]" was committed by the defending team: the referee is allowed in such a situation (at his discretion) to award a score (most commonly a touchdown) or other penalty (in amateur play, including forfeiture of the game). In practice, however, such a call is extremely rare and limited to extreme circumstances, such as a player who was not in the game at the start of the play running off of the sidelines and tackling the player with the ball, as was the case in the [[1954 Cotton Bowl Classic]]. In high school football, this can also be called if the defense commits repeated and intentional fouls at the goal line.

In both games, following a try / touchdown, there is the opportunity to score additional points by kicking the ball between the posts and over the bar. In American football this is called an [[extra point]] (worth 1 point); in rugby union it is known as a [[Try#Conversion|conversion]] (worth 2 points). (The result is that both the touchdown/extra point combination and the try/conversion combination, when successful, total to 7 points.) One key difference between an extra point and a conversion is that a conversion kick must be taken from a position in line with where the try was scored, although the distance from the try line from which the conversion kick is taken is not fixed. Hence, it is advantageous to ground the ball under the posts rather than in the corner which makes for a more difficult kick. Also, American football features the option of the going for a 2-point conversion, where the attacking team gets one chance from 3 yards out (2 in the NFL) to get the ball in the endzone again. This would be worth 2 points on top of the 6 already awarded for the touchdown. Plus, all American football, except high school (all but Massachusetts &amp; Texas), allows conversion turnovers that are returned for touchdowns to be given 2 points.

In American football teams often opt to go for a [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] (worth 3 points) rather than attempt a touchdown, either because it is fourth down and they don't want to risk a turnover or because it is late in the game and the three points will either tie the game or put the team ahead. The rugby equivalent is a [[drop goal]] (worth 3 points). The key difference between a field goal and a drop goal is that a field goal attempt is normally kicked with a teammate holding the ball, whereas in rugby the ball must hit the ground and be kicked immediately as it touches the ground.

In American football, a field goal is generally kicked from seven yards behind the line of scrimmage, with the "holder" receiving a "long snap" from the center. This is the optimum distance for a kick to be made before the defensive team can break through the line of scrimmage to block the kick. When calculating the distance of a kick, one adds seven yards to the line of scrimmage, then adds ten more to account for the end zone (as the goal posts are in the back of the end zone)  Therefore, if the line of scrimmage is the 20-yard line, a field goal taken from there would be a 37-yard kick - the ball would be set down for the kick at the 27, plus 10 yards for the end zone.

Because of the mechanics of the kick, field goals are only attempted from a very specific range. In the modern NFL any kick under 40 yards is considered very makeable and should be converted by a competent kicker. Kicks from 40-45 yards are considered more challenging, but usually makeable, kicks from the 50 yard range are considered difficult. Kicks from 55 or more yards are considered extremely difficult, and are normally only attempted in dire situations at the end of the game when the field goal would tie or win the game. The record for longest field goal is 64 yards, which has been done once by [[Matt Prater]] in 2013. A 65-yard kick by [[Ola Kimrin]] was made during a preseason exhibition game in 2002, but preseason games are not included in record keeping. Notably, the 64- and the 65-yard kicks were made in [[Denver, Colorado]], where the elevation is {{convert|5,280|ft|m}}.

A similar concept in rugby is the [[Penalty (rugby)|penalty goal]]. Following the award of the penalty, the attacking team may opt to kick for goal rather than advance the ball by hand or punting, or forming a scrum. This scores 3 points. The penalty goal is similar to a field goal in American football in that the ball is kicked from the ground, but it cannot be charged. There is no direct equivalent to a penalty goal in American football. A rare play called a "[[fair catch kick]]" is analogous to a [[goal from mark]] which existed in rugby union at one time.

American football has one further method of scoring which does not exist in rugby. If the team with possession causes the ball to enter its own endzone, and the ball carrier is then tackled while within the endzone, then this results in a [[Safety (American football score)|safety]] which scores 2 points for the non-possessing team and then requires the possessing team to give up the ball by kicking to its opponent. In rugby union this does not score any points but results in a scrum 5 meters from the try zone with the team that didn't put the ball into the in-goal area putting the ball in.

In rugby, If the ball is put past the try line by the attacking team, into the in-goal area, by means of kicking, passing or running and the receiving team grounds it or makes it dead immediately, a drop kick from the 22-metre line ensues. In American football, if a kick-off or punt goes into the endzone and the receiving team downs it without leaving the endzone, the result is a "touch back" and the receiving team gains possession of the ball at their own 20-yard (25 yard line in College Football) line.

An important difference between the two sports involves the aftermath of a score. In American football, the scoring team kicks off, except after a safety. In rugby union, the team conceding the score kicks off (in [[rugby sevens]], a variant of rugby union featuring seven players per side, the scoring team kicks off).

==Players==
{{further|American football positions|Rugby union positions}}

An American football team consists of an offensive unit, a defensive unit and a "special teams" unit (involved in kicking and kick returns). Only eleven players can be on the field at any time. Players are allowed to play on more than one of the units, this is the norm for all but the highest levels of play (professional and large schools). The kicking unit, with the exception of a few specialists, will usually be made up of reserve players from the offense and defense.

In rugby union, the same players have to both defend and attack. There are fifteen players in a rugby union team (except in [[rugby sevens|sevens]] and tens).
Many of the positions in each code have similar names, but, in practice, the roles of those positions can be different. A [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] in American football is very different from a [[Fullback (rugby union)|fullback]] in rugby. Some of the positions are fairly similar; a Rugby [[fly-half]] carries out a similar role to a [[quarterback]] in American football; however, quarterbacks touch the ball on almost every offensive play.

Broadly speaking [[Lineman (American football)|linemen]] and [[linebacker]]s in American football correspond to [[Forwards (rugby union)|forwards]] in rugby, and [[running back]]s, receivers, and quarterbacks have roles similar to [[Rugby union positions#Backs|backs]] in rugby.

Because of the playing time, number of pauses, number of players and the nature of the game in general, rugby players will typically need higher physical endurance than American football players while more short-term bursts of physical strength, power, and speed will be required in American football (amongst equivalent positions and weights). Collisions between players in American football tend to cause greater injury than in rugby union; in rugby union tackles must at least show an attempt to bind is made but this rule does not apply to American football. Moreover, rugby union hits are not usually at the speed of American football both because of the nature of the game and the lack of protective equipment. Additionally, rugby offsides rules and the lack of a forward pass significantly reduce the chance of a player receiving a "blind-side" hit (i.e. being hit and/or tackled from behind). In American football, players receiving a forward pass are often extremely vulnerable because they must concentrate on catching the ball, often jumping very high or stretching out and thereby exposing their body to punishing hits; in rugby a player is not allowed to be tackled in the air, leaving the receiver of the kick with more time to assess his surroundings, usually in rugby ball carriers can anticipate a hit and can brace themselves accordingly.

In rugby, the contact times between players are usually much longer, as a more wrestling approach is required to bring players down, as momentum cannot always be relied upon particularly when the lines between the teams are consistently close, not allowing for significant momentum to be developed before meeting a defender. In rugby, [[Playing rugby union#Ruck|rucks]] and [[Playing rugby union#Maul|mauls]] may develop following a tackle when multiple players from each team bind together to move the ball in play (on the ground or in-hand respectively). In American football, equivalents to rucks and mauls are virtually non existent, as play stops when the ball is stopped. These difference can be summed up in the idea that in American football the objective is to bring the player to ground or to disrupt a pass to end the play, whereas in rugby the main objective is to stop the player from breaking the line.

American football quarterbacks, linebackers, - and increasingly, their coaches - have the ability to decide what the next play would be in many occasions during the game, thus allowing for both complex tactics displayed within individual plays and overall game-wide strategy in play calling and play selection. In rugby union, the continuous nature of the game implies that there is no time to discuss team strategy, therefore offensive actions may seem to lack a definite direction for some periods of time. Rugby is more movement based than American football in which short bursts are needed.

Rugby players often continue to participate in the game long after they have left school. In America, amateurs who have left school rarely play full tackle football, but often play [[Touch football (American)|touch football]] or [[flag football]].

==Attire==

[[Rugby union]] players are allowed to wear modest padding on the head, shoulders and collarbone, but it must be sufficiently light, thin and compressible to meet [[World Rugby]] standards, and the vast majority of players play with only a gumshield for protection. Protective headgear is becoming more popular with players with a history of concussion or who wish to protect their ears from damage (usually front or second rows). Hard plastic or metal are prohibited in rugby kit. This includes hard plastic shin guards. No form of metal is allowed in any rugby kit, except for World Rugby-approved soft aluminium studs on boots.

The prohibition of metal resulted in one of the most unusual pieces of protective gear ever seen in any sport in a [[2009–10 Heineken Cup|2010 Heineken Cup]] semifinal between [[Biarritz Olympique|Biarritz]] and [[Munster Rugby|Munster]]. Biarritz star [[Imanol Harinordoquy]] had suffered a broken nose in a [[Top 14|domestic]] encounter with [[Racing 92|Racing Métro]]'s [[Sébastien Chabal]], and had undergone surgery to repair it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/rugby_union/article7113972.ece |title=Biarritz bank on Imanol Harinordoquy in today’s big semi-final |first=Stephen |last=Jones |publisher=''[[The Times]]'' |date=2010-05-02 |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received approval to wear a mask to protect the injury, but had to have the frame covered by more than {{convert|2|in|cm}} of foam padding; at least one journalist likened Harinordoquy to the [[Man in the Iron Mask]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/club/7724432/Imanol-Harinordoquy-tests-the-pain-barrier-in-search-of-Heineken-Cup-glory.html|title=Imanol Harinordoquy tests the pain barrier in search of Heineken Cup glory |first=Brendan |last=Gallagher |publisher=''[[telegraph.co.uk]]'' |date=2010-05-15 |accessdate=2010-08-28}} The article features a photo of Harinordoquy in the mask.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often considered an essential (though not mandatory) part of the safety equipment needed for rugby is the gumshield or mouthguard. Players also have the option to use fingerless gloves which have been introduced recently to the game allowing players to better grip the ball.

[[American football]] players wear much bulkier protective equipment, such as a padded plastic [[football helmet|helmet]], [[shoulder pads]], hip pads and knee pads. These protective pads were introduced decades ago and have improved ever since to help minimize lasting injury to players. An American football helmet consists of a hard plastic top with thick padding on the inside, a facemask made of one or more metal bars, and a chinstrap used to secure the helmet. An [[unintended consequence]] of all the safety equipment has resulted in increasing levels of force in the game which, unprotected and in current form, would now be extremely dangerous. An example of this is the trend for players tackling head first rather than leading with a shoulder, which has led to some serious neck injuries, including breaks, even with the helmets used. In previous years with less padding, tackling more closely resembled tackles in [[rugby union]], with less severe impacts and less severe structural injuries.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

'''Video converters''' are [[computer program]]s that can change the storage format of digital video. They may recompress the video to another format in a process called [[transcoding]], or may simply change the [[Digital container format|container format]] without changing the video format. The disadvantages to transcoding are that there is [[Transcoding#Drawbacks|quality loss]] when transcoding between [[lossy compression]] formats, and that the process is highly [[CPU]] intensive.

This article compares video converters that have their own article on Wikipedia.

The '''Corning Museum of Glass''' is a [[museum]] in [[Corning (city), New York|Corning, New York]] dedicated to the art, history and science of [[glass]]. It was founded in 1951 by [[Corning Incorporated|Corning Glass Works]] and currently has a collection of more than 45,000 glass objects, some over 3,500 years old.&lt;ref name=aboutus&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us: Corning Museum of Glass|url=http://www.cmog.org/about#.UUNVGhycd8E|publisher=Corning Museum of Glass|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Founded in 1951 by Corning Glass Works (now [[Corning Incorporated]]) as a gift to the nation for the company’s 100th anniversary, the Corning Museum of Glass is a not-for-profit museum dedicated to telling the story of a single material: glass. [[Thomas S. Buechner]], who would later become director of the [[Brooklyn Museum]], was the founding director of the glass museum, serving in the post from 1951 to 1960 and again from 1973 to 1980.

=== Growth and renovations ===
[[File:CorningGlassTower.jpg|thumb|250px|Tower sculpture consisting of 600 glass bowls]]
The original Museum and library were housed in a low, glass-walled building designed by [[Harrison &amp; Abramovitz]] in 1951. By 1978, the Museum had outgrown its space.  [[Gunnar Birkerts]] designed a new addition, creating a flowing series of galleries with the library at their core, linked to the old building via light-filled, windowed ramps. With memories of the 1972 hurricane still fresh (see Flood Damage), the new galleries were raised high above the flood line on concrete pillars. The new Museum opened to the public on May 28, 1980, exactly 29 years after its first opening.

By the early 1990s, the Corning Museum of Glass was once more overflowing its exhibition space, and increasing visitation put a strain on guest facilities. In 1996, the Museum embarked upon the first phase of a planned five-year, $65 million transformation. Under the directorship of Dr. [[David Whitehouse]], the first element to be added was The Studio. This state-of-the-art teaching facility for glassblowing and coldworking opened for classes in 1996.

Architects Smith-Miller + Hawkinson designed an addition to the main Museum building, using glass wherever possible to convey the beauty and elegance of the art form in the building itself. The Museum's renovation was completed in 2001, and included a new visitors' center, Sculpture Gallery, (now the Contemporary Glass Gallery), Hot Glass Show demonstration stage and a hands-on Innovation Center with exhibitions designed by [[Ralph Appelbaum Associates]]. A redesigned 18,000-square-foot (1,700 m2) GlassMarket, one of the largest Museum shops in the country, filled the entire first floor of the museum. The Rakow Library was relocated to new quarters across the Museum campus.

Over the past decade, the Museum’s collection, programs, and global impact have grown significantly. At the beginning of 2012, the Museum announced a $64 million expansion project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperallergic.com/52558/corning-museum-of-glass-thomas-phifer-and-partners-expansion/ |title=Largest Contemporary Glass Museum to Open in Upstate NY |publisher=Hyperallergic.com |date=2012-06-06 |accessdate=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed by [[Thomas Phifer]], to expand contemporary gallery and Hot Glass Show space. The new contemporary wing is slated to open in March 2015.&lt;ref name=june2012pr&gt;{{cite web|last=Sterbenk|first=Yvette|title=Corning Museum of Glass Unveils Plans for $64 Million Expansion|url=https://news.yahoo.com/corning-museum-glass-unveils-plans-64-million-expansion-110345959.html|work=June 6, 2012|publisher=Corning Museum of Glass|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stargazette.com/story/news/local/2015/01/25/cmog-contemporary-glass/22313897/ |title=Corning glass museum acquires new contemporary pieces |publisher=Stargazette.com |date=2015-01-25 |accessdate=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Cornings-glass-museum-acquires-contemporary-works-for-new-wing/36817 ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flood damage ===
In June 1972, disaster struck as [[Hurricane Agnes]] emptied a week's worth of rain into the surrounding Chemung River Valley. On June 23, the Chemung River overflowed its banks and poured five feet four inches of floodwater into the Museum. When the waters receded, staff members found glass objects tumbled in their cases and crusted with mud, the library's books swollen with water. The case holding 600 rare books tipped over, and the books were covered by mud and shards of glass panes. Half of the entire Library collection was damaged in the flood. According to Martin and Edwards, 528 of the Museum's 13,000 objects had sustained damage (1977, 11)&lt;ref name="flood"/&gt; At the time, Buechner described the flood as "possibly the greatest single catastrophe borne by an American museum."&lt;ref name="flood"/&gt;  Conservation was an immediate concern and staff moved quickly to freeze the flooded materials. Museum staff members, under the directorship of  [[Robert H. Brill]] were faced with the tremendous task of restoration: every glass object had to be meticulously cleaned and restored, while the library's contents had to be cleaned and dried page by page, slide by slide, even before being assessed for rebinding, restoration, or replacement.&lt;ref name=flood&gt;{{cite book|title=The Corning Flood: Museum Under Water|year=1977|publisher=Corning Museum of Glass|location=Corning, New York|isbn=087290-063-0|page=60|url=http://www.cmog.org/sites/default/files/collections/FF/FFAE9039-62D0-4450-A0ED-ACE0BD397297.pdf|editor=Martin, John H.|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the extensive recovery efforts, the Library occupied an abandoned Acme grocery store across the street from the Museum. Altogether, staff and volunteers dried, cleaned, and restored over 7,000 water-logged, frozen books over the next 2 years. The rare books were sent to Carolyn Horton, a leading restoration expert, who disassembled, washed, deacidified and rebound them. On August 1, 1972, the Museum reopened with restoration work still underway.

== The Glass Collection ==
=== Galleries ===
The Museum's Glass Collection showcases more than 35 centuries of glass artistry. The Museum's collection of contemporary artworks includes pieces by significant artists such as [[Klaus Moje]], [[Karen LaMonte]], [[Bruno Pedrosa]], [[Dale Chihuly]], [[Libenský / Brychtová]] and [[Josiah McElheny]]. The Glass Collection Galleries show the most comprehensive and celebrated glass collection in the world. The galleries explore Near Eastern, Asian, European, and American glass and glassmaking from antiquity through present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Lawrence|first=Lee|date=August 9, 2011|title=Art, technology, design, crisscrossing the globe [exhibition review]|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303544604576429774286392838 | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They tell the story of glass creation, from a full-scale model of an Egyptian furnace, to the grand factories of Europe, to the small-scale furnaces that fueled the Studio Glass movement that began in America in 1962. The galleries contain objects representing every country and historical period in which glassmaking has been practiced. The galleries include: Glass in Nature, Origins of Glassmaking, Glass of the Romans, Glass in the Islamic World, Early Northern European Glass, The Rise of Venetian Glassmaking, Glass in 17th-19th Century Europe, 19th Century European Glass, Asian Glass, Glass in America, Corning: From Farm Town to “Crystal City,” Paperweights of the World and Modern Glass.

In addition to these galleries, there is the Jerome and Lucille Strauss Study Gallery, Frederick Carder Gallery and Ben W. Heineman Sr. Gallery of Contemporary Glass. The Study Gallery is filled with a wide range of objects from all periods. The gallery is named after Museum benefactors Jerome and Lucille Strauss, who, by gift and bequest, provided the Museum with an unparalleled collection of 2,400 drinking glasses dating from ancient to modern times. The Frederick Carder Gallery features an extensive collection of glass designed by [[Frederick Carder]] (1863–1963), a gifted English designer who managed Steuben Glass Works from its founding in 1903 until 1932. During this time, the production of Steuben changed from various types of colored glass to colorless glass.

The Museum’s gallery of contemporary glass focuses on vessels, objects, sculptures, and installations made by international artists over the last 25 years. The purpose of the gallery is to show the different ways in which glass is used as a medium for contemporary art. The gallery is named for the Ben W. Heineman Sr. family, who donated a major collection of contemporary glass to the Museum in 2005.

=== Exhibitions ===
The Corning Museum of Glass offers exhibitions year-round. Past exhibitions have included: [http://www.cmog.org/collection/exhibitions/medieval-glass#.UUMv4xycd8E Medieval Glass for Popes, Princes and Peasants], [http://www.cmog.org/collection/exhibitions/east-meets-west-cross-cultural-influences-glassmaking-18th-and-19th-centuries#.UUMwDhycd8E East Meets West: Cross-Cultural Influences in Glassmaking in the 18th and 19th Centuries] and [http://www.cmog.org/collection/exhibitions/mirror-to-discovery#.UUMwQhycd8E Mirror to Discovery: The 200-Inch Disk and the Hale Reflecting Telescope at Palomar].

Section: Arts Beat. &lt;http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/museum-of-glass-to-get-new-wing/&gt;. Access: Nov. 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; the Hot Glass Show is offered all day, every day and is included in the cost of admission. At each demonstration, the glassmaker takes a glob of molten glass and shapes the globs into vases, bowls, or sculptures. Throughout the demonstration, a narrator describes the process, and cameras give viewers a close-up look into the furnaces where the glass is heated. The show gives viewers a look into an ancient Roman technique that is still used today for glass making. Each show lasts between 20–40 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Details glass blowing in Corning, N.Y. November 18, 2001. Washington Post. Accessed on LexisNexis. http://www.lexisnexis.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Hot Glass Roadshow =====
The Museum takes the Hot Glass Show on the road, bringing the unique demonstration to the public, designers, and other museums. The Museum uses unique equipment in order to recreate the state-of-the-art studio environment. The Hot Glass Roadshow travels internationally.&lt;ref&gt;“High Museum of Art Presents the Hot Glass Roadshow.” (2012, Aug. 28). High Museum of Art: Press Release. &lt; http://www.high.org/Press/Press-Releases/2012/August/Hot-Glass-Roadshow.aspx&gt;. Access: Nov. 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== At sea =====
The demonstration is also presented on Celebrity cruise ships, such as Celebrity Solstice, Celebrity Equinox, and Celebrity Eclipse. Each cruise ship has a hotshop on the top deck where the Museum’s glassmakers present their live glassmaking demonstrations. The demos reach more than 300,000 people each year, and the ships visit ports around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Celebrity eclipse launch: these pros are a glass act. Washington Post. April 30, 2010. Travel Trade Gazette UK &amp; Ireland http://business.highbeam.com/409990/article-1G1-225419675/celebrity-eclipse-launch-these-pros-glass-act&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Flameworking Demonstration ====
The demo is a live, 15-minute narrated demonstration of glassworking at a 5,000 degree Fahrenheit gas- and oxygen-powered torch. The show is also included in the cost of admission, and is offered throughout the day in the Museum’s Glass Innovation Center. During the show, the glassmaker melts rods and tubes of glass to shape them into a variety of shapes from animals, beads, ornaments, sculptures and vessels. The [[flameworking]] technique is an ancient glass making technique, which is demonstrated at the Museum.

==== Optical Fiber Demo ====
The Optical Fiber Demo explains how thin threads of glass can carry enormous amounts of digital information and power our high-speed information age. The demo lasts about 15 minutes, is offered every day, and is included in the cost of admission. The demonstration takes place in the museum’s Glass Innovation Center. Demonstrators show how light can be used for communication, how glass can accurately carry light signals, what glass composition will carry light signals most clearly, and how optical fiber provides us with the massive amounts of bandwidth necessary for today’s world. The presentation begins with a discussion of how man has been using light to communicate for centuries. It continues with a demonstration of total internal reflection – the basic principle behind optical fiber. In the mid-1800s, Daniel Colladon, a Swiss scientist, explained how total internal reflection allowed light to be directed along a very specific path with lively visible demonstrations that showed light following the path of a stream of falling water. Total internal reflection traps the light in the stream, and traps it the same way in a glass fiber.

==== Glassbreaking Demo ====
The demonstration is a 15-minute demo that explores how glass breaks and why. Demonstrators show how glass can become stronger or weaker depending on how it is heated or cooled; demonstrators explain how this phenomenon affects the way it breaks. The demonstration takes place in the Windows Gallery of the Museum’s Innovation Center and the demo is included in the cost of admission.

=== The Studio ===

Since 1960, the Scientific Research Department of The Corning Museum of Glass has pioneered the application of numerous scientific techniques to the examination of historical glass artifacts and to the study of the history of glassmaking. Some of this research has focused on the Museum’s collections, but most of it has been conducted in collaboration with archaeologists and scientists from all over the world. The findings of this research have been shared in more than 190 publications on the archaeology, chemistry, and conservation of glass. Many of these publications are now out-of-print or originally appeared in sources that are no longer readily accessible.

The Museum’s searchable database brings this scholarship to the attention of scholars and scientists who might not otherwise be aware of it. Approximately one-quarter of the content is accessible in full-text format. Publications not available in full-text may be accessed through the Museum's [http://www.cmog.org/research/library#.UUM24Rycd8E Rakow Research Library].

[[image:FD1771 FDC Datasheet.jpg|thumb|A floppy disk controller datasheet.]]

A '''datasheet''', '''data sheet''', or '''spec sheet''' is a [[document]] that summarizes the performance and other technical characteristics of a product, machine, component (e.g., an [[electronic component]]), material, a subsystem (e.g., a [[power supply]]) or [[software]] in sufficient detail that allows design engineer to understand the role of the component in the overall system. Typically, a datasheet is created by the manufacturer and begins with an introductory page describing the rest of the document, followed by listings of specific characteristics, with further information on the [[wikt:connectivity|connectivity]] of the devices. In cases where there is relevant [[source code]] to include, it is usually attached near the end of the document or separated into another file.

Depending on the specific purpose, a datasheet may offer an [[average]] value, a typical value, a typical range, [[tolerance (engineering)|engineering tolerances]], or a [[Real versus nominal value|nominal]] value. The type and source of data are usually stated on the datasheet.

A datasheet is usually used for [[technical communication]] to describe technical characteristics of an item or product. It can be published by the manufacturer to help people choose products or to help use the products. By contrast, a technical [[specification]] is an explicit set of requirements to be satisfied by a material, product, or service.

An electronic datasheet specifies characteristics in a formal structure that allows the information to be processed by a machine. Such machine readable descriptions can facilitate information retrieval, display, design, testing, interfacing, verification, and system discovery. Examples include [[transducer electronic data sheet]]s for describing sensor characteristics, and [[CANopen#Electronic Device Description|Electronic device descriptions in CANopen]] or descriptions in markup languages, such as [[SensorML]].

==Typical electronics datasheet information==
{{Overly detailed|section|date=December 2017}}
Examples include:

===Electronic component===
A typical datasheet for an electronic component contains most of the following information:	
* Manufacturer's name
* Product number and name
* List of available package formats (with images) and ordering codes
* Notable device properties
* Short functional description
* Pin connection diagram
* Absolute minimum and maximum ratings (supply voltage, power consumption, input currents, temperatures for storage, operating, soldering, etc.)
* Recommended operating conditions (as absolute minimum and maximum ratings)
* [[Direct current|DC]] specifications (various temperatures, supply voltages, input currents, etc.)
* Maximum power consumption over the whole operating temperature range
* [[Alternating current|AC]] specifications (various temperatures, supply voltages, frequencies, etc.)
* Input/output wave shape diagram
* [[digital timing diagram|timing diagram]]
* Some characteristics are only given at a specific temperature, typically 25&amp;nbsp;°C (77&amp;nbsp;°F)
* Physical details showing minimum/typical/maximum dimensions, contact locations and sizes
* Ordering codes for differing packages and performance criteria
* Liability [[disclaimer]] regarding device use in certain environments such as [[nuclear power plant]]s and [[life support]] systems
* Application recommendations, such as required [[filter capacitor]]s, circuit board layout, etc.
* Errata, often published prior to subsequent correction and relevant datasheet revision

===Personal computer===
* Number of ports
** [[USB]], [[Ethernet]], [[IEEE 1394|FireWire]], [[S/PDIF]], [[PS/2 connector|PS/2]], [[Serial port|Serial]], [[Parallel port|Parallel]]
* Expansion bays
** 5.25&amp;nbsp;inch bays
** 3.5&amp;nbsp;inch bays
* Motherboard
** [[CPU socket]]
*** [[Front-side bus]] (FSB)
*** [[Back-side bus]] (BSB)
** [[Chipset]]
*** [[Northbridge (computing)|North bridge]]
*** [[Southbridge (computing)|South bridge]]
** [[Random-access memory]] (RAM) slots
** [[Peripheral Component Interconnect]] (PCI) and [[PCI Express]] (PCIe) buses and slots
** [[Floppy disk|Floppy]], [[Advanced Technology Attachment|ATA]] ([[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]]) and [[Serial ATA|SATA]] interfaces
** Fans and temperature monitoring
** Integrated [[graphics controller]]s
** Integrated [[Local Area Network|LAN]] interfaces
** Firmware ([[BIOS]])
** Form factor
* Graphics card
** [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]] type
** Memory
* Audio card
* [[Hardware compatibility list|Hardware compatibility]] requirements and basic setup details for computer [[device driver]]s
* [[Operating system]] and other installed [[software]] (if included)

Although a datasheet may include a "typical use" circuit diagram, as well as programming examples in the case of programmable devices, this sort of information is often published in a separate '''application note''', with a high level of detail.

Historically, datasheets were typically available in a '''databook''' that contained many datasheets, usually grouped by manufacturer or general type. Today, they are also available through the Internet in table form or via downloadable (usually [[Portable Document Format|PDF]]) documents.

==Chemical data sheets==

===Material Safety Data Sheets===
A [[Material Safety Data Sheet]] (MSDS), Safety Data Sheet (SDS), or Product Safety Data Sheet (PSDS) is an important component of product stewardship and occupational safety and health. These are required by agencies such as OSHA in its Hazard Communication Standard, 29 C.F.R. 1910.1200. It provides workers with ways to allow them to work in a safe manner and gives them physical data (melting point, boiling point, flash point, etc.), toxicity, health effects, first aid, reactivity, storage, disposal, protective equipment, and spill-handling procedures. The MSDSs differ from country to country, as different countries have different regulations. In some jurisdictions, it is compulsory for the SDS to state the chemical's risks, safety, and effect on the environment.

The SDSs are a commonly used classification for logging information on chemicals, chemical compounds, and chemical mixtures. The SDSs often include the safe use of the chemical and the hazardous nature of the chemical. Anytime chemicals are used these data sheets will be found.

There is a need to have an internationally recognized symbol when describing hazardous substances. Labels can include hazard symbols such as the European Union standard black diagonal cross on an orange background, used to denote a harmful substance.

The purpose of an SDS is not so that the general public will have a knowledge of how to read and understand it, but more so that it can be used in an occupational setting to allow workers to be able to work with it.

===Chemical data===
Data sheets and pages are available for specific properties of chemicals in [[Chemical elements data references]]: example, [[Melting points of the elements (data page)]].  Specific materials have technical data in individual sheets such as [[Ethanol (data page)]]: this includes subjects such as structure and properties, thermodynamic properties, spectral data, vapor pressure, etc. Other chemical data sheets are available from individual producers of chemicals, often on their web pages.

==Data sheets for automobiles==
Data sheets for automobiles may be described under several names such as features, specs, engineering data, technical summary, etc.  They help communicate the technical information about a car to potential buyers and are useful for comparisons with similar cars.  They might include:  critical inside and outside dimensions, weight, fuel efficiency, engine and drive train, towing capability, safety features and options, warranty, etc.

== Similar Documents ==
* '''[[Brochure]]''' focuses more on the benefits and advantages of a products, and states less details, especially less quantitative parameters to describe the product. The beginning parts of a brochure and a datasheet for the same product may look the same and include the name of the product, manufacturer's name, logo and contact details, brief description, photo of scheme of the product.
* '''[[Trade literature#Catalog|Catalog]]''' presents a variety of products and in comparison to datsheets, that presents one product or a relatively small group of similar products. Catalog may present many of the parameters that are stated in the datasheets of the products, but usually catalogs are not as comprehensive as datasheets. 
* '''[[User guide]]''' deals more with the step-by-step usage of a products, and may include a brief or complete list of parameters that describe the product, usually as an appendix for the actual user guide document.
* '''Application notes''' is a document that gives more specific details on using a component in a specific application, or relating to a particular process (e.g., the physical assembly of a product containing the component). Application notes are especially useful for giving guidance on more unusual uses of a particular component, which would be irrelevant to many readers of the more widely read datasheet. application notes may either be appended to a datasheet, or presented as a separate document.
* A '''technical specification''' is an explicit set of requirements to be satisfied by a material, product, or service

'''Domain registration''' is the process of acquiring a [[domain name]] from a domain name [[Domain name registrar|registrar]].

==History==

In 1993, the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]], in conjunction with several public and private entities, created [[InterNIC]] to maintain a central database that contains all the registered domain names and the associated IP addresses in the U.S. (other countries maintain their own NICs (Network Information Centers) -- there's a link below that discusses Canada's system, for example). [[Network Solutions]], a member of InterNIC, was chosen to administer and maintain the growing number of Internet domain names and IP addresses. This central database is copied to Top Level Domain (TLD) servers around the world and creates the primary routing tables used by every computer that connects to the Internet.

Each [[ICANN]]-accredited registrar must pay a fixed fee of US$4,000 plus a variable fee. The sum of variable registrar fees is intended to total US$3.8 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.icann.org/resources/unthemed-pages/adopted-budget-2007-06-29-en ICANN Adopted Budget: Fiscal Year 2007—2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216221230/https://www.icann.org/resources/unthemed-pages/adopted-budget-2007-06-29-en |date=February 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition created by the shared registration system enables end users to choose from many registrars offering a range of related services at varying prices.

==Designated registrar==
Domain registration information is maintained by the domain name registries, which contract with domain registrars to provide registration services to the public. An end user selects a registrar to provide the registration service, and that registrar becomes the ''designated registrar'' for the domain chosen by the user.

Only the designated registrar may modify or delete information about domain names in a central registry database. It is not unusual for an end user to switch registrars, invoking a [[#Domain_name_transfer|domain transfer]] process between the registrars involved, that is governed by specific domain name transfer policies.

When a registrar registers a &lt;tt&gt;com&lt;/tt&gt; domain name for an end-user, it must pay a maximum annual fee of US$7.34 to [[VeriSign]], the registry operator for &lt;tt&gt;com&lt;/tt&gt;, and a US$0.18 annual administration fee to ICANN. Most domain registrars price their services and products to address both the annual fees and the administration fees that must be paid to ICANN. [[Barrier to entry|Barriers to entry]] into the bulk registrar industry are high for new companies without an existing customer base.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Many registrars also offer registration through reseller affiliates. An end-user registers either directly with a registrar, or indirectly through one or more layers of resellers.  As of 2010, the retail cost generally ranges from a low of about $7.50 per year to about $35 per year for a simple domain registration, although registrars often drop the price far lower&amp;nbsp;– sometimes even free&amp;nbsp;– when ordered with other products.

The maximum period of registration for a domain name is  10 years. Some registrars offer longer periods of up to 100 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Protect Your Domain Name Registration Into The Next Century|url=https://www.networksolutions.com/domain-name-registration/popup-100-yr-term.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt; but such offers involve the registrar renewing the registration for their customer; the 100-year registration would not be in the official registration database.

==DNS hosting==
{{main|DNS hosting|Domain name system}}
Registration of a domain name establishes a set of [[Start of Authority]] (SOA) records in the DNS servers of the parent domain, indicating the [[IP address]] (or domain name) of DNS servers that are ''authoritative'' for the domain.  This provides merely a reference for how to find the domain data&amp;nbsp;– not the actual domain data.

Registration of a domain does not automatically imply the provision of DNS services for the registered domain. Most registrars do offer [[DNS hosting]] as an optional free service for domains registered through them.  If DNS services are not offered, or the end-user opts out, the end-user is responsible for procuring or self-hosting DNS services.  Without DNS services for the domain, the registration is essentially useless for Internet services, although this situation is often encountered with [[domain parking]] and [[cybersquatting]].

==Domain name transfer==&lt;!--[[domain transfer]] redirects here--&gt;
A domain name transfer is the process of changing the designated registrar of a domain name. ICANN has defined a ''Policy on Transfer of Registrations between Registrars''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Policy on Transfer of Registrations between Registrars {{!}} Takes effect 1 June 2012|url= http://www.icann.org/en/transfers/policy-en.htm|publisher= [[ICANN]]|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usual process of a domain name transfer is:
# The end user verifies that the [[whois]] admin contact info is correct, particularly the email address; obtains the authentication code ([[Transfer secret|EPP transfer code]]) from the old registrar, and removes any [[domain lock]] that has been placed on the registration.  If the whois information had been out of date and is now updated, the end-user should wait 12–24 hours before proceeding further, to allow time for the updated data to propagate.
# The end user contacts the new registrar with the wish to transfer the domain name to their service, and supplies the authentication code.
# The gaining Registrar must obtain express authorization from either the Registered Name Holder or the Administrative Contact. A transfer may only proceed if confirmation of the transfer is received by the gaining Registrar from one of these contacts. The authorization must be made via a valid Standardized Form of Authorization, which may be sent e.g. by e-mail to the e-mail addresses listed in the WHOIS. The Registered Name Holder or the Administrative Contact must confirm the transfer. The new registrar starts electronically the transfer of the domain with the help of the authentication code (auth code).
# The old registrar will contact the end user to confirm the authenticity of this request.  The end user may have to take further action with the old registrar, such as returning to the online management tools, to re-iterate their desire to proceed, in order to expedite the transfer.
# The old registrar will release authority to the new registrar.
# The new registrar will notify the end user of transfer completion.  The new registrar may have automatically copied over the domain server information, and everything on the website will continue to work as before.  Otherwise, the domain server information will need to be updated with the new registrar.

After this process, the new registrar is the domain name's designated registrar. The process may take about five days.  In some cases, the old registrar may intentionally delay the transfer as long as allowable.  After transfer, the domain cannot be transferred again for 60 days, except back to the previous registrar.

It is unwise to attempt to transfer a domain immediately before it expires. In some cases, a transfer can take up to 14 days, meaning that the transfer may not complete before the registration expires. This could result in loss of the domain name registration and failure of the transfer.  To avoid this, end users should either transfer well before the expiration date, or renew the registration before attempting the transfer.[https://www.dyndns.com/support/kb/domain_expirations.html]

If a domain registration expires, irrespective of the reason, it can be difficult, expensive, or impossible for the original owner to get it back.  After the expiration date, the domain status often passes through several management phases, often for a period of months; usually it does not simply become generally available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.icann.org/en/registrars/gtld-lifecycle.htm|title= ICANN Lifecycle of a gTLD domain.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lists appear to all use at most 16 publicly available generic TLDs (gTLDs) that existed as of December 2009, plus .us. A February 2010 [http://www.icann.org/en/topics/new-gtlds/zfa-concept-paper-18feb10-en.pdf ICANN zone file access concept paper] explains that most country code TLD (ccTLD) registries stopped providing zone files in 2003, citing abuse.

'''The Economic and Social Data Service (ESDS)''' is a national data archiving and dissemination service that was founded in January 2003. It is funded jointly by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC) and [[Jisc]]. In July 2012, the ESRC announced it will become a partner in the UK Data Service, to be established as of October 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ESRC|title=New national digital repository for social and economic data|url=http://www.esrc.ac.uk/news-and-events/press-releases/22231/new-national-digital-repository-for-social-and-economic-data.aspx|accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of work==
ESDS provides access to and support for a wide range of key economic and social data in the UK. The collection covers both quantitative and qualitative data which span many different disciplines and themes.

==Structure==
ESDS service is a distributed service, based on collaboration between four key centres of expertise: [[UK Data Archive]], [[Institute for Social and Economic Research]] (ISER), both based at the [[University of Essex]]; [[Manchester Information and Associated Services]] (Mimas) and [[Cathie Marsh Centre for Census and Survey Research]] (CCSR), both located at the [[University of Manchester]].

These centres work in collaboration to acquire, process, preserve and disseminate a wide range of data across the social sciences. ESDS also provides enhanced user support and training for the secondary use of data for the research, learning and teaching communities.

==Data services==
The [[UK Data Archive]] is responsible for the overall direction and management of the ESDS. Within ESDS, four specialist data services provide value-added support as follows:

* [[ESDS Government]] promotes and facilitates the use of large-scale government surveys, such as the Labour Force Survey and Health Survey for England  in research, learning, and teaching.
* [[ESDS International]] provides access to, and support for, international (typically comparative) datasets from both survey and aggregate sources.
* [[ESDS Longitudinal]] supports a range of the key UK longitudinal data.
* [[ESDS Qualidata]] provides access to, and support for, qualitative datasets, from classic studies from the 1960s and 1970s to contemporary data.

Study descriptions and online documentation, including questionnaires, of datasets can be accessed online free of charge and without registering. Access to data requires registration and uses federated access management (shibboleth) user authentication. Registered users can also download and explore/analyse online a large and growing number of datasets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4570">'''Estries''' are female [[vampires]] of [[Jewish folklore]] that were believed to prey on Hebrew citizens. The name derives from the French ''strix'', a term for a [[night owl (person)|night owl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |page=276 |first=Eliezer |last=Segal |title=Ask now of the days that are past |publisher=University of Calgary Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-55238-131-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some accounts they are considered identical with [[succubi]]: both were portrayed as beautiful, blood-thirsty female demons, with succubi thought to favor babies and young children as prey. Estries, like other vampires, needed to feed on blood to survive and were more indiscriminate in their choice of victims. Succubi were said to kill pregnant women and babies out of jealousy or spite, and to seduce (or in some cases rape) men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyodine.com/succubus/History.htm|title=Succubus History|website=cyodine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estries and succubi were both said to be able to appear as humans or in spirit form at will, but Estries were also described as able to turn into birds or cats and various other animals.

==Sefer Hasidim account==
The [[Sefer Hasidim]], a book on Jewish piety, stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;1465 There are women that are called estrie... They were created at sunset [before the first Sabbath before creation]. As a result of this, they are able to change form. There was one woman who was a estrie and she was very sick and there were two women with her at night; one was sleeping and one was awake. And the sick woman stood up and loosened her hair and she was about to fly and suck the blood of the sleeping woman. And the woman who was awake screamed and woke her friend and they grabbed the sick estrie, and after this she slept. And moreover, if she had been able to grab the other woman, then she, the estrie, would have lived. Since she was not able to hurt the other woman, the estrie died, because she needs to drink the blood of living flesh. The same is true of the werewolf. And since....the estrie need to loosen their hair before they fly, one must adjure her to come with her hair bound so that she cannot go anywhere without permission. And if a estrie is injured or seen by someone, she cannot live unless she eats of the bread and salt of the one who struck her. Then her soul will return to the way it was before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

1466 There was a woman who was suspected of being a estrie, and she was injured when she appeared to a Jew as a cat and he hit her. The next day she asked him to give her some of his bread and salt, and he wanted to give it to her. An old man said to him (Ecc. 7:16) "Be not overly righteous." When others have sinned one must not show kindness, for if she lives, she will harm people. Thus the Holy One, blessed be He created her for you [as a test]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ejmmm2007.blogspot.com/2006/11/vampires-jewish-goth.html|title=Jewish Myth, Magic, and Mysticism|website=ejmmm2007.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://vampiresaz.webs.com/ef.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Estries were believed able to fly if their hair was unbound, while binding an estrie's hair would keep it grounded.

==Defense tactics against estries==
According to the Sefer Hasidim, estries can be injured and, while they prefer the night, it was unclear whether they were cursed to it like other vampires. Estries were considered undeterred by religious iconography, distinguishing them from other mythological demons. Estries were believed to be able to walk into holy places, and sometimes to seek prayer for healing from unsuspecting religious people seeking to do good. But blessing an Estries was considered an evil act in ancient cultures. If injured, an estrie was believed able to heal either from drinking blood or from consuming bread and salt given to them by the one who caused the injury. 

Though methods described for killing estries were conventional, it was believed that burial alone would not prevent an estrie from returning: it must have its mouth packed with earth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shaelsiegel.blogspot.com/2009/06/vampires-einstein-and-jewish-folklore.html|title=Rabbi Shael Speaks...Tachles|author=Shael Siegel|website=shaelsiegel.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or be decapitated or burned. Later mythology attributed to estries the same vulnerabilities as are associated with other vampires: silver bullets, wooden stakes, blessed weapons and holy water.

'''''Gafin NO v Kavin''''', an important case in South African succession law, concerned an application for a declaratory order. AJ Horwitz for the applicant; LI Goldblatt appeared as ''curator ad litem''. The applicant's attorneys were Singer, Horwitz &amp; Robin.

== Facts ==
A husband and wife (Mr and Mrs Kavin) had a joint will, executed on March 8, 1971, and registered and accepted by the Master on July 13, 1977, saying that he and she were the sole heirs. On June 7, 1977, the husband shot and killed his wife, Denise, and two of their children, Adelle and Lance Jay; the third, Debbie-Ann, was shot through the head and blinded for life, but survived. He was intent on killing himself as well: His family, he said, "would re-unite in heaven." He failed, however, in this latter endeavour, and was duly charged with three counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. The trial court found that, because he was mentally ill, he was incapable of acting in accordance with an appreciation of the wrongfulness of his acts at the time of their commission. He therefore lacked criminal capacity, and was not criminally responsible in terms of section 78(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act.&lt;ref&gt;Act 51 of 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; He was found not guilty but was detained in prison pending the decision of the State president.

The respondent and his wife had executed a joint will, under which it was provided that, in the event of the wife's predeceasing the respondent, he was to be the sole and universal heir of the deceased and the wife's estate. The executor in the estate of the deceased applied for an order declaring that the respondent was unworthy to inherit from his late wife and late children.

== Judgment ==
The court held that the applicant's contention that a person who could appreciate the wrongfulness of his act was to be regarded as being unworthy, notwithstanding the fact that he could not act in
accordance with such appreciation, was untenable. The court decided, accordingly, in view of the trial court's finding, that the applicant had not shown that the respondent was disqualified from acquiring any benefits in terms of the deceased's will. Accordingly, he was entitled to inherit.

'''''Garry Halliday''''' is a [[British television]] series for children on the [[BBC]] from 1959 to 1962. The show starred [[Terence Longdon]] as airman Garry Halliday. The episodes were based on books by Justin Blake: Justin Blake was in fact a pseudonym for the writers [[John Griffith Bowen]] and Jeremy Bullmore.

==Plot==
Reminiscent of [[Biggles]], Halliday was a pilot for a commercial airline, Halliday Charter Company, and flew to his adventures in an aircraft with the [[call sign]] Golf Alpha Oboe Roger George. He was assisted by co-pilot Bill Dodds, played by [[Terence Alexander]], who was later Charlie in ''"[[Bergerac (TV series)|Bergerac]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tv.cream.org/a-z/g/index.htm Tv Cream: The Gaffer To Gilligan'S Island&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The airline's control base station was Lima Foxtrot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whirligig-tv.co.uk/tv/adults/other/garryhalliday.htm Garry Halliday&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Their enemy was The Voice, played by [[Elwyn Brook-Jones]], so called because he was never seen by other characters, so that at the end of each series he could escape and reappear in the next. Invisible even to his own gang, The Voice at first shone a powerful light in their faces to disguise his identity; later he used closed-circuit television.

==Production==
Based on the books by Justin Blake, one trailer special and two series were produced. Each episode lasted 25 minutes:
*Garry Halliday - 1 episode
*Garry Halliday and the Gun-Runners - 16 episodes
*Garry Halliday and the Secret of Omar Khayyam - 33 episodes

Series three hit difficulties, as actor [[Bill Kerr]] playing co-pilot Eddie Robbins replaced Terence Alexander; while Brook-Jones died half way through filming, and was replaced (without his scenes being refilmed) by an actor who looked and sounded different. [[Maurice Kaufmann]] played one of The Voice's henchmen in series three.

Filming was at [[London Ashford Airport|Ferryfield Airport]] in [[Lydd]], [[Kent]], with the offices and planes of [[Silver City Airways]] transformed for all three series.

The programme was transmitted in the Saturday afternoon teatime slot subsequently occupied by ''[[Doctor Who]]'', which started on BBC in November 1963. It was a popular slot for a family audience.  In early 1963, it was used for another adventure series for children, ''The Chem. Lab. Mystery''.  After the success of the first series of ''Doctor Who'', with its sci-fi content, there appeared no interest in returning to the more traditional Garry Halliday stories and the show was dropped. Only one episode survives in the BBC archives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostshows.com/default.aspx?programme=d9fabb75-f7ec-4f2a-835a-2e1c42c86d68 "Garry Halliday"], lostshows.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Garry Halliday makes an appearance in ''[[The Black Dossier]]'' by Alan Moore, his name slightly altered to Gary Haliday, encountering Mina Murray and Alan Quatermain in a new spaceport in Birmingham. The Voice is mentioned in passing in a fictional document detailing The League's activities during World War II (When They Sound The Last All Clear).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3684">The '''Gemlich letter''' refers to a letter written by [[Adolf Hitler]] at the behest of [[Karl Mayr]] to Adolf Gemlich, a German army soldier. The letter, written in 1919 in response to a request for clarification on the [[Jewish question]], is thought to be the first known piece of [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] writing by Hitler.&lt;ref name="Ewing2011-06-03" /&gt; The first political piece by Hitler, it is thought to have established his credentials as a radical rightist and, amongst conservative groups, as the man who could overthrow the [[Weimar Republic]].&lt;ref name="JVL" /&gt; Because the letter is the first record of Hitler's antisemitic views, and because it brought Hitler into politics, it is considered an important document in [[Holocaust]] studies.

In the letter, Hitler argues that antisemitism should be based on facts, Jews were a race and not a religious group, and that the aim for the government "must unshakably be the removal of the Jews altogether".&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw, ''Hitler: 1889-1936 Hubris'', pp.125-126&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Hitler, who had been wounded during the First World War, returned to Munich in September 1919 to an army Intelligence and propaganda unit of the [[Reichswehr]] which was run by Captain Karl Mayr who assigned him to write a response to Adolf Gemlich's question on the army's position on the Jewish Question. Hitler's response, dated 16 September 1919, was either written by him or dictated by him and subsequently typed by another.&lt;ref name="Ewing2011-06-03" /&gt; Two copies of the letter are thought to exist. One in the Bavarian state archives in Munich which is typewritten but unsigned, and the second at the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]], also typewritten but signed by Hitler.&lt;ref name="Usborne2011-03-17" /&gt; The second version, now believed to be the original, was discovered in a Nuremberg archive by a GI, Arthur Ziegler, who brought it to the [[United States]] where it ended up in a private collection. In 1990, [[Charles Hamilton (handwriting expert)|Charles Hamilton]], the handwriting expert, authenticated the signature on the letter and, in 2011 it was purchased by the Simon Wiesenthal Center.&lt;ref name="Rawlings2011-06-08" /&gt;

'''George Armour''' (April 24, 1812 - June 13, 1881) was a Scottish American businessman and philanthropist who transformed the global distribution process for commodities. He is credited with developing the [[grain elevator]] system, establishing grain trading standards as director and president of the [[Chicago Board of Trade]] (CBT), founding the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] (CBQ), [[Commercial Club of Chicago]] , YMCA of Chicago, Merchants' Loan &amp; Trust Company (MLTC), the precursor to [[Continental Illinois]],  and the [[Chicago Academy of Fine Arts]] which later became the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] and [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. He served as a director of several notable companies during his career.

As founder of Armour, Dole &amp; Co and other firms, he created the first extensive system of large mechanized [[grain elevator]]s in Chicago and thus enabled the shipment of grains from the American Midwest to destinations all over the world. During his tenure, the CBT standardized the grading and selling of grains and established the first commodity futures markets. He was "popularly known as the father of the grain elevator system"{{ sfn | Harper | Ravell |1907 | p = 68 }} or as a "rapacious, blood sucking insect."{{ sfn | Ely, Burnham &amp; Bartlett | 1870 | p = 1629 }}

== Early life ==
[[File:Map-locating-first-cabins-argyle-illinois.png|left|thumb|Map locating first cabins Argyle, IL - includes location of cabin belonging to John and George Armour - ''circa'' 1830s {{sfn | Harvey | 1924 }}]]

George Armour was born on April 24, 1812 in [[Campbeltown]],[[Scotland]], on the [[Mull of Kintyre]].{{sfn|EncyclopediaChicago - Biographical Dictionary|2017 }}
Armour was a [[wheelwright]] and worked his way across the ocean as a shipboard [[Cooper (profession)|cooper]] or carpenter.{{ sfn | Harvey |1924 | p = 14 }}

In 1834, Armour with his brother John and cousin James a shoemaker, left Campbeltown and made a voyage to [[Ottawa, Illinois]].
Soon after their arrival in Ottawa, the brothers went north to what was then known as the "[[Argyle, Illinois|Argyle Settlement]]" near [[Rockford, Illinois]].
The brothers built a 14' x 14' cabin in hopes of establishing a timber and prairie land claim, but "farming was not to their liking."{{ sfn | Harvey |1924 | pp = 12-13 }}

In 1836, while on a trip to back to Scotland, the brothers helped their friend John Greenlee and his family escape from Campbeltown in order to avoid Greenlee being arrested by one of the [[Duke of Argyll]]'s tax collectors.
After the escape, the brothers furnished the Greenlees with passage to the US and set up the Greenlees in the cabin they had built in the Argyle Settlement.{{ sfn | Harvey |1924 | pp = 15 }} Subsequently, Armour lived in [[Joliet, Illinois|Joliet]] and [[Lockport, Illinois]] and entered the business of merchandising.{{ sfn| Chicago Tribune | 1881 }}
At the time, both cities were expanding rapidly because of the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal.{{ sfn | EncyclopediaChicago - Joliet |2017}} 
Lockport became headquarters for building the canal in 1837.{{ sfn | EncyclopediaChicago - Lockport |2017}}

[[File:Seneca IL Armour's Warehouse1.jpg|thumb| [[Armour's Warehouse]], Seneca, IL ]]
Later Armour became a sub-contractor with George Steel.{{ sfn| Chicago Tribune | 1881 }} Steel was born in [[Forfarshire]], Scotland in 1797 and arrived in Chicago in 1837.{{ sfn | MarketsWiki - George Steel | 2017 }} Steel had come to the US on contract for building a section of the Illinois &amp; Michigan Canal but the work had stopped in the aftermath of the [[Panic of 1837]]. 
Steel and Armour built a section of the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]] sometime between 1836 and 1848.{{sfn | Andreas Vol1| 1884 | p = 587 }}{{ sfn | Kirkland | 1919 | p = 57 }}
They also built a portion of the CBQ. The railroad was constructed starting in March 1848 and was completed in 1853.{{ sfn| Chicago Tribune | 1881 }}
Armour was a contractor for 16 miles (out of 181 miles) of road grading for the ROCK which started construction in 1851 and was completed by 1854.{{ sfn | Illinois ancestors | 2017 }} Armour most likely also worked on the [[Galena and Chicago Union Railroad]] - the first railroad built west of Chicago and a highly profitable venture that established [[William B. Ogden]] and [[George Smith (financier)|George Smith]] as major figures in Chicago history.{{ sfn | chapman| 1889 | p = 1041 }} Smith operated a "[[wildcat bank]]" that issued scrip which was used to pay workers - including Armour's employees.{{ sfn | Andreas | 1885 | p = 617}}

In the early 1850s, Armour resettled in Chicago.{{ sfn| Chicago Tribune | 1881 }} His brother John Armour remained in Ottawa where he became a successful businessman. Of John Armour's many investments, one that remains is [[Armour's Warehouse]]  built in 1861.{{ efn | Also known as the Seneca Grain Elevator or the Hogan's North Elevator, the structure is a historic grain elevator located in the village of [[Seneca, Illinois]], United States. The elevator and two surrounding outbuildings were listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1997.}}{{ sfn | Library of Congress - Armour's Warehouse | 2017 }} In contrast, George Armour - in the following thirty years - went from being a foreman to being one of the richest and most influential businessmen in America.{{ efn | How Armour achieved his rags to riches life is hard to know. He appears to have arrived in America with a tradesman's education, limited access to capital and few social connections of any significance. It appears that Armour just happened to be the right person in the right place at the right time on a good number of occasions. }}

== Prospering in Chicago ==
[[File:ICHi-017111 - Chicago River.jpg|thumb|left|Munger &amp; Armour grain elevator, Chicago, IL, 1868?]]
In Chicago, Armour reunited with George Steel - who had become a prosperous Chicago businessman. In 1852-1853 Steel was president of Chicago Board of Trade. In 1856, a new three-story building was erected on Steel's site: an office and warehouse located at the foot of LaSalle Street on South Street and this became the first permanent home for the CBT.{{ sfn | MarketsWiki - George Steel | 2014 }}{{ sfn | isas| 2014 }} Armour was an early member of the CBT and also commenced what became his signature venture - the erection and management of grain elevators.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Prior to Armour's efforts there had been a small number of what may be termed "grain elevators" constructed in the United States. [[Dart's Elevator]] was the world's first steam-powered grain elevator. It was designed and built by [[Joseph Dart]] and [[Robert Dunbar]] in 1842 in Buffalo, New York.
The first large steam elevator ever built in Chicago for handling grain from railroad tracks was on the North side, on the [[Chicago River]], west of Wells Street. It was built by George A Gibbs and E W Griffin of Gibbs, Griffin &amp; Company in 1854.{{ sfn | Wright | 1868 | p=57}}{{ sfn | Kirkland | 1919 | p = 57 }} It might also have been known as the Chicago &amp; Galena Union Railroad Elevator. {{ sfn | Andreas | 1885 | p = 374 }}

In 1854 George Steel took over a warehouse and built another grain elevator just west of the Gibbs, Griffin and Company warehouse. It was capable of operating from the canal as well as the railroads. The elevator had a capacity of 100,000 bushels and was located at Franklin and River streets - in the Chicago &amp; Galena Union Railroad track on North Water Street.{{ sfn  | MarketsWiki - George Steel | 2014 }}

In that year Steel's warehouse burnt down{{ sfn | Andreas Vol1| 1884 | p = 587 }} and Steel sold the property to Wesley Munger and George Armour. Munger had owned a small mill at Waukegan, which had burned down.{{ sfn | Kirkland | 1919 | p = 57 }} As Munger &amp; Armour,{{ sfn |  EncyclopediaChicago - Munger, Wheeler &amp; Co | 2017 }} they built the first modern, steam-driven grain elevator in Chicago.{{ sfn | Chicago Tribune | 1868 }}{{ sfn | Chicago Tribune | 1881 }}{{ sfn | EncyclopediaChicago - Munger, Wheeler &amp; Co | 2017 }} The grain elevator was completed in 1855 and had a capacity of 300,000 bushels.{{ sfn | taylor | 1917 | p = 201 }}

Armour's influence as a Chicago businessman grew and Armour was first elected a director of the CBT in 1856.{{ sfn | taylor| 1917 | p = 216 }}

In 1860 he joined with Charles Sydney Dole,{{ sfn | MacGrath | Reed | 1892 | p = 227 }} James Henry Doyle{{ sfn | MacGrath | Reed | 1902 | pp = 152-154 }} and Wesley Munger{{ sfn | EncyclopediaChicago - Armour Dole &amp; Co  | 2017 }} and they formed Armour, Dole &amp; Co.{{ sfn | Andreas | 1885 | p = 375 }} The company operated grain elevators at the depot of the CBQ with a capacity of 850,000 bushels. After the [[American Civil War]], Armour, Dole &amp; Co. remained among the city's leading grain warehousers. Their elevators had a combined capacity of 2.1 million bushels in 1871. By the early 1880s, this figure had grown to 6.3 million bushels.{{ sfn | EncyclopediaChicago - Armour Dole &amp; Co | 2017 }}

In 1863, Hiram Wheeler {{ sfn | MarketsWiki - Hiram Wheeler | 2013 }}{{ sfn | Andreas Vol1 | 1884 | p 587 }} entered the Munger &amp; Armour, which then became Munger, Wheeler &amp; Co.{{ sfn | Andreas | 1885 | p = 374 }} Armour remained a partner. The company owned large grain elevators next to the depot of the Chicago &amp; North Western Railroad.{{ sfn | EncyclopediaChicago - Munger, Wheeler &amp; Co | 2017 }}

At the Chicago Canal Convention of 1863,{{ sfn | nytimes | 1863 }} Armour was a member of the CBT delegation.{{ sfn | Andreas | 1885 | p = 349 }}{{ sfn | taylor | 1917 | p304}} 
The Convention proceedings called for laws and budgets to widen and deepen the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]] and thus make it possible for ships to sail between the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Mississippi River]].{{ sfn | Currey | 1912 | pp = 170-178 }}

=== Enablers of success ===
In order to succeed with a vision of moving of very numerous bushels of grain, Armour needed more than steam powered conveyor belts.{{ sfn | Cronon | 1991 | p = 120 }} He needed:

* Products that could be graded for quality according to industry-standards
* Banks that did not fail and supported stable currencies
* Futures exchange where contracts to buy specific quantities of a commodity or financial instrument at a specified price with delivery set at a specified time in the future

==== Industry-standard grading systems for grains ====
Through the 1830s sacks or barrels or even buckets of grain were hoisted off vessels and into warehouses by manpower - sometimes even using [[bucket brigade]]s.{{ sfn | Andreas Vol1 | 1884 | p = 579 }}{{ sfn | Pollan | 2006 | p = 59 }} The amounts of grain being moved in a contract were measured in the thousands of bushels. By the 1840s a certain amount of bulk transport was taking place and grain was stored in individual bins according to source in warehouses and the heavy lifting was done by [[block and tackle]] pulled by horses. By 1848 the horse was replaced by a steam engine, but not the block and tackle. The amounts being moved were in the tens of thousands of bushels.{{ sfn | taylor | 1917 | p = 144 }} If the transport of grain was to move into the hundreds of thousands of bushels then changes were needed.{{ sfn | EncyclopediaChicago - Agriculture | 2017 }}

When grains from multiple sources were to be co-mingled in silos holding hundred of thousands of bushels, then methods of grading and inspecting the quality of the grain are required.{{ sfn | Pollan | 2006 | p = 60 }}{{ sfn | Magrath | 1964 }} The CBT had been concerned with grading and inspecting products since the day it was founded.{{ sfn | taylor | 1917 | p = 138 }} In 1856 Armour was elected to the Board of Directors of the CBT.{{ sfn | taylor | 1917 | p = 216 }} In the same year, his partner Charles Dole was charged to set up a committee with the purpose of establishing grades by the separation of wheat into three industry-standard grades.{{ sfn | MacGrath | Reed | 1892 | p = 228}} By 1858 the grading and inspecting standards were established and compliance mechanisms set up.{{ sfn | MacGrath | Reed | 1892 | p = 227 }}{{ sfn | Wright | 1868 | p = 161 }} In 1859, the CBT received a state charter that enabled it to enforce grading standards and inspections with a legally binding basis. {{ sfn | santos | 2008 }}

==== Banks that do not fail ====
In banking, the period 1837 to 1863 is known as the "[[Free Banking]]" era. It was a period of "[[Wildcat Banks]]".{{ sfn | MLTC| 1901 | pp = 76-90 }} In the [[Panic of 1837]], out of 850 banks in the United States, 343 closed entirely, 62 failed partially.{{ sfn | Morris | 1914 | p = 136 }} If Armour's business was to prosper, he needed a bank that would not fail. In 1857, along with [[Cyrus McCormick]], who invented the [[reaper]], and Chicago's first mayor, [[William B. Ogden]], Armour was a founder and, later, elected director of the Merchants' Loan and Trust Company.{{ sfn | Chicago Tribune | 1994 }}{{ sfn | Andreas | 1885 | pp = 626-627 }} The book published by MLTC in 1907 titled ''Fifty Years of Banking in Chicago'' identified the banks' early mission:

{{ quote 
| text = The creation of the Merchants' Loan and Trust Company was the protest of Chicago's soundest businessmen and financiers against the continuance of irresponsible and unscientific banking.{{ sfn | Harper | Ravell | 1907 | p = 32 }}
}}

==== Fixed pricing by using futures contracts ====
In 1865 the CBT recognized the [[futures contract]] as a legitimate feature of trades and full rules were first established.{{ sfn | Andreas | 1885 | p = 357 }}{{ sfn | taylor | 1917 | p = 332 }} Given the increase in pricing certainty around the globe, Chicago grain elevator operators became free to construct grain elevators with capacities of millions of bushels.{{ sfn | Cronan | 1991 | p = 124 }}{{ sfn | santos | 2008 }}

==== And more ====
While the above three conditions may have been paramount in developing the grain warehousing business, there were a number of other hurdles to be cleared. The technology for moving grain had to improve and he development or trains, vessels and conveyors continued its rapid progress in typical nineteenth century fashion. Perhaps the most significant less obvious aspect was that the site and logistics planning for the warehouses needed to be just right: warehouses needed to have navigable water on one side and railroads on the other side.{{ sfn | Andreas | 1885 | p = 373 }} The navigable waters needed to give vessels access to any other port in the world. The railroads needed to reach tens of thousands of farms to the west as well to the major consumer cities on the East coast.

Armour fully recognized the site and logistics planning needs. He was a supporter of the railroads and was a stockholder in the CBQ, the Chicago &amp; Northwestern, and the Chicago Milwaukee and St Paul Railroads.{{ sfn | Chicago Tribune | 1881 }} Later he was a director of the ROCK.{{ sfn | Railroad and Warehouse Commission | 1880 | p = 196 }} He was probably one of the few shareholders that had actually laid track. On the canal side, at the Chicago Canal Convention of 1863,{{ sfn | nytimes | 1863 }} Armour was a member of the CBT delegation{{ sfn | Andreas | 1885 | p = 349 }} - most likely one of the few members that had actually dug a canal.

Because of the likelihood of [[dust explosion]]s, grain warehouses were frequent venues for fires. Armour also foresaw the need for fully funded insurance. He was a local director of the [[Liverpool, London and Globe Building|Liverpool &amp; London &amp; Globe Insurance Company]], a director of the Chicago Mutual Insurance Company{{ sfn | Andreas | 1885 | pp = 641}} and a director of the Merchants Insurance Company.{{ sfn | Chicago Tribune | 1881 }}

By 1870 the remaining impediments to growth were less about the technology and more about legal and political matters. In 1870 the ''Chicago Tribune'' reported:

{{ quote
| text = The name of a Chicago warehouseman has become a synonym with that of a pirate .... It may be safely affirmed that no man voluntarily sends his grain to Chicago who can send it elsewhere. {{ sfn | Chicago Tribune| 1870 }}
}}

== The Chicago Fire and after ==
[[File:Chicago_in_Flames_by_Currier_%26_Ives,_1871.jpg|thumb|left|Chicago in Flames by Currier &amp; Ives, 1871]]
The [[Great Chicago Fire]] "was a conflagration that burned from Sunday, October 8, to early Tuesday, October 10, 1871. The fire killed up to 300 people, destroyed roughly 3.3 square miles (9 km2) of Chicago, Illinois, and left more than 100,000 residents homeless." Armour and his partners apparently came through physically unscathed but their various business affairs were totally disrupted. The offices of Armour, Dole and Co, Munger &amp; Wheeler were destroyed as well as Armour, Dole &amp; Co Elevator "A", the MLTC offices, the Merchants Insurance Company offices - which were exploded to make a fire break that failed - and the CBT offices.

The story of how the MLTC was able to move the bank's funds at the height of the fire is well-described in ''The Advancement of Chicago as a Financial Center up to the Close of the Nineteenth Century''.{{ sfn | MLTC| 1901 | pp = 92-100}} Also described was the setting up of an improvised bank in Solomon A Smith's dining room on Monday, October 9 and recreating all the accounts even with all the banks and most of the customer's records had been destroyed.

The Munn &amp; Scott affair occurred, starting in 1872. See below.

In 1875, Armour was elected president of the CBT.{{ efn | It seems likely Armour's election was in response or somehow related to Armour's benevolence in the Munn &amp; Scott affair.}}{{ sfn | CBT | 1876 }}{{ sfn | Andreas | 1886 | p = 320 }} During his tenure, on January 14, the King of Hawaii visited the CBT trading floor and a racist incident occurred. It was covered in detail by the ''Chicago Tribune''.{{ sfn | Chicago Tribune | 187T5 }} Also during the year, for the first time, memberships could be bought and sold{{ sfn | Cronan | 1991 | p = 137 }} and a committee was instituted to report of the recommendation of situating a US mint in Chicago. The report was an added as an appendix to the CBT annual report.{{ sfn | CBT | 1876 }}

There were few further impediments to growth. By 1885, the capacity of the Armour, Dole &amp; Co grain elevators was 6,350,000 bushels with a total shipping and receiving capacity of 1,500,000 per day. {{ sfn | MacGrath | Reed | 1892 | p = 229 }}

== Munn &amp; Scott affair ==
[[File:1866-chicago-munn-scott-grain-elevators.jpg|thumb|left| Munn &amp; Sccott Grain-Elevators, Chicago 1866]]
The Munn &amp; Scott grain-warehousing company was founded in 1844 in Spring Bay, Illinois, north of Peoria. By 1856, Ira Y. Munn and his partners owned a large Chicago grain elevator with a capacity of 200,000 bushels. George L. Scott joined the enterprise in 1858, and the name was changed name to Munn &amp; Scott. By the end of the Civil War, the company owned four Chicago grain elevators with a total capacity of 2.3 million bushels, nearly a third of the total capacity of all of the city's large elevators.{{ sfn | EncyclopediaChicago - Munn &amp; Scott | 2017 }}{{ sfn | Andreas | 1885 | p = 375 }}{{ sfn | Magrath | 1964 }}

Munn served as president of the Chicago Board of Trade and as president of the city's Chamber of Commerce in 1868. Annual revenues reached about $4 million in 1867; by 1870, the company ranked as the city's leading grain warehouse.{{ sfn | Magrath | 1964 }}

By 1868 Munn &amp; Scott and four other firms - including Armour, Dole and Co - dominated the Chicago grain elevator landscape. They were interlocked in a business pool, each owning part interest in each of the others.
Therefore, they could fix prices and carry out dirty tricks that included fraudulent grading, dishonest weighing, mixing grades, restricting competition, hiding storage information, and issuing false receipts.{{ sfn | Cronan | 1991 | p = 137 }}
Joseph Medill, whose newspaper made warehouse regulation its cause, put it colorfully:

{{ quote 
| text = The fifty million bushels of grain that pass into and out of the city of Chicago ''per annum'', are controlled absolutely by a few warehouse men and the officers of railways. They form the grand ring, that wrings the sweat and blood out of the producers of Illinois. There is no provision in the fundamental law standing between the unrestricted avarice of monopoly and the common rights of the people; but the great, laborious, patient ox, the farmer, is bitten and bled, harassed and tortured, by these rapacious, blood sucking insects.{{ sfn | Ely, Burnham &amp; Bartlett | 1870 | p = 1629 }} 
}}

The Munn &amp; Scott firm was both a prime cause of complaints and a leader in the fight against effective control by the CBT.{{ sfn | Magrath | 1964 }}&lt;br&gt;
In the summer of 1872, the firm was exposed as having massively cheated clients using multiple methods. It was learned that Munn &amp; Scott grain receipts totaling 300,000 bushels were not backed by grain.{{ sfn | Andreas | 1885 | p 367-368}}{{ sfn | MarketsWiki - Ira Y Munn  | 2013 }}&lt;br&gt;
Had the Munn &amp; Scott matter had been allowed to take its course, it would have created a panic which would have extended throughout the whole Northwest. Armour, a silent partner in the firm, could probably have entirely escaped, or evaded, any personal responsibility in the matter.{{ sfn | Chicago Tribune | 1881 }} Instead, Armour purchased the Munn interests for $10{{ sfn | Chicago Tribune | 1873 }} and quietly set about purchasing grain to make its receipts good.{{ sfn | taylor | 1917 | pp = 457-460 }}

When a reporter from ''The Tribune'' interviewed him on the subject, Armour declined to say anything in reference to it, but requested as a special favor that no noise be made about it in the paper. He had merely done his duty, he said, and it might interfere with the country's business if it were written up in the newspapers.{{ sfn | Chicago Tribune | 1881 }}
&lt;!--
Adding insult to injury, the firm along with three other speculators then attempted to [[Cornering_the_market| corner the market]] for wheat in Chicago but failed in doing so and went into bankruptcy.
--&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
By this time, the Munn &amp; Scott firm had gone bankrupt in a grain speculation deal, and Ira Munn and George Scott both found that they were now strictly employees of Armour himself.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In the same year, Munn &amp; Scott was charged with violating new Illinois regulations that enabled the state to inspect and regulate the elevators. Munn and his company achieved their most lasting fame in 1876–77, when the US Supreme Court in ''[[Munn v. Illinois]]'' rejected Munn's argument that the state had no right to regulate privately owned enterprises such as grain elevators.{{ sfn | Andreas | 1886 | p = 331 }}{{ sfn | EncyclopediaChicago - Munn &amp; Scott | 2017 }}

Following the demise of Munn &amp; Scott and the enactment of new laws and the addition to CBT regulations, the dislike of the "warehousemen" seemed to diminish. There continued to be fraudulent behaviors and attempts were made to corner markets but these appear to have been more the actions of rogue individuals and not due to underlying structural flaws in the warehousing system.

== Personal, political and philanthropic life ==
Armour married Barbara Allison (1826–1898) in the early 1850s. She was born in [[Aberdeen]], Scotland and emigrated to Chicago when she was very young. Their first son John was born in 1851. The first Armour home was on [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] near Monroe Street.{{sfn|Chicago Tribune|1898}}

The Great Chicago Fire disrupted Armour's personal life. He lost his house, his church, his children's school. He also lost civic projects he had dedicated much time to, including the YMCA, the Seaman's Bethel and Chicago Academy of Design.

After the Chicago Fire, the family built and moved into a new house at 1945 South [[Prairie Avenue]] in 1872.{{ sfn | Tyre| 2008 | p = 27}} They also had a summer house in [[Waukegan]], IL.{{ sfn |Chicago Tribune | 1898}}

While on a voyage to Europe – made with the hope of improving his health – Armour died of rheumatism of the heart in [[Brighton]], [[England]] on June 13, 1881.{{sfn|EncyclopediaChicago - Biographical Dictionary|2017}}{{sfn|USGenWeb|2006}} His body was returned to the US and he was buried at [[Graceland Cemetery]] in Chicago.{{ sfn | findagrave| 2013 }}

By the 1850s, the population of Chicago grew to over 110,000 inhabitants. As with many groups of people this size, the population included artisans, artists and art patrons.

Examples of a love of the arts in Chicago at the time include:
* In 1855 William B Ogden invited [[George Peter Alexander Healy]] to visit Chicago. Healy was an American portrait painter and one of the most prolific and popular painters of his day. He lived and painted in Chicago for the next fourteen years
* The first major art exhibition was held in 1859 and attracted over 12,000 visitors.{{ sfn | Andreas | 1885 | p = 514 }}{{ sfn | ihap - First Chicago Art Exhibition | 2017 }}
* The construction of [[Crosby's Opera House]] and its eventual success{{ sfn | Andreas | 1885 | pp = 601-607}}

The Armours become associated with this artistic milieu by becoming collectors and patrons. Their son John Armour died on May 16, 1865 of a rheumatic heart condition. Some time before that, John's portrait was painted by Healy. Prior to his death, the Armours traveled to Europe hoping to cure John. While in Europe a bas-relief bust of John was sculpted. Also on that voyage a portrait of Barbara Allison Armour was painted by Sir [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] in London in 1865.

Also of note, Armour's partner James H Dole had been very active with the Chicago Academy of Design, was a founder of the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts and supported the Art Institute until his death in 1902.{{ sfn | MacGrath | Reed | 1902 | p = 152 }}

The culmination of this participation is that Armour was a founder and elected first President of the [[Chicago Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1879.{{ sfn | aic | 1927 | p = 6 }}{{ sfn | Chicago Tribune| 1880 }}{{ sfn | Andreas | 1886 | p = 421 }}{{ sfn | Currey - Volume 2 | 1912 | p = 264 }} The Academy changed its name to the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1882.

The background in the creation of the Art Institute is complex. The formation of the Institute and its origins in the Chicago Academy of Design are detailed by A T Andreas in his ''History of Chicago - From the Earliest Period to the Present Time''.{{ sfn | Andreas | 1886 | pp = 419-422 }} A darker side of the takeover of assets is covered by Joel S. Dryer in a presentation titled ''The Story You Don't Know About A Place We All Love'' delivered to The Chicago Literary Club May 14, 2001.{{ sfn| ihap - Art Institute of Chicago | 2017 }} Further investigations has been carried out by Kirsten M. Jensen in her book: ''The American Salon: The Art Gallery at the Chicago Interstate Industrial Exposition, 1873--1890''.{{sfn | Jensen| 2007 }}

=== Church obligations ===
Armour was active with the [[Second Presbyterian Church (Chicago)|Second Presbyterian Church]] and along with his good friend Norman Williams - a prominent Chicago lawyer.{{ sfn | Second Presbyterian Church | 1892 | pp = 46-47 }} 
He was a Trustee and an Elder of the church. The first church was destroyed in the Chicago Fire of 1871. A new church was completed by 1874. Armour donated the tower which was completed in 1884 after Armour's death.{{ sfn | Tyre| 2008 | p = 68 }}

Armour donated $500 toward the construction of the Willow Creek Presbyterian Church in Argyle, IL in 1877.{{ sfn | Harvey | 1924 | p = 14 }}

=== Civic duties ===
On March 22, 1858, Chicagoans again gathered in an attempt to form a [[YMCA]]. After a series of meetings, a constitution was written and the first YMCA of Chicago was officially formed.{{ sfn | Andreas | 1885 | p = 511 }} Armour was a founder and trustee of the YMCA of Chicago.{{ sfn| Stockwell | 1992 | pp = 421-422 }}

Armour was a founder and member of the [[Commercial Club of Chicago]] in 1878. A group of successful Chicago businessmen, the Commercial Club promoted the economic development of the city. The Commercial Club patterned itself after traditional civic improvement clubs, holding regular meetings to discuss pertinent reform issues of the day.{{sfn|Commercial Club|1904| p = 21}}{{sfn|EncyclopediaChicago - Commercial Club of Chicago|2017}}

Armour dedicated a [[:File:George Armour Sculpture - geograph.org.uk - 615575.jpg| Fountain in Campbeltown, Scotland]] - his birthplace - in 1881. See below.

=== Politics ===
Armour was attacked in during the elections of 1857.{{ sfn | Chicago Tribune | 1881 | p = 159 }} Widespread "rioting and knockdowns" were reported in the predominantly Irish-Democratic 7th Ward in the final days of the March 2, 1857 mayoral election.{{sfn| ispn | 1995 }} The ''Illinois Police &amp; Sheriff's News'' described the event as follows:

{{ quote
| text = A Republican businessman named George Armour challenged the votes of some Irishmen who did not reside within ward boundaries. Armour was set upon by a crowd of poll-watching ruffians, kicked, beaten about the head, and dragged through the streets by the hair until his friends came to the rescue. Another Wentworth worker was not nearly so lucky. He was attacked, stabbed, and chased clear down to La Salle Street where he jumped onto a dangerously thin sheet of river ice to escape his pursuers. The man escaped but not before one of the 7th Ward Irishers crashed through the ice and drowned in the bone-chilling waters of the Chicago River.{{sfn| ispn | 1995 }}
}}
The only political position Armour ever held was that of elector in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] for the Hayes ticket in 1876. Special attention was called to him at the time, from the fact that his right to hold the place was challenged. It was alleged that he'd never been naturalized and consequently was ineligible. If true this would have lost Illinois one of her votes and tied the result in the Electoral College. After some difficulty, however, Armour was able to find a record of his naturalization, and he cast his vote along with his colleagues, for Hayes and Wheeler.{{ sfn | Chicago Tribune | 1881 }}

=== Commercial and cultural ===
George Armour was a pioneer in many ways. Many of the tasks he and close colleagues initiated and became involved with continue to exist and have repercussions to this day.

==== Usurpation of good deeds by the meatpackers ====
Very frequently George Armour has been taken to be a brother or relative of [[Philip Danforth Armour]].

Examples of web sites and books that erroneously indicate that George Armour was closely related to Philip Danforth Armour include the following:

==== Industry-standard grading and inspection ====
For better or worse we have [[high-fructose corn syrup]] as a legacy to Armour's and the CBT's efforts for setting up grading standards for grains.
Michael Pollan,  American author, journalist, activist, and professor of journalism at the UC Berkeley wrote in his best-seller ''[[The Omnivore's Dilemma]]'':

{{ quote | Commodity corn, which is as much an economic abstraction as it is a biological fact, was invented in Chicago in the 1850s.&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;
The breakthrough came in 1856, When the Chicago Board of Trade instituted a grading system. Now any number 2 corn was guaranteed to be as good as any other number 2 corn.&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;
No one could foresee it at the time, but the Chicago Board of Trade's decision redirected the evolution of ''Zea mays''.{{ sfn | Pollan | 2006 | p = 60 }}
}}

''Zea mays'' is the predominant type of corn used to created high-fructose corn syrup.

==== Futures ====
The CBT authorized the [[futures contract]] for wheat in 1865 - a world first.{{ sfn | Andreas | 1885 | p = 357 }} Today, futures are bought and sold for many commodities in exchanges around the world.{{ sfn | santos | 2008 }} And the CBT is a component of the largest traders of futures contracts:

{{ Quote | The statistic presents the world's leading derivative exchanges in 2015, by number of contracts traded and/or cleared. CME Group, incorporating Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Chicago Board of Trade and New York Mercantile Exchange, proved to be the largest derivatives exchange operator in 2015, with approximately 3.53 billion of contracts traded.{{ sfn | Statista | 2015 }} }}

==== A seat on the board ====
In 1876, while Armour was president of the CBT, membership in the CBT went from being "by invitation only" to being memberships or a "sear" that could be bought and sold.{{ sfn | taylor | 1917 | p 527 }}

The practice of buying and selling seats is now followed all many exchanges and the price of a seat on the CBT has increased.

==== Banks too big to fail ====
Not all of Armour's efforts ended up with the legacies that he might have wanted. Armour's and his partners' goals in founding MLTC was to set up under the charter of being a very safe and secure banking operation. Under this charter the bank grew for decades, eventually the bank grew to be the biggest bank in Chicago and among the biggest in the US - [[Continental Illinois]]. Unfortunately in the late eighties the bank started growing so big and too fast that it failed. The Federal Reserve saved Continental Illinois - because it was "[[too big to fail]]".

==== Trading pit racism ====
When the King of Hawaii visited the CBT trading floor on January 14, 1875, the traders in the pits began to sing a song titled "The King of Cannibal Island". Armour repeatedly banged his gavel and shouted "Shame!" to little avail. To this day brokers and trading bits remain as venues where racism and discrimination continue to exist - regardless of management attempts to stop this behavior.

==== Effective movement of bulk materials ====
Having taken part building some of the first railroads and canals in the US, Armour understood the need for systems that would enable the movement of bulk materials around the world. He always built his warehouses at the junctions between the two modes of transport.{{ sfn | Andreas | 1885 | p = 373 }} Today grain elevators are still built between navigable waters and railroad lines. And, even more impressive, the [[container terminal]]s of the world - "where cargo containers are transshipped between different transport vehicles, for onward transportation" - all follow the same planning that George Armour used.

==== Military-industrial complex ====
Just at the beginning of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], a meeting was called by CBT with the express purpose of funding the establishment of a brigade to support the Union side.{{ sfn | Andreas | 1885  | p = 162 }} Most of the units were infantry, but there were also [[Zouave#Zouaves of the American Civil War|zouaves]] and [[cavalry]]. In those days the most prestigious units were cavalry. Given that CBT members were among the most prosperous men of the city, it might seen logical that they would sponsor a cavalry unit, but no they formed an artillery unit - a unit that could use products made in Chicago by their own members.{{ sfn | taylor | 1917 | p = 281 }} The legacy is that today we call this the [[military-industrial complex]] - "an informal alliance between a nation's military and the arms industry which supplies it, seen together as a vested interest which influences public policy. A driving factor behind this relationship between the government and defense-minded corporations is that both sides benefit--one side from obtaining war weapons, and the other from being paid to supply them."

==== Non-sectarian support ====
Armour was a devout Presbyterian and an elder of his church.{{ sfn | Second Presbyterian Church | 1892 | p66 }} The development of his business, however, depended on people of all faiths who were healthy in "mind, body and spirit". An early effort to provide education, fitness and development that superseded religious boundaries was the [[YMCA]]. Armour was a trustee of Farwell Hall - which housed the early Chicago YMCA - in 1861 and then he was elected a director of the YMCA itself in 1867. Today the YMCA of Metro Chicago has 23 centers, five camps and hundreds of extension sites to meet the changing needs of the more than 200,000 members served every year.{{ sfn | YMCA of Metro Chicago | 2017 }}

He also seems to have been involved with the what is now the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church - Chicago's third oldest Black church.{{ sfn | Andreas | 1885 | p = 445 }}

==== Progressive attitudes toward people less fortunate ====

Support for Seaman's Bethel Church
--&gt;

==== Art of this country ====
In the 19th century, The cities of the East Coast built museums that imported European works and work by Americans who had been educated in Europe. From the get go, Chicago committed to patronizing art created by American artists. In 1879, with Armour as its first president, the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] was founded as a museum built upon an art school - the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]]. The school trained students to create art, the museum displayed their work. This example has been followed by few other cities. Nonetheless today the Art Institute is the second largest museum in the United States and at the same time the school is one of top graduate art schools in the US.

I remember reading this, but I did not keep track of where. I will keep searching - or delete...

--&gt;

==== Maintaining heritage ====
Even though Armour became one of the richest men of his era he never forgot the heritage of his humble roots. His sense of history covered what preceded his life and what happened after his life. He was a significant contributor to the construction of the Willow Creek Church in Argyle IL where he had spent the summer of 1836 building he 14' x 14' log cabin. He returned to Campbeltown in the 1880s and donated the funds to build a fountain. In helping create the Art Institute, the grain warehousing business and associated transportation, Armour was part of creating the American heritages of the future, but he never forgot his own humble roots.

==== Integrity and modesty ====
Andreas' ''History of Chicago'', the MLTC's ''Fifty Years of Banking in Chicago'', Taylor's ''History of the Board of Trade of the City of Chicago'', the ''Encyclopaedia of Biography of Illinois'' provide biographies for hundreds of Chicago individuals, but none of these works - even when they mention him many times - include a biography for George Armour.

In helping the Greenlees escape the avaricious tax collector, in making good Munn &amp; Scott's bogus receipts so farmers would not get hurt and banging his gavel hard when there's a racist incident occurring in the trading pit, we have a glimpse of a man living the American way.

Global Vision Inc. (GlobalVision) was founded in 1990 by Reuben Malz. It is headquartered in [[Montreal]], Canada, and has regional offices in the UK and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=681281|title=Global Vision, Inc.: Private Company Information |publisher=Bloomberg|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; GlobalVision is an enterprise software company that develops and designs desktop and SaaS [[proofreading]] solutions for brand companies and their supply chains worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://industryanalysts.com/global-vision-contex-launch-quality-assurance-initiative-help-pharmaceuticals-others-avoid-costly-print-errors-packaging-labeling/|title=Global Vision, Contex Launch Quality Assurance Initiative to Help Pharmaceuticals and Others Avoid Costly Print Errors in Packaging and Labeling - Industry Analysts, Inc.|date=2015-06-30|work=Industry Analysts, Inc.|access-date=2017-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Grand Larousse encyclopédique en dix volumes''''' ("Big Larousse encyclopedia in ten volumes") is a French [[encyclopedic dictionary]] published by [[Éditions Larousse|Larousse]] between February 1960 and August 1964,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/grand-larousse-encyclopedique-en-dix-volumes/oclc/369732 Grand Larousse encyclopédique en dix volumes] worldcat.org, 2013. Retrieved 5 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; with two later supplements that update the content to 1975.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.WorldCat.org&lt;/ref&gt;

It is both a dictionary, focusing on the study and the presentation of the words of the French language, and an encyclopaedia, covering all branches of knowledge.  In 1971, Larousse began publishing the much larger 20-volume "Grande Encyclopédie Larousse", with functional dictionary entries diminished, and regular encyclopedia articles greatly expanded.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.larousse.fr/archives/grande-encyclopedie&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online version ==
In May 2008, Larousse launched its encyclopedia online. In addition to the verified content from the paper encyclopedia, it is open to external contributors. Each article is signed by a single author who remains the only one authorized to make modifications.

'''''Hite v. Fairfax''''', (Original Case Citation: 4 Call 42) [[Case citation|8 Va. 42]] (1786) was a case decided by the [[Supreme Court of Virginia]] that upheld the original [[title (property)|title]] of land granted to [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]] over what was known as the [[Northern Neck]] of [[Virginia]], a large tract of land located between the headwaters of the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] and [[Rappahannock River]]s claimed by [[Jost Hite]].  Future [[Chief Justice of the United States]] [[John Marshall]] successfully represented the successors of Fairfax to the title. The land currently makes up what is currently considered [[Northern Virginia]] and the Fairfax namesake county, [[Fairfax County]], comprises the majority of this land. 

Marshall represented the tenants of Lord Fairfax, and won his case.  From this time, as an examination of '''Call's Virginia Reports''', which cover the period, shows, he maintained the leadership of the bar of Virginia. &lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Britannica (1911 edition) Vol. 17, p 770, New York 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The case is available in [https://books.google.com/books?id=S0YMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA646&amp;dq=%22Marshall,+for+such+of+the+tenants%22&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Marshall%2C%20for%20such%20of%20the%20tenants%22&amp;f=false Virginia Reports--Jefferson-33 Gratten--1730-1880--Call's Reports Volumes 1-6, page 646]

Marshall's [https://books.google.com/books?id=S0YMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA656&amp;dq=%22Marshall,+for+such+of+the+tenants%22&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Marshall%2C%20for%20such%20of%20the%20tenants%22&amp;f=false argument at the bar is available here] beginning in the third paragraph with "Marshall, for such of the tenants...."

== History ==
''Hōko'' can be traced back to "[[talisman]]ic figures" from early Japanese history,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and are likely related to the concept of using [[paper doll]]s (''[[Hina doll|hina]]''), as "stand-ins for people."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The use of ''katashiro'' (“substitutes”) in spiritual practice as stand-ins to take on the brunt of a person's sins or misfortune also played a role in the creation of ''hōko'' dolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Images of Familial Intimacy in Eastern and Western Art|last = Momo|first = Miyazaki|publisher = Koninklijke Brill NV|year = 2014|isbn = 9789004261945|location = Leiden, The Netherlands|pages = 224–225|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SEkJAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA224&amp;ots=61Vg_BPSVl&amp;dq=h%C5%8Dko%20doll&amp;pg=PR4#v=onepage&amp;q=h%C5%8Dko%20doll&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amagatsu===
''Amagatsu'' ([[Wiktionary:天児|天児]]; derivation unclear), are another type of doll similar in function to the ''hōko'' doll, documented back to at least the 11th century with a mention in ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Puppets of Nostalgia: The Life, Death and Rebirth of the Japanese "Awaji Ningy?"

The '''Jaysh al-Muwahhideen''' or '''Jaysh Abu Ibrahim''' ({{lang-ar|جيش الموحدين}}) is a [[Druze in Syria|Druze]] militant group in Syria. Their name means "'''Army of Monotheists'''" or "'''Army of Unitarians'''". The group mainly operates in the Suwayda, Deraa, Damascus and other regions where the Druze are concentrated and announced their formation in the beginning of 2013. The leadership describes the group as ''Unitarian Druze'' engaging in defensive jihad, but has also been described as supporters of [[Bashar al-Assad]] and his government. It operates largely in Jabal al-Arab or Mountain of the Arabs, also known as Jabal ad-Druze, a mountainous area of Suwayda governorate as well as the Jabal al-Sheikh area in Damascus governorate, areas primarily inhabited by Druze. The group was set up in response to attacks on Druze civilians. The group commemorates anti-colonial figures such as [[Sultan al-Atrash]], who was a prominent Druze chieftain.&lt;ref name=nIZ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joshualandis.com/blog/druze-militias-southern-syria/|title=The Druze Militias of Southern Syria|date=13 November 2013|accessdate=26 December 2013|author=Aymenn Al-Tamimi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aymennjawad.org/14059/more-on-the-druze-militias-in-southern-syria|title=More On The Druze Militias in Southern Syria|author=Aymenn Jawad|date=15 November 2013|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oHG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juancole.com/news/syria-comment/2014/09/suwayda-village-militias |title=Suwayda Village Militias |author=Aymenn Jawad |date=19 September 2014 |accessdate=6 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009135404/http://www.juancole.com/news/syria-comment/2014/09/suwayda-village-militias |archivedate= 9 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Barclay (anatomist).jpg|thumb|John Barclay]]
[[File:John-barclay-(1758-1826).jpg|thumb|right|John Barclay later in life]]
'''John Barclay''' [[FRSE]] [[FRCPE]] [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|FRCSE]] [[Fellow of the Linnean Society|FLS]] [[Wernerian Natural History Society|MWS]] (10 December 1758 &amp;ndash; 21 August 1826) was an eminent Scottish [[comparative anatomist]], extramural teacher in anatomy, and director of the [[Highland Society of Scotland]].

==Life==
He was born in Cairn, [[Perthshire]] 10 December 1758,&lt;ref name="royalsoced.org.uk"&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the son of a farmer, and nephew of [[John Barclay (Berean)|John Barclay]], who established the [[Bereans|Berean Church]].

He was educated at [[Muthill]] parish school.

Barclay initially studied divinity at the [[University of St Andrews]], and served as a minister. Then working as a family tutor, he educated himself in biological topics and anatomy. Pupils of his entered the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1789, and Barclay became an assistant there to [[John Bell (surgeon)|John Bell]] the anatomist, and was also associated with his brother [[Charles Bell]]. His employer Sir James Campbell financed the completion of his medical course.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Barclay, John (1758-1826)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barclay qualified M.D. at Edinburgh, before studying anatomy under [[Andrew Marshall (Thavies Inn)|Andrew Marshall]] for a year in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesurgeon.net/article/S1479-666X(06)80038-7/abstract|title=John Barclay (1758–1826) extra-mural teacher of anatomy in Edinburgh: Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|year=2006|publisher=Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland|accessdate=6 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Edinburgh and established himself as an anatomical lecturer in 1797. Until 1825 he delivered two complete courses of human anatomy, a morning and an evening one, every winter session, and for several years before his death gave a summer course on [[comparative anatomy]]. His classes gradually grew in reputation; in 1804 he was formally recognised as a lecturer on anatomy and surgery by the [[Edinburgh College of Surgeons]], and in 1806 he became a fellow of the [[Edinburgh College of Physicians]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

When a new chair of comparative anatomy for the University of Edinburgh was proposed in 1816, Barclay was the leading candidate. However, the proposal was defeated by the concerted opposition of a number of the incumbent medical professors, led by [[John Hope (botanist)|John Hope]], [[Robert Jameson]] and [[Alexander Monro (tertius)|Alexander Monro, tertius]], who feared the new chair would encroach on their own prerogatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophic Whigs: Medicine, Science and Citizenship in Edinburgh, 1789-1848|last=Jacyna|first=Stephen|publisher=Routledge|year=1994|isbn=0415036143|location=London|pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; This episode provided the subject of a [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Dr_Barclay%27s_advocation_to_the_proposed_professorship_of_com_Wellcome_V0006731.jpg memorable caricature] by [[John Kay (caricaturist)|John Kay]].

Barclay supported his former pupil [[William Dick (vet)|William Dick]] when he established his [[Dick Veterinary School]].

For the final two years of his life Barclay was too ill to teach, during which his classes were carried on by [[Robert Knox]], another former pupil.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

He died at Argyll Square in [[Edinburgh]] on 21 August 1826, and was buried in [[Restalrig]] Churchyard on the east side of the city.&lt;ref name="royalsoced.org.uk"/&gt;

==Works==
Barclay contributed the article ''Physiology'' to the [[third edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica]] (1797). He developed ideas for a nomenclature of human anatomy based on scientific principles in ''A New Anatomical Nomenclature'' (1803). In 1808 he published a treatise on ''The Muscular Motions of the Human Body'', arranged according to regions and systems, and with applications to surgery. This was followed in 1812 by his ''Description of the Arteries of the Human Body'', the result of original study and dissection. A second edition appeared in 1820.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

He furnished descriptive matter to a series of plates illustrating the human skeleton and the skeletons of some animals, engraved by Edward Mitchell of Edinburgh in 1819–20&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = John | last1 = Barclay | first2 = Edward | last2 = Mitchell | title = A series of engravings representing the bones of the human skeleton : with the skeletons of some of the lower animals and explanatory references | date = 1824 | edition = Second | publisher = MacLachlan and Stewart, | place = Edinburgh | url = https://archive.org/details/b24927727}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Several of his lectures on anatomy were published posthumously in 1827. Another work was ''An Inquiry into the Opinions, Ancient and Modern, concerning Life and Organisation'', published in 1822.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; In this work Barclay gives a spirited defense of [[vitalism]] against a catalogue of thinkers he considered to be advocates of materialistic theories of life, including [[Erasmus Darwin]], [[Sir William Lawrence, 1st Baronet|William Lawrence]] and [[Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard|Jean-Baptiste Fray]].[https://archive.org/details/aninquiryintoop00barcgoog] The noted Scottish zoologist and geologist [[John Fleming (naturalist)|John Fleming]] wrote that ''Concerning Life and Organization'' "should be perused with care by every student of Anatomy and Natural History, as an effective preservative against the doctrines of Materialism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Philosophy of Zoology; Or a General View of the Structure, Functions and Classification of Animals, Vol. 1|last=Fleming|first=John|publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; Co|year=1822|isbn=|location=Edinburgh|pages=xiii|url=https://archive.org/details/philosophyofzool11822flem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote ''Remarks on Mr. John Bell's Anatomy of the heart &amp; arteries'' under the name "Jonathan Dawplucker, Esq."

==Family==
Barclay married Eleanora, daughter of his former employer Sir James Campbell of Aberuchill, in 1811.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

==Legacy==
Barclay gave his large collection of specimens to the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] in 1821, under the condition that a suitable hall be built to display all the materials together, associated with his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Medical Teaching in Edinburgh during the 18th and 19th Centuries|last = Kaufman|first = Matthew H.|publisher = Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|year = 2003|isbn = 0-9503620-8-5|location = |pages = 77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1828 his collection became the Barcleian Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir William Jardine|title=The naturalist's library|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FwsOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA42|accessdate=4 April 2012|year=1841|publisher=W.

The '''Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change''' is a nongovernmental, not-for-profit organization founded in 1968 by [[Coretta Scott King]].  King started the organization in the basement of the couple's home in the year following the [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|1968 assassination]] of her husband, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]

In 1981, the center's headquarters were moved into the [[Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site]], a multimillion-dollar facility on [[Sweet Auburn|Auburn Avenue]] which includes King's [[Martin Luther King Jr., National Historic Site#King Birth Home|birth home]] and the [[Ebenezer Baptist Church (Atlanta, Georgia)|Ebenezer Baptist Church]], where he preached from 1960 until his death.

In 1977, a memorial tomb was dedicated, and the remains of Martin Luther King Jr. were moved from South View Cemetery to the plaza that is nestled between the center and the church. Martin Luther King Jr.'s gravesite and a reflecting pool are also located next to Freedom Hall. Mrs. King was interred with her husband on February 7, 2006.

As of 2012, The King Center's current President and CEO is King's youngest child, [[Bernice King]]. Located in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], the organization carries out initiatives on both the domestic and international level. The Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change is dedicated to research, education and training in the principles, philosophy and methods of Kingian nonviolence.

'''LEO''' (meaning ''Link Everything Online'') is an Internet-based [[electronic dictionary]] and [[translation dictionary]] initiated by the [[computer science]] department of the [[Technical University of Munich]] in [[Germany]]. After a [[Corporate spin-off|spin-out]], the [[dictionary|dictionaries]] have been run since 3 April 2006 by the limited liability company Leo [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]], formed by the members of the original Leo team, and are partially funded by commercial advertising on the website. Its dictionaries can be consulted free online from any [[web browser]] or from LEO's ''Lion'' downloadable user interface ([[GUI]]) which is free since version 3.0 (released 13 January 2009) to private users only and no longer sold as shareware. Corporate users and research institutions are however required to purchase a licence.

== Dictionaries ==
The website hosts eight free [[German language]] based [[bilingual dictionaries]] and forums for additional language queries. The dictionaries are characterized by providing translations in forms of [[hyperlink]]s to further dictionary queries, thereby facilitating back [[translation]]s. The dictionaries are partly added to and corrected by large vocabulary donations of individuals or companies, partly through suggestions and discussions on the LEO language forums.

For any of the eight foreign languages, there's at least one (in the cases of English and French two) qualified employee in charge (whose mother tongue is either German and who has studied the respective other idiom or vice versa). These employees oversee the above-mentioned donations and suggestions before integrating them in the dictionary. Thus an entry can never be simply made by a registered user. These registered users, on the other hand, have the possibility to communicate in the eight different forums where native German speakers and the other native speakers collaborate alike, providing help with finding idiomatic equivalents for phrases or texts etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dict.leo.org/pages.ende/faq_de.html#dict ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204035242/http://dict.leo.org/pages.ende/faq_de.html |date=February 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the eight dictionaries' user interfaces can be viewed either in German or in the respective language.

=== English–German ===
The [[English language|English]]-[[German language|German]] dictionary run by Leo since 1995 contains around 800,000 entries and receives an average of 11 million queries per weekday.&lt;ref name="dict.leo ende"&gt;[http://dict.leo.org/pages.ende/stat_de.html?lp=ende&amp;lang=en ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207100631/http://dict.leo.org/pages.ende/stat_de.html?lp=ende&amp;lang=en |date=February 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== French–German ===
In 2004, a [[French language|French]]–German dictionary was added to the site's services and has about 257,000 entries. This one gets about 2.6 million queries each weekday.&lt;ref name="dict.leo frde"&gt;[http://dict.leo.org/pages.frde/stat_de.html?lp=frde&amp;lang=en ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207100640/http://dict.leo.org/pages.frde/stat_de.html?lp=frde&amp;lang=en |date=February 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spanish–German ===
A [[Spanish language|Spanish]]–German dictionary with about 208,000 entries was introduced on 3 April 2006. It gets about 2 million queries each weekday.&lt;ref name="dict.leo esde"&gt;[http://dict.leo.org/pages.esde/stat_de.html?lp=esde&amp;lang=en ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207100650/http://dict.leo.org/pages.esde/stat_de.html?lp=esde&amp;lang=en |date=February 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italian–German ===
An [[Italian language|Italian]]-German was started on 3 April 2008. At the time of the public launch, the dictionary contained about 140,000 entries and received 77,000 queries on the first day.&lt;ref name="dict.leo itde"&gt;[http://dict.leo.org/pages.itde/stat_de.html?lp=itde&amp;lang=de ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205180235/http://dict.leo.org/pages.itde/stat_de.html?lp=itde&amp;lang=de |date=February 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it contains about 200,000 entries and receives an average of 1.1 million queries each weekday.

=== Chinese–German ===
The [[Chinese language|Chinese]]–German dictionary was started on the same date as the Italian–German dictionary, 3 April 2008. Queries can be entered by using [[Pinyin]], or [[Traditional Chinese character|traditional]] or [[Simplified Chinese character|simplified]] characters.&lt;ref name="dict.leo chinese input"&gt;[http://dict.leo.org/pages.chde/tipps_de.html?lp=chde&amp;lang=de ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204155650/http://dict.leo.org/pages.chde/tipps_de.html?lp=chde&amp;lang=de |date=February 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dictionary started with about 65,000 entries and received about 93,000 queries on the first day.&lt;ref name="dict.leo chde"&gt;[http://dict.leo.org/pages.chde/stat_de.html?lp=chde&amp;lang=de ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204155842/http://dict.leo.org/pages.chde/stat_de.html?lp=chde&amp;lang=de |date=February 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it contains about 195,000 entries and receives an average of 240,000 queries each weekday.
Due to text encoding limitations, the Chinese dictionary cannot be used in the interface.

=== Russian–German ===
On 18 February 2009, LEO announced&lt;ref&gt;[http://dict.leo.org/pages.ende/impressum_en.html?lang=en ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614085128/http://dict.leo.org/pages.ende/impressum_en.html?lang=en |date=June 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a forthcoming release of a German–Russian dictionary. The starter database has been provided in collaboration with ABBY Europe GmbH, the producers of the Lingvo dictionary brand.

The new dictionary became publicly available on 12 April 2010 after a couple of testing days . It started with 77,934 entries and received 38,800 queries on 13 April 2010. As the dictionary only went online in the evening it only received 3,607 queries on its first day.&lt;ref name="dict.leo rude"/&gt;

Today it contains about 300,000 entries and receives an average of 370,000 queries each weekday.&lt;ref name="dict.leo rude"&gt;[http://dict.leo.org/pages/about/rude/statistics_de.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Portuguese-German ===

A dictionary for the Portuguese language was announced in early 2011 and first launched in January 2013. As of September 2018, it contains more than 100,000 entries, receiving about 210,000 queries each weekday.&lt;ref&gt;http://dict.leo.org/pages/about/ptde/statistics_de.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polish-German ===

In 2013, a Polish-German dictionary was started which contains over 64,000 entries by September 2017 and receives almost 80,000 queries every weekday.&lt;ref&gt;http://dict.leo.org/pages/about/plde/statistics_de.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The site grew out of a network of [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] software and archived data which was put together by students at Munich University of Technology and [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich]] even before [[HTML]] and [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] existed. The original aim was to create a single, huge archive by linking up archives run by the different research groups (hence its name LEO – ''Link Everything Online''. The archive was sorted thematically and the different sections organised and kept up to date by archivists.

When the [[World Wide Web]] came into common use, HTTP access to the archive was at first added as an alternative to FTP. Students developed various services in their free time, in particular the dictionaries. Some services have been dropped in the course of the spin out.

==Name==
The name of the site is actually a [[backronym]] from the name Leo: the [[Bavaria]]n [[coat of arms]] features a [[lion]]. Originally, the service was named ISAR (a backronym for [[Isar]] river, on the banks of which Munich is situated; here, ISAR stood for ''Informations Systeme und Archiv München'', but it had to be renamed as there was another firm of the same name.

[[Christian mysticism]] refers to the development of [[mysticism|mystical practices and theory]] within [[Christianity]]. It has often been connected to [[mystical theology]], especially in the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox Christianity]] (both the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] traditions).

The attributes and means by which Christian mysticism is studied and practiced are varied. They range from [[Religious ecstasy|ecstatic]] visions of the soul's [[Bridal theology|mystical union with God]] to simple prayerful [[contemplation]] of Holy Scripture (i.e., [[Lectio Divina]]).

The experiences of [[Mysticism|mystics]] are often framed within [[Mystical theology|theological]] approaches to God, such as [[Quietism (Christian philosophy)|Quietism]], [[Pietism]], etc.; therefore, in order to aid in the understanding of [[Christian mysticism]], this list includes some philosophers, theologians, anonymous theological books, religious groups and movements whose ideas and practices have had an influence on Christian mystics and the Christian mystical experience.

*Remember to add the [[:Category:Christian mystics]] to the articles.

The '''matrix of domination''' or '''matrix of oppression''' is a sociological paradigm that explains issues of oppression that deal with [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[social class|class]], and [[gender]], which, though recognized as different social classifications, are all interconnected. Other forms of classification, such as [[sexual orientation]], [[religion]], or [[ageing|age]], apply to this theory as well. [[Patricia Hill Collins]] is credited with introducing the theory in her work entitled ''Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/252.html|title=Patricia Hill Collins, Black Feminist Thought in the Matrix of  	Domination|website=www.hartford-hwp.com|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
As the term implies, there are many different ways one might experience domination, facing many different challenges in which one obstacle, such as race, may overlap with other sociological features.  Characteristics such as race, age, and sex, may affect an individual in extremely different ways, in such simple cases as varying geography, socioeconomic status, or simply throughout time. Other scholars such as Kimberle Crenshaw's ''Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color'' are credited with expanding Collins' work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crenshaw|first=Kimberle|date=1991|title=Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color |journal=Stanford Law Review|volume=43|issue=6|pages=1241–1299|doi=10.2307/1229039}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matrix of domination is a way for people to acknowledge their privileges in society. How one is able to interact, what social groups on is in, and the networks one establishes is all based on different interconnected classifications.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wmst.gmu.edu/center/publications|title=Publications|work=Women and Gender Studies|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory applied ==
Though Collins' main focus of the theory of the matrix of domination was applied to [[African-American women]], there are many other examples that can be used to illustrate the theory. Other examples include [[Log Cabin Republicans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Mary F.|last2=Lott|first2=Phillip B.|date=1997|title=Backlash, the Matrix of Domination, and Log Cabin Republicans|jstor=4121156|journal=The Sociological Quarterly|volume=38|issue=3|pages=497–512}}&lt;/ref&gt; female criminality,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernard|first=April|date=May 15, 2012|title=The Intersectional Alternative: Explaining Female Criminality|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1557085112445304|journal=Feminist Criminology|volume=8|pages=3–19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and African-American Muslim Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Byng|first=Michelle D.|date=1998|title=Mediating Discrimination: Resisting Oppression among African-American Muslim Women |journal=Social Problems|volume=45|issue=4|pages=473–487|doi=10.2307/3097208}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key concepts of the matrix of domination is that the different categories, like race and gender, are separate groups, rather than a combination. This is a problem that can be seen in the law as well when it comes to discrimination because the courts fail to view discrimination as an overarching umbrella of intersectionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cousins|first1=Oswald B.|title=The Judicial Approach to Intersectional Discrimination: Significant Decisions from a Defense Perspective|date=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A way in which the Matrix of Domination works with regards to privilege can be if two people all have the same classification, except one person has an education and one does not have as high of an education. Their gender, race, sexuality, educational attainment all intersect to identify who they are. However, compared to other people one classification can point out privilege and, in turn, open more opportunities for one individual over the other.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One of the main aspects of the matrix of domination is the fact that one may be privileged in one area, yet they can be oppressed in a different aspect of their identity. Some people believe that racial discrimination is on its way to being eradicated from the United States when they look as people like Colin Powell, a very successful, African-American, middle-aged man. Although Powell obtains the characteristics of a person that may not face oppression (upper-class, middle-aged, male), he is still discriminated against because of his race. This shows one of the key components of the matrix of domination; the idea that one cannot look at the individual facets of someone's identity, but rather that they are all interconnected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rampages.us/oliviapryor/tag/matrix-of-domination/|title=matrix of domination {{!}} A so-sociologist|website=rampages.us|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Matrix of Domination Compared to Intersectionality ==

=== Historical Background on the Matrix of Domination ===
In Collins’ ''Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment'', she first describes the concept of matrix thinking within the context of how black women in America encounter institutional discrimination based upon their race and gender.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Collins, Patricia Hill. (2000) ''Black Feminist Thought: knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment''. New York, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent example of this in the 1990s was racial segregation, especially as it related to housing, education, and employment. At the time, there was very little encouraged interaction between whites and blacks in these common sectors of society. Collins argues that this demonstrates how being black and female in America continues to perpetuate certain common experiences for African-American women. As such, African-American women live in a different world than those who are not black and female.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Collins notes how this shared social struggle can actually result in the formation of a group-based collective effort, citing how the high concentration of African-American women in the domestic labor sector in combination with racial segregation in housing and schooling contributed directly to the organization of the black feminist movement.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The collective wisdom shared by black women that held these specific experiences constituted a distinct viewpoint for African-American women concerning correlations between their race and gender and the resulting economic consequences.

Moolman points out the main issue concerning matrix thinking is how one accounts for the power dynamics between varying identifying categories that are ingrained in both oppression and domination instead of the traditional approach, reducing experiences to a single identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14725843.2013.775843|title=Rethinking ‘masculinities in transition’ in South Africa considering the ‘intersectionality’ of race, class, and sexuality with gender|last=Moolman|first=Benita|date=2013|website=tandfonline|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, black women’s experiences with society are used to illustrate how even though white scholars have attempted to use intersectionality in their research, they may still be inclined to default towards single-identity thinking that often fails to address all aspects of black women’s experiences, thus ignoring the organization the matrix objectively offers.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281204860_Pursuing_Intersectionality_Unsettling_Dominant_Imaginaries|title=Pursuing Intersectionality, Unsettling Dominant Imaginaries|last=May|first=Vivian|date=2015-01-01|isbn=9780415808408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The matrix of domination in the colonial era and white society has also been carefully examined. The societal hierarchy determined by race and implemented under apartheid locates different racial populations in regards to their privilege, with African Americans usually at the bottom of the ladder. Dhamoon argues that on a global scale, the spot occupied by African Americans in such context is interchangeable with indigenous populations, as marginalized peoples are systematically working both within and across a matrix of interrelated axes of “penalty and privilege”.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.feralfeminisms.com/rita-dhamoon/|title=feral feminisms » A FEMINIST APPROACH TO DECOLONIZING ANTI-RACISM: RETHINKING TRANSNATIONALISM, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND SETTLER COLONIALISM|website=www.feralfeminisms.com|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interconnectivity of different identities in regards to power in racial structures in post-colonial era societies help illustrate what changes make a difference. The framework setup of the matrix of domination connects its origin theory and thought to existing struggles in the political and social spheres of society. A closer look at both specific and broader aspects of matrix thought will shed more light on the inner-workings and mechanisms that determine how different relationship dynamics influence matrix categorizations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

May cites that an important implication that matrix thinking inspires is that it directly goes against what is often described as the socially inclusive ‘add and stir’ approach.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This is often used when describing the addition of one or more identity group to existing epistemological approaches, political strategies or research methodologies. This accounts for the proper weighing of power dynamics and their impact on different groups of people. Intersectionality centers power in a multi-pronged way as shifting across different sites and scales at the same time. Therefore, it is not neutral but evolved out of histories of struggle that pursue multidimensional forms of justice.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Historical Background on Intersectionality ===
[[Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw|Kimberlé Crenshaw]], the founder of the term [[intersectionality]], brought national and scholarly credential to the term through the paper ''Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics'' in The University of Chicago Legal Forum.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crenshaw|first=Kimberle|date=|title=Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics|url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&amp;context=uclf|journal=Chicago Unbound|volume=|pages=139–167|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the paper, she uses intersectionality to reveal how feminist movements and antiracist movements exclude and women of color.  Focusing on the experiences of Black women, she dissects several court cases, influential pieces of literature, personal experiences, and doctrinal manifestations as evidence for the way Black women are oppressed through many different experiences, systems and groups.

Though the specifics differ, the basic argument is the same: Black women are oppressed in a multitude of situations because people are unable to see how their identities intersect and influence each other. Feminism has been crafted for white middle class women, only considering problems that affect this group of people. Unfortunately, this only captures a small facet of the oppression women face. By catering to the most privileged women and addressing only the problems they face, feminism alienates women of color and lower class women by refusing to accept the way other forms of oppression feed into the sexism they face. Not only does feminism completely disregard the experiences of women of color, it also solidifies the connection between womanhood and whiteness when feminists speak for “all women”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; (Crenshaw:154) Oppression cannot be detangled or separated easily in the same way identities cannot be separated easily. It is impossible to address the problem of sexism without addressing racism, as many women experience both racism and sexism. This theory can also be applied to the antiracist movement, which rarely addresses the problem of sexism, even though it is thoroughly intertwined with the problem of racism. Feminism remains white, and antiracism remains male. In essence, any theory that tries to measure the extent and manner of oppression Black women face will be wholly incorrect without using intersectionality.

Patricia Hill Collins wrote a book entitled ''Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment'', which articulated "Black Feminist Thought" in relation to  intersectionality with a focus on the plight of Black women in face of the world, the white feminist movement, and the male antiracism movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment|last=Collins|first=Patricia|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collins references Crenshaw's concept of intersectionality and relates it to the matrix of domination, "The term matrix of domination describes this overall social organization within which intersecting oppressions originate, develop, and are contained.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment|last=Collins|first=Patricia|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intersectionality and the Matrix of Domination ===
Both intersectionality and the matrix of domination help sociologists understand power relationships and systems of oppression in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gouws|first=Amanda|date=June 2017|title=Feminist intersectionality and the matrix of domination in South Africa|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/citedby/10.1080/10130950.2017.1338871?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=Agenda|volume=31|pages=19–27|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matrix of domination looks at the overall organization of power in society while intersectionality is used to understand a specific social location of an identity using mutually constructing features of oppression.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The concept of intersectionality today is used to move away from one dimensional thinking in the matrix of domination approach by allowing for different power dynamics of different identity categories at the same time.  Researchers in public health are using Intersectionality-Based Policy Analysis (IBPA) Framework to show how social categories intersect to identify health disparities that evolve from factors beyond an individual’s personal health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowleg|first=L.|date=2012|title=The Problem With the Phrase Women and Minorities: Intersectionality - an Important Theoretical Framework for Public Health|url=http://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300750|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=102 |issue=7|pages=1267–1273|via=DOI}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ferlatte applied an IBPA framework and used structural interviews to identify barriers to the allocation of HIV prevention funding for gay men. He highlighted policy more likely to cause harm than reduce the epidemic stemming from policy makers missing the ‘intersections of oppression, sex panic, and medicalization’.&lt;ref&gt;Ferlatte, Olivier. (2012). Are There Enough Gay Dollars? An Intersectionality-Based Policy Analysis of HIV Prevention Funding for Gay Men in British Columbia, Canada. 189-210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intersectionality can also be used to correct for the over-attribution of traits to groups and be used to emphasize unique experiences within a group. As a result, the field of social work is introducing intersectional approaches in their research and client interactions. At the University of Arkansas, the curriculum for a Master of Social Work (MSW) is being amended to include the Multi-Systems Life Course (MSLC) approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy-Erby|first=Yvette|last2=Christy-McMullin|first2=Kameri|last3=Stuass|first3=Kimberly|last4=Schriver|first4=Joe|date=August 2010|title=Multi-Systems Life Course: A New Practice Perspective and Its Application in Advanced Practice with Racial and Ethnic Populations|url=|journal=Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment|volume=20|pages=672–687|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christy and Valandra apply an MSLC approach to intimate partner violence and economic abuse against poor women of color to explain that symbols of safety (such as police) in one population can be symbols of oppression in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christy|first=Kameri|last2=Valandra|first2=Dr.|date=September 2017|title=A Multi-Systems Life Course Perspective of Economic Abuse|url=|journal=Advances in Social Work|volume=18, No. 1|issue=Special Issue: Trauma-Informed Practice|pages=80–102|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; By teaching this approach to future social workers, the default recommendation for these women to file a police report is amended and an intervention rooted in the individual case can emerge.

== Implications of the Matrix of Domination ==
Many approaches have been used that consider the concepts of identity, societal structures, and representation to be mutually exclusive, but the introduction of Patricia Hill Collins’ matrix of domination addresses the interlocking patterns of privilege and marginalization along the lines of race, class, gender, and class inside social institutions as well as at the community level.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winker|first=Gabriele|last2=Degele|first2=Nina|date=2011|title=Intersectionality as multi-level analysis: Dealing with social inequality|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1350506810386084|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|volume=18|pages=51–66|via=SAGE}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this work has come greater recognition of the various effects that each identity holds in different societal contexts, in both the micro- and macro-level structures within the systems of oppression that exist.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== In Female Criminality ===
In April Bernard's article, “The Intersectional Alternative: Explaining Female Criminality”, Bernard applies Patricia Hill Collins’ work to the study of feminist criminology, as a means of explaining the cumulative effects of identity in a system of oppression on women’s decisions to commit a crime.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernard|first=April|date=2013|title=The Intersectional Alternative: Explaining Female Criminality|url=|journal=Feminist Criminology|volume=8|pages=3–19|via=SAGE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard employs an intersectional approach to dissect the complexities that act as determinant factors in a woman’s decision to partake in criminal activities, and more specifically, the limiting pressures of a patriarchal society.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In particular, this article is framed in response to Robert Merton’s claims about deviance as a response to a lack of adequate resources to achieve cultural goals, as Bernard employs an intersectional paradigm model that explores female criminality as an expression of constraint and circumscription, rather than a “strained reality”.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; With this alternative framework, Bernard suggests that societal goals are not unanimous, and are instead shaped by individuals’ experiences in economic, political, and social spaces; for marginalized women, access to the means through which they build success are impacted by micro- and macro-level norms and histories that have created indicators of class (e.g. racial, economic, political, sexual) and subjugated them to limited networks.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Thus, identity makes women with marginalized identities more vulnerable in the legal system, subjugates to oppressive states within multiple institutions, and creating a need for policies that move toward creating an equitable reality for them.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== In the Welfare State ===
In the United States, especially, the matrix of domination has implications within the welfare state. Several sociological studies on the welfare state take note of state-market relations while ignoring the salient roles held by other identities such as gender, race, class, language, and age, among others.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Politics, Gender, and Concepts|last=Mazur|first=Amy G.|last2=Goertz|first2=Gary|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780521897761|location=United Kingdom|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the nature of the welfare state, there has not been much regard for exploring the existence of multiple axes of oppression which has led to lineation of categories of race, class, and gender.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In “''Politics, Gender, and Concepts''”, Gary Goertz and Amy Mazur assert that literature about the welfare state should focus on the relationship between social positions and social policies, as well as provide a framework for investigations into the causal effects of class, gender, and race. As such, using the idea of a matrix of domination in these kinds of studies provides a basis for empirical research on the relationship between social positions and policies, and also, for a comparison between the outcomes of social policies on marginalized and privileged women.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Intersectionality of Gender and Class ==

=== Benefits Among Class ===

The benefits that upper-class citizens receive from their employer are far different from that of working-class employees. This is due to the upper class taking jobs that give them a higher status or position, whereas the working class take jobs with lower status such as retail and blue-collar jobs.&lt;ref name="Pacific Standard"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://psmag.com/economics/work-life-balance-benefits-low-wage-workers-employers-35733.|title=Work-Life Balance Benefits Low-Wage Workers, Employers|work=Pacific Standard|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most obvious benefit that differs between classes is the amount of money made. Upper-class workers receive significantly more pay than the working class, and while the upper class receive salaries, the lower class typically receive their pay based off hourly wages.&lt;ref name="Pacific Standard"/&gt; Moreover, the chance of getting a raise is greater for the higher-ups. More benefits that the upper class enjoy over the working class are vacation time, flexible hours, retirement savings, and greater coverage of healthcare and insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://workingclassstudies.wordpress.com/2008/07/28/who-is-working-class/|title=Who is working class?|date=2008-07-28|work=Working-Class Perspectives|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits Among Gender ===

When it comes to workplace benefits such as health insurance coverage, pensions, sick leave, and disability plans, there are gender differences in whether or not these benefits are offered. Women are less likely to be offered pensions, health coverage and disability plans. In fact, high poverty rates among elderly women have been linked to lack of pension coverage. Additionally, many female heads of household remain on welfare because they cannot find jobs with adequate health insurance coverage. When it comes to union contracts, men are also twice as likely to be covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.3386/w4265 |title=Gender Gaps in Benefits Coverage |last=Currie |first=Janet |date=January 1993 |work=NBER Working Paper No. 4265 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This gender gap in benefits coverage may be due to the fact that women tend to have higher medical expenditures than males of the same age. As a result, some of the observed gap in wages between males and females in the United States could be the result of employers compensating for the higher cost of employer-sponsored health insurance. This further perpetuates gender discrimination because it means that firms who offer ESI (Employer Sponsored Insurance) will prefer to hire males. Another effect of women generally having greater healthcare expenses than men is that they are likely to place a higher value on insurance and be more inclined to pass up jobs for insurance-related reasons. This lowers the probability of obtaining jobs that pay higher wages directly and decrease a woman's bargaining power with her current employer. Indeed, health insurance has a larger (negative) effect on the job mobility of women, which they attribute to women's elevated healthcare expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-01-01|title=Employer-sponsored health insurance and the gender wage gap |journal=Journal of Health Economics|language=en|volume=45|pages=103–114|doi=10.1016/j.jhealeco.2015.09.008|issn=0167-6296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wage Gap Among Class ===

In the United States there is an unequal distribution of income between social classes for multiple reasons. Level of education has a great influence on average salaries. The higher the socioeconomic status (SES) of an individual the more likely they are to graduate from high school and potentially obtain a college degree, which in return increases their chances of a larger salary. The average salary of an individual with a high school diploma is about $35,000, but increases to about $60,000 by obtaining a bachelor's degree after.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://smartasset.com/retirement/the-average-salary-by-education-level|title=The Average Salary by Education Level - SmartAsset|website=SmartAsset|language=en|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gap in salary increases with each additional level of education received. Those in the lower class face more obstacles and have less opportunities to pursue additional education due to their lack of resources. The wage gap is even larger for individuals affected by poverty and racial barriers. Whites have a median income of about $71,000 while blacks have a median income of about $43,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/06/27/1-demographic-trends-and-economic-well-being/|title=1. Demographic trends and economic well-being|date=2016-06-27|work=Pew Research Center’s Social &amp; Demographic Trends Project|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics show that blacks make up 16% of public high school graduates, 14% of those enrolling in college, and only 9% of those receiving a bachelor's degree. At the same time, whites make up 59%, 58%, and 69%, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/04/24/more-hispanics-blacks-enrolling-in-college-but-lag-in-bachelors-degrees/|title=More Hispanics, blacks enrolling in college, but lag in bachelor’s degrees|date=2014-04-24|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is a 61% difference between blacks not obtaining a bachelor's degree and whites graduating with one. Individuals in poverty already face a disadvantage in obtaining the same level of income as their upper class coworkers, but when also affected by racial barriers the chances of reaching the same income are even fewer.

=== Wage Gap Among Gender ===

There is definitely intersectionality and inequality with women and men when it comes to wage gaps. Careers that pay well are often male dominated, and do not tolerate women and their personal needs. There has been a stable “pay gap” between men and women which has remained between 10-20% difference in their average earnings. (Women, careers and work life preferences).  When discussing wage gaps between genders, scientists takes into account two questions, the first being “is there differential access jobs on the basis of gender?” and the second being, “ is women’s work perceived to have less value than comparable work done by men?”.  When women begin to increase their numbers in certain job positions the status or value of the job decreases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hakim|first=Catherine|date=18 January 2017|title=Women, careers, and work-life preferences|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03069880600769118|journal=Taylor Francis Online|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptualizing intersectionality through class, gender and race then identifying the barriers that create inequality in Work organizations is found in the idea of “inequality regimes”. Workplaces are prominent locations to analyze the continuous efforts of inequalities because many societal inequality issues stem in such areas. In the works of Inequality Regimes: Gender, Class, and Race in Organizations, inequality in gender, race, class are examined through intersectionality in organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alksins|first=Christine|date=21 May 2008|title=Workforce Segregation and the Gender Wage Gap: Is "Women's" Work Valued as Highly as "Men's"?|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2008.00354.x|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joane Acker discussed Inequality Regimes: Gender, Class, and Race in Organizations in Sociologists for Women in Society Feminists Lecture through studies conducted using Swedish Bank.

=== Representation Among Class ===

Social class plays a large role on people’s everyday life, yet their representation is not always fair. In television and popular culture, those who fall into the lower class are often portrayed differently based on if they are a woman or a man. If they are a woman, they often are portrayed as being more intelligent and responsible than their husbands, almost acting as their mothers.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The male head of the household is typically portrayed as being less intelligent, with some redeeming qualities, but typically is not respected.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/socialclass.htm|title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications - Encyclopedia of Television - Social Class and Television|website=www.museum.tv|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they can be shown in a light that makes them seem lazy or dishonest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woods|first=Taniesha|date=October 25, 2004|title=The Development of Stereotypes About the Rich and Poor: Age, Race, and Family Income Differences in Beliefs|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/108157/Stereotype%20Development.pdf?sequence=1|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|volume=34|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper class however, does not face these same issues with representation in the media. The man of the household takes on stereotypical male qualities, while the woman takes on stereotypical female qualities. The children in this upper class scenario are what provides entertainment value, rather than focusing on the unintelligent and unorganized adults as in the lower class model.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Overall, in the upper-class family unit, they are portrayed as organized and put together, while the lower class model are portrayed as lazy and unorganized.

=== Representation Among Gender ===

In American society and many other societies around the world, being a largely represented group in a position of power means that one has succeeded in life. Whether one is a manager of a fast food restaurant or the CEO of a Fortune 500 company, authority is power and power is advantage. But just like the widespread power struggle, there is a widespread equality struggle. One of the largest workplace and societal inequalities is the inequality between genders. A prime example of this is the wage gap. Women in 2016 earned, on average, 82 cents to a man’s dollar. This unequal pay is part of the reason that many women are the ones to leave the workforce when it is determined that a stay-at-home parent is required; if women are contributing less to the household income, it will make less of an impact if they quit their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/04/pf/equal-pay-day-gender-pay-gap/index.html|title=5 things to know about the gender pay gap|last=Vasel|first=Kathryn|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are also not granted the same opportunities for employment as men. A clear example is the U.S. military. Women were banned from all combat roles until recently. In 2011, only 14 percent of the armed forces were female, and only 14 percent of officers were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2013/01/24/us/military-women-glance/index.html|title=By the numbers: Women in the U.S. military - CNN|last=Staff|first=By CNN|work=CNN|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the U.S. congress. In 2015, 80 percent of the Senate was male, and only 20 was female. This numbers were similar for the House, at 80.6 percent male and 19.4 percent female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/05/the-new-congress-is-80-percent-white-80-percent-male-and-92-percent-christian/|title=The new Congress is 80 percent white, 80 percent male and 92 percent Christian|last=Bump|first=Philip|date=2015-01-05|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gender composition of the military and the government, along with the wage gap, shines a lights on the gender inequality experienced right here at home, but this inequality is more greatly felt abroad. Some countries place strict limitations on women, not allowing them to vote or work or even drive a car. While the U.S. is seen as a country of dreams and opportunity, is far easier to see this when compared to an even more unequal country. The United States has been trending toward gender equality in recent years, but it has a while to go.

=== Research contributions ===

An article found in the November 1998 issue of ''Social Problems'' details the conflict involving racial domination by identifying the complexity African-Americans face.  In many cases, sociologists and laypersons alike are often limited in their approach to the problem.  Michelle Byng, in "Mediating Discrimination: Oppression among African-American Muslim Women"—the 1998 article—brings to focus new approaches to understanding discrimination, but also, she writes to illustrate the many overlooked opportunities in which the discriminated are able to empower themselves in certain situations.

==Intersectionality in Court Cases==
There are countless numbers of court cases that examine intersectionality within the workforce that did not allow individuals to have equal opportunities because of their race, gender, and social class.

The case, '''DeGraffenreid vs. General Motors''', provides an example when the law does an injustice to those that face discrimination. Five black female production workers were laid off, and took it to court claiming that the company was violating [[Title VII]] because, "it perpetrated past discriminatory practices of not hiring Black females." The court looked at each of the categories, race and gender, separately therefore they missed the discrimination of a person being both African-American and female. "It was argued, black women can expect little protection as long as approaches, such as that in DeGraffenreid, which completely obscure problems of intersectionality prevail.”&lt;ref&gt;Cousins, Oswald B. (November 10, 2017). "The Judicial Approach to Intersectional Discrimination: Significant Decisions from a Defense Perspective".&lt;/ref&gt;

Another case, '''Maivan Lam v. University of Hawai'i''', where intersectionality was the core reason behind the problem that emerged. Maivan Lam was not offered a job twice when she applied to be the Director of the Law School's Pacific Asian Legal Studies Program. Two times, the university was looking for a director and when the final offer came around, and she was the best candidate available, the university simply cancelled their search. In the first search, Professor Lam made it to the final round, but was not offered the job before the whole search was simply shut down. The second time, the position was offered to another candidate and the other candidate refused to accept, the search was simply cancelled without it being offered to Professor Lam. When Lam brought this situation up to the Dean, he suggested reopening the search so that male candidates who had not applied on time could submit their applications. It is stated, "Early in the 1989-90 academic year, the new appointments committee reviewed applications for a commercial law position. At one meeting, a male committee member stated that the Law School should not have two women teaching commercial law. This comment was reported to the Dean, who said that he recognized that the professor had difficulty dealing with women but took no action to remove him from the committee or otherwise to remedy the problem.".&lt;ref&gt;United States District Court for the District of Hawai'i, 1994, Maivan Lam, Plaintiff-appellant, v. University of Hawai'i; Albert Simone, in His Capacity Aspresident of the University of Hawai'i; Andjeremy Harrison, in His Capacity As Deanof the Richardson School Oflaw, Defendants-appellees, 40 F.3d 1551 (9th Cir. 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; There was clear intersectionality as Professor Lam was not only arguing regards to race but also how her gender affected her position.

In the case, '''Jefferies v. Harris County Community Action Association''', April 21, 1980, Dafro M. Jefferies claimed that her former employer failed to promote her to a higher position because of her race and sex. In 1967 she was employed by Harris County Community Action Association as a Secretary to the Director of Programs. She was later promoted to Personal Interviewer in 1970. Everything seemed to be moving in a positive direction for her. However, between 1971 and April 1974, Jefferies applied for promotions in various positions and departments without any luck. She realized that her employer was discriminating against her when two Field Representative positions opened. Jefferies immediately applied. However, the positions were already staffed by a white female and black male the same day that she was told about the vacant position. The company had purposefully told her about the open positions knowing that they were already filled by other staff members. After several complaints to the company, on April 23, 1974 Jefferies was placed on probation. In June 1974, she was terminated from the job because she had called the company out for discriminating against her because of her race and sex. There was clear evidence of intersectionality in this case; Jefferies was not promoted to a higher position because she was both black and a female.

It is difficult to determine which [[programming language]]s are "most widely used" because what usage means varies by context. One language may occupy the greater number of programmer hours, a different one have more lines of code, a third may utilize the most CPU time, and so on. Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications. For example, [[COBOL]] is still strong in the corporate data center, often on large [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]]; [[Fortran]] in [[computational science]] and [[computational engineering|engineering]]; [[C (programming language)|C]] in embedded applications and operating systems; and other languages are regularly used to write many different kinds of applications.

==Methods==
Various methods of measuring language popularity, each subject to a different bias over what is measured, have been proposed:
* counting the number of times the language name is mentioned in web searches, such as is done by [[Google Trends]]
* counting the number of job advertisements that mention the language&lt;ref name=computerweekly&gt;{{cite web|title=SSL/Computer Weekly IT salary survey: finance boom drives IT job growth|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2007/09/11/226631/sslcomputer-weekly-it-salary-survey-finance-boom-drives-it-job.htm|publisher=ComputerWeekly.com|accessdate=14 June 2013|date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JobsTractor&gt;{{cite web|title=Jobs Tractor language trends, based on jobs advertised on Twitter|url=http://jobstractor.com/monthly-stats |publisher=JobsTractor |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indices==
{{Update|section|updated=2016|date=May 2018}}
Several indices have been published:
* The monthly ''[[Tiobe index|TIOBE Programming Community Index]]'' has been published since 2001, and shows the top 10 languages' popularity graphically, the top 20 languages with a rating and delta, and the top 50 languages' ratings.&lt;ref name=tiobe&gt;{{cite web|title=TIOBE Programming Community Index|url=http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html|publisher=TIOBE Software BV|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The numbers are based on searching the Web with certain phrases that include language names and counting the numbers of hits returned.
* The ''PYPL PopularitY of Programming Language''&lt;ref name="pypl"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html |title=PYPL PopularitY of Programming Language index |website=Pypl.github.io |date=2013-11-22 |accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an indicator based on [[Google Trends]], reflecting the developers' searches for "&lt;programming language&gt; tutorial", instead of what pages are available.&lt;ref name="pypl"/&gt; It shows the popularity trends since 2004, worldwide or separated for 5 countries.

It allows the user to see the trends for one or more skills or categories at specified time ranges. Data is also accessible via a public [[API]], so anyone can generate their own statistics.
* ''[[Indeed]] 2016 survey''. Results show that among job advertisements [[Java (programming language)|Java]] is more popular than other languages combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://blog.newrelic.com/2016/08/18/popular-programming-languages-2016-go/ |title=The Most Popular Programming Languages of 2016 |website=Blog.newrelic.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Microsoft Corp. v. Shah''''' was an 
[[Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act]] (ACPA) case heard before the 
[[United States District Court for the Western District of Washington]]. [[Microsoft]] sued the [[defendant]]s, Amish Shah and others, for, among other charges, ''contributory cybersquatting'' for encouraging others, through videos and software, to infringe on Microsoft's [[trademark]]s. The case was settled out of court in July 2011 after judge [[Ricardo S. Martinez]] denied Shah's motion for dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

==Background== 
Amish Shah, with help from the other defendants, registered [[domain name]]s containing Microsoft trademarks, and induced others to register similar domains. Some of these domains used possible misspellings of trademarked Microsoft names.&lt;ref&gt;Ashby Jones, "[https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2011/01/14/on-microsoft-and-contributory-cybersquatting/ On Microsoft and ‘Contributory Cybersquatting]", ''Wall Street Journal'' Law Blog, 14 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Consumers seeking Microsoft products could mistakenly end up at the defendants' website and be tricked into downloading the defendants' products. In addition to [[cybersquatting]], the defendants also produced instructions (including a video) on how to use Microsoft's marks in a misleading manner to maximize traffic to the website. Shah also offered a software system that enabled buyers to easily create websites incorporating Microsoft's marks.

On the basis of the latter, Microsoft made claims for ''contributory cybersquatting'' and contributory [[trademark dilution]], in addition to cybersquatting, trademark dilution, and [[trademark infringement]]. Defendants moved to dismiss the claims for contributory cybersquatting and contributory dilution, arguing that such causes of action are not recognized under law. The ACPA created liability only for registering, trafficking, or using a domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to a protected mark. Additionally, the ACPA required proof that the defendant acted with "bad faith with intent to profit from the mark."&lt;ref name="acpa-bad-faith"&gt;{{USCSub|15|1125|d|1|A|i}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion of the Court== 

Judge Ricardo Martinez decided against dismissal on January 12, 2011, affirming that Microsoft had a possible case against Shah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court
|litigants=Microsoft Corp. v Amish P. Shah

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The court first noted that while contributory trademark infringement is well established, the ACPA, unlike trademark law, required a showing of "bad faith intent."{{source needed|date=February 2015}} Previous courts, notably in ''[[Ford Motor Co. v. Greatdomains.com]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

|accessdate=October 16, 2012
|quote=
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; reasoned that a higher standard was required for claims of contributory cybersquatting.

The court noted that the decision of the Ford court indicated that the court had recognized a cause of action under contributory cybersquatting, but found in favor of GreatDomains.com since Ford failed to show the requisite bad faith by GreatDomains.com.{{source needed|date=December 2014}} The Judge noted that in this particular case, the facts clearly demonstrated bad faith with an intent to profit, and as such denied the defendants' motion to dismiss.{{source needed|date=December 2014}} While the ACPA does not explicitly address causes of action under [[contributory liability]], the court noted that action under the ACPA is a [[tort]]-like cause of action, and traditional principles of [[tort law]] impose [[legal liability|liability]] on those who assist or contribute in the infringement.{{source needed|date=December 2014}}

==Impact== 

The court's decision notably expanded liability under the ACPA to include contributory damages, basing its decision on traditional principles of liability of tort law. Several scholars noted that the court's decision provides a precedent for expanding ACPA liability, beyond actions explicitly prohibited by the text of the law.&lt;ref name="jolt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="goldman"/&gt; This was particularly notable since Microsoft did not have to prove that the defendant actually sold any domain names to third parties or helped third parties acquire domain names.&lt;ref name="goldman"/&gt;

An attempt was made in 2009 to sue [[GoDaddy]], a [[domain registrar]], under a different charge of "contributory cybersquatting". In this case, the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|Northern District Court of California]] ruled in favor of GoDaddy in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://tigerintellectual.wordpress.com/2012/01/12/godaddy-in-suit-for-cybersquatting-contributory-cybersquatting/ Godaddy In Suit For Cybersquatting &amp; Contributory Cybersquatting]", ''Tiger Intellectual'', 12 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In professional wrestling, Piper was best known to international audiences for his work with the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF, now WWE) and [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) between 1984 and 2000. Although he was Canadian, because of his Scottish heritage he was billed as coming from [[Glasgow]] and was known for his signature [[kilt]] and [[Bagpipes|bagpipe]] entrance music. He earned the nicknames "Rowdy" and "Hot Rod" by displaying his trademark "Scottish" rage, spontaneity, and quick wit.

He accumulated 34 championships, and hosted the popular WWF/E interview segment "Piper's Pit", which facilitated numerous feuds.

Outside of wrestling, Piper acted in dozens of films and TV shows, including the lead role of John Nada in the 1988 [[Cult film|cult classic]] ''[[They Live]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/08/07/america_is_a_neoliberal_horror_movie_why_they_live_is_the_perfect_film_for_our_depraved_times_partner/|title=America is a neoliberal horror movie|last=DeVega|first=Chauncey|date=August 7, 2015|website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|access-date=September 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a recurring role as deranged professional wrestler, Da' Maniac, on the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] comedy series ''[[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia]]''.

== Early life ==
Toombs was born in [[Saskatoon|Saskatoon, Saskatchewan]] on April 17, 1954,&lt;ref name="OWOW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/r/roddy-piper.html|title=Roddy Piper Profile|accessdate=September 19, 2008|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; and was raised in [[Winnipeg|Winnipeg, Manitoba]]. He attended [[Windsor Park Collegiate]]. His father, Stanley Baird Toombs, was an officer with the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) while they lived in [[The Pas, Manitoba]]. His mother was Eileen (''née'' Anderson) Toombs.&lt;ref&gt;The Adam Carolla Podcast, January 8, 2010, ''Interview with Roddy Piper''.&lt;/ref&gt; After being expelled from junior high for having a [[switchblade]] in school&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=February 25, 1999|page=18|work=Kokomo Tribune|publisher=Newspapers.com|title=Roddy Piper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/20010070/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and falling out with his father, Piper left home and stayed in [[youth hostel]]s.&lt;ref name=pwhf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwhf.org/halloffamers/bios/roddy_piper.asp|title=Roddy Piper|publisher=Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum|accessdate=July 31, 2015|author=Pantazzi, Michael|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150719134008/http://www.pwhf.org/halloffamers/bios/roddy_piper.asp|archivedate=July 19, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He picked up odd jobs at local gyms, running errands for several professional wrestlers.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Training and early career ===
Piper was a [[boxer]] and an amateur wrestler before he started to become a professional wrestler. He won the [[Golden Gloves]] boxing championship. He was awarded a [[Black belt (martial arts)|Black Belt]] in [[Judo]] from [[Gene LeBell]], American Judo champion, instructor, stuntman, and professional wrestler.&lt;ref name=inthepit/&gt;

Roddy started wrestling under the care of promoter [[Al Tomko]] in Canada, his first match involving 'midget wrestlers' in front of a lumberjack audience in [[Churchill, Manitoba]].&lt;ref name=inthepit/&gt; He soon began earning money wrestling while still going to school. His first match in a pro and famous organization was with the legendary [[Larry Hennig]] in the [[American Wrestling Association]].&lt;ref name=inthepit/&gt; Friends of his played the bag-pipes during his entrance while he was handing out dandelions and then the ring-announcer had to announce something and all that he knew was his name was Roddy. So, after seeing the pipe band he then announced "Ladies and Gentlemen, here comes Roddy the piper", thus giving birth to "Roddy Piper" and the name stuck.&lt;ref name=inthepit/&gt; From 1973 to 1975, Piper was a [[Job (professional wrestling)#Jobbers|jobber]] in the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), NWA Central States territory surrounding Kansas City, and in the [[Maritimes]].&lt;ref name=heels98&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Heels|page=98|first=Greg|last=Oliver|author2=Steven Johnson|publisher=ECW Press|year=2007|isbn=1-55022-759-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked in [[Texas]] for [[Paul Boesch]]'s NWA Houston Wrestling promotion,&lt;ref name=heels98/&gt; and in Dallas for [[Fritz Von Erich]]'s Big Time Rasslin.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;

=== National Wrestling Alliance territories ===
==== California and Portland (1975–1980) ====
By late 1975 and early 1976, Piper was a top villain for Mike and [[Gene LeBell]]'s [[Worldwide Wrestling Associates|NWA Hollywood Wrestling]]. In 1977–78, he also started to work for Roy Shire's NWA San Francisco Wrestling in addition to remaining with the Los Angeles office, where Piper developed his Rowdy character. During this time, he made continuous insults directed at the area's Mexican community; he later promised to repent by playing the [[Mexican national anthem]] on his bagpipes only to anger the fans further by playing "[[La Cucaracha]]" instead, which in turn caused a riot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCO/is_5_4/ai_96307125|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040824083515/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCO/is_5_4/ai_96307125|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2004-08-24|title = Interview: Rowdy Roddy Piper|author=Keith Loria|accessdate=May 12, 2007|date=February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piper also managed a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#S|stable]] of wrestlers in [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Bert Rudolph|last=Sugar|first2=George|last2=Napolitano|isbn=0-8317-3912-6|title=The Pictorial History of Wrestling: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly|year=1984|publisher=Gallery Books|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Los Angeles area, Piper feuded with [[Chavo Guerrero Sr.]],&lt;ref name=slambio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/piper.html|title=Rowdy Roddy Piper|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=August 1, 2015|author=Milner, John|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923200244/http://www.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/piper.html|archive-date=September 23, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his father [[Gory Guerrero]]. Piper and Chavo Guerrero faced each other in several matches for the Jules Strongbow Memorial Scientific Trophy. Piper also defeated Chavo for the Americas Heavyweight Title.&lt;ref name=slambio/&gt; During the feud, Piper lost a [[Professional wrestling match types#Luchas de Apuestas|hair match]] and had his head shaved.&lt;ref name=matchhistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/ResultsArchive/Wrestlers/piper-roddy.html|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|title=Roddy Piper|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piper appeared in several [[Professional wrestling match types#Loser Leaves Town match|loser leave town match]]es and was forced to leave the territory.&lt;ref name=matchhistory/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Roddy Says Bye-Bye|publisher=Newspaper.com|date=August 21, 1977|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/3887653/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared in the territory as The Masked Canadian. In his first televised match as The Masked Canadian, Piper teamed with Chavo in a match against Black Gordman and Goliath for the Americas Tag Team Championship. Piper and Guerrero lost the match and faced each other two days later, with Piper defeating Guerrero for the Americas Heavyweight Championship.&lt;ref name=matchhistory/&gt; Piper wrestled as The Masked Canadian for several months until he was unmasked by [[Hector Guerrero]].&lt;ref name=matchhistory/&gt;

By late 1978-early 1979, Piper left the California promotions for even more fame in [[Don Owen (wrestling promoter)|Don Owen]]'s Portland{{ndash}}based [[Pacific Northwest Wrestling|Pacific Northwest territory]].&lt;ref name=slambio/&gt; He teamed with [[Killer Tim Brooks]] and [[Rick Martel]] to win the [[NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship]].&lt;ref name=slambio/&gt; Piper also won the [[NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship]] with victories over both Lord [[Jonathan Boyd]] and "Playboy" [[Buddy Rose]].&lt;ref name=slambio/&gt;

==== Georgia and Mid-Atlantic (1980–1983) ====
In the late 1970s, Piper ventured to the [[Jim Crockett Promotions#Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling|Mid-Atlantic territory]] where he beat [[Jack Brisco]] for the Mid-Atlantic title.&lt;ref name=slambio/&gt; He also defeated [[Ric Flair]] for the US belt which turned into a feud.&lt;ref name=slambio/&gt; From 1981–82, Piper served as a commentator on [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] (GCW) and feuded with the likes of [[Bob Armstrong]], [[Dick Slater]], and [[Tommy Rich]]. During the summer of 1982, Piper became a fan favorite after knocking out [[Don Muraco]] and [[Ole Anderson]] to save broadcast partner [[Gordon Solie]] from Muraco, who had grown angry at Solie questioning his tactics. In ''Wrestling to Rasslin'', Gerald W. Morton and George M. O'Brien described the transformation: "the drama finally played itself out on television when one of his [Piper's] hired assassins, Don Muraco, suddenly attacked the commentator Gordon Solie. Seeing Solie hurt, Piper unleashed his Scottish fury on Muraco. In the week that followed, like Achilles avenging Patroklas, he slaughtered villain after villain.... In the arenas fans chanted his name throughout his matches."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200954 |title="Rowdy" Roddy Piper |author=Patrick Jones |accessdate=May 12, 2007 |year=2002 |work=St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012182309/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200954 |archivedate=October 12, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Piper was fired because of showing up late for a match.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; He went to [[Puerto Rico]] for a month and was booked by [[Jim Barnett (wrestling)|Jim Barnett]] shortly thereafter. Piper returned to the Georgia area in the summer of 1983 to aid Tommy Rich during his rivalry with Buzz Sawyer. Eventually, Piper moved back to [[Jim Crockett Promotions]]. As a fan favorite, Piper feuded with [[Sgt. Slaughter]], Ric Flair, and [[Greg Valentine]]. Piper's feud with Valentine culminated in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Strap match|dog collar match]] at the first [[Starrcade (1983)|Starrcade]].&lt;ref name=slambio/&gt; Valentine broke Piper's left [[eardrum]] during the match with the collar's chain, causing Piper to permanently lose 50–75% percent of his hearing. This became known as "The Year of the Ear".&lt;ref name=slambio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Roddy Piper (Actor)|year=2006|title=Born to Controversy: The Roddy Piper Story|medium=DVD|publisher=[[WWE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In the Pit With Piper|last1=Piper|first1=Roddy|last2=Picarello|first2=Robert|page=109|publisher=[[Berkley Publishing]]|year=2002|isbn=978-0-425-18721-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Wrestling Federation ===
==== Early appearances (1979) ====
Before entering the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) full-time in 1984, Piper wrestled three matches with the WWF under [[Vince McMahon Sr.]] in 1979 at [[Madison Square Garden]].&lt;!-- Footage does exist of this, though it may possibly be hard to find. Based on that footage, this actually took place at a television taping, not Madison Square Garden. --&gt; Before one match, [[Freddie Blassie]] stuffed Piper's bagpipes with toilet paper, so they would not play in front of the Garden crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In the Pit With Piper|last1=Piper|first1=Roddy|last2=Picarello|first2=Robert|publisher=[[Berkley Publishing]]|year=2002|isbn=978-0-425-18721-0|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Piper's Pit'' (1983–1987) ====
In 1983, WWF owner [[Vince McMahon]] contacted Piper, who insisted on serving out his contract with Jim Crockett before starting his WWF run in 1984. Piper debuted in the WWF as a manager because of injuries he suffered during a dog-collar match at Starrcade; he managed [[David Schultz (professional wrestler)|"Dr. D" David Schultz]] and [[Paul Orndorff|"Mr. Wonderful" Paul Orndorff]], eventually Piper's run as a manager quietly ended and Piper started wrestling full-time. He was given his own interview segment called ''Piper's Pit'' on ''[[Championship Wrestling]]'' and ''[[Wrestling at the Chase]]'' in 1984, starting a run of the segment that ended in 1987. During one ''Piper's Pit'', Piper insulted [[Jimmy Snuka]]'s Polynesian heritage and attacked Snuka by smashing him over the head with a [[coconut]].&lt;ref name=slambio/&gt;&lt;ref name="rsObit"/&gt; Piper also insulted [[Bruno Sammartino]] during a ''Piper's Pit'' segment,&lt;ref name="rsObit"/&gt; which led to a feud that ended in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]] which Piper lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Graham|last=Cawthon|title=Ring Results: 1985|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/85.htm|publisher=The History of WWE|accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Graham|last=Cawthon|title=Ring Results: 1986|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/86.htm|publisher=The History of WWE|accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piper's next major storyline was with [[Hulk Hogan]] and also involved pop singer [[Cyndi Lauper]].&lt;ref name=slambio/&gt; In 1985, [[MTV]] broadcast ''[[The War to Settle the Score]]'', which featured a main-event match between Piper and Hogan, who was accompanied to the ring by Lauper, [[Captain Lou Albano]], and [[Mr. T]].&lt;ref name=slambio/&gt; This event set up the very first [[WrestleMania I|WrestleMania]], which pitted Paul Orndorff and his former manager Piper against Hogan and Mr. T.&lt;ref name=slambio/&gt; Orndorff was pinned by Hogan when Piper's bodyguard [[Bob Orton Jr.|"Cowboy" Bob Orton]] interfered and mistakenly struck Orndorff instead of Hogan. In ''Born to Controversy'', Piper recalled how during the match he had to keep Mr. T busy to cover Mr. T's lack of wrestling ability from being seen by the fans. From this situation, Piper and Mr. T's real-life relationship became hostile, leading to the inevitable conclusion that they be put into a feud with one another on-screen. Piper faced Mr. T in a [[professional wrestling match types#Boxing match|boxing match]] at [[WrestleMania 2]] in 1986, which Piper lost by disqualification after bodyslamming Mr. T.&lt;ref name=mainevent/&gt;

Following a leave of absence from the WWF, Piper returned as a face, during a TV taping of ''Championship Wrestling'' on August 23, 1986 against [[A.J. Petrucci]]. As part of the storyline, the returning Piper was distressed to find his ''Piper's Pit'' segment replaced by ''The Flower Shop'', a segment hosted by [[Adrian Adonis]], who had also hired Piper's former bodyguard Orton.&lt;ref name=slambio/&gt; Piper spent weeks crashing Adonis' show and trading insults, leading to a "showdown" between the two segments that ended with Piper being assaulted and humiliated by Adonis, Orton, and [[Don Muraco]], resulting in Piper's face turn. In response, Piper stormed the set of Adonis' show and destroyed it with a baseball bat. This led to their [[Professional wrestling match types#Luchas de Apuestas|Hair vs. Hair match]] at [[WrestleMania III]], which was billed as Piper's retirement match from wrestling before he left to become an actor full-time.&lt;ref name=slambio/&gt; Piper won the match.&lt;ref name=slambio/&gt;

In early 1987, Piper's Pit also served as the backdrop for [[Andre the Giant]]'s heel turn and challenging Piper's old foe, [[Hulk Hogan]], for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania III, and Hogan ultimately accepting the challenge.

==== Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion (1989–1992) ====
In 1989, Piper returned from a two-year hiatus. Although [[WrestleMania V]] was billed as his return, he actually made his first appearance on March 19 in Denver, CO at a house show when he hosted a live ''Piper's Pit'' and interviewed [[Bruce Prichard|Brother Love]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/89.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later at WrestleMania V he did make his official return with another live ''Piper's Pit'', where he hosed down a smoking [[Morton Downey Jr.]] with a fire extinguisher.&lt;ref name=rsObit&gt;{{cite web|last1=Montgomery|first1=James|title='Rowdy' Roddy Piper Dead at 61|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/sports/news/rowdy-roddy-piper-dead-at-61-20150731|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his return to the ring on May 12, substituting for Jake Roberts and pinning [[Ted Dibiase]] on a house show in Los Angeles. Piper would gain several more victories against Dibiase that month, and also against [[Randy Savage]] in June.

After this, Piper co-hosted ''[[Prime Time Wrestling]]'' from July 17, 1989 to December 25, 1989, with [[Gorilla Monsoon]], feuding with [[Bobby Heenan]], [[Rick Rude|"Ravishing" Rick Rude]], and [[Bruce Prichard|Brother Love]] he would return to the show in 1991 as well.&lt;ref name=slambio/&gt; Piper returned to the ring when he interfered in Rude's [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship]] defense against [[The Ultimate Warrior]] at [[SummerSlam (1989)|SummerSlam]], costing Rude the title. The feud was heavily promoted on TV and Piper would face Rude in many matches throughout the house show tours, including steel cage and lumberjack matches. The feud was so prominent that a survivor series match was built around it which saw both men captain a team and simultaneously be eliminated by countout during their brawl, though Rude's team would go onto win the match. The feud came to a head when the stipulation stated that if Piper beat Rude, Heenan would have to dress as Santa Claus for an episode of ''Prime Time''. However the feud would continue until March 1990 with Piper winning the majority of their matches throughout 89-90 including a win over Bobby Heenan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=630&amp;page=4&amp;s=300|title=Matches « Rick Rude « Wrestlers Database « CAGEMATCH - The Internet Wrestling Database|last=Kreikenbohm|first=Philip|website=www.cagematch.net|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He then feuded with [[Allen Coage|Bad News Brown]] who was upset at being eliminated by Piper at the 1990 Royal Rumble. Brown would go on to mock Piper for wearing a "skirt". At [[WrestleMania VI]] in April 1990, Piper cut a promo towards his opponent Bad News Brown before the match with half his face and body painted black. Bad News would take this as being offensive behind the scenes.&lt;ref name="rsObit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shoemaker|first1=David|title=A (Very) Concise History of Racism in Wrestling, 1980–Present|url=http://grantland.com/features/excerpt-david-shoemaker-new-book-concise-history-racism-wrestling/|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the match would end in a Double Count Out, with the issue between the two would never being resolved despite plans to the contrary.

In 1991, he supported [[Virgil (wrestler)|Virgil]] in his feud against [[Ted DiBiase|"The Million Dollar Man" (Ted DiBiase)]]. Later in 1991 Piper was involved in a [[motorcycle]] accident,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rajah.com/archives/flashbacks/wrestlemania7.php|title=WWE News, Rumors, Results, Spoilers @ Rajah.com|website=rajah.com|access-date=2017-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was still present at their matches at [[WrestleMania VII]] and [[SummerSlam (1991)|SummerSlam]]. He renewed his feud with [[Ric Flair]] and at the [[Royal Rumble (1992)|1992 Royal Rumble]] defeated [[Jacques Rougeau|The Mountie]] for his first, and only, Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship.&lt;ref name=slambio/&gt; He lost it soon after to [[Bret Hart]] at [[WrestleMania VIII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania20/WrestleMania8.html|title=WrestleMania 8, a two-for-one deal|publisher=SLAM!

==== Return and ''The Bottom Line'' (1994–1996) ====
He reemerged once again in 1994 at [[WrestleMania X]] as [[Professional wrestling match types#Special referee|guest referee]] for the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match between Bret Hart and [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WrestleMania Rewind: Hart topples Yokozuna (WM10)|publisher=SLAM!

Piper wrestled as a fan favorite, and adding to the face attitude by donating part of his purse from the fight with Lawler to a children's hospital in Ontario.&lt;ref name=lawler/&gt; In spring 1994, Piper began hosting a regular weekly segment on ''[[List of former WWE television programming#All American Wrestling|All-American Wrestling]]'' called "The Bottom Line" where he commented on various happenings in the WWF, as well as on his feud with Lawler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|series=WWF Television | title=Monday Night Raw (taped March 21, 1994)|episodelink=WWE Raw|network=[[USA Network]]| location=[[Poughkeepsie, New York]]|airdate=1994-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piper's segment aired regularly until the Summer of 1994, when Piper would disappear again.

Leaving the WWF again, he briefly returned in 1995 at [[WrestleMania XI]], once again in a referee capacity, for the submission-only match between Hart and [[Bob Backlund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=WWE|title=WrestleMania XI Facts/Stats|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/11/factsstats|accessdate=July 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this match Piper became the host for the replay editions of WWF pay-per-views for a brief period of time, commenting on the matches that had just happened, before disappearing again a few months later.

==== President of the WWF (1996) ====
On the January 29, 1996 episode of ''Monday Night RAW'', Piper returned for another regular role, as he was named as interim WWF [[Professional wrestling authority figures#President|President]] after [[Gorilla Monsoon]] had to take a leave of absence due to an attack by [[Big Van Vader|Vader]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Rowdy" Roddy Piper Dead: WWE Hall of Famer Dies at 61 |url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/rowdy-roddy-piper-dead-wwe-hall-of-famer-dies-at-61-2015317 |access-date=July 31, 2015 |date=July 31, 2015 |first=Allison |last=Takeda}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 24 at a house show at [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]] he made his first match appearance in almost two years. As a substitute for Razor Ramon, Piper defeated [[Sean Waltman|The 1-2-3 Kid]] after hitting him with a ring bell. He wrestled twice more against the Kid on house shows that month.&lt;ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com"&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/96.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

As president, one of Piper's first acts was to reinstate [[The Ultimate Warrior]] back into the WWF after a letter campaign written in by fans. Piper had become the object of affection for [[Goldust]]. Enraged, Piper claimed he would "make a man" out of Goldust at [[WrestleMania XII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WWF Monday Night Raw: March 11, 1996 |first=Graham |last=Cawthon |publisher=Camel Clutch Blog |url=https://camelclutchblog.com/wrestlemania-xii-minds/ |access-date=July 31, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The match, dubbed a "Hollywood Backlot Brawl", began in an alleyway behind the [[Honda Center|Arrowhead Pond]], but Goldust jumped into his gold Cadillac and ran Piper over, ultimately escaping (allegedly) onto the highways of [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]]. Piper pursued in his white [[Ford Bronco]], the aerial footage shown was actually that of the [[O. J. Simpson]] "low-speed" chase from two years prior. This was made clear by Piper himself, who recalled the event on an episode of ''Pipers Pit the Podcast''. The two eventually returned to the arena, where Piper disrobed Goldust in the ring, effectively ending the confrontation. With Gorilla Monsoon back in control of the WWF by the end of the night, Piper once again left the company.&lt;ref name="dspy"/&gt; His final appearance came the September 6, 1996 edition of ''Monday Night RAW'', where footage was shown of him participating with other WWF wrestlers at the CNE "Experience" in Toronto.&lt;ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com"/&gt;

=== World Championship Wrestling ===
==== Feuding with nWo (1996&amp;ndash;1998) ====
Piper joined [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in the fall of 1996. He made his surprise WCW debut as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] at the [[Halloween Havoc (1996)|Halloween Havoc]] pay-per-view in October to insult the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] leader and the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Hulk Hogan|Hollywood Hogan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://411mania.com/wrestling/ring-crew-reviews-wcw-halloween-havoc-1996/|title=Ring Crew Reviews – WCW Halloween Havoc 1996|accessdate=2017-03-04|publisher=411Mania}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the November 18 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'', Piper revealed that [[Eric Bischoff]] was a member of the nWo, which ended with the nWo attacking him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ddtdigest.com/updates/19961118.htm|title=WCW Reports - 11/16/96 - 11/18/96|accessdate=2017-03-04|publisher=DDT Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the December 9 episode of ''Nitro'', Piper told Flair that he didn't need the Four Horsemen's help in beating Hogan and he was going to do it on his own.

Piper took a hiatus from television before making his return to WCW on the September 8 episode of ''Nitro'', where he was appointed the new on-air [[Professional wrestling authority figures#Commissioner|Commissioner]] of WCW, which reduced his in-ring work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ddtdigest.com/updates/1997092m.htm|title=WCW Monday Nitro - 09/08/97|accessdate=2017-03-04|publisher=DDT Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt; He briefly resumed his feud with Hulk Hogan, beating him in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Steel cage match|steel cage match]] at [[Halloween Havoc (1997)|Halloween Havoc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://411mania.com/wrestling/ring-crew-reviews-wcw-halloween-havoc-1997/|title=Ring Crew Reviews: WCW Halloween Havoc 1997|accessdate=2017-03-04|publisher=411Mania}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the March 23, 1998 episode of Nitro, Piper and Randy Savage battled to a no contest.

===Xcitement Wrestling Federation (2001–2002)===
Before going to the WWE in 2003, Piper served as the commissioner of the [[Xcitement Wrestling Federation]] (XWF).&lt;ref name=slambio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=XWF 'In Your Face' PPV Review: A Look Back at the First PPV|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/PPV_Reports_5/article_3340.shtml|first=Doug|last=Brown|date=April 9, 2003|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 5, 2002 Piper's autobiography, ''In the Pit with Piper: Roddy Gets Rowdy'', was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Rowdy Roddy|last=Piper|first2=Robert|last2=Picarello|title=In the Pit with Piper: Roddy Gets Rowdy|publisher=Penguin|year=2002|page=iv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to WWE (2003) ===
Piper returned to WWE on March 30, 2003, by conducting a surprise [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Run-in|run in]] during the Hulk Hogan-[[Vince McMahon]] match at [[WrestleMania XIX]] in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], where he attacked Hogan with a steel pipe to cement his heel status; Hogan nevertheless eventually won the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WrestleMania XIX review|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/more/more-top-stories/96-wwe/3172|website=f4wonline.com|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keller|first1=Wade|title=WWE WrestleMania 19 report (3/30/03):|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Torch_Flashbacks_19/article_24954.shtml|website=pwtorch.com|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piper went on to align with [[Sean O'Haire]]; at [[Backlash (2003)|Backlash]] in April, [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]] hit Piper with Piper's own coconut, but this led to O'Haire defeating Rikishi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWE Backlash|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/backlash.htm|website=thehistoryofwwe.com|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, as Hulk Hogan had been banned in storyline from television by Vince McMahon, Hogan returned under a mask as Mr. America, and continued his feud with Piper, O'Haire and McMahon, who tried to reveal Mr. America's true identity. This storyline also saw Piper tear off the fake leg of one-legged wrestler [[Zach Gowen]], who was playing a Hogan fan. At [[Judgment Day (2003)|Judgment Day]], Piper argued with [[Chris Jericho]] if ''Piper's Pit'' was better than Jericho's talk show ''The Highlight Reel''.

Piper and O'Haire then moved on to challenge Tajiri and Eddie Guerrero for the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]], but in June 2003, WWE stopped employing Piper after a controversial interview with [[HBO]]'s ''[[Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel]]'' in which Piper discussed the darker side of the wrestling industry.&lt;ref name="ign 2007" /&gt; WWE cited that "Piper stated that he used drugs for many years while working in professional wrestling and that he does not like the person that he becomes when he actively performs as a professional wrestler", and dismissed Piper because of "inability to reach agreement on a contract and to assist Piper from engaging in any self-destructive behavior".&lt;ref name=JD03/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keller|first1=Wade|title=WWE says farewell to Roddy Piper, releases explanation|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_4313.shtml|website=pwtorch.com|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his 2006 DVD, Piper claimed that HBO took parts of his interviews out of context to make wrestling look bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video|people=Roddy Piper (Actor), Hulk Hogan (Actor)|title=Born to Controversy: The Roddy Piper Story|medium=Television production|publisher=WWE|location=USA|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Piper is considered one of the greatest talkers and [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] in wrestling history. ''[[Piper's Pit]]'' interview segments were considered innovative, especially in an atmosphere where only the people like the [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world champion]] got to talk, and the wrestlers were the interviewees—never the interviewers. Many of the people on ''Piper's Pit'' never got to be world champion, but were [[Card (sports)#Main event|main eventers]].

In '''''S v Nkondo''''' (2000), an important case in [[South Africa|South African]] [[Criminal procedure in South Africa|criminal procedure]], Nkondo had appeared before a regional [[court]] and was convicted of [[rape]] and [[robbery]]. The case was then sent to the [[High Courts of South Africa|high court]] for sentencing where it was held that N had not been thoroughly apprised of his [[Right to counsel|right to legal representation]] and had elected to appear in person.

The court held that when courts explain the right to legal representation to accused persons and an accused person facing a serious charge elects to remain unrepresented, the [[magistrate]] should ask the accused why he or she wanted to appear in person and if it appeared that the accused was under some or other misunderstanding that has to be put right.

The High Court set aside the [[Verdict|convictions]] of robbery and rape and [[Remand (court procedure)|remitted]] the matter to the regional court in order that the matter could be re-tried.

'''''Sad Song of Yellow Skin''''' is a 1970 [[direct cinema]]-style documentary film on the effects of the [[Vietnam War]] on [[street children]] in [[Saigon]]. The 58-minute documentary was written, directed and narrated by [[Michael Rubbo]] and produced by [[Tom Daly (filmmaker)|Tom Daly]] for the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB).&lt;ref name=CFE&gt;{{cite web|title=Sad Song of Yellow Skin|url=http://tiff.net/CANADIANFILMENCYCLOPEDIA/content/films/sad-song-of-yellow-skin|work=Canadian Film Encyclopedia|publisher=[[Toronto International Film Festival]]|accessdate=16 July 2012|author1=Piers Handling |author2=Peter Morris |author3=Andrew McIntosh }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Rubbo had originally gone to Vietnam with the stated goal of making a documentary about the work of [[Foster Parents Plan]] with Vietnamese war orphans. However, once there, and confronted with the enormity of what was taking place, he felt a film about this humanitarian operation was missing the real story. Rubbo's NFB producer, Tom Daly, supported him in his efforts to entirely rethink the film.&lt;ref name=Rosenthal/&gt;

Rubbo met the children in the film through Dick Hughes, a young American who offered his apartment as a safe haven for street kids. Hughes was part of a group of American student journalists who adopted a [[New Journalism]] approach covering the war—a highly personal and involved approach that would influence Rubbo's own style in making this film. This group of young journalists included [[John Steinbeck IV]].&lt;ref name=Rosenthal&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenthal|first=Alan|title=Documentary Conscience: A Casebook in Film Making|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520040229|pages=232–244|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KOpYTIx2GKYC&amp;pg=PA232&amp;lpg=PA232&amp;dq=Sad+Song+of+Yellow+skin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=A6FHAB4vWr&amp;sig=FuNr-fXVbi1oBgnyfGiWjDb8kRU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NjUEUJmPMtS-0QGaseSrBw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Sad%20Song%20of%20Yellow%20skin&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 July 2012|format=Interview with Michael Rubbo|chapter=Sad Song of Yellow Skin and Waiting for Fidel|date=16 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
   
Rubbo recorded his own subjective observations in a diary and developed the idea for what would be the first of his [[metafilm|self-reflexive]] documentaries with the NFB. In ''Sad Song of Yellow Skin'', Rubbo often comments on his own actions within the film, expressing his doubts, fears and concerns, reminding the viewer they are watching a film and not an objective representation of reality.&lt;ref name=CFE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenthal/&gt;

==Awards==
Awards for ''Sad Song of Yellow Skin'' included a special [[Canadian Film Award]] and the [[BAFTA Award for Best Documentary]].&lt;ref name=CFE/&gt; It was named best film over 30 minutes at the 1971 [[Melbourne International Film Festival|Melbourne Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DzFgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qm8NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6467,544590&amp;dq=blake+bill-mason&amp;hl=en|title=NFB production wins Aussie award|first=5 July 1971|work=[[Saskatoon Star-Phoenix]]|publisher=[[Canadian Press]]|page=5|accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Dictionary Project''' is a [[charitable organization]] based in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], [[United States|U.S.A.]], and was founded by Mary French in 1995 to provide personal copies of a [[dictionary]] for third grade students in the [[South Carolina]] [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] system. It has grown into a national organization.  To date, over 30 million dictionaries have been donated to children in the [[United States]] and internationally. It is funded through individual donations and by sponsors who implement the program in their local schools.

== Organization goals ==

The purpose of The Dictionary Project is to provide [[dictionaries]] to students to keep to use as their own personal reference books. The project believes that a dictionary is an essential tool for a quality education and that a student cannot do his or her best work without one.  This organization seeks to provide dictionaries to all of the children who are in [[school]]. The program is typically implemented in the third grade each year.

== Organization history and growth ==

The idea for The Dictionary Project began in 1992 when Annie Plummer of [[Savannah, Georgia]] gave 50 dictionaries to children who attended a school close to her home. In her lifetime she raised the money to buy 17,000 dictionaries for children in [[Savannah, Georgia]]. Annie Plummer died December 23, 1999. She inspired the creation of The Dictionary Project, a nonprofit organization.

The Dictionary Project was created in 1995 as a [[501(c)(3)]] [[nonprofit]] organization based in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. Its original goal was to provide dictionaries to third graders in the public schools in the three [[County (United States)|counties]] surrounding Charleston, and this was accomplished in the 1995-96 [[school year]] and every year since. In 2001 the project was expanded to cover the third graders in all of [[South Carolina]]’s [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]].

The project grew tremendously after it was featured in an article on the front page of [[The Wall Street Journal]] on March 4, 2002 &lt;ref name="Wall Street Journal Article"&gt;
{{cite news
|title=Wall Street Journal Article
|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1015206688445123600
|publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]]
|date=March 4, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This coverage brought national attention to the project and its founders, Mary and Arno French. As a result, individuals and groups from across the United States became involved with The Dictionary Project and sponsored the donation of dictionaries to children in their local schools.

The project continues to expand and now includes sponsors in all fifty [[United States]], [[Puerto Rico]], the [[US Virgin Islands]], Canada, and various other countries. The program has been adopted by [[civic organizations]] and adapted to local communities through the sponsorship of [[Rotary Club]]s, [[BPOE|BPO Elks]], [[Kiwanis]] Clubs, [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Granges]], Pioneer Volunteer groups, [[Lions Clubs]], the Republican Federation of Women and other service organizations, by educational groups such as [[Parent-Teacher Association|PTAs]], by businesses, and by individuals. Anyone can participate in this project by sponsoring a program to give dictionaries to children in their community.

== Awards and recognition ==

The Dictionary Project and its Director Mary French have been awarded several notable honors, including:

*Mayor Rybak of Minneapolis, Minnesota, declared March 20, 2009, Dictionary Day in honor of Mary French's work to create the Dictionary Project and their Rotary Clubs' sponsorship of the Minneapolis Public Schools (2009)
*the NFL/[[Parade Magazine]] Community Quarterback Award (2003)
*the Daughters of the American Revolution National Community Service Award (2003)
*the [[American Red Cross]], Carolina Lowcountry Chapter Neighborhood Hero (2002)
*S. C. Secretary of State Angel List (2002)
*the [[JC Penney]] Golden Rule Award (2000)
*invitations to speak at conventions for [[Rotary International]], the [[National Grange]], and the TelecomPioneers.

In addition, sponsors who have implemented the project have been recognized:

*Larry Hutchinson received a certificate of recognition from Chet Culver, the Governor of Iowa, for his work to coordinate the efforts of the civic organizations to give a dictionary to all of the third grade students in their state (2008)
*The California Dictionary Project received a [[Silicon Valley]] Impact Grant from the [[Cisco]] Foundation.
*Mr. and Mrs. Ormonde and Margaret Smith received the Gold Award from the Texas Association of Partners in Education.
*The Rotary Clubs of Arizona were commended by [[Arizona]] Governor Janet Napolitano for their participation in The Dictionary Project.

'''''Unbound Saga''''' is a [[2.5D]] [[side-scrolling]] [[beat 'em up]] [[video game]] developed and published by Vogster Entertainment and also a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comic book published by [[Dark Horse Comics]]. It was released July 16, 2009 for the [[PlayStation Portable]] via the [[PlayStation Network]], and on December 1, 2010 for the [[Xbox 360]] via [[Xbox Live Arcade]].

''Unbound Saga'' is the story of Rick Ajax, a comic book character who is aware he is in a comic.  Ajax and fellow comic character Lori Machete seek to confront the artist who created them and be freed from constantly fighting.

The game received moderate reviews from critics, with the PlayStation Portable version averaging 52.60% at [[GameRankings]] and 56/100 at [[Metacritic]]. Reviewers felt that the game's art direction was well done, with several reviewers praising the comic-esque cutscenes, as well as the voice acting. Some reviewers felt that the combat lacked polish, and that the combat and upgrade system lacked depth. Others lauded the simplicity of combat, likening it to classic beat 'em up titles.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:UnboundSaga screenshot.png|thumb|left|''Unbound Saga'' takes place inside a comic book and follows Rick Ajax, a character aware he is in a comic, and bent on confronting his maker.]]
''Unbound Saga'' is a [[2.5D]] [[side-scrolling]] [[beat 'em up]] game.&lt;ref name="gamespot nycc09"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_c0bh62rxA |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=2010-12-09 |date=2009-02-10 |title=GameSpot @ Comic-Con NY 09: Unbound Saga |first=Ricardo |last=Torres}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game is played as though the character is reading a comic book.  In individual comic panels the player character fights off his enemies using a combination of three attacks, which can be chained together in [[Combo (video gaming)|combos]].  When a character is defeated the hand of The Maker appears and draws additional enemies.&lt;ref name="joystiq nycc09"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/02/07/nycc-09-hands-on-with-unbound-saga/ |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |accessdate=2010-12-12 |title=NYCC 09: Hands-on with Unbound Saga |first=Andrew |last=Yoon |date=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to complete a panel, the player must defeat all the enemies The Maker draws.  As a panel is completed, the character jumps to the next one, similar to ''[[Comix Zone]]''.  The environment locales vary and include areas such as sewers, city slums, jungles and tundra.&lt;ref name="gametrailers interview"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/ny-comic-con-unbound-saga/45457 |publisher=[[GameTrailers]] |accessdate=2010-12-12 |title=NY Comic-Con 09: Producer Interview |date=2009-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the game's two playable characters has a unique animation set and fighting style.&lt;ref name="gamespot nycc09" /&gt;  Rick uses a fighting style similar to wrestling and can also pick up and throw enemies.  Lori's moveset is more reminiscent of kung fu, and she has the ability to use smoke pellets to sneak up on enemies.&lt;ref name="gametrailers interview" /&gt;  Characters moves and abilities can be upgraded to earn and upgrade more powerful attacks.&lt;ref name="gametrailers interview" /&gt;  Two players can team up to complete the game on the Xbox 360, each taking a respective character.&lt;ref name="xbla announce"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/04/23/unbound-saga-will-beat-em-up-on-xbla/ |title=Unbound Saga will beat 'em up on XBLA |date=2010-04-23 |accessdate=2010-12-12 |publisher=Joystiq |first=Richard |last=Mitchell}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Objects can also be picked up and thrown.

==Plot==
The game follows Rick Ajax, a bartending comic book character aware of the fact that he is in a comic.  He knows of his creator, whom he refers to as The Maker.  A second character, Lori Machete, is also available for play.  Together they journey through the fictional city of Toxopolis to confront The Maker.&lt;ref name="the game"&gt;{{cite video game | title=Unbound Saga | developer=Vogster Entertainment |publisher=Vogster Entertainment |date=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and promotion==
''Unbound Saga'' was first announced by Vogster Entertainment for the [[PlayStation Portable]] at [[New York Comic Con]] 2009.&lt;ref name="gamespot nycc09" /&gt;  It was released July 16, 2009.  On April 23, 2010, Vogster announced that the game was being ported to the [[Xbox 360]].&lt;ref name="xbla announce" /&gt;  The port was announced to have [[cooperative gameplay]], a feature absent from the PSP version.&lt;ref name="xbla announce" /&gt;  It was subsequently released on [[Xbox Live Arcade]] on December 1, 2010.&lt;ref name="release xbla"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/12/01/xbla-in-brief-unbound-saga-crazy-taxi/ |title=XBLA in Brief: Unbound Saga, Crazy Taxi |date=2010-12-01 |accessdate=2010-12-12 |publisher=Joystiq |first=Richard |last=Mitchell}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview with Mike Kennedy from Vogster Entertainment Kennedy stated the game was influenced by ''[[Final Fight]]'' and ''[[Streets of Rage]]''.&lt;ref name="gamespot nycc09" /&gt;

The art for the in-game cutscenes was done by [[Cliff Richards]].&lt;ref name="gamespot nycc09" /&gt;  A [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comic book was also created and published by [[Dark Horse Comics]] in conjunction with the game.  Richards also created all of the art for the comic book.&lt;ref name="gamespot nycc09" /&gt;  Mike Kennedy stated in an interview at [[St. Louis]] [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] 2009 that the game and the comic had always been developed as one, rather than one being an adaptation of the other.&lt;ref name="superfunpatrol"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rvcf86EGeZo |title=Interview with Mike Kennedy, Senior Producer of Unbound Saga.

Reviewers had mixed views on ''Unbound Saga''{{'}}s gameplay.  The reviewer from Spazio Games, an Italian gaming site, compared the game to ''[[Double Dragon]]'' and ''[[Final Fight]]''.&lt;ref name="spaziogames review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.spaziogames.it/recensioni_videogiochi/console_playstation_psp/9416/unbound-saga.aspx |title=Unbound Saga |date=2010-12-01 |publisher=Spazio Games |language=Italian |accessdate=2010-12-12 |author=DottorKillex}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reviewer felt that the game felt rushed, and this affected gameplay.  Carolyn Petit of [[GameSpot]] was more critical of the game, calling it "dull" and "mindless.&lt;ref name="gamespot review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/psp/action/unboundsaga/review.html |title=Unbound Saga Review |date=2009-07-23 |first=Carolyn |last=Petit |accessdate=2010-12-09 |publisher=GameSpot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[IGN]]'s Greg Miller noted the inclusion of combos and upgradeable character statistics, but felt that they "never really amplify the fun in alternating between punch and kick."&lt;ref name="ign review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/100/1005100p1.html |title=Unbound Saga Review |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2010-12-09 |date=2009-07-17 |first=Greg |last=Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Destructoid's Jim Sterling noted "While there are more complex combos to unlock during the course of the game, the meat and potatoes of ''Unbound Saga'' is the endless hammering buttons to punch, kick and throw enemies around each level."&lt;ref name="destructoid review" /&gt;  Co-reviewer Nick Chester called it "classic beat-’em-up game".&lt;ref name="destructoid review" /&gt;  Although giving the simple gameplay high marks, Chester felt that the PSP version of the game should have received cooperative play.&lt;ref name="destructoid review" /&gt; Mike Jackson of [[GamesRadar]] appreciated the addition of cooperative gameplay on the Xbox 360 version, but wished players could join or leave [[on the fly]].&lt;ref name="gamesradar review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/xbox360/unbound-saga/review/unbound-saga-review/a-2010121017545885046/g-2010121016575437049 |first=Mike |last=Jackson |accessdate=2010-12-12 |date=2010-12-10 |publisher=[[GamesRadar]] |title=Unbound Saga}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics were universal in praising the comic book art and voice acting present in the game's cutscenes. The reviewer from Spazio Games felt the cutscenes were well crafted and professionally done.&lt;ref name="spaziogames review" /&gt;  GameSpot's Carolyn Petit stated that the "cutscenes are the game's high point and feature gorgeous comic-book artwork", and added "the voice actors do a fine job".&lt;ref name="gamespot review" /&gt;  Destructoid's Jim Sterling called the visuals "gritty comic book feel that doesn't look obtusely cel-shaded" and added "the voice talent is damn good as well".&lt;ref name="destructoid review" /&gt;  Nick Chester agreed with his co-reviewer and added "without a doubt, the game’s animated comics-brought-to-life cut-scenes are absolutely marvelous."&lt;ref name="destructoid review" /&gt;  GamesRadar's Mike Jackson enjoyed the character's [[one-liner joke|one-liners]].  He stated it was "pretty amusing with a tinge of adult humor."&lt;ref name="gamesradar review" /&gt; He also felt that the plot was well written, that the characters were instantly likable, and that the game had a "great comic book style."&lt;ref name="gamesradar review" /&gt;  Brian Rowe of GameZone was surprisingly pleased with the game's soundtrack, and called it "unusually cool."&lt;ref name="gamezone review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://xbox.gamezone.com/reviews/item/unbound_saga/ |title=Unbound Saga |first=Brian |last=Rowe |date=2010-12-16 |accessdate=2010-12-16 |publisher=GameZone}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{-}}

The '''Women Environmental Artists Directory''' (WEAD) focuses on promoting environmental and [[Social justice]] art. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://weadartists.org/about-us | title=About Us | publisher=Women Environmental Artists Directory | accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; WEAD was founded in 1996 by Jo Hanson, Susan Leibovitz Steinman and Estelle Akamine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://greenmuseum.org/generic_content.php?ct_id=285 | title=JO HANSON: Pioneering Environmental Artist Dies in San Francisco | publisher=Green Museum | accessdate=2013-08-12 | last=Leibovitz Steinman | first=Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

WEAD has been listed among the best projects relating to [[Environmental art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/md2z/greenarts/artprojects.html | title=Green Arts Web: Artists &amp; Projects | publisher=Carnegie Mellon University | accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has sponsored a number of exhibits about activist eco art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earthly Concerns, Activist EcoArt curated by WEAD|url=http://www.usfca.edu/uploadedFiles/Destinations/Library/thacher/archive/Earthly%20Concerns.pdf|publisher=University of San Francisco|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CONVERGENCE/DIVERGENCE SYMPOSIUM|url=http://www.losmedanos.edu/art/archive.aspx|publisher=Los Medanos College|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WEAD East I Women and the Environment|url=http://www.kbcc.cuny.edu/artgallery/Pages/ewead.aspx|publisher=Kingsborough Community College|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The directory lists a wide variety of [[Woman artists]], such as [[Marina DeBris]], a [[trashion]] artist, [[Betty Beaumont]], often called a pioneer of environmental art, and Shai Zakai.

WEAD also published a magazine, which focuses on such topics as dirty water, and the legacy of atomic energy. A recent guest editor was Dr. Elizabeth Dougherty, founder of Wholly H2O, and speaker at events such as [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] conference on [[Water conservation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Water Conservation Showcase Speakers Save Water by Going Paperless!|url=http://www.pge.com/pec/water/presentations.shtml|publisher=Pacific Gas and Electric Company|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Toulumne County's conference on [[greywater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greywater in California:  Designing, Managing, Monitoring|url=http://portal.co.tuolumne.ca.us/psp/ps/TUP_HS_ENVIR_HEALTH/ENTP/c/TU_DEPT_MENU.TUOCM_HTML_COMP.GBL?action=U&amp;CONTENT_PNM=EMPLOYEE&amp;CATGID=2651|publisher=TUOLUMNE COUNTY ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linda Weintraub was a contributor to a recent issue of the WEAD magazine.

==Background==
The Worsdales entered into a contract in 1980 to purchase the Polglase's Paraparaumu home for $60,000, paying $6,000 deposit.

To finance their purchase, the Worsdales were expecting $20,000 from a business transaction, plus a further $28,000 from the sale of a property. However, 21 days before the date of settlement, both these funds had not materialized, and as a result, they advised the vendors that they had repudiated the contract.

On the following day, the vendors advised the Worsdales that they had now cancelled the contract, and on the same day, resold the property to another party for $60,000.

The Worsdales sought relief from the courts for their deposit of $6,000 that was forfeited

==Held==
The court held that a deposit of 10% was customary, and refused to grant any relief here for a forfeited deposit of 10%.

'''Wyatt Angelicus van Sandau Papworth''' (1822–1894) was an English architect, surveyor and antiquarian. He is best known for his editorial work on the part-published ''Dictionary of Architecture'', appearing 1853 to 1892, and the 1867 edition of [[Joseph Gwilt]]'s ''Encyclopædia of Architecture''.

==Life==
Born in London on 23 January 1822, he was a younger son of  the architect [[John Buonarotti Papworth]]. He received professional training in his father's office, and for some years worked in the office of the commissioners of sewers for Westminster. After a short time in the office of [[Sir John Rennie]], he became assistant surveyor, under [[Thomas Allason]], to the [[Alliance Assurance Company]]. On Allason's death he became sole surveyor there, in 1887 retiring on a pension. Besides the ordinary duties of his office, which comprised very numerous rebuildings and restorations under his direction, he designed and erected for the company a branch office at Ipswich in Suffolk, and published notes on fire risks.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Papworth, Wyatt Angelicus Van Sandau|volume=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lipman|first1=Sonia L.|last2=Lipman|first2=Vivian David|title=The Century of Moses Montefiore|year=1985|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780197100417|page=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papworth was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) in 1860, and sat for many years on its council. His father being a member of the [[Cloth-Workers' Company]], Papworth in due course became one of its liveryman of the company; and being elected to the court, he in 1879–81 served the offices of junior and senior warden, attaining the position of Master of the Company in 1889. During his year in office he represented the company at the opening of two new technical schools at [[Bingley]] and [[Dewsbury]]. He was interested in [[technical education]], acting as a governor of the [[City and Guilds of London Institute]], and represented his company on the governing body of [[Islington Polytechnic]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In 1893, on the death of [[James William Wild]], Papworth was appointed curator of [[Sir John Soane's Museum]] in Lincoln's Inn Fields. He died at the Soane Museum on 19 August 1894, and was buried in [[Highgate cemetery]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works== 
Papworth undertook antiquarian investigations on topics associated with his profession. He sought to define the periods when fir, deal, and house-painting were introduced into England, and to determine the extent of the use of chestnut-timber in old buildings.&lt;ref&gt;''Trans. Royal Inst. Brit. Architects'', vol. viii. 1857 and 14 June 1858.&lt;/ref&gt; He researched the architects of medieval buildings, and, while not himself a [[Freemason]], their connection with freemasonry.&lt;ref&gt;Papers in the publications of the Lodge Quatuor Coronati, No. 2076, London, 1890 iii. 162–7, 1891 iv. 219, 244, 1892 v. 143, 1893 vi. 1888, 1894 vii. 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Gabriel Findel]], ''History of Freemasonry'', London, 1866&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Freke Gould]], ''History of Freemasonry'', London, 1882–7.&lt;/ref&gt; His concern was the correct attribution of the designs for the buildings erected in England during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Trans. R.I.B.A.'' vol. x. 23 Jan. 1860, vol. xii. 2 Dec. 1861; and papers in Journ. R.I.B.A.: "William of Wykeham, Mediæval Masons, &amp;c.", 1867, iii. 310–385; "Cambridge University", 1888, iv. 356–358, 369–77; "Fremasonry Ancient and Modern", 1890, vi. 156–9; "The Building of Blenheim", 1890, vi. 12, 14, 60, 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848, when Papworth and his brother [[John Woody Papworth]] had accumulated notes on the history of architecture, he issued a circular letter, suggesting a "Society for the Promotion of Architectural Information intended for the Revival and Restoration, Investigation and Publication, of Knowledge in Architecture and the Arts connected therewith." The result was the formation of the Architectural Publication Society for the production of "Detached Essays and Illustrations", which might be subsequently incorporated in a ''Cyclopædia of Architecture.'' Papworth prepared a list of 12,127 terms or headings. In 1852 the plan of the cyclopædia was reduced to a ''Dictionary of Explanation and Reference'', which was started under the direction of a committee of leading architects. Wyatt Papworth was secretary and editor, and was assisted by his brother, John. The first part of this ''Dictionary'' was published in May 1853, and the last part in April 1892, forming eight volumes folio of text, and three volumes of illustrations, and containing 18,456 articles. The editorship and compilation of the ''Dictionary'' were entirely in Papworth's hands; nearly all the lists and references in the text and most of the biographical and topographical articles were also his. The work was printed for subscribers only, and produced at a cost of nearly £10,000.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Papworth revised and edited in 1867 Joseph Gwilt's ''Encyclopædia of Architecture'', first published in 1842. Papworth's edition included new information, which was greatly increased in two further editions produced by him in 1876 and 1889.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

For the Soane Museum, Papworth rewrote the ''Catalogue'', and produced a sixth edition of its ''General Description''. He supported the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' in the preparation of articles on architects, and himself contributed articles to vols. xli.–xliii.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

With his brother John, Papworth published:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

*''Specimens of Decoration in the Italian Style'', London, 1844. 
*''Museums, Libraries, and Picture Galleries'',  London, 1853. 
*''Notes on the Causes of Fires in Buildings, arising from Grates, Furnaces, Stoves, and Gas, and which is the safest of the various Methods of Warming Buildings'', London, 1853. 
*''Notes on Spontaneous Combustion'', London, 1855. 
*''Life and Works of J. B. Papworth, Architect to the King of Würtemburg, London, 1879. 
*''Memoirs of A. W. Morant'', London, 1881. 
*''The Renaissance and Italian Styles of Architecture in Great Britain, their Introduction and Development shown by a Series of Dated Examples'', London, 1883.

The brothers applied together in architectural competitions: for [[Newhaven Wharf railway station]] (1847), and [[Cambridge Guildhall]] (1859).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harper|first=Roger H.|title=Victorian Architectural Competitions: An Index to British and Irish Architectural Competitions in The Builder, 1843-1900|year=1983|publisher=Mansell|isbn=9780720116854|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early essay by Papworth on ''The Peculiar Characteristics of the Palladian School of Architecture'' was in 1849 awarded the silver medal of the [[Institute of British Architects]].&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the Institute'', vol. i. 3rd ser. p. 631&lt;/ref&gt; Among papers he contributed to the ''Transactions of the Royal Institute of British Architects'' were:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;
