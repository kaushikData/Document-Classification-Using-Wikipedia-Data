'''Adriaan Koerbagh''' (1633 – 1669) was a Dutch scholar and writer who was a critic of religion and conventional morality.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Mertens via W. van Bunge (2011) "Introduction", in: M. Wielema "''Adriaan Koerbagh. A light shining in dark places, to illuminate the main questions of theology and religion''". Leiden: Brill, p. 1-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Adriaan Koerbagh studied at the universities of [[University of Utrecht|Utrecht]] and [[University of Leiden|Leiden]], becoming a doctor in medicine and master in [[jurisprudence]].  He was one of the most radical figures of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], rejecting and reviling the church and state as unreliable institutions and exposing theologians' and lawyers' language as vague and opaque tools to blind the people in order to maintain their own power.  Koerbagh put the authority of reason above that of dogmas and was thus seen as a true [[Freethought|freethinker]], although twentieth century notions of him as an [[anarchist]] or [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] cannot be applied with certainty.

Koerbagh described the Bible and dogmas like the [[Trinity]] and the divine nature of Christ as only the work of men.  Also, like his contemporary [[Baruch de Spinoza]], he argued that [[pantheism|God is identical with nature]] and that nothing exists outside of nature. Therefore, he argued, [[natural science]], not [[theology]], was the real theology of the world.  In his views about the [[secularization]] of the Republic of the Netherlands and the limitation of ecclesiastical powers, he argued that religion is irrational and only maintains its position through deception and violence.

He wrote in books '''t Nieuw Woorden-Boeck der Regten"'' (''The New Dictionary of Rights'', 1664), and in "''[[Een Bloemhof|Een Bloemhof van allerley lieflijkheyd]]''" (''A Flower Garden of All Sorts of Delights'', 1668), under the pseudonym Vreederijk Waarmond.  This book explained various technical terms and foreign words. The Church authorities were offended by the dictionary's articles on religious and political topics, forcing Koerbagh to flee to [[Culemborg]], a legally autonomous town in another province that would not extradite him, and then to [[Leiden]].

Adriaan Koerbagh fiercely opposed the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] in his third work, "Een Ligt schynende in duystere plaatsen, om te verligten de voornaamste saaken der Godsgeleerdtheyd en Godsdienst" (A Light Shining In Dark Places, To Shed Light On Matters Of Theology and Religion).  He went to Leiden, where he was betrayed by his printer, who knew the contents of his work, and arrested by the authorities. His brother Johannes was also arrested.

In 1668, he was found guilty of [[blasphemy]] and was sentenced to 10 years in the [[Rasphuis]] jail at Amsterdam, where he had to do forced labour, followed by exile and a 4000 [[guilder]] fine. He died a few months later in 1669 in the Rasphuis due to the pressures of prison life.  His publications were largely destroyed by the authorities of the Republic.  His brother Johannes was released because of lack of evidence against him, but he never published again. He died three years later, in 1672.

Koerbagh's story shows that the tolerance of the Dutch Republic, however great compared with almost every other country in the world at the time, was certainly not unlimited.

In the [[Catholic Church]], an '''apostolic visitor''' (or ''Apostolic Visitator'') is a [[papal]] representative with a transient mission to perform a [[canonical visitation]] of relatively short duration.  The visitor is deputed to investigate a special circumstance in a [[diocese]] or country, and to submit a report to the [[Holy See]] at the conclusion of the investigation.

== History ==
Apostolic visitors are church officials whom canonists commonly class with [[papal legate]]s. Visitors differ from other [[Apostolic delegate]]s, principally in this, that their mission is only transient and of comparatively short duration.

In ancient times, the popes generally exercised their right of inspecting the dioceses of various countries through their [[nuncio]]s or delegates (c. 1, Extravag. Comm. de Consuet. I, 1; c. 17, X, de Cens. III, 39), though they occasionally, even in the primitive ages, sent special visitors.

In the modern time, the mission of [[papal nuncio]]s is rather of a diplomatic than of a visitatorial character. Visitors are, however, deputed by the pope for special emergencies and not at stated intervals. Their duty is to inspect the state of the Church in the country confided to them and then to draw up a report to the Holy See. At times, this visitation is made with the same attention to details as is an episcopal visitation.

== Regular clergy ==
Visitors Apostolic are also appointed to visit the various provinces of a religious order, whenever, in the judgment of the pope, this becomes useful or necessary. In all cases of Apostolic visitation, the pope, through delegates, is putting into effect the supreme and immediate jurisdiction which is his for any and every part of the Church. The exact powers of a visitor can be known only from his brief of delegation. His office ceases as soon as he has submitted his report to the Holy See through the [[Consistorial Congregation]].

== The Commission of the Apostolic Visitation ==
For the city of [[Rome]] itself there is a ''permanent'' Commission of the Apostolic Visitation. Established by [[Urban VIII]] as one of the [[Roman congregation]]s under the presidency of the [[cardinal vicar]], it was changed into a commission by [[Pope Pius X]] through the Constitution "[[Sapienti Consilio]]" (29 June 1908). These Apostolic visitors annually inspect the parishes and institutions of Rome and report on their spiritual and financial condition. They pay special attention to the fulfilment of the obligations springing from pious foundations and legacies for Masses and chaplaincies.

== Eastern Catholic Apostolic Visitors ==
In [[Eastern Catholic]] (non-Latin) churches, the office of apostolic visitor can be indefinite and the closest thing to an ordinary for communities in regions which have not (yet) been organized into any ordinary jurisdiction. Although there is a history of apostolic visitors in the [[Belarusian Greek Catholic Church]], Eastern Catholic apostolic visitors are generally found in the major Eastern Catholic churches.

=== Apostolic Visitors in the Belarusian Greek Catholic Church ===
Because the [[Belarusian Greek Catholic Church]] ([[Byzantine Rite]]) remains unorganized in terms of structural polity, with no proper jurisdictions of its own erected, since 1960 the Pope has entrusted the pastoral care of Belarusian Greek Catholics to a series of Apostolic Visitors. These apostolic visitors have thus served as the only hierarchs of the Belarusian Greek Catholic Church during this time period.
* Bishop [[Ceslaus Sipovich]] served as Apostolic Visitor for the Belarusian Greek-Catholic faithful abroad (outside of Belarus) from 1960 until his death in 1981.
* Bishop [[Uladzimir Tarasevich]] served as Apostolic Visitor for the Belarusian Greek-Catholic faithful abroad from 1983 until his death in 1986.
* Father [[Alexander Nadson]] served as Apostolic Visitor for the Belarusian Greek-Catholic faithful abroad from 1986 until his death in 2015.
* '''Father [[Sergiusz Gajek]]''' has served as Apostolic Visitor for the Belarusian Greek-Catholic faithful in Belarus since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/rite-Bl.htm "Belarussian Church (Catholic)"] ''GCatholic.org''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Apostolic Visitors in the Major Eastern Catholic Churches ===
In recent years, nearly all of the Patriarchal and Major Archiepiscopal Eastern Catholic churches (except the [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic]]) have made use of apostolic visitors, mostly in Europe and the Americas. This has sometimes served as a prelude to the creation of an [[apostolic exarchate]] or an [[eparchy]]. The apostolic visitors are almost always bishops, but only a few of them have a full-time mandate as apostolic visitors. Most of them perform their visitation in addition to some other more primary ecclesiastical role, whether as a residential bishop, an auxiliary bishop, a curial bishop, or their particular church's procurator at Rome.

==== Syro-Malankara Catholic Church ====
The [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]] has had a number of apostolic visitors over the last few decades, three of whom served as apostolic visitors for two different regions simultaneously. Partly due to the canonical erection of several new eparchies and apostolic exarchates, however, there are currently no Syro-Malankara apostolic visitors at present:
* Bishop [[Baselios Cleemis|Isaac Mar Cleemis]] (Auxiliary Bishop of [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Major Archeparchy of Trivandrum|Trivandrum]], 2001–2003), Apostolic Visitor in North America ''and'' Apostolic Visitor in Europe, 18 June 2001 – 11 September 2003 &lt;ref group=note&gt;Isaac Mar Cleemis was appointed [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Archeparchy of Tiruvalla|Bishop of Tiruvalla]] on September 11, 2003, and later became the first Metropolitan Archbishop of Tiruvalla before being elected Major Archbishop of Trivandrum in 2007, at which point he took the name Baselios Cleemis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/triv0.htm#3363 Cardinal Baselios Cleemis Thottunkal]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox First Anglo-Sikh War}}

The '''Battle of Aliwal''' was fought on 28 January 1846 between the British and the Sikhs. The British were led by Sir [[Sir Harry Smith, 1st Baronet|Harry Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Sir Harry. ‘’The Autobiography of Lieutenant-General Sir Harry Smith Baronet of Aliwal on the Sutlej.’’ Publisher: JOHN MURRAY,  ALBEMARLE STREET 1903 [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57094/57094-h/57094-h.htm] &lt;/ref&gt; while the Sikhs were led by [[Ranjodh Singh Majithia]]. Britain's victory in the battle is sometimes regarded as the turning point in the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]].

==Background==
The First Anglo-Sikh War began six years after the death of [[Ranjit Singh]], who had established the [[Sikh Empire]] in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. The Punjab became increasingly disordered, while the British increased their military forces on their border with the Punjab. Eventually, the increasingly turbulent [[Sikh Khalsa Army]] was goaded into crossing the [[Sutlej River]] and invading British territory, under leaders who were distrustful of their own troops.

On 21 December and 22 December 1845, the army of the [[British East India Company]] commanded by Sir [[Hugh Gough, 1st Viscount Gough|Hugh Gough]] and the Governor-General of Bengal, Sir [[Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge|Henry Hardinge]], fought the bloody [[Battle of Ferozeshah]]. The Sikh armies under [[Vizier]] Lal Singh and Commander in Chief Tej Singh eventually retreated, but the British army was shaken by its heavy losses. They did not renew hostilities for some weeks, and Hardinge sought to relieve Gough of his command, blaming his tactics for the heavy casualties.

The Sikhs too were temporarily disheartened by the retreats ordered by their commanders. However, they were reinforced by troops who had not yet seen action and moved back across the Sutlej to occupy a bridgehead at Sobraon, while a detachment under Ranjodh Singh Majithia (sometimes transcribed as '''Runjoor Singh'''), with 7,000 men and 20 guns, crossed higher up the Sutlej to besiege the British-held fortress of [[Ludhiana]] and menace Gough's and Hardinge's supply lines. The British commanders detached a division under Sir Harry Smith to clear this threat to their rear.

==Campaign==
On 16 January 1846, Smith recovered two outposts which the Sikhs had seized at [[Fatehgarh Sahib|Fategarh]] and [[Dharamkot, Moga|Dharmkot]]. Although Runjodh Singh's irregular cavalry had raided over a wide area and set fire to part of the British cantonments at Ludhiana, his main body was advancing only slowly on Ludhiana.

Harry Smith first intended to attack Runjodh Singh's army at [[Buddowal]]. However, on learning of the Sikh strength, and receiving further orders from Gough, he instead force-marched his troops via [[Jagraon]], collecting a British regiment there, to reach Ludhiana ahead of the Sikh main body. On 21 January, as he left Buddowal, the Sikh irregular cavalry (the ''Gorchurras'') continually attacked his rearguards. They captured most of Smith's baggage animals (mules, bullocks and elephants), and cut down any straggling troops. Nevertheless, Smith succeeded in reaching Ludhiana, with his troops exhausted. A brigade of troops from [[Delhi]], including two [[Gurkha]] battalions, reinforced him.

After resting his troops, Smith once again advanced to Buddowal. The Sikhs had withdrawn to [[Aliwal, Taran Taran|Aliwal]] on the Sutlej, awaiting reinforcements. On 28 January, Smith advanced against them, cautiously at first.

==Battle==
The Sikhs had occupied a position {{convert|4|mi|km}} long, which ran along a ridge between the villages of Aliwal, on the Sutlej, and Bhundri. The Sutlej ran close to their rear for the entire length of their line, making it difficult for them to manoeuvre and also potentially disastrous if they were forced to retreat.

After the initial artillery salvoes, Smith determined that Aliwal was the Sikh weak point. He sent two of his four infantry brigades to capture the village, from where they could enfilade the Sikh centre. They seized the village, and began pressing forwards to threaten the fords across the Sutlej.

As the Sikhs tried to swing back their left, pivoting on Bhundri, some of their cavalry tried to threaten the open British left flank. A British and Indian cavalry brigade, led by the [[16th The Queen's Lancers|16th Lancers]], charged and dispersed them. The 16th Lancers then attacked a large body of Sikh infantry. These were battalions organised and trained in contemporary European fashion by [[Naples|Neapolitan]] [[mercenary]], [[Paolo Di Avitabile]]. They formed square to receive cavalry, as most European armies did. Nevertheless, the 16th Lancers broke them, with heavy casualties.

The infantry in the Sikh centre tried to defend a ''[[nullah]]'' (dry stream bed), but were enfiladed and forced into the open by a Bengal infantry regiment, and then cut down by fire from Smith's batteries of Bengal Horse Artillery.

Unlike most of the battles of both Anglo-Sikh Wars, when the Sikhs at Aliwal began to retreat, the retreat quickly turned into a disorderly rout across the fords. Most of the Sikh guns were abandoned, either on the river bank or in the fords, along with all baggage, tents and supplies. They lost 2,000 men and 67 guns.

==Aftermath==
Smith wrote afterwards:
{{cquote|I have gained one of the most glorious battles ever fought in India ... Never was victory more complete, and never was one fought under more happy circumstances, literally with the pomp of a field day; and right well did all behave.}}

Many commentators referred to Smith's victory as the "Battle without a mistake".&lt;ref name=Perrett104/&gt; Except for the 16th Lancers, who lost 144 men out of about 300, few of Smith's units had heavy casualties.

==Excavations==
The Beth Alpha synagogue was uncovered in 1928 by members of the nearby [[Kibbutz]] [[Hefzibah]], who stumbled upon the synagogue's extensive mosaic floors during irrigation construction.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 190" /&gt; Excavations began in 1929 under the auspices of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and were led by Israeli archaeologist, [[Eleazar Sukenik]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 190"/&gt; A secondary round of excavations, sponsored by the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] in 1962, further explored the residential structures surrounding the synagogue.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 190" /&gt;

In addition, a [[hoard]] of 36 Byzantine coins were found in a shallow depression in the floor [[apse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Winter |first1=Dave |last2=Matthews |first2=John |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CxYEsYsrfGUC |title=Israel Handbook |page=646 |publisher=Footprint Travel Guides |year=1999 |isbn=1-900949-48-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
Architectural remains from the Beth Alpha synagogue indicate that the synagogue once stood as two-story basilical building and contained a courtyard, [[vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]], and prayer hall.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 190" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Jewish Art and Archaeology in Late-Antiquity'', 232–33&lt;/ref&gt; The first floor of the prayer hall consisted of a central [[nave]] measuring 5.4 meters wide, the apse, which served as the resting place for the Torah Ark, the [[bema#Judaism|bimah]], the raised platform upon which the Torah would have been read, and benches.&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 182.&lt;/ref&gt; The Torah Ark within the [[apse]] was aligned southwest, in the direction of [[Jerusalem]].

==Dedicatory inscriptions==
[[File:Beyt-Alfa-50.jpg|thumb|right|Dedicatory Inscriptions]] The northern entryway features two dedicatory inscriptions in [[Aramaic]] and Greek. Although partially destroyed, the Aramaic inscription indicates that the synagogue was built during the reign of Roman Emperor Justinus, probably [[Justin I]] (518–527 CE), and was funded by communal donations.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 192"&gt;Avigad, "Beth Alpha", ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'', 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 43–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek inscription thanks artisans "Marianos and his son Hanina", whom were also listed as the artisans of the nearby Beth Shean synagogue.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 192" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The inscriptions are flanked on either side by a lion and a buffalo, who serve as the synagogue's symbolic guardians.&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''The Ancient Synagogue of Beth Alpha'', 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nave mosaics==

===Northern panel—Binding of Isaac===
[[File:Beit alfa02.jpg|thumb|Binding of Isaac]] The northern panel depicts the "[[Binding of Isaac]]" (Genesis 22: 1–18). To the right, [[Abraham]] is depicted dangling Isaac over the fiery altar as he raises his hand to perform the sacrifice. In the center, God, symbolized by the small fire- encircled hand appearing in the upper center, instructs Abraham to sacrifice a nearby ram instead of [[Isaac]]. The [[Hand of God (art)|hand of God]] is aptly labeled with "al tishlah" or "do not raise", taken from God's command to the angel that Abraham not "raise his hand against the boy [Isaac]" (Genesis 22:12).&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology in the Land of Israel'', 288. Translation taken from the 2003 edition of the Jewish Publication Society Tanakah.&lt;/ref&gt; In the lower center of the composition, immediately below the hand of God, the ram that served as Isaac's substitute is positioned standing sideways, trapped in the nearby thicket.&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 288.&lt;/ref&gt; The odd positioning of the ram may perhaps be a convention the artists used to convey the distance that the [[Bible]] says separated Abraham and Isaac, from the two servant boys (Genesis 22:5), who accompanied Abraham and Isaac on their journey, and are depicted standing to the left. All the figures in the scene, except for the two servants, are identified with Hebrew labels.

The iconographic significance of the "Binding of Isaac" is unclear. There is a wide variety of opinions, with some scholars seeing this narrative as an affirmation of God's mercy, others as symbolic of his continuing covenant with Israel, and others as embodying the rabbinic notion of "zechut avot" or the merit of the fathers.&lt;ref&gt;For a survey of scholarly opinions see Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 287–292; Fine, ''Art and Judaism in the Greco Roman World'', 194–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporaneous Christian church art, where the "Binding of Isaac" was also a popular theme, the narrative was seen as a typological pre-figuration for the crucifixion.&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central panel—zodiac wheel===
[[File:Beit Alpha.jpg|thumb|right|Zodiac Wheel with Hebrew Labels]] The central panel features a Jewish adaptation of the Greco-Roman [[zodiac]]. The zodiac consists of two concentric circles, with the twelve zodiac signs appearing in the outer circle, and [[Helios]], the Greco-Roman sun god, appearing in the inner circle.&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The outer circle consists of twelve panels, each of which correspond to one of the twelve months of the year and contain the appropriate Greco-Roman zodiac sign. Female busts symbolizing the four seasons appear in the four corners immediately outside the zodiac.&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In the center, [[Helios]] appears with his signature Greco-Roman iconographic elements such as the fiery crown of rays adorning his head and the highly stylized [[quadriga]] or four-horse-drawn chariot.&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The background is decorated with a crescent shaped moon and stars. As in the "Binding of Isaac" panel, the zodiac symbols and seasonal busts are labeled with their corresponding Hebrew names.

This zodiac wheel, along with other similar examples found in contemporaneous synagogues throughout Israel such as [[Naaran]], [[Susiya]], [[Hamat Tiberias]], Huseifa, and [[Sepphoris]], rest at the center of a scholarly debate regarding the relationship between Judaism and general Greco-Roman culture in late-antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, ''Art and Judaism'', 199–202.&lt;/ref&gt; Some interpret the popularity that the zodiac maintains within synagogue floors as evidence for its Judaization and adaptation into the Jewish calendar and liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;For a survey of scholarly views supporting the normative role of the zodiac in Judaism see Fine, ''Art and Judaism'' 184–204 and Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 308–9. Many scholars cite the popularity that the zodiac maintains within late-antique and medieval piyyutim and manuscripts as further support for their views regarding the Judaization of the zodiac.&lt;/ref&gt; Others see it as representing the existence of a "non-Rabbinic" or a mystical and Hellenized form of Judaism that embraced the astral religion of Greco-Roman culture.&lt;ref&gt;Goodenough, Jewish Symbols in the Greco-Roman World Vol. 8—Astronomical Symbols, 167–195; Magness identifies Helios with the angel, Metatron, see Magness, "Heaven on Earth: Helios and the Zodiac Cycle in Ancient Palestinian Synagogues", 2, 30–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern panel—synagogue scene===
The southern panel, which was laid before the synagogue's Torah Shrine, is a liturgically oriented scene that emphasizes the centrality of the Torah Shrine. The Torah Shrine stands at the center of the composition and is depicted with a gabled roof. The Torah Shrine is decorated with ornamented panels featuring diamonds and squares.&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 34; Hachlili, Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology, 273.&lt;/ref&gt; The floating conch shell seen in the center of the roof, is a stylized representation of the Torah Shrine's inset arch.&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 284.&lt;/ref&gt; A hanging lamp is suspended from the gable of the roof.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 190" /&gt; As a symbolic marker of its importance, the lower register of the Torah Shrine is flanked by two roaring lions and is surrounded by Jewish ritual objects such as the [[lulav]], [[etrog]], [[shofar]], and incense shovel.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 190" /&gt; Two birds flank the gabled roof in the upper register of the Torah Shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 22. Sukenik proposes that the birds are ostriches while Hachlili proposes that the birds are peacocks.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beyt-Alfa-60.jpg|thumb|Synagogue Scene]]
Two large seven-branched [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorot]] candelabras stand on either of the Torah shrine. The base and branches of the two Menorot are not identical in form; the right-hand Menorah has an upright base, while the left-hand Menorah has two crescent shaped legs and one upright leg.&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 377.&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, the entire scene is framed by the two pulled back curtains, which served to demarcate the sacred space of the Torah Shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 34; Avigad, "Beth Alpha", ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'', 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of the Menorah, which originally stood in the [[Jerusalem Temple]], comes to highlight the continuing importance that the Jerusalem Temple occupied in the development of the synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 362.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Menorah also maintained a practical function, as the primary light source for the area around the Torah Shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, ''Art and Judaism'', 154–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Sukenik believed that the two Menorot depicted flanking the Torah Shrine in this scene, likely stood adjacent to the Torah Shrine within the actual Beth Alpha synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 362; Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Buddhism}}
[[Buddhism]] is a legally recognized religion in [[Austria]] and it is followed by more than 10,000 Austrians.
Although still small in absolute numbers (10,402 at the 2001 [[census]]), '''Buddhism in Austria''' enjoys widespread acceptance. A majority of Buddhists in the country are Austrian nationals (some of them naturalized after immigration from Asia, predominantly from the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Vietnam]]), while a considerable number of them are foreign nationals.

As in most [[Europe]]an countries, different branches and schools of Buddhism are represented by groups of varying sizes. [[Vienna]] not only has the largest number of foreign residents, but is also the place with the longest tradition of Buddhism in the country. Most of Austria's Buddhist temples and centres of practice can be found there; some with a specific Chinese, Vietnamese, [[Tibet]]an or [[Japan]]ese appearance. The latest development has been the establishment of a “Buddhist Cemetery” around a stupa-like building for funeral ceremonies at the [[Zentralfriedhof|Vienna Central Cemetery]].

Buddhism was officially recognized under Austrian law in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{aeiou|.r/r480968.htm|Religious Denominations in Austria}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russia]] is the only other "European" country to 
forwardly recognize [[Buddhism]] as "native" to its own soil, giving it official status, along with [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]], [[Islam]], and [[Judaism]].

==History==

===Early years===
By the late 19th century, due to the influence of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[Richard Wagner]], artists and intellectuals in the capital city of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] started to take interest in Buddhism. 
[[Karl Eugen Neumann]] (1865–1915), who had met the composer Wagner in his father’s house, took great interest in what he had heard about Buddhism. In 1884 he decided to become a Buddhist and study the original languages to be able 'to see for himself'. He managed to translate large parts of the [[Pali Canon]] into [[German language|German]] before dying in Vienna at the age of fifty.&lt;ref&gt;[[Volker Zotz]]: ''Auf den glückseligen Inseln. Buddhismus in der deutschen Kultur.'' Theseus, Berlin 2000, p. 90-101 ({{ISBN|3-89620-151-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913 in [[Java (island)|Java]], Arthur Fitz, a man from [[Graz]] became the first recorded Austrian to be ordained as [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]], taking the name Bhikkhu Sono.

1923 saw the foundation of a "Buddhist Society" in [[Vienna]] and [[Austria]]ns were among the participants at the 2nd International Buddhist Congress in [[Paris]] in 1937. The political situation &amp;mdash; an alliance between the [[Fascism|Fascist]] regime and the [[Catholic Church]] from 1933 to 1938 followed by Hitler’s conquest of Austria and the [[World War II|Second World War]] &amp;mdash; was highly unfavourable to the development of Austrian Buddhism.

===After World War II===
[[Image:PeacePagoda Vienna.JPG|thumb|left|220px|The Peace Pagoda, a [[stupa]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].]]

In 1949 the "Buddhist Society of Vienna" was founded and interest for Buddhism started to flourish again. Due to personalities like Fritz Hungerleider, who had returned from exile in the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1955 to become the society’s president, and Dr. Walter Karwath, who had spent years in Asia practicing medicine, Buddhism took a step out of literary and intellectual circles toward the world of daily life. The late 1970s saw the establishment of Dannebergplatz, the first Buddhist Centre in Vienna; the purchase of a rural property intended to become a retreat centre (Buddhist Centre Scheibbs); and the establishment of the first Buddhist Association outside Vienna (the Salzburg Buddhist Association). The latter was founded by Friedrich Fenzl, who had been a student at the [[Ryukoku University]] in [[Kyoto]] and who invited Kosho Otani, the Patriarch of the [[Nishi-Honganji]] branch of [[Jodo Shinshu]] to visit Austria. [[Hemaloka Thero]], [[Geshe Rabten]], the 16th [[Karmapa]], the [[14th Dalai Lama]], and other eminent representatives from different Buddhist traditions visited the country, gave talks, and attracted [[Dharma (Buddhism)|dharma]] students.

In 1979, Genro Koudela, who was ordained as a [[Zen]] priest in [[California]] by [[Kyozan Joshu Sasaki|Joshu Sasaki]], returned to Vienna, his city of origin, and established the "Bodhidharma Zendo" there. The new Buddhist Centre at Fleischmarkt, in the very centre of Vienna, became the home for Zen, [[Kagyu]] and [[Theravada]] groups.

From 1981 there is a branch of the [[Arya Maitreya Mandala]] in Austria, which was founded by [[Lama Anagarika Govinda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arya-maitreya-mandala.at Arya Maitreya Mandala in Austria]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism recognized===
[[Image:Zentralfriedhof Wien Buddhistische Sektion.jpg|thumb|200px|Buddhist Cemetery at the Vienna [[Zentralfriedhof]]]]
When official recognition was granted by the government in early 1983 a new era of Austrian Buddhism was ushered in. A widely visible ‘Peace Stupa’ was opened at the banks of the river [[Danube]] and a retreat and study centre, Letzehof, affiliated with the [[Geluk]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] was opened in the western province of [[Vorarlberg]]. Vanja Palmers, a Zen monk of the Japanese [[Sōtō]] school, and Brother [[David Steindl-Rast]], an Austrian-American [[Benedictine Order|Benedictine]] monk, founded a retreat centre high up in the [[Salzburg]] alpine region. The first centre in the south of the country, a retreat centre in the [[Myanmar|Burmese]] [[Theravada]] tradition was established in the early 1990s.

In 1993, Austria hosted an annual general meeting of the [[European Buddhist Union]], which drew participants from a dozen European countries.
A series of visits to the city of [[Graz]] by the Dalai Lama in 1995, 1998 (for the consecration of a large stupa), and in 2002 (to speak on "[[Kalachakra]] for World Peace") became a strong encouragement for Buddhists in Austria.

===Buddhist religious instruction at Austrian schools===

Official recognition also opened the doors for Buddhist religious education at [[school]]s. In 1993, the first few groups of children were given the chance to hear about the [[Buddhadharma]] on a regular basis as part of their syllabus. Twelve years after the project was started in the cities of Vienna, Graz and Salzburg, Buddhist religious education is being made available to school children of all age groups (6 to 19) at different types of schools in all of nine federal provinces of the Republic. A Teachers’ Training Academy was founded in 2001 to offer in-service teacher training for the teachers concerned.

A weekly Montreal edition in English with some French began its run in 1976.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

==History==
The ''Canadian Jewish News'' was founded by [[M. J. Nurenberger]], a friend of [[Menachem Begin]] and supporter of his [[Herut]] party, and his wife Dorothy and was first published on Friday, January 1, 1960, and was the first exclusively English-language Jewish newspaper published in [[Ontario]].&lt;ref name=CJNpost&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Connor|first=Joe|title='They really valued good journalism': For its husband and wife founders, The Canadian Jewish News was a labour of love|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/04/23/canadian-jewish-news-was-a-labour-of-love/|accessdate=April 23, 2013|newspaper=National Post|date=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Editorial|The CJN]] was considered a "provocative" paper into the 1970s but was later considered something of a "lapdog for the community".&lt;ref name="Houpt" /&gt; The original CJN hewed a line that supported the right in Israeli politics and was critical of the liberal leadership of the Canadian Jewish community at the time as well as community institutions such as [[B'nai Brith]] and the [[United Jewish Appeal]], the latter for its secrecy in how it dispersed money.&lt;ref name="rrj" /&gt; According to his daughter, Atara Beck, "He believed that a newspaper should be a thorn in the side of the establishment."&lt;ref name="Houpt"&gt;{{cite news|last=Houpt|first=Simon|title=Born in adversity, Canadian Jewish News succumbs to the Internet|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/born-in-adversity-canadian-jewish-news-succumbs-to-the-internet/article11511710/|accessdate=April 24, 2013|newspaper=Globe and Mail|date=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, following the death of his wife, Nurenberger sold the newspaper for $30,000 to a group of community leaders that included [[Shoppers Drug Mart]] founder [[Murray Koffler]] and real estate developer [[Albert Latner]] and was led by philanthropist and businessman Ray Wolfe.&lt;ref name="rrj"&gt;[http://www.rrj.ca/m3486/ "Drawing the line: There are many subjects writers can discuss in The Canadian Jewish News. Criticizing the security policies of the Israeli government is not one of them"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030614/http://rrj.ca/m3486/ |date=2016-03-04 }}, ''Ryerson Review of Journalism'', Spring 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="closure" /&gt; Though independent, the newspaper has been owned, since 1971, by a group of Jewish leaders allied with what was then the [[Canadian Jewish Congress]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name=jta&gt;{{cite news|last= Csillag|first= Ron|url= http://www.jta.org/news/article/2013/04/22/3124826/canadian-jewish-news-to-halt-publication |title= Canadian Jewish News to halt publication|agency= [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]|date= April 22, 2013|accessdate= December 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nurenburger soon regretted his decision, discouraged by the new version of the paper's reticence to challenge the community's establishment, and started the ''Jewish Times'' in 1974, which was decidedly more right wing than CJN under its new management, and continued publication into the early 1990s. In 1979, it adopted editorial guidelines that prevent articles from criticizing the state of Israel's security policies.&lt;ref name="rrj" /&gt;

By 2013, the CJN had a circulation of 40,000 copies per week.&lt;ref name="globe" /&gt;

===Suspension===
On April 22, 2013, the newspaper issued termination notices to its 50 staff and announced that it will cease printing with its June 20 edition due to financial constraints. The publishers sought benefactors to provide funding that would allow the CJN to continue as an exclusively online publication less reliant on advertising.&lt;ref name="globe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="closure"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjnews.com/index.php?q=node/105918|title=The CJN to close &amp;#124; The Canadian Jewish News|publisher=cjnews.com|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalpost.com/m/wp/news/canada/blog.html?b=news.nationalpost.com/2013/04/22/cjn "The Canadian Jewish News is shutting down, citing changes ‘sweeping’ newspaper industry"], ''National Post'', April 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resumption of publication ===
On June 14, 2013, the CJN's board announced that it would resume publication of its print edition in August 2013 after moving to smaller offices and pending the results of a subscription and advertising drive and various changes to the newspaper's business model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=We will do it. Please join us!|url=http://www.cjnews.com/news/we-will-do-it-please-join-us|accessdate=June 14, 2013|newspaper=Canadian Jewish News|date=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among others, editor Mordechai Ben-Dat and senior staffer and columnist Sheldon Kirshner were let go.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Wolfe, "Call to Action," Canadian Jewish News, Aug. 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The newspaper was subsequently reorganized under new leadership, beginning in January 2014, with Elizabeth Wolfe, daughter of Ray Wolfe, becoming president and former ''[[Jerusalem Report]]'', ''[[National Post]]'' and ''[[Macleans]]'' journalist Yoni Goldstein becoming the newspaper's editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CJN selects new president, names editor|url=http://www.cjnews.com/news/cjn-selects-new-president-names-editor|accessdate=December 22, 2013|newspaper=Canadian Jewish News|date=December 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein subsequently introduced a more diverse range of contributors to the newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canadas-jewish-community-divided-over-which-party-should-be-elected/article26854943/|title = Canada's Jewish community divided over which party should be elected|last = Martin|first = Patrick|date = 16 October 2015|work = The Globe and Mail|access-date = 19 October 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The content of the newly revamped paper was described as "racier".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title = How Canada's Last Jewish Newspaper Came Back From the Brink|url = http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/news/.premium-1.702163|newspaper = Haaretz|date = 2016-02-08|access-date = 2016-02-08|language = en|first = Judy|last = Maltz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2016, the newspaper's subscriptions remained mostly unchanged at 31,000, but Wolfe reported advertising and subscription revenues were enough to invest in new projects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Contributors ==
Notable contributors to the newspaper have included [[Jacob Elbaz]], [[J. B. Salsberg]], who was a featured columnist in the newspaper for several decades until shortly before his death in 1998, and Rabbi [[Gunther Plaut]], who also contributed a weekly column for many years.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The main Toronto edition of the CJN had a rotating group of guest columnists: among them were academics Norma Baumel Joseph and Norman Ravvin of Concordia University; Sarah Horowitz of York; [[Gil Troy]] of McGill; [[Gerald Steinberg]] of [[Bar-Ilan University]], as well as Jean Gerber in Vancouver, and Rabbi Dow Marmur and Avrum Rosensweig in Toronto. (The Montreal edition featured some others.){{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

'''Chaitanya Mahaprabhu''' (also transliterated {{IAST|Caitanya Mahāprabhu}}) (18 February 1486 –  14 June 1534), formally known as '''Shri Krishna Chaitanya''' ({{IAST|Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya}}) was a [[Hindu]] [[Mysticism|mystic]], [[saint]], and the chief proponent of the [[Achintya Bheda Abheda]] and [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]] tradition within [[Hinduism]]. He also expounded the [[Vaishnava]] school of [[Bhakti yoga]] (meaning loving devotion to God), based on ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' and ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/introduction/en1 Srimad Bhagavatam (Introduction)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525203633/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/introduction/en1 |date=25 May 2013 }} "Lord Caitanya not only preached the Srimad-Bhagavatam but propagated the teachings of the [[Bhagavad Gita]] as well in the most practical way."&lt;/ref&gt; Of various forms and direct or indirect expansions of Krishna such as Lord [[Narasimha]] (Krishna in mood of anger),  Maha-Vishnu and Garbhodakshaya Vishnu respectively, he is Krishna in the mood of a devotee. He  popularised the chanting of the ''[[Hare Krishna (mantra)|Hare Krishna]]'' [[mantra]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scsmath.com/docs/chaitanya_mahaprabhu.html Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu] "He spread the [[Yuga Dharma|Yuga-dharma]] as the practice for attainment of pure love for [[Radha]]-[[Krishna]]. That process is Harinam-Sankirtan, or the congregational chanting of the Holy Names of Krishna "Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare"&lt;/ref&gt; and composed the ''[[Siksastaka]]m'' (eight devotional prayers) in [[Sanskrit]]. His followers, [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]]s, revere him as a Krishna with the mood and complexion of his source of inspiration Radha.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin E. Zeller (2010), Prophets and Protons, New York University Press, {{ISBN|978-0814797211}}, pages 77-79&lt;/ref&gt; His birthday is celebrated as [[Gaura-purnima]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krishna.com/node/1407|title=Gaura Purnima |publisher=www.krishna.com|accessdate=2008-12-16|last=|first=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaitanya is sometimes referred to by the names ''Gauranga'' or ''Gaura'' due to his fair complexion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/Mar122006/finearts1054102006310.asp In the Name of the Lord (Deccan Herald)] "He was also given the name of ‘Gora’ because of his extremely fair complexion." {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207225342/http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/Mar122006/finearts1054102006310.asp |date=7 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Nimai''' due to his being born underneath a [[Neem]] tree.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/Krishna-Chaitanya-Mission KCM Archive] "They named Him Nimai, as he was born under a neem tree." {{dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ganga mata math.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|Idol of shadabhuja gauranga at ganga mata math in [[puri]].]]
Chaitanya (Sanskrit: चैतन्य) means '"consciousness"; Maha means "Great" and Prabhu means "Lord" or "Master".

Chaitanya was born as the second son of Jagannath Mishra and his wife Sachi Devi. Jagannath's family lived in the town of Dhaka Dakkhin, [[Sylhet|Srihatta]], now [[Sylhet]], [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lordcaitanya.com/prologue/en1 Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu: His Life and Precepts, by Bhaktivinoda Thakura] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517215040/http://lordcaitanya.com/prologue/en1 |date=17 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nair, p. 87"&gt;[[#na|Nair, p. 87]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Chaitanya Charitamruta'', Chaitanya was born on the full moon night of 18 February 1486, at the time of a lunar eclipse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lordcaitanya.com/prologue/en1 Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu: His Life and Precepts, by Bhaktivinoda Thakura] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517215040/http://lordcaitanya.com/prologue/en1 |date=17 May 2014 }} "Chaitanya Mahäprabhu appeared in [[Nabadwip]] in Bengal just after sunset on the evening of the 23rd Phälguna 1407 Shakabda, answering to 18 February 1486, of the Christian Era. The moon was eclipsed at the time of His 'birth'"&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, Chaitanya is also believed to born in [[Mayapur]]. Mayapur is located on the banks of the [[Ganges]] river, at the point of its confluence with the [[Jalangi River|Jalangi]], near [[Navadvip|Nabadwip]], [[West Bengal]], [[India]], 130&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Kolkata]] ([[Calcutta]]). Mayapur is considered a holy place by a number of other traditions within [[Hinduism]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

A number of stories also exist telling of Chaitanya's apparent attraction to the [[Japa|chanting]] and [[Bhajan|singing]] of Krishna's names from a very young age,&lt;ref&gt;[http://vedabase.net/cc/adi/14/22/en1 CC Adi lila 14.22] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306060122/http://vedabase.net/cc/adi/14/22/en1 |date=6 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but largely this was perceived as being secondary to his interest in acquiring knowledge and studying [[Sanskrit]]. When travelling to [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] to perform the [[Śrāddha|shraddha]] ceremony for his departed father, Chaitanya met his [[guru]], the ascetic [[Isvara Puri|Ishvara Puri]], from whom he received initiation with the [[Gopala|Gopala Krishna]] mantra. This meeting was to mark a significant change in Chaitanya's outlook&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vedabase.net/cc/adi/17/9/en1 CC Adi lila 17.9] "In Gayla, Sri Chaitanya Mähaprabhu was initiated by Isvara Puri, and immediately afterwards He exhibited signs of love of Godhead. He again displayed such symptoms after returning home."&lt;/ref&gt; and upon his return to Bengal the local Vaishnavas, headed by [[Advaita Acharya]], were stunned at his external sudden 'change of heart' (from 'scholar' to 'devotee') and soon Chaitanya became the eminent leader of their Vaishnava group within Nadia.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

After leaving Bengal and receiving entrance into the [[sannyasa]] order by [[Kesava Bharati|Keshava Bharati]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vedabase.net/tlc/17/en1 Teachings of Lord Chaitanya] "They were surprised to see Lord Chaitanya after He accepted his sannyasa order from Kesava Bharati"&lt;/ref&gt; Chaitanya journeyed throughout the length and breadth of [[India]] for several years, chanting the divine Names of Krishna constantly. At that time He travelled on foot  covering a lot of place like Baranagar, Mahinagar, Atisara at last [[Chhatrabhog]].  Chhatrabhog is the place where Goddess Ganga and Lord Shiva met, then hundred mouths of Ganga was visible from here. From the source of Vrindaban Das's Chaitanya Bhagavat  He bathed at Ambulinga Ghat of Chhatrabhog with intimate companions with great chorus chanting(kirtan).After staying one night He set for Puri by boat with the help of Local Administrator Ram Chandra Khan. He spent the last 24 years of his life in [[Puri (city)|Puri]], Odisha,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaudiya.com/index.php?topic=history History of Gaudiya Vaishnavism]. The first 6 years, he traveled extensively from Rameshavara in South India to Vrindavan in North India, sharing the message of bhakti.  He is also said to have achieved major intellectual successes in converting intellectual giants of his times such as Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya and Prakashananda Saraswati to his devotional understanding of Vedanta. "Chaitanya spent the remainder of His life, another 24 years, in Jagannäth Puri in the company of some of His intimate associates, such as Svarüpa Dämodara and Rämänanda Räya"&lt;/ref&gt; the great temple city of [[Jagannath]] in the [[Radhakanta Math]]. The [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati]] king, [[Prataprudra Dev]], regarded Chaitanya as Krishna's avatar and was an enthusiastic patron and devotee of Chaitanya's [[sankirtan|sankeertan]] gatherings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/hindu/devot/gauvai.html Gaudiya Vaishnavas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302041337/http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/hindu/devot/gauvai.html |date=2 March 2009 }} "His magnetism attracted men of great learning such as Särvabhauma Bhattächärya, the greatest authority on logic, and Shree Advaita Ächärya, leader of the Vaishnavas in Bengal, and men of power and wealth like the King of Odisha, Pratap Rudra and his minister, Rämänanda Räya..."&lt;/ref&gt; It was during these years that Chaitanya is believed by his followers to have sunk deep into various Divine-Love ([[samādhi]]) and performed pastimes of [[Religious ecstasy|divine ecstasy]] ([[bhakti]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/introduction/en1 Srimad Bhagavatam, Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525203633/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/introduction/en1 |date=25 May 2013 }} "At Puridhawm, when he [Chaitanya] entered the temple of Jagannätha, he became at once saturated with transcendental ecstasy"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vrindavan]], the land of Radha Rani, the “City of Temples” has more than 5000 temples to showcase the pastimes of Radha and Krishna, including temples as old as 5500 years. The essence of Vrindavan was lost over time until the 16th century, when it was rediscovered by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. In the year 1515, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu visited Vrindavana, with the purpose of locating the lost holy places associated with Lord Sri Krishna’s transcendent pastimes. He wandered through the different sacred forests of Vrindavana in a spiritual trance of divine love. It was believed that by His divine spiritual power, he was able to locate all the important places of Krishna’s pastimes in and around Vrindavan including the seven main temples or sapta devalay, which are worshiped by Vaishnavas in the Chaitanya tradition to this day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/introduction/en1 Srimad Bhagavatam (Introduction)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525203633/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/introduction/en1 |date=25 May 2013 }} "Lord Caitanya not only preached the Srimad-Bhagavatam but propagated the teachings of the [[Bhagavad Gita]] as well in the most practical way."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886 a leading [[Gaudiya Vaisnava]] reformer [[Bhaktivinoda Thakur]] attempted to retire from his government service and move to [[Vrindavan]] to pursue his devotional life there.{{sfn|Dasa|1999|pp=100-101}} However, he saw a dream in which Chaitanya ordered him to go to [[Nabadwip]] instead.{{sfn|Dasa|1999|p=101}}  After some difficulty, in 1887 Bhaktivinoda was transferred to [[Krishnanagar, Nadia|Krishnanagar]], a district center twenty-five kilometers away from Nabadwip, famous as the birthplace of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.{{sfn|Dasa|1999|pp=102-103}} Despite poor health, Bhaktivinoda finally managed to start regularly visiting Nabadwip to research places connected with Chaitanya.{{sfn|Dasa|1999|pp=103-105}} Soon he came to a conclusion that the site purported by the local ''brahmanas'' to be Chaitanya's birthplace could not possibly be genuine.{{sfn|Dasa|1999|p=104}} Determined to find the actual place of Chaitanya's pastimes but frustrated by the lack of reliable evidence and clues, one night he saw a mystical vision:{{sfn|Fuller|2005|p=209}}

{{quote|By 10 o'clock the night was very dark and cloudy. Across the Ganges in a northern direction I suddenly saw a large building flooded with golden light. I asked Kamala if he could see the building and he said that he could. But my friend Kerani Babu could see nothing. I was amazed. What could it be? In the morning I went back to the roof and looked carefully back across the Ganges. I saw that in the place where I had seen the building was a stand of palm trees. Inquiring about this area I was told that it was the remains of Lakshman Sen's fort at Ballaldighi.{{sfn|Dasa|1999|p=104}}}}

Taking this as a clue, Bhaktivinoda conducted a thorough, painstaking investigation of the site, by consulting old geographical maps matched against scriptural and verbal accounts, and eventually came to a conclusion that the village of Ballaldighi was formerly known as Mayapur, confirmed in ''[[Bhakti-ratnakara]]'' as the actual birth site of Chaitanya.{{sfn|Dasa|1999|p=105}} He soon acquired a property in Surabhi-kunj near Mayapur to oversee the temple construction at Yogapith, Chaitanya's birthplace.{{sfn|Dasa|1999|p=108}} For this purpose he organized, via ''Sajjana-tosani'' and special festivals, as well as personal acquaintances, a massive and hugely successful fundraising effort among the people of Bengal and beyond.{{sfn|Fuller|2005|pp=243-250}} Noted Bengali journalist [[Sisir Kumar Ghosh]] (1840-1911) commended Bhaktivinoda for the discovery and hailed him as "the seventh goswami" – a reference to the [[Six Goswamis of Vrindavana|Six Goswamis]], renowned medieval Gaudiya Vaisnava [[asceticism|ascetics]] and close associates of Chaitanya who had authored many of the school's texts and discovered places of Krishna's pastimes in Vrindavan.{{sfn|Dasa|1999|pp=106-107}}

== Biographies ==
There are numerous biographies available from the time giving details of Chaitanya's life, the most prominent ones being the ''[[Chaitanya Charitamrita]]'' of [[Krishnadasa Kaviraja]], the earlier ''[[Chaitanya Bhagavata]]'' of [[Vrindavana Dasa]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaudiya.com/index.php?topic=literature Gaudiya Literature]&lt;/ref&gt; (both originally written in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] but now widely available in English and other languages), and the ''[[Chaitanya Mangala]]'', written by "Lochana Dasa".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salagram.net/parishad39.htm Biography of Sri Locana Dasa Thakura] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613224024/http://www.salagram.net/parishad39.htm |date=13 June 2013 }} (salagram.net)&lt;/ref&gt; These works are in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] with some Sanskrit verses interspersed. In addition to these there are other Sanskrit [[biographies]] composed by his contemporaries. Chief among them are the works, ''Sri Chaitanya Charitamritam Mahakavyam'' by Kavi Karnapura and ''Sri Krishna Chaitanya Charitamritam'' by Murari Gupta.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Identity==
According to the hagiographies of 16th-century authors, he exhibited his [[Vishvarupa|Universal Form]] identical to that of [[Krishna]] on a number of occasions, notably to [[Advaita Ācārya]] and [[Nityānanda Prabhu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://vedabase.com/en/cc/adi/17/10/ CC ''Adi-lila'' 17.10]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaitanya Bhagavata ''Ādi-khaṇḍa'' 1.122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaitanya Bhagavata, ''Madhya-khaṇḍa'' 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaudiya Vaishnavas consider Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to be Lord Krishna himself, but appearing in covered form (channa avatar). The Gaudiya Vaishnava acharya Bhaktivinoda Thakura have also found out the rare manuscript of Chaitanya Upanishad of the atharvaveda section, which reveals the identity of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has left one written record in Sanskrit called [[Siksastakam]] (though, in [[Vaishnava Padavali]] it is said: "Chaitanya himself wrote many songs on the Radha-Krishna theme"). Chaitanya's epistemological, theological and ontological teachings are summarised as ten roots or maxims (dasa mula).&lt;ref&gt;Thakura, B. (1993). Jaiva dharma: The universal religion (K. Das, Trans.). Los Angeles, CA: Krishna Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; The statements of amnaya (scripture) are the chief proof. By these statements the following ten topics are taught.

# Krishna is the Supreme Absolute Truth.
# Krishna is endowed with all energies.
# Krishna is the source of all [[rasa (theology)|rasa]]- flavor, quality, or spiritual rapture/emotions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iskconbangalore.org/blog/lord-chaitanya-in-the-scriptures/&lt;/ref&gt;
# The [[jiva]]s (individual souls) are all separated parts of the Lord.
# In bound state the jivas are under the influence of matter, due to their [[tatastha]] nature.
# In the liberated state the jivas are free from the influence of matter, due to their [[tatastha]] nature.
# The jivas and the material world are both different from and identical to the Lord.
# Pure devotion is the practice of the jivas.
# Pure love of Krishna is the ultimate goal.
# Krishna is the only lovable blessing to be received.

==Philosophy and Tradition==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2015}}
Despite having been [[initiation|initiated]] in the [[Madhvacharya]] tradition and taking sannyasa from [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]]'s tradition, Chaitanya's philosophy is sometimes regarded as a tradition of his own within the [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava framework]] – having some marked differences with the practices and the [[theology]] of other followers of Madhvacharya. He took Mantra Upadesa from Isvara Puri and Sanyasa Diksha from Keshava Bharati.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Chaitanya is not known to have written anything himself except for a series of verses known as the ''[[Siksastaka]]'', or "eight verses of instruction",&lt;ref&gt;[http://lordcaitanya.com/mission/en1 TLC: Lord Chaitanya's Mission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203073845/http://lordcaitanya.com/mission/en1 |date=3 February 2014 }} "Although Lord Caitanya was widely renowned as a scholar in His youth, He left only eight verses, called Sikshashtaka"&lt;/ref&gt; which he had spoken, and were recorded by one of his close colleagues. The eight verses created by Chaitanya are considered to contain the complete philosophy of Gaudiya Vaishnavism in condensed form. Chaitanya requested a select few among his followers (who later came to be known as the [[Six Gosvamis of Vrindavan]]) to systematically present the theology of bhakti he had taught to them in their own writings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaudiya.com/index.php?topic=history History of Gaudiya Vaishnavism] "He requested ... the Six Goswamis of Vrindavan, to systematically present ... the theology of bhakti he had taught"&lt;/ref&gt; The six saints and theologians were [[Rupa Goswami]], [[Sanatana Goswami]], [[Gopala Bhatta Goswami]], [[Raghunatha Bhatta Goswami]], [[Raghunatha dasa Goswami]] and [[Jiva Goswami]], a nephew of brothers Rupa and Sanatana. These individuals were responsible for systematising Gaudiya Vaishnava theology.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[Narottama Dasa]], Srinivasa Acarya and Syamananda Pandit were among the stalwarts of the second generation of Gaudiya Vaishnavism. Having studied under Jiva Goswami, they were instrumental in propagating the teachings of the Goswamis throughout Bengal, [[Odisha]] and other regions of Eastern India. Many among their associates, such as Ramacandra Kaviraja and Ganga Narayan Chakravarti, were also eminent teachers in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dharmakshetra.com/sages/Saints/lilas%20of%20narotamma%20das.html Narottama Dasa Thakur: Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510120845/http://www.dharmakshetra.com/sages/Saints/lilas%20of%20narotamma%20das.html |date=10 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 17th century Kalachand Vidyalankar, a disciple of Chaitanya, made his preachings popular in Bengal. He traveled throughout India popularizing the gospel of anti-untouchability, social justice and mass education. He probably initiated 'Pankti Bhojon' and Krishna sankirtan in eastern part of Bengal. Several schools (sampradaya) have been practicing it for hundreds of years. Geetashree Chabi Bandyopadhyay and Radharani Devi are among many who achieved fame by singing kirtan. The Dalits in Bengal at that time neglected and underprivileged cast readily accepted his libertarian outlook and embraced the doctrine of Mahaprabhu. His disciples were known as Kalachandi Sampraday who inspired the people to eradicate illiteracy and casteism. Many consider Kalachand as the Father of Rationalism in East Bengal (Purba Banga).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The festival of Kheturi, presided over by Jahnava Thakurani,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iskcon.net/nityananda/nitaibio4.htm Festival of Kheturi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122094841/http://www.iskcon.net/nityananda/nitaibio4.htm |date=22 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the wife of [[Nityananda]], was the first time the leaders of the various branches of Chaitanya's followers assembled together. Through such festivals, members of the loosely organised tradition became acquainted with other branches along with their respective theological and practical nuances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaudiya.com/pdf/Charismatic_Renewal_in_Gaudiya_Vaishnavism.pdf Charismatic Renewal in Gaudiya Vaishnavism] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; Around these times, the disciples and descendants of Nityananda and [[Advaita Acharya]], headed by Virabhadra and Krishna respectively, started their family lineages (vamsa) to maintain the tradition. The vamsa descending from Nityananda through his son Virabhadra forms the most prominent branch of the modern Gaudiya tradition, though descendants of Advaita, along with the descendants of many other associates of Chaitanya, maintain their following especially in the rural areas of Bengal. Gopala Guru Goswami, a young associate of Chaitanya and a follower of Vakresvara Pandit, founded another branch based in Odisha. The writings of Gopala, along with those of his disciple Dhyanacandra Goswami, have had a substantial influence on the methods of internal worship in the tradition.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

From the very beginning of Chaitanya's ''[[bhakti]]'' movement in Bengal, [[Haridasa Thakur]] and others Muslim or [[Hindu]] by birth were the participants. [[Ramakrishna|Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa]], the great sage of [[Dakshineswar]], who lived in the 19th century, emphasized the bhakti marga of Chaitanya mahaprabhu, whom he referred to as "Gauranga." ([[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna]]).  This openness received a boost from [[Bhaktivinoda Thakura]]'s broad-minded vision in the late 19th century and was institutionalised by [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati]] in his [[Gaudiya Matha]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Sherbow2004&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century the teachings of Chaitanya were brought to the West by [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami|A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] (1896-1977), a representative of the Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati branch of Chaitanya's tradition. Prabhupada founded his movement known as [[The International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON) to spread Chaitanya's teachings throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krishna.com/main.php?id=551 History of the Hare Krishna Movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807225130/http://www.krishna.com/main.php?id=551 |date=7 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saraswata gurus and acharyas, members of the Goswami lineages and several other Hindu sects which revere Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, including devotees from the major Vaishnava holy places in [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] District, West Bengal and Odisha, also established temples dedicated to Krishna and Chaitanya outside India in the closing decades of the 20th century. In the 21st century Vaishnava bhakti is now also being studied through the academic medium of [[Krishnology]] in a number of academic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.did-you-mean.com/Krishnology.html Krishnology (definition)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205182516/http://www.did-you-mean.com/Krishnology.html |date=5 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural legacy==
{{See also|Bengal Renaissance}}
Chaitanya's influence on the cultural legacy in [[Bengal]] and [[Odisha]] has been significant,{{Citation needed|reason=needs a source citation|date=May 2017}} with many residents performing daily worship to him as an avatar of Krishna. Some attribute to him a Renaissance in Bengal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bengal-studies-conference.org/ Bengal Studies Conference] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217014530/http://bengal-studies-conference.org/ |date=17 December 2014 }} "History says that the Bengali people experienced the renaissance: not only once but also twice in the course of history. Bengalis witnessed the first renaissance in the 16th century when Hossain Shah and Sri Chaitanya’s idealism influenced a sect of upper literal class of people"&lt;/ref&gt; different from the more well known 19th-century [[Bengal Renaissance]]. Salimullah Khan (b. 1958), a noted Bangladeshi linguist, maintains, "Sixteenth century is the time of Chaitanya Dev, and it is the beginning of Modernism in Bengal. The concept of 'humanity' that came into fruition is contemporaneous with that of Europe".{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

'''Evangelische Omroep''' ('''EO''', English: ''Evangelical Broadcasting'') is one of the twelve member-based broadcasting associations contributing to the [[Netherlands Public Broadcasting]] system. It has as its mission to bring people into contact with [[Jesus Christ]] and its statement of faith is a form of [[Evangelicalism]]. EO is one of the few broadcasting associations in the ''[[pillarisation|pillarized]]'' Dutch broadcasting system to have remained totally faithful to its religious roots. For a long time every one of its programmes made reference to God and to the Christian religion, although this is less often the case in the 21st century.

EO was founded in 1967 by [[Christians]], mainly Free Church members who were disappointed with the other [[Protestant]] broadcasting association, [[NCRV]], for not putting more emphasis on its Christian inspiration. It is not known how effective EO has been in winning people for Christianity. A well-known effect of its work, however, has been that Christians from across the highly fragmented church scene in the Netherlands have come closer to each other. EO's activities have greatly stimulated contacts and mutual respect among Dutch [[Evangelicals]] and members of the [[Reformed]] churches.

== Controversies ==
Documentaries are often edited to reflect EO's [[creationism|creationist]] ideology. While still being presented as a [[BBC]] documentary, ''[[The Life of Mammals]]'' series was edited to remove material incompatible with [[young earth creationism]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/earth/2007/10/02/scihist102.xml Creationists rewrite natural history - Telegraph&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[profanity]] is regularly edited out of bought-in drama series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2007/07/broadcaster_defends_editing_ou.php DutchNews.nl - Broadcaster defends editing out evolution&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creationism ===
The subject of creationism has sparked a number of EO-related controversies. In early 2009, a controversy arose over statements by a leading presenter and former director, [[Andries Knevel]], that he considered it possible for a religious person not to believe in the literal interpretation of the biblical [[creation story]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1-2). Shortly afterwards Knevel apologized for the highly charged way in which he had made his statements and for the fact that his personal viewpoint could have been interpreted as the official viewpoint of EO.

=== Arie Boomsma ===
In 2009 Arie Boomsma, an EO television presenter was suspended for three months after appearing partially undressed in a magazine called ''L'Homo''. Later that year, EO planned to broadcast a new television show called ''Loopt een man over het water...'' ("A man walks over the water...") which it was intended Boomsma would present. In the show, non-Christian [[comedian]]s were to be asked to create short sketches about [[Jesus of Nazareth]]. The planned show caused so much uproar among EO members that it was cancelled. Soon afterwards Boomsma left EO and joined the Catholic broadcasting association [[Katholieke Radio Omroep|KRO]].

=== Decline in membership ===
As a result of these and other controversies, the number of subscribing EO members has declined. In March 2010, this led to a member initiative entitled ''Ik bid en blijf lid'' (''I pray and stay a member'')&lt;ref name="ibebl"&gt;[http://www.ikbidenblijflid.nl/ Ik bid en blijf lid]&lt;/ref&gt; which called upon members of EO to retain their membership and pray that the association will continue to spread God's word in a way that remains true to the [[Bible]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3060">[[Monsignor]] '''François Ducaud-Bourget''' (November 24, 1897 - June 12, 1984) was a prominent [[Traditionalist Catholic|traditionalist Roman Catholic]] [[France|French]] prelate, [[priest]] and close ally of Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]].

==French resistance==
Ducaud-Bourget was born in [[Bordeaux]].  During [[World War II]] he was active in the [[French Resistance]] as a priest, and helped Jews to escape to [[Spain under Franco|Spain]]. He was decorated by the government of [[Charles de Gaulle]] for his work.

He had been made a [[chaplain]] of the [[Order of Malta]] in 1946 and an [[Monsignor|honorary prelate]] in the time of [[Pope Pius XII]]. He was probably deprived of this title later, though public documentation is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;At latest in 1980: his name is no longer included in the renewed list published in the 1981 [[Annuario Pontificio]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ducaud-Bourget resigned his title of Chaplain in 1976, according to H. J. A. Sire, ''The Knights of Malta'', page 277 (Yale University Press, 1994). {{ISBN|978-0-300-05502-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Vatican council==
Rejecting the [[Mass of Paul VI|revision]] of the [[Roman Missal]] that followed the [[Second Vatican Council]], he organised celebration of the Latin [[Tridentine Mass]] in the chapel of the [[:fr:Hôpital Laënnec|Hôpital Laënnec]], a former hospital in [[Paris]]. When he was excluded from this in 1971, he tried in vain to obtain from the Cardinal Archbishop of Paris [[François Marty]] another place in which only the Tridentine Mass would be celebrated. When he failed in this, he organised the take-over, on 27 February 1977, of the parish church of [[Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet]], expelling the priest in charge.

When he died at [[Saint-Cloud]] in 1984, aged 86, he was buried in the church of Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet, which has a portrait bust of him over his tomb. He was succeeded in charge the church by Father [[Philippe Laguérie]], who later founded the [[Institute of the Good Shepherd]].

==In popular culture==

In his ''Le Cercle d'Ulysse'', Jean Delaude presents Ducaud-Bourget as the successor of [[Jean Cocteau]] as "Nautonnier" ([[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]]) of the [[Priory of Sion]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Jarnac, ''Les Mystères de Rennes-le-Château, Mélanges Sulfureux'' (CERT, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{chinese-name|Gan}}

'''Gan Ji''' (died 200) was a [[Taoism|Taoist]] priest who lived during the late [[Eastern Han dynasty]] of China.

==Life==
Gan Ji was from Langya Commandery (琅琊郡), which is around present-day [[Linyi]], [[Shandong]].

According to the ''[[Book of Later Han]]'', during the reign of [[Emperor Shun of Han]] ({{reign}} 125–144), Gong Chong (宮崇), one of Gan Ji's disciples, submitted the ''[[Taiping Qingling Shu]]'' (太平清領書) to the emperor.

Some believe that the character '''Yu Ji''' (于吉) in the 14th-century historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' is a misspelling of Gan Ji.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Daoist Scriptures|last=Bokenkamp|first=Stephen R.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1997|edition=reprint, revised|isbn=052092312X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the novel, Yu Ji wandered around the [[Jiangnan|Jiangdong]] region, chatting with soldiers and civilians, making everyone believe that he was a magician and healer. The warlord of Jiangdong, [[Sun Ce]], heard of Yu Ji's magic and grew suspicious of him, thinking that he was casting spells on people. Sun Ce accused Yu Ji of sorcery and had him executed. However, Yu Ji's spirit returned to haunt Sun Ce and eventually caused him to die from shock.

Many historians reject the account of Yu Ji/Gan Ji and Sun Ce, suggesting that it is propaganda or merely fiction. Reasons for this include Gan Ji's previously recorded activities (which would have made Gan Ji quite old by the time he met Sun Ce). Only a select few historical texts mention Yu Ji being killed by Sun Ce. Of those that do, Yu Ji is not necessarily portrayed as an innocent victim; rather, in the ''Jiangbiao Zhuan'' (江表傳), Sun Ce believes that Yu Ji is misleading the people (Sun Ce was a strict [[Confucianism|Confucian]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Popular Religious Movements and Heterodox Sects in Chinese History|last=Seiwert|first=Hubert Michael|publisher=Brill|year=2003|isbn=9004131469|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the video games ''[[Dynasty Warriors 5]]'' and ''[[Dynasty Warriors 7]]'', there is a stage is based on Sun Ce's confrontation with Yu Ji, a fictional event. In the stage Sun Ce has to fight Yu Ji clones, as well as a [[Two Qiaos|Da Qiao]] and [[Sun Jian]] clone.

The 1983 Hong Kong film ''The Weird Man'' by the [[Shaw Brothers Studio]] is loosely based on the story of Yu Ji and Sun Ce. Yu Ji was put to death by Sun Ce and he later comes back as a ghost and wreaks havoc on Sun Ce for revenge by possessing his army and his wife. He also helped Sun Ce kill [[Xu Gong]] while killing Sun Ce in the process. In this film, he is seen as the hero while Sun Ce is portrayed as the anti-hero. ''The Weird Man'' was remade in 1993 as ''Ninja in Ancient China''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5329">'''Gaston Barnibus Cashwell''' (1860–1916) was an early [[Pentecostal]] leader in the southern [[United States]].  He was born in [[Sampson County, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="Pent. Dict."&gt;{{cite book|last=Synan|first=H. Vinson|title=The new international dictionary of Pentecostal and charismatic movements.|year=2002|publisher=Zondervan Pub. House|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|isbn=0310224810|edition=Rev. and expanded|editor=Stanley M. Burgess|pages=457–458|chapter=Cashwell, Gaston Barnabas}}&lt;/ref&gt; His importance lies in bringing several [[Holiness movement]]s into the Pentecostal camp.

G. B. Cashwell first became a minister in the ''Methodist Episcopal Church, South'', and later joined the ''[[International Pentecostal Holiness Church|Holiness Church]] of [[North Carolina]]'' in 1903. In November 1906, he traveled to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] to visit the Pentecostal revival at the [[Azusa Street]] mission. In early December, he had an experience that he believed to be the baptism in the Holy Spirit and the evidence of speaking in tongues. Upon returning to [[Dunn, North Carolina]], on December 31, 1906, Cashwell preached the Pentecostal experience in the local Holiness church. Interest in the Pentecostal experience was so great that he rented a local tobacco warehouse and began a month-long crusade. A revival broke out in North Carolina, especially in the [[holiness movement]]. Most of the ministers of the ''Pentecostal Holiness Church'', the [[Fire-Baptized Holiness Church]] and the ''[[Pentecostal Free Will Baptist Church|Holiness Free Will Baptist Churches]]'' were swept into Pentecostalism by this revival. Over the next six months, he toured the south preaching "Pentecost". His zeal and influence in spreading Pentecostalism through the south has earned him the title of the ''Apostle of Pentecost to the South''.

In the summer of 1907, Cashwell brought the message of Pentecost to evangelists H. G. Rodgers and M. M. Pinson, who carried the message to [[Alabama]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Mississippi]]. Later they would lead these churches into the [[Assemblies of God]]. Through Rodgers and Pinson, A. J. Tomlinson of the [[Church of God of Prophecy|Church of God]] in [[Cleveland, Tennessee]] heard of Cashwell's message and invited him to Cleveland. On January 12, 1908, following a sermon by Cashwell, Tomlinson fell to the floor. He professed to receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost and speaking in at least ten different languages.

In October 1907, Cashwell started a publication in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] called ''The Bridegroom's Messenger''. The periodical was created to spread the Pentecostal message over the country through a combination of sermons, articles, editorials, and testimonies. He edited it for a year before returning fully to his evangelistic efforts. The magazine was later taken over by Paul and Hattie Barth, who organized the ''International Pentecostal Assemblies'' (now [[International Pentecostal Church of Christ]]).

Although the influence of Cashwell was strong, his time of association with the Pentecostal movement was for a brief period of three years - from his "conversion" in 1906 until his departure from the ''Pentecostal Holiness Church'' in 1909. In 1910 and afterward, his name no longer appeared in the roster of ministers belonging to the ''Pentecostal Holiness Church''. Cashwell distanced himself from "Pentecostalism", rejoined the Methodist church, and died from a heart-attack in 1916.

Cashwell's apostleship of Pentecostalism in the south influenced many denominations. About a dozen existing Pentecostal bodies can trace their Pentecostal heritage directly or at least in part to Gaston B. Cashwell, including:

*[[Assemblies of God USA]]
*[[Church of God (Cleveland)]]
*[[Church of God of Prophecy]]
*[[Congregational Holiness Church]]
*[[International Pentecostal Church of Christ]]
*[[International Pentecostal Holiness Church]]
*[[Pentecostal Free Will Baptist Church]]

{{contradict|date=February 2014}}
The name is Gaston Barnabas Cashwell and he was born on April 5, 1862. While it is commonly held that he belonged to the Methodist Episcopal Church South, there are no records to support that claim or that he joined that movement, or any movement, when he was dropped from the membership of the Pentecostal Holiness Church of North Carolina in 1910.

In the 1890s he was a tobacco demonstrator in South Georgia and the Atlanta Constitution for October 27, 1893, contains an article about his tobacco growth in south Georgia.

The source for this information is the book, Azusa East: The Life and Times of G.B. Cashwell by Doug Beacham (Franklin Springs, GA: LSR Publications, 2006).

'''Gay Muslims''' (2006) is a [[Channel 4]] [[Documentary film|documentary]] about the experiences of five [[LGBT topics and Islam|lesbian and gay Muslims]], how they challenge the [[heterosexism|heterosexual bias]] [[Islam in the United Kingdom|within their British communities]], and attempt to integrate their [[Religion and sexuality#Islam|religion with their sexuality]]. It is usually a stark choice between [[Sexual repression|suppressing]] [[homosexual desires]] and leading an [[Closeted|undercover double life]], or [[coming out]] and losing the respect and support of their families and communities.

==Background==
{{Main|LGBT in Islam}}
LGBT in Islam is influenced by the religious, legal, social, and cultural history of the nations with a sizable [[Muslim]] population, along with specific passages in the [[Quran]]&lt;ref name="FordhamQu'ran"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/quran-homo.asp|title=The Qu'ran and Homosexuality|work=Internet History Sourcebooks Project|publisher=[[Fordham University]]|access-date=7 November 2013|quote=Richard Burton suggests the following Qu'ranic verses as relevant to homosexuality:

The Quran cites the story of the "people of [[Islamic view of Lot|Lot]]" destroyed by the [[Anger#Islam|wrath]] of [[God in Islam|God]] because they engaged in [[Lust#Islam|lustful]] [[carnal acts between men]]. [[Homosexual]] acts are [[Haram|forbidden]] in traditional [[Islamic jurisprudence]] and are liable to different [[punishments]], including the [[Capital punishment in Islam|death penalty]], depending on the situation and [[Madhhab|legal school]]. However, [[homosexual relationships]] were generally tolerated in [[pre-modern Islamic societies]],&lt;ref name=EI2&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|year= 2012 | title=Liwāṭ |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P.

==Scholar==
The diverse ways of understanding of the Quran are echoed in the documentary by Dr [[Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle]] of [[Swarthmore College]] in the United States, currently a research fellow at [[Leiden University]] in the Netherlands. He believes that ''[[sharia]]'' – Islamic law – is determined by male [[Faqīh|jurists]] whose [[Tafsir|interpretations]] of [[List of Islamic texts|Islamic texts]] are based on [[cultural assumptions]] situated in particular times, and particular political and geographical locations. Rather than ''sharia'' being divine, Kugle believes that it offers different avenues for Muslims to live their lives. He also points out that there is no word in the Quran for "gay" or "homosexual", and no mention of [[lesbians]].

==Activists==
{{See also|LGBT in Islam#LGBT movements within Islam}}
Some 200 lesbian and gay Muslims were contacted by the programme makers but only a handful were willing to be interviewed, and most of those insisted on keeping their identities hidden, to prevent [[Violence against LGBT people|reprisals]]. Only one was prepared to show his face and give his true name. He was Adnan Ali, an activist on issues affecting [[LGBT]] Muslims. Adnan described how, when he first came out in [[LGBT rights in Pakistan|Pakistan]], he was physically and verbally abused. He then came to the [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], where he chatted online with members of the American [[Al-Fatiha Foundation]], an international organisation dedicated to Muslims who are LGBT or questioning, and their friends. Adnan then set up a sister group, now called [[Imaan (organization)|Imaan]].

==Voices==
The interviewees speak of their commitment to and belief in Islam, though they are mostly [[Ostracism|ostracised]] than their beliefs getting support by their community and family. ‘Razeem’ speaks of his pain at being denied access to the children of his previous marriage, despite having a legal right to access and the fact that his wife ran away with another man. He also wishes there were more role models, like Adnan Ali, for gay Muslims. ‘Shakir’ and his parents find it easier to accept lesbianism than gay men’s homosexuality. ‘Farah’ contemplates going back into the closet, to lie about her sexuality to ease the tension in her relationship with her parents.

The programme's presenter, [[Sonia Deol]], says that the gay Muslim group Imaan supports the idea of "keeping sexuality a private matter".

'''''Gods, Demons and Others''''' is a collection of short stories by [[R. K. Narayan]] adapted from Indian history and mythology, including epics like ''[[The Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahābhārata]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/15/books/india-of-the-imagination.html ''New York Times'', India of the Imagination, Julian Moynahan, July 15, 1990]&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, Narayan provides both vitality and an original viewpoint to ancient legends.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/31/books/new-noteworthy-paperbacks-267493.html ''New York Times'', New &amp; Noteworthy Paperbacks, Laurel Graber, October 13, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
''Gods, Demons and Others'' is a collection of ancient tales from India's complex history and mythology presented in their traditional setting, albeit with Narayan's urbane and affectionate, satirical style, bereft of any didactic interludes.

The book consists of 15 stories.&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0816FD355F147A93CAA9178AD95F408685F9 New York Times, It's All in the Telling; Gods, Demons and Others, Nov 8, 1964]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Is Spiritualism a Fraud?''''' (AKA: '''''The Medium Exposed''''') is a 1906 British [[Short film|short]] [[silent film|silent]] [[drama film]], directed by [[Walter R. Booth]] (also credited to J.H. Martin), featuring a medium exposed as a fake during a séance. The trick film is, "one of the last films made by  R.W. Paul in collaboration with the trick-film specialist W.R. Booth," and according to Michael Brooke of BFI Screenonline, "combines elements of the previous year's ''[[The Unfortunate Policeman]]'' with a special effects sequence.  However, unlike Booth and Paul's other work, here the mechanisms are deliberately revealed," "the crucial difference between his illusions and those of a medium is that Booth's audience knew that they were being deceived, but were happy to go along with the charade for the sake of both entertainment and the pleasure of working out how it was done." &lt;ref name="BFIso01"&gt;{{cite web |title=Is Spiritualism a Fraud? |first=Michael |last=Brooke |coauthors= |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1229218/ |work=BFI Screenonline Database |date= |accessdate=2011-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jamatkhana in Dizbad-near Nishapur City.jpg|thumb|A Jama'at Khana in [[Nishapur]], Dizbad Region.]]

'''Jamatkhana''' (from {{lang-fa|جماعت خانہ }}, literally "congregational place") is an amalgamation derived from the Arabic word ''jama‘a'' (gathering) and the Persian word ''khana'' (house, place). It is a term used by some [[Muslim]] communities around the world, particularly [[sufi]] ones, to denote a place of gathering.&lt;ref&gt;Azim Nanji and Razia Nanji, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Islam'' (London: Penguin, 2008), s.v. ''jamat khana''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among some communities of Muslims, the term is often used interchangeably with the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word '''Musallah''' (a place of worship that has not been formally sanctified as a ''[[masjid]]'' &lt;ref name="qaSunniPathFiqhMasjid"&gt;[http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=4347&amp;CATE=4 Fiqh of Masjid &amp; Musalla] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019002051/http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=4347&amp;CATE=4 |date=2011-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or is a place that is being temporarily used as a place of worship by a Muslim). The [[Nizārī Ismā'īlī]] community uses the term ''Jama'at Khana'' to denote their places of worship.&lt;ref name="Sami Nasib Makarem 1972"&gt;Sami Nasib Makarem, ''The Doctrine of the Ismailis'' (Beirut: The Arab Institute for Research and Publishing, 1972), 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Jamatkhana as a place of gathering and Prayer==

While the ''masjid'' (literally: the place of a Muslim's ''sujood'' or prostration before God) or ''mosque'' (in English) is the term used by the Qur'an to denote the primary space of ''salaat'' (communal Muslim prayers), a range of spaces for Islamic communal purposes can be currently found throughout the [[Muslim]] world.&lt;ref&gt;Renard, John.

University of California Press, 1996, pp. 168-175&lt;/ref&gt; Some are concentrated within particular geographic regions while others are in use by specific communities.

==The Jamatkhana in Nizārī Ismā'īlīsm==
{{Ismailis|Ismaili History}}
{{Main|Nizārī Ismā'īlī}}

The exact origins of the use of ''Jamatkhana'' in the [[Nizārī Ismā'īlī]] tradition are not as yet clear. However, communal memory, oral traditions and individual [[Ginans]]  (Indo-Muslim religious poems) narrate that Pirs Shams (fl. between 13th and 15th centuries)&lt;ref&gt;Kassam, Tazim R.'' Songs of Wisdom and Circles of Dance: [[Hymns]] of the [[Satpanth]] [[Ismaili]] Saint, Pir Shams''. SUNY Press: 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and Sadr al-Din ([[floruit|fl.]] 14th century),&lt;ref&gt;Asani, Ali. ''Ecstasy and Enlightenment''. I. B. Tauris: 2002, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; emissaries appointed by the [[Ismaili]] [[Imam]] in [[Persia]] and sent to the [[South Asia]] in the service of the faith, established the first such spaces for the nascent [[Nizārī Ismā'īlī]] communities in [[Sindh]], [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]], [[Kashmir]]&lt;ref&gt;Daftary, Farhad. ''The Ismailis: Their History and Doctrines''. 2nd edition. Cambridge University Press, 2007, pp. 443.&lt;/ref&gt; and China&lt;ref&gt;Pir Shams. “Mansamjhani,” (Khojki Script). Khoja Sindhi Press, 1912, p. 259, v. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; during their lifetimes. ''Jannatpuri'', a long composition known as a ''granth'' and belonging to the genre of the [[Ginans]], by Sayyid Imamshah (d. after 1473) situates one of the earliest of these ''Jamatkhanas'' to a place by the name of Kotda, which is thought to be in modern-day [[Sindh]] in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Imamshah"&gt;Sayyid Imamshah, ''Jannatpuri''. [[Gujarati Language]] composition written printed in the Khojki Script by Lalji-Bhai Devraj, Bombay: 1905, v. 84&lt;/ref&gt; The same composition also mentions that the village headman, the ''mukhi'' (Sanskrit: ''mukhya'') was closely associated with the ''Jamatkhana'' as an official.&lt;ref name="Imamshah"/&gt;

=== The Earliest Jamatkhanas ===
The Jamatkhana was a space particular to several localized Ismaili communities of the [[South Asia]], primarily in delta regions.&lt;ref&gt;Bovin, Michel. ''Ismaeliens d’Asie du Sud: Gestion des Heritages et Productions Identitaires''. Editions l’Harmattan: 2008, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently adopted by a wider range of Indian Ismaili communities in subsequent decades and centuries.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} These diverse groups, each with their own histories, identities and social organization identified themselves using various names such as Momin (or Mumna),&lt;ref&gt;Ali Asani.'' Ecstasy and Enlightenment: The Ismaili Devotional Literature of South Asia.'' I. B. Tauris: London, 2002, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Shamsi,&lt;ref&gt;See for example, Dominique-Sila Khan’s ''Crossing the Threshold: Understanding Religious Identities in South Asia''. I. B. Tauris: London, 2004, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Khoja]]&lt;ref&gt;Azim Nanji. ''The [[Nizārī Ismā'īlī]] Tradition in the Indo–Pakistan Subcontinent.'' Delmar: NY, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gupti,.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, Domique-Sila Khan’s'' Conversion and Shifting Identities: Ramdev Pir and the Ismailis of Rajasthan''. Manohar, Delhi: 2003, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Collectively, these communities adopted the practice of [[Satpanth]] (lit. true path), a designation for Shi‘i Ismailism of this period in the Subcontinent which included communal congregation in the ''Jamatkhana''.&lt;ref&gt;Azim Nanji. ''The [[Nizārī Ismā'īlī]] Tradition in the Indo–Pakistan Subcontinent''. Delmar: NY, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term seems to have come in use to designate the place of [[Satpanth]]i religious gathering fairly late, possibly not until the last decades of the 18th or early years of the 19th centuries.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The prefix ''‘jamat’'' does not seem to appear in front of the term ''‘khana’'' amongst the [[Nizārī Ismā'īlī]]s in oral renditions or the earliest written texts. The first reference in the English language to the ''Jamatkhana'' appears to be in relation to a court case filed against the Khojas of Bombay by Aga Khan I in 1829, but which was later dropped, suggesting the term was in circulation by that point. See ''Aga Khan Case'', pp. 352, 363, 363a. The term ''darkhana'' as applied to a ''Jamatkhana'' and not simply the Imam’s residence was first seen in usage in 1870 when it was applied to a ''Jamatkhana'' in Bombay’s Khadak district. Amongst the Imamshahis, the term ''‘khana’'' is still used to designate the space used for congregational practices of the community. The term ''‘Jamatkhana’'' is absent from their discourses. The term ''gatjamat'' referring to the congregation who gathered in this communal space can be found in many ''ginans''.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common term used in the [[Nizārī Ismā'īlī]] ''ginans'' to refer to these spaces is the term ''gat.''&lt;ref group=Note&gt;One of the most commonly recited ''ginans'' that includes this reference is “Gat Maa(n)he Aavine” (Come to the Space of Communal Congregation) attributed to Pir Sadr al-Din in the Khoja [[Nizārī Ismā'īlī]] tradition and Sayyid Imamshah in the Imamshahi tradition. Numerous other ''ginans'' also make reference to the ''‘gat’'' as the congregational space of the community and the importance of the rituals that take place within it.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Evolution of the Jamatkhana ===
By the mid-19th century, as [[Nizārī Ismā'īlī]] communities migrated from towns and villages to urban centres throughout the Indian Ocean littoral, the ''khana'' seems to have become a distinct space housed in a separate structure, usually located within a ''mohalla'', or enclave, of [[Satpanth]]i believers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Several of the oldest extant examples of ''Jamatkhanas'' go back to this period.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Most, however, have subsequently been renovated and added to, to accommodate the changing functional needs and ritual practices of the ''jamats'' (congregation) that they serve.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} The oldest of these urban structures can be found in places such as Gwadar (present day Pakistan), Zanzibar and Bombay (present day India).{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} More modest examples that date from this period can also be found throughout Kutch and in Jerruk in interior Sindh, the residence of Aga Khan I upon his arrival to the [[South Asia]]. The architecture and organization of these spaces tell us that there was no single architectural template or model of the ''Jamatkhana'', but rather each was constructed based on a series of circumstances including such things as location, cultural environment, architectural practices of the period and resources available. The variations from one ''Jamatkhana'' to the next also gives us clues to the nature of practices, the use and allocation of space and the nature and function of social relationships. Some of these were due to the cultural milieu in which the ''Jamatkhanas'' were situated while others followed general traditions of pietic and religious culture, which in turn informed rules of decorum and etiquette within these spaces.

In 1870, the Bombay Jamatkhana in Khadak became the first ''Jamatkhana'' assigned as a ''darkhana.''&lt;ref group=Note&gt;However, it is possible that the term was in use somewhat earlier. In Kahak, Iran, there are a number of gravestones which speak about one “Kamadia Datardina Wandani of Darkhana ''jamat''” who came to visit the Imam. The Gujarati-language Khojki inscription places Wandani’s death in 1803. See Ivanow, W. “Tombs of Some Persian Ismaili Imams,” Journal of the British Bombay Royal Asiatic Society, New Serial, Vol. 14 (1938), pp. 58-59.  In the contemporary period, the Ismaili Centre, London was dedicated as the first ''darkhana'' on April 24, 1985 upon its opening.&lt;/ref&gt; The term, was initially used to designate the chief residence of the Imam. In later years, however, it came to stand for the principal ''Jamatkhana'' in a national context. Today, eight countries have ''Darkhana Jamatkhanas'' in the [[Nizārī Ismā'īlī]] tradition. These include India, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Canada, Pakistan, England and Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;See Aga Khan IV, “The Constitution of the Shia Imami Ismaili Muslims”, Article 10 and Schedule 6. Original version in 1986 and revisions in 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Jamatkhana as the Centre of Nizārī Ismā'īlī Practice ===
[[File:Iringa Jamatkhana.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Iringa]] Jamatkhana in [[Tanzania]].]]
While the ''Jamatkhana'' initially began as a space of congregation specific to [[Satpanth]]i communities, it eventually was adopted by Ismaili communities with different geographic, cultural and linguistic backgrounds and historical experiences who before this congregated in spaces with different trajectories and nomenclatures.&lt;ref&gt;Daftary, Farhad.'' The Ismailis: Their History and Doctrines''. 2nd ed. Cambridge University Press: 2007, p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt; During the seven decades of Sir Sultan Mohammed Shah, Aga Khan III’s (d. 1957) Imamat, formal relationships with Ismaili communities living in Tajikistan, Afghanistan, China, the Northern Areas of Pakistan, Persia and Syria, were strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Memoirs of Aga Khan:World Enough and Time''. Cassel &amp; Company, London: 1954 and reprinted as: ''World Enough and Time: The Memoirs of Sir Sultan Mohammed Shah Aga Khan III'' in 2 Volumes as part of the series, “Karachi Under the Raj 1843-1947,” Dawn in collaboration with the Trustees of Mohatta Palace Museum and Pakistan Herald Publications, 2005. In the reprint, see for example, “Chapter VIII: The Islamic Concept and My Role as Imam,” pp II:1-39 and “Chapter XIV: My Recent Travels,” pp. II:177-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ismailis of the Northern Areas of Pakistan, namely Chitral, Ghizr, Gilgit, Hunza, as well as the border regions of China, were some of the first communities to adopt the ''Jamatkhana'' into their ritual life. But these Jamat Khana's were not open spaces like the other Jamat Khana's, due to political restrictions, the followers use to meet at a designated house and perform all the rituals. They use to practice their faith in hiding .i.e. they we called the gupti community.

The seeds of these institutions were planted in 1923 when a missionary by the name of [[Ramzanali Sabzali]] (d. 1938) was sent to these various communities by Aga Khan III.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;[http://www.ismaili.net/Source/pirsabzali/index.html The diary of Missionary Sabzali, posthumously endowed with the title of ''pir'' by Imam Sultan Mahomed Shah, is extant. It was first published in Gujarati as “Alijah Missionary Sabzalibahi’ni Musafar,” in the weekly ''Ismaili'' (Bombay) between February 17, 1924 and December 5, 1926. A significantly edited version of the text was also published serially in the'' Ismaili Crescent'' (Dar es Salaam) between January 8, 1967 and April 2, 1968. This again was reproduced in the fortnightly community magazine ''Paigham'' (Karachi) between February 15, 1967 and April 15, 1970 and again in the ''Ismaili'' between March 21 and October 6, 1967. This version culminated in the publication of the serialisation of the journey as a book printed by the Ismaili Printing Press in Bombay in 1968, entitled ''Pir Sabzali’ni Madhaya Asia’ni Musafari''.” A version prepared by Sabzali’s personal secretary, Ramzan Ali Alibhai first appeared in the ''Platinum Jubilee Bulletin'' (Bombay) between July 15 and October 1, 1953 and was edited by Jafar Ali H. Lakhani. An English translation is available online as “Voyage of Pir Sabzali in Central Asia,” translated by Mumtaz Tajddin]&lt;/ref&gt; Jamatkhanas were also introduced in Syria in the period of the 1940s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} It was not however, until the tenure and leadership of the present Imam of the Ismailis, His Highness Prince Karim Aga Khan (b. 1936) that similar spaces were also introduced in Iran (1960s), Afghanistan (1960s and 2001) and Tajikistan (2009).&lt;ref&gt;Daftary, Farhad.

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|denominations}}
'''Jewish religious movements''', sometimes called "[[Religious denomination|denominations]]" or "branches", include different groups which have developed among [[Jew]]s from ancient times. Today, the main division is between the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]], and [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] movements, with several smaller movements alongside them. This denominational structure is mainly present in the United States, while in Israel, the fault lines are between the Orthodox and the [[Jewish secularism|non-religious]].

The movements [[Relationships between Jewish religious movements|differ in their views]] on various issues. These issues include the level of observance, the methodology for interpreting and understanding [[Halakha|Jewish law]], [[Historical criticism|biblical authorship]], [[textual criticism]], and the nature or role of [[Messiah in Judaism|the messiah]] (or [[messianic age]]). Across these movements, there are marked differences in [[Jewish services|liturgy]], especially in the language in which services are conducted, with the more traditional movements emphasizing Hebrew. The sharpest theological division occurs between Orthodox and non-Orthodox Jews who adhere to other denominations, such that the non-Orthodox movements are sometimes referred to collectively as the "liberal denominations" or "progressive streams".

==Terminology==
Some Jews reject the term ''denomination'' as a label for different groups and ideologies within Judaism, arguing that the notion of denomination has a specifically Christian resonance that does not translate easily into the Jewish context. However, in recent years the ''[[American Jewish Year Book]]'' has adopted "denomination", as have many scholars and theologians.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Sarna, ''American Judaism: A History'' (2004) p. xix-xx notes the "newfound popularity" of the term "denomination".&lt;/ref&gt; Other commonly used terms are ''movements'', ''branches'', ''trends'', ''streams'', or even ''flavors'' of Judaism.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The Jewish denominations themselves reject characterization as [[sects]]. Sects are traditionally defined as religious subgroups that have broken off from the main body, and this separation usually becomes irreparable over time. Within Judaism, individuals and families often switch affiliation, and individuals are free to marry one another, although the major denominations disagree on [[Who is a Jew?|who is a Jew]]. It is not unusual for clergy and Jewish educators trained in one of the liberal denominations to serve in another, and left with no choice, many small Jewish communities combine elements of several movements to achieve a viable level of membership.

[[Relationships between Jewish religious movements]] are varied; they are sometimes marked by interdenominational cooperation outside of the realm of ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law), and sometimes not. Some of the movements sometimes cooperate by uniting with one another in community federations and in campus organizations such as the [[Hillel Society|Hillel Foundation]]. Jewish religious denominations are distinct from, but often linked to, [[Jewish ethnic divisions]] and [[Jewish political movements]].

==Judaism and Samaritans==
{{Main|Samaritans}}
The [[Samaritan]]s regard themselves as direct descendants of the tribes of [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]] and [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]] in the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]], which was conquered by [[Assyria]] in 722 BCE. Modern genetics has suggested some truth to both the claims of the Samaritans and of the Jews in account to the Talmud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oefner, Peter|title=Reconstruction of Patrilineages and Matrilineages of Samaritans and Other Israeli Populations From Y-Chromosome and Mitochondrial DNA Sequence Variation |journal=Human Mutation |year=2004 |pages=248–260 |volume=24 |doi=10.1002/humu.20077 |pmid=15300852 |issue=3 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=March 2011}} Samaritan scripture preserves a version of the [[Pentateuch]] in slightly variant forms. The first historical references to the Samaritans date from the [[Babylonian Exile]]. According to the Talmud, Samaritans are to be treated as Jews in matters where their practice agrees with the mainstream but are otherwise to be treated as non-Jews. The Samaritans have dwindled to two communities of about 700 individuals. One such community is located in the [[Israel]]i city of [[Holon]], while the other is located near [[Nablus]] on [[Mount Gerizim]], in the [[West Bank]].

Today, Samaritans need to officially go through formal [[conversion to Judaism]] in order to be considered Jewish. One example is Israeli TV personality [[Sofi Tsedaka]] who was brought up Samaritan and converted to Judaism at the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/54/ART2/155/455.html|title=- - nrg - ... :|publisher=Nrg.co.il|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4234099,00.html|title=ynet סופי צדקה עושה שבת (וחג) - יהדות|work=ynet|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sects in the Second Temple period==
{{main|Second Temple Judaism}}
Prior to the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE, Jews of the Roman province of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judaea]] were divided into several movements, sometimes warring among themselves: [[Pharisees]], [[Saducees]], [[Essenes]], [[Zealots]], and [[Jewish Christian|Christians]]. Many historic sources such as [[Flavius Josephus]], the (Christian) [[New Testament]] and the recovered fragments of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], attest to the divisions among Jews at this time. [[Rabbinical writings]] from later periods, including the [[Talmud]], further attest these ancient schisms.

The main internal struggles during this era were between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, as well as the Christians, and also the Essenes and Zealots. The Pharisees wanted to maintain the authority and traditions of classical Torah teachings and began the early teachings of the [[Mishna]], maintaining the authority of the [[Sanhedrin]], the supreme Jewish court. According to Josephus, the Sadducees differed from the Pharisees on a number of doctrinal grounds, notably rejecting ideas of life after death. They appear to have dominated the aristocracy and the temple, but their influence over the wider Jewish population was limited. The Essenes preached an ascetic way of life. The Zealots advocated armed rebellion against any foreign power such as [[Rome]]. All were at violent logger-heads with each other, leading to the confusion and disunity that ended with the destruction of the Second Temple and the sacking of [[Jerusalem]] by Rome. The first Christians (whom historians refer to as [[Jewish Christians]]) were the original Jewish followers of [[Jesus]]. The eventual redefinition of [[Biblical law in Christianity|Moses' Law]] by Jesus' [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] and their [[Divinity of Jesus|belief in his deity]], along with the [[Development of the New Testament canon|development of the New Testament]], ensured that [[Christianity and Judaism]] would become [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|different and often conflicting religions]].

==Rabbinic Judaism==
Most streams of modern Judaism developed from the Pharisaic movement, which became known as [[Rabbinic Judaism]] (in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''Yahadut Rabanit'' - יהדות רבנית) with the compilation of the [[Oral Torah]] into the [[Mishna]]. After the destruction of the Second Temple and the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] the other movements disappeared from the historical record, yet the [[Sadducees]] probably kept on existing in a non-organized form for at least several more decades.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} A scholar named Rodkinson claimed about a century ago that the Sadducees ultimately changed their name and are those who are referred to as the ''Qara'im'' and ''Ba`alei Miqra'' in the [[Talmud]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Jewish ethnic and cultural divisions==
{{Main|Jewish ethnic divisions}}
A wide array of Jewish communities have developed independently, distinguishable by their varying practices in matters that are ''not'' considered central ideas within Judaism, such as [[Maimonides]]' list of the [[Jewish principles of faith]].

Although there are numerous [[Jewish ethnic divisions|Jewish ethnic communities]], there are several that are large enough to be considered "predominant". [[Ashkenazi Jews]] communities compose about 75% of the world's Jewish population. [[Sephardi Jews]] and [[Mizrahi Jews]] compose the greatest part of the rest, with about 20% of the world's Jewish population. Together these ethnic groups compose 95% of the world's Jewish population. The remaining 5% of Jews are divided among a wide array of small groups (perhaps the [[Beta Israel]] group of Ethiopian Jews is the most important), some of which are nearing extinction as a result of [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] and [[interfaith marriage|intermarriage]] into surrounding non-Jewish cultures or surrounding Jewish cultures.

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] had a tremendous effect on [[Jewish identity]] and on ideas about the importance and role of Jewish observance. Due to the geographical distribution and the geopolitical entities affected by the Enlightenment, this [[philosophy|philosophical]] revolution essentially affected only the Ashkenazi community; however, because of the predominance of the Ashkenazi community in [[Politics of Israel|Israeli politics]] and in [[Jewish leadership]] worldwide, the effects have been significant for all Jews.

=== Sephardic Judaism ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
[[Sephardic Judaism]] is the practice of Judaism as observed by the Sephardi ([[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]]), [[Maghrebi Jews]] and Mizrahi Jews, so far as it is peculiar to themselves and not shared with other Jewish groups such as the Ashkenazim (German Rite). Sephardic Judaism does not constitute a separate denomination within Judaism, but rather a separate cultural tradition.

Sephardim are primarily the descendants of Jews from the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. They may be divided into the families that left in the [[Alhambra Decree|Expulsion of 1492]] and those that remained as [[Crypto-Judaism|crypto-Jews]], [[Marrano]]s and those who left in the following few centuries. In religious parlance, and by many in modern Israel, the term is used in a broader sense to include all Jews of Ottoman or other Asian or African backgrounds (Mizrahi Jews), whether or not they have any historic link to Spain, although some prefer to distinguish between Sephardim proper and Mizraḥi Jews.

Sephardic Judaism lacks movements such as "Orthodox", "conservative", or "reform"; level of halachic observance is left to each person, but none dispute that contemporary definitions of "Orthodox" represents the level of observance of many Sephardim.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Sephardic and Mizrachi Jewish [[synagogue]]s are generally considered "Orthodox" by non-sephardic Jews, and are primarily run according to the Orthodox tradition, even though many of the congregants may not keep a level of observance on par with traditional Orthodox belief. For example, many congregants will drive to the synagogue on the [[Shabbat]],{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} in violation of halacha, while discreetly entering the synagogue so as not to offend more observant congregants.

Unlike the predominantly Ashkenazi Reform, and Reconstructionist denominations, Sephardic and Mizrachi Jews who are not observant generally believe that Orthodox Judaism's interpretation and legislation of ''halacha'' is appropriate, and true to the original philosophy of Judaism. That being said, Sephardic and Mizrachi Rabbis tend to hold different, and generally more lenient, positions on ''halacha'' than their Ashkenazi counterparts, but since these positions are based on rulings of Talmudic scholars as well as well-documented traditions that can be linked back to well-known codifiers of Jewish law, Ashkenazi and Hasidic Rabbis do not believe that these positions are incorrect, but rather that they are the appropriate interpretation of ''halacha'' for Jews of Sephardic and Mizrachi descent.

== Hasidic Judaism ==
[[Hasidic Judaism]] was founded by [[Israel ben Eliezer]] (1700–1760), also known as the Baal Shem Tov. His disciples attracted many followers among Ashkenazi Jews, and established numerous Hasidic groups across Europe. The Baal Shem Tov came at a time when the Jewish masses of Eastern Europe were reeling in bewilderment and disappointment engendered by the two notorious Jewish [[Jewish Messiah claimants|false messiahs]], [[Sabbatai Zevi]] (1626–1676) and [[Jacob Frank]] (1726–1791), and their respective [[Jewish schisms#Sabbatians and Frankists|followers]]. Hasidic Judaism eventually became the way of life for many Jews in Eastern Europe.

In the late 18th century, there was a serious schism between Hasidic and non-Hasidic Jews. European Jews who rejected the Hasidic movement were dubbed ''[[Misnagdim|Mitnagdim]]'' ("opponents") by the followers of the Baal Shem Tov, who had previously called themselves ''Freylechn'' ("happy ones") and now call themselves Hasidim ("pious ones"). Some of the reasons for the rejection of Hasidic Judaism were the overwhelming exuberance of Hasidic worship, their untraditional ascriptions of infallibility and alleged miracle-working to their leaders, and the concern that it might become a [[messianism|messianic]] sect. Since then, all the groups of Hasidic Judaism have been subsumed theologically into mainstream Orthodox Judaism, particularly [[Haredi Judaism]], although cultural differences persist.

== Modern movements or denominations ==
Perhaps the greatest divisions since the time of the division between the Sadducees and Pharisees two millennia ago are the divisions within the Ashkenazic community that have arisen in the past two centuries, ever since the Enlightenment and the [[Renaissance]] influenced Jews from northern and eastern Europe.

The first evidence of this great dogmatic schism was the development of the [[Reform Judaism]] movement, which rejected "ethnic Judaism" and preferred to regard Judaism as a religion rather than an ethnicity. Over time, three large movements emerged:
* [[Orthodox Judaism]]. Orthodox Jews generally see themselves as practicing normative Judaism, rather than belonging to a particular movement. Within Orthodox Judaism, there is a spectrum of communities and practices, including [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]], [[Haredi Judaism]], and a variety of movements that have their origins in [[Hasidic Judaism]].
* [[Conservative Judaism]], or "Masorti Judaism". Originated in Germany in the 19th century, but became institutionalized in the United States. After the division between Reform and Orthodox Judaism, the Conservative movement tried to provide Jews seeking liberalization of Orthodox theology and practice with a more traditional and halakhically-based alternative to Reform Judaism. It has spread to Ashkenazi communities in Anglophone countries and Israel.
* [[Reform Judaism]], also known as Liberal or Progressive Judaism. Originally formed in Germany as a reaction to modernity, stresses integration with society and a personal interpretation of the [[Torah]].

Additionally, a number of smaller groups have emerged:
* [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], a smaller progressive Jewish movement, found primarily in the United States. It began as a liberal movement within Conservative Judaism and formally separated in the 1940s.
* [[Karaite Judaism]], (Hebrew: Yahadut Qara'it or Yahadut Kara'it – יהדות קראית, derived from the word "Qara'im" i.e. "readers of Scripture") started in the early 9th century when non-Rabbinic Sages like Benjamin Nahawandi and their followers took the rejection of the oral law by Anan ben David to the new level of seeking the plain meaning of the Tanakh's text. Karaite Jews have always accepted only the Tanakh as divinely inspired, not recognizing the authority that Rabbinites ascribe to basic Rabbinic works like the Talmud and the Midrashim. 
* [[Humanistic Judaism]], a [[nontheism|nontheistic]] movement that emphasizes [[Jewish culture]] and [[Jewish history|history]] as the sources of Jewish identity. Founded by [[Sherwin Wine]], it is centered in North America but has spread to Europe, the Far East, Latin America, and Israel.
* [[Neolog Judaism]], a movement in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and in its [[Treaty of Trianon|territories ceded in 1920]], which is similar to the more traditional branch of American Conservative Judaism.
* [[Jewish Renewal]]. Founded in the counter-cultural movements of the 1960s and 1970s, Jewish Renewal tends to embrace the [[Ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic]] worship style and mysticism of hasidism, while rejecting the halakhic rigor of Orthodox Judaism. Jewish Renewal congregations tend to be inclusive on the subject of who is a Jew. The Jewish Renewal movement lacks the formal institutional structure of the other liberal movements.
* [[Jewish Science]]. Formed in the early 20th century by Alfred G. Moses and [[Morris Lichtenstein]]. Jewish Science was founded as a counterweight Jewish movement to [[Christian Science]]. Jewish Science sees [[God]] as a force or energy penetrating the reality of the Universe and emphasis is placed upon the role of [[affirmative prayer]] in personal healing and spiritual growth. The Society of Jewish Science in New York is the institutional arm of the movement regularly publishing ''The Interpreter'', the movement's primary literary publication.
* [[Haymanot]], (Ge'ez: ሃይማኖት) a branch of Judaism practiced by the Beta Israel, also known as Ethiopian Jews. Haymanot in both Ge'ez and Amharic means "religion" or "faith".

=== Development of modern denominations ===
Development of denominations or movements has been primarily a phenomenon among Ashkenazi Jews who have immigrated to Anglophone countries. Much of the literature of these denominations is in English, not Hebrew. Their development can be seen as both a response to the western Enlightenment and to emancipation and immigration.

=== Response to Jewish Enlightenment ===
In the late 18th century Europe, and then the rest of the world, was swept by a group of intellectual, social and political movements that taken together were referred to as [[the Enlightenment]]. These movements promoted scientific thinking, free thought, and allowed people to question previously unshaken religious dogmas. The [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] of the Jews in many European communities, and the ''[[Haskalah]]'' movement started by [[Moses Mendelssohn]], brought the Enlightenment to the Jewish community.

In response to the challenges of integrating Jewish life with Enlightenment values, German Jews in the early 19th century began to develop the concept of [[Reform Judaism]], adapting Jewish practice to the new conditions of an increasingly urbanized and secular community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Plaut, W. Gunther|title=The Rise of Reform Judaism: A Sourcebook of its European Origins |year=1963 |publisher=World Union for Progressive Judaism | oclc=39869725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staunch opponents of the Reform movement became known as Orthodox Jews. Later, members of the Reform movement who felt that it was moving away from tradition too quickly formed the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative movement]].

Orthodox Jews who were sympathetic to the Haskalah formed what became known as neo-Orthodox or [[modern Orthodox Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Orthodoxy |title=YIVO &amp;#124; Orthodoxy |publisher=Yivoencyclopedia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orthodox Jews who opposed the Haskalah became known as [[Haredi Jews]].

=== Response to immigration ===
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
The particular forms which the denominations have taken on have been shaped by immigration of the Ashkenazi Jewish communities, once concentrated in eastern and central Europe, to western and mostly Anglophone countries (in particular, in North America). In the middle of the 20th century, the institutional division of North American Jewry between Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox movements still reflected immigrant origins. Reform Jews at that time were predominantly of German or western European origin, while both Conservative and Orthodox Judaism came primarily from eastern European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Herberg, Will|title=Protestant, Catholic, Jew: An Essay in American Religious Sociology |year=1983 |publisher=University Of Chicago Press (Reprint edition) |isbn=0-226-32734-5|oclc=9686985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Response to Israel and Zionism ===
{{see also|Haredim and Zionism}}
The issue of [[Zionism]] was once very divisive in the Jewish community. Ultra-Orthodox Jewish non-Zionists believed that the return to Israel could only happen with the coming of the [[Jewish Messiah|Messiah]], and that a political attempt to re-establish a [[Jewish state]] was contrary to God's plan. Non-Zionists believed that Jews should integrate into the countries in which they lived, rather than moving to the [[Land of Israel]]. The original founders of Reform Judaism in Germany rejected traditional prayers for the restoration of Jerusalem. The view among Reform Jews that Judaism was strictly a religion, and that Jews should be loyal citizens of their host nations, led to a non-Zionist, and sometimes [[anti-Zionist]], stance.

After events of the 20th century, most importantly [[the Holocaust]] and the establishment of the modern [[State of Israel]], opposition to Zionism largely disappeared within Reform Judaism. [[Religious Zionists]] have embraced the Zionist movement as part of the divine plan to bring or speed up the messianic era, based on the teachings of Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]]. Among most religious non-Zionists, there is a de facto recognition of Israel, but as a secular state. The [[Edah HaChareidis]] in Jerusalem does not recognize the legitimacy of the state, and one small group, [[Neturei Karta]], actively opposes the existence of Israel. Secular opposition to Zionism has continued among some Jewish political groups, and among some Jews active in leftist political movements.

=== Response to pressures of assimilation ===
{{Main|Jewish intermarriage}}
Among the most striking differences between the Jewish movements in the 21st century is their response to pressures of assimilation, such as [[Jewish intermarriage|intermarriage]] between Jews and non-Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tobin, Gary A. and Katherine G. Simon |title=Rabbis Talk About Intermarriage |year=1999 |publisher=Institute for Jewish and Community Research |isbn=1-893671-00-3|oclc=44759291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis have been most accepting of intermarried couples, with some rabbis willing to officiate in mixed religious ceremonies, although most insist that children in such families be raised strictly Jewish. Conservative rabbis are not permitted to officiate in such marriages, but are supportive of couples when the non-Jewish partner wishes to convert to Judaism and raise children as Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bloom, Mark|title=A Place In The Tent: Intermarriage And Conservative Judaism |year=2004 |publisher=Eks Publishing |isbn=0-939144-46-8|oclc=179259677 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trans- and post-denominational Judaism ==
The very idea of Jewish denominationalism is contested by some Jews and Jewish [[non-denominational]] organizations, which consider themselves to be "trans-denominational" or "post-denominational".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Heilman, Uriel |title=Beyond Dogma |journal=Jerusalem Post |date=February 11, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of new Jewish organizations are emerging that lack such affiliations:

* Some [[Jewish day school]]s lack affiliation with any one movement;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mendelsohn, Martha |title=High School Without Labels |journal=The Jewish Week |date=August 22, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*There are several seminaries which are not controlled by a denomination. 
**The [[Academy for Jewish Religion (California)|Academy for Jewish Religion]], California, is a transdenominational academy based in Los Angeles. It draws faculty and leadership from all denominations of Judaism. It has programs for rabbis, cantors, chaplains, community leadership and Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE). AJRCA is fully accredited.&lt;ref&gt;https://ajrca.edu/#sthash.dIO47S7j.dpbs accessdate 2-https://ajrca.edu/#sthash.dIO47S7j.dpbs015-11-15)&lt;/ref&gt; 
**The Academy for Jewish Religion, is a transdenominational academy in Yonkers, NY. AJR is a fully accredited program that trains rabbis and cantors and also offers Master’s Program in Jewish Studies.
** The [[Hebrew College]] seminary, in [[Newton Centre, Massachusetts]], near Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Meskin, Jacob |title=Answers Divide Us, Questions Unite Us |url=http://hebrewcollege.edu/hct/spring-summer_2003/insight/answers.html |year=2002 |accessdate=March 9, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040104022259/http://hebrewcollege.edu/hct/spring-summer_2003/insight/answers.html |archivedate=January 4, 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [https://aleph.org/ordinations/our-approach The ALEPH Ordination Program (AOP)], a non-denominational Jewish renewal seminary training rabbis, cantors, rabbinic pastors, and Jewish spiritual directors
* The [[International Federation of Rabbis]] (IFR), a non-denominational rabbinical organization for rabbis of all movements and backgrounds;&lt;ref name="intfedrabbis.org/about.htm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intfedrabbis.org/about.htm |title=International Federation Of Rabbis &amp;#124; About Us |publisher=Intfedrabbis.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations such as these believe that the formal divisions that have arisen among the "denominations" in contemporary Jewish history are unnecessarily divisive, as well as religiously and intellectually simplistic. According to Rachel Rosenthal, "the post-denominational Jew refuses to be labeled or categorized in a religion that thrives on stereotypes. He has seen what the institutional branches of Judaism have to offer and believes that a better Judaism can be created."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rosenthal, Rachel |title=What's in a name? |journal=Kedma |year=2006 |issue=Winter 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such Jews might, out of necessity, affiliate with a synagogue associated with a particular movement, but their own personal Jewish ideology is often shaped by a variety of influences from more than one denomination.

Leather has played an important role in [[Judaism]] and in Jewish life.&lt;ref&gt;David Gonzalo Maeso ''Skin and leather in Judaism: Mishnaic-Talmudic and medieval ages (I-XV Centuries)'', Vic. Spain 1979&lt;/ref&gt; Many items widely used by observant [[Jews]] are made from leather, such as:

*The [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]] made from leather [[parchment]] it is a handwritten copy of the [[Torah]] or Pentateuch, the holiest book within [[Judaism]]. It must meet extremely strict standards of production; 
*[[Mezuzah]]s are pieces of [[parchment]] (often contained in a decorative case) inscribed with specified [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] verses from the [[Torah]] ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|6:4-9|HE}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Deuteronomy|11:13-21|HE}}) some interpret Jewish law to require a mezuzah on every doorway in the home apart from bathrooms, and closets too small to qualify as rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=225406 |title=Which Rooms Require a Mezuzah? |author=Dovid Zaklikowski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ceremony involves the taking off of a brother-in-law's leather shoe by the widow of a brother who has died childless, through which ceremony he is released from the obligation of marrying her, and she becomes free to marry whomever she desires as per ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|25:5-10|HE}}).
*[[Flagellation#Judaism|Malkot]] was corporal punishment by whipping with a leather whip administered in Biblical times.

==Introduction==

References to [[leather]] are found in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and [[Talmud]]. Leather was originally worn to protect against weather conditions. Over time, leather was slowly replaced by other resources as a source for garments. The first reference to leather is in the [[Book of Genesis]] that states that [[Names of God in Judaism|God]] gave man a “coat of skins”.&lt;ref name="leather"&gt;JewishEncyclopedia.com.: [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/9693-leather "LEATHER"]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Patriarchs]] continued to wear the “coat of skins” throughout their rule.&lt;ref name="leather"/&gt; Leather constantly surrounded the day-to-day life of the [[Hebrews]]. The discovery of tanning led to sandals, helmets, shields, utensils, mats, and skins for transporting water.&lt;ref name="leather"/&gt;  
	
The Talmud references several usages of leather throughout its pages. It is likely because of the prevalence of tanning during Talmudic times that many of the articles were written on leather parchment. During Talmudic times, leather was often used in day-to-day life.

==Biblical data==
Skins of animals were employed for clothing as soon as man felt the need of covering his body to protect himself against cold and rain. With the advance of civilization such clothing was everywhere replaced by products of the loom. The same was the case among the Hebrews. The "coat of skins" was regarded by them as having been the first kind of clothing, given to man by God Himself (Gen. iii. 21); and the mantle of skins was still worn in the time of the Patriarchs (Gen. xxv. 25). In historic times the use of the mantle of skins is mentioned only in the case of the prophets Elijah and Elisha, who, in intentional contrast to the people of their day, wore the ancient, simple garb (I Kings xix. 13; II Kings i. 8; ii. 8, 13 et seq.); indeed, the hairy mantle came in time to be the distinguishing feature of a prophet's garb (Zech. xiii. 4; Matt. iii. 4, vii. 15).

After the Hebrews had acquired the art of tanning, which must have been at an early date, leather came to be used for a number of other purposes. Among articles of clothing it was employed chiefly for sandals. Leather girdles are also mentioned (II Kings i. 8 et al.). The warrior had a leather Helmet to protect his head, and his Shield also was usually of leather. For utensils in daily use leather is principally employed among nomads, as it was among the ancient [[Israelites]], since receptacles of leather are not liable to be broken and are easily carried about. The original form of a table, as the word indicates, was a piece of leather, which was spread upon the ground. Pails and all other vessels for holding liquids were made of leather. The leather bucket for drawing water out of a well and the leather flask—consisting of a single skin removed from the animal's carcass as intact as possible—for holding wine or for transporting water have remained in common use in the Orient down to the present day. Skins of goats and sheep were generally used for these various purposes; more seldom, those of oxen. Concerning tanning, although it was probably familiar to the Hebrews from the oldest times, nothing is said in the Old Testament. Not once is a tanner mentioned.

==In the Talmud==

The Talmud speaks of many articles made of skins (); and, as tanning was practiced in Talmudic times, it is possible that such articles, or at least some of them, were of leather. The strap ("reẓu'ah")is mentioned as serving various purposes. Asses were hobbled with straps; and cows were led by means of straps tied to the horns (Shab. 54b). Women used to tie their hair with leather straps (ib. 57a); and by similar means shoes and sandals were fastened to the feet (Neg. xi. 11), and the [[tefillin]] to the head and arm (Men. 35b). Flagellation ("malḳut") was performed by means of three straps—one of calfskin and two of ass'skin (Mak. 22b); straps are frequently mentioned as instruments of punishment, especially of children (Yer. Giṭ. i. 43d, et passim). It would appear that straps were used to tie up certain objects, as the untying of the strap is often used to designate relaxation (Yer. Bik. i. 64a, et passim). It is very probable that sandals generally were made of thick hide; for wooden sandals are indicated as such (Yeb. 101a, et passim). Besides shoes, the Talmud speaks of leather hose ("anpilia"), and of a kind of glove and foot-wear of skin for a cripple who was compelled to use his hands in order to move from place to place (ib. 102b).

The [[Mishnah]], Kelim xxvi. 5, enumerates the following articles made of leather: a covering for the mule or ass; aprons worn by muleteers and by surgeons to protect their clothes; a cradle-cover; a child's breast-piece to protect it from the scratching of a cat; aprons by which wool-carders and flax-spinners protected themselves from the waste of the wool or the tow of the flax; the pad placed by the porter under his load; and skins used for various purposes by individuals not engaged in any business or trade ("'orot ba'al ha-bayit"). In mishnah 8 of the same chapter, tanners' skins are spoken of; but certainly untanned skins are meant, similar to those referred to in Shab. 49a as having been spread by the tanner for people to sit upon.

'''Jiddu Krishnamurti''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɪ|d|uː|k|r|ɪ|ʃ|n|ə|ˈ|m|ɜr|t|i}}; 12 May 1895&amp;nbsp;– 17 February 1986) was an Indian philosopher, speaker and writer. In his early life he was groomed to be the new [[Maitreya (Theosophy)#The World Teacher Project|World Teacher]] but later rejected this mantle and withdrew from the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] organization behind it. His interests included psychological revolution, the nature of mind, [[meditation]], inquiry, human relationships, and bringing about [[Social change|radical change]] in society. He stressed the need for a revolution in the [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] of every human being and emphasised that such revolution cannot be brought about by any external entity, be it religious, political, or social.

Krishnamurti was born in India. In early adolescence he had a chance encounter with [[Occult#Occultism|occultist]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] in the grounds of the [[Theosophical Society]] headquarters at [[Adyar, Chennai|Adyar]] in [[Chennai|Madras]]. He was subsequently raised under the tutelage of [[Annie Besant]] and Leadbeater, leaders of the Society at the time, who believed him to be a 'vehicle' for an expected World Teacher. As a young man, he disavowed this idea and dissolved the [[Order of the Star in the East]], an organisation that had been established to support it.

Krishnamurti said he had no allegiance to any nationality, caste, religion, or philosophy, and spent the rest of his life travelling the world, speaking to large and small groups and individuals. He wrote many books, among them ''[[The First and Last Freedom]]'', ''The Only Revolution'', and ''[[Krishnamurti's Notebook]]''. Many of his talks and discussions have been published. His last public talk was in Madras, India, in January 1986, a month before his death at his home in [[Ojai, California]]. His supporters&amp;nbsp;— working through non-profit foundations in India, Great Britain and the United States&amp;nbsp;— oversee several independent schools based on his views on education. They continue to transcribe and distribute his thousands of talks, group and individual discussions, and writings by use of a variety of media formats and languages.

Krishnamurti was unrelated to his contemporary [[U. G. Krishnamurti]] (1918-2007), although the two men had a number of meetings.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Mind is a Myth|Mind is a Myth]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Family background and childhood===
[[File:At the feet of the master pg 2.jpg|thumb|367x367px|Young Jiddu in 1910, from page 12 of ''"At the feet of the master"'']]
The date of birth of Jiddu Krishnamurti is a matter of dispute. [[Mary Lutyens]] determines it to be 12 May 1895&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1995), footnotes 1, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; but Christine Williams notes the unreliability of birth registrations in that period and that statements claiming dates ranging from 4 May 1895 to 25 May 1896 exist. She uses calculations based on a published horoscope to derive a date of 11 May 1895 but "retains a measure of scepticism" about it.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (2004), p. 465.&lt;/ref&gt; His birthplace was the small town of [[Madanapalle]] in [[Madras Presidency]] ({{As of|2011|alt=modern-day}} [[Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh|Chittoor District]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]]). He was born in a [[Telugu language|Telugu]]-speaking family. His father, Jiddu Narayaniah, was employed as an official of the British colonial administration. Krishnamurti was fond of his mother Sanjeevamma, who died when he was ten.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975). p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; His parents had a total of eleven children, of whom six survived childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (2004), pp. 471–472.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903 the family settled in [[Kadapa|Cudappah]], where Krishnamurti had contracted [[malaria]] during a previous stay. He would suffer recurrent bouts of the disease over many years.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), pp.2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; A sensitive and sickly child, "vague and dreamy", he was often taken to be intellectually disabled, and was beaten regularly at school by his teachers and at home by his father.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), pp. 3–4, 22, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In memoirs written when he was eighteen years old Krishnamurti described [[psychic]] experiences, such as seeing his sister, who had died in 1904, and his late mother.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1983a), pp. 5, 309&lt;/ref&gt; During his childhood he developed a bond with nature that was to stay with him for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;J. Krishnamurti (2004), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishnamurti's father retired at the end of 1907. Being of limited means he sought employment at the headquarters of the Theosophical Society at Adyar. In addition to being a Brahmin, Narayaniah had been a Theosophist since 1882. He was eventually hired by the Society as a clerk, moving there with his family in January 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1983a), pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Narayaniah and his sons were at first assigned to live in a small cottage which was located just outside the society's compound.&lt;ref&gt;''Star In The East: The Invention of A Messiah'', by [[Roland Vernon]], Palgrave 2001, p 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovered===
In April 1909, Krishnamurti first met [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], who claimed [[clairvoyance]]. Leadbeater had noticed Krishnamurti on the Society's beach on the Adyar river, and was amazed by the "most wonderful [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] he had ever seen, without a particle of selfishness in it."{{efn|According to [[occult]] and Theosophical lore, auras are invisible emanations related to each individual's so-called [[Subtle body|subtler planes of existence]], as well as her or his normal plane. The ability to discern a person's aura is considered one of the possible effects of clairvoyance. Leadbeater's occult knowledge and abilities were highly respected within the Society.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), pp. 15, 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Ernest Wood]], an adjutant of Leadbeaters at the time, who helped Krishnamurti with his homework, considered him to be "particularly dim-witted".&lt;ref name="Lutyens1975p21"&gt;Lutyens (1975), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Leadbeater was convinced that the boy would become a spiritual teacher and a great [[orator]]; the likely "vehicle for the [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Lord Maitreya]]" in Theosophical [[doctrine]], an advanced spiritual entity periodically appearing on Earth as a World Teacher to guide the evolution of humankind.&lt;ref name="Lutyens1975p21" /&gt;

In her biography of Krishnamurti [[Pupul Jayakar]] quotes him speaking of that period in his life some 75 years later: "The boy had always said "I will do whatever you want". There was an element of subservience, obedience. The boy was vague, uncertain, [[wikt:woolly-minded#Adjective|woolly]]; he didn't seem to care what was happening. He was like a vessel with a large hole in it, whatever was put in, went through, nothing remained."&lt;ref&gt;Pupul (1986), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his discovery by Leadbeater, Krishnamurti was nurtured by the Theosophical Society in Adyar. Leadbeater and a small number of trusted associates undertook the task of educating, protecting, and generally preparing Krishnamurti as the "vehicle" of the expected World Teacher. Krishnamurti (often later called ''Krishnaji'')&lt;ref&gt;Jayakar (1986), p. xi. The suffix&amp;nbsp;–ji in Hindu names is a sign of affection or respect.&lt;/ref&gt; and his younger brother Nityananda (''Nitya'') were privately tutored at the Theosophical compound in Madras, and later exposed to a comparatively opulent life among a segment of European [[High society (social class) |high society]] as they continued their education abroad. Despite his history of problems with schoolwork and concerns about his capacities and physical condition, the 14-year-old Krishnamurti was able to speak and write competently in English within six months.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon (2001), pp. 51–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Lutyens says that later in life Krishnamurti came to view his "discovery" as a life-saving event. When he was asked in later life what he thought would have happened to him if he had not been 'discovered' by Leadbeater he would unhesitatingly reply "I would have died".&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time Krishnamurti had developed a strong bond with Annie Besant and came to view her as a surrogate mother. His father, who had initially assented to Besant's [[legal guardian]]ship of Krishnamurti,&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; was pushed into the background by the swirl of attention around his son. In 1912 he sued Besant to annul the guardianship agreement. After a protracted legal battle Besant took custody of Krishnamurti and Nitya.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), pp. 54–63, 64–71, 82, 84.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this separation from family and home Krishnamurti and his brother (whose relationship had always been very close) became more dependent on each other, and in the following years often travelled together.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), pp. 3, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911 the Theosophical Society established the Order of the Star in the East (OSE) to prepare the world for the expected appearance of the World Teacher. Krishnamurti was named as its head, with senior Theosophists assigned various other positions. Membership was open to anybody who accepted the doctrine of the ''Coming of the World Teacher''. Controversy soon erupted, both within the Theosophical Society and outside it, in Hindu circles and the Indian press.{{efn|Lutyens (1975), pp. 40–63 [cumulative]. The news regarding Krishnamurti and the World Teacher were not universally welcomed by Theosophists and led to upheavals in the Society; Lutyens (1983a), pp. 15–19, 40, 56. Part of the controversy was Leadbeater's role. He had a history of being in the company of young boys–pupils under his spiritual and Theosophical instruction, and there was gossip about child abuse&amp;nbsp;— although no accusations were ever proven.}}

===Growing up===
[[Mary Lutyens]], a biographer and friend of Krishnamurti, says that there was a time when he believed that he was to become the World Teacher after correct spiritual and secular guidance and education.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), p. 10-11, 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Another biographer describes the daily program imposed on him by Leadbeater and his associates, which included rigorous exercise and sports, tutoring in a variety of school subjects, Theosophical and religious lessons, [[yoga]] and meditation, as well as instruction in proper hygiene and in the ways of British society and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon (2001), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time Leadbeater assumed the role of guide in a parallel [[Mysticism|mystical]] instruction of Krishnamurti; the existence and progress of this instruction was at the time known only to a select few.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), "Chapter 4: First Initiation" and "Chapter 5: First Teaching" pp. 29–46 [cumulative].&lt;/ref&gt;

While he showed a natural aptitude in sports, Krishnamurti always had problems with formal schooling and was not academically inclined. He eventually gave up university education after several attempts at admission. He did take to foreign languages, in time speaking several with some fluency.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1997), pp. 83, 120, 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

His public image, cultivated by the Theosophists, "was to be characterized by a well-polished exterior, a sobriety of purpose, a cosmopolitan outlook and an otherworldly, almost [[wikt:beatific|beatific]] detachment in his demeanor."&lt;ref name=Vernon2001p53&gt;Vernon (2001), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrably, "all of these can be said to have characterized Krishnamurti's public image to the end of his life."&lt;ref name=Vernon2001p53 /&gt; It was apparently clear early on that he "possessed an innate personal magnetism, not of a warm physical variety, but nonetheless emotive in its austerity, and inclined to inspire veneration."&lt;ref&gt;Vernon (2001), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as he was growing up, Krishnamurti showed signs of adolescent rebellion and emotional instability, chafing at the regimen imposed on him, visibly uncomfortable with the publicity surrounding him, and occasionally expressing doubts about the future prescribed for him.{{efn|Lutyens (1975), "Chapter 10: Doubts and Difficulties" through "Chapter 15: In Love" pp. 80–132 [cumulative].}}

[[File:Annie-Besant-J-Krishnamurti-Ernest-Wood.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Photograph of Krishnamurti with his brother Nitya, Annie Besant, and others in London 1911|Krishnamurti in England in 1911 with his brother Nitya and the Theosophists [[Annie Besant]] and [[George Arundale]]]]
Krishnamurti and Nitya were taken to England in April 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; During this trip Krishnamurti gave his first public speech to members of the OSE in London.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt; His first writings had also started to appear, published in booklets by the Theosophical Society and in Theosophical and OSE-affiliated magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1997), pp. 46, 74–75, 126. Krishnamurti was named Editor of the ''Herald of the Star'', the official bulletin of the OSE. His position was mainly as a figurehead, yet he often wrote editorial notes, which along with his other contributions helped the magazine's circulation.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1911 and the start of [[World War I]] in 1914, the brothers visited several other European countries, always accompanied by Theosophist [[Chaperone (social)|chaperones]].&lt;ref&gt;Vernon (2001), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Krishnamurti had for the first time acquired a measure of personal financial independence, thanks to a wealthy benefactress, American [[Mary Melissa Hoadley Dodge]], who was domiciled in England.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), pp. 4, 75, 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Krishnamurti embarked on a series of lectures, meetings and discussions around the world, related to his duties as the Head of the OSE, accompanied by Nitya, by then the Organizing Secretary of the [[#Order|Order]].&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Krishnamurti also continued writing.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Jiddu Krishnamurti bibliography]].&lt;/ref&gt; The content of his talks and writings, revolved around the work of the Order and of its members in preparation for the ''Coming''. He was described, initially, as a halting, hesitant, and repetitive speaker, but his delivery and confidence improved, and he gradually took command of the meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), pp. 134–35, 171–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 Krishnamurti fell in love with [[Helen Nearing|Helen Knothe]], a 17-year-old American whose family associated with the Theosophists. The experience was tempered by the realisation that his work and expected life-mission precluded what would otherwise be considered normal relationships and by the mid-1920s the two of them had drifted apart.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), pp. 114, 118, 131–132, 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life-altering experiences===
In 1922 Krishnamurti and Nitya travelled from [[Sydney]] to [[California]]. In California they stayed at a cottage in the [[Ojai, California|Ojai Valley]]. It was thought that the area's climate would be beneficial to Nitya, who had been diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]]. Nitya's failing health became a concern for Krishnamurti.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon (2001), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), pp. 149, 199, 209, 216–217.&lt;/ref&gt; At Ojai they met [[Rosalind Rajagopal|Rosalind Williams]], a young American who became close to them both, and who was later to play a significant role in Krishnamurti's life.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1991), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time the brothers were without immediate supervision by their Theosophical Society minders.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon (2001), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; They found the Valley to be very agreeable. Eventually a [[Trust law|trust]], formed by supporters, bought a cottage and surrounding property there for them. This became Krishnamurti's official residence.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1983b), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Ojai in August and September 1922, Krishnamurti went through an intense 'life-changing' experience.&lt;ref&gt;Jayakar (1986), pp. 46–57.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been variously characterised as a spiritual awakening, a psychological transformation, and a physical reconditioning. The initial events happened in two distinct phases: first a three-day [[Religious experience|spiritual experience]], and two weeks later, a longer-lasting condition that Krishnamurti and those around him referred to as ''the process''. This condition recurred, at frequent intervals and with varying intensity, until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon (2001), p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to witnesses it started on 17 August 1922 when Krishnamurti complained of a sharp pain at the nape of his neck. Over the next two days the symptoms worsened, with increasing pain and sensitivity, loss of appetite, and occasional delirious ramblings. He seemed to lapse into unconsciousness, but later recounted that he was very much aware of his surroundings, and that while in that state he had an experience of [[Mysticism#Types of experience|"mystical union"]]. The following day the symptoms and the experience intensified, climaxing with a sense of "immense peace".&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), pp. 158–160.&lt;/ref&gt; Following&amp;nbsp;— and apparently related to&amp;nbsp;— these events&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; the condition that came to be known as ''the process'' started to affect him, in September and October that year, as a regular, almost nightly occurrence. Later the ''process'' resumed intermittently, with varying degrees of pain, physical discomfort and sensitivity, occasionally a lapse into a childlike state, and sometimes an apparent fading out of consciousness, explained as either his body giving in to pain or his mind "going off".{{efn|Lutyens (1975), "Chapter 18: The Turning Point" through "Chapter 21: Climax of the Process" pp. 152–188 [cumulative]. The use of the term "going off" in the accounts of the early occurrences of the process apparently signified so-called [[out-of-body experience]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1990), pp. 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt; In later usage the meaning of "going off" was more nuanced.}}

These experiences were accompanied or followed by what was interchangeably described as, "the benediction," "the immensity," "the sacredness," "the vastness" and, most often, "the otherness" or "the other."&lt;ref name = Lutyens1988&gt;Lutyens, M. (1988). [https://www.scribd.com/doc/12794647/Mary-Lutyens-3-Krishnamurti-The-Open-Door J. Krishnamurti: The Open Door.] Volume 3 of Biography, p. 12. {{ISBN|0-900506-21-0}}. Retrieved on: 19 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a state distinct from the process.&lt;ref name="jkrishnamurti"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jkrishnamurti.org/krishnamurti-teachings/view-text.php?tid=27&amp;chid=319&amp;w=|website=jkrishnamurti.org|title=J. Krishnamurti, Krishnamurti's Notebook, Foreword by Mary Lutyens |access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lutyens it is evident from his notebook that this experience of ''otherness'' was "with him almost continuously" during his life, and gave him "a sense of being protected."&lt;ref name = Lutyens1988 /&gt; Krishnamurti describes it in his notebook as typically following an acute experience of the ''process'', for example, on awakening the next day:
{{quote|... woke up early with that strong feeling of otherness, of another world that is beyond all thought&amp;nbsp;... there is a heightening of sensitivity. Sensitivity, not only to beauty but also to all other things. The blade of grass was astonishingly green; that one blade of grass contained the whole spectrum of colour; it was intense, dazzling and such a small thing, so easy to destroy&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name = Notebook&gt;Krishnamurti, J. (1976). [http://www.jkrishnamurti.org/krishnamurti-teachings/view-text.php?tid=27&amp;chid=68289&amp;w= Krishnamurti's Notebook], Part 3 Gstaad, Switzerland 13th July to 3rd September 1961. J. Krishnamurti online. {{ISBN|1-888004-63-0}}, {{ISBN|978-1-888004-63-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This experience of the ''otherness'' would be present with him in daily events:
{{quote|It is strange how during one or two interviews that strength, that power filled the room. It seemed to be in one's eyes and breath. It comes into being, suddenly and most unexpectedly, with a force and intensity that is quite overpowering and at other times it's there, quietly and serenely. But it's there, whether one wants it or not. There is no possibility of getting used to it for it has never been nor will it ever be&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name = Notebook /&gt;}}

Since the initial occurrences of 1922, several explanations have been proposed for this experience of Krishnamurti's.{{efn|Jayakar (1986), p. 46n. and Lutyens (1975), p. 166 provide a frequently given explanation, that it represented the so-called ''awakening of [[kundalini]]'', a process that according to Hindu mysticism culminates in [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent consciousness]]. Others view it in [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] terms. Aberbach (1993) contends that the experiences were a projection of Krishnamurti's accumulated grief over the death of his mother. Sloss (1993), p. 61 considers the ''process'' to be a purely physical event centred on sickness or trauma, and suggest the possibility of [[Temporal lobe epilepsy#Link with religiosity|epilepsy]], a possibility that Lutyens (1990) rejects. According to Lutyens (1990), pp. 45–46., Krishnamurti believed the ''process'' was necessary for his spiritual development and not a medical matter or condition. As far as he was concerned, he had encountered Truth; he thought the ''process'' was in some way related to this encounter, and to later experiences.}} Leadbeater and other Theosophists expected the "vehicle" to have certain [[paranormal]] experiences, but were nevertheless mystified by these developments.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), pp. 163–4, 188–9.&lt;/ref&gt; During Krishnamurti's later years, the nature and provenance of the continuing ''process'' often came up as a subject in private discussions between himself and associates; these discussions shed some light on the subject, but were ultimately inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Jayakar (1986), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the case, the ''process'', and the inability of Leadbeater to explain it satisfactorily, if at all, had other consequences according to biographer Roland Vernon:

{{quote|The process at Ojai, whatever its cause or validity, was a cataclysmic milestone for Krishna. Up until this time his spiritual progress, chequered though it might have been, had been planned with solemn deliberation by Theosophy's grandees.&amp;nbsp;... Something new had now occurred for which Krishna's training had not entirely prepared him.&amp;nbsp;... A burden was lifted from his conscience and he took his first step towards becoming an individual.&amp;nbsp;... In terms of his future role as a teacher, the process was his bedrock.&amp;nbsp;... It had come to him alone and had not been planted in him by his mentors&amp;nbsp;... it provided Krishna with the soil in which his newfound spirit of confidence and independence could take root.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon (2001), pp. 131–132.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As news of these mystical experiences spread, rumours concerning the [[Messianism|messianic]] status of Krishnamurti reached fever pitch as the 1925 Theosophical Society Convention was planned, on the 50th anniversary of its founding. There were expectations of significant happenings.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Paralleling the increasing adulation was Krishnamurti's growing discomfort with it. In related developments, prominent Theosophists and their factions within the Society were trying to position themselves favourably relative to the ''Coming'', which was widely rumoured to be approaching. "Extraordinary" pronouncements of spiritual advancement were made by various parties, disputed by others, and the internal Theosophical politics further alienated Krishnamurti.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1990), pp. 57–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitya's persistent health problems had periodically resurfaced throughout this time. On 13 November 1925, at age 27, he died in Ojai from complications of [[influenza]] and tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Nitya's poor health, his death was unexpected, and it fundamentally shook Krishnamurti's belief in Theosophy and in the leaders of the Theosophical Society. He had received their assurances regarding Nitya's health, and had come to believe that "Nitya was essential for [his] life-mission and therefore he would not be allowed to die," a belief shared by Annie Besant and Krishnamurti's circle.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), pp. 219, 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Jayakar wrote that "his belief in the Masters and the hierarchy had undergone a total revolution."&lt;ref name=Jayakar1986p69&gt;Jayakar (1986), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Nitya had been the "last surviving link to his family and childhood.&amp;nbsp;... The only person to whom he could talk openly, his best friend and companion."&lt;ref&gt;Vernon (2001), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; According to eyewitness accounts, the news "broke him completely."&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), pp. 220, 313 (note to p. 220).&lt;/ref&gt; but 12 days after Nitya's death he was "immensely quiet, radiant, and free of all sentiment and emotion";&lt;ref name=Jayakar1986p69 /&gt; "there was not a shadow&amp;nbsp;... to show what he had been through."&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Break with the past===
Over the next few years, Krishnamurti's new vision and consciousness continued to develop. New concepts appeared in his talks, discussions, and correspondence, together with an evolving vocabulary that was progressively free of Theosophical terminology.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1983c), p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; His new direction reached a climax in 1929, when he rebuffed attempts by Leadbeater and Besant to continue with the Order of the Star.

Krishnamurti dissolved the Order during the annual [[#OSE|Star Camp]] at [[Ommen]], the [[Netherlands]], on 3 August 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that he had made his decision after "careful consideration" during the previous two years, and that:

{{quote|text=I maintain that truth is a pathless land, and you cannot approach it by any path whatsoever, by any religion, by any sect. That is my point of view, and I adhere to that absolutely and unconditionally. Truth, being limitless, unconditioned, unapproachable by any path whatsoever, cannot be organized; nor should any organization be formed to lead or coerce people along a particular path. ... This is no magnificent deed, because I do not want followers, and I mean this. The moment you follow someone you cease to follow Truth. I am not concerned whether you pay attention to what I say or not. I want to do a certain thing in the world and I am going to do it with unwavering concentration. I am concerning myself with only one essential thing: to set man free. I desire to free him from all cages, from all fears, and not to found religions, new sects, nor to establish new theories and new philosophies.&lt;ref name=Krishnamurti1929 /&gt;}}

[[File:Jiddu Krishnamurti by Witzel.jpg|thumb|Krishnamurti in the early 1920s.]]
Following the dissolution, prominent Theosophists turned against Krishnamurti, including Leadbeater who is said to have stated, "the Coming had gone wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1997), pp. 277–279.&lt;/ref&gt; Krishnamurti had denounced all organised belief, the notion of [[guru]]s, and the whole teacher-follower relationship, vowing instead to work in setting people "absolutely, unconditionally free."&lt;ref name=Krishnamurti1929&gt;J. Krishnamurti (1929).&lt;/ref&gt; There is no record of him explicitly denying he was the World Teacher;&lt;ref&gt;Vernon (2001), pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt; whenever he was asked to clarify his position, he either asserted that the matter was irrelevant,&lt;ref&gt;J. Krishnamurti (1972), p. 9. "I think we shall have incessant wrangles over the corpse of Krishnamurti if we discuss this or that, wondering who is now speaking. Someone asked me: 'Do tell me if it is you speaking or someone else'. I said: 'I really do not know and it does not matter'." From the 1927 "Question and answer session" at Ommen. [Note weblink in reference is ''not'' at official Krishnamurti-related or Theosophical Society website].&lt;/ref&gt; or gave answers that, as he stated, were "purposely vague."&lt;ref&gt;J. Krishnamurti (1928a), p. 43. "I am going to be purposely vague, because although I could quite easily make it definite, it is not my intention to do so. Because once you define a thing it becomes dead." Krishnamurti on the World Teacher, from "Who brings the truth," an address delivered at Ommen 2 August 1927.

In reflection of the ongoing changes in his outlook, he had started doing so before the dissolution of the Order of the Star.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; The subtlety of the new distinctions on the World Teacher issue was lost on many of his admirers, who were already bewildered or distraught because of the changes in Krishnamurti's outlook, vocabulary and pronouncements–among them Besant and Mary Lutyens' mother Emily, who had a very close relationship with him.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon (2001), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; He soon disassociated himself from the Theosophical Society and its teachings and practices,{{efn|Lutyens considers the last remaining tie with Theosophy to have been severed in 1933, with the death of Besant. He had resigned from the Society in 1930 (Lutyens, 1975; pp. 276, 285).}} yet he remained on cordial terms with some of its members and ex-members throughout his life.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Krishnamurti would often refer to the totality of his work as ''the'' teachings and not as ''my'' teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1990), p. 210. Emphasis in source.&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishnamurti resigned from the various trusts and other organisations that were affiliated with the defunct Order of the Star, including the Theosophical Society. He returned the money and properties donated to the Order, among them a castle in the Netherlands and {{convert|5000|acre|ha|0}} of land, to their donors.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens (1975), pp. 276–284.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle years===
From 1930 through 1944, Krishnamurti engaged in speaking tours and in the issue of publications under the auspice of the "''Star Publishing Trust''" (SPT), which he had founded with Desikacharya Rajagopal, a close associate and friend from the ''Order of the Star''.{{efn|Born in India in 1900 and of Brahmin descent, Rajagopal had moved in Krishnamurti's circle since early youth. Although regarded as an excellent editor and organizer, he was also known for his difficult personality and high-handed manner. Upon Nitya's death, he had promised Besant that he would look after Krishnamurti. See Henri Methorst, ''Krishnamurti A Spiritual Revolutionary'', Edwin Publishing House, 2003, ch 12.}} Ojai was the base of operations for the new enterprise, where Krishnamurti, Rajagopal, and Rosalind Williams (who had married Rajagopal in 1927) resided in the house known as ''Arya Vihara'' (meaning ''Realm of the Aryas i.e. those noble by righteousness'' in [[Sanskrit]]). The business and organizational aspects of the SPT were administered chiefly by D. Rajagopal, as Krishnamurti devoted his time to speaking and meditation. The Rajagopals' marriage was not a happy one, and the two became physically estranged after the 1931 birth of their daughter, Radha.&lt;ref&gt;''Lives in the Shadow with J. Krishnamurti'' by Radha Rajagopal Sloss, Bloomsbury Publishing, 1991, ch 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In the relative seclusion of ''Arya Vihara'', Krishnamurti's close friendship with Rosalind deepened into a love affair which was not made public until 1991. According to Radha Rajagopal Sloss, the long affair between Krishnamurti and Rosalind began in 1932 and it endured for about twenty-five years. {{efn|The two also shared an interest in education: Krishnamurti helped to raise Radha, and the need to provide her with a suitable educational environment led to the founding of the ''Happy Valley School'' in 1946. The school has since re-established itself as an independent institution operating as the [http://www.besanthill.org/ Besant Hill School Of Happy Valley]. See Sloss, "Lives in the Shadow," ch 19.}}{{efn|Radha's account of the relationship, ''Lives in the Shadow With J. Krishnamurti'', was first published in England by Bloomsbury Publishing Ltd. in 1991, and was soon followed by a rebuttal volume written by Mary Lutyens, ''Krishnamurti and the Rajagopals'', Krishnamurti Foundation of America, 1996, in which she acknowledges the relationship.}}

During the 1930s, Krishnamurti spoke in Europe, Latin America, India, Australia and the United States. In 1938, he met [[Aldous Huxley]].&lt;ref&gt;Vernon, "Star in the East," p 205.&lt;/ref&gt; The two began a close friendship which endured for many years. They held common concerns about the imminent conflict in Europe which they viewed as the outcome of the pernicious influence of nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.journal.kfionline.org/issue-1/aldous-huxley-and-krishnamurti | title = 
Journal of the Krishnamurti Schools | accessdate = 2018-06-04}} &lt;/ref&gt; Krishnamurti's stance on [[World War II]] was often construed as pacifism and even [[subversion]] during a time of patriotic fervor in the United States and for a time he came under the surveillance of the [[FBI]].&lt;ref&gt;Vernon, "Star in the East," p 209.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not speak publicly for a period of about four years (between 1940 and 1944). During this time he lived and worked at ''Arya Vihara'', which during the war operated as a largely self-sustaining farm, with its surplus goods donated for relief efforts in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon, "Star in the East," p 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the years spent in Ojai during the war, he later said: "I think it was a period of no challenge, no demand, no outgoing. I think it was a kind of everything held in; and when I left Ojai it all burst."&lt;ref&gt;Jayakar, "Krishnamurti" p 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishnamurti broke the hiatus from public speaking in May 1944 with a series of talks in Ojai. These talks, and subsequent material, were published by "''Krishnamurti Writings Inc''" (KWINC), the successor organisation to the "''Star Publishing Trust''." This was to be the new central Krishnamurti-related entity worldwide, whose sole purpose was the dissemination of the teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens, "Fulfillment," Farrar, Straus hardcover, p 59-60. Initially, Krishnamurti (along with Rajagopal and others) was a trustee of KWINC. Eventually he ceased being a trustee, leaving Rajagopal as President–a turn of events that according to Lutyens, constituted ''"... a circumstance that was to have most unhappy consequences."''&lt;/ref&gt; He had remained in contact with associates from India, and in the autumn of 1947 embarked on a speaking tour there, attracting a new following of young intellectuals.{{efn|These included former freedom campaigners from the Indian Independence Movement, See Vernon, "Star in the East," p 219.}} On this trip he encountered the Mehta sisters, Pupul and Nandini, who became lifelong associates and confidants. The sisters also attended to Krishnamurti throughout a 1948 recurrence of the ''"process"'' in [[Ooty|Ootacamund]].&lt;ref&gt;See Jayakar, "Krishnamurti," ch 11 for Pupul Mehta's (later Jayakar) eyewitness account.&lt;/ref&gt;

When in India after World War II, many prominent personalities came to meet Krishnamurti, including Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]. In his meetings with Nehru, Krishnamurti elaborated at length on the teachings, saying in one instance, "Understanding of the self only arises in relationship, in watching yourself in relationship to people, ideas, and things; to trees, the earth, and the world around you and within you. Relationship is the mirror in which the self is revealed. Without self-knowledge there is no basis for right thought and action." Nehru asked, "How does one start?" to which Krishnamurti replied, "Begin where you are. Read every word, every phrase, every paragraph of the mind, as it operates through thought."&lt;ref&gt;Jayakar, "Krishnamurti," p 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
Krishnamurti continued speaking in public lectures, group discussions and with concerned individuals around the world. In the early 1960s, he made the acquaintance of physicist [[David Bohm]], whose philosophical and scientific concerns regarding the [[essence]] of the physical world, and the psychological and sociological state of mankind, found parallels in Krishnamurti's philosophy. The two men soon became close friends and started a common inquiry, in the form of personal dialogues–and occasionally in group discussions with other participants–that continued, periodically, over nearly two decades.{{efn|Bohm would eventually serve as a [[#External links|Krishnamurti Foundation]] trustee.}} Several of these discussions were published in the form of books or as parts of books, and introduced a wider audience (among scientists) to Krishnamurti's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#List of Books|Selected Publications/List of Books]] subsection.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Krishnamurti's philosophy delved into fields as diverse as religious studies, education, psychology, physics, and consciousness studies, he was not then, nor since, well known in academic circles. Nevertheless, Krishnamurti met and held discussions with physicists [[Fritjof Capra]] and [[E. C. George Sudarshan]], biologist [[Rupert Sheldrake]], psychiatrist David Shainberg, as well as psychotherapists representing various theoretical orientations.&lt;ref&gt;See ''On Krishnamurti'', by Raymond Martin, Wadsworth, 2003, for a discussion on Krishnamurti and the academic world.&lt;/ref&gt; The long friendship with Bohm went through a rocky interval in later years, and although they overcame their differences and remained friends until Krishnamurti's death, the relationship did not regain its previous intensity.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}{{efn|Their falling out was partly due to questions about Krishnamurti's private behaviour, especially his long and secret love affair with Rosalind Williams-Rajagopal, then unknown to the general public.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}}}{{efn|After their falling out, Bohm criticised certain aspects of the teaching on philosophical, [[Methodology|methodological]], and psychological grounds. He also criticised what he described as Krishnamurti's occasional "verbal manipulations" when deflecting challenges. Eventually, he questioned some of the reasoning about the nature of thought and self, although he never abandoned his belief that "Krishnamurti was on to something". See ''Infinite Potential: The Life and times of David Bohm'', by [[F. David Peat]], Addison Wesley, 1997.}}

In the 1970s, Krishnamurti met several times with then Indian prime minister [[Indira Gandhi]], with whom he had far ranging, and in some cases, very serious discussions. Jayakar considers his message in meetings with Indira Gandhi as a possible influence in the lifting of certain emergency measures Gandhi had imposed during periods of political turmoil.&lt;ref&gt;See Jayakar, "Krishnamurti" pages 340–343.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Krishnamurti's once close relationship with the Rajagopals had deteriorated to the point where he took D. Rajagopal to court to recover donated property and funds as well as publication rights for his works, manuscripts, and personal correspondence, that were in Rajagopal's possession.{{efn|D. Rajagopal was the head or co-head of a number of successive corporations and trusts, set up after the dissolution of the ''Order of the Star'' and chartered to publish Krishnamurti's talks, discussions and other writings.}} The litigation and ensuing cross complaints, which formally began in 1971, continued for many years. Much property and materials were returned to Krishnamurti during his lifetime; the parties to this case finally settled all other matters in 1986, shortly after his death.{{efn|''Formation of the Krishnamurti Foundation of America and the Lawsuits Which Took Place Between 1968 and 1986 to Recover Assets for Krishnamurti's Work'', by Erna Lilliefelt, Krishnamurti Foundation of America, 1995. The complicated settlement dissolved the ''K &amp; R Foundation'' (a previous entity), and transferred assets to the ''Krishnamurti Foundation of America'' (KFA). However certain disputed documents remained in the possession of Rajagopal, and he received partial repayment for his attorney's fees.}}

In 1984 and 1985, Krishnamurti spoke to an invited audience at the United Nations in New York, under the auspices of the [[Pacem in terris|Pacem in Terris Society]] chapter at the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens, "The Open Door," p 84-85. Also Lutyens, "The Life and Death of Krishnamurti," p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1985, he visited India for the last time, holding a number of what came to be known as "farewell" talks and discussions between then and January 1986. These last talks included the fundamental questions he had been asking through the years, as well as newer concerns about advances in science and technology, and their effect on humankind. Krishnamurti had commented to friends that he did not wish to invite death, but was not sure how long his body would last (he had already lost considerable weight), and once he could no longer talk, he would have "no further purpose". In his final talk, on 4 January 1986, in Madras, he again invited the audience to examine with him the nature of [[inquiry]], the effect of technology, the nature of life and meditation, and the nature of [[Creation myth|creation]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Krishnamurti was also concerned about his legacy, about being unwittingly turned into some personage whose teachings had been handed down to special individuals, rather than the world at large. He did not want anybody to pose as an interpreter of the teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens, "Fulfilment," Farrar, Straus hardcover, p 171, statement of Krishnamurti published in the Foundation Bulletin, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; He warned his associates on several occasions that they were not to present themselves as spokesmen on his behalf, or as his successors after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens, "Fulfilment," Farrar, Straus hardcover, p 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days before his death, in a final statement, he declared that nobody among either his associates or the general public had understood what had happened to him (as the conduit of the teaching). He added that the "supreme intelligence" operating in his body would be gone with his death, again implying the impossibility of successors. However, he stated that people could perhaps get into touch with that somewhat "if they live the teachings".&lt;ref&gt;See Lutyens, "The Life and Death of Krishnamurti," London: John Murray, p 206. Quoting Krishnamurti from tape-recording made on 7 February 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; In prior discussions, he had compared himself with [[Thomas Edison]], implying that he did the hard work, and now all that was needed by others was a flick of the switch.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens, "Fulfilment" Farrar, Straus hardcover, p 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishnamurti died of [[pancreatic cancer]] on 17 February 1986, at the age of 90. His remains were cremated. The [http://www.meditativediaries.com/jiddu-krishnamurti/ announcement] of KFT (Krishnamurti Foundation Trust) refers to the course of his health condition till the moment of death. The first signs came almost nine months before his death, when he felt very tired. In October 1985 he went from England (Brockwood Park School) to India and since then he was feeling exhausted, losing weight and having fever. Krishnamurti decided to go back to Ojai (10 January 1986) after his last talks in Madras, which made it necessary to have a 24-hour flight. Once he arrived at Ojai he underwent medical tests that revealed he was suffering from pancreatic cancer. This cancer wasn't treatable either surgically or otherwise, so Krishnamurti decided to go back to his home at Ojai, where he spent his last days. Krishnamurti was nursed by friends and professionals. His mind was clear till the very last moments. Krishnamurti died on 17 February 1986, ten minutes past midnight California time.

==Schools==
Krishnamurti founded several schools around the world, including [[Brockwood Park School]], an international educational center. When asked, he enumerated the following as his educational aims:
#''Global outlook'': A vision of the whole as distinct from the part; there should never be a [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] outlook, but always a holistic outlook free from all prejudice.
#''Concern for man and the environment'': Humanity is part of nature, and if nature is not cared for, it will [[boomerang]] on man. Only the right education, and deep affection between people everywhere, will resolve many problems including the environmental challenges.
#''Religious spirit, which includes the scientific temper'': The religious mind is alone, not lonely. It is in communion with people and nature.&lt;ref&gt;See ''As The River Joins The Ocean: Reflections about J. Krishnamurti'', by Giddu Narayan, Edwin House Publishing 1999, p 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Krishnamurti Foundation]], established in 1928 by him and Annie Besant, runs many schools in India and abroad.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Criticism==
Ex-girlfriend [[Helen Nearing]], who had known Krishnamurti in the 1920s, said that Krishnamurti's attitudes were conditioned by privilege, because he had been supported, even pampered, by devoted followers from the time of his "discovery" by the theosophists. She also said that he was at such an "elevated" level that he was incapable of forming "normal personal relationships".&lt;ref&gt;Nearing, Helen (1992). ''Loving and Leaving the Good Life'', White River Junction, Vermont: Chelsea Green.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory John Tillett's extensive biography of Leadbeater describes his mentoring of Krishnamurti and Nityananda. He includes Leadbeater's passing off some of his own writings as those of Krishnamurti, his indoctrination of the boys in his own version of theosophical cosmogony, and his grooming of Krishnamurti as a World Teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory John Tillett, [http://leadbeater.org/tillettcwlcontents.htm Charles Webster Leadbeater 1854-1934: A Biographical Study]. Entire text online, and published by Routledge, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Krishnamurti attracted the interest of the mainstream religious establishment in India. He engaged in discussions with several well known Hindu and Buddhist scholars and leaders, including the [[Dalai Lama]].{{efn| The Dalai Lama characterised Krishnamurti as a ''"great soul"'' (Jayakar, "Krishnamurti" p 203). Krishnamurti very much enjoyed the Lama's company and by his own admission could not bring up his anti-guru views, mindful of the Lama's feelings.}} Several of these discussions were later published as chapters in various Krishnamurti books. Those influenced by Krishnamurti include [[Toni Packer]], [[Achyut Patwardhan]],&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-achyut-patwardhan-1541827.html|title=Obituary: Achyut Patwardhan|website=The Independent|access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Dada Dharmadhikari]].&lt;ref name="mkgandhi-sarvodaya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mkgandhi-sarvodaya.org/dharma/dharmabio.htm|website=mkgandhi-sarvodaya.org|title=Dada Dharmadhikari Biography|access-date=28 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109114350/http://mkgandhi-sarvodaya.org/dharma/dharmabio.htm|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bruce Lee]].

Interest in Krishnamurti and his work has persisted in the years since his death. Many books, audio, video, and computer materials, remain in print and are carried by major online and traditional retailers. The four official Foundations continue to maintain archives, disseminate the teachings in an increasing number of languages, convert print to digital and other media, develop websites, sponsor television programs, and organise meetings and dialogues of interested persons around the world.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://www.ereleases.com/pr/20040701001.html ''The Complete Teachings Project''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202071949/http://ereleases.com/pr/20040701001.html |date=2 February 2009}}, an ambitious effort to collect the entire body of Krishnamurti's work into a coherently edited master reference.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3788">A festival said to be of  '''Juno Februata''' or '''Juno Februa''', though it does not appear in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', was described by [[Alban Butler]], famous as the author of ''Butler's Lives of Saints'', who presented an aspect of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Lupercalia]] as a festival of a "Juno Februata", under the heading of February 14:

:"To abolish the heathens lewd superstitious custom of boys drawing the names of girls, in honour of their goddess Februata Juno, on the fifteenth of this month, several zealous pastors substituted the names of saints in billets, given on this day."&lt;ref&gt;Butler, ''Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs and Other Principal Saints'' London, 1756-59,  quoted in Jack B. Oruch, "St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February", ''Speculum'' '''56'''.3 (July 1981, pp. 534-565), p 539.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack Oruch, who noted Butler's  inventive confusion,&lt;ref&gt;"Butler's ideas were prompted, in all probability, by a confused knowledge of the date of this isolated event; a less charitable explanation would attribute his remarks to wishful or pious fantasy." (Oruch 1981:539).&lt;/ref&gt; noted that it was  embellished by Francis Douce, in ''Illustrations of Shakespeare, and of Ancient Manners'', new ed. London, 1839, p 470, who took such a festival for the Lupercalia, which was celebrated, he asserted,
:"during a great art of the month of February.... in honour of [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]... On this occasion, amidst a variety of ceremonies, the names of young women were put into a box, from which they were drawn by the men as chance directed."  Douce repeated Butler's description of the attempt to substitute saint's names, and concluded that "as the festival of the ''Lupercalia'' had commenced about the middle of February, [the Christians] appear to have chosen Saint Valentine's day for celebrating the new feast; because it occurred nearly at the same time"&lt;ref&gt;Also quoted in Oruch 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

The connection thus begun has been uncritically repeated to the modern day: but see [[Valentine's Day]] and [[Saint Valentine]].

The [[epithet]] or divine [[cognomen]] of Juno Purified and Purifying, ''Juno Februata, Februlis, Februta'' or ''Februalis'' is noted in William Smith, (1870) 1898. ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology''&lt;ref&gt;Vol. 2, p 658 [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1766.html On-line text].&lt;/ref&gt; with a reference to [[Sextus Pompeius Festus]] ''Februarius'', to [[Ovid]]'s poem on the Roman festivals, ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', ii.441, which however refers to Juno Lucina in the context of restoring the fertility of Roman women&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Fasti'', ii ([http://www.theoi.com/Text/OvidFasti2.html on-line text]).&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Arnobius]]' sarcastic fourth-century attack on pagan customs, ''Adversus Nationes''&lt;ref&gt;Arnobius, iii.30, noted in Smith 1898: sub "Februus".&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective ''februata'' is unusual and highly specific, unlike  broader, more familiar Latin terms: Ovid was at pains to elucidate ''februa'' in ''Fasti''. "The narrowness of meaning in ''febrare'', no synonym of ''purgare'' or even of ''lustrare'' suggests borrowing, an importation which never had a place in the popular language," Joshua Whatmough remarked,&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Whatmough, "The Calendar in Ancient Italy outside Rome," ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' '''42''' (1931, pp. 157-179) p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; and he noted that [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]]&lt;ref&gt;''De lingua latina'' vi.12.&lt;/ref&gt; considered it [[Sabine]] in origin.

'''Karl Mayländer''' (died early 1940s) was a Jewish businessman and [[art collector]] who was deported from Vienna to Lodz, in German occupied Poland, by the Nazis during the Second World War and later died in the Holocaust.

Mayländer was an art collector and critic who was a member of the board of the Volksheim Ottakring (later the [[Volkshochschule Ottakring]]), an adult education school which also hosted art exhibitions. Mayländer acquired the work of many young Austrian artists, including many drawings by [[Egon Schiele]] whom he knew personally.&lt;ref&gt;''Egon Schiele: The Ronald S. Lauder and Serge Sabarsky collections''. Prestel Publishing, 2005. p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art by Schiele owned by Mayländer has been the subject of restitution claims by his descendant in New York, Eva Zirkl, and in 2016 the [[Leopold Museum]] in Vienna agreed to return two watercolour paintings by Schiele to Zirkl.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.at/20160407/austrian-museum-returns-nazi-plundered-artwork Austrian museum returns Nazi plundered artwork.] The Local/AFP, 7 April 2016.

The '''Kedah Sultanate''' is a [[History of Islam|Muslim dynasty]] located in the [[Malay Peninsula]]. Originally an independent state, it became a [[British Protectorate]] in 1909. Its [[monarchy]] was abolished after it was added to the [[Malayan Union]] but was [[Kedah|restored]] and added to the Malayan Union's successor, the [[Federation of Malaya]].

The information regarding the formation  of this sultanate and the history before and after its creation comes from the "[[Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa|Kedah Annals]]". The Kedah Annals were written in the eighteenth century, over a millennium after the formation of the Kedah Kingdom. It describes the first king of Kedah as arriving on the shores of Kedah as a result of an attack by a mythical gigantic beast. It states that the nation was founded by the offspring of [[Alexander the Great]]; who maintained ties with [[Roman Empire|Rome]] throughout his reign (oddly two centuries after the [[decline of the Roman Empire]] due to sacks by the Visigoths and Vandals in 410 and 455).

The Kedah Annals also provide us with very unreliable information regarding the sultans of Kedah. Listing the first sultan of Kedah as [[Sultan Mudzafar Shah I]] centuries before the partitioning of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] into distinct sultanates and almost three centuries prior to the contradictory claims of the [[Terengganu Inscription Stone]]. This claim also directly contradicts the fact that the Buddhist [[Srivijaya]] kingdom was in direct control of Kedah at the time that Sultan Mudzafar Shah I allegedly converted the region to a sultanate.

==History==
{{Main|History of Kedah}}
[[Image:Kedah001.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Map of the early Kadaha kingdom and the [[Early transpeninsular routeway]] ]] [[Image:LangkasukaBuddha001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ancient artefact found in Kedah]]
Around 170&amp;nbsp;CE a group of native refugees of [[Hindu]] faith arrived at Kedah, joining them soon were peoples from nearby islands and from the northern [[Mon-Khmer]] region.{{citation needed|reason=What historical evidence exists for this claim|date=January 2015}} Ancient Kedah covered the areas of [[Kuala Bahang]], [[Kuala Bara]], [[Kuala Pila]] and [[Merpah]], and the inhabitants of Kedah appointed Tun Derma Dewa and Tun Perkasa as their village chiefs.

===The king from Gemeron===
In 630&amp;nbsp;CE, Maharaja Derbar Raja of Gemeron (now known as [[Bandar Abbas]]) in [[Persia]] was defeated in battle and escaped to [[Sri Lanka]], and he was later blown off course by a storm to the remote shores of [[Kuala Sungai Qilah]], Kedah.{{citation needed|reason=This statement is identical to that found in the Kedah Annals which lists the source of his course departure as a mythical beast.  Regardless, why is an 18th century source reliable?|date=January 2015}}  The inhabitants of Kedah found him to be a valiant and intelligent person, and they made him the king of Kedah. In 634&amp;nbsp;CE, a new kingdom was formed in Kedah consisting of Persian royalty and native [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] of Hindu faith, the capital was [[Langkasuka]].{{citation needed|reason=Incorrect, the original source, Kedah Annals, lists his qualification as being a descendant of Alexander the great, not personal aptitude|date=January 2015}}

===Conversion to Islam===
Based on the account given in ''[[Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa]]'' (also known as the ''Kedah Annals''), the [[Sultanate of Kedah]] started in year 1136 when King [[Sultan Mudzafar Shah I|Phra Ong Mahawangsa]] converted to Islam and adopted the name Sultan Mudzafar Shah. However, an Acehnese account gave a date of 1474 for the year of conversion to Islam by the ruler of Kedah. This later date accords with an account in the ''[[Malay Annals]]'' where a raja of Kedah visited Malacca during the reign of its last sultan seeking the honour of the royal band that marks the sovereignty of a Muslim ruler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=41559857|title= Notes on the History of Kedah |first=Richard |last=Winstedt|journal=Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society |volume= 14|number= 3 (126) |date=December 1936|pages= 155&amp;ndash;189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British colonization on Penang and Seberang Perai===

In 1770, [[Francis Light]] was ordered by the [[East India Company|British East India Company]](BEIC) to take [[Penang]] from Kedah. He achieved this by giving assurance to [[Muhammad Jiwa Zainal Adilin II of Kedah|Sultan Muhammad Jiwa Zainal Adilin II]] that his army will protect Kedah from any Siamese invasion. In return, the Sultan agree to hand over Pinang to the British. In 1786, Light negotiated with the new Sultan of Kedah [[Abdullah Mukarram Shah|Sultan Abdullah Mukarram Shah]] over the [[cession]] of Pinang to BEIC.&lt;ref name=":303" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":114"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cities in Motion: Urban Life and Cosmopolitanism in Southeast Asia, 1920–1940|last=Lewis|first=Su Lin|publisher=[[Cambridge University]]|year=2016|isbn=9781107108332|location=[[United Kingdom]]|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Light made the agreement without the consent of his superiors in India. BEIC did not provide military support, as promised by Light, when Siam attacked Kedah. In 1790, Sultan Abdullah planned to launch an amphibious invasion of the Island of Pinang to recapture it. The BEIC made a [[preemptive strike]] and attacked Kedah's navy and fort, damaging them. The Sultan signed a ceasefire agreement in 1791 with Light. On 6 June 1800, [[George Alexander William Leith]] and Sultan Dziaddin Mukarram Shah II signed a peace agreement and allowed the BEIC to occupy [[Seberang Perai]] and name it as ''Province Wellesley''. In exchange for the acquisition, the annual payment to the Sultan of Kedah was increased to 10,000 [[Spanish dollar]]s per annum. To this day, the [[Government of Malaysia|Malaysian federal government]] still pays Kedah, on behalf of Penang, RM 10,000 annually as a symbolic gesture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/unconstitutional-to-wipe-penang-off-malaysias-map-kedah-told|title=Unconstitutional to wipe Penang off Malaysia’s map, Kedah told|last=|first=|date=11 February 2017|work=[[Malay Mail]]|access-date=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partition of Kedah===

After the death of [[Abdullah Mukarram Shah of Kedah| Sultan Abdullah Mukarram Shah]] the 20th Sultan of Kedah in 1797, the thrones were given to his half brother [[Dziaddin Mukarram Shah II of Kedah|Sultan Dziaddin Mukarram Shah II]]. However Sultan Dziaddin was forced to [[abdicate]] in 1803 by the King of Siam and was replaced by his nephew Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin II. This sparked a succession crisis as crown prince, Tunku Bisnu claimed to be the rightful heir to the throne. Fearing civil war, the Siamese Kingdom reconciled the two parties by appointing Tunku Bisnu as ruler of Setul, thus establishing the [[Setul| Kingdom of Setul Mambang Segara]] in 1808.&lt;ref name="MyKedah 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|MyKedah|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892, the kingdom was reunified with Kedah Sultanate. However the assimilation of Siamese people and culture in Setul had weakened Kedah rule over it. The [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909|Anglo-Siamese Treaty]] in 1909 finally ended Kedah rule over Setul, as the Siamese and British agreed to exclude Setul from Kedah jurisdiction, thus separating Kedah and Setul.

==List of rulers==
The list of rulers of Kedah as given here is based to some extent on the ''Kedah Annals'' beginning with the Hindu ruler Durbar Raja I. According to the ''Kedah Annals'', the 9th Kedah Maharaja Derbar Raja converted to Islam and changed his name to Sultan Muzaffar Shah, thereby started the Kedah Sultanate.&lt;ref name="durbar"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Kedah: Intro and Background|url=http://go2travelmalaysia.com/tour_malaysia/kdh_bckgnd.htm|publisher=Capslock Sdn Bhd|work=Go2Travelmalaysia.com|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The historicity and the dating of the list of rulers however is questionable as Kedah may have remained Hindu-Buddhist until the 15th century when its king converted to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mykedah2.com/e_10heritage/e101_1_p4.htm |title=The Development of Kedah's Early History Based on Archeological Finds |work=MyKedah }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindu era===
The following is a list of kings of Kadaram, nine in total. Each used the Hindu title of ''[[Sri]] [[Paduka]] [[Maharaja]]''. The exact dates of each king's reign are not known.

:&lt;small&gt;Source for the list of sultans is the Muzium Negeri Kedah, [[Alor Setar]], Malaysia. "The sultans of Kedah".&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royalark.net/Malaysia/kedah2.htm|title=Kedah Genealogy|publisher=royalark.net|accessdate=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic era===
The beginning of the use of the title ''[[sultan]]'' in Kedah is attributed to a visit by a Muslim scholar from [[Yemen]], Sheikh Abdullah bin Ja'afar Quamiri, to Durbar Raja II's [[Istana|palace]] at Bukit Mariam in 1136.{{citation needed|reason=source please|date=January 2015}} The audience resulted in the king's conversion to Islam. He adopted the name "[[Mudzaffar Shah I of Kedah|Mudzaffar Shah]]" and established the sultanate of Kedah, which continues to rule today.&lt;ref name="durbar"/&gt;

The source for the list of sultans given here is the official genealogy given for the Sultan of Kedah.&lt;ref name="genealogy"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kedah State Public Library|title=The genealogy of His Highnesses|url=http://www.mykedah2.com/raja_kita/eng/040000.htm|work=Our Sultan|year=2003|accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are however discrepancies with the ''Kedah Annals'' as it lists only 5 sultans from the first convert Mudzaffar Shah to Sulaiman Shah who was captured by Aceh in 1619, in contrast to the twelve listed here.  The rest of the list largely follows as that given in the ''Kedah Annals'' with the exception of a few changes and more recent updates in the 20th and 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor= 41559921 |title=The Kedah Annals |author=R.

===Nobat===
The Nobat musical instruments of Nagara and Nepiri were introduced to Kedah by Maharaja Derbar Raja. The instrument is also called semambu. The band is led by the king, and it consists of drums, a gong, a flute and a trumpet. Today, Nobat is a Royal orchestra, played only during royal ceremonies such as inaugurations, weddings, and funerals. The building which houses the instruments and where the ensemble rehearses is known as the Balai Nobat, literally the Office of Nobat, in [[Alor Setar]] city proper.

The '''''Khalsa Akhbar''''' ({{lang-pa|ਖ਼ਾਲਸਾ ਅਖ਼ਬਾਰ}} &lt;small&gt;([[Gurmukhi]])&lt;/small&gt;, {{Nastaliq|خالصہ اخبار}} &lt;small&gt;([[Shahmukhi]])&lt;/small&gt;), [[Lahore]], was a [[weekly newspaper]] and the organ of the ''Lahore Khalsa Diwan'', a [[Sikh]] society. Published from [[Lahore]] in the [[Punjabi language]] (Gurmukhi script), the newspaper was established in 1886 and functioned sporadically till 1905.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=u_AMX5RI_YUC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=Khalsa+Akhbar+Lahore&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bXhvsW2mB4&amp;sig=UNuez1IW7UhWJDL-WhDEKO5PZ3s&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uN7YSpKfO5DqsQO0koCRBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Khalsa%20Akhbar%20Lahore&amp;f=false Khalsa Akhbar, Lahore] ''Religion and Nationalism in India: the case of the Punjab'', by Harnik Deol.

==History==
The newspaper was published with effect from 12 June 1886 through the efforts of Bhai Gurmukh Singh from Lahore. It was a weekly [[newspaper]] of [[Khalsa Diwan]] Society being published in [[Lithography]] and in [[Gurmukhi script]]. Its first two editors were Giani [[Jhanda Singh]] [[Faridkot, Punjab|Faridkot]] and Sardar [[Basant Singh (editor)|Basant Singh]]. Later on, it was handed over to Bhai [[Giani Ditt Singh|Ditt Singh]] Giani. The newspaper continued to be published till 1889. After this its publication stopped for sometime due to a legal suit filed by the [[Amritsar]]i party regarding the publication of a play called ''Swapan''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikh-history.com/sikhhist/personalities/literature/dittsingh.html Biography of Giani Ditt Singh] sikh-history.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esikhs.com/articles/giani_ditt_singh.htm Giani Ditt Singh Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

It resumed publication again on 1 May 1893 with [[Giani Ditt Singh]] as its editor. An experienced scholar and an expert in debates and discussions, he entered into many heated debates with champions of [[Arya Samaj]].

Giani Dit Singh was an excellent writer of [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] prose and poetry and wrote many of his editorials in verse. He was the right-hand man of Bhai Gurmukh Singh and one of the pillars of [[Singh Sabha]] Lahore. He died in 1901. After him, Sardar Maeeya Singh Ahluwalia became the editor of ''Khalsa Akhbar'' and continued till 1905. The newspaper ceased publication after the dissolution of Singh Sabha [[Lahore]] and due to some other reasons.

[[File:Bhaktapur Kumari.jpg|thumb|Sajani Shakya, a former Kumari of [[Bhaktapur]], Nepal, during her June 2007 visit to the United States to the Film Festival [[Silverdocs]].]]
'''Kumari''', or '''Kumari Devi''', or '''Living Goddess – Nepal''' is the tradition of worshipping young pre-pubescent girls as manifestations of the divine female energy or [[devi]] in [[Hindu]] religious traditions. The word ''[[Kumar]]i'' is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] ''Kaumarya'', meaning "princess".&lt;ref&gt;Karel R. "van" Kooij ''Religion in Nepal'' {{ISBN|90-04-05827-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nepal, a Kumari is a pre-pubescent girl selected from the [[Shakya |Shakya caste]] or [[Bajracharya]] clan of the Nepalese [[Newa people|Newari]] community.  The Kumari is revered and worshipped by some of the country's [[Hinduism|Hindus]]. 
While there are several Kumaris throughout Nepal, with some cities having several, the best known is the '''Royal Kumari''' of [[Kathmandu]], and she lives in the [[Kumari Ghar]], a palace in the center of the city.  The selection process for her is especially rigorous.  As of 2017, the Royal Kumari is Trishna Shakya, aged three, installed in September 2017 by the Maoist government that replaced the monarchy. Unika Bajracharya, selected in April 2014 as the Kumari of [[Lalitpur, Nepal|Patan]], is the second most important [[incarnation|living goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1533196/Goddess-status-may-violate-girls-rights-says-court.html | title=Goddess status may violate girls' rights, says court | date=3 November 2006 | first=Thomas | last=Bell | newspaper=The Telegraph | location=UK | accessdate=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2015/06/nepal-kumaris/sinclair-photography#/03-kumari-patan-on-throne-580v.jpg Living Goddesses of Nepal – Photo Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt;

A Kumari is generally chosen for one day and worshipped accordingly on certain festivals like [[Navaratri]] or [[Durga Puja]]. In Kathmandu Valley, this is a particularly prevalent practice. A Kumari is believed to be the incarnation of [[Taleju]].  When her first menstruation begins, it is believed that the goddess vacates her body. Serious illness or a major loss of blood from an injury also causes for loss of deity.

==Philosophy and scriptures==
{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}
The worship of the goddess in a young girl represents the worship of divine consciousness spread all over the creation. As the supreme goddess is thought to have manifested this entire [[cosmos]] out of her womb, she exists equally in animate as well as inanimate objects. While worship of an idol represents the worship and recognition of supreme through inanimate materials, worship of a human represents veneration and recognition of the same supreme in conscious beings.

In the [[Shaktism|Shakta]] text ''[[Devi Mahatmyam]]'' or ''Chandi'', the goddess is said to have declared that she resides in all-female living beings in this universe. The entire ritual of Kumari is based on this verse. But while worshiping a goddess, only a young girl is chosen over a mature woman because of their inherent purity and chastity.

Hindu scriptures like the ''Jñanarnava Rudrayamala'' [[tantra]] assign names to a Kumari depending on her age. A one-year-old girl is called Sandhya, a two-year-old girl is called [[Sarasvati]], a child of three years of age is called Tridhamurti, on her fourth year she is [[Kali]]ka, on fifth she is Subhaga, on sixth she is [[Parvati|Uma]], on her seventh year she is called Malini. An eight-year-old girl is called Kubjika, on the ninth year she is Kaalasandarbha, on reaching the tenth year she is Aparajita, on eleventh she is Rudrani, on twelfth year she is named Bhairavi, on thirteenth she is Mahalakshmi, on fourteenth she is Pithanayika, on fifteenth she is Kshetragya, and on sixteen years of her age she is Ambika.

In Nepal, Kumaris are worshiped only for a day; these names are assigned only while the ritual lasts, often a few hours. Usually one cannot be a Kumari beyond 16 years of age because of [[menarche]].

The main target of a Kumari [[puja (Buddhism)|puja]] is to realize the potential divinity in every human being, mostly female. A Hindu spiritual aspirant sees the universal consciousness of humanity.

==History in Nepal==
[[File:Kumari.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Kumari in 2011]]
Whilst the veneration of a living Kumari in Nepal is relatively recent, dating only from the 17th century, the tradition of Kumari-[[Puja (Buddhism)|Puja]], or virgin worship, has been around for much longer. There is evidence of virgin worship taking place in [[Nepal]] for more than 2,300 years. It appears to have taken hold in Nepal in the 6th century. There is written evidence describing the selection, ornamentation, and worship of the Kumari dating from the 13th century CE.

There are several legends telling of how the current tradition of the Kumari began. Most of the legends, however, the tale of King [[Jayaprakash Malla]], the last Nepalese king of the [[Malla (Nepal)|Malla Dynasty]] (12th–17th century CE). According to the most popular legend, a king and his friend, the goddess Taleju, approached his chambers late one night as he played tripasa, a [[dice]] game. The goddess came along every night to play the game, with the condition that the king refrains from telling anyone about their meetings.

But one night the king's wife followed him to his chamber in order to find out who the king was meeting so often. The king's wife saw Taleju and the goddess was angered. She told the king that, if he wanted to see her again or have her protect his country, he'd have to search for her among the [[Newar people|Newari]] (Shakya) community of Ratnawali, as she would be incarnated as a little girl among them. Hoping to make amends with his patroness, King Jayaprakash Malla left the palace in search of the young girl who was possessed by Taleju's spirit.

Similarly, there is another story about the disappearance of Taleju. Some believe that the goddess visited king Trailokya Malla every night in the human form. Like other legendary stories, the king and the goddess played tripasa (dice) while discussing the welfare of the country. However, one-night king Trailokya Malla made sexual advances towards the goddess Taleju. As a result, the goddess in rage stopped visiting the palace. The king in regret worshipped and pleaded for her return. Finally, the goddess agreed to appear in the body of the virgin girl from the Shakya family.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asianart.com/articles/kumari/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In another version of the story, a king was very promiscuous. He was also attracted to young girls. Unfortunately, during sex with a young girl, she died. This left the king disturbed, guilt-ridden and saddened, and he repented by concluding that the girl had returned to her spiritual goddess nature. He declared the creation of the Kumari Devi to perpetually remind the world of the sacred nature of young girls and virginity.

Even today, a mother's dream of a red serpent is believed to be a portent of the elevation of her daughter to the position of Royal Kumari. And each year, the Nepalese King seeks the blessing of the Royal Kumari at the festival of [[Indra Jatra]]. This tradition has changed from 2008 [[A.D]] with the country becoming the youngest republic of the world. 

A variation of this and other legends names King [[Gunkam Dev]], a 12th-century ancestor of King Jayaprakash Malla, as the main character rather than Jayaprakash Malla.

A third variation of the legend says that during the reign of King Jayaprakash Malla, a young girl was banished from the city because it was feared that she was possessed by the goddess [[Durga]]. When the queen learned of the young girl's fate, she became enraged and insisted that the king fetch the girl and install her as the living incarnation of Durga.

==Selection process==
{{Disputed-section|date=March 2008}}
Once Taleju has left the sitting Kumari, there is a frenzy of activity to find her successor. Some have compared the selection process to the process used in nearby [[Tibet]] to find the [[reincarnation]]s of [[Tulku]]s, such as the [[Dalai Lama]] or the [[Panchen Lama]]. The selection process is conducted by five senior Buddhist [[Bhajracharya]] priests, the Panch Buddha, the Bada Guruju or Chief Royal Priest, Achajau the priest of Taleju and the royal [[Astrology|astrologer]]. The King and other religious leaders that might know of eligible candidates are also informed that a search is underway.

Eligible girls are from the [[Newar]] Shakya caste of silver and goldsmiths. She must be in excellent health, never have shed blood or been afflicted by any diseases, be without blemish and must not have yet lost any teeth. Girls who pass these basic eligibility requirements are examined for the ''battis lakshanas'', or ''thirty-two perfections'' of a goddess. Some of these are poetically listed as such:

* A neck like a conch shell
* A body like a banyan tree
* Eyelashes like a cow
* Thighs like a deer
* Chest like a lion
* Voice soft and clear as a duck's

In addition to this, her hair and eyes should be very ''black'', she should have dainty hands and feet, small and well-recessed sexual organs and a set of twenty teeth.

The girl is also observed for signs of serenity and fearlessness and her [[horoscope]] is examined to ensure that it is complementary to the King's. It is important that there not be any conflicts as she must confirm the King's legitimacy each year of her divinity. Her family is also scrutinized to ensure its piety and devotion to the King.

Once the priests have chosen a candidate, she must undergo yet more rigorous tests to ensure that she indeed possesses the qualities necessary to be the living vessel of Durga. Her greatest test comes during the Hindu festival of [[Dashain]]. On the Kalratri, or 'black night', 108 buffaloes and goats are sacrificed to the goddess Kali. The young candidate is taken into the Taleju temple and released into the courtyard, where the severed heads of the animals are illuminated by candlelight and masked men are dancing about. If the candidate truly possesses the qualities of Taleju, she shows no fear during this experience. If she does, another candidate is brought in to attempt the same thing.

As a final test, the living goddess must spend a night alone in a room among the heads of ritually slaughtered goats and buffaloes without showing fear. The fearless candidate has proven that she has the serenity and the fearlessness that typifies the goddess who is to inhabit her. After passing all other tests, the final test is that she must be able to pick out the personal belongings of the previous Kumari from an assortment of things laid out before her. If she is able to do so, there is no remaining doubt that she is the chosen one.

There are claims contrary to the commonly believed ritual and screening process, however.  The ex-Royal Kumari [[Rashmila Shakya]] states in her autobiography&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Goddess to Mortal|last=Shakya|first=Rashmila|publisher=Vajra Publications|year=2012|isbn=978-99946-788-0-8|location=Jyatha, Thamel, Kathmandu, Nepal|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''From Goddess to Mortal''  that this has nothing to do with the selection process, but rather is a ritual the Royal Kumari goes through each year, and that there are no men dancing around in masks trying to scare her, and that at most there are only a dozen or so decapitated animal heads in the scary room test.  She also describes the requisite physical examination of each Kumari as neither intimate nor rigorous.

Once the Kumari is chosen, she must be purified so that she can be an unblemished vessel for Taleju. She is taken by the priests to undergo a number of secrets [[Tantra|Tantric]] rituals to cleanse her body and spirit of her past experiences. Once these rituals are completed, Taleju enters her and she is presented as the new Kumari. She is dressed and made up as a Kumari and then leaves the Taleju temple and walks across the square on a white cloth to the Kumari Ghar that will be her home for the duration of her divinity.

==Life of the Royal Kumari==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
Once the chosen girl completes the Tantric purification rites and crosses from the temple on a white cloth to the Kumari Ghar to assume her throne, her life takes on an entirely new character. She will leave her palace only on ceremonial occasions. Her family will visit her rarely, and then only in a formal capacity. Her playmates will be drawn from a narrow pool of Newari children from her caste, usually the children of her caretakers. She will always be dressed in red, wear her hair in a topknot and have the ''[[agni]] chakshu'' or "fire eye" painted on her forehead as a symbol of her special powers of perception.

The Royal Kumari's new life is vastly different from the one to which she has been accustomed in her short life. Whilst her life is now free of material troubles, she has ceremonial duties to carry out. Although she is not ordered about, she is expected to behave as befits a goddess. She has shown the correct qualities during the selection process and her continued serenity is of paramount importance; an ill-tempered goddess is believed to portend bad tidings for those petitioning her.

The Kumari's walk across the [[Durbar Square]] is the last time her feet will touch the ground until such time as the goddess departs from her body. From now on, when she ventures outside of her palace, she will be carried or transported in her golden palanquin. Her feet, like all of her, are now sacred. Petitioners will touch them, hoping to receive respite from troubles and illnesses. The King himself will kiss them each year when he comes to seek her blessing. She will never wear shoes; if her feet are covered at all, they will be covered with red stockings.

The power of the Kumari is perceived to be so strong that even a glimpse of her is believed to bring good fortune. Crowds of people wait below the Kumari's window in the Kumari Chowk, or courtyard, of her palace, hoping that she will pass by the latticed windows on the third floor and glance down at them. Even though her irregular appearances last only a few seconds, the atmosphere in the courtyard is charged with devotion and awe when they do occur.

The more fortunate, or better connected, petitioners visit the Kumari in her chambers where she sits upon a gilded lion throne. Many of those visiting her are people suffering from blood or menstrual disorders since the Kumari is believed to have special power over such illnesses. She is also visited by bureaucrats and other government officials. Petitioners customarily bring gifts and food offerings to the Kumari, who receives them in silence. Upon arrival, she offers them her feet to touch or kiss as an act of devotion. During these audiences, the Kumari is closely watched and her actions interpreted as a [[Omen|prediction]] of the petitioners' lives', for example as follows:

* Crying or loud laughter: Serious illness or death
* Weeping or rubbing eyes: Imminent death
* Trembling: Imprisonment
* Hand clapping: Reason to fear the King
* Picking at food offerings: Financial losses

If the Kumari remains silent and impassive throughout the audience, her devotees leave elated. This is the sign that their wishes have been granted.

Many people attend to the Kumari's needs. These people are known as the Kumarimi and are headed by the patron. Their job is very difficult. They must attend to the Kumari's every need and desire while giving her instruction in her ceremonial duties. While they cannot directly order her to do anything, they must guide her through her life. They are responsible for bathing her, dressing her and attending to her makeup as well as preparing her for her visitors and for ceremonial occasions.

Traditionally, the Kumari received no education as she was widely considered to be omniscient. However, modernization has made it necessary for her to have an education once she re-enters mortal life. Kumaris are now allowed to attend public schools and have a life inside the classroom that is no different from that of other students. While many kumaris, such as the Kumari of Bhaktapur, attend school, others, such as the main kumari in Kathmandu, receive their education through private tutors.

Similarly, her limited playmates must learn to respect her. Since her every wish must be granted, they must learn to surrender to her whatever they have that she may want and to defer to her wishes in what games to play or activities to play.

==Controversy==
On 3 July 2007, Sajani Shakya was removed from her position as Kumari of Bhaktapur after visiting the United States to attend the release of the movie ''[[Living Goddess (film)|Living Goddess]]'' at [[Silverdocs]], the American Film Institute/Discovery Channel documentary festival in downtown [[Silver Spring, Maryland]]. The visit, according to the elders, had tainted her purity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6264014.stm  					'Goddess' sacked for visiting US]. ''BBC News''. 2007-07-03.&lt;/ref&gt; A couple of weeks later, temple authorities at Sajani Shakya's hometown recanted their previous statement and said that she would not be stripped of her title because she was willing to undergo a "cleansing" ceremony to remove any sins she might have committed while traveling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6907007.stm  					Nepalese 'goddess' is reinstated]. ''BBC News''. 2008-07-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
* The Kumari was featured in the 25 October 2015 episode of the CBS drama series ''[[Madam Secretary (TV series)|Madam Secretary]]'', titled "Waiting for Taleju". In the episode, fictional [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]] [[Elizabeth McCord (character)|Elizabeth McCord]] meets with the Kumari in hopes of gaining support for a deal that will help secure US disaster relief funds in the wake of the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake]].
* In the webtoon series [http://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/for-the-sake-of-sita/list?title_no=349 For the Sake of Sita], the female lead was a Kumari in Nepal.
* In the novel ''[[The Lives of Christopher Chant]]'' by [[Diana Wynne Jones]], the character of the Living Asheth is a little girl worshipped as a goddess in one of the worlds visited by the main character, and is based heavily on the Kumari, being the incarnation of a goddess and having to live by strict rules of ritual purity.

'''Manningham''' is an historically industrial-workers area of [[Bradford]], [[West Yorkshire]], [[England]].
The population of the 2011 Census for the Bradford Ward was 19,983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&amp;b=13689864&amp;c=Manningham&amp;d=14&amp;e=62&amp;g=6369506&amp;i=1001x1003x1032x1004&amp;m=0&amp;r=1&amp;s=1456064672391&amp;enc=1 |title=City of Bradford ward population 2011 |accessdate=21 February 2016 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |work=Neighbourhood Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Manningham holds a wealth of industrial history, including mill buildings, imposing wool merchants' houses and [[Back-to-back houses|back-to-back]] terraced houses.
It is the old [[Jewish]] area of Bradford. Many of Manningham's [[Germany|German]] community later migrated to the [[Heaton, West Yorkshire|Heaton]] area of the city.&lt;ref name="BJHT:MTM"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Making Their Mark: Bradford Jewish |work=The Bradford Jewish Heritage Trail |accessdate=16 August 2013 |year=2017 |url=http://bradfordjewish.org.uk/900-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JRC:BJC"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Bradford Jewish Community &amp; Synagogues |work=Jewish Gen - JRC-UK |accessdate=17 August 2013 |date=2 June 2017 |url=http://www.jewishgen.org/jcr-uk/Community/bradford.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cinema history ===

In 1912 the Manningham Kinematograph Company Ltd opened the 519 seat Oak Lane Picture House on a site on the north side of Oak Lane between St Mary's Road and Sunderland Road.
The cinema was a converted horse tramshed of the Bradford Tramways and Omnibus Co Ltd.
The name was changed to Oriental in 1920 and by 1931 [[Western Electric]] sound had been installed.
The building closed in 1936 for a partial rebuild involving a new roof, balcony, an enlarged screen and the cinema reopened in 1937.
A [[Hammond organ]] was subsequently installed but was removed at the start of the [[Second world war]].
In 1955 a CinemaScope screen was installed with stereophonic sound but the cinema closed in 1958 and the building was  subsequently demolished and a mini-supermarket built on the site.&lt;ref name="BT:OLOC"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Sutton |first=Colin |title=Bradford - Oak Lane/Oriental Cinema History |work=Bradford Timeline |accessdate=8 July 2017 |date=2007 |url=https://www.bradfordtimeline.co.uk/orient.htm}};{{Cite web |last=Roe |first=Ken |title=Oriental Cinema in Bradford |work=Cinema Treasures |accessdate=8 July 2017 |date=3 November 2012 |url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/40014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose-built 1,250 seat Marlboro Cinema was located at the junction of Carlisle Road and Carlisle Street and opened in 1921.&lt;ref name="BT:MLC"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Sutton |first=Colin |title=Bradford - Marlboro/Liberty Cinema History |work=Bradford Timeline |accessdate=16 June 2017 |year=2003 |url=https://www.bradfordtimeline.co.uk/marlbo.htm}}; {{Cite web |last1=Hill |first1=Hector |last2=Roe |first2=Ken |title=Marlboro' Cinema in Bradford |work=Cinema Treasures |accessdate=8 July 2017 |url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/39782}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The building was designed by architect T&amp;nbsp;Patrick and is built of red brick with a white tiled entrance and domed tower and was owned by Moulson's Marlboro Cinema Company headed by Milton Moulson.&lt;ref name="BT:MLC"/&gt;
Talkies were shown by 1930 and seating reduced to 1227 in 1944.
Walter Eckert's Star Cinemas (London) Ltd acquired the cinema in 1950 and installed [[Western Electric]] sound.
It had a panoramic screen from 1954 but stereo sound was never installed.
[[Bingo (United Kingdom)|Bingo]] was introduced on a part time basis but the cinema closed fully in 1962 with bingo continuing full-time until 1968.&lt;ref name="BT:MLC"/&gt;
From 1962 to 1982 it was known as the Liberty Cinema showing Asian films and after closure with the raked floor and balcony removed the building became a bedding and textile warehouse.&lt;ref name="BT:MLC"/&gt;
In 2000 after a major refurbishment by Asian Cine Ltd the cinema now reduced to 400 seats, showed [[Bollywood]] films.
In 2001 a blaze wrecked the cinema and the fire-damaged part of the cinema was rebuilt as an Asian Marriage Hall and function room.&lt;ref name="BT:MLC"/&gt;

The former Manningham Methodist Church off Carlisle Road was converted into the Sangeet Cinema opening in 1970 showing Asian films.
The former church building was very large and also housed numerous Asian businesses.
The Naz was a smaller cinema created at the rear of the building but was only used occasionally.
The Sangeet closed in 1980 and a series of fires struck the building in the 1980s, after which the whole building was demolished.&lt;ref name="BT:SN"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Sutton |first=Colin |title=Sangeet &amp; Naz Cinemas |work=Bradford Timeline |accessdate=8 July 2017 |year=2008 |url=https://www.bradfordtimeline.co.uk/sangna.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deprivation ===

Manningham was the location of the [[Manningham Riot]] (June 1995) and the [[Bradford Riots]] (July 2001).
In April 1994, ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper reported that unemployment in Manningham stood at 40% (around four times the national average at the time), and that a large number of known drug users and [[Alcoholism|alcoholics]] lived there.&lt;ref name="Indy:NGB"&gt;{{Cite web |title=No-Go Britain: Where, what, why |work=The Independent |accessdate=5 July 2016 |date=16 April 1994 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/no-go-britain-where-what-why-1370749.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==

The area usually termed "Manningham" tends to be that bordered by Manningham Lane to the east, Thornton Road (B6145) to the south west, and Oak Lane to the north.&lt;ref name="MHWL"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Manningham History Walk - From Village to Velvet |accessdate=17 August 2013 |url=http://www.manninghammasterplan.co.uk/documents/W23758%20Manningham%20History%20Walk%20Leaflet.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However this is historically inaccurate as places such as White Abbey, Black Abbey, [[Longlands, Bradford|Longlands]] and what constitutes Manningham has persisted with the creation of administrative units such as the Manningham Ward.

=== Streets ===

Manningham Lane, part of the [[A650 road|A650]], stretches from Hamm Strasse to [[Lister Park]] (also known as Manningham Park) where it becomes Keighley Road.
It is a busy road in terms of both traffic and commerce, lined with shops and businesses for practically its entire length.

White Abbey Road - which becomes Whetley Hill at the junction with Whetley Lane and Carlisle Road - part of the [[B6144 road|B6144]], is similarly active, with several large clothing outlets and jewellery shops.

Oak Lane is similarly commercialised, although with a tendency towards smaller shops and food outlets.

Lumb Lane, running parallel to and between Manningham Lane and White Abbey Road, is the home to many independent shops, mainly catering to the local South Asian community.
There are also several pubs and South Asian restaurants.
Recent actions by the Bradford Council and local community groups have helped in starting to improve the area.&lt;ref name="IIB"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.investinbradford.com/Resources/Invest%20In%20Bradford/Bradford%20Economy/Documents/Bradford_District_Quarterly_Economic_Update_Feb_2012.pdf |format=PDF |work=Invest in Bradford online |title=''Quarterly Economic Update'' |accessdate=20 August 2013}}{{Deadlink |date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Districts ===&lt;!-- Anchor from Redirect. --&gt;

==== White Abbey ====

White Abbey is a historic district on the northwestern edge of Bradford city centre.
Its boundaries are roughly the equivalent of White Abbey Road to the west and south, Lumb Lane to the east and Carlisle Road to the north.
Like many of the older districts of inner-city Bradford, White Abbey was once a vibrant and highly populated neighbourhood.
Today the area is dominated by social housing. 

Notable local amenities include the pub, Haigy's, and the "Pakistan and International Link Community Centre."

== Landmarks ==

The most dominant landmark in the entire city is [[Lister Mills]].
The mills stand on the most elevated part of Manningham, at the top of Oak Lane (although, more accurately, the mills are on the corner of Lilycroft and Heaton Roads).
The mills have recently been converted into luxury modern flats. Another former prominent textile factory, [[Drummond Mill]], was destroyed in a fire in January 2018 and has largely been demolished.

[[Bradford Reform Synagogue]] is situated in Manningham and is a Grade II listed Moorish Revival building.
Architecturally, this is a very rare and well-preserved, small scale, provincial synagogue built in "Oriental" style.
It is perhaps a notable example in British synagogue architecture of the 19th century fashion for "Orientalism".&lt;ref name="BRS"&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Stroud |first1=Lloyd |last2=Strauss |first2=Dr Joseph |title=Bradford Reform Synagogue |work=Bradford Reform Synagogue |accessdate=18 August 2013 |url=http://www.bradfordsynagogue.co.uk/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Bradford Reform Synagogue is the oldest Reform Synagogue in the UK outside London.&lt;ref name="TCJ:EDJCH"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thejc.com/event/b%E2%80%99nai-b%E2%80%99rith-european-days-jewish-culture-heritage-bradford-reform-synagogue |title=''European Days–Jewish Cultural Heritage'' |work=The JC; Bradford Reform Synagogue |accessdate=20 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107003637/http://www.thejc.com/event/b%E2%80%99nai-b%E2%80%99rith-european-days-jewish-culture-heritage-bradford-reform-synagogue |archivedate=7 January 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bradford Grammar School]] is situated in Manningham between Lister Park and Canal Road.The school was founded in 1548 and granted its Charter by King Charles II in 1662.

Another key landmark is [[Lister Park]].
This triangular park, situated between Keighley Road, North Park Road and Emm Lane in the north of Manningham, is one of the city's largest parks.
It houses [[Cartwright Hall]] (a museum and art gallery), a large boating lake and the Mughal Water Gardens as well as extensive botanical gardens.&lt;ref name="BP&amp;G"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Lister Park |work=Bradford Parks &amp; Landscape Service |accessdate=15 September 2011 |url=http://www.bradforddistrictparks.org/sites/parks/parks.php?ID=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
;Councillors
Manningham electoral ward is represented on [[City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council|Bradford Council]] by three [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] councillors, Shabir Hussain, Sameena Akhtar and Sarfraz Nazir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Your councillors by ward | url = https://bradford.moderngov.co.uk/mgMemberIndex.aspx?FN=WARD&amp;VW=LIST&amp;PIC=0 | website = bradford.moderngov.co.uk | publisher = [[City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council]] | access-date = 25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sport ==

Manningham also contains [[Valley Parade]] football stadium, that has been the home of [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City football club]] since they were founded in 1903 and where [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford RLFC]] played in recent years while [[Odsal Stadium]] was redeveloped.
In 1985 the Valley Parade ground was the site of a [[Bradford City stadium fire|fire which killed 56 spectators]] and injured at least 265 at the final game of the season, against [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], and led to improved safety regulations at British sports grounds.
As was once common with English football stadiums, the stadium takes its name from the road on which it is situated, Valley Parade being the name of a road that slopes down Bradford's valley off the [[A650 road|A650]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23419">{{Maya religion}}
'''Maya mythology''' is part of [[Mesoamerica]]n mythology and comprises all of the Maya tales in which personified forces of nature, deities, and the heroes interacting with these play the main roles. The myths of the Pre-Hispanic era have to be reconstructed from iconography. Other parts of Maya oral tradition (such as animal tales, folk tales, and many moralising stories) are not considered here. 

==Sources==
The oldest written Maya myths date from the 16th century and are found in historical sources from the [[Guatemalan Highlands]]. The most important of these documents is the [[Popol Vuh]]&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2003&lt;/ref&gt; which contains [[Quichean]] creation stories and some of the adventures of the [[Hero Twins]], Hunahpu and Xbalanque.

Yucatán is another important region; the Yucatec Books of [[Chilam Balam]] contain mythological passages of considerable antiquity, and mythological fragments are found scattered among the early-colonial Spanish chronicles and reports, chief among them [[Diego de Landa]]'s [[Relación de las cosas de Yucatán|'Relación de las cosas de Yucatán']], and in the dictionaries compiled by the early missionaries.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, anthropologists and local folklorists committed many stories to paper, usually in Spanish or English, and only rarely together with the Mayan language text. Even though most Maya tales are the results of an historical process in which Spanish narrative traditions interacted with native ones, some of the tales reach back well into pre-Spanish times. Important collections of myths have been published for the Chol,&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins and Josserand 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Kekchi,&lt;ref&gt;Danien 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Lacandon,&lt;ref&gt;Bruce1974; Boremanse 1986, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Tzotzil,&lt;ref&gt;Gossen 1974; Laughlin 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Tzutujil,&lt;ref&gt;Sexton 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and Yucatec Maya,&lt;ref&gt;Burns 1983&lt;/ref&gt; to mention only some of the more accessible ones. At the beginning of the 21st century, the transmission of traditional tales has entered its closing stage.

==Important Early-Colonial and Recent Narrative Themes==
{{Maya civilization}}

In Maya narrative, the origin of many natural and cultural phenomena is set out, often with the moral aim of defining the ritual relationship between mankind and its environment. In such a way, one finds explanations about the origin of the heavenly bodies (Sun and Moon, but also Venus, the Pleiades, the Milky Way); the mountain landscape; clouds, rain, thunder and lightning; wild and tame animals; the colors of the maize; diseases and their curative herbs; agricultural instruments; the steam bath, etc. The following more encompassing themes can be discerned.

===Cosmogony===
The Popol Vuh describes the creation of the earth by a group of creator deities, as well as its sequel. The Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel relates the collapse of the sky and the deluge, followed by the slaying of the earth crocodile, the raising of the sky and the erection of the five World Trees.&lt;ref&gt;Roys 1967: 98-107; Taube 1993: 69-74; Knowlton 2010: 53-85&lt;/ref&gt; The Lacandons also knew the tale of the creation of the Underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Boremanse 1986: 39-48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation of Mankind===
The Popol Vuh gives a sequence of four efforts at creation: First were animals, then wet clay, wood, then last, the creation of the first ancestors from [[maize]] dough. To this, the Lacandons add the creation of the main kin groupings and their 'totemic' animals.&lt;ref&gt;Boremanse 1986: 30-38&lt;/ref&gt; A Verapaz myth preserved by Las Casas in his 'Apologética Historia Sumaria' &lt;ref&gt;Chinchilla Mazariegos 2017: 30, 55-56&lt;/ref&gt; assigns the creation of mankind to artisan gods similar to the Popol Vuh monkey brothers. The creation of humankind is concluded by the Mesoamerican tale of the opening of the Maize (or Sustenance) Mountain by the Lightning deities.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1970: 349-354; Bierhorst 1990: 86-90&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actions of the Heroes: Arranging the World===
The best-known hero myth, included in the Popol Vuh, is about the defeat of a bird demon and of the deities of disease and death by the [[Hero Twins]], Hunahpu and Xbalanque. Of equal importance is the parallel narrative of a [[Maya maize god|maize hero]] defeating the deities of Thunder and Lightning and establishing a pact with them.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1945: 191-196; cf. Nicholson 1967: 61-64&lt;/ref&gt; Although its present spread is confined to the Gulf Coast areas, various data suggest that this myth was once a part of Mayan oral tradition as well. Important mythological fragments about the heroic reduction of the jaguars and the acquisition of jaguar power have been preserved by the Tzotzil&lt;ref&gt;Guiteras Holmes 1961: 182-183, 262&lt;/ref&gt; and Chol Maya.&lt;ref&gt;Morales Bermúdez 1999: 61-62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage with the Earth===
This mythological type defines the relation between mankind and the game and crops. An ancestral hero - Xbalanque in a Kekchi tradition - changes into a hummingbird to woo the daughter of an Earth God while she is weaving; the hero's wife is finally transformed into game, bees, snakes and insects, or the maize. If the hero gets the upper hand, he becomes the Sun, his wife the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;Braakhuis 2010; Danien 2004: 37-44; Thompson 1970: 363-366; &lt;/ref&gt; A moralistic Tzotzil version has a man rewarded with a daughter of the Rain Deity, only to get divorced and lose her again.&lt;ref&gt;Guiteras Holmes 1961: 191-193&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin of Sun and Moon===
The origin of Sun and Moon is not always the outcome of a Marriage with the Earth. From Chiapas and the western Guatemalan Highlands comes the tale of Younger Brother and his jealous Elder Brethren: Youngest One becomes the Sun, his mother becomes the Moon, and the Elder Brethren are transformed into wild pigs and other forest animals.&lt;ref&gt;Bierhorst 1990: 110-111&lt;/ref&gt; In a comparable way, the Elder Brethren of the Popol Vuh Twin myth are transformed into monkeys, with their younger brothers becoming Sun and Moon. To the west of the Maya area, the transformation of two brothers into sun and moon is the main subject of many tales.&lt;ref&gt;Chinchilla Mazariegos 2017: 164-168&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconstructing Pre-Spanish Mythology==

It is doubtful that mythological narratives were ever completely rendered hieroglyphically, even though a sort of 'strip books' may once have existed. The three surviving Mayan books are mainly of a ritual and also (in the case of the [[Paris Codex]]) historical nature, and contain few mythical scenes. As a consequence, depictions on temple walls, stelae, and movable objects (especially the so-called 'ceramic codex') are used to aid reconstruction of pre-Spanish Mayan mythology. A main problem with depictions is defining what constitutes a mythological scene, since any given scene might also represent a moment in a ritual sequence, a visual metaphor stemming from oral literature, a scene from mundane life, or a historical event. The easiest way to solve this problem is to focus on scenes that include known mythological actors. This only became possible in the early seventies of the last century, when an enormous increase in the number of Maya vases available for study occurred.

In the seventies, the leading Maya scholar [[ Michael D. Coe]] identified several actors of the Popol Vuh hero myth on ceramics, chief amongst these Hunahpu, Xbalanque, and the Howler Monkey brothers (Hun Batz and Hun Choven).&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1973, 1977, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; This initiated a tendency among scholars to interpret vase scenes nearly exclusively in terms of the Popol Vuh. Especially influential in this respect was one of Coe’s students, [[Karl Taube]], who interpreted the so-called “tonsured maize god” as [[Hun Hunahpu|Hun-Hunahpu]], the father of the Popol Vuh hero brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Taube 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Using bits from monumental inscriptions, [[Linda Schele]] composed a cosmogonic myth for this “First Father”, one that still awaits iconographic confirmation:&lt;ref&gt;Schele 1993: 75&lt;/ref&gt; “Under the aegis of First Father, One-Maize-revealed, three stones were set up at a place called ‘Lying-down-sky,’ forming the image of the sky. First Father had entered the sky and made a house of eight partitions there. He had also raised the Wakah-Chan, the World Tree, so that its crown stood in the north sky. And finally, he had given circular motion to the sky, setting the constellations into their dance through the night.” More recently, two major works by Oswaldo Chinchilla Mazariegos (2011, 2017) opened up new horizons of iconographic interpretation by considering a great variety of Maya and Mesoamerican tales on a par with the Popol Vuh.

==Important Late-Preclassic and Classic Narratives==

Mythological representations run from the Late-Preclassic murals of [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]] up to the Late-Postclassic codices. The following is an overview of ancient myths that connect, in grand part, to the broad narrative themes of early-colonial and more recent oral tradition outlined above.

===Cosmogony: Defeat of the Great Crocodile===
In an early description of a Yucatec fire ritual (Relación de Mérida), a crocodile symbolizes the deluge and the earth; such a crocodile, called Itzam Cab Ain, was instrumental in causing a flood and was defeated by having its throat cut (Books of Chilam Balam of Maní and Tizimín).&lt;ref&gt;Taube 1993: 69-70; Velásquez García 2006: 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-Spanish data are suggestive of these events. A water-spewing, deer-hooved celestial reptile on page 74 of the Dresden Codex is generally believed to be causing the deluge. A Postclassic mural from Mayapan shows a tied crocodile in the water,&lt;ref&gt;Taube 2010: Fig. 1&lt;/ref&gt; whereas a Classic inscription from Palenque (Temple XIX) mentions the decapitation of a crocodile.&lt;ref&gt;Velásquez García 2006: 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation of Mankind: Monkey Brothers===
On several vases, the Monkey Brothers of the Popol Vuh, Hun-Batz (‘One Howler Monkey’) and Hun-Choven, are shown as [[Howler monkey gods]] writing books and sculpting human heads.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Hieroglyphically&lt;ref&gt;Beliaev and Davletshin 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and metaphorically,&lt;ref&gt; Braakhuis 1987&lt;/ref&gt; the acts of writing and sculpting can refer to the creation of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;K717&lt;/ref&gt; A myth transmitted by [[Bartolomé de las Casas|Las Casas]] puts these acts in their proper, transcendent perspective by describing how previous efforts at creation failed, until two artisan brothers, Hun-Ahan and Hun-Cheven, got permission to create mankind and, indeed, the present universe, through their artifice.&lt;ref&gt;Braakhuis 1987; cf. Chinchilla Mazariegos 2017: 162&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actions of the Heroes===
====Hero Twins====
Tales about the [[Maya Hero Twins|Hero Brothers]] whom the Popol Vuh calls Hunahpu and Xbalanque (the iconographical ‘Headband Gods’) already circulated in the Classic Period,&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1989&lt;/ref&gt; albeit in versions only partially coinciding with the sixteenth-century narrative. It is, for example, not at all common to find them as ball players. Two other episodes stand out instead. The first one, corresponding to the isolated [[Vucub Caquix]] tale in the Popol Vuh, is the defeat of a bird demon already illustrated in Late-Preclassic [[Izapa]] and  the earliest ball court of Copan, and found all over Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;Guernsey 2006: 91-117; Nielsen and Helmke 2015; Chinchilla Mazariegos 2017: 130-157&lt;/ref&gt; The other episode, not represented in the Popol Vuh, has the hero brothers tend to a dying deer covered by a shroud with crossed bones,&lt;ref&gt;E.g., K2785 (the Calcehtok vase)&lt;/ref&gt; in a scene that may represent the transformation of the heroes’ father into a deer. In both Maya and non-Maya hero tales, such a transformation is equivalent to the origin of death.&lt;ref&gt;Chinchilla 2017: 224-233&lt;/ref&gt; The San Bartolo west wall murals may show still another episode, namely, Hunahpu bringing the first sacrifices in the four quarters of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Taube et al. 2010: 23&lt;/ref&gt;

====Maize Hero====
The [[Maya maize god|Tonsured Maize God]] is the subject of many episodes, only part of which has been explained. Often he is accompanied by the Hero Twins. Some scholars  consider him the Classic form of the Hero Twins’ father, the 'failed hero' Hun-Hunahpu, and accordingly view the maize god’s head attached to a cacao tree as the decapitated head of Hun-Hunahpu suspended in a calabash tree.&lt;ref&gt;Taube 1985, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is also a tendency to treat the Tonsured Maize God as an agent in his own right. Scholars have compared him to the maize hero of the Gulf Coast peoples and identified several episodes from this deity’s mythology in Maya art, such as  his aquatic birth and rebirth, his musical challenge to the deities of water and rain (on [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]]'s west wall),and his victorious emergence from the latter’s turtle abode.&lt;ref&gt;Braakhuis 2014; Chinchilla Mazariegos 2017: 218-223&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, prefer to view the ‘musical challenge’ as a rainmaking ritual and the emergence from the turtle abode as the Opening of the Maize Mountain.&lt;ref&gt;Taube 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Another frequent scene, the maize god surrounded by nude women, may relate to the fact that the Tonsured Maize God also functions as a moon god; for in many Mesoamerican sun and moon tales, a playful young man becomes moon  rather than sun by giving in to the lures of young women.&lt;ref&gt;Chinchilla Mazariegos 2017: 164-168, 202-207&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jaguar Slayers==== 
In the dim past, before order reigned, jaguars presented a continuous threat to mankind. In their myths and rituals, Maya groups of Chiapas have transmitted the deeds of jaguar-slaying heroes, namely, killing jaguars transfixed to their stone seats; catching jaguars in a ‘stone trap’; and burning them on a certain rock. All of these jaguars represent the power of hostile social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Braakhuis 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Codical vases show similar feats but appear to ascribe them to four men. A down-lying [[Maya jaguar gods|jaguar deity]] associated with war and terrestrial fire has a boulder thrown onto his belly, perhaps belonging to a trap; alternatively, he is tied and put to the torch, in one scene seated on a boulder-like altar. Probably because jaguars can also symbolize hostile rulers and their warriors, the latter episode is referred to in certain monumental inscriptions at [[Naranjo]],&lt;ref&gt;Schele and Mathews 1998: 148-149&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the art of [[Tonina]] (bound captive with jaguar attributes). The same inscriptions connect the Classic Jaguar Slayer theme to that of the Jaguar Baby.

===Marriage with the Earth: The Hummingbird Suitor===
As mentioned earlier, ‘Hummingbird’ is the hero of a wide-spread narrative about the wooing and abduction of the daughter of the principal mountain deity. Since the daughter represents the ‘bride-wealth’ of the earth, this tale was also recited as part of the procedures to ask for the hand of a girl. Accordingly, a famous Classic vase&lt;ref&gt;K504&lt;/ref&gt; shows a suitor with a hummingbird mask presenting a vase to the upper god and what appears to be his daughter, the moon. In the same context also belongs the well-known figurine of a hummingbird observing a young woman weaving.&lt;ref&gt;Chinchilla Mazariegos 2017: 82-93&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Hunt: Antlered Young Men===
A group of codical vases shows antlered young men together with young women, some of whom mount a deer, all surrounding a wounded or dying old deer god of human aspect.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., K1182, K2794&lt;/ref&gt; Additional scenes have the hero brothers hunt a boar with [[Itzamna|the upper god]] clinging to it.&lt;ref&gt;K1991&lt;/ref&gt; The first group has been explained by concepts relating to the hunt and by moralizing hunting tales figuring hunters, a dying Lord of the Deer, and young women.&lt;ref&gt;Braakhuis 2001; 2010: 172-174&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars, however, have ventured to arrange all of the aforementioned scenes into a fanciful narrative running like this:&lt;ref&gt;Beliaev and Davletshin 2006&lt;/ref&gt; “The aged god Huk Si’p fell ill. One of the Twins changes to a deer in order to abduct his wife. The wife of Huk Si’p flees with the Twins. The aged god asks [[Itzamna|Itzamnaaj]] that he brings back his wife. Riding on a deer Itzamnaaj pursues the Twins. The Twins attack Itzamnaaj and wound him. Itzamnaaj saves himself from them by riding a peccary [wild boar]. The Twins reconcile with Itzamnaaj and bring him gifts.”

==Origins of circumcision==
{{Main|Religious male circumcision#In the Tanakh}}
For Jews, male circumcision is mandatory, as it is prescribed in the [[Torah]]. In the [[Book of Genesis]] as a mark of the [[Covenant (biblical)|Covenant]] between [[God]] and the descendants of [[Abraham]]: "Throughout all generations, every male shall be circumcised when he is eight days old...This shall be my covenant in your flesh, an eternal covenant. The uncircumcised male whose foreskin has not been circumcised, shall have his soul cut off from his people; he has broken my Covenant".&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=17 Genesis 17:9-14] at bible.ort.org&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Leviticus]]: "God spoke to Moses, telling him to speak to the Israelites: When a woman conceives and gives birth to a boy ... on the eighth day, the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised."&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=12 Leviticus 12:1-3] at bible.ort.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
Biblically, the infant's father (''avi haben'') is commanded to perform the [[circumcision]] himself. However, as most fathers are not comfortable or do not have the training, they designate a ''mohel''. The mohel is specially trained in circumcision and the rituals surrounding the procedure. Many ''mohalim'' are doctors or [[rabbi]]s (and some are both) or [[hazzan|cantors]] and are required to receive appropriate training both from the religious and medical fields.

Traditionally, the ''mohel'' uses a knife to circumcise the newborn. Today, doctors and some non-Orthodox ''mohalim'' use a perforating clamp before they cut the skin. The clamp makes it easier to be precise and shortens recovery time. Orthodox ''mohalim'' have rejected perforating clamps, arguing that by crushing and killing the skin it causes a great amount of unnecessary pain to the newborn, cutting off the blood flow completely, which according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]] is dangerous to the child and strictly forbidden, and also renders the ''orlah'' (foreskin) as cut prior to the proper ritual cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Gesundheit| url= http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/114/2/e259.full.pdf+html/ |title= Neonatal genital herpes simplex virus type 1 infection... |journal= Pediatrics| date= August 2004 |volume= 114|number= 2| pages= e259-63 |accessdate=2 February 2015|display-authors=etal | doi=10.1542/peds.114.2.e259 | pmid=15286266}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Gesundheit| title=Infectious complications with herpes virus after ritual Jewish circumcision: a historical and cultural analysis  |journal=Harefuah|date= February 2005 |volume= 144| number=2 |pages=126–32, 149, 148 |pmid=16128020|language=he|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://jme.bmj.com/content/39/7/459.full.pdf+html |title= Circumcision: What should be done?|first= Hanoch |last= Ben-Yami |journal= J Med Ethics |year= 2013| volume=39 |pages= 459–462| accessdate= 2 February 2015 |doi=10.1136/medethics-2012-101274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Jewish law, a mohel must [[Brit milah#Suction, metzitzah technique|draw blood from the circumcision wound]].

==Female mohels==
According to traditional Jewish law, in the absence of a Jewish male expert, a woman that has the required skills is also authorized to perform the circumcision, provided that she is Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Avodah Zarah 27a; Menachot 42a; Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, Milah, 2:1; [[Shulkhan Arukh]], Yoreh De'ah, 264:1&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Orthodox Judaism allows female ''mohels'', called ''mohalot'' ({{lang-he-n|מוֹהֲלוֹת}}, plural of {{Hebrew|מוֹהֶלֶת}} ''mohelet'', feminine of ''mohel''), without restriction. In 1984, Dr. Deborah Cohen became the first certified Reform Jewish mohelet; she was certified by the Berit Mila Program of Reform Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007073323/http://beritmila.org/ |archive-date=7 October 2013 |url=http://beritmila.org/ |title=Berit Mila Program of Reform Judaism |access-date=2 February 2015 |website=beritmila.org |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alencastre Window.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Pope [[Pius XI]], depicted in this window at [[Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace]], [[Honolulu]], was ordinary of the universal Church as well as the [[Diocese of Rome]] from 1922 to 1939. At the same time, Bishop [[Stephen Alencastre]], [[vicar apostolic|Apostolic Vicar]] of the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]], was the ordinary of what is now the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu]].]]

An '''ordinary''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''ordinarius'') is an officer of a church or civic authority who by reason of office has '''ordinary power''' to execute laws.

Such officers are found in hierarchically organised churches of [[Western Christianity]] which have an [[canon law|ecclesiastical legal system]].&lt;ref name="rc-ord"&gt;See, e.g., [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_PF.HTM#1.0.0.8.0.0.134 c. 134 &amp;sect; 1], ''Code of Canon Law'', 1983&lt;/ref&gt; For example, diocesan bishops are ordinaries in the [[Roman Catholic]] church&lt;ref name="rc-ord"/&gt; and the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (1974) arts. "Ordinary" and "Peculiar"&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Eastern Christianity]], a corresponding officer is called a '''hierarch'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/_PRC.HTM c. 984], ''Code of Canons of the Oriental Churches'', 1992&lt;/ref&gt; (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἱεράρχης}} ''hierarkhēs'' "president of sacred rites, high-priest"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Di%28era%2Frxhs ἱεράρχης], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; which comes in turn from τὰ ἱερά ''ta hiera'', "the sacred rites" and ἄρχω ''arkhō'', "I rule").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hierarchy "hierarchy"]. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within civic governance, notably in the southern United States, the role of the county ordinary historically involved the discharge of certain, often legal or legally related, tasks falling to city or county authorities, such as licensing marriages and adjudicating claims against an authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=County Ordinary Career Information|url=http://www.mymajors.com/careers-and-jobs/County-Ordinary|work=MyMajors|publisher=mymajors.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ordinary power ==
In [[canon law]], the power to govern the church is divided into the power to make laws (legislative), enforce the laws (executive), and to judge based on the law (judicial).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_PF.HTM#1.0.0.8.0.0.135 c. 135 &amp;sect;1], ''Code of Canon Law'', 1983&lt;/ref&gt; A person exercises power to govern either because the person holds an office to which the law grants governing power or because someone with governing power has delegated it to the person. Ordinary power is the former, while the latter is delegated power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_PF.HTM#1.0.0.8.0.0.131 c. 131 &amp;sect;1], ''Code of Canon Law'', 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The office with ordinary power could possess the governing power itself (proper ordinary power) or instead it could have the ordinary power of agency, the inherent power to exercise someone else's power ([[vicar]]ious ordinary power).&lt;ref&gt;&amp;sect; 2, ''Code of Canon Law'', 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

The law vesting ordinary power could either be ecclesiastical law, i.e. the positive enactments that the church has established for itself, or divine law, i.e. the laws which the church believes were given to it by God.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11284b.htm Ordinary]," ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of divinely instituted ordinaries, [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] in communion with the [[Holy See]] believe that when [[Jesus]] established the Church, he also established the [[episcopate]] and the [[primacy of Peter]], endowing the offices with power to govern the Church.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Lumen gentium]]'' and ''[[Pastor aeternus]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in the Catholic Church, the office of successor of Simon Peter and the office of diocesan bishop possess their ordinary power even in the absence of positive enactments from the Church.

Many officers possess ordinary power but, due to their lack of ordinary executive power, are not called ordinaries. The best example of this phenomenon is the office of [[judicial vicar]], a.k.a. ''[[officialis]]''. The judicial vicar only has authority through his office to exercise the diocesan bishop's power to judge cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P5C.HTM#7.1.0.2.1.1.1419 c. 1420 &amp;sect; 1], ''Code of Canon Law'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; Though the vicar has vicarious ordinary judicial power, he is not an ordinary because he lacks ordinary executive power. A [[vicar general]], however, has authority through his office to exercise the diocesan bishop's executive power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P1O.HTM#2.2.2.3.2.1.479 c. 479 &amp;sect; 1], ''Code of Canon Law'', 1983&lt;/ref&gt; He is therefore an ordinary because of this vicarious ordinary executive power.

===Local ordinaries and hierarchs===
Local ordinaries exercise ordinary power and are ordinaries in [[particular church]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_PF.HTM#1.0.0.8.0.0.134 c. 134 &amp;sect;&amp;sect;1–2], ''Code of Canon Law'', 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The following [[cleric]]s are local ordinaries:
*The [[Bishop of Rome]] (the pope) is ordinary for the whole [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canon 880–882|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1D.HTM|publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana|work=[[1983 Code of Canon Law]]|accessdate=21 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canons 43 and 45]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]] churches, [[patriarch]]s, [[major archbishop]]s, and [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]]s have ordinary power of governance for the whole territory of their respective autonomous particular churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canons 78, 152 and 157]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[diocese|Diocesan]]/[[eparchy|eparchial]] [[Bishop (Catholic Church)#Diocesan Bishops or Eparchs|bishops]]/[[eparchy|eparchs]]
*Other [[prelate]]s who head, even if only temporarily, a [[particular church]] or a community equivalent to it. Canon 368 of the ''Code of Canon Law'' lists five Latin-rite jurisdictional areas that are considered equivalent to a diocese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P1C.HTM#2.2.2.1.1.0.368 Code of Canon Law, canon 368]&lt;/ref&gt; These are headed by:
**A [[territorial prelature]], formerly called a prelate ''nullius dioceseos'' (of no diocese), in charge of a geographical area that has not yet been raised to the level of diocese
**A [[territorial abbey]], in charge of an area, which in mission countries can be quite vast, associated with an abbey
**An [[apostolic vicar]] (normally a bishop of a titular see), in charge of an apostolic vicariate, usually in a mission country, not yet ready to be made a diocese
**An [[apostolic prefecture]] (usually not a bishop), in charge of an apostolic prefecture, not yet ready to be made an apostolic vicariate
**A [[apostolic administrator|permanent apostolic administrator]], in charge of a geographical area that for serious reasons cannot be made a diocese.
*To these may be added:
**An [[Exarch#Modern Eastern Catholic churches|apostolic exarch]] (normally a bishop of a titular see), in charge of an apostolic exarchate—not yet ready to be made an eparchy—for the faithful of an Eastern Catholic Church in an area that is situated outside the home territory of that Eastern Church
**A [[military ordinariate]]
**A [[Personal Prelate|personal prelate]], in charge of a group of persons without regard to geography: the only personal prelature existing is that of [[Opus Dei]]
**An [[apostolic administrator]] of a personal apostolic administration: only one exists, the [[Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney]]
**An ordinary of a [[personal ordinariate]] for former Anglicans&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_ben-xvi_apc_20091104_anglicanorum-coetibus_en.html Apostolic Constitution ''Anglicanorum coetibus'' of 4 November 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
**A superior of an [[mission sui iuris|autonomous mission]]
*Of somewhat similar standing is the [[Diocesan administrator]] (formerly called a ''vicar capitular'') elected to govern a diocese during a vacancy. Apart from certain limitations of nature and law, he has, on a caretaker basis, the same obligations and powers as a diocesan bishop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1H.HTM Code of Canon Law, canons 427–429]&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally an apostolic administrator is appointed by the Holy See to run a vacant diocese, or even a diocese whose bishop is incapacitated or otherwise impeded.

Also classified as local ordinaries, although they do not head a particular church or equivalent community are:
*[[vicar general|Vicars general]] and [[Protosyncellus|protosyncelli]]
*[[vicar general|Episcopal vicars]] and [[Protosyncellus|syncelli]]

===Ordinaries who are not local ordinaries===
Major superiors of [[religious institute]]s (including [[abbot]]s) and of [[society of apostolic life|societies of apostolic life]] are ordinaries of their respective memberships, but not local ordinaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_PF.HTM#1.0.0.8.0.0.134 Code of Canon Law, canon 134]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthodox Christianity==

In the Orthodox Church, a hierarch (ruling bishop) holds uncontested authority within the boundaries of his own [[diocese]]; no other bishop may perform any [[sacerdotal]] functions without the ruling bishop's express invitation. The violation of this rule is called ''eispēdēsis'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: εἰσπήδησις, "trespassing", literally "jumping in"), and is uncanonical. Ultimately, all bishops in the Church are equal, regardless of any title they may enjoy ([[Patriarch]], [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]], [[Archbishop]], etc.). The role of the bishop in the Orthodox Church is both hierarchical and sacramental.&lt;ref name="Ware_21"&gt;{{Citation|last = Ware|first = Timothy|author-link = Timothy Ware|title = The Orthodox Church|place = London|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 1964|page =21|isbn = 0-14-020592-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This pattern of governance dates back to the earliest centuries of Christianity, as witnessed by the writings of [[Ignatius of Antioch]] (ca. 100 AD): &lt;blockquote&gt;The bishop in each Church presides in the place of God.... Let no one do any of the things which concern the Church without the bishop.... Wherever the bishop appears, there let the people be, just as wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the [[Catholic|Catholic Church]].&lt;/blockquote&gt; And it is the bishop's primary and distinctive task to celebrate the [[Eucharist]], "the medicine of immortality."&lt;ref name="Ware_21"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ignatius of Antioch, ''Epistle to the Magnesians'', VI:1; ''Epistle to the Smyrneans'', VIII:1 and 2; ''Epistle to the Ephesians'', XX:2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint [[Cyprian of Carthage]] (258 AD) wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;The episcopate is a single whole, in which each bishop enjoys full possession. So is the Church a single whole, though it spreads far and wide into a multitude of churches and its fertility increases.&lt;ref&gt;Cyprian of Carthage, ''On the Unity of the Church'', V.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Timothy Ware|Bishop Kallistos (Ware)]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;There are many churches, but only One Church; many ''episcopi'' but only one episcopate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Ware|first = Timothy|author-link = Timothy Ware|title = The Orthodox Church|place = London|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 1964|page =22|isbn = 0-14-020592-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Orthodox Christianity, the church is not seen as a monolithic, centralized institution, but rather as existing in its fullness in each local body. The church is defined Eucharistically: &lt;blockquote&gt;in each particular community gathered around its bishop; and at every local celebration of the Eucharist it is the ''whole'' Christ who is present, not just a part of Him. Therefore, each local community, as it celebrates the Eucharist ... is the church in its fullness."&lt;ref name="Ware_21"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; This is not to say that the Orthodox Church has a [[Congregationalist polity]]; on the contrary, the local priest functions as the "hands" of the bishop, and must receive from the bishop an [[antimension]] and [[chrism]] before he is permitted to celebrate any of the [[Sacred Mysteries]] (sacraments) within the diocese.

An Orthodox bishop's authority comes from his election and [[consecration]]. He is, however, subject to the [[Canon Law|Sacred Canons]] of the Orthodox Church, and answers to the [[Synod of Bishops (Orthodox)|Synod of Bishops]] to which he belongs. In case an Orthodox bishop is overruled by his local synod, he retains the right of [[appeal]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Ἔκκλητον, ''Ékklēton'') to his ecclesiastical superior (e.g. a Patriarch) and his synod.

'''Rekhmire''' was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian noble and official of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]] who served as "Governor of the Town" ([[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]) and [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|Vizier]] during the reigns of [[Thutmosis III]] and [[Amenhotep II]]. He was the nephew of Vizier [[Useramen|User]], who took office at the time of the fifth year of Queen [[Hatshepsut]]’s reign. User's official titles included mayor of the city, vizier, and prince. Rekhmire is noted for constructing a lavishly decorated [[TT100|tomb]] for himself in [[Sheikh Abd el-Qurna]], part of the [[Theban Necropolis]], containing lively, well preserved scenes of daily life during the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|Egyptian New Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Meskell, ''Private Life in New Kingdom Egypt'', Princeton University Press 2002, p.46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Cottrell, ''The Lost Pharaohs: The Romance of Egyptian Archaeology'', Evans 1950&lt;/ref&gt; His tomb is also important as it contains a full copy of a text detailing the duties of the office of the vizier, known as ''The [[Installation of the Vizier]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Miriam Lichtheim, ''Ancient Egyptian Literature'', Volume II: The New Kingdom, University of California Press 1978 pp.21ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

He was also [[High Priest]] of [[Annu]] or Heliopolis. The cause of his political and personal downfall remains unclear.

[[Christianity]] is the predominant religion in [[Honduras]]. The pre-Hispanic peoples that lived in actual Honduras were primarily [[polytheism|polytheistic]] [[Maya people|Maya]] and other native groups. In the 16th century, [[Roman Catholicism]] was introduced by the [[Spanish Empire]].

==History==

===Ancient Religion===

The ancient [[Maya religion]] was an important religion in Copan (Honduras), between the fourth and seventh century AD.

===Post-Colonial Religion===
The first [[Roman Catholic]] [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] celebrated in the continental [[New World]] was on August 14, 1502 in Punta Caxinas, which was two weeks after the supposed "discovery" of [[Honduras]] by [[Christopher Columbus]]. Since then, the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] began a process of converting and baptizing Honduran natives to the Catholic faith.
[[File:Mapa Miskito.png|thumb|right|The former British colony of [[Mosquito Coast]] is marked in red.]]
Honduras holds a small part of the former [[Mosquito Coast]] which came under British influence—now in the extreme southeast of the state. Protestant churches gained following in that sparsely populated area on the Caribbean coast, especially Anglicanism and the Moravian Church.

===Independence and freedom of religion===

[[File:Iglesiaduyure.JPG|thumb|Roman Catholic church in [[Duyure]], [[Honduras]]]]
The Honduran Constitution provides for [[freedom of religion]], and other laws and policies contributes to the generally free practice of religion.&lt;ref name=us/&gt; The law at all levels protects this right in full against abuse, either by governmental or private actors.&lt;ref name=us/&gt; The Government generally respects religious freedom in practice.&lt;ref name=us/&gt; In 2008, the US Government received no reports of societal abuses or discrimination in Honduras based on religious affiliation, belief, or practice.&lt;ref name=us/&gt;

===20th century===

In recent years, the principal religious groups are [[Roman Catholic]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]], [[Lutheran]], [[Jehovah's Witness]], [[Mennonite]], approximately 300 evangelical Protestant groups, and [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormon).&lt;ref name=us/&gt;

The Catholic Church in [[Honduras]] is composed of eight [[dioceses]]: [[Tegucigalpa]], [[Comayagua]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Choluteca|Choluteca]], [[Olancho]], [[Yoro]], [[San Pedro Sula]], [[Trujillo, Honduras|Trujillo]] and [[Copán]] which are a part of the Conference Episcopal of [[Honduras]].

The Protestant churches are structured by three confederacies: The Shepherds' Association of Honduras, the Evangelical Brotherhood of Honduras and the Apostolic Network of Honduras.

Both the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] as well as the [[Protestant]] churches, especially the [[Pentecostal]] denominations, have experienced growth thanks in large part to modern forms of mass communication in recent decades.

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] built a temple in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, making it one of the six LDS temples in Central America.

The most prominent evangelical churches in the country include the "Abundant Life", the "Living Love", and the [[Great Commission Church|Great Commission]] Churches.&lt;ref name=us/&gt; A growing number of evangelical churches have no denominational affiliation.&lt;ref name=us/&gt; The National Association of Evangelical Pastors represents the evangelical leadership.&lt;ref name=us/&gt; There are small numbers of [[Islam in Honduras|Muslims]] and [[Judaism|Jews]].&lt;ref name=us/&gt; [[San Pedro Sula]] has a mosque and a synagogue, and [[Tegucigalpa]] has a synagogue.&lt;ref name=us/&gt;

==Statistics==
There are no reliable government statistics on religious affiliation in [[Honduras]].&lt;ref name=us&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2008/108530.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2008: Honduras]. [[U.S. Department of State]] (2008). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 nationwide survey, CID-Gallup reported that:

47 percent of respondents identify themselves as [[Roman Catholicism in Honduras|Roman Catholic]],
36 percent as [[evangelicalism|evangelical Protestant]], 
and 17 percent either provide no answer or consider themselves "other".&lt;ref name=us/&gt;

'''SIL International''' (formerly known as the '''Summer Institute of Linguistics''') is a [[United States|U.S.-based]], worldwide, [[Christian]] non-profit organization, whose main purpose is to study, develop and document [[language]]s, especially those that are lesser-known, in order to expand [[linguistics|linguistic]] knowledge, promote [[literacy]], translate the Christian [[Bible]] into local languages, and aid [[minority language]] development.

The organization was founded by Presbyterian minister [[William Cameron Townsend]], an American missionary to Guatemala, where he worked among the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel Maya people]].  In 1933, Townsend turned to Mexico with the purpose of translating the Bible into indigenous languages there, as he had done for Kaqchikel. Townsend established a working relation with the Mexican ministry of education under the progressive government of [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] and founded SIL to educate linguist-missionaries to work in Mexico.  Through the following decades the SIL linguists worked at providing literacy education to indigenous people of Mexico, while simultaneously working with SIL's partner organization, [[Wycliffe Bible Translators]], also founded by Townsend, to translate the Bible into the languages where they were working.  SIL gradually extended its work to other regions of the world where indigenous languages were spoken, including [[Papua New Guinea]], Southeast Asia and Africa.  While initially SIL's staff only received basic training in linguistics and anthropology, gradually the organization has become more professional, and today many members have advanced degrees.

SIL has more than 6,000 members from over 50 countries.  Based on their language documentation work, SIL publishes a database, ''[[Ethnologue]]'', of its research into the world's languages, and develops and publishes software programs for language documentation, such as FieldWorks Language Explorer (FLEx) and Lexique Pro.  SIL holds formal consultative status with the [[United Nations]], has been recognized by [[UNESCO]] for their contributions in Asia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unescobkk.org/index.php?id=2900 Appeal: SIL (Summer Institute of Linguistics) International&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and is a member of the [[Forum of Bible Agencies International]].

Its headquarters are located in [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]].

== History ==
[[William Cameron Townsend]], a Presbyterian minister, founded the organization in 1934. In the early 1930s, Townsend worked as a [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]] [[missionary]] among the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel Maya people]] in Guatemala. In 1933, he turned to Mexico with the purpose of translating the Bible into indigenous languages there, as he had done for Kaqchikel. Townsend established a working relationship with the Mexican [[Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico)|Secretariat of Public Education]] under the government of President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] (in office 1934-1940) and founded SIL to educate linguist-missionaries to work in Mexico. Because the Mexican government did not allow missionary work through its educational system, Townsend founded [[Wycliffe Bible Translators]] in 1942 as a separate organization from SIL. Wycliffe Bible Translators focused on Bible translation and missionary activities whereas SIL focused on linguistic documentation and literacy education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Hartch |first = Todd |year = 2006 |title = Missionaries of the State: The Summer Institute of Linguistics, State Formation, and Indigenous Mexico, 1935–1985 |publisher = University of Alabama Press |location = Tuscaloosa, [[Alabama|AL]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having initiated the collaboration with the Mexican education authorities, Townsend started the institute as a small summer training session in [[Sulphur Springs, Benton County, Arkansas|Sulphur Springs, Arkansas]] in 1934 to train missionaries in basic [[Linguistics|linguistic]], [[Anthropology|anthropological]], and translation principles.  Through the following decades the SIL linguists worked at providing literacy education to indigenous people of Mexico, while simultaneously working with the Wycliffe Bible Translators on Bible translation.  One of the students at the first summer institute in its second year, 1935, [[Kenneth Lee Pike]] (1912–2000), would become the foremost figure in the history of SIL.  He served as SIL's president from 1942 to 1979, then as president emeritus until his death in 2000.

In 1979, SIL's agreement with the Mexican government was officially terminated{{by whom|date=April 2016}} after critiques from anthropologists regarding the combination of education and missionary activities in indigenous communities, though SIL continued to be active in that country.{{Sfn | Clarke | 2001 | p = 182 }}  At a conference of the Inter-American Indian Institute in [[Mérida, Yucatán]], in November 1980, delegates denounced the Summer Institute of Linguistics, charging that it was using a scientific name to conceal its [[Protestant]] agenda and an alleged [[Capitalism|capitalist]] view that was alien to indigenous traditions.{{Sfn | Bonner | 1999 | p = 20 }} This led to the agreement with the [[Ecuador]]an government being terminated in 1980,{{Sfn | Yashar | 2005 | p = 118 }} although a token presence remained.  In the early 1990s, the [[Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador]] (CONAIE) demanded the expulsion of SIL from the country.{{Sfn | Yashar | 2005 | p = 146 }}  SIL was also expelled from [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], and [[Panama]], and restricted in [[Colombia]] and [[Peru]].{{Sfn | Cleary | Steigenga | 2004 | p = 36}}   {{As of | 2016 }}, SIL operates in several of those countries.&lt;ref name = "Worldwide" /&gt;

From the 1950s to 1987 the [[University of Oklahoma]] in [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]] hosted SIL training. The agreement between the university and SIL was terminated{{by whom|date=April 2016}} in 1987 after a controversy about SIL's involvement in missionary activities and its relationship with Latin American governments.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}. As of 2018, SIL training is offered in about 25 locations around the world.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sil.org/training/training-programs-language-development&lt;/ref&gt;

SIL's {{as of | 2016 | lc = on}} current president, Dr. John Watters, took office in 2008 after serving as executive director from 2000 to 2007.

== Contributions ==
SIL's principal contribution to linguistics has been the data that has been gathered and analyzed from over 1,000 minority and endangered languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.sil.org/SOCIOLX/NDG-LG-GRPS.HTML | title = Endangered Language Groups | publisher = SIL }}.&lt;/ref&gt; many of which had not been previously studied academically. SIL endeavors to share both the data and the results of analysis in order to contribute to the overall knowledge of language. This has resulted in publications on languages such as [[Hixkaryana language|Hixkaryana]] and [[Pirahã language|Pirahã]], which have challenged the universality of some linguistic theories. SIL's work has resulted in over 20,000 technical publications, all of which are listed in the SIL Bibliography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = https://www.sil.org/resources/language-culture-archives | title = Language and Culture Archives | contribution = Bibliography | publisher = SIL }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of these are a reflection of linguistic fieldwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.sil.org/linguistics/fieldwork.html | title = Linguistics | contribution = Fieldwork | publisher = SIL }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

SIL's focus has not been on the development of new linguistic theories, but [[tagmemics]], though no longer promoted by SIL, was developed by [[Kenneth Pike]], who also coined the words [[emic and etic]], more widely used today in anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Headland et. al. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another focus of SIL is literacy work, particularly in indigenous languages. SIL assists local, regional, and national agencies that are developing formal and informal education in vernacular languages. These cooperative efforts enable new advances in the complex field of educational development in multilingual and multicultural societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.sil.org/sil/ | title = About | publisher = SIL International | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051124141723/http://www.sil.org/sil/ | archivedate = 2005-11-24 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

SIL provides instructors and instructional materials for linguistics programs at several major institutions of higher learning around the world. In the [[United States]], these include [[Biola University]], [[Moody Bible Institute]], [[Houghton College]], [[University of North Dakota]], the [[Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics]], and [[Dallas Theological Seminary]]. Other universities with SIL programs include [[Trinity Western University]] in [[Canada]], [[Charles Darwin University]] in [[Australia]], and Universidad Ricardo Palma in Lima, Peru.

The organization has recently established a new Language and Culture Documentation Services Unit that aims to preserve and revitalize languages threatened by extinction. The creation of this department reflects a growing interest in documenting endangered languages and incorporates a multidisciplinary approach of anthropology and linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.sil.org/language-culture-documentation | title = Language and Culture Documentation | publisher = SIL }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

SIL also presents the fruits of some of its research through the International Museum of Cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.internationalmuseumofcultures.org/ | title = The International Museum of Cultures | publisher = SIL }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Located in [[Dallas]], it was developed by linguists and anthropologists associated with SIL International for the purpose of celebrating peoples of diverse cultures in an effort to promote greater appreciation and understanding of cultural differences.

== Methodological contributions ==
=== Ethnologue and ISO 639-3 codes ===
{{main article|Ethnologue}}

''Ethnologue: A Guide to the World's Languages'', is published by SIL.&lt;ref&gt;Stepp, John Richard, Hector Castaneda, and Sarah Cervone. "Mountains and biocultural diversity." Mountain Research and Development 25, no. 3 (2005): 223-227. "For the distribution of languages we used the Ethnologue database produced by the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL). Ethnologue is widely regarded as the most comprehensive data source of current languages spoken worldwide."&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with the 16th edition in 2009, ''Ethnologue'' uses the [[ISO 639-3]] standard, which assigns 3-letter codes to languages; these were derived in part from the 3-letter codes that were used in the ''Ethnologue''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s 15th edition. SIL is the [[registration authority]] for the ISO 639-3 standard. The 15th edition, which was published in 2005, includes 7,299 codes. A 16th edition was released in the middle of 2009, a 17th in 2013, and an 18th in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hammarström | first1 = Harald | year = 2015 | title = Ethnologue 16/17/18th editions: A comprehensive review | url = | journal = Language | volume = 91 | issue = 3 | pages = 723–737 | doi = 10.1353/lan.2015.0038 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Software ===
SIL has developed widely-used software for linguistic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Software |url = http://www.sil.org/resources/software |website=SIL International }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adapt It is a tool for translating text from one language into a related language after performing limited linguistic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Adapt It |website=SIL Software Catalog |url = http://www-01.sil.org/computing/catalog/show_software.asp?id=105 |publisher=SIL International }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of [[Computational lexicology|lexicon collection]], ShoeBox, the newer ToolBox (Field Linguist's Toolbox),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Toolbox Information |url = http://www-01.sil.org/computing/toolbox/information.htm |website = SIL Software Catalog |publisher=SIL International }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lexique Pro&lt;ref&gt;Guérin, Valérie, and Sébastien Lacrampe.

of discourse features, and morphological analysis. An important part of FLEx is its "linguistfriendly" morphological parser (Black and Simons, 2006), which uses an underlying model of morphology familiar to linguists, is fully integrated into lexicon development and interlinear text analysis, and produces a human-readable grammar sketch as well as a machine-interpretable parser. The morphological parser is constructed "stealthily" in the background, and can help a linguist by predicting glosses for interlinear texts."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Bush |first = Ann |title=Download |url= http://fieldworks.sil.org/download/ |website=SIL FieldWorks |publisher=SIL International }}&lt;/ref&gt; for linguists and WeSay (also Windows and Linux)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=tarmstrong |title=WeSay on Linux |url = http://wesay.palaso.org/2012/11/16/wesay-on-linux/ |website=WeSay.Palaso.org |publisher=SIL International |date=16 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130702141020/http://wesay.palaso.org/2012/11/16/wesay-on-linux/ |archivedate=2 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for non-professionals.

=== Fonts ===
SIL has developed several widely used font sets that it makes available as [[free software]] under the [[SIL Open Font License]] (OFL).&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, Michael, and Elke Karan. "Factors in designing effective orthographies for unwritten languages." SIL International (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The names of SIL fonts reflect the Biblical mission of the organization "''charis''" (Greek for "grace"), "''doulos''" (Greek for "servant") and "''gentium''" (Latin for "of the nations"). These fonts have become standard resources for linguists working on the documentation of the world's languages.{{sfn|Dobrin|Good|2009}} Most of them are designed only for specific writing systems, such as [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethiopic]], [[Devanagari]], [[New Tai Lue alphabet|New Tai Lue]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Khmer alphabet|Khmer]], [[Yi script|Yi]], [[Myanmar script|Myanmar]], [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]], and [[Tai Viet script|Tai Viet]], or some more technical notation, such as [[Numbered musical notation|cipher musical notation]] or [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]. Fonts that support Latin include:
* [[Gentium]]: "a typeface family designed to enable the diverse ethnic groups around the world who use the Latin, Cyrillic and Greek scripts to produce readable, high-quality publications. It supports a wide range of Latin- and Cyrillic-based alphabets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://software.sil.org/gentium/ |title= Gentium |website=SIL: Software &amp; Fonts |publisher=SIL International |accessdate=20 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Doulos SIL]]: "a Unicode serif font similar in design to [[Times New Roman|Times/Times New Roman]]. It contains a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost any Roman- or Cyrillic-based writing system, whether used for phonetic or orthographic needs. In addition, there is provision for other characters and symbols useful to linguists. It contains near-complete coverage of all the characters defined in Unicode 7.0 for Latin and Cyrillic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sil.org/resources/software_fonts/doulos-sil |title=Doulos SIL |website=SIL: Software &amp; Fonts |publisher=SIL International |accessdate=20 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, M.

*[[Charis SIL]]: "a Unicode-based font family that supports the wide range of languages that use the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. It is specially designed to make long texts pleasant and easy to read, even in less than ideal reproduction and display environments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sil.org/resources/software_fonts/charis-sil |title=Charis SIL |website=SIL: Software &amp; Fonts|publisher=SIL International |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/ipa-unicode.htm |title=IPA transcription in Unicode |last=Wells |first=John |authorlink=John C.

== Recognitions ==
The 1947 Summer Meeting of the [[Linguistic Society of America]] passed a resolution that the work of SIL "should be strongly commended by our Society and welcomed as one of the most promising developments in applied linguistics in this country."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | page = 4 | title = Proceedings | publisher = The Linguistic Society of America | year = 1947 | journal = Language | volume = 24 | number = 3 | jstor = 522186}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

SIL holds formal consultative status with [[UNESCO]] and the [[United Nations]], and has been publicly recognized by UNESCO for their work in many parts of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.unescobkk.org/index.php?id=2900 | title = Appeal: SIL (Summer Institute of Linguistics) International | publisher = Unesco BKK }}.&lt;/ref&gt; SIL also holds [[non-governmental organization]] status in many countries.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

SIL's work has received appreciation and recognition in a number of international settings. In 1973, SIL was awarded the [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] for International Understanding. This foundation honors outstanding individuals and organizations working in Asia who manifest greatness of spirit in service to the peoples of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Response/ResponseSIL.htm | year = 1973 | title = Ramon Magsaysay Awardee for International Understanding | contribution = Summer Institute of Linguistics}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  UNESCO Literacy Prizes have been awarded to SIL's work in a number of countries: Australia (1969), Cameroon (1986), Papua New Guinea (1979), Philippines (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.unesco.org/education/prizewinners_1967_2001.pdf | publisher = UNESCO | title = Literacy Prize winners 1967–2001 | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The organization's focus on language description, language development and Bible translation, and the missionary activities carried out by many of its field workers have been criticized by linguists and anthropologists who argue that SIL aims to change indigenous cultures, which exacerbates the problems that cause [[endangered language|language endangerment]] and [[language death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Epps | first = Patience | year = 2005 | contribution = Language endangerment in Amazonia: The role of missionaries | title = Bedrohte Vielfalt: Aspects of Language Death | editor1-first = Jan | editor1-last = Wolgemuth | editor2-first = Tyko | editor2-last = Dirksmeyer | publisher = Berliner Beiträge zur Linguistik | location = Berlin: Weissensee }}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hvalkof|Aaby|1981}}{{Sfn|Errington|2008|pp=153-162}} Linguists have argued that the missionary focus of SIL makes relations with academic linguists and their reliance on SIL software and knowledge infrastructure problematic in that respective goals, while often overlapping, also sometimes diverge considerably.{{sfn|Dobrin|2009}}{{sfn|Dobrin|Good|2009}}

SIL does not consider efforts to change cultural patterns a form of culture destruction and points out that all their work is based on the voluntary participation of indigenous peoples. In the SIL view, [[ethnocide]] is not a valid concept and it would lead to pessimism to characterize culture change resulting from the inevitable progress of civilization as ethnocide.{{sfn |Olson|2009}}{{sfn |Dobrin| 2009}} SIL considers itself as actively protecting endangered languages by promoting them within the speech community and providing mother-tongue literacy training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Cahill | first = Michael | year = 2004 | title = From endangered to less endangered: Case studies from Brazil and Papua New Guinea | publisher = SIL | series = Electronic Working Papers | id = 2004-004 | url = http://www.sil.org/silewp/2004/silewp2004-004.htm | accessdate = August 5, 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dobrin| 2009}} Additionally, their expanded interest in preserving threatened languages has resulted in the creation of a new Language and Culture Documentation Services Unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.sil.org/language-culture-documentation | title = Language and Culture Documentation | publisher = SIL }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1970s, a field research established that [[Sai Baba of Shirdi|Sai Baba]] was born in [[Pathri]] village. ''Sri Sai Smarak Samiti'' (Sai Memorial committee) was then formed in Pathri. A committee purchased land for temple on site of Sai Baba's house and construction of the temple was started in 1994. In 1999 the temple was inaugurated to the public.&lt;ref name="Desai2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sonavi Desai|title=Spiritual Masters: Sai Baba|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o6pPD-gz7IQC&amp;pg=PA195|year=2003|publisher=Indus Source|isbn=978-81-87967-64-4|pages=195–}}&lt;/ref&gt;*&lt;ref name="Ruhela"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. S.

[[File:Munchhausen StPantaleon 50.JPG|thumb|''[[Saint Catherine of Siena|St Catherine]] fainting from the stigmata'' by [[Il Sodoma]], Church of Saint Pantaleon, [[Alsace, France]]]]
'''Stigmata''' (singular ''stigma'') is a term used in [[Christian mysticism]] to describe the manifestations of bodily wounds, scars and pain in locations corresponding to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] [[Five Holy Wounds|wounds]] of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]], such as the hands, wrists, and feet.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/stigmata |title=Stigmata (Christian Mysticism) |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |language=en |access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual bearing the wounds of stigmata is referred to as a '''stigmatist''' or a '''stigmatic'''.

The term originates from the line at the end of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]]'s [[Letter to the Galatians]] where he says, "I bear on my body the marks of Jesus." ''Stigmata'' is the plural of the Greek word στίγμα ''stigma'', meaning a mark, tattoo,&lt;ref name = "Jones"&gt;Jones, C. P. (1987). ''Stigma: Tattooing &amp; Branding in Graeco-Roman Antiquity''. Journal of Roman Studies 77: 139-155.&lt;/ref&gt; or brand such as might have been used for identification of an animal or [[slave]].

Stigmata are primarily associated with the [[Roman Catholic]] faith. Many reported stigmatics are members of Catholic religious orders.&lt;ref name="mystical"&gt;Poulain, A. (1912). Mystical Stigmata. In [[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]. New York: [[Robert Appleton Company]]. Retrieved July 1, 2008 from [[New Advent]]: http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14294b.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
St. [[Francis of Assisi]] was the first recorded stigmatic in Christian history. For over fifty years, St. Padre [[Pio of Pietrelcina]] of the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin]] reported stigmata which were studied by several 20th-century physicians.

A high percentage (perhaps over 80%) of all stigmatics are women.&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;Carroll, Michael P. (1989). ''Catholic Cults and Devotions: A Psychological Inquiry''. McGill-Queen's University Press. pp. 80-84. {{ISBN|0-7735-0693-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Stigmata: A Medieval Phenomenon in a Modern Age'', Ted Harrison suggests that there is no single mechanism whereby the marks of stigmata were produced. What is important is that the marks are recognised by others as of religious significance.&lt;ref name="Harrison 1994"/&gt; Most cases of stigmata have been debunked as trickery.&lt;ref name="Carroll 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nickell 2004"/&gt; Some cases have also included reportings of a mysterious chalice in visions being given to stigmatics to drink from or the feeling of a sharp sword being driven into ones chest.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/The_stigmata_tr_from_The_Mystik_ed_by_H.html?id=8bUCAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Cigoli, san francesco.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Saint Francis of Assisi]] contemplating the wounds of stigmata as part of the ''[[Imitation of Christ]]''.&lt;ref name=Goff &gt;''Saint Francis of Assisi'' by Jacques Le Goff 2003 {{ISBN|0-415-28473-2}} page 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Miles160&gt;Miles, Margaret Ruth. (2004). ''The Word Made Flesh: A History of Christian Thought''. Wiley. pp. 160-161. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-0846-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Reported cases of stigmata take various forms. Many show some or all of five [[Holy Wounds]] that were, according to the [[Bible]], inflicted on Jesus during his crucifixion: wounds in the wrists and feet, from nails; and in the side, from a lance. Some stigmatics display wounds to the forehead similar to those caused by the [[Crown of Thorns]].&lt;ref name=Carroll /&gt; Stigmata as crown of thorns appearing in the 20th century, e.g. on [[Marie Rose Ferron]], have been repeatedly photographed.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Freze, 1993, ''They bore the wounds of Christ'', OSV Publishing {{ISBN|0-87973-422-1}} page 125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Stigmatist: Marie-Rose Ferron'' by Jeanne S. Bonin 1988 {{ISBN|2-89039-161-2}} page 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Religion and American cultures: an encyclopedia of traditions, Volume 1'' by Gary Laderman, Luís D. León 2003 {{ISBN|1-57607-238-X}} page 336&lt;/ref&gt; Other reported forms include tears of blood or sweating blood, and wounds to the back as from [[scourging]].

Many stigmata show recurring bleeding that stops and then starts, at times after receiving [[Holy Communion]], and a significant portion of stigmatics have shown a strong desire to frequently receive Holy Communion.&lt;ref name=Carroll /&gt; A relatively high percentage of stigmatics also exhibit [[inedia]], claiming to live with minimal (or no) food or water for long periods of time, except for the Holy Eucharist. Some exhibit weight loss, and closer investigation often reveals evidence of fakery.&lt;ref name=Carroll /&gt;

Some stigmatics claim to feel the pain of wounds with no external marks; these are referred to as "invisible stigmata".&lt;ref name=Carroll /&gt; Some stigmatics' wounds do not appear to clot, and seem to stay fresh and uninfected. The blood from the wounds is said, in some cases, to have a pleasant, perfumed odor, known as the [[Odour of Sanctity]].

Individuals who have obtained the stigmata are many times described as [[Religious ecstasy|ecstatics]], overwhelmed with emotions upon receiving the stigmata. No case of stigmata is known to have occurred before the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name="advent"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14294b.htm |title = Catholic Encyclopedia: Mystical Stigmata |accessdate = 2008-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his paper ''Hospitality and Pain,'' Christian [[theologian]] [[Ivan Illich]] states: "Compassion with Christ... is faith so strong and so deeply incarnate that it leads to the individual embodiment of the contemplated pain." His thesis is that stigmata result from exceptional poignancy of religious faith and desire to associate oneself with the suffering [[Messiah]].

==Specific cases==

===Saint Francis of Assisi===
[[File:El Greco - The Stigmatization of St Francis - WGA10562.jpg|thumb|St. [[Francis of Assisi]]]]
St. [[Francis of Assisi]] is the first recorded stigmatic in Christian history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1163/whats-the-deal-with-stigmata |title=What's the deal with stigmata? |publisher=The Straight Dope |date=1998-02-20 |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1224, two years before his death, he embarked on a journey to [[La Verna|Mount La Verna]] for a forty-day fast. One morning near the feast of the [[Exaltation of the Cross]], a six-winged angel reportedly  appeared to Francis while he prayed.  As the angel approached, Francis could see that the angel was crucified. He was humbled by the sight, and his heart was filled with elation joined by pain and suffering. When the angel departed, Francis was purportedly left with wounds in his hands, feet, and side as if caused by the same lance that pierced Christ’s side. The image of nails immediately appeared in his hands and feet, and the wound in his side often seeped blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.franciscanfriarstor.com/archive/stfrancis/stf_stigmata_of_st_francis.htm |title=Stigmata of St. Francis of Assisi |publisher=Franciscan Friars T.O.R. |accessdate=2012-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307093413/http://www.franciscanfriarstor.com/archive/stfrancis/stf_stigmata_of_st_francis.htm |archivedate=2012-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional artistic depictions of the incident, Francis is accompanied by a Franciscan brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|jstor=25151940 |title=Sasseta: crucifixion with St. Francis |publisher=Cleveland Museum of Art }}&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Francis' first biographer, [[Thomas of Celano]], reports the event as follows in his 1230 ''First Life of St. Francis'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When the blessed servant of God saw these things he was filled with wonder, but he did not know what the vision meant. He rejoiced greatly in the benign and gracious expression with which he saw himself regarded by the seraph, whose beauty was indescribable; yet he was alarmed by the fact that the seraph was affixed to the cross and was suffering terribly. Thus Francis rose, one might say, sad and happy, joy and grief alternating in him. He wondered anxiously what this vision could mean, and his soul was uneasy as it searched for understanding. And as his understanding sought in vain for an explanation and his heart was filled with perplexity at the great novelty of this vision, the marks of nails began to appear in his hands and feet, just as he had seen them slightly earlier in the crucified man above him.

His wrists and feet seemed to be pierced by nails, with the heads of the nails appearing on his wrists and on the upper sides of his feet, the points appearing on the other side. The marks were round on the palm of each hand but elongated on the other side, and small pieces of flesh jutting out from the rest took on the appearance of the nail-ends, bent and driven back. In the same way the marks of nails were impressed on his feet and projected beyond the rest of the flesh. Moreover, his right side had a large wound as if it had been pierced with a spear, and it often bled so that his tunic and trousers were soaked with his sacred blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/stfran-lives.html |title=Medieval Sourcebook: Thomas of Celano: Lives of St. Francis |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the records of St. Francis' physical ailments and symptoms, Dr. Edward Frederick Hartung concluded in 1935 that he knew what health problems plagued St. Francis. Hartung believed that he had an eye ailment known as [[trachoma]] and [[Plasmodium malariae|quartan malaria]].&lt;ref name="Hartung 1935"&gt;Hartung, Edward Frederick. (1935). ''St. Francis and Medieval Medicine''. Annals of Medical History 7: 85-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quartan malaria infects the [[liver]], [[spleen]], and [[stomach]], causing the victim intense pain. One complication of quartan malaria occasionally seen around Francis' time is known as [[purpura]], a purple hemorrhage of blood into the skin. According to Hartung "If this were the case of St. Francis, he would have been afflicted by ''ecchymoses'', an exceedingly large ''purpura''. The purple spots of blood may have been punctured while in the wilderness and there appear as an open wound like that of Christ."&lt;ref name="Hartung 1935"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later medical hypothesis was proposed in 1987 to explain the wounds, it claimed that St. Francis may have contracted [[leprosy]].&lt;ref&gt;Schazlein, Joanne; Sulmasy, Daniel P. (1987). ''The Diagnosis of St. Francis: Evidence for Leprosy''. Franciscan Studies 47: 181-217.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saint Padre Pio of Pietrelcina===
[[File:Padre-Pio-young.jpg|thumb|A young [[Padre Pio]] showing the stigmata.]]
For over fifty years, Padre [[Padre Pio|Pio of Pietrelcina]] reported stigmata which were studied by several 20th-century physicians, whose independence from the Church is not known.&lt;ref name="time1"&gt;

The observations were reportedly inexplicable and the wounds never became infected.&lt;ref name="time1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="time2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Freze, 1989, ''They Bore the Wounds of Christ: The Mystery of the Sacred Stigmata'', OSV Publishing {{ISBN|0-87973-422-1}} page 283-285.&lt;/ref&gt; His wounds healed once, but reappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9375317 |title=Padre Pio |publisher=Britannica.com |date=1968-09-23 |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wounds were examined by Luigi Romanelli, chief physician of the City Hospital of [[Barletta]], for about one year. The physician Angelo Maria Merla noted that the wounds were not [[Tuberculosis|tubercular]] in origin but could not make an official diagnosis without further tests.&lt;ref name="Ruffin 1991"&gt;Ruffin, Barnard. (1991). ''Padre Pio: The True Story''. OSV Press. pp. 160-178. {{ISBN|0-87973-673-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surgeon [[Giorgio Festa]], a private practitioner, also examined them in 1920 and 1925.&lt;ref name="Ruffin 1991"/&gt; Professor [[Giuseppe Bastianelli]], physician to [[Pope Benedict XV]], examined the wounds, but no report of his examinations was made. Pathologist [[Amico Bignami]] of the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] also observed the wounds describing them as shallow. Festa who had originally agreed with Bignami later described the wounds as superficial when covered with a scab.&lt;ref name="Ruffin 1991"/&gt;

Giorgio Festa noted that "at the edges of the lesions, the skin is perfectly normal and does not show any sign of [[edema]], of penetration, or of redness, even when examined with a good magnifying glass".&lt;ref name="Ruffin 1991"/&gt; Dr. Alberto Caserta took [[X-ray]]s of the hands in 1954 and found no abnormality in the bone structure.&lt;ref name="Ruffin 1991"/&gt; Dr. Giuseppe Sala who worked as a physician for Pio between 1956-1968 commented that tests revealed his blood had no signs of abnormality.&lt;ref name="Ruffin 1991"/&gt;

There were both religious and non-religious critics who accused Padre Pio of faking his stigmata, saying he used [[Phenol|carbolic acid]] to make the wounds.  The historian Sergio Luzzatto recounted that in 1919, according to one document in the Vatican's archive, Pio had requested carbolic acid from a pharmacist. She said it was for sterilization.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;Quote: Maria De Vito said, "I was an admirer of Padre Pio and I met him for the first time on July 31, 1919...he gave me personally an empty bottle, and asked if I would act as a chauffeur to transport it back from Foggia to San Giovanni Rotondo with four grams of pure carbolic acid. ... He explained that the acid was for disinfecting syringes for injections. He also asked for other things, such as Valda pastilles." {{cite news|last=Moore|first=Malcolm| title = Italy's Padre Pio 'faked his stigmata with acid'| date = 2007-10-24| location =  Rome| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1567216/Italys-Padre-Pio-faked-his-stigmata-with-acid.html|accessdate = 2012-04-25| work=The Daily Telegraph}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2062103/Padre-Pio-used-carbolic-acid-make-stigmata.html "Italy's favourite saint Padre Pio 'used carbolic acid to self-inflict stigmata', claims historian"]. Retrieved 12 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amico Bignami]] in a report wrote that the wounds were caused by "[[Neurosis|neurotic]] [[necrosis]]". He suggested they had been inflicted unconsciously by [[suggestion]] and artificially maintained by [[iodine]] that Pio had used as a disinfectant.&lt;ref name="Ruffin 1991"/&gt;

In 1922, physician [[Agostino Gemelli]] wrote that Pio was a hysteric and his stigmata were self-induced, not of supernatural origin.&lt;ref name="Higgens 2006"&gt;Higgins, Michael W. (2006). ''Stalking the Holy: The Pursuit of Saint Making''. Anansi Press. p. 129. {{ISBN|0-88784-181-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gemelli also speculated that his wounds were kept open with carbolic acid.&lt;ref name="Higgens 2006"/&gt;

Throughout his life, Pio had hidden his wounds by wearing fingerless [[glove]]s. At death there were no wounds, only "unblemished skin".&lt;ref name="Nickell 2001"&gt;[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]].

The psychologist [[Leonard Zusne]] in his book ''Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking'' (1989) has written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cases of stigmatism fall into two categories: self-inflicted wounds, which may be either cases of fraud or of unconscious self-infliction, and those that are caused by emotional states... Self-induced (through autosuggestion) itching and subsequent scratching of which the individual is unaware is likely to occur in suggestible persons if the stimulus is a mental or actual picture of the Crucifixion used during meditation and if the main motive is to receive the stigmata. The motive behind that may be unconscious conflict and a desire to escape from an intolerable situation into invalidism where one's needs are taken care of. It then becomes a case of hysterical conversion reaction. Many cases of stigmatism can be explained as fraud or unconsciously self-inflicted wounds.&lt;ref&gt;Zusne, Leonard; Jones, Warren H. (1989). ''Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking''. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. pp. 54-56. {{ISBN|978-0-805-80507-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his ''Stigmata: A Medieval Phenomenon in a Modern Age'', Ted Harrison suggests that there is no single mechanism whereby the marks of stigmata were produced. Harrison found no evidence from a study of contemporary cases that the marks were supernatural in origin. He concluded, however, that marks of natural origin need not be hoaxes. Some stigmatics marked themselves in attempt to suffer with Christ as a form of piety. Others marked themselves accidentally and their marks were noted as stigmata by witnesses. Often marks of human origin produced profound and genuine religious responses.&lt;ref name="Harrison 1994"/&gt;

Harrison also noted that the male-to-female ratio of stigmatics, which for many centuries had been of the order of 7 to 1, had changed over the last 100 years to a ratio of 5:4.  Appearance of stigmata frequently coincided with times when issues of authority loomed large in the Church.  What was significant about stigmatics was not that they were predominantly men, but that they were non-ordained.  Having stigmata gave them direct access to the body of Christ without requiring the permission of the Church through the [[Eucharist]].  Only in the last century have [[Roman Catholic priest|priest]]s been stigmatized.&lt;ref name="Harrison 1994"&gt;{{Cite book

It has been suggested that rare cases of non self-induced stigmata may be explained by [[painful bruising syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Kluger 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Early, Loretta F; Lifschutz, Joseph E.

''OCCASIONAL PAPERS OF THE MUSEUM OF CULTURAL HISTORY'', University of California at Los Angeles, No. 3, 1975. pp. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; That these tutelary spirits are presented by the "itiriti snake" makes for a close analogue with the [[Seraph]] who endowed Francis of Assisi with his stigmata.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

'''Susan Denise Atkins''' (May 7, 1948&amp;nbsp;– September 24, 2009) was a convicted American murderer who was a member of [[Charles Manson]]'s "[[Manson Family|Family]]". Manson's followers committed a series of nine murders at four locations in [[California]], over a period of five weeks in the summer of 1969. Known within the Manson family as '''Sadie Mae Glutz''' or '''[[Helter Skelter (Manson scenario)#Beatles lyrics, as interpreted by Manson|Sexy Sadie]]''', Atkins was convicted for her participation in eight of these killings, including the most notorious, the [[Tate murders]]. She was [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]], which was subsequently [[Pardon|commuted]] to [[life imprisonment]]. Atkins was incarcerated from October 1, 1969, until her death, a period exactly one week short of 40 years.  At the time of her death, Atkins was California's longest-serving female inmate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/09/25/california.manson.atkins/index.html?eref=rss_us|title=Ex-Manson follower Susan Atkins dies|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cnn.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
{{More citations needed|section|date=March 2017}}
Born in [[San Gabriel, California]], the second of three children, Susan Atkins grew up in [[northern California]]. According to her, her parents, Jeanette and Edward John Atkins, were [[Alcoholism|alcoholics]].&lt;ref name="NYT_obit" /&gt; Her mother died of [[cancer]] in 1963. Over the next three years, Susan's life was disrupted by the gradual breakup of her family, frequent relocations, and her leaving home to live independently. Until she was 13 years old, Atkins and her family lived in a [[Middle class|middle-class]] home&lt;ref name="NYT_obit" /&gt; in the [[Cambrian Park, California|Cambrian Park]] area of [[San Jose, California]]. She was described by those who knew her as a quiet, self-conscious girl who belonged to her school's [[glee club]] and the local church choir. Two weeks before her mother was hospitalized for the final time, Susan arranged for members of the church choir to sing [[Christmas carol]]s under her bedroom window. After Jeanette Atkins' death, relatives were asked to help look after Susan and her two brothers.

Edward Atkins eventually moved to [[Los Banos, California]], with Susan and her younger brother Steven. When he found work on the [[San Luis Dam]] construction project, Edward left the two children behind to fend for themselves. Susan took a job during her junior year in school to support herself and Steven. Atkins had been an average student in [[Leigh High School]] in San Jose, but her grades deteriorated when she entered [[Los Banos High School]]. During this time, she lived with various relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Deutsch|first=Linda|title=Charles Manson follower Susan Atkins dies|url=http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20090925/US.Obit.Manson.Follower|agency=Associated Press|date=2009-09-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928062236/http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20090925/US.Obit.Manson.Follower/|archivedate=2009-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Atkins met Manson when he played guitar at the house where she was living with several friends. When the house was raided several weeks later by the police and Atkins was left [[Homelessness|homeless]], Manson invited her to join his group, who were embarking on a summer road trip in a converted school bus painted completely black. She was nicknamed "Sadie Mae Glutz" by Manson and a man who was creating a fake ID for her at the time. Atkins later claimed to have believed Manson was [[Jesus]]. The growing "Manson Family" settled at the [[Spahn Ranch]] in the [[San Fernando Valley]] in [[southern California]], where, on October 7, 1968, Atkins bore a son by Bruce White,&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Vickie (2011). ''Women Criminals: An Encyclopedia of People and Issues''. ABC-CLIO. p. 293; {{ISBN|0313337136}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom Manson called Zezozose Zadfrack Glutz. Atkins' parental rights were terminated once she was convicted of the murders and no one in her family would assume responsibility for the child. Her son was adopted and renamed from the time of her incarceration in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Transcript of Atkins' 2005 parole hearing.&lt;/ref&gt; She had no further contact with him.

==Murder of Gary Hinman==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
During the summer of 1969, Manson and his [[commune]] at Spahn's Ranch were attracting the attention of the police, who suspected them of auto thefts and were suspicious of the high number of underage runaways. In an attempt to raise money to move away to the desert, Manson encouraged [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealing]]. Purportedly, a botched drug scam by Family member [[Tex Watson|Charles "Tex" Watson]] led Manson to confront and shoot a man by the name of Bernard "Lotsapapa" Crowe. Manson believed he had killed Crowe, and he further believed Crowe was a [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]]. Neither was true.&lt;ref&gt;''Helter Skelter'', p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Manson feared retaliation from the Black Panthers and pressured his followers for more money. During this time someone suggested that an old friend, Gary Hinman, had just inherited a large sum of money. Manson hoped Hinman could be persuaded to join the commune and contribute his purported new inheritance.

Manson sent Atkins, [[Bobby Beausoleil]], and [[Mary Brunner]] to Hinman's home on July 25, 1969. When she pleaded guilty to murder, Atkins claimed she didn't know a crime was going to take place, although she wrote in her 1977 book that she went to Hinman's home to get money and knew that it was possible they were going to kill him. When Hinman insisted he had not inherited any money, Beausoleil beat him severely. When this didn't change Hinman's story, Manson showed up in person, and swung at his head with a sword, slicing his face and severely cutting his ear. Manson directed Atkins and Brunner to stay behind and tend to Hinman's wounds. Two days later, and after a phone call from Manson, Beausoleil had Hinman sign over the registrations to his cars and then fatally stabbed him twice. Beausoleil left a bloody hand print on the wall along with vague revolutionary words reportedly placed there in hopes of implicating the Black Panthers. Beausoleil was arrested on August 7, 1969, when he was found asleep in one of Hinman's vehicles. He was still wearing the bloodstained clothing he wore during the crime. The murder weapon was hidden in the tire well of the car's trunk.

==Sharon Tate and LaBianca murders==
On the evening of August 8, 1969, Manson gathered Atkins, [[Linda Kasabian]], and [[Patricia Krenwinkel]] in front of Spahn's Ranch and told them to go with Charles "Tex" Watson and do as they were told.&lt;ref&gt;''Helter Skelter'', pp. 350–351.&lt;/ref&gt; In Atkins' [[grand jury]] testimony, she stated that while in the car, Watson told the group they were going to a home to get money from the people who lived there and to kill them.&lt;ref name="transcript"&gt;[http://www.mansonfamilytoday.info/atkins-grand-jury-testimony.htm "Transcript of Atkins' Grand Jury Testimony"], Manson Family Today.&lt;/ref&gt;

Six people (includes Sharon Tate's baby) were murdered at the [[Beverly Hills, California|Benedict Canyon]] home where [[Roman Polanski]] and [[Sharon Tate]] lived: Tate (who was eight months [[Pregnancy|pregnant]]), [[Tate murders#Murders|Steven Parent]], [[Jay Sebring]], [[Tate murders|Wojciech Frykowski]], and [[Tate murders|Abigail Folger]]. Polanski, Tate's husband, was in Europe finishing work on a film project. Forensic evidence indicated that the murders were brutal. Just prior to leaving the residence, Atkins wrote "PIG" on the front door in Sharon Tate's blood.&lt;ref&gt;Transcript of Atkins' 1996 parole hearing.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following night, August 10, 1969, Manson commented that the murders at the Tate residence had been too messy and announced he'd have to take his followers out and "show them how it's done". Manson called Atkins, Krenwinkel, Watson, Linda Kasabian, [[Leslie Van Houten]], and [[Steve "Clem" Grogan]], and they left Spahn's Ranch. Driving most of the night, he eventually found the home of grocery store owner Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary in [[Los Feliz, Los Angeles|Los Feliz]], a section of northeastern [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Manson and Watson entered the home and tied the couple up at gunpoint, winning their compliance by convincing them they were only going to be robbed.&lt;ref&gt;''Manson, in his own words'', pp. 208, 212.&lt;/ref&gt; He then went back to the car and sent Krenwinkel and Van Houten inside to do as Tex said, once again directing them to leave writings in blood, and to hitchhike back to Spahn's Ranch.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Motivation==
At trial, the prosecution stated Manson's desire to start "[[Helter Skelter (Manson scenario)|Helter Skelter]]" (an [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[Ethnic conflict|race war]]) was the motive for the crimes. Initially, Manson told the group that during this war, they would hide in a hole in the desert and emerge when the war was over. He said the blacks would win the war, but would be unable to govern and would turn to Manson. In the weeks prior to the murders, Manson began to say that the war wasn't starting fast enough, and the group would have to start it by murdering wealthy white people. As evidence for this motive, several witnesses testified to Manson's statements regarding "Helter Skelter" and his obsession with [[The Beatles]]' music, and the individuals convicted for the murders have testified at various parole hearings that this was the motive (e.g., [[Leslie Van Houten]] testified to this at her 1993 parole hearing).&lt;ref&gt;Transcript of Leslie Van Houten's 1993 parole hearing.&lt;/ref&gt; During Beausoleil's trial for the murder of Hinman, the defense, in order to discredit the prosecution's case, argued that the crimes were copycat murders made to misdirect police suspicion away from Beausoleil. The prosecution discounted this claim. In her 1977 autobiography ''Child of Satan, Child of God'', Atkins also stated that the Tate/LaBianca murders were carried out to convince authorities that Beausoleil was the wrong suspect in the Hinman case.

In later years, prosecutor [[Vincent Bugliosi]] stated that he believed the murders had numerous, disparate motives, all of which served to benefit Manson.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bertice Berry]] Show'' (TV program), transcript: pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; The home where Tate and Polanski were living with friends was known to Manson and Watson, who had been there once and knew where it was, and Manson knew that wealthy, famous people lived there.&lt;ref&gt;''Helter Skelter'', pp. 627–628.&lt;/ref&gt; One former tenant of the home was [[Terry Melcher]], [[Doris Day]]'s son, a record producer who Manson believed had made promises to him which had never materialized. Prosecutor Bugliosi suggested Manson may have very briefly encountered the eventual murder victims when he went to the home looking for Melcher and was reportedly turned away by Sharon Tate's photographer.&lt;ref&gt;''Helter Skelter'', pp. 229–230.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and grand jury testimony==
On August 16, 1969, the police raided Spahn's Ranch in connection with auto thefts. The charges were later dropped and everyone was released. Soon after their release, Manson and his followers left Spahn Ranch for [[Barker Ranch]], another isolated location. However, the authorities were still suspicious of the group, raided the new location in October 1969, and arrested the group again on auto theft charges. It would be the last time many of them would be free. Just after this arrest, another member of the group implicated Atkins in the Hinman murder and she was charged with that crime.&lt;ref&gt;''Helter Skelter'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

While in jail, Atkins befriended two middle-aged career criminals, Virginia Graham and Veronica "Ronnie" Howard, to whom she confessed her participation in the Tate/LaBianca murders (for example, telling the women that she had stabbed Tate and tasted Tate's blood). They subsequently reported her statements to the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;''Helter Skelter'', pp. 118, 149.&lt;/ref&gt; This, combined with information from other sources, led to the arrests of Atkins and others involved in the Tate/LaBianca murders (Van Houten, Krenwinkel, Kasabian, and Watson).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Atkins agreed to testify for the prosecution in exchange for dropping the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]], and she then testified before the grand jury as to what had transpired on the nights of August 8 and 9, 1969.&lt;ref&gt;''Helter Skelter'', pp. 214, 216, 227, 283.&lt;/ref&gt; When asked if she were willing to testify knowing that she was not being given immunity, was not being freed of any of the charges, and  might incriminate herself in her trial testimony, she responded, "I understand this, and my life doesn't mean that much to me, I just want to see what is taken care of."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mansonfamilytoday.info/atkins-grand-jury-testimony.htm Grand Jury Proceedings : Susan Denise Atkins], December 15, 1969, mansonfamilytoday.info.&lt;/ref&gt;

Atkins told the grand jury that she stabbed Frykowski in the legs and held Tate down while Watson stabbed her. She also testified that Tate had pleaded for her life and that of her unborn child, to which Atkins replied, "Woman, I have no mercy for you." Her explanation to the grand jury was that this was talking to (convince) herself, and not addressed to Tate as, "I was told before we even got there no matter what they beg don't give them any leeway". She also denied her earlier statement to Howard and Graham that she had tasted Tate's blood.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;

Prior to the trial, Atkins discontinued her cooperation with the prosecution and repudiated her grand jury testimony. From the early 1970s onward however, Atkins told parole boards that her original grand jury testimony was truthful and accurate as to what transpired in the Tate home; however, it didn't completely match the forensics and autopsy reports.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Atkins alleged that the reason that she repudiated her grand jury testimony was that "Manson sent his followers to suggest that it might be better for me and my son if I decided not to testify against him".&lt;ref name=atkins&gt;Atkins' official website, myth of Helter Skelter page, retrieved August 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; She told her 1985 parole board that her son was legally adopted in either 1972 or 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins' parole hearing transcript, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Atkins claimed over the years that her participation in the crimes led by Manson was passive and that she did not actually kill anyone. In his 1978 memoir, Watson declared himself responsible for all of Tate's injuries,&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Charles, and Ray Hoekstra, ''Will You Die For Me?'' (1978), Revell, pp. 143, 161.&lt;/ref&gt; characterizing Atkins' initial confessions as exaggeration, jail house bragging, and a bid for attention, but despite this, she was overheard by Family member Barbara Hoyt cheerfully describing the Tate murders to another Family member, days after the events took place.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Tate/LaBianca trial==
Manson, Krenwinkel, Van Houten, and Atkins went on trial on June 15, 1970. Watson was later tried separately as he was at the time in [[Texas]] fighting [[extradition]]. Kasabian was offered, and accepted, [[legal immunity]]. As Kasabian had not played a direct part in any of the murders and never entered either residence,&lt;ref name="HelterSkelterWatson"&gt;{{cite book|title=Will You Die For Me?|author=Hoekstra, Ray|year=1978|publisher=Cross Roads Publications, Inc.|pages=Ch. 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by several accounts had challenged Manson over the killings, the offer of immunity to her was less bitterly contested, particularly by the prosecutor, [[Vincent Bugliosi]], who has commented that he was relieved the offer was withdrawn from Atkins.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

During the sentencing phase of the trial, Atkins testified that she stabbed Tate. She stated that she had stabbed Tate because she was "sick of listening to her, pleading and begging, begging and pleading". Little credibility was given to Atkins' testimony in general, as it frequently contradicted known facts. She claimed "(Manson) told us that we were going to have to get on the stand and claim we had deliberately and remorselessly, and with no direction from him at all, committed all the murders ourselves".&lt;ref name=atkins/&gt;

Throughout the trial, Atkins and her co-defendants attempted to disrupt proceedings and were noted for both their lack of [[remorse]] for their victims and lack of concern for their own [[wiktionary:fate|fate]]. They sang Manson-penned songs while being led to the courtroom. All four defendants were sentenced to [[Capital punishment|death]] on March 29, 1971. Atkins was transferred to California's new women's death row in April 1971.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Hinman trial==
After the Tate/LaBianca trial, Atkins was convicted for the Hinman murder. She pleaded guilty to the charges against her. She testified she had not known Hinman was to be robbed or killed, although she subsequently contradicted herself on this point in her 1977 autobiography.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Imprisonment==
Atkins arrived on California's death row on April 23, 1971. Atkins' death sentence was automatically [[Pardon|commuted]] to life in prison the next year following the [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]]'s ''[[People v. Anderson]]'' decision, which invalidated all death sentences imposed in California prior to 1972.&lt;ref&gt;CDCR, ''History of capital punishment in California''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, Atkins published her autobiography, ''Child of Satan, Child of God'', in which she recounted the time she spent with Manson and the family, her religious conversion, and her prison experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Child of Satan, Child of God: Her own story|first=Susan|last=Atkins|year=1977|publisher=Logos International|isbn=0882702297|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-LbAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=susan%20atkins&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1974 onwards, Atkins said she was a [[Born again|born-again Christian]] after seeing a vision of Jesus Christ in her cell. She became active in prison programs, teaching classes and received two commendations for assisting in emergency health interventions with other inmates, one of which was a [[suicide]] attempt.&lt;ref name="2005parole"&gt;{{cite web|title=Parole Hearing: Susan Atkins|url=http://www.cielodrive.com/susan-atkins-parole-hearing-2005.php|website=CieloDrive|location=Corona, CA|format=Transcript|date=1 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atkins married twice while in prison.&lt;ref name="Indep2009"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Susan Atkins|author=Michael Carlson|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=October 6, 2009|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-20845921.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130817073925/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-20845921.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=August 17, 2013|access-date=August 16, 2013}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first marriage was to Donald Lee Laisure on September 2, 1981. Atkins became the mercurial Laisure's 35th wife, but the two divorced after he sought to marry yet again.&lt;ref name="Indep2009"/&gt;

She married a second time, in 1987, to a man fifteen years her junior, James W. Whitehouse, a graduate of [[Harvard Law School]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boingboing.net/2010/03/10/little-billys-letter.html Letter from Susan Atkins-Whitehouse] see postscript&lt;/ref&gt; who represented Atkins at her 2000 and 2005 parole hearings. He maintained a website dedicated to her legal representation.&lt;ref&gt;King, pp. 281–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

During Atkins' 2000 parole hearing, Sharon Tate's sister, Debra, read a statement written by their father, Paul, which said in part, "Thirty-one years ago I sat in a courtroom with a jury and watched with others. I saw a young woman who giggled, snickered and shouted out insults; even while testifying about my daughter's last breath, she laughed. My family was ripped apart. If Susan Atkins is released to rejoin her family, where is the justice?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mansonfamilytoday.info/col-paul-tate-letter.htm Transcript of Paul Tate Letter Read at 2000 Hearing], MansonFamilyToday.info; accessed March 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2002, she told a LA Times reporter of her work to discourage teenagers from idolizing Manson and her hope of someday leaving prison to live in [[Laguna Beach, California]].&lt;ref name="2008OCWeekly"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moxley|first1=R.

In 2003, Atkins filed a lawsuit in federal court claiming that she was a "[[political prisoner]]" due to the repeated denials of her parole requests regardless of her suitability.&lt;ref&gt;AP, June 1, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PolPrisoner"&gt;{{cite web|title=Susan Atkins: I'm a Political Prisoner|url=http://www.talkleft.com/story/2003/06/01/258/70934/inmatesandprisons/Susan-Atkins-I-m-a-Political-Prisoner|website=TalkLeft|access-date=26 June 2017|date=31 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LR2003"&gt;{{cite web|title="Judge Dismisses 'Political Prisoner' Suit" By Manson Associate|url=http://www.legalreader.com/2003711judge-dismisses-political-prisoner-suit-by-manson-associate-html/|website=Legal Reader|access-date=26 June 2017|date=30 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 1, 2005, Susan Atkins had her 17th parole hearing; this resulted in a three-year denial. She was given less than six months to live and subsequently requested a "compassionate release" from prison.&lt;ref name=deniedrelease/&gt; In June, Atkins' attorney, Eric P. Lampel, stated that Atkins' condition had deteriorated to the point that she was paralyzed on one side, could only talk "a little bit", and could not sit up in bed without assistance.&lt;ref name=deniedrelease/&gt; The hearing was attended by various family members of the victims, including Debra Tate and members of the Sebring family, and they requested that her parole be denied. She received a four-year denial.&lt;ref name="2005parole"/&gt;

===Illness and compassionate release request===
In April 2008, it was revealed that Atkins had been hospitalized for more than a month with an undisclosed illness that was subsequently reported to be terminal [[Brain tumor|brain cancer]]. One leg had been amputated.

===Opinions on Atkins' release request===
Vincent Bugliosi, who prosecuted Atkins, said he was not opposed to her release given her current condition, adding that she had paid "substantially, though not completely, for her horrendous crimes. Paying completely would mean imposing the death penalty."&lt;ref&gt;Becerra, Hector. [http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/14/local/me-atkins14 "Tables turn as a brutal killer asks for mercy"], ''Los Angeles Times'', June 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Bugliosi stated he supported her release to save the state money. The cost for Atkins' medical care since she was hospitalized on March 18, 2008, "reportedly surpassed $1.15 million with additional cost of over $300,000 to guard her hospital room."&lt;ref name=deniedrelease/&gt; Bugliosi stated he was challenging the notion that "just because Susan Atkins showed no mercy to her victims, we therefore are duty-bound to follow her inhumanity and show no mercy to her."{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Former prosecutor Stephen R. Kay, who prosecuted Manson supporters, opposed Atkins' release, stating:

{{quote|Atkins married twice while in prison. For a long time, she got [[conjugal visit]]s and Sharon Tate and the others were dead and buried long ago. So I think it's a matter of principle that she should not be granted clemency.}}

Kay also stated that he had attended about 60 parole hearings related to the murders and spent considerable time with the victims' families, witnessing their suffering.&lt;ref name=Latimesprotest&gt;Blankstein, Andrew and Hector Becerra. [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-atkins15-2008jul15,0,5774006.story "Protests against Susan Atkins' release request expand"], ''Los Angeles Times'', July 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] District Attorney [[Steve Cooley]] stated that he was strongly opposed to the release, saying in a letter to the board it would be "an affront to people of this state, the California criminal justice system and the next of kin of many murder victims." Cooley wrote that Atkins' "horrific crimes alone warrant a denial of her request" and that she "failed to demonstrate genuine remorse and lacks insight and understanding of the gravity of her crimes."&lt;ref name=Latimesprotest/&gt; Suzan Hubbard, director of adult prisons in California, also recommended against granting Atkins' request. California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] opposed Atkins' release, stating that: "I don't believe in [compassionate release]. I think that they have to stay in, they have to serve their time&amp;nbsp;... [T]hose kinds of crimes are just so unbelievable that I'm not for the compassionate release."&lt;ref name=deniedrelease/&gt;

[[Orange County, California|Orange County]] District Attorney [[Tony Rackauckas]] also opposed Atkins' release, stating that "It would be a grave miscarriage of justice to burden the citizens of Orange County by paroling her to Orange County, where she can enjoy the comforts of her husband, home and mercy she did not show Sharon Tate [or] her unborn baby."&lt;ref name=Latimesprotest/&gt;

===Release hearing and results===
{{More citations needed|section|date=March 2017}}
The Board of Parole Hearings considered Atkins' request for compassionate release during its monthly meeting on July 15, 2008. During the 90-minute hearing, emotional pleas were made by both supporters and opponents of Atkins' release. The public hearing limited speakers' comments to five minutes each. After the board heard the case (as well as other agenda items), it retired to closed session for final deliberations. Due to her failing health, Atkins herself did not attend the hearing.

Debra Tate, the only surviving immediate relative of murder victim Sharon Tate, spoke in opposition to a compassionate release for Atkins, stating, "She will be set free when judged by God. It's important that she die in incarceration."&lt;ref name=deniedrelease/&gt; Pam Turner, a niece of Sharon Tate, also opposed Atkins' release, stating, "If she were capable of comprehending what our family's been through, she would be ashamed to come before this parole board and ask such a request." Anthony DiMaria, the nephew of murder victim Thomas Jay Sebring, also opposed Atkins' release, stating, "You will hear various opinions with respect to this today, but you will hear nothing from the nine people who lie in their graves and suffered horrendous deaths at the hands of Susan Atkins."&lt;ref name=PE1&gt;[http://www.pe.com/politics/miller/stories/PE_News_Local_S_atkins16.3f662b8.html "Parole board turns down dying Manson follower"] ''The Press Enterprise'', July 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gloria Goodwin Killian, director of ACWIP (Action Committee for Women in Prison) and a [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] legal researcher and prisoner advocate, spoke in support for Atkins' compassionate release, arguing, "Susan has been punished all that she can be. Short of going out to the hospital and physically torturing her, there is nothing left anyone can do to her. The people who are suffering are the people you see in this room today." In July 2008, Atkins' husband, James W. Whitehouse, told the board, "They tell me we're lucky if we have three months. It's not going to be fun. It's not going to be pretty."&lt;ref name=PE1/&gt;

The 11 members of the California Board of Parole Hearings ultimately declined to refer to the sentencing court Atkins' request for compassionate release in a unanimous decision after final deliberations. The decision — posted on its website — meant that Atkins' request would not be forwarded to the Los Angeles Superior Court that sentenced her, which would have had the final say as to whether or not she would be released.&lt;ref name=deniedrelease&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/07/15/release.denied/index.html "Ailing Manson follower denied release from prison".] ''[[CNN]]''. July 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 24, 2008, Atkins was transferred back to the [[Central California Women's Facility]] in [[Chowchilla, California]] to the facility's skilled nursing center.&lt;ref&gt;De Atley, Richard K. [http://www.pe.com/localnews/inland/stories/PE_News_Local_S_atkins22.3e6d90f.html "Ailing Manson follower transferred to Chowchilla facility"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330061552/http://www.pe.com/localnews/inland/stories/PE_News_Local_S_atkins22.3e6d90f.html |date=2010-03-30 }} ''The Press Enterprise'', November 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Atkins' minimum eligible parole date was October 6, 1976. Her initial parole consideration hearing was on September 14, 1976, at which time she was denied parole. Between 1976 and 2009, she was denied parole a total of 13 times. Prior to her 2009 parole hearing, a website maintained by Atkins' husband claimed that she was paralyzed over 85 percent of her body and unable to sit up or be transferred to a wheelchair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.susanatkins.org/ Atkins' website]&lt;/ref&gt; For the final time, Atkins was denied parole on September 2, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=8462901 |title=Dying Manson Murderer Denied Release |first=Sarah |last=Netter |author2=Lindsay Goldwert  |publisher=ABC News |date=2009-09-02 |access-date=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Szyk Haggadah''' is a [[Passover]] [[Haggadah]] that was illustrated by the Polish-Jewish artist [[Arthur Szyk]] in [[Poland]] between 1934 and 1936. Szyk's visual commentary on the ancient story of [[Passover]] uses the vocabulary and format of an [[illuminated manuscript]]; each of his 48 full-page [[watercolor]] and gouache illuminations contains the traditional text of the Haggadah (in [[Hebrew]] [[calligraphy]]), which is clarified and interpreted by the images and symbols on the same page.

Szyk first looked for a publisher for his Haggadah in mainland [[Europe]] in the mid-1930s but found that his contemporary telling of the Haggadah was met with skepticism. Publishers in [[Poland]], for example, were reluctant to publicize a book that drew a direct parallel between the contemporary policies of Nazi Germany and the genocidal tactics of the [[pharaoh]] of the biblical [[Book of Exodus]]. (Szyk did take the partial step of painting out the more obvious political references, such as the swastikas on the armbands of the ancient Egyptians who oversaw the Hebrew slaves. Other details, such as the [[Hitler]] moustache on the Wicked Son of "The Four Sons", remained.) Ultimately, the publishing house [[Beaconsfield Press]] was founded in [[London]] in 1937 for the express purpose of publishing The Szyk Haggadah. Szyk moved from [[Łódź]], Poland, to London to supervise every aspect of the book's production. Upon official release of the 1940 vellum edition, which was limited to 250 numbered copies and sold for US$500, The Szyk Haggadah was cited by ''[[The Times]]'' of London as "worthy to be placed among the most beautiful of books that the hand of man has produced". The Haggadah was dedicated to [[King George VI]] of England, who received one of the first copies. 

The Szyk Haggadah has been reproduced in popular trade editions in [[Jerusalem]] and elsewhere since 1956. A new luxury limited edition, produced by digital printing and with an updated translation and commentary by [[Byron Sherwin]], was published in 2008 by Historicana in Burlingame, California. The [[documentary film]] "In Every Generation: Understanding The Szyk Haggadah", directed by James Ruxin,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhJmRWQc6Yg ''In Every Generation: Remaking The Szyk Haggadah'', Historicana and JKR Productions, 2008] (first of several parts) Retrieved 2010-01-13&lt;/ref&gt; documents the history of The Szyk Haggadah and its contemporary remaking.

'''''The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe without Design''''' is a 1986 book by [[Richard Dawkins]], in which the author presents an explanation of, and argument for, the theory of [[evolution]] by means of [[natural selection]]. He also presents arguments to refute certain criticisms made on his first book, ''[[The Selfish Gene]]''. (Both books espouse the [[gene-centered view of evolution|gene-centric view of evolution]].) An unabridged [[audiobook]] edition was released in 2011, narrated by Richard Dawkins and [[Lalla Ward]].

== Overview ==

In his choice of the title for this book, Dawkins refers to the [[watchmaker analogy]] made famous by [[William Paley]] in his 1802 book ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity|Natural Theology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/apr/30/richard-dawkins-blind-watchmaker "Richard Dawkins' watchmaker still has the power to open our eyes", ''The Guardian'', 30 April 2010]. Accessed 24 Sept 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Paley, writing long before [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, held that the complexity of living organisms was evidence of the existence of a [[God|divine creator]] by drawing a parallel with the way in which the existence of a watch compels belief in an intelligent watchmaker. Dawkins, in contrasting the differences between human design and its potential for planning with the workings of natural selection, therefore dubbed evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker.

To dispel the idea that complexity cannot arise without the intervention of a "creator", Dawkins uses the example of the eye. Beginning with a simple organism, capable only of distinguishing between light and dark, in only the crudest fashion, he takes the reader through a series of minor modifications, which build in sophistication until we arrive at the elegant and complex mammalian eye. In making this journey, he points to several creatures whose various seeing apparatus are, whilst still useful, living examples of intermediate levels of complexity.

In developing his argument that natural selection can explain the complex adaptations of organisms, Dawkins' first concern is to illustrate the difference between the potential for the development of complexity as a result of pure randomness, as opposed to that of randomness coupled with cumulative selection. He demonstrates this by the example of the [[weasel program]]. Dawkins then describes his experiences with a more sophisticated [[computer simulation|computer model]] of artificial selection implemented in a program also called ''The Blind Watchmaker'', which was sold separately as a teaching aid (open source implementations are currently available,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ultrastudio.org/en/Biomorphs Biomorphs applet at Ultrastudio.org]&lt;/ref&gt; as are more advanced versions of the idea&lt;ref&gt;[http://EndlessForms.com EndlessForms.com]&lt;/ref&gt;).

The program displayed a two dimensional shape (a "biomorph") made up of straight black lines, the length, position, and angle of which were defined by a simple set of rules and instructions (analogous to a genome). Adding new lines (or removing them) based on these rules offered a discrete set of possible new shapes (mutations), which were displayed on screen so that the user could choose between them. The chosen mutation would then be the basis for another generation of biomorph mutants to be chosen from, and so on. Thus, the user, by selection, could steer the evolution of biomorphs. This process often produced images which were reminiscent of real organisms for instance [[beetles]], [[bat]]s, or [[tree]]s. Dawkins speculated that the unnatural selection role played by the user in this program could be replaced by a more natural agent if, for example, colourful biomorphs could be selected by butterflies or other insects, via a touch sensitive display set up in a garden.

[[File:BiomorphBounce.png|thumb|"Biomorph" that randomly evolves following changes of several numeric "genes", determining its shape. The gene values are given as bars on the top.]]

In an appendix to a later edition of the book (1996), Dawkins explains how his experiences with computer models led him to a greater appreciation of the role of [[developmental biology|embryological]] constraints on natural selection. In particular, he recognised that certain patterns of embryological development could lead to the success of a related ''group'' of species in filling varied ecological niches, though he emphasised that this should not be confused with  [[group selection]]. He dubbed this insight ''the evolution of evolvability''.

After arguing that evolution is capable of explaining the origin of complexity, near the end of the book Dawkins uses this to argue against the existence of God: "a deity capable of engineering all the organized complexity in the world, either instantaneously or by guiding evolution ... must already have been vastly complex in the first place ..." He calls this "postulating organized complexity without offering an explanation."

In the preface, Dawkins states that he wrote the book "to persuade the reader, not just that the Darwinian world-view ''happens'' to be true, but that it is the only known theory that ''could'', in principle, solve the mystery of our existence."

==Reception==
Tim Radford, writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', noted that despite Dawkins's "combative secular humanism", he had written "a patient, often beautiful book from 1986 that begins in a generous mood and sustains its generosity to the end." 30 years on, people still read the book, Radford argues, because it is "one of the best books ever to address, patiently and persuasively, the question that has baffled bishops and disconcerted dissenters alike: how did nature achieve its astonishing complexity and variety?"&lt;ref name="Radford"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Radford|first1=Tim |title=Richard Dawkins' watchmaker still has the power to open our eyes |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/apr/30/richard-dawkins-blind-watchmaker |publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=18 November 2016|date=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher and historian of biology, [[Michael T. Ghiselin]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', comments that Dawkins "succeeds admirably in showing how natural selection allows biologists to dispense with such notions as purpose and design". He notes that analogies with computer programs have their limitations, but are still useful. Ghiselin observes that Dawkins is "NOT content with rebutting creationists" but goes on to press home his arguments against [[Alternatives to evolution by natural selection|alternative theories to neo-Darwinism]]. He thinks the book fills the need to know more about evolution "that others [creationists] would conceal from them." He concludes that "Readers who are not outraged will be delighted."&lt;ref name="Ghiselin"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ghiselin |first1=Michael T. |authorlink1=Michael T. Ghiselin |title=We are all Contraptions |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/14/books/we-are-all-contraptions.html?pagewanted=all |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=18 November 2016 |date=14 December 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American philosopher of religion [[Dallas Willard]], reflecting on the book, denies the connection of evolution to the validity of arguments from design to God: whereas, he asserts, Dawkins seems to consider the arguments to rest entirely on that basis. Willard argues that Chapter 6, "Origins and Miracles", attempts the "hard task" of making not just a blind watchmaker but "a blind watchmaker watchmaker", which he comments would have made an "honest" title for the book. He notes that Dawkins demolishes several "weak" arguments, such as the argument from personal incredulity. He denies that Dawkins's computer "exercises" and arguments from gradual change show that complex forms of life could have evolved. Willard concludes by arguing that in writing this book, Dawkins is not functioning as a scientist "in the line of Darwin", but as "just a naturalist metaphysician".&lt;ref name="Willard"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Willard |first1=Dallas |authorlink1=Dallas Willard |title=Reflections on Dawkins' The Blind Watchmaker |url=http://www.dwillard.org/articles/artview.asp?artID=52 |publisher=Dallas Willard |accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The engineer [[Theo Jansen]] read the book in 1986 and became fascinated by evolution and natural selection. Since 1990 he has been building [[kinetic sculpture]]s, the ''[[Strandbeest]]'', capable of walking when impulsed by the wind.&lt;ref name="Jansen"&gt;{{es}}[http://espacio.fundaciontelefonica.com/theo-jansen/ Theo Jansen. Asombrosas criaturas]. An exhibition of Theo Jansen's work in Espacio [[Fundación Telefónica]], Madrid, Spain.&lt;/ref&gt;

The journalist Dick Pountain described [[Sean B. Carroll]]'s 2005 account of [[evolutionary developmental biology]], ''[[Endless Forms Most Beautiful (book)|Endless Forms Most Beautiful]]'', as the most important popular science book since ''The Blind Watchmaker'', "and in effect a sequel [to it]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pountain |first1=Dick |title=Nature's 3D printer exposes Pokemon Go as a hollow replica |journal=PC Pro|date=November 2016 |issue=265 |page=26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Fifth Plague of Egypt''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[Romanticism|Romantic]] English artist [[Joseph Mallord William Turner]] currently in the permanent collection at the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]. Despite its title, it depicts [[Moses]] cursing the Egyptians with a plague of hail and fire, known as the seventh plague.

==Description==
In the foreground, two dead horses and a dead man are piled together, casualties of the earlier plague of pestilence in livestock. To the right, Moses stands with his arms outstretched, cursing the Egyptians with a plague of hail and fire, far away from the engulfed city. In the background, tumultuous clouds swirl above the Egyptian city, which is denoted by the gleaming, white [[pyramid]] in the centre of the canvas. Thin, horizontal lines fall from the clouds, showing streaks of hail falling from the sky. The painting is dominated with dark, neutral tones, creating the feeling of gloom.

Although the painting would be categorised as a [[history painting]] for its display of a biblical scene, the painting comes across as a [[landscape painting]], clearly demonstrating Turner's training in landscapes. The sky and the scenery take precedence over the figure of Moses and his actions, instead turning him into part of the landscape. The painting shows the force of nature as a more important factor than the force of man, which is minuscule.

==Historical information==
Turner describes the seventh [[Plagues of Egypt|plague of Egypt]] that God cursed upon the Egyptians for punishment of not releasing the Israelites from slavery, as described in the [[Old Testament]] [[Book of Exodus]], 9:13–35. Turner possibly mislabelled this painting as the wrong plague when he submitted it, but the title has not changed.

Turner submitted this large-scale painting to the annual [[Royal Academy]] exhibition in London in 1800. The twenty-four-year-old Turner was eager to impress the London art critics, with the largest canvas submitted by a young artist. He attempted to show his virtuosity as a history painter, even when his landscape painting background is entirely evident.&lt;ref name="Plague"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fifth Plague of Egypt|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/collections/artwork/fifth-plague-egypt-joseph-mallord-william-turner|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner had only been accepted into the Royal Academy as an Associate Member in 1799, and was eager to show his place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turner, J.

===Acquisition===
The painting was purchased from Turner by William Beckford in April 1800. Henry Jeffrey purchased the painting in 1807, before selling it to Thomas Tutor. George Young acquired the painting by 1853, and it was at sale at Christies in London in 1866. The painting was purchased by Earl Grosvenor in 1866 and stayed in his possession until at least 1871. In 1876, the painting was bought by Sir Francis Cook, where the painting stayed until 1951. It was sold to Sir Alexander Corda by the Cook family. John Mitchell bought the painting in 1955; the IMA purchased the painting in the same year from Mitchell with funds from the Lilly family.&lt;ref name="Plague" /&gt;

'''''The Grand Design''''' is a [[Popular science|popular-science]] [[book]] written by [[physicist]]s [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Leonard Mlodinow]] and published by [[Bantam Books]] in 2010. The book examines the history of scientific knowledge about the universe and explains 11 dimension [[M-theory]]. The authors of the book point out that a [[Unified Field Theory]] (a theory, based on an early model of the [[universe]], proposed by [[Albert Einstein]] and other physicists) may not exist.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news|title=Book review: 'The Grand Design' by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-stephen-hawking-20100905,0,2573263.story|author=Michael Moorcock|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=2010-09-03 |date=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It argues that invoking God is not necessary to explain the origins of the universe, and that the [[Big Bang]] is a consequence of the laws of [[physics]] alone.&lt;ref name = CNN&gt;{{cite news|title=Stephen Hawking: God didn't create universe|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/09/02/hawking.god.universe/index.html?hpt=C1|publisher=CNN|author=Richard Allen Greene|accessdate=2010-09-04|date=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to criticism, Hawking has said; "One can't prove that God doesn't exist, but science makes God unnecessary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/stephen-hawking-science-makes-god-unnecessary/story?id=11571150|title=Stephen Hawking: 'Science Makes God Unnecessary'|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=2015-05-01|date=2010|author=Nick Watt}}&lt;/ref&gt; When pressed on his own religious views by the [[Channel 4]] documentary ''[[Genius of Britain]]'', he has clarified that he does not believe in a personal God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stephen Hawking: God was not needed to create the Universe|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/7976594/Stephen-Hawking-God-was-not-needed-to-create-the-Universe.html|author=Laura Roberts|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=2010-09-02|accessdate=2015-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Has Stephen Hawking ended the God debate?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/7979211/Has-Stephen-Hawking-ended-the-God-debate.html|author=Graham Farmello|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=2010-09-03|accessdate=2015-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book examines the history of scientific knowledge about the universe. It starts with the [[Ionic Greek|Ionian]] [[Greeks]], who claimed that nature works by laws, and not by the will of the gods. It later presents the work of [[Copernicus|Nicolaus Copernicus]], who advocated the concept that the Earth is not located in the center of the universe.&lt;ref name = cosmology&gt;{{cite news|title=Review of 'The Grand Design,' by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/03/AR2010090302118.html|author=James Trefil |publisher=Washington Post |accessdate=2010-09-05 |date=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors then describe the theory of [[quantum mechanics]] using, as an example, the probable movement of an [[electron]] around a room. The presentation has been described as easy to understand by some reviewers, but also as sometimes "impenetrable," by others.&lt;ref name=NYT090910/&gt;&lt;ref name = cosmology /&gt;

The central claim of the book is that the theory of [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[theory of relativity]] together help us understand how universes could have formed out of nothing.&lt;ref name = cosmology /&gt;

The authors write: {{cquote|Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing. Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going.|author=Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow|source=''The Grand Design'', 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=God did not create the universe, says Hawking|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/09/02/us-britain-hawking-idUSTRE6811FN20100902|author=Michael Holden |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=2010-10-17 |date=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The authors explain, in a manner consistent with [[M-theory]], that as the Earth is only one of several [[planet]]s in our [[solar system]], and as our [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]] is only one of many galaxies, the same may apply to our universe itself: that is, our universe may be one of a huge number of universes.&lt;ref name = cosmology /&gt;

The book concludes with the statement that only some universes of the multiple universes (or [[multiverse]]) support life forms and that we are located in one of those universes. The laws of nature that are required for life forms to exist appear in some universes by pure chance {{clarify|date=May 2018}}, Hawking and Mlodinow explain (see [[Anthropic principle]]).&lt;ref name = cosmology /&gt;

==Reactions==

===Positive reactions===
[[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologist]] and advocate for [[atheism]] [[Richard Dawkins]] welcomed Hawking's position and said that "[[Darwinism]] kicked God out of biology but physics remained more uncertain. Hawking is now administering the [[coup de grace]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Another ungodly squabble|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2010/09/science_and_religion|publisher=The Economist |accessdate=2010-09-06|date=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretical physicist [[Sean M. Carroll]], writing in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', described the book as speculative but ambitious: "The important lesson of ''The Grand Design'' is not so much the particular theory being advocated but the sense that science may be able to answer the deep 'Why?' questions that are part of fundamental human curiosity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704358904575477583868227458|title=The 'Why?'

[[Cosmologist]] [[Lawrence Krauss]], in his article "Our Spontaneous Universe", wrote that "there are remarkable, testable arguments that provide firmer [[empirical evidence]] of the possibility that our universe arose from nothing. ... If our universe arose spontaneously from nothing at all, one might predict that its total energy should be zero. And when we measure the total energy of the universe, which could have been anything, the answer turns out to be the only one consistent with this possibility. Coincidence? Maybe. But data like this coming in from our revolutionary new tools promise to turn much of what is now [[metaphysics]] into physics. Whether God survives is anyone's guess."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703946504575469653720549936|title=Our Spontaneous Universe|publisher=Wall Street Journal|author=Lawrence Krauss|author-link=Lawrence Krauss|date=2010-09-08|accessdate=2010-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Trefil]], a professor of physics at [[George Mason University]], said in his ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' review: "I've waited a long time for this book. It gets into the deepest questions of modern [[cosmology]] without a single equation. The reader will be able to get through it without bogging down in a lot of technical detail and will, I hope, have his or her appetite whetted for books with a deeper technical content. And who knows? Maybe in the end the whole [[multiverse]] idea will actually turn out to be right!"&lt;ref name = cosmology /&gt;
&lt;!--- remmed-out comment - per [[Talk:The Grand Design (book)#Honestly|present talk consensus]]
Spiritual teacher [[Deepak Chopra]], in a joint interview with [[Leonard Mlodinow|Mlodinow]] mentioned: "We have to congratulate Leonard and Stephen for finally contributing to the climactic overthrow of the superstition of materialism, because everything that we call matter comes from this domain which is invisible, which is beyond space and time. All religious experience is based on just three basic fundamental ideas."&lt;ref&gt;CNN - Larry King Live, interview with Stephen Hawking, Leonard Mlodinow, Deepak Chopra, Robert Spitzer. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIttENo2eOM&amp;feature=watch_response_rev around minute 8]&lt;/ref&gt;
---&gt;
Canada Press journalist Carl Hartman said: "Cosmologists, the people who study the entire cosmos, will want to read British physicist and mathematician Stephen Hawking's new book. ''The Grand Design'' may sharpen appetites for answers to questions like 'Why is there something rather than nothing?' and 'Why do we exist?' – questions that have troubled thinking people at least as far back as the ancient Greeks."

Writing in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', [[Michael Moorcock]] praised the authors: "their arguments do indeed bring us closer to seeing our world, universe and multiverse in terms that a previous generation might easily have dismissed as supernatural. This succinct, easily digested book could perhaps do with fewer dry, academic groaners, but Hawking and Mlodinow pack in a wealth of ideas and leave us with a clearer understanding of modern physics in all its invigorating complexity."&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

German daily ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' devoted the whole opening page of its culture section to ''The Grand Design''. [[CERN]] physicist and novelist [[Ralf Bönt]] reviews the history of the [[theory of everything]] from the 18th century to [[M-theory]], and takes Hawking's conclusion on God's existence as a very good joke which he obviously welcomes very much.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boent.eu/hawking_eng.html|title=A Brief History of the Theory of Everything: Stephen Hawking Makes a Joke, and it Works|publisher=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]|author=Ralf Bönt|date=September 2010|accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Best selling author [[Deepak Chopra]] in an interview with [[CNN]] said: "We have to congratulate Leonard and Stephen for finally, finally contributing to the climatic overthrow of the superstition of materialism. Because everything that we call matter comes from this domain which is invisible, which is beyond space and time. All religious experience is based on just three basic fundamental ideas...And nothing in the book invalidates any of these three ideas".&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1009/10/lkl.01.html CNN LARRY KING LIVE Interview With Stephen Hawking; Science and Religion Aired September 10, 2010 - 21:00 ET]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reactions===
[[Roger Penrose]] in the ''[[Financial Times|FT]]'' doubts that adequate understandings can come from this approach, and points out that "unlike quantum mechanics, [[M-theory]] enjoys no observational support whatsoever".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/bdf3ae28-b6e9-11df-b3dd-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1CSIgPlwa|title=The Grand Design|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|author=Roger Penrose|author-link=Roger Penrose|date=4 September 2010|accessdate=2015-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Silk]] in ''Science'' suggests that "Some humbleness would be welcome here...A century or two hence...I expect that M-theory will seem as naïve to cosmologists of the future as we now find [[Pythagoras]]'s cosmology of the [[harmony of the spheres]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/330/6001/179.full?sid=a54cb031-266d-4ad0-a458-9febf387a351 One Theory to Rule Them All] by [[Joe Silk]] ''Science'' 8 October 2010: Vol. 330 no. 6001 pp. 179-180 {{doi|10.1126/science.1197317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerald Schroeder]] in "The Big Bang Creation: God or the Laws of Nature" explains that "The Grand Design breaks the news, bitter to some, that … to create a universe from absolute nothing God is not necessary. All that is needed are the laws of nature. … [That is,] there can have been a big bang creation without the help of God, provided the laws of nature pre-date the universe. Our concept of time begins with the creation of the universe. Therefore if the laws of nature created the universe, these laws must have existed prior to time; that is the laws of nature would be outside of time. What we have then is totally non-physical laws, outside of time, creating a universe. Now that description might sound somewhat familiar. Very much like the biblical concept of God: not physical, outside of time, able to create a universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geraldschroeder.com/BigBang.aspx|title=The Big Bang Creation: God or the Laws of Nature|accessdate=2015-05-01|author=Gerald Schroeder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dwight Garner (critic)|Dwight Garner]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' was critical of the book, saying: "The real news about ''The Grand Design'' is how disappointingly tinny and inelegant it is. The spare and earnest voice that Mr. Hawking employed with such appeal in ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'' has been replaced here by one that is alternately condescending, as if he were [[Fred Rogers|Mr. Rogers]] explaining rain clouds to toddlers, and impenetrable."&lt;ref name=NYT090910/&gt;

[[Craig Callender]], in the ''[[New Scientist]]'', was not convinced by the theory promoted in the book: "M-theory&amp;nbsp;... is far from complete. But that doesn't stop the authors from asserting that it explains the mysteries of existence&amp;nbsp;... In the absence of theory, though, this is nothing more than a hunch doomed – until we start watching universes come into being – to remain untested. The lesson isn't that we face a dilemma between God and the [[multiverse]], but that we shouldn't go off the rails at the first sign of coincidences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2010/09/stephen-hawking-says-theres-no-theory-of-everything.html|title=Stephen Hawking says there's no theory of everything|author=Craig Callender|date=2010-09-02|work=New Scientist|accessdate=2010-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Davies]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote: "The multiverse comes with a lot of baggage, such as an overarching space and time to host all those bangs, a universe-generating mechanism to trigger them, physical fields to populate the universes with material stuff, and a selection of forces to make things happen. Cosmologists embrace these features by envisaging sweeping "meta-laws" that pervade the multiverse and spawn specific bylaws on a universe-by-universe basis. The meta-laws themselves remain unexplained – eternal, immutable transcendent entities that just happen to exist and must simply be accepted as given. In that respect the meta-laws have a similar status to an unexplained transcendent god." Davies concludes "there is no compelling need for a supernatural being or prime mover to start the universe off. But when it comes to the laws that explain the big bang, we are in murkier waters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/sep/04/stephen-hawking-big-bang-gap|title=Stephen Hawking's big bang gaps|author=Paul Davies|date=2010-09-04|accessdate=2010-09-12 | location=London | work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Marcelo Gleiser]], in his article "Hawking And God: An Intimate Relationship", stated that "contemplating a final theory is inconsistent with the very essence of physics, an empirical science based on the gradual collection of data. Because we don’t have instruments capable of measuring all of Nature, we cannot ever be certain that we have a final theory. There’ll always be room for surprises, as the history of physics has shown again and again. In fact, I find it quite pretentious to imagine that we humans can achieve such a thing. ... Maybe Hawking should leave God alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/13.7/2010/09/08/129736414/hawking-and-god-an-intimate-relationship|title=Hawking And God: An Intimate Relationship|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|author=Marcelo Gleiser|author-link=Marcelo Gleiser|date=2010-09-09|accessdate=2010-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist [[Peter Woit]], of [[Columbia University]], has criticized the book: "One thing that is sure to generate sales for a book of this kind is to somehow drag in religion. The book's rather conventional claim that "God is unnecessary" for explaining physics and early universe cosmology has provided a lot of publicity for the book. I'm in favor of naturalism and leaving God out of physics as much as the next person, but if you're the sort who wants to go to battle in the [[science/religion wars]], why you would choose to take up such a dubious weapon as M-theory mystifies me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=3141|title=Hawking Gives Up|first=Peter|last=Woit|author-link=Peter Woit|date=2010-09-08|accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Scientific American]]'', [[John Horgan (American journalist)|John Horgan]] is not sympathetic to the book: 
"M-theory, theorists now realize, comes in an almost infinite number of versions, which "predict" an almost infinite number of possible universes. Critics call this the "[[Alice's Restaurant]] problem," a reference to the refrain of the old [[Arlo Guthrie]] folk song: "You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant." Of course, a theory that predicts everything really doesn't predict anything...
The [[anthropic principle]] has always struck me as so dumb that I can't understand why anyone takes it seriously. It's cosmology's version of [[creationism]]. ... The physicist [[Tony Rothman]], with whom I worked at ''Scientific American'' in the 1990s, liked to say that the anthropic principle in any form is completely ridiculous and hence should be called CRAP. ...
Hawking is telling us that unconfirmable M-theory plus the anthropic tautology represents the end of that quest. If we believe him, the joke’s on us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/2010/09/13/cosmic-clowning-stephen-hawkings-new-theory-of-everything-is-the-same-old-crap/|title=Cosmic Clowning: Stephen Hawking's "new" theory of everything is the same old CRAP|publisher=Scientific American|author=John Horgan|author-link=John Horgan (American journalist)|date=2010-09-13|accessdate=2015-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Economist]]'' is also critical of the book: Hawking and Mlodinow "...say that these surprising ideas have passed every experimental test to which they have been put, but that is misleading in a way that is unfortunately typical of the authors. It is the bare bones of quantum mechanics that have proved to be consistent with what is presently known of the subatomic world. The authors' interpretations and extrapolations of it have not been subjected to any decisive tests, and it is not clear that they ever could be. 
Once upon a time it was the province of philosophy to propose ambitious and outlandish theories in advance of any concrete evidence for them. Perhaps science, as Professor Hawking and Mr Mlodinow practice it in their airier moments, has indeed changed places with philosophy, though probably not quite in the way that they think."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16990802?story_id=16990802|title=Understanding the universe - Order of creation|publisher=The Economist|date=2010-09-09|accessdate=2010-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bishop of Swindon]], Dr. [[Lee Rayfield]], said, "Science can never prove the non-existence of God, just as it can never prove the existence of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stephen Hawking: God did not create Universe|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11161493|publisher=BBC |accessdate=2010-09-03 |date=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anglican]] [[priest]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] [[theologian]] and [[psychologist]] [[The Reverend|Rev.]] Dr. Fraser N.

That view is not undermined by what Hawking has said."&lt;ref name = CNN/&gt;

British scientist [[Baroness Greenfield]] also criticized the book in an interview with [[BBC Radio]]: "Of course they can make whatever comments they like, but when they assume, rather in a [[Taliban]]-like way, that they have all the answers, then I do feel uncomfortable." She later claimed her Taliban remarks were "not intended to be personal", saying she "admired Stephen Hawking greatly" and "had no wish to compare him in particular to the Taliban".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baroness Greenfield criticises 'Taliban-like' Stephen Hawking|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/stephen-hawking/7988785/Baroness-Greenfield-criticises-Taliban-like-Stephen-Hawking.html|author= Alastair Jamieson|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=2010-09-08|accessdate=2015-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denis Alexander]] responded to [[Stephen Hawking]]'s The Grand Design by stating that "the 'god' that Stephen Hawking is trying to debunk is not the creator God of the Abrahamic faiths who really is the ultimate explanation for why there is something rather than nothing", adding that "Hawking's god is a god-of-the-gaps used to plug present gaps in our scientific knowledge." "Science provides us with a wonderful narrative as to how [existence] may happen, but theology addresses the meaning of the narrative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Allen Greene, CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/09/02/hawking.god.universe/?hpt=T2 |title=Stephen Hawking: God didn't create universe |publisher=CNN.com |date=2 September 2010 |accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mathematician]] and [[philosopher of science]] [[Wolfgang Smith]] wrote a chapter-by-chapter summary and critique of the book, first published in ''Sophia: The Journal of Traditional Studies'',&lt;ref&gt;Sophia: The Journal of Traditional Studies, Volume 16, No 2, 2011,
pp. 5-48.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently published as "From Physics to Science Fiction: Response to Stephen Hawking" in the 2012 edition of his collection of essays, ''Science &amp; Myth''.

The '''Unitarian Universalist Buddhist Fellowship''' ('''UUBF''') is a "Related Organization" (formerly an "Independent Affiliate") to the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] (UUA). Formed in the early 1990s, the UUBF exists to facilitate dialogue among UU Buddhists and other UUs interested in Buddhism and its practices. It is open to all Unitarian Universalists who are Buddhists of any tradition or who are interested in learning more about Buddhism. The UUBF publishes a newsletter, the ''UU Sangha'', and posts back issues in an archive on its website. The website also has a list of UU Buddhist and meditation groups and contact information.  Instructions for joining the UUBF Listserv are there also.  Each year there is a UUBF booth in the exhibit hall  at UUA General Assembly. Every other year, in odd years, the UUBF holds a Convocation.

'''Vedic mythology''' refers to the mythological aspects of the [[historical Vedic religion]] and [[Vedic literature]], alluded to in the hymns of the [[Rigveda]]. The central myth at the base of Vedic ritual surrounds [[Indra]] who, inebriated with [[Soma (drink)|Soma]], slays the dragon (''ahi'') [[Vrtra|Vritra]], freeing the [[Rigvedic rivers|rivers]], the cows and [[Ushas|Dawn]].

Vedic lore contains numerous elements which are common to Indo-European mythological traditions, like the mythologies of [[Persian mythology|Persia]], [[Greek mythology|Greece]], and [[Roman mythology|Rome]], and that of the Celtic, Germanic, Baltic and Slavic peoples. The Vedic god [[Indra]] in part corresponds to [[Dyaus Pita]]r, the Sky Father, [[Zeus]] and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] or [[Perun]]. The deity [[Yama]], the lord of  the dead, is [[Jamshid|Yima]] of Persian mythology. Vedic hymns refer to these and other deities, often 33, consisting of 8 Vasus, 11 Rudras, 12 Adityas, and the late Rigvedic Prajapati. These deities belong to the 3 dimensions of the universe/heavens, the earth, and the intermediate space. Some major deities of the Vedic tradition include [[Indra]], [[Surya]], [[Agni]], [[Ushas]], [[Vayu]], [[Varuna]], [[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitra]], [[Aditi]], [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]], [[Soma (deity)|Soma]], [[Sarasvati]], [[Prithvi]], and [[Rudra]].&lt;ref name = AAM&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Arthur Anthony Macdonell|Macdonell, Arthur Anthony]] |title=Vedic Mythology |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |location=Delhi |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=81-208-1113-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7Meabtj8mcC&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Vedas in Puranic mythology==
{{Main|Puranas}}
The [[Vishnu Purana]] attributes the current arrangement of four Vedas to the mythical sage [[Vedavyasa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vishnu Purana|author= [[Horace Hayman Wilson]] (trans)|year=1840|chapter= Ch IV|url= http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/vp/vp078.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puranic tradition also postulates a single original Veda that, in varying accounts, was divided into three or four parts.

According to the [[Vishnu Purana]] (3.2.18, 3.3.4 etc.) the original Veda was divided into four parts, and further fragmented into numerous shakhas, by [[Vishnu]] in the form of [[Vyasa]], in the [[Dvapara Yuga]]; the [[Vayu Purana]] (section 60) recounts a similar division by Vyasa, at the urging of [[Brahma]]. The [[Bhagavata Purana]] (12.6.37) traces the origin of the primeval Veda to the syllable [[Om|aum]], and says that it was divided into four at the start of ''Dvapara Yuga'', because men had declined in age, virtue and understanding. Another view is that the original veda was called Pranava Veda and is attributed to Brahmarishi Mayan, the great architect.  This Veda is held by Vaastu Vedic Trust. In a differing account, the Bhagavata Purana (9.14.43) attributes the division of the primeval veda (''om'') into three parts to the monarch [[Pururavas]] at the beginning of [[Treta Yuga]]. 
Rig, Sama, Yajur and Atharva constitute the "Four Vedas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Four Vedas|url=http://hinduism.about.com/cs/vedasvedanta/a/aa120103a_2.htm|work= About dot Com|accessdate=7 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rig Veda]] (mantras) is a collection of inspired songs or hymns and is a main source of information on the Rig Vedic civilization. The [[Sama Veda]] (songs) is purely a liturgical collection of melodies (saman). The hymns in the Sama Veda, used as musical notes, were almost completely drawn from the Rigveda and have no distinctive lessons of their own. The [[Yajur Veda]] (rituals) is also a liturgical collection and was made to meet the demands of a ceremonial religion. The [[Atharva Veda]] (spells) is completely different from the other three Vedas and is next in importance to Rigveda with regard to history and sociology.

'''Xu Xin''' ({{zh|c=徐新|p=Xú Xīn}}; born June 16, 1949) is a professor at [[Nanjing University]] and China's leading [[Judaic]] scholar,&lt;ref name="Niebuhr"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/13/us/religion-journal-a-professor-in-nanjing-takes-up-jewish-studies.html|title=Religion Journal; A Professor in Nanjing Takes Up Jewish Studies|last=Niebuhr|first=Gustav|date=13 March 1999|website=New York Times|publisher=|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the founder and director of [[Institute of Jewish Studies (Nanjing)|the Diane and Guilford Glazer Institute for Jewish and Israel Studies]] at Nanjing University in [[Nanjing]], China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/10542/chinese-open-new-chapter-with-the-people-of-the-bo/|last=Xu|first=Xin|title=Chinese Open New Chapter With the People of the Book|website=The Jewish Daily Forward|date=20 April 2007|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1986, he taught mostly [[English literature|English]] and [[American literature]] with a focus on [[American Jewish]] authors. Since 1986, he has focused on the study of [[Judaism]], [[Jewish culture]], and the [[history of the Jews in China|history of Chinese Jews]].

== Education and professional life ==
Xu was born in [[Jinan]] ([[Shandong]] province) in 1949 and graduated from [[Nanjing University]] in 1977 as an English major. He became a faculty member the same year. Until 1986, he taught post-[[World War II]] [[English literature#1940 to the 21st century|English]] and [[American literature#Post–World War II|American literature]] with a focus on [[American Jewish]] authors.&lt;ref name="Niebuhr"/&gt; His interest in [[Jewish American literature|American Jewish authors]] began when [[Saul Bellow]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1976 and [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]] in 1978.&lt;ref name="pioneer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2008-11/04/content_7173357.htm|title=Xu Xin, a pioneer in research|website=China Daily|date=4 November 2008|last=Song|first=Wenwei|accessdate=17 January 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, while teaching a course on American Jewish authors, he met a Jew for the first time: Professor James Friend, chair of the English Department at [[Chicago State University]] in [[Chicago]], who had come to teach in [[Nanjing]] for a semester.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishindependent.ca/archives/may11/archives11may27-02.html |title=Jewish studies in China |last=Cohen |first=Eva |website=Jewish Independent |date=27 May 2011 |accessdate=17 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116143045/http://www.jewishindependent.ca/archives/may11/archives11may27-02.html |archivedate=January 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Friend invited Xu to be an exchange professor at Chicago State. While there, Xu lived with the Friend family (in [[Lincolnwood]], [[Illinois]]) and began to study Judaism seriously.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; He visited [[Israel]] on his way back to China in 1988, when there were no [[diplomatic relations]] between Israel and China.

Upon his return to Nanjing, he discovered that he got a larger audience when he lectured about his three weeks in Israel than when he talked about his two-year stay in the [[United States]]. Seeing the need to disseminate information about Israel and Jewish culture, Xu engaged scholars to work on an abridged Chinese translation of the [[Encyclopedia Judaica]], which he edited.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; The publisher wanted a $10,000 subsidy for the work, which was raised by donations in the U.S.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The book sold out upon publication and a second edition was printed. When China and Israel opened diplomatic relations in 1992, the [[Chinese government]] purchased copies for diplomats assigned to Israel. Chinese Jewish families in [[Kaifeng]] as well as the religious studies departments of many universities also received copies.

Xu was tenured as [[full professor]] in 1994. His small-scale class on [[Judaism]] (which he originally taught in English) has developed into a multi-level curriculum attended by hundreds of students. Xu has also created MA and PhD programs on Jewish history and culture. All the doctoral candidates spend a year studying in Israel and graduates of the program have begun centers for [[Judaic Studies]] at other universities throughout China.&lt;ref name="pioneer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="podcast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/confront-antisemitism/antisemitism-podcast/xu-xin|title=Xu Xin (podcast interview on ''Voices on antisemitism'')|first=Aleisa|last=Fleishman|website=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|date=8 October 2009|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
